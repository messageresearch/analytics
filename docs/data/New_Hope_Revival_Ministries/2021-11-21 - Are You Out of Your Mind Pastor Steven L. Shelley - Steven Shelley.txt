are many sick fighting this morning so let's lift them up to the lord this morning do you have a unspoken prayer request by the lifting of your hand i know there are many would you ask the lord to give wisdom and strengthen brother greeley who's trying to repair a water leak out in the main parking lot or just in beside the parking lot we came in this morning it was flooded and we need to get that is this the main part of the main line so we need to get that taken care of and i appreciate him doing it so much ask the lord to help him continue to remember brother steve curry i spoke with sister anita just a few minutes ago and there are things in his body that we need the lord to do and there are still miracles yet to take place so we're asking the lord for that one thing that you could pray very targeted is that his body would multiply the moisture that it gets the fluids that it's able to take he's drinking but it's still not enough because of the hospice care he's not getting any fluids through the veins right now and uh he is not able to get enough to meet every need of every cell of his body so we're asking the lord to flood him and with what he gets to drink let it just multiply and you know god can do things we don't have to tell him how to do it but that was the only thing that came to me when i was praying before i came out here the lord would just multiply that and uh there are folks traveling some are not here today because of travel some are traveling this week believing us and some coming this way we want the lord to watch over them and keep each one of them safe in his tender care and some are grieving the loss of loved ones we have friends around the states that have lost loved ones this week to covet and they're dealing with it and fighting through it let's ask the lord to help them amen amen let's go to the lord and pray this morning [Music] babbling and so many others i don't need to call them all but god knows somehow he sees them sing this with me this morning no one can touch you like jesus can't no one can give you peace you cannot understand [Music] [Music] no one can touch you like jesus can't sing it out no one can touch you like jesus can't no one can give you peace you cannot understand [Music] no one can touch you like [Music] brother jesus would you come pray this morning touch you like jesus no one can give you peace [Music] no one can touch you like jesus [Music] oh abba father you're so good to us no matter the storm you're always there with an answer you're always there with the help in hand may not

hand clap of praise hallelujah he's worthy he's so worthy you may be seated this morning i want to brag just a little bit on the musicians that we have i want to brag on the worship leading this morning and one of the reasons why is there ben sent a text early this morning this morning ben this morning he sent a text and he said we ought to try to sing the song i raise a hallelujah and so a new song is at the last minute is not always a good thing but they just determined to get in here and they only had a short time we had a few few little obstacles a flooded uh field out there and several things going on but they came in here and they uh went over it i don't know not many times two or three times and presented it this morning without flaw and i'm touched i really am i appreciate it so much the song is special [Applause] and what was so wonderful is most of you knew it i heard so many people singing it and so it was just meant to be but it couldn't be if we didn't have musicians who were willing to just jump in here and say well what we can do is try the worst thing that can happen is it don't go over all that well and we but we prayed in the back that god would anoint their hands to move and and find the right chord change and everything they needed to do and i thought it was beautiful enough that we should mention it and you know the words are just right they're just right i i raise a hallelujah right in the middle of the storm you know what else is there to do but give god praise because he deserves it he deserves the praise and some of you are being tested in your praise but thank god you're praising him anyway amen giving him praise anyway he's worthy sister evelyn why don't you come and sing and just shock us all and shock you even more would you we don't have a singer this morning so i don't know what she'll sing but since i just bragged on these musicians the pressure is on isn't it but i know they'll do fine sister evelyn hasn't sung for us in a long time and uh be glad to hear from her this morning and i know you'll be blessed by it and while she's getting ready i'll just say hello to all of these streamers and uh you know we're just blessed we're blessed to be preaching this morning in virginia and trinidad and pennsylvania and tucson and i don't know where all else but god sees each one of you and it's so kind of you to let us know the netherlands and uh our i love this comment from british columbia i hope and trust that you all are all right there i know there's a lot of flooding going on but this is a precious brother yes we raise a hallelujah our king jesus is alive greetings from sia family in vancouver british columbia canada and they've been streaming with us for weeks now and we appreciate that here's a pastor brother charles gillard who says god bless a pastor from from god blessed pastor from united kingdom and it goes on and on and we just want to believe that god will touch each and every one let's worship the lord as sister evelyn sings you can testify a little too if you want to if you have the words to the battle belongs to the lord if y'all would help me i woke up singing that this morning battle belongs to the lord you'll just help me and heavenly armor will enter the land the battle belongs to the lord no weapon that's fashioned against us will stand the battle belongs to the lord and we sing glory on honor power and strength to the lord we sing glory on [Music] the earth of darkness [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] do not fear [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] glory on earth [Music] to the glory [Music] and we sing glory on earth power and strength to our lord [Music] we sing glory [Music] strength [Music] praise god [Applause] how many of you believe the battle belongs to the lord it certainly does i'm so thankful that we know that this morning tuesday night of this week at seven o'clock we'll have our regular tuesday night service and we will do as we have done for many years now dedicate that service to testimonies of our thanksgiving to god it's not that we can only be thankful one time a year but it's a time that we set aside to remember what god has done for us so you that have not had an opportunity and you that have to testify lately then you can prepare you've got two days to work on your testimony and we're going to look forward to hearing from you on tuesday night and then next sunday morning at 11 o'clock there's a service here and then sunday afternoon at five o'clock there's going to be a gathering for hanukkah time and uh for those of you who are visiting or those of you who are streaming you may find it strange that we uh celebrate hanukkah but we do it because jesus did it's in the book of john that he was there in the temple at the feast of dedication i didn't find any scriptures there where he went to a christmas party or where he went to an easter cantata but i do find a scripture where he was at the temple on the feast of dedication so it's a time for us to gather together as families and all are welcome to come and bring something to eat and we'll have fellowship and the kids will have games and if there's anyone who doesn't know how to get there we'll explain that to you next sunday but we're looking forward to a good time in the lord and that is the first night of hanukkah and so that would be the night the first candle is lit and uh it also happens to be our wedding anniversary but that's for next week to talk about today is zach and liz's wedding anniversary how many years seven years that's a good number great number i think you all can make it seven years happy anniversary [Applause] to those of you who ask from time to time about ma uh maybe ashley would be a better person to tell to ask about her day today because when we saw her yesterday i would have to tell you that she's exactly the same as she was the last time i saw her and so there are not any any uh positive changes so much but there are not any really negative changes as well she is at peace she had had lunch they had just put her back in the bed she was getting ready for her afternoon nap and uh she was sleepy that's for sure but we had a little while with her talk to her a little bit and uh it will never be easy for those of you who have been there it will never be easy for somebody that you have loved so dearly to just look through you and you realize that they really have no idea who who you are that's a very hard thing as so many of you know but i'm thankful that she uh is not suffering and i'm thankful that i don't know why as we sung in some of the songs this morning i don't understand the reasons why she is still here but there has to be a reason because god never makes a mistake and she could go tomorrow or she may be here years from now because she just seems quite happy and sassy none of that has changed and uh she did give me a couple real sweet winks and i appreciated them um but the best that you can do is to pray for her and i think that the nursing home is open a little bit more now and and if you wanted to go in you probably could arrange to do that with a mask and and all the other things that they uh have you to go through but i feel blessed that she's in a good place and is well taken care of and i thank you for praying for her and i'm mentioning her because today is her 76th birthday and so when you think of her pray for her that god's perfect will will be done in her body and in her life and then tuesday of this week is another big anniversary that would be josh and charity's anniversary is that right on tuesday how many years five boy these good numbers let's say happy anniversary to them five years i think you're going to make it i just i didn't want to say that about one and not say it about the other in case anybody was listening uh i believe they're gonna make it and then the next day is josh's birthday how old do you turn the next day 29 28. oh i was going to say your last year in the 20s but 28 so happy birthday to josh god bless you why don't we stand together and go to the word of god and i appreciate your pull this morning i hope you'll recognize that we are missing some and we need your help and uh well i've just gotta and and we bragged on the musicians but we didn't maybe really give them let's let's really thank god for them thank you so much appreciate what you've done the backup singers and all these folks in the sound booth too sometimes they don't get to enjoy it as much as others because they're busy working but may god bless them what is it my cord is hanging out all right well i want to is it in now uh it must have all must have all been hanging out john chapter eight this is a little bit of a hodgepodge this morning you know what that means it's a little bit of this and a little bit of that kind of like granny's goulash or something but we're going back to where we were and uh the second part of this i'm going to call are you out of your mind but the first part i'm going to continue with where i was john chapter 8 verse 31-37 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou that uh how sayest thou you shall be made free jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son s o n abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free i'm asking is there anyone here this morning that's been made free by the son if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed that's not a little bit of free that's an abundance of free free indeed i know that you are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me and he explains very carefully why because my word hath no place in you god doesn't have any grandchildren so we can't claim our family line when we stand in the presence of the lord it's only if there is a place in you for god's seed to lay and if that is the case you have made a manger for the word of god the lion then you are a blessed and chosen vessel today because there's a world around us and a church around us that cannot make room for him no matter how hard they've tried they have failed in making room for him there is a people prepared before the foundation of the world to carry the seed of god in the earth particularly in the last days i counted an honor and a privilege to be one of those it doesn't give me bride pride it makes me sometimes want to lay on my face in the carpet and say lord i don't know why you would have chosen me but i'm thankful that you did let's pray a minute father we love you today our hearts have overflowed as we worshiped you and sung praises to your name now i'm so thankful lord that we can call on you anytime anywhere under any circumstances and you are always awake always alert always ready to hear from your children and so lord today we approach your word it is the word of life i am thankful for every person here each visitor each one who is a part of the home congregation and also those who are streaming around the world i'm grateful today that we could be gathered together this way and i ask oh lord above all that your word may find a lodging place into every one of our lives for your glory we don't want to just be carriers of the word but we want to be doers also we understand lord that there's a difference between the seed and the shock and we ask o god that you would help us to manifest who we are as your sons and as your seed we rebuke and defy every force of the enemy because we are covered by the blood of the spotless lamb we ask that every opposing spirit be driven from our midst today that heaven might break through in your holy word and you might equip us and help us to press in to everything you have prepared for us and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated i want to go to the message the choosing of a bride it is a message that we read from on tuesday evening and there were many of you who who did not have the privilege of being here and i don't know if you streamed or if you caught the the archive already or not but i have been captured by these three paragraphs i want to read them again as though i never read them to you and i want you to let them sink down into your heart i want you to understand you cannot choose the day of your deliverance you can choose freedom but you cannot choose the day of your deliverance god chooses that if he comes to help you it's at his choice you call but if he comes to break through in your life it's because of his sovereign will and so if you sense the holy spirit wooing you at any time any time you feel his presence it doesn't matter if you're riding down the road and there's a uh somebody in the vehicle with you that doesn't know anything about the things of god and you can't help it the peace of the lord overwhelms you and a tear kind of comes up in the corner of your eye don't ever be ashamed that you're sensitive to the holy spirit of god there's a people around us that don't even know he exists and so to know that he's real is a gift it's a blessing help me it's a privilege to be able to even know that he's real to even know that he exists you may be on the job or you may be in a public place or something may catch your attention and it may draw the presence of the lord he may be moving around you and wooing over your heart that's the minute to say amen that's the moment to respond to him if you sense that he has come to heal you that's the moment to stand up and say i take my healing in the name of the lord jesus christ nobody's going to be disturbed with you if you do that in the right atmosphere in a service [Music] when some of you move like that when faith arises in the building and we've mentioned several weeks about people just coming to worship or maybe there's a high moment in a sermon a message and god is moving in here and somebody stands up and claps their hands it's not going to offend us it's not going to disturb us what you may be doing i don't know what your motive is but what you may be doing is personally claiming something that you sense happening around you and if you're doing that it's in that moment that you need to put all your attention on the lord and exercise all the faith that you have don't let any god-ordained moment pass you by it is possible even in predestination to miss the moment of your deliverance to miss the chosen and perfect moment that god would break through in your life he has a permissive will and so if you should recognize i didn't get in when i should have got in we know his mercy is extended to us and we just have to say lord forgive me that i miss an opportunity to receive something that you had prepared for me i'm so sorry and now i'm ready lord when you're ready will you pass my way again will you step up into my life again and accomplish what your desires are for me and i believe i've watched god's mercy do that i've seen the grace of god extended again to those who missed him in their stubbornness who missed him in their busyness that's his grace that's his love so to miss it forever i don't believe but can you miss an appointment you can but you need to remember he never misses one if you believe that same man the choosing of a bride and it's a dangerous thing this is paragraph 41. it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour too because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it how many of you know when a wrong spirit is taking a hold of a life the the problem is if that is a vessel that has once been cleaned now that life has taken on the influence of a foul spirit that enemy is never satisfied to stay at the level of his entry he always wants to magnify and multiply and intensify and if he can't take more control of your life how many of you know what jesus said he does he just calls out to others we mentioned that a couple of weeks ago that demon will just call out to other similar demons you know i was studying even this morning maybe i'll just i don't know if i want to pause to do this right now or not let me see if i do maybe i do because it's at the very last speck of my notes and i may never get there how many of you would like to take a list of some of the spirits that brother branham refers to specifically when he's teaching on demonology i'm going to give you a list whether you want them or not i'm going to give you a list and i'm going to categorize those into the three realms that brother branham talks about these demon spirits operating in number one and you can find the basis of this message uh in the demonology series but there are many other places where brother branham is speaking particularly in prayer lines where he's talking about how these spirits operate how they strengthen one another how they call to one another to attract one another so that they might be strengthened in taking a hold of somebody's life or building a stronghold in a community of faith in the spirit realm and we'll go back we're not going to teach on this this morning but i've been wanting to give you this list now for a couple services in the spirit realm he said there's nervousness depression now remember i i don't want to leave that hanging remember brother branham talks about a spiritual man or person or woman being nervous now that is a a condition that is necessary for that individual to be sensitive to both and foremost god the holy spirit the leadership of the holy spirit but he may also need to be sensitive to that other side so that he can recognize in discernment what's going on what kind of a spirit is trying to operate that's not particularly the kind of nervousness brother branham is talking about in a prayer line when he would speak to someone and he'd say now lady your problem is you're just so nervous you just get so nervous and it's affecting your physical body maybe causing an ulcer or some other physical condition so brother branham is kind of explaining to us that a spirit that manifests from the spiritual realm can cause a physical malady now that's interesting to note so when brother branham is talking about nervousness it's probably closer here to anxiety and how many of you know anxiety you don't have to be anxious to be spiritual so you understand you can be nervous you may have to be nervous to pick up on spirits sensitive we will say but anxiety and anxiousness will cause fear and fear doesn't bring us into the realms of the spirit fear brings us into death fear brings us into doubt so he mentions number one nervousness depression arrogance he speaks specifically about demons manifesting themselves in a religious realm with a with a demeanor of arrogance maybe you've seen that see if you recognize this one this is the one that really sort of got in my mind this morning as i was looking at this he calls it a sullen sullen sullen ungodly spirit sullen well i thought in my mind i knew what sullen meant but i thought i better check it out so i looked it up before i came over here this morning it means sulky sulky gloomy and can mean bad tempered you ever seen that kind of a spirit manifesting in somebody where they were sulky sullen gloomy you know that's brother branham said that's not of god wait just a moment amen he said that is a demon spirit manifesting in the spiritual realm that means that spirit's got to be dealt with god does not want his children to be sulky pouty you know that's what it means he doesn't want us to pout with one another i felt that thing take a hold of me i know what a pouty thing can do the best way for you to see yourself is for me to be transparent and tell you i have recognized a pouty spirit trying to get on me that's not of god and brother branham said that has to be addressed just like any other demonic spirit a sullen ungodly spirit insanity worldly spirits all of this he said are demons that manifest in the spirit world in the spirit realm worldly spirits spirit of darkness drinking smoking bad habits now in the physical realm these are the ones that brother branham mentioned there's hundreds more but these are the ones that he specifically mentions a tumor cancer pneumonia arthritis cataracts rheumatism tuberculosis epilepsy asthmatic conditions germ diseases ulcer deafness blindness etc of all the listing there the one that shocked me the most was a cataract brother branham said that is a demon expressing himself in the physical realm now somebody said oh no i've had a cataract i don't want to have a demon please understand it doesn't mean somebody has a demon it means that a demon is projecting itself in the physical realm did anybody notice how many of those things are related to breathing tuberculosis asthmatic condition pneumonia that got me to thinking more than any other part of the body what has been attacked across the world in the last couple of years the lungs pneumonia oh and let's not mention germ diseases because a germ disease brother branham talks one time and he says something about it being viral we know it can be viral or bacterial viral disease and bacterial disease are both considered germ diseases and they have their their origin in a germ and the prophet said these are demon spirits that like to manifest themselves in the physical realm against people i want to say particularly against god's people now you know what that tells me it tells me that you and i have power and authority over tumors and cancer and pneumonia and arthritis and cataracts and rheumatism and tuberculosis and empath on and on it also shows me that as believers we have authority over worldly spirits and spirits of darkness and drinking and smoking and habits and even sullen ungodly spirits you have authority even over pouty devils why would the enemy want you to be sullen why would he want you to be pouty well first of all you can't be grateful and thankful and pouty at the same time that old sullen spirit will rob us of our joy it'll take away our very thro zest i'm gonna use the word zest for life it'll suck us like a leech until there's nothing left in us and i'll tell you that ought to make you mad how many of you have ever had a loved one that was fighting cancer and you and it made you mad when you thought about what cancer was doing to their body it makes me mad when i think about how those cells eat up a body and sometimes it takes a little bit of that of that stirring up and a righteous indignation to get on us so that we begin to realize that god has given us authority over those things that are manifestations of the demonic now mind you brother branham did say that every person who was sick in this manner did not all receive it because of a demon attack there are things that we eat and brother branham brought that out there are things that we eat with our hybrid food that cause changes on a cellular and molecular level in our body and so there are times that we will we'll find disease and develop disease and it may or may not be related to the demonic but i want to tell you something if it touches a child of god i don't believe god's doing it if it's touching a child of god i believe there's a spirit life behind it and we can learn by the word of god how to deal with that thing anybody with me now then he said those demons will sometimes manifest in the religious realm spirit realm was the nervousness and the depression and the arrogance the physical realm was the tumor and the cancer and the arthritis and others the religious realm he said spirit of doubt you ever dealt with that spirit unclean spirit anybody ever dealt with an unclean spirit superstition i have to tell people around me all the time there's no such thing as a pair of lucky underwear there's no such thing about hitting more home runs when you got on your lucky socks that is superstitious i don't believe in such as that but demon spirits are limited at how they can manifest in the life of a believer and so they like to do it sometime in a religious realm and tie them up with superstition even unbelief and brother branham even said sin the manifestation of unbelief and sin that sometimes comes out of the life of a believer is a product of a demon operating in the religious realm now i don't want you to get bogged down in those things i want you to always remember that jesus said behold i have given you power help me now i have given you power over all the powers of the enemy then why would we even emphasize or bring some of this out because i am thoroughly convinced that we as believers are living way below our authority level and when we begin to recognize that satan desires to eat us from the inside out and if he can't do it with cancer he'll do it with depression he'll make you such a nervous wreck and fill you with so much anxiety that you can't hardly breathe and he will do anything and everything because his ultimate goal is not just to distract you i want to tell you he came to destroy the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy and that's what he wants to do in your life but if brother branham tells us so many times if that bride when she begins to recognize who she is why is that so powerful because then she understands the authority that she carries i'll read that to you in a little while now let's go back to the choosing of a bride i'm glad i got that out i've been moving that to the end of the notes and i'll do some more you'll see some more interesting things at another time let's go back to paragraph 41. it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour to because you might take on something that you could never shake out of out of it you know there's a time when you can be warned then if you step across that line of warning then you're already marked on the other side branded now this is look this is the master this this prophet of god taught election and predestination like no other he brought the perfect balance between armenianism and calvinism because he brought it from the perspective of the word he believed in the sovereignty of god like no other but i want you to listen to his words to us here it's a dangerous thing to wait till the last hour or two because you might take on something you could never shake out of it you know there's a time when you can be warned then if you step across that line of warning then you're already marked on the other side branded remember when the jubilee year come and the priests rode with this trumpet sounding that every slave could go free listen now but if they refuse oh brother sister don't refuse to be a part of what god is desiring to do for you for you in this hour don't miss out on your chance to bust out look you may not have a demon spirit holding you back you may be living in a comfort zone that's holding you back i'll tell you that's part of the devil's doings too he likes to lull us to sleep doesn't he he likes to put us in a place where we're so comfortable that we don't do anything anymore pull anymore push anymore pray anymore read the bible anymore pray fast and pray anymore that's why brother branham said you've gone as far as you're going to go we have gone as far as we're ever going to go until we pay a greater price and so you can get love into a place of of spiritual lukewarmness that may be the only spirit you need to bust out of but that in itself is enough that you can cry out for for deliverance from your comfort zone he said remember if they refuse to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an awl bore him through the ear and then he served his master always i'm going to say something here and i know there's no holiness people here but i'm going to say this anyway that is one of the reasons why it troubles me to see a woman put a hole in her ear because i know what it represents you say that's easy for you to say look my mother she had holes in her ear one in each ear and that wasn't enough because the spirit of the world was working on her and she just got an idea one day oh i'll tell you her own her own baptist granny my granny her baptist mother who wore clip-ons once a week you know she wouldn't wear a pierced wouldn't have pierced her ear she was a little baptist granny but she wear her clip-ons to church on sunday ironically when my mother come home from work one day late and she had three or four holes in her ear my mama her little baptist mama i'm telling you you you would have thought that she just really sold her soul she said oh jane why would you do that it looks ridiculous and mama said my mother said to her mother said well well mama i just got to looking at everybody else and i thought it looked nice on so and so she called her name and the next thing i thought it might look nice on me you don't think it does and i'll never forget as long as i live her mother said you'll look like a freak but i'm going to love you anyway when i see a woman with her ear a hole in her ear and these ear bobs that they wear and listen here now you see women claiming christianity with them in their noses not just them fly specs that they wear sometimes but bull rings they open their mouth and some old stud it comes out on the tongue i said to a girl not too long ago at culver's i said what in the world would make you want to have that thing like that in your lip don't that bump your teeth and she looked at me and she said you know what it does it about drives me crazy i didn't say it in a hateful way my family if they see me stewing or thinking they just leave me they just go sit down i didn't say that in a hateful way she didn't respond in a hateful way i'm curious that's what possesses somebody to want to identify as a slave do you understand this is a symbol of slavery it always has been and it always will be god's people we don't want to be identified with slavery we don't want to be identified with those that have no will of their own we want to be identified with those who have given everything to jesus christ if you're going to wear a hole in your ear let it be your spiritual here brother branham said and be sold out to him and no one else to hear his voice and no other voice he said if they refused to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an all bore him through the ear and then he served his master always in that culture he could never be free it was a perpetual covenant with a physical sign that he would serve that master the rest of the days of his life let me tell you something you don't want that in the natural and you don't want that in the spiritual let me say to all you young girls you may see it out there on instagram you may see it in the world you may see others that you love of doing things like that and you may think it looks pretty but i want you to know there are spirits behind that there's a bondage that goes along with that and you don't want no part of it come on now and now men who would have ever thought but here we are and it gets worse as the days go by i know it's quiet i know that people are turning me off i'm just been canceled on youtube some folks was watching now they're not probably in facebook i want to tell you something here it's still the truth he said in many times men and women hear god's truth and see it vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason there's some other choosing that they have than to face up to truth and facts therefore their ears can be close to the gospel let me tell you something don't turn a deaf ear and turn a deaf ear and turn a deaf ear and turn a deaf ear until your ears become hardened and you can hear the truth that god sends to set you free sometimes you have to look above the messenger you have to look above the vessel and you have to recognize that god will use anybody to speak to us because he loves us so sometimes you've got to look beyond the package some of the truest words of prophecy that have ever been spoken over my life were spoken over me by people that do not have this message as their standard but i knew that god was using them somehow to speak to me and i had to get me and my opinion out of the way to be able to recognize that god will use anybody that says yes in fact brother sister he'll use you if you'll say yes more he'll use us more if we surrender more if we volunteer more if we're willing more how many of you believe he will he will so he goes on therefore their ears can be close to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you oh wear this on a t-shirt put this on your bumper sticker keep this in front of you write yourself a note like this and put it on your computer i have notes on my computer i took some down when i changed my office around i want to get some out and put them back up one that i have that i don't always obey but i have it there to condemn me when i don't eat the frog early brother robert you ought to put that one on yours eat the frog early he ain't going nowhere that thing that you do not enjoy doing in the course of your day i'll do that after lunch i'll do that after snack i'll do that after coffee time i'll do that after come on now so i have tried and i have succeeded two out of five days to get in there and eat the frog early so that it don't hang over you how many of you ever have something hanging over you oh i don't want to do that i don't want to do that i don't want to do that put you one on your computer that says my advice to you when god speaks to your heart you act next service after thanksgiving when god speaks to your heart you act right then because god is looking for obedience if you believe that same amen now ii corinthians chapter 10 we've read this recently i want to read it again this is part of the hodgepodge i want to ask you this morning are you out of your mind and i want to tell you that if you're not out of your mind you're no good to the kingdom of god until you're out of your mind they say we're crazy they say we've lost our mind but they really falsely accuse us because too many of us are still in our mind i want to be in a place where when they say it it's really true that i'm out of my mind and i'm operating in another mind in another will in another way all together second corinthians 10 verse four through six are you with me this morning for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds what are you reading right now [Music] what are you talking about you called it a hodgepodge what is this this is spiritual warfare you don't see any black clothed figures in this verse you don't see any demons with pitchforks in this verse but this is spiritual warfare this is the battle that is raging this describes what we're facing what we're fighting what we're struggling to overcome in this hour for the weapons of our warfare not carnal but mighty through god to the to the pulling down of strongholds demons spirits love to build paradigms and holes in our life because once we have a paradigm or a stronghold in our life it takes great conscious effort to see that thing brought down it doesn't just fall because you have wished it to be so there's only one way to get it down and that is for you to take a hold of the power of god and use his grace to pull that thing down nobody can pull down your strongholds but you nobody can change your paradigms but you nobody can kill death structures in your life but you you're the one that has the authority to do that if anybody tries to do that for you it's witchcraft [Music] it's manipulation and control so for me to try to pull that down in your life would be illegal spiritually you are the only one a parent can't do it for their child they can certainly teach them the truth and show them the truth and pray for them in the truth but they cannot control the mind of a child or a teenager or an early tween they cannot control their mind but we can teach them how and set an example in front of them of how we destroy strongholds how we re redo recreate renew every thought in our mind until our paradigms are changed i want you to know that jesus wants to change every negative paradigm in your mind he wants to give you strength to pull down every stronghold and to destroy every death structure that the enemy tries to build up in our thoughts because that's where the battle is didn't we cover this yes for two years we covered it and guess what this morning we're back there we're back there why because we're still in the war because we're still in the battle casting down imaginations every one of these phrases speaks of effort and energy spent down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity taking prisoner every thought to thee read it for me to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now that word warfare there as we have taught before it means campaign in the greek it's the word for campaign and we don't mean i don't think this means a political campaign this means a a military campaign so the scripture that the apostle the the word excuse me that the apostle is using here in verse 4 to describe the battle he calls it a warfare 10 and 4. this warfare means a campaign paul was not simply talking about a little skirmish that was going on at the church in corinth but he was talking about the attack of the enemy and how it was part of a much larger attack or campaign of satan against that little church in corinth and i want you to know the powers of hell are still trying to destroy the work of god i want to hear hear you the same devils that tried to destroy the work of god in corinth are alive and well today and they would like to destroy the work of god in this place and in every other place where the truth is upheld we're not giving any space to the enemy in this hour it's important that we don't yield any ground to him so he said the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they're not fleshy but they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds that word strong means of arguments it doesn't mean this it doesn't mean the physical muscle and strength of the body it means arguments and reasonings by which a disputant endeavors to fortify his opinion and defend it against his opponent it is the same word that's used for a castle or a stronghold or a fortress how many of you know we can use words we can use thoughts phrases and feelings to build a castle a fortress in our mind that defends us in such a manner that we hide behind the castle of our own thoughts we hide behind the fortress of our own imaginations the problem is it neither protects us from the enemy what it actually does is it keeps us from yielding ourselves to the holy spirit so it not only fails in its ability to keep us from the hand of the enemy it actually strengthens his ability to keep putting his finger on things in our life but it also blocks us from following the general leadership of the holy spirit so every one of those strongholds arguments and reasonings by which a disputant endeavors to fortify his opinion and defend it against his opponent every one of those things has to be dealt with individually and it has to be done by the spirit because it's not a physical battle if you understand that say amen what's the weapon you know what the weapon is it's the word what is the weapon we used to to win every time the word and how many of you know we're not just talking about the quoting of words we're talking about a life connected to that word in faith you connect yourself to the word of god with your faith then you use that word and when you use that word because you are connected to that word in faith the enemy has no choice he has no choice but to obey that word did you know he has to obey the word he has to and so we could go through some of these words but i don't want to do that now because i've done that many times before but those were the ones i wanted to get in stay with me i want to read these verses in the amplified just a moment and i've given them to them so i think we can do it i want you to look at them carefully just a moment three through five in the amplified for though we walk live in the flesh we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons if you know that's the truth say amen i'm i'm having to pull for my amens for the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but they are mighty before god for the overthrow and destruction the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but mighty before god for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds that's powerful inasmuch as we refute some translations say destroy arguments and theories and reasonings some translations say lofty opinions and every proud and lofty thing that sets up that sets itself up against the true knowledge of god and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of christ the messiah the anointed one how many of you get a picture when i read that i get a picture of what's going on now i want to read it in the complete jewish bible for although we do live in the world we do not wage war in a worldly way because the weapons we use to wage war are not worldly on the contrary i like this they have god's power for demolishing strongholds we demolish arguments and every arrogance that raises itself up against the knowledge of god we take every thought captive and make it obey the messiah how many of you believe if the bible said it we can do it not in our own strength not with our own wit but by the help and the grace of god and if we don't do it the alternative is we are bound we are bound we have not chosen freedom we have chosen to remain within a fortress of our own building i'm so thankful i'm so thankful now i want to just go back to verse 4 for just a moment i wanted to get these other uh translations in i want to go back to verse 4 for just a moment and i want to read it in the new american standard and i don't usually go to all the different ones i love the amplified i enjoy the complete jewish bible but sometimes there are certain verses that the new american standard actually does a very good job some few verses does a very good job in pulling from the original and this is one of those one of those verses the new american standard says for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses hallelujah every castle every fortress that the enemy desires to build in our mind through thoughts and lies we have been given power we have been given authority and yet if i were to ask you in this room how many of us are winning the battle of the vine i want you to know there'd be very few of us that would would boldly say i am winning the battle of the mine and that is because we think that winning is never having to fight again that's not winning winning is getting the victory and maintaining the victory until the very end so you're going to deal with those thoughts and you're going to deal with the attacks of the enemy and you're going to take god at his word pull down castles and fortresses and strongholds and paradigms and death structures you're going to pull them down each and every time and the enemy is going to come in and he's going to try to put it back together and what are you going to do you're going to say hey i recognize that i've already dealt with that by the word now i'm not going to wait till you get so high i'm going when you start laying one brick on another in the foundation of building that thing up in me again i'm going after that somebody said you know when you preach this every time there's no way possibly that anybody could have the time to do that on a regular basis well let me tell you something i have discovered it this is powerful the less you live in social media the less battles you'll fight in the mind you can say amen oh me you can say you ha you love social media you have church website we do we do all that we have church yes absolutely we're in touch with people all over the world i find that that keeps me more and more busy i'm more and more busy with inboxes and answering emails especially since we've opened the streaming of our services it keeps me very very busy and a lot less time to read what other people are posting and see what other people are eating and what other people are doing come on now and what i find by that is i have nothing to compare my life to i don't have to i don't have to worry about what somebody it doesn't bother me i don't have to worry when people are posting about me and won't call my name because they may or may not be their world may be a whole lot bigger than mine and i may think they're talking about me and they may not even have me in their mind when they post it but guess what if i don't see it i won't have to fight that battle or help me now help me now all things in moderation all things must have a balance i understand that we are not living like nuns sequestered somewhere hiding somewhere from the rest of the world i understand that there's a ministry in being connected i understand that very well but i'm telling you that if you find that a lot of your battle is because of what you're reading there's so much confusion in social media anybody going to help me i'm nearly done with this part there's a lot of confusion in social media there's a lot of stirring that goes on in social media unfortunately it's not just turning people against people it's even turning believers against believers i've seen believers fighting all week i mean really having it out over the verdict in the written house trial it's dividing it's causing there to be more issues of race than there has to be doesn't have to be everything everything in life does not have to be about race it is because people make it that it doesn't have to be that way they read it that way so that's what it's about but it doesn't have to be that way and now we have i mean message believers ministers all kinds of wonderful people who love the truth who believe the truth who are so angry at the verdict who who believe that the justice system has been hijacked and this was nothing in the world but the but the works of the enemy being vindicated and exalted and venerated and i don't know what all the word to use then you've got believers on the other side saying i've got a little hope left in the justice system and i'm so thankful that a message has been sent that a man can defend himself and blah blah blah and on and on and on and i have my opinion too i do i doubt i don't know why but it just so happened that i was able to watch a lot of the trial and i i actually enjoyed it enjoyed the trial i like the way that the law works if it works and so instead of instead of you know playing a crossword puzzle or something in the time that i had off then i i really enjoyed watching and i heard enough of it to to feel like i had a pretty good idea of what really went on and what really happened so i have my opinion too but do you know what if if my opinion is only put out there to divide people more i said what does it really matter what does it really matter you say it doesn't matter these things matter because they get in us we get all stirred up just like people who are just still so convinced that the election is going to be overturned maybe some believers here who have that kind of an idea you're going to be sadly mistaken and disappointed if that's what you're holding on to that america does not exist i need you to know i heard brother branham say this week do not expect it to get better we are nearing the end time it's only going to be worse come on now if you could really see if i could really see what went on behind the scenes we would have no faith in politics if we could see what the old indians saw that the left wing and the right wing are on the same bird he's got a right wing he's got a left it's the same way in our nation there there's no purity there's no godliness in politics god gave us a reprieve we're praying that it could be somehow revived and resurrected in the next election term but for those of people who are wasting their energy on something that they can't see the whole picture and understand that there are times that there are agreements made underneath the table behind the scenes behind the curtain there are agreements that are made in that dark world that we are not privy to come on now and let me just say this this is political i didn't i was certainly trying to pull you away from that not jump right in the middle of it but let me just say this did you ever wonder why your own party you that are republican did you ever wonder why your own party did so very little it was a few attorneys and some high-profile people but did you ever ever wonder why your own party did very little to try to overturn the election i'll tell you the answer because they weren't nearly as disappointed as they wanted you to think they were that's the sad state of affairs there's only one hope and that's for the righteous bride of jesus christ to stand up in this hour push back the darkness to the best of our ability until the last harvest of souls can come in and then brother they can have it they can have it hallelujah because we're looking for something higher than this our hope is not in man our faith is not in politics our hope is in jesus christ our future is in his hands it doesn't matter how wicked they get how did you feel during that 80-something minutes that for the first time in american history we had a woman president this week a lot of people didn't even know it but for the first time in history we had a woman president for 85 minutes or something like that because the authority was signed over to her while our president was having a colonoscopy and was under anesthesia do you know how serious it is for people that already have dementia issues do you know how serious it is for them to go under anesthesia in the first place so for the first time a woman and a woman of color had full presidential authority for a few moments of time including access to the nuclear codes that was reported out of washington aren't you glad god's bigger than politics aren't you glad that if she'd have been what some people thought she was in the beginning she there's no telling what she could have tried to do or what folks would have tried to do but aren't you glad that god's bigger than all of that and we're not putting our hope and trust in any of those things we're just pressing into the kingdom of god believing that god has an answer for this and he's about to call his bride out of here and i'm going in the first load are you still with me so we are destroying the speculations this is new american standard verse 5. we are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of god and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of christ because we don't have time to get involved with everything that's going on out there it eats us up it consumes our thoughts we have to pull away in him how many of you know you've got to pull aside in christ when the storm is raging around you if you find that you can't keep the victory and be on social media get off of it if you can't buy if you find that you can't have the victory and and float around on youtube get rid of it if you find that you've got a tv somewhere and you can't keep the victory get rid of it don't just don't just get rid of the machine and keep all the filth that comes into your phone understand that the enemy has more than one way to get to our mind and we somehow have to take authority over whatever we discover is stealing our victory i know some of you aren't with me i'm used to that by now but it's still the truth so this is the biggest portion of spiritual warfare that we are engaged in right now number one write it down to pull down all strong holes in our own mind number two to cast down imaginations number three you're recognizing it already to cast down every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of christ number four to bring every thought into captivity and forcing it to obey christ the truth is that will keep most of us so busy that we will not have time to look for demons under rocks [Music] this kind of spiritual warfare is as vital as any form of spiritual warfare could ever be because this is winning the personal battle against every thought every imagination every stronghold every speculation every accusation that the enemy would raise up against us in this hour now i want to read to you before we close it's early still i want to read to you some notes that i've shared with you in the past that i pulled up today i didn't know i was going to do it when i woke up this morning so i had to pull some up and i want to read you a few notes that we have talked about from the subject of paradigms and a paradigm is like a stronghold it's a thought that you you have over and over and over and over again you entertain it over and over and over again you rehearse it and repeat it in your mind over and over again until it becomes your truth and every time i say it i think about papa paul kane his example and talked about his own insecurities and his own inferiorities and he said i'm so bad that if i go to a football game and they call a huddle he said i'm just sure they're all talking about me it's funny it's a joke but it was his reality i was involved with him closely enough for a short period of time to know that it was a joke that he told to make himself feel better but it was his own reality he really believed if if a day went by that he would send me an email and i wouldn't answer that email the next day i would get an email that would say are you mad with me are you hurt with me are you upset with me have you believed some lie about me i would say no papa paul i don't believe any of that i'm just busy i'll never forget the paranoid that struck me in ghana when the internet went down and i realized that when the internet went back up several days later my inbox would be full of emails from papa paul saying are you all right are you okay are we still friends this was his reality and i don't say that to expose him i say that to let you know that it's the enemy's job to build a paradigm in your mind that will cause you to feel like nobody loves you and everybody is against you and everybody wants to destroy you and everybody talks about you behind your back and they're all having a party and you're not invited he will pull that and pull that and pull that until it becomes your truth and you will be victim you are the victim brother i become the victim to that if i allow the enemy to build it in my head but i become the prisoner so i want to read you a few things i want you to i want to read them slowly you couldn't possibly write them all down but i can get them to you once you accept a thought most of this comes from dr caroline leaf once you accept a thought that thought is placed into your subconscious mind you have only a few seconds when you hear something to make a decision whether you accept that or not if you refuse it if in your mind you say i know that's not the truth and you don't entertain it again within a few seconds that energy represented by that thought literally leaves you have no recording of it it's god's gift it's how god built our brain because he loves us so much if we accept that thought it's placed in our subconscious mind whatever thoughts you choose to accept in your conscious mind must also be accepted in your subconscious mind it has no ability to reject any thoughts we continuously think are planted firmly in the subconscious part of the mind this repetition of thought is called habits or paradigms thoughts we choose with our conscious mind are impressed upon our subconscious mind it moves our body into a state of vibration which creates an action let me read it again thoughts we choose with our conscious mind are impressed upon our subconscious mind moving our body into a state of vibration which creates an action your conscious mind moves through your subconscious mind to cause you to carry out an action as we get older we find ourselves doing things automatically like we always did but not always in the right order only two or three people get it things get a little out of whack and that's why we uh can find our keys in various places i'm afraid to tell you some examples because you all want me to be evaluated you know you you just don't ever know where you're going to find something because you're going through the house to do something you always do something else strikes your mind that you need to do you go do that and then you see see what you what's that there for oh now i'm not saying this is any way connected i'm giving god the glory but i wanted to report that sister megan found her keys this week right let's praise god for that i'm not saying any of that is connected to her i'm just it just came to my mind listen to this that's how we do what we do that's how our body carries out it's through vibration thoughts we choose with our conscious mind are impressed upon our subconscious mind moving our body into a state of vibration which creates an action the actions that are produced create the results that you are getting in your life the important fact is that the belief entered your mind's paradigm it was put into your mind just like data is put into a computer and just like a computer when data is put into our subconscious mind the subconscious takes it as it is it does not have the ability to accept or reject the subconscious part of the mind does not analyze if it's true or not all of that takes place in the conscious mind so if you've got something new you receive it in your subconscious if you don't do something with it if you don't pull it down if you don't submit it to god's word it has the ability of being added to your paradigm as truth never being checked as truth or fiction have you ever wondered how people could believe what they believe have you ever believed have you ever wondered in the last two and a half years how people can believe what they believe did anybody get shocked when you saw how many billions of dollars was given by our government this week to pfizer and will be given also to the rest so that the government can buy hundreds of thousands of doses of the coveted pill now over 30 billion wasn't it over 30 maybe 38 billion dollars in the new bills and whatever else they're passing to buy so many doses of a covered pill does it blow your mind a little bit that now they're going to start distributing a pill that can do what a shot was supposed to be able to do for you are some of you joining the masses of people who say oh now i don't have to have it well i already took it to keep my job how can you get this out of me there's so much confusion around this world and that is because people have gotten to a place where they receive something into the subconscious mind without ever having the ability there to evaluate whether it's truth or not but they keep hearing it it's not that they believed it initially but they read it and they read it and they read it and they see it and they read it and they see it and they hear it and they get threatened and they get fearful and they get told they can't eat at a table they got to sit on the floor and they got to do this and that and the next thing you know they have accepted something that is not necessarily the truth because they kept seeing it the enemy works the same way he keeps flashing a lie about you over and over and over and over again you may know that it's not the truth but if you don't put that thought in its place and you allow the enemy to keep flashing that in front of you it will become your truth it will become a part of your conscious mind it will become a part of your stronghold and your paradigm and it will cheat you out of everything that god has for you in this hour including your overcoming victory and it's just a lie that's been told over and over and over and over and over again until the person begins to believe it everything you see hear smell touch and taste is either accepted or rejected by the conscious mind all the analysis takes place in the conscious mind well it has to get there and if you don't revisit it again it it floats away it goes away so really you have to somehow accept that for it ever to get deep enough for your brain to analyze it and that's why people are so mentally ill in this hour they're absolutely overloaded and burnt out with information without the holy ghost whatever is accepted i'm nearly done with this part whatever is accepted is then turned over to the subconscious mind which is then turned into action through the physical body so it works its way in and it works its way out you have a thought and along with the thought you have some kind of feeling or an emotion about it that thought gets planted into your subconscious along with that feeling which causes your body to feel a certain way resulting in a behavior that is in alignment with whatever you choose for your thoughts we keep thinking these same thoughts and keep getting the same results we end up going around and around and around and around instead of going ahead this is part of that great battlefield that's going on that great battle going on on the battlefield of the mind be careful what you think about because you become what you think about that's what the bible tells us we find that in the scripture i was amazed several years ago when we started studying all the things that brother branham said about the mind and we realized he was trying then to help us not to have to go through some of the things we go through in this hour are you good for a few more paragraphs your programming started before your birth and all of your behaviors are an expression of what's going on inside of you becoming aware is the key to changing your paradigm begin to relate to yourself as a conscious mind a subconscious mind and a body the next time you have a thought pay attention to the feeling that comes with it and the action that you take you will begin to notice things that you hadn't before and it will inspire you to start changing your paradigms one example is you can't eat just one laze that is a truth do you know anybody that goes and takes one laced potato chip out of the bag and then puts the bag away if you want to change the kind of results you have been getting so far throughout your life that stronghold that paradigm has to change repetition will input habits in the nerve cells in your brain this consequently governs your thoughts and behavior repetition now isn't it amazing that we stand back and allow the enemy to utilize the process of repetition to strengthen his hold in our mind and we fail to use the same process to deprogram what he tells us about ourselves it's repetition every time it is written it is written it is written it is written are you with me we have a few more minutes good i know this isn't fiery but it's all i had to bring it's what he led me to the petition of a believer in christ a paragraph 25 this is an interesting place i was going to trim it down and i just couldn't he said i've seen people come to the platform and i'd say do you believe oh i've got all the faith brother branham now i don't mean to be belittling them i respect that but they're supposed to be up here and here they are way down here so we must be must be doing something with his hands but do you know what it is it's hope instead of faith here's somebody comes to be prayed for and you say do you have the faith to believe oh yes i've got the faith to believe brother braham said they're supposed to be up here but they're down here why because he said it's hope instead of faith let's read on faith does the job win right now hope hopes for it but faith is the product hallelujah anybody get it faith really does it see we have lots of hope but not much faith so we want to change from hope today to positive faith we're moving out of hope so to know so and we do that by moving into positive faith he tells us how to do it there's only one way we can get positive faith that's why you read it it matters what you think i'm not trying to be a mind over matter because that's actually a very strange concept and that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about faith over circumstances we're talking about moving from i hope so to a positive faith that says i know so and brother adam tells us we make that transition by positive thinking on positive things and i would say repeatedly because repetition as we have said many times is part of the key he said now for instance i was going to trim some of this out but i i couldn't i just couldn't he said now for instance what if some of you women today went home or tomorrow i wouldn't think you'd want to do it today but tomorrow you go out you go and plug up your device your electric iron to do your ironing and there's no current so let everybody know that brother bradham is giving you permission not to iron on sunday that would cause a major catastrophe at our house on sunday morning but he'd say i wouldn't think you'd want to go home today and and plug it but tomorrow you go and plug in your electric iron to do your ironing and there's no current what does it mean by current there's no electricity there's no power so he goes on now let's read on why would you throw why he's saying why why would you why would you throw your why would you throw up your hands and say alas and to lack there's no such thing as electricity well certainly not he said you've got your wires crossed up somewhere there's plenty of electricity you just haven't got it connected right i want you to hear that it's so simple you can't miss it unless you just choose to miss it you've got your wires crossed up somewhere it's not that you don't have electricity you just don't have it connected you haven't got it connected right is that right he said and we go on when this one was prayed and why why didn't you get healed and there's no such a thing as divine healing that's just as senseless as the other is surely others are getting healed why can't you see it's the wires breaks down it's not the fact that there's not power to heal there's plenty of power to heal something is not working right in the connection so he goes on let's read look that electricity the whole world is full of electricity did you know that you could go to new york city and pick up a copper wire and go to los angeles with a copper wire take a helicopter and fly it five miles high in the air and drop that copper wire and pick up enough electricity set the earth of fire with the current that's how much electricity there is in the earth sure now he goes on now if only the whole world was full of electricity and you're setting out in the middle of a big dark field at night time and you can't see where you're going and you're hollering oh electricity oh electricity come make a light for me is that too silly for you can you get it come make a light for me i know you can light but come make a light for me electricity i know you can get out of this dark place i know that you're here electricity science proves that you're here come make a light now you're just wasting your breath that's all now i know it's silly but see yourself sitting out in the middle of a field the air the atmosphere charged with electrical current and you're sitting there thinking now come electricity and make me a light you don't have the copper wire you don't have the lamp you don't have the light bulb you don't have the plug but you know electricity is real so you're sitting science has proven it and so forth and etc you're just wasting your breath that's all now let's read on he said now if that electricity will light up if you will get the electricity in the right flow of its category it'll light up if you put it in its right position there are some other things needed to be able to make connection with that electricity all right he goes on now the whole room here the whole earth the whole room here is full of the power of god same way enough to make this voice sitting here in the wheelchair walk make this woman walk make this lady in the stretcher walk make all these people along here walk make the blind see but the first thing you have to do is get that holy spirit flowing in the right category do you believe it's here isn't that powerful it's the same way you've got to make the connection the power of god can be flowing through this room as he has been in such a special way lately and you can sit there without any touch at all it doesn't mean that he's not here i know people that go out of a service like that where they have made no effort and they say oh just a bunch of just a bunch of emotion just a bunch of hocus pocus just a bunch of oh no no the room was full of electricity and you were thinking that maybe it would just come and make you a light but it didn't just come and make you a light because there's a way to make connection with electricity you didn't have the copper wire you didn't have the plug you didn't have what was necessary you didn't utilize what you know so the power of god can fill this room but in order for you to be a partaker and a participant and a recipient of that power you've got to get it flowing in the right category which means you've got to take it as it is and understand that faith is what makes the connection and he said well how do we get that faith by by by moving from hope to positive faith how do we move from hope to positive faith by by thinking positive thoughts it's a choice are you here in a message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 34 lay your hands on the baby some christian believer come lay your hands on the young man sitting there that's crippled will you all right now let's everyone bow our heads reverently real reverent i want you to repeat this prayer now you heard what brother branham just did he's setting setting something up he said i want you to think this in your mind now real reverend is that mind control is brother branham trying to use mind control neither is the preacher when he's telling you to only believe he said i want you to think this in your mind now real reverent i want you to repeat this in prayer you pray it now watch this he said i'll repeat it you pray it i'll just transfer the words i'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat satan right to your lips it's powerful i know what you're thinking you're thinking that the most glorious powerful prayer you have ever heard in your life is about to follow and it is so powerful that every person in the room is healed and every demon has to go and so forth and it's going to be so beautiful that it could almost be included in a book of poetry but none of that is what this is about he said i'll just transfer the words that it takes to defeat satan right to your lips and then you believe your confession i'm just going to teach you how to pray and then you believe what you've what you've confessed you believe what you prayed not mind control not trying to put words in people's mouth he's trying to show you the simplicity it's not the words you say it's whether you believe them or not he said now now now you that's sick repeat this with me almighty god creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life giver of all good gifts i your servant confess my sins and i believe that through the merits of thy son jesus i am forgiven of my sins i am sick in body [Music] i need your help give me faith just now to believe your word and to believe these things which i have never seen tonight that reproduces your life again as it was yesterday and so is it today and now lord upon this confession i accept my healing and i believe from this night henceforth i shall be well i commit myself to you in the name of jesus christ period it's not how grandiose the words are how beautiful the structure is it's whether or not you can believe what you say it's whether you can really believe what you confess and brother branham said i know there are people here in his mind he's thinking i know there are people here that don't even know how to put a little prayer together like that so i'm going to give them just a little example he was doing that under inspiration wasn't premeditated i'm going to give them a little example of what to say in fact i'm going to transfer to them the words they need to defeat satan well i don't hear him say anything in there now satan come out now satan you go to town you go back to hell where you come from he doesn't even address satan he didn't find it necessary to teach the people how to talk to the devil he found out if i can just teach them how to talk to god and how to believe what they say [Music] then satan has no choice but to go you didn't even have to tell him to go he'll never hang around where somebody is believing and confessing and utilizing god's word like that from this day forward i'm committing myself now brother shelley it couldn't possibly be that simple he thought it was paragraph 19 of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but this time in tucson that was in tallahassee we're nearly done he said did you ever see people you love to be around just love to be around them because they create an atmosphere because they uh a heavenly and you like to be around them others seem to be good people but you just i i have to get away once in a while that you know what i mean it's very quiet in here but you know what he means and yet they seem to be good people it's not creative i could try to replace that word he could have meant conducive he could have meant a lot of things but he chose the word creative was it a mistake i don't think so because when i look at this paragraph carefully it's all about atmosphere an atmosphere can be destructive there can be an there can be an atmosphere conducive to tear down and destroy there can be an atmosphere that's conducive for building up and being and creating we know that the power of the spoken word when you can speak it and believe what you say it is creative isn't it so i don't think brother branham was using the wrong word he's just explaining that you can be with certain people and there's a creative atmosphere that can be that can be developed in being with them all good people there are other people good people but when you're with them you just really would like to be away from them because they put off now today we might call it a vibe we might call it all kinds of things but the truth is the atmosphere is not right because the focus is not right and because sometimes as i have said many times before people find their identity in their suffering so if they can't explain their suffering to you if they can't talk all the time about what they're going through they have nothing to say and there's not a lot of faith that is produced in that kind of an atmosphere so i had almost rather be with people sometime who speak nothing about the lord than to be around people who speak of the lord but in such a negative way there is no created faith come on i'm just telling you like it like it is it's not creative now watch what he says next and man was made to be a god he said we know that genesis 1 26 he had dominion over the whole earth and he was made to be an amateur god and now when he receives god he becomes a son of god again now listen before we go on just a minute god is a creator so he goes from speaking about creative to immediately speaking about how man was created to be a lesser or an amateur god in other places brother branham said and therefore a creator we are creators we do have some power to create because we're in him all right let's let's read on he was made man in the image of god god had hands god had feet and so therefore a man was made like him so he is an amateur god but sin has blinded every fiber in his body in his mind in his heart but now don't never try to study it out you cannot figure it out powerful isn't it you cannot figure it out in the garden of eden satan chose his part of the man his head his intellectuals god took his heart satan has access as long as you are in your head as long as you are in your head as long as you are in your mind satan has chosen your mind he has chosen your heart as his part god has allowed the enemy to have access to that part of who you are that's why the battle is raging what i just said was clearly outlined in the greatest battle ever fought just go hear it again it's there that's exactly what he was telling us god has allowed the enemy to have access to man and it is through his head it is through his mind god chose his heart the intellectuals will reason he said well well i'm this way i'm that way you'll never get anywhere with god there let's read on just a bit but your heart your faith will make you believe things your faith will make you believe things at your heart excuse me your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about that's why you've got to think with your heart which is his mind [Applause] and not your head which is satan's access you you your your faith will make you believe things that your mind knows nothing about you cast down reasoning see you must be positive and you stay there until you are positive then when you're positive there's nothing can turn you does anybody believe that to be the truth and and get what's the title of the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever his favorite scripture a message that he preaches over and over again just about everywhere he goes he uses that theme because this is one of the ways that we can understand that jesus remains the same the enemy has access to our thoughts as long as we stay in our head but when we take on another head when we take on another mind when we take on the mind of christ the access that the enemy has is to be closed so if he continues to access our mind it's because we are vacillating between heart and head we are going back and forth between my head his head my mind his mind my head his heart back and forth moving back and forth we have we've got to get victory over that i'm getting victory i'm going to have victory over that i see victory as promised to me in this and i'm going to take a hold of him you'll never get anywhere now he goes on bless your heart your faith will make you believe things your mind knows nothing about you cast down reasoning see you must be positive you stay there until you're positive then when you're positive there's nothing can turn you give me this verse of scripture musicians are coming first corinthians 2 16. ah for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have i gave you this from this morning this was there we go that was from this morning for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ me philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus philippians 2 5 and now give me god commissioning moses paragraph 6 and i'm done i don't know why i wore myself out i haven't preached very hard but i've been pulling me and you both and when a man becomes born again of the spirit of god let me ask you again how many of you are born again how many of you on the stream are born again if you're born again put your hand up i'm born again i'm born from above i'm born of the spirit i didn't ask you how you feel i ask you where your faith is have you asked him have you repented have you been baptized in his name have you received the holy spirit of god then you're born again he said when a man becomes born again of the spirit of god he becomes an offspring or a son of god and then he has the same type of mind that god does don't you dare tell me that satan has access to the mind of god only a prophet had access to the mind of god now a generation of believers have access to the mind of god how is that so because somebody went before us because we had a forerunner don't tell me that satan has access to the mind of god he may have access to my head to my mind but he doesn't have access to his mind so have you lost your mind because if he's still accessing your mind you are not out of your mind you're living in your mind true scripture says we have the mind of christ let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus he said now and then he has the same type of mind that god does the mind that was in christ is in us and we believe are you going to let me read the rest thank you and we believe for the unseen for the miraculous in just anything and then we have the holy spirit who bring comes to us and speaks to us concerning these things and the whole purpose of these meetings listen to what the purpose of these meetings are the whole purpose of these meetings dear christian friend it's for no other purpose before god but that your faith in god might be stimulated to a place that you believe him for the salvation of your soul and for the healing of your body all of this all of this you see he said is to get you to put your faith in the right place so your soul can be saved and your body can be healed my that's a that's a great summary of a powerful ministry isn't it good i'm going to read one more i wasn't but i am fundamental foundation of faith paragraph 14. now if we could throw ourselves completely to god and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of christ being us the one that satan has no access to when we see him coming when we hear his thoughts when we realize he's trying to get in our head we have to make a conscious decision and we have to do it immediately we have to put him in his place we have to flip the switch we have to say oh no i can't stay in my head i got to move up into his isn't that what brother branham said just a moment ago when he said you're here you need to be up here there it is that's it you're down here just thinking like an ordinary human being you're going to have to come up here and think like who you were created to be which is an amateur god let me tell you something an amateur god is not somebody that sits down and rings their hands and says i'm stuck with my life this is all i have i i this is terrible this is awful this is painful and it may be but an amateur god cannot waste any time anybody with me in that kind of desperation and despondency you got to get up above that now what would an amateur god do an amateur god would create i don't know why everybody's so quiet i mean i'm doing all the things you're supposed to do when you preach a message i'm putting the word amateur in there so everybody can hear it because sometimes he didn't sometimes he didn't but i'm trying to do all that so nobody gets throwed off but if you were created to be an amateur god it means you have been given some authority and power to create that's why you've got to be around people who can help you have an atmosphere to create to be creative you can't live your life around negative nancy pulled down constantly all the time somebody said you want us just to forsake people like that no we want you to pull away get filled with the holy ghost and then go back and try to rescue them we want you to get so full of god get out from under that influence get so full of god get so much power get so much authority and then go back into the house of hell go back into those bars you ought to listen to your pastor then go do something with those bars brother david gossman then we have to do something with those bars brother branham was told something had to be done he sees these people being held captive good people that he knew he looks down at his little scrawny arms am i going to do anything how am i going to do anything that's how we get sometime oh but it wasn't those little arms that was going to pull those bars out of the way and set somebody free it was going to be it was going to be someone who learned to exercise the authority that was given to him by god once you learn how to experience that authority and how to manifest what god is calling you to do don't you forget those people that are still caught behind those bars you go take some authority to them and help create an atmosphere around them so that they can pull themselves up just like you had to pull yourself up but don't sacrifice your soul hear what i'm saying today don't you allow that spirit to be strengthened on you until you can't get it off of yourself come and see what god will do i hope your silence means you're listening we could just throw ourselves completely to god into his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of christ be in us them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as the natural things does just the same thing because we were created we were first created for that purpose we were first created for that purpose to control to rule to praise god and to live for god [Music] now jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and shall be given unto you if you abide in me and my word about in you he said now the father in his word is inseparable because the word is his son in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god and his word is inseparable you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word you have god paragraph 19 same message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but this time campbellsville kentucky i'm skipping all the way down to the last paragraph the one that would be in yellow let the mind that was in christ jesus be in you and then when you begin to think his thoughts you'll begin to live his life and do the things that he did see what i mean now because it's not you that stan it's not you are you out of your mind it's not you it's christ any good to us let's just worship him there's some that want to be prayed for this morning i want to do that hallelujah will you just worship the lord without any music for just a moment but you just worship the lord thank him that he gives us victory thank him that he makes a way hallelujah thank you that he is offering us a mind that satan has no access to oh my i've got to have that i've got to operate in that i've got to come up to where i'm called to be i've got to get out of my own head lord i've got to take you at your word you have said that we have that mind of christ and lord i do not believe that satan has access to the mind of christ so if i'm still letting you talk i've got to take some authority over my own own vessel here over my own body over my own life we want to see an atmosphere that is creative produced in this last hour where anybody who needs deliverance can be delivered where anybody who needs to get rid of demons can get rid of demons because of your wonderful spirit your wonderful anointing hallelujah hallelujah we want to see total and complete resurrection because we believe this is promised to the believer by the power of the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah think of something to lead us in for worship just
