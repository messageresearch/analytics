[0:00] you can have victory again
[0:02] [Music]
[0:08] we need to be like Samson and say Oh
[0:12] Lord
[0:13] one more time one more time I am
[0:18] throwing myself on the rock one more
[0:20] time I am coming to the rock of my
[0:23] salvation one more time I am saying I
[0:27] had victory then and I'm going to have
[0:29] victory now victory belongs to me it is
[0:33] what you paid for at Calvary and I am
[0:36] standing here today saying victory
[0:39] belongs to me and I don't care what
[0:43] happened in that span of five years ten
[0:46] years twenty years it doesn't matter to
[0:49] me what happened in that span it doesn't
[0:52] even matter what look like defeat time
[0:55] or on a one time or another
[0:56] it doesn't matter there has been a time
[0:59] where God has given me a victory over
[1:02] whatever I may be facing today I can't
[1:08] get into your head and find out what
[1:11] that problem is what that that you're
[1:14] feeling defeated from today that you
[1:16] felt like you had victory over some time
[1:18] ago but I am here to tell you as I
[1:22] proclaim the Gospel message today that
[1:24] that was a victory it was a victory and
[1:28] what you need to do is take that victory
[1:31] and put it right in the face of the
[1:34] devil and say see the rock of my
[1:37] salvation gave me victory over you once
[1:40] already
[1:40] he gave me victory over you twice three
[1:44] times four times and I'm coming back to
[1:47] my rock the Lord Jesus Christ again to
[1:50] tell you Satan that I still have the
[1:53] victory because the victory lives in
[1:56] side of me we have allowed the enemy to
[2:00] poke our eyes out we have allowed him to
[2:05] steal our vision we have allowed him to
[2:12] steal our spiritual vision then and make
[2:17] us think that we have never had a
[2:20] victory but I'm decreed the word of the
[2:23] Lord to you today you had a victory or
[2:29] two or three or four and no matter how
[2:34] you feel today and no matter how much
[2:37] lack of vision you feel like you have
[2:40] this moment I am here to tell you today
[2:43] the word of the Lord to you today is you
[2:47] can have victory again same enemy
[2:53] another victory
