[43:38] will you give me pause just to read a
[43:41] scripture to you from Isaiah chapter
[43:44] 40 verse
[43:47] 25 to whom then will you liken me or
[43:51] shall I be equal saith the Holy One lift
[43:56] up your eyes on high and behold who hath
[44:00] created these things that bringeth out
[44:04] the host by their number he calleth them
[44:07] all by names by the greatness of his
[44:10] might for he is strong in power not one
[44:16] falleth or faileth not one faileth as I
[44:20] was reading this scripture last night
[44:22] all of the sudden my mind went to the
[44:25] stars in the heavens he is the one who
[44:28] put them all in their place and gave
[44:31] them names and it says not one of them
[44:33] fails to shine their light and then I
[44:36] got to thinking about us
[44:40] lightbearers and we are a word sent from
[44:43] God and we will not return to him void
[44:46] and we have been sent here to shine
[44:49] light and as the stars of the heaven do
[44:52] not fail to give their light so I as one
[44:56] who has been set in the earth will not
[44:59] fail to give my light let's worship
[45:02] together as brother Cade comes to sing
[45:05] today

[52:29] blood really really thankful for the
[52:33] blood and had it not been for
[52:37] Grace to get the blood to
[52:40] you this is why we hear the prophet
[52:43] saying sometime we're not saved by the
[52:46] blood but by Grace it's because there
[52:48] had to be an Avenue a vehicle to deliver
[52:51] the blood to your house to your life and
[52:55] that was the grace of God God salvation
[52:58] is not of Works lest any man should
[53:00] boast but it is the gift of God it's not
[53:04] based on
[53:07] obedience it's not based on
[53:10] Behavior it's based on his
[53:13] grace when you've been transformed by
[53:16] his grace then you want to behave like a
[53:19] Christian that's right like a child of
[53:21] God but you're going to
[53:23] fail and when you do you don't become
[53:27] unsaved aren't you glad of
[53:29] that praise God I I would have made a
[53:32] good
[53:34] Baptist because I've got enough uh
[53:37] Revelation from the word to know that
[53:39] he's not saving and unsaving and saving
[53:42] and
[53:43] unsaving our fellowship may change but
[53:47] our relationship with him Remains the
[53:50] Same if you believe that say Amen am uh
[53:53] we could just give all of these
[53:55] musicians a wonderful thank you for all
[53:58] that they do for
[53:59] [Applause]
[54:03] us please don't take this as a
[54:06] correction in any way but we'd like for
[54:08] you to join us as soon as you possibly
[54:11] can in the sanctuary this morning
[54:13] because I need you to help me I need you
[54:16] to pull on on the gift this morning I I
[54:20] really need his help I appreciate um
[54:24] every sacrifice
[54:26] that anybody makes to be in the house of
[54:29] the Lord I really do and I know that
[54:32] when you're out of town and you're
[54:34] enjoying your few minutes away it's hard
[54:38] sometime to to make your way back for a
[54:41] Sunday service where you know the pastor
[54:43] is going to preach two hours and and etc
[54:46] etc etc but I really do appreciate every
[54:50] sacrifice that these musicians make I
[54:52] don't always mention it but many times
[54:55] they uh cut a trip short or something
[54:58] just so that they can be with us and I
[55:00] appreciate that uh Kate had a little
[55:02] Hunting Expedition this week and and
[55:05] drove all the way home yesterday to be
[55:07] here I appreciate that I've seen all of
[55:08] them do it uh uh Josh has made big
[55:12] sacrifices and and Ben and Zach well all
[55:15] of them but I just appreciate
[55:17] it I want you to open your Bible today
[55:22] to uh I'm going to start in in John on
[55:27] I'm a little bit
[55:30] discombobulated and it's the it's the
[55:32] Lord's doing so we just have to trust
[55:35] him if if life discombobulates you well
[55:39] then that's one thing but if if God is
[55:41] the one rearranging things well then you
[55:44] just have to trust him right some of you
[55:47] aren't here in the right frame of mind
[55:50] but I want you to know I love you and
[55:53] I'm glad that you're here I wish wish
[55:56] that when you came you could come in the
[55:59] right frame of mind because we come to
[56:01] meet
[56:02] him but but I want you to know that I'd
[56:05] rather have you here all
[56:07] twisted than not to have you here at all
[56:11] and I'm going to believe that there's
[56:13] enough of us here who are uh uh pushing
[56:17] through and keeping our head above the
[56:19] water that we will pull you up a little
[56:22] bit today and I'm asking you sincerely
[56:26] to pull upon the gift of God this
[56:28] morning that he might speak to you
[56:30] because he has given me a word for this
[56:33] body and it's not necessarily going to
[56:36] be an easy word to deliver because it
[56:38] gets kind of to the nitty gritty it's
[56:42] not what I planned or prepared but for
[56:46] the third or fourth time in the last
[56:48] five or six weeks the Lord has dealt
[56:51] with me in the night on Saturday night
[56:53] and I wake up on Sunday morning and and
[56:57] and have nothing prepared for for what
[57:00] he's talking to me about and you'd think
[57:02] that as long as I've been preaching in
[57:04] as many notes as I have I could just go
[57:06] pull notes about any subject you know
[57:09] but it doesn't always work that way I
[57:11] know this is a word of the Lord to this
[57:13] house I know that only about 30% of you
[57:16] are prepared to hear it but I'm going to
[57:19] ask that the Lord prepare your
[57:22] heart uh for it because we're in a we're
[57:25] in a place I I sense it you do too we're
[57:29] in a place where we can't go on like we
[57:34] are that's not a bad thing we can't go
[57:38] on where we are we we we can't go on
[57:41] unless we're willing to pay a greater
[57:44] price brother brandom said you've gone
[57:46] as far with God as you're ever going to
[57:47] go until you're willing to pay a greater
[57:50] price and we know where the battle
[57:54] Lies come on now I know you're standing
[57:57] we know where the battle lies it lies up
[58:00] here and we're going to have to be a
[58:02] people who spew
[58:04] something besides doubt and fear and
[58:07] unbelief we're going to have to speak
[58:09] words of life into one another in this
[58:12] hour and we're going to have to consider
[58:14] that maybe in the moment we are only
[58:17] focusing on what we're going through but
[58:19] there's somebody that's going through
[58:22] something similar or even maybe a little
[58:24] bit darker and maybe they need somebody
[58:27] to talk to
[58:29] too I've always wanted to say a multiple
[58:33] times I've wanted to say to people that
[58:35] you know even preachers are people
[58:38] too even pastors are people too I I know
[58:42] that you know that by all my mistakes
[58:45] but I don't think you always know that
[58:47] when there's a trial but I want you to
[58:50] know that I I am depending on him he
[58:54] told me years ago he spoke clearly to me
[58:57] that he was my father and he is a father
[59:01] to the fatherless and a mother to the
[59:03] motherless that's who he is and uh when
[59:07] he spoke that to me I just screamed out
[59:09] I have no father but God and it loosed
[59:12] me from something that I'd been carrying
[59:14] for a long long time when God says I'll
[59:17] be your father I'll be your papa then
[59:20] then you you just lose all expectations
[59:22] to find that need met in the earth he
[59:25] meets from above isn't that right so
[59:29] let's turn to John I don't want you to
[59:31] be
[59:32] nervous I I I I'm not going to whip you
[59:35] much but but but I just am I'm just in a
[59:39] place where I I sent my notes and I said
[59:42] to charity I'm sending all this stuff
[59:45] it's not in order but I was able to at
[59:48] least get it on paper twice my notes and
[59:50] the projector notes and uh so they're
[59:53] going to have to pull around to try to
[59:55] find it all
[59:56] for instance I was supposed to start
[59:59] with Psalm but I'm going to start in
[1:00:01] John so uh pray an anointing on whoever
[1:00:04] runs the projector during the entirety
[1:00:06] of the service John 2 and verse
[1:00:11] 13 and the Jews Passover was at hand and
[1:00:17] Jesus went up to
[1:00:20] Jerusalem and found in the temple those
[1:00:24] that sold oxen and sheep and doves and
[1:00:28] the Changers of money sitting and when
[1:00:33] he had made a scorge of small cords he
[1:00:38] drove them all out of the temple that's
[1:00:43] a whip and the sheep and The Oxen and
[1:00:48] poured out the Changers money and
[1:00:53] overthrew the tables I want you to know
[1:00:57] that these animals were not in the Holy
[1:01:00] place they were not in the inner
[1:01:02] chambers of the temple they were in the
[1:01:05] outer porches of the temple and it was
[1:01:08] not so unusual for them to be there on
[1:01:12] every Pilgrim Feast but they were
[1:01:15] getting closer and closer to that which
[1:01:18] is
[1:01:19] holy they were growing they were
[1:01:22] multiplying uh there were probably
[1:01:25] entrepreneurs who had had branched out
[1:01:28] and who had uh franchised their stands
[1:01:32] and instead of one location they had 10
[1:01:34] or 15 and they were getting closer and
[1:01:38] closer to that which is holy and sacred
[1:01:42] with their
[1:01:43] exchanging and this was remember I want
[1:01:47] you to get this it was a service that
[1:01:50] was offered to the worshipper so that
[1:01:53] they didn't have to bring a sheep from
[1:01:54] the north or or bring a a flock of birds
[1:01:58] in a cage from the south they could
[1:02:00] bring their money they could come to
[1:02:03] Jerusalem because no one could come into
[1:02:05] the temple Compound on a feast day with
[1:02:09] empty hands he had to bring an offering
[1:02:12] and so they would buy the offering on
[1:02:15] location but this particular time they
[1:02:19] were again encroaching on sacred ground
[1:02:23] Jesus walks in and he sees them and he
[1:02:27] realizes that they're not only uh
[1:02:29] selling but they are they are taking
[1:02:33] advantage they're price
[1:02:37] gouging you know that really Burns me up
[1:02:41] when there's a hurricane and the hotels
[1:02:44] double and triple in prices you you
[1:02:46] ought to be cutting them in half to help
[1:02:49] people not gouge them but it's the
[1:02:52] ambition that that uh uh unregenerate
[1:02:56] ated men have to to gain even at someone
[1:03:00] else's expense so Jesus dealt with it he
[1:03:03] drove out uh he didn't say come get your
[1:03:06] sheep uh make sure you you you owners of
[1:03:10] The Oxen come and get them he just
[1:03:12] started driving them out it was going to
[1:03:14] be up to them to find their animals and
[1:03:17] he poured out the Changers money he
[1:03:19] didn't want the money he didn't need the
[1:03:21] money and he overthrew their tables I
[1:03:25] like the way the chosen has sort of
[1:03:28] dramatized that in our minds I can kind
[1:03:31] of see it playing out as I read he said
[1:03:34] unto them that sold doves take these
[1:03:38] things hint make not my father's house
[1:03:43] an House of
[1:03:45] merchandise and his disciples remembered
[1:03:49] that it was written the Zeal listen to
[1:03:53] this carefully it's the title of my
[1:03:56] message this morning the Zeal of thine
[1:04:00] house hath eaten me
[1:04:03] up that's a pretty heavy word from the
[1:04:07] psalmist David the Zeal of thine house
[1:04:13] hath eaten me up or some translations
[1:04:18] say and I must say do a better job by
[1:04:22] saying consume me I am consum assumed by
[1:04:27] the Zeal of your house it's all I think
[1:04:31] about it's all uh I care about the Zeal
[1:04:36] of the house of the Lord It's a powerful
[1:04:40] word for us Verse
[1:04:43] 18 then answered the Jews and said unto
[1:04:47] him what sign showest thou unto us
[1:04:52] seeing that thou doest these things
[1:04:55] things remember they're always looking
[1:04:59] for a sign not Gentiles they're worse
[1:05:03] about other things but the Jews were
[1:05:06] always looking for a sign show us a sign
[1:05:11] Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:05:14] destroy this Temple and in three days I
[1:05:19] will oh they they knew better than that
[1:05:23] then said the Jews for 6 years was this
[1:05:28] temple in building and wilt thou rear it
[1:05:32] up in 3 days you mean you're going to do
[1:05:35] in three days what it took 46 years to
[1:05:39] build to remodel under the leadership of
[1:05:42] Herod but he spake of the
[1:05:46] temple this is one of the most important
[1:05:49] messages that Jesus delivered in his
[1:05:52] ministry right this spake he of the
[1:05:56] Temple of his body he's speaking of his
[1:06:02] physical body but metaphorically and
[1:06:06] spiritually he's speaking of his
[1:06:09] spiritual body the church the overcoming
[1:06:13] bride of Jesus Christ when therefore he
[1:06:17] was risen from the dead his disciples
[1:06:20] remembered that he had said this unto
[1:06:23] them and they believed the scripture
[1:06:26] and the word which Jesus had said what
[1:06:29] about before he was raised from the dead
[1:06:31] what about before his crucifixion they
[1:06:34] didn't have a
[1:06:35] clue his talad his disciples they didn't
[1:06:41] have a clue about what he was speaking
[1:06:44] about until it had come to pass and
[1:06:48] evidently he didn't bother to explain it
[1:06:50] to them because sometimes you just long
[1:06:54] for people to get
[1:06:58] it if you get it because I persuade you
[1:07:01] it may not be with you when you need it
[1:07:04] but if you get it by Revelation it'll be
[1:07:08] with you in the good time and the bad
[1:07:10] time and the hard time and the easy time
[1:07:14] and you'll use it to defeat the
[1:07:16] enemy
[1:07:18] amen now when he was in Jerusalem at the
[1:07:21] Passover in the feast day many believed
[1:07:24] in his name came when they saw the
[1:07:28] Miracles which he did he had every
[1:07:30] intention every intention of performing
[1:07:34] The Miraculous but before he could
[1:07:36] perform the miraculous he had to get the
[1:07:39] cheats out of the
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:46] way he desired to perform the
[1:07:50] supernatural he desired to be a
[1:07:53] supernatural God among them but in order
[1:07:56] to do that he had to get the
[1:07:59] hypocrite he had to get the
[1:08:04] cheat the fudger you know what I
[1:08:07] mean some people don't want to think of
[1:08:10] themselves as
[1:08:11] lying even though they
[1:08:14] lie they they just call it fudging are
[1:08:17] you with me fudging just dressing it up
[1:08:20] a little
[1:08:22] bit I want you to know it's an integrity
[1:08:25] issue that's got to be dealt
[1:08:29] with if you've LED somebody to believe
[1:08:32] something that is not the truth God is
[1:08:35] going to hold you responsible for your
[1:08:38] deception I'm going to say it
[1:08:41] again if you have led somebody to
[1:08:44] believe something that is not the truth
[1:08:47] God is going to hold you respon well I
[1:08:49] can't help what they took from it
[1:08:52] on how many times do we walk away
[1:08:55] knowing that they have not got the
[1:08:58] message that we have been vague and have
[1:09:02] not fully communicated the reality of
[1:09:04] the situation you know I'm getting old
[1:09:07] enough now I'm going to stop doing
[1:09:09] that so I advise you to stay away from
[1:09:13] me except in church because I'm just
[1:09:15] going to quit uh fudging I'm just going
[1:09:18] to quit ignoring and looking like I
[1:09:20] don't know I'm if I know I'm going to
[1:09:23] say
[1:09:25] we really are going to have to come to a
[1:09:28] place where we quit enabling
[1:09:31] people to be
[1:09:36] cheaters we we're going to have to call
[1:09:39] it out
[1:09:40] sometime and that's not going to make us
[1:09:43] popular but it'll make us
[1:09:45] honest how many of you'd rather be
[1:09:47] honest than popular brother brandom said
[1:09:50] I'd rather be honest than popular father
[1:09:53] help us today I know that the tone has
[1:09:56] already been set but I didn't set the
[1:09:59] tone you did Lord in the night and I
[1:10:02] have come today uh with a lot of uh uh
[1:10:06] really of trepidation not really
[1:10:08] Desiring to deliver this in the
[1:10:10] intensity that it was given to me but
[1:10:13] I'm asking you to help me I'm reporting
[1:10:16] for Duty I said yes uh many many year
[1:10:20] nearly 50 years ago I said yes you said
[1:10:25] if if you open your mouth I'll feel it I
[1:10:28] have you have and now I have no reason
[1:10:31] to doubt you'll do the same today let it
[1:10:34] not be my opinion let it not be what I
[1:10:37] know in the natural but let it be the
[1:10:40] mind of the spirit today for this house
[1:10:44] and for those who are connected to this
[1:10:47] ministry and we'll give you glory and
[1:10:49] honor and praise for it's in the name
[1:10:51] above every name Yeshua salvation
[1:10:56] our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:10:59] pray and the Saints said you may be
[1:11:02] seated if you need to go out plan your
[1:11:06] trips
[1:11:07] wisely stay out as little as you can
[1:11:10] come back and don't take your phone to
[1:11:14] the
[1:11:18] toilet that's nasty that's
[1:11:22] right put it in your pocket
[1:11:25] don't sit in there on your
[1:11:30] phone I I I've been on a journey to
[1:11:33] figure out why some folks in this church
[1:11:35] are sick all the time and I don't know
[1:11:40] what it is exactly but but I I would
[1:11:43] just maybe suggest that we be a little
[1:11:45] more
[1:11:49] clean get some hand sanitizer the real
[1:11:53] kind and do something about it and don't
[1:11:56] sit on your phone on Facebook or
[1:11:59] whatever you're on uh somebody did a
[1:12:02] little test the other day because
[1:12:04] someone had spent so much time in the
[1:12:07] bathroom they turned the light off and
[1:12:09] and it glows in the in the in the men's
[1:12:13] bathroom it
[1:12:15] glows because someone is sitting there
[1:12:18] on their
[1:12:19] phone now you you've got ouses at home I
[1:12:22] think water closets or something
[1:12:26] and this is not the place for that I
[1:12:29] don't mean to come
[1:12:31] across but I'm just telling you that we
[1:12:35] just going to have to quit fudging
[1:12:38] here
[1:12:40] amen it's not nap time John 2 I want to
[1:12:44] read 14-1 17 in the complete Jewish
[1:12:49] Bible and and it's the same place we
[1:12:51] just read but a little bit shorter
[1:12:53] version it says in the temple grounds he
[1:12:57] found those who were selling cattle
[1:12:59] sheep and pigeons and others who were
[1:13:02] sitting at tables exchanging money does
[1:13:06] anybody know why they would have had to
[1:13:07] have been exchanging money it's not
[1:13:10] because there would have been a lot of
[1:13:11] foreign uh money there but it's because
[1:13:14] there were certain offerings and and
[1:13:17] tributes that were paid with temple
[1:13:20] currency and so you would bring the
[1:13:23] shekele and you would would exchange it
[1:13:26] for temple currency and that's what you
[1:13:28] would be used for offerings or for
[1:13:31] certain tributes that were made at
[1:13:33] certain times of the year so they were
[1:13:36] exchanging their own currency for for a
[1:13:39] temple half shekele and I think there's
[1:13:42] one in that case out there perhaps from
[1:13:45] the time of Jesus uh a temple half
[1:13:48] shekele one that is mented for the
[1:13:50] temple by the temple so they were
[1:13:53] exchanging money they were selling sheep
[1:13:55] and cattle and uh Dove uh King James
[1:13:59] says Dove although the word is is a
[1:14:02] little bit more like pigeon but we know
[1:14:05] they're in the same family he made a
[1:14:07] whip from cords and drove them all out
[1:14:10] of the temple
[1:14:14] grounds not they weren't in the
[1:14:17] sanctuary and uh the sheep and the
[1:14:19] cattle as well he knocked over the money
[1:14:23] I just like it you know he just you know
[1:14:25] I don't think he just casually walked
[1:14:27] over and tipped him over I think for a
[1:14:29] few minutes he was behaving like a man
[1:14:32] from another
[1:14:33] world are you with me I think he just
[1:14:37] lost himself for a moment and uh really
[1:14:40] dealt with the
[1:14:42] business what would you do if your
[1:14:45] pastor just lost himself this morning
[1:14:48] and really dealt with the
[1:14:52] business well you wouldn't be here
[1:14:54] tonight I know
[1:14:55] that because we don't have church on
[1:14:58] Sunday night scattering their
[1:15:02] coins and then verse 16 and to the
[1:15:05] pigeon sellers he said get these things
[1:15:09] out of
[1:15:11] here multiple reasons one they carry
[1:15:14] disease and bird
[1:15:19] mites and they seem to poo more than
[1:15:22] they eat
[1:15:26] and it goes everywhere did I just say
[1:15:28] that in the pullit I
[1:15:30] did it's the truth at least I didn't
[1:15:33] call it what the Bible calls it at
[1:15:36] time uh so it it was a
[1:15:40] mess it's like my vehicle Parks under a
[1:15:43] certain tree and there's a there's a
[1:15:46] bird there that needs to change his
[1:15:49] diet because he hits me in the same spot
[1:15:54] all the time
[1:15:56] time and he and and it's not a little
[1:15:59] plop either I won't go into any more
[1:16:01] detail it's not a little plop it's it's
[1:16:03] a it was a mess and Jesus said get these
[1:16:09] things out of here how dare you turn my
[1:16:14] father's house into a
[1:16:18] market you've got Shooks you've got yard
[1:16:22] sails you've got jockey Lots you've got
[1:16:26] flea markets you've got white elephant
[1:16:30] sales you don't need to to make my
[1:16:34] father's house a a a many Market that's
[1:16:38] not what this place is about this is
[1:16:42] serious business his tadim that's
[1:16:46] disciples later recalled that the Tanakh
[1:16:50] that's the Old Testament says Zeal for
[1:16:54] your house will devour me until there's
[1:17:00] nothing left of who I am I want my
[1:17:04] ambition to be devoured and consumed I
[1:17:08] want my jealousy to be devoured and
[1:17:12] consumed I I want everything that is
[1:17:15] unlike him I want the Zeal for the house
[1:17:19] of the Lord and let me just say from the
[1:17:23] from the from the beginning here that
[1:17:25] we're not talking about this church
[1:17:28] building we're talking about what really
[1:17:31] makes up the Church of God what really
[1:17:34] makes up the elect Lady it's you and I
[1:17:38] we are the temple it's no longer a tent
[1:17:43] a tabernacle a mishcon it's no longer a
[1:17:47] a temple uh made of cedar a and of stone
[1:17:53] it's no longer just one one body the
[1:17:56] body the physical Earthly Temple of the
[1:18:00] Lord Jesus Christ but now we as a body
[1:18:04] corporate Believers we are the
[1:18:07] manifestation of the word for this last
[1:18:11] day we've been preaching that Jesus must
[1:18:15] have the preeminence Among Us he must
[1:18:19] have the preeminence in our individual
[1:18:22] lives he must have the preeminence in
[1:18:26] our corporate gathering in our mission
[1:18:29] statement in our ministry purpose it
[1:18:32] must be Jesus having the preeminence the
[1:18:36] full Focus the full attention because
[1:18:40] Deliverance can't come in the name of
[1:18:43] Shelly it can't come in the name of
[1:18:45] William bradam it can't come in the name
[1:18:48] of gy real Deliverance can only come in
[1:18:52] the name that is above everything name
[1:18:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:19:00] not enough to call his name it's not
[1:19:04] enough to announce his name it's not
[1:19:07] enough to
[1:19:09] enunciate his name it's the
[1:19:12] life it's the life behind the name that
[1:19:18] makes the demons
[1:19:21] tremble it's the life behind the name
[1:19:24] that makes a proud
[1:19:27] heart
[1:19:30] humble it was God who divised the
[1:19:35] plan that in all things as a man he
[1:19:39] would live so he could give give us the
[1:19:44] life give us the life give us the life
[1:19:49] behind the name are you with me there's
[1:19:53] go there's a BRI
[1:19:55] and that bride carries the life that's
[1:19:59] behind the name she she's not
[1:20:02] politically driven but she's not
[1:20:04] popularity driven she's not money
[1:20:08] focused come on now she's letting Jesus
[1:20:13] woo she's letting Jesus have the
[1:20:17] preeminence in all things she doesn't
[1:20:20] have time this little bride doesn't have
[1:20:22] time to keep up with everything that
[1:20:24] goes on in every other Church she
[1:20:27] doesn't have time to keep up with what's
[1:20:30] going on in the denominational
[1:20:32] Christianity we don't have time to keep
[1:20:34] up with those things we may we may pass
[1:20:37] and repass but she is word focused she
[1:20:41] is Jesus focused she has to be she's not
[1:20:46] pointing people to icons she's not
[1:20:49] pointing people to symbols she's not
[1:20:51] even pointing people to photographs
[1:20:54] because a photograph is no more than a
[1:20:57] painted image a a a printed image it's
[1:21:00] the life you're going to need that
[1:21:03] Pillar of Fire interacting in your life
[1:21:07] you don't just need to look at it on a
[1:21:09] photograph you need to carry it with
[1:21:12] you wherever you go come on and it's not
[1:21:16] his coming in a cloud that you need to
[1:21:19] be so excited about it's just coming in
[1:21:22] a cloud of witnesses when he comes with
[1:21:25] his
[1:21:26] bride we need to get ready for that we
[1:21:30] need to get Rapture Ready and
[1:21:32] Resurrection ready Hallelujah because
[1:21:35] he's
[1:21:36] coming he has come and he is
[1:21:41] coming oh praise God Jesus is coming
[1:21:46] he's coming for his bride then he's
[1:21:49] coming with his bride it's not all over
[1:21:53] Revelation 10 1 through 7 is not all
[1:21:56] over it's not all finished the angel of
[1:22:00] the Covenant is coming again to receive
[1:22:03] a
[1:22:05] bride the seventh seal is not a Rapture
[1:22:08] mystery it's a second coming mystery and
[1:22:12] we better get a hold of that because
[1:22:15] what's happening as I said last week we
[1:22:18] are putting everything in the
[1:22:21] past or somewhere off in the wild Blue
[1:22:25] Yonder future and we are
[1:22:28] missing like the people who are standing
[1:22:31] on Mountain
[1:22:33] Grandeur stepping on little individual
[1:22:36] Blades of grass bees buzzing around
[1:22:40] their head and butterflies floating
[1:22:43] through the air and fluffy clouds out on
[1:22:46] the horizon and they're saying where is
[1:22:48] God where is God where is God you're
[1:22:52] standing on him you're looking at at him
[1:22:55] you're surrounded by a Creator he's
[1:22:58] everywhere God is
[1:23:02] everywhere he has hidden himself to the
[1:23:05] church in Simplicity and he has now
[1:23:09] revealed himself to his bride in the
[1:23:12] same
[1:23:13] manner in the same manner not in
[1:23:17] complication not in
[1:23:20] complexity he has hidden and revealed
[1:23:23] himself how
[1:23:25] Church in
[1:23:27] Simplicity aren't you glad aren't you
[1:23:30] glad because that means you can get him
[1:23:33] you can know him you can have a
[1:23:36] revelation of who he is without a
[1:23:41] diploma without a
[1:23:43] degree you can know him in the in the
[1:23:47] fellowship of his suffering in the and
[1:23:50] in the power of of his resurrection Li
[1:23:55] and overcoming because he
[1:23:58] overcame because he overcame all of us
[1:24:03] are you helping me all of us are
[1:24:07] Overcomers because he
[1:24:12] overcame when you're dumping on each
[1:24:15] other do you ever
[1:24:17] consider someone's frame of mind before
[1:24:21] you tell them how rough things are at
[1:24:24] your
[1:24:25] address do you ever consider the fact
[1:24:28] that you're not the only one that has a
[1:24:30] strain or a stress or a heartache or a
[1:24:36] problem do you ever think about doing a
[1:24:38] wellness check on somebody before you
[1:24:41] tell them how dark it is how Bleak it
[1:24:45] is how your husband spoke to you so
[1:24:50] rudely how taking advantage of you are
[1:24:53] Miss understood you are how used you are
[1:24:57] do you ever think about the fact that
[1:24:59] you may be speaking to someone who is on
[1:25:02] the same precipice who is on the same
[1:25:05] Edge hear me
[1:25:06] now on the same Edge as you are they may
[1:25:10] be smiling more than you smile but that
[1:25:12] doesn't mean that they're not in a
[1:25:14] battle let me tell you something so what
[1:25:17] we ought to try to do is find a little
[1:25:19] litmus test that we can use spiritually
[1:25:22] to find out if this is a good time time
[1:25:24] to
[1:25:25] dump trauma
[1:25:28] dumping is better at the
[1:25:34] altar it doesn't mean that we can't talk
[1:25:37] about our situation with someone that we
[1:25:40] know someone that we are in relationship
[1:25:43] with we must be able to do that at times
[1:25:47] but we should do that with
[1:25:49] relationship that checks up on each
[1:25:52] other
[1:25:54] are you all right how are you you know
[1:25:57] how are things with you instead
[1:26:05] of
[1:26:07] vomiting
[1:26:09] trauma and uh you know I I I don't know
[1:26:13] why we have come to this place in our
[1:26:16] society where we think the only way we
[1:26:19] can encourage someone or help someone is
[1:26:22] to tell them where we have had the same
[1:26:27] problem can I tell you that that is not
[1:26:31] generally what people want to hear when
[1:26:33] they're in the throws of Despair is for
[1:26:35] you to tell how you've been through the
[1:26:37] same thing this is old counseling style
[1:26:42] and it's just not working in 2024 for
[1:26:45] you to always spend in fact people spend
[1:26:47] more
[1:26:49] time they ask you how you are and then
[1:26:52] they spend more time telling you all the
[1:26:55] struggles that they're walking through
[1:26:57] and how they've overcome blah blah blah
[1:27:00] blah blah and you're just sitting there
[1:27:02] sometime thinking so
[1:27:05] what come on be
[1:27:08] honest I'm just telling you what people
[1:27:11] say to me all the time people say to me
[1:27:13] all the time there are certain people I
[1:27:15] would never go
[1:27:19] to because they all they would do is
[1:27:22] spew how that reminds them of this and
[1:27:25] that reminds them of that and that
[1:27:27] reminds them of this trial and that
[1:27:29] reminds them of the other trial I want
[1:27:31] to tell you something I want to remind
[1:27:32] you of something from last week somebody
[1:27:35] sitting near where you are today is
[1:27:40] overcoming
[1:27:42] oh yes we're not all going under
[1:27:46] somebody in this house is rising
[1:27:51] above and it's only by the grave
[1:27:55] and the
[1:27:57] mercy of
[1:27:59] God
[1:28:01] woo you don't ever want to leave
[1:28:03] somebody in worse shape than you found
[1:28:05] them and the way to make sure of that is
[1:28:07] fill up your vocabulary with the truth
[1:28:10] of God's word and spew it like a fire
[1:28:14] hydrant that the truck is backed into
[1:28:17] you just spew words of life and words of
[1:28:20] Hope and words of encouragement you can
[1:28:24] make it I know you can like Cade was
[1:28:27] sing to us this morning you're the
[1:28:29] corner that I run to you're the rock
[1:28:33] that I'm anchored to come on that's why
[1:28:37] he's telling us you you must let him
[1:28:40] have
[1:28:42] preeminence debt can have
[1:28:46] preeminence your living conditions can
[1:28:49] have
[1:28:50] preeminence come on now your job
[1:28:52] situation can have preeminence your
[1:28:55] wicked family can't have
[1:28:58] preeminence hello your pet can't have
[1:29:03] preeminence Jesus has to have it Jesus
[1:29:07] has to have it who cheated you can't
[1:29:09] have
[1:29:11] preeminence how you got a lousy doctor
[1:29:13] that can't have preeminence there's only
[1:29:16] one thing that can have preeminence in
[1:29:18] the life of an overcoming believer and
[1:29:20] that's the goodness of God the mighty
[1:29:23] power of Jesus to deliver Hallelujah he
[1:29:26] didn't say I'll always take you out of
[1:29:28] the fiery furnace but he said I'll go
[1:29:30] with
[1:29:31] you I may not take you out of the Lion's
[1:29:34] Den but I'll shut the mouth of the
[1:29:37] lion I'll get my granny used to say
[1:29:40] he'll give the lion lock
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:44] jaw how many of you are glad he
[1:29:47] did and what a testimony came out of
[1:29:50] it what a testimony came out of it
[1:29:54] I I want you to know that there is a
[1:29:58] shoulder that you can lean on and when
[1:30:02] you walk away he you have never left him
[1:30:09] drained his battery isn't
[1:30:12] drained his gas tank isn't on
[1:30:15] empty you haven't leeched all the
[1:30:18] strength out of him come on there's a
[1:30:22] shoulder that you can on an everlasting
[1:30:25] arm that you can depend on there's a
[1:30:28] name that you can call on there's a
[1:30:31] place that you can bow your knee before
[1:30:33] the Lord and say I'm throwing myself on
[1:30:38] the Rock of Ages I might get broken but
[1:30:42] thank God he'll not have to crush me to
[1:30:46] powder because the
[1:30:48] Zeal of the house of the Lord not a
[1:30:53] building
[1:30:54] not a
[1:30:57] religion but the Zeal the
[1:31:01] passion the
[1:31:04] jealousy did you know in in in both
[1:31:07] Hebrew and Greek there are words in the
[1:31:11] Bible that can be translated both
[1:31:15] Zeal uh uh zealous and
[1:31:21] jealous zealous or
[1:31:25] jealous the same word remember I told
[1:31:28] you some weeks ago doing a little study
[1:31:30] on the difference between envy and
[1:31:33] jealousy I I I just didn't finish it but
[1:31:36] I will on some occasion finish it
[1:31:40] because I still hear people using and
[1:31:42] even myself sometime I find myself using
[1:31:45] the words wrong they're not completely
[1:31:49] interchangeably in the scripture
[1:31:51] interchangeable in the scripture
[1:31:54] most of the time when we describe a
[1:31:57] situation what we call jealousy is
[1:31:59] envy and jealousy is not always a bad
[1:32:03] thing the Lord is
[1:32:05] jealous right he's a jealous God but
[1:32:08] he's not evil he just wants your focus
[1:32:12] it's possible for you to be jealous over
[1:32:15] the things of God with a as
[1:32:18] zealous and not not be putting someone
[1:32:22] else down or or judging someone else's
[1:32:25] experience but you're just becoming
[1:32:27] consumed with a passion that says more
[1:32:31] than anything else I want to be a pillar
[1:32:34] in the house of the Lord I want to be a
[1:32:37] rock in the house of the Lord I want to
[1:32:39] be a beam in the house of the Lord I
[1:32:43] want I'd rather like the psalmist said
[1:32:45] be a
[1:32:48] doorkeeper oh you're going to give out
[1:32:50] of gas that
[1:32:51] quick I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the
[1:32:55] house of the Lord for one day than to
[1:32:57] dwell in the tents of evil of
[1:33:01] wickedness forever and ever and ever and
[1:33:05] ever Yeshua said I know you've been
[1:33:08] doing it I know this is not your first
[1:33:11] year but you're going
[1:33:14] unchecked and the more you're unchecked
[1:33:17] the more you you have no accountability
[1:33:20] you're getting closer and closer
[1:33:22] encroaching on that which is sacred on
[1:33:25] that which is
[1:33:26] holy your prices are not
[1:33:30] proportionate to what you're offering
[1:33:32] the people you are making my father's
[1:33:35] house a
[1:33:37] Marketplace a yard sale a junk sail and
[1:33:42] this is to be a House of
[1:33:44] Prayer it's a serious serious word that
[1:33:49] Jesus is giving us I'd like for you to
[1:33:52] go with me for a moment to s
[1:33:54] 69 I don't want to get too far away from
[1:33:58] where I
[1:33:59] am and there are 36 verses here I'd like
[1:34:04] to read them all but I don't know if I
[1:34:06] will or
[1:34:08] not I believe if I did you would be able
[1:34:12] to
[1:34:13] relate to some of these
[1:34:16] verses perhaps a
[1:34:19] description of how you're feeling at the
[1:34:22] moment might be be found in some of
[1:34:25] these verses so let me just start and
[1:34:29] see where we get this is Psalm
[1:34:34] 69 and it's to a chief
[1:34:37] musician whose name was
[1:34:42] shim which is a plural of of
[1:34:47] Shana I wanted you to know that because
[1:34:51] it's written by David
[1:34:54] and he is
[1:34:56] encouraging uh one of the Ministers of
[1:35:00] Music in the house of the Lord but it
[1:35:04] don't always sound like that he makes it
[1:35:06] pretty
[1:35:07] personal save me oh God for the waters
[1:35:12] are come in unto my
[1:35:16] soul most commentators believe that he
[1:35:19] was prophetically picking up on what the
[1:35:23] muse was going through and so even
[1:35:26] though he's saying it out of his own
[1:35:28] mouth he is very likely describing the
[1:35:33] condition of a fellow minister in the
[1:35:35] temple of the Lord save me oh God for
[1:35:39] the waters are come in unto my soul I
[1:35:43] sink in deep M where there is no
[1:35:46] standing I am come into deep Waters
[1:35:50] where the floods overflow me have you
[1:35:52] ever felt that way way
[1:35:55] hello anybody in here ever felt that way
[1:35:58] anybody felt that way this week I'm
[1:36:01] weary of my
[1:36:03] crying uh uh this is part of the problem
[1:36:06] people are too prideful too
[1:36:12] pompous I'm amazed sometime even in
[1:36:15] people's prayer requests how ppus they
[1:36:18] can be as though God is some little uh
[1:36:21] uh you know some little musician
[1:36:23] somewhere
[1:36:24] he said you know you piped unto
[1:36:28] me and I didn't
[1:36:30] dance I hear people say things sometime
[1:36:33] that make me think that their idea of
[1:36:35] God is that all he has to do is keep you
[1:36:43] happy listen he is not our
[1:36:47] Entertainer he's not our
[1:36:49] entertainment we can't sit on our
[1:36:51] behinds of do nothing
[1:36:55] and expect God to drop everything in our
[1:37:00] lap well I need a
[1:37:05] job that's not a way to ask me to
[1:37:10] pray that's not a way to ask your
[1:37:12] brother or sister to pray well I guess I
[1:37:15] need a
[1:37:16] job sure you need a
[1:37:19] job you don't have to be very spiritual
[1:37:21] to figure that one out you need a job
[1:37:24] because you need to
[1:37:27] eat you need a job because you had to
[1:37:30] have a
[1:37:31] wife and since you had to have a wife
[1:37:34] the least you can do is feed her and you
[1:37:38] can't feed
[1:37:43] her sure you need a
[1:37:46] job because you kept even though you
[1:37:49] found out what was causing it
[1:37:55] you couldn't stop it long enough to
[1:37:58] figure out how you were going to feed
[1:38:02] them and they have to
[1:38:05] eat so of course you need a job and you
[1:38:09] shouldn't have an attitude like it's
[1:38:12] God's big
[1:38:13] obligation on to come and give you a
[1:38:19] career because when we get desperate
[1:38:22] enough
[1:38:23] we get hungry enough we're going to beat
[1:38:27] the
[1:38:28] bush we're going to join president Trump
[1:38:31] in the Drive-Thru window of
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:37] McDonald's who knows you may be the one
[1:38:40] to fix the ice cream machines nobody
[1:38:46] knows you you when you get in a
[1:38:49] situation of desperation like that you
[1:38:52] you start selling things
[1:38:54] things how do I know that because I've
[1:38:57] been there and so have some of
[1:38:59] you you don't you don't act as though
[1:39:02] God has nothing else to be concerned
[1:39:06] about you you don't make it as though
[1:39:09] it's his only concern and obligation to
[1:39:11] come and give you a get it just beat
[1:39:14] down the
[1:39:16] door I'll do the praying you do the
[1:39:20] application filling out it doesn't take
[1:39:23] take a genius to figure out God will
[1:39:26] always always always do his
[1:39:31] part but we're not going to be able to
[1:39:34] treat him like a bunch of children
[1:39:35] sitting in the marketplaces saying I
[1:39:38] piped into
[1:39:41] you and you didn't get up and dance
[1:39:43] every time I piped he is not your
[1:39:49] excuse to do nothing to be nothing sir
[1:39:53] he's not your he's not your lucky
[1:39:55] rabbit's foot he's not the Horseshoe
[1:39:58] over your door he's your father he's
[1:40:01] your papa he's your provider he's your
[1:40:04] helper he's your deliverer but he
[1:40:06] deserves to be
[1:40:08] treated with honor and
[1:40:11] respect and gratitude and
[1:40:15] Thanksgiving he don't need you and I
[1:40:17] beating on the auor telling him I paid
[1:40:19] my
[1:40:21] tithe are you kidding me
[1:40:24] I paid my tith so I'm expecting
[1:40:32] you he's not our
[1:40:35] puppet he doesn't work for us he's not
[1:40:38] our
[1:40:40] servant we're
[1:40:44] his there's a root there's a root that's
[1:40:48] got to be discovered in this hour
[1:40:50] there's a root because the Zeal of thine
[1:40:53] house is supposed to be consuming this
[1:40:57] little bride in this hour it's the
[1:40:59] cleansing of the temple of God it has to
[1:41:03] come now it has to come in this hour and
[1:41:06] we can't put it off any longer we can't
[1:41:09] wait until another dispensation because
[1:41:12] this is the finality of all things the
[1:41:15] bride is already reaching into the
[1:41:17] bright age while the church is suffering
[1:41:19] the last few hours of leod deia there's
[1:41:23] never been a more appropriate time an
[1:41:26] expedient time than the time right now
[1:41:29] to be consumed by the Zeal of the house
[1:41:33] of the Lord the passion to be a
[1:41:41] temple that God can live
[1:41:45] in I'm weary of my crying my throat is
[1:41:49] dried my eyes fail while I wait for my
[1:41:52] it's not
[1:42:05] fair we're raising
[1:42:08] children who think just like they're
[1:42:10] doing that's what what disturbs me so
[1:42:12] much is is woke
[1:42:16] Society has infiltrated the church and
[1:42:20] it has also infiltrated the message
[1:42:22] Church
[1:42:24] and people are afraid of you know if we
[1:42:26] if we get it real straight or say it
[1:42:28] real straight or preach it real straight
[1:42:29] we're going to hurt somebody's
[1:42:33] feelings it's perfect love we're coming
[1:42:35] to that means mature
[1:42:39] love you're going to need to be able to
[1:42:41] handle a little correction if you're
[1:42:44] going to manifest perfect love
[1:42:47] hello there's an hour we're living in an
[1:42:50] hour now where it's not petted we don't
[1:42:52] need to
[1:42:53] petted we sometimes need to be
[1:42:57] prodded but we don't really need to be
[1:43:00] petted we need somebody to shake us up
[1:43:03] to the reality that we are exactly who
[1:43:06] we choose to
[1:43:13] be if you're defeated you've chosen to
[1:43:16] be
[1:43:18] defeated am I out of the word am I out
[1:43:22] of the message
[1:43:24] the greatest battle ever
[1:43:25] fought right up here we know what God's
[1:43:29] word said but we're still trying to
[1:43:30] reason it out we're still trying to
[1:43:33] figure it out somebody said I don't
[1:43:36] understand why it's not working for me
[1:43:37] yes you do you know exactly why it's not
[1:43:40] working for you because you won't sell
[1:43:42] out you won't completely sell out you've
[1:43:47] got bones in your closet that you've
[1:43:49] never dealt with and you claim to have a
[1:43:52] zeal for the house of the Lord and God
[1:43:55] said it's not going to
[1:44:01] work you've left people with the
[1:44:03] impression that you're innocent When
[1:44:05] You're Not
[1:44:07] Innocent you've been dishonest you've
[1:44:09] not moved with
[1:44:12] Integrity you have absolutely doctored
[1:44:15] the details so many
[1:44:17] times until you don't even know what
[1:44:20] really really happened
[1:44:24] and we're wondering why we're not moving
[1:44:28] in perfect love and perfect faith in
[1:44:31] perfect power with God's
[1:44:39] Authority the Zeal of thine house hath
[1:44:44] eaten me
[1:44:47] up and the reproaches of them that
[1:44:51] reproached thee
[1:44:54] are fallen on
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:02] me that's verse
[1:45:05] nine verse four they hate me they that
[1:45:08] Hate Me Without a Cause are more than
[1:45:10] the hairs of mine head they that would
[1:45:13] destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully
[1:45:16] are
[1:45:17] Mighty then I restored that which I took
[1:45:20] not away oh God thou knowest I love the
[1:45:25] honesty thou knowest my
[1:45:31] foolishness you know that I have sat
[1:45:34] down when I ought to have been putting
[1:45:37] my shoulder to the plow I have been
[1:45:41] foolish waiting on you to do what I
[1:45:44] needed to be doing
[1:45:50] myself teaching my family family that
[1:45:53] God must
[1:45:55] fail when things don't roll out for us
[1:45:59] like a red
[1:46:00] carpet that's not helping
[1:46:03] anybody let me tell you something God
[1:46:06] will always help those who cannot help
[1:46:09] themselves don't you ever forget that he
[1:46:13] will like I said a moment ago a
[1:46:15] motherless he'll be a mother to the
[1:46:17] motherless and a father to the
[1:46:19] fatherless and a Healer to the sick who
[1:46:21] can't do anything about his sickness but
[1:46:25] there comes a time that God said I'm
[1:46:26] tired of being your lucky a
[1:46:30] charm how many times did he send
[1:46:33] prophets to Israel to say to them you
[1:46:35] are spoiled you are spoiled rotten
[1:46:39] you're the apple of my eye but you are
[1:46:41] so
[1:46:43] rotten because you treat me like a worn
[1:46:47] out sandal
[1:47:04] they that Hate Me Without a Cause are
[1:47:06] more than the hairs of mine head they
[1:47:08] that would destroy me being mine enemies
[1:47:11] wrongfully are Mighty then I restored
[1:47:13] that which I took not
[1:47:16] away go
[1:47:20] back the psalmist has said I've had to
[1:47:23] try to
[1:47:25] fix what other people have
[1:47:30] done and they come out smelling like a
[1:47:34] rose and the reproach has fallen on my
[1:47:38] head for things that I was powerless
[1:47:41] against come on have you ever felt that
[1:47:45] way have you ever felt judged for what
[1:47:48] somebody else was
[1:47:49] doing for the playground that everybody
[1:47:52] else was making
[1:47:53] making David felt that way
[1:47:57] evidently so did the
[1:48:01] musician oh God thou knowest my
[1:48:04] foolishness and my sins are not hid from
[1:48:08] Thee I love the fact that he didn't say
[1:48:10] my mistakes my little shortcomings my
[1:48:13] little
[1:48:14] foxes my unbelief my
[1:48:17] sins there's no reason to try to fool
[1:48:20] you Lord right
[1:48:26] you already know you know my envyings
[1:48:29] you know my jealousies you know my
[1:48:31] resentments you know what I say about my
[1:48:34] pastor and his
[1:48:39] family come
[1:48:42] on yes he
[1:48:45] knows tell him
[1:48:48] anyway that way you're not excusing
[1:48:51] yourself
[1:48:54] you're getting it out in the
[1:48:57] open you've entertained things that you
[1:49:00] should not have entertained right the
[1:49:03] Lord warned me sitting in my Den some
[1:49:07] months ago I said to my wife I see an
[1:49:10] attack of the enemy coming against our
[1:49:13] family because of envying and
[1:49:16] jealousy we've done nothing to deserve
[1:49:19] this kind of an attack but it just will
[1:49:22] not die
[1:49:23] die you being
[1:49:26] honest if I have a holiday somebody's
[1:49:29] got something to say about it if I have
[1:49:30] a pair of shoes somebody's got something
[1:49:32] to say about it if my child has a new
[1:49:34] phone somebody's got something to say
[1:49:36] about it do you know what that lets me
[1:49:38] know when we get to that place we've got
[1:49:40] too much time on our
[1:49:43] hands am we need to be consumed I'm not
[1:49:47] defending my family they're they're far
[1:49:50] from perfect far far far from perfect
[1:49:55] but you will do better to get your eyes
[1:49:57] off of them and let the Zeal of the
[1:50:00] house of the Lord consume
[1:50:03] you amen I told my wife I told my family
[1:50:07] some of them I don't know how this is
[1:50:09] going to manifest has something to do
[1:50:11] with the baby I don't know how this is
[1:50:13] going to come about but I'm deeply
[1:50:15] concerned about it I didn't sleep good
[1:50:18] for days about it I just somehow came to
[1:50:20] a place where I knew that only God could
[1:50:23] take care of
[1:50:26] it and he did his
[1:50:30] Mercy his grace God is
[1:50:34] Sovereign he could have stopped it don't
[1:50:37] you think the devil did it on his own
[1:50:40] accord and it was just all him and God
[1:50:42] just you know didn't know it was
[1:50:44] happening he allows it because he wants
[1:50:47] us to
[1:50:48] learn that the enemy will hijack the
[1:50:51] plans and timings of the
[1:50:55] Lord for reasons and
[1:50:58] purposes that we won't understand until
[1:51:01] the victory
[1:51:04] comes God was faithful in every part of
[1:51:07] it but that kind of a spirit will not
[1:51:10] destroy
[1:51:13] us it'll destroy you that's
[1:51:17] right it won't destroy the one you envy
[1:51:20] or the one you're jealous of it will
[1:51:22] destroy Dy you the one that you refuse
[1:51:24] to forgive that unforgiveness will not
[1:51:27] destroy the object of your unforgiveness
[1:51:29] it'll be like
[1:51:33] acid it'll work to destroy you are you
[1:51:36] angry this morning the Zeal you wonder
[1:51:38] what's wrong with me the Zeal of thine
[1:51:40] house hath eaten me
[1:51:43] up I've tried to walk with you through
[1:51:46] the valley of the shadow of death I've
[1:51:49] tried to be everything that I possibly
[1:51:52] could be during one of The Darkest Hours
[1:51:55] of this ministry but I need to tell you
[1:51:59] that you didn't get a
[1:52:02] p and there's going to be times when I
[1:52:06] must come to you with a word from the
[1:52:09] Lord that says yes I acknowledge your
[1:52:13] pain I acknowledge your heartbreak I
[1:52:16] acknowledge what you're going through
[1:52:18] but the Lord is saying I'm calling you
[1:52:21] to come up to to come up to come up to
[1:52:24] come up to come up to get
[1:52:30] above will we be overwhelmed yes will it
[1:52:34] come in waves yes will anger be a part
[1:52:38] of it yes will we blame ourselves at
[1:52:42] times yes will we blame others at times
[1:52:48] yes but we must we must must
[1:52:55] choose we must
[1:52:58] grieve but we must choose not to be
[1:53:01] consumed right by our grief that's right
[1:53:07] we must not be eaten up with our
[1:53:13] anger with the selfishness of what we're
[1:53:16] walking through it will eat you up it'll
[1:53:19] make you bitter it'll cause you to miss
[1:53:21] what God's trying to use these dark
[1:53:24] terrible circumstances for he wants to
[1:53:27] win a victory in your life he wants to
[1:53:29] win a battle through you come on he
[1:53:32] wants to do something for you
[1:53:34] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:53:37] you could even
[1:53:38] imagine he is a restorer and not only a
[1:53:42] restorer he said but I will give
[1:53:46] restitution when the thief is caught in
[1:53:48] the
[1:53:49] act God said I'll demand I I'll demand
[1:53:53] I'll make
[1:53:54] sure that he doesn't just give back what
[1:53:56] he
[1:53:57] sto he'll have to do it over and over
[1:53:59] and over and over again come on come on
[1:54:02] come on but you'll never come to that
[1:54:04] place if Envy is consuming you if
[1:54:07] resentment is consuming you if blame
[1:54:09] game is consuming you if the first thing
[1:54:11] you do every morning is wake up to see
[1:54:13] what social media has to say about it
[1:54:15] you're being consumed by
[1:54:20] it make up your mind
[1:54:22] that you're going to be consumed by
[1:54:24] something
[1:54:25] else not because turkey day is coming
[1:54:28] that's
[1:54:33] right when we go through things like
[1:54:36] this it's those it's those birthdays
[1:54:38] it's those anniversaries it's those
[1:54:41] firsts it's all those things that rise
[1:54:44] up to try to smack
[1:54:50] us we're human
[1:54:53] you don't have to be directly involved
[1:54:55] to be involved you don't have to be
[1:54:57] directly impacted to be impacted You
[1:55:00] Don't Have To Be Blood kin or legal kin
[1:55:03] to feel the
[1:55:06] pain but God is setting examples Among
[1:55:14] Us let me let me read it to you see if
[1:55:16] you can recognize this they that Hate Me

[1:55:55] the midst of all of this suffering some
[1:55:57] people have to go back to
[1:56:01] work and it's the strength of the Lord
[1:56:04] and the grace of the Lord that's setting
[1:56:06] such an example before us and we can't
[1:56:09] do any less we must not do any less we
[1:56:12] cannot afford to do any less than what
[1:56:16] we see modeled in front of
[1:56:18] us we must press we must find a place of
[1:56:22] zeal for the Lord uh come on now we must
[1:56:26] determine to be faithful to God to his

[1:59:06] there're singing about me but ask for me
[1:59:09] my prayer oh yeah is under thee Oh Lord

[1:59:46] multitude of thy Tender Mercies and hide
[1:59:48] not thy face listen praise God he's
[1:59:51] going on longer about the goodness of
[1:59:53] God and giving it over to God then he
[1:59:56] went on about his own heartache hide not
[1:59:59] thy face from thy servant for I in
[2:00:01] trouble hear me speedily draw nigh into
[2:00:04] my soul and redeem it deliver me because

[2:00:15] adversaries are all before thee reproach
[2:00:18] hath broken my heart and I'm full of
[2:00:20] heaviness and I look for to take pity
[2:00:23] but there was none and for
[2:00:26] comforters I found none because
[2:00:29] everybody had their own
[2:00:38] stuff it's not always because you're not
[2:00:48] loved I'm always amazed at how people
[2:00:51] who have raise their children
[2:00:54] forget what it was like to raise
[2:01:00] children it's so easy for
[2:01:03] grandmas to criticize young
[2:01:08] mothers maybe you had
[2:01:13] Maids my mother was raised by
[2:01:20] maid she was so
[2:01:23] rotten she said that she'd go
[2:01:27] downtown and walk as far as she could
[2:01:30] walk and then sit down on the sidewalk
[2:01:31] and she'd say little girl I'm not
[2:01:33] walking another step till somebody picks
[2:01:35] me
[2:01:37] up everybody doesn't have a privileged
[2:01:40] life like that she certainly paid for it
[2:01:45] later everybody didn't have a
[2:01:48] maid running around to help Mama take
[2:01:50] care of you
[2:01:52] it's easy to forget what it's really
[2:01:56] like when you're on the other
[2:01:59] side you people that get so twisty in
[2:02:02] church because a a child has cried or
[2:02:05] someone has made a sound a little baby a
[2:02:11] squeaked someone has tugged you or
[2:02:14] rolled a car between your
[2:02:20] ankles you must have forgotten what it
[2:02:23] was
[2:02:25] like we need to show a little
[2:02:32] Mercy the reality is I'd rather have a a
[2:02:36] a house full of noisy children that I
[2:02:39] know are going to be raised now some of
[2:02:42] them need a
[2:02:49] spanking when I see a parent stand off
[2:02:52] and watch a child
[2:02:53] misbehave and they
[2:02:56] Snicker when I see that I think there's
[2:02:58] two weapons needed
[2:03:03] here why don't I just start with Mom and
[2:03:11] Dad I told a young teenager not too long
[2:03:14] ago the next time I hear you using
[2:03:17] language that you've used language like
[2:03:19] that I'm coming over here with a bar of
[2:03:24] soap and I'm going to wash your mouth
[2:03:26] out with soap and you're going to let me
[2:03:30] because I love you and you know
[2:03:35] it sometime
[2:03:39] somebody that's a little bit
[2:03:41] outside has to just step up and
[2:03:47] say I know you're frustrated I know
[2:03:49] you're hurting I know you're angry
[2:03:52] I know you've been through some stuff
[2:03:55] but I don't know anybody that hadn't
[2:03:56] been through some stuff and just because
[2:03:59] you've been through some stuff doesn't
[2:04:00] entitle you to live like a
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:09] heathen some people feel so sorry for
[2:04:11] their children having to be raised
[2:04:14] without a Christmas tree or without some
[2:04:16] of the things that the world is so crazy
[2:04:18] about that you want to give them all the
[2:04:20] things that they don't need
[2:04:23] you involve them in things that cause
[2:04:25] them to miss church and then you
[2:04:33] wonder then you
[2:04:40] wonder where am
[2:04:44] I I didn't find
[2:04:48] any have you ever needed but there
[2:04:51] wasn't
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:53] none what did you do did you eat
[2:04:57] worms or did you say I'm going to throw
[2:05:01] myself on the
[2:05:04] mercy of a living
[2:05:08] God I'm not going to look for a way out
[2:05:10] I'm going to look for a way
[2:05:12] over because he's a way
[2:05:16] maker he didn't take Daniel out he
[2:05:18] didn't take Shadrach meach AB bed to go
[2:05:21] out but didn't go through it by
[2:05:23] themselves he could have picked up two
[2:05:25] million people and put them on the other
[2:05:27] side of the Red Sea but instead he
[2:05:29] parted the
[2:05:32] waters went right through it this didn't
[2:05:36] come to
[2:05:37] stay it came to
[2:05:40] pass come
[2:05:44] on let's go on they gave me also Gall
[2:05:48] for my meat now he he he's he's
[2:05:50] prophetic again
[2:05:52] in and in my thirst they gave me vinegar
[2:05:55] to
[2:05:56] drink let their table become a snare
[2:05:59] before them and that which should have
[2:06:02] been for their welfare let it become a
[2:06:06] trap Oh My My
[2:06:10] My let their eyes be darkened that they
[2:06:13] see not and make their loins continually
[2:06:16] to shake somebody
[2:06:18] stirred pour out thine indignation upon
[2:06:22] them I don't have anybody to feel sorry
[2:06:24] for me so I'm going to call on the Lord
[2:06:27] and I'm going to believe him to fight my
[2:06:31] battle he's going to be the one to
[2:06:33] respond come
[2:06:35] on don't matter what I tell him to do
[2:06:38] he's only going to do what he knows to
[2:06:39] do and needs to
[2:06:42] do woo come
[2:06:46] on pray for
[2:06:49] them pour out thine unending Nation upon
[2:06:52] them and let thy wrathful anger take
[2:06:53] hold of them let their habitation be
[2:06:56] desolate and let none dwell in their
[2:06:57] tents for they persecute him who thou
[2:07:00] Hast smitten as Christ and they talk to
[2:07:04] the grief of Those whom thou Hast
[2:07:05] wounded come on and iniquity to their
[2:07:08] iniquity and let them not come into thy
[2:07:11] righteousness there's going to be a
[2:07:13] price to be paid for rejecting Messiah
[2:07:17] let them be blotted out of the book of
[2:07:18] the living and not be written with the
[2:07:20] righteous ser ious business but I am
[2:07:22] poor and sorrowful let thy salvation oh
[2:07:25] God set me up on high I will praise the
[2:07:29] name of God with a song and will Magnify
[2:07:33] Him with
[2:07:35] Thanksgiving oh I see a man who goes
[2:07:38] from dark to
[2:07:39] light am who goes from a need to have
[2:07:43] Vengeance to a need to glorify God for
[2:07:46] his
[2:07:47] faithfulness you're not so unlike David
[2:07:49] in this
[2:07:52] I'm not so unlike David in this God sees
[2:07:55] what we're going
[2:07:57] through this also shall please the Lord
[2:07:59] better than an ox or a bullet that hath
[2:08:01] horns and
[2:08:03] hoofs the humble shall see this and be
[2:08:05] glad and your heart shall live that seek
[2:08:07] God for the Lord heareth the poor and
[2:08:09] despiseth not his prisoners let the
[2:08:11] Heaven and Earth Praise Him the Seas and
[2:08:14] everything that moveth therein for God
[2:08:16] Will Save Zion and will build the cities
[2:08:18] of Judah that they may dwell there and
[2:08:20] have it in possession come on I'm
[2:08:22] believing the seed also of his servant
[2:08:24] shall inherit it and they that love his
[2:08:27] name shall dwell therein praise the name
[2:08:31] of the Lord the word zeal
[2:08:34] there the Zeal of the house of the Lord
[2:08:37] it means
[2:08:39] order it comes
[2:08:42] from you know we say Adam
[2:08:47] Adam it means red Earth
[2:08:51] we take this
[2:08:53] word and we see that it talks about
[2:08:57] produ a color produced in face by Deep
[2:09:03] emotion ardor Zeal jealousy a jealous
[2:09:07] anger the Zeal of the Lord a jealous
[2:09:11] anger the Zeal of the house of the Lord
[2:09:14] a jealous anger to become dark
[2:09:18] red has anybody ever become dark red
[2:09:22] when they thought about what they could
[2:09:26] have I'm fixed to
[2:09:31] preach you're fixed to sleep it seems
[2:09:34] but I'm fixed to talk to you a little
[2:09:35] more
[2:09:36] here the Zeal of the Lord's House makes
[2:09:40] my face
[2:09:43] red it becomes jealous
[2:09:46] anger because we're not fighting for a
[2:09:48] building that's right we're fighting for
[2:09:51] a
[2:09:56] building this eaten me
[2:10:00] up it comes from a word akal which means
[2:10:04] to eat to devour to consume to burn up
[2:10:08] to feed it reminded me of something RJ
[2:10:11] said last Sunday uh uh concerning the
[2:10:14] the burnt offering it is regularly used
[2:10:16] in a metaphorical sense of describing
[2:10:18] the activity of fire that consumes or
[2:10:21] devours the burnt offering was consumed
[2:10:24] by fire in into ashes the fire ate up
[2:10:29] the
[2:10:30] sacrifice the Zeal the jealous anger
[2:10:34] that we should carry for this
[2:10:38] house to build him the right house to
[2:10:42] clean up the temple where we're asking
[2:10:44] him to live in it should overwhelm us it
[2:10:47] should sometimes turn our face red
[2:10:51] it should disturb our peace
[2:10:54] sometime it should eat us up like a fire
[2:10:57] burning in our bones like Jeremiah
[2:11:01] said Jesus was cleaning an Earthly
[2:11:04] Temple a and the Zeal that he had was to
[2:11:07] preserve the temple but it was more than
[2:11:10] that because he said I will tear it down
[2:11:13] and in three days raise it up this
[2:11:16] refers to his not the house but the
[2:11:21] house stay with me not the house but the
[2:11:26] house and this Zeal of the house of the
[2:11:30] Lord must also overwhelm us overtake us
[2:11:35] consume
[2:11:41] us we don't have
[2:11:44] time to see how far down the pin when in
[2:11:49] the slit we don't have time to examine
[2:11:53] someone
[2:11:56] else we don't have time to worry what
[2:12:00] everybody else is
[2:12:02] doing because we're consumed with the
[2:12:05] Zeal to build a
[2:12:08] house for the Lord to live in to dwell
[2:12:12] in your passion can't be self
[2:12:19] perservation your passion has to be
[2:12:22] Kingdom I've got to build the kingdom
[2:12:25] I've got to establish the kingdom and it
[2:12:27] doesn't start out it starts
[2:12:30] in I can't help build up the kingdom of
[2:12:34] God until I become a surrendered
[2:12:39] Kingdom I can't help others find a place
[2:12:43] where he has dominion over them until I
[2:12:46] can find the place
[2:12:51] I want you to put punch your neighbor in
[2:12:58] love 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20 I've got
[2:13:03] another
[2:13:06] hour some of you are not going to help
[2:13:10] anyway what know you not that your
[2:13:14] body not the church house
[2:13:19] on your body is the Temple of the Holy
[2:13:23] Ghost which is in
[2:13:26] you which ye have of God and ye are not
[2:13:29] your own for you are bought with a price
[2:13:34] therefore glorify God in your
[2:13:38] body and in your
[2:13:40] spirit which are
[2:13:46] Gods I'm going to make this quotation
[2:13:48] from the church age book
[2:13:51] although I can't find brother brandham
[2:13:54] saying this verse of scripture anywhere
[2:13:57] in the message of the
[2:13:59] hour it was used in the church age book
[2:14:04] well he said be zealous and
[2:14:07] repent now this false church has
[2:14:11] Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal
[2:14:16] has literally been that of the Jews John
[2:14:18] 2:17 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten
[2:14:21] me up but it is a wrong
[2:14:24] Zeal it is for the house of their own
[2:14:28] building that's right they're consumed
[2:14:32] in building a a house of
[2:14:35] clay of stone of wood they're they're
[2:14:40] consumed with rebuilding an Earthly
[2:14:43] temple they're consume but this is a
[2:14:47] false
[2:14:48] Zeal the most important Zeal to have is
[2:14:51] one for this house of the Lord somebody
[2:14:53] said that seems selfish no you you're
[2:14:56] not trying to to build up
[2:14:58] yourself for prideful reason you're
[2:15:01] trying to give him a house to live in
[2:15:05] one that's sold out one that's
[2:15:06] surrendered one that's
[2:15:09] obedient one that doesn't have time to
[2:15:11] criticize other
[2:15:17] folk be jealous of somebody else's suit
[2:15:25] it is for their own
[2:15:26] Creeds dogmas organizations their own
[2:15:30] righteousness they've put the word out
[2:15:32] for their own ideas they deposited the
[2:15:35] holy ghost that they deposed the Holy
[2:15:37] Ghost and made men into
[2:15:39] leaders they have put aside eternal life
[2:15:42] as a person and make it good works or
[2:15:44] even Church Conformity rather than good
[2:15:48] works but God is calling
[2:15:53] God is calling for another Zeal it is a
[2:15:56] Zeal to
[2:15:57] cry I want to hear you I am wrong I am
[2:16:03] wrong I've let everything else consume
[2:16:10] me I've wallowed in my
[2:16:14] pity I've desired sympathy
[2:16:21] but I'm wrong I need to be consumed
[2:16:25] eaten alive with a Zeal to make God a
[2:16:30] house
[2:16:33] Lord what is it that all these
[2:16:35] denominations are based on the claim
[2:16:37] that they are right now they all cannot
[2:16:39] be right in fact not one of them is
[2:16:42] right they're whed supplers full of dead
[2:16:45] men's bones they have no life they have
[2:16:47] no Vindication God has never made
[2:16:50] himself known in any
[2:16:52] organization they say they're right
[2:16:54] because they're the ones that are saying
[2:16:56] it but saying it does not make it
[2:17:02] so it works the same way in there in
[2:17:05] those little
[2:17:07] carefully
[2:17:11] crafted denominational non-
[2:17:16] denominations formed around the message
[2:17:21] they choose out their top 10
[2:17:24] preachers they make their own little
[2:17:27] non-denominational
[2:17:31] denomination they support each other's
[2:17:33] Youth Camp and youth
[2:17:36] banquet while deciding that no one in
[2:17:39] that's outside of their Circle has the
[2:17:42] word we're the only ones that have the
[2:17:44] word
[2:17:51] one preacher just recently said why they
[2:17:54] don't have the word there did you know
[2:17:56] they let the gifts operate on the
[2:18:01] floor brother brandom said I don't want
[2:18:04] to be guilty of preaching anything other
[2:18:06] than what Paul
[2:18:18] preached they need the vindicat thus
[2:18:21] sayith the Lord of
[2:18:22] God and they don't have it
[2:18:27] right I hear them sometime not not just
[2:18:30] denominations but non-denominational
[2:18:32] denominations I hear them sometimes
[2:18:34] talking about thus sayeth the Lord as
[2:18:36] though brother brandham had some kind of
[2:18:38] exclusive
[2:18:41] right to both the phrase and the
[2:18:45] action when in reality he said we
[2:18:48] shouldn't just say that
[2:18:52] but he said that little bride she will
[2:18:55] have thus saith the Lord and if she
[2:18:59] doesn't have that she will keep
[2:19:02] still well since brother brandom is no
[2:19:05] longer here to give us thus sayth the
[2:19:07] Lord we're going to have to depend on a
[2:19:09] supernatural God hello hello
[2:19:13] [Music]
[2:19:16] hello in the message the Queen of Sheba
[2:19:19] and I'm going to have to
[2:19:21] stop before too long because I'm think
[2:19:24] I'm you're losing uh uh the
[2:19:28] point in paragraph 67 he said but the
[2:19:32] thing of it is they they take the nation
[2:19:35] the things of the world who will be who
[2:19:37] will play this play with certain certain
[2:19:39] movie star a lot of people many people
[2:19:42] today church members Pentecostal people
[2:19:44] Baptist Presbyterians can tell you more
[2:19:46] about the movie Life on hello
[2:19:54] hello they can tell you more about the
[2:19:56] movie life than they can the Bible life
[2:19:59] they can tell you more about the movie
[2:20:03] life than the Bible
[2:20:07] life watch this more children can tell
[2:20:10] you about David Crockett forgive me
[2:20:13] you've got to understand that this was
[2:20:14] preached in
[2:20:16] 1960 today it would be Pokemon and
[2:20:19] Disney and
[2:20:29] I mean the hour has come that they have
[2:20:32] to include lesbians in
[2:20:38] cartoons so that everyone feels
[2:20:42] included my wouldn't it be wonderful to
[2:20:44] see an old uh Davey Crockett one more
[2:20:49] time when the world is
[2:20:52] so
[2:20:55] suckered or or even an old gunm smoke or
[2:20:58] some of them that but remember that's
[2:21:01] what that's what they had then brother
[2:21:03] Brandon was so upset he was so disturbed
[2:21:05] about I Love
[2:21:07] Lucy he could hardly sleep at
[2:21:11] night preaching over against I Love
[2:21:18] Lucy I'm just guessing in my mind that
[2:21:21] he must have
[2:21:27] seen he saw her with her cigarette in
[2:21:29] her mouth and her hot pants
[2:21:32] on and he must have seen and her ruby
[2:21:34] red lips and he must have seen that
[2:21:36] there was going to come a
[2:21:39] time that any decent person would have
[2:21:42] to fast forward
[2:21:45] something because they wouldn't show a
[2:21:47] peck on the cheek my goodness and when I
[2:21:51] was a little boy familyes on television
[2:21:54] the mom and dad slept in single
[2:22:00] beds Dennis the Menace and some of these
[2:22:04] shows that came on Mom and Dad each had
[2:22:06] a twin bed on the other side of the room
[2:22:09] so that no child would wonder how they
[2:22:11] got
[2:22:14] here and if they ask a St did it where
[2:22:19] are we now
[2:22:21] oh they know more about daav Crockett or
[2:22:24] Gunsmoke or or we could say today Disney
[2:22:28] and Marvel and all of the or some of
[2:22:31] them that that then they can about Jesus
[2:22:35] Christ is because that's what they're
[2:22:37] taught that's what they're taught that's
[2:22:39] what they're taught that's what they're
[2:22:41] taught that's what they're taught that's
[2:22:44] what they're
[2:22:45] taught in their homes
[2:22:50] you want me to
[2:22:52] do what you won't
[2:22:56] do and then talk about juvenile
[2:23:01] delinquency or it's
[2:23:04] quiet it's parent
[2:23:09] delinquency it's parent delinquency and
[2:23:11] church
[2:23:13] delinquency he said that's exactly right
[2:23:15] clergy delinquency of preaching the word
[2:23:17] and God working with the church
[2:23:19] confirming the word with sign following
[2:23:21] the preachers just won't preach
[2:23:23] it ananas and Safara living in the
[2:23:26] church on the side of the church and
[2:23:28] never called out all the while folks are
[2:23:31] lying to the Holy
[2:23:34] Ghost
[2:23:36] on well Pastor was just
[2:23:39] exaggerating it really wasn't that
[2:23:41] bad it was
[2:23:46] bad it was bad
[2:23:48] yeah you can tell that that if you want
[2:23:51] to but it was
[2:23:55] bad some of these things we're still
[2:23:57] recovering
[2:24:02] from ananas and Safara living in the
[2:24:05] church on the side of the church never
[2:24:06] called out and told their sins because
[2:24:08] they're the heaviest payers there is in
[2:24:10] the church some ananas with a great job
[2:24:13] can put $5,000 a year he could drink
[2:24:17] smoke gamble commit adultery and he can
[2:24:19] be deacon at the same time
[2:24:25] I struggle sometime to find a deacon
[2:24:27] because one of the requirements of a
[2:24:29] deacon is a a man that runs his
[2:24:31] household like it ought to be run who
[2:24:33] has authority over his wife and
[2:24:39] children that's what I'm struggling
[2:24:48] with but the church is got so bad
[2:24:51] they've got to have deacons so
[2:24:54] bad that they'll find the one giving the
[2:24:56] most
[2:24:57] money make him a deacon
[2:25:00] and not preach against his
[2:25:04] sin brother I'm telling you when the
[2:25:06] spirit of God comes into the church and
[2:25:08] tear the thing open and rip it out like
[2:25:10] he did when he come the other time to
[2:25:11] the temple money
[2:25:14] changers lovers of pleasure more than
[2:25:17] lovers of God truce Breakers false
[2:25:18] accusers in continent despisers of those
[2:25:21] that are good he High minded having a
[2:25:23] form of godliness but denying the power
[2:25:25] thereof from such turn away I'm quoting
[2:25:27] the scripture First Timothy
[2:25:29] 3 I hear them out
[2:25:36] there every now and again they say
[2:25:40] something to young people about skinny
[2:25:44] jeans we ought not to even have to say
[2:25:47] that that's right
[2:25:56] I heard
[2:25:58] that brother there from British Columbia
[2:26:00] preaching in
[2:26:02] Texas and heard him talk about it he
[2:26:05] said we dealt with it in my
[2:26:07] day he said you young people think
[2:26:10] skinny jeans is a new thing he said I
[2:26:12] used to see my brother get in the
[2:26:15] bathtub with hot water with his jeans on
[2:26:22] this man's not young of course he's had
[2:26:23] white hair for over 20 something years
[2:26:25] but he's not a young man and he's so
[2:26:28] he's going way back to his young days
[2:26:31] brother would get in the in the hot tub
[2:26:33] with his jeans on so they'd shrink up
[2:26:35] just right so they could be tight enough
[2:26:38] to
[2:26:45] wear I I thought that was I thought
[2:26:47] skinny jeans were kind of a new gay
[2:26:49] trend that had taken over the
[2:26:52] church I didn't know that it goes way
[2:26:56] back I knew they used to like to roll
[2:26:59] their cigarettes up in the sleeve of
[2:27:02] their white T-shirt I knew that but I
[2:27:05] didn't know that they would shrink them
[2:27:07] in the listen what you ought to know
[2:27:10] about something like that is it's a
[2:27:13] spirit and it manifests itself different
[2:27:16] ways for different days but it's the
[2:27:18] same kind of a spirit right
[2:27:21] it's the same spirit that make a uh one
[2:27:23] of you sisters do something Mighty
[2:27:26] strange with your
[2:27:28] hair at certain
[2:27:31] times going through certain things let
[2:27:33] me tell you something because you're
[2:27:35] going through something that that that
[2:27:37] ought not to make you want to go to
[2:27:39] church with bedroom
[2:27:44] hair I I have sometimes you just feel
[2:27:47] like you have to part somebody's hair to
[2:27:49] talk to them
[2:27:52] Spirit gets on folks but the reality is
[2:27:56] folks the problem is so much
[2:27:58] deeper than a short
[2:28:01] skirt it's so much deeper than that so
[2:28:04] if all we do is preach against those
[2:28:06] little things like some people want you
[2:28:08] to do if all we do is just preach
[2:28:10] against that and we don't ever talk
[2:28:11] about the deeper issue that that causes
[2:28:14] us to yield to those kinds of spirits
[2:28:16] we're we're always going to be cheaters
[2:28:18] and fudgers and and and the Zeal of the
[2:28:21] house of the Lord is going to leave
[2:28:25] us we're going to be worried about
[2:28:27] fixing somebody else's
[2:28:29] church and not worried about fixing our
[2:28:32] church come
[2:28:35] on when you see those things taking
[2:28:37] place in those hour We're living the
[2:28:39] sincerity the church ought to be in yet
[2:28:41] just fabulous you go down here at the
[2:28:43] market or go tonight for dinner watch
[2:28:45] this and they set you out a bowl of soup
[2:28:47] and a big spids in it
[2:28:50] well some of you'd
[2:28:52] scream no
[2:28:58] names some of you wouldn't be like the
[2:29:00] little missionary
[2:29:02] lady they said dear husband said deer
[2:29:06] there's a fly in your soup they were
[2:29:08] missionaries they lived on the field for
[2:29:11] ever they come home Furlow and he said
[2:29:14] dear there's a fly in your soup she said
[2:29:16] oh he said you used to really get upset
[2:29:19] about bugs she said well we're
[2:29:22] missionaries now and he won't eat
[2:29:25] much the fly the
[2:29:31] fly no wonder you're not getting
[2:29:35] me she said oh don't worry about it he
[2:29:37] won't eat much you got it now the
[2:29:43] fly you go down to the place get you a
[2:29:46] bowl of soup a big spider in it well you
[2:29:48] want to sue the company
[2:29:52] certainly a fly is in it you would why
[2:29:54] you'd call the waitress and ball her out
[2:29:56] like everything and yet you'll walk
[2:29:59] right around and take some man-made
[2:30:01] Theology and push it down your throat
[2:30:03] join the church and that's all you have
[2:30:05] to do come on come on wouldn't eat a
[2:30:09] bowl of soup that a spider was in but
[2:30:11] swallow
[2:30:13] lies in the name of God except a man be
[2:30:17] born again he can no wise enter
[2:30:21] is that the word can no wise enter the
[2:30:24] kingdom there signs these signs will
[2:30:27] follow them after they're born again see
[2:30:29] that's what Jesus said that brings the
[2:30:31] mark of Distinction to the church the
[2:30:33] signs and wonders of the resurrected
[2:30:35] living Christ Living in the church he
[2:30:39] said they don't want it
[2:30:41] today that's simply because they're not
[2:30:46] consumed with the Zeal of the house of
[2:30:49] the Lord
[2:30:52] I'll have to take this up another
[2:30:55] time but I'll take a few more
[2:31:00] minutes I want to tell you what he
[2:31:03] said the time has
[2:31:07] come to cleanse the temple of
[2:31:10] God it's not the Refuge it's not the
[2:31:14] it's not the land it's not the
[2:31:18] house it's us
[2:31:22] he's been working on us now for a long
[2:31:25] time he's not through with us
[2:31:30] yet he can't accomplish in us what he
[2:31:33] desires to accomplish in us if we keep
[2:31:35] making excuses for where we are is that
[2:31:39] right are you with me now for a few more
[2:31:42] moments I'm going to say some
[2:31:44] uncomfortable things
[2:31:53] there's been at least four
[2:31:58] times that this
[2:32:02] church has been tested and
[2:32:06] tried as a faith family as a church
[2:32:12] body things that could have
[2:32:16] easily destroyed us
[2:32:21] there have been many
[2:32:24] battles and some
[2:32:29] Wars there would be too numerous to
[2:32:34] name but the spirit of
[2:32:37] God
[2:32:39] highlighted to me last night four four
[2:32:42] things
[2:32:50] we had a church
[2:32:52] split in
[2:32:57] 1997 it was
[2:33:00] vicious it was sad it was
[2:33:06] vile sometimes newcomers ask us to
[2:33:09] describe it and we I I I lack the words
[2:33:13] I lack the
[2:33:17] vocabulary I don't even know how to tell
[2:33:19] you what happened
[2:33:21] happened I just know it
[2:33:23] happened it was a
[2:33:26] spirit got a hold of a
[2:33:30] woman
[2:33:32] who like me needed her Temple
[2:33:38] cleaned but instead she yielded to a
[2:33:41] spirit it was jealousy it was
[2:33:45] envy and it worked its way through a
[2:33:48] family
[2:33:52] splitting a
[2:33:56] church it was
[2:33:59] devastating it was
[2:34:02] hard
[2:34:06] days many of us wanted to
[2:34:10] die we felt
[2:34:12] betrayed we felt
[2:34:17] forsaken we felt
[2:34:21] scrutinized and no one could give us
[2:34:24] answers we're living it and no one could
[2:34:28] even tell
[2:34:29] us what was really going
[2:34:33] on how you can be a friend one moment
[2:34:38] and a mortal enemy the
[2:34:43] next how you can go from a
[2:34:47] deacon saying I'll
[2:34:50] punch anybody in the
[2:34:52] face that crosses you brother
[2:34:55] Shelly because you're God's
[2:34:59] man who later getting under the
[2:35:03] influence of that spirit and
[2:35:06] saying I have a gun in my automobile and
[2:35:09] I would
[2:35:13] gladly shoot him I'll just say it that
[2:35:16] way but it would be too quick
[2:35:20] I'd rather watch him
[2:35:23] suffer someone said what is the
[2:35:26] accusation that would cause you to be so
[2:35:28] mad that you'd want to shoot
[2:35:32] somebody he said he just doesn't have
[2:35:35] any fruit of the spirit in his
[2:35:39] life normal folk don't talk like that
[2:35:43] you don't say I want to kill somebody
[2:35:46] because you don't have no fruit of the
[2:35:47] spirit
[2:35:49] when you're wanting to kill
[2:35:52] somebody only Devils talk only Spirits
[2:35:56] only demons talk like that come on
[2:36:00] folks sane men and women don't talk like
[2:36:05] that we watch that same Spirit come two
[2:36:09] other
[2:36:10] times to try to destroy this
[2:36:13] church both of those times through men
[2:36:16] and their influence
[2:36:20] God was
[2:36:22] gracious his Mercy his grace his
[2:36:26] goodness brought us through it was a
[2:36:29] test and there were times that we were
[2:36:31] losing and failing it and there were
[2:36:34] times that we were passing
[2:36:36] it but we can now on the other side of
[2:36:39] it say it was his grace and
[2:36:42] mercy who brought us
[2:36:45] through some years later we were tested
[2:36:48] on issues like marriage and
[2:36:53] divorce troubled
[2:36:55] me so
[2:37:00] deeply all we can say is what the word
[2:37:03] says that's all we can
[2:37:06] say but God finally gave peace by saying
[2:37:10] it's a
[2:37:12] test and you've got to come through
[2:37:15] it you've got to pass this test
[2:37:20] ultimately God is the
[2:37:25] judge and you would
[2:37:28] be an ostrich with your head in the
[2:37:32] sand to say that it hasn't
[2:37:36] been a tremendous
[2:37:39] help to a
[2:37:41] family
[2:37:45] unbelievable in God's hands
[2:37:50] I said I I couldn't come to a
[2:37:54] wedding but when it's
[2:37:57] over if you need a place to go to
[2:38:00] church we're here how could I say that
[2:38:04] went against everything I I stood
[2:38:06] for when the Lord said it's a
[2:38:09] test I'm going to see how you come
[2:38:12] through it well he already knew you
[2:38:14] know then I knew that's what I had to do
[2:38:19] was quite criticized at times still
[2:38:23] misunderstood along the way about it but
[2:38:25] it's all right it's in God's
[2:38:34] hands and then in
[2:38:37] 2014 we came through one of the darkest
[2:38:40] times there was a financial breach and a
[2:38:43] betrayal in our
[2:38:46] church in many ways in most most ways we
[2:38:50] have come through
[2:38:52] it and
[2:38:55] recovered but there are still some
[2:38:58] times that it
[2:39:01] affects some of
[2:39:05] us but God's grace and
[2:39:09] mercy brought us through the
[2:39:12] 97 brought us through the other brought
[2:39:15] us through the 2014
[2:39:19] I think it's when I hear
[2:39:22] rumors that people sometimes say behind
[2:39:25] my back it wasn't as bad as he
[2:39:29] said he exaggerated it I think those are
[2:39:33] the
[2:39:34] times that it knocks the wind out of
[2:39:39] me because that's simply not the
[2:39:43] truth but it was God's
[2:39:46] grace and mercy
[2:39:50] that brought us through marriage
[2:39:55] intact life moves
[2:39:58] on God is
[2:40:00] good could have killed
[2:40:12] us but it
[2:40:16] didn't and then recently
[2:40:21] never in a million
[2:40:24] years did I ever think that we would
[2:40:27] have someone in our community to leave
[2:40:32] us so
[2:40:34] unexpected and at their own
[2:40:40] hand
[2:40:42] never
[2:40:46] expected it's in these times when
[2:40:50] even prophetic people
[2:40:53] feel very
[2:40:56] unprop more pathetic than
[2:41:02] prophetic but God's grace and
[2:41:07] mercy brings us
[2:41:12] through love
[2:41:14] shines Jesus
[2:41:17] shines people rise to the top
[2:41:22] St they keep pressing in holding up
[2:41:26] their
[2:41:27] head because God's grace and
[2:41:30] mercy gets us through is that right I'm
[2:41:34] almost done is that
[2:41:37] right but don't ever think that we've
[2:41:40] done it because we had good
[2:41:42] leadership in the
[2:41:45] natural it's only because our
[2:41:52] Captain thank Lord has led us hallelujah
[2:41:57] thank you Lord hallelujah he has he does
[2:42:02] he still
[2:42:03] is but if we've done one thing
[2:42:07] right if we've got anything
[2:42:12] right it's
[2:42:14] this
[2:42:17] Colossians chapter
[2:42:24] 2 Verse 18 and
[2:42:27] 19 let no man begal you of your reward
[2:42:31] in a voluntary humility and worshiping
[2:42:34] of angels intruding into those things
[2:42:38] which he hath not seen vainly puffed up
[2:42:42] by his fleshly mind and not
[2:42:47] holding the head
[2:42:52] nobody cares about your dream your
[2:42:54] vision your word your prophecy your
[2:42:56] feeling your unction your inspiration
[2:42:59] your if you're not holding to his
[2:43:03] head nobody cares about your praise your
[2:43:07] amen your sermonette your anointed
[2:43:11] song If you're not holding to his head
[2:43:14] am anybody with me it's only by holding
[2:43:19] to his
[2:43:20] head that we can keep our
[2:43:23] head above the Waters of life it's only
[2:43:27] by holding to his head that we can keep
[2:43:31] our heads above the
[2:43:33] fanaticism that surrounds the leodan
[2:43:36] message the message sent to this church
[2:43:39] age it's only by grace and mercy and
[2:43:42] holding on to Christ the head from which
[2:43:45] all the body by joints and bands having
[2:43:48] Nour nment ministered and knit together
[2:43:53] increaseth oh
[2:43:55] Hallelujah with the increase of
[2:43:58] God if you turn loose of his head you've
[2:44:05] lost nobody can hold his head for
[2:44:11] you nobody can hold on to him for
[2:44:15] you it's only when you realize that he
[2:44:18] is holding
[2:44:20] you that's why you can hold
[2:44:23] him if he were to ever Turn You Loose
[2:44:26] you don't possess enough Faith to hold
[2:44:29] on to him so what is it that brought us
[2:44:33] through many dangers and troubles and
[2:44:35] trial
[2:44:36] Grace
[2:44:38] Grace somebody say
[2:44:41] grace it's only Grace I need I need some
[2:44:44] more water
[2:44:51] nearly
[2:44:54] done in
[2:44:58] 2010 I had an experience with four
[2:45:02] angels all the fans of my dreams and
[2:45:07] Visions who like to mock us will
[2:45:10] certainly enjoy this
[2:45:15] one the only rebuke I got over this
[2:45:18] experience was from brother Perry
[2:45:21] green he rebuked me because he came to a
[2:45:24] conference where where while I was
[2:45:26] sharing it and I said it was an
[2:45:29] experience and when I was speaking at
[2:45:32] his
[2:45:33] church I said it was a
[2:45:36] dream and he said brother Shelley you
[2:45:39] dumbed that down for message folks
[2:45:41] didn't
[2:45:42] you I said
[2:45:44] yes he said I would have rather you
[2:45:47] just said it was an experience cuz when
[2:45:51] I heard it I knew it
[2:45:54] was I saw four Angels coming toward me
[2:45:57] and I knew that they were coming to help
[2:45:59] me with some sort of assignment or task
[2:46:02] that I had been given in the spirit and
[2:46:04] as they drew closer one of them spoke to
[2:46:07] me and said we have come to help you
[2:46:09] with your very serious assignment and
[2:46:11] you in turn must help
[2:46:15] others I quickly asked what the nature
[2:46:18] of the assignment was another of the
[2:46:20] Angels answered by saying we are here to
[2:46:22] help you to hold to the Lord's
[2:46:29] head I said I'm not sure what you
[2:46:32] mean the third Angel explained that the
[2:46:35] bride must hold fast to the Lord's
[2:46:40] head like never
[2:46:43] before I said how will we do this and
[2:46:47] the first angel said in
[2:46:50] hope the second angel said in honor yes
[2:46:54] the third angel
[2:46:55] said in
[2:46:58] Holiness and the fourth angel said in
[2:47:01] humility each Angel then proceeded to
[2:47:04] give simple instructions on how we would
[2:47:06] carry out the
[2:47:09] assignment God said I'm going to restore
[2:47:13] hope where hope has been deferred or
[2:47:16] where hope has been lost I'm going to
[2:47:19] give my people Faith to hope against
[2:47:22] hope to hold on to my head even when it
[2:47:25] looks
[2:47:26] hopeless when there seems to be no hope
[2:47:30] they're going to hold on to
[2:47:32] me in
[2:47:36] hope in
[2:47:39] honor I'm going to bring both favor and
[2:47:43] promotion to my bride it's time to bring
[2:47:46] honor home to make it personal not just
[2:47:49] with lip service but with our hearts
[2:47:52] it's hard to honor somebody when you're
[2:47:54] so jealous and so envious of them you
[2:47:57] can hardly stand it you watch every move
[2:48:00] they
[2:48:02] make it's a time to honor those that the
[2:48:04] Lord has connected us with and follow
[2:48:08] their
[2:48:09] example and I I'm not going to preach
[2:48:11] this message I'm looking through the
[2:48:12] sermon
[2:48:14] notes thirdly in holiness
[2:48:18] and he gave me Exodus
[2:48:20] 19-6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of
[2:48:23] priests a holy nation consecrated set
[2:48:26] apart to the worship of God these are
[2:48:28] the words you shall speak to the
[2:48:32] Israelites it's through Holiness it's
[2:48:34] not through worldliness it's not through
[2:48:37] compromise it's through Holiness that we
[2:48:41] can hold on to him and fourthly humility
[2:48:44] not proud or hoty not
[2:48:46] pretentious unassuming
[2:48:50] sometimes almost
[2:48:53] insignificant did you know brother
[2:48:54] brandom said sometimes you could be too
[2:48:59] humble and the enemy will run you all
[2:49:02] over
[2:49:03] town sometimes youve got to Plat your
[2:49:05] whip right that's what he
[2:49:08] said sometimes you've got to Plat your
[2:49:10] whip and tell the devil one of us is
[2:49:13] getting out of
[2:49:15] here and it's not going to be me I'm G
[2:49:19] to hold the
[2:49:20] head let's stand musicians are
[2:49:23] coming not nearly
[2:49:25] done but I'm worn out totally
[2:49:33] exhausted we are in a critical
[2:49:39] moment critical
[2:49:44] moment we're on the precipice
[2:49:55] you can
[2:49:56] expect that the enemy is going to throw
[2:49:58] every
[2:49:59] distraction possible your
[2:50:06] way it's going to be up to
[2:50:12] you instead of letting life consume
[2:50:16] you if we lay our head on his
[2:50:21] chest until we can hear the heartbeat of
[2:50:24] the
[2:50:25] Lord worship is not just about singing
[2:50:28] it's not just about raising our
[2:50:32] hands worship is sometimes about
[2:50:38] listening to his
[2:50:42] heartbeat the bride wants to know what
[2:50:47] causes the Lord's heartbeat to LEAP to
[2:50:50] speed
[2:50:52] up because that's what we want to
[2:50:57] do we want to please
[2:51:00] him we want to Plat a whip and drive out
[2:51:06] everything of our life that is not
[2:51:13] him I give you a little permission
[2:51:19] to be a little
[2:51:21] selfish in a moment like
[2:51:26] this it can be very distracting trying
[2:51:29] to help
[2:51:30] others it is what we are called to do as
[2:51:33] a
[2:51:34] body but there are times that we have
[2:51:38] nothing to
[2:51:46] give Nancy would
[2:51:50] because of the way she was
[2:51:55] trained she was taught to lean into the
[2:51:58] Lord
[2:52:00] and she
[2:52:01] could give anybody a
[2:52:05] word and most of the time it would be
[2:52:09] very helpful and very accurate and and
[2:52:12] and amazing
[2:52:15] but we trained her a little differently
[2:52:20] because there comes a time
[2:52:24] that you're not always going to get a
[2:52:28] word I know we have some groupies
[2:52:33] here who are sort of positioning
[2:52:37] themselves
[2:52:39] always to hear a
[2:52:44] word it's kind of a dangerous thing
[2:52:51] if we're not completely
[2:52:54] Sanctified including our
[2:52:58] imagination because this little bride
[2:53:01] cannot
[2:53:02] afford to get our marching
[2:53:07] orders from any other
[2:53:10] Paradigm it's got to be the heartbeat of
[2:53:13] the
[2:53:14] Lord and listen what makes this
[2:53:16] heartbeat in my life might be different
[2:53:19] what I'm required to do may be different
[2:53:22] than what you're required to do so you
[2:53:24] can't watch me and only emulate what I
[2:53:26] do I can't just watch you and emulate
[2:53:29] what you do but we've got to find a way
[2:53:31] to shut out the
[2:53:35] rest your answers are not on
[2:53:40] YouTube your answers are in your prayer
[2:53:44] closet your answers are in prayer in the
[2:53:47] word yes that's where your answer is
[2:53:49] going to come
[2:53:53] always God will use this body to
[2:53:56] encourage each other and God will use us
[2:53:58] to give words of inspiration at times
[2:54:02] and we're thankful for the giftings of
[2:54:05] the body but there is a time when we
[2:54:07] just simply need to plug into him
[2:54:20] there is a meat that we need to partake
[2:54:22] of yes we can't eat the meat of
[2:54:26] obedience until we have an ear to hear
[2:54:30] his
[2:54:31] instruction are you with me
[2:54:34] yes are we going to make
[2:54:38] it are you kidding we made it that's
[2:54:42] right we made
[2:54:45] it somebody say what do you we made it
[2:54:50] it the Overcomer garment is already
[2:54:54] secured and laid aside for
[2:54:58] you sure you're going to make
[2:55:01] it but not by leaning on your own
[2:55:05] understanding
[2:55:07] hello only by holding on to his head
[2:55:22] marriage doesn't
[2:55:24] fix every
[2:55:29] problem before you drag somebody else
[2:55:32] into your
[2:55:35] problem seek God
[2:55:40] now find Deliverance
[2:55:43] now get help
[2:55:45] now let him set you free
[2:55:48] now come on
[2:55:52] folks the spirit of
[2:55:55] lust will destroy
[2:55:58] lives it'll destroy
[2:56:09] relationships betrayal is hard to deal
[2:56:11] with in
[2:56:14] marriage but we're living in a in an
[2:56:17] hour now where the Betrayal is not
[2:56:19] always blond-headed and long-legged
[2:56:26] sometimes it's just a pocket
[2:56:32] device I was talking with someone not
[2:56:35] too long ago and I said when I was a
[2:56:37] teenager pornography wasn't easily
[2:56:44] accessible you had to risk everything
[2:56:48] I sort of wished it was that way
[2:56:51] again you had to risk everything
[2:56:54] brother you had to go to magic Market or
[2:56:57] whatever they had and you had to be
[2:57:00] willing to ask somebody to get
[2:57:02] it from behind the
[2:57:06] stand or you had to find one of those
[2:57:08] smudy places or you could just walk in
[2:57:11] and buy
[2:57:16] it but you had
[2:57:18] you know kind of duck and dart
[2:57:21] and not so
[2:57:26] anymore it's Wi-Fi right into your
[2:57:31] home both men and women can
[2:57:35] struggle it sets you up
[2:57:40] for an impossible
[2:57:44] situation you need to Plat a whip
[2:57:49] you need to make up your
[2:57:53] mind I told someone recently I'm not
[2:57:56] going to counsel any more couples for
[2:58:01] marriage of a certain
[2:58:04] age without really talking about the
[2:58:08] nitty-gritties
[2:58:12] somebody just simply has
[2:58:16] to there is an epidemic
[2:58:20] of this lustful pornography
[2:58:23] spirit in our world today in our church
[2:58:27] World it stinks it's filthy I can sense
[2:58:31] it sometime and
[2:58:33] nearly nearly smell it
[2:58:37] sometime it's
[2:58:39] vile you do not have to be bound
[2:58:50] you don't have to eat the whole
[2:58:55] cake you don't deserve the whole
[2:58:59] cake it's the same kind of
[2:59:02] addiction the enemy will tell you you've
[2:59:05] worked hard you deserve a glance you
[2:59:07] deserve
[2:59:09] something it's a lie from hell right I
[2:59:12] know it's
[2:59:14] quiet we've got to be consumed
[2:59:18] with something
[2:59:20] more than the SMUD of this world that's
[2:59:26] right it's the Zeal of building God a
[2:59:32] house we don't want to we don't want to
[2:59:35] you know heal the sick and raise the
[2:59:37] dead just so we can say we've done it we
[2:59:41] want to do it because it's the heart of
[2:59:43] God he's still a Healer he's still a
[2:59:46] deliverer he wants to help us he wants
[2:59:50] signs and wonders to follow the Holy
[2:59:52] Ghost fill bride of Jesus Christ he
[2:59:55] wants of people that prove him to be
[2:59:58] Hebrews 13 and8 on a regular basis in
[3:00:02] order to do that we're going to have to
[3:00:04] be consumed we're going to have to be
[3:00:07] eaten
[3:00:09] up by the Zeal not of the physical House
[3:00:12] of our own
[3:00:16] building driven with a
[3:00:21] passion oh God I don't want anything to
[3:00:25] to arrest
[3:00:26] [Music]
[3:00:28] me other than
[3:00:32] you I don't want food to control my life
[3:00:37] I don't want lust to control my life
[3:00:39] jealousy to oh God I want to be wrapped
[3:00:43] up tied up tangled up with a passion
[3:00:48] to build up a
[3:00:51] house that you can come and take full
[3:00:57] occupancy full manifestation of the word
[3:01:02] full creative spoken word
[3:01:04] Authority come
[3:01:07] on we are not waiting on brother brandom
[3:01:10] to come in a airplane and a tent to
[3:01:12] bring it to us he's done all that he can
[3:01:16] do to help us it's just you and Jesus
[3:01:20] now the word has made him real to us
[3:01:23] again you need to go in with him
[3:01:30] right few weeks
[3:01:32] ago in a Saturday when that awful phone
[3:01:36] call
[3:01:40] came I was putting the final touches on
[3:01:43] a message that I was going to preach
[3:01:44] that night
[3:01:52] was going to carry the theme
[3:01:55] forward to his company threes a
[3:01:59] crowd and finish with the image of the
[3:02:06] Prophet we
[3:02:08] cannot let
[3:02:10] Daniel have the
[3:02:15] preeminence he was just a servant
[3:02:18] and even if the king listen listen we're
[3:02:22] we're
[3:02:23] here we're in that
[3:02:26] Kingdom because we've got a president
[3:02:32] elect who's far from
[3:02:40] righteous and he's not our
[3:02:42] answer thank God thank God for helping
[3:02:45] us but he's not the answer that Daniel
[3:02:48] wasn't the answer it was the god of
[3:02:54] Daniel brother brandham said the king
[3:02:56] made an image not of
[3:02:59] himself but of
[3:03:02] Daniel and commanded the people to Bow
[3:03:05] Down and Worship the image of Daniel the
[3:03:09] Prophet but there were three little boys
[3:03:12] young men who said oh Daniel has been
[3:03:17] our brother
[3:03:19] we love him like no other there's not
[3:03:21] but one
[3:03:22] Daniel we like to eat with him we like
[3:03:25] to joke with him we like to we like to
[3:03:28] Camp with him we we just want to spend
[3:03:30] as much time with him as possible but we
[3:03:32] know that he just has feet of Flesh and
[3:03:35] he's just a sinner that's saved by grace
[3:03:37] and we can't let him have preeminence in
[3:03:40] our life so I'm sorry but we won't be
[3:03:42] able to bow to the
[3:03:44] image we love him too much there's going
[3:03:48] to be a
[3:03:49] bride who sees the decreasing of John
[3:03:52] the Baptist and the increasing of the
[3:03:56] Messiah who says we love a we love the
[3:03:59] prophet that God has sent too
[3:04:02] much to make him as they say more than a
