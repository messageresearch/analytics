[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:22] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right twiced in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:03] Shelley and I'm coming to you again
[1:05] today from New Hope revival ministries
[1:08] in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming
[1:11] today in partnership with the gospel
[1:14] channel I'm so grateful to the Lord for
[1:17] giving us this opportunity to continue
[1:20] in the word with you in a series that
[1:23] we've been working on for some time
[1:25] we started on schemes and devices of the
[1:30] enemy and then we transitioned into
[1:33] demonic doorways we've been getting a
[1:36] tremendous amount of response I think
[1:38] it's because people can relate to being
[1:41] in the heat of the battle but I want to
[1:44] remind you today that no matter how hot
[1:47] the battle gets no matter how intense
[1:50] the warfare seems in your life
[1:53] Jesus is the victor Yeshua our Messiah
[1:56] has won the victory and because of his
[2:01] victory we can have the victory because
[2:05] he overcame the world he gives us grace
[2:09] he grants us the strength to also
[2:13] overcome any obstacle or any attack that
[2:17] the enemy would try to use against us in
[2:20] this hour one of the ways we know that
[2:23] you have been able to relate to the
[2:25] program's lately it's because of your
[2:28] tremendous response and this is a folder
[2:32] and these on top are the most recent
[2:35] prayer requests that have come in and I
[2:39] would say 99% of them 98% 99% of them
[2:44] have come in from the television
[2:47] broadcast which is so encouraging to us
[2:50] we have some correspondents through the
[2:54] website and contacts that we have around
[2:57] the world but lately the majority of
[2:59] these requests have come from those of
[3:03] you who watched the program and some
[3:06] call back and some feel
[3:10] comfortable enough to share really
[3:13] sometimes the details and the struggle
[3:17] that they're going through and and I
[3:19] believe it's because somehow you have
[3:22] sensed through the program that we care
[3:25] about you I I always so I often let me
[3:30] say it this way I often feel
[3:32] insufficient in many many areas of
[3:35] ministry but there's one area that I
[3:38] really don't feel insufficient in
[3:40] because it's shaped my life and that is
[3:43] in the arena of Prayer
[3:46] I learned as a small boy serving the
[3:50] Lord and with a precious praying granny
[3:52] I learned the power of prayer and prayer
[3:56] changes things and so it is a great
[3:59] honor and a great privilege for all of
[4:02] us at New Hope revival ministries to
[4:05] join with you over your prayer needs so
[4:08] some call and some send in emails and we
[4:13] even get an occasional letter in the
[4:15] mail and we just want to be in contact
[4:18] with you I don't think I mentioned
[4:20] lately maybe the last couple of
[4:22] broadcasts that if you miss an episode
[4:25] especially if we're doing a series and
[4:28] you miss an episode all you have to do
[4:32] is look for us on YouTube we have a
[4:35] youtube channel that is growing and it
[4:38] is expanding in fact if you will just
[4:41] click a button that says subscribe then
[4:44] you'll have an opportunity to be updated
[4:46] and notified when we add new programming
[4:49] new materials not only can you watch the
[4:53] programs that we do for the gospel
[4:55] channel but you can also see other
[4:59] encouraging bits and pieces of what the
[5:03] Lord has called us to do there there's
[5:06] some music there there are there's one
[5:09] section that's rather new that I think
[5:12] you might be blessed by and it's called
[5:14] new hope moments and it's just very
[5:16] short clips that are taken out of live
[5:20] services here at the River
[5:22] sinner and I think and I believe that
[5:26] God is using them to encourage people
[5:29] they're getting shared they're getting
[5:31] out there and we're getting feedback
[5:33] that says you know sometimes when I
[5:36] can't listen to an entire sermon well I
[5:39] can click on new hope moments and I can
[5:41] catch something that's inspirational and
[5:44] and truly that's part of what we want to
[5:47] do is to encourage you and to inspire
[5:50] you there is a lot of bad news there's a
[5:54] lot of darkness there's a lot of
[5:55] ugliness that goes on around us in the
[5:58] hour that we're living in and so if we
[6:01] can find something that reminds us to
[6:04] look to Jesus to go to the word for our
[6:06] strength and for our help then by all
[6:09] means we need more of that in our life
[6:11] so I invite you and strongly encourage
[6:15] you to visit our youtube channel also
[6:18] our website revival dot org it's a real
[6:22] joy to be able to hear what the Lord is
[6:25] doing around the world in this late hour
[6:28] I believe the hour is late I believe
[6:31] that we're living in the last of the
[6:33] last days and I believe that it's a good
[6:38] thing it really is a good thing because
[6:40] we have now come to the hour where I
[6:43] believe that God desires to have
[6:46] relationship with his people and in a
[6:50] way that I think we could almost say an
[6:52] unprecedented way because we need him we
[6:56] are depending on him for our help and
[7:00] our strength you know the church well
[7:03] she got sort of puffed up and pride
[7:05] through the years through the great
[7:08] waves of revival and she began to be
[7:11] maybe a little overly confident and she
[7:15] began to build her structures and her
[7:17] programs and maybe well not maybe let me
[7:21] be honest let me be Who I am
[7:23] she began to trust in those things just
[7:26] like Israel in the Bible we read about
[7:30] how God miraculously super
[7:32] naturally moved for the children of
[7:36] Israel time and time again and even
[7:40] throughout the prophets of the Old
[7:41] Testament how that they would rehearse
[7:44] before the people the goodnesses of God
[7:48] to the nation of Israel but so many
[7:51] times the rebuke would follow you began
[7:54] to trust in these things you began to
[7:57] feel like that the power was in your
[7:59] hand and the strength was in your hand
[8:01] you begin to mix yourself with other
[8:03] gods and you begin to feel invincible by
[8:06] yourself and so this brought great
[8:09] turmoil and great heartache upon the
[8:12] children of Israel the nation of Israel
[8:15] down through the years it seems like the
[8:17] same thing happened in the church world
[8:20] there there they came to a place where
[8:23] they were seeing great prosperity and
[8:26] these waves of revival were coming in
[8:29] the ebbs and flows and more people were
[8:33] interested and engaged and so forth and
[8:36] and so more structure had to had to
[8:39] follow and more programs and more
[8:43] seeker-sensitive christianity and let's
[8:47] don't rock the boat let's don't say
[8:49] anything that might offend somebody in
[8:51] their sin and the next thing you know
[8:54] Jesus is standing you've heard us say
[8:56] this here before Jesus is standing on
[9:00] the outside of his own church the Church
[9:03] of Laodicea knocking on the door let me
[9:07] in let me in If any man would would let
[9:11] me in open the door I would come in and
[9:14] sup with him and he with me and this is
[9:17] the hour this is the season of the
[9:20] Lord's Supper of the Lord's
[9:23] fellowshipping he desires to come in to
[9:26] have you and I to close the door as he
[9:29] enters in we closed the door behind him
[9:32] and we sit down and we fellowship with
[9:35] who he is sometimes in that moment we
[9:39] can't ask for another thing because
[9:42] we're so overwhelmed with the goodness
[9:45] God all that he would come all that he
[9:49] would acknowledge me or that he would
[9:52] desire to have fellowship with me we get
[9:55] overwhelmed in the Lord's choosing I
[9:58] want you to know the Bible is clear he
[10:01] chose me before I ever had the
[10:03] opportunity to say yes to him
[10:05] thanks be to God he said yes to me he
[10:10] called me he claimed me as his own and
[10:13] I'm just blessed I'm blessed because I
[10:16] was able to recognize that call as a
[10:19] small boy and dedicate the biggest
[10:22] portion of my life to him but maybe
[10:24] you're in your elder years you're in
[10:27] your senior years and you have not yet
[10:30] responded to the call of the Lord in
[10:32] your life and you're just overwhelmed
[10:36] with your position in life right now let
[10:39] me tell you there is a friend that
[10:41] sticketh closer than a brother there is
[10:44] someone who desires to have fellowship
[10:47] with you and to have you to want to have
[10:51] fellowship with him that we would depend
[10:54] on him that we would not trust in our
[10:58] own strength but that we would say Oh
[11:00] Lord we can't do it without you I pray
[11:03] that the church around the world would
[11:06] have once again recognized as an entity
[11:09] as a body we can't do this without the
[11:12] Lord how vain it is for us to even try
[11:16] how prideful it is for us to assume that
[11:22] we can do church without the one who
[11:25] loves the church without the one who
[11:27] gave himself for the church and yet we
[11:31] we do it it happens so may the Lord just
[11:35] stir us and may we respond to the
[11:39] stirring of the Lord let me thank you
[11:41] again for your time with us and though
[11:45] there are many people who say I never
[11:48] miss an episode and we have people who
[11:51] say when I when I turn it on and it
[11:54] seems to be a repeat of the program for
[11:57] the week
[11:57] I often sit and watch the whole thing
[12:00] again because I don't want to miss
[12:03] anything well I can't even tell you what
[12:06] that means to us I don't have words to
[12:09] express to you enough how much we
[12:11] appreciate your dedication and your
[12:14] faithfulness to us and I just pray that
[12:17] we can continue to be a help to you on
[12:20] your journey for the Lord so part three
[12:23] of demonic doorways that's what we're
[12:26] going to talk about today when we left
[12:29] you the last time I don't usually say
[12:32] this but I had on a bright red shirt so
[12:35] maybe you will remember that as part two
[12:38] because I mentioned that because we had
[12:42] an interview that played the week after
[12:45] that and so if you have forgotten the
[12:48] order again go to youtube and you can
[12:51] you can check that out but when we were
[12:53] together the last time we were talking
[12:56] about the three phases of falling short
[13:02] of the glory of God the Bible tells us
[13:06] that really this is the definition of
[13:09] sin for all have sinned for all have
[13:13] come short of the glory of God but there
[13:16] seems to be what the scripture defines
[13:20] as progression in the area of falling
[13:25] just how far away from God and from his
[13:29] glory are we falling at the present
[13:32] moment and and what are the influences
[13:36] what are the things around us that we
[13:39] yield to can we recognize that there are
[13:43] even demon spirits that are assigned to
[13:48] push us farther and farther away from
[13:50] the glory of God if we can recognize
[13:53] some of these things then we can come
[13:56] and submit them we can we can plunge
[13:59] them beneath the redemptive blood of the
[14:03] Lord Jesus Christ and we can be set free
[14:07] from these influences I believe that you
[14:11] and I
[14:11] have the power through the truth through
[14:15] what God has already done for us and by
[14:19] accepting that and fellowshipping that
[14:21] with faith I believe we can shut down
[14:23] the devil's voice in our life you know I
[14:27] might not be able to shut him down in
[14:28] your head but I believe I can have power
[14:31] according to the Word of God I can have
[14:34] power to shut down the devil's voice in
[14:38] my own head and his temptation you know
[14:42] he can glamorize dirt he can take the
[14:46] most common thing and make it so
[14:48] glamorous and desirable and and boy you
[14:51] bite the Apple you you fall for the
[14:54] enemy slick trick and the next thing you
[14:57] know you you recognize I am so far away
[15:00] from who I really am I have fallen so
[15:04] far away from who God created me to be
[15:06] but in that moment we must we must
[15:11] recognize that there's a friend that
[15:14] sticketh closer than a brother in that
[15:16] moment we must recognize that God is for
[15:20] you not against you and that he desires
[15:24] for you to win for you to make it I
[15:28] recently was looking over some notes
[15:32] that I used of preaching the funeral of
[15:37] a great general of God who passed away
[15:40] just a few years ago now and on my
[15:43] computer I was trying to put things in
[15:46] folders and organize my life a little
[15:48] better and I found those notes and and I
[15:51] clicked on them and I read over them and
[15:53] it just came to my mind in that moment
[15:55] one portion of what I read and and and
[15:58] it was so true about my friend it was so
[16:02] true about this general of God I made
[16:05] this statement he was the kind of man
[16:08] who wanted people to make it he wanted
[16:12] people to make it he was I think that
[16:17] people would have called him a tough
[16:18] sort of man a leader
[16:21] and he had a tendency to see it his way
[16:26] you know many many times and and
[16:30] convinced others you know to see it his
[16:32] way and to move forward and and yet when
[16:36] someone would slip when someone would
[16:39] fall and people would maybe be roasting
[16:42] that person you know maybe in a
[16:44] conversation oh look what he did look
[16:47] what she did
[16:48] this brother this friend of mine would
[16:51] always step in and and and and bring the
[16:54] conversation back to the to the truth to
[16:58] the reality that we all fall we all make
[17:01] big mistakes and sometimes wrong choices
[17:05] and yet the Lord is gracious
[17:08] he has such tender mercies toward us and
[17:12] he wants us to make it in other words
[17:15] he's not trying to get you to miss
[17:18] heaven he he wants you to cooperate with
[17:22] him and if you will cooperate with him
[17:24] his desire is to give you what you need
[17:27] to overcome what more can he do he shed
[17:32] his precious blood to set us free from
[17:35] the power of sin and from the power of
[17:38] death he prepared a place for us that
[17:42] that one of these days when this life is
[17:45] over real life begins this is it's a
[17:51] good life but it's not the real life
[17:53] there is a real life and that is with
[17:57] him in eternity and he wants us to be
[18:00] successful and so he provides everything
[18:04] that we need just like my my precious
[18:06] brother my precious friend and you know
[18:09] he was the sort of guy who would call
[18:11] and and reach out to people who
[18:13] everybody else was beaten down and and
[18:16] he'd say just to remember you know that
[18:18] you can make it by the grace of God you
[18:21] call on the Lord you get up and you keep
[18:24] going on and he would try to find a way
[18:27] to to bring that person back in to the
[18:31] fellowship draw them back in instead of
[18:35] seeing them out and this is the Ministry
[18:38] of Jesus Christ this is what he desires
[18:41] for you and I so I don't know who I'm
[18:43] talking to right now but maybe you're
[18:46] sort of in a disfellowshipped place
[18:49] right now you you have maybe failed you
[18:53] have somehow lost your way and you're
[18:57] paying the price for it and you may be
[19:00] hard on yourself and and listen you need
[19:03] to make it right if you have sinned
[19:06] against God you need to make that right
[19:08] I'm not here to to give you an excuse
[19:12] but what I am here to tell you once
[19:15] again and I'm gonna tell it every chance
[19:17] I can failure isn't final with Jesus
[19:21] Christ all praise the Lord he allows you
[19:25] turns and he gives us opportunities to
[19:28] get out from under the hold of sin of
[19:33] transgression and of iniquity psalm 32
[19:36] and 5 is through the scripture we were
[19:38] reading the last time we were together
[19:40] and it mentions all three seeing
[19:44] transgression and iniquity in the same
[19:46] verse and this is the psalmist we assume
[19:50] it was David and he says I acknowledged
[19:54] my sin to you and I did not cover my
[19:59] iniquity I said I will confess my
[20:03] transgressions to the Lord and you
[20:06] forgave the iniquity of my sin I just
[20:11] love this transparent moment in the
[20:14] psalmist's life he said Lord I just want
[20:17] to remind you that I didn't dig a hole
[20:20] and try to bury my shortcoming my sin my
[20:24] transgression my iniquity I came before
[20:26] you and laid it open I laid it bare
[20:30] before you because I knew you were the
[20:33] only answer you were the only solution
[20:36] and you heard me and you forgave the
[20:39] iniquity of my sin and I want you to
[20:42] know if you cry out to the Lord even in
[20:45] this moment he will hear you and if you
[20:49] come through the blood of Jesus your sin
[20:52] your transgression your iniquity will be
[20:55] forgiven I'm absolutely confident in
[20:58] that we talked about the fact that sin
[21:02] that that even the Greek concept from
[21:06] the New Testament of the word sin is
[21:08] from archery to miss the mark to draw
[21:11] back the bow to release the arrow with
[21:14] aim you know trying to reach the target
[21:17] but somehow the arrow veers and it
[21:21] doesn't make the bullseye and God says
[21:23] this is sin this is unbelief and and and
[21:27] there's a remedy for that you can do
[21:29] something about it and then we looked at
[21:32] the word iniquity and in the Hebrew the
[21:34] word
[21:34] iniquity is a bending or a twisting or a
[21:38] distortion or perversion of what God has
[21:42] asked of us and so this is why when we
[21:46] were talking about the fact that the
[21:48] iniquity of the father's is visited on
[21:51] the sons it was because iniquity is a
[21:55] choice and so what happens is if the
[21:58] generation before us continues to make
[22:02] that choice right in the face of God to
[22:05] do what is ungodly and what is what is
[22:07] unrighteous and against the instruction
[22:10] of the Lord then then the influence of
[22:13] that sin and the demons even that were
[22:17] assigned to help keep that as a
[22:20] stronghold in our fathers lives for
[22:24] fathers lives they may come after the
[22:27] next generation the influence is already
[22:30] there the predisposition is already
[22:33] there the bending is already there and
[22:36] then I believe that those demonic
[22:38] spirits will do everything they can to
[22:40] try to make the reality of the past
[22:44] generation our present reality and
[22:47] that's where we have to understand
[22:49] there's deliverance for that you just
[22:52] have to continue to say no because when
[22:56] we know what to do when we know what is
[22:59] right we shoot the arrow and it doesn't
[23:03] quite make the target and and we say
[23:06] lord have mercy
[23:07] help me forgive me that's one thing but
[23:10] when we recognize if I keep doing it
[23:12] this way I'm gonna miss the target every
[23:14] time but I like it and so I'm gonna keep
[23:17] doing it well that's what the Bible
[23:19] calls transgression it's a willful act
[23:23] of disobedience against the Lord and
[23:25] then the next thing you know as you
[23:28] continue to make that wrong choice
[23:31] disregarding not even caring that you're
[23:34] sinning against God's Word then it
[23:36] becomes iniquity then it gets deeper
[23:39] than the surface of the skin it gets
[23:41] down in us and it begins to make us to
[23:45] remake us to remote us into something
[23:48] that God has not intended for us to be
[23:52] and those are the kinds of things that
[23:54] we need to understand just because our
[23:57] our forefathers had a problem does it
[24:00] mean that we necessarily have to have
[24:02] that problem but so often we have even
[24:06] mentioned in the last time we were
[24:08] together that science is now confirming
[24:11] that that these tendencies become a part
[24:14] of the DNA and that DNA is passed down
[24:17] to the next generation and so that's
[24:20] when we have to race up and say wait a
[24:21] minute I know God didn't intend for that
[24:24] thing to continue even though the
[24:26] scripture said it can visit the 3rd and
[24:28] the 4th generation
[24:29] we read in the Book of Ezekiel this
[24:31] thing needs to come to an end we need to
[24:33] bring this thing to an end these
[24:35] generational cycles etc so to understand
[24:40] the difference between just sin missing
[24:43] the mark and an iniquity now remember
[24:46] transgression is in between
[24:48] transgression is when we choose to miss
[24:52] the mark to go against what God's Word
[24:56] has said we choose it even though we
[24:58] know that we're going to displease the
[25:02] Lord and we've all we've all done that
[25:04] we've all committed willful sin willful
[25:08] acts of unbelief by the decisions and
[25:12] choices and
[25:13] behaviors of our life when we look at
[25:16] the the full expression of what the word
[25:19] iniquity means in the Bible it's big
[25:22] because it it talks about not only what
[25:27] is carried out but it also talks about
[25:29] what what is lingering beneath the
[25:32] surface what is the motivation what is
[25:35] the driving force what is the
[25:38] inspiration for you to continue to make
[25:41] those choices of transgression and what
[25:44] is the attitude behind it and and what
[25:47] we often find the scripture was clear
[25:49] when one generation makes a decision we
[25:52] will not serve the Lord the next
[25:55] generation is going to be affected by
[25:57] that decision and we have to recognize
[26:00] it that's what we're doing together here
[26:02] and we have to draw the bloodline and we
[26:05] have to say as we have been teaching for
[26:08] three weeks three different lessons
[26:10] already we have to say enough is enough
[26:14] I have been bought with a price thanks
[26:19] be to God
[26:20] because iniquity works like an attitude
[26:24] that comes down for instance the strong
[26:27] opinions of one generation the racism of
[26:31] one generation the political influence
[26:35] of one generation so often comes down
[26:37] and visits the next generation and
[26:40] because of that it's something that kind
[26:43] of lingers beneath the surface and we
[26:45] don't always realize that instead of
[26:48] choosing God's Word we're choosing
[26:50] something that has come down that has
[26:53] passed on to us from the influence from
[26:56] the attitude of another generation and
[26:58] unrighteousness can work that way in
[27:00] racism and and lawlessness all of these
[27:04] things that word iniquity can also mean
[27:08] an injustice which means by making
[27:12] choices to yield to that influence that
[27:16] takes us totally out of the path that
[27:19] God has chosen for you and I to walk I
[27:22] believe many of you believe as I do God
[27:25] has a path for us
[27:26] and we've got to stay in that path no
[27:29] matter what happens because it's only on
[27:32] that path where we're going to
[27:33] experience the blessing and the favour
[27:36] of the Lord and I want you to know you
[27:38] don't want to live without the favor of
[27:40] the Lord you don't want to live without
[27:42] the blessing of the Lord on your life
[27:44] I can almost guarantee that you're not
[27:48] going to want to experience what life is
[27:50] like when we choose to disregard and say
[27:53] hey doesn't matter whether I get the
[27:55] favor of God or the blessing of God on
[27:57] my life I tell you if you've got a
[27:59] business if you're in a career if you've
[28:02] got a family you need the blessing of
[28:04] the Lord and the favor of the Lord in
[28:06] your life so because iniquity can
[28:09] operate like an attitude in our life
[28:11] it's not just covered over by the blood
[28:14] we know we just cover that over and we
[28:16] never have to deal with that again
[28:18] sometimes that thing is so deep beneath
[28:21] the surface that it has to be dealt with
[28:24] not only by pleading the blood of Jesus
[28:28] Christ and applying the blood of Jesus
[28:31] Christ but so recognizing where that
[28:34] route came from that we replace that
[28:38] wrong attitude we replace that that
[28:41] tendency to continue to make the wrong
[28:44] choice and we do that by consciously
[28:47] choosing the way of the Lord by
[28:49] consciously choosing over and over again
[28:52] I'm going to obey God here was David
[28:56] praying he had a heavy heart but he had
[28:58] the right spirit he said Lord I'm just
[29:00] laying it all out there for you and you
[29:03] know in case you we mentioned last time
[29:06] we were together it can get a little
[29:07] technical when you're trying to talk
[29:09] about the different definitions of sin
[29:12] and iniquity and transgression but what
[29:14] if I just summarized it one more time
[29:16] I've said this several times what if we
[29:19] just summarize it by saying it doesn't
[29:21] matter there is a remedy there is a
[29:25] deliverance and I want to share that
[29:28] with you for just a moment here it's
[29:31] such a powerful of powerful truth I say
[29:35] a fifty three verse one who hath
[29:38] believed our report
[29:40] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[29:42] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[29:46] as a tender plant and as a root out of a
[29:49] dry ground
[29:50] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[29:52] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[29:56] we should desire him
[29:57] this is Isaiah's prophecy concerning the
[30:02] suffering son the suffering Savior it's
[30:06] so very very powerful he is despised and
[30:10] rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[30:14] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[30:17] were our faces from him he was despised
[30:20] and we esteemed him not and this was
[30:24] certainly the life and ministry of the
[30:27] Lord Jesus Christ
[30:28] surely he had borne our griefs verse 4
[30:32] and carried our sorrows now listen any
[30:36] grief that you have in your life maybe
[30:41] some of you are still dealing with the
[30:43] loss of a loved one the loss of a family
[30:47] member the loss of a marriage maybe the
[30:52] loss of a job or the home the flat where
[30:55] you lived that you enjoyed so much I
[30:58] don't know what your losses and your
[31:01] griefs have been but I say a prophesied
[31:04] that there was coming a savior there was
[31:08] coming a son who would bear our griefs
[31:11] and carried our sorrows and I want you
[31:15] to know I've met him I've met this
[31:17] suffering son I've met this one who was
[31:21] to come who came and who lives in my
[31:24] heart he has borne our griefs and
[31:27] carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him
[31:30] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[31:33] really Isaiah is saying it will be so
[31:37] easy to disregard him it will be so easy
[31:40] to ignore him you're going to have to
[31:43] make a choice to acknowledge him in your
[31:46] life because even though he has done so
[31:49] very much for all of us we have to
[31:51] believe that
[31:52] we have to receive it and we have to
[31:56] obey what the Scriptures have asked of
[31:59] us here's verse five one of my favorite
[32:02] verses in the entire Old Testament but
[32:04] he was wounded for our transgressions
[32:09] these transgressions this is our willful
[32:14] choices to sin to disregard the truth of
[32:20] God's instruction and all of us have
[32:24] made those transgressions we have made
[32:27] those choices we have lived in that
[32:30] place of just not caring whether it is
[32:34] right or wrong just doing whatever feels
[32:37] good to our flesh but he was wounded for
[32:42] our transgressions which ones can you
[32:47] tell me which ones of our transgressions
[32:50] he was wounded for I'll tell you every
[32:54] one of them every one of them the lie to
[32:59] the murder you hear me I believe that's
[33:03] what the word says every one of our
[33:07] transgressions he was wounded for them
[33:11] and he was bruised for our iniquities
[33:18] those things that lie beneath the
[33:21] surface you know a bruise in the natural
[33:26] is when an injury has taken place
[33:30] sometimes you don't even know what you
[33:33] did
[33:33] but you just look the next day I mean it
[33:36] really happens and you don't have to be
[33:38] old for it to happen either you you bump
[33:41] yourself you're working in the yard or
[33:43] working on the car or whatever you're
[33:45] doing and you don't even recognize that
[33:48] you've done it at the moment and the
[33:50] next day you look and there is a bruise
[33:53] sometimes it can be so angry it's
[33:57] indicating that there has been an injury
[33:59] and and it was it was it was superficial
[34:03] in the sense that that it wasn't a
[34:06] it wasn't a cut but tissue has been
[34:10] damaged beneath the surface and the
[34:13] blood has rushed to that part of the
[34:15] body in that area I love the fact that
[34:18] here the words are broken down for us
[34:21] the different meanings of the words come
[34:24] out when we look at the Hebrew and Jesus
[34:27] took care of all of it
[34:29] our willful sin our transgressions he
[34:32] was wounded for them our iniquities
[34:35] those things that have this have been
[34:38] visited upon us in generational cycles
[34:41] they've laid deep beneath the surface we
[34:45] may have either chosen to agree with
[34:47] them or not agree with them if we agree
[34:50] with them they become our transgressions
[34:53] and if we continue in transgression it
[34:57] becomes iniquity and that is even more
[35:00] deeply rooted in our lives it's harder
[35:03] to get out of that but listen at what it
[35:06] says he was wounded for our
[35:08] transgressions he was bruised for our
[35:11] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[35:14] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[35:20] healed
[35:22] he was wounded he was bruised he was
[35:26] striped everything that we need all of
[35:30] our sin all of our transgression all of
[35:33] our iniquity every bit of it he paid a
[35:36] price and it would do us very very well
[35:40] to accept that beautiful price that he
[35:44] paid at Calvary's cross on our behalf
[35:48] can you say Amen it's so true it's so
[35:52] true we we find out these let me just
[35:56] give you another verse of scripture here
[35:58] in Ezekiel and this is talking a little
[36:02] bit about that old enemy of our soul the
[36:05] one who really is fighting against God
[36:08] and he hates everything that God loves
[36:11] and so guess what that's you that's me
[36:15] the enemy is not against you because of
[36:18] you he's a
[36:19] you because of who loves you the God of
[36:22] all eternity loves you and the Bible
[36:25] describes Lucifer the created being
[36:29] cherub of the Lord in ezekiel 28:14 you
[36:34] were perfect in all your ways from the
[36:37] day you were created till iniquity was
[36:40] found in you by the abundance of your
[36:44] trading I think the King James says
[36:46] traffics you became filled with violence
[36:50] within and you sin see that underlyings
[36:53] something underneath the surface your
[36:56] heart was lifted up because of your
[36:58] beauty you corrupted your wisdom for the
[37:01] sake of your splendor you defiled your
[37:04] sanctuaries by the multitude of your
[37:06] iniquities by the iniquity of your
[37:09] trading see Satan this created being of
[37:13] God was perfect until iniquity was found
[37:16] in him and this is one of the ways why I
[37:20] tell you he wants to to trap every one
[37:24] of us in that cycle of sin transgression
[37:27] and iniquity you know I found this verse
[37:31] of scripture to be helpful through the
[37:33] years in Hebrew Hebrews chapter 12 verse
[37:37] 1 he talks about the sins that so easily
[37:42] beset us and that we should lay them
[37:45] aside and and I have looked at that on
[37:50] the surface you know we do that sometime
[37:53] we just read it and we think we know
[37:56] what it means I want to read it to you
[37:58] and tell you it's a little bit deeper
[37:59] than what I thought it was Hebrews
[38:02] chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore seeing we
[38:05] also are compassed about with so great a
[38:09] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[38:12] every weight and the sin which doth so
[38:18] easily beset us and let us run with
[38:22] patience the race that is set before us
[38:26] I was going to stop there but you better
[38:28] get in that second verse because this is
[38:31] where the power comes from
[38:33] looking unto Jesus the author and
[38:37] finisher of our faith and who for the
[38:43] joy that was set before him endured the
[38:47] cross I don't know about you but when I
[38:52] read about the crucifixion I'm not
[38:55] seeing a lot of joy I'm not seeing a lot
[38:57] of reason to be joyful but if I would
[39:01] have continued to read and I say a53 a
[39:04] few verses down there's a verse that
[39:07] talks about him seeing his seed he saw
[39:13] those who would follow him even while he
[39:17] was on the cross he had that group of
[39:19] people on his mind those who would serve
[39:23] Him and love him and dedicate their
[39:26] hearts and lives to him that was the joy
[39:29] that was the joy there was no joy in the
[39:33] crown of thorns there was no joy but
[39:36] with the spear and his side or the whip
[39:39] and the stripes on his back there was no
[39:42] joy in the nail prints in his hands and
[39:45] feet there was no joy in the vinegar and
[39:49] in the gall and in the plucking of the
[39:51] beard and the smiting of our Lord with a
[39:54] reed none of these things brought joy
[39:57] then why is it that the Apostle said
[39:59] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[40:02] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[40:04] that was set before him endured the
[40:06] cross the joy was you and I the joy were
[40:13] those who would believe him who would
[40:16] serve Him who would follow him even
[40:19] those same ones that the Lord had on his
[40:23] mind before not just at Calvary but
[40:27] before the foundation of the world I
[40:29] want you to say right now I am the
[40:32] lord's joy I am the one who has brought
[40:36] the Lord joy that's how much he loves me
[40:39] now I have brought him shame and I have
[40:42] brought him disappointment and I have
[40:44] brought him hurt
[40:45] I'm sure of that along the way but he
[40:48] saw not only my beginning but he sees my
[40:51] end and he sees the in-between and he
[40:55] knows about us that we're going to make
[40:58] that final surrender to him I I didn't
[41:02] know that I was going to do this but
[41:03] let's go back to Isaiah 53 where we were
[41:07] reading he was wounded for our
[41:09] transgressions and let's go down to
[41:11] verse 10 it says yet it pleased the Lord
[41:15] to bruise him you know this this was
[41:19] really a great reality when we look at
[41:22] this there is a great reality here we
[41:25] know that the high priest the religious
[41:29] leaders among the Jews of that day
[41:33] played a role in our Lord's crucifixion
[41:36] and death we know that that the Roman
[41:39] leaders of that day played a role but
[41:42] the Bible tells us it was the spirit of
[41:45] the Father
[41:46] it was the Eternal Spirit of God who
[41:49] chose the path of suffering for Jesus
[41:53] Christ the Living Word of God made flesh
[41:56] there was a divine plan bigger than our
[42:01] Messiah I it was in the heart in the
[42:05] very thoughts of the Father that he
[42:09] would be bruised that he would suffer in
[42:12] this manner and when you understand who
[42:14] Jesus is not just who he was but who he
[42:18] is he is the Living Word of God John 1:1
[42:21] in the beginning was the word and the
[42:24] word was with god and the word not was
[42:26] like God was God and the Word was God
[42:31] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[42:34] among us and we beheld his glory so when
[42:38] you understand who Jesus is and who he
[42:41] was in his death then you understand
[42:45] this was a divine plan and Jesus was in
[42:49] on it it didn't make it all easy but it
[42:52] was for you that he went all the way yet
[42:55] it pleased the Lord verse 10
[42:57] to bruise him he had put him in grief or
[43:00] to grief when thou shalt make his soul
[43:04] an offering for sin he shall see his
[43:09] seed there it is
[43:14] looking unto Jesus the author and
[43:17] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[43:19] that was set before him endured the
[43:22] cross it goes on to saying in hebrews
[43:27] 12:2
[43:28] i got two places going at one time he
[43:31] endured the cross despising the shame
[43:33] and is set down at the right hand of the
[43:37] throne of god and when we go back over
[43:40] to the finish verse 10 he shall see his
[43:43] seed he shall prolong his days and the
[43:46] pleasure of the lord shall prosper in
[43:50] his hand
[43:51] oh my can't you want me to read the rest
[43:55] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[43:57] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[44:01] shall my righteous servant justify many
[44:04] for he shall bear their iniquities all
[44:09] of them all of them all of them
[44:12] generational iniquities and cycles all
[44:16] of them the iniquity in my own life that
[44:20] has been produced by my decisions to
[44:24] yield to the bending the bending
[44:28] remember we talked about the bending and
[44:30] the twisting that general that
[44:32] generational iniquity can bring into our
[44:35] life the times that I chose to yield and
[44:39] to transgress the law of God every bit
[44:41] of it to justify many for he shall bear
[44:46] their iniquities he did for the joy that
[44:50] was set before him he endured the cross
[44:52] what was he doing he was bearing our
[44:56] iniquities therefore while I divide him
[44:59] a portion with the great and he shall
[45:00] divide the spoil with the strong because
[45:03] he has poured out his soul unto death
[45:06] and he was numbered with the
[45:08] transgressors
[45:10] think about it he who knew no sin he who
[45:14] was altogether lovely the Word made
[45:18] flesh the Eternal Spirit of God now
[45:21] living inside of an earthly body yet he
[45:25] became sin yet he bore our iniquity and
[45:28] our transgression and he bare the sin of
[45:31] many and made intercession for the
[45:35] transgressors my we got it all he took
[45:40] it all all of ours missing the mark all
[45:44] of our transgressions when we choose
[45:49] even knowing that we're going to to do
[45:52] what is not pleasing to him and all of
[45:55] our iniquities he bore them all he took
[45:58] it all and he did it for the joy that
[46:02] was set before him and that joy was
[46:05] having a people in the end time that
[46:09] would come into union come into
[46:12] relationship with him and be completely
[46:15] yielded that he might occupy our lives
[46:18] that we might live the Christ
[46:21] life the god-given life that we might be
[46:25] the reflectors I want to be a reflector
[46:29] I fall short many times but I want to be
[46:33] a reflector of the organic life of Jesus
[46:36] Christ I'm telling you every one of our
[46:39] lives
[46:40] when we look at the joys and the highs
[46:42] and the lows there's no life possible on
[46:46] planet earth that can compare with
[46:49] living the god life the life that we
[46:53] have he has chosen for us to live our
[46:57] life becomes hid in Christ and his life
[47:02] steps forward to take the forefront and
[47:06] therefore no matter what purse no matter
[47:10] what kind of cycle no matter what kind
[47:13] of addiction tries to take a hold of
[47:16] your life you must continue to call upon
[47:20] the name of the Lord for there is the
[47:22] promise of Sal
[47:23] vation just by calling on his name now
[47:26] this hebrews 12:1 i talked about
[47:29] understanding that by setting sin and
[47:32] sometimes through the years i would just
[47:35] sort of liken that to the little foxes
[47:38] that spoiled the vine you know he said
[47:41] let us therefore lay aside every weight
[47:42] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[47:46] us and i'm just thinking that it's like
[47:49] you know taking up extra weight in your
[47:51] life little little things that you need
[47:53] to get straightened out
[47:55] i remember one time i was standing in
[47:58] the valley of elah in Giroux in israel
[48:01] with my family and we were going to go
[48:04] up and climb climb a little hill there
[48:06] and look out over the valley of elah and
[48:08] we were going to rehearse the story of
[48:11] how god moved so mightily in the life of
[48:14] little david standing against this
[48:17] Philistine giant this old goliath and
[48:21] who was boasting himself against the
[48:24] armies of the Lord and mocking God and
[48:27] and while we were on our way up we
[48:30] paused at the dried brook of Elon we
[48:34] started picking up little smooth stones
[48:36] and and I had on cargo pants and I put
[48:39] them all in my pockets just ever every
[48:41] kid had a stone four or five five stones
[48:44] most of them I my wife had five and I
[48:47] had and I'm just filling up my and then
[48:49] we walk we walk up the hill I get to the
[48:51] top and I'm thinking why in the world
[48:53] did I not empty my pockets to climb the
[48:56] hill here I have climbed the hill and it
[48:59] was you know a little bit more than a
[49:01] molehill and I've done it with all this
[49:05] extra weight I could have lightened my
[49:07] load a little bit and so when I think of
[49:09] that scripture I think of picking up
[49:11] some extra cargo that you didn't have to
[49:13] carry but when I look at that word in
[49:15] the Greek it really sort of shook me
[49:19] because that word beset the the sin that
[49:23] does so easily beset us it comes from a
[49:27] Greek word that means ensnaring
[49:30] obstructing constricting now we think
[49:35] about the bowl
[49:37] that which ambushes or in circles and I
[49:43] I when I really saw that by setting
[49:47] means more than just a little what some
[49:49] people have called the no harm sin or
[49:51] the little foxes that spoil the vine and
[49:55] yet the word doesn't mean that at all
[49:58] it means the very thing that takes you
[50:00] by ambush the thing that wants to
[50:03] encircle you and constrict you and
[50:06] obstruct you and ensnare you and boy
[50:10] when I saw that I said lord I want to
[50:12] search my life not only for the weight
[50:15] that I'm carrying up the hill that I
[50:17] don't have to carry I might as well lay
[50:20] aside the weight so that I can run but I
[50:24] also want you to show me those sins
[50:28] those attitudes those places of doubt
[50:31] that lie in wait that lie in wait to
[50:36] ambush me when you start examining that
[50:40] you can usually put your finger on some
[50:44] things that the enemy has used against
[50:46] you in the past and when I begin to
[50:49] recognize those things I called out to
[50:51] the Lord and I will again I'll call out
[50:54] to him again because I want to have all
[50:57] my pockets emptied so I can run to the
[51:00] top of the hill in the name of the Lord
[51:01] Jesus Christ and I don't want to to step
[51:05] into the trap I don't want to be
[51:07] constricted I don't want to be ensnared
[51:10] or ambushed and one that when it says in
[51:14] circles you know that reminds me of the
[51:16] of the movies I saw us a little boy
[51:18] where they tie up tie up the guy wrap
[51:21] him around in the rope from his head to
[51:23] his toes and you know the enemy will
[51:26] operate like that in our lives he will
[51:29] wrap us and wrap us and wrap us until he
[51:32] controls us but I'm so thankful to God
[51:36] he bore it he paid the price you go tell
[51:40] somebody before the day is over tell
[51:43] somebody Jesus bore it all all to him
[51:49] Oh sin had left a crimson stain he
[51:52] washed it why there's snow you know that
[51:56] may sound like to maybe a modern
[51:59] generation that may sound like some old
[52:03] dusty you know relic of the church let
[52:08] me tell you something it's older than
[52:10] the church it's the truth that was in
[52:12] God's mind before the foundation of the
[52:15] world there is freedom for you and I
[52:19] thanks be to God
[52:21] sin this kind of this kind of a setting
[52:26] sin or the iniquity that we were talking
[52:29] about it's like having a chain around
[52:31] your ankle which which constantly
[52:33] hinders you it trips you up and causes
[52:37] you to slip to air to keep missing the
[52:39] mark but it doesn't stop there iniquity
[52:43] will continue to defile your character
[52:45] and it'll give you a crooked arrow to
[52:47] start with so here you are trying to
[52:50] shoot the arrow and you realize I'm
[52:53] missing the mark and missing the mark
[52:55] and missing the mark and I don't even
[52:56] know why it's because these iniquities
[52:59] if they're not dealt with and we don't
[53:01] come before the Lord in in repentance
[53:04] and put the blood on them and then
[53:05] replace them with truth you know it's
[53:08] not just rubbing the blood over them and
[53:10] continuing in them we've got to replace
[53:12] them with the victory of the
[53:15] resurrection he didn't just die for our
[53:17] sins but Christ was risen he overcame
[53:22] death hell and the grave I'm gonna
[53:25] fellowship with that I'm not just gonna
[53:28] fellowship with the blood that he that
[53:31] he was wounded for my transgression
[53:33] Bruce from our iniquities but I'm also
[53:35] gonna fellowship with the fact that he
[53:37] overcame death itself
[53:41] and he came forth with the keys of death
[53:44] hell and the grave and because he
[53:47] overcame I can overcome also blessed be
[53:52] the name of the Lord we've got the
[53:54] victory that we need and I want to
[53:57] remind you of that again and again and
[53:59] again because that's the truth that
[54:02] and storms that's the truth that gives
[54:05] us the strength we need to get through
[54:07] the daily battle of life once again I
