[53:52] you're listening to a tape and you're
[53:55] hearing the word from for our day sir
[53:58] it's not just for you to hear it it's
[54:01] for you to fellowship with it somebody
[54:03] said what do you mean well you've got to
[54:05] pay attention to it I don't care who's
[54:08] there if it's a truth say Amen you're
[54:11] riding down the road you hearing brother
[54:13] brandom he said something you believe it
[54:15] to be the truth or whoever but you need
[54:18] to hear that you say Amen well somebody
[54:22] will think I'm crazy no crazier than the
[54:24] one riding down the road texting or
[54:29] FaceTiming you you're the right kind of
[54:32] crazy and worship
[54:36] is
[54:38] essential to praise him and to worship
[54:41] Him is essential it's not
[54:44] optional somebody said well we don't all
[54:46] have to praise the Lord the same way we
[54:48] do have to praise him the Bible
[54:54] way it's the only of
[54:57] Praise that he will receive sir I want
[55:00] to apologize to the visitors for having
[55:02] this loeng in my in my mouth it's
[55:06] because of a dry mouth condition but I'm
[55:09] Healed uh by the stripes that he bore at
[55:12] calary you don't have to wait till you
[55:14] get here to
[55:16] praise you can praise him every single
[55:19] day of your life the Bible tells us
[55:22] raise your hands clap your hands you use
[55:26] your hands to play instruments the Bible
[55:29] tells us stand in praise it even talks
[55:32] about sitting and pray kneeling in
[55:35] Praise even laying
[55:38] prostate prostrate before the Lord in
[55:43] praise and he tells us to use our voice
[55:46] and he even tells us what kind of a
[55:49] voice to
[55:50] use there is a time that we should use a
[55:54] loud voice
[55:56] yes yes sir I know the worship here is
[56:00] Rowdy for a lot of people but we didn't
[56:02] tailor it for
[56:04] you we tailored it after the book of
[56:07] Psalms somebody say well I don't know
[56:09] what they're doing waving that piece of
[56:11] cloth around the Bible tells us to lift
[56:14] up a
[56:15] standard that word is a flag so if
[56:19] somebody wants to wave a I don't care if
[56:21] that's what they want to do they've got
[56:23] Bible for it and if the critics have a
[56:27] problem with it that is just fine with
[56:29] me we didn't come here to please one
[56:33] another or to or to be a part of any
[56:36] other church or
[56:38] organization we've come to worship him
[56:42] and I want you to know I'm proud of you
[56:44] I know pride is not the right word to
[56:47] use but I'm proud of you this morning
[56:50] for for worshiping him for for not
[56:54] letting anything change the way you you
[56:57] come to give him praise he's
[57:00] worthy I want to tell you something he's
[57:05] worthy and he deserves the highest
[57:08] praise the highest

[1:04:03] years ago and we had so many older men
[1:04:07] with us then brother hey brother

[1:04:49] faithful you say what you want to about
[1:04:52] brother Shaw we kid him awful hard about
[1:04:56] being the oldest dad because it doesn't
[1:04:58] seem right for the oldest dad to be that
[1:05:00] young really but he's a faithful
[1:05:03] man he goes to the street festivals
[1:05:08] and maybe they play all kind of music
[1:05:10] but he doesn't go for the music he give
[1:05:12] that up long time ago but he walks
[1:05:15] around looking for somebody to tell the
[1:05:17] Lord about he he's even a YouTube
[1:05:20] sensation Cu uh he he he found some
[1:05:22] hardheads down there one day and

[1:15:52] we're glad you Among Us you probably the
[1:15:55] most normal people
[1:15:57] here no no no I'm I I'm kind of
[1:16:01] beginning to think that yes God is so
[1:16:05] good he's so good what else was I
[1:16:07] supposed to do anything else before we
[1:16:09] leave today we'll have the fathers come
[1:16:11] up we'll pray over them and and they
[1:16:13] each get one of these gifts here every
[1:16:15] father we want to bless them we are
[1:16:17] blessed we're so
[1:16:19] blessed uh I didn't have a father in my
[1:16:22] life he he was alive but he wasn't n in
[1:16:25] my life except the first five years of
[1:16:28] my life and uh we hoped and prayed for
[1:16:32] so many years that there would be a
[1:16:34] reunion but it just wasn't possible and
[1:16:37] then uh uh couple three years ago he he
[1:16:40] went uh went home I pray I pray that we
[1:16:44] will have Fellowship together through
[1:16:45] the endless ages uh I was told by a very
[1:16:49] good friend of his that he had had
[1:16:52] seriously called on the Lord and if
[1:16:54] that's the case
[1:16:55] there'll be no memory there'll be no
[1:16:58] memory of the past and we'll be brothers
[1:17:01] forever you know that's the way it works
[1:17:04] I was terrified to become a dad but God
[1:17:07] has been gracious and I made a lot of
[1:17:10] mistakes and so if Benjamin will just
[1:17:13] learn from my mistakes and not make them
[1:17:15] then he will be an amazing father to
[1:17:17] Elana Elana Jane he absolutely will
[1:17:20] would you stand we could sing brother
[1:17:23] Kate it don't seem right you're not

[1:18:21] fun I I was Pro I probably missed my
[1:18:23] calling maybe I should been a game show
[1:18:25] host or something I don't know but
[1:18:28] anyway all of you who are streaming this
[1:18:32] service some of you think I've just lost
[1:18:34] it but God bless every one of you you're
[1:18:36] so many I can't even call your names
[1:18:39] I've had so many Happy Father's Day
[1:18:41] greetings from from all over the world
[1:18:44] so many texts and and uh thank you thank
[1:18:46] you I'm thankful for my four children
[1:18:49] Stacy and I were blessed with but I have
[1:18:53] so many more than that that God has
[1:18:55] blessed us with so many more spiritual
[1:18:58] children than that we're very rich
[1:19:00] because of that and adopted
[1:19:03] sons and I appreciate them and love them
[1:19:06] and their families and anyway I could
[1:19:09] get real wax real sentimental but I want
[1:19:13] to give you some of the word today I
[1:19:15] want to speak about the measure of a
[1:19:17] Godly Man and uh I I feel we're blessed
[1:19:22] because we have Godly men Among Us
[1:19:25] and we have great
[1:19:26] examples and I don't know how we're
[1:19:29] going to do it but and I haven't
[1:19:31] discussed it with brother gy but somehow
[1:19:34] maybe just a picture maybe a little sign
[1:19:37] or something but I would like to put a a
[1:19:40] little uh commemoration in the
[1:19:43] fellowship hall when it's finished to
[1:19:46] brother West brother Arthur West who's
[1:19:48] going to be with the Lord he was a real
[1:19:51] dad to
[1:19:52] me and I appreciate it with the absence
[1:19:55] of a natural dad brother West sacrifice
[1:19:59] driving nearly 4 hours one way to be in
[1:20:02] this church for so many years and we
[1:20:06] shared more meals together than anybody
[1:20:09] outside of my blood family we had took
[1:20:12] more vacations together and I can't
[1:20:14] hardly wait I hope he's the first
[1:20:19] one I really do I love my mom I know
[1:20:22] she's with the Lord but I hope brother
[1:20:25] West is the first one I see because he
[1:20:28] certainly meant so much to me to my
[1:20:30] family to this church would he ever be
[1:20:33] thrilled to know that all 60 Acres and
[1:20:36] this building and all paid for wouldn't
[1:20:38] he be thrilled wouldn't he be thrilled
[1:20:40] to know we're using the building down
[1:20:42] there it's going to be used it's going
[1:20:44] to be so nice anyway 1 Corinthians
[1:20:46] chapter 16 I'd like to read two verses
[1:20:51] I'm going to read some of my notes today
[1:20:54] uh because it's a different sort of
[1:20:56] service when I was a boy one more thing
[1:21:00] when I was a boy it was a tradition in
[1:21:03] the Pentecostal churches maybe other
[1:21:05] denominational churches too for men to
[1:21:09] wear a rose on Father's Day to to give
[1:21:13] honor to their dad like like you would
[1:21:17] your mom in fact a lot of men wore
[1:21:20] flowers on Mother's Day now I know that
[1:21:22] is so sissify now and so out of our
[1:21:26] culture and so forth but by the world
[1:21:29] standard but my wife has uh she has
[1:21:32] revived the tradition she asked me she
[1:21:36] told me she was going to do it I
[1:21:38] cried uh Kendra made him and we're so
[1:21:41] thankful appreciate her so much she's
[1:21:44] talented um I cried about it but she
[1:21:47] asked you do you want a white rose
[1:21:50] thinking of your dad or or a pink for
[1:21:52] Elana well we you can't live in the
[1:21:56] past and uh I don't want to have to slug
[1:22:00] you so don't say anything about it being
[1:22:02] being pink this is to commemorate
[1:22:06] Eliana Jane and her dad has one today
[1:22:09] too so that's why we're doing it and and
[1:22:13] anyway my mom would like it she would
[1:22:16] she would like the idea of Reviving The
[1:22:19] Old tradition but anyway 1 Corinthians
[1:22:22] 16 verse 13 and 14 I I better hurry
[1:22:26] watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit
[1:22:32] you like men be strong I'm going to read
[1:22:36] it again Watch ye Stand Fast in the
[1:22:40] faith quit you like men be
[1:22:44] strong let all your
[1:22:48] things be
[1:22:50] done with
[1:22:52] Charity so whoever ever has the idea
[1:22:57] that a godly man can't be a loving man
[1:23:01] missed what the Apostle Paul wrote to
[1:23:04] the church at Corinth nobody should love
[1:23:07] their
[1:23:08] families more than a godly man no one
[1:23:12] should show them his love more than a
[1:23:16] godly man so if you've got an idea that
[1:23:20] Godly men don't cry and real men don't
[1:23:23] cry and Real Men Don't Hug their
[1:23:26] children and real men don't kiss their
[1:23:29] wives and uh I don't know where you got
[1:23:33] your idea of a real man maybe
[1:23:36] Hollywood maybe in some old movie but
[1:23:40] the Bible tells us that real men Godly
[1:23:45] men Stand Fast in the faith they're
[1:23:48] watchful because the enemy is
[1:23:51] Raging and quit you like men he said be
[1:23:55] strong and let all your things
[1:23:56] everything you do be done with Charity
[1:24:00] which is the demonstration of love may
[1:24:02] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:24:04] his word you may be seated and if I
[1:24:07] haven't already offended or thrown you
[1:24:09] off uh I will read this in the Amplified
[1:24:13] Bible so that I can finish the rest of
[1:24:15] you but I think it's important for us to
[1:24:18] hear this Amplified just a little bit
[1:24:22] that's like turning up the volume
[1:24:24] not so that we can take away from uh
[1:24:28] good old 1611 King James but sometimes
[1:24:33] you know in English quit you like men
[1:24:36] huh what does that mean stop being
[1:24:40] men it's what it says quit you like men
[1:24:44] so if you're if you're not speaking the
[1:24:47] king's language and we do not do that
[1:24:49] here in Alabama they may do that up
[1:24:51] there in Minnesota but we don't speak
[1:24:54] speak the king's language here we're
[1:24:56] just
[1:24:57] hillbillies with a little polish and
[1:25:00] sometimes we need it to be turned up a
[1:25:02] little louder so I'm going to do that
[1:25:04] for you this morning by reading this in
[1:25:07] the
[1:25:08] Amplified be alert and on your
[1:25:12] guard stand firm in your faith your
[1:25:17] conviction
[1:25:18] respecting man's relationship to God and
[1:25:23] divine
[1:25:24] things are you with
[1:25:33] me I'll be right back with you there it
[1:25:37] is keeping the trust and holy fervor
[1:25:42] born of faith and a part of it it's not
[1:25:45] a passion that you're born with we're
[1:25:48] talking about a passion for Faith for
[1:25:50] the things of God this is something
[1:25:52] nurtured in you
[1:25:54] and and and in fact quit you like men
[1:25:57] doesn't mean quit being men at all it
[1:26:00] means act like
[1:26:03] men behave like
[1:26:05] men and um this young man what is your
[1:26:09] name the the the student the one who's
[1:26:11] just
[1:26:12] graduated
[1:26:14] Elisha Elisha has no choice now he has
[1:26:18] come to a part of his life where he is
[1:26:22] going to be a man
[1:26:25] now he he had to he had to get there
[1:26:27] before he
[1:26:28] graduated because a boy can't go through
[1:26:31] some of those things and and survive and
[1:26:35] graduate like he
[1:26:37] has but I want you to know that
[1:26:40] sometimes it's not about your age or
[1:26:42] what you go through because I know some
[1:26:44] old people who are really not acting
[1:26:48] like men of God it's not enough to be a
[1:26:52] man it's to be a man of God a father
[1:26:55] eventually a father a man of God
[1:26:58] eventually a father what a
[1:27:00] responsibility that is and in the
[1:27:03] Amplified this says act like men be like
[1:27:06] men and in the denominational churches
[1:27:09] today they're going to preach that that
[1:27:11] means playing ball and starting a fire
[1:27:14] without matches and uh coaching the
[1:27:17] Little League team and that's how
[1:27:20] they're going to Define what a real man
[1:27:23] or a real father is but I want you to
[1:27:25] know that we're going to look at another
[1:27:28] way of measuring what a real man of God
[1:27:31] a man a Godly Man is H he may not know
[1:27:35] anything about Star
[1:27:37] Wars he may not be much for camping he
[1:27:41] may be more of a glamping sort of guy
[1:27:45] but if he will measure himself by the
[1:27:48] word of God which is our absolute and
[1:27:51] will surrender everything that that
[1:27:55] that's unlike that word to the word to
[1:27:58] God he will be a man he'll be a man and
[1:28:04] he will act like a man and he he may not
[1:28:06] be
[1:28:08] bowlegged and and he may not walk like
[1:28:11] John Wayne but if he will measure
[1:28:14] himself by the word of God he can be a
[1:28:17] godly man and he can act like a man the
[1:28:21] the the Amplified said act like men and
[1:28:25] be
[1:28:27] courageous we're waiting to see it again
[1:28:30] act like men and be courageous
[1:28:34] grow help me
[1:28:37] grow in
[1:28:39] strength and I just happen to grab it I
[1:28:41] don't even know if I passed it on or not
[1:28:43] but the 14th verse said everything let
[1:28:45] everything you do be done in
[1:28:48] love true love to God and man as
[1:28:53] inspired
[1:28:54] by God's love for us are you following
[1:28:57] me what wonderful instructions the
[1:29:01] Apostle Paul gave to the early church
[1:29:04] the the baby Church in Corinth you need
[1:29:07] to act like men now remember in this
[1:29:10] time the Greek culture had
[1:29:13] invaded uh the Hebrew people the Jewish
[1:29:16] people the Israeli Israelite people a
[1:29:20] second temple period when Jesus lived
[1:29:23] and died and rose again remember that
[1:29:26] the Greek mentality had taken over that
[1:29:31] part of the world and men were shaving
[1:29:34] for the first
[1:29:36] time Jewish men who had been instructed
[1:29:40] from old not to do that but the Greek
[1:29:44] mentality said we want to we want to
[1:29:47] strip that away we want to change your
[1:29:51] name you know most of the Apostles we
[1:29:54] call them by their Greek
[1:29:56] transliteration instead of their Hebrew
[1:29:58] name because people were beginning to
[1:30:01] speak Greek Jews were speaking
[1:30:05] Aramaic and uh this Greek influence this
[1:30:08] idea of bathing
[1:30:12] together that kind of watered things
[1:30:14] down a little bit the gymnasium you know
[1:30:17] that was a Greek thing and uh wearing
[1:30:21] wearing wreaths on your head and go
[1:30:23] going around in a in a bed sheet the
[1:30:27] Jews didn't know what to think about
[1:30:28] These Guys these Greeks that were
[1:30:31] invading the land of the
[1:30:33] Bible and I want to just tell you that
[1:30:36] that Greek culture like the Roman
[1:30:39] culture was a sissified culture it was a
[1:30:42] culture that really wanted to take any
[1:30:45] form of masculinity away from a man and
[1:30:48] that's why homosexuality was so
[1:30:51] prevalent in both cultures
[1:30:54] because they really wanted to blend the
[1:30:57] genders together can you imagine all
[1:31:00] those many years ago that there was
[1:31:02] already an
[1:31:04] attack against gender uh separation and
[1:31:08] distinction it it it was a it was an
[1:31:11] affront it was an assault to the people
[1:31:15] who were trying to live their lives by
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] Bible and you know they outlawed
[1:31:22] circumcision and uh they they started
[1:31:25] taking away the faith of the Hebrew
[1:31:29] people and trying to make them more
[1:31:33] acceptable on a world
[1:31:35] standard and so uh I want you to know
[1:31:38] Paul wouldn't going to have
[1:31:41] it he wasn't going to have it he he
[1:31:43] might have occasionally been called by a
[1:31:46] Greek name but his name was sha
[1:31:49] originally and uh he wasn't going to
[1:31:51] have this Greek influence taking over
[1:31:54] the church in Corinth I don't even want
[1:31:56] to tell you some of the things they were
[1:31:57] doing they they were wearing wigs and
[1:32:00] doing all kinds of things it's one of
[1:32:03] the reasons why First Corinthians chap
[1:32:05] 11 became necessary to tell the men
[1:32:08] nature itself teaches you that it's a
[1:32:10] shame for a man to have long
[1:32:13] hair Elisha believes that scripture this
[1:32:16] morning he's he doesn't have much hair
[1:32:18] at all and uh the same scripture that
[1:32:21] tells a woman that that long hair on
[1:32:24] your head is a sign of submission to
[1:32:26] your husband it is given to you for a
[1:32:28] covering it is a representation of the
[1:32:31] authority in the ranks of
[1:32:34] angels and Paul had to you know he had
[1:32:37] to talk to them about uh eating things
[1:32:40] sacrifice to idols and Oh my he was
[1:32:43] constantly having to come against that
[1:32:45] culture and he was tired of men kind of
[1:32:48] footing around and calling
[1:32:51] themselves Christians
[1:32:54] so this is what he wrote he said take
[1:32:56] this letter to them to to stand fast in
[1:33:00] the faith and to act like
[1:33:02] men don't let the culture dictate to you
[1:33:06] what a man is or is not you find a Godly
[1:33:11] standard in the Torah you find a Godly
[1:33:14] standard in the letters of the Apostles
[1:33:17] that we call the Epistles and live by
[1:33:19] that and if he would have been alive
[1:33:21] today he would have written a letter and
[1:33:23] he would have told people don't let your
[1:33:25] Heroes be sports stars and movie stars
[1:33:30] and losers like that you can have a big
[1:33:33] paycheck and be a loser when it comes to
[1:33:36] being a real man all these years later
[1:33:39] this footage a video footage that
[1:33:42] resurfaced a few weeks ago of one of
[1:33:44] these big football players knocking his
[1:33:47] wife for girlfriend down in the in the
[1:33:50] hallway of the hotel and stomping on her
[1:33:53] and there was a time that that all of
[1:33:56] society was uh you know singing his
[1:33:59] praise and calling him a man's man well
[1:34:02] let me tell you something a man's man
[1:34:04] doesn't beat a woman down on the ground
[1:34:06] and then kick her after she's
[1:34:10] down so thank God for Godly men who want
[1:34:15] to measure their lives according to the
[1:34:18] Bible instead of the culture the culture
[1:34:21] listen uh this identification business I
[1:34:24] I don't identify as oh my goodness and
[1:34:28] what are my pronoun I don't care what
[1:34:31] your pronouns
[1:34:33] are this world is in trouble if there's
[1:34:37] ever been a time for Godly men to raise
[1:34:39] up like we have in this house this is
[1:34:42] the hour to do that now the measure of a
[1:34:46] godly man it's big it's one sermon could
[1:34:50] never touch it all we live in a world
[1:34:53] that dep depends on secure and
[1:34:56] unchanging measurements in fact
[1:34:59] governmental agencies are formed to
[1:35:02] conduct tests on various devices to
[1:35:05] ensure that companies are being honest
[1:35:07] with selling Goods when you go to the
[1:35:10] gas pump there's a sticker here anyway
[1:35:13] there is a sticker on the pump that will
[1:35:16] have a seal on it and it will list the
[1:35:19] name of the state agency that has
[1:35:21] determined has checked the calibration
[1:35:24] of that pump stay with me and has
[1:35:27] determined that that pump is calibrated
[1:35:31] to Dill out or dish out a gallon of gas
[1:35:35] when it clicks a gallon on the screen a
[1:35:38] gallon of gas has gone into your tank
[1:35:41] how many of you appreciate the fact that
[1:35:43] somebody checks that every now and again
[1:35:46] cuz I don't want to pay for a gallon and
[1:35:48] get a half a gallon and you don't either
[1:35:51] so there's got to be somewhere a
[1:35:54] standardization uh of keeping those gas
[1:35:58] pumps in line what if a company would
[1:36:00] give three4 of a gallon and say it's a
[1:36:03] gallon it's happened or mixing it down
[1:36:06] with water you know you can be cheated
[1:36:09] the public would be up in arms if they
[1:36:12] found out that they were paying for a
[1:36:14] gallon of gas and getting a quarter of a
[1:36:16] t a quarter of a gallon or half a gallon
[1:36:18] or 3/4 of a gallon the the FDA I don't
[1:36:22] want to get too too started into that
[1:36:24] but the Food and Drug Administration
[1:36:27] there's a division of that uh agency
[1:36:31] that uh regulates pharmaceutical
[1:36:35] companies not nearly intense enough but
[1:36:39] this particular division of the FDA
[1:36:42] measures insist on regulating the
[1:36:46] equipment in the Laboratories to make
[1:36:49] sure that if something is 1,000 mgram
[1:36:54] that it really is 1,000 mgram now my
[1:36:57] idea is they should be checking a little
[1:37:00] closer to see what kind of poison is
[1:37:02] going in the pill but that's not what
[1:37:04] they do are you help me going to help me
[1:37:07] you with me no no they're not checking
[1:37:09] always the the the chemicals and the
[1:37:13] poison of of the additives of the pill
[1:37:15] but they're making sure that if it's
[1:37:18] 1,000 Mig in a pill you're going to get
[1:37:21] 1,000 milligrams of poison
[1:37:24] they don't want to cheat you not one
[1:37:26] little milligram right and so there's a
[1:37:30] there's a a part of the FDA that
[1:37:32] regulates that what if drug companies
[1:37:35] decided that that uh they would instead
[1:37:38] they'd call it a th000 milligrams but
[1:37:40] they would just slip in 1500 milligrams
[1:37:43] well that could make a difference
[1:37:45] according to what the drug is so there's
[1:37:47] got to be a standardization or else it
[1:37:50] would have a huge impact on our health
[1:37:52] and and it would depend on someone's
[1:37:54] weight and so forth the building
[1:37:56] industry is also regulated by inspectors
[1:37:59] who have determined that 12 in are going
[1:38:02] to be in a foot and uh you don't get to
[1:38:06] go and make your own measuring
[1:38:08] stick you you've got to buy one
[1:38:10] standardized or if if you're going to uh
[1:38:14] pass inspection they better not see you
[1:38:16] using a stick that you cut off a tree
[1:38:19] and hope that's 12 in or a measuring
[1:38:22] tape that you you know made a string and
[1:38:24] said well this is you you better you
[1:38:26] better stay with the
[1:38:29] standardization uh of the measurements
[1:38:31] and then there's other measurements like
[1:38:33] a matter of time I'd like to preach all
[1:38:35] day on
[1:38:37] time I'd like to preach on being on
[1:38:43] time wouldn't that be a great sermon but
[1:38:47] you know there are industries that
[1:38:48] depend on time
[1:38:52] Airlines look as long as you're not with
[1:38:54] American Airlines you should be all
[1:38:56] right they don't seem to care much about
[1:38:59] time when they say the flight is at 2 it
[1:39:02] may be 2 maybe 3 maybe the next morning
[1:39:05] at
[1:39:06] 9: it's right you hear it and see it all
[1:39:10] the time but somebody needs to kind of
[1:39:12] standardize this thing we're in a
[1:39:15] confusing situation here because we live
[1:39:18] in the central time zone and we go by
[1:39:22] the Eastern Time
[1:39:24] Zone and uh we've done that I saw
[1:39:26] someone explain that it's because of
[1:39:29] Fort Benning excuse me young man that's
[1:39:31] what we still call it Fort Benning and
[1:39:34] that's what it was my whole life and I
[1:39:36] forget to say it otherwise maybe you'll
[1:39:39] retrain me one day uh it's the same
[1:39:42] location for sure but anyway uh you know
[1:39:46] there there's got to
[1:39:48] be some
[1:39:50] standardization some measurement of time
[1:39:53] you've got to be precise if you're if
[1:39:56] you're going to uh go on a trip or show
[1:40:01] up for roll call in the morning and
[1:40:04] they've got their own military time but
[1:40:07] they tell me that the time difference
[1:40:09] the reason why we go by Central and we
[1:40:11] live and go by Eastern and live in the
[1:40:14] central is because of Fort Benning it's
[1:40:16] because so many soldiers lived on the
[1:40:18] Alabama side and they needed to keep
[1:40:21] them and so many mill workers who worked
[1:40:23] in Columbus Georgia on the other side of
[1:40:26] the river but they lived out in this
[1:40:28] area so we're confusing I saw where one
[1:40:31] woman wrote that if she leaves her phone
[1:40:33] on automatic she and her husband have a
[1:40:36] king-sized bed and she said on one side
[1:40:38] of the kingside bed it shows Central
[1:40:41] Time on the other side of the kingside
[1:40:43] bed it's eastern time that sounds about
[1:40:45] like a marriage don't it running on two
[1:40:48] different
[1:40:49] times wonder which one's always the last
[1:40:52] to get ready
[1:40:53] anyway there's got to be some
[1:40:55] standardization of measurement in the
[1:40:57] natural world well folks God says the
[1:41:00] same thing when it comes to spiritual
[1:41:03] things he wants to Define for us what a
[1:41:07] Godly father is he wants to Define for
[1:41:10] us what a Godly Man is again we're
[1:41:13] blessed to have Godly men here so this
[1:41:16] same kind of idea of measurement can be
[1:41:19] said for the scope of the spiritual
[1:41:21] world where the traffic of men's Souls
[1:41:24] moves not just on a daily docket but on
[1:41:28] an eternal plan something bigger than
[1:41:31] the here and the now thankfully we can
[1:41:33] find measurements in the word of God
[1:41:35] that can help us to see which way to go
[1:41:39] how to live and pattern our lives I'm
[1:41:41] thankful for it some four or five years
[1:41:45] ago I shared with you on Father's Day
[1:41:48] about a book that I have I don't have an
[1:41:51] original copy but I have have a
[1:41:53] reprinted Edition and it has been
[1:41:56] reprinted multiple times since then it
[1:41:59] was originally written in
[1:42:01] 1666 it was written by a A purst or a
[1:42:06] Puritan Theologian his name was Thomas
[1:42:10] Watson it's been reprinted by the banner
[1:42:13] of Truth trust you can look for it it's
[1:42:16] easy to get a hold of the book is called
[1:42:18] The Godly Man's
[1:42:20] portrait The Godly Man's portrait
[1:42:23] portrait written in
[1:42:25] 1666 it's a little over 250 pages long
[1:42:28] 12 chapters that are directly written
[1:42:31] toward what a Godly Man looks like hold
[1:42:34] on it was quite a popular book some 400
[1:42:38] years ago when men were really
[1:42:41] concerned about being a Godly
[1:42:43] example it its popularity has long since
[1:42:47] departed from our society and it isn't
[1:42:49] likely to hit the New York Times
[1:42:51] bestsellers list anytime soon however
[1:42:55] Reverend Watson lists
[1:42:58] 24 different points in showing what a
[1:43:02] Godly Man looks like according to Watson
[1:43:06] he went through the Bible covered to
[1:43:09] cover and he made a list of 24 things
[1:43:14] portraits of a godly man I wished I
[1:43:17] could preach on all of them but I will
[1:43:19] read them all I'd like for you to think
[1:43:21] about it I wish I had had given you the
[1:43:24] a copy of the list we can put it on the
[1:43:26] church app because I think it it is so
[1:43:31] basic in the list that you really have
[1:43:33] to think about some of these but they're
[1:43:36] powerful uh powerful concepts of what a
[1:43:39] Godly Man is number one a man of
[1:43:42] knowledge and we know what kind of
[1:43:44] knowledge that is number two a man moved
[1:43:48] by faith that's what a Godly Man is
[1:43:51] number three a man ired by love four a
[1:43:57] man like God I want you to help me so I
[1:43:59] know you're with me number five a man
[1:44:02] who is careful
[1:44:04] about the worship of
[1:44:07] God that that's not a man that comes to
[1:44:10] the church and sits on his
[1:44:12] hands it's not a man that comes and
[1:44:14] expects his wife to worship and children
[1:44:16] to worship while he watches them but
[1:44:19] it's a man thank God for men like that
[1:44:21] here I don't want to call but I want to
[1:44:23] thank God for men like here who lead
[1:44:26] their
[1:44:28] children they don't send them up front
[1:44:31] they don't tell their wives you go up
[1:44:33] front many time they they come long
[1:44:36] before one of these brothers was a
[1:44:38] father long before one of these brothers
[1:44:40] was a married man he was patterning to
[1:44:43] be a godly man and he was one of the
[1:44:46] first and sometimes the only who put his
[1:44:49] whole heart he didn't play an instrument
[1:44:52] but he came came up here and spread his
[1:44:54] hands before the Lord like an evening
[1:44:56] sacrifice I want you to know that a real
[1:44:58] man of God is one who's careful about
[1:45:02] worshiping God that's why you're here
[1:45:04] today bless you I honor you for for
[1:45:07] choosing this some of you could have
[1:45:09] chose the lake for Father's day but you
[1:45:12] chose the house of God not to not to
[1:45:15] encourage your pastor only but to to
[1:45:18] bless the Lord a man who serves God and
[1:45:21] not men now that doesn't mean he that he
[1:45:24] doesn't have a servant's heart but he
[1:45:27] means that he's not looking to man for
[1:45:29] his Accolade he's not looking to man for
[1:45:32] acceptance or rejection he's holding on
[1:45:35] to God if God said so that that man is
[1:45:38] convinced he doesn't have to have a
[1:45:40] thousand confirmations of what the word
[1:45:43] has already said you with me a man who
[1:45:46] prizes Jesus Christ who values him who
[1:45:50] understands he's more than a than a an
[1:45:52] an equated character in history
[1:45:54] somewhere he's a living
[1:45:57] demonstration of a living God he may not
[1:46:00] be here in his own physical body but
[1:46:02] he's here in his corporate body right
[1:46:04] now living in a godly man living in a
[1:46:08] Godly woman and we value him we're we're
[1:46:12] careful where we take him we don't drag
[1:46:15] him to the pub we don't drag him here
[1:46:18] and there we honor and prize this Jesus
[1:46:21] who lives in us and and listen to what
[1:46:24] listen to what Thomas Watson said oh you
[1:46:26] just put this in here because you're a
[1:46:28] crybaby no I didn't write this he did a
[1:46:31] man who can
[1:46:35] weep I want to tell you something I
[1:46:38] don't think that that is
[1:46:41] optional I believe that as men we need
[1:46:44] to be humble enough before
[1:46:48] God that our heads can
[1:46:51] leak because leaky head will never
[1:46:54] swell you don't have to be a a mush you
[1:46:57] don't have to be a crybaby some of us
[1:46:59] might be that but you you you you need
[1:47:03] to be humble enough and tender enough
[1:47:06] thank God for what example we have here
[1:47:10] that you can shed a tear especially in
[1:47:13] the presence of the Lord this whole idea
[1:47:16] you know that what the world says we
[1:47:18] reject that today we're going to stand
[1:47:20] with with Reverend Watson from
[1:47:24] 1666 cuz he gets these and if you read
[1:47:26] the book he he uh certainly
[1:47:29] substantiates every one of these things
[1:47:31] with scripture a man who loves the
[1:47:35] word that don't mean just twice a week

[1:47:47] see a man a dad a husband open up the
[1:47:51] Bible talk to the children about the
[1:47:54] Bible devotions aren't just for mothers

[1:48:13] is a is a present dad a Hands-On dad my
[1:48:17] that's wonderful brother that's
[1:48:19] wonderful I hope that can be said about
[1:48:21] you you cared enough to be
[1:48:25] present you you didn't read the
[1:48:27] newspaper I'm going to be oldfashioned
[1:48:29] now newspaper what's that do you know
[1:48:32] how our precious Brother David Edwards
[1:48:34] got down here from South Carolina by a
[1:48:38] map I I said what's a map this
[1:48:41] generation doesn't even know what a map
[1:48:42] is he said brother shelle I don't have a
[1:48:44] cell
[1:48:46] phone you know I love him but I almost
[1:48:49] asked him what cave he was living in he
[1:48:51] said I borrowed my wife
[1:48:54] he said I did bring a phone call case I
[1:48:56] needed something but but I borrowed my
[1:48:58] wives for those of you who have asked
[1:49:01] yes he stayed over and uh we had a
[1:49:04] wonderful time of Fellowship together on

[1:49:10] we had but he got down there so I I'm

[1:49:14] little bit easier route to get home nope

[1:49:20] map sometimes you better stay with what
[1:49:22] your you're used to come
[1:49:25] on ain't that
[1:49:27] right a man who loves the word I'll go
[1:49:30] on I was going to say some more a man
[1:49:32] who has the spirit of God no I'm I'm
[1:49:35] coming
[1:49:36] back years ago the dad would you know
[1:49:39] come home and put on his slippers and
[1:49:41] read the newspaper and the kids would
[1:49:43] try to bother him and and he'd send them
[1:49:45] out of the room and so forth folks that
[1:49:47] might have worked in the
[1:49:49] 1950s but I'm going to tell you
[1:49:51] something we need a whole lot more more
[1:49:52] than
[1:49:54] that see that was in the day of
[1:49:56] television shows like Father Knows
[1:50:00] Best I I've seen some of those shows
[1:50:02] when I was younger I'm going to be
[1:50:04] honest with you I've seen some of them
[1:50:06] but you know that's not the example
[1:50:07] that's being held up in our generation
[1:50:10] today of what men are in the home I've
[1:50:13] never seen an episode I don't intend to
[1:50:16] find an episode but they call it an
[1:50:18] adult cartoon and there's a guy I've
[1:50:20] read some of the stupid things he said
[1:50:23] called Bart
[1:50:24] Simpson and and his idea of life is
[1:50:27] pretty trashy and that's who so many uh
[1:50:31] young people around the world that's
[1:50:32] what they think of when they think of a
[1:50:34] dad not Father Knows Best
[1:50:37] hello but dad's just a dumb nobody that
[1:50:40] don't know anything come on now are you
[1:50:43] with me now I'm thankful that we have a
[1:50:48] community full of men who aren't Bart
[1:50:51] Simpsons
[1:50:53] and I'm only basing that on what I've
[1:50:54] already said you we've got some men who
[1:50:57] said I'm going to do it the right way
[1:50:59] the god Godly way if I fall I'm gonna
[1:51:02] get up
[1:51:03] again and do it all over again a man who
[1:51:07] has the spirit of God residing in him
[1:51:10] you can't just have the dead word you
[1:51:13] can't just recite scripture with no
[1:51:14] connection and no passion and no Spirit
[1:51:18] we're reading the list of 24 things that
[1:51:21] that uh Thomas Watson wrote In the book
[1:51:23] 1666 this is the portrait of a godly man
[1:51:27] let's go on a man of
[1:51:30] humility he's not
[1:51:32] arrogant he doesn't think the world
[1:51:34] revolves around him a man of
[1:51:38] prayer now the only way your family is
[1:51:40] going to know you pray is if they hear
[1:51:42] you pray or see you
[1:51:45] pray a man of
[1:51:47] sincerity a Heavenly Man W what does
[1:51:50] that mean from 166 6 to 2024 somebody
[1:51:54] who's got his eyes on a prize and who
[1:51:58] says nothing going to keep me from my
[1:52:00] path and I'm going to set as many people
[1:52:02] as I can on the same path by being an
[1:52:05] example a zealous man hello brother
[1:52:08] sister oh yes this is for you a zealous
[1:52:13] man it's getting kind of quiet stay with
[1:52:16] me a zealous man that's a man with some
[1:52:20] passion about him that's that's a man
[1:52:22] that don't live his whole life on the
[1:52:25] sofa a zealous man he's got a passion
[1:52:28] especially for the things of God oh oh
[1:52:30] oh oh oh oh let's just skip that one and
[1:52:32] go on somebody tell me what the next one
[1:52:35] is oh you didn't lose your place patient
[1:52:39] man help me
[1:52:43] Jesus that'll strain you
[1:52:46] sometime that'll strain you as a Godly
[1:52:49] Man as a Godly father to be patient but
[1:52:52] it's important because somebody took a
[1:52:54] little time for you are you here a
[1:52:57] thankful man that's right a thankful man
[1:53:00] this is the kind of man that's to be
[1:53:01] respected in a home a thankful man one
[1:53:05] who knows where his help comes from it
[1:53:08] doesn't come from the
[1:53:09] government it'll fail you it comes from
[1:53:12] God I'm so thankful for that let's go on
[1:53:15] a man who loves the
[1:53:17] Saints if a man's always tearing down
[1:53:20] the household of faith always
[1:53:22] criticizing those who worship with
[1:53:25] him that's not a very good example a man
[1:53:29] who does not indulge himself in sin
[1:53:31] somebody said that's impossible no it's
[1:53:33] it's it's very likely when someone has
[1:53:36] surrendered to the word if unbelief
[1:53:38] Creeps in we grab a hold of it and
[1:53:40] wrestle It To The Ground a man who is
[1:53:43] good in his relationships now when I
[1:53:45] read that I remembered what the
[1:53:47] scripture said growing in strength so
[1:53:50] you and I have to grow in in being good
[1:53:53] in our relationships because the reality
[1:53:56] is some of us didn't
[1:53:58] come from a home where there was a good
[1:54:01] husband wife
[1:54:04] relationship where Dad didn't have a
[1:54:06] good relationship with his co-workers or
[1:54:08] his
[1:54:10] siblings we come some of us came from
[1:54:12] homes where our dad was just as content
[1:54:15] not to be with any of his family he was
[1:54:17] glad to be rid of all of them come on
[1:54:19] and so it's harder for us to learn what
[1:54:22] it me means to be good in our
[1:54:24] relationships and we have to work on it
[1:54:26] a little bit harder but thank you for
[1:54:28] the grace Lord that you give us to be a
[1:54:32] better husband to be a better
[1:54:35] son to be a better
[1:54:37] dad a man who does spiritual
[1:54:42] things in a spiritual Manner and in a
[1:54:46] spiritual order a man thoroughly trained
[1:54:49] in religion now we wouldn't put it that
[1:54:51] way today that was
[1:54:53] 1666 but we would say a man who knows
[1:54:55] what the Bible says and it's not a shame
[1:54:58] to explain uh the
[1:55:01] godhead well there ought not to be a man
[1:55:03] in this house or a father in this house
[1:55:05] that would be afraid to try to explain
[1:55:08] to somebody the godhead and if you're
[1:55:10] fearful of it it's because you haven't
[1:55:12] yet received the Simplicity of the
[1:55:15] revelation we have a tendency with
[1:55:17] religion to make things so complicated
[1:55:20] nobody can get it that's why we want to
[1:55:22] give it in the spirit that's why we want
[1:55:24] to be anointed to share it amen a man
[1:55:27] thoroughly trained in religion or in in
[1:55:29] the true biblical Doctrine a man who
[1:55:31] walks with God right is number 23 a man
[1:55:36] who walks with God number 24 the last a
[1:55:39] a a man who strives to be an instrument
[1:55:43] I must have not given him the other two
[1:55:45] that's just like me a man who strives to
[1:55:47] be an instrument for making others Godly
[1:55:51] how many of you'd like to know you're
[1:55:52] you are uh you know forging a path of
[1:55:57] what godliness looks like instead of men
[1:55:59] pursuing the American dream are chasing
[1:56:02] after pots of gold are giving themselves
[1:56:05] a pass that leans toward laziness and
[1:56:09] checking out from
[1:56:10] responsibility there are some
[1:56:12] measurements that we're going to require
[1:56:14] work these measurements will require
[1:56:17] work to obtain do does anybody believe
[1:56:20] it's worth it yes
[1:56:22] to grow in grace to grow in strength
[1:56:25] toward being a Godly Man what if there
[1:56:28] were just a handful of men in a city
[1:56:31] that said I want to be a godly man and a
[1:56:34] Godly father thankfully there are a
[1:56:37] handful or more of men in this church
[1:56:40] most of the brothers here have committed
[1:56:44] themselves if not all have committed
[1:56:46] themselves to being Godly examples and
[1:56:50] they should be I want you to know the
[1:56:51] script scripture talks about the woman
[1:56:53] of virtue being praised I want you to
[1:56:56] know that men of God Godly examples in
[1:56:58] our homes should also be praised their
[1:57:01] role should not be dumbed down they
[1:57:04] should be
[1:57:05] honored you know I could get real
[1:57:08] technical here they shouldn't be called
[1:57:10] Old
[1:57:11] Man hello they shouldn't be called old
[1:57:15] man if that's something you and your dad
[1:57:17] have agreed on you know your strangeness
[1:57:20] is welcome at your house if that's
[1:57:22] something's okay with you all but how
[1:57:24] many of you know that's not really
[1:57:26] honoring that's not really
[1:57:29] honoring my prayer for Father's Day 2024
[1:57:32] is that we pursue the things by which
[1:57:35] God measures men in 1 Timothy chapter
[1:57:42] 6 verse 11 and 12 he said but thou oh
[1:57:45] man of God flee these things and follow
[1:57:48] after righteousness let's say it
[1:57:51] together righteous
[1:57:53] godliness Faith love patience meekness
[1:57:58] fight the good fight of Faith lay hold
[1:58:03] on eternal life that's being Heavenly
[1:58:06] isn't it where unto Thou Art also called
[1:58:09] and has professed a good profession
[1:58:11] before many
[1:58:13] witnesses the verses that I just read
[1:58:17] come uh theologically I could say Bible
[1:58:21] students like to call these the Pastoral
[1:58:24] Epistles because they were written from
[1:58:27] Paul to Timothy as a leader was passing
[1:58:30] down some information some instruction
[1:58:33] some Godly wisdom about being a leader
[1:58:37] but I want you to know it's important to
[1:58:39] understand that every man who comes into
[1:58:42] the kingdom of God whether he's a a a a
[1:58:45] father or not every man who comes in to
[1:58:49] the kingdom of God is a leader
[1:58:52] he might be a single man in the church
[1:58:55] but I want you to know he's a leader
[1:58:57] Austin is a
[1:58:59] leader he's right now still a single man
[1:59:03] in our church but he's worthy to be
[1:59:05] looked at as someone who's trying to set
[1:59:08] a good example for somebody else and you
[1:59:11] may come along and say well he hasn't
[1:59:12] always neither of
[1:59:14] you neither of I let's give a man his
[1:59:18] due and be thankful we we would all be
[1:59:21] more thankful if Austin had a wife and a
[1:59:23] dozen
[1:59:27] children and he's single and I ought to
[1:59:30] take a picture of him and show it
[1:59:34] around but I want you to know he's yet
[1:59:37] to be he can still be a leader Among Us
[1:59:40] right and I'll tell you one of the
[1:59:42] things that he does set an example in
[1:59:44] and and that is showing
[1:59:46] honor and showing respect and and if if
[1:59:49] we're going to call people out and I
[1:59:51] will for being slack then I need to take
[1:59:54] a moment and give somebody a
[1:59:57] crown amen so so it doesn't matter
[2:00:00] whether you're you know married and got
[2:00:01] a dozen children if you come into the
[2:00:03] kingdom of God you're chosen to be a
[2:00:05] leader right because somebody's watching
[2:00:08] you if you're a husband your wife is
[2:00:10] watching you if you're a father you're
[2:00:12] leading your children but if you're just
[2:00:14] a brother in the church folks are
[2:00:15] watching you on your job you tell people
[2:00:18] you're a Christian you tell people you
[2:00:20] go to church how many of you know expect
[2:00:22] something higher out of us I want you to
[2:00:25] know I'm grateful they're not going to
[2:00:28] be disappointed when they work with some
[2:00:29] of
[2:00:30] you I'm grateful for that I don't take
[2:00:33] that I don't take that lightly I'm
[2:00:36] thankful for it so even though these
[2:00:38] instructions were written to to
[2:00:40] leadership it doesn't just mean
[2:00:43] pastors it doesn't just mean Apostles
[2:00:45] prophets pastors teachers and evangelist
[2:00:47] it means those leading their home those
[2:00:49] leading on their job those leading in
[2:00:52] Society sir every father preaching with
[2:00:55] his life as much as he is with his words
[2:00:58] I want to tell you something that part's
[2:01:00] essential
[2:01:01] Dad you can say the right thing and then
[2:01:04] do the wrong thing and negate what
[2:01:07] you've just said let all the saints say
[2:01:09] Amen there's an old Parable I don't know
[2:01:13] if it ever happened or not but it's it's
[2:01:15] recorded as a parable of a of a Haitian
[2:01:19] man a Haitian pastor told told this
[2:01:22] story and it made its way into several
[2:01:25] different
[2:01:26] books he told that in his country there
[2:01:29] was a man who wanted to sell his house
[2:01:32] for
[2:01:33] $2,000 and another man in the area
[2:01:36] desperately wanted to buy the
[2:01:39] house but remember it was
[2:01:41] $2,000 and this man didn't have the
[2:01:44] means he wanted the house but he didn't
[2:01:47] have the means to buy the house and so
[2:01:50] after a lot of bargaining
[2:01:52] the owner of the house agreed to sell
[2:01:54] the house for $1,000 that's half price
[2:01:58] how many of you know that's a good deal
[2:02:00] half price I should have expected that
[2:02:03] every sister in this room would have
[2:02:05] said amen I know it's not your day but
[2:02:08] how many of you
[2:02:10] will push somebody out of the way to get
[2:02:13] a half price
[2:02:16] deal you'll go to the dollar store
[2:02:19] knowing that there's nothing in there
[2:02:20] hardly any more a dollar you go anyway
[2:02:22] hoping that it's on
[2:02:24] clearance my wife recently bought some
[2:02:26] flowers on clearance this morning she
[2:02:30] she recently bought them as recently as
[2:02:33] yesterday she bought them on sale this
[2:02:35] morning they needed to go in the
[2:02:38] garbage they were on sale I said well
[2:02:41] she that's what I said I said well she
[2:02:43] got to enjoy them yesterday but she
[2:02:45] didn't get to enjoy them today so
[2:02:47] sometimes half price is not not a deal
[2:02:50] or are you with me
[2:02:52] so this man was convinced to to to uh to
[2:02:56] let him buy the house he he was slick he
[2:02:58] had a he had a plan he said yes you can
[2:03:01] buy the house glad for you to have it
[2:03:04] for
[2:03:05] $11,000 however the reduced price came
[2:03:08] with a stipulation a rather odd one the
[2:03:12] owner the one who is selling this great
[2:03:14] deal of a house would be able to retain
[2:03:18] ownership of a large nail
[2:03:22] just above the front door so I'm going
[2:03:25] to sell you the rest of the house for
[2:03:28] $1,000 but I'm going to own the large
[2:03:32] nail that's over the front door of the
[2:03:36] house seems so innocent doesn't it this
[2:03:39] is this is another culture another
[2:03:41] country come
[2:03:42] on I don't know why that's doing that
[2:03:44] I'm not even moving yet here I am
[2:03:47] moving uh I can't imagine anybody doing
[2:03:51] that
[2:03:53] maybe a sister being you know talked
[2:03:56] into something but I I think any brother
[2:03:59] here would be asking most most sisters
[2:04:02] too would be asking why do you want that
[2:04:04] nail over my front door but he knew what
[2:04:07] he was doing when this Haitian pastor
[2:04:09] concluded the story uh it went something
[2:04:12] like this some years passed and the
[2:04:16] original owner decided he wanted to buy
[2:04:18] the house back oh okay here comes the
[2:04:21] stipulation
[2:04:22] understandably the new owner was
[2:04:23] unwilling to sell it back to him and he
[2:04:25] wanted to buy it for
[2:04:27] $1,000 nope the new owner is not willing
[2:04:31] to sell it back to him so the original
[2:04:33] owner went out and found the carcass of
[2:04:36] an old dead dog hung it on the
[2:04:40] nail right in the front
[2:04:43] door the nail that he still
[2:04:46] owned he didn't own anything else but
[2:04:48] the nail he hung an old dead dog on the
[2:04:53] it wasn't long before the house became
[2:04:56] unlivable and the family was forced to
[2:04:58] sell the home to the owner of the nail
[2:05:03] the Haitian pastor went on to say if we
[2:05:05] leave the
[2:05:07] devil with even one small
[2:05:11] peg in our life he'll return every time
[2:05:14] to hang his rotten garbage on
[2:05:17] it so that's why we've got to make sure
[2:05:20] that when we sell out to we own
[2:05:22] everything we own it all we take
[2:05:25] authority and courage and boldness over
[2:05:28] everything that we are because if you
[2:05:31] give the devil an
[2:05:34] inch I remember the old preacher saying
[2:05:37] you know I read in the Bible if you give
[2:05:39] the devil an inch he'll take a mile and
[2:05:40] I thought I've never read that in the
[2:05:42] Bible but the Bible does say give not
[2:05:46] space to the devil if you're going to
[2:05:49] sell it you better you you you better
[2:05:52] make sure that that you walk away that
[2:05:56] old Devil's not he's going to make sure
[2:05:58] to come back if you leave him a nail I
[2:06:01] like that story I thought it was good if
[2:06:03] the enemy has one access to just a
[2:06:05] single nail in your life he'll take
[2:06:07] advantage of you he'll exploit it and
[2:06:10] it's a good question are there any nails
[2:06:12] hanging over our door that the enemy
[2:06:15] could come back and hang something on us
[2:06:18] are we One Look Away from pornography
[2:06:22] or are we completely delivered hello
[2:06:24] come
[2:06:25] on it's it it's it's something to think
[2:06:28] about don't give the devil or the world
[2:06:30] any room to take advantage of you and
[2:06:32] and listen to the instructions of the
[2:06:35] Bible I want to give you three ways and
[2:06:37] I got to hurry that man is measured we
[2:06:41] know the ultimate measuring stick is
[2:06:43] God's word but number one a man is
[2:06:45] measured by what he flees
[2:06:47] from it is 102 for you clock Watchers
[2:06:51] when Paul was writing these things to
[2:06:53] Timothy he used a Greek
[2:06:55] word and it it almost looks like it
[2:06:58] would be Fuego which you know is a word
[2:07:00] for for fire in another language but
[2:07:02] it's actually pronounced fug p h u go in
[2:07:07] Greek and it's pronounced fug we get an
[2:07:10] English word from that
[2:07:13] fugitive and that's the root word and it
[2:07:15] literally means to seek safety by
[2:07:19] flight it means you you don't inch away
[2:07:23] you don't crawl
[2:07:26] away you run away are you with me you're
[2:07:30] to flee from something because it's
[2:07:32] abhorent or distracting to your soul
[2:07:36] extra biblical literature in the Greek
[2:07:38] used to use this word when someone was
[2:07:40] running from a dragon or fleeing from a
[2:07:42] snake this is the same word that was
[2:07:45] chosen here to cover what happens when a
[2:07:48] Godly Man is running away from something
[2:07:51] that is in the world a man of God is
[2:07:54] measured by what he flees from in some
[2:07:57] other places Paul told us that we're to
[2:07:59] flee from some things let's see if we
[2:08:01] have a list there I won't read these
[2:08:03] scriptures for the sake of time Paul
[2:08:05] tells us flee from
[2:08:07] fornication flee from idolatry flee from
[2:08:11] covetousness and the love of money it's
[2:08:16] not wrong to have money you've got to
[2:08:17] have money to pay your bills but if
[2:08:19] making money becomes your goal in
[2:08:21] instead of setting you're in trouble and
[2:08:24] and 2 Timothy 2:22 flee from youthful
[2:08:26] lusts now there seems to be this
[2:08:29] prevailing idea these days around the
[2:08:31] message of the hour when we travel
[2:08:33] around and see what goes on in some of
[2:08:35] these youth Affairs that uh it's a
[2:08:38] current common and uh accepted practice
[2:08:42] that young people are all going to go
[2:08:44] away from the word of God we're not
[2:08:46] Amish
[2:08:47] folks they they're going to go away from
[2:08:50] the church and they're going to go after
[2:08:51] out and it's necessary for them to
[2:08:53] experience the depths of sin and and the
[2:08:56] depravity of that kind of a life so that
[2:08:59] when they come back to God they'll have
[2:09:00] a stronger
[2:09:04] testimony I I'd like to go around with
[2:09:06] the man who preaches that kind of a
[2:09:08] Doctrine it's not
[2:09:10] necessary the Bible does tell us and
[2:09:12] explain to us that who who him who is
[2:09:15] forgiven much loves much that's right
[2:09:19] that's true but how many of you believe
[2:09:22] it's very possible for a young man to
[2:09:24] grow up in faith to have a real genuine
[2:09:27] experience with God to be born again as
[2:09:30] a child filled with the Holy Ghost and
[2:09:34] stay in the word now I'm not an example
[2:09:37] for all things but that's my that's what
[2:09:40] my life was he filled me with the Holy
[2:09:43] Ghost when I was seven years old I want
[2:09:46] you to know it made a difference in my
[2:09:48] life it didn't always make me right it
[2:09:51] didn't mean I always did the right thing
[2:09:53] but it meant I always knew where to come
[2:09:55] back to I always knew where to look to
[2:09:58] and so to me my testimony is not like
[2:10:01] yours but I'm going to hold it up
[2:10:04] because I want some young brother here
[2:10:06] some young sister here I want Michaela
[2:10:09] to
[2:10:10] know sitting right here on the front row
[2:10:13] I want her to know I want you young
[2:10:14] Brothers to know that you don't have to
[2:10:17] go out there and experience the things
[2:10:19] of the world to appreciate serving God
[2:10:22] God to appreciate God's benefits and
[2:10:24] blessings in your life we're all Sinners
[2:10:28] I hate to tell you folks you were born
[2:10:29] in that shape we were shapen in iniquity
[2:10:32] we needed God when we breathed our first
[2:10:35] breath but there's no reason for us to
[2:10:38] think that a young man can't flee
[2:10:41] youthful lust he can when he's full of
[2:10:44] the Holy Ghost and he must Paul was sure
[2:10:48] about it this is still good advice in
[2:10:50] our gener ation we live in a sensual
[2:10:53] idolatrous money loving lustful Society
[2:10:56] every device the devil can use he'll do
[2:10:58] to subvert a soul we have to flee and
[2:11:02] that doesn't mean crawl
[2:11:04] away it means run away like you're
[2:11:07] fleeing a bear like you're fleeing a
[2:11:09] serpent like you're fleeing a hungry
[2:11:12] lion run remember we're not just fleeing
[2:11:16] from something but we're fleeing to
[2:11:19] something we're run into the Rock of
[2:11:22] Ages the men in this church and fathers
[2:11:25] in this church and husbands in this
[2:11:28] church who are successful in their life
[2:11:30] they're not just running from the devil
[2:11:32] they're running to the Rock of Ages
[2:11:35] they're running to the rock that will
[2:11:37] never fail them you believe that they're
[2:11:41] running to the rock that was split on
[2:11:43] their behalf Rock of Ages cleft for me
[2:11:49] in 1 Timothy 6 six and 10 but godliness
[2:11:53] with contentment is great gain for we
[2:11:56] brought nothing into this world and it's
[2:11:58] certain we can carry nothing
[2:12:01] out and having food and rment let us be
[2:12:06] therewith content but they that will be
[2:12:09] rich fall into temptation and a snare
[2:12:11] and into many foolish and lustful
[2:12:13] hurtful lusts which drown men in
[2:12:15] destruction and predition For the Love
[2:12:17] of Money not money the Love of Money
[2:12:20] loving money and of loving God is the
[2:12:22] root of all evil which while some
[2:12:24] coveted after they have AED from the
[2:12:26] faith listen this this man's talking
[2:12:29] about folks he knows who once walked in
[2:12:32] the faith till they had a little success
[2:12:34] in business till somebody started
[2:12:37] calling a mister I'm gonna preach
[2:12:41] now somebody started calling a mister
[2:12:45] somebody began to know their name some
[2:12:47] other business owner began to know who
[2:12:49] they were and the next thing you know
[2:12:51] they're leaving the faith leaving the
[2:12:54] morality of righteousness leaving the
[2:12:56] word because now they're Mis somebody
[2:12:59] Hello he said he said for the love of
[2:13:02] money is the root of all evil which
[2:13:04] which while some coveted after they have
[2:13:06] aired from the faith and Pierce
[2:13:09] themselves through oh
[2:13:11] yes with many Sorrows so all of these
[2:13:15] things fornication idolatry Covetous the
[2:13:17] love of money and the youthful lust get
[2:13:19] away from it run from it encourage your
[2:13:26] sons if you're teaching your sons to
[2:13:29] handle things with their
[2:13:31] fist I'm missing that in the
[2:13:34] scripture you're not teaching them to be
[2:13:36] Lily lied or limp wristed or sissies but
[2:13:41] if you're teaching them that's the way
[2:13:43] to handle a
[2:13:44] problem what's going to happen on their
[2:13:48] job what's going to happen when their
[2:13:50] wife won't do what they tell them to do
[2:13:53] I'm going to get some help
[2:13:54] today you better teach a little bit
[2:13:57] better than that that's right you better
[2:14:00] make them understand there are some
[2:14:01] disputes that cannot be settled with
[2:14:04] fist they can only be settled by going
[2:14:07] to him it's hard enough for Godly men to
[2:14:10] get along the enemy wants to come
[2:14:12] between them and drive wedges between
[2:14:14] them isn't that right you'll discover
[2:14:17] that in fleeing from fornication
[2:14:18] idolatry greed and Youthful lust there
[2:14:20] are some virtues that start pouring into
[2:14:22] your life the men of God in this house
[2:14:24] the fathers Godly fathers in this house
[2:14:27] that have spent their life running from
[2:14:30] those things like brother gy running
[2:14:33] from those things they have found that
[2:14:35] in running from those things the things
[2:14:38] we need the things that are valuable the
[2:14:40] things that are most important start
[2:14:41] dropping down on you see that little
[2:14:44] song are you hear me that little song We
[2:14:47] sung this morning the Lord bless you and
[2:14:49] keep you I don't think ever everybody
[2:14:51] understands the great value of that
[2:14:54] that's the ironic priesthood blessing
[2:14:56] that's the blessing that the priest
[2:14:58] pronounced over the house of Israel yes
[2:15:00] sir it's an important blessing because
[2:15:03] it says to us that The God Who has
[2:15:05] sustained us is able to sustain our
[2:15:09] children and our
[2:15:11] grandchildren there's not a day goes by
[2:15:13] that I don't thank God for four children
[2:15:16] serving the lord one daughter-in-law
[2:15:18] serving the lord and a little grandbaby
[2:15:20] that's going to serve the Lord because
[2:15:22] her family is going to pour that into
[2:15:24] her and I want you to know I tell her
[2:15:26] every single day so far every single day
[2:15:30] P loves you but I want you to know Jesus
[2:15:34] loves you much more than p pap could
[2:15:37] ever love you come on I want you to know
[2:15:40] we've got we can claim this Heritage we
[2:15:43] can claim it we can't help where we come
[2:15:45] from but we can help What We Leave
[2:15:47] Behind I didn't have a Godly dad an
[2:15:50] example Le before me but I tell you I
[2:15:52] can do better for mine they can do
[2:15:55] better for theirs and I want you to know
[2:15:58] I see you
[2:16:00] brother I see you doing
[2:16:03] that I see you doing that maybe we don't
[2:16:07] stop enough to tell you but we see you
[2:16:11] doing that perfect I don't think you are
[2:16:14] because I know I'm not but I appreciate
[2:16:17] what you're running after I appreciate
[2:16:20] what you're growing in Paul uses the
[2:16:23] indication that it is to be a lifelong
[2:16:25] Pursuit we should never stop pursuing
[2:16:29] six things
[2:16:31] righteousness godliness Faith love
[2:16:34] patience and meekness which is
[2:16:37] gentleness a man of true faith will find
[2:16:39] himself Desiring and pursuing these
[2:16:41] Everlasting possessions of the Soul if
[2:16:44] you want to know what a man of God looks
[2:16:46] like sometimes it helps to know what he
[2:16:48] does not look like a man of God and you
[2:16:51] look around and think about this this
[2:16:52] represented in our body a man of God
[2:16:54] should not have the immature
[2:16:56] characteristics of a
[2:16:59] child I'm going to drink a little water
[2:17:01] on that I know you're in a
[2:17:04] hurry
[2:17:06] on I know you're in a
[2:17:08] hurry I know some of you wish I'd have
[2:17:10] just got back up here and preached on
[2:17:13] something
[2:17:13] else God wants us to hear this for
[2:17:16] now a man of God should not have the
[2:17:19] immature characteristics of a child 1
[2:17:21] Corinthians 13:11 can I just read it in
[2:17:24] the Amplified I have it in both plan to
[2:17:26] read it in both but I'm taken too much
[2:17:28] time when I was a child I talked like a
[2:17:31] child I thought like a child I reason
[2:17:33] like a
[2:17:36] child now that I become a man I'm done
[2:17:39] with childish
[2:17:40] ways and have put them
[2:17:44] aside brethren in in 1 Corinthians 14:20
[2:17:47] Amplified Brethren do not be children
[2:17:49] immature in your thinking continue to be
[2:17:51] babes in matters of evil but in your
[2:17:55] minds be mature
[2:17:57] men now do you know what the Apostle is
[2:17:59] telling them there know as little as you
[2:18:01] can about evil and as much as you
[2:18:04] possibly can about that which is
[2:18:07] Godly many many people have have have
[2:18:10] used
[2:18:13] research as an
[2:18:15] idea and then they become overwhelmed
[2:18:18] and overcome by Darkness
[2:18:21] that's right don't let that be what
[2:18:23] you're running after one characteristic
[2:18:25] of a true man of God one who can truly
[2:18:28] say is being measured by the word is
[2:18:31] maturity perhaps the best piece of
[2:18:33] advice if you want to know what a man of
[2:18:35] God really looks like is this you'll
[2:18:37] know it when you see
[2:18:40] it this is not fake it till you make it
[2:18:44] somebody's going to know wife's going to
[2:18:47] know children are going to know it can
[2:18:50] sometimes be hard to describe what a
[2:18:51] mature man looks like it is not however
[2:18:54] a hard task to know what an immature man
[2:18:56] looks
[2:18:57] like when a man's growth has been
[2:18:59] stunned as he is a boy in a grown man's
[2:19:02] body it's very obvious one sign a man
[2:19:05] needs to be mature is if he's more
[2:19:07] interested in playing than
[2:19:11] working yes I think I will obsessed with
[2:19:15] games and fun like a boy there's
[2:19:18] absolutely nothing wrong with having fun
[2:19:20] playing a game are doing all things in
[2:19:23] moderation but a godly man is not called
[2:19:25] to live for entertainment or games A Man
[2:19:28] was created to have a meaningful work
[2:19:31] Genesis 2:15 and the Lord go the Lord
[2:19:33] God took the man and put him in the
[2:19:35] Garden of Eden to tend and guard and
[2:19:37] keep to be a Watchman Over the Garden
[2:19:40] these Godly men sitting in this house
[2:19:43] these Godly fathers sitting in this
[2:19:44] house they have to take their
[2:19:46] responsibility as a Watchman serious
[2:19:50] right
[2:19:51] yes if there are mothers in this house
[2:19:53] that tell your children don't tell
[2:19:57] Dad it's going to get quiet
[2:20:00] now the dad will get mad don't tell Dad
[2:20:04] you better keep it from Dad something's
[2:20:07] wrong something's wrong in a home like
[2:20:10] that if that's your home something is
[2:20:12] out of
[2:20:13] order now maybe sometime that's because
[2:20:16] Dad has a rotten temper then he needs
[2:20:19] prayer but it's never an idea it's never
[2:20:22] a good idea to expect a man to be a
[2:20:24] Watchman and to be responsible for the
[2:20:27] souls of his family while they're in his
[2:20:31] care and then Short change him or
[2:20:34] sabotage his responsibility by keeping
[2:20:40] secrets mama mama knows sometime when
[2:20:43] they put on little
[2:20:45] Rouge don't tell
[2:20:48] Dad Mama walks in on them sometime when
[2:20:51] they're putting on things they ought not
[2:20:53] to put
[2:20:54] on doing things they ought not to do
[2:20:56] don't tell that I'm telling you folks
[2:20:57] that's not the way to build a
[2:21:00] home because Mom is going to have a
[2:21:03] measure of responsibility a Godly dad a
[2:21:06] Godly husband a Godly father that
[2:21:08] responsibility is going to rest more on
[2:21:10] his shoulders before God than mom don't
[2:21:16] keep him in the dark games can be good
[2:21:19] for boys if it helps to prepare them
[2:21:20] from work when playing games distracts a
[2:21:22] man from his work or takes him away from
[2:21:24] his wife and children he's acting like a
[2:21:27] boy he's not manifesting that he's a man
[2:21:31] another sign of maturity in a man is
[2:21:33] respect respect has more to do with you
[2:21:36] than it does with the people you are
[2:21:37] respecting respect is not flattering
[2:21:40] words or stroking someone's ego like
[2:21:43] telling someone you're the goat you're
[2:21:45] the greatest of all time you're the best
[2:21:47] there is you're the only one you're the
[2:21:48] best one there's nobody like you
[2:21:51] that's stroking ego that's not what I'm
[2:21:54] talking about I'm talking about not
[2:21:56] flattering words or massaging someone's
[2:22:00] ego I mean respecting an office or
[2:22:03] position of authority even when we
[2:22:06] cannot respect the
[2:22:09] character of the man it's very very hard
[2:22:13] for me to respect the character or the
[2:22:16] ability of our president at a time like
[2:22:19] this when the whole world is laughing
[2:22:20] laughing at us and when the and when the
[2:22:22] whole world
[2:22:25] knows that he's probably not capable of
[2:22:28] zipping his own riches in the morning
[2:22:31] and yet he's the but he's our president
[2:22:34] and when I pray for him I pray that God
[2:22:37] will help him to serve out his
[2:22:41] days hopefully will end soon not his
[2:22:45] life days his office days if he were to
[2:22:48] walk in the room if I were to be invited
[2:22:50] where he was I would show him the same
[2:22:52] respect that I would show any other
[2:22:53] president I was tested on that I was not
[2:22:56] an Obama fan I knew many of the things
[2:22:59] that God had showed me about President
[2:23:02] Obama so it had nothing to do with the
[2:23:04] color of his skin I assure you that a
[2:23:07] th% a man who's capable of doing the job
[2:23:10] should do the job regardless of what
[2:23:12] color of his skin but God showed me the
[2:23:14] demon that was driving him to
[2:23:16] popularity I saw it I saw it behind him
[2:23:19] but I had opportunity to be in the room
[2:23:21] where the president was some years ago
[2:23:23] with my wife in Washington and I want
[2:23:26] you to know I showed him the same
[2:23:28] respect that I would have showed any
[2:23:30] president and I showed him the same
[2:23:32] respect stood clapped cheered just like
[2:23:35] I did when prime minister Netanyahu
[2:23:37] walked in the room not because I
[2:23:39] believed in in Obama's politics or
[2:23:42] because I liked what I had been shown in
[2:23:45] the spirit but because I learned early
[2:23:48] that we respect a man sometimes
[2:23:53] for his office because of who he is if
[2:23:56] you get a if you get a glimpse of that
[2:23:58] church it's not
[2:24:01] late if you get a glimpse of that then
[2:24:04] you can you can manage even when your
[2:24:06] dad
[2:24:09] wasn't wasn't the best
[2:24:11] dad he was still your
[2:24:14] dad oh lousy job he may have
[2:24:17] done but he was still your dad and you
[2:24:20] know what you needed him to get
[2:24:23] here and if it was a lousy example thank
[2:24:26] God thank God that you have made
[2:24:29] it really folks there's folks in this
[2:24:32] room that have made it you are not a
[2:24:34] reflection of your parents some of you
[2:24:36] had to fight all the way to where you
[2:24:39] are today without an example except what
[2:24:42] God gave you through the word and in
[2:24:44] that enough isn't that
[2:24:47] powerful so so some men are are measured
[2:24:51] by what they flee
[2:24:52] from and uh some
[2:24:55] men are measured by what they follow
[2:24:58] after godliness and righteousness and
[2:25:00] character in
[2:25:02] closing some men are measured by what
[2:25:04] they fight
[2:25:06] for the Bible tells us here fight the
[2:25:08] good fight in Greek that literally means
[2:25:12] agonizing the good
[2:25:15] Agony agonizing the good Agony fight the
[2:25:19] good fight Paul is in informing us that
[2:25:21] every step of the way there's going to
[2:25:23] be a fight to contend with if you think
[2:25:27] Christian life being a husband being a
[2:25:30] dad being a mom is an easy
[2:25:33] thing it's not at all being a
[2:25:37] grandparent it's a fight
[2:25:40] sometime it's a fight to be an example
[2:25:42] on your job Paul told Timothy in 1
[2:25:45] Timothy 1:18 this charge I commit unto
[2:25:48] thee Timothy according to the the
[2:25:50] prophecies which went forth before on
[2:25:53] thee that thou by them might War a good
[2:25:59] Warfare you take the promises of God
[2:26:02] over your life they're yay and amen and
[2:26:04] if you if that's all you can hold on to
[2:26:06] to fight hold on to that because some
[2:26:09] men are measured by what they fight
[2:26:12] for 2 Corinthians 10 verses 3 and 5 for
[2:26:16] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[2:26:19] wear War after the flesh come on let's
[2:26:23] go on for the weapons of our
[2:26:27] Warfare not carnal Mighty through God to
[2:26:29] the pulling down of of strongholds
[2:26:33] casting down imaginations and every High
[2:26:35] thing that exalteth itself against the
[2:26:38] knowledge of God and bringing into
[2:26:40] captivity every thought to The
[2:26:43] Obedience of Christ that's the good
[2:26:45] fight Ephesians 6 finally my brethren
[2:26:49] verse 10 be strong in the Lord Lord in
[2:26:50] the power of His might put on the whole
[2:26:52] armor of God that you may be able to
[2:26:54] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[2:26:56] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[2:26:58] against principalities against Powers
[2:27:00] against the rulers of the darkness of
[2:27:01] this world against spiritual wickedness
[2:27:03] in high places wherefore take unto you
[2:27:07] the whole armor of God that you may be
[2:27:08] able to withstand in the evil day and
[2:27:11] having done all to stand Brothers Godly
[2:27:14] men Godly dads don't check out on the on
[2:27:16] the
[2:27:17] fight our generation needs fighting men
[2:27:20] like we've never needed them before stay
[2:27:23] at your battle station and do the right
[2:27:26] thing keep being the example Godly
[2:27:30] example that you have set out to to be a
[2:27:34] Godly Man is measured by what he fights
[2:27:36] for we cannot become disconnected and
[2:27:39] isolated from the house of God we have
[2:27:42] to take the fight to the devil come on
[2:27:45] we've got to act like men in spiritual
[2:27:47] things too there are some things we
[2:27:49] ought to be will to fight for in our
[2:27:51] generation fight for your own personal
[2:27:53] identity as a man fight the battle for
[2:27:56] personal Holiness fight the battle for
[2:27:58] your family fight though the pain
[2:28:00] through the pain fight through the pain
[2:28:02] of living in a fallen world fight for
[2:28:04] some close Godly friends fight to have a
[2:28:08] strong faith there's so much more that
[2:28:10] could be said when asking what does a
[2:28:14] man of God look like perhaps the best
[2:28:16] way to summarize what a Godly Man looks
[2:28:19] like according to the Bible Bible is is
[2:28:20] with these words sacrificial
[2:28:25] love do what you do act like men do what
[2:28:29] you do with Love by
[2:28:33] love husbands love your wives even as
[2:28:35] Christ also loved the church and gave
[2:28:37] himself for it while this is referring
[2:28:39] to marriage it still captures the
[2:28:41] essence of biblical manhood and godly
[2:28:43] manhood leads to Godly fatherhood a man
[2:28:46] of God is Not self-centered he lives to
[2:28:48] love God and others his man main goal is
[2:28:50] not
[2:28:51] his a Godly Man doesn't have to be
[2:28:56] married to live a Godly
[2:29:00] life some people think that getting a
[2:29:03] wife solves all your struggles I can
[2:29:05] assure you it does
[2:29:08] not a Godly Man doesn't have to be
[2:29:11] married but he has to he certainly has
[2:29:13] to work against living a self-centered
[2:29:17] life if no one's depending on
[2:29:20] you then that's not what God wants for
[2:29:23] you ultimately a man of God will seek to
[2:29:26] live like
[2:29:27] Jesus for for Mark 10:45 for ev even the
[2:29:31] son of man came not to be ministered
[2:29:33] unto but to minister and to give his
[2:29:36] life a ransom for many I want you to
[2:29:38] know there are men and fathers in this
[2:29:40] church Godly examples who are always
[2:29:44] willing you don't ever have to
[2:29:47] anticipate or prepare for a no they're
[2:29:50] going to help you they may have to work
[2:29:53] it in but they're going to help you
[2:29:56] they're going to serve the body because
[2:29:59] they're Godly men I don't know if
[2:30:02] they've got any trophies at home for
[2:30:05] soccer or
[2:30:09] football I don't know if they've ever
[2:30:11] won any wrestling trophies or not I
[2:30:14] don't know what their accolades are
[2:30:16] according to the things of this world
[2:30:18] but I want you to know that there are
[2:30:20] fathers in this house that should be
[2:30:23] praised and you young
[2:30:27] people if you have a Godly
[2:30:29] father you should show him as much honor
[2:30:33] and respect as you possibly
[2:30:36] can one of the one of the things that
[2:30:39] you can
[2:30:40] do especially living in his home if
[2:30:43] you're living in his home is to not
[2:30:46] argue
[2:30:50] some people just have to be
[2:30:53] right sometimes it's the higher road to
[2:30:56] take the Lower
[2:30:58] Road and just not
[2:31:01] argue there is no way to measure
[2:31:04] musicians are
[2:31:05] coming there's no way to
[2:31:08] measure the value of a Godly Man in the
[2:31:12] home a Godly Man in the church
[2:31:15] Community a Godly
[2:31:18] father there's no no way to put a value
[2:31:21] on
[2:31:22] it if these Young
[2:31:24] [Music]
[2:31:27] Fathers and we've got
[2:31:29] some some amazing examples I didn't get
[2:31:33] to read all the tributes but I read the
[2:31:35] tribute that sister
[2:31:37] hope put on Facebook
[2:31:41] for brother
[2:31:46] Josh I believe she meant those words and
[2:31:49] I believe they were well spoken and well
[2:31:53] deserved he's just one of
[2:31:57] many setting an
[2:31:59] example for their children and for for
[2:32:03] the body for the for the church I want
[2:32:06] to tell you a story in
[2:32:09] closing there's a Godly family they
[2:32:12] Jesus named Pentecostals they're
[2:32:15] Apostolic they don't do things just like
[2:32:17] we do they don't believe things just
[2:32:20] like we
[2:32:20] believe but they've made an impression
[2:32:23] on my life through the years their
[2:32:25] Church their
[2:32:27] music their Godly
[2:32:30] example you've heard me talk about the
[2:32:32] mangun
[2:32:34] before from Alexandria
[2:32:36] Louisiana when our kids went to Youth
[2:32:39] Camp two years ago now they stopped
[2:32:43] by the Pentecostal Church there in
[2:32:46] Alexandria they weren't having a regular
[2:32:48] service in their Sanctuary huge
[2:32:51] unbelievable Sanctuary they were having
[2:32:53] it in the in a in another facility
[2:32:57] because they were rehearsing for their
[2:33:00] uh Easter drama that people come from
[2:33:03] all over the world to
[2:33:04] see and but they were so kind didn't
[2:33:07] know didn't know my family but they were
[2:33:09] so kind to them to meet them and even
[2:33:12] took them in and sat him down and let
[2:33:14] him watch the
[2:33:15] rehearsal treated him so respectful and
[2:33:18] I know they're they had no way of
[2:33:19] knowing
[2:33:20] anything about who they were and I
[2:33:21] thought to myself if they treat
[2:33:23] everybody like that no wonder they have
[2:33:26] had such great success in a city are you
[2:33:28] okay with me mentioning somebody that
[2:33:30] doesn't believe it maybe just like you
[2:33:31] believe it a number of years ago a
[2:33:34] deadly disaster was averted because of
[2:33:36] the prayers of a fighting
[2:33:40] father one who fought against some
[2:33:42] things and one who fought for some
[2:33:44] things Pastor Anthony
[2:33:46] Mangan he is the
[2:33:49] sort of the um Apostle of the church now
[2:33:53] Bishop of the church now his son is the
[2:33:56] pastor his dad was the founder Pastor
[2:34:01] Mangan and his father-in-law brother
[2:34:02] lumpin along with brother mangan's son
[2:34:05] Gentry all went out on the lake for an
[2:34:07] afternoon of water
[2:34:09] skiing the boat was loaded with skiing
[2:34:11] equipment and the gas tanks were filled
[2:34:13] for what was going to be an afternoon of
[2:34:15] fun at some point during the trip for
[2:34:18] whatever reason the gas gas tank burst
[2:34:21] into flames and the boat caught on fire
[2:34:24] with a small explosion taking place they
[2:34:27] were tossed into the water here was
[2:34:30] brother Anthony his son Gentry and his
[2:34:32] father-in-law brother lumpin with a
[2:34:33] burning boat and the deep water of the
[2:34:35] lake to contend with and brother lumpin
[2:34:39] would have been elderly already at this
[2:34:41] time if if my memory serves me correctly
[2:34:44] and hearing them tell the story once
[2:34:47] gently Gentry was probably around 10
[2:34:49] years old and so brother lumpin was
[2:34:51] already in his 60s if not 70s not in the
[2:34:54] greatest of Health can you imagine the
[2:34:56] fear and the panic and the uncertainty
[2:34:58] that these men were in on that day
[2:35:00] although the boat was severely damaged
[2:35:02] none of them were
[2:35:03] hurt they're floating around in the
[2:35:05] water until another boat nearby saw the
[2:35:08] explosion came over and pulled them out
[2:35:09] of the
[2:35:11] lake seems like problem averted but
[2:35:14] there was more to the story earlier in
[2:35:17] the week brother Anthony's dad the
[2:35:20] founding Pastor brother GA Mangan had
[2:35:22] felt a pressing burden with no
[2:35:24] explanation to pray for his son brother
[2:35:28] Anthony Not only was brother GA known
[2:35:30] for his praying he was known for fasting
[2:35:33] and so he didn't eat for several
[2:35:35] days because that burden would not leave
[2:35:38] him for his son with no apparent reason
[2:35:43] whatsoever he would go to the church
[2:35:45] early Before Dawn and spend hours
[2:35:47] praying for his son Without Really
[2:35:49] knowing the the reason for such deep
[2:35:50] prayer there were several times
[2:35:52] throughout the week that brother G would
[2:35:55] ask brother Anthony is everything all
[2:35:57] right son and he'd reply back
[2:35:59] everything's fine dad going great all is
[2:36:04] well what neither one of these men knew
[2:36:07] was there was a God who rich in Mercy
[2:36:11] who was pushing a
[2:36:13] father didn't tell him
[2:36:15] why we want to know all the detail
[2:36:17] didn't tell him why just told him
[2:36:20] there's a need and he'
[2:36:23] fought on his knees prayer rooms prayer
[2:36:27] altars and lingering in prayer can make
[2:36:31] so much of a difference on that day
[2:36:34] because of Elder mangan's prayers there
[2:36:36] were Angels hovering over a son a
[2:36:38] grandson and a dear friend it very well
[2:36:42] could have been the same angels that
[2:36:43] saved Daniel in the Lion's Den or those
[2:36:45] who wiped out sarb's army during Isaiah
[2:36:48] and hezekiah's time but on that day
[2:36:50] their assignment was in a lake in
[2:36:53] Alexandria because of the prayers of a
[2:36:56] fighting father fathers it's time for us
[2:36:59] to be measured by what we flee from by
[2:37:02] what we follow after and what we fight
[2:37:05] for I'm blessed I'm blessed to Pastor
[2:37:10] fathers and men like that let's stand
[2:37:22] we often talk about the importance of a
[2:37:24] Praying
[2:37:25] Mother but mama's not the only
[2:37:30] one that can
[2:37:32] pray we
[2:37:35] must we must learn to linger and tar in
[2:37:39] prayer when God puts a burden on our
[2:37:41] heart and we don't get immediately what
[2:37:43] it's about we can't give up we can't be
[2:37:47] discouraged and say well I don't know
[2:37:48] what it's about so I I guess is all
[2:37:49] right I guess everything's all
[2:37:52] right sometimes the lord has laid a
[2:37:54] prayer assignment on me I pray till I
[2:37:56] feel it lifting and and it's no time but
[2:37:59] here it comes back
[2:38:01] again I've been as a hobby last couple
[2:38:05] weeks to
[2:38:07] relax I've been working on my family
[2:38:12] tree I've laughed some I've cried
[2:38:15] some I I've been amazed at some of the
[2:38:19] things that you find in the newspaper
[2:38:22] about your family when you do a little
[2:38:25] research and uh I have over 2,000 people
[2:38:30] now in my family
[2:38:32] tree on both
[2:38:34] sides in doing that I was
[2:38:37] reminded I want to share this with you I
[2:38:40] know you're standing you can play
[2:38:41] something softly this is not a tear
[2:38:43] jerking thing it's a it's a a reminder
[2:38:47] of the importance of prayer
[2:38:50] my grandmother
[2:38:54] was from a family who had she had she
[2:38:57] had 15 brothers and
[2:39:00] sisters and one of her sisters died in
[2:39:05] childbirth and she raised her son as her
[2:39:10] own in fact for many years he didn't
[2:39:13] know he was adopted and unfortunately
[2:39:16] when he found out he was he was crushed
[2:39:20] he felt
[2:39:21] like somehow he'd been lied to in that
[2:39:25] generation it was believed that they
[2:39:28] should protect him and and cause him to
[2:39:31] feel as secure as he possibly could
[2:39:35] feel my grandmother had moved off the
[2:39:37] farm of course and was married and my
[2:39:40] dad was a young man and my mother was
[2:39:43] pregnant with me my parents divorced
[2:39:46] when I was
[2:39:47] five and my mother was expecting me in
[2:39:51] April of
[2:39:53] 1968 my
[2:39:55] grandmother her baby brother she was a
[2:39:58] twin her twin died at Birth his name was
[2:40:01] Adam her baby brother's name was Orlando
[2:40:05] Wilkenson and he was a little
[2:40:08] special I guess today they would say he
[2:40:11] was somewhere on the scale of autism
[2:40:14] nobody knew what to call it on the farm
[2:40:17] so he was just a simpleminded sort of
[2:40:19] young man wonderful personality and much
[2:40:23] loved by the family the baby the
[2:40:25] sweetheart of the family one day my
[2:40:27] grandmother Woke Up This is a
[2:40:29] grandmother's prayer but I want to
[2:40:31] remind you that you got to have got to
[2:40:34] pray a dad has to pray a father has to
[2:40:36] pray but this really came to my mind
[2:40:38] just in one day my grandmother woke up
[2:40:41] 70 miles from the farm here in
[2:40:43] Columbus and she had a
[2:40:45] burden and she was weeping in prayer
[2:40:48] praying in the spirit it and she said it
[2:40:51] was a death burden she said I had it
[2:40:53] several times before and I knew that
[2:40:56] somebody was going to die and there was
[2:40:58] nothing I could do to stop it but I had
[2:41:00] to pray that they would have an
[2:41:03] opportunity to find the Lord before they
[2:41:05] left and it lasted for days and she
[2:41:08] fasted and about third morning she woke
[2:41:11] up and the Lord spoke to her heart and
[2:41:12] said it's
[2:41:14] Orlando that you're burdened
[2:41:17] for and she drove she got in the car
[2:41:19] that afternoon and drove to the farm her
[2:41:22] mother was still alive at the time Miss
[2:41:25] Lizzy saved filled with a holy ghost she
[2:41:28] walked in the
[2:41:30] kitchen
[2:41:32] and I want I want to correct something
[2:41:34] she did not know it was Orlando the
[2:41:37] spirit of the Lord said go home go to
[2:41:39] Mama's house I'm going to use you today
[2:41:42] so she did she did not know yet who the
[2:41:45] death burden was for she said it she
[2:41:48] prayed until it lifted on on the way
[2:41:49] down 70 mies she walked into the kitchen
[2:41:52] of my great-grandmother's home and
[2:41:54] Orlando was standing in the door that
[2:41:56] led to the living room and she said that
[2:41:58] burden struck me harder than it had for
[2:42:00] the last few days and I began to
[2:42:03] weep she said I Orlando said Mildred are
[2:42:07] you okay and she said yes I will be I
[2:42:09] will be okay she said I leaned over the
[2:42:12] counter and I sobbed and prayed and
[2:42:15] cried out to God and stammering lips she
[2:42:18] said this was her description she said I
[2:42:20] had stammering lips and I couldn't I
[2:42:23] couldn't control my my burden I prayed
[2:42:27] until it started getting a little
[2:42:29] lighter and she turned to her brother
[2:42:32] who was still standing there really a
[2:42:35] faithful Watchman over her because he
[2:42:36] didn't know what was wrong with
[2:42:38] her he was standing right there and she
[2:42:41] said
[2:42:43] Orlando do you
[2:42:45] know that you've given your heart to
[2:42:48] Jesus Christ
[2:42:49] have you asked him to to I I'm not
[2:42:52] trying to scare you but have you asked
[2:42:54] him to save you to wash away your sins
[2:42:57] and to forgive you she said I know you
[2:43:00] and you're you're pretty pure in my
[2:43:02] opinion but if you've never asked Jesus
[2:43:05] into your heart you better do that he
[2:43:08] shook his head yes ma'am she said
[2:43:11] promise me that you will call on the
[2:43:15] Lord she said I'm going to pray for you
[2:43:18] now but I want you to call on the Lord
[2:43:20] for yourself when you have the
[2:43:22] opportunity she laid her hands on
[2:43:23] Orlando and he cried like a
[2:43:26] baby not quite 30 years old never
[2:43:31] married she said I prayed the rest of
[2:43:33] the day my mama was I scared my mom and
[2:43:36] she
[2:43:37] prayed she said I drove
[2:43:40] home my heart was broken I had a hole in
[2:43:44] it I didn't know what was going on I
[2:43:45] Didn't Know Why the burden was there I
[2:43:48] got home
[2:43:50] in the we hours of the night a sister
[2:43:53] called for prayer and I woke
[2:43:55] up and I was praying for this sister on
[2:43:59] the
[2:44:00] phone and the operator came on the line
[2:44:02] have you ever heard of such a thing as
[2:44:04] that that's the way it used to be

[2:44:15] to clear the line so that they can call

[2:45:14] brakes the car hit a big rock
[2:45:19] in the road
[2:45:20] and swerved toward the ditch and rolled
[2:45:24] over my dad was behind the vehicle
[2:45:27] watching the whole thing take place just
[2:45:29] ahead of him where my uncle was driving
[2:45:32] great uncle was in the passenger seat as
[2:45:35] it rolled it rolled again and it caught
[2:45:38] Orlando's neck and it was
[2:45:41] broken he was gone just that quick my
[2:45:44] uncle's life was shattered 17 years old
[2:45:48] total accident

[2:45:53] floor She Said Yes it hurt me so bad I I
[2:45:56] I needed to get up and get down there
[2:45:59] but I fell in the floor and I said
[2:46:00] granny because you were so brokenhearted
[2:46:02] yes she said yes but more than
[2:46:06] that I thanked
[2:46:08] God that he trusted me enough to give me
[2:46:13] a burden to
[2:46:14] pray sent me down there and I didn't
[2:46:17] know who I was why I was going but
[2:46:20] directed me and I spoke to Orlando and I
[2:46:22] have peace that he called on the Lord
[2:46:25] she said young and this is many years
[2:46:27] later I my mama was expecting me they'd
[2:46:30] gone hunting gone down home and went
[2:46:32] hunting she said what would have
[2:46:35] happened I would have lived the rest of
[2:46:37] my life not
[2:46:40] knowing she said as you grow old and you
[2:46:43] work for God if he puts a burden on your
[2:46:46] heart to pray don't demand to know
[2:46:48] everything about about it every detail
[2:46:50] don't take time to just
[2:46:53] pray I said you mean granny you can just
[2:46:55] pray Lord I don't even know why I'm
[2:46:57] praying or who I'm praying for
[2:47:00] yes just be a Watchman on the wall and
