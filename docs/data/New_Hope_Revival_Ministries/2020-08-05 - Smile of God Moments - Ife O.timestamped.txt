[0:00] because of the joy that comes when you
[0:02] feel the smile
[0:03] from within
[0:13] i want you to know obeying jesus is joy
[0:16] knowing that you're doing what the
[0:18] spirit bid you to do
[0:20] is joy unspeakable there's no room for
[0:23] dread
[0:24] there's no room for drudge in obeying
[0:27] god by the spirit
[0:29] but i want you to know jesus came to
[0:31] give us joy
[0:33] in obeying him and he said i'm going to
[0:36] do something for them
[0:37] that they never expected i'm not only
[0:39] going to save them by my blood
[0:41] but i'm going to crawl inside of them
[0:45] by my spirit and fill them with the
[0:49] goodness of me
[0:50] so that they can obey me with joy so
[0:53] that they can serve me with liberty
[0:55] and it doesn't mean we're wild and loose
[0:58] and
[0:59] our freedom has caused greasy grace it
[1:01] means we want to get closer to him
[1:03] live a more dedicated and more
[1:05] sanctified more consecrated life
[1:08] because of the joy that comes when you
[1:11] feel the smile
[1:12] from within oh most of us are looking
[1:15] for the smile
[1:16] from without it's because of where we've
[1:19] been in our life
[1:20] we're looking for somebody to accept us
[1:23] it's normal it's natural
[1:24] we're looking for someone to accept us
[1:27] we're looking for someone to agree with
[1:29] us
[1:29] someone to like us someone who's willing
[1:32] to be with us
[1:33] we're looking for a smile from without
[1:36] when you get it rejoice and even if you
[1:38] don't rejoice
[1:39] because that's not the smile that
[1:41] matters the smile that matters is the
[1:43] one that comes from within
[1:45] and i don't mean from the human spirit
[1:47] of man i mean from the god
[1:49] who lives inside of you when the
[1:51] father's pleasure
[1:53] over your life becomes an inward reality
[1:56] i tell you it don't matter then what
[1:59] goes on around you
[2:00] you just say i can do this thing because
[2:03] greater
[2:04] is he that is in me than he that is in
[2:07] the world and he
[2:08] loves me he's not out to get me he's out
[2:12] to get me
[2:16] he's pulling me into him
[2:23] you
