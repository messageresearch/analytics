[Music] how I love Jesus [Music] because he first love me sing that line again because he first love me let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise the Bible tells us to do it the Bible said clap your hands all you people shout unto God with the voice of Triumph Hallelujah my old granny used to say this is the quietest world you're ever going to live in yeah sometimes people get nervous when it gets loud do you get nervous at a football game you get nervous in a fight I don't mean with your husband I meant boxing that'll make anybody nervous oh my I always just told him if you don't like shouting you better stay off of my cloud because I plan to give him praise there's something about when we give God extravagant praise that's the best we have it may not sound as pretty as somebody else is or look as you know dignified as somebody else's but you know that's not what it's about it's about giving God what he deserves I could never praise him enough for what he's already done for me I don't know about your life but my 54 years have been blessed because of him it's been life to me we want to welcome you to this service tonight what a wonderful atmosphere is here to get us started we have to push you always do you have to push all the yuck out and get ready to receive all the glory we've come from different places many have worked all day drug in tired and had to work had to come in and give of themselves on the music and there's always the first time visitors here have never been and they're going to check us out and we're going to check them out we're going to get all that over with tonight all the checking out I'm gonna look at you you're gonna look at me and we're either going to like what we see or not but like it or not we're stuck with each other for the next few nights so we better just learn to get along and let God have his way and then there's a host of people who are not here physically but who are streaming this service in the nations of the world and we send the love of Jesus to you and our thanks that you would take the time to be with us tonight we always have our midweek service on Tuesday night so uh it's very likely that there are people watching right now from across the world some who get up in the middle of the night as far away as Japan to be a part of our service and we want to welcome everybody we believe that God has an appointment with every one of us here this week and we believe he's going to have his way if you and I will not get in his way but yield to him let him do what he wants to do and we'll sort it out later if there's anything to sort out you know what I mean by that if somebody gets a little out of the way let them we'll sort that out later I'd Rather somebody get a little out of the way in their praise than to sit on their hands come on now we he's been too good to us for us to keep quiet now amen so we want to get ready very shortly from now to hear the word of the lord we believe that God gave brother Greeley a word from God for us on Sunday that positioned us strategically for the course of the next few days and His glory has been on everything everything that has been done his glory his presence has been on it and we're expecting him to move among us we've been a little bit in camp meeting for months now just not night after night so this is our chance to come and you know it it can build if we let it the body gets tireder but our spirit gets a little brighter and a little a little higher and we just keep reaching up by Sunday morning we might take the roof right off of this place I just want what he wants we want to see Souls saved we want to see somebody baptized with the Holy Ghost we want to see bodies healed we want to see the Lord reveal his word to you and to me that we can know more of him he's still revealing himself he's still unfolding himself and so we're expecting something good from the Lord tonight so let's get the offering out of the way offering is part of worship we're not going to say a whole lot about it tonight it's a part of worship even though our camp meeting is not a world attended there are still needs there are still expenses and we're just believing that God will meet every need and you know I had a phone call today from Jerusalem brother Isaac stoltzfus our one of our former Amish Brethren is in Jerusalem and he said he said this is an amazing time but he said there's just one thing that would make it better and I said what is that brother he said if you were with us because we don't even know what we're looking at then he told me something so I just go into tour guide mode on the phone and and I literally God helped me he had to help me and I said yeah you come out of dungate you turn left you go to the next Road you turn right it's probably about all 50 steps down the hill and the sign will be on the left he said my goodness he said I didn't know I was going to get directions like that and then he thrilled me he said we were busy trying to finish up my son is here with me with some other folks and we've been trying to finish up my son's ticket he's changing his ticket I said oh he is yes he's coming home early I said I said oh I'm sorry to hear that he said he's coming to your camp meeting [Music] I said well I'm glad to hear that where's Joshua river is he Joshua hold up your hand let everybody see that's where you can sow a hand anyway uh that's our Second Son and uh just as important to us as the first son he's just second born and uh sorry Benjamin but it's true Joshua said Dad he said I just don't know if I would leave Jerusalem to come to camp meeting he said you're gonna have to forgive me but the group is coming uh one van load is coming Friday and some more are coming on Saturday from Indiana and he's going to wait on him a couple hours at the airport they said and they're going to swing by and pick him up fresh from Jerusalem he just said he had a desire to be here he wanted to be or he felt to be here and you must really feel that if you leave if you leave Israel to come to camp meeting in Alabama but uh I it thrilled me because you know it could be the Lord has an appointment with him and I know God could meet him there or meet him anywhere but maybe the Lord has purpose to meet him here how many of you want to be where God wants you to be I mean all the time I want to be where he wants me to be all the time there are Divine appointments that are set up for us in restaurants in shopping places and I just asked the Lord Lord please give me all of mine and and wherever I but Lord please don't give me one in Walmart because I just don't go there please choose the place I go and if you want me to go there you better let me know because unless you're gonna send me I'm not going there's just some places we just don't want to be sometime but anyway uh we don't have to talk about giving you understand how important it is it is worship God receives it that way I know every need is going to be met Elias and Austin would you come and hold the offering bag tonight well I think we better let you go around it's Tuesday night let's break the people in gently sister Jeffrey has a song come on and sing for us Hallelujah [Applause] I guess I should have called her before I started the see I don't I don't run the service I don't lead the service that often and I

grandparents are their grandchildren are beautiful my beautiful Ariel chicar chemical burns on her knees Wednesday and it looked really really bad and foreign so every day she would get up and she would say is it does it look any better Mama does it look any better every day she got up expecting for there to be Improvement and so I was at Walmart Monday in the parking lot in my car and I was talking to Jennifer and I was talking to her about Ariel and I said I just believe that God's going to heal her and there's not going to be any scars and when I said that something hit me and I went into uh travail for my granddaughter in the car in Walmart parking lot and I know with everyone else's prayers Jennifer showed me a picture of them today oh my they look so good compared to what if

I can't do that not tonight but I will I'll do my best before this week is over but I do need to make mention of the fact that there's one family that is extremely well represented here tonight I mean you know when you talk about a clan a big old group of family they are here and they've come from a long way I have been saying Goss because sister Rebecca is a Goss well they're not all bosses and they don't want they don't want to wear that but I was saying that so that you would know it was Sister Rebecca's family but they're the Lawler Family Sister Terry is the mother and you get to know

front from Texas [Laughter] God bless every one of you all right let's just ask the Lord to come and use our brother to minister to us father we just look to you right now and we know Lord that you have chosen brother Greeley for this moment for this evening we know that the word of the Lord is on him and in him and we know that you've given him a message for us tonight and we know Lord that it's not just up to him it's up to us as well we have to use the faith that you have given us to pull on the gift that is in his life Lord we watch what happens when the people get behind the preacher it just moves and directs the spirit of God in his thoughts and needs are met and even questions are answered and so Lord we ask tonight that you would not only use him for your glory and anoint him as he delivers your word but Lord use us show us teach us how to use our faith to pull on the gift of God and we know that you will have your wonderful way in the remaining part of this service we dedicate not only tonight but this entire week and weekend to you for the glory of God we thank you for the Feast of Sukkot it's one of the feasts that you have mentioned in the word that is Perpetual it is an eternal celebration to the Lord and we thank you for it because it brings us joy and it causes us to pull together in a particular way we know you're going to speak to us Lord maybe this week even in ways that we have not expected and we want to position our hearts right now in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said sing this with me as brother Greely prepares to come word of God Speak word of God I pray washing my eyes your majesty no no that you're in this place please let me stay and rest best in your holiness word of God speaks sing it with me again word of God Speak would you pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know that you're in this place please let me stay and rest in your Holiness word of God speaks one last time the word of God Speak would you pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know you're in this place please let me stay and rest in your Holiness word of Godspeed I don't have time to tell you tonight how much this man means to me and I don't know anybody anywhere in any Nation that I have more confidence and more trust in than I do brother Greeley he is a faithful man he's a man of integrity and he's a man of Prayer anything you have need of you ought to be able to get it tonight because he has prepared his heart to be just a pipeline for God to flow through word of God's speech would you pour down [Music] in your Holiness word of God speak sing one more time [Music] would you pour down my grace washing my eyes to [Music] smash [Music] let me stay and rest in your holiness word of God speaks [Music] our father that is our desire tonight is for your word to speak into our lives Lord we know that there are all varieties of people in this place with varieties of backgrounds and varieties of needs but you the one true Living God know all of them in our mother's womb when we were yet in secret you Lord were forming us and shaping us and then at a pointed time you called us into the Earth to be expressed now Lord you have chosen for us to be sitting in this place tonight there are those that are watching on the other end of that camera that you chose for this moment and so God we're asking you by your Divine Design tonight you would take words of the lips of clay and that you would speak to the needs individually God even though it may sound like the same English word you can take it and you can speak it in your Divine Manner and I'm calling on you to do that tonight oh Lord hide this vessel I pray behind the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ and only let yourself be seen God will give you glory and honor and praise for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen amen Hallelujah while you're standing will you turn with me to Judges chapter 16. thank you to the Musicians I appreciate so much the gifting of God that you've let shine through your lives be a part of this service to help to set the atmosphere I have been pondering my actions on Sunday and there's some times when you jump around like a kangaroo you go away you feel foolish and you don't need to feel sorry for me because the lord gave me an answer standing right there Jeremiah said it feels like fire shut up in my bones and when you feel like fire is shut up in your bones you just don't know what to do with it and sometimes you stomp and sometimes you spin around in circles sometimes you jump up and down and so I'm just asking the Lord did every one of us before this week is out we'll experience that that energy inside of you that Supernatural you see friends it's not natural it's something that comes from another realm and I don't know how to explain it I was trying to find English words and that's what the Lord said it's like fire shut up in my bones and I'm looking for it again tonight and I'm looking for it to touch me and to touch you and to touch us every night this week because God has met he has designed a Divine appointment with us he is designed a sovereign move of God Among Us and I think that probably every night is going to look different from the night before and that's the way we want it we don't want to be able to design or control God in a box we want him to come and do something so mighty so Sovereign so Supernatural that no man can Define it and if we get a little out of control just don't worry about it God will bring everything right back into his perfect order because when Fire gets inside people act a little strange but I know that God is on the Move he's on the Move he's on the move Judges chapter 16. and I think that I want to start where did I tell you I was starting 21 I have 25 written here but 21 is where I want to start because the theme of this camp meeting is come and see and we're going to start with the Philistines put in the eyes of Samson out but the Phyllis Phyllis took him and put out Fetters of brass and did and he did grind in the prison house how be it the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven then the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for their ought to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their God and to Rejoice for they said our God hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God for they said our God hath delivered our hands into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for Samson that he may make a sport and they called for Samson out of the prison house and he made them Sport and they set him between the pillars and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that beheld while Samson made Sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once o God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was born up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so that the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats tonight foreign I don't know who all is listening so we'll just give a little background to Samson this was in the time of the judges of Israel and the people were wandering here and there they really didn't have a lot of leadership and there was a woman her husband's name was Manoa but her name was not given apparently the Lord did not think it mattered all that much but one thing that I find extremely interesting was that the angel of the Lord came to her he did the angel of the Lord did not go to her husband but this woman was Barren she wanted a child and she sought the Lord about this child in the Angel of the Lord came to her and said that you're going to conceive and you're going to Bear a child and she later he laid the angel of the Lord laid out to this woman exactly what should be the the lifestyle of this child he was to be a Nazarite unto the Lord and he was not to have to partake of wine and strong drink he was not to allow his hair to be cut because therein was his strength it was a it was a covenant between him and the Lord but uh each after this Angel comes to manoa's wife she goes and tells her husband uh listen this Angel the angel of the Lord came to me and told me that we're going to have a son and what this whole thing is going to look like well Manoa he's a little shook up he wants to know you know what's going on and he wanted the angel to come to him and so he went and he sought the Lord would you please let the angel come to me and explain the same thing to me well Jehovah sneaky decided to show up to the wife again rather than showing up to the husband he shows up to manoa's wife again and manola's wife had to run and go find him and she says come quickly this Angel has showed up again now the good thing that we can say about that is that God answered his prayer it didn't come maybe the way that Manoa wanted it but God came and showed himself once again to uh to Manoa and to his wife and gave them instruction concerning the son Samson and Samson the Bible said begin to grow and in the spirit of the Lord would come upon him in the camp at times it probably wasn't real evident what was going on in his life but God was upon him and would come upon him at different times in his life and so Samson he he starts growing up and started getting his eye on women now these were Israelites Manoa and his wife and God had already laid out a pattern for their lifestyle he had called them to come out and be separate from other nations he wanted them to be different than every Other Nation God's covenant people and he wanted them to have the the the very essence of Heaven in their lives and he wanted them to display it in the Earth but as is with all Humanity there's always something that is pulling on them down in the natural and so because it's what they see with their natural eye they began to gravitate toward natural instead of Supernatural every one of us are guilty of it we because that we look around and we see different things we see somebody gaining some wealth and so the enemy uses that against us and starts pulling on us to try to get us to build wealth and forget the kingdom and if by some means God allows a man or a woman to to gain some wealth then the enemy wants them to become so concentrated on building that wife that it pulls them away from the house of the Lord it pulls them away some from their families and even it pulls them away from really building the kingdom and they start building their own kingdom because pride is something that man is dealing with just the same as the devil the enemy that angel Lucifer in Heavenly places Pride begin to get to him and he wanted to build his own kingdom and that spirit is not dead that spirit is trying to reach out in order people to be so enveloped in their own Pride that they forget the things of God and they go their own way but if God can ever get a hold of a man ever really get a hold of a man and that man can become so sold out to God thank you sometimes it takes extreme heartaches horrible heartaches in order to get a man into the place where God can completely use him I think sometimes about brother Branham and how that he he he was an humble man he was a a man that was poor but yet he went through such horrible tragedies in order for God to hone him into the man that he was supposed to be so that when he was standing before the people and that gift was in operation he was not susceptible to walk away and be proud and lifted up from it but he knew that it was a gift that God had placed in his life and he wanted to be totally yielded to that Holy Spirit in his life so that nothing would uh would magnify William Branham but it would magnify the Lord Jesus Christ so Samson now this man he's he's got his eye kind of roving looking at Philistine women instead of Israelite women and as he begins to look the Bible tells us that he finds one that he wants and he goes and he tells his parents I want this particular woman and his parents didn't understand what God was doing and and so uh they didn't want him to have a Philistine though don't you understand Samson that we're under their bondage we we just really don't want to want you to take this woman to be your wife but yet Samson said I want her so now the wedding is set in order the feast is set in order and they're going down to this Philistine wedding and along the way Samson encounters a lion and he tears him in pieces and leaves his carcass the the carcass of the lion laying beside the road and goes on to the wedding so all of these things are transpiring and and and I I you'll have to go back and read the story because my mind is is is getting uh messed up here because there ended up honey in the carcass of that lion all right and so when it goes to this wedding feast and he begins to tell them I got a riddle for you and if you can settle this riddle if you can come up with the answer to this riddle at the end of this Feast I will give you each a change of garments there were 30 of his companions that were there and and he wanted to if if they figured it out okay I'll I'll just give you these garments and at the end of it uh if if you if you don't figure it out I am going to uh require that you give me 30 changes of garments and so his wife is at him all this seven days at him oh come on you got to tell me you you can't leave me hanging you got to tell me what the answer is to this riddle well Samson said I didn't even tell my parents about it why am I going to tell you but she kept after at him she kept at him until that Samson finally gives her the answer to the riddle and then of course she goes and tells all of his companions because listen friends she was a Philistine the spirit of the Philistine was in her and she had all of these 30 companions that of samsons that were Philistine as well and she wanted did it she did not want the wrath of these 30 people on her she's probably getting this idea that I'm gonna marry this man and and he's of a of a whole different race of people and their Customs are all different and I don't know exactly how I'm going to fit in with this crazy bunch of people and and I I've got to have something to run back to if if if this doesn't work out and and so I'm just wondering uh I can't let this happen to my companions here and so she says come on Samson you got to tell me what's going on here what is the answer to your riddle and finally he tells her she goes and tells these guys and Samson's a little upset well the spirit of God came on Samson and he got the 30 garments but there were 30 Philistines that lost their lives in order for these garments to be given to these 30 companions now the story goes on that Samson he must have had a pouting problem don't know exactly what was going on with him but he went somewhere other than to his wife and in the process of time he decides I think I want her again and so he goes to find her and when he goes to find her he finds out that her dad gave her to another guy now this creates a problem Samson is offered the younger daughter the dad even says she's more fair than the older one you can have her if you'd like well Samson wanted his wife the one that he was supposed to have and he was now Angry that he did not uh that that the father-in-law would not give her to him and so he goes and he finds 300 foxes and he ties their tails together and sets them on fire and sends them through all the corn fields and the wheat fields and it starts burning down all of the crops and the trees and the houses and there is chaos everywhere listen Samson was a mess but God used him through all of his mess to do exactly what he said he was going to do because God had a vendetta I'm going to say he had a he had somewhat against the Philistines and he was going to use Samson to take some of them out he even used him or when when they began to say who did this oh it was Samson and so they go to the Israelites and they say you better give them to us so all of these Israelites they come to Samson he's on top of a mountain on top of a hill and they said listen Samson there's going to be some Bloodshed if you don't turn yourself in please let us take you down to these people and he said okay you can take me down to them you can even tie me up as long as you don't take my life they said you've got our worry you've got our word we won't hurt you just let us tie you up take you down to the Philistines deposit you there and we're out so that's exactly what they do but as Samson comes in to the camp of the Philistines bound up with ropes he all of the spirit of the Lord comes upon him now his muscle mass was useless until God got on him but when God got on him whom Mass changed and it's just like I was telling you a while ago it must have been like fire shut up in his bones and he had to do something about it and he began to just Flex a little bit and these ropes broke and laying there on the ground was a Jawbone of a of an ass and he started picks it up and the Bible said he slew a thousand Philistines now these Philistines were the enemy of God they had been by enemy for many many years constantly at the people of God every time you turn around you see that the Philistines are trying to take the people of God out and God would let them go sometimes he'd let them defeat the Israelites and other times God would let the Israelites defeat them God is using Samson to take these Philistines out one by one by one by one so now he's got this Jawbone in his hand and he starts taking them down one by one and he doesn't really understand what is happening he it's just the spirit of God upon him I don't know that his parents were ever able to explain to him exactly what the call of God was on his life even though the angel came to them and told them how to raise him what to help him to avoid what to be aware of in his life his parents really did not understand this spirit of God that came upon him when when it when it happened and they were they were just as oblivious probably to things as others were around him but God had his hand upon Samson and his Samson stayed yielded to the things of God God used him in a marvelous and a magnificent way and here he is with just a Jawbone a bone not a pipe not a piece of iron not a gun a bone and God got in the hand God in the man got in the bone and took out a thousand Philistines it's amazing what God can do when he has a yielded vessel [Music] what is in your hand use it that's what he told Moses Moses what is in your hand throw it down came a serpent I'll pick it back up stick again what do you have in your hand use it for the glory of God so now Samson he's still messing around with these Philistine women and and the Bible now after he's defeated these thousand Philistines the Bible tells us that Samson he started messing with prostitutes no more marriage prostitutes and he starts going down and he found one that he liked real well and her name was Delilah he apparently frequented Delilah and he goes down and he talks to her and he spends the night with her Time After Time After Time well the Philistines come to Delilah they said you know we could really give you a payoff if you could get the secret out of that old boy if you can get the secret out of him well the Bible says that Samson loved Delilah he loved this woman even though she was from the brothel he loved her and he went to her frequently and when he went to her frequently he uh she starts working on him because the Philistines are working on her ah you know we can give you a good payout we can set you up for Life you'll never have to bring another man into your house we'll give you a big house and it'll be all yours and and you won't have to do that business anymore we will set you up if you will help us to take him out so she begins to work on him Samson what is it where is your strength what is it that's in your strength that is is keeping you keeping the Philistines from conquering where is your strength where does it lay now I don't know how many nights days that it takes Delilah to work on him but the Bible gives us four specific instances that he gave her an answer that she tried now folks I want you to know your name is not Samson and the Philistines are not what are dealing what you're dealing with but I want you to know you are a child of God with a calling on your life and the same devil that tried to take Samson out is trying to work on you he is trying to take you out the same as he took Samson out because you have a Divine destiny that is to be carried out in the earth and the enemy wants to disturb it he wants to destroy it he wants to stop it he wants to disrupt it he wants to do anything that he can to keep you from fulfilling your god-given destiny in the earth and so Samson is he's he's laying in her lap and he says Samson baby Samson would you please tell me why don't you just tell me and he says well if if you bind me up with seven green whiffs or new not dried out ropes if you'll bind me up with that I'll be just like everybody else I won't be able to get out of them and so she does exactly that and she says the Philistines be upon you and he breaks out of them leaves the house but it does not stop Samson from having an attraction to Delilah what is your Delilah what keeps pulling you back come on because there are things that pull us over and over again and if we don't cut the head off of this serpent that serpent will keep coming back keep coming back keep coming back now we cannot physically take a sword we keep one here just in case oh come on we do we cannot physically take a sword and cut the head off of our enemy but the way we have to cut him off is quit giving him the attention that he is longing for Samson kept going back he knew that she was after him he knew that she wanted the secret after out of him for for his strength but yet there was something in him that kept going back and that is why we preach around here that people should not engage in sexual activity before marriage because there is a soul tie that happens between a man and a woman and it causes a man and a woman to keep wanting to come back there was a soul tie between Samson and Delilah that kept pulling him back because they had become one and there was something that kept pulling him back even though he knew that she wanted his secret and so he goes back a second time and and she's at him again baby you fooled me once oh darling I love you so much but you won't tell me what your secret is and so since uh Samson says bind me fast with new ropes never used and I'll be just like everybody else so Delilah does exactly that she binds him up again and she says Samson the Philistines now listen friends she always waited till he was asleep that's why the Bride of Jesus Christ cannot sleep we've got to watch and be faithful in prayer because the enemy like a roaring lion is always seeking whom he may devour he's looking to destroy your life so Samson the Philistines are upon you and he breaks out of the ropes again and he goes off but that tie is still there there's something there that keeps pulling him back and there are people that are sitting under the sound of my voice tonight that are being pulled back to the same Vice over and over and over again and my recommendation to you this week in this Sovereign move of God in this holy convocation is for you to press into the spirit every day and every night until that thing is broken out of your life Deliverance there's Deliverance here friends there's Deliverance here oh and I want to warn you of something we're tongue talkers around here and in case you would misunderstand I just want to give you some clarification of why we do not in broad spectrum I'm going to give you a narrow Spectrum but when we begin to pray over somebody in another language in another tongue it is because God wants to do something phenomenal for you or for me it may only be for myself edifying myself but here's the way I explained it just a few weeks ago at another church let's just say sitting among us there is a person who comes to me and says I have sugar diabetes and I want to be healed from sugar diabetes well because I'm human because I know this person I know that they love their chocolate cake they love their ice cream they love their sweet tea and they don't seem to stop it they just go get them another shot or whatever it is of insulin to be able to bring their sugar down if I pray for them I'm in English I am going to have an opinion no matter what the disease is if I know him and I know their characteristics I may pray my opinion I may even stop and give them my opinion but if you will allow us to get under the spirit of God and let the Holy Ghost pray over you then the spirit of God can pray over you and he can intercede on your behalf way above my opinion and he can get the job done bypassing my opinion my intellect my thought process and we can when it's all said and done we can say thank you Lord you got that under control without my opinion [Music] so that's just that's just a for your information if you come and you let us pray for you and there seems to be a lot of tongue talking it's just simply because we want the spirit to pray over you instead of our own opinion so now Samson he's he's he's he's being pulled back to this woman over and over again as some sitting here or across that camera are being pulled back to the same Vice over and over again because there's some kind of a pool in the soul realm in the mind the will and the emotions that are pulling you back to that same Vice over and over again now we could sit here and we could talk about smoking we could talk about drinking we could talk about homosexuality or promiscuous uh sex or any variety of things but you know let's get down to as we were talking about Sunday and gossip and backbiting and pride and thinking more of ourselves than we ought to you know all of these things are things that cause us to be drawn back that's right because they bring a Feeling now there are people who have issue with us because we get a little Rowdy around here they tell us that we're basing too much on feelings shame on him but there are people who live in the natural Realm where that narcissism gives them a Feeling Pride gives them a Feeling certain sexuality gives them a Feeling it causes them to have a high well I would rather have a high in the Holy Spirit than to keep being drawn back to that same uh besetting sin that keeps me away from a real move of God in my life that keeps me from performing my predestined plan of God in the Earth we need to break these things need to allow the spirit of God to break them in our life but as I said on Sunday sometimes it takes part of our action sometimes it takes throwing that rock in the air to get things in the spirit moving Lord I'm activating my faith maybe it's just a step forward when the preacher says take a step forward maybe you're so determined that instead of one step you take two steps and you say God I am so determined to break this thing in my life that I am doing this prophetic act at the behest of this servant of the Lord he said do something and so I'm doing something because I want this thing broken in my life because I don't want to be a Samson I don't want my eyes poked out come on come on now Sampson pulled back to this woman a third time and every time that he goes she's pulling him closer and closer and closer to being burned so the third time she says now Sam you fooled me twice baby you've given me these reasons why and all this and so Samson he gets even closer to the reality the truth of where his strength is up to his hair and he says weave my Seven Locks with the web so she lets him go to sleep gives him what he wants and lets him go to sleep starts weaving this through his hair what that looks like I don't know exactly but I just want you to know it was getting too close to the calling of God in his life it was getting too close but when she woke him up Samson the Philistines are on you he gets up and he walks out the beam the web everything I don't know how big it was but he just got up and walked out it hindered him none because the secret was not yet out but Samson was still drawn to this woman I do not know what was going through his mind when he gave her that secret that close to the reason of his calling his hair when when God said that he wasn't supposed to drink strong drink and he wasn't supposed to let any razor come to his head a Nazarite vow also includes I believe dead things right and and don't touch dead things so we have the lion there's things already against him but yet God was still upon him because he still had that Nazarite vow of the hair and she he was he was given her way too close but yet he keeps being drawn back to this woman and as he is being drawn back to this woman over and over and over again he does not realize that there's going to come a final time all of his defenses are being broken down all of his inhibitions all of the all of the secrets that he's kept all of these years all of those Philistines that he has killed in the past because he kept the Covenant with the Lord all of that he's forgetting all of that not realizing that when the when the hair is gone that the strength is gone too the spirit of the Lord would depart he he thinks that he can do it amen but yet he's drawn back to this woman and she says now Samson you have you have told me lie after lie after lie you've told me where your strength would be at and it's not the truth now baby if you really love me if you really love me if you really love me you'll tell me now let's just call this what it is it was an abusive relationship it was because she knew all the while what she was after she was not after a relationship with Samson the Bible said Samson loved her but it listen come on she had a really she had a calling from the Philistines via what she had a calling from the devil via the Philistines and she had something that she was going to accomplish and she was going to do she was going to keep at it until she got what she wanted she wanted to destroy the man of God because she knew that the man of God was destroying her uh her people and they now she was no doubt going to get a big payout from it [Music] and so she wanted that payout but the fact remained she was a Philistine and it was her people that were being destroyed by this man and so she was kind of on board even though the money was another glitzy thing to draw her she was on board with them to get the secret out of this man and so Samson he goes to her this one final time and his defenses are being broke down broke down broke down now friends I want to tell you something this is exactly how it happened in the Garden of Eden oh when that serpent came to the woman she didn't have a name yet when that serpent came to the woman in the garden he did not beguile her the first time he worked on her mind over and over and over and over again breaking down her defenses over and over and over again and there must have been something in that serpent that was attractive because she kept coming back to find him and when she came back to find him he always had another lovey-dovey story to tell her yeah because he had an ultimate goal and it wasn't just to confuse her mind he did not want her to partake of the Tree of Life he wanted her to partake of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil he wanted to disrupt the whole plan of God but he's only the tool [Music] now Samson is in the same position as the woman was because his mind is being broke down broke down his his defenses against the spirit of the Philistines is broke down now I would just in a natural sense the Philistines were the enemy of Israel why would I go visit them yeah the Israelites were an enemy of Israel why would I go take a wife of them the Israelites were the enemy to Philistines the Philistines enemy to Israel why would I go to their house of prostitution and find me a woman and why would I keep going back to her and revealing my secrets now friends we sitting here have a bridal Authority and we have some Bridal secrets that the enemy would like to take and defile them and keep them from ever coming to fulfillment and that is why the Holy Spirit over and over again pulls us back and says better get control of your mind you better get control of your mind you better get control of your mind because that's where the enemy keeps coming This Is Where It Starts before the action ever takes place Samson was laying in the lap of Delilah and she is working on his mind why baby are you withholding this information from me come on you gotta tell me I don't know where Samson had been I don't know what he had encountered I don't know if he was just tired that particular night I don't know whether he had just been broken down so far in his mind till that he thought what's the use why why do I have to keep this secret I've already I've already had strong drink I broke that part of it I've already been around dead animals I broke that part of it what's another thing what does it matter I may as well just tell her and What's It Gonna matter but it mattered to God it mattered to God because when he gave her that secret she knew she knew that this time he had not lied to her this time he did not withhold the secret but he said a razor has never come to my head if you cut my hair off I will be as other man and she knew that he had given her the genuine secret of his strength and as she gives him she lets him fall off to sleep she's got men waiting listen boys I want you to know this is no fake out this time I know that he gave me his secret and I want you to be ready because I am going to cut his hair off and you're going to come in and take him well when she said Samson the Philistines are upon you Samson got up and he said I will go out and be as at other times not knowing that the spirit of the Lord had departed from him there is a day that you can go too far the Bible as we just read said that the first thing that they did when they took Samson captive was they put his eyes out the enemy wants to do the same thing to you he wants to put your eyes out he wants to put your spiritual sight out so that all of you that all that you see is the natural you quit seeing the spiritual you quit seeing the things of God you may still read your Bible but it's a dead letter you may even still speak in tongues but the spirit of God has Departed because the enemy has put out your spiritual eye and has caused you to become critical caused you to want to criticize everybody in the house might raise you up in Pride might do all kinds of things because he wants us to stay in the natural realm he does not want us to see the spirit Realm when they put Samson's eyes out they took him down to the grinding house all of my life I think about Samson down at the grinding house I can see him as one of the mules behind one of these bars that stick out it goes around in a circle all day long round in a circle all day long has no eyesight but all he's doing is going in a circle so he's not really but he's just grinding I read another thought today and I thought it could be just as monotonous and this idea was that Samson was sitting in the floor with a small bowl like a mortar and pestle just grinding all day long now either way it's boredom lots of time to think about all of those things of the past all of the ways that God used him all of the Philistines that were killed and now I'm in captivity it's going around in circles around in circles do you know that there are hundreds of people in this world who are in a prison of their mind there are preachers who have become so discouraged by what they saw in their congregation their spiritual eyes were put out and they just quit and now all they're doing is sitting in their recliner thinking about the good old days how the spirit of God will used to move how the things used to be but they got burned out they don't have any Vision left because the enemy came and put out their spiritual eyesight folks were blessed around here because the God has allowed us to Time After Time when the enemy wanted to put out the eyesight of the man of God wanted to put out your eyesight there was somebody to encourage you let's get back in the fight you cannot stop you've got to get your Eagle Vision back [Applause] you gotta get your vision back and you just remember we had a prophet in our day that said even John the Baptist his Eagle Vision got clouded over after all that he saw after renouncing that the Messiah was on the earth that's him the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world but he got put in prison and his Eagle Eye got clouded over oh something had to come along to clear his vision the Prophet Elijah after he had been on the mountain and had that great Mountain Carmel Showdown and all those prophets of Baal were were slain because that God came down and consumed Elijah's sacrifice after an all-day Affair of going around and around their sacrifice and nothing happening but God came down and let this fire fall and consume the sacrifice and their water and the rocks and everything else but there was a jezebel that came along and said listen here I'm going to take your head off just like you did my Prophets brother random said that Elijah's Eagle Vision got a little clouded over and he went and hid from Jezebel because he was a little bit disturbed that this woman was after after the mighty happenings and I just figure as Elijah sat under that juniper tree stroking the pound spirit God why why [Music] is all of this happening to me let all these good things happen and now I'm running from this woman Jezebel but his ego Vision had been clouded over there are people through life may have happened to us along the way where our Eagle Vision got clouded over the enemy kept at our minds just as he did Samson to try to get you to give up your secret give up your secret and for you to give away the reason of your strength friends it's not by might and it's not by power but it's by my spirit saith the Lord no I have been around for 52 almost 53 years and I have seen a lot of things and I've seen the enemy steal away the spirit of God from people men of God that came out of Pentecostal denominations with the fire of God and they saw a truth that would transform them but rather than allowing the word and the spirit to mesh together they let go of the spirit and embrace the word and they're lifeless and I've seen on the other Spectrum they didn't whip it in a Pentecostal Church they came up to a pinnacle of their experience with speaking in tongues and that's all the further they went they did not go on into the fullness of the word and there they remain and they wonder why their churches are dying why the people are going back to the world because the mountains never melted together the word and the spirit but our God has given us the word and he gave us the spirit he doesn't give one and then decide he's going to change in the middle of the stream and take it away and give you something else my God gives to us everything that we need to make this Rapture and we're being raptured up into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and he wants us to take the word that we have heard and he wants us to get in the spirit with the word that we have heard now sitting here and across that camera there are all kinds of levels of what we have heard and what we have experienced through the years the level of the understanding of God that we might have but God is calling us to take what we have in the understanding of the word and to allow the spirit to get upon it and make it live in our lives so that every time when we come together in the house of the Lord when we get in our secret place and we begin to call on the name of the Lord that word starts working and churning in US and that dimness of our eyes that we feel like that we have allowed our ego Vision to get a little clouded over if we'll allow the word and the spirit to start working together inside of our Lives then there's something that's going to transform us and our vision will become clearer and clearer and clearer now Samson was still down grinding every day around in a circle doing whatever he was doing grinding grinding grinding it was just the Daily Grind literally literally The Daily Grind and you may be sitting here tonight feeling that's the way life is for you I get up in the morning I go to work put in my eight or ten hours I come home supper a few things around the house go to bed get up and do it all over again tomorrow the enemy has lulled you into a Daily Grind and your vision has been clouded over but God has called us to a holy convocation during the Feast of Tabernacles he has called us to a holy convocation a set aside time that we could focus on getting out of the Daily Grind the Bible says that Samson was on this Daily Grind every day how be it his hair began to grow there came a day where Samson said I'm tired of sitting here God I'm sorry I'm sorry I know that I was the one that broke the Covenant [Music] but I feel the hair growing down my back once again and I am remembering your power your spirit coming upon me and I just want to lift my hands to you Lord and say if you can use me again I am yielding myself [Music] and there came a day that the Philistines decided that they were going to have a celebration I just insert here if the pagans can have celebrations why shouldn't the people of God celebrate why shouldn't we why shouldn't we dance and shout and run the aisles and speak in tongues and just have a good time and see the spirit of God come Among Us and just descend down upon us and do what he wants to do and shake some of us so far until that we're saying all that stuff that would have been held in US captive for too long it's we're just shaking loose of it Hallelujah Samson says Lord if you can use me again I'm yielding myself Philistines their holiday for Dagon comes along they're going to have a celebration they're going to make Mary they're going to drink they're going to celebrate they're going to celebrate their God's victory over their enemy Samson the one that has killed so many of our people we're going to celebrate that our God got victory over him and his God and he ain't going to kill our people no more we're going to celebrate don't ever underestimate God don't ever underminate the don't ever underestimate the Living God the creator of Heaven and Earth he's going to come when you least expect him if somebody invites him he's going to come and he's going to do Supernatural among you when it looks like everything is working out just exactly in the natural as it ought to be they're up there they're drinking their party and they're having a good time they're all decked out they're they're getting into the the mode of drunk because they're just they're just so happy that their God day God has overcome Samson and not realizing that uh Samson has already recognized that God is coming back upon him that he is repenting for what is in the past he's leaving it behind just the same as you can tonight if you've got some stuff in your life it doesn't take a big bunch of of span of time you can just say Lord I realize I've messed up I have messed up I came to the the altar on Sunday but I've messed up again now friends we don't want to condone repeat offenses we are looking for total Deliverance complete deliverance but every time that you can find and get yourself into the spirit of the Lord and you can say Lord I messed up again but I'm coming back to you because I don't know what else to do I I can't I I I'm coming in faith I can't fix myself I I mean I can make steps toward avoiding things but I can't fix myself I've got to have the spirit of God in my life in such a measure until that those things lose all of their grip they lose all of their taste they lose all of their wooing power to me I've got to get them out of my life and I just come back to you and that's what I urge every one of us to do every chance we get come back to God get in the spirit if there's an altar call if there's a gathering around the front if there's a Jericho March don't sit it out get right in the middle of it and say God I want you to do in me what can be done tonight I'm I'm getting right in the middle I'm getting in the middle of what you want to do because I don't want to be left on the sidelines while everybody else is getting what they're getting because God is moving this week he's moving he's here to help us he is here to strengthen us he's here to change us he's here to help us to overcome all of our past sins he said friends listen I know that the devil tends to beat us over our past it's what he enjoys doing he wants to beat you over your past but Paul says I leave it behind I'm forgetting those things that are behind and I'm pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus so I urge you to do as Paul did and that is to forget what is behind Samson could have been intimidated he had a lot of past he had a lot of yuck in his past he had a lot of disappointments in his past he had a lot of of times where that he failed God he had a lot of times where he failed his parents there were a lot of things in his past that he was probably ashamed of with his eyes poked out their grinding day after day after day but finally the Philistines gave opportunity they did not know it they did not know it but they wanted to make sport of Samson they said go get Samson go get him out of the grinding house let's give him a little change of pace bring him out here and let's just make a bit of fun of him the old blind thing yeah that blind guy down there you all see that's the one that he killed your cousins he killed your brothers he killed your mothers your fathers he can't look at him now we got him under control our God is one day gone one day gone one not realizing that there'd already been some repentance there'd already been some repentance on Samson's part and the locks of his hair were growing God was moving send him a little boy and he said Lord just one more time just one more time just one more time let me die with these Philistines they've poked my eyes out they've taken my life away from me but just one more time lord just one more time now you may be sitting here tonight you may be watching this service and you may feel defeated you may feel like you failed your last time and there's no hope for you but I want you to know that God has not given up on you God has not turned you away ah listen I'm not God I'm talking to everybody in here because we all do things we Face things and we we give in to the enemy too often but tonight we can say God that thing has tormented me that thing is tormented me and tormented me and I thought I'd never get over it but God I'm feeling your invitation tonight I'm feeling your invitation just one more time lord just one more time I'm coming back to you let me be Avenged of this demon spirit that is coming tormented me so many days and nights of my life that I can't seem to get over it I want you Holy Spirit I want you Holy Spirit to come musicians are coming and I want you to stand to your feet one more time Holy Spirit one more time Holy Spirit I'm calling on you to come and avenge me avenge me avenge me of mine enemy I've let the devil kick me around so many times I've let him intimidate me I've let him keep me from my calling I it has caused me to do things that I never thought I would have done before in my life but here I am and I feel like a

eyes just play that a moment just keep playing that I can't I can't hold back I can't no more I I have to do this now while the anointing of God is here now you know we all hear different things in these stories and there's no way in the world that you could preach at all the thing I love and admire about brother Greeley so much is he loves to give us the background of a story and I want to tell you something I've been studying the word of God a long time I forget these details and when he starts laying that out I know we're going somewhere so I just jump on right early I don't wait till it gets goody goody to jump in and help him I help him from the beginning because I know we're going somewhere I want to tell you two things and then then I want you to get what you need before we leave I want to tell you two things there is nothing in the Bible to tell us that Samson was a muscle-bound man you may see Schwarzenegger or you may see The Rock but I want you to know the children's made-up storybook that that portrays him as some Tony Atlas the Jews will tell you those who study the Hebrew scripture there was nothing about Samson that distinguished him in his physical appearance from anybody else except the long hair which was a Nazarite vowel in fact they say that he was rather ordered [Music] now I want to tell you something if you told me that I've got to transform myself into into the Rock foreign or a lifetime you are way I I don't I don't think I can I don't think I'll ever be that but I can be ordinary I can be what God made me then the strength was not his muscles it was the spirit of God that fell on him we are in it we're in a room tonight with ordinary people I don't want to offend you I just want you to know you are rather ordinary but you're not right you are but you're not because there's something that makes you different than those out there who are struggling and battling the way they battle the anointing is on your life the call of God is on your life and he's going to chase you because you're his you're never going to get away from God you're never going to be happy without him you're never going to be happy not doing what God has called you to do so you might as well surrender to him tonight don't wait till tomorrow night you might as well surrender to him tonight we're all ordinary but when that spirit of God falls on us we're Sons then not muscle bound just it was the strength of the and the second thing was this is always fascinated me and I wasn't going to say it I said it I talked it out loud you know me I talk when people are preaching but it's to help not to distract but I had a preacher who's streaming this service many states away who who made the comment sent me a text and confirmed what I was already stirred about it's this little verse right here verse 26 and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand all those months of being lonely of feeling like he was the only one the once champion of Israel now forgotten nobody's singing Samson's song anymore did you know they sung about him nobody was singing about Samson anymore eyes plucked out doing some menial little task some little insignificant task so lonely probably had only the little mice or some little creatures or something to give him any kind of companionship nobody to talk to nobody to tell your stories to nobody to to to share with you or to encourage you but God sent him help I want to tell you something I'm telling you in the name of the Lord God is sending you help tonight he's sending you help tonight he sent him a little lad he sent him a little boy just a young child who he could call on and he said suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I may lean on them so this little boy that God sent the little lad that God sent to him took his arms and his hands and helped him find his position he had to find his place he lost his place he's blind he can't see it he can't even feel it but as soon as that little boy came and helped him and he put his hands around oh that familiar feeling that he'd been contemplating now for a few weeks as his hair was growing out I have to tell you tonight that God is sending somebody what about all of us why don't we just say every one of us your help is here God is sending you help so that you can get back to where you ought to be you hear what I'm saying I tell you that that cry out sister Terry cried out in the spirit and it went through me from the top of my head all the way down to my feet and I knew that also was a confirmation for me to tell you your help's here your help is here God has sent you hell now don't you refuse it and don't you reject it but but stick your feet under the table say Lord here I am I'm not satisfied doing nothing I'm not satisfied just getting by I need that anointing to follow my life I recognize that you are sending me help I want to get out from under this blindness I want to get out from this loneliness I want to get out from under this place of not belonging and not feeling like I have a part or a position in the body I've got to have a part of something you cry out to him because he's here he's here your freedom is here I want I want to give you that chance right now to do it right now as he sings again I want you to say I don't have to spend another day isolated and cut off from the body of Christ I don't have to spend another moment in a prison House of my own making of my own mind I don't have to be spiritually blind anymore you can anoint my eyes with I Salve to see who I am and who I'm supposed to be and who I was born to be Lord I Want My Destiny to be confirmed in my mind in my heart in my life let's do that right now [Music] it's already done oh it's already done [Music] healing
