[0:00] we possess we carry what we need to
[0:05] overcome it therefore anything that's in
[0:09] it any enemy that lives in your promise
[0:13] any enemy that lives in the land of your
[0:17] inheritance if God said I'm giving you
[0:20] that land he's also going to give you
[0:22] the power to overcome whatever stands
[0:26] between you and possessing your
[0:29] inheritance
[0:30] he'll not tell you to do something and
[0:33] not give you the authority and power to
[0:35] accomplish it and so it eliminates our
[0:41] excuses when we like to think we're the
[0:43] only one facing the kind of battle that
[0:46] we're facing we find out there's no
[0:49] temptation but such is common demand you
[0:51] can't expect the possession or The
[0:54] Inheritance without a battle we we're
[0:57] not here in the last days going to a
[0:59] picnic we're in a battle we're not on a
[1:01] playground we're on a battlefield and
[1:04] anything worth having is worth fighting
[1:06] to get come on all you've got to do is
[1:10] just read the book of promise we are to
[1:13] be a people of the book and that means
[1:16] that what's promised to us is supposed
[1:19] to be what we have in front of us as our
[1:21] vision as our goal if God said I'm going
[1:24] to give you overcoming power you're
[1:26] going to defeat every devil in your life
[1:29] you're going to over come every habit
[1:31] every addiction every situation if God
[1:33] said that it's because he knows that
[1:36] he's given us not he's going to give us
[1:40] he's given us what we
[1:42] need not only take it but to overcome it
[1:47] to get on top of it to get to the other
[1:49] side overcome is not just getting higher
[1:52] than your problem overcoming is to get
[1:54] clear over to the other side of your
[1:56] problem so that you've got the authority
[1:59] then to deal with the problem sometimes
[2:01] you can't speak to a mountain from this
[2:04] side sometime you got to get over to the
[2:06] other side before you can talk to it
[2:09] because there's a promise sometimes that
[2:12] goes with a territory and our territory
[2:15] is not on this side of Jordan our
[2:18] promised inheritance is on the other
[2:19] side we have to poke our heads up above
[2:23] what we see with our five
[2:25] senses and we have to take the promise
[2:29] instead of the condition that we see
[2:32] remember we're not
[2:34] thermometers we're
[2:35] thermostats amen so if you are
[2:38] attracting problems in situation it's
[2:41] probably because you're destined to
[2:43] overcome that kind of
[2:45] thing so get ready because there are
[2:48] seeds of Destiny this isn't you know the
[2:51] power of positive thinking I'm talking
[2:52] about I'm talking about a seed of
[2:54] destiny that was swn into your life
[2:57] before you got here because the Bible
[3:00] said before we ever came he knew us
