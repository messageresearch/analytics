[0:00] and although you and I are not fighting
[0:01] a physical battle like that we're really
[0:03] fighting a spiritual battle like that
[0:05] for our own for our own Victory to stay
[0:09] in this thing just to stay on top of the
[0:12] heartache to stay on top of the past to
[0:15] move past the past so that we can see
[0:18] what God will do for us now and I don't
[0:21] care how dark it was I don't care how
[0:23] black it was how hideous it was you were
[0:26] not alone you may have felt alone I may
[0:30] have felt alone but way before the
[0:32] foundation of the world God knew you and
[0:35] he saw your choice and he was determined
[0:39] come on you might be knocked down for
[0:41] your own poor choices at times and you
[0:45] might suffer for things that you're not
[0:46] guilty of at times but he determined
[0:49] them to stay close enough to you and
[0:52] protect you and keep you so that in the
[0:56] right hour in the very right moment of
[0:58] time in God 's appointed and alloted
[1:01] time you would come to him and this time
[1:04] you wouldn't hold part of your heart
[1:06] back you wouldn't hold part of your hurt
[1:08] back but you would come and lay all of
[1:11] it The Good the Bad and the Ugly I lay
[1:15] it on the Altar and I say God if you can
[1:18] get Glory out of this mess I'm not just
[1:22] inviting you I'm imploring you to come
[1:25] and get Glory out of the mess of my life
[1:29] hasn't he began that work for most of us
[1:33] don't we have something to praise him
[1:35] for are we what we ought to be probably
[1:38] not are we what we'd like to be probably
[1:41] not but thank God we're not what we used
[1:43] to be because we've allowed the Holy
[1:47] Spirit to help move
[1:49] us past our past it didn't come to
[1:54] stay it came to pass in The Darkest
[1:58] Hour in in the most awful pain of your
[2:03] life God's hand was still close enough
[2:06] to you you may have thought you were
[2:08] going under for the last time you may
[2:11] not have recognized the Finger of God
[2:13] pulling you up letting you catch your
[2:16] breath even resuscitating you when you
[2:18] needed it you might not have recognized
[2:21] his grace you might not have recognized
[2:24] his Mercy but I tell you based on the
[2:26] word of God it was there you may not be
[2:29] far enough past it to be able to
[2:30] recognize it I find out we have to get
[2:33] so far past our past before we can
[2:35] really begin to realize you mean that
[2:37] was for my good you had to look like it
[2:40] was for my
[2:41] destruction but we have a Joseph
[2:44] anointing we have a Joseph manle and
[2:46] mandate and what the enemy meant for
[2:48] evil how many of you have ever sung it
[2:51] on a Sunday morning here what the enemy
[2:53] meant for evil but enough of us are
[2:56] moving past our past I want to I like
[2:58] that I'm going to keep saying that
[3:00] enough of us are moving past our past
[3:03] that we're able to create an atmosphere
[3:05] and that's all God's looking for he said
[3:07] I want a house to live
[3:16] in
