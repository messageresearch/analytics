why don't we give him a hand clap for praise thank him that he saw something I I'd like to I'd like to tell you what he saw he saw that representation of himself that seed that he had placed in The Believer that's what he was bringing back to himself you may be seated this morning it was God Gathering himself together through the mighty Plan of Redemption and I'm so thankful for that that's the part of our Redemption that we have very little to do with you didn't choose him he chose you and he saw your choice thank God he didn't take away your free will but he saw that you were going to choose him and so he just said I choose first that's what that's what for knowledge is all about we're thankful okay somebody's got some music playing can we fix that got it okay thank you I I kept hearing it and it's good music I think but uh we don't need it right now do we uh we want to thank you for uh all your prayers for all of those who have really had a tough time well first let me say to brother Josh uh Alano you might have had a rough start but the anointing makes the difference when the anointing came and I'm I'm telling it this way because he hadn't planned to sing We don't enjoy asking people to sing this is not a concert we don't run our services like other groups where everybody has a song We like for people to to have uh something laid on their heart and we like for them to let us know they've got a song and if we feel like we even like to know what it is does that sound terrible we like to know what the song is because we'd like to see if it kind of goes along with the service theme that we're trying to build but on occasion when no one turns one in and we feel like we might need a song uh then we will send and Joshua said well I'll go ask Josh he's always willing and you know when you don't sing that often and there's so many different songs running through your mind the musicians sometime may find a hard find it hard to just pull that tune up just because Josh says my song well I don't know but sometimes that's not always easy to remember but I love the fact fact that he was willing and I love the fact he was giving it his all but when the Holy Spirit Come when the anointing of the Lord comes it it supersedes all the effort and the skill and and and it overrides the music and if someone's off or hits a wrong note on the base or some other instrument the anointing just destroys the Yoke some people may have a good voice as far as singing goes but if there's no anointing on it then it doesn't get in anything done how many of you love the sweet anointing of the Holy Spirit we've we've certainly experienced him today uh this has been a hard two weeks for a lot of folks and uh I have to be pretty still or I go back into a coughing fit uh I think the pneumonia is clearing up but the bronchitis is still there but um the doctor said give it a 10 another 10 days but I I just know it could it can lift in the morning it can lift right now and I am much better brother gy is ministering the word of the Lord to us this morning I so appreciate him doing that um I can't right now I can't get my brain wrapped around the idea that we have to travel this week at toward the end of the week but some of us are going to Pennsylvania for a wedding I'm not a wedding person I I don't I don't it doesn't make me feel clouded uh or or uh prestigious when someone invites me to come to a wedding I I'm just that's just not really my cup of tea but uh Amy Crossman uh brother G's nephew niece is getting married and uh she's a very special girl to a lot of us and uh their their love story was quick and it was pretty special and so she wanted us to be there so pray that the Lord will give us a touch between now and getting on an airplane I understand that's one of the sickest environments you can be in so I want to be well and I know these others that are going to be going you're going to be left in very good hands we're going to leave you in the hands of the Holy Spirit and he's going to come next Sunday and minister to your need and to your life through brother Hawke so we want to ask you to pray for him this week uh we know this is the mind of God we know this is God's Will and we know that God's going to use him to talk to you but he needs a little extra prayer he's uh I don't know if you can get rusty or not but but if you're out of the swing of things sometimes it's getting back in the in the saddle let's pray that God will inspire him and give him boldness and uh he's walking through an unusual time in his life where where you know when when God's all we have that's all we need and we and we run to him and I know personally that he's been seeking the Lord in a in a in a desperate way and you know when we do that we're lining ourselves up and getting ready to hear from God so I believe it's going to be a very special uh uh time tomorrow January the 8th is the uh anniversary of the of the pillar of fire that came into the Tabernacle that morning and Drew on the wall the faces of the church age moons and uh if you've never heard that tape you would be blessed to hear it when the presence of the Lord comes and people begin to see the light one of the most fascinating things about that tape is when brother brandom says that's not it there some of you are not looking it's here and I find that kind of kind of uh unusual because sometimes we can get distracted and think that we're looking at the right thing and we're only looking at the image of the right thing and we have to come back to the word which is our absolute when we approach this message that's how we need to approach it it it is it is certainly a reflection of the word but there is an original word there is an absolute it's God's Bible it's God's holy script scripture and I'm thankful to have it I love him and I love his word don't you and so we wanted to just to mention that also you have been praying with us about Israel you know that our lease was to end in February just this week we have heard it was a long hard process to be able to hear back from the new owner but just this week I had an email finally after after sending my email multiple times we finally got an answer back they have agreed to extend our lease for one more year I can't tell you the relief that that brings to us uh the the lease price is going up it will it will be between $600 and $800 more a month which is hard for me to imagine but it is uh it's the price of being desperate and needing the place the the family that owns it are are very uh happy at this point I think that that that we're going to do that their original intention was to buy it and move in immediately and uh you know War can shift things around a little bit and so I am looking to be able to spend some time this year in Israel sorting through the stuff and getting ready for the new chapter whatever God has for us there so I wanted to thank you for praying and I wanted to thank you for your continued giving because we are we're certainly still in our old lease and then in February we begin a new lease and your giving makes that possible it's rare that we have to to pull something from somewhere else to make that happen uh if it is it's usually no more than $400 or500 because many of you have not missed a beat in all of the other projects you've not missed a beat remembering Israel every month you know God sees that he we we need our prayer we need to continue to pray for the hostages and to pray for for those who are risking their lives every day for Freedom it's not nearly over but God is going to establish something I believe it I believe that what he's doing right now is cleansing a path and making a way for a move of the spirit in the land of Israel and unfortunately it takes some Sometimes some physical uh shakings and some even death and and hardship to get us to a place where we're ready for God and God only the only answer for Israel is the same answer for every nation of the world and that is to surrender to the Lord if we trust in religion religion will fail us but if we trust in the god of the Bible we'll be all right are you with me and I want to mention One Last Thing Before brother gy comes to minister today and that is you have continued to give also in your building fund and sometimes it's Mark building fund and sometimes it's Mark Campground but since we were able to pay off the church you have given an additional $4,600 into the into the building fund well we're already beginning going to begin to tap into that very shortly and we're not pres not uh able this morning to present to you the whole program or the whole plan uh but God's got something good and we're going to have a place to Fellowship sooner rather than later isn't that good news and uh we feel like really we feel like that uh something prophetic is taking place because we brother gy can he might share it I don't know if he planned to share it or not but anyway uh they set a power pole yesterday down by the Tabernacle and you know what that's progress that means that after many years electricity is going to be hooked up to that building down there and we anticipate that it will soon be usable for the further purposes of God you can imagine the cost and uh we might would have shuddered at that at one point but we have seen the supernatural of God we know what he can do and so they're already working they're already doing some things there's planning going on and there's some engineering that had to take place for the power company to come and bring power and there's requirements for us to do and and uh the expenses start coming so let me encourage you to keep giving because we're in a financial position now that everything you give for the building fund or for the campground we can put that right in a separate account because we don't have that $4,100 church payment hanging on us every month isn't he good so I hope we can put that much or [Applause] more and we'll share more when we know more but it's it's kind of a it's kind of a day-by-day thing well now the plans have changed twice or three times when I say plans not plans ideas really wasn't it but they've changed two or three times already just as you start making baby steps then something else comes up and you say well we might as well do it this way we might as well think about this way so we're not trying to keep anything from you we know you're going to be excited we know that it's going to be a wonderful Next Step but we want to know what we're talking about when we talk so somebody doesn't come but you said we want to know what we're saying don't you think that's important let's stand I'm ready to hear what God has for us today uh I'll be uh Lord willing I'll try to minister here Tuesday night and next Tuesday night and as we said brother haulk will be ministering in the morning um let me just see this they're just the the the Aspen Wall family has just mentioned to me again that their little granddaughter is really ill and they're just asking us to pray again that she would be able to drink and eat a little something and doesn't get dehydrated from all the vomiting and the other other uh side effects of the flu and I know that God these are precious friends of ours and I know that God's going to hear their prayer and we're going to believe God with them so let's keep doing that father we thank you today that your word is y and amen we thank you for the unction of the holy spirit that we've already felt in this house and we know you're coming now to deliver a word to us that we're needy of we may not even know what we need but we thank you that the word discerns our needs even when we can't identify them for ourselves so Lord again we ask for special Grace on that funeral service today that you would comfort those hearts that you would surround them with your love and that you would use this hardship and heartache as an opportunity to draw each and every one of them closer to your side we lift up this precious little granddaughter of the Aspen walls that you would touch her from the top of her little head to the souls of her little feet and you would give her miraculous healing in the name of Jesus that her little body would just fight with everything it has and that your anointing and healing virtue would do the rest Lord move over this house right now and touch every person who needs strength and healing we're not just uh upset about symptoms Lord we want you to go to the root of the condition and bring healing in the mighty name of Jesus and for those who need travel mercies this week go with them keep us each one bring us back a safely into your house father come and anoint our brother today with a cold from on high let us set everything else aside right now and focus on your voice to us and may we have a heart to hear and may we have a will to obey it's not hearing only but it's doing your word that activates the supernatural so may we hear and may we find Grace to do it and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ we pray amen and the church said amen let's sing I love him as brother gley prepares to come and minister to us I love him I love him I love him because he first love me [Music] and P my salvation H bre Tre I want you to make it personal I love you I love you I love you because you first love me [Music] and will you sing it one more [Music] time love you I love him because he first loved me and he p just my salvation on [Music] calary oh I'm glad that he loved me yes sir and he's the one that gave me the power even to love him amen amen we're going to look to the word again today in Hebrews chapter 1 while you're finding the scripture can you pull these lights down I'd like to show a few pictures uh of of just to show you uh the difference that you're giving made some weeks ago we took an offering for some windows and doors in a church building in India and uh there's some before and after pictures there that's the building without the doors and the windows and um God has blessed them and there you can see the doors and the windows in the building and that is because that you gave to the Lord and so we take part in What the Lord is doing in that place and we give the Lord Glory because he is the one who blessed us to be able to [Music] give this brother does much evangelizing uh he pastors a church and he has many men that work with him I would say that he has uh an Apostolic calling on him he goes to so many places um one other thing before we look to the scripture thank you musicians I'm so thankful that the Lord has blessed us with you and your [Applause] gift brother Shelly was talking about things moving along this uh on here on the campground and I I'm not going to say a lot about it just yet because we're still trying to do some uh get some ideas but would you pray for the favor of the Lord this week that uh specifically this week we need the favor of the Lord and I would appreciate your prayers concerning that Hebrews chapter 1 and we'll start with verse 10 just like we did on Tuesday night and thou Lord in the beginning Hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as do a garment and as a vesture shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy year shall not fail but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be Heirs of Salvation on to chapter 2 verse one therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation yes which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will For unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou mest him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man yes sir for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering amen let us pray one more time before we uh have our seats father we just want to say thank you that we could be in your presence today thank you Lord that you surround us with your presence and we thank you that you are moving Among Us Lord and you are doing in our lives what we cannot do for ourselves as we surrender to you I thank you Lord that you are still healer and that you are bringing healing to our bodies I thank you that you're still deliverer and you're bringing Deliverance to us Lord as we have need Lord It's seems sometimes we're so far from the mark but I thank you for Grace unmar favor that has been given to us Lord now we ask you that you will have your way May the angels be in their position as we are in ours get honor and glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen praise the Lord you may have your seats today 1950 it shall be even as it was told me brother brandham says see God always had had ministering Spirits I believe in them I believe in ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God the Holy Spirit ministers led the church Guardian guardian angels that watch over us their Angels always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven is that right and then another one which I gave you one line out of and uh what think ye of Christ paragraph 38 I see another Angel he's talking about the uh the young man in the fiery furnace he says I see another Angel come up in his name's wormwood he destroyed the anti delvian world with Waters he has control of them he's going to do something in the last days with them turn them all bitter so I can hear him right quick run up and fall down before his majesty and say oh Master have you looked down there angels are concerned about what we believe about Christ Angels let me repeat that line angels are concerned about what we believe about Christ have you considered down there and he goes on to talk about that uh if he the Lord would just give him command he would go and that he would wash Babylon off of the map on the earth because uh to save those three Hebrew boys but now God knows what he's doing and he knows how much of a fiery furnace that he wants to take us through before that the angels are sent with their commission to deliver us so uh on on Tuesday night we talked about a prophetic word that had come here in October uh of 2023 and how that the Lord talked to us about an increase of the Angelic activity that would be around us and he started talking to us about the things that we might see flashes of light or we might see their outline and how that they would come to us and they would be assistance to us and uh so we uh keep that in our mind and think about the things that the Lord desires to do for us and in Us and how that he would use the angels in that work the ministering spirit that have been given to us in the end time are not just for us to say oh we got a lot of angels around us we have a necessity to cooperate with them um I think that many times because we don't see them uh we don't take time to remember that they're even there and when we don't see them and we don't feel them uh and we don't perceive that they're around us we just go on with our life H because we're so tied to what we can see what we can hear what we can taste what we can feel what we can smell that's the way we connect to this environment that is around us but there's a whole another unseen realm that God has given into our hands that he wants us to cooperate with he wants us to understand what they do what their job is how they minister to us and there are times that he opens our eyes and lets us see that's right and we know that through all of the ages God has worked with angels and he sent them to people and it's one of those things where that you hear stories about it but if if you've never encountered one in a way that you thought was tangible you forgive about them but we don't want to forget about this Angelic activity because God made us a promise that he was going to increase that Angelic activity and so we desire to look into this to find ways uh to find how that Angels operate how what they do on our behalf uh we always keep in mind that we do not worship angels we are not going to worship them we worship only the Lord Jesus Christ the one who died for our sins the one who paid the price that we could have eternal life thank you Jesus yet through the scripture Old and New Testament God sent angels I begin to think about some of these instances where that God sent angels and I begin to wonder did every one of these where it says that an angel came to them did they actually see the angel because in some instances it says it was as the appearance of an Angel whereas there were other times that it just said an angel came to them did they actually see light did they see an outline of a man some of them actually saw men all right so I I want to go quickly through these again uh I'm uh I'm asking you we're going to we're going to flash him up on the screen today and uh don't critique my notes this is uh this is not my strong point uh God called me to be a preacher and a preacher is one who delivers good news and this is good news that God would let let his angels be a part of our life that we could actually partake of what they have to offer and that their assistance would help us in this journey all right so the first place we're the first one we're going to talk about is the uh I'm going to be repeating so uh just bear with us service to those who have inheritance Hebrews 1:14 which we've already read are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation is anybody in here an air of Salvation join hirs with Jesus Christ I I love the scripture in Ephesians that talks about our inheritance that has been given to us as Believers and so as a as one who inherits salvation these angels are sent for me so that is the first thing that you can identify that Angels if if you are an heir of Salvation then the ministering Spirits are sent forth for you amen all right the next thing we're going to look at is they reveal unknown truths in Daniel 10: 14 to 21 the angel came to Daniel to show him what was coming to his people in the latter days and we also find in chapter 8 and chapter nine of Daniel where that this angel came to him specifically in 89 Gabriel came to him and was telling him about some things that were going to happen to his people the Jewish people in time to come he told Daniel you seal it up you can't talk about it but there's going to come something in the latter time and the angel is the one that came to death Daniel Daniel was one he he I I I suspect that Daniel had somewhat of an inquisitive mind he didn't just lolly gag along in his life and say everything's going to be all right in the end but he had an inquisitive mind and he wanted to know some things and so in his desire to know some things the angel of the Lord he talked to the Lord about it and the angel of the Lord came to him and revealed uh these things to him we find in Ezekiel chapter 40 uh Ezekiel describes a man whose appearance was like brass now you don't look like brass unless you've been got out and got a suntan I guess but you don't look like but that's the way Ezekiel described this man this angel that came to him and began to talk to him concerning the millennial Temple and then in the Book of Revelation John saw the angels to the churches he saw the Angels around the throne he saw angels with trumpets and vials John got to see all of this Angels everywhere but Revelation 1 verse one says this the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John so all that John saw was because an angel came and showed it to him and if you look at this in The New American Standard instead of signified it by his Angel it means it was communicated by the angel to John because God used the angel to get it across to to John that there's some things that I want you to be able to write down now remember Revelation is uh we're told that the Revelation is a book of symbols right that's right so when John was given all of this Revelation and he got to see all of this stuff and he wrote it down in the in the form that we have in the Book of Revelation John didn't understand all of it neither do we understand all of it because so much of it is in symbol form that's right yet God in his grace comes in the end time and he continues to reveal himself to us all right so then we go on to personal guidance Matthew 1: 20 and 21 the angel came to Joseph in a dream now this was not Joseph out working his carpenter shop and all of the sudden an angel in the form of a Man shows up to him this is a angel shows up in Joseph's dream giving him guidance about what to do about this uh his fiance Mary who is pregnant he didn't know what to do he was going to put her away privately but the angel came in a dream and said you take Mary to be your wife what's conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so that was personal guidance again in chapter 2 in a dream to Joseph once again letting him know that it was safe to go back to Israel from the land of Egypt they had escaped to Egypt because of what Herod wanted to do to the young child Jesus then in Luke 2: 8-12 the Angels Came to the Shepherds concerning the birth of Yeshua now this is one of those that I'm not saying yay I'm not saying nay I don't really know but I want you to think about the this that it doesn't say that they saw them it doesn't say that they encountered them it says they the Angels Came to them but yet did they actually see them I don't know and I'm only saying I'm only emphasizing that point because I believe that there are angels that come to assist us that we don't see them we don't feel them we don't perceive them per se in in a form of a of a light but yet they come to us and we know that something has shifted and as the Angels Came to these Shepherds something something happened yes that caus them they must have heard a voice somehow that caus them to get up and move then we talked about uh the angels as a personal guide and we talked about lot Genesis chap 19: 15-1 17 the angel actually got a hold of lot and said let's go we can't wait around something is about to happen to this city and you can't stay here and he grabbed him and moved him so not just as personal guidance but now as his personal guide with his hand on him saying let's move sometimes there's that expedience that we've got to move and we we though we may not see an angel again but we feel something pressing us something moving us and we must move when the spirit of the Lord says move and we just want to be in in a place where that we can uh recognize that God is doing something on our behalf and that when he wants us to move we better move how can I see an angel how can I feel an angel how can I know that angels are around the simplest answer that I could give to us would be stay in the spirit yes yeah that's a good one we get so caught up in Natural Life natural happenings natural watching the news and being caught up in the news can cause us to be so focused on what is happening in the world around us the the natural world around us that we forget about that spirit world that is all around us that is here to assist us when all of the world is blowing up and the world is blowing up wars and rumors of wars everywhere wars and rumors of wars and about the time that you think something is over with it escalates again it's it's a crazy thing that we're watching that's true yet the Angels From Another realm Are Watching Over The Heirs of eternal life they're watching over the Airs of eternal life to make sure that you make it all the way through that's right you don't have to worry little bride that you're going to fall and fail along the way there is already the the the end is already determined for you and for me and God has given this Angelic activity to help help us along the way and we don't have to settle for what the world settles for we can take a hold of the promises of God every promise in him is yes and amen right then we look at Angelic protection Daniel 6:22 Daniel told the king that an angel had come to shut the mouths of the Lions oh what protection God gave to him I like now as we go along there's probably going to be there will probably be scripture this is not an exhaustive research that I'm giving you there'll probably be scriptures that come to you uh concerning how that God helped his people along the way and I tried to only use those where it specifically talked about an angel or the angel of the Lord so we have Daniel of course the angel shut the the mouths of the Lions and then we go to the scripture in Psalm 91: 11 and 12 for he shall give his CH Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone now this is a scripture that the devil used in the Temptation Of The Lord Jesus Christ tried to get him to do something out of timing tried to get him to uh let pride get in the way and this was what the enemy used but this is also scripture that we as the people of God are able to take that there are angels that have charge over us to help to keep us in the way I just want to tell you if angels could be in charge to keep balum in the way then as a Believer I believe God can give angels to keep me in the way deliverance from our enemies Acts 5: 19 the apostles were imprison for preaching but they were released by angels and then again in Acts chapter 12 specifically Peter was released from prison by the angels and as we said on Tuesday night he didn't believe it he he was he was in a state of discouragement I don't know but he didn't believe that he could be released the angel had to help him out a little bitl and the people over there praying for his release when Roa came to the door she wasn't so sure about it neither but the angel delivered Peter out of the prison God yes encouraging and strengthening Genesis chap 32 we see that Jacob uh had just dealt with leaving laan his father-in-law and he was about to meet Esau his estranged brother and the angels came to him to strengthen him to help him in this uh very pivotal time in his life the Angels ascending and descending they were they were there to help him uh in his time of difficulty when he was scared I hope none of you have a father-in-law that wants to take everything that you've ever worked for and then chase you down when you decide to leave I hope you've never had an estrangement from your brother or sister like Jacob had you might say well Jacob brought that on himself but there was already a predetermined outcome to those two young men God had a hand in it that's true but it did not keep Jacob from being afraid that's of the unknown that's where Jacob was he was afraid of the unknown and we get in that place a whole lot of time we're afraid of the unknown it keeps us from moving out and doing what God want wants us to do because we're afraid of what might we might encounter what kind of uh Darkness we may encounter and as we said on Tuesday night when we are talking about the spirit realm we're going to encounter darkness and we're going to encounter light we really don't want the darkness but friends darkness is encroaching on us every day we may not attribute it in our in our Humanity we may not attribute it to demon spirits but demon Spirits are at work in the world and they're pressing in on us yes and we discount that it is Spirits in we just say oh it's a part of life but really demon Spirits are pressing in on us from every side to try to make us trip to Fair fa to trespass against the Lord in some way he cannot take away my salvation but he's still out to trip me up is demon Spirits behind it we call them demon spirits but they're really Dark Angels trying to destroy the enemy comes to steal to kill and destroy he wants to steal your Victory he wants to steal your joy of your salvation he wants to steal the progress that you've made in the Lord Jesus Christ he wants to kill your influence he wants to kill any words that you speak that have life to them he wants to destroy you he wants to destroy your children he wants to destroy your influence he wants to destroy your testimony steal kill and destroy that's what he wants to do but Jesus said I have come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly and he gave an Angelic host on the lights side to help to assist us in fighting the Angelic forces of the dark side the demon spirits that are trying to steal and kill and destroy amen constantly that's it we're they're pressing in on us that's right and we need to take the authority that we have as HS of Salvation and tell demon spirits to back up yes back up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and invite the Angelic host from the Throne of God that has been already uh predetermined to help me in this instance in my life so Jacob was in that place where he just didn't know what to do about tomorrow right what is Esau going to think of me what is is he coming with sword is he coming with an army is he going to cut my head off and leave my children fatherless and my wives widows is that what is going to happen it's all that fear of the unknown I don't know what tomorrow holds but if I'll hold to the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ I know that I'll be all right and that he'll take me all the way through it's brother Cade sang here last Sunday morning something keeps holding me Hallelujah encouraging and strengthening Acts chapter 27 Paul was told by an Angel that shipwreck was going to happen but there would be no loss of life judges chap 6 verse 12 to Gideon he tells him that he was a mighty man of Valor Hallelujah we find ourselves in Gideon's position oh yes many days of our life we find ourself in Gideon's condition many days when we're ready to step into the pulpit when we're ready to step in to preach or to sing or to sing a special or to do anything that God has called us to do the enemy wants to push us back in a corner and make us hide yet God has a different word for us and he calls us Mighty Men of Valor Mighty women of Valor somebody who has already been put had a garment placed upon them the Robes of his righteousness that we can wear by grace and we don't have to hide from the enemy we don't have to hide from the dark Spirits we don't have to hide behind the wine press in the threshing floor or anywhere else we can get up and be about the father's business because there's an Angelic host come to us and already pronounced to us Mighty Men of Valor get about doing the Lord's work then again strengthening Luke chapter 22 verse 43 to Jesus in Gethsemane an angel appeared unto him from Heaven strengthening him if you think about where Jesus was the proximity of time that was left before he would be taken to the Cross he knew it was coming he tried telling the disciples that it was coming and they really didn't want to hear it they wanted him to stick around and live his life with them and be their Po and just walk beside of them and he said if I don't go away I can't send the comforter and he explained to them I've got to go and I I must do this he had to do it for my salvation for your salvation for your healing and my healing for my peace of mind and your peace of mind for your broken spirit and my broken Spirit he had to go all the way to Calvary but there he was in Gethsemane and he's he's praying and it says he was sweating as it were drops of blood and the angels came to him angel came and strengthened him to help him to get all the way through to the Cross if he' had stopped at Gethsemane that would not have been enough if he had got as far as being questioned in pilate's judgment Hall would not have been enough he had to go all the way to Calvary and not just to Calvary that wasn't enough either he had to be placed in a tomb and he had to go to hell and he had to take the keys of death and hell and the grave and he had to come up out of the Tomb resurrected first fruits to know that when we lay someone in the grave that is not the end of it there is a resurrection friends and Jesus had to have an angel come and strengthen him to get him all the way through that's true then we go to the provision of food First Kings chapter 19 Elijah after his great victory over the prophets of Baal and he hears that Jezebel is after him he runs and hides here again now with Gideon the angel came and told him you're mighty man of Valor when Elijah ran and hid Angel didn't come and say you're a mighty man of Valor he came and he fed him and then he came and fed him again and then gave him further instruction and told him that he needed to go and anoint this one to be king and this one to be king and this one to be prophet in his dead his his his part was over with he was he he was coming down to the end of his time yes sir and it was going to be a change of season with Kings and with prophets there was a change of season about to happen but Elijah was in this place where he had run and he hid because he had been through such a battle but God was faithful to Elijah and brought him food when he needed food the Lord knew that Elijah needed physical strength from food prise the Lord he' been running a long time God provided food and we can take this same provision by the angels to Elijah and we can take it for ourselves to know that when things get tough around us that God still provides for his own he will provide what is needed at the time that we are in need Hallelujah God knows how to bring food by Angels so let's just look for a few minutes at some of the Angels characteristics I told you they have intellect Matthew chapter 28 the angel answered and said fear not I know that you seek Jesus who is crucified he is not here he is risen as he said come come see the place where Jesus led so we see that they knew things that they could convey to someone else angels are not idiots they don't come to you with useless information they come from the presence of the Lord to bring to us things that we need to know at a certain time to help us make it through then we can see in First Peter 1:2 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into now we told you on Tuesday night the angels are looking in at us because they want to know what's going on with us yes the angels are interested in you they are they want to know about your well-being they want to know especially about your spiritual well-being and they really want to know what you know right and so they have intellect they have emotions the scriptures job 38:7 Luke 213 Luke 15:10 onto they have a will I'm going to move just a little bit quicker Jude chapter 6 The Angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in Everlasting chains unto Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day angels are Spirit beings they're not limited to material bodies they're ministering Spirits again sometimes they show up as a human being what looks like a human being be careful not to entertain Angels unawares so they are Spirit beings sometimes they appear as we read a while ago concerning Joseph they appear sometimes they are with human function as in a dream they come to us in dreams dreams uh which is a human function for us God gave us dreams uh there are many times perhaps that we have dreams that disturb us we really need to sanctify our minds ask the Lord to sanctify our dreams so that when we are dreaming it allows if the Lord so desires to send an angel in our dream that we are able to receive that uh and and that we're not so caught up in the world so caught up in uh all the Temptations of life that we have dreams that are unsanctified sometimes they're seen by some and not others Genesis Chapter 18 The Three Angels one stayed with Abraham two went to Sodom some folks saw them some were blinded and then we gave the more specific one in 2 Kings 6:1 15-17 where that Elisha and his servant uh were together and all the that the servant could see was that they were surrounded by the enemy oh yeah that's the way the enemy wants it to be he wants you to think you're constantly surrounded by enemy forces yet God wants you to know that you are surrounded by a host of angels an increase in Angelic activity he come he came to remind us and I'm here again today to remind you that there's an increase in the Angelic activity and we want to be able to see them to know that they're that there are more of them than there are of demonic forces more of them than of demonic forces I just remind you that when Lucifer was cast out he only took onethird that meant 2/3 were still on the light side and so so if you can't see them if your eyes are not open to them and you feel like that you are being pressed upon by more demonic forces than good forces may you be reminded that he only has one third as many as God has and God has two3 all right we don't always get to see them sometimes our eyes are opened as the Elisha asked the Lord to Open the Eyes of the servant so that he could see the Heavenly Host Mark 12:25 this one We Gather from it that they don't reproduce for when they shall rise from the dead talking about humans they shall neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the Angels which are in heaven Luke 20:36 they don't die again talking about humans neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the children children of Resurrection from these verses we see that they don't reproduce and that they don't die the ninth one they have a physical reality as when I told you that the Angels laid their hands on lot and his family with an urgency to get out of Sodom they engage in combat second Kings chapter 19:35 it came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smokee in the camp of the Assyrian and4 score and 5,000 and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses God shall fight for you he shall fight for you does that mean you're going to be lazy I hope not we've got to be active alert active alert active alert this is is not a time for us to be where that we uh uh are are finding ourselves in a place of sleep we have to be alert and we have to be active about the things of God and allow the Holy Spirit to work in us and such a way that we are cooperating with the Angelic host I've already alluded to this one Hebrews 13:2 they can be mistaken as people and entertained unawares be not forgetful to entertain strangers thereby some have entertained angels unawares they have more knowledge than man but less than God and I give a scripture Matthew 24 31-36 and also Luke 13-16 the Angels knew things that human beings did not know they came to reveal that to them but that did not make them higher than uh Papa God they have more power than man but less than God and again I gave you Acts chapter 5: 19 and 2 Peter 2 verse 11 and we see that they have power uh more than man can do but again they're not above what God allows them to do then I gave you several instances where the scripture specifically uses the phrase the angel of the Lord I gave you concerning Hagar in Genesis chapter 16 then when the angel of the Lord came to Abraham in Genesis 18 we find this a preist visitation to the Earth Genesis CH 22 to Abraham only this time the angel of the Lord called from heaven right this was not the angel beside him on the earth the angel called from heaven now this is one of those instances my mind wonders did a Abraham see the angel or did he only hear the angel I don't know it does not specifically say Genesis chapter 31 the angel spoke to Jacob in a dream and he said I am the god of bethl and I I just made a note I'm the god of the house of the go of God he's still god of the house of God he appeared to Moses in Exodus 3: 6 in the flame of a burning bush and I gave a scripture John 8:58 where Jesus identified himself as the I am the one in the burning bush then he appeared to Israel as a nation at the Red Sea as a pillar of clouds Exodus 14:19 the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them now I would like to mention that brother brandham repeatedly uh uses Exodus 23: 20 through 23 and he repeatedly calls him the angel of the Covenant behold behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the in unto the amorites the Hittites the perizzites the Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off now I take this scripture for myself because although I may not see something that I would would have the name Amorite hittite perizzite Canaanite hivite jebusite the spirits of every one of these IES continue to this day the spirits that They Carried are still in the Earth today and I am still having as a Believer I am still having to fight them you are having to fight them but if I will keep Covenant with the angel of the Covenant and I will beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not then I can be sure that he's going to show up yes and he's going to cut off praise God how will he cut him off well I cooperate with him by the preaching of the word I cooperate with this Angel of the Covenant when he comes by the word and I am it is revealed to me that there are Hees in my life that need to be cut off and I cooperate with him to allow him to cut them off he will cut them off oh yes there are some that I cooperate one time and they're gone and there are other times where I have to cooperate time and time and time and time and time again because it has a bigger hook in me than other things and I have to continue to cooperate with the angel of the Covenant because he is continuing to work to get all of the tentacles of that thing that have hooks in me he is coming by his spirit and by the word of God to cut the tentacles of that thing out of my life praise the Lord because they got hooks Hallelujah in me some things have more hooks than others because of how long they've been allowed to linger in our lives how long we've cooperated with them in our lives and the Holy Spirit has to come by his word and Time After Time After Time he has to come and cut them out of our Lives because that they're so incredibly hooked to us but we want all the hooks out of our Lives all of them I'm constantly praying God I don't want that to have a hook in me I don't want it to be a part of my life I want only the word of God to be who I am all right then he came to balum the angel of the Lord now remember I told you first of all the donkey saw him the angel of the Lord balum was so intent on money a meal ticket he was so intent on it till that he only had one thing in his mind and that was to go to curse the children of Israel but the donkey saw the angel of the Lord and finally balum saw the angel of the Lord as well and when balum saw the angel of the Lord his attitude was quickly changed you can read that in Numbers chapter 22: 22- 27 he came to Joshua in Joshua 5:13 he came as the captain of the host he appeared as a man when he came to Gideon the the angel of the Lord called Gideon a mighty man of Valor he appeared to him what he looked like or in what form Gideon saw him I do not know but he appeared to him he came to Samson's mother the angel of the Lord appeared to her and recognized her barrenness and again the angel of the Lord came back so that uh manoah could see him as well the angel of the Lord came to Phillip in Acts 8: 26-30 and the angel of the Lord spake to Phillip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert where they're fighting right now he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his Chariot reading Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Phillip go near and join yourself to this Chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet isaas and said understandest thou what thou readest so Phillip the angel of the Lord spoke to Phillip and gave him instru ruction and in in so being obedient to what the angel told him to do then Phillip was able to impart Revelation to this Ethiopian unic so then we go on to talk about how that angels are organized and ranked and and I am not smart enough to to really give you all that I would like to be able to give you but we know that there are Min Min ministering spirits that are a part of the Angelic hosts that come to us they're actually all of them are ministering spirits but Michael is not going to come to you every time Gabriel is not going to come to you every time the four living creatures are not going to come to you every time and I don't want to call them lesser Angels but I guess that's what they are I don't really know but they're they're they are in ranks so we have ministering Spirits we have Michael who is an archangel and and he's a chief leader and he contended with the devil disputing about the body of Moses and we also see Michael in Daniel chapter 10 and in Revelation 12 then we see Gabriel and we find him in Luke chap 1 and first of all he speaks to zecharias concerning the conception and the birth of John the baptizer and then he speaks to Mary concerning the conception and the birth of Jesus then he also talks in Daniel chapter 8 and chapter n to Daniel in chapter 8 cons helping Daniel to understand concerning goat Nations and then in jiel Daniel chapter 9 concerning the 70 weeks that are determined upon Daniel's people then we come to cherubim we hear so often about the Cherry beam that are that was put at the uh east of the Garden of Eden the Flaming sword which turn every way to keep the way to the tree of life then we see it also uh as as Moses was trying to bring into the Earth what he saw in the Heavenly realm uh Exodus 25:19 he was told to make one cherub on one end and the other cherub on the other end even of The Mercy Seat shall you make cherry Beam on the two ends thereof now once again I'm going to repeat what brother Shelley so often says cherubs are not I should say Cher beam are not little fat babies with a diaper Angels at all are not fat little babies with diapers that's right angels are warriors they're constantly fighting against demonic forces yes they are warriors to help to drive back demonic forces and again we keep uh we cooperate with them then we find in Ezekiel chap 10 and I would like to read verses 18 through 22 so that we can understand about the Cherub beam then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the Cherry beam the Cherry beam lift up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and everyone stood at the door of the East Gate of the Lord's House and the glory of the Lord of Israel was over them Above This is the living creature that I saw under the god of Israel by the river cabar and I knew that they were the Cherub beam everyone had four faces a piece and everyone four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings and the likeness of their faces was the the same faces which I saw by the river of kabar their appearances and themselves they went everyone straight forward now just so you know what he saw concerning their faces was the same as John saw in the Book of Revelation where that it was the face of an ox the face of a man the face of a calf and the eagle we'll get that in just a minute uh if I've got that wrong we know that in Luke chap 28 Lucifer who was the anointed cherub that coverthe was carried away on a power trip uh you can find that in Ezekiel chapter 28 now I want to I I I've got to look in at the word seraphim and the seraphim the the four living creatures we find that sarap is the singular seraphim is the plural and the word sarap which is the singular word is the meaning that strongs gives is serpent or fiery serpent found this very interesting and that was definition number one definition number two was sarap or seraphim and that word seraphim is taken from the Hebrew word 8313 sarf meaning to burn or to set on fire now I want you to realize that this is the same word that is used in numbers 21 when the Lord sent fiery serpents through the camp when the people spoke against God and against his servant Moses God sent fiery serpents through the camp these serpents were biting the people then the remedy for that was Moses was to take and build this fiery Serpent and put it on a pole and all the people had to do for their Deliverance was to look and they would live we read about the seraphim in Isaiah chapter 6 and the reason that I brought in concerning the fiery serpent is because it will give us more meaning when we go to Isaiah chapter 6 in the year that King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple Hallelujah above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet and with TW he did fly I just want you to notice the Cherry beam had four wings saraph have six wings and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of unclean PE or people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken en with the tongs from off of the altar here we bring in the fire right right here we bring in the fire that we need because we have been a people of unclean lips we have had words that have come out of our mouth that spewed uncleanness and we need the seraphim I'm telling you that through the prophetic word we have recently heard heard that even the even the four living creatures were coming to be a part of that Angelic host that was come to us so we're going to take the Cherub beam and we're going to take the seraphim and we're going to allow them to be a part of our life and the sarapin come unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and that iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also like to read Revelation 4: 6-8 and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so there we have lion calf man and flying eagle the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and in is to come the seraphim that Isaiah saw this they were doing the same thing crying holy holy holy to the Lord now again uh for those of you that were not here the book of the the the Book of Revelation the New Testament calls them beasts these are really the four living creatures there are two different words for beasts in the New Testament one being uh zoon which is the living being and then the other word is theion meaning a brutal beastial man a Brut of savage like the Beast system so we uh and I'll skip that last part charity uh so we we know that all of these have been uh given for us they're a part of who we are and we want to be able to cooperate with them now I want to read two quotes and then I'm going to give you a few things of how that I think that we can cooperate with the angels and how we can activate uh Angelic activity uh the first one I want to read is um out of order here I am the resurrection and life this one's a little bit lengthy but there's there's a quotation at the end that find uh amusing at the same time it has depth to it now look then Zacharias was a righteous man a priest he came to the house of God and his office was in there to burn incense while the people were praying and then one day while he was burning incense the time of the promise was drawing nigh and God sent an angel down to the altar then he he asks the congregation do you believe in angels they respond that they did he says yes sir and then he goes on to talk about someone said not long ago said brother brandom you're mistaken about that man that talks to you said that was the Lord I said it was an angel he said I am sent from the presence of God he wasn't the Lord he was an angel oh said that's all mistaken said brother brandom God in old times and the Bible spake said there was Daniel and all of them yeah they were had angels and so forth like that but not in the New Testament not in the New Testament Doctrine and this man was a man said we speak where the Bible speaks and Silent where the Bible is silent I thought how silent he was on many things on the that the Bible spoke I said do you mean to tell me that you don't believe the angels of God the man said no sir the Holy Spirit leads the church I said that's correctly but they have ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God he said not in the New Testament brother I said oh yes in the New Testament he said the Holy Spirit Not Angels the Holy Spirit I said look I want to ask you something I said it was the angel of God who met Mary he said yeah but that was before Pentecost and said after Pentecost it was the Holy Spirit from then on I said truly the Holy Spirit leads the church that's truth but look I said do you believe that Phillip had the baptism of the Holy Spirit do you believe it all of you sure he did when he went down in Samaria holding a RI Revival who was it that spoke to him and said go out out into the desert Gaza was it the Holy Spirit no sir an angel of the Lord spoke to him is that right go out to the desert Gaza and speak look how many believes that Peter had the Holy Spirit let's see you believe he had the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he was in prison that night and down at John Mark's house was having a prayer meeting for him who was it like the light that shined in the window and opened the doors for him was it the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord how many believes Paul had the Holy Ghost well when he was out there on the ship 14 days and nights no moon stars and all hope was gone he went down in the galley to pray he come back up said have a good courage for the angel of God whose servant I am stood by me last night said fear not Paul is that right the angel of the Lord the whole book of Revelations was wrote by a witness of an angel I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify of these things to write under the church is that right John fell down to worship the angel the angel said do it not now it's not Joseph Smith but he said a true Angel won't stand to be worshiped you know that no sir he said worship God and God still has angels and they visit the people not a worship of Angels but Angelic beings who are attributes of God sent forth to minister to the church through the people oh my how short we are of the real Apostolic church today of the blessing now I want you to listen to this quote we people who claim to be there who claim to have kissed the blessings of the rims of the cup of blessing how short we come how we bubble dance on top of the suds and know not what the bottom is that is true we've only touched the surface is what he's saying but he had a real way we bubble dance on top of the suds you get a cup full of something and it's got Suds on top of it and that's where he says we've been dancing but down in that cup there's some real substance that we want to get a hold of there's substance about the Angelic activity that we want to get a hold of and we want to cooperate with them we want to cooperate with God we want to cooperate with his spirit that he sends among us we want to cooperate with the Angelic activity that has been given to us in this end time so I have put together a couple let me read one more quote that brother Shelly read about this time time last year I think it's been on my refrigerator now for a year this is from Revelation book of symbols Angelic beings associate together oh I hope you get that that just dropped right down free look if you got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come in contact they got nothing in here to believe with but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes then a two-fold being one of this Earth to die and one of Heaven to live Amen in his body he's still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from Death un life hallu in his body is he has Earthly contact with the five senses but in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits him speaks with them their Messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual he's out to get first things first you can't put the KOA on before the foundation is laid see so we got to remember that first things first seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you if you have the Holy Ghost you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural so how do I cooperate with the angels and what can I do to activate Angelic activity the first thing that I have put down here is kindness we have already read Hebrews chapter 13 verse 2 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares if we find ourselves always in a bad mood and always being rude to people and God decides to show up in the form of a man but as an angel under the layers of skin that you see with your natural eye but you don't know it and you're just rude to everybody kindness will help us in association with the Angelic activity we also see that Abraham in chapter 18 of the Book of Genesis when the angel the Angels Came to him the the the scripture says the Lord appeared unto him in the ples of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and loow three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground there was a kindness in Abraham that he wanted to that I think that there was something in in Abraham that he recognized that this was otherworldly but they appeared as men and he went to them and he bowed down before them and said my Lord if I have found favor in your sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servants let a little water I pray you be fed Ed and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts after that you can pass on for therefore you're come to your servants and they said so do as thou Hast said so there was a kindness inside of of Abraham that he wanted to entertain men they look like men but there was something inside of Abraham that he he recognized maybe that they were not from this world but he he still offered them natural substance he offered to them a pan of water to wash their feet because they looked like they had been on a journey there was kindness to him then we there was another thing The Obedience how can we activate Angelic activity or how can we co cooperate with them we can do it through our obedience and I gave the scripture that when the devil left Jesus behold Angels Came and ministered to him I I give this one because you recognize that when Jesus went into the Wilderness and he was tempted all through his temptation the Angels were not there according to what we read in the scripture but Jesus was obedient perhaps he felt something perhaps he didn't just as you or I we go through these uh times of Temptation we go through times of trial we may feel the Lord we may not feel him but when we don't feel him it is it is our responsibility as a Believer to take the word that we know and defeat our enemy oh and as we walk in obedience with what we know when we're not feeling anything but we're operating in this temptation in this trial when we feel so alone when we feel like there's nobody here to help us and we feel like that there's not 12 Legions of angels to come and Deliver Us right we feel like we're all alone but if we still walk in obedience to what we know from the word of God I believe that the Angels afterward can be uh ushered in that's how we are cooperating through our obedience the next one I would say is that we cooperate through our humility I give J Daniel 10: 1-14 uh specifically verse 12 then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand and to chasen yourself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for Thy word so in this instance the word chasen means to humble yourself or chasing yourself to humble yourself then also Isaiah 662 for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been said the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word so it is our part to help to activate Angelic activity to have a contrite heart to have a humble heart to not be built up in Pride to be able to uh entertain these angels with a right Spirit to walk in a right spirit all times even when we don't feel anything we want our spirit to be kept right yes sir we want to allow the Holy Spirit to uh work in us that we're humbling ourself under his mighty hand so that he can exalt Us in due time but we can help to activate the Angelic activity by humbling ourselves in the presence of God not just when we come to church friends as Believers we ought not to be Hy to one another or to those that we work with those out in the public we can't let ourselves be hoty you want me give you a more modern word we can't find ourselves being jerks to one another or to our fellow man the light of God dwells in us and it is our responsibility to let the light shine before men that others can see the God of all eternity lives inside of us and he has made a difference in our lives the musicians can come as I finish up these other two that I have the number four I would say that we can help to activate Angelic activity by speaking the word Psalm 103:20 bless the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his Commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word so the angels are hearkening to the voice of his word the word of the Lord and when we take the word of the Lord and we are speaking it over our own lives no matter what we see no matter what we feel we are speaking the word of the Lord over our lives and it causes the angels to perk up their ears and to hear what we're saying that they can be launched according to what we're speaking yes let me take this just a little bit further bless the Lord ye is angels that excel in strength that do his Commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word I and you are a word sent from God we won't return void but we have a voice the word has a voice and as our voice is speaking the word of God the angels hearken to the voice of the word hallelujah we can take this a little bit farther because there will come a time when the Resurrection the voice of the Resurrection is going to be in the bride it is in the bride but there will come a time when she will call for the Resurrection the angels are hearing Hallelujah they are attached to the word Hallelujah God and His word are the same they are attached to the word and the angels as we speak the word the angels are activated and we're cooperating with the angels the last one which actually should have been the first one is worship Matthew CH 4: 8-10 again the the devil taketh him up into a exceeding high mountain and show him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give you if you will fall down and worship me then said Jesus unto him get thee hence saan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve Jesus used it is written right which tells me that it was written there were writings somewhere that Jesus was familiar with that he used against the devil so I would like to take you to Deuteronomy chapter 6:13 a part of the Torah 613 Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and serve him and thou shalt swear by his name now here it uses the word fear we're going to use the word fear and worship together fear equals reverential awe which is worship and then we go to Psalm 347 the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him or them that have reverential awe for him or them that worship Him the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them deliver them right the Angels do not encamp round about those that Grumble and complain and spout their torments and all of these things the angel of the Lord campath around about them that fear Him and He delivereth them as we worship as we're in awe of the goodness of God as we watch what the Lord does among us we are cooperating with the Angelic activity and we are allowing them by our worship by our reverential all we are in essence we are inviting the angels to come and do what they need to do you are not going to always know what the angel needs to do right we don't know what God needs to do for us sometimes you ever go to God clueless too often too often go to God clueless and I'm so glad that my Lord understands help Lord but he doesn't want us to be complainers where that all we're ever doing is saying Help Lord I'm miserable life is so rough help Lord he wants us to be in awe of his goodness he wants us to worship and in that worship we are helping to activate the Angelic activity we're causing a buzz around us in the spirit world it's causing a it's causing something to happen on the dark side because the the Angels of Darkness don't like it when we worship they don't like to hear the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they don't like it when we're entering into a place when we're able to forget all about ourselves and concentrate on him and worship him we want to activate the angels in whatever way that we can through humility through kindness through obedience through speaking the word through our worship we want to do whatever we can you can find other ways in the scripture that will help you that you will help that you will see and recognize that you can activate the Angelic activity in your life and we want to do that because it is God's promise to us that there would be an increase of angelic activity and I don't know about you but I don't want them standing around doing nothing that's right I want them to work I want them to be about Papa's business getting things done and I want to be one of those down on the earth who is in such cooperation with that Heavenly realm where that I am keeping myself in an attitude of worship and I'm walking in humility and obedience to the Lord Jesus and I'm using his word to defeat my enemy and the en the enemy is going back and the Angelic activity the Angelic host is coming in closer I'm not worshiping Angels I'm worshiping almighty God and thanking him that he sends them among us but I am so thankful for those helpers that are among us would you stand together with us and let's just Worship the Lord and just draw the host of heav heaven in close that he can do what he wants to and come and say Amen to the word of the Lord today thank you Lord thank you Lord thank Jesus and all

of feeble sometime but you receive them Lord and know that our heart hearts are full of your goodness your Tender Mercies toward us that never fail I looked across the body this morning and I saw those who look tired and weary I was in a position not preaching to be able to look and I saw those who caught up on their sleep and those who look like they've been beat up by the virus and whatever else but there was something that comes over you folks when you start worshiping him when you started singing Worthy is the Lamb I just looked across and it looked like a different congregation we're the same ones weary a little while ago battle scarred a little while ago but when we connect with our creator and we are not focusing anymore on the on the pain or the or the hurt or the heartache or the or the tiredness or the headache and we start focusing on his goodness it just transforms us it transfigures us our countenance change it changes because the glory light of God begins to fall on us I want to I want to bless you and encourage you and tell you that as often as you can be connected to him like that do it and take your opportunity many times through the day to just let him know how much you love him you don't have to get to church to raise your hands raise them in your home fill your home with praise fill your automobiles with praise be connected to him because it changes so much it's not just our look or our face that changes it changes us from from the inside we we uh I've been strengthened today by the word and I know that it was a review of Tuesday night but it really helped me to be able to see it on the screen and I know uh uh charity may she may regret that uh brother gley has discovered the the benefit of having it up she may be moaning I thought about her it's not easy what they do to get it up in time and and to get it uh uh you know the scripture put in and everything but aren't we blessed to be able to see it because most of us now are we didn't all start off to be Learners that way but but our modern technology has trained us all now and we have to see something in front of us to be able to focus and concentrate and it helped me a lot today as we went through and then the the end the summary of it was how to begin to create an atmosphere in your life that you learn to yield and you learn to cooperate with those Angelic beings that God has sent to us and brother brandham said some people don't see them because they don't believe in them they don't talk about them because they don't believe in them but but we do and uh we don't have to see them I I know I could tell in worship as we come to a close I could feel something rushing into us and I know they're coming to be nosy thank God they're coming to see what's happening in you and that's what the word says I'm blessed today and I know you are and we're not going to hold you any longer but thank you for being here good to see Solomon and Zion I knew they were coming but I absolutely forgot till I saw them when I come out on the platform uh she didn't quite make it for her birthday but she wasn't too many days late were you we're glad they're here and it's uh always good to have Hannah and Rachel kinzer with us they came to help us celebrate Joshua's birthday this time and we're happy to have them I'm glad that the Lord's been with us today father go with us now and would you strengthen our brother who laid it out for us so beautifully and this is one of those that we could go back and hear again reflect on it again and look at it again because this is an ongoing Revelation I I feel that the reason why you've promised that there would be an increase is because the need for them is going to increase and and so it's good for us to to to to focus on what the spirit is focusing on strengthen our bodies and minds and bring us back here Tuesday night ready to move forward in you those who are traveling today even watch over them and keep them safe to the airport and then from the airport home we've got so much to be thankful for we thank you for your leadership to us in this hour and the strength that comes when we gather together in your name we lift you up and love you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things and the church said amen take your Miracle with you I'm claiming mine I really did feel something rushing in when we were worshiping the Lord and I'm claiming mine and I want you to do the same let's sing that as they go out you are dismissed to go in the name of the Lord please continue throughout the day to pray for the skipworth family that God will be with them in every step that they make and heal their hurts and their wounds for I think most of you know that Haley was the only daughter of the skipworth's oldest son and there was a divorce many years ago in that family and and and the son is remarried and they all just loved that girl in in a in an incredible way she made such an impact on all the families involved and then her husband a childhood sweetheart and looking forward to welcoming that little baby into the world and God had a plan that nobody saw coming but he saw and he knew and he
