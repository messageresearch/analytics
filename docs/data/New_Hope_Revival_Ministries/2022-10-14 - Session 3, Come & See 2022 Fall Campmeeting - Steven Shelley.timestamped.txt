[22:30] [Music]
[22:34] bless your name Lord
[22:36] bless your name
[22:40] any Wonderful Tonight
[22:43] let me read a scripture to you that the
[22:46] Lord dealt with me about today first
[22:48] Samuel chapter 10.
[22:50] beginning in verse 5 after that
[22:53] thou shall come to the hill of God where
[22:57] is the Garrison of the Philistines and
[23:00] it shall come to pass when thou art come
[23:02] thither to the city that thou shall meet
[23:05] a company of prophets coming down from
[23:07] the high place with a sultry
[23:10] where the tablet and a pipe and a harp
[23:14] before them and they shall prophesy and
[23:18] the spirit of the Lord will come upon
[23:20] them
[23:21] upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with
[23:25] them
[23:26] and shall be turned into another man
[23:34] and let it be when these signs are come
[23:37] unto thee that thou do as occasions
[23:39] serve thee for God is with thee
[23:45] does somebody want to guess who that
[23:47] prophecy was to
[23:48] Saul
[23:51] this is when God was calling Saul to be
[23:53] king of Israel if you go on and read a
[23:56] few more verses it says he his heart was
[23:58] changed God gave him another heart when
[24:01] he encountered these singing Prophets
[24:05] isn't that strange
[24:08] and and so I just wanted to look up some
[24:10] of these words and we don't have time to
[24:11] do it tonight but I wanted to look up
[24:13] some of these words because we fall
[24:15] under criticism from time to time we're
[24:18] not paranoid but we fall under criticism
[24:21] sometime because we have drums and
[24:23] because we clap and because we dance and
[24:26] because we're loud all the things that
[24:29] you've observed already
[24:32] and uh we just all we know to do is what
[24:35] God called us to do and worship the way
[24:37] he called us to worship but I looked up
[24:40] that word tabrit it sometimes translated
[24:43] timbrel it's sometimes translated
[24:47] tambourine but as I searched out a
[24:50] little bit today it is a a hand drum
[24:54] it is a drum that was held in the hand
[24:57] and beaten with a small stick
[25:00] so sometimes it was just an animal skin
[25:03] so it was boom boom boom boom boom and
[25:07] other times there were there were
[25:09] tinkling sounds little little pieces of
[25:13] Glass and Metal that were around it like
[25:16] a tambourine and it made little tingling
[25:18] sound
[25:19] so I don't know which kind they had that
[25:22] day but it didn't disturb the spirit of
[25:25] the Lord
[25:28] it's not nearly as nervous as we are
[25:33] we are
[25:35] he doesn't need anti-anxiety medication
[25:41] calmer than a cucumber
[25:43] you can worship and you're not going to
[25:46] disturb him but you can stand there with
[25:48] a quiet voice and let your heart be in
[25:51] tune with him and you can be just as
[25:54] much in the spirit
[25:56] as anybody in the room
[25:58] so you don't judge anybody else's praise
[26:01] you just enter in and give him praise if
[26:04] when we leave here tonight brother
[26:06] Greeley and I just prayed in the office
[26:08] again and and this is what we agreed on
[26:11] if we leave here tonight and God has
[26:15] been glorified and his perfect will has
[26:19] been accomplished in this service we're
[26:21] going to go to bed happy men
[26:23] no matter what it looks like
[26:26] no matter what it looks like
[26:30] if he wants to call us all on our faces
[26:33] in Repentance I'm ready
[26:36] if he wants us to celebrate this is a
[26:39] feast of joy sakota is a feast of Joy if
[26:42] he wants us to celebrate we're already
[26:44] getting ready for that
[26:46] I just want him to have his way so don't
[26:48] you be distracted by anybody else's uh
[26:51] uh exuberant extravagant praise you
[26:55] connect with God how you can the best
[26:57] but just remember this
[26:59] praise is not about you
[27:03] [Music]
[27:04] it's not about me it's not about what we
[27:07] prefer
[27:09] it's about what God prefers
[27:11] and if you want to discover what God
[27:13] prefers what would you do you'd go to
[27:15] his word
[27:17] you just let God have his way and we'll
[27:18] be all right tonight
[27:22] [Applause]

[56:20] all my needs
[56:24] his arms stretch wide will you be my

[56:48] and on my knees

[57:21] when she's finished we'll turn the
[57:23] service to brother Greeley to bring the
[57:24] word but we're anxious to hear from
[57:26] Sister Anita tonight may God bless her
[57:32] are you playing for her too aren't you
[57:34] Jonathan
[57:40] [Music]
[57:53] [Music]
[58:02] you know I thank the Lord for so many
[58:05] miracles and one of those is my mother
[58:08] you know she raised us along and uh
[58:11] there were five of us and the number six
[58:13] came along and Mom raised us and there
[58:16] are so many Supernatural things that
[58:17] happened brother Shelley that I saw with
[58:19] my natural eyes and I was in church
[58:21] where I saw demons cast out where I saw
[58:25] the people raised up that were not going
[58:28] to make it you know and last year about
[58:30] this time we were all in that season
[58:32] with Stephen and God raised him up and
[58:35] gave us six more months
[58:37] he answered our prayers and you know
[58:39] when brother
[58:40] um Dwayne Jackson was preaching the
[58:42] other day it hit me between the eyes
[58:44] because I'd always beat myself up
[58:46] because I wasn't with Stephen when he
[58:48] actually passed and I realized that I
[58:50] would have battled against God's will
[58:52] had I been there and I would have tried
[58:54] to resurrect him I would have because I
[58:57] saw it happen before you know so I know
[59:00] that the Lord it wasn't just the neatest
[59:02] prayers it was all of our prayers that
[59:03] God allowed us five more months with
[59:06] Stephen and then God gave him his harsh
[59:08] desire one of the things he said before
[59:10] he passed was I cannot wait to move My
[59:13] Arms Around Jesus
[59:15] and this song that we're going to sing
[59:17] and thank God that Jonathan is here to
[59:19] play it and Crystal's going to sing with
[59:21] me because you know it's still not easy
[59:22] to get up by myself without that sound
[59:24] that only Stephen Paul Curry could
[59:27] create but I am so grateful for that it
[59:29] lives on in his children it lives on in
[59:31] all of us the sound of the Bride so I
[59:34] pray that you'll just uh worship with us
[59:36] and the one that penned this song I'm
[59:38] like how in the world brother Shelley
[59:40] that they find my heart's desire
[59:43] how did they pin that the very thing
[59:45] like sister of Hope tonight she panned
[59:48] exactly how we feel and I thank God for
[59:51] the spoken word and I thank for the
[59:53] voice of Deliverance so worship with us
[59:55] tonight
[1:00:00] and if you know it sing it with me

[1:09:23] guess brother you've come the farthest
[1:09:25] now we have a brother here from Iceland
[1:09:27] but brother Chris flew in today from
[1:09:32] Israel
[1:09:33] he was there on a tour with his dad and
[1:09:36] some other brothers
[1:09:37] and he had a desire to change his ticket
[1:09:39] and come to camp meeting
[1:09:42] we're all admitting that it would be
[1:09:44] hard for us to make that decision so
[1:09:46] we've got a lot of confidence in you
[1:09:49] that God's going to meet you while
[1:09:51] you're here there's got to be a reason

[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] in your Holiness word of God
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] we indeed desire for you to do that
[1:10:39] tonight Lord
[1:10:41] that the word of God would speak into
[1:10:43] our lives and do for us what we cannot
[1:10:47] do for ourselves
[1:10:49] we yield to you now
[1:10:52] we ask you to hide us behind the cross
[1:10:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:57] God you guide this service exactly the
[1:11:00] way you desire for it to go
[1:11:06] let your name be glorified in all that
[1:11:09] is said and done
[1:11:11] for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:13] Christ that we pray
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:19] if you have your Bibles with you tonight
[1:11:22] like to start in Revelation chapter 19.
[1:11:26] what an honor it is for you to be in the
[1:11:28] house of the Lord with us
[1:11:42] several weeks back
[1:11:45] brother Shelley came to me and he said I
[1:11:48] would like for you to preach
[1:11:50] Sunday
[1:11:51] and Tuesday
[1:11:54] and somehow God had other plans
[1:11:58] or maybe he already knew God's plans and
[1:12:01] he just wasn't letting it all out at one
[1:12:03] time
[1:12:04] Revelation chapter 19
[1:12:07] starting in
[1:12:12] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:12:16] honor to him
[1:12:18] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:12:21] his wife hath made herself ready
[1:12:26] and to her was granted that she should
[1:12:29] be arrayed in fine linen
[1:12:32] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:12:36] the righteousness of the Saints
[1:12:39] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:12:43] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:12:45] supper of the lamb and he saith unto me
[1:12:48] these are the true sayings of God
[1:12:52] and I fell at his feet to worship Him
[1:12:56] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[1:13:01] I am thy fellow servant
[1:13:04] and of thy Brethren that have the
[1:13:07] testimony of Jesus
[1:13:10] worship God
[1:13:13] for the testimony of Jesus
[1:13:16] is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:13:20] now I want to point something out before
[1:13:23] we move on
[1:13:25] because
[1:13:27] whoever this was
[1:13:29] that John fell down before
[1:13:34] he said get up
[1:13:38] he fell down to worship Him
[1:13:41] but he said don't do it I am just one of
[1:13:45] the fellow servants and you know what
[1:13:46] that tells me it was somebody had
[1:13:49] attained the character of Jesus Christ
[1:13:54] to the point that John fell down to
[1:13:57] worship Him
[1:13:58] all right I would like to read
[1:14:00] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:14:03] verse 8 through 11.
[1:14:06] I know that camp meeting a couple of
[1:14:09] years ago this was the theme but just go
[1:14:12] with me if you will Revelation chapter
[1:14:14] 10 verse 8 and the voice which I heard
[1:14:17] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:14:20] go
[1:14:21] and take the little book which is open
[1:14:25] in the hand of the angel
[1:14:28] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:14:31] Earth
[1:14:32] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:14:35] him give me the little book and he said
[1:14:38] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:14:41] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:14:44] be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:14:48] and I took the little book out of the
[1:14:50] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[1:14:54] my mouth sweet as honey
[1:14:57] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:15:01] was bitter
[1:15:03] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:15:07] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:15:11] and tongues and kings in other words it
[1:15:16] cannot stay on the inside there is
[1:15:19] something that happens on the inside
[1:15:22] that when the word become it goes down
[1:15:26] sweet as honey but then it starts to
[1:15:29] work around in there and all of the
[1:15:32] sudden it's got to come up and out and
[1:15:35] that is the Mandate of the Bride of
[1:15:38] Jesus Christ in the end time that we are
[1:15:41] to prophesy again to many peoples and
[1:15:45] Nations and tongues and Kings the Lord
[1:15:49] bless you you may have your seat tonight
[1:15:51] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:15:53] word when no when this scripture when it
[1:15:57] begins to have an effect in US it starts
[1:16:02] doing something seen to us because we
[1:16:05] realize that God is doing something in a
[1:16:09] many-membered bride that is it's no more
[1:16:12] a one-man Ministry it is something that
[1:16:16] God wants to uh go out and be in a many
[1:16:21] membered people because there are many
[1:16:25] people that have not yet heard of the
[1:16:28] truths of the Living God and he would
[1:16:31] like for us to be those Messengers who
[1:16:36] will carry the truth of God's word into
[1:16:40] the Earth in the end time
[1:16:43] in order to do that it is necessary for
[1:16:48] us to eat the book
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:51] it is necessary for us to eat the word
[1:16:55] of God and in order for us to have
[1:16:58] something to say it is more than a
[1:17:02] Sunday school lesson
[1:17:05] it has to be a word in due season
[1:17:10] because when it's a word in due season
[1:17:13] then it will hit its Target with much
[1:17:17] more uh Gusto will say it'll end with
[1:17:21] much more Dynamics than if we just are
[1:17:24] all the time popping off at the mouth
[1:17:26] just because we have something to say
[1:17:29] but the the the Holy Spirit desires for
[1:17:33] us to be living vessels of the Lord
[1:17:37] Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] so the the the the tenth verse of
[1:17:42] Revelation chapter 9 I fell at his feet
[1:17:45] to worship Him He said see you do it not
[1:17:48] I'm a fellow servant of thy Brethren
[1:17:49] that have the testimony of Jesus worship
[1:17:53] God for the testimony of Jesus is the
[1:17:58] spirit of Prophecy now the in order for
[1:18:02] the spirit of Prophecy to take its
[1:18:05] effect in us there and and for us to
[1:18:08] start looking uh like Jesus Christ there
[1:18:13] has to be the word as I said in due
[1:18:16] season and we have to hear it with
[1:18:19] Spirit ears
[1:18:21] and so I'm going to call on you to do
[1:18:24] that tonight because I feel like that I
[1:18:27] have something to say and I'm not going
[1:18:30] to say everything right it's impossible
[1:18:34] and I'm going to leave some things
[1:18:36] veiled because I want you to tune your
[1:18:40] ear to the frequency of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:43] and let him speak to you as we are
[1:18:47] transitioning now for what God wants to
[1:18:50] do in the rest of this weekend now we
[1:18:54] know that God has a five-fold Ministry
[1:18:58] that he placed in the earth in the end
[1:19:01] time Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. let's
[1:19:06] just read it if you have it handy there
[1:19:08] Austin
[1:19:09] he gave some apostles
[1:19:12] some Prophets
[1:19:14] some evangelists some pastors and
[1:19:18] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:19:21] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:19:24] the edifying of the body of Christ now
[1:19:27] this five-fold ministry
[1:19:30] Apostles prophets
[1:19:33] evangelists teachers and pastors this
[1:19:36] five-fold ministry was given into the
[1:19:39] Earth because God chose that to to
[1:19:44] perfect the Saints the word that would
[1:19:46] come up out of their mouth now you we
[1:19:49] don't want anybody to become offended
[1:19:51] but sometimes we would say uh if you
[1:19:55] want to get closer to the fire come
[1:19:57] closer to the front now that is not to
[1:20:01] lift up a man that may be leading
[1:20:03] worshiper preaching the gospel but let's
[1:20:06] just think about what a man of God who
[1:20:10] stands behind this desk he has been in
[1:20:13] the presence of the law Lord to seek out
[1:20:15] a message of truth that we would be able
[1:20:19] to deliver to the people in the due
[1:20:22] season and so that way would stand to
[1:20:25] reason if you've been out working all
[1:20:27] day and you've been around all kinds of
[1:20:29] things and he has been by himself in the
[1:20:31] presence of the Lord trying to get a
[1:20:33] word from the Lord then there is should
[1:20:36] be more of the fire of God up around
[1:20:39] here and it should be in order for him
[1:20:41] to be able to deliver the word now God
[1:20:44] gave some Apostles he placed these gifts
[1:20:48] in men and and he took profits and he's
[1:20:52] still using prophets in this day and he
[1:20:56] has pastors who are under the unction of
[1:20:59] the Holy Ghost to lead a congregation
[1:21:02] and we have been told in this day that a
[1:21:05] pastor is the highest Authority in a
[1:21:08] local uh church and then we have the
[1:21:12] evangelists and we are told that they
[1:21:15] come through and they give these fiery
[1:21:17] message messages and sometimes they
[1:21:20] cause a little trouble by what they stir
[1:21:22] up and they leave town and leave it for
[1:21:24] the pastor to take care of and then we
[1:21:26] have teachers because sometimes it takes
[1:21:30] a necessity for a person a man to slow
[1:21:35] down
[1:21:37] and not be so out of breath
[1:21:39] so that you can understand and catch
[1:21:43] what is trying to be taught
[1:21:45] now I am not ashamed tonight to stand
[1:21:49] before you and tell you that I believe
[1:21:52] that God sent a word prophet in our day
[1:21:57] his name was William Branham I say a
[1:22:01] word Prophet because I believe that the
[1:22:04] word testified or prophesied rather that
[1:22:09] he would be here in the earth in the end
[1:22:11] time I find that in Malachi chapter 4
[1:22:15] you may say well that was John the
[1:22:18] Baptist well John the Baptist was also
[1:22:21] prophesied and in order for you to get
[1:22:24] the whole picture you have to read the
[1:22:25] rest of the book and you can go to Luke
[1:22:28] chapter 1 and you can find that John the
[1:22:31] Baptist only fulfilled a part of that
[1:22:34] commission he turned the hearts of the
[1:22:37] fathers to the children
[1:22:40] and then the messenger in our day turned
[1:22:43] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:22:46] fathers now in order for us to really
[1:22:50] get a grasp of that and and receive the
[1:22:54] word that come out of his mouth there
[1:22:57] has to be a belief that God indeed did
[1:23:00] send that Prophet now I'm not dwelling
[1:23:03] on that tonight what I want to dwell on
[1:23:06] is that God still has Apostles prophets
[1:23:11] pastors evangelists teachers that
[1:23:14] five-fold Ministry is still in the Earth
[1:23:17] today
[1:23:19] and I would like to focus on the
[1:23:23] prophetic tonight because I believe that
[1:23:26] God is about to shift this meeting and
[1:23:29] it is necessary for us to have ears to
[1:23:33] hear what the spirit would say unto the
[1:23:36] church all right Deuteronomy 29 29 the
[1:23:41] secret things belong to the Lord Our God
[1:23:44] but those things which are revealed
[1:23:48] belong to us
[1:23:51] now God gave prophets to reveal the word
[1:23:56] of God
[1:23:57] now lest you should get nervous I want
[1:24:00] you to understand
[1:24:02] any prophecy
[1:24:05] any prophetic word any word that I
[1:24:09] preach it must come back and it must
[1:24:12] dovetail with this the absolute that God
[1:24:16] has given to us
[1:24:18] if it doesn't dovetail with this then we
[1:24:21] need to either throw it out or lay it
[1:24:23] aside
[1:24:25] that's good my recommendation is
[1:24:29] don't throw it away just yet
[1:24:32] unless
[1:24:34] you can for sure prove it is not in the
[1:24:37] word
[1:24:38] because there are things that we have
[1:24:41] said with our mouth I can't find that in
[1:24:43] the scripture I don't understand that
[1:24:46] and then in later time God comes along
[1:24:48] and he reveals that it's there it just
[1:24:52] took some time for our understanding to
[1:24:55] get to a place where he could speak to
[1:24:57] us
[1:24:58] all right so that that the things which
[1:25:01] are revealed belong to us and to our
[1:25:04] children forever that we may do all the
[1:25:07] words of this law now I want to tell you
[1:25:11] that God gives word prophets again he
[1:25:14] gives prophets that are according to the
[1:25:17] fivefold ministry such as agabus into
[1:25:20] acts 21 10 who had more than the gift of
[1:25:24] Prophecy likes Philip's daughters who
[1:25:27] were in the previous verses Philip's
[1:25:30] daughters were they had the gift of
[1:25:33] Prophecy but they were not prophets
[1:25:36] seers as agabus was now Amos 3 7 says
[1:25:41] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:25:45] he Reveals His secret unto his servants
[1:25:49] the prophets
[1:25:52] Amos carried the prophetic anointing
[1:25:55] that God used to speak to his people to
[1:25:59] bring them into alignment with their
[1:26:01] papa who had brought them out of Egypt
[1:26:05] and that's what the prophetic voice does
[1:26:08] it is to bring us back into alignment
[1:26:11] with God for the moment of time that we
[1:26:13] live in and so he wants to he God
[1:26:17] desires to speak to us not just with
[1:26:21] good preaching or with Evangelistic
[1:26:23] preaching or just a pastor kind of
[1:26:26] preaching but he wants to speak to us in
[1:26:29] a prophetic voice a prophetic utterance
[1:26:32] that will help us to get above this
[1:26:35] world that we live in
[1:26:38] yeah
[1:26:40] now I believe
[1:26:43] that there are
[1:26:45] good preachers
[1:26:47] all over the Earth
[1:26:49] they're called of God
[1:26:51] there are good pastors there are good
[1:26:53] evangelists there are good uh teachers
[1:26:58] these are moving about but a prophet and
[1:27:02] Apostle have a different calling
[1:27:04] and we need to be aware when they're
[1:27:07] around us that we don't dismiss their
[1:27:09] voice that it's just another preacher
[1:27:13] and Amos he came to the people in in
[1:27:16] Amos chapter 5 and and he acknowledged
[1:27:20] to the people that God had acknowledged
[1:27:23] them and through this utterance of Amos
[1:27:27] he acknowledged that the children of
[1:27:29] Israel
[1:27:31] had indeed
[1:27:33] carried the Tabernacle of God
[1:27:36] through the wilderness
[1:27:40] that was God's plan
[1:27:42] he said I want you to have tents we're
[1:27:46] in the Feast of Tabernacles we built
[1:27:49] this we built this uh sukkah out here
[1:27:51] because the scripture tells us that all
[1:27:54] of Israel are to build sukkas to
[1:27:58] remember year by year that at one time
[1:28:01] God's people dwelt in booths or Intense
[1:28:04] or in Tabernacles they dwelt in a
[1:28:07] movable structure I don't know how
[1:28:09] movable that one is as it is but
[1:28:12] nonetheless a movable structure it was
[1:28:14] not the permanent structure neither was
[1:28:17] the tabernacle where that they went to
[1:28:20] offer sacrifices and where the there was
[1:28:24] the the Ark of the Covenant the holy of
[1:28:27] holies it was there but every time that
[1:28:30] God said it's time to move
[1:28:33] yeah
[1:28:35] every time that the pillar of fire moved
[1:28:39] there were no excuses
[1:28:43] I'm tired today I'm sick today I don't
[1:28:46] feel like moving that thing today ah
[1:28:49] just uh we just moved it last week why
[1:28:52] do we have to do it again there were no
[1:28:54] excuses because Moses knew when that
[1:28:58] Pillar of Fire that Shekinah of God when
[1:29:01] it moved it was time to move there was
[1:29:04] no way that they could stay put they had
[1:29:07] to move and so now Amos is right here
[1:29:10] and he is he is coming to the people and
[1:29:13] he is saying to them God wants you to
[1:29:16] know that he saw every time that you
[1:29:19] moved that Tabernacle
[1:29:21] but God also wants you to know
[1:29:24] that he saw every time you put those
[1:29:28] Idols of yours in your back pocket
[1:29:31] as you were carrying the ark and the
[1:29:34] Tabernacle and going to the next site
[1:29:41] I want you to know says the Lord
[1:29:44] that I saw that you were doing what I
[1:29:49] said to do but really your heart wasn't
[1:29:51] in it you were only doing it because you
[1:29:54] didn't want in trouble with Moses or
[1:29:57] maybe you didn't want me to have to send
[1:29:58] another brass serpent among you but uh I
[1:30:01] notice that you weren't really having a
[1:30:05] heart of worship as you move my stuff
[1:30:08] around in the wilderness because you
[1:30:11] were still carrying all of your Idols
[1:30:14] with you as you went from place to place
[1:30:23] now I don't know what was in the minds
[1:30:25] of the people
[1:30:28] but we can watch people in general
[1:30:32] and Evan you you can watch people that
[1:30:36] they say they believe God
[1:30:39] but they generally have a backup plan
[1:30:43] if things don't work out the way they
[1:30:45] thought it ought to work out
[1:30:48] if I get sick and I go get prayed for
[1:30:50] and I don't get healed I got a good
[1:30:53] doctor
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:55] nothing wrong with doctors not at all
[1:31:00] but there's a way that we approach God
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:06] if God don't work I got a backup plan
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] but God sent Amos among the people to
[1:31:16] let them know that they were still in
[1:31:20] this situation where they were they they
[1:31:22] still were willing to move the
[1:31:24] Tabernacle but they weren't going
[1:31:26] without their own Idols because they
[1:31:28] felt like that they needed a backup plan
[1:31:32] so I want you to go with me to the Book
[1:31:34] of Amos chapter 7.
[1:31:38] Amos chapter 7.
[1:31:44] verse 7.
[1:31:48] then he showed me and behold the Lord
[1:31:51] stood upon a wall made by a Plumb line
[1:31:55] with a Plumb line in his hand
[1:31:58] everybody know what a Plumb line is
[1:32:03] is a heavy weight on a string
[1:32:06] that is hung
[1:32:09] in order for something to be built
[1:32:12] according to that line
[1:32:15] now I want you
[1:32:17] to remember something that we have been
[1:32:20] told through the years
[1:32:23] any Brick Mason can lay a straight line
[1:32:28] now
[1:32:31] don't mean to take issue with that
[1:32:35] but I've seen a lot of what was supposed
[1:32:38] to be straight line brickwork
[1:32:41] that was not real straight
[1:32:50] Eddie Mason can lay astray a straight
[1:32:52] line
[1:32:53] but it takes a real Mason to turn a
[1:32:56] corner
[1:32:58] and at this corner when this Plumb line
[1:33:00] is dropped and there this I don't think
[1:33:04] they do it a whole lot with brickwork
[1:33:05] anymore but nonetheless when this Plumb
[1:33:08] line is dropped it is to designate a
[1:33:12] straight line because the weight is
[1:33:15] holding that string taut it's holding it
[1:33:18] straight
[1:33:19] now when we talk about a Plumb line in
[1:33:23] the word of God generally this Plumb
[1:33:26] line is something for us to measure up
[1:33:28] to
[1:33:30] and many times we find ourself in a
[1:33:33] crooked position
[1:33:36] and when we find ourselves in this
[1:33:39] crooked position
[1:33:40] we have a choice when the Plumb line
[1:33:43] drops
[1:33:45] we can remain in our crooked position
[1:33:49] or we can allow the word of God to come
[1:33:52] inside of us as we talked about a minute
[1:33:55] ago and let it start working on the
[1:33:58] inside and all of the sudden then we
[1:34:01] start straightening up because we've
[1:34:04] recognized that God has sent a Plumb
[1:34:08] line word that we've got to measure up
[1:34:11] to
[1:34:12] and so in order for that Plumb line word
[1:34:15] to to have an effect in US it takes
[1:34:19] belief on our part
[1:34:26] if God sends someone Among Us
[1:34:30] whether it be a pastor a teacher an
[1:34:33] evangelist and a prophet an apostle it
[1:34:36] is necessary even someone with a gift of
[1:34:39] Prophecy it is necessary for us to
[1:34:43] connect to that word and say I believe
[1:34:46] that word
[1:34:47] or we have the other way we can say I
[1:34:51] don't have anything to do with that
[1:34:55] say well who would say that there are
[1:34:57] many people through the years that have
[1:34:59] done exactly that it may have never been
[1:35:02] words out of their mouth but all you had
[1:35:04] to do was watch through time as
[1:35:07] something happened things were happening
[1:35:09] in their life and where they were
[1:35:10] crooked and they denied the plum line
[1:35:12] word they got crookeder and crookeder
[1:35:15] and crookeder and crooked or if that's a
[1:35:16] word more crooked more crooked more
[1:35:19] crooked
[1:35:20] all right so the Plumb line is in the
[1:35:22] midst of My People Israel I will not
[1:35:25] again pass by them anymore
[1:35:28] and the high places of Isaac shall be
[1:35:31] desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel
[1:35:34] shall be laid waste and I will rise
[1:35:38] against the house of jeroboam with a
[1:35:41] sword
[1:35:43] then amaziah the priest of Bethel sent
[1:35:46] to jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos
[1:35:49] has conspired against thee in the midst
[1:35:51] of the House of Israel the land is not
[1:35:53] able to Bear all his words for thus Amos
[1:35:56] saith jeroboam shall die by The Sword in
[1:35:59] Israel shall surely be led away captive
[1:36:01] out of their land I want you to pay
[1:36:04] attention to what is written here also
[1:36:07] amaziah said unto Amos oh thou Seer go
[1:36:10] flee thou away into the land of Judah
[1:36:12] and bury bread and prophesy there but
[1:36:15] prophesy not anymore at Bethel for it is
[1:36:18] the King's Chapel and it is the King's
[1:36:20] Court then Amos answered and said to
[1:36:23] amaziah I was no Prophet neither was I a
[1:36:28] prophet's son but I was a Herdman and a
[1:36:31] gatherer of sycamore fruit and the Lord
[1:36:34] took me as I followed the flock and the
[1:36:37] Lord said unto me go prophesy unto My
[1:36:41] People Israel now therefore or hear the
[1:36:44] word of the Lord thou sayest prophesy
[1:36:46] not against Israel and drop not Thy word
[1:36:49] against the house of Israel therefore
[1:36:51] thus saith the Lord thy wife shall be in
[1:36:53] harlot in the city thy sons and thy
[1:36:56] daughters shall fall By The Sword and
[1:36:58] thy land shall be divided by line you'll
[1:37:01] die in a polluted land and Israel shall
[1:37:04] surely go into captivity
[1:37:06] forth of his land
[1:37:10] now Amos
[1:37:13] very plainly tells amaziah
[1:37:17] I was not a prophet
[1:37:20] I wasn't even the son of a prophet
[1:37:23] but God sent me to prophesy
[1:37:27] now Amos this prophecy in
[1:37:30] Amos chapter 7 this prophecy was against
[1:37:35] jeroboam
[1:37:37] the jeroboam was the king at present of
[1:37:41] the divided House of Israel
[1:37:45] amaziah the priest didn't like the
[1:37:48] prophecy that was given we could see
[1:37:50] that there now
[1:37:52] during the reign of Solomon
[1:37:56] David's son
[1:37:58] during his reign
[1:38:00] he had a gentleman by the name of
[1:38:05] jeroboam who had been promoted to be
[1:38:07] ruler over all of the charge of Joseph
[1:38:12] Solomon put him in that position
[1:38:15] now jeroboam must have
[1:38:19] been upset with Solomon over Milo
[1:38:26] Solomon was building up all of these
[1:38:29] places around Jerusalem that had maybe
[1:38:33] gone into disrepair but jeroboam took uh
[1:38:37] he he was upset because all of this
[1:38:40] labor was on the backs of the people
[1:38:45] and Solomon didn't seem to care all he
[1:38:48] cared about was making everything
[1:38:50] beautiful for oh I mean he built the the
[1:38:53] temple for for the Lord but then as he
[1:38:58] began to take on these uh these women
[1:39:01] that were outside of Israel these women
[1:39:04] foreign women and he began to have all
[1:39:07] of these lovers that his attention was
[1:39:10] diverted from the god of Israel and the
[1:39:13] Bible says that he started going after
[1:39:15] their gods
[1:39:16] and and apparently he was making
[1:39:19] beautiful houses and homes for all of
[1:39:23] these women but he was doing all this
[1:39:25] labor on the backs of the Israelite and
[1:39:28] jeroboam took issue with that and he
[1:39:31] started voicing his opinion
[1:39:36] started voicing his opinion
[1:39:38] and as he voiced his opinion
[1:39:42] he knew he was going to have to flee the
[1:39:44] country
[1:39:46] before he fled the country there was a
[1:39:49] prophet that came and met him beside of
[1:39:53] the wall
[1:39:54] and says to him
[1:39:57] jeroboam had on a new coat
[1:40:01] and this Prophet came up to him
[1:40:05] and ripped his coat off
[1:40:08] and hacked it into 12 pieces
[1:40:11] representing the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:40:14] and as
[1:40:16] this code is being ripped off of him and
[1:40:19] this Prophet is prophesying the prophet
[1:40:23] tells him you are going to lead the
[1:40:27] house of Israel
[1:40:30] jeroboam flees
[1:40:32] goes to Egypt
[1:40:34] Solomon dies I know this is a little
[1:40:37] slow but I want you to get this story
[1:40:40] Solomon dies and his son
[1:40:43] rehabil him now is the king over all of
[1:40:49] the nation of Israel
[1:40:51] all 12 tribes
[1:40:55] jeroboam gets word
[1:40:58] that
[1:40:59] Solomon has died the man that was after
[1:41:02] him because he voiced his opinion
[1:41:05] the man that was after him was dead
[1:41:07] rehabo him is now the king
[1:41:11] and he decides that he's going to come
[1:41:13] back into the Kingdom of Israel and he's
[1:41:16] going to have a little chat with real
[1:41:18] boy
[1:41:20] so he gathered some of the men of Israel
[1:41:23] and he goes and he starts talking to
[1:41:25] rehaboom and he says rehobo him
[1:41:30] you know your father
[1:41:33] was really hard
[1:41:35] on the people of Israel
[1:41:39] and do you realize rehoboam that if you
[1:41:44] you kind to these people they would do
[1:41:46] anything for you
[1:41:52] why don't you let up a little bit
[1:41:54] from what your father was doing
[1:41:58] rehoboam says give me three days and
[1:42:01] come back
[1:42:05] so jeroboam goes away
[1:42:08] rehoboam
[1:42:10] goes to some counselors
[1:42:13] the first counselors that he went to
[1:42:17] told him
[1:42:19] or the the first counselors he went to
[1:42:21] were of the Elder generation
[1:42:25] the older folks the old men
[1:42:29] the old man told him
[1:42:32] you ought to listen to jeroboam there's
[1:42:34] good that there's good wisdom in what he
[1:42:36] said
[1:42:38] rehoboam said thank you very much
[1:42:42] and then he went to the young men
[1:42:46] the men that he grew up with
[1:42:49] those that he had been around all of his
[1:42:52] life frolicked with probably went to the
[1:42:55] bar with and did this with and did that
[1:42:57] with and he those young men said you
[1:43:02] know what you really ought to tell them
[1:43:05] my little finger is going to be bigger
[1:43:09] than my father's loin
[1:43:16] in other words don't let up
[1:43:19] don't let up
[1:43:21] so
[1:43:23] rehoboam decided to take the counsel of
[1:43:26] the young men
[1:43:28] and when he took the counsel of the
[1:43:30] young men
[1:43:32] he came back to jeroboam and the house
[1:43:34] of Israel and he said
[1:43:36] listen to me
[1:43:39] he said
[1:43:40] my father chastised you with whips
[1:43:44] I'm going to chastise you with scorpions
[1:43:52] I'm not going to let up on you
[1:43:55] I'm not gonna let up at all
[1:43:57] now because that rehoboam took the
[1:44:00] counsel of the younger man
[1:44:02] prophecy was fulfilled
[1:44:07] because
[1:44:09] of that happening the way rehoboam
[1:44:12] responded
[1:44:14] to the house of Israel the kingdom was
[1:44:18] ripped away from him now we've got to
[1:44:19] remember that it had been said years
[1:44:21] before that God was going to do it
[1:44:26] in fact I believe that he had told
[1:44:28] Solomon but he said I'm not going to do
[1:44:30] it to you I'm going to wait till it's
[1:44:32] your son now I'm going to let you go and
[1:44:34] and you're going to wrestle your fathers
[1:44:36] but it's going to happen to your son so
[1:44:38] now the these these uh these people are
[1:44:44] raising up in a rebellion against
[1:44:46] rehoboam and the prophecy to jeroboam by
[1:44:50] the prophet ahija is come to pass and
[1:44:53] the ten tribes are now under the
[1:44:55] leadership of jeroboam
[1:44:58] and jeroboam listen now I want you to
[1:45:02] hear me
[1:45:03] jeroboam is now their leader
[1:45:07] but jeroboam is one of those that
[1:45:11] doesn't really care whether he's
[1:45:14] following all of The Commandments of God
[1:45:19] jeroboam was in the northern kingdom
[1:45:22] and jeroboam as he is into leadership to
[1:45:26] his ten tribes as the prophecy said he
[1:45:30] would be he now offers to the people a
[1:45:34] substitution
[1:45:40] he began to tell the people
[1:45:43] it's too much trouble
[1:45:46] for you to go down to Jerusalem because
[1:45:50] now remember
[1:45:51] the word of the Lord through Moses to
[1:45:55] the people of Israel was that they were
[1:45:57] to leave their homes no matter where it
[1:46:00] was in the nation of Israel and three
[1:46:03] times a year they were to go to
[1:46:06] Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts of the
[1:46:10] Lord
[1:46:11] not Jewish feasts the feasts of the Lord
[1:46:16] so three times a year these men would
[1:46:19] make this pilgrimage down to Jerusalem
[1:46:22] according to the word of the Lord but
[1:46:25] now jeroboam is in the place of
[1:46:28] authority and he doesn't want all of his
[1:46:33] people to go down there with the Holy
[1:46:36] Rollers
[1:46:38] jeroboam
[1:46:40] he says I you know it's just not
[1:46:44] convenient for you to go down there so
[1:46:47] I'm going to set up a temples in Dan and
[1:46:51] in Bethel and I'm going to make it so
[1:46:54] that it's a little bit easier for you to
[1:46:58] go and to Worship the Lord I'm going to
[1:47:01] make it a little bit more palatable for
[1:47:04] you
[1:47:05] uh I'm gonna make it a little bit more
[1:47:08] palatable than them screaming shouting
[1:47:11] tongue-speaking Acts 2 38 screaming
[1:47:14] youngins
[1:47:18] she don't want any of those whooping
[1:47:21] crying screaming amen and Hallelujah
[1:47:28] where did God say worship
[1:47:32] he said go to Jerusalem
[1:47:35] now I realize that rehoboam
[1:47:38] was under another spirit
[1:47:41] but it did not change the fact that God
[1:47:43] said I want you to go to Jerusalem to
[1:47:47] worship but jeroboam
[1:47:50] said I want to make it a little bit more
[1:47:53] palatable for you I want to make it a
[1:47:55] little bit easier for you you know you
[1:47:58] really don't have to have a new birth
[1:48:00] you really don't have to do all that
[1:48:04] crying you don't have to do all that
[1:48:06] speaking in tongues is it really
[1:48:09] necessary to be baptized in the name of
[1:48:12] Jesus Christ well if you want the Holy
[1:48:15] Ghost that's what it says it says that
[1:48:19] if you repent and you're baptized in the
[1:48:22] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:48:24] of your sins you shall receive the gift
[1:48:28] of the Holy Ghost and now you say well
[1:48:31] what about Matthew 28 19 well that's the
[1:48:35] name
[1:48:37] the name of the father and of the Son
[1:48:40] and the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus
[1:48:42] Christ that's his name so when you're
[1:48:45] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ you got the father you got the
[1:48:50] son you got the Holy Ghost and you shall
[1:48:54] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now I
[1:48:57] want you to know that baptism doesn't
[1:48:59] save you
[1:49:00] no
[1:49:02] baptism doesn't save you
[1:49:05] it doesn't even wash away your sins
[1:49:08] it is an outward sign that you have
[1:49:10] walked in obedience to the word of God
[1:49:12] and that you have repented of your sins
[1:49:14] and that you're really desirous to go
[1:49:17] with a further walk with God than just
[1:49:19] saying Lord I believe you
[1:49:24] so all of these
[1:49:27] people now they have
[1:49:29] places of substitution
[1:49:32] to go worship
[1:49:35] now through the years
[1:49:37] we have seen as churches have declined
[1:49:41] in their way of worship that they have
[1:49:44] uh changed their way of how they got
[1:49:48] church membership
[1:49:49] and it became a substitution as it did
[1:49:53] in Dan and Bethel because people were no
[1:49:57] longer willing to pay the price to go to
[1:49:59] Jerusalem just as people are no longer
[1:50:02] willing to pay the price for the new
[1:50:04] birth so they shake a preacher's hand or
[1:50:07] they confess an Apostles Creed or some
[1:50:11] Creed of some church somewhere rather
[1:50:13] than sticking with the word of God or
[1:50:16] they carry a certain book or they say
[1:50:18] they believe a prophet and they you know
[1:50:22] they they get this idea that if you
[1:50:24] believe a certain man you have the Holy
[1:50:26] Ghost
[1:50:27] but that doesn't work
[1:50:29] that is a substitution
[1:50:35] that is a Dan or a Bethel
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:41] now here is what I like would like to
[1:50:44] say
[1:50:47] those of you that don't understand our
[1:50:49] language just hold still we'll go
[1:50:51] somewhere a minute
[1:50:53] if we really believe a prophetic message
[1:51:00] and the spirit of Prophecy is at work in
[1:51:03] our lives
[1:51:05] wouldn't it stand to reason that we
[1:51:08] would obey what that prophecy said
[1:51:18] because
[1:51:20] the prophet that God sent in our time
[1:51:24] told us that this new birth
[1:51:27] would produce a change in our life
[1:51:31] and he said it would bring deliverances
[1:51:33] in our life and that it would bring
[1:51:35] shouting and that it would bring
[1:51:36] speaking in tongues and that it would
[1:51:38] bring rhythms in the spirit
[1:51:45] and when we get in the rhythm of the
[1:51:48] spirit
[1:51:50] and we don't try to rush things
[1:51:52] then God can do stuff that we don't even
[1:51:55] see
[1:52:05] now what is important for us to remember
[1:52:09] when all of the emotional stuff
[1:52:12] dissipates
[1:52:15] yeah it does
[1:52:17] you're not going to live on that high
[1:52:19] every day all day long
[1:52:22] your physical body could not handle it
[1:52:26] I'm here to tell you
[1:52:28] your physical body could not handle it
[1:52:30] that being said we're getting closer and
[1:52:34] closer as we take on more and more of
[1:52:37] the spirit of God that the molecules of
[1:52:40] this body are speeding up
[1:52:43] God and my theophany body is slowing
[1:52:46] down and one day there's just going to
[1:52:48] be a meeting in the middle and I'm going
[1:52:50] to join that new body
[1:52:52] so I want to get in his presence every
[1:52:54] time that I can I want that spirit of
[1:52:57] God to fall on me in such a way until
[1:53:00] that it is fire shut up in my bones that
[1:53:02] I don't know what to do with and I want
[1:53:04] it to take me higher and higher in the
[1:53:06] spirit of the Lord
[1:53:08] but when all of the emotion part has
[1:53:11] settled down
[1:53:13] come on I have to have word to stand on
[1:53:17] I have to
[1:53:21] because when Peter and the disciples
[1:53:24] were asked who do men say that I the son
[1:53:27] of man am
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:30] I well they said some say you're Elias
[1:53:33] and some say you're John the Baptists
[1:53:36] and some say you're this Prophet or
[1:53:38] you're this one
[1:53:40] Jesus says but who do you say that I the
[1:53:45] son of man am
[1:53:48] Peter answered Thou Art the Christ
[1:53:51] the son of the Living God
[1:53:56] Jesus responded to Peter and said Flesh
[1:53:59] and Blood did not reveal that to you
[1:54:02] but my Father which is in heaven has
[1:54:04] revealed this to you and Upon This Rock
[1:54:07] I will build my church and the Gates of
[1:54:11] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[1:54:14] now Jesus did not say that the gates or
[1:54:18] that that the gates of hell would not
[1:54:20] try
[1:54:21] oh
[1:54:22] he didn't say there wouldn't be War
[1:54:26] and that is why we here preach the
[1:54:29] importance of spirit and Truth
[1:54:33] amen because if all you do is ride
[1:54:35] around all week long on spirit
[1:54:39] the gates of hell are going to Prevail
[1:54:41] against that
[1:54:42] they're going to war against you that
[1:54:45] was an emotion that was just an emotion
[1:54:47] that was just an emotion
[1:54:48] but if you after you settle down a
[1:54:52] little bit
[1:54:53] don't settle down too much preacher
[1:54:55] needs you
[1:54:56] after you settle down some and you walk
[1:54:59] out that back door and all that that
[1:55:02] good high height of emotion kind of
[1:55:05] leaves you and the next day you face
[1:55:07] demon spirits
[1:55:10] you're not going to be able to point
[1:55:12] them back to the emotion
[1:55:14] you got to point them back to the word
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:17] you gotta Point them back to the word
[1:55:20] because upon that rock the rock of
[1:55:23] Revelation the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:55:27] what the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:55:30] against
[1:55:32] and when the enemy comes
[1:55:35] and he will come
[1:55:38] now you may feel like he comes like a
[1:55:40] flood
[1:55:42] but all when the spirit of the Lord
[1:55:44] comes and he rescues us he comes with a
[1:55:47] flood and his flood is bigger than the
[1:55:50] devil's flood
[1:55:57] now if you don't mind I'm going to take
[1:55:59] just another moment to be real political
[1:56:03] we have heard through the years
[1:56:05] that all of this is not necessary the
[1:56:08] spirit the emotions whatever you want to
[1:56:11] call it
[1:56:12] all the speaking in tongues
[1:56:15] all the gifts of the Spirit
[1:56:17] they're not really necessary we've got
[1:56:19] the word
[1:56:22] and they point us back to a quote
[1:56:24] of William Branham
[1:56:27] where he said how can I teach the people
[1:56:30] algebra
[1:56:32] when they won't learn their ABCs
[1:56:38] well I would like to inform somebody
[1:56:42] that
[1:56:44] I think I got the ABCs
[1:56:49] [Laughter]
[1:56:54] and I think it's about time we learn
[1:56:56] some algebra
[1:56:58] is that all right
[1:57:02] matter of fact I believe
[1:57:05] hear anyhow God has been gracious to be
[1:57:09] teaching us some algebra
[1:57:13] because
[1:57:15] the proper balance
[1:57:17] now once again everything has to come
[1:57:21] back and dovetail to the word of God
[1:57:24] because
[1:57:27] everything else is shifting sand
[1:57:32] God gave us this word the absolute for
[1:57:36] us to stand upon
[1:57:38] and
[1:57:40] I cannot begin to explain to you or
[1:57:43] figure out it has to be Supernatural how
[1:57:46] that this book
[1:57:49] this book is only so big
[1:57:52] and
[1:57:54] it is baffling to think
[1:57:57] that for hundreds of years
[1:58:00] preacher after preacher after preacher
[1:58:04] has taken this same book
[1:58:07] and it has continued to cause people to
[1:58:10] come and sit in situations like We Are
[1:58:13] Tonight to sit under the sound of the
[1:58:16] word because they realize that something
[1:58:19] is going to be revealed that is going to
[1:58:23] give us rapturing faith
[1:58:26] God is revealing the word piece by piece
[1:58:30] by piece to us because it is his desire
[1:58:33] to give us the rapturing faith that we
[1:58:36] need to make an exit out of here
[1:58:39] there's going to be some things that
[1:58:41] we're going to watch happen in the end
[1:58:43] time as we get closer to that day and
[1:58:46] we're gonna we're gonna start having
[1:58:48] appearances of those that were uh that
[1:58:50] are awakened up out of the ground before
[1:58:53] that we take our flight out of here
[1:58:55] we're going to have some reunion along
[1:58:57] the way maybe 30 to 40 days before the
[1:59:00] bride takes Rapture out of here just as
[1:59:02] it was when Jesus was on the earth and
[1:59:05] people started making appearances in
[1:59:07] Jerusalem people that had been dead for
[1:59:10] quite some time
[1:59:12] looking for it to happen friends
[1:59:17] now I'm trying to preach to you about
[1:59:19] prophecy
[1:59:22] now according to amos's prophecy
[1:59:25] the sword of the Lord would come to the
[1:59:29] house of jeroboam
[1:59:31] now I am Messiah the priest of Bethel he
[1:59:35] was a priest of false worship remember
[1:59:37] that and Messiah was a priest of false
[1:59:40] worship and he sends to jeroboam the
[1:59:43] king of Israel and he says
[1:59:46] Amos has conspired against you
[1:59:51] now this is what prophetic does
[1:59:56] because when it gets out of our comfort
[1:59:58] zone
[2:00:00] it starts stirring up the devils
[2:00:06] you didn't catch it that was a warning
[2:00:11] hear the spirit
[2:00:14] when the prophetic starts flowing
[2:00:17] it stirs up the devils
[2:00:21] now Amos prophesied
[2:00:23] to amaziah and he said he's just
[2:00:27] prophesies and amaziah hears it and he's
[2:00:29] a false priest and he doesn't want his
[2:00:32] little church Disturbed
[2:00:34] and so he sends to jeroboam
[2:00:38] and he says jeroboam Amos has conspired
[2:00:42] against you the house of Israel
[2:00:45] for thus says Amos jeroboam is going to
[2:00:49] die by the sword
[2:00:52] well that's kind of what it looked like
[2:00:56] but that ain't what he said
[2:00:59] the prophecy said the sword would come
[2:01:02] to the house of jeroboam
[2:01:06] now amaziah the false priest the priests
[2:01:09] of false worship is now stirring up
[2:01:12] trouble
[2:01:14] demons are now stirred up
[2:01:16] and amaziah
[2:01:18] comes to Amos and he says get out of my
[2:01:22] church
[2:01:23] foreign
[2:01:25] I think you just need to go down to
[2:01:27] Jerusalem down to Judah with that bunch
[2:01:30] of Holy Rollers because you're starting
[2:01:32] to act like them and we don't want you
[2:01:34] around here I don't want you to prophesy
[2:01:37] in my church ever again
[2:01:47] now I have felt Amos
[2:01:50] I have had those same words spoken to me
[2:01:54] in a church
[2:01:57] I have allowed the Lord to let all that
[2:01:59] fall behind me
[2:02:01] can't let it stop me because I realize
[2:02:04] when the prophetic starts moving it
[2:02:07] starts moving demon spirits
[2:02:12] so amaziah says I don't want you to
[2:02:14] prophesy in my church anymore
[2:02:19] so now
[2:02:21] we find that
[2:02:23] in First Kings 14
[2:02:26] jeroboam
[2:02:28] has a son that is on the brink of death
[2:02:33] and jeroboam tells his wife you feign
[2:02:35] yourself and you go to the prophet and
[2:02:37] find out whether our son is going to
[2:02:39] live
[2:02:41] jeroboam his wife comes back
[2:02:45] she's found out she can't hide from the
[2:02:47] prophet
[2:02:48] and she comes back and says no our son's
[2:02:50] going to die his the son dies
[2:02:52] and the Bible tells us that shortly
[2:02:54] thereafter
[2:02:55] jeroboam dies
[2:02:58] there is no wording that he was slain
[2:03:02] that he was taken out by a sword it just
[2:03:06] says that he died
[2:03:08] now we can also find in second
[2:03:10] Chronicles chapter 13 where that the the
[2:03:15] leadership in Judah has changed to
[2:03:18] abijah abijah is now the leader in Judah
[2:03:21] and jeroboam is still the leader in
[2:03:24] Israel but the Bible says that God smote
[2:03:28] jeroboam
[2:03:29] doesn't say that somebody smote him with
[2:03:31] the sword it says that God smote him he
[2:03:35] did not recover the Lord struck him and
[2:03:39] he died
[2:03:41] now everybody stands back and says Amos
[2:03:44] is a false prophet
[2:03:50] Amos is a false prophet
[2:03:53] he's a false prophet
[2:03:58] why did they say Amos was a false
[2:04:01] prophet now you got to remember that
[2:04:03] demon Spirits are stirred up
[2:04:07] they've been stirred up
[2:04:09] and when demon Spirits get stirred up
[2:04:13] that Spirit of Leviathan starts twisting
[2:04:16] things
[2:04:18] and by the time that it goes from The
[2:04:21] Prophet's words to our ears the enemy is
[2:04:25] trying to bring curvature to it he's
[2:04:28] trying to pull it away from the Plumb
[2:04:31] line Revelation he is trying to pull it
[2:04:34] away from the Plumb line and he's trying
[2:04:37] to put his own twist on it because he is
[2:04:41] still trying to build a kingdom
[2:04:44] close yet
[2:04:46] when Satan was kicked out of heaven he
[2:04:49] did not quit trying to build a kingdom
[2:04:52] will try in tonight
[2:04:55] and when
[2:04:57] Amos prophesied he said the sword is
[2:05:01] coming to jeroboam's house
[2:05:04] amaziah starts passing along
[2:05:09] that Amos is after jeroboam
[2:05:13] that wasn't the word at all
[2:05:16] Amos had really nothing to do it except
[2:05:18] to deliver the word of the Lord
[2:05:21] so now jeroboam Falls dead
[2:05:24] he expires there is no sword to take off
[2:05:27] his head
[2:05:29] he was not slain
[2:05:31] but the Bible says he did not recover
[2:05:35] and he died
[2:05:37] and there was another one that came that
[2:05:39] Amos was declared a false prophet and
[2:05:42] not until jeroboam died and his son
[2:05:45] Zechariah took his place then the sword
[2:05:49] came against the house of jeroboam
[2:05:52] Zechariah was slain by shalom
[2:05:55] and the word of the Lord by Amos was
[2:05:58] fulfilled against the house of jeroboam
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:06] do not allow the enemy
[2:06:10] to cause you to throw away the word of
[2:06:14] the Lord because that you are trying to
[2:06:18] put your own interpretation
[2:06:21] on the word of the Lord
[2:06:26] when Zechariah jeroboam's son was slain
[2:06:31] jeroboam's dynasty was done
[2:06:34] it went to another Dynasty
[2:06:36] went to another house
[2:06:38] God was finished with him
[2:06:40] so now we see by the scripture
[2:06:43] that there was a prophecy that went
[2:06:45] forth
[2:06:47] and
[2:06:48] people misinterpreted it
[2:06:51] there were demon Spirits stirred up that
[2:06:53] caused the word to be misconstrued to be
[2:06:57] falsified to even kick people out of
[2:07:00] church because they didn't want him
[2:07:02] around any longer it was all of that
[2:07:04] kind of stuff that gets stirred up
[2:07:08] foreign
[2:07:10] case you haven't figured it out
[2:07:13] this is a prophetic Church
[2:07:16] and Demon Spirits get stirred up
[2:07:18] frequently
[2:07:24] be mindful that the devil as a roaring
[2:07:27] lion
[2:07:28] is constantly
[2:07:30] going around
[2:07:33] seeking whom he may devour
[2:07:36] trying to find someone who has tried to
[2:07:39] live off only emotion
[2:07:41] and never got rooted in the word
[2:07:45] so when the emotion is gone
[2:07:49] all they have
[2:07:51] is nothing
[2:07:53] but a twisted
[2:07:55] idea
[2:07:57] that they have formulated because the
[2:08:00] enemy has got it
[2:08:01] now friends this is not a new idea
[2:08:05] this started way way way way way way way
[2:08:07] back in the Garden of Eden
[2:08:12] because when
[2:08:14] he got kicked out of heaven
[2:08:18] into the Earth
[2:08:20] he was looking for something to get in
[2:08:23] and he's still looking for something to
[2:08:25] get in today
[2:08:27] he's looking for a mind
[2:08:30] he's looking for a mind that he can
[2:08:32] corrupt
[2:08:33] he's looking for a mind that he can
[2:08:35] defile
[2:08:37] he's looking for some way that he can
[2:08:40] distort the word of God
[2:08:44] that's all he did in the Garden of Eden
[2:08:46] he distorted the word
[2:08:48] she said God told us that we weren't
[2:08:50] supposed to partake of that tree
[2:08:54] surely not
[2:08:57] surely not
[2:09:01] just a distortion
[2:09:06] just a distortion
[2:09:09] and that's what what the enemy is trying
[2:09:12] to do to you and to me and to anybody
[2:09:14] else
[2:09:16] he is trying to do it to any human being
[2:09:19] in the Earth because if he can distort
[2:09:22] the word
[2:09:24] and prolong any season
[2:09:29] he will attempt to do it
[2:09:38] Amos
[2:09:40] get out of my church
[2:09:42] I don't want you here
[2:09:44] don't want your prophecy
[2:09:46] now I would just like to briefly touch
[2:09:48] on Abraham
[2:09:51] because this is another instance of how
[2:09:54] the enemy tries to
[2:09:56] deflect the word of God
[2:09:59] from coming to us in its power
[2:10:05] I remind you that Amos was a human being
[2:10:11] every Prophet that has ever been on the
[2:10:13] Earth has been a human being just as our
[2:10:15] Apostles just as our pastors as our
[2:10:18] evangelists as our teachers a human
[2:10:19] being
[2:10:21] Abraham was called by God God said
[2:10:25] Abraham I want you to get up and get out
[2:10:28] of this land
[2:10:30] get up and get out of this land
[2:10:34] and
[2:10:36] at that time his name was Abram you know
[2:10:39] and his wife Sarai
[2:10:41] but he told him get out of this land
[2:10:43] Abraham obeyed him
[2:10:46] but in Genesis 12
[2:10:48] it tells us that there were some things
[2:10:51] in the earth that were transpiring and
[2:10:53] Abraham went down to Egypt
[2:10:56] when Abraham when Abram went down to
[2:10:59] Egypt
[2:11:01] he knew that Pharaoh was going to want
[2:11:06] his wife because she was beautiful
[2:11:10] and he
[2:11:12] told Sarai he said all you got to do is
[2:11:16] tell him
[2:11:19] you're my sister
[2:11:22] I'm your brother
[2:11:25] so now
[2:11:27] we can either call it a lie a half lie
[2:11:32] untruth part truth
[2:11:38] can call it what you want
[2:11:42] but it
[2:11:44] conveyed to pharaoh
[2:11:46] that she was available
[2:11:49] and she wasn't
[2:11:52] she was a married woman
[2:11:55] carrying a promise
[2:11:59] but Abraham didn't want to be killed
[2:12:02] you know
[2:12:05] and so
[2:12:08] God came and he let plagues come upon
[2:12:13] Pharaoh's house
[2:12:16] and
[2:12:19] she was let go
[2:12:22] now I just ask you a simple question who
[2:12:25] did the deceiving
[2:12:31] sir I played along but Abraham was the
[2:12:34] one that
[2:12:36] you know
[2:12:39] hold on to that
[2:12:41] Genesis chapter 20.
[2:12:45] after their names had been changed
[2:12:50] El Shaddai had come
[2:12:52] and breathed into them the Breath of
[2:12:55] Life
[2:12:57] they go down to gurar
[2:13:02] now folks
[2:13:05] Abraham
[2:13:07] it's near a hundred
[2:13:11] Sarah was near 90.
[2:13:14] but she was
[2:13:16] that Breath of God that was breathed
[2:13:20] into her did something Supernatural for
[2:13:22] her
[2:13:23] because when they went into gorar once
[2:13:27] again Abraham tells his wife
[2:13:31] is going to want you
[2:13:33] and I want you to just tell him
[2:13:36] you know you would think he'd learn
[2:13:41] you tried to Sly once
[2:13:45] but he didn't want to die
[2:13:47] he knew that a Bible that could kill him
[2:13:50] so he told her
[2:13:51] just say you're my sister
[2:13:55] so
[2:13:58] she indeed does that
[2:14:02] and
[2:14:05] this time
[2:14:07] God Appears to abimelech
[2:14:10] in a dream
[2:14:12] and says buddy you are as good as dead
[2:14:17] if you don't restore this woman to her
[2:14:20] husband
[2:14:22] well he starts throwing up his hands in
[2:14:25] surrender and says wait a minute
[2:14:28] wait just a minute
[2:14:31] I wasn't the one that did the deceiving
[2:14:35] out of the Integrity of my heart I took
[2:14:38] her they said that was his sister
[2:14:42] wait just a minute
[2:14:46] did God change his mind about Abraham
[2:14:49] because that abimelech starts offering
[2:14:52] him excuses as to why that he's taken
[2:14:54] Sarah
[2:14:56] not at all
[2:14:59] but what did God do
[2:15:01] he says I want you to restore that man's
[2:15:04] wife to him and you let him pray for you
[2:15:07] because he is my
[2:15:16] wait a minute
[2:15:19] wait a minute
[2:15:21] profit
[2:15:23] you're telling me that man lied and he's
[2:15:26] God's prophet
[2:15:28] wait just a minute
[2:15:36] I would like to inform you tonight
[2:15:38] that no matter your opinion of what
[2:15:40] Abraham did
[2:15:42] either time
[2:15:44] the calling of God was upon him
[2:15:47] he was a human being from day one
[2:15:51] but the calling of God upon his life was
[2:15:54] put there by a supernatural means
[2:15:57] Abraham did not go to the hardware store
[2:15:59] and buy it
[2:16:02] the Bible tells us that gifts and
[2:16:04] callings of God are without repentance
[2:16:08] but I sure do thank God for every man of
[2:16:10] God every one of a woman of God who
[2:16:12] keeps their lives in a state of
[2:16:14] repentance
[2:16:16] so that they can utter the word of God
[2:16:19] and we don't have to wonder today if
[2:16:21] there's still dollopin out here and some
[2:16:23] sin somewhere
[2:16:25] seen plenty of them
[2:16:29] they came in with an air about them
[2:16:33] and they had a genuine gift
[2:16:36] I'm not taken away from the gift at all
[2:16:39] we have seen marvelous gifts work Among
[2:16:43] Us
[2:16:45] but after some time the man started
[2:16:48] showing through
[2:16:51] the gift never left him
[2:16:54] kept on prophesying kept on seeing in
[2:16:58] the spirit gift never left him
[2:17:00] but his life did not reflect amen the
[2:17:04] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:07] now I want you not to worry about
[2:17:09] Abraham because God got him back in line
[2:17:14] and he will get every servant of the
[2:17:16] Lord back in line if they will live in a
[2:17:18] state of repentance
[2:17:21] and our bridal inheritance part of it is
[2:17:23] that it doesn't take three days to
[2:17:25] repent no come on
[2:17:28] that's right
[2:17:30] now it may take some time on that
[2:17:32] initial
[2:17:33] when we first get saved and we got a lot
[2:17:35] to unload
[2:17:38] it may be
[2:17:42] but after we've been serving the lord
[2:17:44] for a while it is not our desire to mess
[2:17:47] up
[2:17:48] and when we mess up all we have to do is
[2:17:51] simply come back to God and say Lord I
[2:17:54] messed up
[2:17:55] because I'm just enough Baptist to
[2:17:58] believe
[2:17:59] that when I got saved once
[2:18:02] God didn't come to take it away
[2:18:06] and I couldn't mess up bad enough to
[2:18:08] take it away
[2:18:10] because the blood of Jesus Christ is
[2:18:13] still on the throne
[2:18:15] and My Sacrifice tonight is still good
[2:18:18] enough
[2:18:20] more than good enough it is perfect
[2:18:22] and all I have to
[2:18:26] have to obtain mercy and say papa I
[2:18:29] messed up again
[2:18:31] would you please forgive me
[2:18:34] now I think I said last night that
[2:18:36] doesn't give us license to just uh live
[2:18:39] a life of sin and say oh I repented and
[2:18:42] go back and do the same besetting sins
[2:18:44] over and over again no way
[2:18:48] the desire of a real True Believer is to
[2:18:51] get that stuff out of our life
[2:18:53] and when God reveals it to come to Papa
[2:18:56] and say I gotta be rid of that
[2:19:01] I yield to you I find myself saying that
[2:19:04] more and more to the Lord Lord
[2:19:08] I yield to you
[2:19:10] tired of saying no I did that enough of
[2:19:13] my life saying no God don't you know
[2:19:16] that the fool has said in his heart no
[2:19:18] God
[2:19:20] it's really what it says
[2:19:23] there is is italicized
[2:19:25] you can read it that way that's fine
[2:19:27] it's the way the King James reads but
[2:19:29] really the fool says no God
[2:19:34] no
[2:19:36] I lived a lot of my life that way
[2:19:38] and I found out it's a whole lot better
[2:19:40] for me and a whole lot easier for me to
[2:19:43] receive Revelation from the Lord if I
[2:19:45] just keep saying yes Lord yes Lord yes
[2:19:49] Lord
[2:19:53] so we
[2:19:54] recognize through the scripture
[2:19:57] James 5 17 in the Amplified says Elijah
[2:20:02] was a human being Elijah was a prophet
[2:20:06] Elijah was a human being
[2:20:08] with a nature such as we have
[2:20:12] with feelings
[2:20:14] affections
[2:20:16] and a constitution like ours
[2:20:19] and he prayed earnestly for it not to
[2:20:21] Reign and no rain fell on the earth for
[2:20:23] three years and six months
[2:20:26] Elijah was a prophet called by God to
[2:20:30] speak the word of the Lord over the land
[2:20:32] of Israel and the Bible says he prayed
[2:20:34] earnestly for it not to Reign and no
[2:20:36] rain fell but it also tells us that
[2:20:38] Elijah was a human being he had a nature
[2:20:40] like we have he probably got mad he
[2:20:43] probably uh you know he was just flawed
[2:20:45] that's all there is to it he had
[2:20:47] Hang-Ups he had faults
[2:20:49] probably had family issues
[2:20:52] just as any other human being
[2:20:56] but the fact remains that the calling of
[2:20:59] God was upon his life
[2:21:03] I hope you're listening to me
[2:21:06] the call of God was upon his life
[2:21:10] now you remember I'm going to call the
[2:21:13] musicians and I want you to come but do
[2:21:14] it quietly
[2:21:15] as as
[2:21:17] we have gone through all of this tonight
[2:21:21] I've tried to make sure that you
[2:21:24] understand that every emotion that we
[2:21:26] have
[2:21:27] we're just human beings and we express
[2:21:30] ourselves differently
[2:21:34] and
[2:21:36] sometimes there are emotions that we
[2:21:39] don't understand
[2:21:42] and groanings in the spirit that we
[2:21:45] don't understand
[2:21:47] when we pray for people as I said the
[2:21:49] other night we allow the spirit of the
[2:21:51] Lord to pray over you in tongues because
[2:21:54] we don't want our opinion to get mixed
[2:21:57] up in what Deliverance you need
[2:22:00] because there are uh let's just say it
[2:22:04] again we're human
[2:22:07] every servant of God whether it be man
[2:22:09] or woman that would pray over you that
[2:22:12] may or may not know you they're human
[2:22:14] and they can watch people and they can
[2:22:17] see the attributes of a human being and
[2:22:20] they can start speaking over you in
[2:22:22] prayer and it could not be what you need
[2:22:24] at all
[2:22:26] right but if he
[2:22:28] the spirit of truth will come and will
[2:22:32] yield to him and let him do the praying
[2:22:34] through our mouth
[2:22:36] we're just his mouthpieces we'll let him
[2:22:39] pray through us over you and it can
[2:22:42] bypass our intellect bypass our opinion
[2:22:46] and let the Holy Spirit do in you what
[2:22:49] we can't do for you
[2:22:52] you can't even do for yourself but the
[2:22:55] Holy Spirit can do it for you if you
[2:22:59] will just simply yield
[2:23:04] I can't yield for you
[2:23:06] but Shelley can't yield for you your
[2:23:09] mama can't yield for you brother Daniel
[2:23:11] can't you nobody can yield for you you
[2:23:14] have to yield your own self
[2:23:18] foreign
[2:23:23] to you saying can I believe the word
[2:23:27] that I'm hearing
[2:23:31] can I believe the word that I'm hearing
[2:23:36] now this preacher told me
[2:23:39] that if I
[2:23:41] will repent
[2:23:44] and if I'll be baptized in the name of
[2:23:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:23:50] he told me that I could receive
[2:23:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:57] now
[2:23:59] he pointed out to me
[2:24:02] that that is in the book of Acts in
[2:24:04] chapter 2 verse 38 I can see it in the
[2:24:09] word so now it is my responsibility
[2:24:14] to connect my faith with the word that I
[2:24:17] have heard I believe it I see it in the
[2:24:21] word I'm told by the preachers that I
[2:24:24] can stand on the word I'm told that the
[2:24:27] word says Heaven and Earth will pass
[2:24:29] away but the word of God abides forever
[2:24:32] and so I'm going to stand on that word
[2:24:35] if I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:38] I have something to stand on
[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:43] will it come with emotion oh it probably
[2:24:47] will sometime or another
[2:24:50] what it'll look like I have no idea what
[2:24:52] it'll look like for you
[2:24:55] I could try to tell you what it looked
[2:24:57] like for me
[2:24:58] it's not necessary tonight
[2:25:01] you can watch me sometimes it's still
[2:25:03] have an effect
[2:25:05] the Holy Ghost is still have an effect
[2:25:08] I still I I still let him come and get a
[2:25:12] hold of me and do what he wants to do
[2:25:15] but now I would like to finish up
[2:25:18] with a scripture found in Matthew
[2:25:20] chapter 10.
[2:25:21] because I believe that this is very
[2:25:23] important as we are
[2:25:27] going in we are we are
[2:25:31] transisting now into the rest of this
[2:25:33] camp meeting I believe God is going to
[2:25:35] do something profound Supernatural I
[2:25:39] believe he's going to do something
[2:25:40] Supernatural tonight I'm not putting it
[2:25:42] off I believe that he's already been
[2:25:44] doing Supernatural things but I I really
[2:25:47] want us to understand the significance
[2:25:50] of hearing the prophetic word of God
[2:25:54] hearing a word in due season and not
[2:25:57] only hearing it but how we hear it how
[2:25:59] we receive it
[2:26:01] uh Matthew chapter 10 and verse 40.
[2:26:12] receiveth you
[2:26:14] receiveth me
[2:26:16] this is Jesus speaking and he's letting
[2:26:19] the disciples know that if people
[2:26:21] receive them
[2:26:24] carrying his message
[2:26:27] that they are in essence receiving him
[2:26:31] and he that receiveth me
[2:26:34] [Music]
[2:26:35] receiveth him that sent me he is helping
[2:26:39] them to recognize that he is the
[2:26:42] embodiment of the father dwelling in a
[2:26:46] body on the earth the Bible said that he
[2:26:49] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:26:52] in a body he was on the Earth but he is
[2:26:56] carrying out a a mandate from Papa and
[2:27:00] he says when they receive you they're
[2:27:03] receiving me and when they receive me
[2:27:07] they're going above and beyond me
[2:27:09] they're going all the way back to the
[2:27:11] Ancient of Days they're going back to
[2:27:13] Creator they're going back to Papa and
[2:27:16] they're receiving him
[2:27:18] verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet
[2:27:23] in the name of a prophet
[2:27:26] shall receive a prophet's reward
[2:27:33] now I'm going to get plain here and
[2:27:35] change the wording
[2:27:41] and you'll have to figure out the rest
[2:27:44] of the story
[2:27:51] he
[2:27:53] that receiveth
[2:27:55] a prophet
[2:27:57] in the name of a pastor
[2:28:01] will not receive a prophet's reward
[2:28:09] I know that's strong meat but I want you
[2:28:12] to listen to me
[2:28:16] he that receiveth a prophet
[2:28:20] in the name of an evangelist
[2:28:23] will not receive a prophet's reward
[2:28:28] he that receiveth the prophet in the
[2:28:31] name of a teacher will not
[2:28:35] report
[2:28:36] why is that because you're not really
[2:28:39] putting the proper calling on the
[2:28:42] servant of the Lord
[2:28:43] [Music]
[2:28:45] you're lessening
[2:28:48] the gifting that is in them
[2:28:51] and so you are not receiving the full
[2:28:54] cup of blessing that would come
[2:28:57] if you would receive a prophet in the
[2:29:01] name of a prophet then you get the
[2:29:04] prophet's reward
[2:29:07] he that receiveth a righteous man
[2:29:10] in the name of a righteous man
[2:29:13] shall receive a righteous man's reward
[2:29:17] now
[2:29:19] this can go to any calling that we place
[2:29:23] in there I believe
[2:29:25] because
[2:29:27] if
[2:29:31] a man comes here and he's placed as a
[2:29:34] pastor
[2:29:36] and you receive him only as another
[2:29:39] preacher
[2:29:43] you don't get the full reward of the
[2:29:45] calling that's in his life
[2:29:53] but if you will allow the spirit of God
[2:29:57] to just work inside of you and say Lord
[2:30:01] I may not understand fully the calling
[2:30:04] on this one or that one or the other one
[2:30:05] I may not understand the calling that is
[2:30:08] on the that certain preacher's life I
[2:30:11] may not understand it but I'm asking you
[2:30:14] to help me to understand it so that I
[2:30:17] can get the full benefit of the gift
[2:30:20] that he carries so that I don't miss
[2:30:22] anything that God has for me
[2:30:25] beautiful
[2:30:28] because when a when a prophet comes
[2:30:31] Among Us
[2:30:32] to deliver the word of the Lord if we
[2:30:36] will we can step up another notch
[2:30:39] amen
[2:30:42] and I am one who wants to go up another
[2:30:44] notch
[2:30:46] because I believe that there's more for
[2:30:48] the Bride of Jesus Christ to have in
[2:30:50] this end time than there ever has been
[2:30:52] before I believe that there are things
[2:30:54] that are coming to us that that we may
[2:30:57] not have heard in past times and and I
[2:31:00] just was reading today uh something that
[2:31:03] had been said here some years ago that
[2:31:05] we may see some things that do not look
[2:31:08] like past revivals
[2:31:10] they may not look like what we've seen
[2:31:12] in history but God is Not confined to
[2:31:15] history
[2:31:17] but it does all have to come back and
[2:31:19] line up right here in the Plumb line
[2:31:22] you may not be able to give me chapter
[2:31:24] and verse with it but it has to have its
[2:31:27] Essence right here in this book it has
[2:31:30] to lay right in the pages of this
[2:31:34] and God has sent
[2:31:36] not future tense God has sent I believe
[2:31:40] a Plumb line word
[2:31:43] that every other word has to measure up
[2:31:46] against
[2:31:49] I believe that God sent it to us
[2:31:52] and that we have a responsibility to say
[2:31:55] Lord
[2:31:56] I receive what you have for me I receive
[2:32:01] that you would speak into me everything
[2:32:05] that the Holy Spirit
[2:32:08] would come and speak to us in this house
[2:32:16] I want to tell you
[2:32:19] that I am so grateful to you
[2:32:22] for the pool that you have had for the
[2:32:25] word of God
[2:32:27] in these last four Services I appreciate
[2:32:30] it so very much
[2:32:32] but I want to tell you tonight
[2:32:35] hear the spirit
[2:32:37] things are about to shift
[2:32:41] about to shift
[2:32:42] let's stand to our feet tonight
[2:32:47] and I want Benjamin to lead us in some
[2:32:49] worship but before he does
[2:32:51] I want us to just sing a course of that
[2:32:54] song that reverberated through a past
[2:32:57] Revival and I want you if you're willing
[2:33:00] I want you to sing Lord
[2:33:03] I believe and Lord I receive
[2:33:08] D could you give us a quart of that
[2:33:10] please Lord
[2:33:13] Lord I believe d
[2:33:19] Lord I believe foreign
[2:33:32] [Music]

[2:34:28] Lord I receive leave
[2:34:33] all things are possible
[2:34:39] Lord I
[2:34:43] now if you really believe the word of
[2:34:45] the Lord tonight if you agree
[2:34:48] I want you to signify that you believe
[2:34:51] in that you receive and we're going to
[2:34:53] sing it one more time and I want you to
[2:34:55] lift your hands not half-heartedly
[2:34:58] I want you to say Lord I agree with the
[2:35:02] word of the Lord and I am setting my
[2:35:05] heart and mind for this shift that is
[2:35:07] coming that is about to transpire
[2:35:09] because I don't want to miss one single
[2:35:12] thing that you're going to say to this
[2:35:14] church
[2:35:14] Lord I receive
[2:35:19] for
[2:35:21] Lord I receive
[2:35:25] D

[2:35:32] Lord I
[2:35:35] received oh Lord

[2:35:55] Lord I receive now Lord as we stand here
[2:36:00] with our hands in the air
[2:36:02] signifying that we surrender to your
[2:36:04] will and plan
[2:36:06] and we receive the word of the Lord that
[2:36:08] has been spoken tonight that you have a
[2:36:12] voice that you want us to hear and God
[2:36:15] it originates in the heavenlies and that
[2:36:18] you chose a mouthpiece to speak that to
[2:36:20] us and we're just entering into that
[2:36:23] right now in the name of Jesus Christ I
[2:36:26] decree over this congregation those that
[2:36:29] are pulling those that are pressing in
[2:36:31] those that agree with what you're
[2:36:33] speaking and I decree over them that
[2:36:36] they will hear the word of the Lord and
[2:36:39] that we will not miss anything that the
[2:36:42] spirit of the Lord would say unto the
[2:36:45] church in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:36:47] Christ God all glory belongs to you all
[2:36:51] praise belongs to you and we are
[2:36:54] entering in now once again to praise you
[2:36:57] for the word of the Lord that we have
[2:37:00] heard tonight last night in previous
[2:37:03] days and weeks and years Lord been
[2:37:06] faithful to feed us
[2:37:09] you've been faithful to feed us Lord
