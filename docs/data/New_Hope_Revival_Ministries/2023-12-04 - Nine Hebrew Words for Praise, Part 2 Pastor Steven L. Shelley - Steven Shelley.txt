go there this morning brother gy would you just help our sister to her seat Psalm 95 beginning in verse one we are so thankful that you are here today we are so thankful for what the Lord has done for us he has been in our midst and we have so much to praise him for we have so much to thank him for and I want to thank every one of you who have made a sacrifice to be here today many of you have come from far away places and we are so thankful so very thankful our Brethren from Indiana Drove all night long they left what 11:00 or something 12:00 midnight and drove all the way to get here for our fellowship yesterday and our service last night and our fellowship after the service and to be here today and we'll leave this afternoon many of them going all the way back to Indiana some some going to Florida different places but we're a family the Lord has given us a family in Indiana and we are so thankful for that but you that have come from other places you have blessed us this young brother who's come in today uh I don't know you but I'm so glad you're here brother God bless you I don't mind I love for people to come and visit but what I really like is when someone comes in to praise the Lord you know sometimes visitors when they come to a place that they're not familiar with even I was thinking about brother Kade you know they're reserved they don't know it's a strange place and I have to be honest we're some of the strangest people I've ever met in my life I've never met any more strange folks than us and you come into a place like that you think you'd be a little you know be a little backward but our brother when he came in today he went right into praising the Lord and worshiping the Lord and that's what we're about that's what this is this is a house of worship a house of praise a house where the word of God can be preached and without apology we we're not going to apologize for the way we do it here you do it your way at your place but you come here expect us to do it what the way God has directed us and let us you're you're giving thank you for your giving I want to thank this congregation for the food that you have prepared for us two times already and this afternoon when the service is over we will uh go and get our our dishes our food for the local congregation and we will meet at the fellowship hall I'm hoping that they'll get the address and put it up at the end of the service for people to plug it in their GPS but we will meet at the fellowship uh Hall they call it the dwelling and it is behind the Auburn Heights Baptist church and they have been gracious enough to to rent us their hall for today and uh we are going there to have our lunch together and our fellowship but oh my nothing that we're going to experience over there could even begin to compare with what we have felt in the meeting so let's get to it Psalm 95 beginning in verse one oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us make a a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms isn't that what we've been doing for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the Hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker Barack we talked about it last night for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if ye will how many of you want to hear his voice today Father we are come with with Full Hearts of adoration and praise for who you are we are thankful that you have sent a message to gather us together as a Clarion call as a an eagle scream in these last days we are not ashamed to be identified with your message of Truth we thank you for sending it we thank you for your servant that surrendered his life to bring us this great truth that has its foundation in the scripture we are gathered here from various places had it not been for you we would have never known one another we have never would have never met one another perhaps but because of you you have ordered our footsteps you have directed our paths and you are building us up together as a habitation as a house of the Lord and we thank you for that we know you don't dwell in a building made with hands you dwell in the hearts and in the lives of your people and we thank you for that as we approach your word today would you whisper to us would you speak to us Lord in a profound way that we might go forth encouraged to bless your name encouraged to praise you as never before and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen amen you may be seated we are speaking last night and again today on nine Hebrew through words for praise we dedicated the preaching part of the month of November for Thanksgiving and praise and we focused on that as we have often done through the years I thought we would be finished with that theme and moved on to something else come the first part of December but we have a few more lessons in this we want to understand from God's word that praise is in order amen amen it's in order it may not be man's order but it's Bible order amen I I noticed as I mentioned last night some of the comments on social media when they see our reals and uh we have I don't know I think together if you added the two platforms together about 250,000 views and I don't know how many comments and how many thousands of likes and and uh you you find that some people just don't appreciate the way you all praise the Lord and some people think you're just getting out of order in God's house and they want you to be more ecclesiastical does that appeal to anybody uh uh they they want us to wear vestments you know uh even some on there have been calling us to the to the Holy Catholic Church they they even posted on there and said if you want to understand real worship you need to come to the Catholic church and you know what I'd like to say but I want to be kind we're not interested in worship in Saints we know God doesn't have a mother we're not interested in worshiping Mary or praying to the apostles we're interested in worshiping God I'm amazed at how many people don't understand that praise and worship is a part of the scripture both Old Testament and New Testament and so today we look at the sixth Hebrew word for praise if you'll put that up for us it is toila toila it appears 57 times in the Old Testament toila means adoration usually translated praise Or Glory tahila is derived from the word Halal do you remember that one from Hallelujah meaning the singing of halals or the singing of praises to sing or to Lad perceive to involve music especially singing hymns of the spirit or praise this and the word zamar that we talked about last night the plucking of the strings of the instruments are where we get the idea that singing is a part of Praise I want you to know singing is not all there is to praise you don't have to be singing to be praising but one of the ways that the Bible tells us to praise the Lord is by singing somebody said but I can't carry a tune in a bucket you know God's not interested in that he said Make a Joyful Noise can anybody make a Joyful Noise a and you can sing in the shower everybody can sing in the shower you can feel like a legend in the shower nobody is there to judge your highs and lows your octaves your Doras solos and and you just sing like a rock star and I don't mean that you know I'm being when when Cade brother Cade from North Carolina originally from Indiana when he was out here this morning running over his song I don't know him well uh but he is visiting from a sister church and uh I I heard them little tickling you know Jonathan we're used to that tickling of the of the ivies and he came back there to the back and with the straightest face that I could find I said brother you're going to have to hold that down a little bit we don't do rock and roll around here little bit of the color drained from his face and and I said and they and the the rest of the gang said he's just kidding and so I went over to the app and I played the song off of our church app that I recorded in the '90s singing the song that he sung today my offing and Otis Forest is I mean he is really getting the keys of the piano I remember when that came out and I remember what a stir it caused among our ranks they thought for sure that we had gone to rock and roll but I want you to know when the anointing Falls I remember Otis Forest he's gone to be with the Lord now but he was a a great producer in Nashville and when he finished playing for me the Holy Ghost you'll see him on Gaither videos playing the piano a time or two and when he got through playing for me the Holy Ghost will set your feet of dancing and by the way brother Billy Paul brandham had sent me a letter that I have and he said brother Shelly I want some of those tapes to give away as at Christmas time he said my favorite song is the Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing brother vom's oldest son and when when Otis Forest got through playing that he literally shook his hands like that and he said it felt like fire in my fingers uhhuh he said I haven't felt anything like that so when we begin to sing to the Lord when we begin to praise to the Lord when we begin to use what he has given us to praise him isn't it beautiful that he will pour His Spirit on it and he will anoint us to praise boy that is that that is so amazing to me here the Bible calls us to make a sacrifice of praise so we bring what little bit we have and what does God do he pours oil on it and he said I want to increase that I want to anoint that I don't only want to receive that for myself but I want the glory of that to spill over on somebody else last night when we were I think it was last night when it was time to go through the line and after the service and we called the visitors this little brother right here Isaac is that no what is your name brother Isaac uh I said you all go ahead go ahead go through the he said well you know I found out sometime that it just takes somebody going ahead just just kind of leading the way and then everybody I said go right ahead that's right you know it's the same way sometimes with worship and praise you just get one loose horse in the house on you you just get one in the house that's so glad to be out of the barn you see look around this room some of us spent many years in the denominational barn with everybody trying to calm us down trying to get us to act dignified and act quiet and show a little more Church order and show a little more reverence be a be a little more sacred they call it but you know when you finally get out of the barn and you get out from under the Bishop's watchful eye you ask some of these former Amish you get out from under the Bishop's watchful eye and you get into a place where you can praise God the way Way You Want To Praise Him you wouldn't ever want to go back and be locked up in some system come on now because what we find out is that praise breaks through the darkness it opens up the Heavens over our lives the Hebrew word is arabah I will open the windows I will open the slle gates of heaven and pour you out a blessing that you don't have room enough to contain when you seow your praise to the heavens you feel the spiritual clouds and how many of you know when the clouds get so full of moisture they can't contain it anymore how many of you know what begins to happen it's beginning to [Music] rain hear the voice of the father it begins to rain because the spiritual clouds can't hold the seed that you've been sending up in your praise you'll watch God unlock doors for you you'll see God open up boxes for you you'll see him set you free shackles will fall off somebody said we we don't need prayer lines well I think we do need prayer lines sometime but I'll tell you what I believe the ideal way is for you and I to create an atmosphere of God's praise and glory in this house so that while you're standing there or sitting there on your seat your faith gets anointed and your faith reaches up and takes a hold of God's promise to your life and you leave here having the fruit of what you believed for how many of you believe it ought to work that way I believe the Holy Ghost was telling us today we have authority in our mouth and we can speak to the situation somebody said that sounds a little bit too modern for me or it sounds a little new AG for me it sounds like the Bible to me it's all in the spoken word it's letting that word go go forth do you know when you declare the promises of God you are prophesying and the spirit of God wants to meet that prophecy do you know we have been holding back so long and limiting God so long that we don't even really realize what he's capable of he's bigger he's bigger than what we realize sometime so this word this word is a a word that is an imperative some to praise Jehovah God it can be in a Psalm or a hymn it can be with choirs it can be with dancing it can even be with expressive speaking this word tahila can also mean expressive speaking speaking under inspiration now when brother brandham was teaching us about the gifts of the Spirit and he was talking about the interpretation of tongues one of the things that he told us is this it will not just be the quoting of a scripture we don't need the spirit of God to requote the scripture to us because the word is forever hid in our heart so there are times that you will hear someone even in this house give a a a word of uh of for instance what we heard this morning a reminder I am that I am that's not interpretation of tongues it's not even really qualified as prophecy but what it is is an expressive inspired word that boils up in the heart of a Believer and they struggle come on don't you take it for granted they struggle for the courage they reach for the boldness to be able to declare that and when that is spoken into the atmosphere and faith is attached to that anointed word or speech you know it becomes a promise in our lives and it becomes a reminder to us so we don't need to limit God Amen some have come through here and they have heard those kinds of expressions and they have said you know brother brandham said it wasn't going to be that he did he said the interpretation of tongues would be more than just uh quoting scripture but what was not covered in that in that description is the fact that the Holy Ghost can fall on someone and they feel an inspiration they're not preachers come on help me a little bit they're not preachers but they get an inspired word and they speak it out and it blesses somebody it encour encourages somebody it strengthens somebody and that falls under tahila and the Psalms are called the tahim which is plural so when we read the book of Psalms we are reading expressive songs that have been inspired by the Holy Spirit and sung as praises to God but they weren't all sung some of them were were were uh sister hope where is sister hope she's with the one of the children or or maybe both I don't know but but sister hope falls under that kind of an anointing sometime and she writes these poet poems give me the official style what's it called say it one more time brother Josh I shouldn't have any problem remembering that spoken word poems are portter and she has come and delivered them and we have had her to come and deliver them and it becomes so heavy in the presence of God when we hear those words because we know she's not just sitting down trying to think of something to rhyme Sister Williams is a poet sister Beverly writes all the time she has notebooks and notebooks and I have pages and pages and pages of things in my files that she has written under the inspiration if you ever get a birthday card from her she writes so little so that she can get it all in and you know how we cheat you and I cheat we get a birthday card and we just say love Stephen love brother Shelly not sister Beverly she writes a Psalm and you know I have read those things sometime I've gone back when I was low when I needed encouragement and I've read a poem that Sister Williams wrote or or or some of those inspired words that sister be and it brings strength to us it brings encouragement to one another if we all had the same gift then there wouldn't be any room for anything else but aren't you glad that God has a way of turning our praise our praise into something that falls back on us and can bless the body are you with me Psalm 22:3 but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabited the tahila of Israel yeah the spoken and sung Praises of Israel in the Amplified version of Psalm 22:3 it says but you are holy oh you who dwell in the Holy place where the Praises of Israel toila the Praises of Israel are offered Psalm 22:25 my tahila shall be of thee in the congregation I will pay my vows before them that fear him there are some in our ranks who feel like that our praise especially if it's expressive praise it should take place at home or in the privacy of devotion but the Bible is clear we don't just praise God in the closet come on we don't just praise God in the automobile or in the shower when we come together in corporate Fellowship we come to praise we come to offer tahila very much a part of the word amen Psalm Psalm uh what is that one 22 uh 25 Psalm 33:1 rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for tahila it's comely it's pleasing for the upright it suits you this word comely is an expression that says it suits you can I say to you folks toila the sincere Praise of God in your mouth the sincere songs of praise in your mou it suits you it beautifies you it edifies you when I see people entering into that kind of sincere praise it's it's like a light bulb has turned on behind their eyes their faces begin to Glow come on I saw some today that I haven't been seeing that kind of expression out of I saw a few today getting under the Overflow that hadn't been getting under it and they begin to Worship the Lord and they lit up there's been a little Shadow over some of you since I met you a little Shadow over you but you get in the presence of the Lord you start sincerely connecting with him and you forget about what's going on around you and he beautifies you he he he magnify it's that shine it's that Hal that we talked about you begin to shine when you sincerely praise the Lord Psalm 35:28 we got to move Psalm 3528 and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy tahila all the day long remember we just read the scripture where where David said I pray three times a day but I praise seven times a day you and I should get to the place where we're praising twice as long as we're praying and we might see a revolution we might see more of our needs being met perhaps number seven you're a little quiet this morning come on come on shabbach this is the seventh Hebrew word that we are sharing concerning praise there there's about 29 we're not going to do them all I'm telling you that because I want you to know the book is full of Praise you're overemphasizing praise then the Bible did right just following in this this word shabbach is it only appears 11 times in the Old Testament so it must not be so special huh no it is it is special it means to L it means to praise it means to commend it means to congratulate shabbach it is a primitive root word that means to properly address have you noticed how many of these Hebrew words for praise mention the volume yes sir you think it's okay to whisper your praise I do I do I believe you can speak to God in a quiet tone I absolutely do but I stand amazed that so many of the Hebrew words translated as praise or to Rejoice are words that mention the volume amen why do you think that is why do you think God wants you to praise Him loudly huh he wants you to give your all he also wants you to defeat the intimidating Devils that try to shut your mouth up that try to make you be timid somebody said I'm too bashful I'm too shy I I'm too introverted I'm to this and I'm to that God wants you to overcome some of that I tell you there are praise the Lords and Hallelujah that are locked up in some of you and if you were to let them out today there's no telling what God could do in your life don't you be afraid to praise the Lord you're in a safe environment when you come into this house we believe that it's vitally important in this hour it it means to to address in a loud tone figuratively to to pacify as if by words to commend to glory to keep in Praise still to Triumph doesn't that sound good to praise to comment adoration towards the the Power Glory and sanctity of the Lord this is all coming from the Hebrew to praise God for his mighty act and deeds somebody read the last part no wonder the Bible said clap your hands all you people shout unto God I was reading where one Hebrew scholar said this is more like a war cry than a church anthem he said when you read the word shabbach you're reading about a war cry that's boiling up in the sons of God I'm hearing some of that out of you the Bible said in Psalm 471 oh clap your hands all ye people shabach shout unto God with the voice of Psalm 1171 oh praise halel the Lord all ye nations praise shabbach him all ye peopleall so do you you know how I could translate that shout and shine shine and Shout halel means shine shabbach means shout so you get it right there together Psalm 14712 praise shabach the Lord oh Jerusalem praise halel thy God o Zion Psalm 145 verses four and five one generation shall shabach thy Works to another do you know how powerful it is when grandmothers and grandfathers will lead in Praise have you seen some of that around here we thank God for the multi-generational praisers how many of you enjoyed watching some of these little children out in this aisle last night amen it goes all the way up to 85 86 87 888 and then all the way down to the little ones I watched one of the brothers here with a little baby in his arm last night and the baby clapping her hands because everybody why she don't know what she means she may not but God knows what she means you get in an atmosphere like that it's contagious it'll make a dead man want to come back to life it absolutely will now we're going to get a little technical here are you ready number eight Gil Gil it's spelled ghou but it's pronounced Gil for you who will write this down it's strongs 50 1523 and 1524 it appears 40 time 45 times in the Old Testament its definition means to cry out to Rejoice like all the other words that are translated praise but I'd like for you to look carefully at this one a circle what about a word that means Circle also to did you see that girl spinning around there that couldn't be in order it was in The Book of Psalms nobody believes in modesty any more than I do I believe dresses are getting too short I believe skirts are getting too tight I believe we've got to hold this standard no matter what happen not because it brings us salvation there's no salvation in that that's right it's not how you do your hair that brings you salvation we are not saved by works lest any man should boast it is the gift of God but we have been called by the Holy Spirit to be an example to a dead Dying World around us and we have been called he said come out of her amen come out of her and be separate sayeth the Lord so I I'm I'm not talking about uh conducting your I've been in conferences I've spoke in big charismatic Pentecostal conferences where you had to you had to look away because the people are not dressed properly when they praise and I don't believe God's pleased with that I'll just be honest but I don't want anybody staring at somebody when they get under the inspiration anyway if you see somebody spinning and you don't understand it now you got a word to look up and study a circle in in Hebrew in in among the Jews there's a dance called the horror and it's a dance that's done in a circle and where did they get such an idea like that the word from the word Josiah and and Jennifer they they gave us a chance at their wedding reception to play a little Hebrew music and and do a little Hebrew dance and and some people are appalled silliest thing I've ever seen it's in the book folks dancing is in the book Dancing in a circle is in the book spinning while you dance is in the book God's not calling you to be a ballerina but God's calling you to worship Him in spirit and in truth come on Under the Influence come on on under the influence of any violent emotion or by permutation also gou which is a derivative from the Primitive word and it is usually translated Rejoice or Joy or joyful so there are times in the Bible that you will find the word rejoice and it doesn't just mean praise it means to move in a circle yes amen I'm not trying to introduce some new doctorine I'm just trying to give you what the book said right some of you are looking at me like I've just F fell off the turnup truck or something and you're wondering why we I Wonder too I'll be honest with you I wonder why after all these years we have to go back to the Bible and teach people come on that it's all right to praise what a shame that's right what a shame that we have to speak to our our our friends and our neighbors out there a a and other church folks that we know and we have to to nearly defend I'm not going to defend but I will take a moment to teach I'm not going to defend the way we praise I'm not going to defend the way we carry on but I am going to show you that it is according to the word and anybody that is opposed to that is simply a control freak ministers as as much as we love them and pray for them if they won't allow the people to have Liberty it's because they are afraid of losing control we need the Holy Ghost to come and take control of the body of [Applause] Christ somebody said the word and I must take prance the word is the most important thing I believe that too that's why we worship an hour and preach for two come on violent emotion I looked up there and that man was kind of jerking like he was mad and I just don't know if there's anything to that look you don't know what you're going to do I pray that you that are sitting in the seat of the scornful I pray that when God falls on you I'm going to go tell your mama I'm going to tell your daddy I'm going to go tell your former pastors yeah when the spirit of God falls on you I'm going to tell them how you act because you don't know what you're going to do until that thing falls on you those Joy Bells we read about last night that begins to ringing in your spirit man [Applause] Hallelujah let me give you some scripture you want scriptures don't you let's find some scriptures where this word that means to spin around or to dance in a circle or to display a violent emotion is mentioned got to hurry there's a bunch of them 1 Chronicles 16:31 let the heavens be glad and let the [Music] [Applause] Earth wait a minute you flat earther that word Rejoice means Circle it means to spin around come on on it means the Earth is dancing the Earth is spinning the Earth is moving to give glory to its creator and let the men say among the Nations Psalm 9:14 that I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion I will I will rejoice gou I will rejoice in thy salvation Gil forgive me gil I will rejoice in thy salvation Psalm 32:11 be glad in the Lord and what does it mean to move in a circle be glad in the Lord and move in a circle celebrate in a circle oh it's quiet rejoice in his oh did I pick the wrong one 3211 forgive me be glad in the Lord and rejoice Gil ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are I believe you ought to be living just as high as you're jumping come on I don't care how high you jump but when your feet hit the ground you better be living a surrendered life to the Lord because that's all he'll bless in this hour if anybody thinks that I don't believe that you had known me very long I believe we've got to come out of some of the some of the things that are binding us and holding us and I believe the lord gave us strategy this morning to get out from under him and that's to praise him and then speak to the situation and watch it turn and my soul Psalm 359 and 10 and my soul shall be joyful in the Lord it shall rejoice in his salvation all my bones do you want all of your bones to give God praise all of my bones shall say Lord who is like unto thee which deliver is the poor from him that is too strong for him y the poor and the needy from him that spoth him is that what God has done in your life Psalm 118:24 this is the the day which the Lord hath made you familiar with that one we will give yes we will rejoice we will spin if we feel like we want to spin we'll move in C just reading you'll be so glad you'll start looking for your you you'll find your favorite psalm and you'll go back and you'll start looking at these words and you'll see that it's not praising any way we want to these words mean something are you with me we will rejoice and be glad in it Proverbs 23 I like this one Proverbs 23 24-25 the father of the righteous this word Gil appears twice here the father father of the righteous shall greatly greatly is Gil Rejoice is Gil double spinning double rejoicing double praise the father come on you dry men come on come on you that sit back and watch your wies rejoice come on some of you stiff Brothers come on that watch everybody else enter in the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that beateth a wise child right shall have joy of him thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bear thee shall re joice wouldn't you like to bring a little joy to your parents Isaiah 61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful yes my soul shall be joyful Gil in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deth himself with ornaments and as a bride adorne herself with jewels Zechariah 10 seven and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall Gil rejoice as though as through wine when you see them rejoicing you may wonder if they've been in some of that new wine yay their children shall see it I got to got to emphasize this minute their children shall see it and shall so now some of you young folks that's so easily embarrassed sister Flo was unable to be here this morning but it used to worry her so bad that her praise and her her worship was going to embarrass her children and she'd say especially when we started streaming she said I know they see me and I know they see me carrying on and I know it must embarrass them but I have to get over that why don't some of you children and young people so easily embarrassed why don't you look up there and see your mother who's labored for you who's drugged you through who's prayed you through why don't you look up there and see your mama praising God and let it bring great joy to your [Applause] heart I don't want my children to be embarrassed and if they tell me they are you ain't seen nothing yet if my praise embarrassed is you now I'm looking for some Wilder praise I want to praise him until you can rejoice in it these people are rejoicing as through wine You observe them and they look like they become intoxicated and brother brandom explain that to us it is the stimulation of Revelation yes sir sir when you know that you know that you know that you know that you have heard God's word when you know that you know that you know that you're a Son of God it'll bring a stimulation when you know that you've received the revelation of Jesus Christ for our day it'll bring a stimulation oh yes you won't act like a Methodist then nothing wrong with the Methodist but you won't act like that you won't you won't act like the Episcopalian then nothing wrong the Episcopalian but you won't act like that then you'll act like somebody that's got a hold of something Zephaniah 3:17 this is so beautiful to me I hope you catch the beauty of this one the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty somebody say you're mighty Lord he will he will he will rejoice over thee here you are rejoicing over him here you've come to give God praise and to bring him joy and look at what Zephaniah said I caught the Lord I caught a glimpse of the Lord and he was rejoicing over you amen with joy he will rest in his love he will Gil the first Joy is not the second Joy he will Gil over thee with singing folks you've never you you you've never realized perhaps that the Lord sings over his people and he rejoices over his people and he spins over his people and I believe with all of my heart that there are times when that anointing and that atmosphere shifts and you see people beginning to do things they don't understand maybe moving their arms like this or doing something that looks so so out of the ordin AR and so strange and so weird to you I honestly believe sometime that they're picking up that they're sensing by the spirit the movement that's happening over their heads as both the angels of the Lord and the Lord God himself Rejoice over his people with joy with moving in a circular motion he sings over us yes Lord wouldn't we want to reciprocate wouldn't we want to Rejoice over him wouldn't we want to sing over for him and give him praise and we come to the last one nine malol it's strongs 4234 it's derived from strongs 2342 it means dance dancing this word appear six times in the Old Testament and the definition is a round dance dancing to dance in a circle or to whirl about by turning do you see how similar these two words are and yet somehow the translators believe that they were different enough that there had to be another word there had to be something that would add to it there was some reason for for for the Hebrew writer choosing two different words in Psalm 30: 11 and well thou Hast turned for me listen at these just listen at the theme of these of these verses there's six of them I'm going to read five quickly thou Hast turned for me my Let Me Hear You morning into dancing thou Hast put off my and girded me with gladness come on brother Amos this is you this is you you don't have to be you don't have to feel embarrassed because God is giving you peace and God is giving you he he said to me and I don't mean to embarrass him in any way he's my brother my friend he said to me yesterday I feel like I know you through the stream and standing there with him I felt the same way and we mention again only for the sake of this that he's just recently buried his wife he's here with nine children and he he said I did my grieving in those days when she was suffering but he said there was almost like a release that happened and you feel a little embarrassed by that I said to him I really know I don't know the same kind of suffering but I know that I did my grieving for my mother when her mind left me and and when she when her body finally left here I was so thrilled and so happy that she was released from her suffering and was in her right mind and in a new body and and so if if any of us can can squeeze a praise out of our sorrow if any of us can choose to glorify God even when we've been through a painful time this is the reason why because it is God who turns our morning into dancing it's him that takes off the sackcloth of grief and GS us with his gladness I'm tired of Christian people looking like they're sucking on pemons I'm tired of people who believe this message acting like they've lost their best friend never taking a chance to give God glory let's do his name don't you be guilty of such a behavior is that you give him praise I hope you'll give the deacons trouble woo reminds me of that old song Shirley Caesar used to sing hold my mule they got tired of that old colored man disturbing the service it wasn't like this church where everybody's praising but he was the only one and he he'd praise when they're praising and he'd praise when they weren't praising he'd praise when they're singing he'd praise when they're preaching he couldn't help himself he'd just jump up and do a little dance and one day he's out in the in the field plowing the mule and the and the Cadillac rides up and the deacons get out and they find him there he stops the mule and they begin to talk to him and they say brother we have come to talk to you we we can't have no none of this in our church we have a dignified church we want to have a church that the mayor can come to we want to have a church that the dignitaries can come to and we don't want to embarrass them by the way we carry on so you're going to have to calm down in our church your praise is disturbing people and and we don't know why you have to be so out of the way and he said you just don't know what the Lord has done for me you must not understand what the Lord has done for me he said I don't want to disturb your church right I don't mean to disturb your service and about that time it falls on him and he turns to one of the deacons and he says hold my mu if I can't jump in your church I'll jump in my field if I can't praise God in your church I'll praise God in my house Hallelujah sometimes we have to be that determined nothing or no one or no circumstance is going to quench Our Praise woo Hallelujah let them let me go on thou has turned for me my morning into dancing my that has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee do you hear what he's saying he's saying you took my sorrow you turned my mour to dancing you replaced my sackcloth with the with the with the clothes of of of gladness so that so that to the end my glory may sing praise to thee and and and not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever Psalm 1493 let them praise His name in the myle I will when the spirit of the Lord hits me I didn't read that there I come out of Pentecost the Pentecostal church I come out of the Holiness Church I know exactly how they taught it you don't do anything till it hits you well it's been so long since it hit anybody around here seems like sometime that if we waited on it to hit us we'd never get involved there's nothing in this Bible that tells us you must wait for the Lord to fall on you before you praise Him amen there's nothing in this Bible that says you got to feel like it before you praise him there's nothing that says he has to to to uh wrestle you out of your Pew and force your feet to dance so that you'll dance before for him no Bible for that whatsoever I don't know where we get such an idea here's what the Bible said let them praise His name mle praise him with stringed instruments and organs Jeremiah 31:4 again I will build thee listen these are beautiful verses this is prophetic to to the to the reestablish Ling of the of the Covenant of God with the Jewish people in the land of Israel but you can claim your promises a part of that grafted in uh one new man he said again I will build thee and thou shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shall go forth in the dances M of them that make Mary and then in verse 13 and 14 of the same chapter then shall the virgin virgin rejoice in the M dance both young men that's me and you I represent the old man together for I will turn their mourning yeah into joy and Will Comfort them and make them Rejoice from their sorrow listen to this and I will satate the soul of the priest with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness sayeth the Lord in what hour in the hour that their morning is

going to fall right off of your seat when has your pastor ever closed a service at 1:00 we're not closing the service just the sermon yeah I saw the Spirit of the Lord moving over this house this
