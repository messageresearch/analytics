TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and we are in the middle of a series of programs on the process of spiritual adoption this would be installment number five and five is grace so maybe the Lord will help us to accomplish something in the reading of the scripture in the teaching today we would certainly like to see you get a deeper understanding of what it means to be an adopted son of God the authority that comes with the privilege and of course with all privileges there are also responsibilities and we have to always examine what kind of people we are and are we willing to live by the Word of God I want to just encourage you and testify to you today that no price is too great to pay to serve the Living God no sacrifice is too big and I realize that some of you in other parts of the world have a bigger sacrifice to make perhaps it's even dangerous for you to really share your faith publicly and I want you to know that we don't take that lightly we pray for you that God will sustain you that he will strengthen you that he will protect you that he will fill you with His Holy Spirit and that he will lead you and direct your footsteps and if you've got a prayer request that you'd like for us to specifically pray with you about maybe know your name and what your need is then we would just be happy to receive an email from you or a letter or a phone call all the contact information is given to you on the screen we want to be there for you the best way that we can we want to be faithful to join with you in prayer because our God is a prayer answering God and he is the same yesterday and today and forever and so we believe in the healing power of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we know that he's a healer we know that he's a deliverer we know that he's a savior so what ever you have need of give your knee to the Lord tell lay your petition before him and and believe with all of your heart we just understand that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen and I just asked the Lord today right now to anoint your faith to believe God for even the impossible what looks virtually impossible in your life I'm asking the Lord to strengthen your faith and anointed real good so that you can believe God in spite of what the circumstances look like let's look to the Word of God today we're going to the book of Galatians in Galatians chapter 4 we've read in Romans 8 and we've read in Ephesians and now I want to read a few verses to you in Galatians concerning again adoption now what did we say that word adoption means it comes from two greek words and it basically means the placing of a mature son not a wine baby not a crybaby not a rebellious teenager but the placing of a mature son grant it Lord grant it that's my prayer that you would be able to place your mature sons in the body in this hour and there there may be some more deliverance needed in our life before we can come to that place of maturity but hey we've got God to help us we've got the Holy Spirit to guide us so if we can just keep accessing the promises of God by faith believing without wavering and and obeying the Lord just being obedient to him in all things and I know that he's going to manifest himself through his sons in a great and mighty way here in the end time Galatians chapter 4 verse 1 is a very important portion of Scripture in this study it says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differ it nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all notice that a natural born son of a citizen of Israel differed very little from the child of a hired servant though this young man would be the heir of all things yet while they were growing up there was not a lot of different shown to him but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father now that's exactly how it was in Bible days a father would appoint his son tutors and governors who would teach him and instruct him and train him and test him and cause him to to come to a place of discipline and authority and responsibility and when the father determined that this course of study was over then something began to take place and we're going to look at that in a few programs anyway maybe not get to it so much today but we are going to look at it very carefully verse 3 even so we now that's the natural but here's the spiritual even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world the influences of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son Messiah Yeshua The Anointed One in the fullness of time to fulfill the scripture to fulfill the prophecies for hundreds of years the prophets had prophesied the coming of the Messiah the coming of the Messiah and in in and yet nothing anybody did could make it happen one moment earlier are our be late or have any flexibility in in time because it was not until God said the time has come you see it was not until the father said okay this boy has come to the age he has passed the test and so now we're going to celebrate him and that's the same way here it was not until the fullness of time was come that God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons here we are again adoption the placing of a mature son now sometimes when you see that word son in the New Testament it refers to more or less a child or an infant but when you see the phrase the adoption of sons in fact when we read enrollments but as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God it's talking about a child a toddler a very almost very immature child but when you read further and it talks about the adoption of sons then that is the graduation that is the placing of a mature son to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because your sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father there is my romans 8 of a father there it is again because your sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son Yeshua the Messiah Jesus into your hearts crying Abba Father now what does that mean it means the Spirit of God has come to you because you're a son to reveal to you that you have a very special invitation to have a very unique relationship with the Heavenly Father one that is based on love and grace and mercy and redemption so that you can be brought from a place of fear of bondage because bondage brings fear to a place of relationship where you can cry papa Abba father god that's what the fullness of adoption is going to do in our lives one of the many things it's going to help us come to a place where we realize what we have when we r sons of God and who we belong to as sons of God and that we are not to fear God in the sense that he's ready to destroy us if we fail but we're going to reverence him in reverential fear we're going to honor him because he's God but we're going to tell him what's in her heart we're going to lay our burdens before him we're going to come to him as he has asked us to do without fear without reluctance without dread do you know if you're angry you can tell god god I'm angry I'm really angry things have happened in my life that I feel are unfair and it's caused me to be angry and I need your help and if you've got this religious mindset of God and you come to God and say I'm angry well God just just knocks you down and and steps all over you but that's not the God of the Bible the God of the Bible picks you up and says I want to help you I want to help you with your fear I want to Minister strength to you and so it's so important for us to understand that this is the kind of relationship that God wants to have with his people because your son's God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father so really it's like his spirit crying out of our spirit of a father that's good wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ now that's pretty powerful now let's see how how far we wanted to go with that I think that's the last verse we were going to read wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ did you know even a natural-born son of a wealthy father was not automatically in line to inherit what the father had he had to go through the tutors he had to go through the governor's he had to be trained and taught how to handle himself how to behave how to treat other people fairly how to make righteous decisions how to invest all these things that would be if it was a maybe a farm family how to farm how to treat the servants how to treat one you know the the other business associates are those you bartered with the traded with there's there's so much that had to be trained and it was not until the Sun passed the test that he was celebrated and adopted and so even a natural born son had to come to that place of being publicly adopted and the purpose of that was to establish to the community that my son is now mature enough that I am depending on him and I want you to know that he is now authorized to conduct business in my name now if that's the natural side what about the spiritual side if if God is the scripture said you and I have been placed under tutors our great tutor is the Holy Spirit of God and we've been given tutors and governors in the natural spiritual leader spiritual father's spiritual mothers those who've loved us and prayed for us and instructed us and shared the truth with us watching for our souls trying to help us to come to a place where we can actually live out what we read in the Word of God and when we come to that place that we have passed the test and we have proven our love for the father and that we are determined to be what he has called us to be to walk in the fullness of our destiny then we come to that adoption ceremony where God celebrates us manifestation the apocalipsis the unveiling of the sons of God where he then says one last time to this wicked world these are my sons I'm pleased with them and I'm releasing authority in their hands and when that company of Sun steps forth there's going to be some unbelievable quick changes in the spiritual atmosphere of this world because there's going to be a full shift of authority from the throne to the earth and you're going to see the sons of God rise up and manifest the works of God for a quick short period of time that that I think we could say unprecedented the closest thing we have to understanding that would be the book of Acts where there was a whole community of believers that we're operating in the fullness of the Spirit of God but that does not even even that does it begin to really touch the surface or perhaps we could look back to the past generation during the great healing revivals and we could see the great men and women of God who were like prototypes for instance brother branham William Branham that God used so mightily in the 50s and 60s he was like a prototype of what a mature Son of God look like we're talking about a man who spoke on God's behalf and hey guess what God did what he spoke thousands upon thousands upon thousands of documented miracles where God manifested even the power of the creative spoken word we saw the unveiling of mystery truths and revelations come forth and and we're not saying that brother Branham was the only one but he was certainly used in a in a very profound and unique way there's no doubt about that in my mind but there were others who also came into a place of this adoption janji lake and and even mariah woodworth editor and God used AAA Allen and I know that we could stop and find thoughts or we could find weaknesses and all of God's servants so we can today but we have to realize if there were tokens in the past generation of men and women who superseded the rest of the church world who actually begin to carry on the Ministry of Jesus Christ in the earth in a way that it hadn't been seen in two thousand years what's that about well I believe that was the first fruits of a harvest that's about to come forth in this generation some have called it the harvest of harvesters where God is going to raise up a people who will function in the fullness of the authority of God as adopted sons that's our place the manifested sons of God those who are our Commission those who have graduated to that place where God has said I'm giving my authority into their hands they're conducting my business in the earth I'm backing them up I'm telling you it's a good day when you know God's backing up what you're doing now how is that going to happen it's going to have to be because we've come into a place of union and oneness with him where we have laid our mind and will and thoughts and emotions aside and we've taken on the mind of Christ as it sounds so big that you could never walk in that place with the enemy desire to keep you from it absolutely does he want to make it sound so grandiose and so big that that little old me and little oh you could never find it he wants it to be that way but brother sister it's not you see God new again before the foundation of the world who would be alive in this generation I believe this is the last of days the end of days but we're approaching the last of the last days I believe that we're coming into that final generation of people and there's going to be calamity and there's going to be wrath and there's going to be judgment and there's going to be darkness in the earth like never before but in the midst of gross darkness there's going to be a light that shines so brightly and that light is going to be the reflect Shin of Jesus Christ in a group of believers all over the world who have come to that place of maturity and adoption in him in 1943 a man by the name of TA sparks wrote an interesting statement and I don't think that necessarily ta sparks was a full gospel pentecostal charismatic prophetic believer like like maybe you are or this is sort of what our background is but he must have had something from the Lord because listen at what he wrote God will reach his end he will come in in his son in terms of sonship to take up residence with those or within those begotten of him those who are born of the Spirit now let's break that down God will come to the end he will come in in his son in terms of sonship to take up residence within those who are begotten of him and will grow in them see it is a process it's not a click click click 123 done finish your adopted there is an unfolding there is a revealing there's a teaching a process of of training that takes place he will grow in them he will increase his measure in them yes Lord yes Lord increase your measure in us until at last they are brought to the unity of the faith we need that they become a mighty embodiment and revelation of God himself do you hear those profound words of truth I hope so cuz I'm going to read it again I want you to really hear it God will reach his in he will come in in his son in terms of sonship to take up residence within those begotten of him and will grow in them I like that part because it is a growth we are growing God is doing something in us he will grow in them increase his measure in them the measure of his spirit until at last brought to the unity of the faith they become a mighty embodiment and revelation of God himself now he said not in deity but in what he is spiritually and morally in this universe conformed to the image of his son a living listen a living expression of God's on thoughts now isn't that a beautiful sermon that you and I might become a living expression of the very thoughts of God how will that happen well we have to we have to start thinking his thoughts we have to ask him to renew our mind we have to put on the mind of Christ so that our our thoughts began to dim as John the Baptist prayed I must decrease so that he might increase I believe that ta sparks was absolutely right I believe that God is going to have a people that he can reflect himself a people who will be the the very embodiment isn't that the word he used a mighty embodiment what does that mean it means the Word of God becoming flesh the embodiment and revelation of God himself you say the whole what is that that sounds so wild well it doesn't sound wild to me it sounds like what the world needs hey we've got to have something and we've got to have it in a hurry the church is not enough the church has not been doing enough good intentions well-meaning people but not enough is being accomplished we need a vine embodiment of the nature of God on the earth we need a company of people who are a revelation of God Himself who are a living expression of God's on thoughts and that's what he wants to do and he's looking somebody said how do I qualify well the place of qualification is the altar of surrender it's surrendering and it's ultimately surrendering not surrendering today giving in today and then picking up and doing it your way tomorrow it's a day-by-day surrendering lord I surrender Lord and not just with your words but with your life with your attitude with your actions with your reactions how we react to circumstances around us this whole thing that we're going through as Christians is a test we're being tested and tried so that the full measure the full stature of Jesus Christ as Peter called it can be expressed in us here in the end time I've written a couple notes here Christ will eventually fill this universe with himself through sonship by generating a mature body of people through faith he's going to feel you you read the scripture that talks about and the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall fill the earth how because of a company of people who have become the embodiment and the revelation of God and the expression of God's own thoughts amatuer body remember the bride body is coming to maturity in our generation I believe that I believe that I I believe that this is the generation that's going to see the maturity of the bride body and all of those generations who have gone before us have contributed to today's maturing corporate Bride of Christ we could not be where we are if it had not been for those who have gone before us blazing the trail marking the way paying the price many of them by giving their own lives shedding their own blood going to the stake and being burned and we could go on and on talking about the Montross ities that the horrible horrendous deaths that men and women have died for the name of Jesus Christ for the very cause of Jesus Christ men have lost their lives and and are losing their lives today in other nations of the world what we need and in strong host you know there's religious error that has strong holds over nations any any religion that teaches that that there's many ways to God and and that Jesus is just another one of the holy men I'm telling you that's a strong hold that that takes families and nations by force and what we need in those nations is we need that embodiment we need that generation of men and women who will raise up with the signs and wonders of the of what we read about in the book of Acts in their lives and let's show let's let's come to a place where we stand at the Mount Carmel showdown and we can say the God who is the one true Living God let him answer by fire and watch fire fall from heaven to consume the sacrifice somebody said what in are you really talking about those kinds of things in modern times I'm telling you it's the only answer it's the only answer for the strongholds of philosophy and the strongholds of the New Age movement and the strongholds of false religion and hate religions it's the only answer is that here in the end time God raised up a people who are full of Jesus Christ who have his authority who speak the word and it comes to pass who lay hands on the sick and they recover who have authority over the the powers of the demonic and and which crafts and so many strong holes that we face sometimes in different areas you know we face different strongholds I don't know where you are right now I don't know what you're facing but I'm asking you to pray over these scriptures and and present yourself before the Lord and say Lord if you want to show yourself mightily through my life I'm ready to pay the price I'm ready to yield I'm ready to surrender father I ask you right now to help us to come to the place where you can come and live in our skin speak through our mouths use our hands and feet to further your cause in the earth let healing flow in the wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua the Messiah we pray amen any man well thank you I time flew by again I sure do appreciate you watching the Eagles cry and I invite you to tune in again next time bye bye for now [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music]
