[0:12] i was standing on
[0:14] a mountain looking
[0:18] toward the sky
[0:21] and i saw a storm approaching
[0:26] and i feared that i would die
[0:31] i saw god's creatures
[0:34] run and see a better
[0:37] place to hide heard the thunder
[0:44] [Music]
[0:54] now the clouds were moving faster
[1:00] lightning flashing bright
[1:04] clouds so dark they hit
[1:08] the sun and it seemed that it was
[1:12] night when all
[1:15] at once there was a feeling
[1:18] like i never had before
[1:23] above the storm you should have heard me
[1:27] say god has given me
[1:30] [Music]
[1:36] so spread your wings
[1:41] [Music]
[1:47] you weren't born for the valley
[1:52] you
[1:54] [Music]
[2:06] with
[2:07] [Music]
[2:20] all at once the spear it lifted me
[2:26] high above it all
[2:29] [Music]
[2:31] and i never even had to move
[2:34] my wings the holy spirit had control
[2:40] i was soaring high above my
[2:43] circumstances my confusion and all my
[2:47] pain
[2:49] though i've spent many years in the old
[2:52] barnyard
[2:54] i was always an eagle
[2:57] by his name
[3:02] so
[3:05] [Music]
[3:13] you weren't born to live in the valley
[3:18] you were born to live in the sky
[3:22] don't let your trials ever get
[3:25] you down or drive your spirit to
[3:30] the ground
[3:33] [Music]
[3:40] spread your wings
[3:44] little
[3:46] [Music]
[3:59] now don't you ever let your child get
[4:03] you
[4:03] down or drive your spirit
[4:07] low to the ground up
[4:14] [Music]
[4:16] [Applause]
[4:18] [Music]
[4:40] little
[4:41] [Music]
[4:54] grace
[4:59] you
