[0:00] and there is indeed a part of us that is
[0:04] eternal hallelujah hallelujah we now
[0:07] have uh uh received a a seed that is
[0:13] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[0:16] liveth and abideth forever there is no
[0:19] end to that word in fact it continues to
[0:23] manifest itself and perform itself it's
[0:27] a living thing it's a living entity the
[0:31] word what we fellowship with is a
[0:34] printed page but we're not talking about
[0:37] the record we're talking about the
[0:39] Living Word and the Living Word is not a
[0:42] book it's not a tape it's not your
[0:46] pastor's sermon The Living Word is a
[0:48] person and he walks not only among us
[0:52] but he dwells in us he has chosen us as
[0:56] a throne the Ark of the Covenant is now
[1:00] in the inner being of the redeemed and
[1:03] The Mercy Seat is there and the glory of
[1:06] the Lord hangs over The Mercy Seat in us
[1:10] just like it did in the Tabernacle of
[1:11] the Wilderness all of that was teaching
[1:14] us to get us to the place where we could
[1:17] realize that we haven't received a
[1:19] substitute from God you know it's not
[1:22] like Hallmark he cared enough to send
[1:25] his very best but he came enough to be
[1:28] his very best in in US New Testament
[1:31] promises are not only to help us bless
[1:35] us and strengthen us but they are
[1:38] available to give us a taste of the
[1:42] divine nature of what it's like to live
[1:45] with deity in your skin it's about
[1:49] Authority God knew that if he put a
[1:52] portion of himself in you you would
[1:55] operate in the in the authority that he
[1:57] operated in it's adoption
[2:00] it has a beginning it has a process a
[2:04] Proving Ground and then it has an
[2:08] announcement this is my beloved Son in
[2:12] whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him
[2:16] the father announcing when he speaks
[2:20] he's speaking on my behalf did you know
[2:23] that's what he's looking for in his wife
[2:26] that's what he's looking for in his
[2:28] bride a people who will recognize it's
[2:32] not by our strength or power it's by the
[2:34] authority of the divine nature that
[2:37] lives in Us by the genuine New Birth and
[2:42] when I said genuine New Birth we're
[2:44] talking about a holy ghost that goes
[2:47] beyond the flesh the Holy Ghost can fall
[2:51] on your flesh and give you a chill and
[2:54] give you a thrill and give you a
[2:56] quickening you can cry as you respond to
[3:00] what you feel because you just get so
[3:03] quickened that you can hardly control
[3:06] what's happening on your flesh but
[3:09] that's not the fullness of the new birth
[3:11] you see there's something on the inside
[3:13] that regenerated spirit that now has the
[3:17] divine nature upon it it was a fallen
[3:20] Spirit when you got here now by the New
[3:22] Birth the Divine Nature has fallen on it
[3:26] and it's now a regenerated spirit and I
[3:29] I hesitate to call it a regenerated
[3:32] human spirit because once you place the
[3:35] deity of God the Zoey the eternal life
[3:38] of God on it can you really technically
[3:41] call it a human spirit
[3:43] anymore it this life that you live isn't
[3:46] yours now you're living his life which
[3:49] is a Divine Life the divine nature is
[3:53] living in that it's now Eternal the body
[3:57] may pass the soul at some point May
[4:01] cease to
[4:02] function but that Spirit life in you is
[4:08] eternal you won't need five senses in
[4:11] that new body you'll have something a
[4:14] whole lot more than that not just a
[4:16] deposit of the divine nature but the
[4:19] very fullness of the life of God
