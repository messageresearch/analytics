you to worship you you are worthy hallelujah you might appreciate your seats for just a moment god bless you the presence of the lord is here he was here early he was here before you got here i know you brought your portion with him i thank you for that you've added already to the atmosphere but before you came he was already here and as the musicians were singing uh some of the worship and getting ready and making sure the keys were right the wonderful presence of the lord was already filling this room and he did it no doubt to greet you when you came so if you came with the right heart and a right spirit to worship him then you could already come in and feel what the lord was doing it was special and it doesn't always happen that way on a sunday morning but this morning it was you might say well it's because you've been out of church a couple services well i want you to know i've had his presence oh he meets us when we focus on him he's as close as the mention of his name my grandmother used to tell people just go into a room and say i love you jesus just said just raise your hand and say i love you jesus i love you jesus i love you jesus i love you jesus she said just say it just mean it from the bottom of your heart and say it as long as you want to and then be quiet and see if you can hear him in the depth of your heart saying i love you too it's not always an audible voice but it's a presence that says i love you too you're mine you're mine anyway i don't know how god works with you but that's how he works with me and i'm so thankful for it today thank you for all your prayers for us i know you were praying because many people texted to say we're praying for you i don't know if that was because you loved me and you wanted me to have a restful time or if you felt sorry for me for having so many toddlers with me i don't know what it was but i want you to know all was well and god blessed me he blessed me and uh i like the ocean i know some people don't like the ocean for many years of my life i didn't like the ocean i don't like naked people but i like the ocean and i like the beach and uh i know that there are off times and those are my favorite times and god gave us that restaurants were full and shopping places were full but the beach that we got planted on is one we've never been to before and there were hours and hours that i spent on the beach alone i don't know how you do that with a crowd of people with you but alone and i was looking this way and that way and i couldn't see anybody in either direction now you know that is that was for me it was just the lord he just let me have it all and uh he ministered to my heart and encouraged me and rested me and i thank him for that and i i appreciate your prayers for all of us and was it noisy oh yes it's noisy when you got uh my four kids are nearly grown you get them in a room it's noisy you add any other voices to that and it it gets noisier and noisier and if you've got any ellsworth's at all in the mix they all talk at the same time it's just a family and so you just have to talk you just jump right in there and talk to right brother richard you don't know if anybody's hearing you or not but you just jump in and get your say and it was wonderful and i appreciate the goodness of the lord and his provision i want you to know you had some really really fabulous preaching you did while while we were away last sunday morning was real food and i haven't finished listening to tuesday night but what i heard and i will i will i told brother greeley this morning i want to hear the rest of it um it was wonderful and i enjoyed it so much and i know i will when i hear the rest i sent josh a text joshua as his family uh in-law family at least calls him i sent him a text on sunday morning and i i didn't on tuesday night because i didn't catch it all but he did a marvelous job in leading worship anointed it was anointed [Music] the thing i like about when josh leads a worship he hasn't done it that many times is i like that he does it from his heart and you can feel it and and uh i i like i just kind of like the way it flows it was a real soothing and anointed time and i appreciated it so much the presence of the lord came in the house where we were staying and you just can't help but just worship you just you just can't help it when that atmosphere when you're near that atmosphere you you know i i hope you don't ever have to tell me brother greeley i hope you don't ever have to tell me to praise him hope you don't ever have to tell me to lift my hands if i ever get so far gone that i don't know to remember to lift up my hands would you tell me then but as long as i know as long as i know i'm going to lift my hands and love him he's so wonderful he's so worthy and as always when god's people go somewhere he gives you divine connections he sends people to you whether you want them or not sometimes you don't want them sometimes you just want to be quiet and i don't know how many times this week i look up here comes some some man walking right straight toward me as fast as he could come and strike up a conversation mostly older men i guess i look the part mostly older men and they just start talking to me about their life and their family and and one one man came up from he was visiting his family from california he began to tell me some tragedy that had struck his family and you could tell that he just needed to tell it he just needed to get it out and it could be the the therapy of the ocean was kind of drawing that out of him he just poured it out and i said lord you know how to give and provide that opportunity to minister even when we're not in ministry mode jesus is always present in our lives and i believe he shines so thank you so much for that i want to mention a couple of things to you before we look to the word and that is sister joyce bray's birthday is today i don't know her uh condition this morning but i know that sister pam has been reaching out the last couple of weeks for prayer for her mother and i have been praying for her she is having a difficult time and we know that god is able he is faithful he is able she has loved us she's loved us here and has spoken into some of our lives and we may not see her in worship her her uh station in life has changed a bit and her physical condition has changed a bit but i can't help but remember the blessing that she has been to us so would you lift her up today on her birthday that god would touch her and help her uh as brother uh gosman posted today on our private page this is the anniversary of a time that the spoken word of god was manifested in 1963 when a terrible storm had come in and there would have been no way that brother branham and those brothers could have got out of that storm alive it was that difficult of a time but god had been dealing with him about the power of the spoken word had already demonstrated it to him several times and he was inspired of the spirit of god to raise up and speak to that storm and god sent that storm out the very same way that it came in just went right out and god delivered them i like to celebrate those anniversaries of things that god has done and i like to remind people he's the same god he's the same god today he can speak to through you to your storm he can inspire you to tell it to go and it has to go tomorrow monday the 25th is a very special birthday and uh you know her as sister royale for me she's sister royal jelly but for you she's royale and her birthday tomorrow can i tell can i tell how many tomorrow is her 6-0 birthday and that's not 0-6 that's 6-0 would you wish sister royale 60th birthday god bless you you don't look it not at all not at all may god bless her specifically and especially today and tomorrow on her birthday i don't see josiah here today but i saw him on the stream while we were away and he has a birthday this week on wednesday the 27th so let's lift him up to the lord and he shares a birthday with brother branham's first little girl sharon rose who passed away in that ohio flood and also it's also the very same day that brother branham's mother sister ella branham passed away on wednesday the 27th now the only other thing that we want to mention now before we forget is uh be praying for our services this weekend that god will minister to young people we didn't open them up as wide as we could have in fact now we're having people say why didn't you invite us why didn't you let us know we would have planned to come but when my wife and sister laura were talking and planning to do something for the young people it was not my idea let me just get that in there right away not my idea um but they wanted to do something for the young people and uh so they worked on it and then they had to convince me and they convinced me and i thought well we'll we'll just turn it into a weekend uh of the word and so friday night the young people will gather here and they will have a banquet together and there are some coming from other places uh even as far away as arizona and texas but just just one or two here i understand there's going to be a group coming down from brother gisendaner's church also brother brian hembree is bringing his family and some will be with us and so if you have an invitation to the banquet would you please let somebody know my wife or sister laurel or however you all have put that would you let them know you're coming and the reason why is because the first idea was that there would be a price for the banquet and i can't do it this time i just said i don't want to do that i don't want them to have to come and buy their meal so my wife and i are providing the food sister laurel and my wife are doing of the cooking and my wife and i are providing the food as a gift to the young people so they don't have to buy a ticket to come they just come and eat and enjoy if you haven't let them know it's real important that you do because when we do something we want to make sure there's enough for everybody that's there and if you haven't let them know you're coming would you do that today and that way we can make sure that everything we need is in place brother dwayne is going to be with us and sister heather dwayne and heather jackson and their kids they're going to be here for the entire weekend at the banquet on friday night he's going to give his testimony of how he came to the lord he was raised in the truth but like brother greeley he had to find his way to the to the god of the truth through the lord jesus christ and you will enjoy his testimony and then saturday night at six o'clock next saturday night at six o'clock we'll have a service here all are invited you're welcome no matter how old you are how young you are you're welcome uh there's not going to be any toddlers at the banquet we're asking that everyone find a babysitter so that's where you can contribute we can have some volunteer babysitters here to help these uh uh little couples young couples have an opportunity to come together and not have to chase toddlers and i think that's a good idea for them to bless them and i can tell you're so excited we do know your phone number and if we get in a bind we may just call on some of you to babysit or we could send them all to chad's you know all of them at one time just take them all he's the man right jennifer he's the candy man anyway saturday night at six o'clock we'll have a service brother dwayne is going to preach with a theme toward the youth but it will minister to all of us it'll be the word of the hour and it'll minister to all of us so come and the youth will say excuse me the youth will sing and it'll be a wonderful time and then sunday morning next sunday morning 11 a.m brother dwayne jackson from ruth north carolina will be preaching for the whole church it's going to be a wonderful weekend i'm asking the lord to do something for the youth that it not just be an entertaining thing give them some good natural food but give them some good spiritual food and may they just be encouraged and refreshed and strengthened to go on if they don't have the holy ghost why don't we believe that god will fill them with the holy ghost he's still a filler he's still pouring it out and so yes there will be service here tuesday night at seven o'clock as well i'm excited about what the lord is doing did you get enough of a breaks from from standing will you stand let's look to the word of god let's thank god for these musicians and everyone who's contributed wonderful to have sister west with us this weekend what a blessing it is [Applause] god is good all the time i wanted to uh just go back and read one little thing if i can find it here that uh our brother tommy mckinstry i wished it was a little easier to find these comments but brother tommy mckinstry is a brother who pastors a body of believers in ireland when i was in ireland preaching god did a couple miraculous things in the meeting and one was he he he really touched a man who was near to insanity god really touched his life delivered him of a demonic oppression and he sat down in his right mind and it was a wonderful thing and brother tommy has shared other testimonies that took place in ireland that i was not even aware of and he's streaming our services live and he contacted me this week he said i want to thank brother shelley for praying for my little boy james we had to take james to the hospital this week but glory to our mighty savior james is well today nine years old my youngest son please pray for salvation of all my children would you do that i don't know how many children brother mckinstry has when i met him he didn't have a wife and i didn't have a wife we were young single men working for the lord so i don't know how many children he has but god touched james this week he was having a real asthma attack i believe it was and was really really suffering in the lord moved for him in a profound way that's who he is that's who he is he's good to us all the time isn't he would you turn to zechariah 12 i want to read verse 10 and it's going to take a moment to pull you back to your focus i i want to say this without i hope you take this in the right way if you were here last sunday morning but distracted i sure do wish you'd go back and hear what brother greeley had to say you know it's possible to be in the service and be distracted i was on the other end of the line and so i could see a lot of things that you might not have seen and i saw several people getting a real good nap right in places where i sure wish that they would have been awake to hear what the lord was saying through brother greeley now there's nothing ugly in my heart when i say that to you i say that because i want you to to receive the benefit of the word and some were quite distracted on their phones and showing the one next to them what they were seeing on their phone that might have been scripture it might have been something like that but if you find that if you look back and think back and if you realize you were distracted you got it it's right on your app all you have to do is go back and feast on the good things of the lord we don't want to miss these things we don't we want to gain all the benefit we can from god's word it's life to us zechariah 12 and verse 10 we're going to read and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born let's pray together just a moment father how we thank you today that you are the great i am you are jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever you never change you're the same your power is the same your ability to heal and to deliver is the same and you've given us so many blessings and benefits in the christian life and one of those great blessings is the gift to pour out our self before you in prayer we can bring all of our cares and all of our burdens all of our needs and even our thoughts and we can lay them before you in prayer knowing that you care knowing that you not only care but that you possess the ability to move on our behalf i dare say that most every person under the sound of my voice has been healed by your touch helped along the way by your strong extended hand ministered to in times of darkness or depression you have led us and guided us helped us to navigate through the storms of life we have so much to be thankful for so much to praise you for our hearts swell with gratefulness and gratitude for all that you mean to us in this hour we ask that you would come now around us and in us move in this place and through the stream to the nations of the world that you might reach to trinidad and south africa united arab emirates and across europe and many other places in the continent of africa and asia where there where people are joining in with us at this precise moment my god would you let the holy ghost minister there just like here and as we present our needs to you we lift up their needs as well come o god and be who you are in our lives manifest oh god every promise to us we stand on your word and thank you for your truth we ask this help and blessing in the name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory and the saint said amen you may be seated today do your best to give me undivided attention if you can because i want him to speak to you now we've already talked about zechariah 12. we were uh doing a series and i need to take you back there since camp meeting we were off this series and we were preaching about the anointing to overcome anything and everything i need to go back and finish uh the series on these seven offices of the holy ghost the spirit of god in our life and we have covered the first few and now we're almost to the end and if you still have that i would like to pull up the first four and just show them as a review this is we had this available to them on the date that we gave you there september i think it may have been the 21st or something where we listed the first four the spirit of life the spirit of truth the spirit of adoption and the spirit of holiness do you all see that there we put it up on that particular sunday maybe you would be able to find that the spirit of life that we talked about was a gift of the holy ghost or an office a position thank you of the holy ghost in our life to create or recreate the divine life of god in us and i don't ever get tired of reading or studying or meditating on the reality that i have been infused with the very life of the creator the divine life of god is living in the body of the believer not only in a spiritual way but the spirit of life the life of god the zoe life of god because it dwells in the inner man it has the ability to affect every part of who we are and every cell in our body can be transformed by the spirit of life that's what healing is a healing is when the spirit of god's divine life moves into an organ or a system of your body or an extremity of your body that is at disease that has lost its place of ease and it's now manifesting something that is causing you some difficulty or problem the very life of the creator can move this is what prayer helps do move the very life of the creator into that area of your body where you're suffering and i want you to know there's not a damaged cell or a broken system of your body or a deformed extremity that the spirit of life cannot move into and bring divine healing to you you see we believe that we have a promise not only for divine healing but we are believing for divine health we believe that if god can cause the children of israel to wander in the wilderness with divine health knowing they were in quite a rebellious place in their inner man and yet god visited them in such a way that disease was not allowed to dwell in their body hallelujah their eyes didn't wear out nothing about them waxed them they just moved in the strength of the lord from glory to glory i want to be so filled with the spirit of life that no death can abide i want to tell you something the prophet said in a little while so that no death can abide in the cells of this body hallelujah you all hear so many times we hear the testimony of how john g lake held those diseased cells in his hand and under a microscope they watched them die he wasn't as impressed as the observers was oh he said why is that such a marvel death and life cannot abide in the in the body of a child of god at the same time so life is present and death has to go and disease is a spirit of death uh it's working in the body to bring us to an end but i know that the spirit of life in us is there to create and to recreate the divine life of god in us then the holy ghost manifests himself as the spirit of truth and the spirit of truth in us brings us to a more perfect revelation of who god is oh we don't ever get to a place that we don't need the holy ghost to manifest himself as the spirit of truth we need truth in us and then number three the spirit of adoption and the whole series is available if you want to go back and look over any of these they're available to you there on the new hope revival ministries app the spirit of adoption works patiently in us aren't you glad until we can be called sons of knowledge the mature sons of god and then number four the holy ghost operates in us as the spirit of holiness causes our relationship to grow into the realization and revelation of his holiness we must be partakers of his righteousness and his holiness we can't produce much of it on our own but we are blessed with the ability to pull from his and it transforms us from the spirit of the world to the spirit of holiness my god we need that in this hour if you believe that same man that was the first four and then we are in the final three of the seven the spirit of grace and the spirit of grace governs the attitudes and actions of the believer who has learned to walk independence in independence not independence independence on the holy spirit you and i depend on him we need him to guide us and if we've ever needed grace we know now that we need not only grace but we need capstone grace grace we need double grace grace grace when that headstone came it came with shouts of grace grace to complete the stature of the perfect man christ there's no doubt about it and now we are on number six or 2 number two of the final three the spirit of supplication the spirit of supplication executes the office of prayer you see prayer is more than a give me list god is not santa claus prayer is not witchcraft you know it's a whole lot more than that prayer is communication how many of you know communication is not one way we're all better at talking than we are listening you say speak for yourself no i'm going to speak for all of us because even the quieter folk can can talk better than they listen because sometimes we're quiet but we're not really listening we're trying to decide what we're going to say if we get a chance to say may god help us to understand that prayer is not just about us telling god what we want him to do but it's about communication between our heart and him and it flows with ebbs and flows we cry out to him and he speaks back to us it's communication somebody say communication that's what prayer is it's not about demanding something or just petitioning god for something it's about coming into a place where we can hear god brother greeley was describing to me in my office before we came out about how he developed the message that he brought on tuesday night i don't know if he told it i don't know if he told it in the service or not but he said it was getting late in the afternoon nearly five o'clock and he still wasn't settled on what he was going to bring and he felt led to go and listen to a message am i telling too much he felt led to go and listen to a message and he kept listening he kept listening waiting on that inspiration to strike waiting on the leadership of the lord to know exactly what he would bring and how he would approach it and he said it was just like it was getting later and he was beginning to feel like you feel when you're not sure what to bring and maybe a little nervousness was coming and he said it was just like keep listening keep listening well what lord what lord keep listening see until that moment came and something in there began to speak right to him and he was able to put that together and bring it to you and give that to you that's what we need that's communication to be listening and hear the lord say well i'm listening but i'm not getting anything i'm i'm not receiving anything out of this and for the lord to speak into your inner being and say keep listening how many of you want a sensitive ear and a sensitive heart my my wouldn't you hate to turn off a message five minutes before god's diary wouldn't you hate to miss a message straight from god to your heart because you you grew impatient and you couldn't wait a few more minutes to hear what god wanted to say to you so even though brother greeley might not have been there praying our father who art in heaven that was prayer it was supplication it was communication with god god seeing his heart seeing a little bit of anxiousness coming on him because he knew the time was i've been there i know what that feels like brother if if you were if you were a real nervous person he could put you in a panic attack nearly but go oh it's not like we don't know something to talk about but there are those who really seek the lord and want to know what the spirit would say to the church because you may be up here bringing a message and look around and see that maybe two-thirds of the people aren't really even paying attention to what you're saying but god lets you find one in the crowd they may not be the loudest they may not be the most physical but something in their spirit is pulling on the gift and you recognize that god let every bit of that be said for one or two or three or four pulling because they had a need and they cared enough to exercise the gift that god has placed in your life you have a gift to pull on the gift that gift is faith god has given us faith to every man that's given a measure of faith that we might grow it that we might use it that we might exercise it and watch how faith can grow in our life so i loved hearing that testimony from him keep a little longer listen keep listening keep listening keep listening oh but lord i'm nearly done you might even come to pl i'm nearly done the message is nearly over and nothing has stood out to me that i can really bring and know that it's you keep listening boom or you pick up your bible it happens that way you read you flip you read you read you flip lord i really need something to speak to me i can read all day but i need something that'll minister to me speak directly to i feel something right here speak directly to my need and finally the lord just leads you maybe he starts directing your thoughts did you know god can lead us by directing our thoughts if we shut down our own ability to to overthink god if we'll just say i and this is why meditation is not an evil word unless it's used in an illegal way to meditate means to muse to to focus to to uh rehearse it in your heart and in your mind and in your spirit and and our biggest problem is the finding the time or let me say making the time to get quiet to get quiet before god and it means that we have to turn off sometime the out outward stimuli oh my i don't want to start there because i got a lot in my mind along the along those lines and i don't want to just go off on that because i have something i want to get to in just a moment so we thank god for the spirit of supplication it executes the office of prayer it governs the communication between our spirit and god now i believe and i preach that the communication is spirit to spirit and it's your spirit it's been infused it's been transformed by the spirit of god it's been joined to the lord as one spirit and i believe that's where real communication with him it ushers out of that not out of the realm of the mind and the will and the emotion but a deeper connection than that and i'll show you something along those lines in just a little while now when we introduced we only did one session as i recall on the spirit of supplication but we talked about prayer we mentioned a couple of different words that are used in the hebrew for prayer for supplication uh for that deep place of intercession and we will go back to that before we finish the spirit of supplication and move to the seventh the last office the spirit of glory but today i i want to i want to talk just a little bit about this this inner working how we are made it's not that we don't know we've been instructed before we've seen it in the word before but i felt like the lord was drawing me to just talk to you a little bit about this again and i pray that you will will receive something it starts in the first book of the bible bereshit or genesis it starts in the first chapter and the first verse of of the book of beginnings genesis 1 1 it says in the beginning god would you read it for me created in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth so we believe that this was not millions of years apart we believe that it was a part of original creation he created the heaven lease and he created the earth and it's significant because in genesis 1 26 and 27 let's refresh our mind with what those verses say and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man the next verse so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them now we know these verses and we've looked at them many many times we know for sure that man is made in the image of god so what god is he made man in that same image who knows what god is god is spirit is that right he is spirit and so when god made man he made him first spirit now i know that's disputed oh even in our own ranks they all get pretty bent out of shape when we start talking about how we are made up as a triunity or a tripartite man but the bible is specific to us there are three major parts of who we are spirit soul and body and if anyone is teaching a little difference sometime brother branham would would speak about it a little differently it's because those words even in the jewish faith those words become very interchangeable and sometimes it's a little bit difficult to really know where the spirit ends and the soul has begun or where the soul begins and the flesh has begun or right back down the line but we believe what the scripture said the scripture gives us in first thessalonians chapter 5 stay with me first thessalonians 5 verse 23 we believe that this is the new testament understanding of how man is made up and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body now if you've got any other teaching than that don't get upset just understand that the word spirit and the word soul is very close in fact i've been told by hebrew scholars there's really no differentiation in the hebrew it's only in the english that we have such a distinct understanding of how they operate different in hebrew they believe it would be very difficult to divide spirit and soul it's just their thought and how they look at things so don't get upset if you're a person who believes that on the very inside of the inside of you is soul and then spirit and then body don't don't let it become something that causes you to miss what the lord wants to say to you today or in the future so just look at it like that words in in english like hebrew can mean many different things but first thessalonians 5 23 gives us this order and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ how many of you see the tripartite man you see all three functions there spirit soul and body now john 4 24 you know this verse but write it down in case you need to go back and look over these notes john 4 24 says god is a spirit god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him how in spirit and in truth if you want your worship to matter a lot of worship goes on that doesn't shift heaven a lot of noise goes on that has no effect in the heavenly whatsoever it's not even received by a loving god because god is looking for worship that operates in spirit and in truth i want you to thank god for truth truth is a person remember it's not a doctrine truth is a person so in order to worship god in spirit and in truth we have to open up our lives and allow the holy ghost to manifest himself in us as truth i want to remind you that there is no worship on the earth that affects the heavenlies like that of the bride of jesus christ the church worships and it is noticed but the bride's worship a bridal worship is like a bridal intercession it shifts and moves things in the atmosphere like no other worship like no other intercession so once you get a revelation that you are a part of the bridal paradigm you really have a pearl of great price because then you approach god in a slightly different manner because you begin to understand you were a part of him in the beginning is anybody awake this morning now look at genesis 2 7 with me just a moment and the lord god formed man i want you to see how man was formed of the dust of the ground so man was made of the earth somebody said i don't really think it was dust i think it was i think it was just what the bible said it was dust of the ground of the earth of the adamah in hebrew red dirt that's what adama means adam was named after the red dirt and the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground and here is where the heavenly comes in the dust of the ground represented man's creation from the earthly from the dirt from the earth now here's where the heavenly comes in you see man has dual nature he carries the fingerprint of the earth and he carries the fingerprint of the heavenly the earthly and the heavenly he functions he was created to function in both realms just a moment that's powerful truth you know it but it's powerful truth because that changes prayer you don't reach up into the heavenlies as an intruder you don't move into the realm of the spirit as somebody pushing his way in you are represented in the heavenly the same way you are represented in the earthly you are made as a man as a woman from the earth and there is a part of you from the heavenly so you have this dual citizenship or dual connection both of the earth and of the spirit or of the heavenly and here's where it comes in and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life let's read that together and breathe into his the and man became a living soul he was first a body he was first flesh in the earth and then the eternal part the oldest part of who he was who he was really created to be came from the heavenly god breathed his own breath god breathed his own breath into the nostrils of man the breath of life we could say the spirit of life and what was created in man he lay there a body he received an infusion of god's spirit life by god's breath and then something was created that he didn't have he became he was created body and spirit when spirit joined with body he became a living soul he was given a mind and a will and emotions he was given five senses that allow that man to connect himself to the atmosphere and to the earth around him his spirit man is what connects him to the heavenly but it's through his soul that his body is able to find connection to the earth around us i tell you you are really really wonderfully put together god didn't want you trapped in a body that you couldn't communicate with the atmosphere around you and what goes on so he gave you mind will and emotions with five senses to do that and he joined his spirit to your spirit through the regeneration of the new birth so that you might be able to also communicate with the heavenly anytime that you need to oh my that's what prayer really is that's what communication really is it's spirit to spirit fellowship with your creator you're not praying with your mind your will and your emotions if you are you're praying religiously stay with me religion is what causes people to pray with their mind and their will and their emotions if you let your five senses dictate your prayer you're only connecting to the environment around you you're not connecting to the creator but if you let the spirit of supplication begin to operate in you by intercession by the baptism of the holy ghost then you are joined again with your creator spirit to spirit and there is no selfishness in spirit to spirit fellowship there's no emotion involved in that kind of communication how many of you are willing to admit that we often pray emotionally we get moved by our emotion and we pray out of our emotion and that's okay as long as we continue to understand there's a deeper place of prayer there's a one to one a union that is to be formed between the bridegroom and the bride a oneness a union that is to be given to the bride and the groom where prayer takes on another dimension altogether and it's not about working and striving to say the right thing anymore it's just letting the spirit man and sometimes it happens with words and sometimes it just happens with a faith pool and sometimes it happens with a language that you've never even learned on the earth but the spirit begins to groan now in in in fact this is not foreign to you i've been teaching it for years the reason why some of you look blank it's because you have yet to practice it so god is giving us another review so that we might learn there's another place in prayer for the bride of christ i'd kill my physical body if i if i strived in prayer the way that we are tempted to do sometime when we get overwhelmed with prayer request did you know you got to get up sometime you got to wash the dishes sometime somebody has to wash the dishes sometime the dishwasher whether you plug him in or you kiss him good night every night i don't know what it is the dishwasher you have to get up and go to work and yet the new testament says pray without ceasing how does somebody pray and never cease and never stop they begin to understand that there's another dimension of prayer all together you were made of the earth and you were made of the heavenly and you can pray in the earthly way mind will and emotion connecting you to your environment or you can find that place where the spirit of man transfigured transformed by his holy spirit in the new birth stays in connection and in communication with god at all times i want you to know it's your god-given right it's your privilege you can ask god anytime you can hear from god at any time the church has programmed us to believe that only certain people can hear from god then why did god give the holy ghost the holy ghost was to help you to understand you can hear from god and we have you but i'm afraid brother i'm afraid i'm afraid it won't be god aren't you glad you have an absolute word aren't you glad you can take it right back to the bible it must line up god will never tell you that's why when people come around and tell me that god is leading them to wife number three how do you know because god told me he did not he didn't god is not going to tell you anything contrary to his word if you're a widow or a widower of course these things are we're not talking about that we're talking about people moving from one to the next it's so accepted in the hour that we live in that it waters down the sanctity of marriage and it causes young people not maybe not consciously but at least subconsciously to think if i don't get it right the first time [Music] there'll be another time somebody else will love me and so forth and etcetera i don't want you get so tight unless there are some of you contemplating something you want not to be contemplating i don't know why people get so quiet it's absolutely the truth god is not going to lead you or tell you or talk to you to do something that is contrary to his word so you don't have to be afraid of his voice you just take anything you hear in the spirit even even in the spirit you take it right back to the word your spirit is not the absolute his word is the absolute so you just take it right back and see if it lines up and then you can say i've heard from god now is there forgiveness of course you know all of this yes there's forgiveness now and the lord god for man of the dust of the ground breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul could we look at that in the amplified it says then the lord god formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath or spirit of life and man became a living being it was not just the body not just the spirit coming but it was spirit coming in to occupy the body that formed a connection your soul connects your spirit and your body your spirit has direct communication with god your soul allows your body to have connection with the physical environment around you and what we've got to understand as believers is that we move too much by what we have perceived in the soul mind will and emotion instead of moving by what we are picking up discerning hearing in the spirit i'll tell you most of us if we receive a signal from the soul and one from the spirit it's going to be different but this is not the will of god god is working on us i believe it was john g lake or either watchmene who said that your spirit has been saved your soul is being saved your mind will and emotions are struggling but you're getting there and your body will be saved there's not a part of you that's going to be lost salvation is for the tripartite man i'm pretty sure that was watchmen knee you can look that up if you want to understand some of these things you'd be good it bless you i know it would bless you i've recommended it before in the book called the latent power of the soul there are some very very interesting things that may not be quite the title but you can find it by that there are some interesting things that help us to understand the struggle that takes place sometime and the effort that is required to make sure we're moving out of our mind remember brother branham said you you say well i don't feel that that's from the realm of the mind the will and the emotion so he said what does that matter what does it matter what you feel he said the word goes forth and somebody said well i think such-and-such and he said what do you what does it matter what you think it's not what you think it's not what i think it's what god says right so we have to move the thinker and we have to move some of the will hopefully crucify it get it completely out of the way so that we can hear from the spirit of god he speaks to us that amplified listen i found one translation that does a really good job instead of saying and man became a living being it says and man became another speaking spirit before that only one spirit was speaking now man in god's image is made and he also has the ability to speak not only from his mind will and emotions soul realm but he has the ability because of god's breath in him the holy ghost he has the ability to speak from the spirit realm and become another speaking spirit now how many of you'd like to do a lot more talking from the from the new spirit that's been created in you than from the from the old nature from the mind from the will i hope i'm not confusing you i don't see how i possibly could be since we've gone through these things so many times before so be reminded now as we move on that man is made or created from two realms heaven and earth one part from god who is spirit the other part dust which is of the earth and this is why matthew 6 9 and 10 is so important this was how we prayed this is how i pray often and have encouraged you to pray often after this manner therefore pray matthew 6 9-10 our father which art in heaven hallowed holy set apart be thy name and what's next in earth in earth now we have this treasure in earth and vessels we're not just asking god's will to be done on planet earth we're asking god's will to be done in those of us who were created from earth and also from the heavenlies thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven i tell you if you don't pray in tongues you have no guarantee unless you're led by the spirit of intercession in supplication to pray the right thing but i want you to know this is the right prayer in all situations thy will be done on earth or in earth as it is in heaven you know that's really a bringing the two realms back together how many of you know that's powerful thought to bring the heavenly realm right into the earthly realm i don't know about you but i've stood in the middle i've been in a place on an occasion or two where heaven came present in earth's realm things look different when heaven is among us it takes an atmosphere for heaven to come among us heaven is sensitive the heavenly realm the spirit realm is sensitive like the dove and the least little bit of disturbance will keep that that presence above us instead of with us brother branham talked about that gentle dove of the holy spirit so easily offended so easily uh disturbed and he said he would just take his flight like a little bird out the window and perch on a tree over there i won't i do not believe that the holy ghost leaves the believer i don't believe that's what he's talking about i believe he's talking and teaching us about atmosphere one little wrong spirit brought into the house of god one little wrong attitude and brother we we never have a service without them because we're human beings and because some people do not see their need to correct their spirit and so there's always that disturbance and so it becomes such an effort sometime to bring heaven in and that's why worship becomes so important and that's why the enemy is against worship preach brother that's why the devil hates worship that's why the devil targets worship leaders because he knows there's a power in that place to bring heaven into the atmosphere of earth and when heaven comes down in the very presence of the heavenly comes and manifests itself in our house you heard the prophet say you heard jesus say all things are possible in that atmosphere death can't live in that atmosphere that's the atmosphere of resurrection and so that's why all of the enemy's guns are trained on worship and why the enemy wants to intimidate you to worship and that's why some of you look around one of these days you're going to hate me because i i wonder sometime how long it'll be before i just say hey quit looking at him quit look at it higher look to the lord don't you look to see how they're worshiping all right gotta do is go back watch the app you can see how people act just go back and watch a video of the service but while you're in here don't look down the end of your row to see how your family is worshiping you'll miss your touch you'll miss your opportunity to communicate with the spirit realm anything and everything can take you out that's why it's so important and the musicians that's why it's beautiful when they're willing to come a little early it doesn't always work out all the sour notes there may still be the opportunity that they're not flowing together but they're trying when they come together like that and they put their hearts together they're trying with everything they can to stay together as much as possible because they understand it if they don't they need to understand i believe they've heard and they understand that the least little bit that's why we singers when we're singing a song brother greely or myself or any of the rest of you leading a service ben or benjamin whoever how it's we hate it so much i do and i know they do when we start off in a wrong key it doesn't always affect things but we know there's the potential that something is innocent and small as that can disturb the atmosphere in such a way that it just takes so much effort and labor to get people's minds back on what we're singing and what we're doing that's why some people be better off to wear blindfold in worship no wonder people are tempted to close their eyes when they worship sometimes because it's so much easier to block out everything around you what are you doing brother sister you're building an atmosphere because you've got a need who came here this morning somebody's going to help me preach before we're done who came here today with a need in your life all of us all of us came with a need and the answer to that is here the help that you need is here because we've come together in his name but we let this and that and the other why i've seen eight or ten people sometimes maybe 12 people looking somewhere else in the room to see how somebody else is taking the atmosphere or how they're reacting to the atmosphere or how they're worshiping why do you care why do you care it's the enemy trying to distract you from getting what you need i'll tell you what i do i encourage you if you're uncomfortable where you are let's really get a stink stirred up change seats so everybody where you were sitting can thank you move because of them whoa we'll have a real revival here cause everybody be mad at each other i know why she moved she moved because she thought i was a hindrance why don't you get above all that don't you be stuck nowhere don't you be stuck anywhere in this house where you can't worship the lord and don't blame nobody for you don't blame nobody else it may be you you just can't keep your eyes off of something else so you find you a place where you don't have to look at nobody oh my i wonder where that'd be closer you get the less you have to deal with if it was up to me i'd close off the last three or four rows of the church i'd shut them down and force people to get closer there's something about being together and getting up there and eliminating some of the hindrances that people allow things they allow it's on us it's on us don't blame other people it's on us but we if you could just shut some of that out and get in a place where nothing bothered you like that if a sour note was hit or a song you don't like was sung you just wouldn't even that wouldn't even be a speed bump in the road you just keep right on entering in to his presence until your spirit could reach out and have direct communication with the one who created you my i believe this is part of what god wants us to do now in that verse 7 that word breath there and god for man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath that word breath means movement of air and it also means the breathing of god this was god breathing on adam in adam that word soul became a living soul that's the nephesh and it means a living being and then the phrase breathe the breath of life if you look at that in the literal it really means blow a blast of breath so god blew a blast of breath into a dead lifeless body that had been yet made in the image of the creator yet it lay there dead we might say it like brother branham all the mechanics were there lungs were there heart was there all the systems of the body there but no dynamics it took the breath of god breathing life it took the dynamics joining with the mechanics to make adam a living soul a living being who could be completely in tune with his creator while being completely in tune with his environment not one disturbing the other communication or connection but all functioning properly now you know this would be a good place to just insert this little teaching that we came into some years ago where you have to determine what part of you you're feeding and most of us do pretty good at feeding the flesh sometimes we're feeding the soul because we're we're yielding to the mind and to the will and to the emotion and we love to get in the middle of a stink some people thrive on conflict help me preach some people really come alive when there's turmoil and well you know what that does that feeds the soul the mind the will the more they just get bigger and bigger and bigger but you know we're not supposed to be working on that we're supposed to be working on feeding the spirit and there's nothing that feeds the spirit but the word of god the word of god is what feeds the spirit and we have to listen you can't survive on sunday morning and tuesday night i'm telling you now we're in the last of the last days you'll not survive if you only eat your for your spirit man two little measly times a week you gotta feed the spirit man you've got to hear the spiritual food that has been stored up for us god's grace to us now there's a lot of question now about whether or not we need the fivefold ministry we do if we want to get on the other side of until as long as we're satisfied to live on this side of until that's okay but if we ever want to get on the other side of until we've got to see the proper functioning of the apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist in the earth they may not all sit in the local body that would be perfection and we would very much love to see that but in the body of christ those offices must be represented they have a job to do and that's the only thing the bible said the scripture said could get us on the other side of until is the proper operation of the fivefold ministry now that does not mean that that's all we need we need the word that god has sent to prepare a bride and that's why we feed on the message that god has given us the message of the hour because we know that god uses that in very supernatural ways to talk to us 60 70 years later why is it so perfect like that because god stored it that way so that you may be going through something 75 years after a sermon was preached but you put it in and it describes exactly where you're standing in that hour that is not coincidence that is not happenstance is anybody helping me that's god's ordained way to keep us on the right track amen it sure is now we got to move along just one o'clock though i haven't been preaching very long not yet but i i'll hurry maybe now ephesians 1 10 talks about again this coming together of earth in heaven that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in jesus is the place in jesus is the position in jesus is where heaven and earth meet it's in jesus somebody say in jesus it's in him it's in messiah if you use this yeshua it's in yeshua it's being found in him and remember there's a portion of your soul that will keep you out of him so that's why the mind has to be constantly sanctified and disciplined by the spirit but if you're feeding the soul the soul becomes like the sumo wrestler if you're not feeding the spirit the spirit becomes like a stick man and how many of you know a stick man it's not likely to overcome a sumo wrestler so what we have to do is starve the soul stay out of the mind win that battle with the word you can't you can't you know divorce yourself from the mind it's a it's a gift of god you've got to exchange your mind for for his mind his mind is not the mind from the realm of soul his mind is the mind of the spirit so when you replace your natural mind with the mind of christ you're really moving back to who you were created to be in the beginning that's exactly right and so you want to feed the spirit man and the word and the atmosphere of glory is what feeds the spirit man i don't have to tell you what feeds the soul man everything that's not of god will feed the mind and the will and the emotions i have told you before your soul is not your enemy your mind is not your enemy your will is not your enemy your emotions are not your enemy but if they're not sanctified and led by the spirit if you follow the leadership of that instead of the leadership of the spirit it'll get you into conflict it'll cause world war iv to break out right inside of here and you don't have to struggle that way because god's made a way for the things that are in heaven and the things that are in earth to come together in christ and for you to sit right there in christ and have the peace that you need to continue are you with me so then in ecclesiastes 12 7 look there i want to make sure you have the word ecclesiastes 12 7. this is when we come to the end of life then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it it doesn't mention the part of the of you that's made up of mind will and emotions the bible says the soul that sinneth shall surely die i know there's a lot of people that don't understand that the scripture means what it says and says what it means there's a part of you that lives forever but there is a part of you that you won't always need when we lay that body down there at the graveyard that body that contains soul and spirit that body is going to go back to the dust where it came from but the spirit doesn't lay there in the grave so when you go out there and chat you're just talking to dirt you're just talking to ashes you're not talking to the spirit the real man the real woman that you laid there you're i mean it's all right if that helps you in some way as long as you don't do it at halloween time but i know sometimes we go out and we say oh i wish you could see the mess your youngins have made [Laughter] i know people do that but i want you to know there's nothing there to hear you i hope you don't think that the spirit of a man lingers in the cemetery i don't believe in spooks do you the spirit goes back it returns to god who gave it it moves into another dimension one of these days it's going to swing down pick up a new body right it's a new body that's coming out of that grave not the old one but a new one so in the end our body goes back to dirt our spirit goes back to god to give it now dust in scripture for those of you who are still bearing able to stay with me dust in scripture is typical of the carnal nature of man or the flesh nature adam's flesh was made from the dust the curse upon the serpent was what that he would crawl on his belly the all the days of his life and eat dust so when we see dust representing the fallen nature of man or the flesh nature of man and we hear the beast the serpent beast that yielded itself to satan the serpent wasn't satan the serpent was a beast that was was utilized occupied by satan but the beast had to bear a curse at one time by this language we are safe to say at one time what we would call a serpent walked upright or else it wouldn't be a curse to make it lay down on the ground and eat the dust so we don't know exactly what it looked like brother branham described it as looking very much like a man but having no soul i wasn't there but i think that's as good of a description as anybody could ever think of but i know that when it when it yielded itself to satan and spoke on behalf of satan and communicated for satan the enemy the fallen angel then we know that it was cursed and it was made to crawl a slither on its belly and eat dust and that signifies that that satan was to feed on the carnal nature of man now i want to tell you something satan is feasting on the carnal nature of man you let there be a carnal nature present and satan will utilize every advantage he will take every opportunity he can to stir in that carnal nature if you've got a carnal part of you that's still alive satan will stir in that he will open doors for you did you know that satan can open door he will open doors and opportunities for you to to yield yourself to that kind of a nature things that you're not even looking for will come looking for you if you're walking in that fallen nature or living out of that carnal nature now satan's dominion over man is perpetuated by man's carnal nature and through the ages one of satan's most successful tactics for robbing god's people of their inheritance has been for him to offer immediate gratification for their flesh in the same way that the holy spirit might anoint you in spirit the enemy will anoint your flesh he will utilize the fallen nature of your flesh and offer you instant gratification don't sit there like you don't know what i said you know exactly what i said he will put an opportunity before you that you will find a struggle to resist you can't say you don't know where it came from it came from the enemy but how did it touch you it touched you because of an unresolved issue in your carnality you see there are churches that teach that lust is something that we can control and just and just keep it under under wrap but i want you to know that's not what the scripture teaches us about lust it's not just something that you push down it's something that you've got to crucify it's something that you've got to nail on the cross it's something that you've got to fight against with everything the spirit gives you to fight with until you win the victory over that as long as you allow lust to be an unresolved issue in your life satan will use that issue he will use that door he will use that window and he will put things in front of you you'll be checking the weather and the enemy will place something right there in front of you people make fun of brother branham a little bit when he talks about things like that but if jesus was tempted in every manner of sin as we are yet without sin we shouldn't find it so difficult to understand that brother branham was also a man somebody somebody might say a warm-blooded man he had a lovely wife but brother branham said any more you walk down you drive down the street and you see these women standing out there he said you can hardly tell if they're on the inside fighting to get out or the outside fighting to get in more cotton in an aspirin bottle he said if if if eating apples is what caused adam and eve to discover that they were naked somebody better pass the apples because somebody's not been eating any apples because people go you let me tell you something you don't have to go to the beach to meet that not anymore you can go to walmart you can see somebody's rear end hanging out of their shorts at walmart now what you're going to do if you leave that unresolved issue and you don't deal with that thing i mean actively fight that thing and let the blood of jesus christ be applied to that and let the word of god address that and keep coming back to him and and swallowing your pride sometime and walking up here and standing in the in an altar or kneeling in an altar and confessing that that thing is trying to destroy your life somebody said if i confess that it'll destroy your marriage i'm here to tell you if you don't confess that your marriage might be destroyed anyway brother branham believed in being honest with our companions and with our spouses and he believed in making that right and most of you know that there was a couple that worshiped god here all those years until they both died still in the faith still in this church and when that man heard the message and accepted the message he had been a soldier and had served in the military and he had more than one woman on the side and when he came to the lord he sat down and told his wife who quite honestly struggled to forgive him because she was a human just like he was but he could not allow that thing to fester in him and he heard the prophet say you go make that thing right now i don't know how you feel about this but i admire it he sat his wife down and told her his sins she knew that he had been serving sin he told her his sins and that he had come she knew that he had changed she knew that he had come to the lord and he said there's a few women i want you to go with me to visit she'd already come to the lord what there's a few women that i want you to go with me in some required out-of-town trip and she said whatever for he said i've been unfaithful oh it's quiet aren't you glad nobody in here needs this kind of preaching aren't you glad we can keep it in the past because nobody here will need this if i were to believe that i would have no explanation for the dead silence somebody needs to hear how would you have liked to have been there not me i'm i'm a nosy person but i would not want to be in the room when you walk when you knock on a door and ring a doorbell and you're standing there and the woman that you've had an affair against your wife is standing there opening the door and there you stand with your wife with a smile on your face my nice to see you it's been 15 years or however long it's been and you go and sit down in the living room and you say to that woman i have come i've repented to god i have repented to my wife and now i'm here to repent to you i want you to forgive me i knew what i was doing was wrong what would you call that i'd call that a real repentance i'd call it somebody shutting doors slamming windows doing everything within his own power to try to put that thing to rest come on now that doesn't mean it was never a problem or never rose up or the enemy never tried or that he never had another thought but what it means is he was doing everything actively that he possibly could to make sure that satan couldn't be stirring his finger talk about getting out of your past it would do some folk good oh my satan's dominion over man is perpetuated by man's carnal nature through the ages one of satan's most successful tactics for robbing god's people of their inheritance has been to offer them the immediate gratification of their flesh and this is why putting pornography in people's hands by the way of a smartphone is such a dangerous and slippery slope and one more time let me encourage you as parents who have children in your home regardless of their age if they live in your home you have a right and not only a right you have a responsibility to monitor what they do on social media i wished i had some help come on because there are so many now it's not just facebook it's instagram it's tick-tock tick-tock what whatsapp they're those those apps i don't remember but you could tell me what they are but some of them are set up in such a way that after a little while snapchat was one of them they got some folks in trouble around here you can put a picture or video or or a statement i guess and and after a certain time it disappears why would somebody get involved in something like that except for the fact they only wanted certain people to see it that's dangerous business there's young people associated with this church that are dibbling in things they should be very very careful about and parents please please do your best i know it's hard but please do your best to monitor these things if you're going to allow it you have a responsibility to do your best to monitor it someone recently showed me a a a social post from someone a young person associated this church questioning their sexuality this is serious business and parents may not even know that it's going on we've got to know that old serpent he's still licking the dust satan is still stirring in those areas where the carnal nature is not dealt with he's looking for doors and windows and opportunities i see men in this church from time to time looking at women in a way you should not be looking at a woman you need to do something about that for multiple reasons a spiritual man serious serious business don't push me i'm telling you this morning don't push me i've watched it i've watched young men in this church watch women walking up the aisle do you ever say anything i have more than once but i'm not the holy ghost you're responsible for your wandering eye why brother branham said the way they stand on the corner the way they're out like that now dress the way they dress they look like a skinned down wiener for those of you that don't know that's what we used to call a hot dog and what i grew up calling is even worse than that i grew up calling it a weenie and people say that's just a terrible thing to say but that's that's what a hot dog was to me and brother branham was talking about those you know how the casing of of a hot dog would be he said they stand there looking like a like a skin down weiner he said so i just put this cross i'll hang it on my rear view mirror anybody listening i hang it on my rear view mirror in such a way that if i should glance and see a woman like that dressed on the street i immediately that causes you to lose confidence in him you're just kind of off balance there aren't you he said i just immediately turn my eyes to the cross and i remember what jesus has done for me brother sister let me tell you it's not worth it to yield yourself to a moment of gratification of this flesh and lose what you've tried to gain the ground that you've gained in serving the lord it's not worth it to throw it all away for just a moment like that we can have the victory i wish somebody would agree that we can have the victory over all of those things man is a spirit will you put that up do you see that that slide man is a spirit who has a soul and lives in a body that's it man is a spirit who has a soul mind will and emotions and lives in a body physical flesh that's who you are and that's why we read a moment ago first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the lord jesus christ now sometimes it appears that what's going on in the spirit and what's going on in the soul can be so close together that it's hard to know is this of god or is this of me but how many of you are glad the word has given us an answer show show the people hebrews 4 12 and i'm nearly finished it's pretty quiet it's okay no quite it's okay it's all right for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit is this me is this god is this my desire is this god's desire for me is this my thought is this god's thought is this my own leadership or is this the spirit of god leading me what is the remedy what is the answer what is the help how do we get to that place if there's a blurring if there's a time or a situation in our life where we're just not sure if this is god's leadership or if this is my own will my own desire my own maybe even in prayer we get messed up sometime because we're praying our will and when you're praying your will for somebody else that's an illegal form of witchcraft that's not intercession when you're trying to manipulate somebody with your prayer and brother i get stuck in not knowing how to pray just like you do that's why i go back to the lord and go back to his example in prayer and pray what he prayed because sometimes we don't know but if we get to that place where we're not exactly sure guess what the answer is the word of god the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow that's part of the body the flesh and is a discerner the word of god the word of god the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents the intentions of the heart how many of you are thankful for the word i'm thankful for the word some of you aren't thankful some of you can't raise your hand i'm thankful i'm thankful for the word of god proverbs 20 27 in closing the spirit of man is the candle of the lord the spirit of man is the candle the light of the lord this is the this is the spirit that's been joined to the lord this is the regenerated the human spirit that has been regenerated by the divine this is what the holy ghost does in us i thought you were preaching on supplication and prayer i am but sometimes we've got to get some things in order and understanding before we can discover how we're really praying and what gift is being offered to us in prayer you can get right above your flesh you can get right above your soul and you can let your prayers come from the inner part of who you are the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly and that word belly is a word that means the innermost being the inward part even the heart not the blood pump but the heart of man what's at the very root the inside of the inside of man which is spirit the spirit of man is the candle of the lord god uses that to search us to speak to our hearts to correct us to steer us to guide us i want to read a paragraph to you before we close actually i've got a few quotes i'm going to give you two 129. let me hurry how many of you have ever read anything by the author gene edwards gene edwards wrote a marvelous book called the divine romance you say oh that don't sound like a good it's a good one it helped me so much to understand god's love for me that's his bride he wrote a series of books one about creation one about the exodus one about the resurrection of jesus he wrote wrote some interesting things and this was a paragraph from his book of creation god came to man in the lowlands of the earth realm he breathed into the man so magnificently formed of the earth he breathed into him the spiritual realm the life-giving winds of heaven the breath of divinity i'm already hooked that's marvelous language so marvelous that i'm going to read it again for you that weren't listening the first time god came to man in the lowlands of the earth realm he breathed into the man so magnificently formed of the earth he breathed into him the spiritual realm the life-giving winds of heaven the breath of divinity out from the mouth of the almighty creator came a brilliant dazzling sparkling effervescence like living stars that surged with divine power into the nostrils of adam and flowed through his body and soul permeating every cell of his being the wind that spirit that breath that celestial air that divine and heavenly life animated the clay model creating within a dimensionless quality condition and state of being how many of you find that marvelous i don't care i'm not even going to ask you i find that marvelous it's something i can see i can see that divine life of god and his divine light flowing into the nostrils of a lifeless body of clay laying there and that man being permeated every cell of his body with the living life of the creator talk about being alive adam was never any more alive than he was in that very moment that the breath of god came rushing in hallelujah making him a living soul i have to read this for some that are battling in a message diseases and afflictions paragraph 42 and satan is against you anybody want to say amen that's a good thing that's a good thing therefore this cancer he starts or this tumor whatever it is from a germ [Music] he begins to multiply like a tumor becomes malignant so forth now brother branham is telling us something about how satan spreads himself and multiplies himself at vulnerable places in our life he is comparing it to the life of a tumor to the life of a cancer this is not what everybody believes but i believe it i believe this i believe that cancer has a life i believe that cancer is a spirit and it has a life and it has to be dealt with that way [Music] it's not just a disease it's not just a sickness but it's an entity it's a trespasser it has no right in the body of the believer somebody said well what if we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray and it can't be dealt with we keep praying we keep speaking against it we keep treating it like a trespasser and a squatter and an invader we don't ever call it ours we don't ever own it it's belonging to us and we ask that the resurrection life of jesus christ come and deal with it like he would any other death like he would any other spirit so i want you to see this brother branham he's talking about the work of satan and how he spreads himself and multiplies himself in our lives but he's using cancer or a tumor as an example he said it's a body just like you're of a body it has a spirit just like you are a spirit only it has not a soul it's not a human being it's not tripartite it has a body a cluster of cells it has a spirit that gives it life but it does not have a soul interesting isn't it it's actually how demons operate they are they are bodyless spirits that cannot be nearly as effective unless they occupy a body i'm not telling you they can't affect things they can shift a room they can shift the atmosphere of a room though they hang in no body no no physical form you can be aware of a presence knowing that it's a demonic spirit or an oppressive spirit and it's not in someone it just comes into the room as a disembodied spirit and we pray against that and we deal with that and i'm not talking about ghosts i'm talking about demon spirits that once upon a time had a body to live in and they no longer do but they have no soul they function more effectively when they find something to get in it doesn't have to be a human being it can be an animal somebody said you're getting a little weird and i don't have to tell you the the domestic species that brother branham seem to think those spirits like to get in more than others but i will tell you it wasn't a dog anything can carry a spirit your hamster can it's looking for a body to get in but brother branham talks it like this let's stay with a quote it has a spirit just like you our spirit only it has not a soul but it has a life like you have a life cancer has a life like you have a life interesting isn't it well it's it operates in the cells he said and therefore then in you in your flesh there's two lives this makes me mad when i read this this makes me mad [Music] maybe this is what's missing maybe we're not mad enough at the devil for what he's trying to do in our body this makes me mad he said therefore in your flesh there's two lives one one are you one is you and the other one is another being multiplying cells growing a body just like you growed in a body is that right now if you understand that at all it can change your approach to the enemy placing something in you and giving it a foreign life we've been told and i give you the instance a few minutes ago that's not supposed to be able to dwell in you we know that god has the power there are two ladies in here this morning that are facing something like that and we're not going to accept anything but total deliverance one knows that there's something cancerous present one knows there's something there not sure exactly what it is until the biopsy is done and we're saying today it doesn't matter whether it's cancer or non-cancer even if it's just a tumor even if it's just a collection of cells it may be that the enemy is trying to work on you because where does that stuff work on us do you know it's not the body it works on the body but that's not where the battle is you know good and well you can live without an arm you can live without a certain organs of your body you know that this this thing is a mind battle and when you hear the word the big you know the enemy loves his he loves to stick his foot in your door and say [Laughter] let me put something on you that you have no control of what a dummy what a dumb thing to say yes you do have power yes you do have authority on the trespassing enemy who lays a foreign life in your body a spirit that is not your spirit that has been transformed by the holy spirit but a life and the spirit that's there we know why it's there can i just tell you why it's there it's there to destroy you it might be three cells or it might be the tumor or size of a grapefruit it doesn't matter the size it's there to destroy you oh i feel excited you mean to tell me you're talking about something like that and you feel excited oh yes because i just heard in my spirit man brother branham describing that that tumor that was trying to take over sister mita's body he's down here in shreveport louisiana preaching for brother jack moore and sister branham goes to the last she goes to her last uh place her last examination by the doctor because that tumor was getting so large it was laying over her skin it was laying over and making a place that could be felt physically with a hand and the word of the lord fell on the prophet and god was dealing with him about the power of the spoken word and the word of the lord fell on the prophet and he prophesied before the doctor's hand touches that tumor it'll disappear that's what just that's what just dropped down in my spirit so any opportunity that god has to show himself god can excite us it doesn't have to destroy us emotionally it can thrill us to know that it's a great opportunity for jesus christ to make himself the same [Music] yesterday and today and forever are you still here hallelujah i want to read another one i'm closing this is from the message believing god paragraph 93 thank you and that soul is the same way until the soul died and then was born again of god then that soul can't die i don't believe in two souls i don't believe that god takes one soul and gives you another soul i have many friends who believe that i don't believe that that fits the continuity of scripture but i believe the nature of that soul dies in the new birth i believe the very inner being inner working the very nature of that soul dies and the resurrection life of jesus christ comes in his great ability to recreate and to regenerate that's what resurrection does it regenerates and recreates and so if your spirit is changed it has to bring a change to your soul life as well and that soul is the very same way until the soul died and then was born again of god then that soul can't die the soul that sinneth shall die that's what the scripture said and i'm there but he that believeth on me has everlasting life we're just all we're trying to say is that there's no everlasting life there is no eternal life in any other form or fashion than that which is given by the lord jesus christ satan cannot give you everlasting life hell can't give you everlasting life cannot alright he goes on the soul that sinneth shall die but he that believeth on me has everlasting life then there is an immortal life living in that body whoop he said now that's like a stream coming from heaven like a core on the inside of a man now that's the part that's godly that operates the body this body but before this body can ever become perfected the spirit will bring in it or it in the spirit will bring it in submission to god to make you see the spirit is working to bring the mind and the will and the emotion into submission to god which then calls the flesh into submission you work just like just like thessalonians says it works the same order here i just can't imagine what comments i'm getting from those who see it in a different order i hope you won't let that confuse you and miss the point of what god's trying to do he said but before this body can ever become perfected the spirit will bring it in submission to god to make you it'll war all the time a constant paul said we'll never get more than he see paul said when i would do good then evil is near me see and that's a constant war the flesh against the spirit the flesh against the spirit and here you go looking to the flesh the doctor said i believe looks how look how sinful then you can't serve god you've got to throw aside your senses god never give you those senses to trust him with god didn't give you five senses to contact god he gave you five senses to contact the earth around you you wouldn't you couldn't see without that that's your that's your a way to see to hear to think to smell to taste to touch he said god never give you those senses to trust him with god give you his spirit to trust him your sense is only to contact see taste feel smell and hear but to

there are needs that god is ministering to as we sing i believe the lord is doing something here and i don't want to prolong but i don't want to push you out either i just believe that somebody's faith is reaching up right now to take a hold i know brother greeley worked for you and with you while i was away but i just felt like that he might find a place to lead us to pray over us right now that god would just seal what he's beginning to try to do in our bodies and in our lives may somebody find grace and strength to step away from what the enemy is using to beat them down with if we could just turn our eyes to calvary look upon what the lord has done on our behalf not allow the enemy to draw our attention to other things we can have the victory when you're finished just dismiss us hallelujah offer prayer however you feel brother i want god to seal something right now hallelujah [Music] lord you have once again come and reminded us from your word that we are a tripartite man [Music] spirit soul and body and oh we know that we have an accuser and a tormentor who comes to try to pull us away from the spirit of the living god that dwells inside of us but you in your faithfulness have come and reminded us that the soul this the mind the will and the emotions it's not our enemy but oh lord how that you by the spirit desire to sanctify us to cleanse us holy completely spirit soul and body and lord you were right here in your presence today and you're dealing with us oh god and you're showing us and you're revealing to us by the spirit of the living god how that we have allowed the soul to rule us to to so motivate us but oh god our spirit man has been has been lacking it's been starving because we've not been feeding the spirit man properly but oh god as you we stand in your presence today and you're talking to us lord you're dealing with us you're showing us lord things have been laid upon the table that we've tried to hide that we've tried to push down you brought them and laid them back up on the table and lord i believe that you have a surgeon's knife that is able to accurately meticulously to carve those things out of our lives and so lord whoever may be here today all of us lord we can we can say that's me but god i believe that you are specifically dealing with men and women in this congregation perhaps those on the stream also but god as you are laying that thing upon the table revealing it once again may it once and for all be dealt with by the spirit of the living god [Music] oh lord you are king you are surgeon you know how to deal with these things oh lord better than any physician better than any doctor better than any prescription that has ever been written or filled in all of time god you know how best to deal with these things [Music] now lord whatever it may be any stubbornness that we put forth any rebellious part of our character that we have put forth to say no that's not me anyway god that we have put forth an effort to deny what has been spoken today that it doesn't apply to us god i pray that you would just continue by your spirit to pull that thing down and expose it piece by piece by piece in the name of jesus christ [Music] lord we're asking you to seal the word into our heart into our innermost being [Music] god as we face this week with all of its humps and bumps and and all of the ways that the enemy is already plotted to try to stump us and to to trip us up god i pray that this word would be sealed in even at this moment and at what time we don't know how to react to the enemy that comes to us that this word will come up and out of us and that we will use this word against our enemy to put him in his place and that we would find ourselves overcoming anything that the enemy places in our path to stumble us lord i thank you that you are the victor and that you live inside of us and that you have not taken your holy spirit from us but oh lord we are asking that reinforcements would come that there would be a greater refilling overflowing of your spirit inside of us that anything that we face lord any circumstance any drama that would come god that we would face it by the spirit of the lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray your blessing on this people that are in this congregation as well as those that have been watching this service i pray god that you will walk in them as the victor this week lord restore strength and energy and health into our pastor we bless him in the name of jesus christ now lord we give you all glory and all
