[0:00] and in my mind I am being restored but
[0:03] in God's mind I have been restored
[0:20] because salvation is one thing
[0:22] redemption is another how many of you
[0:25] know that call upon the name of the Lord
[0:28] whosoever calling upon the name of the
[0:30] Lord shall be what saved but there is a
[0:33] work of redemption that is my election
[0:36] it is by God's foreknowledge and it's
[0:40] more than just calling on the name of
[0:42] the Lord being say it's being taken all
[0:45] the way back to God's original perfect
[0:48] thoughts about you boy I can see a lot
[0:54] of imperfection in myself can't you and
[0:56] God choose this when he looks at me he
[0:59] chooses not to see that imperfection he
[1:03] chooses to see what he saw about me in
[1:05] the beginning my that's mercy my that is
[1:09] grace that is boundless love that is
[1:13] love that would tear down every lie and
[1:16] bring down every mountain and shine
[1:19] light in every darkness
[1:23] is that God chooses to look beyond our
[1:28] present condition many times and see us
[1:32] in his perfection because that's what
[1:34] the work of redemption is about to
[1:37] restore us and in my mind I am being
[1:41] restored but in God's mind I have been
[1:44] restored in my mind I'm still fighting
[1:51] the battle in his mind I've won the war
[1:57] [Music]
