TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steph Shelly and you're watching the Eagle's cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and over the course of the last few weeks we have been studying the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future we believe that God has promised a resending of the spirit and power of Elijah multiple times throughout scripture and we're going to be talking more about our subject in just a few minutes I want to remind you that it is my honor and privilege to join with you in prayer over any prayer request that you might have and if you would like to contact us to share your prayer needs the information is given to you on the screen and it would be a delight to hear from you to know that you're there that you're watching and that you have enough confidence in us that you would give us that privilege of joining with you in faith and believing that God will meet your needs there's one thing that I know by experience and that is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not if he ever healed the sick and my Bible tells me that he did then I believe that he still heals the sick today if he ever delivered the oppressed and the possessed and my Bible tells me that he did then I have to believe that he is just as able to bring deliverance and freedom and liberty today as he ever was he just simply does not change so whatever your needs are give them to the Lord and if you need some help if you need some prayer support then we would be more than happy to help you I'm coming to you today from the sanctuary of our church New Hope Revival ministries uh we are in a little Community called smiss Station Alabama and we just we just thank God over and over again for the opportunity that he's given us to be able to minister to you this way I want us to get right into to our study today and our theme for this study is found in the Book of Malachi and uh I I think think I'll just read that again and refresh your memory Malachi 4: 5 and 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and we've established thus far in this study uh that we believe on more than one occasion God has sent the spirit and power of Elijah into the Earth at a particular time when the Earth was positioned because of the rebellion of the people because of the uh leaving the faith you know the apostate condition of the Earth the need for a deliverer for a savior uh for an Awakening to to the Savior that had already come God sent the spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the hearts of the people to receive another installment of what God wanted to do in the earth we see that that anointing and and power was on Elijah the prophet then Elisha uh who who came after Elijah we find out from scripture and we'll look at that later that John the Baptist came in that same power same anointing Same Spirit it appears that uh a promise was made concerning the end time the end of the leodan church age where another installment of the spirit and power of Elijah was poured out into the Earth and it looks like we are being positioned with what's going on in the Earth right now and the Fulfillment of scripture before our eyes it looks like we are being positioned for another this time hope y a corporate pouring out of the spirit and power of Elijah upon the remnant bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and then the scriptures foretell even another installment perhaps a final installment that will take place in one of the two witnesses that are promised to preach in the streets of Jerusalem and we can you can read about that in Revelation 11 and also in the book of Zechariah these two promised Olive branches in order for us to be able to identify and understand the spirit and power of Elijah we uh feel like the best place to start is examining the life of the original Elijah we'll call it that way the prophet of the Bible the one that we read about in First Kings and and second Kings and so we were looking at his characteristics and number one we discovered that he was a Wilderness man he he did not uh despise that alone time that being separated unto the Lord so that he could quiet himself so that he could shut out some of the noise of the other voices around him and lean heavy into the Lord to hear the voice of the Lord to hear instruction and at times he appeared to others as a loner but uh it was it was necessary and God led him we studied in The Last Broadcast to the brook cherith which is separated it means separated and when that uh I want to say that uh uh episode of his life that portion of his life was fulfilled he moved on to the Widow of zarap and we talked about how God made provision for him there and so number one Elijah of the Bible was a Wilderness man and then as we were leaving the broadcast last week we mentioned the second characteristic of the prophet Elijah and that was that he preached without fear against the religious order and the spiritual Norm of his day to call the people back to the faith and I want to give you an example of that that is found in the scripture in the book of First Kings if you have your Bible there you can uh look at it with me or maybe jot it down and look at it at a later time but it is First Kings 8 18 beginning in verse 21 it reads and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bael then follow him and the people answered him not a word we see on Elijah the courage to confront the courage to stand and say that the normal attitude lack of real commitment of his generation uh was not enough he said I want to challenge you in this you you've got two opinions you're holding on to God with one hand and bael which is a false god in the other hand you have become very non-committed in your faith and and I'm here to tell you it's time to make up your mind and the people it seems had no answer for him in verse 22 then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but by else prophets are 450 Men Let Them therefore give us two Bullocks let them choose one bulock for themselves cut it in pieces lay it on wood put no fire under I will dress the other bullet lay it on wood put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the God that anth by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken they agreed with his Challenge on Mount Carmel and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal go ahead giving them the instructions what to do choose this one and so forth and they did that they took the Bullock uh and they dressed it laid it out called on the name of bael the Bible said in verse 26 from morning all the way until noon oh bael hear us but there was no voice nor anyone that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon verse 27 that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he is talking or is pursuing or is on a journey or per Adventure he sleepeth and must be awake and they cried aloud in their desperation to get an answer to manipulate their God who was not uh in order to manipulate him they cut themselves with all manner of knives and lancets verse 28 said Till The Blood gushed Out upon them verse 29 it came to pass when midday was passed they they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice and there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any of that regarded so all of their uh manipulation all of their tactics to try to persuade their God now this tells me that they believed they really believed their God was real they would have never cut themselves if they didn't think that the god that they they served was a real God they were absolutely deceived but no voice and when when Elijah began to mock the fact that their God wasn't answering it really drove them into desperation they're jumping around and pleading and yet there is no answer and when Elijah had had just about all of it that he could have the Bible said he took 12 Stones according to the number of the sons of Jacob and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord he made a trench about the altar a as great as would contain two measures of seed he put the wood in order he cut the bulock in pieces laid it on the wood and said fill four barrels with water now he's going Beyond The Challenge and pour it on the sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it a second time and they did it do it a third time and they did it and the water ran about the Altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said let me read it read his prayer Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am your servant and that I have done all these things at Thy word help me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again now this is where Malachi's prophecy is tied in with the Ministry of the original Elijah Prophet that's it's the same phraseology here turn their heart back again this was part of Elijah's prayer it's part of the Elijah commission to turn Hearts back to the original faith and I want you to know what verse 38 said then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and and the stones now this is not just ordinary fire is it this fire burned the sacrifice the wood the stones the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of ba and let not one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slew them there what a mighty Showdown the power of God contrasted with the power of a God that doesn't exist well that is a no-brainer I I if this God doesn't exist then he has no power has no ability to help and yet many people would have continued to fall Follow by L and even in the world that we live in today many men and women are worshiping powerless gods that do not exist the only place where these gods exist is in the imagination of men's Hearts there is no reality but I'm talking to you today about God about Jehovah the Living God the god of Creation The God Who Loved Us so much that he came to this earth in human flesh to bleed to die to suffer to become our sacrifice our propitiation for sin our complete reconciliation and Redemption to God was provided through the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and so it is impossible for you and I to hold on to the Living God the true God and the false gods of men's imaginations we need to come clean separate ourselves from all all paganism separate ourselves from all idolatry and I know that what I'm preaching to you uh from my little safe place seemingly in Smith Station Alabama but yet I'm preaching around the world into Nations and cultures where to stand for the true Living God can bring persecution and in some cases even death but I want you to know there is no other way to God other than the Lord Jesus Christ on the Last Broadcast we talked about him saying I am the way the truth and the life he is the door the window whereby we enter into fellowship with God and so Elijah called uh challenged the religious Norm of his day he challenged false religion he said you're just this is phony uh this is not real this is not authentic and it's time to make up your mind you know some people follow in Tradition because they don't want to offend their family or their neighbors and yet Elijah said you can't just keep doing nothing because you don't want to make a stand how long halt you between two opinions and so if this characteristic of Elijah the prophet If This truly was uh an attribute a characteristic of his ministry and and I've just shown you in the word where it was then if that spirit and power of Elijah return to the Earth and they have each time they come they would come with the same kind of message a message to call people into separation into intimacy what we have called the Wilderness and number two to challenge the the false religion of the day and also the religious Norm the the nor form of religion today is just cool watered down Christianity and so there's two things that Elijah addressed he addressed the fact that people were following false gods and he addressed that people had ered from the original Faith the faith that was given to Moses you've aired from that you've gone in another Direction and it's time for you to be challenged and to make up your mind where you stand there was neither slackness nor complacency in Elijah and if there should come a company of people Anointed with the spirit and power of Elijah they too will not be a complacent people they will not be a lukewarm people they'll be a people of boldness they will be a people of Courage they will be a people of of non-c compromise calling people back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints as the New Testament says earnestly contending for the faith sometimes there's a battle because we have to make a stand I love the fact that Elijah risked his life he he really uh was not afraid to confront and to call the people back he burned with a holy passion it's time for there to be men and women among us who are filled f with a holy passion for God a Zeal for righteousness he was an altar Builder did you notice that he built his own altar he didn't just try to use the altar that had already been prepared he built his own altar with great concern for its significance he he took 12 Stones because he was representing the 12 tribes of Israel so what he was doing even even building an altar had more uh significance and more meaning than just a place to pray or a place to offer sacrifice it became a prophetic declaration that the god of Israel and the god of the sons of Israel is still alive and he built this altar we could almost say uh as a memorial to the promise to the Covenant that God had made with Abraham Isaac Jacob who who uh now has become Israel and his sons this was a real uh I I call it going back to the old landmarks like the Bible talks about he wanted to reestablish uh the foundation of the faith and he did that by laying those 12 Stones on the altar so any uh time that the spirit and power of Elijah should visit the Earth we will recognize that by this desire to stand on the uncompromised word of God and a desire to be an altar Builder a worshipper uh a prayer Warrior as we have called it this Elijah was not intimidated by the other religious demonstrations of those around him uh he just mocked it to be honest with you uh he just said where is your god is he on vacation I is he talking with his neighbor why is it that he is ignoring you he just had a little fun and and did it to offend their minds so that they could begin to see the reality that what they were giving their lives for was fallacy it was false it was a fable and so all of their praying prophesying they prophesied through the afternoon jumped up on the altar jumped around danced around cut themselves n none of that moved Elijah not at all just go right ahead and do whatever you have to do to make yourself comfortable because at the end of this he stepped up with full confidence that his God was going to prove himself to be genuine and to be real I sit here today with full confidence that my God is going to show himself strong and mighty in the earth not only today but tomorrow throughout all eternity and when they had demonstrated their faith or uh false as it was he stepped up with confidence in the God that he served and prayed I believe it was 63 words not hours of prayer not not all this you know demonstration cutting and using LAN and jump on the Altar and all this stuff he just prayed 63 little words he reminded God I know who you are I know the Covenant that you have made with your people and he added to the challenge he he just said I'm going to do more I'm going to dig a trench I'm going to have water poured on the altar three times big buckets of water and prayed his little prayer stepped back and the god that Elijah trusted in moved in and answered by fire and we showed you right in the word of God where the fire not only burned up the bulock and the wood but even licked up the dust licked up the water caused the water to evaporate to disappear and even consume the stones I'm telling you this was a demonstration uh of the realness of our God wasn't it and uh that is an outstanding demon demonstration uh contrasting that which is genuine and that which is false maybe every time there's such a showdown the results might not be as dramatic but every time God is challenged and compared with the gods of men's imaginations I promise you the god of the Bible is going to come out on top every time and he changes not uh another thing to notice about Elijah he was not afraid to challenge when he needed to challenge and to confront when necessary something you ought to know about this bael this false god he was called in the traditions of men a cloud Rider it means that he was the god of weather and it was supposed to be up to bael to change the seasons when it was to be spring when it was to be summer when it was to be Autumn when it was to be winter it was up to bael and it was believed that bael controlled the rain and and therefore that made him a god of water a god of weather and so I I feel that this little extra challenge with the water was addressing that issue it was a real Smackdown of bael in the eyes of those who had trusted so blindly in his ability and in his power and and in that day his inability was exposed in fact his non-existence was exposed I believe that if indeed we see a return of the spirit and power of Elijah in our day we will see showdowns in the earth and uh sure enough they're needed where the power of God is on display showing men and women that what they have trusted in what they have believed in what many have laid down their lives for uh that is in often cases merely the the traditions of Men passed down from generation to generation with no power in it with no life in it but I want you to know the god of the Bible Jehovah God he did more than just rule from the heavens he came in flesh he paid the price he became our uh our our propitiation for sin the Bible said but I want you to know the Bible also tells us he was tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin he was the great high priest and yet he came and walked among men facing all of The Temptations all of the trials of common men and yet he did not sin this was a testimony to me it is a testimony to me that if my Lord could overcome I can overcome also by trusting in his power and his strength little children he said I have overcome the world and you can overcome the world too if you put your trust in the one who has already overcome the world our Lord Jesus Christ so you know there may come a time I think it will most definitely where we have to stand and it may not be easy because the world will challenge us mock us you know deny that Jesus is real Yeshua that he is really the Messiah but if you have this revelation of Faith you stand you stand don't be afraid to stand on the word if you stand for God I assure you he'll stand for you I want us to pray because I know there are needs out there and and I know this living God that I've been talking about is the one who can help you with those needs father I ask you right now to reveal yourself to every viewer to every listener those who have only known you by dry religion I ask that you unveil yourself and reveal yourself in power in love in reality Let Your Presence become real right now in that home in that place of business Lord Jesus let your precious Holy Spirit draw men and women to a deeper relationship with you I ask that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for watching the Eagles cry I hope you'll tune in again I've got a lot more to share God bless you bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] all [Music]
