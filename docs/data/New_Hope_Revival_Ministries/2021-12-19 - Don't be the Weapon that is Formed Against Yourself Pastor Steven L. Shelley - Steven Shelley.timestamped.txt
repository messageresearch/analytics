[54:12] now gone on vacation and we're uh sad
[54:15] not to see them here this morning but
[54:17] we're praying for them
[54:18] and uh
[54:20] the tebow family is missing this morning
[54:22] and ashley and david
[54:24] also and zion is in mexico with
[54:28] solomon's family i think they're in the
[54:29] mountains
[54:31] tebow family and
[54:33] uh different ones are moving here and
[54:35] there it's good to have jenna with us
[54:37] this morning from dallas god bless you
[54:40] here for a few days
[54:43] brother greeley is in maryland to attend
[54:47] the funeral of his first cousin tomorrow
[54:50] a pastor's wife who passed away
[54:54] she had meant a lot to a lot of people
[54:57] and we've been praying for that family
[54:59] that god will comfort them
[55:01] and i have always said propolis but i'm
[55:05] told that they pronounce it pra propolis
[55:08] and so um
[55:10] they she is the daughter of
[55:13] brother earl heist
[55:15] who for so many years pastored a church
[55:18] in this message
[55:19] and brother earl heist was a brother
[55:23] to mama greeley brother
[55:26] his wife that's right that's right his
[55:28] wife brother earl heist's wife was a
[55:32] sister to brother greeley's mom
[55:35] and so
[55:36] they have many many years of
[55:39] wonderful fellowship and relations and
[55:41] the church this morning must really be
[55:43] broken and we want to lift every one of
[55:45] them up for prayer a dear friend of ours
[55:48] christine potter went home to be with
[55:51] the lord
[55:52] and uh it's just a real shock
[55:55] um because you know you get in your mind
[55:57] you don't like to think these things but
[55:59] you get in your mind that maybe you're
[56:02] you know you you look at a couple and
[56:03] you say well she'll be here forever and
[56:06] and and she'll live long enough to bury
[56:08] her husband you know these thoughts
[56:09] might come to your mind but you just
[56:11] don't ever know what god has
[56:14] and we just admit we we just admit full
[56:17] disclosure that christine was one of the
[56:19] most unusual people that we ever met in
[56:21] our lives
[56:23] and uh but we believe that she loved the
[56:25] lord
[56:26] and she showed so much respect for what
[56:29] we believe
[56:30] she did not follow this message but she
[56:33] had tremendous respect for the ministry
[56:37] of brother branham she had tremendous
[56:39] respect for the standard that we kept in
[56:42] this church
[56:43] and we have so many stories that have
[56:45] never been told of times that she has
[56:48] called our home when we were in
[56:50] desperate need of prayer and god would
[56:54] lay
[56:55] us on her heart and she would call and
[56:57] pray for us
[56:59] we didn't always come to the pulpit and
[57:01] say christine called this week to pray
[57:03] but we appreciate every prayer that she
[57:06] ever prayed
[57:07] if you didn't know christine then you
[57:09] have perhaps sung some of her husband's
[57:12] songs i think the only one we've ever
[57:14] done much here is show me thy face lord
[57:18] and uh don is going to need our prayers
[57:20] so we are there
[57:22] the memorial for christine is today and
[57:24] so we want to pray for him
[57:27] and uh he has had an unusual influence
[57:30] in music he's a tremendous musician and
[57:33] a very talented man and uh god used him
[57:36] tremendously in helping to save the life
[57:39] of wynonna judd if anybody knows who
[57:41] that is he was used in a mighty way so
[57:44] our hearts are with that family today we
[57:47] didn't take time for prayer requests
[57:49] because as ben said there was just
[57:52] something that said now is the time just
[57:54] not to disturb that but there are many
[57:56] prayer requests that have come in sister
[57:59] joyce's dad stands in desperate need of
[58:01] prayer today in the hospital and sister
[58:04] nakisha reached out this morning for a
[58:07] cousin
[58:08] sister megan reached out that we would
[58:10] pray for lyle who lost his wife susan
[58:13] and it's going to be a hard time through
[58:15] the holidays and their wedding
[58:17] anniversary coming up and ben mentioned
[58:20] that zach is in the hospital he is doing
[58:22] some better now he had a turn for the
[58:25] worse during the week
[58:27] after eating some solid food uh even
[58:30] that it was at the doctor's uh
[58:32] permission and and they're trying to see
[58:34] what would happen and what happened
[58:36] wasn't good
[58:38] and uh but he is recovering and
[58:41] said last night that he was feeling a
[58:42] good bit better but still in the
[58:44] hospital not exactly sure when he will
[58:46] come home perhaps tomorrow but you know
[58:49] he sent a right now in his condition he
[58:52] needs to be watched and cared for and
[58:54] taken care of and uh
[58:56] i i like the fact that god uses things
[58:59] like this to kind of speak to our heart
[59:01] he just softens us in him and i'm only
[59:04] saying that because i made a comment to
[59:06] him this week
[59:08] we were there and then in phone calls
[59:11] and text as well but i made a comment to
[59:13] him this week about regretting that he
[59:15] wasn't able to see the children because
[59:17] they won't allow them anywhere near the
[59:19] hospital it seems
[59:21] and uh his comments back to me were
[59:24] a little personal perhaps but i would
[59:26] just say that he is contemplating how
[59:29] close
[59:30] it was
[59:31] 30
[59:32] of the people who suffer with a
[59:35] perforated bowel like that
[59:37] expire they pass away from that
[59:39] condition that's 30 percent that's
[59:41] pretty high
[59:42] and so you get to thinking about that
[59:44] and think about the fact that to say
[59:47] goodbye to your children the last time
[59:49] you know and god spare you and let you
[59:51] be with them well he knows how to cause
[59:53] us to understand how fragile life is
[59:56] and how much we have to be thankful for
[59:59] how many of you know we are we are a
[1:00:01] blessed blessed blessed people
[1:00:06] so if we missed any of the prayer
[1:00:08] requests and i'm sure we did because my
[1:00:10] phone was blowing up this morning with
[1:00:12] many many needs and we know that god
[1:00:14] sees them all today is sister louise
[1:00:17] weir's birthday and uh in new brunswick

[1:08:50] and every tongue
[1:08:53] that shall rise against thee in judgment

[1:09:39] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:09:41] you in judgment you shall know
[1:09:44] you shall show
[1:09:46] to be in the wrong
[1:09:48] this peace righteousness security

[1:10:07] lord is reproduced who do you think that
[1:10:10] is

[1:10:12] this is the righteousness or the
[1:10:15] vindication which they obtain from me
[1:10:20] this is that which i impact excuse me
[1:10:24] impart to them
[1:10:26] as their justification
[1:10:29] says the lord
[1:10:31] let me read that

[1:10:35] end of that again
[1:10:37] this peace

[1:10:59] as their
[1:11:01] justification says the lord oh my
[1:11:05] i
[1:11:06] i
[1:11:08] there's something about that i feel that
[1:11:10] we don't always feel physically i felt
[1:11:13] something going up and down my legs
[1:11:16] as i was reading the truth of god's word
[1:11:19] this is what he offers us his
[1:11:22] righteousness as our
[1:11:24] justification
[1:11:26] aren't you glad you're justified
[1:11:29] just if i'd never sinned
[1:11:32] isn't he wonderful
[1:11:34] can you
[1:11:36] pardon me just a moment
[1:11:38] i was going to do this but i hated to do
[1:11:40] it during worship sometimes i have to
[1:11:43] but i saw that i
[1:11:45] right where that word was i needed there
[1:11:47] was a big spot there
[1:11:49] that's my excuse and i'm sticking with
[1:11:51] it all right
[1:11:53] the truth is i need healing and and a
[1:11:56] new prescription probably in the
[1:11:57] meantime but
[1:12:01] i won't make you wait for me to clean my
[1:12:03] watch and phone too okay i usually use
[1:12:06] those till all the juices out of them
[1:12:08] let's pray this morning father thank you
[1:12:10] for your word
[1:12:12] it is life to us
[1:12:15] it is help and strength and holy
[1:12:19] holy brings your holy presence
[1:12:22] to us
[1:12:24] we know we're not living this life by
[1:12:26] feeling but oh it's good
[1:12:29] it's so good when we can perceive
[1:12:33] your presence
[1:12:35] touching our body
[1:12:37] it just reminds us that you're god's
[1:12:40] sovereign
[1:12:41] and that you have power to move upon us
[1:12:44] lord if we never felt you in that way
[1:12:46] again we know today your word is all we
[1:12:49] need to get us through
[1:12:51] we're not trusting in any sensation but
[1:12:54] how we thank you lord that sometimes
[1:12:57] it's just your desire that we experience
[1:13:00] you in a tangible way
[1:13:02] lord come today
[1:13:04] give us grace in your word bind up the
[1:13:08] hand of the enemy and allow your word to
[1:13:11] go forth today and accomplish all that
[1:13:14] it is sent forth to do in the precious
[1:13:17] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:13:20] and the church said
[1:13:22] you may be seated no weapon
[1:13:25] that is formed against you
[1:13:28] shall prosper
[1:13:30] i want to preach this morning
[1:13:32] don't be the weapon
[1:13:35] that is formed against yourself
[1:13:38] now i sent this out a year or so ago the
[1:13:41] little little picture with that phrase
[1:13:45] and you'd be surprised how many people
[1:13:47] can relate to that
[1:13:49] but since we are in
[1:13:51] a time of looking again at the greatest
[1:13:54] battle ever fought
[1:13:56] and we are rediscovering that the
[1:13:59] battlefield
[1:14:00] of that battle is our human mind
[1:14:03] and that is why we have to continue to
[1:14:06] renew our mind we have to continue to
[1:14:09] come and allow the oil of the holy
[1:14:12] spirit to be poured over our mind
[1:14:15] cleansing our thoughts
[1:14:17] and quickening us
[1:14:19] to think with his mind
[1:14:21] we must make a choice
[1:14:23] i wished it was once and for all
[1:14:26] but it's not once and for all we have to
[1:14:29] keep making a choice i'm taking the mind
[1:14:32] of the lord i'm going to use the mind of
[1:14:34] the lord i'm going to think with the
[1:14:37] mind of jesus christ and so i love the
[1:14:40] fact that god has made a way to give us
[1:14:42] his mind he's also made a way for us to
[1:14:46] renew our mind so that it can surrender
[1:14:49] to his will to his thought to his word
[1:14:53] and the the truth is we have a devil
[1:14:56] there's a devil out there how many of
[1:14:57] you know it there's a devil out there he
[1:14:59] comes to church
[1:15:02] he shows up with us
[1:15:04] anywhere you are he's there
[1:15:09] he comes if he can't get there himself
[1:15:11] because he is a as a created being is
[1:15:14] not um omnipresent but if he can't get
[1:15:17] there he sends imps
[1:15:19] he was able to persuade a third of the
[1:15:21] angels to follow his rebellion
[1:15:24] and they're there and they operate and
[1:15:26] they work and they touch the atmosphere
[1:15:29] we understand that satan
[1:15:32] uh the god of this evil age brother
[1:15:35] branham called him he called where we're
[1:15:37] living now satan's eden because the
[1:15:40] enemy has as the prince of the power of
[1:15:43] the air he has authority over this earth
[1:15:46] but the real authority over this earth
[1:15:48] belongs to the bride
[1:15:50] you can say amen or old me or i'm not
[1:15:53] sure about that it's jesus it's his
[1:15:56] authority it's the bridegroom's
[1:15:59] authority it's residing in the bride and
[1:16:02] one of these days the enemy is going to
[1:16:05] lose this
[1:16:06] he's going to lose it
[1:16:08] we're going to have the authority for
[1:16:10] out all throughout all eternity the
[1:16:13] bible said we will rule and reign with
[1:16:15] him
[1:16:16] we will be given a place in his throne
[1:16:19] judging angels and nations and those who
[1:16:22] come before him will experience this
[1:16:25] judgment that comes from his wife the
[1:16:28] bride of jesus christ but in this hour
[1:16:32] it seems that the enemy is loosed from
[1:16:34] the second heaven that's where the air
[1:16:37] is that's the atmosphere above the earth
[1:16:39] somewhere in the spirit realm we know
[1:16:42] that he has a throne there we know that
[1:16:45] there are all kinds of powers and
[1:16:47] principalities
[1:16:49] all kinds of spiritual wickedness in
[1:16:51] high places
[1:16:53] territorial spirits
[1:16:55] generational spirits
[1:16:57] we have an enemy
[1:17:01] there's no doubt about it
[1:17:03] but we also discover in this hour that
[1:17:06] we can easily become
[1:17:08] our greatest enemy
[1:17:11] i wish you were awake
[1:17:14] wish you could hear this
[1:17:16] because i'm talking to you
[1:17:19] you do not want to be the enemy that's
[1:17:22] formed against your own life
[1:17:24] you want to make sure that you are not
[1:17:26] cooperating with the accuser and
[1:17:29] accusing yourself
[1:17:31] because jesus has sent his righteousness
[1:17:34] to justify you when you have put your
[1:17:37] trust in him if you believe that say
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] so we search our hearts today we've been
[1:17:43] searching our lives we've been searching
[1:17:45] our minds we've been asking the lord
[1:17:48] show us how we can claim the victory
[1:17:51] that you have already given us over our
[1:17:54] own mind possessing our own thoughts
[1:17:58] pulling down strongholds and casting
[1:18:01] aside every imagination and all those
[1:18:04] thoughts that like to exalt themselves
[1:18:08] above the knowledge of jesus christ so
[1:18:11] we are asking god this morning lord show
[1:18:14] me in any way
[1:18:16] that i have become the enemy
[1:18:19] that's marching against my own life
[1:18:22] do not be the enemy that's being formed
[1:18:25] against yourself but recognize that the
[1:18:28] bible said no
[1:18:30] weapon
[1:18:32] no
[1:18:33] weapon formed against thee shall prosper
[1:18:37] god has promised victory over all of our
[1:18:40] enemies and that includes
[1:18:45] we used to have an old sister i've told
[1:18:47] you about her many times
[1:18:50] she worked at crystal
[1:18:52] you ever been to crystal
[1:18:55] oh
[1:18:56] you hear you heard sister said ooh
[1:18:58] sister beth
[1:19:00] once a year i have to have one or two or
[1:19:03] three or four
[1:19:04] once a year
[1:19:05] that's all i need that's all i can
[1:19:08] handle
[1:19:10] but i
[1:19:10] sometime you pass by there and they're
[1:19:13] venting that
[1:19:14] onion smell
[1:19:16] and and you you just have to taste them
[1:19:19] this little sister worked uh for years
[1:19:22] at crystal she knew all their secrets
[1:19:25] she lived alone she had a son who was
[1:19:28] kind of a loner and
[1:19:29] he lived near her and
[1:19:31] she was a little bit of an eccentric
[1:19:33] woman and since i said that i won't call
[1:19:35] her name unless i already did
[1:19:37] but she was a dear friend to our family
[1:19:40] she attended our church
[1:19:42] she had a sharp tongue
[1:19:47] she loved the lord she had to be worked
[1:19:51] on just like all of us
[1:19:54] one time she was called out and told
[1:19:57] if you can d deal i said
[1:20:01] i don't know if i want to repeat it
[1:20:02] exactly like it was said but one time
[1:20:04] she was called out and told that her
[1:20:06] tongue was as long as her hair
[1:20:11] you say that woman probably got mad
[1:20:13] never come back to church no no she'd
[1:20:14] been in this thing too long to let
[1:20:16] something like that put her off
[1:20:18] she said that ain't nothing but the
[1:20:20] truth now god help me what should i do
[1:20:22] lay it on the altar
[1:20:24] she said i've got to get help from that
[1:20:27] she'd be real honest josh when she would
[1:20:29] testify she'd stand up and she'd say uh
[1:20:32] well i have trouble sometime with folks
[1:20:35] she said i work in a in a quick
[1:20:37] environment that i have to be on my toes
[1:20:40] and i'm getting a little older and and
[1:20:42] sometimes they snip at me and i snap at
[1:20:44] them and and she said but i want to tell
[1:20:47] you today that my worst enemy is the
[1:20:50] woman who lives between my two elbows
[1:20:55] i want to tell you that sometimes your
[1:20:58] worst enemy is not the devil
[1:21:02] he actually is anointing you
[1:21:05] and you are the biggest problem you've
[1:21:08] got
[1:21:09] and you're living between these two
[1:21:11] elbows but i want to tell you i want to
[1:21:14] tell the enemy i want to tell every imp
[1:21:17] that's listening that jesus has given us
[1:21:20] power
[1:21:21] over all the powers of the enemy and we
[1:21:24] are waking up to the fact that we
[1:21:27] sometimes become the weapon that's being
[1:21:30] formed against our own lives we sabotage
[1:21:34] ourselves because we don't take god at
[1:21:38] his word
[1:21:39] we are carrying baggage that we should
[1:21:42] have left at the feet of jesus years and
[1:21:46] years ago
[1:21:49] we're dragging dead bodies around our
[1:21:52] neck that we should have cut off
[1:21:55] many years ago so that we could stand
[1:21:58] before god in victory come on
[1:22:01] you know i just had a hard time last
[1:22:03] sunday i was struggling and it was
[1:22:06] sleepy in here and
[1:22:08] and i was just working harder than i
[1:22:10] liked to work and i was in pain
[1:22:12] and uh the ibuprofen wasn't doing it and
[1:22:15] the lord didn't see fit to move it just
[1:22:17] then and
[1:22:18] and there was just a lot going on but i
[1:22:20] did the best i could
[1:22:22] and my granny told me years ago but i
[1:22:25] forget it sometime she said when you
[1:22:27] feel like you do the least
[1:22:29] sometimes that's because god's doing the
[1:22:31] most
[1:22:32] and he wants you to know it's not you
[1:22:34] anyway you can't help
[1:22:36] nobody you can't help nobody but if you
[1:22:40] let him get in he'll help and i'm only
[1:22:42] mentioning that to tell you that there
[1:22:45] were so many nitty-gritty nitty-gritty
[1:22:48] testimonies that came in this week from
[1:22:52] people who saw some things that they had
[1:22:54] not seen before and they decided i've
[1:22:58] got to do something about it
[1:23:01] you know they tell us that
[1:23:04] somewhere back in the ancient times
[1:23:06] if a man killed a man in certain
[1:23:09] cultures and societies
[1:23:12] they were
[1:23:13] they believed in the in capital
[1:23:15] punishment they they believe what the
[1:23:17] bible says an eye for an eye and a tooth
[1:23:20] for a tooth
[1:23:22] and they would
[1:23:24] bring a different form of execution than
[1:23:27] what we know as capital punishment today
[1:23:30] we're told that in certain circumstances
[1:23:33] the dead corpse of the person that they
[1:23:36] had murdered would be tied on their back
[1:23:41] and they would have to live now i don't
[1:23:44] know they probably didn't go many places
[1:23:48] but if they chose to go wherever they
[1:23:51] went that old dead body had to go with
[1:23:53] them
[1:23:54] how many of you think that sounds
[1:23:55] disgusting well i want you to know there
[1:23:57] are people in this house today
[1:24:00] there are people streaming this service
[1:24:02] today that are carrying old dead bodies
[1:24:05] on their back
[1:24:06] they're rotting they're they're they're
[1:24:08] putrid they're decaying they're full of
[1:24:12] bacteria their vulture bait or buzzard
[1:24:15] bait and yet we carry it because we
[1:24:19] refuse to take the opportunity that god
[1:24:22] has given us to cut it loose and let it
[1:24:25] go you are not the murderer anymore
[1:24:28] you're not the guilty anymore if you've
[1:24:31] been justified by the righteous blood of
[1:24:34] jesus christ you're not that man anymore
[1:24:38] condemned to death you don't have to die
[1:24:41] for your past you don't have to die for
[1:24:45] yesteryear jesus said i am come that you
[1:24:48] might have life and that you might have
[1:24:51] it more abundantly let the past be the
[1:24:54] past let the blood of jesus cut you off
[1:24:58] from where you were and who you were
[1:25:01] amen and do not continue to carry that
[1:25:06] thing any longer you can just imagine
[1:25:09] how it would smell
[1:25:15] you just walk through an alabama summer
[1:25:19] with a dead body on your back
[1:25:22] you just go down and roll your window
[1:25:23] down when you're passing road kill about
[1:25:26] july
[1:25:29] you'll find out that it's a smell that's
[1:25:31] almost overwhelming
[1:25:33] and yet for some amount of time they say
[1:25:36] that man would have to carry that smell
[1:25:38] on his back
[1:25:40] i know you hadn't had lunch
[1:25:42] and maybe i should tell this right as we
[1:25:45] release you so that you'd eat a little
[1:25:47] less today for lunch
[1:25:48] but i want you to know those bacterium
[1:25:51] working in there
[1:25:55] blowflies
[1:25:59] the little larva you know what you call
[1:26:00] them little wiggle things
[1:26:02] i can't hardly say the word without
[1:26:04] feeling nauseous all over i'm being
[1:26:05] honest i'm going to just i'm not gonna
[1:26:07] say the word but you know what i mean
[1:26:09] they just work
[1:26:11] you can imagine that man carrying all of
[1:26:14] that dead weight on his back with all of
[1:26:17] that going on the the purpose was to to
[1:26:20] kill him
[1:26:22] but a a quick death a hanging or a
[1:26:25] shooting or a decapitation would have
[1:26:28] been a quick death they figured that
[1:26:31] this would be a a greater deterrent
[1:26:34] when when people knew what was going to
[1:26:37] happen to them
[1:26:38] if they committed such a crime
[1:26:41] then they would be less likely to commit
[1:26:43] a crime like that themselves
[1:26:45] the problem is it could be a slow death
[1:26:48] it could be a painful death
[1:26:50] as his own body began to respond to the
[1:26:53] rot of that thing that he was carrying
[1:26:56] i'm preaching to you about the condition
[1:27:00] of so many people around you
[1:27:02] who are rotting in sin
[1:27:05] who are decaying under the influence of
[1:27:08] the god of this evil age
[1:27:10] who are under the influence of satan and
[1:27:13] his imps out there in this world dying
[1:27:17] slowly every day not even realizing
[1:27:20] sometimes the slow death that's taking
[1:27:23] place in them but you are not so
[1:27:27] you are not so if you're the children of
[1:27:31] god if you have been bought with a price
[1:27:34] if you have repented of your sin and
[1:27:37] have been baptized in the lovely name of
[1:27:40] the lord jesus christ if you have
[1:27:43] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:46] who still walks and talks in his bride
[1:27:49] then you are not living the slow death
[1:27:53] it is no longer your responsibility to
[1:27:56] carry the dead weight
[1:27:59] of the carnage
[1:28:01] even though you are responsible
[1:28:04] in that hour in that time once upon a
[1:28:07] time you were the guilty party
[1:28:11] that death is because of you but the
[1:28:14] blood of jesus christ
[1:28:17] sets us free
[1:28:18] there is only one
[1:28:20] sin that is an unpardonable sin we say
[1:28:24] and that is blasphemy against the holy
[1:28:27] ghost
[1:28:31] nine times out of ten maybe ten out of
[1:28:34] ten
[1:28:35] if somebody ever came around and said
[1:28:37] i'm afraid
[1:28:39] i'm very very afraid that i have
[1:28:42] blasphemed the holy ghost i usually send
[1:28:44] them on their way in a better frame of
[1:28:46] mind
[1:28:48] because almost every time you can tell
[1:28:50] them what makes you think that well i
[1:28:51] just i just feel so worried i just i
[1:28:54] just feel so concerned i know what i did
[1:28:57] and then we have the glorious pleasure
[1:28:59] of telling him you take this to god you
[1:29:02] pray about it but the likelihood is if
[1:29:04] you had sinned away your opportunity of
[1:29:07] grace you wouldn't care where you were
[1:29:11] how you lived how you felt your
[1:29:14] god-consciousness would no longer be
[1:29:16] there
[1:29:17] you'd no longer even be conscious of the
[1:29:19] fact that there was a better way to live
[1:29:22] in fact the bible talks about those who
[1:29:24] end their life in that condition in a
[1:29:27] reprobate state
[1:29:28] in that they did not like to retain god
[1:29:31] in their knowledge he turned them over
[1:29:33] to a reprobate mind to believe a lie
[1:29:36] and to be damned
[1:29:38] this is the end result of those who
[1:29:41] blaspheme the holy ghost this is the end
[1:29:43] result if you take it in context it's
[1:29:46] the end result of the spirit of
[1:29:48] homosexuality that's taken over our land
[1:29:50] today
[1:29:51] because this is a perversion that is
[1:29:54] rooted in pride and pride is the sin
[1:29:56] that destroyed sodom and gomorrah
[1:29:59] just because you can have it
[1:30:01] just because you can do it just because
[1:30:04] you can get a hold of it doesn't mean
[1:30:06] it's yours
[1:30:07] it doesn't mean it's right it doesn't
[1:30:09] mean it's god's ordained way
[1:30:11] say amen we know a man can lay with a
[1:30:14] man a woman can lay with a woman but
[1:30:16] that doesn't make it right
[1:30:17] that doesn't make it part of god's plan
[1:30:20] sometimes we have to say i i have that
[1:30:23] maybe that urge maybe there's something
[1:30:25] going on emotionally in my life but i
[1:30:28] must not yield to any kind of temptation
[1:30:32] i believe with every temptation god does
[1:30:34] what he makes a way of escape what i'm
[1:30:37] here to tell you today is as children of
[1:30:40] god we must cut ourselves loose
[1:30:43] from all that we're carrying
[1:30:46] that dead body that corpse of your past
[1:30:49] will eat at you until it destroys your
[1:30:52] today
[1:30:53] your past will eat up your today if you
[1:30:56] should allow it to be so is anybody with
[1:30:58] me
[1:30:59] you do not have to be your worst enemy
[1:31:02] you can give that back to the devil
[1:31:05] you don't have to help him
[1:31:06] you don't have to cooperate with him
[1:31:08] don't be the weapon that's formed
[1:31:09] against yourself now in psalms
[1:31:12] 141-3 and i got to get moving here in a
[1:31:15] hurry psalm 141-3 it says set a watch
[1:31:21] set a watch
[1:31:27] oh lord
[1:31:28] before my mouth
[1:31:31] keep the door
[1:31:33] of my lips
[1:31:37] did you know our mouth
[1:31:39] is one of the ways that we can become
[1:31:41] the weapon
[1:31:43] that's formed against ourselves
[1:31:45] words are thoughts expressed
[1:31:48] you won't say it if you're not thinking
[1:31:49] it
[1:31:50] if somebody's saying it it's because
[1:31:52] they're thinking it
[1:31:53] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:31:54] mouth speaketh whatever is in there is
[1:31:57] going to come out i'm not one of those
[1:31:59] who buys into this idea those who talk
[1:32:02] such crude profanity i'm not one of
[1:32:05] those who believe such an idea as that
[1:32:07] just slipped out i don't know where that
[1:32:09] come from that wasn't in there i don't
[1:32:11] know how that come out of me it came out
[1:32:13] of you because it was in you
[1:32:16] i wish i could get a little more help
[1:32:19] it came out of you because it was in you
[1:32:22] and god knows how to go down into the
[1:32:24] root of who you are and cut that out of
[1:32:26] you
[1:32:27] so that it'll never slip out of your
[1:32:30] mouth again
[1:32:32] because it's not a thought in your mind
[1:32:34] because he's painted your mind with
[1:32:37] calvary's blood said a watch o lord
[1:32:40] before my mouth keep the doors of my
[1:32:42] lips now look at this in the amplified
[1:32:44] it says set a guard oh lord before my
[1:32:48] mouth keep watch
[1:32:50] at the door of my lips
[1:32:53] you know this is submission
[1:32:56] this is surrender
[1:32:58] this is honesty
[1:33:00] this is transparency
[1:33:03] this is david saying i can't always do
[1:33:06] it by myself
[1:33:10] sometimes i think something i shouldn't
[1:33:12] think and sometimes i say something i
[1:33:15] shouldn't say
[1:33:18] there's no cover up here
[1:33:20] david is saying lord i need you
[1:33:24] i need you to help me
[1:33:27] i need you to set a guard oh lord before
[1:33:31] my mouth i need you to be a watchman at
[1:33:34] my lips
[1:33:36] i need your help to keep from saying the
[1:33:40] things that i sometimes say that are not
[1:33:43] pleasing to you i confess
[1:33:46] that i can't do it by myself
[1:33:49] i don't know about you but if we can
[1:33:51] come to that place where we could say
[1:33:53] lord sometime no matter how hard i try i
[1:33:56] think a thought i don't want to think i
[1:33:58] say a word express something that i
[1:34:00] don't want to express or express it in a
[1:34:03] way that i don't want to express it you
[1:34:05] you know there are times that we can
[1:34:06] take time to say the truth in a tactful
[1:34:10] way
[1:34:12] and there's sometimes we don't care
[1:34:13] enough
[1:34:16] because we really don't care what it
[1:34:17] does
[1:34:19] we don't really care who it affects
[1:34:22] we don't really care how it makes
[1:34:24] somebody feel
[1:34:26] how many of you know it's better to take
[1:34:27] a little time
[1:34:29] the lord is not going to keep you from
[1:34:30] saying it
[1:34:32] he is not going to come and put a muzzle
[1:34:35] in your mouth most of the time and keep
[1:34:37] you from being able to say it but i'll
[1:34:39] tell you what he'll do he'll check your
[1:34:41] mouth
[1:34:42] he'll check your lips
[1:34:44] he'll cause you to feel something down
[1:34:47] on the inside that says you just need to
[1:34:48] slow down just a minute before you
[1:34:51] really make a big mess
[1:34:55] because how many of you know if it's in
[1:34:56] here you can just plunge it beneath the
[1:34:58] blood repent and never have to get it
[1:35:01] out in the open
[1:35:03] but once it comes out of here
[1:35:06] the enemy will then take those words and
[1:35:08] use them against the person they were
[1:35:10] intended for
[1:35:11] and not only that he'll turn them around
[1:35:14] and use them to your own destruction
[1:35:17] he will condemn you for your humanity
[1:35:21] and whip you all over town
[1:35:23] until you become your worst
[1:35:26] accuser
[1:35:27] or the worst weapon that is formed
[1:35:30] against you so god's giving us a way to
[1:35:33] to to uh help ourselves he's giving us
[1:35:36] this offer
[1:35:38] david is saying lord i got to have you
[1:35:40] here to help me guard to help me look
[1:35:42] out to help me watch
[1:35:45] now i want to ask you a question here
[1:35:49] how can we
[1:35:50] act
[1:35:53] as an enemy toward ourselves
[1:35:56] well there's
[1:35:57] lots of ways
[1:35:59] i want to name a few this morning
[1:36:01] and they're going to be familiar to you
[1:36:03] because we've been talking about them
[1:36:05] for some time now number one by holding
[1:36:07] on to our stinking thinking
[1:36:10] as we hold on to our wrong thinking
[1:36:13] we become an enemy
[1:36:16] to ourselves
[1:36:23] if you're building a weapon from the
[1:36:25] inside
[1:36:26] it's very hard to get rid of that weapon
[1:36:29] from the inside until you recognize what
[1:36:32] you're doing
[1:36:34] usually we're more uh you know aware of
[1:36:37] what's coming out and what's going out
[1:36:38] of our life sometimes we're not really
[1:36:41] as aware of what's going on on the
[1:36:43] inside and yet we need to be very aware
[1:36:46] of the thoughts that we are thinking
[1:36:48] because the thoughts that we are
[1:36:50] thinking they are creating our reality
[1:36:56] just because you think it
[1:37:00] doesn't make it true
[1:37:03] come on i need help
[1:37:05] just because you think it doesn't make
[1:37:07] it so
[1:37:09] just because you think it doesn't make
[1:37:11] it reality
[1:37:13] but the enemy will convince you that
[1:37:15] because you thought it
[1:37:18] it has to be the truth
[1:37:20] proverbs 23 and 7 you know it it said
[1:37:23] for as he thanketh in his heart
[1:37:27] for as he thinketh in his heart so
[1:37:32] is he
[1:37:34] that word thinketh there in the hebrew
[1:37:37] doesn't just mean a passing thought
[1:37:40] it means to calculate
[1:37:42] to reckon to split it open
[1:37:46] to act as a
[1:37:48] gate keeper this is not the thought like
[1:37:51] we talked about the bird flying over
[1:37:54] your head
[1:37:55] this is talking about the thought that
[1:37:58] finds its lodging place on the inside
[1:38:01] this is the one you allowed to build a
[1:38:03] nest in your hair
[1:38:05] you give him a roost and now that
[1:38:08] thought is sinking deep into who you are
[1:38:11] until you're really becoming what you
[1:38:13] think
[1:38:14] because this is what the scripture's
[1:38:16] saying here as you think in your heart
[1:38:18] as you ponder and calculate in your mind
[1:38:22] so you are
[1:38:26] so if you think that you're a loser
[1:38:29] capable of nothing
[1:38:32] then that is exactly what you become
[1:38:35] a loser
[1:38:36] capable of nothing somebody said i think
[1:38:39] that's like you know power of positive
[1:38:40] thinking and new age and all that no no
[1:38:42] no it's bible
[1:38:44] it's what the bible said it's what we've
[1:38:47] been taught in the message of the hour
[1:38:49] that the greatest battle the last great
[1:38:51] battle of the church ages
[1:38:54] is the battle up here
[1:38:57] in our mind
[1:38:59] so but but here's the problem we say
[1:39:02] well here it is satan puts a thought
[1:39:04] satan does this satan injects himself
[1:39:07] satan comes and does so and so what we
[1:39:09] fail to realize is sometimes we are in
[1:39:12] so much cooperation with him
[1:39:15] he doesn't even have to march against us
[1:39:18] we're marching against ourselves because
[1:39:21] we refuse to take god's truth as our
[1:39:24] reality and we form an altered reality
[1:39:27] an alternative reality
[1:39:30] and that one is rooted in condemnation
[1:39:33] and it's rooted in accusation and it's
[1:39:35] rooted in your destruction and in your
[1:39:38] defeat but you do not have to be
[1:39:40] defeated by your thoughts
[1:39:42] remember this
[1:39:44] to the degree that god is on your mind
[1:39:48] coming up out of your spirit remember
[1:39:51] this
[1:39:52] controlling your thoughts
[1:39:54] is to the degree that god is working in
[1:39:58] your life
[1:39:59] you say wait a minute mind control no
[1:40:02] god
[1:40:03] being able
[1:40:05] to be the gatekeeper that david asked
[1:40:08] him to be
[1:40:10] if you and i will allow god he will
[1:40:12] direct our thoughts away from where
[1:40:14] they've been
[1:40:16] he will help us pull ourselves back to
[1:40:18] the reality of god's word if we could
[1:40:21] just catch ourselves in the moment
[1:40:24] if we could just apply the five-second
[1:40:27] rule
[1:40:31] you think a thought
[1:40:32] you ponder that for five seconds you
[1:40:34] decide how you're going to let that
[1:40:36] thought affect you
[1:40:38] if you recognize it to be a lie then you
[1:40:41] march right in and place that in the
[1:40:43] garbage bin
[1:40:45] and you say i reject that you old dirty
[1:40:48] thought you have no lodging place in my
[1:40:50] life
[1:40:50] i know that's a dirty lie right out of
[1:40:52] the pit of hell
[1:40:54] if you do not do that but you engage
[1:40:57] that thought and think it another time
[1:40:59] it becomes a part of your thinking
[1:41:00] process
[1:41:02] and therefore when things happen in your
[1:41:04] life instead of coming back to god's
[1:41:06] truth
[1:41:08] you'll come back to what you were
[1:41:09] already thinking
[1:41:12] god says i want to come and watch over
[1:41:14] your thoughts
[1:41:15] i want to come and watch over your words
[1:41:18] i believe that i believe david knew
[1:41:20] exactly what he was doing asking the
[1:41:21] lord to come and set up this guard set
[1:41:24] up this protection
[1:41:26] i want to read just very quickly are you
[1:41:29] still here
[1:41:30] i want to read very quickly some of the
[1:41:32] very short statements that we have made
[1:41:34] about thoughts
[1:41:35] over the last few weeks and we're going
[1:41:37] to move on
[1:41:38] if if our mind doesn't change our life
[1:41:41] won't change
[1:41:43] change your mind change your words
[1:41:45] change your words
[1:41:48] you change your life
[1:41:50] watch your thoughts they become our
[1:41:52] actions and then eventually our actions
[1:41:55] become how we walk out our destiny
[1:41:58] here's what we said last week and i tell
[1:42:00] you i i've been pondering this
[1:42:03] and working on this all through the week
[1:42:05] thoughts create your moods
[1:42:10] wait a minute i'm not going to just let
[1:42:11] that i'm going to keep
[1:42:13] let's ponder that a minute
[1:42:17] anybody have a bad mood this week
[1:42:21] just let me dry this
[1:42:23] it is wet
[1:42:26] let me dry my connection here just a
[1:42:27] moment
[1:42:28] that must look kind of ridiculous
[1:42:32] you catch yourself in a bad mood
[1:42:37] anxious
[1:42:39] or angry
[1:42:43] maybe you felt taken advantage of
[1:42:49] if i keep naming them we'll hit them all
[1:42:51] won't we
[1:42:53] and you realize this is this is where i
[1:42:55] am this is where my thoughts are
[1:42:57] your mood begins to reflect what you're
[1:42:59] thinking
[1:43:01] did you know there's a way to change
[1:43:02] your mood
[1:43:06] it's not go get a piece of chocolate
[1:43:08] cake
[1:43:10] that won't last oh it actually really
[1:43:12] does last
[1:43:16] the easiest way to change the mood
[1:43:19] you're in
[1:43:21] is to change your thoughts
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] i don't know about you you probably
[1:43:26] didn't struggle with this maybe you did
[1:43:28] did you have some jealous thoughts
[1:43:32] did you see somebody else prospering in
[1:43:34] a certain way or getting along in a
[1:43:36] certain way and something in you a
[1:43:38] little envy rose up and you begin to
[1:43:40] find yourself stewing in a mood of
[1:43:44] rejection and
[1:43:46] looked over and i don't know what all
[1:43:48] else comes with that but you find
[1:43:50] yourself in a bad mood a sad mood a
[1:43:53] depressed mood
[1:43:55] an anxious mood
[1:43:57] because you're thinking thoughts like
[1:43:58] that
[1:44:00] it doesn't matter what you're thinking
[1:44:02] if it's causing your mood to be bad
[1:44:04] you've got a remedy you don't have to go
[1:44:06] to the doctor to get help you don't have
[1:44:09] to run to the preacher to get prayer you
[1:44:11] have the gift right in your own life
[1:44:15] you change your thoughts
[1:44:18] you can change your mood
[1:44:20] somebody said what do i do if i'm
[1:44:22] feeling jealous i start saying i'm not
[1:44:24] jealous i'm not jealous i'm not jealous
[1:44:26] i'm not really jealous i'm not you try
[1:44:28] that let's see how that works
[1:44:31] because your mouth is saying i'm not
[1:44:33] jealous and your mind is saying yes i am
[1:44:36] so that is a conflict that's not going
[1:44:38] to bring you to any victory but if
[1:44:40] you'll take a few moments to reflect on
[1:44:42] god's goodness
[1:44:45] god's not good to some of you i thought
[1:44:47] he was but he must not be but he's good
[1:44:49] to me
[1:44:51] and every time i find myself in a foul
[1:44:53] mood if i can just take that moment to
[1:44:56] say wait a minute i don't have to live
[1:44:58] the rest of my day like that
[1:45:00] i don't have to go through the rest of
[1:45:01] this trial with that kind of a spirit on
[1:45:04] me
[1:45:05] i can just lift up my hand and start
[1:45:08] giving god praise for what he has done
[1:45:11] for who he is for how worthy he
[1:45:14] is and it starts moving somebody said i
[1:45:17] just don't believe it's that simple
[1:45:18] god's word's true
[1:45:21] god's word's true
[1:45:23] i believe it works
[1:45:25] thoughts create your moods
[1:45:27] you need to spend more time thinking
[1:45:28] about what you're thinking about
[1:45:31] your life is an expression of your
[1:45:33] thoughts
[1:45:34] be careful what you think about because
[1:45:36] you become what you think about a few
[1:45:38] weeks ago i gave you a few examples of
[1:45:40] some negative thought patterns
[1:45:42] i'm going to slow them down and read
[1:45:44] them to you this morning before we move
[1:45:46] into something else
[1:45:47] because i knew i couldn't get to where i
[1:45:49] needed to go unless i reminded you of
[1:45:51] what you've already heard
[1:45:52] number one obsessively dwelling on an
[1:45:55] unpleasant event
[1:45:58] you don't do that do you
[1:46:04] did you know you can go back and revisit
[1:46:06] an unpleasant event
[1:46:08] and it can affect you almost the exact
[1:46:10] same way that it did when you were under
[1:46:12] the gun
[1:46:16] a time that you were challenged a time
[1:46:18] that you were rebuked a time that you
[1:46:21] were going through something difficult a
[1:46:23] time that someone made you feel a
[1:46:25] certain way and you let your thoughts go
[1:46:27] back to that event
[1:46:30] we can't always keep that from happening
[1:46:32] but we can determine how long we hang
[1:46:34] out there
[1:46:36] you own the real estate of your mind
[1:46:38] it doesn't belong to the devil
[1:46:41] he's not really the problem here
[1:46:44] we become the problem here
[1:46:47] because there's a certain part of us
[1:46:50] who get a certain sense of satisfaction
[1:46:53] when we go back and linger in that
[1:46:56] unpleasant event
[1:47:03] there's a little bit of self-punishment
[1:47:07] a little bit of pleasure
[1:47:10] all mixed into one
[1:47:13] when we go back live it again and then
[1:47:16] justify
[1:47:18] our reaction
[1:47:21] seeing everything
[1:47:22] as black or white with no middle ground
[1:47:24] i want you to know there are certain
[1:47:27] situations
[1:47:29] where a compromise is necessary for
[1:47:32] survival
[1:47:34] i'm not preaching compromise
[1:47:37] but i'm telling you there are certain
[1:47:39] situations
[1:47:40] that you can come to as an impasse
[1:47:43] and the only way to get over them and
[1:47:45] through them is to come up with a
[1:47:47] solution
[1:47:49] where both sides are giving and
[1:47:51] hopefully both sides are taking you take
[1:47:54] that into consideration
[1:47:56] forgiving one another and you move
[1:47:58] forward
[1:48:00] because sometimes
[1:48:03] our minds
[1:48:04] in reflection
[1:48:06] will make it black and white
[1:48:09] when really there's a little gray in
[1:48:10] there
[1:48:11] and if the only gray that's in there is
[1:48:13] your memory that's enough to keep us
[1:48:15] stirred because sometimes we can forget
[1:48:18] the details i don't care who you are
[1:48:20] you can sometimes forget every detail
[1:48:23] always using words like always and never
[1:48:29] i never get a break
[1:48:35] i never win anything
[1:48:39] i always am the odd man out
[1:48:44] these are testimonies
[1:48:46] of very negative thought patterns
[1:48:49] always jumping to conclusions
[1:48:52] most of us really don't need the gem
[1:48:57] because we get all the exercise we need
[1:48:59] jumping to conclusions
[1:49:02] constantly already assuming
[1:49:09] judging motive
[1:49:11] knowing exactly what's in somebody's
[1:49:13] heart there's only one way you can do
[1:49:15] that and that's if the holy ghost
[1:49:18] should gift you to see it
[1:49:20] otherwise you have no idea what's going
[1:49:22] on in somebody's heart
[1:49:24] taking everything personal
[1:49:26] everything personal
[1:49:28] oh that's one of the hardest things we
[1:49:30] can do is realize it's not all about us
[1:49:36] i said us
[1:49:38] i'm preaching to myself
[1:49:39] always blaming yourself for things
[1:49:42] outside of your control
[1:49:45] always apologizing for things outside of
[1:49:47] your control
[1:49:51] if you're not if you're apologizing all
[1:49:52] the time for things you have nothing to
[1:49:54] do with you're owning stuff that doesn't
[1:49:55] belong to you
[1:49:58] i'm not talking about being polite
[1:50:02] how many of you have ever had somebody
[1:50:03] to bump into you and you real kindly
[1:50:05] said excuse me pardon me i'm sorry
[1:50:08] sometimes we do that to be polite even
[1:50:10] though we're not the ones
[1:50:12] who need to slow down
[1:50:15] now remember you got to say it right
[1:50:19] you can't say excuse
[1:50:22] me i'm sorry
[1:50:26] pardon me
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] i'm not talking about being polite i'm
[1:50:31] talking about always taking the blame
[1:50:35] you see there's two extremes in negative
[1:50:37] thought patterns one is always blaming
[1:50:39] yourself and the other is always blaming
[1:50:42] everybody else
[1:50:43] there's a balance in taking
[1:50:44] responsibility for your actions and
[1:50:46] thoughts
[1:50:47] there's a balance
[1:50:50] blaming yourself for things outside of
[1:50:51] your control being driven by should'ves
[1:50:54] shouldn'ts guilts could'ves would'ves
[1:50:58] wished it would have been this way
[1:51:01] i think one of the things that grieves
[1:51:02] me the most in this hour of uncertainty
[1:51:05] with so much death around us
[1:51:07] it's when people say things like if he'd
[1:51:09] only had another doctor
[1:51:12] if she would have only had another
[1:51:14] hospital
[1:51:17] these are situations that will not
[1:51:19] produce anything in you but more grief
[1:51:24] and actually more fear
[1:51:26] you've got to understand as i do that
[1:51:28] god is sovereign
[1:51:31] i heard a new one recently where someone
[1:51:34] said if they would have just let me in
[1:51:36] that i see you i know that i could have
[1:51:39] prayed the prayer of faith and he would
[1:51:41] have lived
[1:51:44] i want you to think about the weirdness
[1:51:45] of what you're saying
[1:51:48] you mean there's a prayer that can't get
[1:51:50] through a wall
[1:51:53] you mean there's faith that can't reach
[1:51:55] beyond restriction
[1:51:58] let me tell you something you don't have
[1:52:00] to be on location to pray the prayer of
[1:52:02] faith
[1:52:04] but if god has another plan we want to
[1:52:07] bless him
[1:52:09] and we want to bless his plan
[1:52:13] and the last one i have here is going to
[1:52:15] any length imaginable just to be right
[1:52:20] i told you recently that there are three
[1:52:22] t's involved in disease
[1:52:25] 75 to 98 of all current mental physical
[1:52:29] emotional and behavioral illnesses come
[1:52:31] from thought life
[1:52:33] 75 to 98
[1:52:36] you say that's a huge gap it is because
[1:52:38] there's so many different variations of
[1:52:39] the study
[1:52:41] and then the other part of disease is
[1:52:43] thoughts and excuse me toxins and trauma
[1:52:47] so the three main causes of all forms of
[1:52:49] disease are thoughts
[1:52:53] toxins
[1:52:55] trauma
[1:52:56] what trauma can sometimes also be
[1:52:58] related to the thoughts
[1:53:00] but the body can also retain trauma on a
[1:53:03] cellular level
[1:53:06] because we have that amygdala
[1:53:09] we'll talk about that in just a moment
[1:53:11] and we've already talked about that but
[1:53:13] we're back there again
[1:53:15] we learned last week that what you hear
[1:53:17] directly affects what you think
[1:53:19] i'm going to hurry
[1:53:21] that directly affects what you do
[1:53:23] we talked about a negativity bias
[1:53:28] i don't know how many people this week
[1:53:30] reached out to me to say i never thought
[1:53:32] of it never heard it i've never heard
[1:53:33] the term either but i realize now that i
[1:53:35] have a negativity for a bias a
[1:53:38] negativity bias the word bias is a
[1:53:41] disproportionate weight
[1:53:44] in favor of or against an idea or thing
[1:53:48] usually in a way that is close-minded or
[1:53:51] prejudicial or unfair
[1:53:53] biases can be innate or can be learned
[1:53:56] people may develop biases for or against
[1:53:58] an individual a group or a belief and it
[1:54:01] is also possible neuroscientists have
[1:54:04] told us that it's also possible to form
[1:54:06] a negative bias or a negativity bias so
[1:54:10] that it's easier for us to think and
[1:54:12] accept negative thoughts
[1:54:14] than it is to accept
[1:54:16] think and accept positive thoughts
[1:54:19] one neuroscience said scientists said
[1:54:22] think of it this way if you have a
[1:54:24] negativity bias your mind is like velcro
[1:54:28] for negative thoughts
[1:54:30] when they pass close enough your mind
[1:54:33] your bias the bias in your mind
[1:54:36] catches that negative
[1:54:38] and you see everything from a negative
[1:54:40] perspective
[1:54:42] if you are a positive person and you
[1:54:44] have more of a positivity bias the the
[1:54:48] neuroscientist said your your mind is
[1:54:50] like teflon
[1:54:52] it's nonstick
[1:54:55] there are people that have a bias for
[1:54:58] positivity i'd like to be that
[1:55:00] i don't think i'm there but i'd like to
[1:55:02] be that
[1:55:03] i'd like to be somebody that when a
[1:55:06] negative thought comes
[1:55:08] the teflon of my mind
[1:55:11] will not receive it
[1:55:13] and it just slides right off
[1:55:16] because i've replaced that that part of
[1:55:18] me that has a tendency toward the
[1:55:21] negative
[1:55:23] in other words i've already mentioned
[1:55:24] the velcro your positive thoughts can
[1:55:26] actually change your brain waves
[1:55:31] it's amazing
[1:55:33] it can actually influence the frequency
[1:55:36] that your body operates on
[1:55:40] our bodies are electromagnetic and they
[1:55:43] operate on frequency
[1:55:45] and there are things that we do that
[1:55:47] lower our frequency and there are things
[1:55:49] that we do that raise our frequency
[1:55:52] if we could raise our frequency and
[1:55:54] never let it drop below a certain point
[1:55:57] we would never face the majority of
[1:56:01] diseases that we face
[1:56:04] come on
[1:56:06] somebody said i just don't know if
[1:56:07] that's true in fact someone argued with
[1:56:09] me not too long ago about it and then
[1:56:11] began to talk to me about acidity and
[1:56:13] alkaline being whether you're acidic or
[1:56:15] alkaline
[1:56:18] and they were explaining to me that all
[1:56:19] diseases are caused by that and that's
[1:56:21] absolutely a fact
[1:56:23] it affects a lot of what's going on now
[1:56:26] i need to tell you
[1:56:28] that negative thinkers are almost always
[1:56:31] acidic
[1:56:35] because your body responds your brain
[1:56:38] chemicals respond to what you're
[1:56:40] thinking no wonder the bible said as a
[1:56:43] man thinks he is
[1:56:46] because you're affecting everything so
[1:56:48] this is one of the ways you and i can
[1:56:50] become the enemy that's formed against
[1:56:52] ourselves
[1:56:54] so we're saying lord you said lord you
[1:56:56] said you said no weapon formed against
[1:56:58] me and you're quoting the right
[1:57:00] scripture but you're doing something
[1:57:02] different in your mind
[1:57:05] so you're fighting but you're really
[1:57:07] beating the air
[1:57:08] because your attack is not coming from
[1:57:10] the external
[1:57:14] it's coming from the battlefield of the
[1:57:16] mind are you still here i'm doing good
[1:57:18] for time so don't look at me funny
[1:57:21] the majority of us have some negative
[1:57:23] thought patterns programmed in our
[1:57:25] subconscious without us being even aware
[1:57:27] of it these negative thoughts influence
[1:57:29] your brain frequency levels to the point
[1:57:32] where you may feel tired
[1:57:34] did you know negative thoughts can make
[1:57:36] you feel tired
[1:57:39] how many of you get in a situation where
[1:57:41] there's a lot of negative a lot of
[1:57:42] pressure a lot of stress and and when
[1:57:44] you're done it you are
[1:57:46] totally
[1:57:48] totally wiped out
[1:57:50] no physical inertia used
[1:57:52] you didn't do any physical work
[1:57:54] it was all mental it was all stress it
[1:57:56] was all all the emotional and the
[1:57:58] thinking and so forth i had one of those
[1:58:00] not too too long ago where you realize i
[1:58:02] didn't do anything physical
[1:58:04] it's just the stress of the whole thing
[1:58:06] makes you feel like you've absolutely
[1:58:09] lost all energy
[1:58:10] it's it's real
[1:58:12] what we're talking about is real your
[1:58:15] negative thoughts are having an impact
[1:58:17] on your energy level on your body and if
[1:58:20] that's the case and we know it's the
[1:58:21] case by neuroscience then we can do
[1:58:23] something about that by thinking happy
[1:58:25] thoughts well i'm not capable you may be
[1:58:28] but i don't seem to be capable of just
[1:58:29] thinking happy when i want to think
[1:58:31] happy
[1:58:32] so you know what i do i go to god's word
[1:58:34] i go to what makes me happy
[1:58:38] i go to what makes me happy and the next
[1:58:40] thing you know my thoughts follow where
[1:58:41] my heart has led me
[1:58:44] i'm telling you it works i'm telling you
[1:58:46] what i do i'm telling you how i get
[1:58:48] through life
[1:58:50] we sometimes stumble we sometimes forget
[1:58:52] what we know
[1:58:54] but when we remember
[1:58:56] sometimes our brain frequency levels are
[1:58:59] so affected by our thoughts that we feel
[1:59:01] tired we feel frustrated have you ever
[1:59:05] felt and responded frustrated and you
[1:59:07] didn't even know why you were frustrated
[1:59:10] and somebody says what's wrong with you
[1:59:12] and your answer is i don't know and of
[1:59:14] course you know
[1:59:17] [Applause]
[1:59:20] and a lot of times we do and we just
[1:59:21] don't want to say
[1:59:24] you are you ought to fool your family
[1:59:26] sometimes just tell them why what's
[1:59:28] really wrong
[1:59:29] you
[1:59:32] you wanna know what's wrong you
[1:59:35] you're what's wrong
[1:59:37] but sometimes we just say nothing no no
[1:59:39] no no no no no
[1:59:41] nothing's wrong
[1:59:42] then why are you so ill why are you
[1:59:45] acting why are you so frustrated why are
[1:59:47] you snapping at everybody for no reason
[1:59:50] we don't even know sometimes and and the
[1:59:52] reason why we're so frustrated is
[1:59:54] because our negative thoughts
[1:59:57] have had a negative impact
[2:00:00] on our frequencies
[2:00:02] our brain waves dip
[2:00:05] if you if you can measure that and you
[2:00:07] can i can't but you can have it done
[2:00:11] in fact there's a great very well-known
[2:00:13] clinic in atlanta
[2:00:15] where you can go and have your have your
[2:00:18] brain under all of those different
[2:00:19] they'll they'll put your brain under all
[2:00:21] those special electromagnetic
[2:00:24] radar
[2:00:25] uh machines and they can tell
[2:00:29] what certain thoughts
[2:00:31] will cause your brain to light up the
[2:00:33] most
[2:00:36] what causes your brain
[2:00:38] to actually shrink
[2:00:42] and atrophy
[2:00:44] and what causes your brain to thrive
[2:00:47] you want to get under whatever makes you
[2:00:49] thrive
[2:00:50] and if you're a son of god the word does
[2:00:52] that come on well not your preaching
[2:00:55] well good i'm glad you're not stuck with
[2:00:56] just my preaching
[2:00:59] i'm so glad you got more to get a hold
[2:01:02] of in the word than just my preaching
[2:01:04] i'm glad you've got the table on your
[2:01:06] phone and you've got your bible in your
[2:01:08] lap
[2:01:10] you should have plenty of positivity by
[2:01:13] listening to the word of god that's been
[2:01:15] stored for us for this hour
[2:01:17] and so we can feel tired and frustrated
[2:01:20] and stressed out and angry little
[2:01:22] children straight i'm stressed
[2:01:26] it may not be the stress that you and i
[2:01:28] face but they also can feel by being in
[2:01:30] a negative environment
[2:01:32] don't tell your children they're weird
[2:01:38] oh you may be
[2:01:40] and they may be behaving weird because
[2:01:42] you are weird
[2:01:44] but they're not weird
[2:01:46] they will never thrive in that
[2:01:47] environment you cannot speak that and
[2:01:49] you say but they know i'm kidding they
[2:01:52] do not have that ability to know
[2:01:54] and their brain doesn't have the ability
[2:01:56] to know
[2:01:57] you speak life over them
[2:02:00] you don't tell them they're clumsy
[2:02:06] have we ever have we ever fallen yes do
[2:02:09] we ever make a mess absolutely do we
[2:02:11] ever let things come out of our mouth
[2:02:12] that shouldn't come out of our mouth
[2:02:13] absolutely but these words can affect
[2:02:16] how the brain waves of even our children
[2:02:19] respond
[2:02:20] god wants us to have there's a remedy
[2:02:22] for this
[2:02:23] this is a vicious vicious cycle that can
[2:02:25] be difficult to break i want to read two
[2:02:28] paragraphs to you about cardiovascular
[2:02:29] disease
[2:02:32] this was a study
[2:02:34] men who believed
[2:02:36] that their risk
[2:02:38] of suffering from cardiovascular disease
[2:02:40] was lower than average
[2:02:44] men who believed for whatever reason
[2:02:47] that their risk of cardiovascular
[2:02:50] disease was lower than average
[2:02:54] they were three times less likely to die
[2:02:58] from heart attacks
[2:03:00] and strokes
[2:03:02] than men who believed otherwise
[2:03:05] this was found in a 15-year study
[2:03:08] conducted by the university of rochester
[2:03:10] medical center and the researcher's name
[2:03:12] was robert grambling
[2:03:15] he determined that what you believe
[2:03:18] about your risk
[2:03:21] to get cardiovascular disease could
[2:03:24] affect
[2:03:25] whether or not you die
[2:03:28] from cardiovascular disease someone said
[2:03:31] that doesn't sound like the word we need
[2:03:32] to hear this morning did anybody hear
[2:03:34] brother branham say do
[2:03:36] not fear cancer
[2:03:42] do not fear cancer
[2:03:45] because you attract what you fear
[2:03:49] your body responds to fearful thoughts
[2:03:58] google is killing people
[2:04:03] put that in the clip and send it out
[2:04:04] there
[2:04:06] google is killing people
[2:04:08] because they have a they have a symptom
[2:04:14] they go to google
[2:04:16] i just want you to notice sometimes how
[2:04:17] broad those symptoms can be
[2:04:21] how many of you know kovid used to have
[2:04:23] three symptoms
[2:04:26] now it has 550.
[2:04:28] [Applause]
[2:04:30] so if you've got any of those 550 you're
[2:04:32] sure you got it
[2:04:34] if you read in the and you're looking up
[2:04:36] your symptoms and it takes you to cancer
[2:04:39] i know people in this church that have
[2:04:41] told people they had cancer when they
[2:04:42] didn't have cancer
[2:04:45] because they thought maybe they did
[2:04:49] and you go back and well well i just had
[2:04:51] to say oh brother sister
[2:04:55] that is definitely a negativity bias
[2:05:03] don't you let the enemy trick you that
[2:05:05] way
[2:05:06] don't you become the weapon formed
[2:05:08] against your own life
[2:05:11] just say hey i don't care what the
[2:05:12] symptoms are
[2:05:14] i know what god's word has
[2:05:19] said
[2:05:20] and i'm going to stay with that
[2:05:24] there are professionals out there to
[2:05:26] help diagnose you
[2:05:28] not dr google
[2:05:30] amen
[2:05:32] amen
[2:05:33] in dr karina davidson's 10-year study
[2:05:37] on
[2:05:38] 877 healthy women
[2:05:41] and
[2:05:42] 862 healthy men
[2:05:45] published in the february issue february
[2:05:48] 2010 issue of the european heart journal
[2:05:52] she uh participate participants who
[2:05:56] reported feeling happier
[2:05:58] had less heart attacks
[2:06:01] than those who felt less happy
[2:06:06] like i told you i i haven't learned how
[2:06:09] to turn on my my happy thought
[2:06:12] but what i have learned to do is there's
[2:06:14] something that leads me to happier
[2:06:15] thoughts
[2:06:16] and that's reading what god's word said
[2:06:18] about me
[2:06:19] and if i can't always get to the book
[2:06:21] then i can start affirming and speaking
[2:06:24] and declaring what i know god's word has
[2:06:26] said about me you know if you get like
[2:06:28] sister williams has taught us these two
[2:06:30] little simple phrases there's dozens of
[2:06:32] little phrases that you can say that
[2:06:34] will shift your thoughts
[2:06:36] and cause you to think i'm blessed
[2:06:38] oh my i'm blessed
[2:06:41] if i live the rest of my life without a
[2:06:43] friend i'm blessed
[2:06:46] because he told me this morning i'll be
[2:06:48] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[2:06:51] brother
[2:06:53] when we were singing that song i am a
[2:06:55] friend to god
[2:06:58] what more could we long for than to know
[2:07:01] he calls me friend
[2:07:06] and that means he's looking to get
[2:07:08] something out of his relationship with
[2:07:10] me as a friend
[2:07:13] he longs for my fellowship
[2:07:17] when we worship someone said there's no
[2:07:18] need me from worship no need for me to
[2:07:20] worship
[2:07:23] brother shelly and a few others they got
[2:07:24] that handled
[2:07:27] all we need sister flow here
[2:07:30] she'll do the worshiping for us
[2:07:32] how many of you know it don't work that
[2:07:33] way
[2:07:35] you've got to be a friend
[2:07:37] he wants to be a friend to you you've
[2:07:39] got to respond as a friend to him and
[2:07:42] give him the worship
[2:07:43] nothing is more contagious than
[2:07:44] negativity
[2:07:46] oh amen brother
[2:07:48] it's just one o'clock i need a few more
[2:07:50] minutes
[2:07:51] can i have the message testimony of
[2:07:53] raising the dead boy west palm beach
[2:07:55] florida
[2:07:56] brother branham said we need to think
[2:07:58] right
[2:08:03] i need paragraph eight

[2:08:12] sure
[2:08:13] i could have missed it

[2:08:39] thank you
[2:08:42] i can't put my hand on it right now i
[2:08:44] know it's there
[2:08:46] you all not see it let me just read it
[2:08:47] anyway no worries
[2:08:48] paragraph eight of the message testimony
[2:08:50] of raising the dead boy
[2:08:52] uh 1953 is the year i wanted you to see
[2:08:56] this because i wanted you to write it
[2:08:58] down but you can listen carefully and
[2:09:00] write down the phrase when you when and
[2:09:02] you can paraphrase it and get it
[2:09:04] he said here's an old slogan
[2:09:07] and i want you to remember it he said
[2:09:10] do right
[2:09:13] that's your duty to god
[2:09:16] think right
[2:09:17] that's your duty to yourself
[2:09:20] and then you're bound to be right
[2:09:22] now the slogan actually went
[2:09:25] think right
[2:09:26] that is your duty to yourself do right
[2:09:29] that is your duty to god she's found it
[2:09:32] here for us so you write it down however
[2:09:34] you want to do it but let me read it
[2:09:36] like he said it here's an old slogan i
[2:09:38] want you to remember it do right that's
[2:09:40] your duty to god think right that's your
[2:09:42] duty to yourself it's your duty to
[2:09:44] yourself
[2:09:46] it's my duty to myself let's say that
[2:09:49] it's my duty
[2:09:50] to myself
[2:09:52] to think right you want to do something
[2:09:54] for yourself
[2:09:56] that'll last longer than a pedicure
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:00] think right
[2:10:05] you want to please god do right
[2:10:08] that's your duty to god to do right it's
[2:10:10] your duty to yourself think right and
[2:10:12] you're bound to be right he said that's
[2:10:14] right see you'll come out right if
[2:10:15] you'll do right
[2:10:16] that's your duty to god think right
[2:10:18] that's your duty for yourself
[2:10:20] that's your duty to god to do right
[2:10:22] think right that's your duty for
[2:10:24] yourself and you'll come out right
[2:10:27] so if i think right it's my duty to
[2:10:29] myself if i do right it's my duty to god
[2:10:32] and if i do right if i think right and i
[2:10:34] do right it'll come out right
[2:10:37] so don't tell us that it doesn't matter
[2:10:39] how we think
[2:10:41] the enemy's constantly trying to disturb
[2:10:43] our peace
[2:10:44] isaiah 26-3 we looked at it last week
[2:10:47] thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
[2:10:49] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[2:10:51] trusteth in thee so number one one of
[2:10:53] the ways that you can become an enemy
[2:10:55] formed against yourself is to hold on to
[2:10:57] your stinking thinking number two one of
[2:10:59] the ways that you can be an enemy formed
[2:11:02] against yourself is to back is to
[2:11:04] continue to carry offense
[2:11:07] holding on to a grudge
[2:11:09] and not letting it go
[2:11:11] makes you an enemy
[2:11:14] formed against yourself
[2:11:17] come on
[2:11:19] got a lot of amens there
[2:11:21] none maybe
[2:11:23] wanted to find offense for you thank you
[2:11:25] we've got it
[2:11:27] let me find a defined offense for you
[2:11:29] it's an annoyance
[2:11:31] or resentment thank you
[2:11:34] it's an annoyance or resentment brought
[2:11:37] about by a perceived insult
[2:11:40] to
[2:11:41] or a disregard for oneself
[2:11:44] or one's standards
[2:11:46] or one's feelings
[2:11:48] or one's principles
[2:11:50] an offense
[2:11:52] is an annoyance or a resentment brought
[2:11:55] about by a perceived insult to our two
[2:11:58] excuse me
[2:12:00] by a perceived insult to or disregard
[2:12:04] for oneself one's feelings one's
[2:12:06] standards one's principles
[2:12:09] a grudge
[2:12:11] is a persistent feeling of ill will
[2:12:14] or resentment resulting from a past
[2:12:17] insult or injury
[2:12:21] if you
[2:12:22] hold on to offense
[2:12:26] if you hold on to a grudge
[2:12:29] you have formed
[2:12:33] an enemy has formed
[2:12:38] in here
[2:12:40] that works against you
[2:12:42] you didn't need another insult you
[2:12:44] didn't need another offender
[2:12:47] you didn't need another enemy
[2:12:49] if you hold on to those things you form
[2:12:52] the enemy
[2:12:54] the enemy lives between your own two
[2:12:56] elbows
[2:12:57] and i want you to know no matter how
[2:12:59] gross
[2:13:01] how harsh
[2:13:03] how awful the offense is
[2:13:06] you can never overcome by holding on to
[2:13:10] it
[2:13:11] you can never get victory by holding a
[2:13:14] grudge
[2:13:16] we have to cut it off our back
[2:13:18] we have to let it go
[2:13:20] if you believe that say amen
[2:13:22] one of those things that happens when we
[2:13:25] carry a fence and we form a grudge is
[2:13:27] that root of bitterness that we talked
[2:13:29] about last sunday it forms within us and
[2:13:32] when i was asking the lord to diagnose
[2:13:34] this congregation as the hebrew year
[2:13:37] changed this year he spoke to me about
[2:13:39] the spirit of jealousy and and the root
[2:13:41] of bitterness
[2:13:43] and so in my prayer life i've been
[2:13:44] praying about any area where those
[2:13:47] things live in me i want them out and if
[2:13:51] you care about yourself you want them
[2:13:53] out and if you care about your family
[2:13:56] you want them out and if you care about
[2:13:58] your church community you want them out
[2:14:03] we want god to have a better diagnosis
[2:14:05] when he looks at us again he said i've
[2:14:07] got to deal with these things lord
[2:14:08] please deal with them in us and give us
[2:14:11] grace to cooperate with you instead of
[2:14:13] cooperating with the enemy to be an
[2:14:15] enemy to form an enemy hebrews 12 15 and
[2:14:18] i'm gonna rush looking diligently lest
[2:14:20] any man fall
[2:14:22] fail excuse me lest any man fail of the
[2:14:24] grace of god lest any root of bitterness
[2:14:27] springing up trouble you and thereby
[2:14:29] many be defiled it is impossible to
[2:14:32] carry a root of bitterness that only
[2:14:34] affects you
[2:14:38] it will always affect those that you are
[2:14:40] in fellowship with
[2:14:42] always if i would have had time i wanted
[2:14:45] to go over a few of these uh quotations
[2:14:48] that we used last week but i i won't be
[2:14:51] able to do that today
[2:14:53] let me give you one
[2:14:54] i'm not sure that i use this one
[2:14:58] just a moment
[2:14:59] let me just use one let me see if this
[2:15:01] is in
[2:15:08] yeah
[2:15:09] in the in the church age the pergamian
[2:15:11] church age this is not the church age
[2:15:12] book this is the actual preaching of the
[2:15:14] church ages in 1960 the pergament church
[2:15:17] age book excuse me
[2:15:20] the pergament church age
[2:15:22] paragraph 17
[2:15:24] try to do something good and just keep
[2:15:27] being good
[2:15:28] hold no malice no grudges
[2:15:31] don't let any bitterness no matter how
[2:15:34] bad the person is
[2:15:37] and how bad they talk about you
[2:15:40] don't you never think evil in your heart
[2:15:43] against them brother that will be a
[2:15:45] challenge
[2:15:47] but it is a challenge that is possible
[2:15:49] with the help and the grace of the lord
[2:15:52] jesus christ if you believe that same
[2:15:54] man he doesn't ask us to do anything
[2:15:56] that he won't empower us to do if we
[2:15:58] confess i can't do that lord by myself
[2:16:01] but with your help i can do that
[2:16:05] let's read on quickly
[2:16:06] because right there the devil will set
[2:16:08] right in working up something right
[2:16:10] there just keep it all covered up with
[2:16:12] godly love
[2:16:14] confession and making right and do good
[2:16:17] to those who do evil to you
[2:16:21] it's powerful
[2:16:23] if you only do good to those who do good
[2:16:25] to you why
[2:16:26] jesus said don't don't the publican do
[2:16:28] the same see the sinners anybody can do
[2:16:31] good to those that's good to them but be
[2:16:33] good to those who are not good to you
[2:16:36] oh yes that's where the challenge is
[2:16:38] right do good to those who aren't good
[2:16:40] to you excuse me to those who are not
[2:16:44] the sinners anybody can be good to those
[2:16:45] that's good to them but be good to those
[2:16:47] who are not good to you do something for
[2:16:49] those that would not do nothing for you
[2:16:54] might not even help you if you had a
[2:16:56] need
[2:16:57] speak a good word for the man that would
[2:17:00] speak evil against you you may have to
[2:17:02] search
[2:17:04] but you can find something
[2:17:07] i've practiced i know
[2:17:08] and that way you keep all the bitterness
[2:17:10] out of
[2:17:12] your heart he did you wrong but you've
[2:17:15] got to keep the bitterness out of your
[2:17:17] heart and the way you do that is by
[2:17:19] speaking a good word for the man
[2:17:22] there's got to be redeeming value in
[2:17:24] there somewhere
[2:17:25] no doubt about it and you're always in
[2:17:27] love with everybody then as long as you
[2:17:30] stay in love you stay in love with god
[2:17:33] you can stay in love with his people
[2:17:35] remember brother branham said may every
[2:17:37] root of bitterness be grubbed out of us
[2:17:39] by god's sharp grubbing hole number
[2:17:42] three
[2:17:44] one of the ways the third way
[2:17:47] that you can be an enemy formed against
[2:17:49] yourself is to remain in unforgiveness
[2:17:54] now
[2:17:55] i'm not going to finish this this
[2:17:56] morning obviously
[2:17:58] but i will look at it again tuesday
[2:18:00] night god willing
[2:18:02] i'll go through some scriptures
[2:18:04] i want to read a quote i want to read a
[2:18:06] little more science and i want us to
[2:18:08] close
[2:18:09] in the message perfect faith
[2:18:11] paragraph 19
[2:18:13] brother branham said now faith
[2:18:16] is based
[2:18:21] on forgiveness
[2:18:24] then and then as we said this morning
[2:18:27] trying to get the church into the place
[2:18:28] to where we could really see apostolic
[2:18:31] times moving among us that's what we all
[2:18:34] hunger we're hungering for apostolic
[2:18:37] times
[2:18:39] faith you can have all the faith you
[2:18:40] want but faith is based on forgiveness
[2:18:43] you've got to let it go
[2:18:46] it can happen
[2:18:47] automatically it only happens
[2:18:50] intentionally when you take god at his
[2:18:52] word when you go through scripture and
[2:18:54] we will do that forgive people in your
[2:18:56] life even those who are not sorry for
[2:18:58] their actions
[2:19:00] because holding on to anger and
[2:19:01] unforgiveness hurts you a whole lot more
[2:19:03] than it hurts them the problem is it
[2:19:05] begins to like like acid it begins to
[2:19:08] affect those around you and we've seen
[2:19:10] that and we know that it's the truth in
[2:19:12] the mayo clinic
[2:19:15] they released a study about holding a
[2:19:17] grudge
[2:19:19] i read to you what a grudge is
[2:19:23] and from that study we learned that if
[2:19:25] you're unforgiving
[2:19:27] you might pay the price repeatedly by
[2:19:29] bringing anger and bitterness into every
[2:19:32] relationship and every new experience in
[2:19:35] your life
[2:19:36] did you know that by carrying
[2:19:39] unforgiveness
[2:19:40] for an old relationship affects
[2:19:43] all your relationships going forward now
[2:19:47] tell me it's worth it to hold on to
[2:19:49] things like that
[2:19:52] it's never
[2:19:54] i don't think there's anything in here
[2:19:56] that says it's easy
[2:19:57] but god didn't tell us to do anything
[2:19:59] that he didn't provide the grace that we
[2:20:00] would be able to do it with
[2:20:02] is that right
[2:20:04] your life might become so wrapped up in
[2:20:06] the wrong that you can enjoy the present
[2:20:10] there are some people that are miserable
[2:20:12] they work pretty hard at making
[2:20:14] everybody around them miserable
[2:20:16] how do you know because we're not blind
[2:20:19] you run into people like that you
[2:20:21] experience people like that in your
[2:20:23] family and you see
[2:20:26] and no i don't believe that people put
[2:20:28] on their miserable face just to come to
[2:20:29] church
[2:20:30] and if they do god forgive them and help
[2:20:33] them not to find themselves under
[2:20:35] judgment
[2:20:37] i believe the way that people conduct
[2:20:39] themselves in here
[2:20:40] can often show what's going on in their
[2:20:43] life
[2:20:44] god wants to help every one of us maybe
[2:20:47] we don't get our help all at the same
[2:20:49] time but he wants to help us because
[2:20:52] holding on to these kind of things can
[2:20:54] cause us to be consistently depressed or
[2:20:56] anxious
[2:20:58] you might even lose some valuable and
[2:21:00] enriching connectedness
[2:21:03] with other people sometimes you're
[2:21:05] losing and it's by your choice
[2:21:07] are you ready to hear this
[2:21:08] i don't know but here it goes anyway
[2:21:11] beside the unmistakable importance of
[2:21:14] forgiveness in scripture
[2:21:16] now there is now there is increasing
[2:21:19] scientific evidence that forgiveness
[2:21:21] gives us healthier and happier lives
[2:21:23] there are more than 100 studies
[2:21:26] showing the power the healing power of
[2:21:29] forgiveness
[2:21:31] when we don't forgive
[2:21:33] thoughts of the painful act will cause
[2:21:35] fear in the amygdala which is remember
[2:21:38] it is a part of the brain that acts as a
[2:21:42] library
[2:21:44] for our emotions
[2:21:47] the amygdala is a very important part of
[2:21:50] the brain
[2:21:51] it's a library and it actually operates
[2:21:54] like a librarian
[2:21:57] because there are times that you will
[2:21:58] experience trauma and emotion and
[2:22:01] experiences that you are not emotionally
[2:22:04] healthy enough to handle
[2:22:06] your amygdala is your god-given friend
[2:22:10] because your amygdala will send the
[2:22:12] trauma listen to me now please please i
[2:22:14] know you're getting weary
[2:22:16] but it's not time for notes it's not
[2:22:18] time to look around it's time to stay
[2:22:19] right here for just another few minutes
[2:22:21] you can have the rest of your day on
[2:22:23] your own whatever blesses you
[2:22:25] but i want you to hear this
[2:22:27] that amygdala is not only like a library
[2:22:30] but also like a librarian
[2:22:33] and when you experience something in
[2:22:35] your life that you are not emotionally
[2:22:37] healthy enough to process and deal with
[2:22:40] your amygdala therefore sends a signal
[2:22:43] to another part of your body and that
[2:22:46] carries with it the trauma
[2:22:48] somebody said that's just too strange
[2:22:50] for me just remember what the scripture
[2:22:52] said you're a miracle
[2:22:54] you're fearfully and wonderfully made
[2:22:56] god is amazing and he created this body
[2:22:59] amazing
[2:23:00] the problem is
[2:23:02] there are the truth is that we rarely
[2:23:05] have a healthy enough organ
[2:23:08] with the food that we eat and the life
[2:23:10] that we live and the toxins that we come
[2:23:12] in contact with and the thoughts that we
[2:23:14] deal with we rarely have a healthy
[2:23:16] enough organ that can carry extra trauma
[2:23:20] without affecting the function of that
[2:23:22] organ do you follow that
[2:23:25] and so what the amygdala is supposed to
[2:23:27] do
[2:23:28] is send that that trauma on a cellular
[2:23:31] level to another part of your body
[2:23:33] usually a liver sometimes a kidney it
[2:23:35] can even be a spleen your spleen
[2:23:38] and it remains there in cellular form
[2:23:44] waiting for an opportunity
[2:23:47] for you to become more emotionally
[2:23:48] healthy
[2:23:50] because your body knows if it leaves
[2:23:53] that trauma on a cellular level in an
[2:23:55] already overworked organ
[2:23:58] disease is the result that's why every
[2:24:01] person here skinny fit overweight and
[2:24:05] everybody in between should support
[2:24:07] their liver in prayer
[2:24:11] and with some kind of supplementation
[2:24:14] because your liver is the most
[2:24:16] overworked organ in your body
[2:24:20] it processes all of the actual toxins
[2:24:24] and it processes the toxins that come on
[2:24:27] a cellular level meaning all of the
[2:24:29] chemicals that you're exposed to
[2:24:31] as well as the toxic emotions and
[2:24:33] thoughts
[2:24:34] they go into the liver and if the liver
[2:24:36] is already sluggish
[2:24:39] and full of yuck
[2:24:41] your liver then doesn't really know what
[2:24:43] to do with the extra load
[2:24:46] and that is when disease
[2:24:48] can break out in our body
[2:24:51] if we place ourselves in a in a more
[2:24:53] calm relaxing happy state of mind
[2:24:57] and one of the most healthy
[2:25:00] states of mind is worship
[2:25:05] you see god is not the only one and i'm
[2:25:07] nearly done
[2:25:09] god is not the only one that benefits
[2:25:12] from you being in the spirit
[2:25:16] when you and i get in the atmosphere of
[2:25:18] his presence
[2:25:21] we are in a place that in that moment
[2:25:24] nothing
[2:25:26] can touch us
[2:25:30] you're looking at him not just with
[2:25:32] physical eyes
[2:25:34] but you're connected to him with eyes of
[2:25:36] faith
[2:25:37] you're shutting out the world
[2:25:40] you're shutting out those around listen
[2:25:43] people perceive things different ways
[2:25:49] some people come here and they think our
[2:25:50] worship is
[2:25:51] wild and
[2:25:53] unchurch order-ish
[2:25:57] we need to be more like message churches
[2:26:00] we need to do it a certain way let me
[2:26:01] tell you something you can dictate a lot
[2:26:04] of things
[2:26:07] from where you are
[2:26:09] you can post and make comments
[2:26:12] you can talk about us on sunday
[2:26:14] afternoon
[2:26:16] whatever you need to do out there but
[2:26:17] there's one thing you can't do from out
[2:26:19] there in the world wide web
[2:26:20] and that is dictate how we worship god
[2:26:23] here
[2:26:25] not going to let you do it
[2:26:28] not going to let you do it so you might
[2:26:29] as well just back off of that
[2:26:32] when we get in that place of worship
[2:26:35] and we refuse to be distracted by what
[2:26:37] others are doing
[2:26:39] [Applause]
[2:26:41] you can be distracted by other
[2:26:42] worshipers that's not their decision
[2:26:47] that's your choice
[2:26:49] your choice
[2:26:51] it doesn't matter if they are doing
[2:26:53] modest somersaults
[2:26:58] you're not plugged into that
[2:27:00] you're not focusing on that that's why
[2:27:03] sister floor sister sharon or anybody
[2:27:05] else in this church that loves to
[2:27:06] worship you don't ever have to apologize
[2:27:09] how many of you have ever heard in the
[2:27:11] past sister flo say i just i'm so i
[2:27:13] didn't mean no no no no no not here
[2:27:16] you don't have to apologize because no
[2:27:18] one can be offended by your worship if
[2:27:21] they are worshipping
[2:27:25] they don't know what you're doing anyway
[2:27:27] they've got their mind on the lord and
[2:27:29] once you get in that place
[2:27:31] praise
[2:27:33] until the glory comes
[2:27:36] when the glory comes you stand in the
[2:27:38] glory
[2:27:39] and worship him
[2:27:42] and you are in the best state
[2:27:45] for every part of who you are
[2:27:48] for those few moments
[2:27:51] that old liver of yours
[2:27:54] has been quivering all week
[2:27:57] trying to deal with all your emotions
[2:28:00] and all your gunk and all your hurt
[2:28:03] and all your troubles
[2:28:05] when you get in the presence of the lord
[2:28:07] that presence of god soothes
[2:28:10] every part of who you are
[2:28:13] and even when you don't realize it your
[2:28:15] body is processing trauma
[2:28:20] as you stand in his presence god is
[2:28:22] strengthening your body the organs the
[2:28:25] systems of your body he's anointing your
[2:28:28] amygdala to do the job that it's created
[2:28:31] to do so worship is not just god
[2:28:34] receiving praise but you are also
[2:28:37] when your heart is really there you are
[2:28:40] receiving glorious benefits
[2:28:43] you're getting brain chemicals
[2:28:46] washes
[2:28:47] washes of brain chemicals somebody said
[2:28:49] i can't believe you're really saying we
[2:28:51] ought to praise the lord for our health
[2:28:52] sure why not
[2:28:54] why not
[2:28:56] you're doing it because you love him but
[2:28:58] if somebody wants to say hey that helps
[2:29:00] my health it does
[2:29:02] it does
[2:29:04] and we're not that's not our motive and
[2:29:05] that's not what uh you know drives us or
[2:29:08] inspires us
[2:29:10] but god wants to help us
[2:29:12] you believe that say amen
[2:29:14] all right listen
[2:29:16] when we don't forgive
[2:29:18] when we don't forgive thoughts of the
[2:29:19] painful act will cause fear in the
[2:29:22] amygdala the library for emotions which
[2:29:25] causes stress chemicals to be re
[2:29:27] released it raises levels of stress
[2:29:30] hormones and increases blood pressure
[2:29:33] and heart rate this is the results of
[2:29:36] over 100 studies on the effect of
[2:29:39] unforgiveness on the physical body can
[2:29:42] you imagine
[2:29:43] it has the ability to increase your
[2:29:45] blood pressure and heart rate when
[2:29:47] people hold on to their anger and past
[2:29:49] trauma the stress response that fight or
[2:29:53] flight stays active
[2:29:55] making them sick
[2:29:56] both mentally and physically researchers
[2:29:59] using functional magnetic resonance
[2:30:01] imaging
[2:30:02] found that different parts of the brain
[2:30:05] are activated positively when people
[2:30:07] think about choosing to forgive rather
[2:30:10] than getting revenge
[2:30:12] there was an actual test done
[2:30:15] where they where they put them under
[2:30:16] this resonance testing
[2:30:19] and that's why i was talking about it
[2:30:20] lighting up in different parts and they
[2:30:22] said to the people i want you just to
[2:30:24] think about something that maybe you
[2:30:26] haven't had any any forgiveness over
[2:30:29] something you haven't resolved and you
[2:30:31] haven't been able to forgive i want you
[2:30:32] to think about that they measured what
[2:30:34] that looks like what the brain looks
[2:30:36] like with the thoughts of holding on
[2:30:39] and then they measured what the brain
[2:30:40] looks like when when they instructed
[2:30:42] them just begin to think about turning
[2:30:46] that loose
[2:30:47] letting that go forgiving that person
[2:30:50] making up your mind you're not going to
[2:30:51] carry it anymore and the difference
[2:30:53] between the scans
[2:30:55] was absolutely incredible i've actually
[2:30:57] seen some pictures that compared the two
[2:31:00] and it
[2:31:01] really really strengthens this idea of
[2:31:04] letting it go when you realize it's
[2:31:06] affecting you
[2:31:07] it's affecting you in so many different
[2:31:09] ways
[2:31:10] as we choose to forgive the amygdala
[2:31:12] which is the frontal cortex link of our
[2:31:15] brain becomes very active calming the
[2:31:18] amygdala
[2:31:19] the very thought of forgiving someone
[2:31:21] calms the amygdala and the stress
[2:31:24] response and toxic memory that caused
[2:31:27] this place of unforgiveness in the first
[2:31:29] place starts being changed and its
[2:31:31] effect on the physical body starts being
[2:31:34] negated and a restoration begins to take
[2:31:37] place at the thought
[2:31:39] of forgiving
[2:31:41] if just thinking about forgiving
[2:31:43] somebody can have such a positive impact
[2:31:45] on the brain think about what it could
[2:31:46] do to us body
[2:31:49] soul and spirit
[2:31:51] if we do more than think about it
[2:31:53] but we actually do it
[2:31:55] and what could happen in us if we make
[2:31:57] up our minds we're going to be like
[2:31:58] god's word said
[2:32:00] great peace
[2:32:04] great peace have they which love the law
[2:32:05] of god
[2:32:06] and nothing shall offend them i'm go i
[2:32:08] want to be un unoffendable
[2:32:11] we don't let's just talk about it
[2:32:14] let's make up our minds by the grace of
[2:32:16] god we're going to have that we're going
[2:32:17] to shed it like a duck sheds water we're
[2:32:19] not going to hold on to that there's one
[2:32:21] thing you need to know you can't change
[2:32:24] the past
[2:32:25] but god's word and science is showing
[2:32:29] that changing how you think about the
[2:32:31] past
[2:32:33] can reduce its impact on you
[2:32:35] and the resulting likelihood of stress
[2:32:38] related illness
[2:32:41] i tell you what
[2:32:43] you've got more power in your hands than
[2:32:44] you realize
[2:32:46] and the reason why we're not walking in
[2:32:47] the in the spiritual health and physical
[2:32:50] health that god's emotional health that
[2:32:52] god's promise for us is because we're
[2:32:54] allowing ourselves to be formed as
[2:32:55] enemies
[2:32:57] against our own life
[2:32:58] now we surrender to god today
[2:33:00] and we say hey if no weapon formed
[2:33:02] against me is going to prosper then i
[2:33:04] also have to recognize the ways that i
[2:33:06] am used to sabotage my own life the way
[2:33:09] my thought patterns are sabotaging who i
[2:33:12] am in this hour i can't get over w i
[2:33:14] can't get over it i can't get over it i
[2:33:16] just don't seem to be able to get over
[2:33:18] it
[2:33:19] you can
[2:33:20] by the grace of god
[2:33:22] somebody said but i've called on him and
[2:33:24] he won't help me i just cannot believe
[2:33:26] my brother that you're the exception to
[2:33:28] god's word
[2:33:30] i have to believe that you're not
[2:33:31] revisiting that enough coming back
[2:33:34] coming back and coming back and coming
[2:33:36] back
[2:33:36] and i think one of the things that holds
[2:33:38] us
[2:33:39] in that pattern is because we want to
[2:33:41] somehow be justified or vindicated
[2:33:44] that may never come
[2:33:49] cancel culture may cancel you it may
[2:33:51] never invite you in
[2:33:53] you may never be apologized for because
[2:33:55] of what you stand for
[2:33:57] it may never happen
[2:33:58] but you've got to make up your mind
[2:34:03] that loving god and serving god
[2:34:06] and worshiping god are more important
[2:34:09] than allowing the enemy
[2:34:11] to use you
[2:34:13] against you
[2:34:15] so we say to the enemy today you need to
[2:34:16] get a new bag of tricks
[2:34:19] because we're recognizing ways that
[2:34:21] we're being used
[2:34:23] to form weapons against ourselves
[2:34:25] and we know lord that if you reveal
[2:34:27] something to us and show us something
[2:34:29] you've got a way out for us
[2:34:32] let's stand together this morning this
[2:34:34] afternoon hallelujah
[2:34:36] thank you for being with me and staying
[2:34:38] with me
[2:34:39] i want to be whole
[2:34:41] because god's word said i can be
[2:34:46] i want to not only win the victory but i
[2:34:48] want to hold on to the victory
[2:34:50] brother branham preached about those who
[2:34:52] could get it but couldn't keep it
[2:34:54] how many of you want to have the victory
[2:34:55] and keep the victory
[2:34:57] musicians are coming
[2:34:59] we're going to enter into worship this
[2:35:00] morning before we go we have time to do
[2:35:02] that it's 1 30.
[2:35:05] we have time to worship him
[2:35:08] we have time to come into his presence
[2:35:12] we have time to just invite him
[2:35:15] to come and
[2:35:17] allow us
[2:35:18] to experience healing and wholeness
[2:35:21] as we start dealing with those thoughts
[2:35:24] we start dealing with grudges
[2:35:30] offenses
[2:35:32] unforgivenesses
[2:35:36] the enemy
[2:35:38] may be using
[2:35:41] i just saw
[2:35:46] as i was praying uh i mean just
[2:35:48] meditating then and trying to talk to
[2:35:50] you and come to a close and
[2:35:52] make sure that if there was anything
[2:35:54] else
[2:35:54] that needed to be said i just saw in the
[2:35:57] spirit
[2:35:59] that god desires
[2:36:01] i'm not going to tell you the picture
[2:36:03] that i saw it doesn't matter but i know
[2:36:05] from this
[2:36:06] that god desires today
[2:36:09] to bring someone up into a place of
[2:36:12] awareness in him
[2:36:15] that you recognize how you have nearly
[2:36:19] destroyed yourself
[2:36:23] there has been a a a kind of
[2:36:26] self-destruction
[2:36:29] we know that ultimately the enemy is the
[2:36:32] inspiration for that
[2:36:34] but you have been caught up in some kind
[2:36:36] of cycle
[2:36:38] of self-destruction self-sabotage
[2:36:42] in such a way that you've not been able
[2:36:44] to break out of it because you hold the
[2:36:47] key
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:36:49] we can rebuke the devil from you but
[2:36:52] until you can recognize that you've been
[2:36:55] cooperating with his plan
[2:36:58] instead of god's plan
[2:37:00] there's so much power
[2:37:03] when we realize
[2:37:05] that we have a god to cooperate with
[2:37:08] and he has a plan for our life
[2:37:11] and we have somehow joined forces with
[2:37:14] the wrong side
[2:37:16] and it has brought about a destruction
[2:37:19] and a breaking down and a deterioration
[2:37:22] in our spiritual life and i would dare
[2:37:24] say our physical body as well
[2:37:26] i would to god come on let's be ready
[2:37:29] i would to god
[2:37:31] that if you can see that and recognize
[2:37:34] that you would experience the new life
[2:37:37] that i just saw god desiring to give you
[2:37:40] when you could say to him i
[2:37:43] see if you don't you can't if you can't
[2:37:46] you don't if you don't see it you can't
[2:37:47] say you do
[2:37:50] but since he showed it to me this way i
[2:37:52] believe he wants to allow someone to see
[2:37:55] it
[2:37:56] to recognize
[2:37:58] that you've become your worst enemy
[2:38:01] you're actually giving the devil a
[2:38:03] holiday
[2:38:04] and i tell you if he if he's gonna tore
[2:38:07] me ought to have to work to do it
[2:38:09] we ought not to be doing his work for us
[2:38:12] greater is he that is in us
[2:38:14] than he that is in the world hallelujah
[2:38:17] i want you to just meditate as we
[2:38:19] worship the lord together now
[2:38:21] i want you to meditate for just a moment
[2:38:23] and i'm going to give you an opportunity
[2:38:25] to say to the lord i recognize
[2:38:28] that i've been playing on the on the on
[2:38:30] the opposite team
[2:38:32] and i've been agreeing with the enemy
[2:38:34] and cooperating with him to my own
[2:38:37] destruction
[2:38:38] and i'm ready to let the lord break that
[2:38:40] cycle in me
[2:38:43] so that i can give my all to jesus again
[2:38:46] and be what he would have me to be
[2:38:49] thank you jesus
[2:38:51] thank you jesus
[2:38:53] [Music]

[2:44:35] [Music]
[2:44:41] our hearts always hunger
[2:44:46] i'll find something else you want to
[2:44:48] lead us in and just play this while
[2:44:50] while he's looking and getting it in his
[2:44:52] mind
[2:44:53] i just want to take a a poll here for
[2:44:56] just a moment and
[2:44:58] i'm not looking for a big number i'm not
[2:45:01] trying to do that now i just want
[2:45:03] somebody
[2:45:04] who sincerely recognizes today
[2:45:08] that you're fighting against your own
[2:45:10] self
[2:45:11] by yielding and allowing the enemy
[2:45:14] to form you as a weapon against your own
[2:45:16] mind
[2:45:17] and your own life
[2:45:19] and you're you're tired of that and you
[2:45:21] want god to give you the victory that he
[2:45:23] promised you
[2:45:25] and in order to do that you got to step
[2:45:28] down and resign and and say i'm not
[2:45:31] going to keep cooperating with the enemy
[2:45:34] to defeat myself
[2:45:35] because jesus has given me the victory
[2:45:38] i'm i'm staying out of the past
[2:45:42] i i'm going to i'm going to think about
[2:45:44] what i'm thinking about
[2:45:47] i'm going to be more careful with my
[2:45:48] thought pattern i'm going to be more
[2:45:50] careful
[2:45:51] with carrying offense and grudges
[2:45:55] and i'm going to ask god's forgiveness
[2:45:57] to fill me in such a way that i don't
[2:45:59] have to struggle
[2:46:00] for giving other people
[2:46:03] if you could just catch a glimpse of all
[2:46:05] that he's had to forgive you for
[2:46:07] of all the times he's had to just
[2:46:11] pour his grace on us and
[2:46:13] forgive us
[2:46:15] perhaps it'll just help you to be filled
[2:46:17] with that love and forgiveness and you
[2:46:19] won't have to struggle so hard
[2:46:21] to let people out from under the burden
[2:46:24] of the grudge that you hold against them
[2:46:27] now i want you to know i'm preaching to
[2:46:28] the whole body of christ here
[2:46:30] there's a way to win this and there's a
[2:46:32] way to hold on to it and we want to do
[2:46:34] that if you recognize
[2:46:36] that you spend some time of your life
[2:46:39] cooperating with the enemy and you'd
[2:46:41] like to see that broken
[2:46:43] i want you just to step up your hand
[2:46:45] right now all over the building you
[2:46:46] don't have to come to the front but you
[2:46:47] just say i do sure i do
[2:46:50] i i want all of you to have help
[2:46:54] but i want those of you who who really
[2:46:56] need it the worst i want you to get
[2:46:58] everything you need
[2:47:01] to say no more no more
[2:47:04] no more
[2:47:06] the truth is some of what i'm talking
[2:47:08] about is private
[2:47:10] you don't talk about it with your wife
[2:47:12] you don't talk about it with your
[2:47:13] husband you don't talk about it with
[2:47:14] anybody else it's the inner battle
[2:47:19] you don't need an audience you're the
[2:47:21] audience you're captive
[2:47:26] and that hurts me the most
[2:47:28] it's when we recognize that people
[2:47:30] suffer inside
[2:47:34] can't really tell it
[2:47:36] don't really want nobody to know it
[2:47:39] because you don't want to bring nobody
[2:47:40] else down
[2:47:43] we might have others who cooperate with
[2:47:45] the enemy against us sometime
[2:47:47] but today we're focusing on how we have
[2:47:49] lord jesus
[2:47:51] my heart is touched today
[2:47:54] because i saw so many hands go up in
[2:47:56] this room and i know i know that this
[2:47:59] has impacted us on different levels i
[2:48:00] realize that
[2:48:02] but i know there's some lord that really
[2:48:04] see with
[2:48:05] with clear vision today
[2:48:08] how that a lot of their struggles
[2:48:12] could be lessened
[2:48:15] if they would just break off this
[2:48:18] cooperation with the enemy
[2:48:20] and stop allowing him to form us
[2:48:24] into a weapon against ourselves
[2:48:27] jesus i ask you today lord for every
[2:48:31] person in this room
[2:48:33] and streaming
[2:48:35] and archive watching
[2:48:39] that you would allow such faith in your
[2:48:42] word
[2:48:44] to rise up in their hearts
[2:48:47] that they would become actively involved
[2:48:52] in tearing down
[2:48:54] this cooperation
[2:48:56] that has been built up
[2:48:59] between our enemy
[2:49:01] and our own self
[2:49:04] we can
[2:49:06] win the battle of the mind
[2:49:09] we can
[2:49:11] cut off the dead corpse
[2:49:15] the baggage the luggage the weight of
[2:49:19] the past
[2:49:21] and live in the present
[2:49:24] our mistakes and our sins
[2:49:27] and our wounds and our hurts
[2:49:31] that lay on our backs like a rotting
[2:49:34] corpse
[2:49:35] in the name of jesus christ we recognize
[2:49:39] today we can drop that
[2:49:43] we can cut it off
[2:49:46] it's not who we are
[2:49:48] it's what we were
[2:49:50] it's what we experienced yesterday
[2:49:54] but it is not our present
[2:49:56] and lord right now would you also anoint
[2:49:58] us
[2:49:59] to see your forgiveness in our lives
[2:50:02] how far you've brought us
[2:50:04] how many times we fail you
[2:50:07] how quick you are to forgive to show
[2:50:10] mercy to show grace
[2:50:13] to renew us to restore us
[2:50:16] [Music]
[2:50:18] we are so thankful lord
[2:50:22] and we ask that you let us become so
[2:50:25] aware
[2:50:26] of your constant forgiveness for us
[2:50:29] that it spills out of our lives
[2:50:32] and we just say it's done it's done it's
[2:50:35] settled you're forgiven
[2:50:36] i'm not carrying this any longer and i
[2:50:39] refuse to keep conducting myself like
[2:50:41] i'm holding a grudge when i'm not
[2:50:44] i refuse to continue to conduct myself
[2:50:47] like i'm walking in unforgiveness when
[2:50:49] i'm not i just want all the awkwardness
[2:50:51] i want i want all of what the enemy
[2:50:53] tries to tie us up with i want every bit
[2:50:55] of that out of my life
[2:50:57] lord i'm asking you right now for every
[2:50:59] person who feels that
[2:51:01] that you would minister to them
[2:51:04] by placing your finger
[2:51:07] on their faith
[2:51:09] and anointing it today to rise up and
[2:51:11] take you at your word
[2:51:13] oh jesus
[2:51:14] [Laughter]
[2:51:16] i want to say again i know it's not
[2:51:18] about feeling
[2:51:18] [Music]
[2:51:20] but i like what i feel i like what i
[2:51:22] feel god's wanting to do in doing i like
[2:51:24] it i like it
[2:51:26] it's to him we look
[2:51:29] he's the answer he's the hell
[2:51:33] he's the strength
[2:51:34] so i just pray in the name of the lord
[2:51:37] jesus christ that every person that
[2:51:39] raised up a hand
[2:51:41] they will find the grace
[2:51:44] to keep this commitment to you
[2:51:47] to be out of the self-destruction
[2:51:49] business
[2:51:50] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:51:54] we receive the wholeness of the lord
[2:51:57] the healing of the lord and as we stand
[2:52:00] here in your presence let every cell of
[2:52:02] our body let every system of our body
[2:52:05] let every organ of our body respond to
[2:52:07] the peace of jesus christ

[3:01:08] today and always
[3:01:11] but uh i want to share something with
[3:01:13] you before you leave today
[3:01:16] uh
[3:01:21] [Music]
[3:01:26] in the old days
[3:01:28] way way way way back
[3:01:31] when i came back to columbus to pastor
[3:01:34] i was a single man
[3:01:37] and i didn't know if i'd ever find
[3:01:38] anybody who'd be able to live
[3:01:41] with my
[3:01:42] idiosyncrasies
[3:01:45] and love me it's not just that you can
[3:01:48] live together
[3:01:49] but that you can love one another
[3:01:52] in spite of and because of
[3:01:55] all those things
[3:01:57] i didn't know that i would ever have
[3:01:59] children we were i didn't think i'd ever
[3:02:01] marry i mean i
[3:02:03] i hoped i hoped i hoped
[3:02:06] but i wondered
[3:02:08] and so i had a lot of little little love
[3:02:11] loved a lot of people's little children
[3:02:13] then
[3:02:15] and then we went through the years of
[3:02:17] having our own
[3:02:19] and i'll never forget if i live uh
[3:02:22] another 50 years
[3:02:24] i will never forget the feeling of
[3:02:27] knowing that god
[3:02:29] had blessed stacy and i
[3:02:31] and that she was carrying our firstborn
[3:02:35] and i'll never forget the look on the on
[3:02:38] the nurse's face when she walked in the
[3:02:40] medical center that morning and
[3:02:42] that day
[3:02:43] and she said
[3:02:45] i don't know who you people are
[3:02:48] but you've got the most wonderful
[3:02:50] support system
[3:02:52] of any patient we have ever had up here
[3:02:54] there are over 50 people in the waiting
[3:02:57] room
[3:02:59] waiting for the announcement
[3:03:01] that your baby has been born
[3:03:04] that was the most wonderful feeling
[3:03:06] to know that that many people cared and
[3:03:09] that many people were praying and we
[3:03:12] were blessed
[3:03:13] uh 23 years ago when god gave us
[3:03:16] benjamin judah
[3:03:19] he has never been perfect
[3:03:22] and will never be
[3:03:23] until he's in god's presence but he's
[3:03:26] ours and we love him his mom and i are
[3:03:28] very very proud
[3:03:29] of him
[3:03:31] and i think there was a time in my life
[3:03:33] that i expected the rapture to be so
[3:03:35] soon
[3:03:36] that i didn't know the rest would come
[3:03:38] and that god would give us joshua and
[3:03:40] olivia and mariah
[3:03:42] and as much as i longed to have a bigger
[3:03:44] family we don't have a big family i
[3:03:46] don't hardly have any family at all
[3:03:49] except my spiritual family
[3:03:51] and as much as we wanted to know that we
[3:03:53] could expand and have
[3:03:55] uh
[3:03:56] daughters-in-laws and maybe one day
[3:03:58] son-in-laws and grandbabies
[3:04:01] you just wonder if you're going to live
[3:04:02] long enough to see that come to pass
[3:04:05] so it is my
[3:04:07] great pleasure and honor as a pastor and
[3:04:09] as a dad to announce the engagement
[3:04:13] of jenna seiler and benjamin judah
