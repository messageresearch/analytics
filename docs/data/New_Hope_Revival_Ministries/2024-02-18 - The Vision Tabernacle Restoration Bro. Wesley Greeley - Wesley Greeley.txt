they wrote that song Jesus be the Lord of all and at the end of it Marita would sing a tag a and the tag for if you're not Lord of all you're not Lord at all and you know it's a truth I I uh have a live recording from about 40 years ago and uh they were singing that song and she said just a young just a young college Bible college kid and she said you know I I recently learned after serving the lord my whole life and loving the word of God my whole life I recently learned learned that there was a little corner of my heart where a kingdom remained that I had not given him control over and she said so I had to do what anybody should do when they recognize that there's any part of you that you haven't surrendered to him you've got to pull that Kingdom down and invite the King of Kings and the Lord of lords to come and reign in that part of your heart and you know it's so true I can hear sister Wes she's the first person that ever ever taught us the song to sing it here so many years ago uh Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart uh you read the book some of you Thrones of the soul and it kind of It kind of says the same thing there are more than one Kingdom ruling sometime in our life and we need to bring them all down and submit them to the Dominion and the authority of Jesus Christ you know sometimes the enemy will will use that part and we're wondering where did that come from where did that come from and it most likely came from a corner Kingdom something way back in the back of the inner man that hasn't been tore down and submitted to Jesus Christ may we find Grace today to submit all things to him so that there's nothing left there's no argumentative spirit in us there's no striving spirit in us we just walk walk in his rest he's God's Sovereign and he's God Supreme aren't you glad to be in the house of the Lord today aren't you glad to be gathered with Saints of like Precious faith and feel his wonderful presence uh the the words to the song

levels are very low uh they've been giving him supplemental potassium but uh the the levels remain quite low they've come up just a little bit but uh that that means he's in in potential of having uh injury to his heart damage to his heart because of the low potass ium levels they don't know what's causing it there there is a there two blood clots at least and uh but both doctors have said we don't know we do not know what's wrong and so we want to just believe God for a miracle and yet uh and yet yesterday afternoon they were talking about letting him go home before all this begin to kind of come again so I I I don't think I'd want to be home at a time like this I think I'd want to know what's going on and uh uh we want to see a miracle for him we want God to talk to him in this this is not a wasted trial this is for a purpose and for a reason and let's pray that he will uh he will certainly uh put his trust in the Lord and not be afraid it's certainly an urgent uh urgent need we're so thankful for how God has been with sister EVN Fox this week she fell in her basement she broke her femur which I've been told is the most painful bone in the body to break it was just a it was just a a few uh inches I guess from her hip and uh so the pain was so excruciating um before the surgery that they used every pain medication they had and and nothing was touching the pain and it was really touch and go because of the pain you do understand that your systems can shut down because of that kind of extreme pain and there was a a an initial report that came from the family they weren't sure they they just weren't sure but God was with her and they uh she's gone through the surgery she actually called uh sister Alita yesterday and uh was doing so much better she has uh several weeks of rehab uh left she'll have to once she's recuperated they'll send her to rehab and she'll uh be going through that for a few weeks and that may not be easy but she feels like she can do it and I do too because her hope and trust is in the Lord so let's continue to pray for her and the family both sons are are working hard for her and um and her husband and we want to believe God

it's her last birthday expecting this baby so let's say happy birthday to her coming up this week he's good all the time amen I want to share something with with you before brother gy comes to bring the word today um we're excited about what the Lord is doing we uh spent some time together Down Under The Tabernacle uh and every time I say Tabernacle I can hear Steve Curry in the background who who uh you know would have if he would have been here with us this week he would have had an Earthly birthday I don't believe that there are birthdays celebrated in heaven because that's eternity and not time but uh he always called it especially the years that we uh had some food down there after Services there was a time that we did that as we had just come into this place and he would call it the Tabernacle and uh the first time I heard it I thought that that is disrespectful to call the Tabernacle tabernackle and then I remembered that God said everything that that we built on this ground would be multi-purpose so we're not changing the name henceforth it shall not be referred to officially as the tabernackle but if you Snicker every time I say Tabernacle I'll know why I almost can hear it like in his voice but anyway we were down at the Tabernacle uh this week and uh looking at the progress of what is already happened and uh all the old lights are gone and some new lights are put in and power is uh uh is down there again after so many years and uh there are plans for progress and I'll let brother gy tell you about that in just a little while but we had had a nice talk and and I ask dumb questions but I always get good answers I don't know the first thing about building anything or remodeling anything anything or so I do ask I realize that I do ask some pretty uh ignorant questions but brother gy is always patient and he just explains them to me like I like I know you know the details but when we when we come back up in the truck and I said goodbye to him and asked him would he Preach Today and and he agreed uh slightly reluctantly but he agreed and as as the door shut and I started down the hallway I had a very familiar feeling one that I haven't had in quite a while just a sensation we're not living by feeling we're not living by sensation we're actually living by vision and that was the feeling that I had as I walked down I just started weeping because I realized that I had that feeling again of walking in a vision and I realize that that the plans that we had just discussed are very much a part of our plan the plan for the future and uh we didn't know that it would take 30 years to get to this place in some ways it feels like 70 years but in other ways it feels like 10 time flies when you're in the battle you thought I was going to say when you're having fun time flies when you're in the battle and if you can have fun while you're in the battle you should many of you believe that there has been lots of joy in 30 years going into the 31st year there's been lots of Joy there's been lots of goodness there's been lots of faithfulness from God he's never failed us one time he's been faithful and we have had more it seems like in the natural more than our share of lessons but God knew exactly what it was going to take to teach us something now I don't know about you but there are times still that I feel that I don't know near what I have to to know but I know that the one who's taught me thus far he's faithful do you believe that so I don't want to take much time I do want the musicians to stay with me just a moment because we're going to welcome brother gley with a song I can do some more of this another time but I just wanted to put a few pieces of this out for you and uh I I thought I had it all in my mind what I was going to start with but uh let's just skip to um no skipping let's start at the beginning real quickly August of 1990 is is when we begin to gather uh in Columbus um God had done some amazing things and I'll remind you of those things at another time but almost immediately God began to move Among Us in gifts and signs and wonders there were prophecies and tongues and interpretations there were visions and dreams and the Lord was already talking to us by late 1991 uh which would have been about December November December of 1991 he was already talking to us about a piece of property that he was going to give us on March the 8th of 1992 the Holy Ghost spoke in the service and he said I will fulfill the Vision that I have given to my servant saeth the Lord and you will walk upon the land that I have given him thus sayeth the Lord now that was March 8th 1992 I looked at pieces of property after that I found some amazing properties some beautiful properties but none of them matched the vision because in the vision there was a uh a number of cedar trees and they were placed in a unique pattern so that I would be able to identify the land when I found it I had walked all over this place it was a mess the people who owned this place before us had lost their marriage and they had uh agreed to sell this piece of property and before they did they wanted to get as much money out of it as they possibly could so they took the hardwood off and with those big skitters and all the kinds of equipment that they used there were ruts on this land so deep that I could stand in them and you couldn't see my head and uh in the natural it looked like junk it looked like junk land but you know God had a purpose and I got down at the bottom of the hill so it would be where the prayer Chapel sit and the pad is out there if you went down that slope is where I ended up being and I came up the hill behind the tabern Tabernacle and as I came up the hill I looked down and my shoe was untied and I propped my foot up on a fallen tree and to tie my shoe and when I did I looked up and there was the figuration of the cedar trees that I had seen in the vision I started weeping and I said this is it this is the property and uh so uh that took place on July the 28th of 19 1992 so remember we only came to Columbus in August of 1990 this is uh this is July the 28th of 92 two years later um and uh let me see the property was identified by vision and excuse me that that day was not July 28th July the 28th is the day the loan was approved to purchase the property and and on September the 4th 4th we closed the loan September the 4th 1992 and for those of you who want to know what we paid for the original property it was junk property we paid $55,200 the Lord spoke to us that the campground would be a refuge for Eagles the sick and wounded Eagles would find a place to be cared for to be revived and refilled and that from this place he would establish a final stirring for his bride it would be a turning point March the 6th of 93 he said I say unto thee greater things are up the road for the resurrection lays off just over the horizon saith the Lord but there's quite a hill to climb before you reach it I want to say Amen but I'm going to give you power and strength to climb over yeah I the Lord thy God would say unto thee I have spoken unto thee this place will be a filling station for people to come and be filled and some go away and do a work for me so on March the 1st 1993 we broke ground and Sanctified this piece of property for the Lord's work the Lord spoke to us multiple times with tongues interpretation and prophecy confirming over and over that we were walking in the vision and that he would give the Word of Deliverance that would set people free he also told us that we must step forward and claim his promises for this place and if we did not that they would lay unclaimed and go unpossessed that's a pretty serious word isn't it December the 27th of 1992 he spoke and said by Vision I showed it by prophecy I confirmed it by the power of my spirit I brought it to pass sayeth the Lord I will visit my people there because we were still there and he was referring to here December 27th same day he said I've chosen it saith the Lord as a place of Refuge yeah I say unto thee men and women will come from the East and the west north and south to that place and be renewed by my spirit and delivered of all manner of evil spirits the sick will be healed and I will use that place as an encouragement to the bride he has already he has already and he is and he will I believe that with all my heart if I had time I would read them all but I'll do that very soon I'll get them to you we truly believe that the paying off of this property was a miracle a supernatural miracle and it looked impossible absolutely impossible but but with God it has been possible and it has given us all the faith we need that every part uh one of the things that I mentioned in a service recently was uh when you see a vision when you see something in the spirit you often see things as they are at that at that moment or uh as technology would would be in that moment and we can give you scriptures in the Old Testament where there are prophecies given that have already come to pass in our day and some of them would have to do with weaponry and uh the ability to to drop missiles and bombs and things like that but remember the prophets of old they didn't know what airplanes were and so they described them the best way that they could well I'm not comparing any of us to the prophets of old but we had a vision that there would be printing presses and that the word of God would go out from this place in printed form now I believe that Vision I believe it will yet come to pass it is coming to pass already right now we have a website that people are reading uh from and feasting on every day of the week but I think it must be more than that but I don't believe it will be fulfilled by a room full of printing presses um I believe that at the time that's how the word would have been printed but we are 30 years are published we are 30 years on the other side of that so it may not look exactly like we thought but the same spirit of God who gave us the vision will help us to know when we are walking in the vision and I'm telling you today in the name of the Lord that what we are proposing for the for the Tabernacle is walking in a vision it is a purpose and you may you may think that that you are in our final Sanctuary but I don't know I don't know how I don't even know why because we haven't filled this one up yet but there is one to come and it is not at the Tabernacle it never was I don't know how uh you know that kind of became a thought among us but it never was to be there but we have a big problem where it is to be there are a couple families living and we're not kicking anybody off until we absolutely have to amen uh somebody said you know wait a minute we we we don't need that's right not now not right now we don't but in the time you believe I believe with all my heart let's stand to get ready to hear what the lord has laid on brother G's heart for this morning he will talk to us about what's going on and he will uh preach God's word to us and we will be blessed today is the 10th anniversary of the death of sister Anna Jones and uh sister Jones was a precious friend of mine and of this ministry and uh she loved us and uh just to be frank she loved me and where I was she wanted to be so I was not surprised when I I look up in Germany getting off the airplane and she's there and I wasn't surprised when I walked off the airplane in London and she was there and I wasn't surprised when I walked off the plane in the Netherlands and she was there because if she could get to where I was going to be she wanted to be there she even lived on this Campground for for a portion of time she was Dutch uh and she was not always EAS easy to uh to navigate with she had lived alone a long time and she was an amazing seamstress she made amazing muffins she taught me how to eat the tops of the beets and not just the bottom of the beats and she believed in the in the ministry that God placed here and she believed in the vision and God used her in Mighty ways when we came and broke ground on this property it was it was she that God used in a profound way to speak of the future I'm sad in some ways that she's not here to see what is already happened and the Fulfillment of what is to come but I think that she has a grander view and a more precious seat where there's lots of peace that she can look down and see us so before brother gy comes or as he's coming I want to sing her song this morning not fire fire fire anybody remember that fire fire fire I I want to sing something I can get when he was on the cross I was on his mind let's sing just a little bit of that as we prepare our hearts to hear the word amen amen I'm not on an ego trip I'm nothing on my own I make mistakes I often slip just common flesh and Bone but I'll prove someday just why I say I'm of a special kind for when he was on the cross I was on his [Music] mind for for he knew me yet he loved [Music] me he whose Glory makes the heaven [Music] shine So Unworthy of such [Music] Mercy yet when he was on the cross I was on his [Music] mind The Look of Love was on his face and Thorns were on his head the blood was on that old Scarlet Road was stain a crimson red and though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked ahead in time for when he was on the cross I was on his mind sing it for he knew me yes oh he whose Glory makes the heaven shine So [Music] Unworthy of such Mercy oh when he was on the cross I was on his mind aren't you thankful that you were on his mind that day at Calvary [Music] Hallelujah and so long before that day I was on his mind amen praise God you may have your seats today prise the Lord I don't think that I'm going to sing anymore but you may be interested in what I have to say here and starting out so I'll just leave it up to you whether you stay or go um in reading and and remembering the visions that the lord gave in the early 90s who would have been here for those sister weam sister Megan sister Alita you didn't come till 995 so you weren't here when these were given right you didn't come till is that correct these were 92 so who was here in '92 stand up Sister Alfreda came in 93 on this ground I know okay so look around and see the few in number that were here then sister Alfreda of course was here with sister Lydia in 1993 March of 93 when they came and broke ground is that right you were on the hookup listening all the time so you stand because I know that you are a part of those that prayed it through and God bless every one of you that have stuck with the vision am we bless you in the name of the [Applause] Lord we're not discounting anybody that's come not at all we're so glad for for every person that God ever sent here I did not get here with my family until 1996 although we visited the first time on our anniversary in March of 1993 so uh and and I've known brother Shelly since the beginning of 1989 so I would say that I've known him longer than any of you that are sitting here um but did not come to this church and until we moved here in the spring of 1996 so it's been a long journey I didn't think when I came that I would still uh be pressing along like this after 27 years we thought the Rapture was going to take place we thought we were going to be out of here uh we thought that the vision was going to be all accomplished and that we would be gone but here we are in 2024 still pressing on I'm glad there's something inside of me that still wants to press on so I started putting some thoughts together uh I'm going to show you a video before I preach but three years ago in this very same season yes I was looking at the Tabernacle yes and lamenting where are the wagon loads where is the Fulfillment of your promise for this property yes he spoke into my inner man and said until a concentrated effort is made to get rid of the debt on the property the wagon loads are not coming yes on February the 7th of 2021 I preached a message building God a house from the book of hegi spent a lot of time laying out timeline details and intersections with heah Zechariah as well as the Rabel and the high priest Joshua and what what parts they played and it seemed like a lot of history and what does that have to do with us after the service as brother Shelly we were in the foyer we were shaking hands and brother Shelly came out there and he was shaking hands and he said to me if you have something to say say it if you've got a rebuke rebuke us say it and so I said I've got something to say but I want to talk to you first yes he's the highest Authority in the house I don't say that because that I'm humbling myself I say that because I know it he's the highest Authority in the house and so I came and I told him what I had in mind but I wanted to to discuss it with him he we found time that week to discuss it and of of what the Lord was dealing with me about and on March the 7th of 2021 I came and I preached part two of making God a house or building God a house it's a very odd time because it happened to be the Sunday that sister Flo had invited Sheriff that's right James Woodruff and a whole host of people from Troop County Georgia and I thought oh my goodness how am I going to deliver the word nevertheless there was a tremendous off offering that was given that Sunday to kick off ridding us of the debt sir we continued our first Sunday giving until November of 2023 when the last dollar was paid and we became mortgage free as 2023 closed out my work became very slow to the point that Joshua River had to take on another job it left me with free time which seems to bring me to the Eagles Refuge Refuge I don't even remember what day or why that I was under the Tabernacle when the idea hit me why are we paying rent on a place to Fellowship when we have an unused building my initial thought was get some power put up some plastic walls and bring out some tables and chairs and we'll have a place to Fellowship so I present presented the idea to brother Shelly and I defer to him because the Visions were given to him not to me I didn't see the Visions I've tried to help to propel them forward with what I understood but I didn't see the vision so I wanted to know is this something that is feasible and within the parameters of the Visions so we discussed it at length and we prayed sincerely and during the prayer time uh my initial vision and thoughts were enlarged some by talking and some by praying what would it hurt to have a concrete floor anything we do a concrete floor would be beneficial it'd be great I thought about constructing bathrooms outside of the Tabernacle footprint but later rethought with the input from Brother Shelly and others we brought the bathrooms back back under the Tabernacle structure in my drawing then we talked about a future kitchen the plan is to take 1/3 of the Tabernacle the Tabernacle is 75 by 150 ft So the plan is to take onethird of the Tabernacle which is 3,750 ft square feet give you a try to give you a vision of of how big that is all of us have set out here in the summer Under the Tent which is 40t by 60 ft which happens to be 2400 Square ft that 50 by 75 gives us an additional 1350 Square ft minusing out the bathroom footprint of 390 squ ft that gives us 3,3 60 square ft which is approximately 900 square ft larger than the tent for your visual for your visual visualization from front to back of the Tabernacle 12T wide is 900 square ft 12 by 75 extra feet I believe that it will serve us well now for now everything that we do is with intention of progressing as the Lord leads us the first thing that we had to do was to get power back down there I've already told you I went and I got a permit to get the poll and when they asked me a certain question I did not give them the whole truth caused me to repent and go back and buy a second permit so that the power underneath of the Tabernacle at this point now has been upgraded to within the code of Lee County Alabama it has been approved by the Lee County building inspections department and we have been finalized and been given uh that certificate till that now that is all behind us there are new lights new breaker boxes new underground power that is all there and it is completed next thing that was to take place was to ensure that the roof was repaired to stop the leaks I put out the word to our brothers from Indiana as well as brother Truman and brother Austin Hollowell and uh I made it in such a way till that it provoked them to come to our fellowship meeting and our brothers that could also helped us for several hours on the Saturday of our fellowship meeting passed and we removed nearly 5,000 screws out of the roof of that building oh after the screws were removed we took a wire brush and wire brushed where the screw had been because many of the screws when they were driven the the those of you that know anything about a metal roof there's a rubber washer that becomes disintegrated and then the metal that's on top was starting to rust the roof and over the years water had caused rust spots and in some place had eaten the metal away so we wire brushed those Rusty spots we took a specialized caul and put it on that spot that had uh been Rusty and a new screw was put back in its place the majority of that was done on that Saturday we ran out of screws my calculation was wrong but that project is complete and behind us while this was being done on the ground in the dirt Joshua Yantis and brother Truman Miller were working on the dirt to keep water from running under the Tabernacle for many years from sediment and water running water the dirt had built up and water was running under the Tabernacle every time it rained I am so happy because Monday or Tuesday rather just before church time I walked down because I wanted to know did it work after the rain that came last weekend and it was [Music] [Applause] dry let's show you the video that we have prepared if you'll pull the lights down this is from the work that we was done on that Saturday just a short video that brother Hawke so graciously put together for [Music] us [Music] [Applause] [Music] than [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] again our plan is to take one-third the right hand if you were looking at the Tabernacle you'll if you have ever paid attention to it the right third is open the middle third is got metal siding the left third is open the plan is to take the right third to close in the right hand wall to close in the front wall and then the left side of it would be with uh we would stud it up and either put uh heavy plastic or an insulating foam board on those studs to close in that side because it's temporary it's only temporary and so that is our plan uh for now and so uh the next step after what has already been done of course is to get the Ruffin plumbing done you want to throw that picture up there the next one the Ruffin plumbing is nearly done that when I it was not wow so the rough end Plumbing is nearing completion hopefully this week we're going to get this water supply line back down there because that plumbing has to be tested with water and I really don't want to carry buckets down there nor do I want to run 500 feet of water hose maybe more so that will cost I'm I'm just going to throw some numbers out so you know that this is going to take some time it's going to take some money uh it the rough in plumbing will cost about $1,400 then a ter after that is done then there will be uh of course groundwork under the Tabernacle because everything has to be set to 4 in for the pouring of the concrete so uh I didn't even put that number in here because I don't know it will require some gravels perhaps maybe just some moving around of gravels I don't know then a a termite pre-treat uh was going to cost about $500 and then my initial uh cost for concrete on the floor is $116,000 uh the spray foam in the ceiling so that we are not being baked all the time would be about $10,000 then the framing 5,000 metal siding 6,000 then the windows and the doors I'm still waiting for the quote wall insulation $3,200 and this does not include air conditioning bathroom fixtures sheetrock etc etc etc we'll continue as the Lord provides and as he uses his people one thing we do know God got us out of debt we don't want to go back into debt what that call that out all right 14400 1400 500 16,000 10,000 5,000 6,000 3,200 excellent so it is my opinion that we need to start mentioning more frequently once again about receiving a first Sunday offering um you all have been so faithful to do that uh what God did was Supernatural it was above the natural it was not uh of the natural God did it three years ago nearly half a million dollars in debt and in less than three years God took care of that debt he used people yes of course he used people he always does and I'm thankful for the faithfulness of God's people those of you that sit here in this sanctuary and those that are out over the camera that are a part of this ministry people that uh have never been here that wanted to be a part and and I just say that uh we've I've already had another church to contact me this week and they want to send an offering for the praise the [Music] Lord [Music] and we have a plan we have some initial plans for the rest of the Tabernacle it's too too to talk about now but oh why [Music] unbelievable it's not going to none of the space will be wasted and hopefully at some point we can open up differentes and still have let me just throw a little tidbit out sure just throw a little tidbit out part of the Talk Is Lifting the roof wonder why and I asked brother Dwayne Jackson while he was here because his family owns a company that deals with steel structure and I asked I've asked Nathan because Nathan has some familiarity with the metal in welding and I asked brother Dwayne I said could a section be welded on top of these beams and he said what I would do would be to remove them lift it up and build concrete pillars underneath of them that seems monstrous but you talk to the right people you talk to the right people and they start throwing ideas at you and all of the sudden you realize this is more doable than you thought it was gymnasium and so we're going to start out with a place to eat have Fellowship that's more important volleyball but we are going to have a place on The Refuge amen where that we can gather together and be together and have Fellowship one with another fellowship is important it's important for us to Fellowship together God called us together not just to come into the sanctuary and worship together but he called us as a body to worship together you ever wonder why that you were called here instead of somewhere up the road why that I I was pondering I was pondering this week about a a couple that goes to my dad's church they they don't seem to live the standard that he preaches and and they they've I I I've just wondered why don't you go to the Baptist Church up the road I I mean it seems to be more in line with with what you seem to care about so why are you here it was just a thought of mine but somehow God puts people in certain places sometimes for great lengths of time sometimes for small amounts of time and it's all for a purpose right whatever that is I don't have to figure it out but I'm glad that God knows all about it would you stand with us as we look to the word today thank you all so very much is there anybody here that's ready to help us get started I mean it's already started but we're just excited that it's moving forward and that God is helping us to to have the vision the the understanding to be able to move forward with it and it's it's not always easy but we want to be obedient in what God tells us to do John 2: 13 here I am again I find it very [Music] odd that in this season three years ago I came here and preached a sermon called building God a house and I was led to this passage of scripture last week and felt that I was to share it here this week and it has to do with the house again verse 13 and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the Changers of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house and House of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house ha eaten me up then said the Jews back up Verse 18 then answered the Jews and said unto himwhat sign showest us what sign showest thou unto us seeing thou doest these things Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up then said the Jews 4 and6 years was this temple in building and will thou rear it up in 3 days but he spoke of the Temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said let's pray before you're seated our father thank you Lord I want to thank you for your faithfulness yes I want to thank you that you have sustained us this week yes you have sustained us our lifetime Lord and we're grateful it's not always been easy but we want to thank you that your grace is sufficient now Lord as we approach your word I pray that you will settle us that you will give us Grace to get in the channel I pray Lord that you would help your servant to yield myself to you that you can speak to us and Lord that you will say exactly what you want to say nothing more nothing less get honor and Glory we pray for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen you may have your seats God you find a very similar telling of this story in Matthew CH 21: 12 12-1 17 Mark 11: 15-19 and also Luke 19: 45-48 people that are smarter than I have stated that these are two separate occasions Matthew Mark and Luke are at the end of Jesus's Ministry the one that we read in John at the beginning of Jesus's Ministry I don't know it appears that way in the sequence of events that are told but when we look at John's account which appears to be at the beginning of Jesus's Ministry we see that as he came into the temple all of the instances were at Passover time John's account it states that they there were those that sold oxen sheep and doves and there were money changers that were sitting there and that Jesus was upset with what he was seeing and the Bible says that he made a scourge of small cords now no doubt there were pieces of rope laying around Jesus perhaps had some in his pocket I don't know but the Bible does say he made the scourge do you know how long it takes to make a whip I don't know how long it took Jesus but I was provoked to Google it and there's a man that makes professional bull whips and he said that it takes him 6 to8 hours to make a 12 plat bull whip 6 feet long I don't know how big Jesus's Scourge was his whip I don't know whether he was sitting there and and and platting this thing for some time or whether it happened very quickly I don't know it doesn't really matter but it's it does say that he made the whip it does not say that he hit anybody now I want you to think about the supernatural Miracle of this event Josephus estimated estimates that up to two and a quarter million people visited Jerusalem during the Passover time which would generate the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars and that the money changers open their stalls in the country towns a month before the feast and then move them to the temple by the time of the first arrivals now can you imagine as Jesus walks into the uh most likely the porch of the Gentiles as he walks in and he sees all these people but he sees the merchandising that is going on and it upsets him and he makes this Whip and then it says that he drove out all of the people now even if it was 50,000 people against one man it was Supernatural but if what Josephus says that there was two and A4 million people that had descended upon the holy city for the time of Passover what a miracle indeed it was was that Jesus was able to Plat this Whip and that he was able to drive them out whether he flipped the Whip or whether he just held it in the air or whether he indeed hit anybody I have no idea Bible doesn't State all of those details but they all left the Bible says all of them yes and he drove out those that sold the oxen the Sheep the doves and the Changers of money now why would there have to be Changers of money there at the temple and you've got to understand that there were people from every nation that came there or from many nations that came there to celebrate the Passover and they probably carried big bills and they wanted to make smaller bills and also they needed the currency that was used in the Temple and so there was this money exchange that was was going on but as Jesus is is watching all of this happen and he realizes the merchandising that is going on now we also understand that there were people that came to Jerusalem that were looking to buy an animal because the sacrifice was necessary that's right was this God's provided way we don't need to argue about that but over time there were men that had devious ideas and they found ways because that it always seems that when money gets involved politics gets involved and as the money and politics began to intertwine there were men who were not born again who were a part of those around the temple who saw it as a way to make money and then there was a a joint effort with these money changers and probably the priesthood where that the priesthood would be found denying a certain animal and said that one's not good enough you'll have to go out those that are by that are selling them and you'll have to get one that is of the right quality that's right so that intermingling of of of money andl politics and corrupt men had had seeped into the Tabernacle to the point where people thought what's the use of me dragging this animal all the way from my home in the north all the way to Jerusalem only for the priest to say it's not good enough so it led to the money changers and those that sold doves and and oxen and sheep it came till that that process became larger and larger and larger over time and the corruption creeped in bigger and bigger and bigger until that it was such a Ruckus that people had lost their sincerity of worship and they were the the The Outsiders no doubt really had a heart to worship right but those that were buy that that were selling them and telling you that your sacrifice is not good enough in connection with the priesthood who had become corrupt then you say the the priesthood was corrupt well just think that shortly after this incident the priesthood are the ones who were riled up against Jesus of Nazareth and had him crucified that's right now we know that all of this was the plan of God yes but all all of this priesthood were conniving to have Jesus put away because of the trouble he stirred up in the temple compound the trouble that he stirred up there when he would come in this being one of the first times that he comes in and he says that you have made my house a house of merchandise take these things away you've made my house a house of merchandise and so uh we we look back in some of these other accounts and in Matthew's account Jesus cast out those that bought and sold he overthrew the money changer tables he overthrew the seats of those that sold the doves and he told him at that time he said my it is written my house shall be called The House of Prayer amen now anytime in the scripture in the New Testament where we see the words it is written somewhere it is written this particular passage you can find in Isaiah 567 even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar for mine house shall be called an House of Prayer for all people a House of Prayer now the the these men had made it a house of merchandise they had made it a place where there was so much buying and selling going on and even though the worshipper may have had a sincerity to bring the right sacrifice to the Lord there was so much commotion right inside of the temple compound till that any sincerity that they have was lost in the conopy of all that was going on it was such a a a vibration of noise that was going on and it was not holy unto the Lord that's right then Jesus told him you've made it a den of Thieves that word a den of Thieves is translated meaning to plunder to take away by force or to wrongfully steal or Loot and Jesus when he spoke those words in in in the account in Matthew he was letting them know that they were were not as holy as they wanted to let on as they that they were that they were plunderers and that's what the devil will do to you right he will plunder what God has given into your life will he wants the devil wants to cheat you out of all the good blessings that God could ever give to you he wants to cheat you out of your experience he wants to when he gets you away from the atmosphere that we create here together and he gets you away by yourself and you start opening up your mind and listening to him again then he starts plundering what God has already done he starts his looting right because what he really wants to do is he wants to inhabit amen amen he wants to do like some of these that have found empty houses and they have moved in and claimed control of these empty houses in the United States it's going on all over the United States where that land owners Property Owners can't even get these squatters out because the squatters have more rights than the American citizens do and the devil wants to make you think that he's got more rights as a squatter on your property while he plunders everything that God has ever done for you and he continues to loot and he don't need it no sir no sir he just don't want you to have it right and so he plunders until that you feel useless and worthless and of no value in the Kingdom until that you get down and down and down and down until that you feel totally black backslid and then you don't want to come to church and you don't want to press into the glory of the Lord you only want to do what feels good well in John's account in verse 17 his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up yes the Zeal of thine house house hath eaten me up now in the New Testament this word zeal is Zeos and properly it means heat figuratively it means Zeal in a favorable sense ardor and in an unfavorable sense jealousy as of a husband figuratively of God or an enemy malice emul emul emulation envying fervent mind indignation jealousy Zeal these are all definitions that go around Zeal so again it is written the disciples remembered that there was something written about what was happening the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up that can be found in Psalm 699 for the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are Fallen upon me that there there's so much in Psalm 69 that is is applicable and and it talks about the Messiah and some other things there that you can go back and read but this is the scripture that this is the the the where it was written when the disciples remembered as Jesus has platted together this Whip and he drives all of these people out of the temple complex and all of those that sold and bought and the money changers and those that sold doves he drove them out right and the disciples are watching all of this and all of the sudden they remember that there's something written about him says the Zeal of thine house have eaten me hath eaten me up now in the strongs uh the the word zeal in the Old Testament is the Hebrew word 7068 I I forgot to write it down here I believe it's Kenan but it means AR a r d o r Zeal and jealousy and this is from color produced in face by Deep emotion then it gives definition ardor of jealousy of a husband ardor of zeal of men for God and of men of God for his people especially in a battle and then there is ardor of Anger of men against adversaries of God uh of men against adversaries an an ardor of Anger of God against men now let me give you the definition of ardor because it's not a word that we typically use from the Maran Webster D dictionary the definition of ardor is an often Restless or transitory anybody use the word transitory okay transitory means of brief duration and and often ref an often Restless or of brief duration warmth of feeling Zeal ardor a Restless or of brief duration warmth of feeling it also means extreme Vigor or energy intensity also gives the word zeal and loyalty now when I think of the word zeal I think of something constant but it appears that the word zeal and it being given a secondary definition of ardor which according to Maryam Webster is of brief duration it's transitory I see in this passage that Jesus did not walk around with a whip in his hand right but there was something that stirred him up that's right for a brief amount of time that caused him to drive these people out of the temple complex because that he was stirred up within himself that consumed his very being at that time that it drove him to Plat a whip and to if if he didn't use it to cause there to come a fear must have been a supernatural fear to come on that many people that when he started lifting it they moved now the Zeal of the Lord is not only for the Lord Jesus Christ neither is the Zeal of his house only for the Lord Jesus Christ the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and if I may in my own words tell you that the Zeal of thine house I'm going to say these four walls momentarily and even the Eagle's Refuge stirs me up from time to time and the Zeal of the Lord's house or the Zeal of the Lord's work or the Zeal of the Lord's property consumes me for brief durations now when those moment of zeal pass it doesn't make me any less of a Christian it doesn't make me any less of a Believer quite frankly my physical body could not handle extended times of some of what I go through in this head of mine and neither could yours right so God in his Mercy send something to stir us up to get us to walk in the vision so that we move forward at his appointed time Hallelujah have we ever missed God absolutely we have have we ever failed him of course we have but he's full of grace and he's full of mercy and his mercies are new every morning and I'm so thankful that his mercies are new every morning morning and that I can come to him and I can repent and I say Lord I'm sorry that I have failed you and I come back to you stir something up inside of me stir something inside of me right now this Zeal in Jesus's account in the gospels was for a natural house a place that he instituted a place that he said was going to be a house of prayer for all nations it's God's idea yet when men get involved and they don't allow these seasons of ardor these seasons of zeal to come and impact their lives and they live their whole life as ho hum ho hum it's all going to be all right in the end if we live that way then we're going to find ourselves the same as they did when Jesus was on the earth and it's going to be a house of merchandise rather than a place of worship we have been so blessed to have some guidelines some go to extremes with the guidelines and we're not going to go into that today but this has been made as a place of worship yes God gave us this it's hard for me to believe that it's 20 years that we have been 20 years since anything has been done and God had an appointed time that something should now start happening under the Tabernacle right we chuckle when we hear the word soon and I thought that it was only people that walked in prophetic circles but I've been amused every time I watched The Chosen when they refer and Jesus says something about soon and he laughs yeah and I know exactly the feeling because soon in my book and soon in his book is two different definitions yes have I ever seen things happen rapidly from when they were prophesied to the time they happened absolutely have I seen things that were prophesied soon and I'm still waiting for them absolutely does that mean the words never going to come to pass well friends let me ask you do you think that they called Isaiah a false prophet did they did do you think when he prophesied that a virgin shall conceive and then he died and went to be with his fathers and that word was never performed during his lifetime and what awful things must have been said about the prophet Isaiah he must have had poison that day and it caused him to prophesy a falsehood and then I go even farther back than that because the Bible says that God told Moses that if somebody comes among you and they claim to be a prophet and they prophesy and it doesn't come to pass he's to be stoned now how does that work out for somebody like Isaiah because if they would have taken that to the literal point and said he's a false prophet and they stoned him to the point that he died because of that particular prophecy because it didn't happen in their timeline right then what because it did come to pass it eventually came to pass will I live to see all the Fulfillment of what God has said about this property I don't know I hope so I just have to tell you I hope so because I don't know what tomorrow holds quite honestly I could not tell you thus sayith the Lord that I live to see the Fulfillment of what I'm doing down there because we have no promise of tomorrow that's right yet we continue to ask the Lord to stir inside of us what he has for our lives for this property for this building for this property we continue to ask him Lord what is it that you want us to do because we go through seasons of time where we walk with without any Zeal and when we walk in a state where that we let too much time go by with really Without Really inquiring of the lord lord what do you want out of me we find ourselves intermingling with the world every and when we find ourselves intermingling with the world then we lose our vision our Zeal our desire to see what God has for our lives we see it Go by the wayside and we just set it aside and say you know we we we even we even come up with crazy phrases like maybe God doesn't really want me to have that maybe that's not really For Me Maybe that's not mine and and and we come up with these crazy phrases like that to try to uh satisfy our slackness to satisfy our time of really backsliding condition and we allow all of these things to overtake us and we see that there are churches all across the world that claim to believe the same thing that we believe and there are different ideas and different interpretations and different you know different um different churches have different things that they concentrate on that's okay yes it is okay every church is Sovereign God gave the pastor the sovereignty over that church to to lead that church that what is why he was put there and they're LED in different directions than we are and God has led us through the years by dreams and visions and prophecies and all of these things and we've been so grateful but one of the things that we have tried to stress in this church in this in in in the arena of our preaching is that God is calling for people who will be separate yes and not mixers right separat and we find that in the gospel when Jesus was coming into the temple that he was seeing the Fulfillment of people that had let down the bars and let down the bars and let down the bars and let down the you know they they they they the the priests came up with more things that the people had to do that's right it was religion that's right they came up when when the priest saw that people were trying to get closer to God then they would come up with one more thing that they had to do in their religious ceremonies and they kept doing this and doing this and then the priesthood became polluted and they started mixing with those of business and those of money-minded those that wanted to uh uh increase their wealth now see the priesthood was supposed to be uh kept by the tithe of the rest of the congregation but as with any man that is not born again you say were they not born again Jesus hadn't yet died no they were not born again they did not have the Holy Ghost the only one that had the Holy Ghost was John the Baptist and you saw what they did to him right and so these men because they were not born again there were crevices in them that they began to look for other ways to increase the money that was in their pockets and as they did they started making these connections with these merchandisers that they would say you know your your animal's not good enough and then they would put these big prices on these animals and the people had to pay it because there was a sincerity of worship in the people that they wanted to come to Jerusalem at the time of the Passover and they wanted to offer the sacrifice That was supposed to be uh offered at that time some of them could afford lambs and some of them could only afford the doves that's all they could afford so as they came and and all of this mixture was going on Jesus saw that this mixture was happening and he wanted to clear it out and he wants to clear out our mixture too he wants to clear all of our mixture out and that is one of the reasons why that I along with our pastor continue to uh continue to war against the spirit of romanism right because romanism it seems like that the spirit of romanism allows things to to creep in and over the years as people and preachers get to the point where that they feel ah it's okay it's you know H you compare to all the rest of the world it's not so bad it it's you know so what if we celebrate Christmas right so what if we have a Christmas tree I mean we're we're not kneeling down before it and worshiping it right right I didn't say you were but apparently God recognized that the same kind of a spirit that was in Jeremiah's day when he prophesied learn not the way of the Heathen he saw it coming in our day and he didn't want us to have any part of it and then we start making excuses through a prophet messenger's words we start making excuses as to why maybe it's not so wrong but I tell you that we have to continue to cry out against these things because if we let down the bar then we become in this place where that we just totally uh honest we allow those things to bring us to a backslid condition and God really wants to stir up this Zeal inside of us from time to time I'm not saying it's 100% of the time he wants to stir up this thing inside of us that we press now this zeal may be once a week it may be once a day it may be once a month I don't know the frequency of this Zeal and for some things it's longer spans of time between the Zeal that we feel on the inside to pursue something again and so we have got to be mindful to hear the word of the Lord to hear the voice of the Lord when he comes to us and he wants to stir up a Zeal with inside of us because quite frankly it's not about these four walls right I do believe that this land is precious to him it is it is the same way as Jerusalem is precious to him that's why that that piece of land has been fought over for years and years and years yes because there's something on that land that God put his stamp on and said it's mine God put his stamp on this piece of property and he said it's mine but more than that he put his stamp on you and said you are mine you are mine and so as the words of Jesus in John Chapter 2 it is necessary for us to hear the words of the Lord in our heart and in our mind the Zeal of thine house hath consumed me or eaten me up Acts 7:44 our fathers had the tabern tacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things and then again in 1 Corinthians 3:16 know you not that you you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you and again in 1 Corinthians 69 and 20 what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so as as we're looking at this today I want us to understand that we're not talking necessarily about the building or the property although God does still stir up our Zeal concerning this property concerning this building because it is a part of the vision because it is a part of his mandate over this house over us so God has to come along and stir us up right and stir he does and when he stirs the enemy stirs does because anytime that you make a move toward God the enemy is not happy because he doesn't want you accomplishing your Destiny so he gets mad and he fights and if there's no Zeal in us then we do like parents do sometimes have it your way uhoh uhoh have it your way we've seen through the years as parents have become non-parents or as young adults teenagers didn't think that their parents had anything that they could tell them Rebellion all worked in them right and parents had to get to the place where they said have it your way and they had to commit them to the Lord knowing that they had placed the token over them but there was a seed of rebellion that had to be dealt with now sometimes God has had to deal very very harshly with people where the seeds of rebellion before that they ever got back to where that they belonged that's right and by the grace of God there have been moms and dads and mothers and fathers in Zion who have been willing to pray who have allowed the Lord to stir up a Zeal in them a a a a a an intensity in them to pray uh like they wouldn't normally pray for the release of of prisoners out of bondage that they were in for these spiritual prisoners that were in bondage that they couldn't seem to get free and because of some of your prayers there have been people that have been set free from the bondage they were in because you allowed the Holy Ghost to stir something an intensity inside of you that you prayed with a greater fervency than ever before because it was the right season to bring them out of the bondage now we can't use that as an excuse to never pray with an intensity but there are times that God stirs up the intensity inside of us because it is a season for moving and shaking and stirring the devil we don't even like to think about stirring up the devil but there are times that God wants us to stir up the devil sometimes he wants us to offend the mind sometimes he wants us to call somebody to get angry because the stirring up does a greater work than just the anger the stirring up causes sometimes people to see their waywardness and it causes them to see the foolishness of their actions and it causes them to come to a place of repentance because they're worked in such an intensity they realize I'm out of my head and it causes there to be a repentance and an eye openening and something can be seen in that period of time but the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and again it's not about a building made with hands it's about the house remember in the Book of Ezekiel where God came to Ezekiel and he said Ezekiel I want you to show the house to the house I want you to show them I want you to show the house what the house looks like whether it be disarray or whether it be backslid or whatever it is I want you to show them where they're at and Ezekiel he goes and he does what God He commands him to do he shows the house the house and that's what preachers do they show the house the house and it's not for us to become angry it's not for us to quit church it's because of the mercy of God that he wants to draw us to himself to become in a closer relationship with him because as the Zeal of the house stirred him up when he walked the Earth he wants the Zeal of the house to be stirred up in us he wants us the Zeal of this house because the Holy Ghost dwells on the inside because this is the chamber because this is the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost he wants us to be stirred up and he wants us to be stirred up with with uh with more frequency than we have in the past because I I I wished I could find the exact quote I've not been able to find it and you may have it somewhere that you can show show it to me but I know it's there where we will speed up and they'll slow down and we'll meet in the middle and if we're speeding up the intensity of the battle is going to heat up yes the frequency of the stirring is going to be more it because that we're speeding up when you're going slow and and every you know it seems that there's greater distances in between the trials But as time goes on and things are speeding up that means the the intensity or the frequency rather of the trial is going to come the frequency of God dealing with us to become zealous for the house is going to be more frequent he is going to speak to us more frequently about ourselves about what is going on inside of us and you say preacher we hear this all the time yes maybe we do but God doesn't want us to carry anything in our lives that is against the word of God even as brother Shelly stood here before I came to the pulpit and he talked about that hidden place in the king that hidden Kingdom you remember brother Brandon preached the message door and a doors and he talked about how that there are people that invite Jesus in just stand right there and don't go any farther that's right but as we go on in the Christian walk we may invite him into another room and in another room and in another room until after a while we feel like that he has possession of all of us and then he comes along and he stir up the Zeal of the house and there's an intensity that grows and there's something that comes up and we realize I've got another room that I've not let him into you remember how in in in three out of four of the instances when this was told in the Gospels it says separately that Jesus drove out those that sold doves but there's a dove that I carry that cannot be bought or so sold there's a dove that you carry that cannot be bought or sold it's the dove of the Holy Ghost you remember in in several instances when brother Brandon would talk about how that we uh we at times we do things that drives away the dove of the Holy Ghost we drive him away he very clearly said it doesn't make you a non-Christian it doesn't make you never born again it means that you've Disturbed the Peace of the dove and all it takes is repentance and calling the dove back and as we go forward in the things of God as as as we mature as Believers we we we become more sensitive to that flight when we do things and we don't leave him out on the limb for extended periods of time like we have in the past we recognize I can't live without you Dove of the Holy Ghost I've got to have you dwelling on the inside I'm sorry for what I did and and and I want you to come back cleanse me and Purify Me and come back and dwell where you belong right but what one of the things that we in society do I heard a Ukrainian preacher say this line we normalize what God wants to neutralize that's it we normalize what God wants to neutralize he wants to kill it neutralize it that it has no more effect in our lives last weekend brother Shelly came with a word from the Lord two words apathy and addiction and there are those who have habits rather than allowing the Lord to deal with them they normalize them is the trth intrusive thoughts people normalize them instead of allowing the Holy Spirit to neutralize them that's right generational diseases well my mama had it my grandmother had it her mother had it so I guess it's part of my DNA I guess I'll have that same problem we normalize what ought to be neutralized the blood of Jesus Christ is against those things generational stuff stub berness that's right my mama was strong willed my daddy was strong willed I guess I will be too do you really want to carry that I don't want to I love my parents I love them both very much and they serve the Lord with all their heart but there are some things that were passed on to me through the bloodline that I don't want right I don't want my children and my grandchildren to carry them I don't even want my brothers and sisters in the flesh to carry them I want the blood of Jesus Christ to neutralize it and deal with it because I don't want to the the I don't want anything that causes the dove to take flight in that day he drove out those that were selling the doves you've got to remember that the doves were part of worship the Lambs were part of worship but the way in which they were doing it was not a part of it it was because somebody had not allowed the Zeal of the Lord for the Lord's House to be stirred up in them and so I just leave you with this word today will you allow the Zeal of his house to eat you up will you allow the Zeal of his house to consume you I'll lay it out one more time you're not going to probably carry Zeal 24/7 yet there's something stirring inside of the house there's something stirring inside of the house that when you see something that is arai in your house in your [Music] house that you deal with it you allow that Zeal to be stirred up you don't ignore it you don't put it aside and say well you know everybody else is doing it seems to be part of society and 2024 you know it's it's no big deal I go back to the you know when when when brother brandham talked about I Love Lucy to us with what we're seeing in advertisements I Love Lucy is so innocent i' be honest with you I've never seen a full episode of I Love Lucy I know who she was seen a little clip of it but so innocent compared to what we see what's out here today yet he looked beyond the innocence of that it was for his day it was vulgar it is vulgar it is not something that we need to be feasting on but it is it with what is around us at the moment it's pretty Innocent but he looked beyond that and he saw he was preaching to the people in the 50s and the 6s and he was giving them something that was relevant for their day because he did not want them to normalize it he wanted them to neutralize the effect that it would have in their homes he wanted them to neutralize it and I'm preaching the same thing today we don't want to normalize the spirits that are around us we want to neutralize them because we don't want them to have an effect in our lives we don't want them to have a future effect in our children because although you may be able to just look at it and say it has no effect on me because you've got more of the Holy Ghost but if you don't if you normalize it in your house and then your children that may not have the Holy Ghost they start latching on to it and as they start latching on to it it consumes them rather than the Holy Ghost something consumes them that they can't get out from under that's right and we got a bigger problem but I'm glad that my God is a problem solver I'm glad that he is a neutralizer I'm glad that he knows how to take the things that we'll give to him as he stirs up in us musicians are coming as he stirs up in us as he stirs us from time to time he stirs us and your stirring time may be different than this brother or sister over here but God comes and he stirs and he moves and he helps us because he knows where we're at he knows where we're sitting he knows what we have feasted on this week he knows what we have partaken of and he knows how to stir up the Zeal inside of us he knows how to stir the intensity inside of us till that we will come to him and say papa the Zeal of your house has eaten me up I cannot leave this four walls that we call a sanctuary I cannot leave it today in the condition that I am I cannot leave because you have bur up something in me that I realize I have to repent I need to get clean of this oh I'm so glad that I've learned that repentance does not take three days I'm glad that I don't have to walk under the condemnation uh and work in my repentance to get good enough for God for a week and a half until that he takes it through a board and says okay we'll forgive you this time oh no no no no that's not who my God is he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and when he came and he shed his blood at Calvary fulfilling What was seen from before the foundation of the world the lamb that was slain that blood came to cleanse me all I had to do was come and repent and turn and go another way a different way his way it doesn't have to run through the board it doesn't even have to run through the pastor that's right it's between you that's right and the owner of this house yes sir and the owner of this house beckons to us and he stirs up an intensity inside of us and says you've carried that long enough amen you've normalized that long enough you've you let that disease operate in your body long enough you've let that ailment in you you've let it be normalized long enough and you said it was just a part of your DNA you don't have to carry it anymore get rid of it glory to God that generational thing that you've carried or I I'm not just pointing at you that generational thing that we've normalized said that's just the way of people we're all built different and we all have our issues oh friends we've got to quit normalizing these things and let the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness we must come to him and say Lord stir up the intensity that is needed as you stand to your feet stir up the intensity that that I need at this moment Stir It Up Stir It Up Stir It Up whatever the Zeal that intensity that is needed at the moment to deal with the thing now I don't know who you are I don't know what you've gone through this week I don't know where you're at I don't know what you've been uh dealing with And discussing with the Lord but you do you do and if you've been one of those that it says well someday I'll deal with it I would encourage you even now to say Lord stir up the Zeal of your house you're the house the Holy Ghost dwells in you he dwells in you stir up the Zeal of the Lord you have song Ready stir up the Zeal I would invite you to come and and worship with us today and you allow the Holy Ghost to stir up the intensity that is needed yes intensity is emotion but I'm not going to judge you by your emotion or your lack thereof it's between you and the owner of the house and he is the one that is well able to take care of what's inside of you let's worship together before we pray Jesus I love you [Music] Lord for your mercy never fails me and all my days I've been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head I will sing of the goodness

to rule in the house of the Lord and we ask oh God that you will have supreme authority and leadership in our lives we desire more than anything else the leadership of the Holy Ghost no matter what we Face Lord and Lord concerning this place you told us to prepare you a place and Lord that's what we desire to do is prepare you a place so that you can come and have your wonderful way Lord we don't believe that it's for for everybody and we don't believe that it's for the whole world but we believe Lord that you have already ordained already already chosen those wounded Eagles who would need to take refuge who would need to be refreshed and renewed Lord help us to prepare the place help us to get the place ready for them to come hallelujah hallelujah thank you for the provision Lord right now we thank you for the provision Hallelujah we have never emphasized entertainment we have never emphasized a place to eat that's why we built everything else that's why prayer house prayer chapels took precedence that's why this place has had preceden here but Lord we believe that you have called us to prepare a place for your bride to gather and in order to do that we need natural sustenance as well and we need something for the young people Lord I wanted a place as you began to talk to me years ago I wanted a place where the young people could come where the church people could come and have Fellowship not just on Sunday not just on Tuesday night but that they would find this to be a safe place for their children and I don't believe you're going to allow the en enemy me to do anything out here on the front that's going to hinder that we take authority over every plot or plan of the enemy and we just believe that you'll redeem it Lord for the good of this body in this house in The Wonderful Name of Jesus we pray and the saint said why don't you turn around and greet one another while you're close greet one another just a moment we're not going to be here but another minute [Music] just slip back to your seats when you're done it's not to rush you but sometimes we take this time and then we go to the vestibule and we greet the same ones and speak to the same ones and chat with the same ones how many of you are blessed by the word we heard today Hallelujah didn't brother gy do a good job absolutely let's thank God hallelujah amen just remain standing if you would that will help me realize that it's not uh that I'm don't I Don't Preach I'm not preaching now we're dismissing all right and uh remember the service Tuesday night at 7:00 and uh uh I don't know there's just a lot of things in my mind and in my heart right now that uh God is stirring it must be the Zeal of the Lord must be the Zeal of the Lord's house so let's pray for one another uh next Sunday let's bring an offering uh and and dedicate it we'll go back to the first of the month uh at some point but let's bring an offering next week and dedicated it uh toward the furtherance of the vision I I don't want you to look at it like you're you're you're giving to build a fellowship hall you're you're giving to finish the work of the Lord and to further the vision that God has given us for this house and uh after that we've got to find a way of making provision for people to stay because one of the things the Lord said in the initial Visions was he wanted places for people to be able to stay when they come to visit that they could stay on the grounds because the grounds were watched over anyway I I'm on the stream and I can't say too much you know I don't know if you have any idea what we deal with during the course of a week but from the time we see you till we see you again we have already heard every week every week we hear the rumors of what others say and uh some of the young people particularly around the message they say well when I listen to their Church they make it sound like they're special haven't you ever heard of election don't you understand that we are special and uh then they say things like well of course you know I told you they talk about our guitar standing up so y'all ought to sit down and they say things like they act like brother shell is something special he is because I know who I belong to and and they act like that place is some kind of special play you know what I'm I'm going to be honest I wouldn't want to give my life to a body of Believers that didn't have a vision for why they're together just think about that don't you think everybody ought to be in a church that they can say my church is the right church for me to be in you don't have to say anything about anybody else's church and I'll just tell you like I've said for if this ain't the place if this is not the place then I'm going to have to find something else but I believe this is the place there's no place like this place and and God will let you feel that way if you'll open up your heart and that's the way you ought to feel about where you're called To Worship I know that in denominational circles people choose churches for different reasons if they've got a nursery if they've got a kids program if they've got a dance class if they've got come on but the bride doesn't choose a place to worship based on on on facilities or programs that's she chooses her place based on the call of God in their life where God has called you and once God's called you somewhere it ought not to ever grow old you ought to be thankful for what God has given us I am so grateful and so thankful and I look forward to the rest of what God is going to do and I'm blessed from what I've heard to today very blessed so we're not going to hold you any longer we're going to dismiss you to go today in the name of the Lord don't forget to pray over these requests pray every day for Israel I know you are we haven't mentioned it in a few weeks but we're busy with it during the week praying and believing God we have have heard of course what you have heard that that many of the hostages who they thought originally were alive were never alive they were killed in the initial raid and and take it out can you imagine can you imagine taking the dead bodies away so that the families would grieve and worry and be concerned and then it trickling out the truth trickling out like now what what a horrible horrible thing to do to anybody to your worst enemy but there are hostages alive we want every one of them to come out alive we believe that God has his hand in everything that's going on in the world God bless you you are dismissed to go in the name of the Lord Let's uh sing that again as you go out all my life and you you can go all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good every bre that I am I will s goodness of [Music] God your goodness you have your goodness Lord thank you for your goodness thank you for your life you have been so so good with every breath that I am in I will sing of the goodness of God all my life and all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good Lord with every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God all my life you have been faithful and all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am aable I will sing of the goodness of God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
