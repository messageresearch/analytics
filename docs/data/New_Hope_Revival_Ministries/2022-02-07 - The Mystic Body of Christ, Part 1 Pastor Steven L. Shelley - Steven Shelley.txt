participating i wasn't on i didn't see it i tried to make a quick glance but i didn't do it but now i i just opened it up and i see the different ones who are claiming it over nigeria over tucson they're claiming that and we're sending that name of jesus out of this place to the nations of the world may god bless every one of you today the netherlands and it just goes on and on and god sees them all and we're glad to be connected with them in the spirit amen well we've had a lot of singing but uh i i want to sing this and i have a reason for it so you help me all right i want to sing um when he was on the cross i'm not sure what key but we'll get it out and you've you really helped me sing right into the word i'm not on an ego trip i'm nothing on my own oh i make mistakes and i often slip i'm just common flesh and bone [Music] oh but i'll prove someday just why i say i'm a a special kind for when he was on the cross i was on his mind sing it for he knew me [Music] yet he loved me oh he whose glory makes the heavens shine i'm so unworthy yes lord of such mercy [Music] yet when he was on the cross i was all his mind do you believe that today [Music] the look of love was on his face and thorns were on his head and the blood was on his scarlet roll it was stained a cream sun ran though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked ahead in time for when he was on the cross he had his little bride on his mind hallelujah for he knew me sing it out with us would you hear it he me oh thank you jesus he used glory he whose glory makes the heavens shine [Music] so unworthy of such mercy of such mercy when he was on the cross i was all is mine let's stand together and sing the second verse the look of love was on his face and the thorns were on his head and blood was on his scarlet roll it was stained a crimp sun red though his eyes were on the crown that day he looked [Music] ahead in time for when he was on the cross i'm so glad i was on his mind for he knew me yes yet he loved me thank god in us oh he whose glory makes the heavens shine so unworthy of such mercy yet when he was on the cross you and i were on his mind so unworthy [Music] of such mercy [Music] yet when he was on the cross you and i were all his mind [Music] let's give him a little praise for that thank you yes yes thank you all yes [Applause] hallelujah isn't he wonderful oh he is so wonderful praise god you know this has been an unusual week for a lot of you and it's been a sad time in the losing of our neighbor our brother who was with us i knew him for 30 years and i knew him well and i'm so glad for the promise that i will see him again you don't have to go to church together to have a home together i believe that and i have no doubt in my mind that we will meet again one of these days god takes care of those things with his precious blood we pray for the family monday i was not planning to come in here i had some things i wanted to do that didn't have to do with the office and yet i got a phone call pretty early or was it monday or tuesday it might have been tuesday morning but i got a phone call pretty early from brother rj and he said someone has thrown a brick through the window which we've never had anything like that happen the last time we had real vandalism was in about 1990 uh must have been about november of 1990 when i turned at cooper creek road on a sunday morning and someone had vandalized the sign someone who couldn't spell had vandalized the sign it always said new hope revival center and now it said new hope brandon might center seems a little strange these days when there's so much talk about somebody named brandon but he was meaning to say branamide and i wasn't a brand of mites center then and i'm not a brand of mite center today because he wouldn't appreciate that very much but that was the vandalism so it was a shock that someone was able to walk right on to the campground and be able to do that but you know everybody just went to work as i mentioned on tuesday night and they got the window that had been boxed in in the studio and uh changed out the frame and brother greeley came and picked up the old frame to get new glass put in it and and it was a little bit hard to deal with emotionally but we got through it by the grace of god sister jennifer came over here quickly and there was glass everywhere and i i couldn't figure out why there was so much glass with one little hole and then it dawned on me it was two panes it had to go through two thicknesses of glass and we had to change out the pew because there were so many slivers of glass in the pew that we didn't know how much we were getting if we were getting it all or not getting it but you know it happened so quickly and then there were other things that came along in the week i'm sure for you it was the one year anniversary of my father's passing which i couldn't help but mark and will always mark in my mind and we'll of course think about the things that we wish could have been but all of that in one week's time has made it a wonderful glorious week because we've had to depend on the lord and hasn't he been good to us so faithful so good and uh i just rejoiced yesterday i didn't i didn't go to the baby shower but i i rejoiced that it was going on it made me feel so good for nathan and shoshanna that god was giving them a baby and their the what they have lost will never be replaced but it's the grace of god to remember us and he's giving them a beautiful healthy baby and then it's been nearly a month since i had seen elizabeth and and she came in my office and i knew exactly what her condition was i could tell right away that she had certainly in that month of being away she had blossomed and which reminds us of another beautiful baby that's coming and and i got to go to bed last night just before going to bed i got to have a little ezekiel time for the first time in i guess four weeks five weeks six weeks something like that and that was a real blessing too we've had good fellowship with saints i've had phone calls from all over the country you might say and hearing from people that god is stirring them and i tell you it's just a wonderful time to be serving the lord and i'm glad that you and i have an opportunity to serve him together and i'm not in a hurry and if you are you just understand with all the kindness that i can muster that the door swings to let you in and it'll swing to let you out if you should need to leave before we're ready to go but we're here for a purpose and that is to see what god has for us i'm going to be speaking today from the book of hebrews but before i go there i want to share with you two little things that i didn't get to share on tuesday night and in order to do that i've got to take you to an older text and that is in ephesians chapter 5 we read this tuesday night and i didn't let them know up there but they'll forgive me i hope ephesians chapter 5 verses 28 through 32 there's a lot of talk of marriage going on with two engaged couples around here and it reminds us that what we know as marriage in the natural is really a symbol of a greater union it is a spiritual union that that is christ and his bride and uh i don't know how often you listen to the oneness message but a lot of people listen to it by mistake because they think they're going to hear a message of the oneness of the godhead but the message of oneness that brother branham preached is not just about the godhead it's about coming together in a oneness and in a union and in a a spiritual drawing i don't know if you know this or not but there's a spiritual drawing taking place and before i forget this let me tell you that that uh sister minkow is in labor and has been for a couple nights now and they are still waiting i just sent a text before i came up here to ask and they are still waiting so we're asking the lord to be merciful and good to her and help her to have a very healthy baby and a great delivery in the name of the lord amen but there's a real drawing taking place and somebody said to me this week who was trying to describe it was that the water's rising and when the water rises and it has here this week and and when the water rises it just raises everything up to a higher level and the fences that used to keep us on one side or the other they they don't get to hold us back anymore all the ducks just float together isn't that the goodness of god to do that for us because you know it's very possible to be called out of a denomination and become one to form another we know the message didn't come to do anything like that but god's just drawing people together and giving us a chance to love one another and there's a stirring taking place and we're thankful for that verse 28 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies that's powerful it's a deep love that a man has for his own body that he wants to take care of his own form it's not just the woman brother branham said it's in the heart of a woman to want to be beautiful but but a man he's concerned about his health he should be and uh he loves to take care of himself with an extra bowl of ice cream and pamper himself a little bit so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself because she of course is a part of he for no man ever hated ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones do you believe that flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone i heard brother branham say this week the word is becoming flesh the flesh is becoming word the word is becoming word that's a pretty big statement and i'm thankful to be a part of that word becoming word word becoming flesh flesh changed to word they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church you may be seated may god add his blessing to the reading of his word lord we need you this morning i wanted to share with you if you'll give me some time and your patience i wanted to share two quotations because we were talking about sort of part two of the unshakable unmovable kingdom and we were specifically talking about the references that brother branham made about the messianic the messiah and the little messiahs and those little messiahs make up a messianic kingdom and it is a mystical body and this is what the scripture said here in verse 32 this is a great mystery and it means that it is a it has a mystical approach there's a level of mysticism or mystery that surrounds the relationship between christ and his church but i love these two places and i i was so afraid in my mind that i would forget to come back and share them at a later time so i don't have to i can do it this morning and i can have two or three themes going all at one time in that rite in the message the supernatural from owensboro kentucky it's in today's document there first quotation paragraph 23 the supernatural and that's the reason sometimes a divine life that's been called and set aside has become a fanatic you ever known any or crazy or a mystic or something to the eyes of the general public it's because you're considered uh uh uh i'd say a neurotic i want you to listen at the prophet i'd say a neurotic you may not have ever been called a neurotic to your face but you may have you may have been called one behind your back and somebody's probably called you a fanatic in your own home somebody in your own family has probably called you crazy psycho to the eyes of the general public i i doubt anybody i know has ever called me a mystic but they probably call me all these other things brother branham say i'd say a neurotic or an or an insane person he must have lost his mind she's gone totally crazy insanity has set in it's because you have changed your oh you have changed your dwelling place they call you a fanatic for christ because you are no longer caught up in the atmosphere of planet earth what moves the general population oh thank god what moves the general population doesn't move you it doesn't cause you to be shaken or moved or troubled or disturbed because you're living in another realm you're living in another spiritual atmosphere he said it's because you have changed your dwelling place and got into a different atmosphere your attitude will determine your atmosphere you're with me i know that's right you don't have to amen but the attitude you have toward what has been made available in christ will certainly affect and even create an atmosphere and it will be a different atmosphere than those around you can you say amen let's read on just a minute because i i got a lot to cover and i'm getting too excited inside over this and your one motive i want you to listen at the importance of dwelling in the right atmosphere he said your one motive your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere more than a new raiment more than clothes more than food you see he's got the lilies and he's got you he knows how to feed the sparrow he knows how to feed you is that right so we can't get caught up in the pressures of of of bills and in the pressures of keeping up with the joneses until we allow it to move us out of the atmosphere of christ and into an atmosphere that's just like the general population walking around i'm going to tell you something the bride of christ we live in a higher dimension a higher realm a higher atmosphere than citizens of the united states of america we've got a higher place we dwell in a higher place we live here in the world but we're not of this atmosphere and as soon as we start reaching out to feed ourselves on the atmosphere of planet earth we become worldly we become carnal minded we begin to get in the rat race and the dog fight of the world around us and we begin to step on people as we climb the corporate ladder we live in a different atmosphere and we miss out on what god has promised to us by living in the atmosphere of christ brother branham is stressing here by saying you're one motive you're one motive your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere don't be moved when people call you crazy don't be called when moved when people call you neurotic or a weirdo or a stranger or a fanatic hallelujah and i'll tell you this if you're not living close enough to him to get some of those accusations you're not living close enough to him because the closer you get to him the more misunderstood you're going to be in the world around you and that means there's going to be other parts of the body that won't even understand you because they're not running after the same atmosphere that you're running after they have not recognized yet that our one motive [Music] and our one thought should be to stay in that atmosphere the atmosphere of christ any person that ever come into that atmosphere one time just put them in that place where heaven comes down and touches the earth get them in the smack where heaven comes down and kisses the earth let them get in the atmosphere of the other world and i want you to know they'll never be satisfied in the atmosphere of of the general population or of the earth and world and society and secular life around us you'll keep coming back and coming back and coming back you know i know that we take the scripture jesus at the well with the woman and we say that and we kind of base the effect on that once you've tasted this well you'll never thirst again well i want you to know there's no water on the planet like that there's not even a spiritual water like that somebody said what do you mean isn't that what jesus said yes he said that because he knew that once she tasted that water all of her desires would change and there would be nothing else for her but that water it becomes an exclusive fountain to you once you have tasted of that living water you'll never thirst again for average water the sunny will never do it and callaway blue will never do it and the waters of this life will never do it not even good family fellowship will do it nothing will take the place of that living water and that atmosphere of being in christ any person that's ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else he said and that's what i believe that we should have our churches under control [Music] by the church order sermon i'm just telling you what he said that's why i believe that we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost now that very life of god should be able to keep the church of god in order under the control of the holy ghost that's the atmosphere i'm looking for so what if you sing one song for 20 minutes so what if you sing five songs instead of three so what if you come back at the end of the service and sing the same song you're saying at the beginning sing it another 20 minutes as long as we're under the control of the holy ghost and living in the atmosphere of christ nothing else can matter and i want you to know the more you purpose the more you have intention and the more your motive is to remain in the atmosphere of christ the less of this world will be able to trouble you it's so quick that we can bounce back to joy when we know that that's our inheritance the joy of the lord the joy of the lord the joy of the lord i want to hear somebody say the joy of the lord i'm holding myself because i have got a lot to unload and and i know my time is getting away from me very very fast so i don't know how how many parts this these 17 pages will end up being but all i know is i couldn't stop them from coming in fact i have about five or six titles to this sermon this morning i couldn't choose one so they're all i just named it all it's got six five or six titles here and then as i was sitting on the platform i had i had three or four more come to my mind but before i get there let me read the last quote from from the message tuesday night and this is just a short sentence a couple of sentences or a sentence and a fragment from the message the 70th week of daniel 1961 and it says the bride is that mystic body it is in the bride that the mystery of christ and his church is revealed it's not in denominational christianity it's not in the churches who are the daughters of the great come on now looking more and more like their mother every day i just mentioned this to you the other day some someone was here who had graduated and i was in a class in nazarene college and they were being told that you must understand and stand on the apostles creed and the person said the apostles creed is for the roman catholic church sister jeffrey ought to remember about the apostles creed because she and i were in court one time we were testifying of what we knew and they were bringing some accusation against her and by default against me and the accusation was you don't even know the apostles creed and our answer was not only do we not know how to recite it we don't follow it and i wish you could have heard the judge because the judge said to the attorney i don't know where you're going with that he said because i think he said it like this because you're a methodist but i'm baptist this is the judge and he said you methodists follow the the apostles creed because of the catholic church but we don't so move on move on he was going to try to make it some strange thing that there's an orthodox christian that doesn't believe in the apostles creed and so this this sister in the class she spoke up she said well that's part of the roman catholic church and and said i thought i thought this was a protestant college and they said we're not protesting anything no they're not protesting anything because they have swallowed her fallacy they've swallowed her error they've been seduced by her come on her drunkenness has compelled to them and they're also drunk with the same wine that she is drunk with but there is a bride and that bride is the true ecclesia the true called out and she is the mystic body the mysterious body of christ by the holy spirit sorry to the upc not baptizing jesus name into the body i love baptism in the name of jesus it's the only christian baptism i know anything about but i don't believe that's our entrance it's by the holy spirit that we are baptized into the mystical body of christ hallelujah how did you know you're part of the bride the holy spirit told you so the holy ghost revealed to you who you were hallelujah and you know some of us didn't have to come out because when the holy ghost revealed to us who we were we couldn't keep it to ourselves and so instead of having to come out we got the right buddha fellowship we don't want those troublemakers around here i'd rather know that i've been baptized by the holy spirit into the mystic body of christ living in the atmosphere of christ than to fit in fit in in this whole world if you're not a square peg they're trying to pound into a round hole something is wrong with you i don't want to get adjusted to this world amen could i do something out of the out of the ordinary would you stand again hebrews chapter 12 i'm doing this for your sake to let you stretch a little bit i want to say to that brother in the uk that we were not able to do your song request this morning i absolutely let it slip my mind but we will get it and you'll catch it in the archive and god bless you brother for writing from the uk last night and asking us to do the song adonai but we just didn't get that in this morning but we will and it blessed me because it reminds you that someone is out there on the other end we appreciate them hebrews chapter 12 beginning in verse 1 lord help me read it and not preach it as we go wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight let's say every weight and the sin let's say that too which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience with patience the race that is set before us without preaching may i just add your race and my race may not look the same but the goal line the finish line of my race and your race is exactly the same don't you become a race comparer don't you examine somebody else's racetrack get your eyes on your own racetrack looking unto jesus verse 2 looking unto jesus looking unto jesus i was so blessed by arrive alive brother greeley i haven't made it through the second one yet but i know i'll be greatly blessed and someone said something i think in one of the services about that great message looking away to jesus here it is looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith the origin and the completion of our faith who for the joy who for the joy joy say it with me joy for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god isn't that what it says in your bible for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin in all of our suffering and all of our resisting and all of our struggles and all of our trials we have not yet resisted unto blood so we have to keep our minds from getting too weary we have to keep our minds from fainting your mind faints the rest of you is going to follow you're going to be spiritually in coma if you let your mind faint don't do it keep it awake keep it alive and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth i want to be a received son for if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may take your seat now i want you to be able to concentrate on the rest of these verses but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons we know it means illegitimate children children born outside the covenant the wedlock the commitment of marriage if you are without chastisement where everybody around you has to partake then you are illegitimate your bastards in the sight of god and not really sons pretty serious got my attention hope it can always have yours next verse furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live it's important to understand our relationship with our abba with our papa next verse for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness i just had a flashback perhaps you can have flashbacks when you think of being corrected my mother corrected me like a father enough for a father but i remember two times in my life of five years with my dad that's all i had i remember two times of being disciplined one it was averted but he had every intention of giving me what he thought i deserved and i just flashed back as i read that verse of scripture because it's true our dads only have so much time i'm thankful that i don't yet have a child that i can't discipline i have four they all live in my home they're all subject to the belt even to this day if they so need it it will be provided because my time with them is limited and getting more limited as as june is drawing nigh if i have another way of getting to it i'm going to try that but if it doesn't work i have a responsibility boy got quiet i have responsibility yes we do we only have a short time i'm so thankful so very thankful that when a father's ability to chasten his children expires i'm glad that our heavenly father has no expiration we never get too big [Music] we never get too big too smart too haughty we never think too much of ourselves that he doesn't know how to bring us down not because he wants to see a squirm but he wants to see us glorified he's got a motivation of joy [Music] he's still being motivated by joy and i want you to know joy is costly there's a price to be paid one of the titles of these next few messages would be the high cost of joy it's expensive to find joy it's worth it it was worth it for him it's worth it for me you see the truth is i am his joy and i was expensive and the truth is he is my joy and he's expensive somebody said what price did you pay the biggest price that a human can possibly pay and that is to say yes and if you did it automatically you may not be born again but if you did it with some contemplation you better know when you say yes to him you're in this for the long haul because he don't let you off the hook there's no discharge from the army of the lord you can't resign and and try on something else when you get ready once god has given you a revelation of who you are in christ you can't change your place by changing your church you can't change who you are by changing your doctrine no no no no no there's something bigger than that we are his joy he becomes our joy he becomes our joy because we were first his joy it was us it was you that caused him to be able to endure the suffering of the cross despising the shame yet going all the way because he saw you he had you in his heart he had you in his mind is anybody with me all right let's go on for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of what his holiness that's the holiness that we're running after in this hour anything we do and call it holiness is our desire to remain covered by his but our holiness is never enough amen we just want to try to reflect his holiness by the choices that we make amen by the things we associate and identify ourselves with and the scripture goes on for note now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby and then he goes on wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees have a little mercy for the legitimate sons have a little mercy have a little compassion for those that you see god dealing with lift up hands the greatest thing you can do for anybody is pray and pray without prejudice pray without judgment pray without manipulation in witchcraft you know how do i do that brother you just pray like jesus said pray on earth on earth as it is in heaven wherefore lift up hands which hang down and the feeble knees strengthen them thank god for that and make straight paths for your feet get off that crooked journey of up and down and all around lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed oh yes he's got all the healing you need in your feet he knows how to correct your walk and your gait he's got it follow peace with all men that means send it ahead and holiness without which no man shall see the lord no man shall see the lord let's read on looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled many in this hour many in this hour are defiled by roots of bitterness that originated in human jealousy and the bride of jesus christ is not immune because we are human and because we are human the enemy seeks to come in the night and sow a seed of discord in our own lives we have to recognize it and get it out like brother branham said with the grub hole grub it out refuse to live by it because people around us choose to remain in their bitterness and it's a costly place to live thereby many be defiled just a little bit more lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat wow i gotta have a little water while we pause and remember these things for one morsel of meat sold his birthright i've walked with those on this journey who sold their birthright who would rather be right than be called and obedient to the call and anointed there's nothing in this world more valuable than his anointing on an obedient life that anointing can take you farther than you could ever go on your own the anointing of god on an obedient life can open doors that no man can open and shut doors that no man could shut that favor and anointing on the lord of the lord on the life of a believer is more valuable than any pot of porridge or any position yes it is esau for one morsel of meat sold his birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears when someone is released from their spiritual covering their repentance is only necessary to god they have no other covering but god if they make peace with god their peace at peace now that doesn't mean that if time and circumstance will allow you don't ever want to go back and say i'm sorry when you need to say i'm sorry but please understand that when someone is removed from their spiritual covering all they have to do is seek god with repentance and when they do that what sins what rebellion what transgression are you talking about it's forgiven and forgotten forever never to be uh brought up never to be used as a weapon against that person again it's mercy it's mercy that releases someone into the hands of their creator that's mercy that's god's loving grace we release them into god's hands because nobody knows how to take care of his children like he does in the message turn on the light in paragraph 164 don't put that up just yet before you do i want to read hebrews 12 1 and 2 in the amplified to set the scene for the rest of what we will share today and perhaps the next few services i read 17 verses because i could not find a place to stop i didn't like where i stopped i liked it it blessed me it talked to me it flowed into me as i read it and i didn't know where to stop but i finally stopped at 17 verses but i want to emphasize 12 1 and 2. i'm reading from the amplified and you see that little c there it means the classic edition of the amplified therefore then since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses we've just read hebrews 11. hebrews 11 we didn't read it but by the time we get to hebrews 12 in our reading we would have finished hebrews 11 the hall of faith and we read about what each one of these generals that god chose to speak through paul to the hebrew church about we heard about their sacrifice and their faithfulness we found out that this old world is not even worthy of men and women like that who pay the price who fight the fight who finish the course who keep the faith they have hung in the hall of critics rightfully so because they were not perfect men go back and look at the list they were not perfect men but they were god's men so they hung in the hall of critics and now by the grace of god they hang in god's hall of faith and their faith is mentioned above all of their sins in fact abraham is given a new title he staggered not i don't understand it but god said it so i say amen he hung in the hall of critics he suffered along the way he made mistakes like everybody else but god said he's so pure in my sight he never staggered at my promise he held on believing i would always do what i said i was going to do he was just going to help me out a little bless his heart that's how i read it stagger not so now we know who the witnesses are and now in 2022 there are hundreds and thousands more who paid the price who kept the faith you didn't have to think of something good to say about them at their funeral their life was lived for christ and the fruit of their life was evident in their going away and all you had to do was get up and say who they really were and everyone could say amen in their hearts and go warm leave warm because they knew not perfect men but surrendered disciplined chastised legitimate children some of the suffering you knew about was because they really belonged to god they weren't adopted they were his first in fact twice mine he said he took them again created them and knew them before they were ever born and then found them in the window and purchased them with his own blood and bought them back again that's how much he loved them now so here we are in 12 1. therefore then since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance are you awake unnecessary weight you don't want to get to the top of the hill overlooking the valley of ela and find out that you climbed all the way to the top with your rock with your pocket filled with rocks from this dry stream bed that david picked up his i got so excited about being at the valley of ela and looking down that dry creek bed where david had picked up his smooth rocks that i filled my pockets i had on cargo pants i filled all my pockets with the rocks and then somebody said let's go up here on the hill and look over the valley my was that harder i could have made it a lot easier if i would have emptied my pockets before i tried to climb how many of you got the message there it is let us throw aside every encumbrance unnecessary weight pile them at the bottom if you've got to have them they'll be there when you get back you don't want to climb the hill with rocks in your pocket and that sin which so readily deathly and cleverly clings to and entangles us and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us your race is not going to necessarily look like mine somebody may look at your life and wonder how lucky you were to be born with a silver spoon and they have no idea what you swallowed to get to where you are today because your race may not look like anybody else's race i want you to know you cannot have you seen that have you seen that uh picture of the pencil and the crayon there's a picture going around on social media and the pencil is comparing itself to the crayon and the crayon is comparing itself to the pencil and they both can leave a mark one's more colorful than the rest the other and because they're different instruments all together both able to leave a mark but because they're both instruments all together there is no comparison there are jobs that a pencil can do better than a crayon and there are jobs that a crayon can do better than a pencil they both leave a mark comparison is a dangerous habit to get in in this hour don't compare your race to somebody else's race just run your race run it with patience don't even question it somebody said i just get offended that you preach a gospel that says don't even question god along the way that's the one i preach that's what i'm preaching if you trust him you trust him by asking why you bring yourself into a place that you open up your mind to answers that you are not mature enough to hear so don't bother just say lord i trust you to the end we'll talk it over in the by and by we'll talk it over my lord and i i'll ask the reason he'll tell me why when we talk it over in the by and by you've got eternity church you've got eternity to discover the wise if you get to the end of your race and find out that you are still troubled by the questions that were formed by comparing your race to somebody else's race if you get there and it's still hanging in your mind you can talk to him you may not even have to ask the question because there's so much of god's glory and revelation in that dimension before you formulate the question the answer may already be in your heart and wouldn't that be wonderful how many of you believe it can be just like that you'll know all you need to know when you step into that place so stay out of that realm of why why why why especially the why me that didn't help chris christopherson and that's not going to help you why me lord now this this is the the truth about all that we wonder sometime why he chose us and the answer is never big enough to satisfy the longing the answer is because he could there you go why did he love me because he could big just be so glad he did that you serve him all the days of your life you get your pockets emptied out of all the rocks and run the race that is set before us anybody here here we go this is verse two and i have to hurry along looking away looking away looking away there's a twofold message here you are looking away from all that will distract you are looking away to jesus you're doing it at the same time you're consciously deciding not to look at the distractions of your life you are consciously deciding to look at jesus and allow him to satisfy every longing in your life every longing in your heart he satisfies that can anybody say man you can't say a man unless you're looking at him but when you start looking at him and seeing his beauty oh he's beautiful he is so beautiful i wished you men could say he is so beautiful somebody said i i just can't call another man beautiful he is so beautiful everything about him is lovely he's beautiful in all of his ways and all of his choices all of his decisions in all of his will purpose and ways for your life he's beautiful beautiful beautiful he's the only one qualified to choose a path for me because he's the only one that knows me nobody knows you like he knows you [Applause] he knows you're uprising and you're downsetting he knows what makes you tick more than anybody else anybody with me looking away from all that will distract to jesus who is the leader and the source of our faith giving the first incentive for our belief and is also its finisher bringing it to what maturity and perfection that's your faith now here's what i want to to put in your spirit for a moment he he for the joy of obtaining the prize that was set before him the trophy the prize that was set before him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of god for the joy for the joy for the joy for agonizing joy costly joy your joy has never cost him what his joy cost him in order for him to have joy and to keep joy and to endure the cross with joy it cost him everything he had no man suffered like he suffered no man hurt like he hurt nobody knew pain like he knew pain his pain was on so many different levels he not only experienced the physical pain of the crucifixion and the beating that preceded the crucifixion and carrying the weight of the cross all the way up to calvary with a little assistance along the way but he also endured the pain of kinos or what we say kinoses the separation of his father the god that lived inside of him left him because he made the decision to empty himself the bible said and we'll look at it he made himself of no reputation he emptied himself of everything that could have changed the course of the father's plan and there was nothing left in him but the yes if he would have died as god it would have not been nearly as miraculous and impacting but he chose to submit to the father's plan which was not to die as god father father why hast thou forsaken me he chose to die as man kinos kinosis the emptying of himself of all that was deity so that he could die then how am i saved if he died as an ordinary man how am i safe his blood the body that contained this blood the blood was god's life and though he hung there giving up everything that he had his blood was still the blood of god and it cried out in your behalf for your redemption he hung there an empty shell of a man emptied of all of authority and power the old songwriter said he could have called ten thousand angels why stop with ten thousand he could have called billions and billions of angels to come to his rescue but he chose to endure the cross and to endure it alone without the aid of the deity that he once contained powerful powerful there was only one thing that could keep him driving pushing in the right direction we already know that he struggled the scripture tells us that in gethsemane he struggled do we need to read it luke 22 i'm so out of order in my notes you're still with me luke 22 41-44 and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast that was it and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done i know that purest trinitarian doctrine would have an image painted in your mind that the father is looking over the balcony of heaven and the son is down there in in gethsemane crying out to a god that a father that he can't quite see nothing could be farther from the truth he was actually praying to the eternal spirit of his creator of his father who was in him and you may not understand it but jesus did and that's why he said to those around him when you've seen me you have seen the father have i been with you so long and you don't even recognize and know who i am because they were looking for an image of the father that they created in their own mind and they didn't see that jesus was the word made flesh he was the father in demonstration he was the mystery of god walking around in human flesh in skin in a body that could hurt in a body that could be emotional in a body that could suffer they did not understand it he is not praying to the to the first person of the trinity he's not praying to a father looking down on him in love but he is rather praying to the eternal spirit of the father that lives inside of him how did he get there because an angel of the lord came and brought a message and in that moment the holy ghost of god overshadowed mary and she he was conceived in her womb not having two fathers father and holy ghost but having won the same in the spirit and so now he's praying because this is the will of the one who has led him driven him actually every day of his life the spirit of the father that was in him had been driving him every day of his life he said i can do nothing i can do nothing on my own it's only what he i see him doing what i see him doing that's what i do brother branham said even our lord was led by vision are you with me what he saw the father doing that's what he did he couldn't do anything beyond that he was bound to do what his father was doing to say what his father was saying like father like son amen and here he is crying out father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will oh my are you so tired or can you stay a little longer with me nevertheless i have a will jesus had a will he had a will according to the flesh in fact didn't he say my spirit is willing that part of me that's not me that part of me that was a gift the eternal spirit that lives inside of me now transformed any any any remnant of human spirit that i might have carried it's willing but this flesh this body you gave me it's weak i'm asking if there's any other way if there's a plan b that you haven't let me know anything about could you please pull that out could we go with plan b if there's any way that this could be accomplished without this suffering i would rather much rather have it that way nevertheless the very word gethsemane is that olive press it means the pressing of the olive it's it's a crushing like patmos means my killing john had to die before he could see he had to die before he could walk through the revelation for one door he had to die jesus had to die he didn't just die at calvary he died at gethsemane in fact they say if jesus was ever going to fail you it wouldn't have been on the cross it would have been in gethsemane when he had the father's ear oh if there's any other way nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless listen folk if you can learn the nevertheless if you can learn the nevertheless when you're in a corner if you can just learn to say and mean nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless oh i want him to live nevertheless he is not mine he is yours i want that cancer gone nevertheless he doesn't belong to me she belongs to you nevertheless not my will but thine be done what a prayer what a prayer and there appeared an angel unto him ah the next verse and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him ministering to him don't ever misunderstand the ministry of angels they are not just holy protectors they are not just holy warriors they also bring bomb they bring ointment they bring strength they bring healing from the presence of his face they've been in his presence they have stood before his face and they come to strengthen him and they come to strengthen us when we are at our nevertheless moment anybody with me strengthening him the next verse and being in an agony the first title of this message is the agony of joy and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground this was the hardest moment of his life it was not the weight of the cross it was not the lashing of the cat of nine tails it wasn't the planning of a thorny crown it was not a sword in his side it was not the hook between his legs it was not his naked condition it wasn't the gall the bitter the vinegar that was given to him when he was thirsty that which he refused because the hyssop would have numbed the pain it was none of that none of that was his greatest moment of pressure his greatest moment of testing and trial was here being in agony prayed more earnestly his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground every system of his body so strained and stressed until the blood was leaching out of the vessels and capillaries of his body he was in a tremendous strain his heart was near to bursting medical science tells us the strength the weight of the world didn't meet him at the cross the weight of the world met him with the weight of doing his father's will in the garden of gethsemane the sin that you saw him hanging on the cross with carrying your sin it didn't meet him on the cross the weight of your sin met him in the garden and the strain of it on his physical form the body of flesh was so severe that he was almost to the place of having an explosion of his heart and the sack was straining the pericardium that the heart was in was straining beneath the pressure of that heart pump pumping pumping pumping pumping pumping such stream until at calvary it happened but it was close to happening in gethsemane finally at calvary his heart exploded the pericardium burst and the fluid not blood but the fluid of the pericardium that that watery substance that protects the heart went rushing through his body so that when the sphere went in his side the scripture records that blood and water pericardial fluid heart fluid and blood come running out the side no man suffered like he suffered if if it's true and the scriptures are clear and and we can look at it i have a few more minutes look at philippians 2 with me just a moment philippians 2 verse 5 and 6 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it was not robbery to be equal with god that word form in the greek is morphe you hear brother branham talking about and morphe that word form is morphe and and it means uh the the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision a physical image an external appearance he was in the form of god he had the external appearance the morphe of god in verse 7 but made himself of no what's that word in greek it's kino he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant form more faith and was made in the likeness of men that scripture he made himself of no reputation is the same word that is used later in the scripture for the kinoses meaning that he emptied himself it actually says in verse 8 or 9. i don't have it in front of me here he humbled himself can you give me verse 8 even though we don't have it thank you i can't find what i did with it and and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself he it means he brought himself low he depressed himself he brought down who he was to behave in an unassuming manner to bring to a humble condition to bring to emptiness until there is no vanity there is only nothingness this is a powerful demonstration of that word this is what he did and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that was the battle of the will that took place are you are you able to go just a few more moments in the message the mighty god unveiled before us paragraph 35 and dr schofield here we find that his word changing from form we find the word and morphe in greek which means the unseen was made visible the formless was given a form something that cannot we we know it's there it cannot be seen but yet we know that it's there and when he changed his form of the amorphy which means he changed from supernatural to natural and he just changed his mask in other words it's like a drama he was acting in the greek when they would change their mass remember one actor playing many different roles with not big costume changes just mask changes the same man could be both the villain and the hero by only changing the mass one player might have acted in several different parts brother branham said and then in the same message paragraph 38 now if you will take the old testament prophecies concerning what the messiah was to be you can compare it with the life of jesus and you've got exactly who jesus was he was not just an ordinary man are you with me he was god in more faith he was changed form from the supernatural into the natural form of a man yet he was god manifested in the flesh veiled by a human fleshly veil in the same message paragraph 205 he says god listen to this one god in his in morphe again unveiled himself and make himself known to his people the great king who laid aside his glory yet a little while and the world won't see me no more i'll be veiled to them because i will now be let me tell you folks jesus is here jesus is here don't just get your eyes on his coming and miss the fact that he has come he is here i don't you just let the critics roar he is here jesus is here where is he he is in bright form he's in bride form that's what he said it's a direct quote you can amen he's here in bride form this way the world misses him but the royal seat of abraham they recognize him when they meet him along the way hallelujah and you and i if we can get our pockets emptied out of all the rocks and all the hindrances and all the weights and sins the unbelief that so easily distracts and besets us on the journey then we can have even more of him formed in us amen working the same works among us and through us that he worked at calvary if you believe that you can say amen if if it's true and i i have much more to go over with you about this but if it's true i don't want to miss what the theme was to be today to start get us started if it's true that he was emptied if it's true that his father was not there to strengthen him on the cross if it's true that he truly was forsaken even the songwriter says his father turned his back the son to die alone it's not just figurative poetic he was emptied of all deity and died as a man shedding god's blood but he died as a man what kept him how could he do it there were two men hanging on either side going to meet the same same fate in a moment their life ebbing away and one of them died calling on mercy and one of them died cursing could have died just like the thief in anger in frustration somebody said well how could that be possible well i tell you how because he could get angry he turned over the tables and and and pushed out those who were merchandising in his father's house he had the ability to plant the whip for the righteous indignation of god he could have died angry bitter what i go all the way can you leave me here to die alone somebody said i can't even get my mind around this then you don't understand the new testament scripture and who he really was because we are told that in all manner he was tempted even as we are yet without sin if you think he didn't have rejection issues then you can't have them because if you can have them he had them if they can tempt and torment him they can tempt and torment you and vice versa he was he could have done all he could have had all kinds of reactions because right now he was only knowing agony there wasn't much glory the earth was dark the sun hit its face it refused to shine the earth is beginning to rumble beneath the surface as those plates beneath the cross begin to move back and forth all of creation is turned upside down because they see the in morphe of their creator the form of their creator dying you talk about sister flo singing no little yellow flowers in bloom no beauty there was no beauty in him isaiah said that you would desire him he was nothing to look at just one tangled mess of bloody tissue scars and bruises and tears in isaiah 53 somewhere in the notes verses 10 and 11 i needed a week yet it pleased the lord to bruise him and he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see [Music] his seat and the pleasure of the lord let's see it goes on he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hands or in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities this is not the description of an earthly king like some commentators would have you to believe this is a prophetic description of our lord tangled mangled twisted bloody you could have stood at the foot of the cross and watched his heart beating ripped open his body inside spilling out of his body blood running down in his eyes a tangled mangled mess of humanity so close to death something held him there something kept him in place it was for the joy can you think of anything joyful about the scene that i just described there is nothing joyful about his condition but he remembered i have a body this is not my body this is one form i have a body that will rise in her day i have a people that will overcome in their satan's eden i'll have a people that will overcome lukewarm christianity in their day and find their purpose filled with joy to see you and i tove to see us bearing the seed that we were created to bear and giving harvest giving expression to the seed that is within us hallelujah are you here joy uncontainable indescribable unspeakable joy filled his heart you were in his mind this day this hour this season he saw it he knew it just when it looked like the light would be completely stamped out the moon only a sliver in this hour and yet a people alaba hoshika mahaya whoa you didn't hear that a people with all all they need all they need is for god to show up in a sliver of the moon just come on jesus just come on and remind us just come on and let us see your word just come on and let us see ourself we've not strived yet to death we haven't strived yet to blood he did it for us all of our suffering all of our whippings all of our chastisement none of it can measure to what he endured he endured the cross how how with joy the agony of joy the pain was forgotten in a glimpse of you you in all of your warts and your crooked nose and your lesson beautiful disposition and all of our selfishness come on in all of the ways we disrespect him and his word and his house come on in all of our failures those of you who couldn't even look at me earlier in this service when i was speaking the truth because you are so filled with your own wrong opinion that you reject the truth as it comes to you service after service after service even you even you even you he saw you and he gave him joy because he saw the end he saw the end he saw the end he saw what the word would accomplish he saw what his blood would accomplish he saw what your obedience would accomplish and he went all the way he went all the way the agony of joy returning to joy the high cost of joy so in closing musicians coming let's be honest with you i'm about to lose my britches so i got to stop or have a costume change in all of the suffering and all that he went through joy held him there joy kept him there joy made it worthwhile you with me joy made it worthwhile you don't know near as much as you think you know sometime and neither do i but god sees it all he sees it all he sees it all we still look through a glass darkly sometime but that's our choice if you're still looking through a dark glass that is your choice you do not have to look any longer through a glass darkly because we now have a clear picture his word has become unveiled before us we can see him no longer through a dark glass but in the splendor the glory of his beauty nothing hidden any longer if joy was enough if seeing you reach your destiny in in in this life the father's plan for you in the end if seeing that was enough to give him the strength that he needed to endure the cross it speaks to us of the hugeness of his price the price he paid the sacrifice he made it also speaks to us of the value of joy joy is valuable i woke up this morning singing an old henson song this joy is mine it is it is it is it is it is dare misunderstand joy it doesn't mean you always dance a jig he wasn't dancing a jig you don't always laugh in the throes of joy he wasn't laughing joy is not always a celebration i've taught you all these years there's a great difference between happiness and joy happiness it goes and comes it's fickle based on circumstances you can be having the time of your life and one phone call can end it all you go from the from the throws of happiness to the to the depths of despair to hopelessness in five seconds everything can change your happiness but joy doesn't work like that joy is a deep deep deep deep deep rock way down in the excuse me for saying the good way down somewhere way down in the inner man he places on the inside of the inside let us say the joy the joy the joy the joy no wonder then he said unto them 8 10 nehemiah go your way eat the fat drink the sweet send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto the lord neither be ye sorry no morning no weeping no depression for the joy for the joy for the joy of the lord is your strength what was his joy seeing you fulfilling your god-called destiny was his joy seeing you birthed in his image shining like the sun but only the moon reflecting the light of the of the son seeing you believing the word for your day and obeying that's right not just seeing it but obeying it walking in it seeing you as a salmon swimming against the tide of popular opinion and holding on to the unmovable unshakable kingdom that's built on the everlasting true word of god seeing you in that place that was his joy knowing you'd be there knowing he didn't he didn't he maybe he wasn't rehearsing all the in-betweens but he just saw you at the end winning the mark winning the prize pressing the mark getting all the way through and for the joy for the joy for the joy that was before him he endured the cross and now the scripture talks about joy again and again and again and again and again and nehemiah says for the joy of the lord well where does he find his joy he finds his joy by looking at his people walking in surrendered obedience and love for him that's what gives him joy amen so you know what there's something to be said about you and i keeping our eyes he saw the finish line let's just boil it all down he had joy that kept him on the cross because he saw the finish line he saw the finish line anybody with me he saw the finish line there's something to be said about you and i choosing to keep our eyes on the finish line you see there's a trophy waiting on you at the finish line it's not of brass it's not of silver it's not of god it's him it's him hallelujah somebody praise him it's jesus waiting for you [Music] he's ready to welcome you to throw his arms around you and say you made it i'm whole now i'm complete now i'm who i was created to be now because all my seed have returned to me here they are welcome welcome welcome welcome enter into the joys of the lord anybody with me why don't we stand i'm not through with joy we got to return to joy we got to see the value of joy remember it's not always dancing i love the i got quotes i got quotes i got 17 pages to share i can tell you about joy about a people moved by the presence of god the joy of the lord filling the congregation let me give you one why it had to be shepherd christmas message why it had to be shepherd paragraph 183 is just before colossians scripture i've seen jumping spells and joy spells i'm going to wait on you because i jumped way over to about page 13. hallelujah play something i've seen jumping spells and something you're going to sing in a moment and joy spells maybe it could be so far over you might not have even got to it hallelujah but there was nobody hurt i'mma read on i've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt and i've seen meetings this is your messenger seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord filled the congregation can i give you a verse am i going all around yeah i spent most of the day with him yesterday and i thought i had it all figured out and that he came to me in the night and changed it all and it's been that way this morning i was laying in the bed and i normally get on up and get to the dining room table where i finish spend an hour every sunday morning finishing what i've worked on and i get over here and i have an hour to finish making sure it's printed making sure there's a copy of the scriptures and quotes for the ladies and sometimes making sure ezekiel has breakfast and but not this morning won't have plenty of time i don't want to rush don't want to be rushed because i don't know what he's going to say i can prepare and i can pull it together but i don't know what he's going to say but i was sitting here and you know i know i know that his hebrew name is not jesus i know that his hebrew name was something close to yeshua but i also know that he's not offended when the world calls him jesus oh no he reminded me one time of being in heavenly places and seeing the the name yeshua on a banner that angels were waving and right beside it was a banner with the name jesus on it and angels had made it i assume i don't know who made this banner but somebody heavenly made made one and it said yeshua and made one that said jesus and that settled some things for me it also blessed me to know that brother branham talks about how that there are three high holy words that the demons of hell cannot resist anybody familiar with it and he gives us great indication of what they are he said no demon no devil can stand before the name of jesus and he knows that he you call him yeshua he'll he'll say yes you call him jesus he'll say yes if you call him lord he'll say if you say hey you i need you it might not be hallowing his name it might not be the most respectful approach but he'll come you call on him he'll come he comes because of the pull of faith not because of the word but i i saw you this morning worshiping that that song i speak the name of jesus i can't even tell you how it has ministered to me since i heard it the first time i think of a little friend a doctor medical doctor now in mississippi who is uh really into all kinds of alternative treatments etc but a board-certified medical doctor also a jesus name apostolic and he didn't even he believed there was a whole lot of hype going on and that a lot of things weren't just like we were being told but he got hit very very hard by covid very hard and he had all the different equipment and all the all the things that he uses for for people for patients who come and all kinds of treatments and vibration therapies and shocks and i don't know what all he does i don't even know someone paid for us to go and we never go and refunded the money we didn't ever go ever felt like it was right time to go but anyway he's pretty sick he was a few months ago and he was reaching out for for prayer and just saying i'm going to get through this by the grace of god i'm going to make it through he lost his mother during the process and he said i just want to share with you and i'd already heard the song he said i just want to share with you what got me through i sat for hours in the chair and played this song over my life well crystal i mean charity gail singing it boy i have a hard time charity i want to call her charity grace or crystal gail i'm dating myself a little bit right with crystal gale most of you some of you couldn't have no clue who that is but her name is charity charity gail is that right and he said i let that song play over me sitting in my chair i speak the name of jesus over every sickness i speak the name of jesus over every fear i speak the name of jesus over every anxiety and i've been watching how you come i've been watching how you respond i've even sensed that that you're criticized even in this house some of you for making that approach don't you ever let the thought of that cross your mind when you are determined to gather and worship him you don't have to come you are not pressured to come but you are always invited to come and don't you think about anything but him when you're making up your mind to come and i'll tell you this don't study it long or you'll stay at your seat don't think on it long when you feel like like they come this when you feel that just get out there take three or four steps before you think about it then decide if you have to turn around and go back or not but you show the devil this ain't for you you dirty liar this ain't about you this isn't even about me i'm just compelled to go worship before the throne of god well i saw you i saw you volunteering to come and how willing you were to come and he spoke to me psalm 110. i i s he spoke it so clearly in my mind that i looked it up and it sure enough was this scripture psalm 110 3 this is amplified your people will offer themself your people will offer themselves willingly in the day of your power in the beauty of holiness and in holy array out of the womb of the morning to you will spring forth your young men who are as the do this was the part that stood your people will offer themselves willingly in the day of your power uh one of the versions new american standard or one of the virgins says your people will volunteer readily in the day of your power and i saw god fulfilling that in some way in this house as people just came moved by the spirit of god to worship him no paycheck at the end of it no other motivation except to let him know you deserve my praise you deserve my attention listen folk don't be this one you be the one that puts everything you've got into lifting up his name worshipping him don't bite your fingernail with one hand and raise the other one focus on what you're focusing on on the king of kings in the lord of lords and he'll remind you he'll remind you in that moment you were worth it you were worth it you were worth it you were worth every sacrifice you were worth all the suffering you were worth all the pain and you'll be like those who find themselves so willing so willing to offer themselves it's all you got you've given of your money you've given of your time and effort all you've got left is just to come and give him praise that's why you're here this morning don't let the enemy steal it let's worship him for just a moment [Music] god is able he will never fail my greater than all we see greater than all we ask and he has done great things lifted up he defeated the

symptoms but i'm okay by the grace of god and all morning getting ready i just pushed through by the grace of god and i just kept praising the lord and kept praying and i get here and we're praying

share this moment because i believe this moment is a marker in time for us there's something happening in our midst and i'm so glad i didn't miss it i'm so glad i didn't let the enemy talk me out of it and say you're not feeling well and you can't make it i press through i press through by the grace of god amen um i just want to say to olivia like your anointing has broken so much in my life just this morning but also while we were singing the song again in the end um in the spirit the lord showed me a dragon over my family and slaying the dragon with the sword and i just want to speak that that dragon i don't even know what that symbolizes i'll have to go look it up but it's broken off my family and that curse is broken off yes uh that uh you know me and me and blasphemy we've been going through a bunch of stuff it's the car you name it it's hit us in the back but look like i told you you know what i found god is going to get their glory out of that no matter what it is [Music] that we you know that we tend to hang on to yeah you know what i'm saying man i'm just telling you god's gonna get in the glory and keep walking and walking [Applause] you know i know it hurts sometimes but he's always there and the lord told me to come home and come to church today we got up at 5 30 we were tired of [Applause] [Music] turn your cheek if they slap you turn your cheek we don't want to do that in humanity but if somebody hits you turn your cheek love them pray for them who persecute you love them who hate you it don't matter it don't matter what matters is your walk with the lord in your communication with god because in the end when you stand before almighty god and then word what that person did for you and what they were or what they look like whatever what's going on and i just want to tell that body here god loves you you are the bride god is calling us to a higher place than most people and i ain't ashamed of that but i'm telling you i love you and i thank you my mother [Applause] now um i've been through a lot these past few years as you all know but god's been dealing with me and i won't share the details but yesterday jaya can attest to we had a rough time and it was a struggle and we weren't sure why and i didn't make it to the baby shower but the lord knows and when i went home i was so defeated i was so tired i was so fogg-brained and i was in tears and didn't know why and just a place of just feeling desolate and i was talking to john on the phone i got off the phone she says i'm praying for you and i was praying for her and i put in i decided you know it doesn't matter if the kids are screaming it doesn't matter if the house is amazing but in my earphones block out the noise and put some worship music on and i tell you what i have a revival in my home last night i tell her i've had a revival over here and i'm praying that it goes your way and i came in i was so expected this morning you know so many things could have set me back i missed my lord my husband wanted me home elijah wanted to stay home food wasn't fixed there's just so many things and i was like i have joy in my heart i'm going to church today [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i yeah jesus [Applause] singing about somebody testified i was up front and i realized i'm standing almost in the same place i was when the lord delivered me at the root of bitterness in my life in 2014. i was standing on that front row where i still was this morning and i was standing there and i was trying to enter into the song and into the worship service and i remember standing there and i was thinking trying to focus on the lord and instead i was focusing on the things that i had been going through and i was so bitter towards certain people not just that there was bitterness there was directed bitterness in my heart and i was standing there on that front row and i was trying to be in the spirit but my mind was so focused on the bitterness that i carried and brother shelley was singing that song sweet anointing and he said the song that line about just [Music] because i walked away from that lord no longer carrying a root of bitterness and anger in my life and i just want to testify because i didn't take the opportunity when he was singing testify so here's my testimony [Applause] for this house and for your leadership yes for those who press in here this morning when we were singing that song and you started calling out the names of the nations i can't tell you how much that meant to me because i have cried out that our body here would do that god is never going to bless us to the fullness that he has until we put our caters and needs behind us amen and we cry out for those around our world in this neighborhood when we stop focusing on us that's what he's going to show me here and i think he broke something this morning by doing that and when we in the end that we turn sometimes so many people that strain they say you don't know how much it means when you turn to us we feel like you're looking at us because our backs are always to them and this morning that's the lord's had me a couple of times recently with the flags and things to turn around and face the cameras so i want to encourage us as a body if you think about it if god puts it on your heart don't feel awkward turn and hold your head up to those cameras because you have no idea what's going on in the world in the nations that they need to know that we recognize they're there and so i just want to thank you this morning for starting that and i really believe something is shifted and broken [Applause] i like to testify as well tiffany's absolutely correct yesterday was a struggle and i went to bed before i went to bed last night i had a conversation with the lord that was so precious so sweet and it was just me and him talking about his word and just fellowship and then this morning when i woke up i felt this heaviness it was just the heaviness that i couldn't even move and so i got up and did what i could and then went back to bed and probably at 9 30 i was like i gotta go i gotta go i rolled out of bed and i don't know what hit me but i know it was the spirit that rolled up within me i started declaring every truth that he has spoken over me the depression and everything else that i've carried throughout my life can no longer hinder me and then i started having a praise fit i tell you i was all over the house screaming and dancing and praising the lord and i'm so grateful because when i came into this house we were worshiping i felt chains of bondage break off of me that were trying to reattach but in the name of jesus [Applause] um i couldn't read just the one verse he gave me i read the whole thing through several times and even in the amplified and it was just amazing and after reading that it gave me the peace uh to go to sleep i was just i don't know i'm just overflowing with a joy you
