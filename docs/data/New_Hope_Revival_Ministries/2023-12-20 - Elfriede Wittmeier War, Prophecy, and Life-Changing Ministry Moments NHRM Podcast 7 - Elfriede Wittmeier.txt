TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hi I'm Joshua Shelli and welcome back to another nhrm podcast today we'll be doing part two of sister Alfreda um if you have not watched the first part I would definitely suggest to go back and watch it and learn about some of uh her family history and how she came into this message um before watching this one definitely go back and watch the first one just to learn a little bit about her and everything but uh we're really excited for the second one and uh we're going to be talking about how she came to this ministry and also going back and telling a couple more of uh the War Stories and so we're really excited so thank you for coming back on for part two thank you for having me we had we had a good time it was good so I'm excited for it was very relaxed so we're good we're good even though you didn't make the coffee I'm sorry hwk made it this time um we wanted we wanted to point out one thing that we were talking about after we got done that we did not mention that your dad actually never came back from the war no he left the beginning of uh November 1944 and the reason he wasn't drafted earlier than that was because he was looking he and another man were looking after all the needs of the people because all the other men were gone the Army and so um you know he he belonged to the fire department and all everything else that would so I I me when you think about that it even shows like how tough your mom really wasz now she did everything by herself and even moved everyone to Canada I mean completely by herself yeah I tell you it took the Lord for sure really took the Lord for sure I believe it but um yeah my dad never returned he he was 38 years old when he left and uh um you know it was I I never realized how hard it really was growing up without a dad I mean that was just you know you took it into stride because I hardly knew him I had one one experience that I remember very clearly very vividly and that was uh he had made some a a swing in the woods and you know when I was just little you know just a little over two and I was one of my siblings had me on their on their knee and was swinging as high as and to this day I can still feel that thing you know coming down like so dad was coming out and I was screaming my head off and he he just consoled me and I remember that feeling you know that and scolded my sibling whoever that was so that was a but you know those things are very important when that's all you have for sure okay remember the little things but um the Lord did something for me this year at the beginning of the year and um what he's doing he's going through my life um I think it's part of that Hoopa experience that he is taking out all the hurts and the pain like he has to with with all of us because you know we've got to come forth in in his Integrity his character his Beauty his love and all but we can't have any of those scars he's going to take that all away so um this it was sometime in January and I didn't realize how how much I really missed my dad like growing up and um I had that that experience was so vivid that I I'm going to tell it because we don't know how many people are out there and don't know how to deal with these situations and so in in that experience I heard someone say come your your dad wants to see you and I found myself walking down a hallway and thinking I am going to meet a perfect stranger I don't know him you know I was two and a half so um and then I thought what language is he going to speak to me is cuz I know he would have spoken a lot of Russian or or German or you know would we even be able to communicate and I you know crazy things you think it yeah those times so finally I got to the door and I came to this big room and there was a a chair behi right near the entrance and I saw my siblings sitting there kind of in a semicircle and I thought well I know you all you know I want to see my dad and so I walked around and very much afraid of of you know what am I going to experience here and then he sat there and then he just smiled and he stretched out his hands and he and I just ran to him and hugged him and hugged him we both cried and all of a sudden it seemed like I came came back to being little you know he took me on his lap and I asked him all kinds of questions and uh he answered them and then I I asked why didn't you come back to us then then he just put his head down as if he couldn't answer and then I Heard a Voice saying 1950 and I take it that the Lord was telling me he died in 1950 yeah we know that he survived the war he we had um I don't have it here but we did receive a couple of cards and he was a prisoner of war the Russians captured him on the other side of Dresden and um he was in in we knew that he was near the Black Sea and later on to the taken to the uh Peninsula Cola and up after that we I mean we don't there was no direct communication except you know they they he said he was in Russian a a Russian uh prisoner War but it was scratched out so we don't know the camp or anything where he was at oh wow but so yeah that's what happened to my dad but he never oh I just wanted to C that you didn't get to on the last one yes um and there was another story that you wanted to tell I did because because it uh we all hear about Dresden M and it happened you know the Allies bombed the city of Dron it was it was a beautiful um beautiful city really it was one of it they they uh used that to uh keep records and you know a lot of the birth certificates and you know it was and uh so much of it was destroyed because of that then I don't know why they selected Dresden but what I remember so vividly it seems like my siblings don't remember it but but I do it was like I'm experiencing it right here I was we I was sitting in the center of that wagon and just nonchalant you know just I looked up to the sky and I saw the bombers coming from the you know there was I don't know there must have been about eight or there were a lot I've I've seen the pictures of Dron and it was exactly like that and then as I I gazed up and I and all of a sudden something dropped and then the next thing that happened was this horrible explosion and there was a a wall of fire to me it seemed you know as a child that had reached the heaven like as high as I could look and um uh and then I heard the noise like the people screaming and the horses raring up and Chaos all around me how far were y'all from that would y'all must been pretty close it well yeah it would probably Mama thought it was maybe about 10 kilm or so but you know but it's like I don't know I don't know but that's my memory of it and it was horrifying W so I think brother um prear I think they he lived he lived in um I think he lived in dryon cuz he yes so but 98% of it the City was destroyed completely they said the temperatures were uh almost at like 2,000 de it was it was hardly anybody would have survived wow yeah it was horrible but mhm now we we discussed a little bit yesterday yes about um your experience in brother brandom's um yes meetings and stuff and I know you wanted to share because because in the tapes and stuff all they have is uh a woman speaking in tongues and you actually have have I TP I typed it out yeah just one moment and so if you'd like to share that that would be really good yeah it was quite an experience you know that but I'll have to take my glasses off so I can see I think I've got it here birth pains this is what she prophesied first of all brother brandham was speaking about and I got the last paragraph written here because he was he was he said look at the increase across the world recently you ought to get in my office and read the letters from the mothers for their boys and homosexuality is in the in on the increase and I think I think it's somewhere between 20 and 30% and in Cal in California alone over the last year and a great bunch of even government people have proven to be you know you're go you government men know that your magazine I read it and I've taken and all of a sudden this woman she sat quite close to the front I I don't know I think maybe the second or third row not too far from us she stands up and she prophesies speaks in tongues and then she gets louder and louder uh you can hear it on the two it is coming it is coming it is coming the Wrath and she she rolled her eyes like that wrath you of the Living God it is coming it is coming it is coming the Wrath of the Living God for surely iniquity does abound iniquity does abound found yay the Living God has witnessed today that his people yay draw nearer to him and cry for the mercy of the Living God for the land is entrenched with iniquity and then she speaks in tongues and let God witness with the message the message and she gets louder she said it four times the message the message that God brought the almighty God the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob Witnesses he Witnesses with the message that has gone forth so I thought it was very important because you the atmosphere was I was say what was it like after that like what what were people what was brother brandom doing after that what brother Brown um he acknowledged it immediately and he said said that God has spoken he did not mind being interrupted because apparently this woman has never spoken in tongues or has never prophesied it just happened there that's what I heard wow mhm but the next very next day after he related that experience and I'm going to give you the date that would be the 25th of January and uh 65 so in case anybody wants to look it up I think brother Bram came back we weren't there anymore cuz we left that morning but he uh they acknowledged the whole thing that God had spoken and um it they allowed him to relate what had really happened you know what the Lord had explained to him about that scripture so I would rather you know I just want to give you the reference so in case anybody wants to read it yeah it's it was very important and immediately after he was finished with that then that same voice that same woman gets up and prophesies and again you know it's the message and it is coming it is coming and then so it's kind of hard to hear I'm going to really try to to get it but um if I do I'll just text it yeah and you know but this one here was the one that I had heard so she actually prophesied twice yes okay on on the 24th of January and the 25th 25th and the following month when it was at the same time when brother Bram spoke about on marriage and divorce in that those those meetings he uh preached a sermon entitled this day the scriptures fulfilled and um in on he mentions it there again and he relates the whole thing about the priest uh Bishop Stanley speaking to him and that actually in his conversation with with with him on the platform he said she gets up and prophesies wow and this was the importance you know to me that was very very important was was there anything else in those meetings that really stuck like stuck out to you or or or anything or any Miracles that happened or anything that well he had a prayer line but at that time yes it was but uh it seemed like there was much more the emphasis on on the word and what and the Judgment that was there there was such a transition taking place M you know in in 64 and 65 there was um I remember Oral Roberts was supposed to have been attending those services and he didn't come and Isaac sharen the father he had died several months before that and so he was um um what I had heard there at the time was that he made his son promise that he would always keep the door open for brother brandham and that was probably because towards the end you know it was brother brandham had almost you know almost every door was closed yeah and it had to happen wow But but so that was kind of the atmosphere what what was it like like well how did you feel driving home after attending those meetings um did you feel excited or yes but see I didn't don't forget I had just um really you know with that experience I shared with you I had to kind of digest that all because because you had never seen that no no now I do want to remember one other thing that in 1963 it was when I had gone to that Baptist College and um and I had my that uh the Holy Ghost baptism I received that and afterwards you know we had these friends and somehow someone played um a tape of brother brandham really yes and so the very first tape I heard was uh Souls that are imprison now and and in the Baptist College yes well at that time I yeah I heard yes but um it so shook me you know here I had that experience with the Lord yeah and it made me so aware of the Supernatural and he says so many serious serious things on there that I thought what is Happ I thought I have to get saved all over again yeah it was I remember for about 3 days I was just walking in a days it affected me that much yeah and uh you know and that would have been around the time when he was preaching the seals but you know we were not in contact with him but I do know a lady who was in Jeffersonville at the time when he preached uh SS out are in prison oh really yes and she said the people didn't even wait to get to the altar they just streamed it was like they were falling over each other because that time is was so serious and look at now we are so so much closer sure so I don't know how many uh you know people are I'm just saying these things here to point them to to what had really happened at that time oh now when you got home from those those meetings what was it did you go in and tell your mom what had happened or oh they knew something had happened to me you acted completely different yes yeah it changed me changed me a lot I never went back to that place that was it and we started listening to tapes I I mean just the few that we could get a hold of and um I listened to the seals and it was like a new world had opened up to me you know the reality of the day we're living in that it's like we're on the edge of something so huge now how much more than we were then for sure do you have a favorite tape or message by Brother Bren oh there's so many so many they're really what's some of your favorites I really really enjoyed what's the attraction on the mountain what the date on that cuz I know you know it it actually I don't really no I figured you would no I know I'm sorry I put you on the spot no I don't care no but uh it it it was one of the last later ones you know that but what yeah it was you could just picture him moving on that and and it was it was very special to me but this one on Souls that are in prison now I I think everybody ought to hear that that was and it was preached around the time of the seals just before that or what what date you you said that date didn't you it when was it preached it would have been around the time in 63 I 63 I heard it okay yeah so that was yes so that's what you so that's what y'all did for a while was just listen to we listened to that and then the people started started to gather and we listened to a lot of tapes many many and that's um you know trying to get it established my brother Billy Paul came to Canada so did Brother Collins there were several yeah of the ministers but um um you know we we especially after brother bham had died you know we lived that whole whole uh week you know when he between the 18th and the 24th you know we received reports every day sometimes two or three because the people really were expecting him to rise I mean like I said yesterday it was it was such a shock and yet he had warned the people anybody who would have listened like in on the Easter seal he had said um he said I see my end at 56 years old and different times he was prophesying his departure he he knew he was going but uh he was trying to prepare the people but you know oh no it just wasn't going to happen no he was going to have tent meetings and like we all we were preparing to you know during the vacation time or somehow during that year to go try to attend some of the services and that and then what a shocker it was um extremely in what year did you hear about the ministry here um actually in ' 92 going start talking about that a little bit yes um actually it was right after there were some of the folks from Edmonton had been in the two sound meetings and they came back with some of the tapes so we heard you know like mule religion and uh uh 12o Shuffle you know those Classics have you heard them I have I've heard troph Shuffle I haven't heard the other one oh yeah and one more night with the Frog I've heard that one CU he's repr preached it since then but I didn't hear several times I didn't hear the original one yes and uh no it was really it was really good I knew there was something there and so then um that's when I went to visit my niece Esther Judith's sister she lived when so when brother shell came to uh an arbor um I really enjoyed those services so that was the first time where you yes and that would have been in April 992 okay yeah and then I I remember talking to him and inviting him to come to Edmonton did you know that I didn't know it yes because you know people the message folks were very closed and so so we were talking about and he promised he would come so he did I still have the I still have those tapes they're very very yes I do and uh were so he came in May 92 90 yes ' 92 and he went to Scott as well and uh that's where Laurel Laurel's brother I think had invited her and so we were all working together and so but those those first meetings they were they were really good we had about 40 people in our basement wow was yes and so just in y'all's house yes in our basement I didn't know that it's I did not if I did I forgot it uhhuh it's for the first meeting were yes uh and some of you know the I guess I'm just going to say it you know some of the the folks they were pretty mean it's okay you need you know that anyway don't you um so when did you decide to move down here to come okay here okay we we had started um even throughout throughout the year I had heard the the message on no strength to to bring forth from Mesa okay have you ever seen that I don't think so I don't know if you have the teeth but that that was something else I I'm I saw some of the people on the platform the preachers I mean they couldn't believe what they were hearing they were it and brother shell was bold I'm telling you he was Fearless it it was exactly what was needed but it made it hard for him so did you know that I did not okay so anyway we were so thankful because something was happening and God just broke through and so many people were waiting for something to transpire but um so we passed on these tapes and everywhere and I started um I asked him if I could type and so I typed out two of those sermons one of them was um I think he told his testimonium one and two of them and um I gave him the transcript when he came later on and uh uh somehow it just didn't work out and you know that he was going to put it on paper or try to so anyway I asked him if he did and he said no no I've just not been able to to do that and I said you want me to do it and I said yeah and I I did I just put like put right the vision together from the transcript I mean I knew nothing about his ministry I the only thing I tried to do was just to cause it to flow and I wanted everything to be in his words yeah so some of the uh paragraphs I would take the different you know whenever I would hear something that really stuck out to me when as we were listening to the the stream no the hookup yeah and sometimes I would just take one or two sentences and put them together or so you were doing this long before you moved here yeah okay yeah just put it together it was and whatever I felt I felt really needed to be there I yeah so I typed that up and we were communicating back and forth and I mean it was you know it would be so different today because there's so much that God has done since but I had nothing to go by yeah really just my two sermons you know the testimony does that make sense it does it does okay so when did you actually end up moving here though in May of um 93 they were still Church yes but we were okay we were on the hookup and brother Shelly had come again in uh 92 in September and he brought a mall with him so um so and there was a group a group of us that that you know we were we were really enjoying this so anyway um we had come here drove down here for about 10 days in February and March there were four of us brother the Salvador and Patty and I I think I think Danny was with us so do you know any yeah yeah I know I know that was in the spring in Mar and then we drove back home and in March it was March the 20th uh 93 we were on the hookup and he had had the vision of the platform of of um the Tabernacle and boy that rang true to me you know I wished I could have seen you know he was drawing that and we were you know just on the hook up yeah and um I was I was kind of you know I was sitting there and I think oh Jesus I I want to understand this so badly he was he was covering everything all these questions that I had okay he was speaking about the the bride's Revival about the tent about the Thunders the seventh seal and see when brother Bram died I don't know if I mentioned this yesterday I my the first impact yeah you did that I had it it's so it was like that's what hit me that I had question upon question about this it just it just did me in it it became do you understand that it was and so when he started to uh um you know recollect everything he put the things together the quotes together and I I was sitting there and I thought Lord I want to understand that you see there were so many things we had gone through for instance when it came to the tent Vision um all of these all of these doctrines had come up and I was you know personally told um if you don't see the tent Vision like that and don't believe it the way they did uh you know you're just not going to be a part of that you know I my friends friends told me and you know you have to realize this was just right at the beginning you didn't know which way anything was going it was a lot of turmoil and so my response was is if God is big enough to let me know you know to want me to be and to understand the tent Vision he will let me know I don't have to follow man I will know and he will make sure that I would be there you see that it that I just didn't buy that but then I thought Lord what do you really mean what does that so here I am sitting on the hook up listening to this and having um the seals the seal the seventh seal everything's so uncertain right and all of a sudden this presence comes and I knew I just I just sobbed I just leaned forward and I knew that being was standing right in front of me and he had some kind of of a vessel I didn't dare look up a vessel in his hands I don't know if it was a chofar or whatever it was I don't know I didn't look up and I was sobbing there and all of a sudden he poured out oil that hot oil warm oil all over me that didn't leave for at least 24 hours you know and uh and then I had a vision and I saw a ladder and I knew where I was standing very much on the right on the ground I had and and the ladder was there and there was some kind of a ledge and to the right there was a a room that had the door was just open a little bit and I knew it was very light in there and I needed to go there and he let me know you've got to do a lot of climbing before you you can go there so so and then he also let me know he's going to give the real interpretation of the of the tent Vision here I mean that that's and that's the reason I really felt proud of the Lord to come here he you know there were just different things he said I'm going to show you things let you see it just be very observant and watch because it will be and you know it was very difficult even for in those times because we not were not um you know a registered denomination so it was very difficult for us to get the proper papers the religious you know so we got a lawyer Patty and I did and then um finally we got our religious visa to be able to come here yes but it was um we had been here on like on on yeah it was a visitor's visa yes yes yeah we did yeah mhm so I mean it was legal we were not here illegally you know but anyway so that's what happened and actually later um what happened it was because of the power of the spoken word that we actually God opened up the door and find a and uh it it happened you know it was it was difficult but it it came to pass you know so I'm U God really wanted us here and then um so it was on the uh 6th of okay we came here in May of 93 the 14th of May actually I'll never forget it because that's when Israel you know became a nation you know on that date M also once I was here for about 3 weeks I know notice I said Lord are you sure cuz he had told me to come but you know it was it was difficult leaving yes and so at the time I had gone to it was a Saturday afternoon and I had gone to Columbus and I was I was at the time you know nothing nothing was really organized yet or whatever but I was in brother Shell's office there just sitting and I was going to do some typing and I prayed I said Lord are you sure you want me to be here because at this point in time I could still go back and you know and I remember a little Mindy came into the office brother Shel will remember her she was you know he had seen some things about her she was she was really a sweet girl anyway so we T chatted for a little while but everything was new right so the following day following morning so only a few hours had TR transpired and we had the Sunday the June 6th meeting and all of a sudden you know I had just prayed that not talk to anybody okay and uh um during the worship all of a sudden brother shell gets up and he said you wouldn't believe what is happening here right now he said the pillar of fire is moving all over this place like a ball of fire and uh and right now uh I see it in front of simmeron heading for sister Alfreda and uh then it hit me I mean that power that came and and I mean he because he was sitting right behind me Simon was and then I just lost it and the whole Pew you know we all kind of fell like dominoes and he prophesied over me and repeated my prayer I mean that left me speechless as you can imagine he said um you are in the right place you are where God wants you to be and drive your Stakes down do you know I mean it God made business because he wanted me to keep record you know we we had to these things were very important that were're about to come forth for sure so so that's when when um we stayed yeah and and now I mean you've traveled all over the world with us now I'm sure half we've been in Jerusalem and the Netherlands I remember you following of course there always something always I cheesy about that where else did you you we went to Israel together the Netherlands Germany Norway Germany nor Norway yes we've been we've been around a little bit yes we have yes it was it was
