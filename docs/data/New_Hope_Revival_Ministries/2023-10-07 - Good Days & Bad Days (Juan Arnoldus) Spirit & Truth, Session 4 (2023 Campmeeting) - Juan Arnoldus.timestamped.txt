[1:03:10] Lord amen I greet each and everyone in
[1:03:13] the beautiful name of our Lord and
[1:03:15] Savior Jesus Christ amen in Matthew 17
[1:03:20] when uh Peter saw on the mountain trans
[1:03:23] Transfiguration yes when he saw the
[1:03:25] glory of the Lord yes he saw how Jesus
[1:03:28] changed and he saw Elijah and Moses the
[1:03:32] Bible said Peter said Lord it's good to
[1:03:35] be here amen and I don't know about you
[1:03:38] amen I feel I'm it's good to be here I
[1:03:41] like to shout and say lord it's good to
[1:03:43] be part of this camp meeting amen
[1:03:47] now praise the Lord now I don't know if
[1:03:51] that was the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:03:53] because he wanted to build three
[1:03:54] Tabernacles for Jesus Moses and Elijah
[1:03:57] amen so I don't know if it was the Feast
[1:03:59] of Tabernacles but if it was the Feast
[1:04:00] of Tabernacles amen he said it's good to
[1:04:03] be here and we are gathering here at the
[1:04:05] Feast of Tabernacles and I'm telling you
[1:04:08] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:04:09] amen praise the name of the Lord amen so
[1:04:13] excited I never thought that I'm going
[1:04:14] to preach tonight again amen I'm little
[1:04:17] bit tired but Pastor Sally said I'm not
[1:04:19] here on a holiday amen I'm here to work
[1:04:21] for Jesus praise the name of the Lord um
[1:04:24] we don't run for pulpits uh we came to
[1:04:27] be a blessing we never thought that
[1:04:29] we're going to preach or minister to the
[1:04:30] word of God but I'm so thankful for the
[1:04:32] opportunity and the privilege that we
[1:04:34] have and I realize when you speak to
[1:04:37] God's bride this is a elected lady God
[1:04:40] don't trust anybody to just speak to his
[1:04:43] bride that's right you have to qualify
[1:04:46] to speak to his bride cuz she's a
[1:04:49] special lady that's a truth amen if you
[1:04:51] don't know that's why the Bible said you
[1:04:53] you got to to rule your own house right
[1:04:56] before you can rule the house of God
[1:04:58] that's right and if you don't know how
[1:05:00] to treat your own wife at home right you
[1:05:03] don't
[1:05:03] qualify to speak to God's bride right
[1:05:07] the way a man will treat his wife that's
[1:05:09] the way he will treat his church amen is
[1:05:12] it right praise the name of the Lord so
[1:05:14] not everybody or anybody can just come
[1:05:16] and speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:18] the Old Testament opens with the serpent
[1:05:21] greeting the Bride of Adam death came
[1:05:25] right but the New Testament opened with
[1:05:27] the angel Gabriel coming to the Bride of
[1:05:30] Joseph and life came amen and that's
[1:05:34] what we want amen we don't want serpents
[1:05:36] to greet the
[1:05:37] bride we want the angels of the Lord to
[1:05:41] greet the bride is that right amen are
[1:05:43] you not glad that the seven Angel yes
[1:05:46] sir came in this day to greet the Bride
[1:05:48] of Jesus Christ
[1:05:50] Shalom oh my that's what we want brother
[1:05:52] and sister and you know what Gabriel
[1:05:54] told uh the bride Mary he said fear not
[1:05:58] you know why because there's certain
[1:06:00] Angels you need to fear right there's
[1:06:03] fallen angels that the bride needs to
[1:06:05] fear but when this Angels Came he said
[1:06:08] Mary there's no need to fear and we want
[1:06:11] God to send angels from his throne to
[1:06:13] speak to the bride so that the bride
[1:06:15] don't need to fear but that the Bride
[1:06:18] Can Have Faith amen is that right praise
[1:06:20] the name of the Lord so we so excited
[1:06:22] amen and and and what we need we need to
[1:06:25] hear from the angels of God and we want
[1:06:27] the angels of God to speak to his bride
[1:06:29] amen I don't know if you believe it but
[1:06:31] God still got some angels on the earth
[1:06:34] if you read Genesis 28 the Bible doesn't
[1:06:37] say the Angels descended and ascended
[1:06:40] the Bible said when Jacob saw the Angels
[1:06:42] they were ascending and descending
[1:06:44] that's right so they were not Heavenly
[1:06:46] Angels they were Earthly Angels because
[1:06:48] Heavenly angels will come from God down
[1:06:51] amen but Earthly Angels God have on the
[1:06:54] earth that goes up to the throne to get
[1:06:56] a message right and then comes down with
[1:06:59] thus sayeth the Lord and we need those
[1:07:03] angels amen and that's why David called
[1:07:06] it God God told Jacob Jacob called it
[1:07:09] the house of God Beth right amen because
[1:07:12] that's what we need in the house of God
[1:07:14] we need Angels brother said a local
[1:07:16] Pastor is the Angel to the church and
[1:07:19] God will reveal to the angel the
[1:07:21] situation and the conditions and the
[1:07:24] that angel will preach according to the
[1:07:26] need of the people that's how you know
[1:07:29] that that man is an angel from God if he
[1:07:33] can pick up the needs in the church and
[1:07:35] preach amen Faith to the
[1:07:37] people praise the name of the Lord you
[1:07:40] know we not every preacher produce Faith
[1:07:43] right on Romans chapter 10 says faith
[1:07:46] cometh by
[1:07:47] hearing and no man can hear without a
[1:07:50] preacher right and a preacher cannot
[1:07:53] preach unless is sent am so not any
[1:07:57] preacher can give you Faith right don't
[1:07:59] just run for any
[1:08:01] preacher the Bible says a sent preacher
[1:08:04] produce faith and what we need we need
[1:08:07] faith in this day we need preachers that
[1:08:10] can preach Faith to the people is that
[1:08:13] right praise the name of the Lord amen
[1:08:15] so we are really excited and I want you
[1:08:17] to understand that in God's Eden he
[1:08:20] found the serpent but I like when Mary
[1:08:22] went to the to the go in the graveyard
[1:08:25] she found the Lord Jesus who's our
[1:08:27] Shepherd you see some will find in the
[1:08:30] garden a serpent he found the serpent
[1:08:33] but Mary found the
[1:08:35] shepherd so the serpent came in God's
[1:08:38] Eden but the shepherd came to Satan's
[1:08:40] Eden oh my oh my God and I'm telling you
[1:08:44] God is about to send some angels to
[1:08:46] Satan's Eden so that the bride can hear
[1:08:49] from
[1:08:52] God my mind praise the Lord now watch
[1:08:55] here the devil came to God's Eden uhhuh
[1:08:58] and in God's Eden he put a man full of
[1:09:00] sin and he put sin on man and God hates
[1:09:04] sin and God had to God had to push Adam
[1:09:07] and Eve out of the garden because that
[1:09:09] was a perfect Eden right and God said
[1:09:11] listen Satan you came to my Eden and you
[1:09:14] placed a man of sin in my Eden but I'm
[1:09:17] coming now to Satan's Eden and you and
[1:09:20] I'm I'm going to go to your Eden and
[1:09:22] you're going to find a sin L
[1:09:24] man and Jesus said who can condemn me of
[1:09:29] sin you came to my Eden and you polluted
[1:09:32] my Eden you polluted Adam's bride but in
[1:09:36] the end time in Satan's Eden I'll put
[1:09:38] the Virgin Perfect Bride
[1:09:41] there oh I'm telling you the devil is in
[1:09:44] trouble amen the devil is in trouble
[1:09:46] amen praise God but I'm so excited I'm
[1:09:49] so excited amen and I want to tell you
[1:09:51] the coming of the Lord is very close the
[1:09:53] coming of the Lord is very close in fact
[1:09:55] the year
[1:09:57] 2023 is uh this church age right now in
[1:10:01] 2023 this church age since 196 up till
[1:10:05] today if you count it it's 117 years and
[1:10:09] the first church age is also 117 years
[1:10:13] that's right and brother Brenham said
[1:10:15] this church age should be the shortest
[1:10:19] yeah but now we are standing equal with
[1:10:21] the first church
[1:10:22] a was since 50 53
[1:10:26] ad I think it's uh till 170 if you count
[1:10:29] it it's 117 years that's how long the E
[1:10:33] the Ephesus Church was the church a but
[1:10:36] Luda should be shorter brother B said so
[1:10:40] we are now equal with the first church
[1:10:42] AIDS and I'm telling you the coming of
[1:10:44] the Lord is close this year we are
[1:10:48] standing exactly on the same amount of
[1:10:52] years that the first age is old yes so
[1:10:56] it tells me the coming of the Lord is
[1:10:57] very close right and this year 2023 is
[1:11:00] also the 9th
[1:11:02] anniversary after the prophecy at the
[1:11:05] Ohio River we he said your message will
[1:11:09] for on the second coming in that
[1:11:12] happened we know when it happened is it
[1:11:14] right 1933 and if you count it up till
[1:11:16] today it's 90 years now you may say
[1:11:18] brother what does that mean everybody
[1:11:21] talks about Abram was 100 years old but
[1:11:23] the Bible says Sarah the bride was 90
[1:11:26] years old when the promised son was born
[1:11:29] so can it be that we are getting close
[1:11:31] to the coming the season of the coming
[1:11:34] of the
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:36] Lord oh my even the Rabbi says in 2023
[1:11:41] before Christ they said Abram was called
[1:11:44] out of
[1:11:46] Babel oh my and Abram was 75 years old
[1:11:50] and here Israel is also 75 years old so
[1:11:53] we we are exactly on the same spot where
[1:11:55] God called Abram out to go into the
[1:11:58] promised land can it be that from this
[1:12:00] year we will see the promise of God
[1:12:02] coming to
[1:12:04] pass brother the coming of the Lord is
[1:12:06] drawing nigh Hallelujah and brother says
[1:12:09] you got to pinch yourself and know the
[1:12:11] coming of the Lord is here right there
[1:12:13] in in Daniel chapter 10 there was a
[1:12:17] delay to the to to to Daniel's prayer
[1:12:20] then Daniel was praying but there was a
[1:12:22] delay to the answer of his prayer oh and
[1:12:25] Michael had to deal with the delay and
[1:12:28] the Bible said on the 21st day Gabriel
[1:12:31] only came through but David said on the
[1:12:33] first day I've heard your prayer and I
[1:12:36] was sent oh but there was a battle in
[1:12:39] the atmosphere and there was a delay of
[1:12:41] 21 days and we are living in the 21st
[1:12:44] century and Michael dealt with the
[1:12:48] delays oh
[1:12:50] my and it's amazing that's Daniel 10
[1:12:53] when you go to Revelation
[1:12:55] 10 in Greek the word that says where the
[1:12:58] angel said time shall be no more means
[1:13:00] without delaying of time oh my so here
[1:13:05] Michael had to deal with the delaying of
[1:13:07] time in Daniel 10 but right here in
[1:13:10] Revelation 10 under the seventh seal a
[1:13:12] mighty Angel comes down to deal with the
[1:13:16] delaying of time brother B says the
[1:13:19] coming of the Lord is overdue right
[1:13:22] there's been a delay
[1:13:23] yes Matthew 25 says that they Jesus tell
[1:13:27] it to come so he should have came but he
[1:13:31] te it there was a delay right right but
[1:13:34] here the angel comes down put his foot
[1:13:35] on the land and sea and he says time no
[1:13:38] more without delaying of time amen oh
[1:13:41] brother I'm getting
[1:13:42] excited what do you mean delaying of
[1:13:44] time there's certain prophecies that
[1:13:46] needs to come to pass right but there's
[1:13:49] a delay right there's certain promises
[1:13:52] that needs to come to pass pass but
[1:13:54] there's a
[1:13:55] delay how many promises dreams visions
[1:13:58] and prophecies God gave to the bride but
[1:14:01] there's a
[1:14:02] delay but the mighty Angel is coming
[1:14:05] down to deal with those
[1:14:08] delays oh there's going to be no more
[1:14:10] delays to the Visions no more delays to
[1:14:13] the bride's promises all the prophecies
[1:14:15] over your life all those dreams all
[1:14:18] everything God revealed to you I'm
[1:14:20] telling you there will be no more delay
[1:14:25] amen it's going to come to
[1:14:27] pass no more delay that angel is about
[1:14:30] to deal with every delay that the devil
[1:14:32] is trying to put there there's going to
[1:14:35] be no more delays you better believe it
[1:14:38] because there's some promises and
[1:14:39] prophecies we've been waiting and
[1:14:41] trusting God but I'm telling you now is
[1:14:44] the season for God to come and bring
[1:14:46] that to
[1:14:48] pass praise the name of the Lord but
[1:14:50] amen I believe I've got a word for you
[1:14:52] tonight praise God Amen I believe I I
[1:14:55] was burdened since yesterday when Pastor
[1:14:57] sh told me you going to preach again I
[1:15:00] said no I need time to restore I need
[1:15:02] time to heal I I feel I feel I feel very
[1:15:05] tired he said no no no no brother you
[1:15:06] need to preach so I was you know if
[1:15:10] you're really end time preacher you
[1:15:12] should be like the Book of Malachi
[1:15:14] that's a type of the end time right now
[1:15:16] many people don't even know Malachi have
[1:15:18] seven letters in his name the same like
[1:15:20] with William brandham and he was the
[1:15:21] last prophet of the old
[1:15:24] Testament so he was the last prophet of
[1:15:26] the Old Testament that had seven letters
[1:15:27] in his name and here God sent us the
[1:15:30] last prophet to the Gentiles with seven
[1:15:31] letters in his
[1:15:33] name and Mal Malachi means my messenger
[1:15:37] so here God sends a messenger his last
[1:15:40] messenger in the Old Testament that had
[1:15:41] seven letters in his name and here we
[1:15:43] have our last prophet messenger that
[1:15:47] also have seven letters in his name and
[1:15:49] the numerology in in in in Malachi's
[1:15:52] name is 47 and brother brenham's
[1:15:55] Ministry actually started in 1947 that's
[1:15:58] it you see god is perfect oh god is
[1:16:01] perfect God Is So Perfect amen um but
[1:16:04] the coming of the Lord is very very very
[1:16:08] close amen and we should know that amen
[1:16:11] this is the season this is the time but
[1:16:13] I have a word to encourage you and I
[1:16:14] want to say this also that every real
[1:16:17] preacher will always be burdened amen
[1:16:21] every sickness that the people carried
[1:16:22] when brother touched the people it came
[1:16:24] on his hand there was a burden that came
[1:16:27] from the people on him a real true end
[1:16:31] time messenger or preacher or five-fold
[1:16:32] Minister will always carry a burden for
[1:16:35] the people so when you preach You Preach
[1:16:37] under the burden of the Lord that's why
[1:16:40] Malachi chapter 1 says the burden of the
[1:16:42] word of the Lord came to Malachi and
[1:16:45] Malachi is a is a type of an end time
[1:16:47] preacher amen so you could last night I
[1:16:50] couldn't sleep I was rolling around
[1:16:51] because you know I take I take it very
[1:16:52] serious
[1:16:54] and even today I wanted I tried to rest
[1:16:56] and but gy said you get some rest I said
[1:16:57] I Tred to rest but after this I'm
[1:16:59] telling you even on a way back home I
[1:17:01] told Brother gy gy uh um I said I must
[1:17:05] preach again he said yeah yeah brother
[1:17:07] you need to preach I said but listen
[1:17:08] brother B said he says the bride will
[1:17:10] have a short quick work and they and
[1:17:12] they will be out so I'm just going to go
[1:17:13] quickly behind the poopet and I will be
[1:17:15] out because a short quick work and now
[1:17:17] we out he said no no you don't do that
[1:17:20] brother you don't do that you don't do
[1:17:22] that so I'm trying I'm going to try to
[1:17:24] make up so can we stand for the reading
[1:17:26] of God's word out of respect um I don't
[1:17:30] want you to stand too long but I there's
[1:17:31] something I want to also touch here
[1:17:33] we're going to go to Ecclesiastes 7
[1:17:37] verse4 Ecclesiastes 7 verse
[1:17:41] 14 I first going to read it in the King
[1:17:43] James version if it's okay and then I'm
[1:17:45] going to read it in the message uh um
[1:17:50] version but before I oh I see both they
[1:17:52] got both on day thank you
[1:17:54] sister what I want to say about this
[1:17:56] scripture is Ecclesiastes
[1:18:00] 7:14 um this
[1:18:02] scripture is so connected to Triple
[1:18:05] 7 because 14 is two sevens right so East
[1:18:09] 7:14 is actually 7 right and I don't
[1:18:12] know if you know but God is a god of his
[1:18:14] numbers and you got to understand the
[1:18:17] numerology of God so the coming of the
[1:18:19] Lord is in Triple 7 but the coming of
[1:18:21] the Antichrist is in the triple
[1:18:23] right and I preached a few months ago on
[1:18:27] the tri six scriptures in the Bible and
[1:18:31] where triple six verses connects to the
[1:18:34] triple six the an the mark of the beast
[1:18:36] the Antichrist let me give you an
[1:18:38] example I so I preach the coming of the
[1:18:40] Lord or the verses the triple six verses
[1:18:44] is connected to the coming of the
[1:18:45] Antichrist and the triple six verses is
[1:18:48] connected to the coming of the Lord so I
[1:18:51] want you to see this let me make an
[1:18:53] example if you look at Ephesians 6:12 it
[1:18:56] speaks about principalities and
[1:19:00] demons principalities and demons
[1:19:03] Ephesians 6:12 if you take 12 it's two
[1:19:05] sixes so six and 12 gives you
[1:19:09] 666 and there you can see see demon
[1:19:11] Spirits which are definitely connected
[1:19:14] to the Antichrist right demon Spirits
[1:19:16] operating under that triple 6 scripture
[1:19:20] I hope you see it right and if you also
[1:19:22] read the seal it's Revelation 6 verse2
[1:19:26] again right where the where the
[1:19:28] tribulation will start and that is also
[1:19:32] 666 so you can see how these verses the
[1:19:36] Triple 6 verses reveal the work of the
[1:19:39] Antichrist and even the Triple 7 Isaiah
[1:19:43] 7:14 says a virgin shall
[1:19:46] conceive amen and there you see how
[1:19:49] Christ come through the Triple 7
[1:19:51] scriptures of vers how can it be is a
[1:19:55] coincidence that it's Isaiah
[1:19:58] 7:14 a virgin will conceive so Christ
[1:20:01] came through that Triple 7 and that's
[1:20:03] the coming of the Lord and I want you to
[1:20:05] see it and there also let me give you
[1:20:07] another one in Genesis 531 Noah's father
[1:20:10] died lamech died at the age of
[1:20:13] 777 years and then the Bible said and
[1:20:17] Noah and Noah is a type of the coming of
[1:20:19] the Lord right so you can see right
[1:20:21] through the Bible I took many scriptures
[1:20:23] out of the Bible and verses to prove to
[1:20:25] you how under the triple six the
[1:20:28] Antichrist will come but how under the
[1:20:31] Triple 7 Christ is coming the devil have
[1:20:34] a number God also have a number right
[1:20:37] and I want you to see that but wisdom
[1:20:39] reveals both right the wisdom of God is
[1:20:43] connected to the first coming and the
[1:20:45] wisdom of God is connected to the to the
[1:20:47] revealing of the Antichrist right I want
[1:20:49] you to see that right because the Bible
[1:20:51] said the first time he came wise men
[1:20:54] Came To Worship Him so can you see
[1:20:56] wisdom connected to the coming of the
[1:20:58] Lord and in Matthew 25 there's five wise
[1:21:02] virgins and that's connected to the
[1:21:04] second coming and I believe even to the
[1:21:06] third coming there's wisdom that's
[1:21:08] connected to it but that's why also you
[1:21:11] need wisdom so wisdom reveals the coming
[1:21:14] of the Lord and the wisdom of the Lord
[1:21:16] also reveals the
[1:21:18] Antichrist I want you to see it because
[1:21:20] Revelations 13:18 here is wisdom let him
[1:21:24] that have understanding count the number
[1:21:27] of the Beast and it's
[1:21:30] 666 and if you read about Solomon God
[1:21:33] gave Solomon wisdom and Solomon's salary
[1:21:36] was
[1:21:38] 666 talents of
[1:21:40] gold so you can see how wisdom is
[1:21:43] connected to revealing the coming of the
[1:21:45] Lord and the revealing of the Antichrist
[1:21:47] amen but I let me read the scripture
[1:21:49] this is a Triple 7 scripture if you can
[1:21:51] go to it let me read it first in the
[1:21:52] King James version if it's okay in the
[1:21:54] days of prosperity be joyful but in the
[1:21:58] day of adversity
[1:22:00] consider God also had set the one over
[1:22:03] against the other to the end that man
[1:22:06] should find nothing after him but if
[1:22:08] it's okay I want to read it in the MSG
[1:22:11] version on a good day enjoy
[1:22:16] yourself on a bad day examine your
[1:22:21] conscience God
[1:22:23] arranges oh my God God is in control God
[1:22:26] is in control of your days yes sir your
[1:22:28] good and bad days God is in control the
[1:22:32] devil don't have a say right God says
[1:22:36] God arranges for both kinds of days so
[1:22:41] that we won't take anything for
[1:22:45] granted brother you can never appreciate
[1:22:48] a good woman if you don't see a bad
[1:22:50] woman right is that right
[1:22:53] praise the name of the Lord can we close
[1:22:54] our eyes with a word of prayer father I

[1:23:58] bad days all right good and bad days and
[1:24:01] that's how I know I have to preach this
[1:24:04] because I was sitting between two
[1:24:06] sermons and the one I wanted to preach
[1:24:08] every time I go into it I I couldn't
[1:24:10] feel the Lord I couldn't feel his
[1:24:13] heartbeat I couldn't feel the presence
[1:24:15] of the Lord and I could feel how God is
[1:24:17] pushing me to this side I just wanted to
[1:24:19] mention this by greeting the church and
[1:24:21] the Lord said know this is the message
[1:24:24] this is what I want my people to hear is
[1:24:26] good and bad days I don't know about you
[1:24:28] but I'm sick and sick and tired of bad
[1:24:33] days I'm sick and tired of being sick
[1:24:35] and tired of bad days I want some good
[1:24:38] days I know we live in bad times amen
[1:24:42] bra says I read a quote last night amen
[1:24:45] he said we are living in the in the
[1:24:47] worst of of of of sinning of sinning
[1:24:50] times he said the greatest sin will be
[1:24:53] in the end time he said but at that same
[1:24:56] time it will be the greatest time for
[1:24:58] the Bride of Jesus
[1:25:00] Christ amen it will be the best of time
[1:25:03] for the Bride of Jesus Christ now good
[1:25:05] and bad days I've
[1:25:08] experienced so much bad days in my
[1:25:12] life that I don't even know how a good
[1:25:15] day look
[1:25:19] like I experienced so much bad days in
[1:25:22] my
[1:25:24] life that I thought it ought to be like
[1:25:26] that I accepted it that way I thought it
[1:25:30] had to be that way come on brother I
[1:25:32] thought when you serve God your life
[1:25:34] should be like this on come on now I
[1:25:37] thought to be a Christian is just to
[1:25:38] suffer and to carry a cross and to go
[1:25:42] through tribulations and bad times and
[1:25:44] experience bad things prach now I
[1:25:47] thought you only have to suffer your way
[1:25:49] to heaven yeah yeah
[1:25:53] oh but the devil is a
[1:25:56] liar why did David said this is the day
[1:25:58] that the Lord has made I will rejoice
[1:26:00] and be glad in it amen I've experienced
[1:26:04] so much bad days I didn't know how to
[1:26:07] act when I had a good
[1:26:12] day and God now and then would come
[1:26:14] because the Bible says he arranges the
[1:26:16] good and the bad days yeah so after a
[1:26:19] serious of bad days Our God normally
[1:26:22] comes and he arrang a good day right but
[1:26:26] when that good day came once a year or
[1:26:28] once in two years I didn't know how to
[1:26:32] act sir
[1:26:34] right I thought must I laugh or must I
[1:26:36] still
[1:26:38] cry like when somebody would give me a
[1:26:40] gift I would cry and what's wrong I'm
[1:26:42] just giving you something good I'm
[1:26:44] thinking you I'm so used to being
[1:26:45] treated bad I'm so used to experiencing
[1:26:48] bad moments I thought everybody is going
[1:26:51] to mock us and everybody's going to hate
[1:26:53] us and I'm I'm so hated by everybody and
[1:26:55] everybody's fighting you wherever you go
[1:26:58] family members at your job wherever you
[1:27:00] go in the street in the taxi in the
[1:27:02] community wherever you go even in church
[1:27:05] you think it should be like that and you
[1:27:07] come to a place where you accept
[1:27:11] it except no I must I must suffer it's
[1:27:14] part of life it's part of Christianity
[1:27:18] but let me tell you uh you're not going
[1:27:20] to fly away with a jet to heaven
[1:27:23] to go to heaven you need a cross you're
[1:27:25] not going to heaven with a Ferrari or
[1:27:28] with a por or a nice car Amen to go to
[1:27:30] heaven you need to pick up your cross
[1:27:33] and follow him and many times people
[1:27:34] don't want to pick up their cross
[1:27:36] because they see how Christians
[1:27:38] suffer come on that's right and I had to
[1:27:41] read the scripture over and over again
[1:27:43] he never said pick up your cross and
[1:27:45] follow
[1:27:46] me come on you can never pick up your
[1:27:49] cross and follow
[1:27:51] him
[1:27:52] on how many people pick up the cross
[1:27:54] they want to serve the Lord and the next
[1:27:55] day they
[1:27:58] backslide because that cross is heavy
[1:28:00] the Bible says deny yourself and pick up
[1:28:04] your cross and follow
[1:28:07] me a denied you will be able to pick up
[1:28:11] your cross and follow him but you cannot
[1:28:13] pick up your cross and just follow him
[1:28:16] now this sermon is going under the
[1:28:17] inspiration where brother preach all the
[1:28:19] days of our life come on a sermon on all
[1:28:23] the days of our life he said you better
[1:28:25] make up your mind and understand to
[1:28:28] serve God is not for a few
[1:28:31] minutes when you make a decision it's
[1:28:34] all the days of your life you should
[1:28:37] serve him it's not just till the Revival
[1:28:41] begins and when the Revival ends it's
[1:28:44] the end of
[1:28:46] you he said you better prepare yourself
[1:28:49] when God calls you it's going to be for
[1:28:51] the rest
[1:28:52] of your life that you will have to serve
[1:28:56] him you cannot serve
[1:29:00] him people try to serve him that's right
[1:29:03] you need the Holy Ghost to serve him
[1:29:05] that's
[1:29:06] right and you will never be able to pick
[1:29:08] up that cross you need to deny yourself
[1:29:10] you see you need to deny yourself every
[1:29:14] day the song says I'll choose you again
[1:29:17] and again and again Lord amen every time
[1:29:20] the devil will come around come on and
[1:29:22] and you will not able you will not be
[1:29:23] able to pick up your cross you need to
[1:29:25] deny yourself every day you need to turn
[1:29:29] against yourself your biggest enemy is
[1:29:32] yourself you need to kill yourself and
[1:29:35] brother B says you need to lay still and
[1:29:37] let God slay you and kill
[1:29:40] you and that's why you can
[1:29:42] misunderstand your trials you can
[1:29:45] misunderstand your pain you can
[1:29:48] misunderstand your
[1:29:50] sufferings
[1:29:52] brother say sometimes you can think it's
[1:29:53] a devil then it's God doing it and
[1:29:56] sometimes you think it's God then it's
[1:29:57] the devil doing it but you need to
[1:29:59] discern you see God needs to kill you
[1:30:01] now God needs to mold and and and and
[1:30:04] and break you and mold you and and put
[1:30:06] some character in you listen I always
[1:30:08] tell our church don't let your trial rob
[1:30:12] you R your
[1:30:15] trial don't come out of your trial
[1:30:18] poor listen Jesus went to hell he exper
[1:30:21] experienced yell but he came out of yell
[1:30:25] he didn't he didn't just come out of
[1:30:26] yell he came out with a
[1:30:31] key so while you experience yell in your
[1:30:35] life just find the
[1:30:38] key there's a revelation in your pain
[1:30:41] there's a revelation in your sufferings
[1:30:43] and once you find the key you will come
[1:30:46] out come out with a key come out of your
[1:30:50] trial with the Revelation come out with
[1:30:52] character come out with
[1:30:54] inspiration come out with Victory Rob
[1:30:58] your trial amen you says what this is
[1:31:01] what adoption is adoption is we are
[1:31:03] predestinated I always looked at the
[1:31:05] other churches I don't want to call
[1:31:07] names other churches and Pentecostal
[1:31:09] churches denominations and they just
[1:31:11] prosper and prosper but we as a bride
[1:31:13] why do we have to suffer like this Lord
[1:31:16] and then the Lord had to tell me we're
[1:31:18] not in the book of Corinthians we in the
[1:31:20] book of Ephesians he said say we are
[1:31:22] predestinated unto adoption and BR says
[1:31:25] in adoption book do you know what is
[1:31:27] adoption adoption is BR says the angel
[1:31:30] will come down God will send the angel
[1:31:33] and he will turn your family against you
[1:31:36] listen go to your job and turn all the
[1:31:38] colleagues against you go even into the
[1:31:42] church and turn the whole church against
[1:31:44] you just to see what you will
[1:31:49] do and then the prophet said the angel
[1:31:51] will go back to God and give a report he
[1:31:54] said I did this I turned his family
[1:31:56] against him but he still stood for you I
[1:31:59] turned his friends against him but he
[1:32:01] still stood for you I turned his
[1:32:03] colleagues against him but he still
[1:32:05] stood for you I even turned the church
[1:32:07] against him but he still stood for you
[1:32:10] and brother Brenham says and then God
[1:32:11] will tell his Angel let's go down and do
[1:32:14] something special for
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:19] him brother B says you know what is
[1:32:22] adoption adoption is problem upon
[1:32:25] problem upon problem trial upon trial
[1:32:27] upon trial we are predestinated unto
[1:32:31] adoption adoption means
[1:32:35] maturity you cannot murmur and cry all
[1:32:37] the
[1:32:38] time the brother did this somebody did
[1:32:41] this somebody did that I always tell my
[1:32:43] church when you say the brother did this
[1:32:44] the brother did that listen you can't
[1:32:45] serve God you need to die uhhuh and when
[1:32:48] you kick somebody that's dead he will
[1:32:50] not he cannot feel it that's right so
[1:32:51] why do you still feel emotional and hurt
[1:32:54] and you are not dead enough amen you
[1:32:56] need to die to serve him and God knows
[1:33:00] how to kill you brother
[1:33:03] say God knows how to work on your nerve
[1:33:06] on your
[1:33:07] weaknesses you know

[1:33:20] he knew he was creating the
[1:33:22] devil and he empowered
[1:33:25] him he empowered the enemy that's why
[1:33:29] sometimes when you're in a battle you
[1:33:30] feel this person overpowers you because
[1:33:32] the devil God gives the devil or your
[1:33:34] enemies he gives them power that's right
[1:33:37] ooo brother amen but I want to tell you
[1:33:40] whatever the devil is planning it's
[1:33:42] God's plan whatever your enemies is
[1:33:44] planning now they are planning the plan
[1:33:46] of God Amen because whatever they plan
[1:33:49] God created them to plan that that's
[1:33:51] right the plan that happened with Joseph
[1:33:53] God God was there when they planned it
[1:33:57] God allowed them to plan Ito don't don't

[1:34:10] dreams will go and they put him in the
[1:34:12] Putt and from the put he went to the
[1:34:14] prison and from the prison he went to
[1:34:15] the Palace but I want you to see this oh
[1:34:18] my God I want you to see this come on
[1:34:20] what happened so his brothers did that
[1:34:23] against him and then his colleagues did
[1:34:25] that against him and he went to prison
[1:34:28] but Joseph was on a journey that's
[1:34:31] called the Journey of
[1:34:33] forgiveness you see what actually put
[1:34:35] him on the throne was he had to forgive
[1:34:39] his brothers and his
[1:34:41] colleagues there's power in
[1:34:44] forgiveness listen forgiveness can open
[1:34:47] heaven for
[1:34:49] you I hope you see it
[1:34:52] forgiveness it doesn't even come from a
[1:34:54] man a normal man cannot forgive in the
[1:34:58] Garden of Eden they had everything but
[1:35:01] they were looking for forgiveness there
[1:35:03] was no forgiveness on the earth God had
[1:35:06] to come down from
[1:35:07] heaven you know to forgive it's a
[1:35:10] Heavenly
[1:35:12] nature God to come down from heaven and
[1:35:15] it took an animal slew he had to kill
[1:35:19] the animal to bring forgiveness
[1:35:22] so to forgive an animal inside of you
[1:35:24] need to
[1:35:25] [Music]

[1:35:32] die and there's power in forgiveness
[1:35:35] forgiveness put took uh Joseph it took
[1:35:37] Joseph out of prison and it put him on
[1:35:39] the throne he had to forgive each and
[1:35:41] everyone listen forgiveness open heaven

[1:36:35] I just got drifted away amen and I
[1:36:37] always said Lord must we only need just
[1:36:38] suffer must we only just suffer why does
[1:36:40] the other churches being blessed he said
[1:36:42] they not predestinated unto adoption
[1:36:44] adoption is pain upon pain suffering on
[1:36:45] suffering you need to master your
[1:36:48] trials you need to get a master agree in
[1:36:52] all your problems you need to grow up
[1:36:54] and mature in your problems in your
[1:36:57] trials oh I hope you see it that's why I
[1:37:01] preached one time on a series on the
[1:37:03] School of Life the school of life you
[1:37:06] see you you find people today they've
[1:37:08] never failed any
[1:37:10] exams since preschool up to University
[1:37:14] every exam they can they pass every exam
[1:37:17] they they pass the the the primary
[1:37:19] school exam the High School exam the uh
[1:37:21] uh uh colleague colleagues wherever they
[1:37:23] go they they pass all their test and
[1:37:25] they get doctor's degree and they get
[1:37:27] Professor degrees but they fail every
[1:37:30] day in the School of Life they fail to
[1:37:32] be a good husband they fail to be a good
[1:37:34] father we don't need Doctor degrees
[1:37:37] anymore we need Doctor degrees in the
[1:37:39] School of Life man that knows how to be
[1:37:42] a husband he knows how to be a father he
[1:37:44] knows how to be a grandfather he knows
[1:37:47] how to be a
[1:37:48] Christian that's right this world need
[1:37:51] te
[1:37:53] people that have a doctor degree a
[1:37:56] professor a master degree in the school
[1:37:58] of life where you can manage your
[1:38:01] problems your problems don't push you
[1:38:03] around you push your problems around
[1:38:06] that's right amen I hope you see it yes
[1:38:09] sir I I've always looked at Christianity
[1:38:11] and I said Lord it's just the cross
[1:38:13] Carry the Cross the cross the cross the
[1:38:15] cross and the cross it's always a cross
[1:38:17] and I had a bad understanding of the
[1:38:20] Cross yeah I thought it's just suffering
[1:38:22] and pain until the Lord sold me the
[1:38:24] cross is not just a cross the cross is
[1:38:27] also a
[1:38:30] door on the Feast of Passover where did
[1:38:33] they put the blood on the
[1:38:37] doorpost Jesus hang says Between Heaven
[1:38:39] and Earth Heaven didn't want him Earth
[1:38:41] didn't want him he hang Between Heaven
[1:38:42] and Earth why because he became the
[1:38:46] door so whatever cross you experience in
[1:38:49] your life in what whatever area in your
[1:38:52] life if you have a cross experience at
[1:38:55] and uh in your family it means that's
[1:38:57] also that same cross is a breakthrough
[1:39:02] also if you suffer in a at a certain
[1:39:07] company if you suffer financially it
[1:39:09] means there's a financial door that's
[1:39:12] also going to open amen because what
[1:39:15] good is a cross without the
[1:39:18] resurrection you see when they hang Jes
[1:39:21] Jesus they wrote something on his cross
[1:39:23] your cross have a name
[1:39:26] right and you should know why are you
[1:39:28] suffering why are you being crucified
[1:39:31] because they crucified him as the king
[1:39:33] of the Jews and go guess what he
[1:39:34] resurrected as the king of the
[1:39:36] Jews whatever is written on your cross
[1:39:39] that's the area God wants to resurrect
[1:39:41] you and glorify you
[1:39:43] in I hope you see it so you can
[1:39:47] misunderstand bad
[1:39:49] days and think why do I experience only
[1:39:51] bad days Lord but I want to go deep into
[1:39:54] this because I can feel we need to get
[1:39:56] an understanding of this so that we can
[1:39:58] become adopted Sons where God can trust
[1:40:02] us matured sons of God now watch here
[1:40:07] watch I want you to see this amen and I
[1:40:10] could never understand I didn't know how
[1:40:12] to act on a good day yeah and I'm
[1:40:16] telling you this message is for somebody
[1:40:17] in here if I'm only going to help one
[1:40:19] person or two person it's going to be be
[1:40:21] worth it maybe I'm going to help
[1:40:22] somebody on that's that's live streaming
[1:40:24] but I'm telling you amen amen praise the
[1:40:26] name of the Lord you got to understand
[1:40:28] your good and bad days but watch here oo
[1:40:32] Lord in Matthew
[1:40:34] 11:28 all you who are weary and burden
[1:40:37] come to me I will give you
[1:40:41] rest and that this is my experience I
[1:40:44] didn't understand Pastor sh in the world
[1:40:47] everything was went well for
[1:40:49] me but the minute I gave my heart to the
[1:40:53] Lord all yell broke
[1:40:56] loose and I couldn't understand because
[1:40:59] in the world everything just went well
[1:41:00] for me that's why many Christians
[1:41:06] backslide but the Bible says amen broad
[1:41:09] is the
[1:41:10] way and there's a many people on it and
[1:41:13] it looks nice and easy right but at the
[1:41:16] end it's
[1:41:18] death amen oh I hope you see it you see
[1:41:21] it Hallelujah and I really thought to
[1:41:24] serve God it's only you only experience
[1:41:27] bad times you only have sufferings and
[1:41:28] all of that amen I always I always had
[1:41:31] the wrong conception of the Cross until
[1:41:33] God show me the resurrection power Jesus
[1:41:36] said he endureed the
[1:41:38] cross when he saw the
[1:41:40] glory woo he could endure the cross
[1:41:43] because he saw beyond the cross he saw
[1:41:45] the resurrection he saw that he was
[1:41:47] going to be glorified and if you don't
[1:41:50] see that the devil will only put the
[1:41:52] cross there but if you see the
[1:41:55] resurrection behind your cross you will
[1:41:57] endure your
[1:41:59] cross when God showed me that every
[1:42:02] cross is a door I'm telling you I got
[1:42:05] enthusiastic to carry my cross I got
[1:42:07] excited I wanted more crosses I didn't
[1:42:10] know every cross is a breakthrough every
[1:42:12] cross is a
[1:42:13] resurrection Hallelujah so I hope you
[1:42:16] see it also also differently but watch
[1:42:18] here I could never understand
[1:42:21] why is life like this I'm only
[1:42:24] experiencing bad days and bad things
[1:42:26] happen but in the world everything was
[1:42:29] there was no problem there and that's
[1:42:31] why people backslide to go to the world
[1:42:33] Amen because it's a easy
[1:42:35] life watch here it looks like an easy
[1:42:38] life but the devil is a
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:43] liar and God that to deal with me about
[1:42:46] good and bad days you see we need the
[1:42:49] revelation of good and bad days you need
[1:42:52] a clear understanding about good and bad
[1:42:54] days and I believe that New Hope Revival
[1:42:57] family this is for you
[1:42:59] tonight I want you to understand it I
[1:43:03] was fighting with God when I was in the

[1:43:52] now you see um the Bible says we are
[1:43:54] wrestling our wrestling is not against
[1:43:56] flesh and blood but demons and
[1:43:58] principalities and these spirits but
[1:44:00] listen to this now Jacob also had the
[1:44:03] wrestling
[1:44:04] match come on but Jacob didn't wrestle
[1:44:08] demons no he wrestled with the angel of
[1:44:10] the Lord and I'm telling you I had the
[1:44:13] wrestling match with the angel of the
[1:44:16] Lord I wrestled about those good and bad
[1:44:18] days because I couldn't understand I'm
[1:44:20] serving you Lord yeah I don't miss
[1:44:24] Services every time when it's prayer
[1:44:26] meeting I'm there I'm living the life
[1:44:29] come on now I'm giving my everything
[1:44:31] come on maybe there's somebody that
[1:44:32] feels that way I'm giving my best to God
[1:44:35] I pay my ties my offerings I do
[1:44:36] everything that that you're asking me
[1:44:38] Lord why is life treating me this cruel
[1:44:42] yeah why do I only experience the bad
[1:44:44] look what happened to my family my
[1:44:46] children look what is happening All
[1:44:47] Around Me Lord look what happens to my
[1:44:49] car it's the one thing upon the other
[1:44:51] thing and I wrestled with the angel
[1:44:54] until the Lord answered me and I'm going
[1:44:56] to give you this I know he's going to
[1:44:57] bless you so watch here amen and I
[1:45:00] wrestled with the angel and God finally
[1:45:03] came and he spoke to me about good and
[1:45:04] bad days I was shocked when God told me
[1:45:09] I never ever created a bad day
[1:45:12] Hallelujah do you know go study go read
[1:45:16] your Bible God never ever created the
[1:45:18] bad day never did
[1:45:21] I didn't understand now why why why do I
[1:45:23] experience bad days and God so go go
[1:45:26] search the
[1:45:27] scriptures The only days I created was
[1:45:30] good days that's right God never ever up
[1:45:33] till today God only create good
[1:45:36] days and I had to go to Genesis 1 and in
[1:45:40] the beginning the spirit of God moved
[1:45:41] and he spoke let it be light and it was
[1:45:43] so and it was the first day and God said
[1:45:45] it was good second day it was good third
[1:45:48] day it was good fourth day day it was
[1:45:51] good the fth day it was
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:45:54] good so God never ever created a bad
[1:46:03] day so we're in trouble now we can we
[1:46:06] cannot blame God now because God only
[1:46:08] create good days and the Bible says it
[1:46:11] went on and on and the sixth day he
[1:46:12] created and he said it was very good and
[1:46:15] then the Bible goes on in the seventh
[1:46:16] day God rested so in other words God
[1:46:19] don't rest until everything is very
[1:46:24] good the reason you still experience bad
[1:46:27] days and chaotic days and dark days is
[1:46:29] because your God is still moving he's
[1:46:31] still
[1:46:32] working and he's not going to stop he's
[1:46:35] not going to rest until everything goes
[1:46:38] very good in your
[1:46:40] life the Bible said the sixth day and he
[1:46:42] said it was very good and then the
[1:46:44] seventh day he rested so want you to see
[1:46:46] this so God never ever created a bad day
[1:46:49] he only created good days Jeremiah 29:11
[1:46:52] says for I know the plans I have for you
[1:46:55] says the Lord plans to prosper you and
[1:46:58] not to harm you plans of Hope and
[1:47:01] future my God is a good
[1:47:04] God my God wants you to have a good
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:10] day God wants you to enjoy your day
[1:47:13] God's original plan was always good days
[1:47:16] God created good days good things for
[1:47:19] you to experience
[1:47:20] the goodness of the
[1:47:22] Lord you must only experience the
[1:47:24] goodness of the Lord God is is not the
[1:47:27] creator of bad days he's not the creator
[1:47:30] of dark days chaotic days God only
[1:47:32] create good days and I want you to see
[1:47:35] it because God is a good god he's a
[1:47:38] caring God don't you ever come to a
[1:47:41] place to blame
[1:47:45] God don't you ever put anything on God
[1:47:48] he's a great God he's a good God
[1:47:52] brother bam says he will never fail you
[1:47:54] you will fail him but he will never fail
[1:47:58] you now watch here he's a good God and
[1:48:03] he wanted you to enjoy life Hallelujah I

[1:48:07] speak to our young people God wanted you

[1:49:35] preacher I'm not there yet you mean to

[1:49:43] been this or I wouldn't be a doctor I
[1:49:45] would have drove a car there and be part
[1:49:47] of this and part of that but here
[1:49:48] brother Brenham says if I had A Thousand
[1:49:50] Lives I would give it all to him and it
[1:49:52] will be worth it he says but you only
[1:49:55] have this one life and you better give
[1:49:58] it all to him all the days of your life
[1:50:02] you better give it all to him now watch
[1:50:04] here he wants you to enjoy life he wants
[1:50:07] you to enjoy life and you should enjoy
[1:50:10] life but because sin
[1:50:12] increased they became more th NS right

[1:50:31] I want you to I want you to flow with me
[1:50:33] I want you to flow with me and I want
[1:50:34] you to see this as well amen so God
[1:50:36] created only good days God never created
[1:50:40] sick
[1:50:42] days Dark Days stressful
[1:50:46] days painful
[1:50:48] days God never never intended for you to
[1:50:51] have so much
[1:50:53] pain his original plan was a good plan
[1:50:57] in God's plan there's rest there's the
[1:51:00] goodness of the Lord there's provision
[1:51:03] everything you need is in the original
[1:51:06] plan and brother preacher sermon it was
[1:51:08] not so from the
[1:51:11] beginning that's why this message is
[1:51:14] taking us back to the beginning right I
[1:51:16] always wondered why is the devil
[1:51:18] fighting the message the way he it
[1:51:20] because this is the only message that
[1:51:22] can take you back to the original
[1:51:25] [Applause]
[1:51:27] plan Hallelujah not just Pentecost but
[1:51:30] all the way back to the Garden of Eden
[1:51:32] God never created amen days that you
[1:51:34] should experience tribulation and stress
[1:51:37] and full of problems and all of that
[1:51:38] listen God will work and work and work
[1:51:40] and work amen and work until you
[1:51:43] experience good
[1:51:44] days now watch here so and it came in
[1:51:48] the sixth day and he said it was very
[1:51:49] good good and on the seventh day God
[1:51:53] rested now listen to me quickly amen God
[1:51:56] wants to experience good days now if you
[1:51:58] have God created lights I always tell
[1:52:00] the church because the PE we we were
[1:52:04] foolish in when we came to the message
[1:52:05] they didn't taught us the right way if
[1:52:07] you want six
[1:52:09] children first build a six room
[1:52:15] house because God first created light
[1:52:20] water food fish he he created everything
[1:52:26] and lastly he created his
[1:52:28] son that's wisdom that's wisdom so when
[1:52:32] Adam was there there was already food
[1:52:34] kimes everything you need is already
[1:52:36] there everything was already
[1:52:38] there amen God's plan always work I tell
[1:52:41] the young sisters don't sometimes
[1:52:43] sometimes you allow a young man to
[1:52:44] become a father and he never desired to
[1:52:47] be a
[1:52:48] father R says God desired to be a
[1:52:52] father Yes in the beginning he had
[1:52:55] desire to be a father and he start
[1:52:57] working to become a father he started
[1:52:59] providing already created light created
[1:53:03] fishes created food he desired to be a
[1:53:06] father don't let a man make you pregnant
[1:53:09] and that man never desired to be a
[1:53:15] father find a man with a
[1:53:18] plan on father I preach this I said the
[1:53:21] God gives the plan always to the
[1:53:23] father come so if the father walks out
[1:53:26] the plan for your life walks out come on
[1:53:32] Brother come on now don't let any man be
[1:53:35] the be the father of your children on
[1:53:38] you better test him I like what says he
[1:53:41] says study nature they said the eagle
[1:53:43] don't allow any Eagle to just
[1:53:45] be her husband or the father of her kids
[1:53:48] they will fly they call it a love a love
[1:53:51] flight they will go high in the sky and
[1:53:53] then that the eagle will fall down to
[1:53:55] see if that that that that male Eagle if
[1:53:58] he will be able to look after the
[1:54:00] children if the children Falls from
[1:54:01] wherever if he can be able quick enough
[1:54:04] and lay down his life to catch that
[1:54:06] children don't allow any man to be your
[1:54:09] father of your
[1:54:11] kids need a man that have a
[1:54:14] plan a man that desires to be a father
[1:54:18] start working on it don't wait to become
[1:54:20] a father start working on your
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:25] fatherhood now watch this
[1:54:28] now as God created he said it was good
[1:54:30] when he made the fish it was good when
[1:54:31] he made food it was good when he made
[1:54:32] the fruits it was good everything he
[1:54:34] made he made and the vegetables and
[1:54:35] everything he said it was good now when
[1:54:37] you have listen to me now but when he
[1:54:41] made his first man of God he said it was
[1:54:44] very good so let me tell you now if you
[1:54:46] have lights in your house water food
[1:54:48] everything well that's good
[1:54:50] yeah but on but when God sends a man of
[1:54:55] God in your life it goes from good to
[1:54:57] very
[1:54:58] good because that man comes with thus
[1:55:00] say the Lord he comes with a word from
[1:55:03] God he comes to speak listen here I want
[1:55:05] you to see this after after God created
[1:55:09] the first man of God God created nothing
[1:55:12] further God rested I want you to see
[1:55:16] this now after God created his first man
[1:55:19] of God God did nothing further why
[1:55:21] because whatever you need that man will
[1:55:25] speak whatever you need that man will
[1:55:28] speak and when God found a man that can
[1:55:31] become the image of God God could rest
[1:55:35] in the days of no what there was trouble
[1:55:36] and air all of that you know what God
[1:55:38] was looking at God was looking for a man
[1:55:40] brother B says God have God always have
[1:55:43] a witness God will always have a man
[1:55:46] when you look at your problem God looks
[1:55:47] at a man the the Bible says in Job 14
[1:55:51] man born in his days are full of
[1:55:54] trouble some most of you are born with
[1:55:57] trouble that's why when you get born in
[1:55:59] the hospital they cannot release the
[1:56:00] baby they first do a checkup because
[1:56:02] you're born with
[1:56:05] trouble I want you to see that but
[1:56:08] there's certain men on the earth that's
[1:56:12] born with all the answers of your
[1:56:16] trouble you need to see that he said
[1:56:18] Jeremiah I created you in your mother's
[1:56:21] womb I formed you yep to be a prophet oh
[1:56:25] my God I Sanctified you in his mother's
[1:56:28] womb yes sir and at the right time God
[1:56:31] said open your mouth I'm going to put my
[1:56:34] word in your mouth that's right so your
[1:56:36] mouth is full of trouble all this and
[1:56:37] all this but there's men of God that
[1:56:39] have your answer so you are born with a
[1:56:42] lot of troubles but there's men that's
[1:56:44] born with your
[1:56:46] answers and you need God will always
[1:56:48] cross your path with those people to to
[1:56:50] have thus say the Lord for you there's a
[1:56:53] solution B says when you take your
[1:56:54] problem and you put it in the word you
[1:56:55] don't have a problem anymore right I
[1:56:57] hope you can see it but I need to be
[1:56:59] quick I need to be quick amen I need to
[1:57:00] be quick I really want to go into this
[1:57:03] and this is like a teaching I don't I
[1:57:04] don't mind if you don't jump and sou but
[1:57:06] I want you to get this but if you say
[1:57:08] now and then amen it will help the car
[1:57:09] moving it will help me to move but watch
[1:57:12] here so things must go very well in your
[1:57:14] life when a man of God steps in your
[1:57:16] life that's what should should happen
[1:57:19] why am mean because that man will have
[1:57:21] thus say the Lord and God is looking for
[1:57:24] a man that he can
[1:57:25] trust what thus say the Lord and he said
[1:57:28] I will rise up Shepherds to look after
[1:57:31] my
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] sheep men after God's Own
[1:57:36] Heart and that's what we need and that's
[1:57:39] how I see Pastor s is a man after God's
[1:57:41] Own Heart he carries the concern of the
[1:57:43] congregation he carries it with him he
[1:57:45] carries that burden him and his wife
[1:57:47] they are carrying it and that's what you
[1:57:49] should you need a Shepherd that's
[1:57:50] concerned that's burdened about
[1:57:53] you not only to my church I only only to
[1:57:56] my church now this is not to other
[1:57:57] church I preach in my church the bed of
[1:57:59] a man of
[1:58:00] God because when that when that woman's
[1:58:03] child die she put dead child on the bed
[1:58:07] of the
[1:58:08] Prophet that's right I hope you see
[1:58:11] it because men of God people think oh
[1:58:14] it's going well with man of God let me
[1:58:15] tell you every man of God sleeps with
[1:58:18] burdens on
[1:58:22] him and he needs visitations from
[1:58:25] God but God will come to his bed in in
[1:58:28] his room and the first thing God will do
[1:58:30] is he will he will look who's lying next
[1:58:31] to you before he speaks to you is the
[1:58:34] right woman lying next to you is it your
[1:58:41] wife I always tell my wife I cannot get
[1:58:44] a sermon from God unless you lie next to
[1:58:46] me I got five kids the reason for that
[1:58:49] is because because I a man of God will
[1:58:50] only lay two places he will lay at the
[1:58:53] feet of the Lord or with his wife there
[1:58:56] the only two places a man a true man of
[1:58:58] God will lay
[1:58:59] down at the feet of the Lord and with
[1:59:01] his own
[1:59:02] wife I hope you see it
[1:59:06] amen and she put that dead baby right
[1:59:09] there on his
[1:59:15] bed so it's not easy for a man of God he
[1:59:19] sleeps and in the night hours he can
[1:59:21] feel your burden your pain don't think
[1:59:23] nobody feels your pain and burden that's
[1:59:25] why you need to find preachers that
[1:59:27] preach with a
[1:59:29] burden somebody that experien your pain
[1:59:32] sometimes you a pastor that's called
[1:59:34] from God he can preach and while he's
[1:59:36] preaching he can feel that sister's pain
[1:59:37] in this side or that side brother
[1:59:39] Brenham could feel the people's sickness
[1:59:41] on his hand
[1:59:42] yes that's why had so much
[1:59:46] compassion oo Lord had compassion for
[1:59:50] the people because he could feel the
[1:59:52] pain they were
[1:59:53] in y and if you preach without
[1:59:57] compassion nothing will
[2:00:00] happen oh he told he told Ezekiel go
[2:00:02] late 30 days on this
[2:00:04] side I can't even lay 5 minutes on this
[2:00:06] side then I have to turn and 40 days on
[2:00:09] the other side before you go and
[2:00:11] prophesy you need to feel the pain so
[2:00:14] when you preach You Preach What a
[2:00:17] Feeling sometimes when I preach
[2:00:19] sometimes when when pastors preach and
[2:00:21] and and the fivefold ministers when
[2:00:23] ministers when they preach sometimes God
[2:00:25] put your burdens on them sometimes they
[2:00:28] even go through trials in life not for
[2:00:31] themselves but just to feel how it feels
[2:00:35] when you go through a
[2:00:38] Valley come on and God normally brings I
[2:00:41] always tell people how do you know who's
[2:00:43] your
[2:00:44] pastor your pastor never comes in your
[2:00:46] life when when it's green pastors yeah
[2:00:49] when everything goes well with the man
[2:00:50] in the business God normally connects
[2:00:53] you with your pastor when you in a
[2:00:55] valley that's
[2:00:58] right and your pastor will know that
[2:01:00] Valley and he will know how to lead you
[2:01:02] through your pastor brother and sister
[2:01:03] will see you
[2:01:04] through but let's go back to this bad
[2:01:07] days and good days because I want to
[2:01:08] show you something deep here here

[2:01:42] available amen hallelujah it's us oh
[2:01:47] listen and I want you to see this amen I
[2:01:51] want you to see this the devil never
[2:01:53] worried
[2:01:54] about anything or he didn't even move
[2:01:57] when God created the first day the devil
[2:01:59] didn't even move when God created the
[2:02:01] second day the devil didn't even move
[2:02:03] when God created the third day he was
[2:02:05] just sitting and
[2:02:06] watching but when God created the sixth
[2:02:09] day W the devil came closer he says what
[2:02:12] is
[2:02:13] this because remember the sixth day rule
[2:02:16] all the days yeah come on
[2:02:21] the sixth day rule the first day the
[2:02:24] second day the third day the fourth day
[2:02:25] and the fifth day he told Adam I give
[2:02:27] you
[2:02:29] dominion and to rule amen over the first
[2:02:33] second third fourth and fifth day that's
[2:02:35] why the devil didn't care and worry
[2:02:36] about when God created the lion he
[2:02:38] didn't worry about the lion when God
[2:02:40] created the the the fish he didn't worry
[2:02:41] about the
[2:02:44] fish but when God created Adam his eyes
[2:02:47] were on Adam because he heard God say to
[2:02:50] Adam these
[2:02:52] words Adam I give dominion to you over
[2:02:56] the Earth over the first day second day
[2:02:58] third day over the over the over the
[2:02:59] birds in the sky I give you dominion
[2:03:01] over the ocean I give says Adam had the
[2:03:04] master key he had the key to the ocean
[2:03:07] he had the key to Nature he had the key
[2:03:09] to the to the fishes he had the key to
[2:03:11] the birds he said Adam had the master
[2:03:14] key woo I hope you see it I hope you see
[2:03:17] it so the devil didn't worry about all
[2:03:19] the other days he cared about the sixth
[2:03:23] day that's why the devil is always after
[2:03:26] people that wants to become the image of
[2:03:28] God Amen and the only way for you to
[2:03:31] become the image of God is the message
[2:03:33] of the hour the unadulterated word of
[2:03:37] God the original plan now watch here so
[2:03:41] the devil knew if I can get the sixth
[2:03:43] day then I can rule all the days I can
[2:03:46] rule the ocean I can rule the birds I
[2:03:48] can rule everything but the devil forgot
[2:03:51] there's one day God didn't give to Adam
[2:03:53] and that was the seventh
[2:03:54] day and God said the seven days is my
[2:03:57] [Applause]
[2:03:59] day I hope you see it oh there's just
[2:04:02] one day left amen there's just one move
[2:04:05] left just once more Lord amen just once
[2:04:08] more amen praise the name of the Lord
[2:04:10] there was a man there was a story they
[2:04:12] told about this man that played chess he
[2:04:14] played chess with the devil and the
[2:04:15] devil got him in a corner and he didn't
[2:04:17] know what to do
[2:04:19] and then amen God came down the master
[2:04:22] chess player and he told the man don't
[2:04:24] worry and the man wanted to give up
[2:04:26] there some of you they want to give up
[2:04:28] and then God told the man listen there's
[2:04:31] one more move and the devil don't know
[2:04:33] about it there's one more move let me
[2:04:36] tell you amen he can deceive you with
[2:04:37] the written word right but brother
[2:04:39] Brenham told us there's an Unwritten
[2:04:41] part yeah on amen he doesn't know what
[2:04:44] is that right so he cannot deceive you
[2:04:47] with the unwritten part but he can
[2:04:48] receive you with the written part of the
[2:04:50] word
[2:04:51] right there's just one move let me tell
[2:04:54] you it took all the days maybe the devil
[2:04:57] ruled your whole life I'm telling you
[2:04:59] there's one day the devil cannot take
[2:05:00] amen and that was the seventh day and
[2:05:03] God is the seventh day and that's the
[2:05:05] day of rest that's the day of Shalom
[2:05:08] that's the day of
[2:05:11] peace am now watch you quickly can I go
[2:05:15] on Pastor sh let me go on let me go on I
[2:05:18] don't like a boring preacher I don't
[2:05:19] want to sound boring I want to I want
[2:05:21] you to I want to I want to get you to a
[2:05:22] point amen I want to get you to a point
[2:05:25] so I believe I also believe that Adam
[2:05:27] fell on the sixth day that's only my
[2:05:29] belief I'm not saying th say the Lord
[2:05:31] God created Adam on the sixth day and
[2:05:33] Adam fell on the sixth day Adam backslid
[2:05:35] it on the sixth day it's amazing how
[2:05:36] many people will backslide on a
[2:05:39] Friday and tonight is Friday the sixth
[2:05:43] day it's amazing because some people in
[2:05:46] our country there some people get paid
[2:05:47] weekly on a Friday some people on a
[2:05:49] fortn night it's on a Friday and that's
[2:05:51] the day they will go and backslide and
[2:05:53] go drink they don't backslide on a
[2:05:55] Monday Tuesday they will go backslide on
[2:05:56] the sixth day because Adam fell on the
[2:05:58] sixth day they don't even know there's
[2:06:00] the original fall happen on the sixth
[2:06:03] day yeah woo Lord now watch here why do
[2:06:06] you believe it Adam fell on a
[2:06:09] Friday because the last Adam died on a
[2:06:11] Friday brother Brenham said he said God
[2:06:14] that to meet the devil on all the
[2:06:16] grounds that Adam fell on Adam fell
[2:06:19] naked and Jesus had to hang naked Adam
[2:06:21] and that's why I believe Adam fell on a
[2:06:22] Friday and Jesus had to pay the price on
[2:06:24] a Friday y woo Lord I hope you see it I
[2:06:28] hope you see it I hope you see it and
[2:06:30] that's why the sixth day became a fallen
[2:06:32] day and that's why we find the triple
[2:06:33] six The Mark of the Beast number six
[2:06:36] became a fallen number brother B says
[2:06:38] yes number six became a fallen number
[2:06:40] because the Beast and Man became one
[2:06:43] that's why the triple six is a number of
[2:06:44] a beast but it's also a number of a man
[2:06:47] right right because that's what happened
[2:06:49] in the Garden of Eden woo I want you to
[2:06:51] see this I want you to see this so I
[2:06:53] believe the the lost son left his
[2:06:55] father's house on this on a
[2:06:57] Friday Adam fell on a Friday but Jesus
[2:07:01] also died on a Friday and I want you to
[2:07:03] see that amen hallelujah but the lost
[2:07:06] son amen when he said I will rise and go
[2:07:08] to my father's house that was on a
[2:07:10] Sunday because Sunday is resurrection
[2:07:12] morning and he said I will rise and go
[2:07:14] back to my father's house Oho I hope you
[2:07:16] see it I hope you see it there's a day
[2:07:18] of return Hallelujah and we are calling
[2:07:21] right now the seed of Abram to come back
[2:07:23] to the house of the Lord hallelujah
[2:07:25] hallelujah now watch here okay okay
[2:07:28] brother can you show us this now watch
[2:07:30] here God made his image on the sixth
[2:07:34] day and here the mark of the beast and
[2:07:37] the
[2:07:37] devil also make an image in the Book of
[2:07:40] Revelation unto the Beast because he's a
[2:07:43] copycat and he does it under the number
[2:07:47] 666 to show you God under six Day
[2:07:49] created His Image but here the devil
[2:07:51] also under triple six create His Image
[2:07:55] so the Bible opened with the image of
[2:07:56] God and the Bible closes with the image
[2:07:58] of the devil I want you to see that amen
[2:08:01] now watch here carefully amen but listen
[2:08:03] now God never created a bad day but
[2:08:07] where does bad days come from Genesis 1
[2:08:10] he introduced him as a Creator only good
[2:08:13] days where did bad days start because
[2:08:16] Genesis is a book of the beginning so
[2:08:18] everything begin in the Book of Genesis
[2:08:20] so good days started in the Book of
[2:08:22] Genesis but bad days also started in the
[2:08:24] Book of Genesis and you can read in
[2:08:26] Genesis 2 God told Adam the day you eat
[2:08:31] of that tree that's the day you
[2:08:35] die that's good so right there amen bad
[2:08:39] day started when God said in Genesis 2
[2:08:42] he gave the horning Genesis 3 men AE of
[2:08:45] that tree and that's the day and that's
[2:08:47] the beginning of bad days
[2:08:51] yeah so in other words
[2:08:54] sin yes sir sin created bad
[2:08:59] dayso brother don't be part of sin
[2:09:02] because sin will give you chaotic
[2:09:06] days don't be part of sin watch here I
[2:09:09] want you to see this so God created only
[2:09:11] good days but God Amen God Amen
[2:09:15] Hallelujah said Adam the day you eat of
[2:09:17] De read that's the day you will die so
[2:09:22] we see Genesis 1 good day original plan
[2:09:24] Genesis 2 God give the horning Genesis 3
[2:09:27] bad day started it became a bad
[2:09:30] Friday so bad day started on a
[2:09:34] Friday that's why Jesus died on a Friday
[2:09:37] and it's called Good
[2:09:39] Friday so every bad day was reversed to
[2:09:43] a good day when he hanged on Calvary I
[2:09:46] hope you can see that and God restored
[2:09:48] all the years that was taken away but
[2:09:51] when bad days
[2:09:54] come and God can only create good days
[2:09:57] but when bad days come it means you made
[2:10:00] wrong
[2:10:02] decisions you see brother B said you
[2:10:05] still stand before that threee to doal
[2:10:07] today you can make fun of Adam and and
[2:10:09] Eve and say how did you why did you do
[2:10:10] that he said but even every day that two
[2:10:13] trees is standing in front of us every
[2:10:15] day and you need to make a decision
[2:10:17] brother Brenham called the book of Ruth
[2:10:18] the book of redemption the book of
[2:10:20] decisons and I want you to show you this
[2:10:22] here right now in the in Ruth when you
[2:10:26] read Ruth it only have four
[2:10:28] chapters there's not a lot of chapters
[2:10:30] you know why because Ruth made the right
[2:10:32] decisions right wrong decisions in your
[2:10:35] life will give you unnecessary
[2:10:39] [Applause]
[2:10:41] chapters and we don't want unnecessary
[2:10:43] chapters in our life we want good
[2:10:47] chapters
[2:10:50] we don't want a lot of chapters in our
[2:10:52] life Ruth only had four chapters in her
[2:10:54] life Ruth chapter one she made the right
[2:10:58] decision says you make up your mind you
[2:11:02] make a
[2:11:03] decision you serve under your decision
[2:11:06] and God will reward you don't give up
[2:11:09] now amen you made a decision to serve
[2:11:12] the Lord you got to stand under your
[2:11:15] decision you got to serve under your
[2:11:17] decision and then he said the third part
[2:11:19] is God will reward
[2:11:22] you so don't give up now that's
[2:11:24] excellent because God is getting ready
[2:11:27] to reward New Hope Revival Ministry
[2:11:29] don't give up
[2:11:32] now so rotth chapter 1 she made the
[2:11:34] right decision right right come
[2:11:38] on I want you to see Naomi couldn't
[2:11:40] change her mind when Naomi saw she made
[2:11:43] up her mind she stopped why can the
[2:11:46] devil still speak to you
[2:11:49] because you didn't make up your mind but
[2:11:52] when you make up your mind and you say
[2:11:54] here I stand your God is my
[2:11:57] God your family is my family where you
[2:12:01] go I go wherever the Lord leads there I
[2:12:03] will go and Naomi stopped nagging on her
[2:12:07] to go back to her old life why can why
[2:12:11] can the old life still speak to you why
[2:12:13] can sin still speak to you because the
[2:12:16] devil knows you never made up your mind
[2:12:20] completely but you need to tune down the
[2:12:22] devil and put him on mute and let the
[2:12:25] voice of God speak to
[2:12:27] you now watch here so
[2:12:30] Ruth made the right decision in Ruth
[2:12:32] chapter 1 and then she went to chapter
[2:12:35] two what is rotth chapter 2 the right
[2:12:37] decision will take you to the right
[2:12:40] places and you will meet the right
[2:12:44] people she made the right decision in

[2:12:49] the right people and she her the seasons
[2:12:51] took her to the right
[2:12:55] place and what is rotth chapter 3
[2:12:58] because he was at the right place yes
[2:13:02] amongst the right
[2:13:03] people in rotth chapter 3 they gave her
[2:13:06] the right
[2:13:10] advice I hope you see it root chapter 1
[2:13:12] the right decision root chapter 2 the
[2:13:14] right people the right place root
[2:13:16] chapter 3 the right place and the right

[2:18:43] give you a bad day he can give you a
[2:18:45] terrible day he can give you a bad day
[2:18:48] now watch here but you need to get the
[2:18:49] revelation of your
[2:18:51] days now number one yeah I only begin
[2:18:55] now you have to understand where days
[2:18:58] come
[2:18:59] [Applause]
[2:19:01] from so if you read Genesis 1 the spirit
[2:19:04] of God moved and the spirit spoke uhhuh
[2:19:10] on and then he said it was good and then
[2:19:13] he said it's the first
[2:19:16] day so what how did the day came it came
[2:19:19] out of the spirit of God
[2:19:23] Amen you got to understand that a day is
[2:19:26] born out of the spirit of God right so
[2:19:30] what does that tell us that every day is
[2:19:33] ruled by
[2:19:36] Spirits every day you have to deal with
[2:19:40] Spirits because days are born out of the
[2:19:43] spirit of God and that's why the the
[2:19:46] demon spirits will come because they
[2:19:48] know a day is contained by spirits come
[2:19:52] on you got to see this you got to see
[2:19:55] this and that's why brother B say I take
[2:19:56] every Spirit under my control by the
[2:19:59] spirit of the Holy
[2:20:01] Ghost you need to control your day you
[2:20:03] see there every day there Spirits coming
[2:20:05] to attack you in life it's not it's not
[2:20:07] flesh and blood you fighting it's demon
[2:20:08] Spirits so the spirit is coming every
[2:20:10] day because a day is is the result of
[2:20:13] the day depends on what Spirit you
[2:20:15] believe and what spirit surrender to
[2:20:18] that's right now I'm talking about good
[2:20:20] days how to experience good days I want
[2:20:22] you to see this I want you to see this
[2:20:24] so
[2:20:26] days your day depend on what Spirit you
[2:20:28] listen to and what Spirit you
[2:20:32] move everything that you deal every day
[2:20:35] with there's a spirit behind
[2:20:39] itoo I hope you see it yeah because out
[2:20:42] of the day came the spirit out of the
[2:20:43] Spirit came a day so Genesis 1 out of
[2:20:47] the Spirit came a day Revelation one
[2:20:49] look at the beginning Genesis 1 the
[2:20:52] spirit moved and a day came it was born
[2:20:55] in Revelation 1 John says I was in the
[2:20:58] spirit on the Lord's day you see John
[2:21:01] got a revelation that out of the Spirit
[2:21:04] came a day and for me to overcome and to
[2:21:07] survive I need to come in the
[2:21:11] spirit that's good so for you now I hope
[2:21:15] you see it so
[2:21:18] days was created by the spirit of God
[2:21:20] and that's why every day you fight
[2:21:23] Spirits Hallelujah woo and you have to
[2:21:24] see this and the prophet said you need
[2:21:26] to take control over every spirit so
[2:21:29] everything is about spirits and number
[2:21:30] two you got to understand every day you
[2:21:33] are facing Spirits I hope you see it if
[2:21:36] you don't see this you will continue to
[2:21:39] face bad days you got to understand it's
[2:21:42] not that sister it's not that colleague
[2:21:44] at work it's not that family member
[2:21:47] brother says if we can if we can kill
[2:21:49] the influence the spirit that influenc
[2:21:52] that person we can save that
[2:21:56] person if we stop the influence that's
[2:21:59] right so kill the influence which is a
[2:22:01] spirit that manager that's full of
[2:22:03] devils at
[2:22:06] work if you can take authority over the
[2:22:09] spirit that's using her that's
[2:22:13] right and just speak over her life and
[2:22:15] said you are the sweetest man manager
[2:22:18] you are the best of the best and just
[2:22:20] release the spirit of God over that
[2:22:22] person you will experience a better
[2:22:24] manager that's right that's right amen
[2:22:26] amen now watch your number two number
[2:22:27] two so number one you need to understand
[2:22:29] you're fighting Spirits every day every
[2:22:31] day it's Spirits every day and that
[2:22:33] demon Spirits can use your children your
[2:22:35] wife your husband whoever and you need
[2:22:37] to get the revelation of it number
[2:22:39] two days are created by
[2:22:43] words on the spirit move God poke yes
[2:22:48] and that's where come into the spoken
[2:22:49] word is God's original seed listen now
[2:22:52] what I say so your word your day
[2:22:55] determines what words is being
[2:22:58] used and God said in the first day let
[2:23:00] it be light there was light God said Let
[2:23:02] It Be fish there was fish right so
[2:23:04] whatever you see today the mountains the
[2:23:07] rivers its words right that's right so
[2:23:11] words create your day show me your life
[2:23:15] then I'll tell you what words you use
[2:23:17] hello
[2:23:20] amen show me your life then I know what
[2:23:22] words you use because words controls a
[2:23:27] day now let me make an example let me
[2:23:29] show you how words control your day the
[2:23:31] spirit of God spoke the first day the
[2:23:33] spirit the spirit of God moved and spoke
[2:23:34] again the spirit of God spoke again so
[2:23:36] words create
[2:23:39] days it's amazing how you go to work in
[2:23:42] the morning and you go to work when you
[2:23:43] come home you tell your your wife ask
[2:23:45] you how was your day you said I had a
[2:23:46] bad day day and your wife will ask you
[2:23:48] what happened and you said maybe the
[2:23:49] manager uh had a fight with me or or the
[2:23:52] manager argued with me or said something
[2:23:55] ugly about me and that's why I had a bad
[2:23:57] day because somebody gave you bad words
[2:24:00] come on come
[2:24:02] on because words make your
[2:24:07] dayoo I hope you see it I hope you see
[2:24:09] it that's why Eve had a bad day because
[2:24:11] she received Satan's words the serpent
[2:24:14] the Serpent's words she believed his
[2:24:16] words and she from that day she
[2:24:18] experienced pain and sufferings but Mary
[2:24:21] said Let It Be unto me according to Thy
[2:24:26] word your day is determined by
[2:24:31] words came in the prayer line and a
[2:24:33] woman came up I think it's on the video
[2:24:35] the woman came to says you're not
[2:24:38] sick I see a dark
[2:24:40] cloud it's
[2:24:43] lies in fact it's church people they
[2:24:45] called you a witch
[2:24:47] he says the stress and the panic and the
[2:24:50] nervousness is caused by what they said
[2:24:52] over your
[2:24:56] life that woman was in pain she was in
[2:24:59] sufferings she had a nervous breakdown
[2:25:01] because somebody called her a
[2:25:04] witch and brother Brenham said sister
[2:25:07] don't believe it you are
[2:25:10] healed wo brother brother and sister
[2:25:13] listen that's why it's good to be
[2:25:15] amongst people that pronounces the right
[2:25:17] words over your life don't be in a
[2:25:19] company of people that hate you don't
[2:25:21] walk with people that back mouth you and
[2:25:23] badmouth you be careful for what people
[2:25:26] say and speak over your life you need to

[2:25:40] words and you you still get
[2:25:45] depressed because that words never died
[2:25:48] right dead words come up and down and
[2:25:50] the devil takes it and through your mind
[2:25:52] and every time you get upset of these
[2:25:53] words and you get nervous breakdowns
[2:25:55] that's why you need to cancel that words
[2:25:56] in the spiritual realm that's right you
[2:25:59] need to be amen like Maran like Maran
[2:26:01] said I received the word of God in my
[2:26:03] life God told me he said you need to
[2:26:06] know how to delete some people's words
[2:26:08] and you know and when somebody has
[2:26:10] something good to say about you you need
[2:26:11] to record their words and replay it now
[2:26:13] and
[2:26:14] then that's good brother and say what
[2:26:16] ever somebody say bad about you I don't
[2:26:18] care what you say I care what God have
[2:26:20] to say about me

[2:26:26] Pastor sh watch here watch here so if
[2:26:29] you understand that every day is
[2:26:31] controlled by spirits and words can you

[2:26:39] power words can can give you a chaotic
[2:26:42] day be in a company of people that knows
[2:26:45] how to speak good words over you right
[2:26:48] that's why the Jews I think Pastor sh
[2:26:50] preach about it to to ha the seeds of
[2:26:52] Destiny in your
[2:26:53] life get people that water the seeds of
[2:26:56] Destiny in your life that say you are a
[2:26:58] good child or you're going to be this

[2:27:00] be great you are going to be successful
[2:27:03] you are you are going to be
[2:27:05] blessed
[2:27:07] blessed now watch brother B um now watch
[2:27:10] I want you to see
[2:27:13] this if people don't have anything good
[2:27:15] to say about you the prophet said
[2:27:17] rather keep your mouth yeah if you have
[2:27:19] nothing good to say about your brother
[2:27:21] keep quiet because the prophet knows
[2:27:24] what words can do right you are killing
[2:27:28] somebody's
[2:27:30] husband you are killing Somebody's
[2:27:32] Daughter with your
[2:27:35] words you are messing people's marriages
[2:27:37] up with your words every time that man
[2:27:39] comes home from work depressed and who
[2:27:42] suffers the wife and the
[2:27:45] children that's why we know our role as
[2:27:48] preachers we need to say thus say the
[2:27:51] Lord don't allow the enemy to speak over
[2:27:54] your life don't allow the enemy to ever
[2:27:56] speak over your children speak the word
[2:27:59] of God over your own
[2:28:01] life oh my God oh
[2:28:05] my I'm nearly there I'm nearly there
[2:28:08] brother says words is so powerful he
[2:28:11] says even Noah's if we have the right
[2:28:13] instruments we can still pick up Noah's
[2:28:16] sermon
[2:28:19] he says we can even if we tune in we can
[2:28:22] even pick up the unwritten word whatever
[2:28:25] was discussed on the mountain of
[2:28:26] transfiguration between Jesus Moses and
[2:28:29] Elijah brother I want to tune into that
[2:28:32] yeah you can stay next to a radio
[2:28:34] station if you're not tuned in you will
[2:28:37] hear
[2:28:39] nothing right says there's something
[2:28:41] inside of you that can pick up the
[2:28:43] supernatural
[2:28:45] yes that's good
[2:28:48] I'm more interested in what Noah
[2:28:50] preached what was said on the mountain
[2:28:52] of transfiguration come
[2:28:56] on because it changed Jesus body and we
[2:28:59] are the body of Jesus Christ whatever
[2:29:01] was discussed there
[2:29:04] on the Mysteries the secrets what
[2:29:06] everyone just discussed there the
[2:29:08] mystery to our body chain lays right
[2:29:10] there because it's a closing and opening
[2:29:12] of a dispensation amen and I want you to
[2:29:14] see it I want you to see it I'm more
[2:29:16] interested in that then to worry what
[2:29:17] people have to say about us now watch
[2:29:19] here watch here you have to have
[2:29:21] revelation of your day you got to
[2:29:23] understand your day it's important to
[2:29:26] understand it so how do you receive good
[2:29:28] days here we go now Point number one
[2:29:31] start your day like God starts his day I
[2:29:34] said Lord how do you start your day he
[2:29:36] said go read Genesis 1 I started my day
[2:29:39] with Heaven first and then I made my
[2:29:42] Earth don't just jump
[2:29:45] up and go face your
[2:29:48] day but make sure that when you begin
[2:29:51] and start your day begin your day with
[2:29:53] Heaven yeah that's good and after you
[2:29:57] started your day with heaven then you
[2:29:59] can face your Earth
[2:30:02] yeah face your Earth with your Heaven
[2:30:05] the Bible says as it is in heaven so
[2:30:07] shall it be on the earth so everything
[2:30:09] the will of God is Not on even on the
[2:30:11] earth the will of God for your life is
[2:30:14] in
[2:30:15] heaven so you to live and put your ear
[2:30:18] into heaven to hear what God have to say
[2:30:20] about your life so that it can manifest
[2:30:23] on the earth for you so when you start
[2:30:25] your day with Heaven you can face your
[2:30:27] Earth whatever your Earth is
[2:30:32] hallelujah Point number
[2:30:34] two start your day with the spirit of
[2:30:36] God because days were born out of the
[2:30:38] spirit of God then you will have a good
[2:30:40] day start your day with the word of God
[2:30:42] because the word of God Is Creative it
[2:30:45] Chang atmospheres it can change your day
[2:30:48] it can it can change a bad day into a
[2:30:50] good day brother Bram said he said how
[2:30:52] many times he said that man since birth
[2:30:55] that blind man experienced bad days he
[2:30:57] said but Jesus came and changed it from
[2:30:59] that day with his
[2:31:01] words with the word of God he changed
[2:31:04] their lives so start your day with a
[2:31:06] with a spirit of God with heaven with
[2:31:09] with the word of God now watch here so
[2:31:11] God is still in control amen the
[2:31:13] musicians can come Ecclesiastes 7:4 now
[2:31:16] I'm going to deal with this God arranges
[2:31:19] the days the good and the
[2:31:23] bad so although God only created good
[2:31:26] days
[2:31:28] right bad days were also born right but
[2:31:32] God is saying listen Satan you are not
[2:31:34] in control of the good and the bad days
[2:31:38] you are you are not going to determine
[2:31:40] the good when is going to be a good day
[2:31:42] when it's going to be a bad day because
[2:31:44] I'm going to arrange it
[2:31:47] so when God sees you go through too much
[2:31:49] trials in life God will arrange a good
[2:31:53] weekend like this weekend I feel we're
[2:31:55] going to have a good
[2:31:57] weekend some of you experience hell this
[2:32:00] whole
[2:32:00] week maybe for years for months but I'm
[2:32:03] telling you this weekend you are going
[2:32:05] to experience the goodness of
[2:32:09] God because God arranges it now and then
[2:32:14] and what does the Bible say God took to
[2:32:16] the scripture on a good day enjoy
[2:32:18] yourself
[2:32:22] yeah so whenever God brings you a good
[2:32:25] day enjoy it right but he says examine
[2:32:28] your bad days so in other
[2:32:31] words go back and look through your day
[2:32:34] what mistake did I do good who did I
[2:32:36] listen to what Spirit did I allow how
[2:32:39] did the enemy get in how did the devil
[2:32:42] come in here you need to ex you need to
[2:32:45] examine your bad days you know why the
[2:32:47] Bible says examine your bad days so that
[2:32:49] you can have no more bad days you can
[2:32:51] only lesser and lesser the more you
[2:32:53] examine your bad days the lesser lesser
[2:32:56] bad days you will
[2:33:00] experience oo Lord help me Father help
[2:33:04] me
[2:33:05] Lord so I'm going to finish off here
[2:33:08] Satan is not in
[2:33:10] control Satan is not in
[2:33:12] control oh God will arrange a good day
[2:33:15] for you and you hope Revival it's time
[2:33:18] I'm ending your bad
[2:33:20] days you can speak it and say devil oh
[2:33:24] you know Revelation 12 the devil says my
[2:33:26] time is short you need to remind him
[2:33:28] when the devil take a minute of your day
[2:33:30] you say hey remember in Revelation 12
[2:33:33] you said my time is short your time is
[2:33:34] short get out here don't give the devil
[2:33:37] a
[2:33:39] minute he will take an hour if you give
[2:33:42] him an hour he'll take a day if you give
[2:33:44] him a day he'll take your week if you if
[2:33:46] you give him a week he will take your
[2:33:47] month if you give him a month he will
[2:33:48] take your
[2:33:50] [Music]
[2:33:52] year so tell the devil I'm not giving
[2:33:55] you a
[2:33:56] minute the minute he walks in you stop
[2:33:59] him O Lord Oh Lord and remind him your
[2:34:04] time is
[2:34:05] short I don't have time for the
[2:34:08] devil oh we want time with
[2:34:12] God confuse the devil now what I'm
[2:34:16] ending off the Bible talks about the
[2:34:19] Lord's
[2:34:20] day they can play
[2:34:23] something if they can play that How
[2:34:25] Great Is Our God watch here
[2:34:29] God the day of the
[2:34:31] Lord God in Genesis only created good
[2:34:33] days and God is about to restore it he's
[2:34:36] about to take us back there
[2:34:38] Hallelujah where even brother Brenham
[2:34:40] experience a
[2:34:41] storm and he wanted to run down the
[2:34:45] mountain but it brother bam came into
[2:34:48] the day where he became a
[2:34:52] chew where God told him not to run away
[2:34:55] no more no more we're not going to run
[2:34:57] away no
[2:34:58] more we're not going to allow the devil
[2:35:00] to chase us no more we're going to chase
[2:35:03] the
[2:35:05] devil and he said brandom brother
[2:35:08] brandom Don't Run
[2:35:10] Away speak to the
[2:35:14] storm why
[2:35:16] cry speak Hallelujah to the storm you
[2:35:20] see the devil knows that words control
[2:35:22] your day he will prize you to release
[2:35:26] the wrong words
[2:35:28] Hallelujah God don't care about me God
[2:35:31] don't love me and it's a
[2:35:34] lie but he will pressurize your life and
[2:35:38] put you under so much
[2:35:40] pressure for you to pronounce the wrong
[2:35:43] words and when you pronounce the wrong
[2:35:46] wrong words bad things will happen yeah
[2:35:49] because words control your day right try
[2:35:53] to remember the scriptures I like what
[2:35:55] Pastor sh years ago said he said he went
[2:35:57] through so much trials he couldn't even
[2:36:00] find the
[2:36:01] scripture he only had a song
[2:36:04] yes but put a lot of word inside of your
[2:36:08] spirit put a lot of songs inside of your
[2:36:11] spirit and the day when it comes and you
[2:36:13] don't know what to do yes that word
[2:36:16] that's deep in your soul will come out
[2:36:19] that song deep inside of Pastor s's
[2:36:22] Soul brought him out
[2:36:25] amen amen memorize the word of God spend
[2:36:29] time with the word of God whatever the
[2:36:32] devil attack release the word of God
[2:36:35] Jesus Jesus Jesus withstand the Devil
[2:36:38] with the word of your
[2:36:40] testimony and start testifying against
[2:36:43] him Hallelujah so good we have have a I
[2:36:47] will restore message
[2:36:50] right and in Jo he said all the
[2:36:55] years that the caterpillar the Palm home
[2:37:00] all the years that was destroyed in your
[2:37:03] life right in the bride's life amen God
[2:37:07] is getting ready to restore
[2:37:10] it do you believe that God can give your
[2:37:12] years
[2:37:14] back there's a song that says I'm going
[2:37:16] to go to the enemy's camp and I'm going
[2:37:19] to take back what he stole from me he's
[2:37:23] a
[2:37:24] liar take back what he stole from you
[2:37:26] Hallelujah listen that's why Joseph all
[2:37:29] the years that he was suffering he gave
[2:37:31] he his his one of his sons named is the
[2:37:34] meaning of one of his sons name is to
[2:37:36] forget for God to help him to forget his
[2:37:39] pain and his sufferings may God release
[2:37:42] an anointing for us to forget all the
[2:37:44] years that we suffered that the devil
[2:37:47] took away from us God is about to
[2:37:50] restore those years he's about to give
[2:37:55] back and Pastor sh preached about this I
[2:37:58] I studied those things those years about
[2:38:02] restoration but then you did a study on
[2:38:05] restitution and restoration where the
[2:38:08] devil have to give double back what he
[2:38:10] took away even Sevenfold back what he
[2:38:13] took away right but we not only talking
[2:38:16] about to restore we are talking about
[2:38:21] restor God is going to give back
[2:38:23] [Music]
[2:38:26] extra in a day's time you will forget
[2:38:28] all the sufferings you will forget your
[2:38:32] sufferings it will be easy for you to
[2:38:35] forgive like Joseph when his brothers
[2:38:37] came there he said I already forgave you
[2:38:40] two years ago when I took this message
