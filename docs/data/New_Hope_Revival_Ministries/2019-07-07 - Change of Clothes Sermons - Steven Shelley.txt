TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a man Genesis chapter 35 beginning in verse 1 if I should say something this morning that is true would you say Amen would you nod louder stomp your foot louder wag your finger a little more violently most of all engage your heart because the Lord has something he wants to say to us again today and I need his help to get it across I need his help to weed it down Whittle it down a little bit for the time that we have allotted to us this morning you pray that God will help us it's a good word when we get in the word we can easily get lost one place to another one scripture hangs on another scripture hang on another scripture the next thing you know you've just you've just about gone through it giver to giver right Genesis 35 1 and God said unto Jacob arise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of Esau thy brother then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem how many of you think that is something to look at this morning I believe it's what the Lord would have us to look at would you just bow your head for a moment Lord Jesus we thank you that your presence has been among us today we are not surprised you promised to come you're faithful to come thank you for the worship thank you Lord for a few minutes there it felt like celebration and we have so much to celebrate and so much to thank you for lord I thank you that you have also chosen our praise and our worship many times as warfare and when we move we're moving things in another dimension Lord when the anointing of the Spirit of the Lord falls on our heart we know and we move in response to what the Spirit is doing we know Lord that things are being shifted around in the second heaven oh how we desire to push away the darkness that permeates the second dimension the second heaven and so that we might like Jacob at Bethel be able to look right up and see the face of God we thank you for every person here and every person who has joined us by the way of streaming Lord speak to your people have your wonderful way as the word of truth goes forth and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of our Messiah Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said you may be seated I want you to be comfortable I want you to listen to this one more time God said unto Jacob arise go up to Bethel and dwell there and make V an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of Esau thy brother then Jacob said unto his household and all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you evidently in their journeying they had picked up some of the little idols that were made to false gods why would they do such a thing have you ever thought about why would they do such a thing do you think they got weary because they didn't feel like what they had was working and so they picked up something that somebody else had hoping that it would it would what causes a Christian to believe in luck what causes a Christian to believe in fate what causes a Christian to have the attitude that brother Greely mentioned not too long ago que sera sera whatever will be will be that's not the doctrine of the scripture concerning predestination that's not what predestination is well what would make a Christian participate in with a Ouija board or go to a fortune-teller or even follow their horoscope I know what brother Branham said about those signs being part of a Bible that was written in the heaven but I want you to know the people that write those things to go in the newspaper there they're not they're not astronomers they're they're wrapped up in the new age and they're riding things from a false perspective you can't trust your horoscope reading in the newspaper or online any more than you can your fortune cookie how many of you know you're not going to live your life based on the fortune cookie if you get a good one you're gonna celebrate it you're gonna say well oh I claim that that's different if you don't like it you're gonna do what Mall did one time she ate it to this day she has never told me I guess that ship has sailed and I will never know unless the Lord chose me but she got one one day that so offended her I said mother you must have read it wrong I have never seen a fortune cookie rebuked somebody or correct them or straighten it out you must have misunderstood and she ate it she didn't want it to be so I said don't you know what you eat becomes a part of you she said well how do we cancel that I don't know why Christians reach out for other things but I'm going to believe that perhaps it's because they don't feel like what they're doing is working and they're looking for something else the problem is when we do that we open ourselves up not just to the look or the charm that's supposed to come with some of these little things but we open ourselves up to every demon spirit that is a sign to follow that form of religion or that false worship so God's people have to be very very careful you you can make a false god out of anything that you adore it's not wrong to adore it's not wrong to have things that you love enjoy like want to participate in having a hobby is not wrong having a favorite author is not wrong as long as he's writing something that glorifies God that God is in the middle of but it's not witchcraft because you may think that it's innocent but I want you to know demons have been assigned to follow those things into people's lives too much to tell and I'm not preaching on the occult this morning but I want you to know Jacob was taking the people upward to Bethel and in order to do that the word of the Lord came and he said you got to tell these people put away the little strange gods that are among you and be clean be purify help me now am I telling the truth then let me hear I'm in a little bit be clean let the Lord cleanse you and when you get clean don't put back on your dirty clothes I'd like to preach this morning if I had a title I would call this a change of clothes if I had a subtitle I would call it be sure to change your underwear how many of you ever heard mama now I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that my mother and my mother's mother believed in leaving the house with clean underwear I don't know what's gonna happen one time my mother said you wouldn't want to be standing on the side of the road if you broke down with dirty underwear I said who would know but me I don't plan to lose my britches but she said no no no you anything could happen if you go to the hospital you don't want to have on dirty underwear well we don't have that problem in our house because we have two sons that change underwear multiple times every day and if you don't believe that just ask the poor woman who has to do the washing it would be foolish for you and I've to get a good shower and scrub up with some good soap get all the dirt off what we used to call what what did they used to call it when you would be playing outside and you get really dirty and you would sweat and it would make a little chain around your your neck like a knot on your collar but it'll do that or ring around the collar but they used to call that say it again something what kind of beads granny beads I never heard it called that but that's that's a good name for it you've seen that happen children get so dirty outside playing then the sweat you look like they have a necklace on so you scrub all that off you scrub everywhere that needs to be scrubbed and that's everywhere and when you're all scrubbed up you don't go over to the pile and pick up the same old dirty clothes and dirty underwear and the dirty clothes that you took off you don't put them back on because then you don't smell good anymore you smell like nobody knows you've taken a bath because you smell the same put away the strange gods that are among you be clean and change your clothes it's very important he went on to say and let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make Varon altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went they gave unto Jacob their strange gods which were in their hand and their earrings will need little water to get this one out mm-hmm and their earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem I was reading in one I think it was Wesley I'm thinking that it was John Wesley who said they ought not to have buried them under the tree they ought to burn them because when we lay down something strange and false it's too easy to get discouraged and go back and pick up the very thing that we laid down in that write how many of you think it's a good idea to burn your ploughs and ball your oxen so you don't have anything to lean on to go back to Amen I tell these ladies who get victory over britches I say get rid of them don't give them away don't put them on somebody else and make them step into perversion I'm just telling what the word saying it's it's a bending of genders look what we got we have adults not just children we have adults that don't know what they're supposed to be come on you know the the church didn't like that old-fashioned preaching back then they they began to compromise and they said it's just old-fashioned man they're chauvinist they're just coming against us they just don't want us to be free and now look what a spirit has taken over now because men and women dress the same wear their hair the same now they're all confused you say that didn't have anything to do with it oh yes it did because there was a spirit attached to that it was an assignment against the Church of the Living God and nobody wants to stand against it but thank God there were men who remained faithful to say what you don't know better maybe you've never heard you didn't know any better you've never come under any influence where anybody could point you to the word in the right direction well when you come into that kind of an atmosphere you can hear the truth you can be filled with the genuine Holy Ghost and the same spirit that convicted our mothers and grandmothers can convict you it's not what department you buy them in it's the spirit behind them and I'm not gonna preach on clothes today I am gonna preach on clothes but not in that way there's just no reason for it and these ear bobs and earrings Jacob said you can't carry them up to Bethel get rid of your idols and your earrings this is not the only time that they had to be I read where one Jewish commentator said well it wasn't the earring he's it was against it was where they got him well they doesn't tell me what store they bought him and it just tells me it was another adopted custom something that they picked up from those who worships range gods well I'm not gonna preach that today I'm just gonna introduce what I am gonna preach I am gonna preach we all need a change of clothes can I have a little more in the monitor we need a change of clothes and I am gonna preach be sure before you leave the house to change your underwear I am gonna preach on that because we need to make sure that we remain clean when when we're cleansed when God cleanses us amen what I want to emphasize in verse 2 is change your garments now garments our clothes in the Bible it's a metaphor for putting off the old and putting on the new clothing natural clothing the robes and and tunics and ephod Xand and things like that the Bible talks about clothing the clothing of the priests it's there's a whole lot set in the Bible about clothes but it's also used metaphorically as a covering for what is underneath the covering of our nakedness not only physical but spiritual or you are you still with me and it goes all the way through the Bible and I don't have time to read or preach the twenty pages that I have prepared for this sermon so I'm going to have to move quickly and in order to do that you're going to have to stay with me and also every now and again say lord help him to stay on on topic because there will be another time and if there's not another time for me somebody will come along and finish what needs to be said you're gonna have God's gonna make sure to get to all of us what we need he'll get it to us one way or the other he's always gonna have a man he'll bring the word to us I believe that Philippians 2 I want you to go there Philippians 2 verses five through eight it's gonna be on the screen but if you have your Bible look at it there it's a very familiar portion of Scripture you can relax because I'm gonna get off the physical clothes I'm gonna get on the metaphor because I want you to see it but keep in mind that what you wear is a reflection of who you are Philippians 2:5 you can relax now I think I'm done let this mine let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus let this mind be in you which was always in Christ Jesus now we will discover what mind was in him it goes on to say who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God this was what was in his mind go back for me this is what was in his mind who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God that was in our Lord's mind the next verse but made himself of no reputation we thank God for King James but there's a whole lot more to that phrase than King James gives us and took upon him the form of a servant though we were God though he knew that it was not robbery to say to feel that he was equal to God he made a choice this was his mind the Apostle is encouraging you and I to take and have the same mind the same thought process that we should also take upon ourselves the form of a servant that's what's being emphasized in these verses of Scripture and was made in the likeness of men thank God he was and being full and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself this is also a necessity it's a part of what we need to have in our mind that we would also humble ourselves and also he became obedient unto death we also have to become obedient unto death his death was the death of the cross your death was the death of the same cross how many of you know he died you were in him that day your sin was judged and you died the very same day this is what the New Testament teaches us and it doesn't just hint at it it's very very clear all right let's move forward changing clothing clothing and the changing of a person's garment it's often used in the scriptures as a metaphor for a much deeper truth than just the outward covering of our body it begins in the very beginning clothing can you can you imagine where I'm going it begins the first mention of a meaningful change of clothes takes place in Genesis the book of beginnings when Adam and Eve covered themselves with aprons of fig leaves when they realize they were naked in Genesis 3:7 this is the first time that there's any mention of putting on clothes to cover your nakedness it's in the beginning it's in the very beginning but God Himself came down and killed animals to make them coats of skin Genesis 3:21 we know as a as a Bible believing Bunch we know that that was a shadow of millions of lambs that would be killed in the tabernacle and the temple and it pointed toward the ultimate Lamb of God which was slain from the foundation of the world every bit of that death from from the first animals that were slain and their skin was removed as clothes to cover their nakedness and the Prophet said there they went out I can see them walking out of the garden with those bloody clothes those bloody skins flapping the back of their legs they would never be the same so clothing again something physical but it was also something metaphoric God was using the covering of the of the out the natural body as a metaphor for what it means to be covered to be protected to be behind something that will shield you from from judgment from wrath from whatever is about to break out I want you to know I don't know what's about to break out but the earth is shaking yeah they were arguing over whether a 6.4 was big and whether anyone should be concerned about a 6.4 and then they found out that's a foreshock it was not a it was not an earthquake that stands alone but a four-shot for a greater one that would happen the next day 7.1 I heard on Fox News this morning they were telling us that they're very prepared as prepared as you possibly can be for a third one as part of the same sequence of activity and thinking that it very possibly could be even larger than the seven point one we may find out he said in the next 24 to 48 hours that both of these earthquakes were four shots of something bigger notice neither of these on the San Andreas Fault but enough enough to shake people up you saw them like I did interviewed where they wouldn't go and sleep in their homes where even the elderly slept in their yard that whole night because they didn't want to go back in their house and have the thing collapse on top of them come on now the earth is shaking it's coming it's coming some I said is this the one is this the time I can tell you it's the time yes the time it may not be this week it may not be next week but living in the season where California is not only going into the ocean but if you listen carefully to what the Prophet said it actually slides like a plate back under what's left of North America now if that really slides back under that honeycomb that's underneath California I want you to know that it just goes all the way across it affects everything all the way across our continent I want to be ready I want to know I'm ready and I want to pray for people who are not ready I want to ask the Lord to speak to their hearts but it is getting us to be a serious time something like this the largest at 20 years and don't you don't you think for one minute that people don't think about it at least some may not take it serious but it's in their mind could this be did any of you see the the footage of the of the swimming pool that looked like the ocean the water sloshing all the way out of the swimming pool I want you to know it must be a terrifying thing when the earth is shaking like that underneath you I'm not going to argue with anybody about whether it's God's judgement or wrath or not but I will tell you that this nation has been indicted and God has said through his servant that judgment has struck the west coast starting in the late 60s all the way up to this time so we are in the time of that which has been prophesized you could say Amen or me in the scripture that we read about Jacob he was clear he told the people that in preparation to go up to the house of God putting away all the idols would be necessary but he also insisted that the people wash themselves and changed their clothes putting away even the clothes that had been symbolically defiled there may have been no real physical dirt on the clothes but those clothes had been symbolically defiled by the lies that they had accepted by the idols that they had held in their hand by the trinkets by the doodads that they had adopted that were from a people who had refused to follow the truth of God come on now so it's serious a change of heart would also have to take place among those that Jacob was talking to motives and intentions would need to be evaluated but this was a beginning a step in the right direction that even they even had to give up their their trinkets and their doodads that were esteemed by those who they had borrowed these strange gods from you you need to consider what the world goes after what the world is enticed by what the world is attracted by there could very likely be spirits involved that are out to affect you in a very negative way we got to take a bath we've got to change our clothes even if we look down and we don't see any soil we don't see any dirt maybe we are symbolically defiled by where we have walked and who we have eaten with and what we have participated in and what we have ran after things that we have put on our bodies books we have read videos we've watched things we've done a change of clothing was necessary for the people to move onward and to move upward then after the Exodus stay with me then after the Exodus the children of Israel leaving Egypt to go out into that Promised Land we find another portion of Scripture about the changing of clothes about the cleansing that needed to take place because the children of Israel were leaving slavery they were on their way to Mount Sinai High where there was going to be a marriage covenant made between God and the nation of Israel and there had to be some preparation and will wait on you there had to be some preparation made to get them into that holy moment a change of clothing was gonna be necessary exodus chapter 19 verse 10 through 14 i'm just going to read pieces of it when moses told the words of the people to to the lord the lord said to moses go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow and let them wash their garments and be ready for the third day for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people so moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people and they washed their garments now they were gonna get dirty again out in that wilderness but this was a physical act of washing their clothes that had a much deeper spiritual meaning there was something much bigger going on than just the washing of a physical robe but this was a consecrating a sanctifying it was something to draw the people's minds toward God and off of their past you see it's one thing to get the children of Israel out of Egypt amen but it's another thing to get Egypt out of the children of Israel my granny used to say you can take the girl out of the country but you can't get the country out of the girl I'm still a country girl at heart and in the spiritual it works that way you've got a slavery mentality you've got a fascination with what you saw the Egyptians fascinated with and so the children of Israel we all know they had to be not only did they have to clean their clothes wash their clothes so that this covenant could be made on Mount Sinai huh but we also know they all had to make a journey through the Red Sea which the New Testament tells us was a baptism it was a ritual cleansing even though the water didn't touch them it was a spiritual cleansing it wasn't it because they had to get some more of the residue of Egypt out of their lives may God help us to do the same they wash their garments and then we look at the priests and even the high priest in the Bible there are various changes of garment by both the priest for the priest and the high priest one example is found in Leviticus chapter 6 verses 9 through 11 just put that up there in case somebody would like to look at it and and even jot it down command Aaron and his son saying this is the law of the burnt offering it is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night under the morning and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it and the priest shall put on his linen garment and his linen breeches shellye put upon his flesh and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burn all offering on the altar and he shall put them beside the altar verse 11 and he shall put off his garments and put on other garments and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place is that what he says now he was already standing in holy garments not golden garments the golden garments were those ceremonial garments that were worn by the high priest with the breastplate with a with the beautiful gold mitre on his head he was rather standing in the in the garments of a priest in ministry one who was working serving and ministering before the Lord and even that had to be removed and he had to put on something else before he could carry the ashes without the camp there's a key but you say what's it to an unclean place he couldn't wear those consecrated garments to an unclean place he wasn't going to an unclean place he was going to a place that had been sanctified and consecrated as a place to receive the ashes but he was going to pass through a place he was going to pass through a place that was without the camp and so the word of the Lord was you got to change your clothes when you get out there and dump those ashes and I said well it was a dirty job you don't think what was going on before that was dirty he's ministering on the on the altar the fire he's already moving the ashes around inside it wasn't because it was physically a dirty job it was because there would be defilement and God said I want there to be a clear distinction between the garments for sacred duty and the garments for common duty even though it was still the work of the tabernacle it was still the work of the temple anybody with me brother Branham said when you come to the house of God you need to wear your best just tell me what he said it's not because your clothes earns you anything in the kingdom of God it's not because you you should be puffed up and how fashionable you can be and how good-looking you can be in your clothes but it's because this is a holy gathering he said you don't pull out the word you know if the best you've got is a clean pressed pair of overhauls then you ought to wear your overhauls and you are not to be ashamed to do it but he said when you come to the house of God you ought to wear the best you have and you're doing that in the same order the same order that the priest was told change your garments when you go outside the camp even into the holy place to dump the ashes so it's not wild of us or outlandish of us to say that we as a body of believers when we come to the house of the Lord we should take a moment to look the best we can I'm gonna say it again it won't hurt us to tuck our hair in place it won't hurt us if you've got any breeches that aren't holey wear your non holy ones no one is going to judge you by what you wear they last some time women will say can I come in my slacks we always tell them come however you feel comfortable you come how you feel comfortable we're going to depend on the Lord to take care of the rest but we're not going to be ashamed of what God has called us to so remember this there was a reason for it the changing of the garment to distinguish to differentiate between not the holy and the profane but the holy and the common will you help me when church becomes common when we treat church like it's the same as being at home then it's easy to see that kind of a person they're never on time they never stay till it's over they never act engaged they lay across the Pew instead of sitting up like they're in a place that requires their their attention come on now I'm just preaching when people don't see the difference not between I'm not talking about the profane and the holy I'm talking about the common and the holy see Christians know the difference between holy and profane but sometimes we forget the difference between holy and common remember brother Branham said this is not a place to do your talking with one another this is a set apart place oh I'm adamant notes it's a set apart place and do you remember brother green saying he he heard that and he wanted to be so careful about that and one day he just wanted to do anything that he could to be a blessing and he grabbed a broom from dock brother Brandon's brother and brother Green was just sweeping around the pews and he said I was trying to be so careful that I didn't even bump the broom it was empty the people had gone out but he said I so respected that place based on what brother Branham had said I didn't even want my broom to bump the end of the Pew and disturb the presence of the Lord that had just been moving in that room and he said imagine my surprise when brother Branham came out of his study and and hollered across the empty room and said hey brother Perry let's do breakfast in the morning over at so-and-so and he said I responded back to brother Branham and I said he said can't you hear me he said yes sir I was just trying we were in the sanctuary this was in his mind you see I like to remember that story because it's important that we don't become a legalistic about anything you know if somebody has a decision to make I have time to get to church but I don't have time to go home and clean the cotton out of my hair or the grease out from under my fingernails or to put on a nicer set of clothes I believe with all my heart that you would be more in line with what God wants for your life for you to come here as you are than to say I knew I wasn't dressed appropriately I knew I had dirt on me and I just couldn't come to church that's being legal either you're making an excuse for not being here or you're just being a little bit legal because we would rather you come as you are and enjoy the presence of the Lord and help us build up to something you're needed you're needed you may think it's only your offering this needed but your or you may feel that we feel that way but you are needed your spot needs you in it as often as possible and your voice is needed you're a man I don't need you're a man to tell me that I'm telling the truth I know I'm telling the truth because I've found it in God's Word I need your amen because I want you to be a part of the journey we're on a journey this morning we're like these children of Israel that Jacob was talking to we've got to go onward and we've got to go upward and in order to do that we've got to participate if the word of the Lord says bathe yourselves and change your clothes you don't need to look down and say well you know I don't see I don't think I I don't think I'm dirty I don't know what see anything wrong with these clothes what you need to do is go bathe yourself and change your clothes if that is the word of the Lord to us because we're moving as a body and we are on a journey I didn't I had no idea that this was going to take us in this direction this morning because this is not at all where I want to go I just got to get to where I want to go and I need you on the journey you know you may feel in your mind that you miss a few services you haven't missed very much but I want you to know we're on a journey and we're building line upon line and we're building precept upon precept because that's what the Word of God does and sometimes there's a piece in there one piece one little tiny Peace in a two-hour smorgasbord that we need to get a hold of in our life to take us somewhere else above what we're going through you know I'm preaching you know what I'm saying is right we need that and so take advantage when you can't be here take advantage of what's made available for you you if you weren't here last Sunday take a moment it's on your phone you you've got it free you don't have to login you don't have to put a password all you have to do just take a moment and see if there's anything about seed and harvest that you need to understand for where we are right now we're going to miss I'm going to miss you're going to miss there going to be times that we can't be here when I make my plans I plan as much as I possibly can to miss as little as I possibly can because I believe we're getting closer and closer and closer to the climax I also when I possibly can I try to go back I'm not always able to hear every sermon but I like to go back and hear what was said oh I bet you do so you can straighten them out there's really nothing to straighten out what I hear it's been has been such a blip for 34 years now what I have heard has been such a blessing and a big old amen and an exclamation point of truth that I love we're blessed you say Amen are on me I don't think anybody ought to say well I don't you know it was just just brother Greely preaching other or just hawk or just brother Kerry preaching I don't think I need to go back in I think you should I think if you have an opportunity if it's made available to you you should take advantage of that because there may be one little key my my my mind one little piece that you need for something that you're gonna face I don't make any apology for saying that it's just the truth it's just the truth and so understand that Christian people often know the difference between profane and holy where we get blurred is the difference between what is common and what is holy this is not the place to get your manicure this is God's house this isn't the place to check your email or check your facebook or post on Instagram that is common it's not necessarily profane but it's common there needs to be a separation a differentiation in our life between what is common and what is holy there are certain things you can do in a holy place that you can't do in a common place and maybe even vice versa and we need the Holy Ghost but sometimes he's there nudging us we get so used to it I really think it's a better idea if for for children to take their snacks out there I really think it's a better idea to do anything and everything we can do to teach them now and in fact most of the time they don't need a snack they just want one until we go into that third hour when we go into that third hour I need a snack so I understand when they do but there's a place now if you can just quietly stick something in their mouth and not make a disturbance and and that'll be it and you know that because you're the parent do it I don't want to be legal I'd rather you do that but if you see this is gonna be a food fest there's a place to do that come on now there's a common place to do common things and a holy place to do holy things and holy people can do common things in common places but holy people don't want to do common things in holy places all right I'm just giving you what the word said so we draw listen the high priest the Bible tells us that he changed his clothes once on the day of atonement but the the oral tradition is or if you read certain tractates of the Mishnah it tells us of 10 different washings some were whole-body immersions in a mikveh and several I think maybe three were just the washing of the hands and the feet but 10 times the Mishna says the high priest had to cleanse himself and change his garments five times in preparation for the day of atonement now this is you know extra I we don't have all of that outline for us in the scripture but that oral tradition that was passed on from generation to generation tells us that would wear somebody out but he was about to do something that he would only do one time a year he was about to enter into the most holy of holies and he was going in with the blood to sprinkle it on the mercy seat so that the sins of the entire nation could be covered for a whole year and he couldn't go in there defiled his life not only his life depended on it but the prosperity of the people the favor of God on the house depended on him going in making the right preparation to enter into that which is holy if you believe that same man so we draw from these scriptures the importance of making both spiritual and natural preparation that include a changing of our clothes as we are anticipating an entrance into the holy presence of God you got to leave it all I point back there that's the door I come in you gotta leave it all out there you tell me how to do it pastor and I will do it it's an act of your will it's a decision of your mind it is something that only you can do no one can do it for you it doesn't mean that it won't creep up again it doesn't mean that a thought won't try to get a hold of you while you're in here it doesn't mean that Satan won't whisper to you while you're trying to listen to the Word of God he will but we make a conscious decision we must to leave it all behind I'll stir every struggle every every burden every memory every everything that plagues us we do our best by the grace of God to leave it out there and to come in to worship God to hear the word of God to enter in well somebody is going to know that I'm really going through something and if they see me oh really will enter in and worshiping God they'll they'll think I'm putting on don't worry don't let anybody what you think they might think about your praise hinder you from praise I didn't let brother said - when you talked about the kangaroo anointing I didn't let that keep me from jumping cause that's how I feel sometime I can't hold it in any longer and I just feel a spring in my feet I mean it takes a lot to get me off the ground but but I can do it if I do it under the Lord I can dance if I do it under the Lord and I'm not only if your mind is on the Lord and you're getting ready to praise Him you don't have time to think about how somebody might perceive your praise give it all just give it all and there'll be nothing for anybody to say and then don't worry somebody will somebody will let that be on their hand don't let that be on your hands Zechariah 3 go there with me fleece for just a moment I have another hour that was the first one boy it went and quick Zechariah 3 verse 3 through 8 you know these stories I had a visitation in Jerusalem you know this these scriptures I meant to say I had a visitation very very similar to this in Jerusalem some years ago I think maybe I was sharing RJ was i sharing this experience the first time you were ever in a service where I was speaking I wasn't even scheduled to speak in that conference but I was there and I attended and was asked to speak and I shared about a visitation from Joshua the high priest because it's been so long since we mentioned it let's look at these verses again quickly now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold I have caused the iniquity to pass from thee and I will clothe thee with change of raiment and I said let them set a fair mitre which is a clean turban upon his head so they said a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the Lord stood by once his clothes had been changed symbolizing the removal of his iniquity God went on to say and the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua saying thus saith the Lord of Hosts if thou will walk in my ways if thou will keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shall also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by here now Oh Joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they men wonder that for behold I will bring forth my servant the branch here stood Joshua the high priest clothed in dirty garments in the presence of Almighty God how did he get there God brought him God brought him there God wanted him to see something that he was not able to see on his own I think Joshua would have looked at his clothes and he would have said well they may be a little wrinkled but they're all right but in the presence of God God said you're standing in filthy rags before me I want to remove your iniquity I want to take off those dirty clothes I want to give you a vessel garments to wear I want to put I want to make sure that you have a clean turban on your head because I'm inviting you to my council I'm inviting you I'm offering you free access you hear what that verse is saying I'm going to give you free access to move in and out of my courts but before you can have access to that holy place you're here now by invitation but if you want to be able to move in and out of this place you're going to have to allow this cleansing to take place and you're going to have to walk in my ways you're gonna have to keep my word you're gonna have to stand on the truth that I have revealed to you we know these verses we understand that it was residual dirt from the captivity just like it was residual dirt on the clothes of the children of Israel that had to be washed off that may not have been physically dirty but it was the residual of what it meant to be a slave it was the residual of what it meant to be over in captivity unable to worship God in the way that you were created to worship Him I want to go back with you for just a moment to the scripture that we read in Philippians but in order to do that I want to only read one verse verse seven in the amplified this was the scripture that we read that talked about who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation let me read this in the amplified because there's an interesting word that is used there that some of you are familiar with Philippians 2:7 in the amplified it says but he stripped himself this is Jesus this is our Savior he stripped himself of all privileges and rightful dignity so as to assume the guise of a servant a slave in that he became like men and was born a human being why are you reading that I'm reading that because Jesus received a change of clothes just like the priest just like Adam and Eve just like the children of Israel Jesus had a change of clothes he laid aside his royal robe of deity he laid aside his kingly robe he laid aside the glory here's what is very important to remember he laid aside the glory that he had shared with the father from before the beginning of the world the Bible tells us he laid all of that aside and he took on another set of clothes he stepped in to a set of clothes that was of this world come on he conducted himself no longer as the king of all kings but now he moved as a servant as a slave the word is kinaho are the act of canosa's whether Branham called it quino's and he would sometimes say he can oast himself he ke nos apostrophe D and the meaning was he emptied himself of the glory that he had once had with the Father now if you believe what I believe in many do not I believe that it was not just the glory that he emptied as he moved in his earthly ministry but I believe at the cross he gave up much of the rights much of the authority that he had had as the Word made flesh and I believe that he died as a man I believe that it was absolutely necessary I believe that of that that father that eternal spirit of the father that was with him was with him all the way to the cross even though he had already laid aside much of the glory that he had had with the father in the beginning but still the deity was there the very eternal spirit of the father was in him and there on the cross God can't die he couldn't die as a God how many of you understand that he could only die as someone who can die a man can die but God can't die and so the spirit of the Father I believe it was as though I almost ripped from him and he felt it how many of you know he responded father father why hast thou forsaken me let me tell you something dear he moves out of you you'll know you'll know that you've lost the touch this was much more than we could ever get our minds around this was all of God all of God living in one in one body of flesh all of God there might have been a rainbow somewhere there might have been a dove somewhere but all of God was living in that fleshly body that was God in flesh that was that was the Word of God made flesh and it was it was necessary that he take off the old robe and put on another one to be able to pay the price for you and I so it is not it is not unfair for him to ask you and I also to take off some old stuff so that we can be filled with some new stuff so that we can be clothed with a new reality with a new glory with the new identity or I thank God for the few of you that are with him in hearing me now I'm gonna say it that way thank God for those that can hear but I'm not quite done that word kinaho or kenosis the act of canosa's it means to empty to evacuate it means to make void to make of none effect it's translated in the New Testament to be in vain he emptied himself of the glory that he had with the father before the world was John 17 and 5 to take on a new robe a robe of humanity a robe that had a soul attached to it the eternal spirit of the Father did not exist with the soul until he stepped into that body of flesh that new robe that Jesus wore to pay the price for you and I had a soul attached to it which means it had a mind and a will and emotions now God has a mind and God we'll and God has emotion but they're all tied to the fullness of who he is but the soul that entered into that body connected to that body of flesh was one that was more connected to this earth than the soul that we would imagine being in the very image and likeness of God we know that because the scripture tells us of the struggle if he would have had God's soul if there would be such a thing a soul that was more connected to the eternal spirit of the father there would have been no struggle the body the body would have just immediately been pushed into submission but because his soul was attached to that earthly body that he put on that rope that he put on he set off if at all possible if I could step back just think of this if he could have stepped back into that other robe the Royal robe the Regal robe the robe of of God it would have been so much easier no struggle involved but because his soul was attached to his earthly form he cried out if at all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will tells us he had a will that was contrary to the will of the Father that was that soul life attached to that physical body so I want you to know the decision that he made we often have said through the years if Jesus would ever have been tempted to fail us to quit us he would have done it not on the cross because by the time he got to the cross he was fully surrendered it would have been in the garden it would have been against cemani it would have been in the Olive Press did when he prayed and Dilli sweat appeared his great drops of blood and and medical science tells us the emotion and the heaviness that was on his soul had such an effect on his physical body that literally capillaries all over his body were bursting beneath the strain of the emotion and the weight of my sin until instead of salty liquid likes pouring out of the top of my head it was perspiration mixed with the blood that was flowing out of those ruptured capillaries and by the time he was at the cross they believed that more than capillaries vessels were bursting and eventually arteries were giving up that could not stand the weight or the load or the strain from what was happening and I want you to know how would you have liked to have been the mind of the Father that day he's won but in that moment the father had a will in the body that that spirit lived in had a will right does that confuse you how would you have liked to have had to make that decision of what precise moment you would exit the body I wonder did he whisper on his way out I don't want to leave like this but it must be I don't know all I know is that when that when that void that he had never felt before when that void happened he was ready to get it over with as fast as it possibly could this has got to end it is finished think of that it's not a Baptist sunday-school story it's what makes you a new creature it's what gives you a new identity it's what gives us hope that this life is not end and so if the word of the Lord should come to us sanctify yourselves wash your clothes change your garment it's he's not asking us the Spirit of God it's not bidding us to do anything but Jesus what's not required to do he had to change robes now his his former robe was more glorious than his earthly robe but nevertheless he had to make the change didn't he are you are you good for a few more moments good because I have to finish a little more will you turn to mark chapter 10 verse 46 they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of Timaeus sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace god bless these many who wanted to restore the order but he cried out the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and I want you to know these are powerful words if I was an evangelist I would preach an hour on these next four verses and Jesus stood still I don't think it's very often that he stands still he's always moving and working and carrying out a plan in our lives and for us but in his physical form he heard the cry everyone crying everyone trying to get his attention may God give you ears to hear just a moment may just strengthen you as you're weary and sit there so tired Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me it's the first time we have in recorded scripture where Jesus was called publicly by someone else a son thou son of David identifying him to be the one who would sit on David's throne he was saying more than Jesus who who descends from David he was saying you're the one who sits on an eternal throne you are the Messiah you're the savior of Israel by calling him the son of David have mercy on me and Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto Him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee are these the same ones are these the same fellows that told him Shh behave yourself don't you take for one minute that I am saying there doesn't need to be a form of order but his need his desperation forced him to cry out in a non orderly fashion have you ever been there you may never been there but you may be there before this life is over that you don't have time to think about protocol or our man's expectation you know that in this moment his spirit is passing this way and you cannot afford to hold your peace you feel like I must catch his attention he calleth thee be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he you know this verse he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus this is so precious that word that was chosen there the translators chose to translate it rose because of the context but that word doesn't just mean he got up he was once sitting down and now they've called him and he gets up no no that word is much bigger than that it's actually a word that that means it's it's from the root of a word that we have talked about before and a stasis and Anastasis is a form of Resurrection and and so the writer chose when he was writing the story to say more than Bartimaeus got up because the Lord was calling him he actually was saying and there bartimaeus 'as Resurrection began he cried out Jesus thou son of David have mercy Jesus said bring him to me and they said come Bartimaeus you gotta go and the rider said and there bartimaeus his resurrection began hallelujah how many of you believe it was a symbolic resurrection for bartimaeus the life that he had lived presumably from his birth would never be lived the same way again everything was not about to change everything had already changed the moment he cried out come on the hell he rose casting away Apple below apple below it means to throw something away to throw something aside it comes from a root word below and the word below is an object to be thrown and this is where we get our word ball he was in haste he desired to disengage to separate himself from every impediment from every hindrance he wanted to step toward Jesus the way that up Apollo is used and the grammar that surrounds it and I have to struggle depend on others to get it the way the grammar is used in the sentence around Apollo it tells us that this wasn't not only a resurrection but the casting off of the garment was a symbol it was a message that he was sending that he was finished through with his old life you don't have to save me a seat this has been my spot for all these years I've said right there all of these years and if you hear brother Branham preaching and he's preaching from from what is the book prince of the house of David brother Branham is preaching from the Prince of the house of David when he talks about Bartimaeus in his little his little sign lamb is little lamb that led him around like a dog he's taking that story from the Prince of the house of David and so if you've got that in your mind you hear brother Ram preaching that you see him there maybe in your mind you'll see the little lamb there I do see the little am sitting there he had had that same spot it was reserved for him nobody took it he he was a permanent fixture there but there's something about the way this was worded in the Greek that it lets us know that he got up with such a determination and such such a demeanor that everyone knew there he was saying don't worry about holding my spot I'll never need to come and sit there ever again I am through with my old life and I'm getting ready for a new life in Jesus Christ he discarded his outer coat that loose outer robe which covered his tunic in order to beg during the times of Jesus you had to get permission from the authorities the right to beg publicly required a person to present himself to the authorities he had to provide documented proof of his or her disability if the evidence satisfied the requirements of the counsel permission would be granted to that individual to beg on the public streets of a city a beggar was required then to wear a distinguishable garment or tunic or cloak rather cloak over the tunic that served a number of persons purposes first the cloak would distinguish an individual from all other professions and Stations of life it also served to validate the legitimacy of one's handicap and to assure that he or she was unable to make a living any other way in the time of Jesus you didn't have to be afraid of someone of doing it for a profession because they were lazy if you saw a beggar sitting on the street he was identified by the cloak that went over his tunic s-1 having permission to be there and you could trust that his need was genuine and that it was legitimate it served as sort of a license to assure that lazy people would not take up the vocation of begging and impose on the needs of those who were truly in need some if some historians have even reported that these tunics were issued by the government instead of giving a paper license which we would have emailed to us today some historians have said especially in certain regions the government the council would give a cloak to the beggar and that it would be of a certain style in a certain color that served to identify that person both as unapproved bigger and to identify the nature of his handicap how many of you have heard we've heard this we've expressed this before many others have these cloaks were every bit as distinctive and easy to identify by the common citizen on the street as the linen garments that the priests wore and they walked to the street you knew who they were because of the garments they were wearing when you saw the beggar on the street you not only knew that he was licensed to beg but you knew what his handicap was maybe it was obvious to tell if someone was blind but there were other handicaps that were were permitted to beg and so it was important a color a style a sash something distinguished the legitimacy of the beggar and the handicapped so when Bartimaeus rose when he got up when he cast aside his cloak when he decided to lay down a garment that he had wore a garment that had become his identity he did it not in a way I gotta move freer I gotta I gotta be able to move so let me get this old heavy coat off for me oh no he wasn't lightening his load in the natural he was lightening his load in the spiritual I'm gonna get rid of this thing he did that based on faith that he already possessed a faith that had been fueled by the testimonies that he had heard of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ you're still here so bartemaeus was making a bold declaration in a few moments I'll no longer need this tattered and worn old cloak I'm no longer a beggar I'm a true believer he had no desire no desire to be identified any longer that's what he had been how easy it is for us to trust to depend on what we have been and the Lord is calling us why don't you why don't you rise why don't you have a resurrection not just stand up why don't you get up out of your grave come on the rut that you've fallen into why don't you get up out of that rut and come to me and when you come don't bring your costume don't bring your blind man's cloak don't bring your beggar's license trust look at the faith it took look at the trust it took he was giving up his spot he was giving up his income what was he gonna do what kind of job would he have anything he wanted to do he can see now well not yet but in just a few moments he had no doubt it was about to be alright if you live in the land of what if it don't happen hear me if you dwell in the land of what if it don't happen you'll always be a beggar you'll always be dressed in your handicap oh my could I tell you what I could help a preacher that would preach this to me you'll always be hung up in your handicap if you use to hear the voice of Resurrection no shame no shame you did you did exactly what you could do for as long as you could do bartimaeus did exactly what he could do nobody shaming him for his begging nobody is shaming him for the handicap that he had or the position and station of life had put him in but now he has an opportunity to rise and he rose casting away his garment and he came to Jesus if you got something to cast have you got have you got a clock that you need to lay off I do come on have you got something you need to trade Jesus is in the trading business I tell you the best thing I ever did do when I took off they are old and put on the new help me be all robust dirty all tattered and torn and when we used to sing it with the children they'd hold their note the old robe was dirty or tattered and torn the new robe was spotless and had never been warned I tell you the best thing I ever to do when I take off the old robe when I put on the new how many of you know that's just the truth I believe the word the spirit couldn't be talking to me you were exactly who he's talking to because every one of us have clothed ourselves we have covered ourselves in something it has become our security it's like a blankie it's the adult version of a posse a binky it's what we have done to protect ourselves [Music] because we have been hurt you must understand brother-sister there's not a person in this room or on this stream that hasn't been mortally wounded and some of it way before we ever came to Jesus but you and I have recognized for years the deepest wounds that we have taken the hardest knocks and hits that we have known and the worst kind of hurt in the world is that which we receive in the household of our friends the betrayals that we have experienced and sometimes perceived have weighted us down I'm not sure what we're waiting on many times the altars are open many times you're invited to come forward that is your moment that is your opportunity to take off another layer some of us have found identity in so many different things because of the way our minds work we have moved from one thing to another so quickly that we have layers of beggar's coats layers of defiled garments and so we we come into the presence of the Lord desiring to grab them all at one time and jerk them all off but sometimes we take them off it just seems to be the way it happens a layer by layer by layer by layer but don't you know God sees your heart don't you know he sees your desire to make something right with him to be free how many of you know who matthew henry was he wrote a commentary of the Bible sometimes it's strong opinion with no real basis that's what a commentary is so if you find a favorite one that doesn't necessarily mean that commentator got every verse right thank God for a message but Matthew Henry wrote this and I found it and I thought it was good he said those who would come to Jesus must cast away the garment of their own sufficiency and must free themselves from every weight and from the sin that like long heavy garments most easily beset s-- them and he refers to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and here it is in the amplified therefore then and I'm going to close NOT ever getting to what I wanted to give you but it's my fault not yours my introduction was six pages Hebrews 12:1 therefore then since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us why don't you read it deftly and cleverly clings to could it be clearer look this way please could it be clearer than that verse maybe I could have just read that verse and we could have been done now and a half ago because that sums it up you say I I thought I did that when I got saved you certainly traded an old man oh I am a new creature in Christ I'm a new creation in Christ old things somebody say old things have passed away behold all things have become new that's when you're born again to be born again means to be born from above how many of you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you've been born from above amen I know I have I know that I've been born from above but as we journey you got to know it as we journey we pass through places that we have never been before you listening we carry discouragements and hopes deferred and and all the things dreams unfulfilled visions unrealized healings that have not quite manifests it and we pass through strange lands where we've never been before and we pick up things we just pick up things because it's true that people I'm almost done it's true that people need something to hold in their hands we're just kind of made that way and they pick up things they say pretty things I want you to know when I first started doing missionary work and when I say missionary work I don't mean missionary work I mean when I first started going to the nations I've never been a missionary I've never gone and lived in a foreign land I've gone in and tried to be an encouragement and come home so I don't want you to think that I think I've done a great missionary work I hope I can encourage somebody along the way I got my email this week we are eagerly preparing your arrival for Christmas convention this year as per our perpetual invitation last December maybe we said something to encourage those folks but when I first started traveling at places like that you all know I love trinkets and knickknacks and things like that pick up rocks and me and Casey Hannah we could be good buddies because she loves to go get those painted rocks and I like things like that she ought to show me take me sometimes show me where to get him and I would just pick up something in every country because we didn't understand that many many many times their spirits attached they were they they they represent things that we don't understand their culture is different than our culture the worst that it ever happened to me brother Greeley knows this God has sent him multiple times to India he sent me once and I know he sent me because I was greatly opposed in getting there multiple people prophesied to me that I shouldn't go and the Lord kept telling me that I must go but I was told specifically they took me out for a day of luncheon shopping and I was told specifically don't take anything from this place leave it all here and I knew for me for that trip an assignment had been sent against me I would be attracted to something that someone had attached something to in the realm of the Spirit I don't believe in all that well I'll tell you something you don't have to but I'm gonna hear him cuz I've made some big mistakes I burned I've had to do some burning I've had to do some burying I've had to do some casting aside me have more to do I want to hear his voice come on now and so I've had to learn that there are times when we pass through something and we feel a need to have something in our hand we better be careful what we pick up because what we innocently take in our take on board to occupy our hand in mind can be an assignment of the enemy against us to weigh us down to make us heavy so that we accept our present condition as our final condition you better tell the devil you who listen to me now we started coming down here a lot earlier you better tell the devil now that your condition in this moment is not your future condition how you feel right now it's not how you plan to feel the rest of your journey it doesn't matter how much you want to help somebody somebody's got to want to help themselves and here's the problem some people want to re create re reinvent the wheel God has a provided way croute it says provided way cry out if you have the if you have the pleasure of lots of time and nothing pressing you then go find your closet spend a month in a cave sorting it out with the Lord but if you're like me and you don't have the pleasure of having as many years before you as you do behind you you may not have the luxury of a cave you may not have the privilege of a quiet private deliverance you may have to be like bartimaeus I may have to be like Barnum AJ's come on thou son of David have mercy on me desperation requires when we're driven by a passion and the desperation to be different than we are at the moment sometimes we we break out of order we when I say order I mean the order we've established for our own demeanors you know if people say I'm such a quiet I'm not very emotional you know I just have to protect listen let me tell you something you better throw that robe off you know what my message was today I preached all of that to get you to something that I don't have time to talk about now and I promise you I won't but I was going I was gonna preach on David because he had to lay some stuff aside to get free he had done it wrong and he couldn't afford to do it wrong again he messed up he found a new improved way it cost him something didn't he couldn't afford to make the same mistake so he said this time I'm gonna go above and beyond I'm gonna do more than I think he would want me to do ever six steps we're gonna stop and get this right come on God is so good to us let's have the musicians to come I'm gonna stop can't even say I can't even sing the song I was gonna sing at the end cuz they're gonna sing a song about David we didn't preach about David I don't know one about bartimaeus except when Jesus came the tempters power was broken when Jesus came all fear was wiped he took the gloom and gave of glory all things were changed when Jesus comes to stay and in that which I don't know and I'm not going to sing is a verse about bartimaeus and I can hear Lester roll-off singing blind Bartimaeus set by the wayside begging his life was one limit one one he was locked in to one life and then Jesus came walking by and he decided it's all or nothing there's nothing to come back to I'm giving up my spot and I'm giving up my license and I'm giving up my blind man's coat and I'm gonna launch out and I'm gonna believe and it was it was worth the risk because Jesus touched him can you give us those verses can you find it without me going back up it was it was it mark 10 we didn't read the last verses I can get get them we don't want to leave him blind we don't want to leave him blind Matt mark 10 and let's look and he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus and jesus answered and said unto him watch well that I should do unto thee the blind man said unto Him Lord that I might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made the whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way in that wonderful does that build your faith at all he put it all on the line let's stand together when Jesus comes the tempters power is broken [Music]
