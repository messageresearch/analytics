TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I tell you getting in the presence of the Lord will energize you it will satisfy you but most importantly it will change you now the Cherub beam stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner Court which is the holy place then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub as soon as I was saying that I was carried momentarily in my mind so that I could hear Brother brandom telling in the tent Vision how that glory of the Lord went and left the platform and hung over that little room he called it we now know that it wasn't a little room but it was a t within a tent it was a small little structure there a stretch of canvas one time he called it a tent within a tent and the Lord said in that Vision just like he did in the scripture I will meet you in there that little tent represents a bridal chamber a nupal chamber a hoopa if you will a place where bridegroom and bride come together and they are no longer individuals and in that little holy place where the presence of God is to us it's like the holy of holies it's in there where we are most changed from glory to glory how many of you want to spend some time in there in the Holy presence in the cavod in the glory of the Lord in the bridal chamber God put those holy Cherry beams plac them at the going end of the garden and the Bible simply says we like to say they were there to keep Adam and Eve out that's not what the Bible says the Bible says they were placed there to guard the way they were place there to guard the way to the tree of life it does doesn't mean that no man will ever be allowed to get to the tree how many of you are glad you found your way but it means that it won't be just a happen stance or some halfhazard approach if you make it all the way to the tree of life and you receive the life of Jesus Christ into the innermost part of your being you're going to have to pass by the Cherub beams to get there so we know that the Cherub beams though they are Heavenly Creatures created to worship God and they are comparable even to the four living creatures that we read about in The Book of the Revelation they are directly somehow connected to the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ and so if cherubim's worship this bride is going to have to find her way into to the spirit of worship they're going to have to praise until the spirit of worship comes the anointing to worship comes and then worship until the glory comes and when the glory comes you stand under and in the glory because you want it to have its maximum effect in your life remember what he told us about that little room on the inside he said they'll go in one way and come out another way when God allowed me to revisit that place in the spirit he showed me that very thing happening people going in with their problems with their Hang-Ups not just physical deformity but also inward infirmity inner healing needed but when they came out the other side they had lost all of their intimidation ations they had lost all of their Hang-Ups and their warts and all the problems that they had had their inferiority complexes listen if you can get in the glory of the Lord and stay there long enough you'll lose all of your complexes you spend enough time in the glory of the Lord you'll lose your complexes I can't see a promise for the church to live in his presence but I can see a promise that the bride as she's changed from glory to glory will be able to live live in his presence
