love his love that has redeemed us his love that is keeping us lord how we thank you for your great love today thank you for allowing us to come and worship your name and even though lord we're just a few here today streaming only to our congregation wherever they may be lord your presence is here your anointing is with us and we want to glorify you and thank you for it we want to thank you that we have discovered by revelation that you love us and that your love conquers every situation in our life your love redeems us back through grace through your blood all the way back to your original thoughts of us and we want to just magnify your name hallelujah it's not such a miracle that i would love you lord you're so wonderful and worthy but the miracle is that you would love me how i thank you for it how about we sing that again altogether come on [Music] oh how he loves us [Music] again yes [Music] oh how he loves us yes he does one more time yeah he loves us oh loves thank god he [Music] loves yes he does i'm gonna give him a handclap of praise today i want to worship him and let him know how grateful we are for his love for us we didn't always deserve his love but that's the wonderful thing about his love it's not about our conditions it's not about our positions it's about his great merciful all-encompassing love for you and i you know there are those of us who have experienced things in life that have caused us to doubt that people love us you know someone will say i love you you just smile and wonder do they really and would they be there if i was really in need but i want you to know there's a love that is so profound and so all reaching that it overcomes mine and your insecurities and it causes us to come to a place of trust where we can know hey i am loved on my good days he loves me on my bad days he still loves me and on my in between days maybe i have more of those than you do but he still loves me that's his great grace we want to go to the lord in prayer we want to welcome you to our sunday morning service wherever you may be watching i see wonderful friends are joining us from south africa joining us from lusaka in zambia and joining us from british columbia oklahoma i see my friends the walkers in florida and just so many others too many to really be able to see the comments but i'm just so thankful that you are with us and you're either watching us on youtube or on facebook or you are watching us through our app let me just say here since we're doing a stream only service if you do not have the new hope revival ministries app on your ipad or your smartphone or your tablet whatever you have why don't you download that because it is a great resource it's absolutely free of charge and there is a host of things available to you on the app that will be a great blessing to you even people have allowed us to put their music on there cds that would normally be purchased are there for you to have free of charge a lot of great preaching by brother branham a lot of great preaching and teaching and testimonies by my great friend brother perry greene and our local services are on as well as some of the things we do in our other media outreaches so i'm i'm not embarrassed that i take a little time to invite you to do that also if you would subscribe to the youtube channel if you would follow our facebook page this is the world we're living in today and this is how people keep up with one another i have probably 12 full-size um filing cabinets down there at the office filled with letters and postcards and correspondence that came by what we now call snail mail and you know it's rare today to get a letter at the mailbox it's rare and uh because all the correspondence and you you may like it you may not like it you may be for it you may be against it but it's the reality of how we stay in touch with one another and many years ago the lord dealt with us here at our church about making our services available to those who were standing with us and we did it through telephone hookup and we had a whole row of telephone lines and old telephones old-fashioned telephones and these little switch boxes that brother wallace created for us and brother williams created for us and we would call the different ones or they would call us and we would put them on hold and when we flipped that switch everything that was going on in the service was then piped through the telephone lines and there would be times that 30 40 50 people would be gathered on the other end of that telephone line not able to see a thing but only able to hear i want to say thank you lord for technology i know the enemy likes to hijack everything and use it for his glory but i want to tell you it's being used for the glory of the lord jesus christ today and i want to thank him for it and i want to thank you for being connected to us yes we are stream only another week for sure we uh went that way a tuesday night was a week ago when we had a spike in the coronavirus variant among us and there are very few homes that were not touched by this last outbreak but i want to give the glory and the honor to the lord jesus christ i want to thank him for his mercy for his healing power for his strength and i want to report to you today yes there are still some at home who are struggling to get through they are still fevering after over a week and uh with all kinds of symptoms that range from back pain to nausea to congestion all kinds of things but i want you to know that day by day god is bringing them through he's bringing us through because we feel this in our whole in the whole body we're a part of the body i want to thank god for his strength that i would be able to come and continue to minister to you that's his grace and i want to let him know how much i appreciate him for that we recognize that you may not be a part of our local congregation and you may be going through the virus where you are your family members i saw where sister lasseter was thanking us for praying for her granddaughter and family the lord has mightily touched them and brought them through and we're giving god praise for that you may still be in the midst of your battle and we're going to stand in agreement with you today and believe that god is going to see you through for his glory and it doesn't have to be the end it can actually be a time of transition for you if if i i don't know how many times i haven't stopped to count the times if the holy spirit has spoken in my inner being maybe some of you won't understand that language but many of you will he has spoken in my inner being in my inner spirit and he has said there is a reason in this season and so when god makes that real to you is as hard as it is to know that some people are really going through such a struggle you just have to say god i trust you i trust you and i believe that you are working even in the midst of sickness even in the midst of sorrow you are working all things for our good and ultimately to your glory so we want to give him the praise brother robert graves let us know today that a another co-worker of his working on a different shift i think lost his wife this week to covet we want to remember that family to the lord in prayer there was a prayer request that was sent him this morning for a family over across the river in columbus georgia grieving the accidental loss of their fifth grader just a precious little girl who had an accident in their home and was uh fighting for her life and she stepped over sometime through the night and that's a family that's in shock not only grief but shock and i'd like for you to lift up the williams family to the lord that god would just touch them i don't think there's anybody but especially a parent that can't feel that that that you know it's like a blow when you hear that someone has lost their child we know that some of you have other needs physical needs not related to the virus some of you are burdened for your families and you want the lord to move i know you do well i want to tell you he's able he is more than able he is abundantly able and we want to join with you in prayer i don't know if you are putting excuse me i don't know if you're putting your uh prayer request on here yet or not but uh if you will then we will go back and we will pray over those requests calling each one by name you know it's my joy to do it because i believe that prayer is sometimes we say well all i know to do is pray you know like prayer is not enough well i want you to know that prayer for one another is the best gift it's the greatest blessing that you could give to somebody else is to sincerely pray not just send your praying hands and then not do it but if you will sincerely pray one for another that god will move you don't even have to know the need but you just go in faith believing god and calling someone's name in prayer i've been keeping prayer lists for over 30 years close probably 40 years and sometimes i have certain lists that i pull out on certain days of the week and sometimes i pray over the whole prayer book and some days i call every name in that book and i say at the end of that name and their families because i know that prayer works i know there's power in prayer so we want to go to the lord in prayer but before we do let's sing that little course he is able abundantly able not not the slower one but he is able abundantly able to deliver to deliver hallelujah he is a ball abundantly able to deliver to deliver he is able abundantly able to deliver those who trust in him he is able abundantly able to deliver to deliver he is able abundantly able to deliver those who trust in him sing it with me now he is able abundantly able hallelujah to deliver to deliver him abundantly able to deliver those one more time oh he is able abundantly able to deliver to deliver he is able abundantly able to deliver those who trust in him yes he is yes he is not only able but abundantly able to deliver let's go to the lord in prayer father we thank you lord that you have made a way for us to come to you and lay our burdens you not only told us to cast our burdens on you but you made a way for us to do it in prayer and by faith today we roll every burden every concern every need every worry every trouble we roll it off onto your great big capable shoulders and we say we trust you lord to save to heal and to deliver we pray for families that are grieving great losses lord would you undertake for them would you wrap your loving arms around them and whisper your grace and love and mercy remind them that if that loved one has made a real commitment to you that this is not really the end that death is a doorway and we will be reunited one day again we believe it lord we lift up those who are still fighting this virus we know it's nothing to play with we know that it's affecting different people in different ways but we know god you're above it and you stay on top of it and there is no virus or variation of a virus that can stand before your healing power i have just so hoped and prayed and believed that this weekend would mark a turning point in our local congregation that we would see those who have struggled along with their symptoms not able to get complete victory we are believing lord that you by the holy ghost will bring a shift to their bodies and that their immune systems will rise up in the name of the lord jesus christ and begin pushing every bit of this a trespassing spirit out of their body and give them victory today i pray in the wonderful name of the lord jesus i lift up those right now that are turning their prayer requests in we pray for amanda townsend a loved one of great friends of ours for many years just up the road in north alabama who's fighting and if i remember just right she has small children or young children lord you know her and you know her condition today and all we need is for you the great physician to walk into that room lord we lift up our brother soriano in the philippines that we have known for many many years who is battling can't even get into the intensive care because there's no room for him and he has been a pioneer and a faithful servant of the lord for many many years would you reach down today and bring him through this with a testimony that you are the same yesterday and today and forever lord we just lay everything all the unspoken requests how our hearts are really missing the bride the body that you have called to worship here we're missing them today it looks a little more empty than it did last week because we so miss the fellowship the smile we just miss seeing one another but lord we know all things are in your hands we know this room is filled with the heavenly host and we know that somehow faith is going to be transmitted from this place somebody's going to reach out and touch you and receive the turning point for their body for their life for their family in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah we pray and we call it done according to your word in the wonderful name of the lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he is wonderful and he is worthy to be praised he's worthy to be praised sing just a little bit of this with me he was wounded for our transgressions just sing a little of it i think we sung it tuesday night as we were leaving the service but let's sing it again he was wounded for our transgressions [Music] and he was bruised for our neighbor what he's oh surely he bore our sorrow and by his stripes we are healed hallelujah [Music] came the leper to christ saying surely i know that thou lord thou canst make me whole and when his great faith was seen jesus said yes yes i will and he touched him and he made [Music] him whole help me sing with you he was wounded he was bruised for our research he bore and surely he bore our sorrow and by and by his stripes we are healed just one more verse listen at these lovely words price for healing was paid as those cruel stripes were laid within pie let's just [Music] perfect healing for all oh this healer is mine today [Music] would you sing it out to him he was wounded for our transgressions [Music] all of them he was bruised for our relay quaters surely he bore and surely surely he bore our sorrow and by his stripes we are healed i believe we are hallelujah i believe we are amen let me just mention before the musicians go down let me just mention that we have some birthdays in our church community and in my family this week and i want to mention them because we make it a matter as a family of god to pray for that person particularly on their birthday we might not ought to wait only till their birthday to pray for them but it's a good idea to make a little extra effort to pray for them and remember when you see that it's their birthday may it just jog your memory and cause you to spend some time asking the lord to help them sister kathy thibodeaux in our church is having a birthday this week on thursday and we want to say to her happy birthday she is coming through by the grace of god he is helping her and she is testifying of the lord's help in her body and we want to thank god for that and we just pray i pray that by the time thursday comes around you feel wonderful i know that god is able to do that and then on friday our baby girl who's not a baby anymore has a birthday she's momo to a lot of people she's mariah destiny to us and we are so thankful for her she brings a lot of joy into our lives she brings some challenges as well but uh it's all in good fun she is uh a real organizer and she's a real baker and she's responsible for making a whole lot of sourdough bread i saw ten loaves on the uh dining room table yesterday that she had made so it's hard for stacy and i to believe that our baby is 15 but she will be on friday and then our oldest son who was leading worship today benjamin judah will be 23 is that right it's hard to believe that he will be 23 years old so we want to wish mariah sister kathy and benjamin judah a happy birthday and also on saturday which is the 21st it's also joseph hawkson's birthday and we want to wish him a very happy birthday he's uh had a little bit of sickness but uh by the next day he was already playing outside so we want to thank god for giving him victory and he's a real helper around here and we just want to say happy birthday to brother joseph hawkson brother hawkins sister mary beth's oldest child who's quickly growing up and also to brother paul drown we want to say how much we love you brother you're a great encouragement to us and we want to wish you a happy birthday on saturday would you just show your appreciation even though they can't hear you and could we just clap for these musicians it was so good to have them here today and we got a good surprise when joshua yantis was here to play the guitar and he was one of the first to go through and he had a rough time there a day or two but god was really good to him he is back to work now and well we didn't reach out to the musicians we just we just even though all of them should just about be done we just left it with them and i was so excited and happy to see that uh that uh josh had come today to play the guitar for us it helps a lot and sister laurel was here to play the piano and mirabeth was taking a day of a break there because everyone in sister laurel's home is out of quarantine now and doing well by the grace of god so it was nice to have her playing today as well we want to thank you for giving uh there are ways for you to give even though you are our local congregation is not able to come and worship physically just yet uh there are those who are dropping off their tithe and offering that's a great blessing because then we're able to keep up with all of our responsibilities without a lag and we want to thank you for that thank you for your faithfulness to help us you can also give by the app and some of our people do all their giving on the app or visit the website you can give that way you can even mail an offering in and we just say this goes primarily to our local congregation but if the lord should lay on your heart to send something to help us do what we do it's costly we're out in the country and we pay over a thousand dollars a month to be able to have a right at that amount to be able to have the connections that we need to be able to get out to you this way and so anything you would want to do to help it's appreciated but your prayers is what we would appreciate above all let me say to the local congregation all of your giving toward the principle we had a mandate that we would start knocking down all the debt and it was overwhelming amount when we started but we're getting uh we're getting to where we can see that god is going to help us do that the lord was speaking to brother greeley that if we would make a concentrated effort to knock that off to get rid of it to start working it out until we could pay it off and be done with it that we would begin to see some other things activated and i believe that so just let me announce to the local body that uh since march this is 8 15 21 today and since the first sunday of march you have given 126 642.48 and i want to give god the glory and i want to thank you for being a help to us i saw where someone this morning one of our streamers really part of our new hope family i saw where they uh put in a nice offering for the principal and uh they said it was compliments of mr biden and i knew exactly what that was about it was a family who had gotten the child tax credit and they had dedicated all of that to help us with that principle i appreciate that and i got a good chuckle out of it too might as well invest it in the kingdom and watch god pay the dividend and he does we want to turn this morning to romans chapter one we want to read in verse three and four this is where we started uh last week and then we're going to move a whole lot farther than that i'm just making a quick check here again thank you every one of you who are joining us live on all of the different platforms that we have we appreciate your support we appreciate your amens your virtual amens are welcome they're encouraging to us and we appreciate you being in touch with us that way and romans chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead for those of you who have been studying with us for the past weeks couple of months i would say now we are studying seven different offices of the holy ghost and these are all mentioned by name and we are on number four now we talked about the spirit of life we talked about the spirit of truth and we talked about the spirit of adoption and last sunday we started on the spirit of holiness and then we will go to the spirit of grace the spirit of supplication and the spirit of glory all seven of these mentioned in the scripture and it's been a good study and we are talking about again today the spirit of holiness and what holiness is i just want to re sort of recover some of our notes for just a moment before we move into another scripture holiness is not about religion it's not merely about a set of rules holiness is about relationship our god and creator long to have fellowship with his own created ones that you and i as our relationship grows with the father into maturity by the spirit of adoption which we covered it brings us in to a deeper revelation to a higher realization of just how holy our father god is true holiness is a result of the holy ghost changing our hearts and minds until holy living becomes a way of life for us we believe that holiness in lifestyle is an overflow of what the spirit of holiness is accomplishing in the life of the believer personal holiness develops as an overflow of relationship and intimacy with god true change takes place in our hearts when we allow the spirit of holiness to point out and to pinpoint areas of our life where we are not living up to the glorious power of his holiness we approach him with fear the fear of the lord not the fear of judgment not the fear of losing out with him but we are really standing in awe when we behold his holiness when we read the scripture and we read what he did and we remember what he is doing it really should cause us to be in awe of his majesty his splendor and his holiness and when you think about the fact that some of that holiness is residing in you when you think about some of the holiness of god is residing in you it causes you to want to make better choices it causes you to want to live a cleaner and more separated and consecrated life unto god can you say amen it brings about a true change holiness by greek word by the definition of the greek word is a process a quality and condition of a holy disposition and the quality of one's holiness in personal context excuse me in personal conduct the way we live our lives his holiness resting on our lives is the principle that separates the believer from the world remember it's not just what we do how we dress it's not just those things that separates us from the world it's the fact that his holiness is resting in us that's what makes us completely different now because his holiness is abiding in us the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost is operating in our life then it causes us to want to be different it causes us to want to live a modest life to dress modestly in a world that's gone absolutely insane it causes us to want to draw distinction where the world wants to blur the lines have you ever seen such a blurring of the lines as the hour in which we live when you hear the medical our our medical associations of our nation saying we're just about to the place where we are going to suggest that people no longer assign a gender identity at birth i want you to know that is just the blurring of the lines it's a spirit of babylon it's a spirit of confusion and when the spirit of holiness is at work in your life it actually makes you want to make the lion more distinct it causes a brother a sister to want to make the line darker you know what i mean draw it even even sharper right down the edge and say i don't want to be in the blurry line i don't want to be in the gray area but i want to stand on the side of god's righteousness and holiness holiness consecrates us to god's service both in soul which is the mind and the will and the emotions and is manifested in the body finding fulfillment in moral dedication and a life committed to purity i want you to know no matter what the world is doing around us god has a people no matter what teenagers are doing out there in the world we pray for them to find jesus but i want you to know those teenagers those young people that have received a touch of the holy ghost they have that spirit of holiness working inside of them pulling them back when they get a little close to the edge when they get a little close to the cliff thank god for the spirit of holiness that pulls us back and says now wait a minute isn't that a slippery slope now you know what i've had the spirit of god talk to my heart and uh when he was talking to my heart i realized that what he was dealing with me about is not definable as sin you you couldn't find a scripture to say that is just absolute a manifestation of unbelief that's just a straight out sin and you when you deal with that but yet you know the spirit of god's dealing with you about something but you can't quite see it in black and white in the scripture sometimes that's the spirit of holiness trying to pull you back from a slippery slope the bible said the spirit searcheth all things all the deep things and the spirit of god knows because he sees ahead and maybe by you accepting something into your life in that gray area that you cannot completely define as a work of unrighteousness maybe the holy spirit is pulling you back and dealing with your heart because he sees what's up ahead when one compromise leads to another compromise that leads to another compromise and then you have the church world in the condition she's in today i don't know if you're if you're helping me now i can't hear you out there i don't know if you're giving me any amens out there but i want you to know i'm telling you the truth so if the holy spirit starts dealing with you like that you might be the only one in the church you might be the only one in the family that has this conviction what that is is god is developing a conviction in your life now you've got to be careful with that conviction you can share with others how the lord has dealt with you but you've got to make sure as a believer that you don't judge other people by how the spirit of god has dealt with you because the spirit of holiness in your life may be pulling you back from something because you have a predispos predisposition you have a weakness there may be something in you that would cause you to really get in trouble if you start down that road where another believer might be able to just have that little thing in their life and never go any farther so i don't want to add confusion to what you may be hearing today but i just want you to know that god didn't fill us with this holy ghost to be a judge and jury for other people he filled us with this holy ghost to watch after our lives to guard our families and we should yield to him we should obey him if we feel like we're the only fish that's swimming against the stream holiness causes every component of our character to stand god's inspection and meet his approval if the spirit of god deals with you about something and you obey him and you make a change in your life then you don't ever have to worry about meeting god's condition because if you've been obedient you have met his condition you see the spirit of holiness is operating in the life of the believer to build in us not just a character but his character i know a lot of people that are characters that's a word we use in the sound say oh he's a real character oh she's a real character we're not talking about just someone's distinction we're not just talking about what makes somebody odd or unusual we're talking about the forming of his character the character of jesus christ i know a lot of people see him as a pushover but i want you to know jesus was humble and he was meek and he was mild but he was very serious about his father's business so sometimes we get an idea in our mind of of who he is and how he how he would behave if he were walking among us today and we may miss the fact that the same jesus who was willing to lose reputation by eating with the sinners is the same jesus that wanted to set his father's house in order when religion was taking over for sincerity and for relationship and so he can be meek and mild and gentle like a lamb but i want you to know the next time planet earth has an encounter with jesus christ he's not coming like that little lamb dumb before her shearers but i want you to know he's coming as a lion of the tribe of judah and he's coming to do his father's business the business of the kingdom can you say amen character is the mental and moral quality that is distinctive to an individual holiness causes every part of our character to be able to stand inspection to the holy spirit and meet the approval of our heavenly father the word character in the greek it actually talks about uh from the 16th century it actually talks about a stamp it talks about a a tool that is used to make an impression on something else and so your character is important your character is really who you really are when no one is looking your true character will come out and that's why we need i say we need the spirit of holiness operating in our life you see without the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have the spirit of holiness operating on the inside so that's why we need to stress today like never before that every man woman boy or girl needs to have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost and fire i want to read just a portion from the from the church age book uh there may be things in the church age book i don't perhaps agree with it seems to me like there are things that may not be exactly as he said it but this is a beautiful example of of taking a truth that was spoken and making it easy for us to get a hold of he it starts off in james chapter one uh he's quoting that verse and we might not have got that pulled up because they might not have recognized that as part of the quote so i'll just go ahead and read it to you and then we'll catch up here when it comes to to romans 8. first he said in james 1 verse 2 and 4 he said my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that she may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and then the church age book said why does he stand by and now we'll pick up where where you had it the reason is this is the church age book now the reason is romans 8 verse 17 and 18. he said and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ listen if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and so after those verses were quoted he goes on to tell us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain hear it you have to suffer to reign are you willing to suffer are you willing to do it with the right attitude and a right spirit because if we're going to reign with him we are going to have some suffering here also as a part of who he is we are on this earth training for reigning that is what's happening to us right now we're in training for a day that we're going to sit in his throne and even judge the nations and the scripture says even judge angels now that's a powerful authority that's given to the last day bride of the lord jesus christ it goes on to say the reason for this is that character that's why we're using this quotation the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a you say it victory not a gift in other words character is not something that's imparted to you because you have surrendered your life to the lord jesus so you automatically receive character as a gift no sir character is a victory how many of you know what a victory is it's what comes at the end of the battle it's what comes at the end of the trial some of you who are fighting the virus right now when you get to the place that you can say i'm 100 i've had a couple of people say to me this week i feel 100 then you say i have the victory it's over with the battle is done hallelujah and i'm on the other side of it and that's what character is it's a victory it means you have been tried in the fire you have been tested in your life you have been put in positions that it would have been easy to compromise the truth it would have been easy to cheat it would have been easy to tell a lie but by the help and the grace of god you went all the way through the battle every time oh god help me oh god help me to do it right help me to say it right help me to choose what is right and by his grace and your obedience and yieldedness to him he brought you through it's like brother terry tidwell wrote the song uh god will make this trial a blessing and the last verse i believe it is said i'm standing now on the mountain looking back where i can see that when i was in that deep dark valley his strong hand was leading me oh it's good to feel the sunrise i can taste sweet victory god has made this trial a blessing that's the love he has for me so character is formed and victory comes on the other side of the trial on the other side of the testing hold on press on get a hold of god with everything you have let your hand of faith touch touch him and refuse to turn loose because he will pull you can anybody agree with me that he will pull you through the trial he will pull you through the test if you yield to the work of the holy ghost oh my i don't know what to think about groups of people who say that the baptism of the holy ghost is not for today i don't know what to think about people who make that their doctrine because first of all it's anti-word and second of all how do you make it how do you survive how do you get through stuff without the baptism of the holy ghost he works in us i just named four of the seven a moment ago as the spirit of truth as the spirit of life as the spirit of adoption as the spirit of holiness all of this is the holy ghost working in our life we're blessed people character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic now i know there are some people that say well brother brant i've never said it quite like that well i want you to understand that that is a truth that is a truth because it is based on truth you operate in power is one thing but are you operating with character that goes with that power i have said this many times before i don't want to take a lot of time to say it today but one of the many many many things that the message made such a difference in my life answered so many questions for me help me i mean really helped me on many many many things but one of the things that god used the message for in the early days was the message the anointed ones at the end time when i heard that message i had always had this question in my life my mind because i saw people being mightily used of the spirit of god and yet i knew their character was wrong i knew they were not living the life it eventually came out i don't know how many times through the years someone we knew some preacher somewhere would run off with a piano player have an affair on his wife and run off and marry somebody else and leave his children and i don't want to go into all of it maybe a man would come through mightily used in the gifts praying for the sick and they would recover and it would come out later that they were alcoholics or on drugs i have walked with men and in ministry through the years that would have such glorious visitations and experiences and then later find out that a lot of it was induced by the drugs that they were taking and these things so tormented my mind when i was just a young man and then i heard brother branham preaching on the anointed ones at the end time saying this that the anointing was genuine what the holy ghost was doing was genuine those gifts are are without repentance the bible tells us he gives a gift he doesn't take it back the gift on somebody's life may be genuine the anointing that operates that gift you see a lot of those things that happened in the services were because the people had faith because the believers were holding on they weren't pulling on a man they were pulling on god and god would come down and speak to their need and minister to their body and give them healing and and we we couldn't figure out how that's possible but then we heard the prophet teaching it that way and saying the man may be false the character of the man may be rotten but the gift that was placed on his life was from god and it was genuine he even gave us the example brethren of of a fortune teller a fortune teller that he had an encounter with and he talked about sometimes how these people are given true gifts but they are using that gift for the wrong reason they're using it for darkness instead of for the kingdom of light the gift itself genuine the way that gift begins to move on the genuine movement genuine we could say anointing absolutely because it's the anointing that causes the gift to operate like that however the life is wrong somebody said well what does all that mean it means that we're not following men we're following the word of god and if men fail if men fall if men throw in the towel i know men who just gave it all up and said i don't want any part of it every now and again a minister who is away from the lord away from ministry will even reach out to me and say pray for me i want to be remembered in prayer boy that really touches my heart i don't know what moves me to prayer any more than that because i know that i know that i know i may be preaching to some right now i know that i know that i know that god has placed a calling on their life and i know that somewhere along the way the enemy was able to trap them to trick them i don't know but it could be that the enemy was able to get them to put their eyes on people and not on the cross and not on jesus i want you to know as a minister who has been ministering a long time since 1975 i want you to know there have been many times along the way that i started getting my eyes on other people and that same devil would come and try to trick me and trap me and cause me to give up even at times so strong that the spirit of suicide would even try to come in but god in his glorious grace not because i deserved it not because i was good but because he had me in his mind before the foundation of the world he spared me and he delivered me and he brought me out of it so my heart goes out to those who have fallen by the wayside i call you in in the name of the lord jesus christ i tell you the gifts and callings of god are without repentance and all you have to do is call on the lord and he will not only restore your life but he will put you he'll just pick you up if you let him and set you on the right path and he'll help you to overcome daily we're too late in this thing to let a little bitterness to let a little resentment to get your eyes on people and give up on god don't dare do that whoever you are maybe you're just a believer in a church somewhere you have no real form of ministry well let me tell you right now that god wants to help you he wants to deliver you he wants to put pull you up pick you up and uh so i appreciated hearing brother branham teaching those things and it helped me to realize that was god moving that was god moving here the man had come under something false but god his character was false it shall reign on the just and the unjust the same holy ghost reign the same rain that fell in the vision the same rain that fell and caused the little wheat to raise up his hands and say praise the lord thank you jesus was the same rain that fell on the little tares and you know what they raised up and try to do the very same thing even though they were manifesting another seed something else i am thankful that god has an answer he has an answer for all of our questions i'm thankful that he has the power to reproduce his character in us if we yield to it he goes on to say so a man without character can't reign because power see the preachers had power but there was something wrong and here he says power apart from character is satanic so you want to watch that you want to watch that many many people are fooled by demonstrations of power we're not just looking for power in a ministry we're looking for character we're looking for a character that stands the test of time he said but power with character is fit to rule this is the bride that jesus is building on planet earth right now you may have failed you may have had a bad character you may have made bad decisions but i want you to know yield of the spirit of grace we're going to get on that next time well maybe not the next service but soon uh in a couple of services we'll be on the spirit of grace you let the spirit of grace do a work in your life let him remind you that he's the one who called you let me tell you something if jesus called you he knows how to deliver you he knows how to get you on the right on the right track on the right path and he knows how to come and once again reflect who he is in the life that you live that's the working of the spirit of holiness he goes on to say a man without character let me read it again a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him we don't overcome by our own power we overcome by the blood of the lamb by the word of our testimony and the fact that we did not love our lives more than the service of the lord and the things of god i want you to know we have to be willing to not only live for truth we have to be willing to die for truth can we go on to the next little part and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation now that may not be the door you would choose to go into the kingdom but i want you to know it is the door that many of us have to walk through we have to walk through that door of tribulation to come into the fullness of the kingdom of god when i look at the concept of holiness we're moving on i could say and believe that it is one of the most misunderstood truths in the bible and we as human beings especially church church kids those of us who are raised around the church we are filled with so many concepts so many thoughts so many notions so many impressions sometimes we're standing on impressions we're standing on ideas we're standing on opinions instead of standing on the word did you know there's a whole we look around us we see the the condition the church world is in and we see that there are whole movements that are built on notions there are whole movements that are built on opinions there are whole movements out there that are built on thoughts and concepts but i want you to know if your concepts are wrong your theology is going to be wrong if your opinions are wrong and you're standing on them your whole theology is going to be wrong somebody said what's theology anyway i'm not a preacher so i don't have to worry about theology actually theology is the study of who god is and i want you to know you may not be a teacher you may not be a preacher but every one of us wants to discover the fullness of who god is we want to know that so that we can move according to that so that we don't miss anything that we are heirs of i tell you i i think often of the of the story of the man who got to heaven and he saw all of those all of those or had an experience and he went to heaven and he saw all of those packages just lines and stacks and stacks of packages he looked down and every one of them had his name on it what is this he asked these are all the things that you could have had you could have had these benefits you could have had these blessings but you never asked you never tried to access these things while you were on the earth i dare say that there are many of us who have received the baptism of the holy ghost who don't even understand what it means to yield to the holy ghost as the spirit of truth as the spirit of life as the spirit of adoption as the spirit of holiness all the holy ghost but different ministries different offices different administrations of the same spirit we may not even understand what god has put here oh my what he has placed here is more than enough to get us all the way so we don't want to build our theology our concept of god our thought of god our study of god we don't want to build that on notions we don't want to build that on sinking sands of opinion and thoughts and precedence we want to build it on the word we want to make sure that our theology is on the word that our belief system is built on the word and this is one of the things the spirit of holiness helps us do if we let him if we let him it's very very hard for a brother or sister to allow the spirit of holiness to correct some tradition that they may be holding to that's anti-word i tell you our traditions there's nothing wrong with traditions unless they're making the word of god of none effect or non-effective in our life and sometimes we can so hold on to tradition that we're really rejecting the truth of god's word what i love about this kingdom and what god has done through the church ages to bring us to where we are today is in different seasons of church history he shines his light on different truths of who he is it's all the truth it's all the truth but it begins to line up and it begins to stack line upon line and precept upon precept revelation upon revelation and that's why we want to make sure that we are not operating in opinion that we are not operating in notion that we're not operating and feeling we want to make sure that we are operating on and by the truth of god's word can you say amen i didn't hear you all right serving the lord in holiness it's not just about keeping rules it's not just about keeping regulations it's not just about measuring everything it's about so much more than that it's really about your will coming into alignment with his will lord not my will you know this is the ultimate victory our lord won the ultimate victory in gethsemane i know that we say the ultimate victory was at the cross that was your ultimate victory that was my ultimate victory but his ultimate victory was one in the garden of gethsemane when he said oh if at all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless i've heard preachers say the most powerful word ever spoken was nevertheless not my will but thy will be done it was in that moment when he was able even though the will of his flesh was pulling in one direction and that was to live the will the pull of his mind and his will and his emotion it was pulling him in the direction that said i want to finish this i want to live i want to continue to minister i want to continue to help people on this level and yet in in gethsemane in the crushing when the olives were being crushed when he prayed until great drops of blood appeared as as it would just come right out of the pores of his body like perspiration the agony was so intense in the garden that medical doctors have examined the verses and they believed that the pain was so intense not at the cross but in the garden that it caused the pericardium that that sack of fluid around your heart to protect your heart when you get jarred around or when you move around and athletics or in an automobile or whatever that that sack of you know you don't even know you have one until something goes wrong with it i never had mine to burst that's very very serious that's death setting in but i had an infection one time after after a heavy series of meetings in ministry i got wore down in my body and i had i don't know something like mononucleosis i don't know exactly what it was uh other than than this that i am about to mention but i got so wore down that i began to have chest pains and i was i was way too young to be thinking about that and it was over my heart and i thought surely i'm having heart trouble i i may be having a heart attack and i ended up going to the doctor and it was pericarditis it was an inflammation and infection in the fluid and in that sack around the heart and brother i felt it and i don't ever want to feel that again but our lord was in such agony in the garden of gethsemane that they say that pericardium burst and that fluid began to run through his body mixed with blood and the and the the the capillaries of the body begin to burst and the blood began to come out like sweat would come out he was in great agony but i want you to know he won the victory he won a personal victory that day because he was able hallelujah he was able to bring his will in alignment to the fathers with not my will but thy will be done listen you say i don't think i could ever achieve such a thing not on your own not on my own but by the holy ghost that lives in us by the ministry of the spirit of holiness i believe i believe we can be honed into such a place where our will comes into perfect alignment with his will remember jesus said i can't do anything on my own it's only what my father shows me i can do you may think i've lost my mind today i'm not even looking for your comments to see if you're with me or not you may think i've lost my mind but i believe and i'm going to say it anyway i believe with all my heart that there's a bride that's being built in this hour i believe there's a people that are being formed in this hour who are going to come into that place where their will is in perfect alignment with his will so when you think of holiness and the spirit of holiness don't just focus on the fact that god has called us to sanctify ourselves i want you to know the bible tells us we should sanctify ourselves we should consecrate ourselves that word sanctification and consecration means set apart so and i'll give you these scriptures probably the next time we're together uh there are many of them in leviticus for instance there are several places where he tells the people you consecrate yourself you sanctify yourself which means you set yourselves apart from all these other things you make a conscious decision to put yourself apart from many of those things and he mentioned some of them under the law and in the new testament some of these things are mentioned that we should set our ourselves apart from now let me see i have a little more time would you turn to matthew chapter 23 if you have your bible there i want to read uh verse two to six we're not getting as far along in this as i would like to today but i don't want to hold you too long because i know some of you really need rest you need rest for your body all right matthew 23 verses 2 and 6 saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat this is in red letter this is jesus all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do now let's not miss where we are jesus is talking about the scribes those who knew the letter of the law because they had copied it word for word not word for word letter for letter did you know that to be a scribe in the time of the bible of the scroll some of you see this uh behind me and you're wondering what it is from time to time we have people ask what this is but because it's dressed in in some velvet there with some words on it and people are asking well what in the world is that well that is a torah scroll the first five books of the bible and this particular one was hand carried all the way from iraq into jerusalem all the way hand carried and it's very very old and i feel very very blessed to own it now in in the time of the bible when scrolls like this were made and even today when they're made because they're still made today for the jewish people to read from in the synagogue on shabbat and when there may if one little mistake one little the ink drops on the page the whole page is finished there's no erasing there's no no starting over and and just scratching through it like we do there's no liquid paper you know white out the whole page is gone and it has to be started so these scribes from the time of the second temple they didn't just know the the the law they knew every letter of the law they had written it down copied it down time and time and time again can you imagine filling up a whole page and then having to start over and do the whole page again so they really knew and the pharisees they those were the men who were dedicated to keeping every letter of the law and beyond they they were so afraid of missing it they just wanted to add to it they just wanted to make sure everything was was well well under control but they lost their relationship because they were focusing on the letter and they were missing the fact that god was looking to have an intimate relationship with his people so this is jesus now and he's talking about the scribes and the pharisees they sit in moses seat which was a place of judgment which is a place of of authority as the elders of the of the community and this was a very important concept that we won't take time to talk about verse three all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not now i want you to hear this is a royal rebuke isn't it this is jesus rebuking the scribes and the pharisees and yet he is telling the congregation you do what they say you observe what they say follow their words but do not follow their works you must hear what they have to say because they speak of the truth but they don't behave like the truth so jesus is really talking to the congregation he's really talking to a believer like you and i and he's saying what they bid you to observe observe uh and what they say do do but do not after their works for they say and do not verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers they've lost their compassion they've lost their feeling for people they have spent all this time focusing on the letter of the law and how to keep the letter of the law that they have forgotten the needs of the people they have forgotten to show any compassion or any love and they won't move any of those heavy burdens they just keep piling them on no matter regardless of the circumstances they had no mercy for those you know jesus had mercy he didn't come destroying the law but he had mercy he said my if you're if your donkey's in a ditch you got to pull it out if you're hungry you've got to pluck and eat and uh even though the law says this when you're in a place of desperation now the old preachers that i grew up with they said now jesus didn't mean you could shove your donkey into it so you could pull it out on sunday they used to talk about people all the time volunteering to work in miss church and they said see these people think they're standing on the word but they're they're guilty of pushing the donkey in so they can pull him out on sunday and they used to say jesus wasn't talking about that and indeed he was not but all their works they do here's the key but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feast and the chief seats in the synagogues this is jesus saying what they say is right listen to what they say but do not do it like they do it because they say it and they never do it jesus wanted the believer to not only talk it but to walk it not only to declare it but to live it and that's where character comes in because i want you to know you can fool people when you're around people but there's a set of all seeing eyes and god knows us when there's nobody looking but us what you do in the darkness what you do with no one looking around is a better reflection of your character than what you do when everybody's looking jesus said these men are doing a lot of religious stuff lots of religious stuff but they're doing it to be seen of men and it is holiness let me just say holiness is never so that you can make yourself appear holy it's never so that you when when you choose to dress a certain way because you want to reflect a sanctified and set apart life you're doing that as unto the lord you're doing that to cause people to see you that's why so many times through the years when we've been out in public not even thinking right that moment of the things of the lord i remember a time we were somewhere visit i don't remember exactly where we were except in the mall might have been in atlanta somewhere i just remember my little family and i think judith sister judith was with us if i remember correctly and we were just walking through a mall and all of a sudden i looked down and there was a woman standing between me and my wife and we were walking kind of brisk we were walking kind of brisk through the mall and this little lady just walked right up between us and was walking with us well we never slowed down and i thought well she's trying to pass between us she's trying to get between us and uh all of a sudden i could tell she wanted to say something and we just slowed down a little bit and she looked come and she said oh i used to be what you all are she said i used to walk with god like you all walk with god and she said i i just i i've just forsaken that i'm just not walking with the lord i said to her what i say to everybody who approaches me that way and i said ma'am it's not too late you can go right back to where you left off and you can set every wrong right and you can follow him the way you have once followed him and we stopped and had a conversation with that little lady one time we were standing in an amusement park with our family and a woman walked up like that and began to just confess her heart i used to serve god that way and never even asking us what we what our faith was now i know for sure that she saw a difference in the way we appeared the way we were living on the outside she noticed my wife she noticed a sister that was with us she saw that was different but i want you to know i know it was more than that because i know that a lot of times you see people out like that and they won't even smile at you you see women with their hair fixed just right and men looking clean and holy before and they won't even say hello i know there was something else that drew that woman to us i want you to understand i believe how we present ourselves out there is vitally important because it's one of the things that god uses to draw people to us when they see that we have set ourselves apart but don't you ever brother sister get to a place where you think that is what makes you holy don't ever get to a place church where you think that is what makes me right with god because i keep the standard because i follow a conviction because i i try to do what the church is teaching don't ever think that your holiness comes from that it comes from the word it comes from following jesus christ it comes from imparted righteousness it's his holiness it's his righteousness that's been imparted to us salvation is not of works lest any man should boast however there's a blessing coming i believe with all of my heart if you choose to walk before god sanctified and set apart i believe with all my heart that if you choose to let your behavior reflect christ let your dress reflect christ let the way you treat people in the world reflect christ how you treat people that pass you on the highway how you treat people in the line who cut in line to get in front of you i believe every one of those things testify of the real character that christ wants to build in us and that is a character that reflects him so you may you may have all the outward things right you you may get everything in line uh like the pharisees and scribes but jesus was after more than a people who would measure up externally i believe it's important don't you misunderstand this preacher but jesus was after more than just a people who would measure up externally he was after a people who would measure up by letting the spirit of holiness reflect and build in them the holiness of god i'm telling you in order for a bride to function in the authority i guess i better hurry now in order for a bride to function in the authority that god is calling her to function in she's going to have to first have his character his life formed inside of her this is so vitally important because there's a temptation to fix up the external to fix up the outside and not worry and not deal with the inside oh it's better to get it in the right order and let god do something on the inside see jesus said all they were doing was to be seen of men therefore it was more about pride than anything else oh they like to wear their robes long they like to enlarge the borders of their garments which which had to do with the zit seat they like to make that big and wide and and show that you know a man's a man was sometimes esteemed by the border of his garment and that's why we're told by many people that jesus wore a garment without a a border without a hymn is that perhaps there's words there that make us think that his garment was an unhemmed garment had no border on it but those religious men they would just start raising the hem of their garment making a bigger and bigger border at the bottom so that you could see more of their of their form of religion what they were trying to do and they made their phylacteries bigger the you know the things that that they would put between their their eyes on their forehead and bind as the scripture told them in the old testament to bind these things and we see the jews doing the same thing today as they pray setting these uh to feel them on their on their forehead and wrapping it on their arm but men got carried away and they wanted to make them wider and and bigger and more noticeable they were doing it to be seen instead of to reflect christ and jesus was upset i'm telling you he rebuked them it was about pride more than anything else it had very little to do with pleasing god i want to tell you right now that is not true holiness holiness is often misunderstood i want to set the record straight that what you do only to be seen of man because of the of the pride of your own life you want to be seen as religious you want to be seen as holy those things are not pleasing to god in fact they have real no no real value or merit in the kingdom at all this is what we end up producing when we try to make ourselves holy instead of letting the holy ghost do that in us and through us we get an idea if i do this then i'll be more holy oh i'm telling you that's not where true holiness comes from no siree let me read you a quotation uh it's uh it's about 15 minutes to one so i have a little more time about i'll take at least another 15 minutes and we won't go much beyond that and you know that's good for me i'm normally here to two but i'm going to try my best not to go too far beyond this let me read paragraph 120 from from satan's eden uh let me just show you some things from the message here that fit right along with where the true holiness is he said compare this now how much alike that man and his wife both in god's eden without one stitch of clothes on them and knew it not he's talking about adam and eve isn't he for they didn't they for why didn't they know it for they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the holy spirit they couldn't even see they couldn't even discern they had no sense of good and evil they had no knowledge of good and evil for them it was all good what god had provided was all good they had not dealt with the temptation of sin they didn't know there was a darkness lurking in the garden they didn't know that beyond the the protective area of the garden that lay in eden they didn't know that there were many many things out there and that they were soon going to experience them all he said they could look right at each other and they didn't know they were naked they were veiled with the holy spirit of holiness they were veiled he said god's veil yet today can look and not lust they turn their head it's a holy veil see holy veil god had their eyes they were both one was man the other was woman and they did not know they were naked because the holiness of god kept their eyes veiled notice god hid their conscious from sin by the holy veil the prophet is telling us that even in the garden of eden the spirit of holiness was operating in adam and eve in such a manner that they could not even recognize that they were naked what's naked they were covered by the holy veil of god's holiness and then of course you know that veil was removed because of what took place in the garden of eden and we're working hard we're pushing our way through in faith to come back to a place where the spirit of holiness is so operating on the inside let me tell you something this is what he's talking about this is what we need in this hour we need such a manifestation of the spirit of holiness operating in us that if a man should come along and somehow without expecting to without intending to without trying to i don't mean someone searching pornography but i mean someone coming across something like that but such a work of holiness going on in their life and some picture flash up or they see listen it was reported that a woman was walking down the highway maybe out of her head i don't know but i read just where right in our town there was a woman walking up the side the road no clothes on whatsoever just walking up naked i i i don't understand what was maybe going on with her but if a man should see something like that there is a work of holiness the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost in that man that he could see that and turn his head not choose to look at something like that even though the opportunity was there maybe even nobody would know but he would choose not to take a second glance i won't even look back at that why because there was no lust he was he was yielding to the spirit of holiness instead of yielding to the temptation of lust he didn't want to set himself on a collision course for a whole lot more sin and a whole lot more heartache so he saw it and he never even allowed the lust to begin to form he turned his head you know brother branham talked about hanging the cross from his rear view mirror because of the things you'd see just driving down the road when i see something like that i looked to the cross what was he doing he was trying to yield to the spirit of holiness that was present in him by the holy ghost and shut out every opportunity for the enemy to come and contaminate your mind and draw you into the filth of this world i believe god's working that kind of work in people i believe there are people who are under the influence of the spirit of holiness and if they should see something like that could absolutely turn away from it and never even desire to take the second look is that common are there more people like that than than the ret no i don't think it's all that common but i think that's what god's doing in his people and i think if you're not there yet you're certainly moving in the right direction if you understand that the holy ghost is present in us to bring about that spirit of holiness to help shape and form and mold our character and our will to the character and the will of jesus christ and never go back listen everybody faces temptation in one way or another but you've got somebody on board this holy ghost is living inside of you to help you not to even take the second look my old granny used to say something you probably wouldn't agree with it but she used to say something like this she said you know it's not the first case it's not the first fifth that makes a man alcoholic it's the drop it's the first drop she said if he sets his she was talking about people who had come to know the lord too she said if he sets his mind towards something it's like pitching your tent towards sodom if he says i mean i can handle it i can handle it i know i can handle it i'm a strong man i'm a big man i can handle that and so i can just take a little drink i'm i'm tired i've worked hard today i'm just going to take a little drink i want you to know my granny felt like that was the worst thing that man could do not only did she think it was wrong she thought that was preparing himself to go down the road that he had no business going down that's not the only time he's ever going to be tired that's not the only time he's not ever going to look for something to ease his nerves or or calm him arrest him or something and what it develops in somebody like that is that slippery slope oh my that takes you farther sin will take you farther than you really want to go and it'll leave you there longer than you really want to stay this is how temptation works but i want you to know as believers we not only have forgiveness through the blood and grace of jesus christ but we have the holy ghost resident in us to help us come to a place where if the temptation was laid right there in our lap and someone could guarantee us no one will ever know what you do that there would be enough of god enough of the holy ghost enough of the spirit of holiness operating in us that we would still turn never take the second look never go back to revisit what the enemy had put before us we're going to opera there's going to be a bride operating i think she's here i think there are more that need to catch up but i think she's here i think there's a people being molded being shaped being fashioned into the character of jesus christ that's what the word has accomplished on our behalf can i give you one more thank you i didn't wait for you it happens to be another one from the church ages philadelphia and church age let's see if we have it yes they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably here that's what we were talking about in matthew's gospel they sought their righteousness after the law and failed miserably for by the law can no flesh be justified by the law can no man be made holy holiness is of the lord first corinthians 1 30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption oh hallelujah i got to read that again but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption second corinthians 5 21 the second part of that verse that we might be made the righteousness of god in him it was christ or perish and they perished for they refused him and men of that age even today were making this ass even today and men of that age as even today were making the same mistake as the jews took refuge in the synagogue form of worship so in the philadelphian age they were taking refuge in the church oh listen it is not joining a church that counts that doesn't mean that you don't have to have fellowship in a church but it's not joining the church that counts the life is not in the church the life is in christ oh i have to say amen i have to say amen this is the record that god hath given us to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life listen at this next sentence i agree with it wholeheartedly man man is made holy by the spirit man is made holy by the spirit let's read on a moment it is the spirit of holiness this is what we read in romans 1 when we were beginning it is the spirit of holiness that raised jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy how with his holiness oh i got to read it again i'm sorry i have to read that one more time it is the spirit of holiness that raised jesus from the dead put your finger there a minute you say how in the world can you say that that's what the bible said in romans 1 3 and 4 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead so this spirit of holiness manifested and brought about this glorious resurrection it is the spirit of holiness that raised jesus from the dead that indwells us and makes us holy how with his holiness there he stands the holy one and we will stand with him yes we will clothed in his righteousness holy with his holiness there is a bride oh yes you tell this wicked world you tell this world that has compromised the word of god you tell this world that that's wondering whether a person a baby born is male or female or 11 dozen other genders you tell this world that has called right wrong and wrong right you tell this world that has left its natural affection and yielded itself to unholy and unnatural desires and lust you tell this world that is more concerned about somebody wearing a mask than murdering babies in the womb you tell this world that there is a people that are being clothed in the holiness of the holy one they're not always perfect in their life they're not always perfect in their choices but they have received an imparted righteousness they have received an imparted holiness and that holiness of him is working in them to bring them to a place where they can make the constant and consistent decision i choose the word i choose the word i choose the word i won't yield to the nakedness that is on display before me i won't yield to how easy it is to hide my secret sin i won't yield because i'm being clothed whoa i feel good i'm being clothed with the righteousness of him who has only ever been holy he's never been anything but holy ah one more 101 one more i got to get this one in it's one of my favorite quotations and i got to get it in and we'll come back at least one more session on the spirit of holiness what shall i do with jesus call christ 1963 the dynamics of this church what church the end time bride church is that the denominational church no sir it's the holy ghost church it's that church that he had on his mind before the foundation of the world and it's not in a building it's not in a geographical location it's a universal bride it's abroad all over the world called by the word of the hour called by the holy ghost to truth to come out of compromise to come out of lethargy to come out of religion to come out of pride to come out of a sense of i've got to make myself holy and come to the reality that the only way you can be holy is to yield to him and the more you yield to him the better choices you make and the more you yield to him the more modest the lady wants to be she wants to cover her body she does not want to be you say this you make people mad but she does not want to be the object of somebody's lust she is saving herself for her husband she has no desire to draw the attention of men to the form of her body because she doesn't have to be frumpy no no she doesn't have to be frumpy she doesn't have to look like uh uh i might not ought to say what i thought to say she doesn't have to look like something left over from from last year's thrift sale no no no no no she's reflecting the king she doesn't have to look frumpy she doesn't have to look stale and outdated she just desires to be holy she just desires to be modest she desires to be a reflection of jesus christ she doesn't want all kinds of holes and tears and rips and things that you can peekaboos and things you can see through she doesn't want that not because she's afraid of the church or her pastor but because she wants to reflect jesus she does not want to be the object of somebody's lust she wants to be a reflection of the love of god if she draws anybody she wants to draw them to christ and not to herself and a man the same way a man who wears his jeans too tight has got the same kind of spirit on him he needs to be a little more careful about the way he displays his body as well because he doesn't want to be the object of somebody else's attention or affection he doesn't want to be drawing eyes to him he wants to be drawing eyes to jesus christ oh i wish you'd help me i don't know if you're helping me maybe uh maybe folks are turning that's too old-fashioned preaching for me i don't want no part of that well i want to tell you something he's going to have a bride he has her he has a bribe and she wants to reflect him the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit oh god we need it we need a refilling of the holy ghost would you tell him would you tell him right where you are as the musicians begin to make their way here for us to worship before we sign off today oh we need a revealing of the holy ghost why don't you make it personal and say oh lord i need a refilling of the holy ghost he said here in this message the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body whoa what is it it's zechariah's prophecy it's the headstone it's the capstone it's jesus christ the living word coming down to unite himself to his wife to his bride and what she has operated in in a small measure while the headstone was coming down whoa to unite with the body listen to this but when that head christ and body the virgin bride when the head and the body unites together the full power somebody say full power the full power of the holy ghost hallelujah praise his name whoa the full power hallelujah i'm coming back to you in a minute the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead even the dead that's in christ or hundreds of years ago will rise i i got to read it again i got distracted my watch started talking to me and it was trying to search for raising the dead siri thought i was uh that i was trying to do a search on raising the dead so let me just read it carefully here but when the head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will rise how is that bride going to rise she's going to ride this rise the same way the lord jesus christ did which we just read in romans 1. she's going to rise in the beauty whoa of her works no she will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take of light to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit whoa you say i i don't know about what all that spirit of holiness is about well that spirit of holiness is trying to bring you and i to a full measure of his holiness so that our decisions and our choices and our lifestyle begins to be an overflow of who he is his holiness imparted to us but that spirit of holiness doesn't leave us when we get to that place he stays around in us and through us because one of these days the bride of jesus christ is going to rise in the resurrection in the spirit of his holiness his righteousness not what we have worked for but what we have yielded to i want to say that again not what we have worked for but what we have yielded to he is holy he is holy he is worthy he he's wonderful to be praised you and i are so blessed my brother sister my friend we are so blessed i say so many times everything that he has required of us he has provided for us he said i'm going to have a holy people what did he do he put the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost in the believer to work in us not just to show us what's wrong but to also show us what's right to manifest in us what is right to shape and form our character until we are bearing the character and the attributes of jesus christ are we all there potentially yes potentially we are but not always in the manifestation or in the reality so we're marching forward we're marching forward we're going into the kingdom through the door of suffering we are marching forward to be made into his image to yield ourselves to his holiness to his righteousness to his likeness i want us to worship the lord before we go today i want us to reflect on his holiness how wonderful he is how great it is to serve a living god we want to lift him up he's worthy to be praised so if you can stay with us a few more moments please do that and let's spend some time in worship right now if we could i don't know what you've got picked but just sing it and if there's not anything in it about holy or righteous we'll try to find something in a minute too but you just lead us in whatever you have there we're going to use this time to worship the lord together god bless you who have been with us through this hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord today hallelujah i cast my mind to calvary yes where jesus bled and died for me [Music] i see his wounds his hands his fear my

worthy he is oh lord you may not always come the minute we want you to come but we acknowledge today that you are always right on time you keep all of your appointments hallelujah you are faithful and true you are holy lord you are holy your holiness is residing in the heart of the believer because of the baptism of the holy ghost help us to yield help us lord to bring our will into alignment with your will this is what holiness is trying to accomplish in our life we surrender our will to you hallelujah what is that song for your name is holy i don't remember exactly how it goes i just remember the course for your name is holy and i don't have the words here so i might not even be able to sing it do you remember what i'm talking about hallelujah we ought to know it but i just write this second i can't get it but i'd like to sing something about how holy he is i would like for the lord to anoint our eyes those of us who have never seen him in his holiness i would like for god to let you experience a glimpse somewhere in your life somewhere in your devotion i would like for you to catch an experience where you could behold for a moment catch an inner glimpse of his holiness he is so worthy yes yes yes yes i enter the holy of holies let's sing that hallelujah hallelujah can you lead it i enter the holy of holies [Music] [Music] i am [Music] i worked lord i will [Music] thank

name is holy you are holy lord yes yes you are holy lord you are holy lord you are holy lord we recognize today that all of our holiness and all of our righteousness anything that we can manufacture of our own is not enough so today again we yield to your holiness we yield to your righteousness we say again that you are not satisfied to be a god above us or only to walk with us but you are a god who desire to live in us and so you came by the holy ghost and you placed a portion of your holiness inside of each and every believer and if we yield by your grace if we yield you bring us into your character you bring us into a place of manifesting who you are and the attributes of your glory we want to thank you lord you made a way there was no way else there was no other way but you made a way for your name is holy you are holy [Laughter] lord [Laughter] yes for your name is holy [Music] lord for your name is holy holy [Music] lord the last time for your name for your name is holy hallelujah you are holy [Music] lord yes you are yes you are jesus you are holy you are worthy you're wonderful hallelujah hallelujah praise god i want to remind you that we will go back through the comments we will get your prayer request and i promise you that i will pray and i know there are members of this church that will go back over these comments and they will call your need before the lord i'm sure of that because we have some real prayer warriors in our church and i will do it myself so you can continue to add your prayer request through the afternoon if you want to come back to it and put them there i go back and read every comment and if there's a prayer request i've been faithful to the best of my ability to call that before the lord because i know there's power in agreement and i know if we come together believing we've seen god do some mighty things for those that we have been praying for we know people in other places in other congregations that have come right back from the brink of death and are already beginning to show such great signs of recovery for the glory of god what's the explanation god just wasn't through with them they had not run their course here on this earth they have yet something to do and we're going to be here i tell you you're going to be here exactly to the time until the moment that god has designed and desired to take you to be with him we're praying for the rest of you who are fighting these awful symptoms we're believing that you will have no long-term side effects and i encourage you not to spend a lot of time on google to read about all the things that can linger and all the things you can have for years i would say the devil is a liar it was god who is bringing me through this who has brought me through this and it's his healing power it's going to take care of every side effect and every lingering effect that the enemy would desire to keep placing on my body we're whole because jesus has paid the price to make us whole father i pray right now in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ for every believer watching this program right now this service as it goes out if there's one person that doesn't know you as lord and savior i pray that in this moment they would surrender their life they would repent of their sin and they would yield to you to come in and fill them with who you are and with the wonderful power of the holy ghost lord i pray again for those battling the virus that they come through with the victory and that on the other end of this they will have a praise like they've never had before may they come out with an understanding of how gracious and how good and how merciful you have been in their lives lord every unspoken request we lift it up to you right now and every request that has come in on these different platforms i lift them up right now until i can go and read each one i lift these needs before you right now in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ i expect that there's going to be changes made and differences made because of the prayer of faith because of us binding together in the name of the lord jesus christ we love you that's that's why we have made the decision to open the services for many many many years we were by registration only and uh who knows what the future holds there may come a time that we are forced to go back to such a a system as that but the lord placed a burden on two brothers hearts who work in this ministry that we should let this be expanded let the critics criticize and let the believers be blessed and so that is what we have done and it's because we love you and it's because we want to be a blessing to you in whatever way we can so we thank you from the bottom of our heart for being with us today i want to say to all the new hope family god bless you we love you we can't wait to be able to see you again we're going to be stream only tuesday night and i will give you a final decision hopefully by the leadership of the lord on tuesday night what we will do for next sunday but we're hoping and and really anticipating that we could be together again with some measures in place a little a little careful uh planning and whatever might be necessary for those of you that have not had the virus we want to be mindful of that but we long to be together in the presence of the lord god bless you we love you thank you for being a part of this service today bye-bye hallelujah [Music] [Music] you
