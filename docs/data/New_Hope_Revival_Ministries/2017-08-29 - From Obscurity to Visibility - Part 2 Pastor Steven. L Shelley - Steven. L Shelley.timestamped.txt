[0:30] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:33] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:35] cry welcome welcome we're just so happy
[0:39] to have you tuning in to this broadcast
[0:41] for this week and I pray that something
[0:45] will be said that will minister to your
[0:47] needs I also realize and recognize that
[0:50] there are people who would watch this
[0:52] program that perhaps will hear some
[0:54] things concerning the gospel of the Lord
[0:57] Jesus Yeshua that you have never heard
[1:00] before and I want to invite you to
[1:02] consider them to pray about them and if
[1:05] you haven't already I'd like to
[1:07] encourage you to make a decision to
[1:10] follow the Lord Jesus Christ he has paid
[1:12] the price the ultimate price with his
[1:15] own shed blood so that you and I might
[1:18] be redeemed back to our Father great
[1:21] reconciliation has taken place because
[1:25] of Jesus Christ I consider it one of the
[1:29] greatest privileges of my life to be
[1:32] able to come to you week after week on
[1:35] this broadcast and I pray that you who
[1:38] are so faithful to watch will be blessed
[1:41] each time that you tuned in I want you
[1:44] to know that not only can you see the
[1:47] Eagles cry on the satellite network that
[1:51] you're watching right now and some of
[1:53] you are even viewing it on cable because
[1:56] there are some places where the cable
[1:58] companies are pulling down the feed from
[2:01] the satellite
[2:02] wiring it right into your home but I
[2:05] want you to know that you can also get
[2:08] some of the episodes of the Eagles cry
[2:10] on your computer through subscribing to
[2:15] our Eagle cast you can do that by
[2:19] visiting our website
[2:21] revival dot o-r-g and if you visit us at
[2:26] revival dot org there will be a link a
[2:30] button where you can click it will take
[2:32] you to iTunes you can subscribe to our
[2:35] podcast or Eagle cast and you can
[2:38] download
[2:40] the video or audio and when I say that
[2:44] I'll always feel a little funny because
[2:46] the video has audio or you can just
[2:50] download the audio without video so
[2:53] either one you're gonna get the sound
[2:55] but with one you can have the video and
[2:58] the audio and you can view it on your
[3:01] computer sometimes the video file can be
[3:04] a little bit large so you can delete it
[3:06] when you're finished or you can also
[3:09] link it up to your iPod or your mp3 mp4
[3:14] player and take it with you to work
[3:16] share it with somebody burn the DVD well
[3:19] anyway I may sound like I know what I'm
[3:22] talking about but I don't I'm not very
[3:25] tech savvy but I tell you what what I
[3:28] can say about technology I thank God for
[3:31] where we are right now in technology
[3:34] because I see what a handy tool
[3:38] technology has become electronic
[3:41] technology has become
[3:43] to further the gospel of the kingdom
[3:47] when we first entered the internet
[3:50] ministry on the World Wide Web that was
[3:54] back in 97 so this is 10 years since we
[3:58] have had revival org and the traffic has
[4:02] grown tremendously and the the site has
[4:05] grown and we're still growing and still
[4:08] developing in fact it's a very exciting
[4:10] time at New Hope revival ministries and
[4:13] so if the Lord speaks to you in some way
[4:15] to help support us financially then the
[4:19] address is given the phone number is
[4:21] given and you can do it quite easily
[4:23] through our web page there is a partner
[4:27] and anyone who sends an offering monthly
[4:31] on a monthly basis even if it's five
[4:33] dollars it's considered a partner with
[4:36] us and we use those funds to pay for
[4:41] what we're doing with Christian
[4:42] television and also to try to help our
[4:45] staff we have a very small staff that's
[4:48] overworked and underpaid and who have
[4:51] given their entire lives to to see the
[4:54] work of the Lord go on so we're not
[4:56] about begging for money and I think you
[4:58] know that I think you've noticed that
[5:00] already unless this is your first time
[5:02] watching the program some of you been
[5:05] watching us for a long time now and you
[5:07] know that we hardly even mention it but
[5:10] I do feel in my spirit that these are
[5:12] times of expansion and I do believe that
[5:16] a lot of people doing a little bit can
[5:20] really make a difference in what we are
[5:23] feeling what our vision is to expand and
[5:26] to grow so it's a wonderful thing to
[5:29] know that this little broadcast is not
[5:31] only going out in through satellite
[5:34] television but also over the worldwide
[5:37] web and also there are people who stream
[5:40] our services live from the new hope
[5:43] revival ministries in Alabama you can
[5:45] find out how to do that on our web page
[5:47] so you really need to be in touch with
[5:49] us and I'd like to have an email from
[5:51] you if all it said was I am watching you
[5:54] in such-and-such a place because it's so
[5:58] interesting and encouraging to know that
[6:01] you're on the other end of this camera
[6:03] that you are watching that we're getting
[6:06] out the signal is coming to you and I've
[6:09] told you before we all enjoy it but I
[6:11] have four children two boys and two
[6:14] girls my oldest boy just turned nine
[6:17] years old and my youngest is a girl and
[6:20] she just turned one year old and so the
[6:23] oldest two boys and and and I guess the
[6:27] the third one which is also a girl
[6:30] Olivia she's in an age almost to where
[6:34] she can get excited about it but my boys
[6:36] they get so excited when I tell them
[6:38] about the different nations the
[6:40] different countries that are watching
[6:42] this program we often get out the map or
[6:44] get the globe and we point it out and I
[6:47] I tell you I have to brush up on my
[6:49] geography a little bit to learn just
[6:51] where some of you are living but anyway
[6:53] I just feel so relaxed I just feel like
[6:57] that there is something happening in in
[7:00] this ministry and with the Eagles cry
[7:03] and I feel like God is giving it great
[7:06] anointing and greater impact and I
[7:09] consider that a fruit of your prayers
[7:11] not only the prayers of those who are
[7:14] here but I have had many people who have
[7:18] contacted us to say we are praying we
[7:23] get a lot of prayer support from the UK
[7:26] from across Europe from Scandinavia and
[7:29] that prayer support is what helps us to
[7:32] reach way out into some very unusual and
[7:37] almost desolate places where you
[7:40] wouldn't even hardly imagine that
[7:42] satellite people would have a satellite
[7:45] television
[7:47] receiver but they do and thank God they
[7:51] do thank God they do when we're in
[7:53] Israel and we're often in Jerusalem and
[7:56] we do ministry there we have lots of
[7:58] friends and loved ones there and when
[8:01] we're there we make it a game if my
[8:03] children are with me of counting the
[8:06] satellite dishes on the houses and
[8:08] brother you can get way up there there
[8:12] are many many many people across the
[8:14] land of Israel into the territories etc
[8:17] that have satellite and some of them are
[8:20] watching and have been watching the
[8:22] Eagles crying times past because we've
[8:24] had response well anyway thank you for
[8:27] being a part of what the Lord is doing
[8:29] let's get right into the Word of God
[8:31] today okay last week we were reading and
[8:33] I say a chapter 58 and we only got two
[8:37] verses so I'm gonna read those verses
[8:39] real quickly so we don't so that
[8:42] something doesn't strike me that I want
[8:44] to come in about okay is it such a fast
[8:46] that I have chosen a day for a man to
[8:49] afflict his soul is it to bow down his
[8:52] head as a bulrush and to spread
[8:54] sackcloth and ashes under him will thou
[8:57] call this a fast and an acceptable day
[9:00] to the Lord a question
[9:02] it's not this the fast that I have
[9:05] chosen another question to loose the
[9:09] bands of wickedness amen amen amen to
[9:13] undo the heavy burdens and to let the
[9:17] oppressed go free
[9:19] that you break every yoke that's my
[9:21] prayer for the kingdom of God to expand
[9:25] and to advance and every oppressive
[9:29] burden every
[9:32] depression every oppression of the enemy
[9:35] be broken every yoke of bondage that you
[9:39] wear over your life whatever it is that
[9:42] has you bound hey I've got good news
[9:45] Jesus is the great Emancipator he is the
[9:49] great liberator and he can set you free
[9:53] and he whom the son sets free is what
[9:57] free indeed and that's what we are so
[10:00] desiring and praying for for you in your
[10:03] life verse 7 is it not to deal thy bread
[10:06] to the hungry and that thou bring the
[10:09] poor that are cast out to thy house out
[10:11] to the house when thou seest the naked
[10:14] that thou cover him and that thou hide
[10:17] not thyself from thine own flesh you see
[10:21] part of being spiritual part of being
[10:24] christ-like part of being a Christian is
[10:27] to help meet the needs of other people I
[10:30] know sometime even in our local ministry
[10:33] we become so focused on reaching the
[10:36] nation's that we forget about the fact
[10:38] and we spread ourselves so thinly
[10:41] financially in trying to reach the
[10:44] nation's that we forget about that there
[10:45] are needs right here in our own
[10:48] community God help us to be more mindful
[10:51] of those who are also around us to
[10:54] clothe the naked to feed the hungry to
[10:56] give to the poor because it's very
[10:59] important that we show the love and the
[11:04] character of Jesus Christ to all people
[11:06] not just those who believe what we
[11:08] believe but those who are in need so let
[11:12] me encourage you as I also feel the
[11:15] conviction of the Lord that we all be
[11:19] very sensitive to needs around us and
[11:23] you know if you can't financially help
[11:26] me to need you can pray I mean seriously
[11:30] intercede and believe God
[11:33] and watch him open the windows of heaven
[11:36] and use other people and other means and
[11:39] other sources to meet that need and
[11:41] you've done just as much when you've
[11:43] prayed sincerely not having anything to
[11:46] give financially but you've prayed
[11:48] sincerely that the need would be met in
[11:51] faith consistently and when the need is
[11:53] met then you have played a vital part of
[11:58] the meeting of that need and God will
[12:00] reward you equally for your faithfulness
[12:03] to him so don't be discouraged if you
[12:05] can't financially meet a need but but do
[12:09] what you can let's have compassion on
[12:11] one another now verse eight says then
[12:15] shall thy light break forth as the
[12:19] morning it sounds like the explosion of
[12:22] morning it sounds like the night is dark
[12:26] and black and bleak and all of a sudden
[12:29] over there on the horizon the Sun begins
[12:33] to peak up over the hill and eventually
[12:36] it becomes like an explosion of light
[12:38] that chases every remnant of the
[12:42] darkness right off the scene amen then
[12:45] shall thy light break forth as the
[12:47] morning and thine help shall spring
[12:50] forth speedily perhaps you're sick and
[12:53] afflicted in your body and you could use
[12:55] some speedily health treatments from the
[12:58] Lord you could use some right now
[13:00] healing well I want you to know he's a
[13:02] right now God he's a known time God and
[13:06] he knows what you have need of right now
[13:09] and he is more than able to do
[13:11] exceedingly and abundantly above that
[13:15] which we could even ask or think and I'm
[13:18] believing God right now for light to
[13:21] shine upon your life and for your health
[13:25] healing and restoration to spring forth
[13:29] speedily and thy righteousness shall go
[13:32] before thee you know we need a revival
[13:35] of righteousness of holiness of purity
[13:38] of living the Word of God moral
[13:41] character right we need for the search
[13:46] for our lifestyle to line up with our
[13:50] vocabulary our conversation sometimes
[13:53] it's Holi but our lifestyle is slack
[13:56] come on now don't leave me don't turn
[13:59] channels now stay with me you know it's
[14:02] right we want to walk you know I mean
[14:06] the most righteous that I can be it's
[14:08] not enough I understand that the most
[14:11] holy that I can be it's not holy enough
[14:14] I understand that that's why we have to
[14:16] surrender to his righteousness that's
[14:20] why we have to plead that that he pour
[14:23] out his holiness and his purity in our
[14:26] life but one of the ways that we become
[14:29] a candidate to receive His righteousness
[14:31] it's by determining to live a life that
[14:34] is disciplined a life that is a
[14:38] sacrificial life a life where we're
[14:40] willing to lay things aside because they
[14:43] hinder our walk with God and they hinder
[14:46] our testimony you know the Bible talks
[14:49] about not letting our good be evil
[14:52] spoken of and and living above reproach
[14:55] my we need a revival of that yes we do
[14:59] but he said thy righteousness shall go
[15:02] before thee help help clearing the way
[15:04] and
[15:05] the glory of the Lord shall be thy
[15:10] rearward not re reward but real word
[15:13] meaning something coming behind you to
[15:18] protect you
[15:19] something coming from the rear to follow
[15:23] you wherever you go I like to say that
[15:26] the glory of the Lord asks my rearward
[15:28] it's not only my protection from behind
[15:31] but it sometimes propels me hit
[15:35] sometimes pushes me have you ever felt
[15:38] like the presence of God was just
[15:40] pushing you to do something because
[15:42] you're too slow to react am I the only
[15:45] person that gets slow and obedient in
[15:48] obedience and obeying the Lord am I the
[15:50] only person that has to have the glory
[15:52] of the Lord come behind me and say get
[15:54] out you know get up and get it over with
[15:56] get it done well some times we need to
[16:00] just do it don't we we need to just get
[16:02] up verse nine then shalt thou call and
[16:05] the Lord shall answer that's the
[16:09] spiritual season that we're walking in
[16:12] we're coming in to that special time now
[16:17] God hears and answers prayers and we
[16:19] know by the scripture that the effectual
[16:22] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[16:23] availeth much but I do believe that
[16:26] there are seasons of heightened
[16:29] spiritual activity I believe that it is
[16:32] important that we carry the anointing to
[16:35] discern the times and the seasons of the
[16:39] Lord and great prophetic voices have
[16:42] been
[16:43] sounding forth around the world warning
[16:47] and telling us declaring to us that
[16:50] we're coming into a season where God is
[16:53] particularly sensitive to the childlike
[16:57] faith to the childlike cries of his
[17:01] people though suddenly swear we've
[17:04] prayed and prayed and interceded and and
[17:07] wrestled with things in the spirit realm
[17:10] holding on and believing God and and
[17:14] waging war until we become weak and then
[17:18] all of a sudden boom boom just a
[17:20] suddenly moment just the the anointing
[17:23] of God the light shines on it your help
[17:26] springs forth speedily your prayer is
[17:29] answered and you say wow I mean it
[17:32] seemed like it was never coming but all
[17:34] when it gets here you know the Bible
[17:36] talks about a woman in travail in
[17:38] childbirth and how how hard it is but in
[17:42] that moment that she is delivered of
[17:45] that child there comes a time when she
[17:47] forgets she really begins to forget the
[17:51] pain in the travail for the joy of being
[17:54] able glory for the joy of being able to
[17:59] hold in her arms that which she has been
[18:02] carrying and many of us right now in
[18:06] this season are spiritually pregnant
[18:09] with a vision and
[18:11] it's costly vision it's something that
[18:15] takes investment and labor both in the
[18:19] natural and in the spiritual a vision or
[18:23] a burden that we've been carrying in the
[18:25] womb of our spirit for some time now
[18:27] with all of health hindrances you know
[18:31] with the enemy doing everything and
[18:34] anything he can to hold us back and to
[18:37] keep us from giving birth to that which
[18:40] the Spirit of God has sown into the womb
[18:44] of our spirit but I believe this is one
[18:47] of those suddenly seasons where we're
[18:49] going to see birth we're going to see
[18:53] the glory for and the reality of what
[18:56] we've been hoping for and praying for
[18:58] and believing for hallelujah somebody
[19:01] ought to be getting excited
[19:02] somebody watching this program all too
[19:05] beginning plugged in about now because
[19:08] it really seems as though we're entering
[19:12] into the new day of the Lord hallelujah
[19:15] the new hour the new season the now
[19:18] release of his spirit and I believe this
[19:20] scripture is intricately tied to this
[19:24] spiritual season although we know it has
[19:27] a natural fulfillment in the nation of
[19:30] Israel but we know that spiritually
[19:33] there is a great sense of heightened
[19:37] spiritual activity angelic visitation
[19:40] the outpouring of signs and wonders and
[19:44] miracles downloads of Revelation
[19:47] heavenly experiences climb the cloud of
[19:51] witnesses
[19:52] people being able to see it over into
[19:56] that other realm or dimension lots of
[19:58] things are happening right now brothers
[20:00] sister if you are stuck somewhere in
[20:03] cold dry formal religion you need to be
[20:09] launched you you need to to get out
[20:12] while you can you need to come into the
[20:15] flow of the Spirit of God Jesus Christ
[20:19] the same yesterday today and forever he
[20:22] changes not and what God's doing for his
[20:25] people today is just like reading the
[20:27] book of Acts and you want to be a part
[20:29] of that you don't want to be a part of
[20:32] lifeless religion you don't want to
[20:35] spend the rest of your life in a funeral
[20:37] you want to be in a revival meeting and
[20:39] that's what God's doing right now
[20:41] absolutely then shalt thou call verse 9
[20:44] and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry
[20:47] and he shall say Here I am look for me
[20:50] no more you don't have to turn over any
[20:53] more rocks or look behind any more doors
[20:55] Here I am I want to show myself
[20:59] hallelujah I want to reveal myself to
[21:02] you you call and I will say Here I am
[21:05] can you imagine Lord where are you in
[21:08] the Lord saying Here I am what what a
[21:11] surprise it would be
[21:13] Moses was praying Oh Lord show us thy
[21:16] glory if your glory doesn't come we want
[21:20] to sit right here we don't want to go
[21:21] anywhere without your glory how many of
[21:23] you have ever been in a place like that
[21:25] in your life I have I just rather sit
[21:29] right here dryer die and blow away than
[21:31] to have to make one decision without the
[21:35] leadership of the Lord I'd rather just
[21:37] wither on the vine than to have to make
[21:40] one step without the divine presence and
[21:44] the glory of God and we're coming into a
[21:48] time
[21:50] when I say that we're coming into that's
[21:52] what I mean we're coming into we're
[21:56] stepping into this season right now
[21:59] we're not prophesying dispensation ly 10
[22:03] years 20 years 50 years a hundred years
[22:05] a thousand years in the future we're
[22:08] prophesying that now is this time now
[22:12] the time has come to arise and shine and
[22:16] let the light of God be manifested in
[22:18] your life right now
[22:20] then shalt thou call and the Lord shall
[22:23] answer thou shalt cry and he shall say
[22:26] Here I am but now there is a
[22:29] prerequisite here in this verse and I'm
[22:31] not gonna skip it it's important it says
[22:34] if thou take away from the midst of the
[22:37] the yoke the bondage the things that
[22:39] hole Jew back and oppress you distract
[22:42] you control you did you know a yoke is a
[22:45] device of control and we don't want to
[22:49] be controlled by anything including
[22:51] religion we want to be controlled or led
[22:54] by only the yoke of the Lord only by the
[22:59] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[23:01] not by man's religion no not by any
[23:06] other kind of bondage or influence but
[23:10] by the leadership of the Lord there's a
[23:11] people oh there's a people coming forth
[23:14] in this hour that are only going to hear
[23:16] from God they're only going to get their
[23:18] marching what now wait a minute I don't
[23:20] mean that we don't have leaders I don't
[23:23] mean that we're not to have the fivefold
[23:25] ministry we must we must have it I'm not
[23:28] talking about that I'm talking about man
[23:30] trying to use his influence and control
[23:33] to
[23:34] dominate and and to take authority and
[23:37] dominion over people to press their will
[23:41] instead of God's will know there are
[23:43] godly men and women who are called up in
[23:45] leadership roles and I know that and I
[23:47] honor them and I respect them and I
[23:49] thank God for them but there's a lot of
[23:51] faults stuff that goes on out there and
[23:53] we're the people of God have fallen
[23:56] victim and prayed to that in the past
[23:57] look out look out because this is a time
[24:01] where we're not going to be so naive
[24:03] anymore no because when we call he's
[24:06] gonna answer when we cry out he's gonna
[24:08] say Here I am and we're gonna be able to
[24:10] go straight to him amen
[24:13] I like that I believe that that's what
[24:15] I'm looking for all right and and he
[24:19] said so if thou take away from the midst
[24:22] of the verse 9 the yoke but putting
[24:24] forth of the finger judging judging
[24:28] being critical being overly religious
[24:33] self-righteous instead of holy there's a
[24:36] difference and speaking vanity
[24:38] foolishness
[24:40] lies
[24:42] lots of things that don't need to come
[24:45] out of our mouth even
[24:46] ridiculous foolishness and so forth I
[24:49] mean it's right in the Bible I'm just
[24:51] reading the book and if now draw out thy
[24:54] soul to the hungry here we go again
[24:56] ministry ministry ministry and
[24:59] satisfy the afflicted soul then shall
[25:04] thy light rise in obscurity what's he
[25:09] saying if you pour yourself out in the
[25:14] measure of
[25:15] responsibility that God has given you
[25:18] your responsibility and authority will
[25:22] increase if you are faithful to meet
[25:25] needs on the level with which you are
[25:29] where you are now the level where you've
[25:33] been called now the the authority that
[25:35] God has released to you now if you're
[25:37] faithful in that level in that arena of
[25:40] ministry if you'll be faithful there
[25:43] even when it looks small even if it
[25:45] looks ridiculous if you'll be faithful
[25:48] in that arena to that measure to that
[25:51] extent then God says your light will
[25:56] rise in
[25:59] obscurity and by darkness the darkest
[26:04] moment of your life shall be as bright
[26:06] as the noonday it sounds like God has a
[26:09] big juicy fat promise for you and I in
[26:14] this verse of scripture verse 11 and the
[26:17] Lord shall god be continually and
[26:19] satisfy thy soul in drought who when
[26:22] others seem like they're dry and parched
[26:25] and can't get a word can't get connected
[26:28] into the Spirit you're going to not be
[26:31] so you're going to have
[26:34] satisfaction in the season of drought oh
[26:39] praise God and make fat by bones and
[26:42] thou shall be like a watered garden
[26:45] glory and like a spring of water whose
[26:49] waters fail not from obscurity to
[26:54] visibility from darkness to light from
[26:57] hidden places to open places instead of
[27:01] the tail-end the last part of the of the
[27:05] pig to get under the fan God said I'll
[27:07] make you the head and not the tail
