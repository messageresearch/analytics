[0:15] I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of New Hope
[0:17] Revival ministries and we've been
[0:19] sharing a little bit about the renewing
[0:21] of the Mind in Ephesians chap 4: 22 in
[0:25] the Amplified Bible it says and be
[0:27] constantly renewed in the spirit of of
[0:30] your mind having a fresh mental and
[0:33] spiritual attitude I I find that more
[0:37] often than not daily on a daily basis I
[0:41] have to check my mental attitude and
[0:44] sometimes even my spiritual attitude you
[0:47] know I remember one time brother
[0:49] brandham was preaching and he said the
[0:51] greatest battle ever fought will be
[0:53] fought on the Battlefield of the Mind
[0:56] and I don't know about you but I can
[0:57] relate to that because that's where my
[0:59] battle is it's a battle over thoughts
[1:02] whose report will I believe will I
[1:05] believe what Satan says about me his
[1:07] lies his accusations his
[1:10] disqualifications or will I constantly
[1:13] choose over and over again to believe
[1:16] what God's word says about me I'm not
[1:20] talking about the power of self-help I'm
[1:22] talking about the power of being helped
[1:25] by God because you've come to your Wit's
[1:28] End you've come to the end of your own
[1:31] ability to fix the way you think and so
[1:34] you cry out to your father the one who
[1:36] loves you the most and you say Lord I
[1:39] need help in putting off my old mind and
[1:43] putting on the mind of Christ in 1 Peter
[1:47] chap 1 verse 13 in King James it says
[1:51] that we should gird up the loin of our
[1:55] minds be sober and hope to the end for
[1:59] the great Grace that is to be brought
[2:01] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[2:04] Christ Amplified Bible says it this way
[2:07] so brace up your minds be sober the
[2:11] complete Jewish Bible says therefore get
[2:14] your minds ready to work work properly
[2:18] work like God created us to work to
[2:20] think and The New American Standard says
[2:23] therefore prepare your minds for Action
[2:27] I want you to know that your mind
[2:29] controls your brain and every thought
[2:33] that you have actually produces or
[2:36] creates a neural Connection in the brain
[2:40] certain chemicals are released when we
[2:43] think a certain way a certain thought
[2:46] when we walk down a certain pathway of
[2:49] thoughts and so this being said it's an
[2:52] important thing to remember when you
[2:54] catch yourself spiraling in your
[2:57] thoughts going back to that old pattern
[3:00] of of believing what the enemy has said
[3:02] about you all of your life when you find
[3:05] yourself making that spiral it's in that
[3:08] moment that you have to raise up in the
[3:10] authority of a holy ghost filled
[3:12] believer and say wait a minute that's
[3:15] not who I am that might have been who I
[3:17] was but that is not who I am I am a new
[3:22] creature in Christ Jesus and I'm not
[3:25] going to believe what you say about me
[3:28] anymore I'm going to agree with God's
[3:31] assessment of who I am I want you to
[3:34] know that it sounds so simple and yet it
[3:37] is so profound because so many of us
[3:40] Believers in this hour are fighting a
[3:43] war within right in our mind a war whose
[3:47] report will we believe I choose today
[3:50] and you must choose with me to guard up
[3:54] to put some reins on your thoughts I
[3:58] mean it's like a wild horse sometime you
[4:00] think one thought that leads to another
[4:02] thought that leads to another thought
[4:04] God by the power of the holy spirit will
[4:07] strengthen you if you'll be conscious of
[4:10] what's happening and if you'll be
[4:11] constant and consistent in your desire
[4:15] and in your discipline to say wait a
[4:17] minute enough is enough greater is he
[4:22] that is in me than he that is in the
[4:25] world so today remember every thought
[4:28] you have is cre creating a reaction and
[4:31] a neural Connection in your brain your
[4:34] body is responding to your thoughts so
[4:38] think on things that are lovely that are
[4:40] pure that are of virtue and of good
[4:43] report and I know it will cause you to
[4:46] have a much better day don't forget if
[4:49] it has to be one second at a Time Sweet
[4:51] Jesus then so be it God bless you
[4:58] today
