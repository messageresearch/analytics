[51:06] Lord I
[51:08] believe will you give the Lord a hand
[51:11] clap of Praise this morning
[51:17] Jesus
[51:18] [Applause]
[51:24] praise the Lord you may be seated it's
[51:26] very tinty I don't know what's happened
[51:28] to the settings but it sounds like an it
[51:31] sounds very aluminum
[51:35] testing one two
[51:38] testing one two
[51:41] Hallelujah
[51:43] You Know The Enemy is mad but he is
[51:46] defeated I don't want to give him much
[51:49] attention
[51:50] we have two brand new microphones top of
[51:53] the line and haven't been able to use
[51:54] them since we bought them
[51:56] this this uh the sound here is terrible
[52:00] this morning it's not it's not Luke's
[52:02] fault it's just things are just kind of
[52:04] out of whack and out of sort but we can
[52:07] pull it back together by the grace of
[52:09] God do without mics if we have to but it
[52:12] sure is frustrating we just need someone
[52:15] with a burden and a vision to help us to
[52:17] get it taken care of but I know God he
[52:20] knows how to do it and we're going to
[52:23] have to send these back I think because
[52:25] just when they get them working again
[52:27] then they they mess up again and you
[52:30] know they're not supposed to do that
[52:31] something's not right would somebody
[52:33] agree with me
[52:34] something's not right
[52:37] you don't spend that kind of money on
[52:39] something and then just let it sit on
[52:40] the shelf and not work for us so we're
[52:43] going to do what we can and believe that
[52:46] God will help us but you know there is
[52:48] victory in my heart you pressed in this
[52:51] morning and Worship the Lord and I know
[52:54] some of you aren't feeling well in body
[52:56] but you worshiped anyway and uh you know
[52:59] that's the only way to get above your
[53:01] circumstances
[53:03] the only way to get above what you're
[53:05] going through right now is to just keep
[53:07] pressing in to him
[53:09] and uh he shifts the atmosphere around
[53:12] us and I'm so thankful for that uh it
[53:15] has been a long week I've had many
[53:17] people reach out to me to say that it's
[53:19] one of the longest weeks of their life
[53:21] after being in church every night and
[53:24] then going a whole week
[53:26] I'm not regretting the decision though
[53:28] because we have seen at least some
[53:31] decline in new cases of flus and strips
[53:35] and whatever else is going around but
[53:38] there are many that have a lingering
[53:40] cough I want that to go I want the Lord
[53:42] to release that and let them have the
[53:45] victory over that if you have ever dealt
[53:47] with one of those lingering hard coughs
[53:50] you know that it's a very difficult
[53:52] thing to deal with and I'd like to see
[53:54] the Lord help each one of them and we
[53:58] want to make sure that we are covering
[54:00] the body in proper prayer because you
[54:03] have you come through a set of meetings
[54:04] like we just had we're vulnerable in the
[54:07] spirit and so you can't you can't stop
[54:10] when the meetings are done you've got to
[54:12] pray more to keep that prayer covering
[54:15] around all of us and we get slack
[54:19] sometime because we get tired or we are
[54:22] on a spiritual high and we forget that
[54:25] the enemy he's not just going to lay
[54:27] down and play dead while we take grounds
[54:29] he's we're going to have to fight for
[54:31] every inch of ground let's wake up
[54:34] to be away
[54:36] we're gonna have to fight for every inch
[54:39] of ground that we take in this hour I
[54:42] read again yesterday where brother
[54:43] random said this is not a picnic
[54:46] this is a Battlefield
[54:49] and I'm so I don't know what we do
[54:51] without prayer what would we do without
[54:53] prayer
[54:55] and uh you know I think some people have
[54:58] never after all the years of preaching
[55:00] and prayer and trying to model it for
[55:02] you I think some people still don't
[55:04] understand that prayer is not just what
[55:06] you do in an emergency
[55:08] when you've got a big need prayer is
[55:10] what you do to maintain what victory you
[55:13] have you got to keep what ground you got
[55:16] and uh you know prayer is not always a
[55:19] give me list either it sometimes it's
[55:22] it's thanking God that's prayer
[55:25] it's praising him for the victories that
[55:28] he has won
[55:29] and sometimes it's just saying Lord help
[55:31] me get through this I've got I've got to
[55:34] get through this with my testimony
[55:36] intact how many of you care about your
[55:39] testimony
[55:40] I care about my testimony and I want to
[55:43] make it with the victory
[55:45] there are people everywhere if I I just
[55:48] cut off the prayer requests because
[55:50] there's so many continue to remember the
[55:53] little uh McGrady baby that God will
[55:55] undertake they're taking some ground he
[55:58] has improved and Mom and Daddy both have
[56:00] got to hold him and uh it's a long
[56:04] journey to get to get to where they need
[56:06] to go but their surgeries ahead and all
[56:09] kinds but you know they didn't they
[56:11] didn't really think he was going to make
[56:12] it and God has sustained them and given
[56:15] them Grace then the his brother's baby
[56:18] was in the hospital in awful shape but
[56:21] God has moved there and then his
[56:23] grandmother this week Sister Janet
[56:25] Rourke a precious very precious friend
[56:29] of ours for over 30 years it has ended
[56:33] up in the hospital and she is facing the
[56:37] age-related issues but it looked like it
[56:40] was kind of becoming a little more acute
[56:42] and she is in the hospital for observe
[56:45] Invasion but we want the Lord to to move
[56:48] for her she's just a real child of God
[56:51] an accordion playing
[56:54] faith-speaking woman of God and I would
[56:57] like to see the Lord just really touch
[56:58] her in this hour We're believing that
[57:01] God will do that also brother Mike
[57:03] altick I don't know if any of you know
[57:05] who that is or not but a pastor in this
[57:08] message and one who travels around quite
[57:10] a bit as a teacher with his wife was in
[57:14] a terrible car accident over the weekend
[57:16] and he was in intensive care with brain
[57:19] bleed and it's a very serious problems I
[57:22] I did not hear this morning anything to
[57:25] know if there has been more Improvement
[57:27] his wife I think has been released from
[57:30] the hospital uh they were on their way
[57:33] to meet with the family in their Church
[57:35] who had lost a loved one and they were
[57:37] planning the funeral when this car
[57:39] accident took place and so we want the
[57:42] Lord to move for him uh he stands in
[57:45] desperate need of prayer God is a is a
[57:48] prayer answering God
[57:50] and uh so again there's a lot of
[57:53] traveling going on this week and there
[57:56] are still lingering symptoms we want
[57:58] victory over all of those and uh we're
[58:01] going to be preaching next Friday night
[58:04] Saturday night and Sunday morning in
[58:07] Morganton North Carolina now I've never
[58:09] been to this church
[58:11] but I've known brother Danny and sister
[58:13] Lisa Adams for over 30 years
[58:16] and this is a mission church and it was
[58:20] initially my understanding and Assembly
[58:23] of God Church
[58:24] and they've been baptized in the name of
[58:27] the Lord Jesus Christ and the people are
[58:29] growing and uh brother Danny and sister
[58:32] Lisa are preaching Jesus to those who
[58:35] come and folks are getting saved and
[58:37] Friday night is going to be dedicated to
[58:40] the young people and then lunch on
[58:43] Sunday and some of the folks here
[58:45] traveling there and that always blesses
[58:48] me but it also puts me in a pool because
[58:51] I want there to be an amazing service
[58:53] here next Sunday I don't want I don't
[58:56] want it to suffer in any way I know that
[58:58] God will show up here and uh but it
[59:02] doesn't happen often that we're like
[59:04] this but we just felt like it was a good
[59:07] opportunity to go and and minister to
[59:09] some folks there are some other churches
[59:11] that have promised to support that
[59:13] meeting so will you just show me a
[59:16] commitment of Prayer by just holding
[59:18] your hand up and just letting me know
[59:20] that you commit to praying for those
[59:21] meetings that God will move and that he
[59:25] will Undertake and I like to see Souls
[59:27] saved and I believe that God is on the
[59:30] Move we won't take time this morning for
[59:34] testimonies some of which could not be
[59:36] told but God has moved during the camp
[59:40] meeting in a profound way and lives were
[59:43] touched and and people encountered the
[59:46] Lord and I'll just mention one and that
[59:49] that is Sister Rebecca's nephew there
[59:52] who the Lord touched in one of the
[59:55] services and I just wanted to encourage
[59:57] him last Sunday and I said I want you to
[1:00:00] know I believe what God did for you was
[1:00:02] real he said I know it was I know it was
[1:00:05] real and the look on his face was so uh
[1:00:09] it's so uplifting and so encouraging to
[1:00:12] know that he had had an encounter with
[1:00:13] God he had a supernatural experience
[1:00:16] where he felt something pulling in his
[1:00:18] inner being between us in prayer and I
[1:00:21] believe God's going to do some wonderful
[1:00:22] things in his life now a lot of sister
[1:00:25] Rebecca's family went home and were sick
[1:00:27] paid an awful price went through all
[1:00:30] kinds of stuff this week
[1:00:32] animal sick all kinds of problems but
[1:00:35] pressing in and uh well it brings out
[1:00:39] sometimes these kind of problems brings
[1:00:41] out faith in in us that we didn't know
[1:00:44] we had
[1:00:45] we've seen that happen we want to give
[1:00:48] God praise for that so we have so much
[1:00:50] to be thankful for in the midst of a lot
[1:00:52] of heartache and a lot of problems
[1:00:54] around us we have so much to be thankful
[1:00:56] for and we want to see what the Lord
[1:00:59] will say to us in his word I want you to
[1:01:02] stay awake
[1:01:04] and it's going to say that just as
[1:01:05] clearly as I know how this morning give
[1:01:07] me that would you and get you some water
[1:01:10] splash your face pitch yourself do
[1:01:13] anything that you need to do this is not
[1:01:15] a place for a nap this is where we're
[1:01:17] going to get what we need to get us
[1:01:19] through the rest of the week
[1:01:21] today was brother branham's wedding
[1:01:23] anniversary with sister Mita and we
[1:01:26] can't help but thank God for the
[1:01:28] sacrifice that she made to help keep
[1:01:30] brother Branham healthy and whole and
[1:01:33] and emotionally stable so that he could
[1:01:36] go out and do the work that God had
[1:01:38] called him to do tomorrow is the
[1:01:40] anniversary of the of the spoken word
[1:01:42] calming the storm and he's still God
[1:01:47] the spoken word is still right
[1:01:50] God's word still stops storms
[1:01:53] if you believe that's amen sister Royale
[1:01:57] is feeling some better sister Weems we
[1:01:59] want to continue to hold them up to the
[1:02:01] Lord in prayer and Tuesday is sister
[1:02:03] royale's birthday so whatever you can do
[1:02:06] to let her know to reach out to her in
[1:02:09] some way and wish her a happy birthday I
[1:02:12] think that would be amazing a Thursday
[1:02:14] is Josiah's birthday so we'll go ahead
[1:02:17] and say happy birthday to you in case we
[1:02:20] should forget between now and then

[1:03:02] in advance and let them all know that we
[1:03:05] love them and appreciate them
[1:03:09] I think that's all
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] I could sing but then I would have to
[1:03:15] cut my preaching down to less than two
[1:03:17] hours so I won't do that we'll we'll go
[1:03:19] right to the word this morning
[1:03:21] are you ready
[1:03:23] let's stand and go to the word of God
[1:03:25] and let's see what the Lord will do for
[1:03:28] us today
[1:03:30] I feel like he wants to talk to us so I
[1:03:32] want to have an ear to hear we greet
[1:03:35] every one of you who are streaming the
[1:03:37] service uh thank you for those of you
[1:03:39] who are letting us know where you are we
[1:03:42] particularly send greetings to the
[1:03:44] precious Saints in Boston God bless you
[1:03:47] all thank you for streaming our service
[1:03:49] today many precious friends are
[1:03:52] represented here and unless you tell us
[1:03:55] where you're from we don't have any way
[1:03:57] of knowing where you're from but we're
[1:03:59] very glad that you are there we've had a
[1:04:03] lot of comments on the camp meeting
[1:04:05] Services those who streamed the services
[1:04:08] and if we were ashamed of the way that
[1:04:11] we worshiped we wouldn't have put it out
[1:04:13] on the internet we would have kept it
[1:04:15] hidden but uh we're not ashamed so just
[1:04:19] just know that we're not ashamed in fact
[1:04:21] we say what David's saying if God will
[1:04:23] give us strength there will be Valor
[1:04:25] wilder than that the next time as long
[1:04:28] as it's for him
[1:04:30] uh as long as no one is trying to see
[1:04:32] just how weird they can get to be weird
[1:04:35] but if you're doing it it's unto the
[1:04:37] Lord you just go right ahead and give
[1:04:39] him praise because he's worthy of Praise
[1:04:42] how many of you believe brother Greeley
[1:04:44] did one of the most outstanding jobs of
[1:04:47] his ministry here let's thank the Lord
[1:04:49] for God using him
[1:04:53] powerful
[1:04:56] Exodus 33 and thank you for the
[1:05:00] adjustments that you all made it's much
[1:05:02] better I don't see Luke now but let him
[1:05:04] know he was working hard and maybe
[1:05:06] others helped him and it's always a lot
[1:05:08] of pressure put on somebody like that
[1:05:10] and I did not in any way mean to
[1:05:13] insinuate that he wasn't doing his best
[1:05:16] uh I knew that something had shifted
[1:05:19] that he didn't have anything to do with
[1:05:20] it appeared but it is much better up
[1:05:23] here now thank you Exodus chapter 33
[1:05:26] beginning in verse 10.
[1:05:30] I want to read 10 and 11 and all the
[1:05:33] people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at
[1:05:40] the Tabernacle door I want you to
[1:05:44] imagine a pillar
[1:05:46] this is a pillar
[1:05:49] this is a faux pillar it's not holding
[1:05:52] up anything but a pillar is elongated
[1:05:56] like this so I want you to picture the
[1:06:00] cloud as a as a cloudy pillar or a
[1:06:03] pillar of cloud I don't want you to see
[1:06:06] it just as a fluffy Cloud that floated
[1:06:08] over the children of Israel it was a
[1:06:10] pillar of Fire
[1:06:12] it was a pillar of cloud
[1:06:15] so so that helps you get a little bit of
[1:06:17] an idea uh it wasn't like ordinary
[1:06:21] fluffy clouds in the sky it wasn't like
[1:06:24] an ordinary campfire but it had an
[1:06:28] unusual shape to it and and hung in an
[1:06:31] unusual way much like we see the pillar
[1:06:35] of fire hanging over brother branham's
[1:06:37] head and uh elongated fire and elongated
[1:06:41] Cloud all the people saw the Cloudy
[1:06:45] pillar stand at the Tabernacle door I
[1:06:49] can just see it in my mind's eye
[1:06:52] and all the people did what
[1:06:56] they rose up and worshiped every man in
[1:07:01] his tent door
[1:07:04] and the Lord spake unto Moses somebody
[1:07:06] tell me how he spoke to Moses
[1:07:09] face to face
[1:07:11] as a man speaketh unto his friend that
[1:07:16] there's no mystical uh I think God is
[1:07:20] saying I I hope God is saying I I feel
[1:07:25] like God is saying No Moses had a
[1:07:29] face-to-face encounter with the Living
[1:07:32] God as two friends would sit together
[1:07:35] and and well communicate their thoughts
[1:07:39] and intentions to one another God was
[1:07:42] communicating with Moses in a way that
[1:07:45] did not require discernment or
[1:07:47] interpretation of what was being said it
[1:07:50] was face to face
[1:07:53] and he turned again into the camp but
[1:07:57] his servant Joshua the son of noon a
[1:08:02] young man departed not out of the
[1:08:06] Tabernacle let's read that verse again
[1:08:07] and the Lord spake unto Moses face to
[1:08:11] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[1:08:14] and he turned again into the camp but
[1:08:17] his servant Joshua the son of noon a
[1:08:21] young man
[1:08:22] departed not out of the Tabernacle when
[1:08:26] God and Moses had finished their
[1:08:30] conversation Moses turned from the
[1:08:33] Tabernacle and made his way into the
[1:08:37] camp but Joshua decided to linger in the
[1:08:42] presence that had just appeared now it's
[1:08:45] powerful
[1:08:46] lingering in the presence of God this is
[1:08:50] how we develop and cultivate intimacy
[1:08:54] with God there can be no Union
[1:08:57] without intimacy
[1:09:00] we're not acquaintances of God we're
[1:09:04] called to be much more than that we're
[1:09:06] called to be more than friends
[1:09:08] we're called to be one with him
[1:09:11] which happens to us by the spirit and I
[1:09:14] think it's important to notice that
[1:09:17] Joshua was the last to leave the
[1:09:21] Tabernacle and Joshua was the first one
[1:09:24] to inherit the promised land so there
[1:09:28] must be some connection between
[1:09:31] cultivating and Desiring to linger in
[1:09:35] the presence of the Lord and in intimacy
[1:09:38] with the Living God and being able to go
[1:09:40] in and take the possession so I like
[1:09:43] that and I want to practice that in my
[1:09:46] own life how about you now verse 12
[1:09:48] through 15 and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:09:52] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[1:09:56] people and thou has not let me know whom
[1:10:00] thou Wilt sin with me yet thou Hast said
[1:10:05] I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also
[1:10:09] found Grace in my sight
[1:10:13] now therefore I pray thee if I have
[1:10:18] found Grace in thy sight
[1:10:20] show me now thy ways thy way
[1:10:28] if I have found Grace in thy sight show
[1:10:33] me now
[1:10:34] thy way
[1:10:37] that I may Know Thee
[1:10:40] that I may find Grace in thy sight
[1:10:46] oh it's powerful prayer and consider
[1:10:50] that this nation is thy
[1:10:56] and he said my presence
[1:11:01] shall go with thee
[1:11:03] and I will give thee rest
[1:11:08] this is a great promise
[1:11:10] and he said unto him Moses
[1:11:13] saying to God
[1:11:15] if thy presence go not with me
[1:11:20] I don't want to go
[1:11:25] I don't want to go anywhere
[1:11:32] up hence paraphrased I'm not going
[1:11:37] if your presence is not going with us I
[1:11:41] have no desire to go how many of you can
[1:11:44] understand that may God add his Blessing
[1:11:48] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:11:50] seated
[1:11:51] God bless you my precious brother in
[1:11:55] Uganda thank you for streaming with us
[1:12:03] of Moses
[1:12:06] he had that kind of relationship with
[1:12:09] God
[1:12:11] Moses told God that he did not know the
[1:12:14] angel that wanted that God wanted to sin
[1:12:17] to lead them on the way
[1:12:19] if you're just going to send an angel to
[1:12:21] lead us
[1:12:23] um
[1:12:25] I'm not interested
[1:12:27] I want you
[1:12:30] I want to go with you
[1:12:33] I want to go where you're going and
[1:12:35] wherever I go I want to know you've gone
[1:12:37] before me I appreciate the angel I
[1:12:41] appreciate all that you have promised
[1:12:43] but I don't have any interest in the job
[1:12:46] unless I can know that your presence is
[1:12:49] going to be with us every step of the
[1:12:51] way how many of you understand that I
[1:12:54] mean do you really understand that
[1:12:56] without God's presence in your marriage
[1:12:59] it's ruined
[1:13:02] without God's presence in your career
[1:13:04] it's ruined
[1:13:06] without God's presence God's presence in
[1:13:09] your home and in your family is ruined
[1:13:12] it's not what it should be it's not what
[1:13:15] it could be it's not what it must be
[1:13:18] without the presence of God he said Lord
[1:13:21] I appreciate that you know my name
[1:13:24] and I appreciate that I have found Grace
[1:13:27] in your sight but either you go with us
[1:13:31] or leave us right here
[1:13:34] we would rather die here with you than
[1:13:39] to progress
[1:13:40] without you
[1:13:42] too many of us have ventured without
[1:13:45] Authority
[1:13:47] and we have assumed to go when God
[1:13:51] wasn't going with us
[1:13:54] Amen brother
[1:13:56] too many of us have got up to do
[1:13:59] something to accomplish something to
[1:14:02] choose something to make something
[1:14:04] happen and we have not realized that God
[1:14:09] wasn't in the arrangements he doesn't
[1:14:11] want to be consulted in the afterwards
[1:14:14] he wants to be consulted in the
[1:14:16] beginning
[1:14:17] leadership is not I'm sending you
[1:14:19] leadership is I'm going to lead you
[1:14:21] there and you follow me so it's
[1:14:25] imperative in this hour that we are able
[1:14:29] to discern where the presence of God is
[1:14:31] going
[1:14:32] because wherever the presence of God is
[1:14:35] going I want to go
[1:14:37] in whatever
[1:14:40] I want to move
[1:14:44] a move God is moving on a particular
[1:14:47] kind of service that's the kind of
[1:14:50] service I want to be a part of
[1:14:52] if the presence of the Lord is moving on
[1:14:55] a certain group of people I want to be
[1:14:57] with those people
[1:14:58] I do I want to be where God's moving can
[1:15:02] he move all over the world he is moving
[1:15:04] anywhere people will let him move he is
[1:15:08] moving but it's too late in the day to
[1:15:11] sit somewhere where God's not moving
[1:15:14] he's a breathing God a living God a
[1:15:17] talking God a walking God
[1:15:20] he's a god of Life he's a god of action
[1:15:23] he's a god of movements
[1:15:26] and wherever the spirit is moving that's
[1:15:28] where we want to move however God's
[1:15:30] moving we want to move in that direction
[1:15:32] we don't want to venture to go without
[1:15:34] him we don't want to assume to stay
[1:15:37] behind him but we want to stay up with
[1:15:39] him in this hour very very important
[1:15:42] it's the most important thing in your
[1:15:46] life
[1:15:47] the most important thing in your life is
[1:15:50] your relationship with that presence
[1:15:54] that's him
[1:15:55] that's not that's not we we don't have
[1:15:57] the presence of God and God
[1:16:00] the presence is God in the room
[1:16:03] God in your life so wherever the
[1:16:06] presence of God is that's where God is
[1:16:09] and I want to be there you know he is is
[1:16:14] crying out to God and he he's saying I
[1:16:18] Want To Know Thy way
[1:16:20] I want to understand the way you're
[1:16:22] moving
[1:16:23] now I want to understand the way you're
[1:16:25] leading and I want to understand the
[1:16:28] direction that you're going in and then
[1:16:31] he said that I may Know Thee I don't
[1:16:36] know about you but I'm getting the same
[1:16:38] impression from Moses that I got from
[1:16:41] the Apostle Paul when he was crying out
[1:16:44] to know the Lord that neither of our
[1:16:46] Brethren were asking for more head
[1:16:49] knowledge
[1:16:50] it doesn't seem to me that either Moses
[1:16:54] or the Apostle Paul were asking for more
[1:16:57] education or more information it seems
[1:17:01] like they were asking for something much
[1:17:04] more personal much more intimate in
[1:17:08] nature you can learn a lot about God but
[1:17:12] that doesn't mean you know who he is
[1:17:14] doesn't mean you know his way there's
[1:17:17] only one way to know the way of God are
[1:17:19] you with me
[1:17:21] there's only one way to know the way of
[1:17:23] God and that's to examine how God has
[1:17:26] moved before us
[1:17:30] because how he has moved before is how
[1:17:33] he's moving now
[1:17:35] he's the same
[1:17:38] yesterday
[1:17:40] and today and forever
[1:17:44] if God ever did it one way one time he's
[1:17:47] bound to do it again that doesn't mean
[1:17:49] he's stuck in some kind of mold that man
[1:17:53] has made for him it means that you can
[1:17:56] learn a lot about God by examining where
[1:17:59] he has been
[1:18:02] what he has done there's a lot to be
[1:18:05] learned in when we study Revival history
[1:18:08] and when we study the way that God has
[1:18:11] dealt with the prophets before us when
[1:18:14] we study the way that God is moved with
[1:18:16] the church before now through the church
[1:18:19] ages we learn a lot about God but we
[1:18:23] don't want to just know about him
[1:18:25] Revelation is not head knowledge
[1:18:28] Revelation is experiential
[1:18:33] when we have a revelation of God it
[1:18:36] means we have experienced a truth in God
[1:18:40] we have touched it it has touched us it
[1:18:45] has become a part of who we are Did You
[1:18:48] Know The Enemy can take a lot of ideas
[1:18:50] out of your head but he can't move your
[1:18:53] Revelation because your Revelation is
[1:18:56] not an idea it's something that the very
[1:18:58] spiritual fibers of your makeup have
[1:19:01] fellowshipped with until you have become
[1:19:03] a part of truth and truth has become a
[1:19:06] part of you that's why we will not be
[1:19:09] moved
[1:19:11] I want you to tell the enemy today I
[1:19:15] will not be moved by the huff and the
[1:19:18] puff and the blow and the threat
[1:19:23] not of the enemy if I'm going to move
[1:19:26] I'm gonna move because God is moving if
[1:19:29] I'm going to progress I'm going to
[1:19:31] progress because God is progressing if I
[1:19:34] stand still I'm Gonna Stand still
[1:19:36] because God is standing still
[1:19:40] we have to make up our minds and we have
[1:19:43] to make a dedication and we have to make
[1:19:45] a commitment and sometimes we have to
[1:19:47] remind the enemy
[1:19:48] sometimes we have to remind ourselves
[1:19:52] I won't be moved
[1:19:54] Hallelujah
[1:19:58] if the mountain bows
[1:20:00] down into the sea if the valley is
[1:20:04] exalted
[1:20:05] if my body should be racked with pain if
[1:20:09] I suffer grief or loss I will not be
[1:20:12] moved
[1:20:13] I'll stand on that word I hope you're
[1:20:16] listening to me
[1:20:18] I hope you're really getting it
[1:20:20] something's coming
[1:20:22] oh yes and you're going to want to know
[1:20:25] that you are unmovable without him
[1:20:28] you're standing on that word and the
[1:20:30] only thing is going to move you is the
[1:20:31] spirit
[1:20:33] the spirit is never going to move you
[1:20:35] off the word
[1:20:36] the spirit's always going to lead you to
[1:20:38] the word the word is not a printed page
[1:20:41] the word is a living reality the word is
[1:20:44] not a CD the word is not an app
[1:20:47] these are all manifestations of the word
[1:20:50] they are ways that we can access the
[1:20:53] word but the word is a living reality
[1:20:55] the word is a person and he walks with
[1:20:58] me and he talks with me and it tells me
[1:21:02] that I'm his own
[1:21:04] you know Moses talked to God face to
[1:21:06] face and Joshua said this moment is too
[1:21:09] good to turn loose of it
[1:21:12] Moses was the one receiving the
[1:21:15] encounter but Joshua said I think I'll
[1:21:18] just linger here in the residual of of
[1:21:21] the encounter that Moses had
[1:21:24] I think I'll just save her how this
[1:21:28] atmosphere is charged with the very
[1:21:31] presence of a living God I think I'll
[1:21:33] just linger here in this place of
[1:21:36] intimacy and Oneness this knowing
[1:21:40] the Bible said that Joseph was espoused
[1:21:44] unto Mary
[1:21:46] but as of yet
[1:21:49] she had known no man
[1:21:52] that word known is the same knowledge
[1:21:56] that the Apostle Paul is asking for in
[1:21:59] the New Testament that I may
[1:22:03] that I may
[1:22:05] know him
[1:22:07] would you give me Philippians 3 verses 8
[1:22:12] through 10.
[1:22:13] in the Amplified Bible it'll take us a
[1:22:16] minute to read all that but let's do it
[1:22:19] he said he yes
[1:22:21] furthermore
[1:22:23] I'd count everything as loss
[1:22:29] compared to the possession of the
[1:22:33] Priceless privilege
[1:22:36] oh the overwhelming preciousness
[1:22:41] they're surpassing worth
[1:22:45] and supreme advantage
[1:22:49] of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:22:55] this is not a mere introduction
[1:22:59] this is not a mere acquaintance
[1:23:03] but Paul is using the same word that is
[1:23:07] used in the New Testament for intimacy
[1:23:12] when when the scripture said she has yet
[1:23:16] knew no man it means that she had not
[1:23:21] given herself
[1:23:23] in a physical or we we might just be
[1:23:27] plain and say sexual way she was a
[1:23:31] virgin and a young maid who had kept
[1:23:35] herself
[1:23:36] pure unto God she had never exposed
[1:23:41] herself or given herself to a man in
[1:23:45] that way why would Paul use the same
[1:23:49] language that I may know him
[1:23:54] that I may be into in it
[1:24:02] intimately
[1:24:04] acquainted
[1:24:06] with him
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:08] that I may be naked
[1:24:12] before him
[1:24:14] that there being nothing
[1:24:16] separating me from Christ are you with
[1:24:20] me
[1:24:21] he sees everything there is
[1:24:24] to see about me because I have presented
[1:24:27] myself Paul is saying oh that I may
[1:24:30] present myself to Christ
[1:24:33] not holding anything back
[1:24:36] but allowing him to see my weakness and
[1:24:39] my strength
[1:24:40] my my victory and my vulnerability
[1:24:45] oh that I may that he may know my words
[1:24:49] and that I may also surrender to him my
[1:24:52] thoughts
[1:24:53] that that he might read my mind and read
[1:24:57] my thoughts and know what I really am
[1:25:00] and who I really am May there be nothing
[1:25:04] between us no clothing no Veil to
[1:25:07] separate us may nothing separate us from
[1:25:10] Christ oh that I may know him that I may
[1:25:14] that I may receive the possession of the
[1:25:17] Priceless privilege the overwhelming
[1:25:20] preciousness the surpassing worth and
[1:25:24] the Supreme advantage of knowing Christ
[1:25:27] Jesus my Lord are you with me
[1:25:31] and of progressively becoming
[1:25:35] oh this is the growth this is the
[1:25:38] abiding in the Vine This is not getting
[1:25:41] to Christ this is staying with Christ
[1:25:43] This is not getting to the word this is
[1:25:46] fellowshipping the word this is
[1:25:49] communing
[1:25:50] with the word this is to progressively
[1:25:55] becoming more deeply and not not surface
[1:26:01] intimacy
[1:26:04] not not not surface
[1:26:07] oh my what a what an hour we live in
[1:26:12] we are allowed
[1:26:14] five thousand
[1:26:17] friends
[1:26:22] on Facebook
[1:26:25] five thousand
[1:26:27] friends
[1:26:29] I have
[1:26:31] 4980 something friends
[1:26:34] and about
[1:26:36] 1800 invitations to be friends
[1:26:40] and if I were to be in trouble
[1:26:45] and I needed to call someone
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:53] how many of those 4 800
[1:26:58] 4987 friends would I be able to call on
[1:27:02] who would come to my rescue
[1:27:05] how many of them would attend my funeral
[1:27:07] how many would come to the hospital to
[1:27:10] pray for my children if they were sick
[1:27:12] do you understand
[1:27:14] I'm not talking about you know knowing
[1:27:17] someone who knows someone who knows
[1:27:19] someone who knows someone who suggested
[1:27:21] I I follow you on Facebook
[1:27:25] I don't even like the word followers
[1:27:28] I'm getting sick of the word influencers
[1:27:32] and I'm getting sick of the word
[1:27:33] followers and I'm following so and so
[1:27:37] and I'm following so and so and I'm
[1:27:40] following so and so where are they going
[1:27:44] where are they leading us
[1:27:46] how important is it really to follow
[1:27:53] I'm not talking about will you friend me
[1:27:56] will you follow me will your heart my
[1:27:59] comment
[1:28:01] will you heart my picture
[1:28:03] will you get mad at me and unhart my
[1:28:06] picture
[1:28:09] don't don't don't act like we don't
[1:28:11] think like this
[1:28:13] do you know who followed me this week
[1:28:16] you know
[1:28:18] all we're guilty
[1:28:20] I said to my wife yesterday by Jason
[1:28:23] Crabb liked my comment
[1:28:28] that makes us feel good
[1:28:31] He Knows My Name
[1:28:34] how much do you think that means
[1:28:39] less than a quarter
[1:28:42] because if I got in trouble and Jason
[1:28:44] Crabb wouldn't come to my rescue
[1:28:48] all right
[1:28:50] then he's not the kind of friend I'm
[1:28:52] talking about here
[1:28:54] when you say I'll be a friend to Jesus
[1:28:57] you sing the old hymn I'll be a friend
[1:29:00] to Jesus
[1:29:02] when you talk about knowing him and
[1:29:04] following him and loving him I'm not
[1:29:07] talking about thumbs up thumbs down
[1:29:10] Harding liking following influencing I'm
[1:29:15] not talking about anything like that I'm
[1:29:17] talking about becoming progressively
[1:29:20] more deeply and intimately
[1:29:24] acquainted with him I wanna know what
[1:29:29] causes his heart to beat fast I want to
[1:29:33] know what causes his heartbeat to slow
[1:29:37] down I want to know what he loves
[1:29:39] because I want to love what he loves I
[1:29:43] want to know what he hates because I
[1:29:46] wanna hate what he hates
[1:29:49] I want to know him
[1:29:52] in in the most intimate
[1:29:59] non-presuming assuming way
[1:30:02] where the rubber meets the road where
[1:30:05] reality is bright and big and in your
[1:30:08] face
[1:30:10] let me read it again
[1:30:12] furthermore I count everything as law
[1:30:15] everything is lost
[1:30:17] compared to the possession of the
[1:30:20] Priceless privilege the overwhelming
[1:30:23] preciousness the surpassing worth
[1:30:26] and supreme advantage of knowing Christ
[1:30:29] Jesus my Lord and of progressingly
[1:30:34] becoming more deeply and intimately
[1:30:37] acquainted with him of perceiving
[1:30:41] and recognizing
[1:30:44] and
[1:30:46] understanding him
[1:30:52] more fully and what
[1:30:56] go back charity let's read that phrase
[1:30:58] again
[1:31:03] of perceiving
[1:31:06] I
[1:31:08] is God in that
[1:31:13] is God doing that
[1:31:19] we
[1:31:21] sovereignty people
[1:31:25] we people who believe in election
[1:31:29] predestination and
[1:31:31] God choosing
[1:31:34] we who believe in the
[1:31:37] Supreme and extreme
[1:31:41] sovereignty of God I'm one of them
[1:31:44] I'm one of them
[1:31:46] I I'm one of them I'm one of them who
[1:31:49] believes that I cannot die
[1:31:54] foreign
[1:32:04] that's extreme
[1:32:06] that's Supreme
[1:32:08] sovereignty
[1:32:10] and yet I want to balance in my life
[1:32:14] it doesn't mean that I can eat all the
[1:32:16] fried chicken I want to
[1:32:19] and it's not going to affect my body
[1:32:22] it doesn't mean that my health is not
[1:32:25] something to consider because I can't
[1:32:27] die without him telling me I'm going to
[1:32:29] die
[1:32:30] oh don't get quiet
[1:32:34] you know it it's like saying well I know
[1:32:37] I'm chosen so I can continue to drink
[1:32:41] myself drunk
[1:32:47] we know what brother Brandon said about
[1:32:49] these things but but none of us want to
[1:32:51] test these theories
[1:32:53] we don't we don't want to we don't want
[1:32:55] to harm ourselves and have to live with
[1:32:59] any less quality of life
[1:33:02] because we didn't value what God valued
[1:33:07] so it's a balance
[1:33:09] help me
[1:33:10] we're balancing life
[1:33:13] we have a tendency sometime to because
[1:33:17] we believe in the sovereignty of God to
[1:33:19] feel that we have no responsibility
[1:33:22] whatsoever
[1:33:24] with the ABS and flows of life
[1:33:28] with the upswings and the downturns of
[1:33:32] life but that is incorrect
[1:33:34] because we are not only living out our
[1:33:37] purpose in God but we are existing
[1:33:42] based on decisions
[1:33:45] that we make along the way we are
[1:33:49] dealing with the consequences
[1:33:53] of decisions that we have made on whims
[1:34:02] assuming that to go forward is always
[1:34:06] the right direction
[1:34:08] but that's not Moses
[1:34:11] Moses said God you've brought us a
[1:34:13] mighty long way
[1:34:15] I'm so thankful that you want to send an
[1:34:18] angel with us
[1:34:19] but I don't even know this angel's name
[1:34:21] I
[1:34:23] am thank you that you want to send an
[1:34:26] angel with us but I'm not in this thing
[1:34:29] for an angel
[1:34:31] if you want me to go I have to know that
[1:34:35] you are going with me I love the
[1:34:38] boldness and the tenacity of Moses I
[1:34:41] love of the fact that he just said no
[1:34:44] sir with all due respect if you don't go
[1:34:49] with us I'm staying right here I'd
[1:34:52] rather die here with you than to go
[1:34:55] forward without you some of us went
[1:34:58] forward without him
[1:35:02] some of us stayed behind when he went on
[1:35:07] some of us like his parents
[1:35:10] we were so carried up in the excitement
[1:35:13] of the moment
[1:35:15] that we went on ahead
[1:35:17] and didn't realize that Jesus had stayed
[1:35:20] behind in the temple talking to the
[1:35:22] doctors and the scribes
[1:35:25] so we wake up one day and we realize
[1:35:27] what am I doing over here and how did I
[1:35:30] get here without Jesus
[1:35:34] and then you let a preacher come and
[1:35:36] make us
[1:35:37] take a second look at things
[1:35:40] and bring a little reality in our lives
[1:35:43] and the first thing that we think about
[1:35:45] doing is justifying ourselves
[1:35:48] and feeling that we really have no blame
[1:35:51] because God is Sovereign I want you to
[1:35:54] understand that this is not intimately
[1:35:56] knowing him
[1:35:59] it's not having relationship with him
[1:36:02] that he's after if if you only relate to
[1:36:05] God as a denominational Christian you
[1:36:09] are never going to overcome in this
[1:36:11] world we live in today the spirit of
[1:36:14] denominationalism has invaded our ranks
[1:36:17] it has tainted our churches it has
[1:36:21] affected the way we do and the way we
[1:36:23] don't do and even when I say we I mean
[1:36:26] those of us who Fellowship around the
[1:36:29] message that that Jesus Christ is the
[1:36:32] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:36:34] those of us who Fellowship around the
[1:36:36] ministry of brother Branham our our
[1:36:38] churches our families our way of doing
[1:36:42] business
[1:36:46] our festivals our Banquets our
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:55] everything that we do
[1:36:58] we must examine it
[1:37:01] is God in this
[1:37:04] before I would give a
[1:37:07] an approval for a youth banquet I wanted
[1:37:09] to know is God in this
[1:37:11] I didn't want to do it because the other
[1:37:15] churches were doing it that is not
[1:37:17] enough for me I'm not trying to be super
[1:37:19] spiritual I'm trying to be sincere here
[1:37:22] that's not enough for me
[1:37:26] you know and and and when even when my
[1:37:28] favorite preacher one of my favorite
[1:37:30] preachers backtracked
[1:37:33] last year and you know sort of
[1:37:38] apologized
[1:37:40] for his stand on Christmas
[1:37:43] because I'm not following him
[1:37:46] I'm following the word
[1:37:49] so that didn't move me
[1:37:51] greatly disappointed me
[1:37:54] but it didn't change my mind
[1:37:56] because I want to stay with the word no
[1:37:59] matter what the cost
[1:38:01] if if Even in our ranks our churches are
[1:38:04] influencing one another and we're not
[1:38:06] being led by the spirit of God in this
[1:38:09] hour then we're not becoming more
[1:38:11] progressively intimately acquainted with
[1:38:14] him we're just following him in the
[1:38:17] denominational mindset
[1:38:21] you know Happy Valley has a fall
[1:38:24] festival so we all need a fall festival
[1:38:30] that's not what I'm interested in
[1:38:33] if God's in it
[1:38:35] if there's something good to be gained
[1:38:37] out of it if the spirit will show up in
[1:38:41] it who doesn't like pumpkin pie
[1:38:47] but I'm not interested in it because
[1:38:50] everybody else is interested in it do
[1:38:53] you understand when I tell you that it's
[1:38:55] too late in the day to follow the trend
[1:38:58] whether it's social media whether it's
[1:39:01] denominational mindset
[1:39:06] you you see we can get noise in the
[1:39:09] denominational churches
[1:39:11] so it's not just noise we're after
[1:39:14] we're after praise and worship that gets
[1:39:18] the job done
[1:39:20] it's not just excitement that produces
[1:39:23] more of a denominational mindset that
[1:39:26] we're after we're looking to be
[1:39:29] delivered from the from the parameters
[1:39:32] and the and and then the the borders of
[1:39:35] the church ages
[1:39:43] because it's not enough
[1:39:46] to navigate
[1:39:48] laodicea will
[1:39:53] let that sink in a moment
[1:39:56] we are pursuing another age
[1:40:01] we are pursuing
[1:40:04] something greater than the seven Church
[1:40:08] ages
[1:40:09] we are pursuing a time that is bigger
[1:40:16] than time it is an eternal day one
[1:40:21] Eternal day where there is no night it's
[1:40:25] not like Ephesus and it's not like
[1:40:28] laodicea it's like something bigger than
[1:40:31] all of that
[1:40:33] brother Branham said my Ministry
[1:40:36] is to forerun
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] what
[1:40:47] great quote
[1:40:49] that's not the one I'm looking for but
[1:40:51] it's powerful and it's true
[1:40:53] he said I have come
[1:40:55] to forerun
[1:40:57] the coming of the word
[1:41:00] my Ministry is to forerun the word
[1:41:09] if you follow along in the message
[1:41:14] he calls it the word in Bride form
[1:41:20] he calls it Christ
[1:41:23] in Bride form
[1:41:25] he calls it a coming of Christ
[1:41:29] in Bride form brother sister this is
[1:41:32] powerful
[1:41:34] to to think that the word is coming in
[1:41:39] Bride form
[1:41:41] to think that there is a coming of
[1:41:44] Christ in in Bride form
[1:41:47] it's bigger than anything in laodicea
[1:41:51] it's bigger than anything that's going
[1:41:54] on in the mission movements of the
[1:41:57] denominational systems it's it's so much
[1:42:00] more than that
[1:42:03] so if we desire to become progressively
[1:42:07] more deeply and intimately acquainted
[1:42:10] with him of perceiving
[1:42:13] is God in this
[1:42:15] well we have camp meeting every year is
[1:42:18] God in this
[1:42:21] well all the circumstances have lined up
[1:42:24] is God
[1:42:27] in this do you understand we've always
[1:42:29] have a youth meeting is God in this
[1:42:32] but this is the way we've always done it
[1:42:34] is God in this
[1:42:36] you know it's possible that God has been
[1:42:38] in it all along but right now it's
[1:42:40] possible that he says you do that you're
[1:42:43] on your own
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:45] because you see we're going to come to a
[1:42:47] time where we begin to realize that what
[1:42:50] God anointed in laodicea
[1:42:55] I'm just you know what I'm doing this
[1:42:57] morning I'm just testing the water
[1:43:00] I'm just seeing who's with me because I
[1:43:02] want to go somewhere but I'm not going
[1:43:04] by myself
[1:43:06] I want to know you're ready to go
[1:43:09] amen I mean that and what what better
[1:43:11] morning than one where we're already
[1:43:12] struggling with sickness already
[1:43:14] fighting some emotions with things going
[1:43:16] on and a lot of our congregation out so
[1:43:20] why don't we just jump in here for for a
[1:43:22] real experiment
[1:43:24] and let's see if anybody is really ready
[1:43:27] to see what God is going to put his
[1:43:30] Spirit on in these last days
[1:43:32] I tell you he's going to put his Spirit
[1:43:35] on individuals
[1:43:37] on individuals who desire to know him to
[1:43:43] be intimately acquainted with him to
[1:43:47] become progressively more deeply and
[1:43:50] intimately acquainted with him of
[1:43:52] perceiving
[1:43:54] this is God this is not God God has done
[1:43:58] that he's blessed that before but he's
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] it reminds me of something sister Ruth
[1:44:07] said
[1:44:09] and she said we get in this rut
[1:44:12] in a Revival meeting
[1:44:15] maybe you can't receive this because a
[1:44:17] woman said it I can
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:24] she said we get in this rut
[1:44:27] and
[1:44:29] we come to church and we sing a song and
[1:44:32] God falls on that song
[1:44:35] and so we come back the next service we
[1:44:38] sing the same song
[1:44:41] we hold our mouth the same way
[1:44:44] raise our hand the same way
[1:44:47] we try it like Papa used to say you know
[1:44:50] you're not you're not I'm not catching
[1:44:52] any fish Papa I'm not Captain anybody
[1:44:54] you're not holding your mouth the right
[1:44:56] way
[1:44:57] so all of us kids would go
[1:45:01] trying to determine which way to point
[1:45:02] our tongue so we could catch a fish how
[1:45:06] many of you know it didn't work that way
[1:45:09] so we're like that sometimes as
[1:45:11] Christians we come to church we want to
[1:45:13] hold our tongue the right way we think
[1:45:15] we sing the same song I came to the
[1:45:18] front the last song so I better go the
[1:45:20] front this time I I I waved a purple
[1:45:24] pink polka dotted Banner the last time
[1:45:26] and God really blessed that so I better
[1:45:28] wave the same Banner
[1:45:30] oh I had all my black shoes last time
[1:45:33] better go change
[1:45:36] don't tell me don't tell me don't tell
[1:45:38] me that we sometimes subconsciously
[1:45:42] operate like this this is a church age
[1:45:45] mentality this is laodicea we're not
[1:45:49] moving in that realm we're coming higher
[1:45:52] into a closer relationship with the word
[1:45:56] and we've got to be ready
[1:46:02] we've we've had some
[1:46:04] hard transitions in the past
[1:46:09] we used to have sunrise services
[1:46:12] and I remember when I
[1:46:15] said we're not going to have sunrise
[1:46:16] services anymore every person that was
[1:46:19] ever touched in a sunrise service
[1:46:22] grieved
[1:46:27] grieved
[1:46:29] you don't have to be in a sunrise
[1:46:30] service
[1:46:32] to be touched
[1:46:34] you got saved in a sunrise service
[1:46:37] praise God for that you don't have to
[1:46:39] wait till you get in a sunrise service
[1:46:40] to get the Holy Ghost
[1:46:43] you know I think God sometimes just
[1:46:45] comes in and likes to throw us all out
[1:46:47] of the nest
[1:46:49] and change things up and see who's ready
[1:46:52] to fly and who's ready to die
[1:46:55] come on
[1:46:57] and so we have to pull everybody through
[1:46:59] that transition of not having a sunrise
[1:47:02] service and so many times through the
[1:47:06] years to introduce any kind of change
[1:47:09] become so difficult for those of us who
[1:47:13] don't like change and that's all of us
[1:47:15] yeah
[1:47:17] I'm not listening to what you're saying
[1:47:19] I'm I'm remembering how we operate
[1:47:22] and none of us really like change but I
[1:47:25] want you to understand A change is
[1:47:26] coming
[1:47:27] I want you to know that A change is
[1:47:30] coming I want you to know that A change
[1:47:33] is coming I want you to understand that
[1:47:37] A change is coming and and if you if
[1:47:40] you're too attached
[1:47:44] or if you think God can't move unless
[1:47:46] you sing a certain song
[1:47:50] come on
[1:47:53] or we can't have Fellowship unless we do
[1:47:56] it on the volleyball court
[1:48:09] it's so easy to miss
[1:48:13] or we can't have camp meeting without a
[1:48:15] guest speaker
[1:48:21] we don't want to be attached to anything
[1:48:23] so deeply
[1:48:25] so dearly that if God said I'm not
[1:48:28] moving on that anymore we can't turn it
[1:48:30] loose oh God help me I want to turn it
[1:48:32] loose I do I want to turn it loose I
[1:48:35] want to turn it loose what if what if
[1:48:37] the spirit of the Lord were to say I
[1:48:38] want you to have Tuesday Wednesday
[1:48:39] Thursday night service
[1:48:41] [Music]
[1:48:44] I know we would do it
[1:48:47] and I know most of us would be here but
[1:48:50] some would come gritting their teeth
[1:48:53] America
[1:48:58] I'm here
[1:49:03] it's not compliance
[1:49:06] I'm going to tell you something some of
[1:49:08] you are going to have a bigger shake-up
[1:49:09] than others
[1:49:11] because some of you aren't doing so well
[1:49:13] in this season I'm not sure where you're
[1:49:15] going to be in the next one
[1:49:18] because if you've not done well with the
[1:49:20] stretching of this last season I'm not
[1:49:22] so sure that you'll quickly embrace the
[1:49:25] stretching of the next season but I'm
[1:49:28] telling you change is imminent
[1:49:30] it's here and God's going to show
[1:49:32] himself powerful and he's going to show
[1:49:35] himself strong and he's going to show
[1:49:37] himself Mighty and he's going to find
[1:49:39] the people who follow the cloud the
[1:49:42] pillar the pillar of cloud cloudy pillar
[1:49:44] and those who will follow the fiery
[1:49:46] pillar and those who follow the moving
[1:49:48] of the spirit and those who will just
[1:49:50] get bold in their relationship with God
[1:49:53] and say with all due respect sir if
[1:49:56] you're not going with me I refuse to go
[1:50:00] can't go without you
[1:50:04] hey
[1:50:07] God says yes you can
[1:50:10] so then you have to get even more real
[1:50:12] than that and you say Okay I can
[1:50:15] but I don't want to
[1:50:17] I only want to move when you're moving I
[1:50:21] only want to adapt to what you're
[1:50:22] changing I won't only want to embrace
[1:50:25] what you're put are you with me
[1:50:27] what you're putting your spirit on no
[1:50:30] matter what it looks like
[1:50:32] you see I gotta go on
[1:50:35] perceiving knowing knowing if this is
[1:50:38] God in the room
[1:50:40] are not God
[1:50:42] you know I don't care folks I don't care
[1:50:45] if we've never seen it before
[1:50:47] I want to know if God's in it
[1:50:55] God's in it I don't have to have ever
[1:50:58] seen it before
[1:50:59] my knowing is limited my experience is
[1:51:02] limited and I feel like I've seen about
[1:51:04] everything but but if if he shows up and
[1:51:07] is doing something in a way and moving
[1:51:09] in a way that I I'm not accustomed to I
[1:51:11] want to perceive immediately this is God
[1:51:15] and you better get with it or get out of
[1:51:17] the way you better follow it or move
[1:51:20] over
[1:51:22] because as we sung recently the world
[1:51:24] has seen the last
[1:51:26] of the meek and lowly Jesus
[1:51:31] you know this is what's so ridiculous
[1:51:33] about the the world and the church world
[1:51:36] today is they're trying to introduce on
[1:51:39] a yearly basis the world to A Jesus who
[1:51:43] never who does not exist anymore
[1:51:47] so what do you mean he doesn't exist
[1:51:49] anymore he is no longer a baby in a
[1:51:51] Manger he will never be a baby in a
[1:51:53] Manger again he is not blessed or
[1:51:56] pleased or excited or thrilled
[1:51:59] by you putting him in a Manger every
[1:52:01] year
[1:52:06] the church is doing it but he God wants
[1:52:08] nothing to do with it
[1:52:11] pointing people back to what I was
[1:52:13] I don't want you pointing people back to
[1:52:15] my first coming I want them to be able
[1:52:18] to recognize me when I come the next
[1:52:20] time and the next time I'm not coming
[1:52:23] like a little only baby in the manger
[1:52:25] I'm coming as king of kings and Lord of
[1:52:28] lords I'm coming to rule the nations
[1:52:31] with a rod of iron I'm coming to set up
[1:52:34] a kingdom that shall never ever cease to
[1:52:37] exist I'm coming to occupy the Throne of
[1:52:40] King David
[1:52:42] the Eternal Throne the one that will
[1:52:44] never pass away I'm coming to take my
[1:52:47] place but the world just wants to bring
[1:52:50] people back to the warm and fuzzies
[1:52:55] it is right
[1:52:58] warm and fuzzies
[1:53:03] Courier and Ives
[1:53:09] in the meadow we can build a snowman
[1:53:13] and pretend that he is Parson Brown
[1:53:16] and if he says are you married we'll say
[1:53:19] no sir but you can do the job when
[1:53:22] you're in town
[1:53:25] he's not coming in warm and fuzzy he's
[1:53:28] not coming in a courier and Ives
[1:53:31] Christmas card
[1:53:32] he's not coming that way the next time
[1:53:35] he comes
[1:53:37] he's coming as king of kings and Lord of
[1:53:40] lords
[1:53:42] they don't want you to spend so much
[1:53:44] time looking for the next coming that
[1:53:46] you miss this coming
[1:53:48] because folks this coming right now this
[1:53:51] coming is the most important coming for
[1:53:53] the bride
[1:53:54] this he's coming in the fullness of his
[1:53:57] word he's coming in Bride form
[1:54:03] he's coming to reflect himself in US
[1:54:07] and so whatever it takes to become more
[1:54:09] uh deeply and intimately acquainted with
[1:54:12] him of perceiving and recognizing and
[1:54:15] understanding we're moving on perceiving
[1:54:18] and recognizing and understanding him
[1:54:20] what more fully and what clearly for his
[1:54:25] sake
[1:54:27] I have lost everything
[1:54:29] and consider it all to be rubbish refuse
[1:54:34] dreads
[1:54:37] King James says done
[1:54:43] let me come over here and say that the
[1:54:47] Apostle is saying it's all just poop
[1:54:52] don't forget I said it
[1:54:57] it means nothing
[1:54:58] yeah
[1:55:00] it comes it goes
[1:55:06] I pass it I flush it
[1:55:09] I know I know I know I know it's playing
[1:55:11] I get it
[1:55:13] but that's what he said
[1:55:15] it's done thank you Amplified it's
[1:55:18] refuse it's it's garbage it's a Kleenex
[1:55:21] that you blowed your nose in and you
[1:55:23] throw it in the trash can but I I like
[1:55:26] the King James he's just saying it has
[1:55:28] no real value
[1:55:31] everything I had everything I owned
[1:55:34] everything I've achieved all my
[1:55:35] successes all my trophies all my
[1:55:38] accolades
[1:55:39] my successful home my successful
[1:55:41] business my successful family none of it
[1:55:44] matters
[1:55:45] it's all just garbage
[1:55:47] I'm willing to lose it all again and
[1:55:50] again and again
[1:55:52] like Lanny Wolfe wrote Whatever It Takes
[1:55:57] I'll trade Sunshine for rain sickness
[1:56:01] for pain so don't complain about the flu
[1:56:05] come on
[1:56:08] take the dearest things to me
[1:56:12] if that's how it must be
[1:56:18] I want to place my whole life in your
[1:56:21] hands
[1:56:23] that I may win
[1:56:26] gain
[1:56:28] Christ
[1:56:30] that I may have him
[1:56:33] that I may live in him
[1:56:35] that I may breathe in him that I may
[1:56:38] move in him nothing else matters
[1:56:41] we say it often nothing else matters but
[1:56:44] we don't live like nothing else matters
[1:56:46] come on I'm not I'm not condemning
[1:56:49] anybody I said we we don't live like
[1:56:52] nothing else matters you just let
[1:56:54] something happen to our Thanksgiving
[1:56:56] plans
[1:56:59] and see if Christ is all that matters
[1:57:02] you just let somebody forget our
[1:57:05] birthday and see if Christ is all that
[1:57:07] matters
[1:57:07] come on folks you just see if we don't
[1:57:10] get the shift we want if Christ is all
[1:57:13] that matters
[1:57:14] it's it's it's not enough to say it
[1:57:18] we're going to have to come to a place
[1:57:20] where we mean it
[1:57:22] to have him to have his favor
[1:57:25] to have his pleasure
[1:57:27] to know that I've done something to know
[1:57:30] that I've said something that pleased
[1:57:32] him
[1:57:35] you think how tragic it is and painful
[1:57:38] it is to recognize that we have
[1:57:41] disappointed him
[1:57:43] and then you think about how joyous it
[1:57:45] is
[1:57:47] how strengthening it is to know
[1:57:52] I'm pleased
[1:57:55] and so when you look after a week of
[1:57:58] meetings like we've had and people are
[1:58:00] sick and children are vomiting on the
[1:58:02] glass doors
[1:58:04] and strep is running rampant and we get
[1:58:07] the call that says the
[1:58:09] you know the last child that was on my
[1:58:12] leg
[1:58:13] has strep and flew and I haven't even
[1:58:16] started preaching yet
[1:58:19] all these things that come up
[1:58:22] the lingering costs
[1:58:24] the allergic reactions to antibiotics
[1:58:28] all the things that happened when the
[1:58:31] enemy's mad
[1:58:33] we have to come to a place where we
[1:58:35] realize that every bit of that junk
[1:58:41] is worth it
[1:58:43] yeah
[1:58:45] to know that we've said something that
[1:58:49] we've done something
[1:58:53] to see the look on sister Claudia's face
[1:58:55] Tuesday night was a week ago as God came
[1:58:59] and drove something out of her life
[1:59:02] and gave her a piece that she said was
[1:59:04] was a unprecedented
[1:59:07] don't you think that's worth all the
[1:59:11] weak of hell that you have to go through
[1:59:14] sometime well y'all better be more worth
[1:59:17] it if it was me that got it you've got
[1:59:19] to come to a place where it means as
[1:59:22] much for God to help somebody else to
[1:59:25] help somebody else's children
[1:59:30] oh God just help somebody's loved one
[1:59:35] [Applause]
[1:59:36] we've got to come to the place where we
[1:59:39] can celebrate somebody else's promotion
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:45] like I often mention about sister
[1:59:47] Heather and brother Dwayne and how they
[1:59:50] celebrated
[1:59:53] several times I reached out to them
[1:59:57] because I knew that their hearts were
[2:00:00] aching and their arms felt empty
[2:00:04] they wanted a baby
[2:00:09] and I knew I knew some situations I'd
[2:00:12] been involved in some situations where
[2:00:15] relatives of little babies born in their
[2:00:17] family wouldn't even hold the baby
[2:00:22] because they wanted one of their own
[2:00:25] so they wouldn't hold
[2:00:28] the little nephew or the little niece
[2:00:31] and I'm thinking oh my goodness how
[2:00:33] bitter how bitter how painfully bitter
[2:00:36] that is oh you can never posture I feel
[2:00:40] something stirring in me uh you could
[2:00:43] never posture yourself for the favor of
[2:00:45] God
[2:00:46] by mistreating somebody's child because
[2:00:50] you long for one of your own does that
[2:00:53] make sense in anybody's world oh my
[2:00:58] and yet I would see Heather she would
[2:01:01] buy the nicest gift
[2:01:07] first one to congratulate
[2:01:09] and anybody else it was believing for a
[2:01:12] long time for children
[2:01:14] she would find some little
[2:01:17] crafty
[2:01:19] creative way
[2:01:22] a little plaque or a little saying or a
[2:01:24] little gift to encourage somebody to
[2:01:27] keep believing and it impressed me more
[2:01:29] than once until I had to reach out and
[2:01:31] say oh this is the right posture God
[2:01:34] this pleases God if we can celebrate for
[2:01:38] somebody else if we can stand in
[2:01:40] agreement with somebody else we position
[2:01:43] ourselves to receive even more from the
[2:01:46] Lord
[2:01:50] if we can give an offering knowing
[2:01:56] that we need that money
[2:01:58] more than the one we're giving it to
[2:02:01] but we give it in the name of the Lord
[2:02:06] cup of cold water to a prophet in the
[2:02:08] name of a prophet
[2:02:12] if we can do that
[2:02:16] if we could bring ourselves to
[2:02:20] pay for somebody else's car wash
[2:02:25] when we need one worse ourselves
[2:02:29] when we can position ourselves like this
[2:02:33] we're learning the heartbeat of God
[2:02:40] not just a courtesy amen I want you to
[2:02:42] know what you're saying
[2:02:45] the more we draw close to him the more
[2:02:49] we lay our head on his chest
[2:02:53] you men are going to have to get over
[2:02:55] this
[2:02:56] this whole
[2:02:58] gender thing
[2:03:01] you could call me anything you want to
[2:03:03] call me you could consider in you could
[2:03:05] think anything you want to think about
[2:03:07] me
[2:03:08] but I'm the happiest
[2:03:10] when I know that I have placed my head
[2:03:13] on his chest
[2:03:15] and he has put his arm around my
[2:03:18] shoulder and Drew me to himself
[2:03:22] there's nothing gay about that
[2:03:25] there's nothing homosexual about that
[2:03:29] it's the life of a believer
[2:03:31] we have to get over this kind of a
[2:03:33] concept
[2:03:35] I want to become intimately acquainted
[2:03:37] with him and this is not something dirty
[2:03:39] it's not something vulgar it's to become
[2:03:43] so in tune
[2:03:46] so in Union so in Oneness
[2:03:51] with what he wants
[2:03:56] oh
[2:03:58] it's like you young people
[2:04:01] going back to volleyball
[2:04:05] you're out on the court and you said
[2:04:07] doesn't really matter how who wins
[2:04:10] just save your life
[2:04:15] don't lie
[2:04:19] it does matter to you
[2:04:23] I loved it when
[2:04:25] Saturday there were
[2:04:27] a lot of games going on and there were
[2:04:30] younger ones and there were girls and
[2:04:33] there were boys and there were good
[2:04:35] players and bad players and
[2:04:38] and the reports kept coming back and
[2:04:40] said you know what nobody just nobody
[2:04:42] was ill and nobody was
[2:04:45] nobody was
[2:04:47] agitated and it just didn't really
[2:04:49] matter and it was all kind of random
[2:04:54] and we just enjoyed one another's
[2:04:56] company
[2:04:58] that was Saturday
[2:05:00] and then Sunday comes
[2:05:06] I've prayed all week
[2:05:08] I've asked the Lord for a solution
[2:05:13] because I'm done with being embarrassed
[2:05:16] by Young people's behavior
[2:05:19] and young married couples Behavior
[2:05:23] on the church parking lot
[2:05:29] something's wrong
[2:05:33] it's not what it's about
[2:05:38] I totally Embrace this concept if you're
[2:05:42] going to do anything you ought to do the
[2:05:44] best you can or stay out of the way
[2:05:47] I fully preach that Doctrine
[2:05:51] if you don't really want to play sit
[2:05:53] down
[2:05:56] see God told me he was going to use
[2:05:58] volleyball
[2:05:59] that's why we still have it
[2:06:03] he was going to use it for some folks
[2:06:07] he didn't tell me who
[2:06:09] he was going to use it for some folks
[2:06:12] if you don't want to play don't play
[2:06:17] if you're not going to give everything
[2:06:18] you've got to give
[2:06:20] don't play sit
[2:06:23] watch
[2:06:25] Twitter your thumbs
[2:06:27] If You're Gonna Play you ought to give
[2:06:29] it everything you've got
[2:06:31] and if you lose you're just lost
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:37] you've got this sense of I did my best
[2:06:41] if you can't do that out there you won't
[2:06:44] do that in life
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:48] there are too many people in this church
[2:06:50] that step over the piece of trash
[2:06:53] good morning
[2:06:59] you know the picture that goes around on
[2:07:01] social media
[2:07:04] of I I don't know how people live that
[2:07:07] close to each other
[2:07:09] but it's a duplex
[2:07:11] you know you can reach out your door and
[2:07:13] into somebody else's door
[2:07:15] that's pretty close
[2:07:17] there's a nice set of wide steps coming
[2:07:20] down
[2:07:21] and someone has
[2:07:24] meticulously
[2:07:26] cleared half the steps
[2:07:33] I'm telling you folks you may think that
[2:07:35] doesn't matter I'm telling you that
[2:07:38] matters to God
[2:07:46] sure it takes a little longer
[2:07:49] sure it takes longer and I I'll tell you
[2:07:51] what if you've got any kind of back or
[2:07:53] leg or sciatic issues stooping is not
[2:07:56] your favorite chore
[2:08:01] but no one should walk past a water
[2:08:04] bottle that's been discarded
[2:08:09] or a piece of trash that's been thrown
[2:08:12] around
[2:08:15] because there's someone else to come
[2:08:17] along and get it or because you think in
[2:08:19] your mind maybe someone is paid to pick
[2:08:22] that up
[2:08:23] not anybody I know around here
[2:08:28] if you will step over something like
[2:08:30] that you're the kind of person that
[2:08:32] won't give your best
[2:08:39] if you're that kind of person that would
[2:08:42] clear half the steps
[2:08:46] and then watch to see if the neighbor
[2:08:48] walks down your side of the steps
[2:08:53] I can assure you right now this is not
[2:08:56] to condemn it's to help you
[2:08:59] I believe in being on time for church
[2:09:06] I know there are circumstances that we
[2:09:09] can't
[2:09:10] help
[2:09:12] but there are also sometimes
[2:09:14] circumstances that we arrange
[2:09:19] help me
[2:09:21] the reason why I think it matters is
[2:09:23] because it carries over to the rest of
[2:09:26] our life
[2:09:28] if we constantly make excuses for our
[2:09:31] slackness it follows us through every
[2:09:34] aspect of our lives at some point we
[2:09:38] have to say
[2:09:43] I want to give all
[2:09:45] I want to get my best
[2:09:48] when you've done your best and you can't
[2:09:51] make it on time God knows that you don't
[2:09:55] know anybody an explanation
[2:09:58] only you know
[2:10:01] only you know if you saw the trash
[2:10:06] only you know only you know and no one
[2:10:09] is here to judge you I'm just saying
[2:10:12] these things matter
[2:10:15] and the more we discover of him and we
[2:10:20] spend more time laying our head on his
[2:10:23] chest I'm afraid we're going to be
[2:10:25] shocked
[2:10:27] because we're gonna find out the things
[2:10:30] that we didn't think he cared about
[2:10:36] he really did
[2:10:38] and we go
[2:10:40] he does
[2:10:43] so I encourage you don't be satisfied
[2:10:47] with Where You Are
[2:10:49] don't be satisfied with what you have
[2:10:53] I mean in him with him pursue more of
[2:10:58] God because there's more to be had
[2:11:01] pursue an intimate and deeper
[2:11:03] relationship that that you would be able
[2:11:06] to perceive him
[2:11:08] and understand him more fully and more
[2:11:11] clearly as you go along for his sake
[2:11:15] I've lost everything and considered all
[2:11:18] to be mere rubbish Refuge dregs in order
[2:11:20] that I may win gain Christ the anointed
[2:11:22] one
[2:11:26] if you lose you lose
[2:11:30] you can walk away knowing you did your
[2:11:34] best and that feels good
[2:11:38] if someone has cheated
[2:11:41] if someone has been unfair
[2:11:43] it blows my mind
[2:11:46] to think that God's children
[2:11:49] would want to cheat one another
[2:11:52] in anything
[2:11:57] I had a first cousin
[2:12:01] and I would be at this in fact strangely
[2:12:04] enough I dreamed about his mother last
[2:12:06] night
[2:12:06] I hadn't dreamed of her in a long time
[2:12:09] but I had her first cousin his name was
[2:12:11] Kenny
[2:12:12] Kenny if you're watching this it's the
[2:12:14] truth
[2:12:15] I hope you're no longer like this
[2:12:20] but he'd say to me Steve
[2:12:23] help you want some milk oh yeah well
[2:12:25] sure I yeah I guess I'll take some milk
[2:12:27] sure I'll have some milk
[2:12:30] and he would go to the refrigerator he
[2:12:32] would get two glasses he would pour milk
[2:12:34] in both of them and then he would lift
[2:12:37] them up
[2:12:39] to see which one was the fullest
[2:12:45] oh this is so close to home
[2:12:51] I'm preaching to this house
[2:12:56] we'll take my time now
[2:13:00] I was raised
[2:13:02] similar
[2:13:05] except my mother always said
[2:13:08] give the other person
[2:13:11] the one that's Fuller
[2:13:14] they'll notice
[2:13:20] it must be true
[2:13:22] because every time my cousin would cheat
[2:13:24] me out of a sip or two I noticed
[2:13:27] I never said a word
[2:13:29] I don't think I ever mentioned it to him
[2:13:31] sorry
[2:13:35] I don't know if I ever mentioned it to
[2:13:37] him or not but I knew in my mind that
[2:13:39] this was a flaw that would follow him
[2:13:43] the rest of his life
[2:13:45] unless he made a conscious decision I'm
[2:13:48] not going to be that person anymore what
[2:13:49] should he have done I wouldn't mind I
[2:13:51] didn't it didn't really matter a sip of
[2:13:53] milk is not a big to do
[2:13:56] but if he wanted to be a fair and equal
[2:13:59] person he would have taken them and
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:05] like parents have to do for their
[2:14:07] children
[2:14:10] you're standing here all day trying to
[2:14:11] get even
[2:14:13] so nobody feels bad
[2:14:15] come on
[2:14:17] somebody
[2:14:19] ought to corrected that boy his parents
[2:14:21] his grandparents somebody ought to say
[2:14:23] don't live your life less
[2:14:28] after a few extra sips of milk
[2:14:31] give it to somebody else
[2:14:35] it'll always come back to you give and
[2:14:38] it shall be given unto you press down
[2:14:41] shaken together and running over and men
[2:14:44] will give to your bosom don't be selfish
[2:14:49] so to me
[2:14:51] the concept that Believers could cheat
[2:14:54] one another
[2:14:56] whether it's
[2:15:01] I'm not going to say that
[2:15:05] in any way
[2:15:07] whether it's fun on the on the on the
[2:15:09] parking lot of whether it's in life
[2:15:13] it disturbs me greatly
[2:15:16] if you won fair and square and we have
[2:15:18] you all have I'm sure you have many
[2:15:20] times you can walk away knowing we won
[2:15:24] we outwitted
[2:15:26] we out smacked
[2:15:30] with the ball and not our tongues
[2:15:34] we just outperformed and we won and we
[2:15:36] can walk off with a strut
[2:15:39] because we won
[2:15:40] not rubbing into anybody else's face
[2:15:42] just just the personal pride of knowing
[2:15:45] we want
[2:15:46] but if you stack something or cheat
[2:15:48] something or take advantage of a
[2:15:50] particular situation
[2:15:54] or you don't take into consideration
[2:15:56] these kinds of things
[2:15:59] I don't know how you could live with
[2:16:00] yourself
[2:16:02] and it worries me
[2:16:04] I worry about people on their job
[2:16:08] I wonder how many staplers you have at
[2:16:10] your house
[2:16:11] that belong to your boss
[2:16:17] I wonder how many boxes of paper clips
[2:16:19] you took home with you
[2:16:22] Ben it's been been got any car parts
[2:16:24] laying around
[2:16:26] checking
[2:16:28] check him
[2:16:30] you don't want that kind of flaw
[2:16:33] operating in your life
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:37] and the last thing you want to do is
[2:16:40] embarrass Christ
[2:16:45] you don't want to end a series of
[2:16:47] meetings like we had
[2:16:50] by embarrassing yourself the church
[2:16:54] in front of guests
[2:16:59] help me Pastor yes that's exactly why
[2:17:01] I'm here
[2:17:03] because I believe that the closer we get
[2:17:06] to Christ the least
[2:17:09] the less
[2:17:10] these other things matter
[2:17:13] that I may win him that I may have him
[2:17:16] we get so worked up in what other people
[2:17:18] think about us
[2:17:23] there's a cure for that you're never
[2:17:25] going to stop people from talking about
[2:17:27] you but you could quit doing so many
[2:17:29] dumb things
[2:17:35] tired of talking about you they talk
[2:17:37] about somebody else for a while
[2:17:39] you can't function
[2:17:43] better or worse because somebody's got
[2:17:46] something to say about you
[2:17:48] I heard a new one on us this week
[2:17:52] I heard that they're telling in some
[2:17:54] message churches around
[2:17:56] I use the term loosely
[2:17:59] that in order to dance in our church you
[2:18:01] have to go to some kind of organized
[2:18:03] dance class
[2:18:08] they pass that around I could give you
[2:18:10] names if you need them
[2:18:13] where people have literally passed that
[2:18:15] kind of stuff around and you know what
[2:18:21] when I got through laughing I thought
[2:18:23] wow
[2:18:31] because when you dance for the Lord you
[2:18:36] do it with such precision
[2:18:40] with such Amazing Grace and poise
[2:18:45] that somebody thinks you've been trained
[2:18:48] to do it
[2:18:51] now the secret is out it's a lie
[2:18:58] someone's figment of imagination
[2:19:03] someone misunderstood something from
[2:19:06] years ago
[2:19:08] and have posted and reposted and shared
[2:19:11] and re-shared and talked and I thought I
[2:19:14] am not going to be offended and I'm not
[2:19:17] going to be heard and I'm not going to
[2:19:19] try to track it down I'm just going to
[2:19:21] say my my the next time I dance
[2:19:27] foreign
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:39] you've got to put your eyes on Jesus
[2:19:45] you need to know that somebody somewhere
[2:19:47] don't like you
[2:19:51] and I may know him
[2:19:53] you may know them
[2:19:55] this is not what life is about
[2:19:59] closer you get to the Lord the closer
[2:20:02] you become intimately acquainted with
[2:20:05] him the things that mattered so much
[2:20:08] they start slipping from you even habits
[2:20:12] and hobbies and
[2:20:14] pastimes and
[2:20:17] obsessions
[2:20:20] that mattered so much
[2:20:22] they start mattering less and less not
[2:20:25] because you're becoming more religious
[2:20:27] but because you're becoming more
[2:20:29] anointed
[2:20:31] oh and under that presence what else
[2:20:34] matters Moses said I thank you for the
[2:20:37] angel you promised to sin I thank you
[2:20:40] for all but I if I'm going you got to go
[2:20:42] with me
[2:20:44] let me read a few more verses here how
[2:20:46] many more am I supposed to read 9 and 10
[2:20:50] and that I may actually be found and
[2:20:54] known
[2:20:56] as in him
[2:21:00] let me give you a carnal example
[2:21:04] people know who to tell the joke to
[2:21:09] people know who to make fun of somebody
[2:21:11] with
[2:21:16] don't they
[2:21:18] don't we
[2:21:21] we know the ones that will find it funny
[2:21:24] and the ones who won't we know the ones
[2:21:27] who'll find it borderline
[2:21:29] we know the ones who will remind us
[2:21:34] maybe that's not the best thing to do
[2:21:37] and when I hear someone talking about
[2:21:39] somebody else being strange
[2:21:42] it makes me want to go to Hobby Lobby
[2:21:45] sister Anna can you hook me up at Hobby
[2:21:47] Lobby I need a mirror
[2:21:50] it makes me want to run
[2:21:52] with a mirror
[2:21:54] and say take a big long look at odd
[2:22:03] the body of Christ
[2:22:05] is unique
[2:22:10] weird is actually a witchcraft word
[2:22:13] so I try my best to be careful with that
[2:22:16] word
[2:22:18] but we are strangers
[2:22:21] we are pilgrims
[2:22:23] we should never try to see how strange
[2:22:27] we can be
[2:22:29] or what we can be against
[2:22:32] some people want to be known for what
[2:22:34] they're against
[2:22:36] it's much more noble to be known for
[2:22:39] what you're for
[2:22:42] say Amen brother sister
[2:22:44] some people want to just see how you
[2:22:46] know otherworldly they can get and they
[2:22:50] feel so spiritual when they get sold
[2:22:55] if you could see my stomach turning
[2:22:58] when I'm around have to be around
[2:23:00] someone like that if there's one thing
[2:23:02] that makes me want to puke
[2:23:05] it's religion
[2:23:07] amen and do you know why because I was
[2:23:11] religious
[2:23:13] and when you've been religious it's so
[2:23:15] easy for you to recognize religion
[2:23:19] we don't want to see just how unlike
[2:23:21] everybody we can be and how different we
[2:23:24] weird we can be there's the word yes I
[2:23:26] got it
[2:23:28] so that people can say oh my
[2:23:30] he must really be getting close to the
[2:23:33] Lord you won't you won't have to do any
[2:23:35] of that you won't have to put on you
[2:23:38] won't have to go around with some
[2:23:40] mystical strange way about you when
[2:23:43] you've been with him you smell like him
[2:23:48] your words sound like him your life
[2:23:53] releases the essence of who he is it
[2:23:57] doesn't mean you can't have a good time
[2:23:59] it doesn't mean you can't laugh when
[2:24:01] something is funny but what it means is
[2:24:03] you're growing in him and it becomes
[2:24:07] contagious when I encounter someone
[2:24:09] who's behaving religiously
[2:24:11] it makes me want to be as unlike them
[2:24:17] as I possibly can be
[2:24:20] so when someone religiously tells me the
[2:24:23] error of a Dr Pepper I want to drink too
[2:24:30] that's my human nature
[2:24:32] so religion never draws anybody into a
[2:24:37] closer walk with him
[2:24:38] but the more you spin the more time you
[2:24:41] spend in his presence the more hungry
[2:24:43] you get for his presence the more you
[2:24:47] drink of his water the more thirsty you
[2:24:50] become for more of the same nothing
[2:24:52] thing else satisfies when you've drank
[2:24:56] from his well can anybody say Amen my
[2:25:00] what a strange service
[2:25:03] thank you
[2:25:05] I want him to be praised
[2:25:10] that I may actually be found and known
[2:25:12] as in him not having any self-achieved
[2:25:15] righteousness
[2:25:16] that can be called my own
[2:25:18] based on my obedience to the Law's
[2:25:20] demands
[2:25:22] ritualistic uprightness and supposed
[2:25:24] right standing with God thus acquired
[2:25:29] my Holiness is not found in the fact
[2:25:33] that I've never watched a particular
[2:25:35] movie
[2:25:40] my Holiness is found in my fellowship
[2:25:43] with him because wherever he hangs out
[2:25:47] he releases who he is
[2:25:50] and we just become holy we become like
[2:25:55] those who think purer thoughts
[2:25:58] and and and do purer things
[2:26:02] and you know when you have guile when
[2:26:05] you have jealousy when you have
[2:26:07] resentment when you have these issues
[2:26:09] you feel like everybody does
[2:26:14] what an Awakening when you find out that
[2:26:17] there are literally people that you go
[2:26:19] to church with who are not jealous
[2:26:21] you go
[2:26:22] I don't believe it
[2:26:25] everybody's jealous it blows our minds
[2:26:28] when we find out that someone has
[2:26:30] actually won that battle
[2:26:32] hey
[2:26:33] there's someone who actually doesn't
[2:26:35] care if you get a vacation
[2:26:40] they actually celebrate the fact that
[2:26:42] you got to vacate I got Bills running
[2:26:45] out my ears and guess what they're all
[2:26:48] yours
[2:26:53] you did it
[2:26:57] I did it
[2:27:00] I can't blame you
[2:27:02] for my bad decisions
[2:27:05] but when you get to the place where
[2:27:07] somebody else is blessed
[2:27:13] and you get blessed
[2:27:15] by their blessing
[2:27:17] your growing Church
[2:27:20] no guile no jealousy no resentment Mama
[2:27:25] someone drives on the parking lot with a
[2:27:27] new vehicle and you start figuring out
[2:27:29] how many bills you could have paid off
[2:27:31] of that money
[2:27:32] the problem is brother sister it wasn't
[2:27:35] yours
[2:27:36] so the answer zilch
[2:27:38] zero you couldn't have paid off any of
[2:27:41] your bills with it because it didn't
[2:27:43] belong to you
[2:27:45] you were pushing your vehicle onto the
[2:27:48] parking lot and someone comes by with a
[2:27:50] new one when you can Rejoice with them
[2:27:56] you're growing
[2:27:58] you're growing
[2:28:01] when you can take some time to figure
[2:28:03] out why do people act so awkward why do
[2:28:07] they feel the need to be so religious
[2:28:11] if you could spend all time in prayer
[2:28:13] and start asking the Lord what might I
[2:28:16] do
[2:28:18] to relieve some of that pressure
[2:28:24] you're growing
[2:28:30] there are easier people to hang out with
[2:28:31] than others
[2:28:34] if you can find yourself reaching out
[2:28:36] to those who don't smell as good as you
[2:28:38] do
[2:28:41] [Music]
[2:28:43] you're growing
[2:28:46] you didn't just get up one morning and
[2:28:48] decide to be a better person you're
[2:28:50] growing because you've been in his
[2:28:52] presence and like Joshua
[2:28:54] you said I know there's more business to
[2:28:56] tend to but just let me sit here
[2:28:58] let me stand here another five minutes
[2:29:02] and just soak
[2:29:05] brother Branham this week was talking
[2:29:07] about
[2:29:10] shittinwood
[2:29:16] and he said
[2:29:19] it was just a hollow sponge
[2:29:24] lighter than Balsam I think he was
[2:29:27] talking about
[2:29:28] I don't think it was Acacia I think it
[2:29:30] was shitty mood
[2:29:33] the the the Ark of the the Noah's Ark
[2:29:36] was made of chateemwood is that right
[2:29:39] and he said it's like boss it's it's
[2:29:41] it's lighter than Balsam am I saying
[2:29:44] that Rider is it Balsa
[2:29:46] you know the kind of wood that we used
[2:29:48] to make our little airplanes out of
[2:29:50] is that balsa wood or Balsam Balsa
[2:29:56] he said it's it's like a hollow sponge
[2:29:58] and he said this is how we need to be
[2:30:02] I almost preached on that this morning
[2:30:04] we need to be Hollow sponges
[2:30:08] we need to come into His presence
[2:30:11] press our way in no matter what let me
[2:30:15] tell you something there is a remedy for
[2:30:17] nausea
[2:30:20] presence
[2:30:22] there is a remedy for a headache
[2:30:26] Ashley you ought to know
[2:30:28] his presence
[2:30:32] Maribeth
[2:30:34] there's a remedy for all that stuff that
[2:30:36] you've been going through
[2:30:39] his presence
[2:30:42] you just push in when you want to die
[2:30:47] of course you can't always do it if
[2:30:49] you're contagious I get all that I
[2:30:50] understand all that but you're here
[2:30:53] you might as well make the best of it so
[2:30:56] you just come like a like a like a like
[2:30:58] a plow head you just come in and you
[2:31:01] start pushing I spoke to the musicians
[2:31:03] in the back and I said look
[2:31:05] this is not going to be an easy service
[2:31:09] we're gonna have to work harder than
[2:31:10] we've normally worked
[2:31:12] we've been out of church a week
[2:31:14] a lot of things have happened in a week
[2:31:16] but we can do this
[2:31:19] it's our responsibility but it's also
[2:31:21] our privilege to push
[2:31:25] to push everything out of the way
[2:31:28] [Music]
[2:31:29] come on I'm nearly done
[2:31:33] push everything out of the way fight
[2:31:39] until you can experience his presence
[2:31:42] and then when you do you lay there like
[2:31:45] a sponge
[2:31:47] like brother random said a hollow sponge
[2:31:49] and you just soak up the presence of the
[2:31:52] Lord
[2:31:54] Joshua was determined I just want to be
[2:31:57] right here
[2:32:01] soaking up the presence of God
[2:32:06] sister hope and brother Josh
[2:32:08] they had no business here last Sunday
[2:32:12] she was sick
[2:32:14] but feeling a little better
[2:32:18] I'm not we're not going to make it
[2:32:20] pastor
[2:32:21] I don't know how long but not much
[2:32:23] longer than that
[2:32:24] a text she's feeling a little better
[2:32:27] we're on our way
[2:32:32] somebody could get offended and say oh
[2:32:34] what what kind of germs were they
[2:32:36] spreading around or someone could say
[2:32:38] what a sponge
[2:32:42] what a sponge
[2:32:44] Lord
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:50] I also not so that I can be religious
[2:32:52] but so that I can soak in a little more
[2:32:55] of your presence I want to pray a little
[2:32:57] longer I want to read a little longer I
[2:33:00] want to experience you a little longer
[2:33:07] because I want to know you
[2:33:10] yes
[2:33:11] there's too many people that know the
[2:33:14] message
[2:33:16] but have never become intimately
[2:33:18] acquainted with the message
[2:33:21] this truth has to drop from your head to
[2:33:25] your heart to your feet
[2:33:29] you have to learn to walk it out
[2:33:32] and that I may actually be found and
[2:33:34] known as in him not having any
[2:33:36] self-achieved righteousness that can be
[2:33:38] called my own based on my obedience to
[2:33:41] the Law's demands ritualistic
[2:33:42] uprightness and supposed right standing
[2:33:44] with God thus acquired
[2:33:48] like all of those people who would like
[2:33:49] to call us back
[2:33:52] to some restriction of Sabbath
[2:33:56] Sabbath is the most beautiful most
[2:34:00] beautiful weekly reminder that Yeshua
[2:34:04] that Jesus has come to bring us rest
[2:34:09] however you choose to commemorate it I
[2:34:13] strongly urge you to remember it
[2:34:19] if the only way you can do it is to
[2:34:22] greet someone peace of the Sabbath be
[2:34:25] upon you shabbat shalom
[2:34:28] almost every week Brother David Mann our
[2:34:30] sister Sandy shabbat shalom almost every
[2:34:33] week Jonathan sends him as shabbat
[2:34:35] shalom I'm not offended by that I'm
[2:34:38] encouraged by that because it reminds me
[2:34:42] that the Sabbath has become more than a
[2:34:46] 24-hour period of a week it has become a
[2:34:50] living reality he gets up with me on
[2:34:53] Sunday morning the same way he would
[2:34:55] linger with me on Saturday morning he
[2:34:57] gets up with me on Monday morning I have
[2:35:00] a rest that is bigger
[2:35:03] than the day of the week
[2:35:05] to despise what God used to point you to
[2:35:10] the truth is stupid
[2:35:14] but to idolize
[2:35:20] it's all so stupid
[2:35:23] it'd be like you driving your car over
[2:35:26] here in 250 runs into 379
[2:35:30] and there's a stop sign there and it
[2:35:32] would be like you getting out of your
[2:35:34] vehicle and running circles around that
[2:35:36] stop sign screaming at the top of your
[2:35:40] lungs the last sign the last sign the
[2:35:43] last sign I'll be at church before you
[2:35:46] know it this is the last sign it's a
[2:35:48] sign hey folks
[2:35:54] and that's what I've seen so many people
[2:35:56] do around the message
[2:35:57] they've idolized brother Branham they've
[2:36:00] placed him on the pole instead of the
[2:36:02] brass serpents
[2:36:05] they've called his name more often than
[2:36:07] they've called The Name of Jesus Christ
[2:36:09] brother Brandon would be personally
[2:36:11] offended and broken by that kind of
[2:36:13] behavior
[2:36:14] he would be offended in a service that
[2:36:16] he got more a more uh you know
[2:36:19] popularity or notoriety than Jesus
[2:36:22] he came to introduce us to Christ he was
[2:36:25] a sign
[2:36:26] but he taught us emphatically that every
[2:36:29] sign has a
[2:36:32] voice
[2:36:33] and guess what the sign said stop
[2:36:38] so you should obey the sign
[2:36:42] count to ten Mississippi
[2:36:45] and get on to church
[2:36:47] and credit holding people up out there
[2:36:49] on 250 running around the stop sign
[2:36:54] it's the same way in life
[2:36:56] I'm not going to run around the Sabbath
[2:36:58] I'm not going to force people into some
[2:37:01] kind of remembrance
[2:37:04] but I'm going to encourage every one of
[2:37:06] you to remember that God gave a weekly
[2:37:09] reminder that a greater peace was coming
[2:37:12] a greater peace is coming
[2:37:14] oh it's been it's been beautiful for the
[2:37:16] Jewish people can you imagine being in
[2:37:18] Robbins Brook can you imagine being in
[2:37:20] in in in all of these horrible
[2:37:22] concentration camps
[2:37:25] where you could hardly remember the day
[2:37:27] of the week and someone is marking off
[2:37:29] the sunsets
[2:37:33] with a rock on the floor
[2:37:35] so that they can spend a few extra
[2:37:37] minutes holding hands and having a
[2:37:39] prayer as the Sabbath came in don't tell
[2:37:41] me that's not beautiful don't tell me it
[2:37:43] hasn't sustained God's people
[2:37:46] it's been a precious reminder but for me
[2:37:48] to try to force people into some kind
[2:37:50] then you are just absolutely looking for
[2:37:52] a ritualistic uprightness you're finding
[2:37:56] a supposed right standing with God by
[2:37:58] some kind of of performance
[2:38:03] instead of relationship
[2:38:05] religion is about performance
[2:38:07] relationship is about intimacy
[2:38:12] but possess anyone offended good but
[2:38:15] possessing that genuine righteousness
[2:38:17] which comes how
[2:38:20] through faith in
[2:38:23] Christ
[2:38:25] we look away to
[2:38:28] Christ
[2:38:30] we look away to Jesus
[2:38:34] we got our eyes off people now we're
[2:38:36] looking to Christ the word we've got our
[2:38:39] eyes off of our hacking and coughing and
[2:38:42] draining and and we're looking at Christ
[2:38:44] the word and he lifts us up
[2:38:48] we get our mind off of our pain
[2:38:53] lifted up Christ the word
[2:38:55] truly right standing with God which
[2:38:57] comes from God by Saving faith
[2:39:00] is that the last verse or was it one
[2:39:02] more ten
[2:39:04] for my determined purpose is this is not
[2:39:06] going to come automatically you're not
[2:39:08] going to know him automatically you're
[2:39:10] going to have to fight to know him not
[2:39:12] that he doesn't want to reveal himself
[2:39:14] you're just going to have to come up to
[2:39:15] where he is
[2:39:17] he'll come to where you are to save you
[2:39:20] but you'll have to come to where he is
[2:39:21] to have Fellowship who can Ascend the
[2:39:24] hill of the Lord
[2:39:25] but he that has a pure heart and Clean
[2:39:27] Hands and it's so easy it's so easy to
[2:39:30] get your hands washed it it's so easy to
[2:39:33] get your heart pure you just come to the
[2:39:35] word
[2:39:37] and you just realize that that it's not
[2:39:40] how clean you can get your hands
[2:39:42] it's not about that at all it's about
[2:39:45] understanding what he's done on your
[2:39:47] behalf which is really sort of the
[2:39:49] purpose of this message but we haven't
[2:39:50] gotten there just yet
[2:39:52] that I may progressively become more
[2:39:54] deeply and intimately acquainted with
[2:39:56] him perceiving and recognizing and
[2:39:58] understanding the wonders of his person
[2:40:05] Moses said
[2:40:08] I want to know your way
[2:40:14] Paul said something more powerful than
[2:40:16] that
[2:40:20] I want to know you
[2:40:26] I don't want to just know what you can
[2:40:28] do
[2:40:30] I don't want to just love you because of
[2:40:32] what you are capable of doing
[2:40:34] I Just Want to Love You Because of Who
[2:40:37] You Are
[2:40:39] you are God's Sovereign and supreme
[2:40:43] you're a God who in in my mind should
[2:40:46] have no desire or reason to have
[2:40:48] fellowship with me
[2:40:51] and yet it's a priority
[2:40:56] you desire to have fellowship with me
[2:41:00] the Apostle said that I may become
[2:41:03] intimately acquainted with him
[2:41:04] perceiving recognizing understanding the
[2:41:06] wonders of his person
[2:41:09] more strongly and more clearly and that
[2:41:12] I may in the same way come to know the
[2:41:14] power outflowing this is the anastasis
[2:41:17] this is the reproducible resurrection
[2:41:19] that comes in us every time we
[2:41:22] fellowship with him
[2:41:26] you're resetting your body
[2:41:29] you're resetting your physical being
[2:41:31] every time you come into fellowship with
[2:41:34] him his presence
[2:41:36] because the resurrection is is Flowing
[2:41:38] up and out of you and when it when when
[2:41:41] the resurrection flows up and out of us
[2:41:44] it changes Us in ways that we don't
[2:41:46] always perceive
[2:41:59] think about the glory
[2:42:02] of the times that God protected you
[2:42:06] some of you have been
[2:42:08] Disturbed this week
[2:42:12] of how this could happen to you
[2:42:14] or why it happened to you or why it
[2:42:17] happened
[2:42:21] one of the Brethren sitting at the table
[2:42:23] last Sunday said to me is this common
[2:42:26] among you
[2:42:30] that you have a good set of meetings and
[2:42:31] you all get sick
[2:42:36] yes
[2:42:40] well we don't put it on the schedule
[2:42:47] it's not like we judge the goodness of
[2:42:50] the meetings by how many people come
[2:42:52] night to death
[2:42:54] during the week
[2:42:58] but
[2:43:00] we expect
[2:43:04] some kickback
[2:43:07] we expected
[2:43:09] he can't stop it
[2:43:12] so he tries to destroy
[2:43:15] destroy from it
[2:43:17] and what do we do we Press On
[2:43:20] [Applause]
[2:43:22] you know I I had so much to be thankful
[2:43:25] for the hospitals are full
[2:43:31] we had many including children sister
[2:43:34] Sandy has a student
[2:43:38] in her school that was in intensive care
[2:43:43] sweet little boy with flu and pneumonia
[2:43:46] and the same thing
[2:43:49] that some have fought around here
[2:43:52] and he was in serious condition he's
[2:43:55] better now
[2:43:56] I I had a she sent a little picture
[2:43:59] he's better now
[2:44:01] but he was in serious condition with the
[2:44:03] very same thing that some of you were
[2:44:05] fighting
[2:44:06] and so here's what I think I say thank
[2:44:08] you Lord
[2:44:11] thank you what a horrible week for some
[2:44:14] people but but thank you Lord
[2:44:16] it could have been so much more serious
[2:44:20] what would we have thought or what would
[2:44:21] we have done or how would we responded
[2:44:23] if one of these little ones would have
[2:44:25] ended up in the emergency room or in the
[2:44:27] uh I mean in the
[2:44:29] and it started before camp meeting with
[2:44:32] the with the chemical burns
[2:44:36] so so what do we do well we we go
[2:44:39] through all the emotions
[2:44:41] before camp meeting started I was going
[2:44:44] through this
[2:44:45] mentality of your failure and you were
[2:44:48] not leading properly and you should have
[2:44:50] not allowed something like that to
[2:44:52] happen and when you get over that then
[2:44:54] there's something else to deal with but
[2:44:55] if we Press On
[2:44:57] we press on because we have one prize
[2:45:01] one goal One Vision in mind and that's
[2:45:05] not to grow a bigger Church
[2:45:07] it's to have him
[2:45:09] [Applause]
[2:45:11] oh that I might win him
[2:45:15] [Applause]
[2:45:17] so we're closing now musicians are
[2:45:20] coming
[2:45:22] this is the cry
[2:45:26] I wrote these notes
[2:45:29] this is the Cry of the remnant bride
[2:45:33] in this hour
[2:45:35] we want to know him
[2:45:38] we want to enter into intimate
[2:45:40] fellowship with him
[2:45:43] I don't want to be made to feel good
[2:45:46] about my sin
[2:45:49] [Applause]
[2:45:52] I don't want to be made to feel good
[2:45:55] about my inadequacy
[2:45:58] I want somebody to point me to a closer
[2:46:02] walk with him
[2:46:05] so that I can get over the the
[2:46:07] condemnation and the guilt that the
[2:46:09] enemy throws I don't ever want people to
[2:46:12] be satisfied with anything less
[2:46:15] than gaining Christ
[2:46:18] and being in him
[2:46:20] we don't sit around condemning one
[2:46:22] another for our our inferiorities or our
[2:46:25] shortcomings
[2:46:27] but neither do we encourage people to
[2:46:29] stay where they are
[2:46:31] I want to have a good balance in these
[2:46:33] things don't you I hear people
[2:46:35] encouraging people well just you know
[2:46:37] just trust just believe you stay right
[2:46:39] where you are
[2:46:40] it's going to work out all right after a
[2:46:42] while
[2:46:46] that doesn't sound like what Moses was
[2:46:48] saying
[2:46:49] that doesn't sound like what Paul was
[2:46:51] saying
[2:46:52] this is the Cry of the remnant bride in
[2:46:56] this hour
[2:46:57] we want to know him
[2:46:59] to enter into intimate fellowship with
[2:47:02] him
[2:47:03] more than power
[2:47:05] more than signs
[2:47:07] more than wonders
[2:47:09] we are running hard after him
[2:47:12] we want to fully understand the finished
[2:47:15] work that he has accomplished in US
[2:47:20] so that our striving
[2:47:22] and our soulish efforts can cease
[2:47:26] we want to have fellowship with God
[2:47:30] as Moses had
[2:47:33] face to face
[2:47:36] the face of God speaks of his Spirit it
[2:47:39] doesn't speak of his mouth and nose and
[2:47:41] eyes
[2:47:43] this would mean the spirit of Moses
[2:47:47] having deep communion
[2:47:51] with the spirit of God
[2:47:55] when your spirit
[2:47:58] has had deep communion
[2:48:02] with his spirit
[2:48:04] you have fellowshipped with him
[2:48:08] face to face
[2:48:12] it's not about seeing
[2:48:15] features
[2:48:18] God did not allow Moses
[2:48:22] to see his eyes nose and mouth
[2:48:27] we'll get to that Tuesday night
[2:48:31] s of
[2:48:32] Spirit Fellowship
[2:48:37] which is without mine will and emotion
[2:48:42] emotion
[2:48:44] can easily stop you
[2:48:47] from having intimate fellowship with the
[2:48:51] spirit
[2:48:53] I'm not preaching that we need to be
[2:48:56] more emotional
[2:48:58] in preaching we need to be more sincere
[2:49:00] in our praise
[2:49:03] so that we can experience
[2:49:06] his spirit
[2:49:07] In Worship
[2:49:11] praise
[2:49:12] breaks open
[2:49:18] worship
[2:49:19] is not about what you say or what you do
[2:49:24] it's about your position
[2:49:27] we've taught that before
[2:49:30] we can know these things by the
[2:49:32] scripture
[2:49:34] I I only want to mention one thing here
[2:49:38] and that is let me read this quickly
[2:49:41] second Corinthians
[2:49:44] chapter 3 and verse 18.
[2:49:49] but we all
[2:49:51] with open face
[2:49:58] you know what open face means
[2:50:01] face to face
[2:50:04] we all with open face beholding as in a
[2:50:08] glass
[2:50:09] the glory of the Lord
[2:50:12] are changed
[2:50:15] into the same image
[2:50:19] from glory to glory
[2:50:23] even as by
[2:50:26] the spirit of the Lord
[2:50:29] how is that possible
[2:50:33] because the veil is removed
[2:50:37] brother Greeley said something in one of
[2:50:39] his Services perhaps it was a Thursday
[2:50:42] night
[2:50:46] about the veil being removed
[2:50:49] you remember it
[2:50:51] I don't remember what night it was
[2:50:54] but it reminded me of a word from the
[2:50:57] Lord
[2:50:59] thank you
[2:51:01] he spoke to us some years ago and he
[2:51:03] said I am sending an anointing
[2:51:06] that will remove the final veils from
[2:51:09] before the faces of my people
[2:51:13] the veils that have prevented them from
[2:51:16] seeing the things that I have desired
[2:51:20] for them to see
[2:51:23] he said veils are being identified in
[2:51:27] our lives
[2:51:29] veils that we hide behind to keep from
[2:51:32] having to step out of our comfort zone
[2:51:34] and into the new territory that the Lord
[2:51:37] wants to give to us and veils
[2:51:40] that hinder our view into the realm of
[2:51:43] the spirit
[2:51:46] veils of opinion and unbelief and
[2:51:49] self-condemnation and disqualification
[2:51:53] that separate us from Christ
[2:51:56] that hinder our intimate fellowship with
[2:51:59] him
[2:52:00] and for the spirit of the Lord to say
[2:52:03] I'm sending an anointing to remove those
[2:52:06] final veils
[2:52:08] to hear Brother Greely saying what he
[2:52:11] was saying about those veil about the
[2:52:13] Veil
[2:52:14] it stirred something in me and so I've
[2:52:17] been praying this week could this be the
[2:52:20] hour
[2:52:22] could this be this time the season the
[2:52:25] moment that God wants to yank
[2:52:31] what we hide behind
[2:52:35] you know we do
[2:52:38] you know we hide
[2:52:42] you know sometimes we hide behind the
[2:52:44] veils
[2:52:46] we don't want us people to see us as we
[2:52:49] really are
[2:52:51] and by hiding behind the veils we cut
[2:52:53] ourselves off from that naked intimate
[2:52:57] Fellowship I hope that's not offensive
[2:52:58] the way I described it it simply means
[2:53:00] there's nothing between you two to
[2:53:03] hinder to separate to keep you from
[2:53:07] having fellowship with him
[2:53:15] but this be the time that God is getting
[2:53:17] ready to deal with those veils
[2:53:21] it took me in the word and
[2:53:23] he helped me to identify six different
[2:53:26] veils that are spoken of in the
[2:53:27] scripture and I preached that and you
[2:53:29] might couldn't find it
[2:53:32] the veil of the Tabernacle the veil of
[2:53:34] the temple the veil of Moses the veil of
[2:53:36] Christ's flesh
[2:53:38] the veil of unbelief
[2:53:40] and eventually the veil of national
[2:53:43] blindness in Romans where God talks
[2:53:45] about removing the veil from his people
[2:53:47] the bride of Christ
[2:53:51] should be unveiled in this hour
[2:53:54] so that she can see Christ in the
[2:53:56] fullness of who he is does that resonate
[2:53:59] with anybody
[2:54:00] nothing between you and him nothing that
[2:54:03] shuts you out
[2:54:04] why is it churches let's stand why is it
[2:54:08] church that we don't think like this all
[2:54:09] the time
[2:54:15] because we get caught up in life
[2:54:18] and we need to be reminded on occasion
[2:54:22] you can have all the success that this
[2:54:24] world offers
[2:54:29] but if you're not winning Christ
[2:54:33] if he's not your prize
[2:54:36] if Christ is not the reason you get up
[2:54:38] in the morning
[2:54:41] if Christ is not the reason why you came
[2:54:44] to church this morning
[2:54:47] if Christ is not the reason why we
[2:54:49] desire to have fellowship with one
[2:54:51] another
[2:54:53] if Christ is not the reason why we
[2:54:56] desire to do our best and to be our best
[2:55:00] and everything we put our hands to do
[2:55:03] the Bible talks about Daniel having an
[2:55:06] excellent spirit
[2:55:10] he rose above and superseded the status
[2:55:15] quo
[2:55:17] and he found a place of being excellent
[2:55:20] in the sight of God
[2:55:23] because everything he put his hands to
[2:55:25] do he did it with everything that he had
[2:55:29] and God honored him for that
[2:55:32] just like he honored
[2:55:37] Joshua and Caleb
[2:55:42] I think that Joshua was one of the first
[2:55:45] to go in
[2:55:48] because he was one of the last to come
[2:55:50] out
[2:55:55] I want us to sing into the presence of
[2:55:58] Jesus
[2:56:00] as we get ready to close
[2:56:03] [Music]
[2:56:06] and to the presence of Jesus

[2:56:19] I'm longing
[2:56:21] to go

[3:01:25] to lead us in

[3:01:30] week
[3:01:31] the whole Zechariah 3 thing that we were
[3:01:34] mentioning during the camp
[3:01:35] maybe just before
[3:01:38] and I almost took a text from Zechariah
[3:01:41] 3 this morning but
[3:01:44] there is a threefold blessing
[3:01:50] I believe God wants it to be ours
[3:02:02] what are you going to sing son
[3:02:06] you can sing and then I'll get this I'm
[3:02:08] looking for it I want to read this to

[3:04:37] [Applause]
[3:04:39] [Music]
[3:04:39] [Applause]
[3:04:40] [Music]
[3:04:57] foreign
[3:05:01] [Music]
[3:05:34] so
[3:05:38] Lord I wanna yearn
[3:05:42] in Zechariah
[3:05:44] chapter 3 verse 7 in the complete Jewish
[3:05:48] Bible
[3:05:49] it says Adonai at 7 says this
[3:05:54] if you will walk in my ways
[3:05:59] obey my commission
[3:06:03] judge my house
[3:06:05] and guard my courtyards
[3:06:08] then I will give you
[3:06:11] free access among those
[3:06:15] who are standing here
[3:06:18] when I had a visitation
[3:06:20] in Jerusalem
[3:06:22] I was told that there is a three-fold
[3:06:25] blessing could you put up Zechariah 3 7
[3:06:28] in the King James and let's look at it
[3:06:31] in just a moment
[3:06:37] Lord of hosts
[3:06:39] if thou Wilt walk in my ways and if thou
[3:06:42] will keep my charge
[3:06:44] then Thou shalt also judge my house
[3:06:47] shall also keep my courts and I will
[3:06:51] give thee places to walk among these
[3:06:53] that stand by
[3:06:57] and I was told in that experience if
[3:06:59] there was a threefold blessing
[3:07:01] that was promised in Zechariah 3 7
[3:07:04] number one governing Authority
[3:07:07] you will judge and govern my house
[3:07:10] number two administrative privileges
[3:07:15] if you will keep and have charge and
[3:07:19] guard my courts
[3:07:21] which we know to be the realm of the
[3:07:23] third heaven
[3:07:24] and number three Priestly prophetic and
[3:07:28] kingly service places to walk among
[3:07:31] those who are standing by and you will
[3:07:34] be granted free access
[3:07:38] if you knew that you had free access
[3:07:43] into the holy of holies
[3:07:46] wouldn't you go
[3:07:48] and how often would you go
[3:07:53] that's free access
[3:07:55] if you're waiting to be invited in you
[3:07:58] miss the invitation
[3:08:00] he said now let us therefore come
[3:08:03] boldly to the
[3:08:05] throne of grace that we might obtain
[3:08:07] help where do you think the throne of
[3:08:09] grace is
[3:08:11] in the courtroom or the throne room of
[3:08:14] our God it's in the holy of holies
[3:08:17] you've already been invited in
[3:08:20] what's our hold up
[3:08:22] we stand in our own way
[3:08:25] if a people were to determine among
[3:08:28] themselves to answer the Lord's
[3:08:31] invitation
[3:08:33] that's what he would give that people
[3:08:36] governing Authority
[3:08:38] administrative privilege and Priestly
[3:08:41] prophetic and kingly service before the
[3:08:44] King of Kings and the Lord of lords you
[3:08:48] could stand in his holy Presence at any
[3:08:51] time you desired because free access
[3:08:55] means exactly that
[3:08:58] free
[3:09:00] unobstructed
[3:09:02] unhindered
[3:09:04] says
[3:09:06] the New Testament said you got it
[3:09:08] let us therefore come boldly the Apostle
[3:09:11] said we are now seated together in
[3:09:14] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if I
[3:09:19] truly knew that I could go in whenever I
[3:09:22] wanted to why would I let a day go by
[3:09:25] that I didn't stand in his presence
[3:09:28] give him my praise and let him see my
[3:09:32] need
[3:09:33] sometime you're not there to tell him
[3:09:35] what you need you're just there to show
[3:09:37] him
[3:09:38] Lord this is our desire
[3:09:40] if there's a promise in this for us we
[3:09:43] want to walk in the Fulfillment of that
[3:09:46] promise would you teach us how would you
[3:09:49] allow us to enter in according to that
[3:09:52] invitation that you have offered us
[3:09:54] let's sing something let's worship just
[3:09:57] a little more before we go home today I
[3:09:59] wouldn't add to this this is his
[3:10:01] presence he's trying to do something for
[3:10:03] us let's let him do it now

[3:20:18] thank you Jesus I just want to say is
[3:20:21] that all yes it's on okay
[3:20:23] I just want to say that all week the
[3:20:26] Lord has been dealing with me
[3:20:28] about Zechariah 3.
[3:20:32] and seeing that you mentioned that
[3:20:35] visitation you had
[3:20:38] all we I kept seeing something
[3:20:42] and that was
[3:20:44] how Joshua the high priest stood there
[3:20:48] and he had on filthy garments yes
[3:20:52] and it was due to the fact that he had
[3:20:56] been associated with Babylon yes and at
[3:21:01] one point it came and I know my prayer
[3:21:04] the whole time was when he came and
[3:21:07] there was he had the turbanon and then
[3:21:10] came that swirling and he covered his
[3:21:14] head yes and then once it lifted
[3:21:18] that's when the work was done and
[3:21:22] Holiness unto the Lord Holiness was
[3:21:25] written yes over yes and that has been
[3:21:29] my prayer all the time this week God's
[3:21:33] Soul emphasized it yeah my thoughts yes
[3:21:36] Lord
[3:21:39] [Music]
[3:21:41] yeah and then there
[3:21:44] [Music]
[3:21:50] uh it was about a brother who was
[3:21:53] trying to dig a river
[3:21:55] and then you saw that pipe pull the mic
[3:21:58] down a little bit
[3:21:59] I'm just all right
[3:22:02] um and you saw those pipes and you told
[3:22:05] him that he needed to put them right at
[3:22:09] the bottom because when that wave would
[3:22:12] come that river that water would come
[3:22:15] only the purest of water would go
[3:22:19] through that and that's what we have
[3:22:21] been hearing got to have it and on
[3:22:23] Friday morning as I was praying
[3:22:26] God just moved in and my and that's what
[3:22:29] he emphasized to me is we've got to
[3:22:32] watch our thoughts our words so that
[3:22:36] Holiness could be you know that
[3:22:38] overcoming brother random emphasize that
[3:22:42] our thoughts are so
[3:22:45] important amen that we would just yield
[3:22:48] to this because God that change is
[3:22:51] coming oh yes it's on its way you
