[33:09] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[33:12] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[33:15] the book
[33:19] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[33:23] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[33:25] the Earth was able to open the book
[33:27] neither to look their own and I went
[33:30] much because no man was found worthy to
[33:34] open and read the book
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] neither to look there upon
[33:40] and one of the elders saith unto me
[33:43] weep not
[33:45] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[33:51] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[33:54] the book
[33:56] and the loose the seals thereof
[33:59] and I beheld in low in the midst of the
[34:02] throne and of the four beasts into the
[34:04] midst of the elders stood a lamp as it
[34:07] had been saved
[34:09] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[34:13] are the spirit seven spirits of God
[34:16] send forth into all the Earth
[34:18] and he came and took the book out of the
[34:21] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[34:24] and when he had taken the book The Four
[34:26] beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell
[34:28] down before the Lord having every one of
[34:30] them harps
[34:32] in Golden files of odors which are the
[34:34] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[34:37] new song
[34:38] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[34:41] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[34:44] was slain it has redeemed us to God by
[34:46] the blood out of every Kindred and
[34:48] tongue and people and Nation
[34:51] and has made us priests
[34:54] Kings
[34:56] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[34:59] Priests and we shall reign on the Earth
[35:02] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[35:05] many angels round about the throne and
[35:06] the Beast and the elders and the numbers
[35:08] of them was ten thousands times ten
[35:11] thousands and thousands of thousands and
[35:13] they were seeing
[35:15] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[35:18] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[35:20] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[35:22] and glory and blessing listen this
[35:24] and every creature which is in heaven
[35:28] and on the earth and under the Earth and

[35:40] earth and underneath the Earth and above

[35:48] voice

[35:54] power be unto him that sitteth upon the
[35:58] throne and unto the lamb forever and

[45:46] all over this building there are hands
[45:48] raised there was a request given in to
[45:51] me last night for a sister Arie we want
[45:54] to remember her to the Lord she is
[45:56] fighting cancer has small children we
[45:59] want to ask the Lord to touch and make
[46:01] whole to heal in the name of the Lord
[46:03] Jesus Christ sister Kathy Thibodeaux is
[46:06] needing a touch from the Lord we want to
[46:08] continue to pray for her sister Flo
[46:10] still needing a touch from the Lord
[46:14] the Lord if you will and also Naya
[46:17] turned in a prayer request for her Nana
[46:19] who's having pain and swelling in her
[46:22] knee and brother Donovan who's had eye
[46:24] surgery this week he needs a good
[46:25] recovery all right
[46:27] brother Elam could I call on you to come
[46:29] and take these needs to the Lord today
[46:31] we're just so grateful for what the Lord
[46:34] is doing and how he's moving Among Us
[46:36] he's here prison Among Us
[46:39] anything can happen when Jesus is
[46:43] present
[46:48] good
[46:50] well I'll try but my voice isn't very
[46:53] good this morning but
[46:54] the Lord can take care of that
[46:57] I really appreciate what the Lord is
[46:58] doing
[47:00] and just so grateful
[47:02] to be able to fellowship with brothers
[47:04] and sisters like this
[47:08] we searched for years
[47:10] to find a message Church
[47:13] has a balance
[47:16] at one time we almost gave up
[47:19] and then the Lord connected us with some
[47:21] that uh
[47:23] it kind of stirred us again
[47:26] because at one time it almost seemed
[47:28] like there's just nobody around that
[47:29] leaves this message
[47:31] and still really Walks In Truth or maybe
[47:34] they don't believe the message I could
[47:35] say then but they claim to
[47:39] and so we've went through some stages a
[47:42] few different times like that
[47:44] and it just really
[47:46] is so good to fellowship with Saints
[47:49] that have the power of God and believe
[47:52] the word
[47:54] so we really appreciate you all
[47:57] now let's take these needs to the Lord
[47:59] in prayer

[48:14] that were mentioned were brought out and

[48:19] and even the depths of the hearts for
[48:21] those that don't really know their needs
[48:23] Lord
[48:24] we pray Lord that today you touch those
[48:28] Lord maybe there's some here that don't
[48:31] realize their need

[48:35] such a way today
[48:37] that they're brought to the realization
[48:39] of what they need and come to you Lord
