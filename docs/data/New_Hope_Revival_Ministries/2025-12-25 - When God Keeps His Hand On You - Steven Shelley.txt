Description:
Born for purpose, moved upon by supernatural strength—Samson carries a divine assignment despite his flaws. God's hand stays on those who stumble, using availability over perfection, willingness over qualification.
The question is never your amen, but your obedience—how quickly you adjust, surrender, yield to the Spirit's leading.
Integrity marks those emerging from Laodicea's self-centered age. To be like Jesus means more than religious language—it means living His life. Walking like Him. Speaking truth like Him. Loving like Him. Words backed by integrity and courage.
The Word is a fire that consumes, a hammer that crushes stubborn will. Samson wasn't a failure—he was human, born with vision but requiring correction. When he fell, he rose. When he strayed, he adjusted.
You and I must do the same, or lose more than relationships. We'll lose eternity itself.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Samson was born for a purpose. God vindicated his purpose by a supernatural announcement. And God also vindicated that he had a divine purpose by moving on him violently, mightily. The spirit of the Lord would move on him and he would immediately transcend his natural strength and ability. God giving him a strength that was of another world, of another realm, of another dimension. Samson not only makes a beautiful type of our Lord, he makes a beautiful type of an end time bride, a remnant church, because he's flawed, number one. So, I can relate to flawed folk in the Bible. But I like the fact that he didn't lose the purpose of his birth because he was flawed. God's hand stayed on him. And God said, "I'm going to use him. &gt;&gt; I I I I don't know whether to fully trust him or not, but I'm going to use him because he's available." DID YOU KNOW GOD IS NOT JUST looking for somebody who's qualified to do a particular thing? He's looking for SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING. &gt;&gt; You You know, it's not your amen that that testifies that you're willing. It's your obedience. It's how quickly you move to make adjustment to change your direction and to surrender to the leadership of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is going to be a mark that is going to be easily identifiable on an end time Bible believing bride. And one of those marks, we could call it that, is going to be integrity. And no wonder the bride of every other age is going to marvel that you and I made it out of Leodysia, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; With our character intact because we yielded to his life. &gt;&gt; They're going to stand around and say, "YOU MEAN YOU'VE COME OUT of Leodysia? Why, that's the most wicked of all the ages. There's going to be a certainly a stir in eternity when you cross because the spirit of this age is so it's so wicked. &gt;&gt; It's so self centered. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was the opposite. Amen. &gt;&gt; The most loving, the most forgiving, the most sacrificial, the most unselfish life &gt;&gt; that the world has ever seen. &gt;&gt; And so to be like Jesus doesn't mean to say hallelujah, praise the Lord, amen, every other sentence. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus means live like him, talk like him, walk like him, tell the truth like him. &gt;&gt; Love, love, love, love like him. &gt;&gt; Speak with integrity, with courage, but with a life that backs up what we say. &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO THROW MYSELF ON THE MERCY OF YOUR WORD. HALLELUJAH. IT IT'S A FIRE THAT consumes and BURNS OUT. IT'S A HAMMER THAT CRUSHES OUR own stubborn will when we continue to submit ourselves to the Lord. I'm standing today in a church full of Samsons. ARE YOU SAYING FAILURES? I DON'T SEE SAMSON as a failure. I SEE HIM AS A HUMAN &gt;&gt; BORN WITH A VISION, BORN WITH A PURPOSE, BORN FOR A CAUSE, but a human. &gt;&gt; And when he fell, HE HAD TO PICK HIMSELF UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When he went to the vineyard, HE HAD TO CORRECT HIS PATH. And you and I will have to do the same thing in this hour or it's not ONLY RELATIONSHIPS WE'LL LOSE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR ETERNITY.
