[53:27] handclap of praise again today

[53:34] [Applause]
[53:39] you may be seated
[53:41] we have so much to thank god for
[53:45] even in the midst of sickness
[53:48] many out today because of
[53:50] fighting symptoms
[53:53] some have had a positive test some
[53:57] are just being cautious
[53:59] some
[54:00] are fighting different kinds of symptoms
[54:04] but you know sister megan she was the
[54:06] first one to reach out
[54:08] to let me know how she was feeling and
[54:10] she said i don't know what it is i don't
[54:12] know if it's the flu or what it is but
[54:13] she said i just want you to know that it
[54:15] was worth it it's worth it to have been
[54:18] in the service tuesday night
[54:20] you said whatever we have and that's the
[54:22] truth you know what god did for us
[54:25] in this house tuesday night is well
[54:28] worth any trial that we have to go
[54:30] through
[54:31] to pay a little price
[54:33] nathan doesn't know this because he i
[54:35] think he had already left and many of
[54:38] you who were streaming the service
[54:40] tuesday night when the streaming was cut
[54:42] off is when service really started
[54:46] god really began to move and
[54:49] nathan obeying the lord last sunday
[54:52] played a role it played a part in what
[54:54] he was what he was speaking out under
[54:57] inspiration
[54:58] right in the middle of the message
[55:01] sister jada heard that and it went deep
[55:03] down into her heart and she said i have
[55:07] got to be there tuesday night
[55:11] and of course brother shane working
[55:13] wasn't able to be here with them or to
[55:15] bring them but
[55:16] she made a decision and he supported
[55:19] that decision
[55:21] i'm so thankful it was just a surprise
[55:24] to us
[55:25] to look up and see her and the kids here
[55:27] tuesday night
[55:28] then later after the service or toward
[55:30] the end of the service she shared that
[55:32] and she reached out to tiffany and
[55:35] um about where they might be able to
[55:38] pitch a tent
[55:39] and uh
[55:41] tiffany's husband who is not a believer
[55:46] he said well i don't know any place like
[55:48] that a campground where they have like
[55:49] that around here but he said that
[55:51] wouldn't be safe anyway
[55:53] and so he agreed which i feel like was
[55:56] sort of supernatural in itself
[55:58] he's not he's not in church by by any
[56:01] means at all
[56:03] and uh
[56:04] there's a sacrifice involved for her to
[56:06] fight through to be here
[56:08] and uh so he agreed to let them spend
[56:11] the night there
[56:12] and then then on tuesday morning tiffany
[56:15] wasn't feeling well and she wanted
[56:17] sister jaya to know she wasn't feeling
[56:19] well not to discourage her from coming
[56:21] in fact she said no i want you to come i
[56:23] just want you to know that i'm really
[56:25] battling in my body so there were more
[56:27] than one thing that could have could
[56:29] have dissuaded her from being in the
[56:32] service tuesday night
[56:34] and yet she fought through
[56:36] when i was sharing with hawk
[56:38] uh these things on the on wednesday i
[56:41] think of this week through text
[56:43] he said you know it reminds me of how
[56:45] brother josh and his wife uh
[56:48] with radical obedience
[56:51] they're just meeting this morning for
[56:52] the first time
[56:54] but with radical obedience he jumped up
[56:57] and and moved his family and and has
[57:00] been greatly he didn't maybe you don't
[57:01] know this but greatly criticized for
[57:03] doing so
[57:05] but felt the urgency to obey and he
[57:08] obeyed he said that's the same kind of
[57:09] urgency that was on sister jada that
[57:12] made her radical obedience i've got to
[57:15] be there
[57:16] and even when it seemed like the service
[57:18] was over coming to an end and i'd
[57:20] already stepped down from the platform i
[57:22] looked over and i had missed zachary
[57:24] sitting there with his hands lifted up
[57:26] in the air and the lord was touching him
[57:28] and the next thing you know well anyway
[57:30] you that were here you know
[57:32] and i have i have said i know of four
[57:36] who have claimed that they have received
[57:38] the baptism of the holy ghost after the
[57:41] service tuesday night and there perhaps
[57:44] were more than that and uh even the
[57:47] spirit of the lord fell on amelia and
[57:49] she's six isn't she
[57:51] the spirit of the lord fell on her and
[57:54] she was so happy she said i'm so happy
[57:57] she said this was the first time i cried
[57:59] in church
[58:00] she was so thrilled
[58:03] and you know he was just pouring himself
[58:05] out and maya had been believing for the
[58:07] lord to do something for her she's
[58:09] claiming that she's one of those in that
[58:12] number that says he filled me with a
[58:14] holy ghost and she woke her granny up i
[58:17] don't know she was sleeping or not
[58:18] sister terry but she woke her up to call
[58:20] her and tell her what the lord had done
[58:22] for her
[58:23] so if you miss tuesday night we can't
[58:25] duplicate it
[58:27] no no video record of it
[58:30] but we pray that it'll happen again and
[58:32] again and again and again and again and
[58:34] again and again and we know that god
[58:37] this is how god has moved for us many
[58:39] times in the past he started moving on
[58:42] our children and our teenagers and our
[58:44] young people
[58:46] and
[58:47] we had a word from the lord here some
[58:48] sometime back i don't know exactly when
[58:50] it was but hawk mentioned it this
[58:52] morning
[58:53] in my office where the lord said don't
[58:55] be so quick to get out of here
[58:58] you should just tarry even as the
[59:01] service is ending and worship me i want
[59:03] to meet you
[59:05] and he said
[59:06] something like you know
[59:08] even after some have already gone home
[59:11] i i will and he's been faithful and i
[59:14] believe it's just the beginning we have
[59:16] so much to thank god for
[59:18] can you say man
[59:20] let me sing just a little something and
[59:21] we'll let these musicians go down and
[59:25] huh
[59:26] this is not working
[59:28] how do brand new microphones not work
[59:32] all right
[59:36] eagles
[59:43] i was
[59:44] standing on
[59:47] a mountain
[59:50] i was looking
[59:52] toward
[59:54] the sky
[59:57] when i saw
[59:59] that storm
[1:00:00] approaching
[1:00:03] and i feared that i would
[1:00:07] die
[1:00:11] saw god's creed
[1:00:15] run and seek
[1:00:17] a better
[1:00:19] place to hide
[1:00:23] heard the thunder roll
[1:00:27] in my soul
[1:00:30] then i bow
[1:00:33] my head
[1:00:37] and cry
[1:00:43] now the clouds
[1:00:45] were moving
[1:00:47] faster
[1:00:50] that lightning
[1:00:52] was
[1:00:52] splashing bright
[1:00:57] clouds so dark they hid the light of the
[1:01:02] sun
[1:01:03] till it seemed
[1:01:05] that it was nice
[1:01:10] all but all at once
[1:01:13] there was a feeling
[1:01:16] like i'd never
[1:01:19] had before
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:24] above the storm
[1:01:26] you should have heard me sing

[1:02:46] above it all

[1:02:54] to move

[1:06:32] you better be seated just a moment
[1:06:34] um
[1:06:41] we want to continue to remember sister
[1:06:43] anita curry in prayer
[1:06:45] she stands in desperate need of the
[1:06:47] lord's help and today
[1:06:49] is her birthday so we want to ask the
[1:06:51] lord to meet her
[1:06:53] how many of you know he can reach right
[1:06:54] to where she is
[1:06:56] he can reach her and he can minister to
[1:06:58] her need and we want to lift her up to
[1:07:01] the lord in prayer and sister kathy
[1:07:04] her birthday is on friday of this week
[1:07:08] so we want to wish her a happy birthday
[1:07:09] as well
[1:07:11] and pray that she is feeling better much
[1:07:14] better by then
[1:07:16] and then on saturday of this coming week
[1:07:20] is our baby girl's birthday
[1:07:23] and she's certainly not a baby anymore
[1:07:27] she's going to be 16.
[1:07:29] it's really hard for me to believe that
[1:07:31] mariah is turning 16 next saturday
[1:07:35] which means benjamin has a birthday on
[1:07:38] sunday but we don't mention sunday
[1:07:39] birthdays
[1:07:41] just through saturday
[1:07:43] so would you just let's just wish all of
[1:07:46] them a happy birthday with a little
[1:07:47] recognition
[1:07:49] and pray for them
[1:07:51] [Applause]
[1:07:53] last sunday when i came to the pulpit i
[1:07:56] wanted to mention
[1:07:58] the
[1:07:59] reception that had been held
[1:08:02] on the border
[1:08:04] in
[1:08:06] washington state
[1:08:08] the border with canada
[1:08:10] for solomon and zion
[1:08:13] and i wanted to mention it uh for one
[1:08:16] real reason and that is that
[1:08:19] solomon's pastor brother john andes has
[1:08:22] been so kind to reach out to us on
[1:08:25] several occasions since the
[1:08:28] wedding
[1:08:29] and to say every time how blessed he was
[1:08:32] with the atmosphere
[1:08:34] and with the service for their wedding
[1:08:36] and how touched of god he was
[1:08:39] and he knew that we didn't get to be
[1:08:41] there with him that day to celebrate so
[1:08:44] he sent voice messages to me several
[1:08:47] that morning and i answered them right
[1:08:49] away and then he started sending
[1:08:50] pictures and video clips so that we
[1:08:54] could share a little bit of what was
[1:08:55] going on there and i i thought that was
[1:08:59] it was remarkable enough that i wanted
[1:09:01] to mention to you it's just real
[1:09:02] courtesy and real kindness
[1:09:05] of a fellow pastor to do something like
[1:09:07] that knowing that that our hearts are
[1:09:10] pretty tender
[1:09:11] about
[1:09:12] zion
[1:09:13] moving from here to another place
[1:09:15] although we want her certainly to be
[1:09:17] with her husband yes that's right we
[1:09:19] want that
[1:09:21] but i just thought it was exceptional
[1:09:23] that he would take the time to keep me
[1:09:26] posted and send pictures and updates and
[1:09:29] also i heard from him this week they
[1:09:31] were having a fair uh some kind of
[1:09:34] community fair several thousands
[1:09:38] i don't remember exactly how many
[1:09:40] i want to say up maybe close to 200 000
[1:09:43] people would be coming through that fair
[1:09:45] i could have that off a little bit but
[1:09:48] they hit the church there set up a booth
[1:09:51] and they they made a nice display there
[1:09:54] and they made a a booklet from a from a
[1:09:58] pdf file
[1:09:59] that shares some of the outstanding
[1:10:02] testimonies that have been taking place
[1:10:03] around the world
[1:10:05] around the message of the hour
[1:10:07] and it was really impressive what they
[1:10:10] were doing i saw brother jason demars
[1:10:13] was there with them for this time
[1:10:15] and they're just you know it's a
[1:10:16] witnessing booth
[1:10:18] they're just set up out there in the
[1:10:20] public where people come to
[1:10:22] to buy knickknacks and vegetables i
[1:10:25] don't know what all they have an affair
[1:10:27] or a festival like that probably a lot
[1:10:29] of good food well i don't know that is
[1:10:31] uh
[1:10:32] anyway
[1:10:34] not not southern food but i'm sure it's
[1:10:36] delicious
[1:10:37] and uh people were coming and and
[1:10:40] hearing and standing there listening and
[1:10:42] different
[1:10:43] brothers and sisters in the church
[1:10:45] sharing the truth and
[1:10:47] providing information and
[1:10:50] literature that they could take it home
[1:10:52] you know i think that's just outstanding
[1:10:55] i wanted to mention that you never know
[1:10:57] that god might lay something like that
[1:10:58] on your heart and you might want to be a
[1:11:01] witness for the truth that god has sent
[1:11:03] to us
[1:11:04] i want you to know that it's it's
[1:11:06] important enough that we ought to want
[1:11:08] to tell it to somebody and if we don't
[1:11:10] know how to tell it we just ask god to
[1:11:12] give us grace
[1:11:13] and give us wisdom and leadership on how
[1:11:15] to share it because it needs to be
[1:11:17] shared how many of you can agree with
[1:11:20] that
[1:11:20] all right let's stand together
[1:11:23] and thank you for listening to all that
[1:11:25] i wanted to get that out last sunday and
[1:11:27] we were having so many problems with the
[1:11:29] stream
[1:11:31] and uh
[1:11:32] i mean
[1:11:33] way beyond even what you know
[1:11:37] and and uh hawk we we took what we had
[1:11:41] of the service
[1:11:44] and we uh
[1:11:46] he
[1:11:47] made sure that it was uploaded
[1:11:51] to
[1:11:52] sub splash which is our our app and
[1:11:55] which is our website
[1:11:58] and when the file was there rj saw it
[1:12:01] was gonna i think he was gonna do
[1:12:03] something with it for so that it would
[1:12:04] be on the app and there was nothing it
[1:12:06] wouldn't play
[1:12:07] so even after the fact
[1:12:10] the enemy was still fighting that
[1:12:13] and so now it is not it's still a
[1:12:15] processing so it's not available to
[1:12:17] watch right now but it's on the app
[1:12:20] so perhaps by the end of the day
[1:12:22] last sunday service will be up and we've
[1:12:24] had so many people who didn't get to see
[1:12:26] it because they didn't know that it was
[1:12:28] being streamed on someone's telephone
[1:12:31] here
[1:12:32] and so we want to announce to everyone
[1:12:34] streaming the service today that
[1:12:35] probably by the end of the day that
[1:12:37] service that you have asked about and i
[1:12:40] mean dozens of people have asked
[1:12:42] and may god just use it to continue to
[1:12:45] bless them and strengthen them this is
[1:12:47] our desire
[1:12:48] amen are you still here
[1:12:51] good glad to hear it would you turn in
[1:12:54] your bible this morning i would like for
[1:12:57] us to go to the book of numbers

[1:13:29] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:13:32] this is numbers 13 1
[1:13:34] send thou men
[1:13:36] that they may search the land of canaan
[1:13:40] which i give unto the children of israel
[1:13:44] of every tribe of their fathers shall ye
[1:13:48] send a man
[1:13:50] everyone a ruler among them
[1:13:53] and moses by the commandment of the lord
[1:13:56] sent them from the wilderness of peran
[1:14:00] all those men
[1:14:02] who were heads
[1:14:04] of the children of israel
[1:14:06] i want to go down to verse 7
[1:14:08] and moses sent them
[1:14:11] to spy out the land of canaan
[1:14:15] and said unto them
[1:14:17] get you up
[1:14:19] this way
[1:14:21] southward
[1:14:22] and go up into the mountain
[1:14:26] and see the land what it is
[1:14:30] oh excuse me excuse me i said seven
[1:14:33] because
[1:14:34] i uh
[1:14:35] i dropped a one
[1:14:37] thank you all for
[1:14:39] poor poor charity she's trying to figure
[1:14:42] it out
[1:14:43] can we go to verse 17 now and i have it
[1:14:46] wrote here just as plain as day 7
[1:14:48] but it's 17.
[1:14:50] and moses sent them to spy out the land
[1:14:53] of canaan and said unto them get you up
[1:14:56] this way southward and go up into the
[1:15:00] mountain
[1:15:01] and see the land what it is
[1:15:04] and the people that dwelleth therein
[1:15:07] whether they be strong or weak
[1:15:11] few or many and what the land is that
[1:15:15] they dwell in whether it be good or bad
[1:15:19] and the cities they be that they dwell
[1:15:22] in whether in tents or in strongholds
[1:15:26] and what the land is
[1:15:28] whether it be fat or lean
[1:15:31] whether there be wood therein or not
[1:15:34] and be of good courage
[1:15:37] and bring of the fruit of the land
[1:15:40] now the time was the time of the first
[1:15:45] ripe grapes
[1:15:47] and then in verse 23
[1:15:49] they came under the brook of eshkol and
[1:15:52] cut down from thence a branch with one
[1:15:55] cluster of grapes and they bear it
[1:15:58] between two
[1:16:00] upon a staff and they brought of the
[1:16:03] pomegranates and of the figs the place
[1:16:07] was called the brook
[1:16:09] eshkol
[1:16:11] because of the cluster of grapes which
[1:16:14] the children of israel cut down from
[1:16:18] thence can we read a little more
[1:16:20] and they returned from searching of the
[1:16:23] land after 40 days and they went and
[1:16:26] came to moses and aaron and all the
[1:16:29] congregation of the children of israel
[1:16:32] under the wilderness of paran to kadesh
[1:16:36] and brought back word unto them and unto
[1:16:39] all the congregation and showed them the
[1:16:43] fruit of the land and they told him and
[1:16:46] said we came
[1:16:49] unto the land whether thou sentest us
[1:16:52] and surely it floweth with milk and
[1:16:55] honey and this is the fruit of it a few
[1:16:58] more verses
[1:17:00] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:17:03] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:17:06] walled and very great and moreover we
[1:17:10] saw the children of enoch there
[1:17:13] the amalekites dwell in the land of the
[1:17:16] south and the hittites and the jebusites
[1:17:20] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[1:17:23] and the canaanites dwell by the sea
[1:17:27] and by the coast of jordan that's a
[1:17:29] whole lot of ice living in the land
[1:17:31] isn't it and caleb still the people
[1:17:34] before moses and said let us go up at
[1:17:39] once
[1:17:40] and possess it
[1:17:42] for our we
[1:17:44] are
[1:17:45] well
[1:17:46] able to
[1:17:48] overcome it
[1:17:51] hear what he said
[1:17:53] let us
[1:17:54] go up at once
[1:17:56] and possess it for we are well
[1:18:00] able to
[1:18:02] overcome it
[1:18:05] nothing will stand in our way
[1:18:07] this was his testimony lord jesus we
[1:18:10] thank you this morning for your word it
[1:18:13] is life to us
[1:18:16] we thank you that you are even right now
[1:18:18] pulling us together in mind and spirit
[1:18:22] that we might
[1:18:23] fall under your anointing in this house
[1:18:27] lord we're not asking you to anoint your
[1:18:30] word it is anointed from the beginning
[1:18:33] but would you anoint our hearts would
[1:18:36] you anoint our spirits to receive your
[1:18:39] word with gladness may we open up every
[1:18:43] part of who we are that your word might
[1:18:46] penetrate and have its maximum
[1:18:48] effectiveness in us and would you anoint
[1:18:51] lips of clay
[1:18:53] and the mortal voice that i might be
[1:18:55] able to yield myself to whatever it is
[1:18:58] that you desire to do among us and we
[1:19:01] will give you the glory and the honor
[1:19:04] for it is in the name above every name
[1:19:07] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:19:09] pray and the saints said
[1:19:12] you may be seated let's continue to read
[1:19:14] verse 31
[1:19:16] but the men
[1:19:17] that went up with him said
[1:19:20] we be not able to go up against the
[1:19:24] people
[1:19:25] for they
[1:19:26] are stronger
[1:19:28] than we
[1:19:30] now here is one brother giving a report
[1:19:34] nothing will stand before us
[1:19:37] we are more than able to go up now and
[1:19:41] take the land
[1:19:42] nothing will be able to overcome us
[1:19:45] and here are the men one man
[1:19:48] and men
[1:19:50] m-a-n one man and men of course we know
[1:19:53] that joshua and caleb were standing
[1:19:55] together
[1:19:56] but we have the report of one man
[1:19:59] and we have the report of men
[1:20:02] two out of out of 12
[1:20:05] gave a positive
[1:20:07] faith-filled report
[1:20:09] and the other ten
[1:20:11] we like to say gave a negative report
[1:20:14] but the bible said they gave an evil
[1:20:16] report and how many of you know there's
[1:20:19] a difference in being just negative and
[1:20:21] being evil
[1:20:23] when we taught you from the book of
[1:20:25] genesis when we see the word good
[1:20:29] in those first few chapters of genesis
[1:20:32] the hebrew word for good is tov t.o.v
[1:20:37] let's say that together tov
[1:20:39] and when we hear god say that it's not
[1:20:43] only good but it's very good the hebrew
[1:20:46] word is tov
[1:20:48] mayod
[1:20:49] and there are many words in the hebrew
[1:20:51] language for bad
[1:20:54] and they could be used but instead god
[1:20:57] the opposite of good
[1:21:00] for for god in moses 1 excuse me in
[1:21:04] genesis 1 through moses the opposite was
[1:21:07] not bad the opposite was evil the word
[1:21:11] is ra
[1:21:12] and so when when we are not in agreement
[1:21:16] with what god has promised
[1:21:19] and when we speak something from our
[1:21:22] being that is not in agreement with what
[1:21:24] god's word has said god doesn't say
[1:21:27] that's being negative
[1:21:29] that's what we say to one another don't
[1:21:31] be so negative
[1:21:33] but that's not what god calls it at all
[1:21:35] he calls it evil
[1:21:37] did you know the book of genesis helps
[1:21:39] us to understand when we are not
[1:21:42] bringing forth what we have been called
[1:21:44] to bring forth
[1:21:45] god doesn't call that a disappointment
[1:21:50] god doesn't call that being backslid
[1:21:52] when we are not manifesting what god has
[1:21:55] called us to manifest the hebrew
[1:21:58] language calls it evil
[1:22:00] and when god said you can overcome all
[1:22:03] things
[1:22:04] and we start making excuses for why
[1:22:06] people have not yet overcome
[1:22:09] when god says i want to give you total
[1:22:12] deliverance and we start explaining why
[1:22:15] you may not have total deliverance god
[1:22:17] doesn't call that being negative
[1:22:21] yeah i want to tell it today
[1:22:23] he calls that being evil
[1:22:26] so it's possible that even churches are
[1:22:30] giving evil reports
[1:22:32] not not just negative reports but evil
[1:22:35] reports when we are calling the shot
[1:22:38] only by what we can see with the natural
[1:22:42] eye in spite of what god has already
[1:22:45] said he wanted to do god doesn't call
[1:22:47] that negative
[1:22:50] he calls it evil
[1:22:52] so i want you and i to watch our words
[1:22:55] and we need to watch our thoughts and we
[1:22:58] need to watch our words and we need to
[1:23:00] watch what we come into agreement with
[1:23:03] we need to ask the holy spirit to reform
[1:23:07] and reshape our vocabulary so that when
[1:23:10] we open our mouth we are speaking the
[1:23:13] things that come into alignment with
[1:23:16] what god has said it's not only possible
[1:23:20] it's imminent
[1:23:21] it's not only possible that god is going
[1:23:24] to give us total deliverance it is upon
[1:23:27] us
[1:23:28] and this is the hour to claim it as we
[1:23:30] have never claimed it before if you
[1:23:33] believe that i want to hear you say
[1:23:34] something
[1:23:36] this is the hour where god desires to
[1:23:39] bring all the fruit into our lives of
[1:23:42] who we are as believers
[1:23:44] and that's how we started this service
[1:23:47] last sunday by reading mark chapter 16.
[1:23:52] can we go there just a moment
[1:23:54] mark chapter 16 verses 15-18
[1:23:59] and he said unto them go ye
[1:24:03] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:24:07] to every
[1:24:09] creature
[1:24:10] we are not to decide who gets to hear it
[1:24:14] and who doesn't get to hear it we're not
[1:24:16] judging by the standard of our eyes
[1:24:19] whether someone has the capacity or the
[1:24:22] ability to believe or not we are to go
[1:24:25] and tell the good news to every creature
[1:24:28] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:24:31] be what
[1:24:33] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[1:24:35] what
[1:24:36] damn what is your commission not to save
[1:24:39] them
[1:24:40] not to damn them
[1:24:42] your commission is to tell them the good
[1:24:46] news
[1:24:48] preach the gospel to every creature and
[1:24:52] this was god's promise
[1:24:54] and these signs
[1:25:00] shall
[1:25:01] follow them
[1:25:03] that believe
[1:25:05] in my name
[1:25:07] shall they cast out devils
[1:25:10] come on now they shall speak with new
[1:25:14] tongues
[1:25:15] they shall take up servants and if they
[1:25:18] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:25:22] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:25:25] and you tell me what will happen
[1:25:28] we're living below our means
[1:25:31] we're dealing with things that we
[1:25:33] shouldn't have to be dealing with as his
[1:25:35] bride in this late hour and why is that
[1:25:39] because we lay down and accept status
[1:25:41] quo
[1:25:43] and we got this idea that this is how
[1:25:45] it's been and so this is how it always
[1:25:47] will be but i want you to know it takes
[1:25:50] a joshua and a caleb
[1:25:52] who said i saw just what you saw i saw
[1:25:55] the same giants you saw i saw the same
[1:25:58] walled cities you saw i saw the same
[1:26:01] circumstances and difficulties that you
[1:26:04] saw but i choose to believe that god
[1:26:08] said i'm going to give you this land
[1:26:12] and i'm going to give you strength to
[1:26:14] dispossess the enemy
[1:26:16] to drive him out
[1:26:19] to take away his squatters rights to
[1:26:22] evict him from camping on the promise
[1:26:26] that you and i are supposed to possess
[1:26:28] is anybody with me
[1:26:30] we have victory because he says we do
[1:26:34] but we have got to make a choice
[1:26:36] he goes on
[1:26:38] let's read just a little bit more
[1:26:41] uh
[1:26:45] verse 32
[1:26:47] again
[1:26:48] and they brought me up
[1:26:51] an evil report
[1:26:54] of the land
[1:26:56] which they have searched unto the
[1:26:58] children of israel saying
[1:27:01] the land
[1:27:04] through
[1:27:05] which they had searched excuse me the
[1:27:07] land through which we have gone to
[1:27:10] search it is a land
[1:27:12] that eateth up
[1:27:14] the inhabitants
[1:27:16] thereof
[1:27:19] i want to read that again
[1:27:21] the land through which we have gone to
[1:27:24] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:27:27] inhabitants thereof i
[1:27:30] i strongly doubt that
[1:27:33] is there anybody here that strongly
[1:27:35] doubts that
[1:27:36] i strongly doubt that the promised land
[1:27:39] was opening up and swallowing
[1:27:41] inhabitants
[1:27:43] i think that we are venturing into the
[1:27:46] land
[1:27:47] of exaggeration
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] and all the people that we saw in it
[1:27:57] are men of great stature again not so
[1:28:02] they're not all tall
[1:28:04] there were some shorties there
[1:28:07] there were some average men there come
[1:28:09] on
[1:28:10] they saw the sons of enact they saw
[1:28:14] giants there and they chose to put
[1:28:17] everybody in the same category
[1:28:20] they're all giants
[1:28:22] they're all men of a great stature and
[1:28:25] we now know in fact with archaeology we
[1:28:28] can even prove
[1:28:29] that the canaanites in general were not
[1:28:32] very tall men
[1:28:35] we've even been able to prove that by
[1:28:37] archaeology so this again was an
[1:28:40] exaggeration the earth is not opening up
[1:28:43] and swallowing its own inhabitants
[1:28:46] this is an exaggeration and every man in
[1:28:50] this land is not of great stature again
[1:28:54] this is an exaggeration see what happens
[1:28:56] when you release an evil report it
[1:28:59] filters everything you see and perceive
[1:29:04] you filter everything through your
[1:29:07] negativity which is really evilness it's
[1:29:10] really evil
[1:29:11] and everything filters through that so
[1:29:14] what comes out of your mouth is usually
[1:29:17] a mixture
[1:29:20] of truth
[1:29:22] and exaggeration anybody following what
[1:29:25] i'm saying and god said that that's not
[1:29:27] just a minor offense
[1:29:29] this is an evil offense
[1:29:31] this is serious business
[1:29:33] we didn't send you in there to say that
[1:29:35] god's not able we sent you in there just
[1:29:38] to report the facts
[1:29:40] only the facts
[1:29:42] no exaggeration
[1:29:44] they're not all tall
[1:29:46] they're the ground isn't swallowing them
[1:29:48] up you saw some walled cities and
[1:29:51] they're great you saw some giants in the
[1:29:53] land but they're not all giants and if
[1:29:56] god said it belongs to us
[1:30:00] caleb said we are more than able
[1:30:03] if we'll just go up right now no
[1:30:05] training
[1:30:08] no army camps and training manuals if
[1:30:11] we'll just go up right now god will give
[1:30:13] it to us
[1:30:14] two
[1:30:16] with with wonderful report
[1:30:20] two
[1:30:21] with grapes
[1:30:23] ten
[1:30:24] with gripes
[1:30:27] that was so powerful griping
[1:30:30] bellyaching
[1:30:31] negative and evil speech is so powerful
[1:30:36] when it releases into the atmosphere it
[1:30:38] falls back down on whoever is vulnerable
[1:30:42] to hear this evil report it shifts our
[1:30:45] faith to doubt it causes unbelief to
[1:30:48] rise up it causes us to begin to make
[1:30:51] excuses for where we really are
[1:30:54] it causes us to be borderline believers
[1:30:57] it causes us to be satisfied living
[1:30:59] close enough to see the promise but not
[1:31:02] being able to hold it in our hand i'm
[1:31:04] not satisfied church to see what god can
[1:31:07] do or wants to do or might do through a
[1:31:10] people in the last days i want to reach
[1:31:12] in and take a hold of it as my own
[1:31:17] we can't be borderline believers living
[1:31:20] in the borderlands
[1:31:22] we've got to say hey it's there for the
[1:31:24] taking
[1:31:26] he goes on
[1:31:27] and there we saw the giants
[1:31:33] the sons of anak
[1:31:35] which come of the giants
[1:31:38] and we were in our own side here's the
[1:31:40] problem
[1:31:49] didn't say we're in each other's sight
[1:31:52] it said and we were in our own sight
[1:31:56] as grasshoppers now how does one see
[1:31:59] themselves
[1:32:00] as a grasshopper
[1:32:02] they don't do that with their eyes
[1:32:04] they do that with their what
[1:32:06] they do that with their mind
[1:32:08] they do that with their imagination
[1:32:11] they didn't really see grasshoppers in
[1:32:13] the land they really saw giants
[1:32:16] and they really felt like in their in
[1:32:17] their minds they felt like that they
[1:32:20] were just little grasshoppers and when
[1:32:22] you begin to see yourself as a
[1:32:23] grasshopper instead of a mighty giant
[1:32:27] you cut yourself off from what god is
[1:32:30] able to do in your life
[1:32:32] is anybody with me then look this way
[1:32:38] when you cut yourself off in your own
[1:32:41] mind
[1:32:42] from being what god has called you to be
[1:32:45] nobody can help you
[1:32:47] you're the only one that can help
[1:32:49] yourself
[1:32:50] you're the only one that can say wait a
[1:32:51] minute i may feel like a grasshopper
[1:32:54] but i'm not a grasshopper i'm an
[1:32:57] overcomer i may feel like a defeated
[1:32:59] folk but i'm not a defeated foe i'm
[1:33:01] really an overcomer i may feel like i'll
[1:33:04] never get rid of some of these things
[1:33:06] that trouble my life but i will because
[1:33:09] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:33:12] is in the world
[1:33:14] come on now
[1:33:15] you see being a borderline believer is a
[1:33:18] mindset
[1:33:20] it's a mindset and being satisfied to
[1:33:22] live on the borderland when you can go
[1:33:24] in and take the possession that god has
[1:33:26] promised you that's a mindset
[1:33:29] so we have to break that mindset and
[1:33:31] there's only one thing that breaks an
[1:33:33] evil report and a bad mindset and that
[1:33:36] is the truth of god's word
[1:33:38] we are well able
[1:33:40] we need a good report in a sea of
[1:33:42] negative reports
[1:33:44] we need a good report in a sea of evil
[1:33:47] reports we need somebody to say there
[1:33:50] will be an overcomer in the end time and
[1:33:53] if there's only one i
[1:33:56] am that one
[1:33:58] there will be a bride's revival manifest
[1:34:01] in the end time and if it only manifests
[1:34:04] for one
[1:34:07] there will be the reality of the
[1:34:09] creative spoken word manifested in the
[1:34:13] body
[1:34:16] and if there's only one to do it
[1:34:23] i am he
[1:34:27] you with me
[1:34:30] in the fifth seal they don't have this
[1:34:34] in the fifth seal
[1:34:36] you can have it for yourself you can
[1:34:38] look it up it's paragraph 24 for you
[1:34:40] that have the app on your phone
[1:34:48] he said but i believe
[1:34:51] i i'm not going to speak it in his name
[1:34:56] i'm going to speak it in my
[1:34:59] in the revelation of my faith
[1:35:02] that's good enough for me
[1:35:04] what happened in sabino canyon the other
[1:35:06] day
[1:35:08] i believe that the hour is approaching
[1:35:13] missing limbs
[1:35:15] will be restored
[1:35:19] 1963 322 fifth seal
[1:35:23] said i'm not saying this in the in his
[1:35:25] name
[1:35:26] but i'm speaking this in the revelation
[1:35:29] of my faith that what happened in sabino
[1:35:31] canyon the other day i believe that the
[1:35:33] hour is approaching when missing limbs
[1:35:36] will be restored
[1:35:38] and the glorious power of the creator i
[1:35:42] believe
[1:35:44] if he can make a squirrel appear that
[1:35:46] has no
[1:35:48] here is the man or woman just got a part
[1:35:50] missing
[1:35:52] and that's complete animal in itself he
[1:35:54] is god i love him
[1:35:57] and he goes on
[1:35:59] well you say wait a minute that's just
[1:36:00] one little isolated place there where he
[1:36:03] spoke well i want you to know there's
[1:36:05] something inside of me that grabs a hold
[1:36:07] of that and says i'm going to be one of
[1:36:10] them
[1:36:11] i'm going to be one of them that speaks
[1:36:12] the creative word of god and watches a
[1:36:15] missing limb a missing finger a missing
[1:36:17] arm a missing leg a missing foot
[1:36:19] material i'm going to be one of them
[1:36:22] now we don't need anybody saying i doubt
[1:36:24] that i will or i doubt that i can or i'm
[1:36:26] not sure it'll even be brother banham
[1:36:28] didn't say it in the name of the lord
[1:36:30] there's a lot of other things he didn't
[1:36:31] say in the name of the lord that people
[1:36:32] are claiming
[1:36:34] but i am claiming that there is going to
[1:36:36] be a people in the last days who rise up
[1:36:40] they decide to quit living as a
[1:36:43] borderline believer
[1:36:45] dwelling in the borderland
[1:36:47] and they say if god says it's possible
[1:36:50] i'm going to be a part of that
[1:36:53] i'm going to be a part of that
[1:36:55] i'm going to be a part of that
[1:36:57] we were in our own site as grasshoppers
[1:37:00] you better not look at yourself as you
[1:37:01] think
[1:37:03] because a man as a man thinketh in his
[1:37:04] heart so he is
[1:37:07] so he is
[1:37:09] that's what the word said
[1:37:10] so we better be thinking of ourselves as
[1:37:12] god sees us
[1:37:14] amen
[1:37:15] now let's go to numbers 14.
[1:37:18] read a little bit more i know we're
[1:37:19] having a time pressing through but
[1:37:21] that's all right we'll do it
[1:37:22] there's a reason
[1:37:24] and all the congregation verse 1 and all
[1:37:28] the congregation lifted up their voice
[1:37:30] and cried
[1:37:31] and the people wept that night we're
[1:37:32] going all the way to verse 12.
[1:37:34] and all the children of israel murmured
[1:37:37] against moses and against aaron and the
[1:37:40] whole congregation said unto them this
[1:37:43] this is the next chapter and the whole
[1:37:45] congregation said unto them would god
[1:37:48] that we had died in the land of egypt or
[1:37:51] would god we had died in this wilderness
[1:37:54] now i want you to know this evil report
[1:37:56] is having quite an effect
[1:37:59] they're already now beginning to walk
[1:38:01] out the results
[1:38:02] of what came out of their mouth
[1:38:04] now they're discouraged
[1:38:08] now they're discouraged now they're
[1:38:09] depressed
[1:38:11] now they don't have faith for anything
[1:38:13] and it just comes pouring out of their
[1:38:15] mouth and the first thing they do is
[1:38:17] they blame their leaders
[1:38:18] this is very very common we understand
[1:38:20] this it's nothing new
[1:38:22] and now they're almost blaming their god
[1:38:25] because they say i would to god we just
[1:38:28] died in the wilderness
[1:38:30] come on now something's wrong with
[1:38:31] people with this kind of a report coming
[1:38:33] out of their mouth this kind of
[1:38:34] confession let's go on and wherefore had
[1:38:37] the lord brought us unto this land to
[1:38:39] fall by the sword that our wives and
[1:38:42] children should be a prey were it not
[1:38:44] better for us
[1:38:52] it's just a handful of giants
[1:38:58] there really ain't that many of them
[1:39:01] it's just one family
[1:39:05] this one family
[1:39:07] they all got the same papa
[1:39:10] this one family
[1:39:12] and here's their attitude
[1:39:15] it'd be better for us to go back to
[1:39:16] egypt
[1:39:17] than to die out here and you know what
[1:39:19] in some ways i almost can't agree with
[1:39:21] that because i hear jesus saying i would
[1:39:23] that thou art hot or cold
[1:39:26] i would that you were either in the
[1:39:27] promised land or in egypt
[1:39:30] but to live over here in the borderland
[1:39:33] it's a sad shame
[1:39:35] for you to be satisfied with less than
[1:39:37] what god has made available to you if
[1:39:39] you'll just raise up and claim it
[1:39:41] we're not better for us to return into
[1:39:44] egypt let's go on and they said one to
[1:39:46] another let us make a captain god's
[1:39:49] already given you a captain
[1:39:51] he's already given you a prophet to lead
[1:39:53] you
[1:39:54] and here they say let us make a captain
[1:39:56] and let us return into egypt this
[1:39:59] doesn't sound very smart to me and then
[1:40:01] moses and aaron fell on their faces
[1:40:04] before all the assembly of the
[1:40:05] congregation of the children of israel
[1:40:08] and joshua the son of noon and caleb the
[1:40:11] son of jephena which were of them that
[1:40:13] searched the land rent their clothes
[1:40:17] they tear their clothes in in a gesture
[1:40:21] of grief
[1:40:23] and repentance
[1:40:24] and they spake unto all the company of
[1:40:27] the children of israel saying the land
[1:40:29] which we pass through to search it is an
[1:40:32] exceeding
[1:40:34] good
[1:40:35] land
[1:40:37] this was a gentle way of saying it's
[1:40:38] worth it
[1:40:40] we know you all haven't been there
[1:40:43] but we've been there
[1:40:44] and we've experienced enough of the
[1:40:46] goodness of the land that we would just
[1:40:49] like to say it's far better than egypt
[1:40:52] it's a good land
[1:40:54] it's a good thing to have
[1:40:56] it's a good thing to possess
[1:40:58] if the lord delight in us
[1:41:00] then he will bring us into this land and
[1:41:03] give it us he's already promised it to
[1:41:05] them a land which floweth with milk and
[1:41:08] honey
[1:41:09] only rebel not ye against the lord
[1:41:13] neither fear ye the people of the land
[1:41:16] for they are
[1:41:17] bred
[1:41:18] for us
[1:41:24] there it is
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:28] i eat giants for my bread
[1:41:32] you know the line from the song
[1:41:36] giants eat bread
[1:41:39] believers eat giants
[1:41:42] what a report
[1:41:43] what a report
[1:41:45] you know he's not meaning literally i'm
[1:41:46] going to eat them he's saying there are
[1:41:48] no more there's no more than just an
[1:41:51] apple in your hand to take a big bite
[1:41:53] off of
[1:41:55] they're no more than a slice of bread
[1:41:56] laying somewhere in the tent they are
[1:41:58] not able to defeat us
[1:42:00] it's only us that can defeat ourselves
[1:42:03] if we don't get up out of this molly
[1:42:05] grub
[1:42:06] if we don't make a stand now
[1:42:10] we'll be defeated all right but not by
[1:42:12] giants and walled cities
[1:42:15] we'll be defeated by our own confession
[1:42:18] how serious this is
[1:42:20] he said only rebel not he against the
[1:42:22] lord neither fear you the people of the
[1:42:23] land for they are bred for us
[1:42:26] their defense is departed from them
[1:42:29] and the lord is with us
[1:42:32] fear
[1:42:33] them
[1:42:34] not
[1:42:36] this is a word of prophecy
[1:42:39] what has caused them to thrive in the
[1:42:41] past
[1:42:42] and to be protected in the past is no
[1:42:44] longer with them because god has given
[1:42:46] them into our hands and there are no
[1:42:49] walls tall enough
[1:42:52] there are no cities large enough strong
[1:42:54] enough there are no giants tall enough
[1:42:57] to keep us from overcoming if we are a
[1:43:00] mind to go forward in the name of the
[1:43:02] lord he so let's go on fear them not
[1:43:06] but all the congregation made stone them
[1:43:10] with stones
[1:43:14] there's one thing i've learned about
[1:43:15] negative people
[1:43:19] they don't like being around people that
[1:43:21] aren't negative
[1:43:25] you know it never bothers me when people
[1:43:27] have friends in the church
[1:43:29] that are closer to them
[1:43:31] than other friends that doesn't bother
[1:43:33] me
[1:43:34] i believe we're one body
[1:43:36] i believe we should be one family but i
[1:43:38] have learned in my life that there are
[1:43:40] people that i can fellowship with easier
[1:43:42] than others there are people that make
[1:43:43] me nervous they don't mean to it's not
[1:43:46] not some big problem with them but they
[1:43:48] just do maybe some little things some
[1:43:50] condition or something they have or some
[1:43:52] of the condition i have or something i
[1:43:54] never have thought it was a it was an
[1:43:56] awful evil thing some people do
[1:43:58] but i've been around long enough to
[1:44:00] realize that there are just certain
[1:44:01] situations that that that we ought to
[1:44:04] just let god handle and let him take
[1:44:06] care and not be so worried about things
[1:44:08] like that but here's what i do worry
[1:44:10] about as a pastor when i see negative
[1:44:12] people clumping up
[1:44:15] you know what click i'm concerned about
[1:44:17] i'm concerned about the negative click
[1:44:22] i'm concerned because misery loves
[1:44:25] company
[1:44:27] negativity loves negativity
[1:44:31] evil speakers love evil speakers when
[1:44:34] you see people drawing to one another on
[1:44:37] an
[1:44:38] another level that's the kind of click
[1:44:40] i'm against
[1:44:41] i'm against it because it will defeat a
[1:44:43] whole nation
[1:44:45] it'll bring a whole people down and now
[1:44:48] these that have a positive report well
[1:44:51] they're just dreaming
[1:44:58] you know i mentioned this before i think
[1:45:00] i want to make the devil a little madder
[1:45:03] we're sitting in the back and i'm
[1:45:04] speaking to some of the brothers
[1:45:07] about the studio and about the direction
[1:45:09] of what we would like to see the lord do
[1:45:13] and talking about the promises and
[1:45:16] in some way i i feel like i'm trying to
[1:45:18] sell something a little bit
[1:45:21] because who's ever heard of taking pews
[1:45:24] out of a church
[1:45:26] and
[1:45:27] putting a a studio right inside the
[1:45:29] sanctuary
[1:45:31] we didn't have money to build a separate
[1:45:33] building and god had given us a prophecy
[1:45:35] that he was going to use this
[1:45:37] and for more than one he was going to
[1:45:39] give us a pulpit to the nations and we
[1:45:40] have one there anytime we want to use it
[1:45:42] it's there to use
[1:45:44] don't you be discouraged because god's
[1:45:46] going to use it
[1:45:47] for his glory
[1:45:49] and i'm thinking now we could maybe put
[1:45:52] in a floating floor
[1:45:54] right above the carpet
[1:45:56] so that
[1:45:57] we can take that up
[1:45:59] and the pews could go right back and
[1:46:01] that wall everything that you see there
[1:46:04] can be taken out
[1:46:06] the window is still there it's boarded
[1:46:08] up but there's a window there all we
[1:46:09] have to do is take the board down the
[1:46:11] ceiling fan we can put right back up and
[1:46:14] we could make that exactly like it was
[1:46:16] before we placed the studio there if the
[1:46:18] need would be
[1:46:20] and you know brother greeley how many of
[1:46:22] you know brother greeley his faith is
[1:46:23] there he don't have any problem getting
[1:46:26] a hold of something like that
[1:46:28] and so i'm looking for a little more
[1:46:30] support and here's the support i get
[1:46:31] well
[1:46:33] i guess we have all come to the
[1:46:34] conclusion
[1:46:36] to the understanding that
[1:46:38] as we have believed in the past
[1:46:40] it appears that the church is never
[1:46:42] going to be full
[1:46:48] so there really won't be any harm taking
[1:46:51] those pews out because we'll never need
[1:46:53] that space
[1:46:57] you know what i pray that the church
[1:46:58] when god really gets in this thing and
[1:47:00] this revival begins to flow
[1:47:02] i i pray that this this room with those
[1:47:05] pews won't hold them i i pray that god
[1:47:07] does what some of us have an idea that
[1:47:09] he's going to do i pray we have to turn
[1:47:11] that tabernacle into a place to worship
[1:47:13] god
[1:47:14] and that souls are delivered and set
[1:47:16] free and changed and
[1:47:18] and somebody said what in the world is
[1:47:20] going to draw somebody like that there's
[1:47:22] a bride out there waiting
[1:47:25] for a true report
[1:47:27] that god is manifesting himself you just
[1:47:30] let a finger come back you just let a
[1:47:33] toe grow back you just let an arm grow
[1:47:35] back
[1:47:36] and those people that have been waiting
[1:47:38] on those promises and waiting on the
[1:47:41] manifestation of the sons of god they're
[1:47:44] going to say i got to see that for
[1:47:45] myself
[1:47:47] it won't be for one place
[1:47:49] but there will be forerunners
[1:47:51] who forerun what god has said he was
[1:47:53] going to do come on now
[1:47:56] how in the world can we function as a
[1:47:59] people with that kind of report
[1:48:02] because what we have known in the past
[1:48:04] doesn't have to be what we know today
[1:48:06] and it doesn't have to be what we know
[1:48:08] tomorrow somebody has got to say if god
[1:48:12] says it
[1:48:14] i believe it
[1:48:17] his word
[1:48:18] cannot lie
[1:48:20] let all men be liars
[1:48:22] but god's word is yea and amen
[1:48:25] so now they're going to stone moses and
[1:48:27] aaron
[1:48:29] they're going to start stoning anybody
[1:48:31] who doesn't have the same negative
[1:48:32] report that they have all the
[1:48:34] congregation made stoned them with stone
[1:48:36] and the glory of the lord appeared my my
[1:48:39] in the greatest moment of persecution
[1:48:43] when their own people were turning
[1:48:45] against them to stone them what does god
[1:48:48] do he comes in the glory
[1:48:51] and the glory of the lord appeared in
[1:48:53] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:48:56] before
[1:48:57] all
[1:49:01] naysayers too
[1:49:03] negative talkers too
[1:49:05] evil report givers too
[1:49:07] before all the children of israel
[1:49:09] now let's read on
[1:49:11] and the lord said unto moses how long
[1:49:13] will this people provoke me and how long
[1:49:16] will it be air they believe me for all
[1:49:18] the signs which i have showed among them
[1:49:21] i will smite them with the pestilence
[1:49:24] and disinherit them this is serious talk
[1:49:27] now and will make of thee a greater
[1:49:30] nation and mightier than they do you
[1:49:32] understand that god was so disturbed by
[1:49:35] this evil report that he said i will
[1:49:38] destroy them all
[1:49:42] i will save you and make a mighty nation
[1:49:46] mightier than they to serve me
[1:49:49] that's i mean that that is
[1:49:52] pretty serious punishment here
[1:49:54] now look at verse 19.
[1:49:57] this is moses stepping up
[1:50:00] this is moses being an intercessor and i
[1:50:03] chose to read all these verses because
[1:50:05] we know the story but it's good sometime
[1:50:06] to grab the details
[1:50:08] he said pardon i beseech thee the
[1:50:10] iniquity of this people according unto
[1:50:13] the greatness of thy mercy and as thou
[1:50:15] hast forgiven this people from egypt
[1:50:18] even until now you've been such a
[1:50:20] forgiving god
[1:50:23] you've had so much mercy on us up to
[1:50:26] this point
[1:50:27] pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of
[1:50:30] this people according unto the greatness
[1:50:32] of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven
[1:50:35] this people from egypt even until now
[1:50:38] and the lord said i
[1:50:40] have pardoned according to thy word
[1:50:45] the faith
[1:50:47] the decree of moses moved god
[1:50:51] and as you have spoken moses i have done
[1:50:54] it's pardoned
[1:50:56] it's over but truly as i live listen all
[1:51:00] the earth shall be filled with the glory
[1:51:03] of the lord because all those men which
[1:51:06] have seen my glory and my miracles which
[1:51:09] i did in egypt and in the wilderness and
[1:51:11] have tempted me now these ten times
[1:51:15] and have not hearkened to my voice
[1:51:18] surely they shall not see the land which
[1:51:21] i swear unto their fathers neither shall
[1:51:24] any of them that provoked me
[1:51:27] see it
[1:51:28] none of the negative none of the evil
[1:51:31] report givers
[1:51:33] but my servant caleb
[1:51:36] because he had another spirit with him
[1:51:39] and hath followed me fully
[1:51:41] him will i bring into the land where
[1:51:45] unto he went and look read it
[1:51:48] his seed
[1:51:50] shall
[1:51:51] possess it
[1:51:53] now the amalekites and the canaanites
[1:51:56] dwelt in the valley
[1:51:58] tomorrow turn you and get you into the
[1:52:01] wilderness by the way of the red sea
[1:52:05] and the lord spake unto moses and unto
[1:52:08] aaron saying how long shall i bear with
[1:52:11] this evil congregation which murmur
[1:52:13] against me i have heard the murmurings
[1:52:16] of the children of israel which they
[1:52:18] murmur against me let's go down to verse
[1:52:20] all the way read all the way to 34. say
[1:52:23] unto them as truly as i live saith the
[1:52:26] lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so
[1:52:30] will i do to you your carcasses shall
[1:52:34] fall in this wilderness and all that
[1:52:37] were numbered of you according to your
[1:52:39] whole number from 20 years old and
[1:52:41] upward which have murmured against me
[1:52:44] doubtless she shall not come into the
[1:52:46] land concerning which i swear to make
[1:52:49] you dwell therein save caleb the son of
[1:52:52] jefferna and yah and joshua the son of
[1:52:55] noon but your little ones which he said
[1:52:59] should be a prey remember this
[1:53:01] declaration
[1:53:02] them will i bring in
[1:53:05] you said they would be food for the
[1:53:07] beast
[1:53:11] you thought they would feed the animals
[1:53:13] of the wilderness but i'm going to bring
[1:53:16] that generation in
[1:53:18] and they shall know
[1:53:23] and they shall know the land which ye
[1:53:26] have despised
[1:53:27] this is how god looks at that evil
[1:53:29] report of people despising their
[1:53:31] birthright
[1:53:32] so don't tell me it's all over when i
[1:53:35] realize it's just beginning
[1:53:37] don't tell me that it's finished when i
[1:53:39] realize it hasn't even come to its full
[1:53:41] manifestation yet
[1:53:43] but as for you your carcasses
[1:53:46] they shall fall in this wilderness
[1:53:48] and your children shall wander in the
[1:53:50] wilderness forty years
[1:53:54] and bear your whoredoms
[1:53:56] until your carcasses be wasted in the
[1:53:58] wilderness now i want you to notice this
[1:54:02] god is saying you are guilty of whoredom
[1:54:07] you have played the that's what
[1:54:09] god's saying about these parents
[1:54:12] you have played the your children
[1:54:15] your whoredoms have to pass and your
[1:54:18] body has to fall like a carcass and your
[1:54:20] children are going to step over your
[1:54:22] carcasses
[1:54:23] to go into the promised land now let me
[1:54:25] ask you what the whoredoms were
[1:54:28] because we don't see in the bible where
[1:54:30] there was a plague of sexual sin among
[1:54:32] that older generation
[1:54:34] so what is it that they have done that
[1:54:37] has made them guilty in the eyes of god
[1:54:41] and
[1:54:41] and he has
[1:54:43] indicted them with the sin of playing
[1:54:46] the or being
[1:54:49] now we all know in the natural that when
[1:54:51] we think of that word that word
[1:54:54] or whoredom we think of a person a
[1:54:56] woman particularly giving herself to one
[1:55:00] man right after another right after
[1:55:01] another right after another mixture all
[1:55:04] of it with no commitment
[1:55:06] right no commitment
[1:55:08] just laying down with one and laying
[1:55:10] down with another and receiving this and
[1:55:12] receiving that and pondering this and
[1:55:15] pondering that instead of staying with
[1:55:17] the word
[1:55:18] see god's going to have a bride that
[1:55:20] eats his pure word
[1:55:22] not
[1:55:23] and listen let me tell you something
[1:55:25] and purity
[1:55:26] in purity if it's a pure word it has to
[1:55:29] be lined up with that written word of
[1:55:33] god that he has preserved for us through
[1:55:35] the years it's got to fit right in that
[1:55:37] word even as the prophet told us it was
[1:55:39] going to you see i'm not hanging my soul
[1:55:41] on a paraphrase
[1:55:44] i'm not hanging my soul on somebody's
[1:55:46] interpretation of the word i'm hanging
[1:55:48] my soul on the word interprets the word
[1:55:51] how many of you know how the word is
[1:55:52] interpreted it's interpreted by the word
[1:55:55] it's by it's interpreted by god bringing
[1:55:57] it to pass so we want to be careful how
[1:56:00] we lay down with this doctrine and lay
[1:56:01] down with that doctrine and with this
[1:56:03] idea and that idea and the other idea
[1:56:07] we want to be careful about google and
[1:56:10] and youtube and all the other ideas out
[1:56:13] there even around this message that we
[1:56:16] know do not line up with the word of god
[1:56:22] do i have to name them i don't think so
[1:56:25] this is the very sin of whoredom
[1:56:28] this is the very thing that god indicted
[1:56:30] his church for a generation ago and this
[1:56:33] is a thing that god indicted his people
[1:56:35] for in the old testament
[1:56:37] your whoredom has been you knew what god
[1:56:40] said but you begin to speak your own
[1:56:43] opinion
[1:56:46] you know i remember something that bob
[1:56:48] jones told me one time
[1:56:50] when we were fellowshipping
[1:56:52] he told me a story about an invitation
[1:56:55] that he kept getting
[1:56:57] and uh he
[1:56:58] he said i i can't go
[1:57:01] i knew that i couldn't go
[1:57:03] because i had an opinion
[1:57:06] i knew the only way that i could ever go
[1:57:08] and be a blessing to that group of
[1:57:10] people
[1:57:10] would be if i if i lost my opinion
[1:57:14] because if i went there with an opinion
[1:57:16] i would miss the mind of the lord i want
[1:57:18] you to know your opinion can cause you
[1:57:20] to miss the mind of the lord your
[1:57:22] opinion in a certain matter about a
[1:57:24] certain situation or about a certain
[1:57:26] person can cause you to miss the
[1:57:27] leadership of the holy spirit so we want
[1:57:30] to be careful in this hour that we
[1:57:32] submit all of our personal opinions to
[1:57:34] the word
[1:57:35] anybody with me i don't know if you
[1:57:37] heard that or not
[1:57:40] if you did i'm expecting that you might
[1:57:42] witness somehow here
[1:57:44] because your opinion can keep you out
[1:57:47] of what god is calling you in
[1:57:49] my opinion can keep me out of what god
[1:57:52] is calling me into your children are
[1:57:54] going to wonder let's go on
[1:57:57] after the number of the days in which
[1:57:59] you search the land even 40 days each
[1:58:02] day for a year shall you bear your
[1:58:04] iniquities even 40 years and ye shall
[1:58:07] know my breach of promise
[1:58:10] let's go on is that it is that the last
[1:58:13] yes that's it for you shall know my
[1:58:16] breach of promise
[1:58:18] now i want to read you from what shall
[1:58:20] we do with this jesus call christ
[1:58:24] paragraph 148 let's stay together for
[1:58:27] just another few minutes
[1:58:29] like the spies on the road to the
[1:58:32] promised land
[1:58:34] they was in an exodus
[1:58:37] coming out of egypt they come out by a
[1:58:40] promised word of god
[1:58:43] how many of you know that's how you came
[1:58:45] out of denominationalism
[1:58:48] you come out by promised word of god god
[1:58:50] made his word known by prophet moses
[1:58:53] sent him down there he was identified
[1:58:55] that he was the god to bring him out
[1:58:58] listen
[1:58:59] he was identified that he was the god to
[1:59:02] bring him out under the conditions that
[1:59:05] he promised to the i am
[1:59:08] when they come to the borderland
[1:59:11] kedesh barnia
[1:59:13] the great
[1:59:14] mistake
[1:59:15] they made
[1:59:17] when they got to the land and looked
[1:59:19] over into the promised land they said
[1:59:22] read that for me
[1:59:24] we can't take it
[1:59:26] what was the other ten
[1:59:28] they looked at the circumstance
[1:59:33] the prestige
[1:59:35] they would lose
[1:59:38] you'd think that when you came to a
[1:59:40] message of the hour like we have you
[1:59:42] think that your pride wouldn't be your
[1:59:44] hindrance and you would think that your
[1:59:46] reputation wouldn't be your hindrance
[1:59:48] and you think that your prestige would
[1:59:50] no longer be your hindrance you would
[1:59:52] think that you would be willing to be
[1:59:54] identified with god's new birth you'd
[1:59:58] think that nothing else would matter to
[2:00:00] you but we find that it's just not
[2:00:03] always so because the enemy is always
[2:00:06] there to remind us of our reputation and
[2:00:08] how we are esteemed you're going to have
[2:00:11] to come to the place where you don't
[2:00:12] care how other people look at you
[2:00:16] you're going to have to come to the
[2:00:17] place where you don't let anybody judge
[2:00:19] your shout
[2:00:20] out
[2:00:21] or your dance or your praise or your
[2:00:24] tongue talking or anything else that god
[2:00:26] does you're gonna have to be fully
[2:00:28] persuaded yourself
[2:00:30] because if you're still worried about
[2:00:32] your prestige
[2:00:42] i'm gonna swallow that
[2:00:45] give me a minute
[2:00:51] what was the other ten they looked at
[2:00:52] the circumstances
[2:00:54] the prestige they would lose
[2:00:57] we are grasshoppers to the side of them
[2:01:00] but joshua and caleb checked up
[2:01:05] it's time for a checkup
[2:01:08] it's time for a checkup
[2:01:10] it's time to ask ourselves the question
[2:01:13] am i a borderline believer
[2:01:15] or am i all the way
[2:01:17] am i sold out
[2:01:19] is there anything standing in my way
[2:01:21] from being everything that god has
[2:01:23] called me to be if there is there's an
[2:01:26] answer
[2:01:27] we can have deliverance
[2:01:29] we can be set free from it do you
[2:01:30] believe that
[2:01:32] but joshua and caleb checked up they
[2:01:34] went back to the word
[2:01:36] and the lord said i give you this land
[2:01:40] it's a good land flowing with milk and
[2:01:42] honey they didn't count what it looked
[2:01:45] like
[2:01:46] what that was what this was and what
[2:01:48] this evidence was
[2:01:50] god's word said i give it to you
[2:01:54] go get it
[2:01:56] and they were the only ones that went in
[2:02:00] said oh let us check the promise of god
[2:02:03] for today
[2:02:05] that's right
[2:02:06] remember
[2:02:08] we're in another exodus
[2:02:10] a time
[2:02:12] an exodus this time
[2:02:14] not into a promised land of the earth
[2:02:17] but into a promised land of glory where
[2:02:20] there is no return no more glory to god
[2:02:24] he said we're going to be there
[2:02:26] will you do it
[2:02:28] while we bow our heads this was the call
[2:02:31] for the altar
[2:02:33] now let's look at another here the mark
[2:02:35] of the beast and the seal of god number
[2:02:37] two
[2:02:38] this is paragraph 68.
[2:02:42] he said just like it says over there
[2:02:45] many gets turned up in that hebrews
[2:02:47] their sea
[2:02:48] if we sin willfully after we receive the
[2:02:51] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[2:02:53] no more sacrifice for sins
[2:02:56] take a motherlock
[2:02:57] someone asked me said what does that
[2:02:59] mean if we sin willfully after we
[2:03:02] receive the knowledge of the truth there
[2:03:04] remaineth no more sacrifice for sin well
[2:03:06] he hasn't never got into it yet that's
[2:03:09] right he just received the knowledge
[2:03:14] of it oh i'm glad
[2:03:17] he said just like in israel when israel
[2:03:20] started a cross going into the promised
[2:03:22] land they sent the spies out two of them
[2:03:25] come back and said we can take it joshua
[2:03:27] and caleb the other one said no we can't
[2:03:30] do it so they hung right there on the
[2:03:32] border listen
[2:03:37] until they died
[2:03:39] and the ones believed the promise went
[2:03:41] over in
[2:03:43] hallelujah like a woman a boy gets a
[2:03:45] call in his life he said well mama
[2:03:47] washed over the washboard to send me to
[2:03:49] school i want to be a minister all right
[2:03:52] he becomes a minister he goes away and
[2:03:54] gets a phd or his doctorate degree or
[2:03:56] whatever he gets he comes back his
[2:03:58] bachelor of art or whatever it is he
[2:04:00] comes back anyhow he's a minister
[2:04:03] then he's always lusting
[2:04:05] and things in his church the ladies and
[2:04:08] the different things maybe smokes and he
[2:04:11] knows he ought to do that say god that
[2:04:13] don't look good for a man of god
[2:04:16] then take that thing away from me he's
[2:04:19] sanctified he comes right up to the
[2:04:22] borderland again he looks right over and
[2:04:25] sees the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:04:27] listen
[2:04:28] listen
[2:04:30] brother branham is making a powerful
[2:04:31] point here
[2:04:33] bible school can't save you
[2:04:37] there's a lot of preachers preaching
[2:04:38] today because they got a certificate
[2:04:40] from a bible school
[2:04:42] with no real conversion
[2:04:44] with no real born-again experience
[2:04:46] so here's a boy that goes through that
[2:04:48] he comes home he's still smoking he's
[2:04:50] still lusting he's still carrying on
[2:04:53] somehow he gets through that he presses
[2:04:55] through he comes to a place of
[2:04:57] sanctification he's a preacher for
[2:04:59] crying out loud
[2:05:03] how can we tolerate such things but he
[2:05:06] gets to his sanctification he comes
[2:05:08] right up to the borderland again looks
[2:05:10] right over sees the baptism of the holy
[2:05:12] ghost but he said if i do the
[2:05:14] denomination will throw me out i've
[2:05:16] spent all this money on a bible school
[2:05:18] certificate from a particular
[2:05:20] denomination and if i go in and get the
[2:05:22] holy ghost they're going to throw me out
[2:05:25] and so what does he do he values that
[2:05:27] paper
[2:05:29] he values his license
[2:05:31] he values his ordination from man over
[2:05:34] his birthright
[2:05:36] he said go on back and die in the
[2:05:38] borderland then if you want to
[2:05:41] he that sin what is sin unbelief i want
[2:05:43] somebody to tell me a definition of sin
[2:05:45] besides unbelief he that believeth not
[2:05:48] is condemned already that's right you
[2:05:50] don't even get the first
[2:05:52] what if committing adultery is not a sin
[2:05:54] smoking cigarettes and drinking is not a
[2:05:56] sin that's the attributes of unbelief
[2:05:59] the first time i heard this it nearly
[2:06:01] blew my little holiness mind come on
[2:06:04] because i grew up in an environment
[2:06:06] where everything was sin and then i hear
[2:06:08] brother branham say this this in itself
[2:06:11] is not sin it's the attribute of sin the
[2:06:14] sin is unbelief there's an unbelief
[2:06:16] problem that causes you to keep looking
[2:06:18] to these other things there's a problem
[2:06:20] with unbelief that causes you to keep
[2:06:23] running here and running there these are
[2:06:25] the attributes of unbelief if you was a
[2:06:27] believer let's read that slow
[2:06:29] if you was a believer you wouldn't do
[2:06:32] that
[2:06:33] if you was a believer you wouldn't do
[2:06:35] that let's read that real slow if you
[2:06:37] was a believer you wouldn't do that
[2:06:43] so we got a believing problem
[2:06:46] we've got a sin
[2:06:47] problem
[2:06:49] we've got people running to this
[2:06:51] attribute and that attribute when the
[2:06:53] real problem is not that god has placed
[2:06:56] that on their life as some people would
[2:06:58] have you to believe
[2:06:59] the problem is they've never had a
[2:07:01] breakthrough they've never broken
[2:07:02] through into a new birth
[2:07:05] dave you know what the new birth is for
[2:07:08] it's to help you deal with the problem
[2:07:09] of unbelief
[2:07:11] you're born from another world you're
[2:07:13] born from above you're born from another
[2:07:16] dimension then
[2:07:18] and the things that attract you here in
[2:07:20] this old life they don't have the same
[2:07:22] attraction the problem church
[2:07:25] is not the spirit of addiction
[2:07:28] the problem is unbelief
[2:07:33] we've got to believe
[2:07:36] that he is a rewarder of those that
[2:07:37] diligently seek him we've got to believe
[2:07:40] that he who the son makes free is what
[2:07:44] we've got to believe that
[2:07:46] and we've got to quit disqualifying
[2:07:48] ourselves
[2:07:50] and we've got to say lord if you can
[2:07:52] deliver anybody you can deliver me
[2:07:56] if you can deliver anybody from
[2:07:58] pornography you can deliver me
[2:08:01] if you can deliver anybody from the
[2:08:03] spirit of lust lord you can deliver me
[2:08:07] if you can deliver anybody from the
[2:08:09] attributes of sin like alcoholism
[2:08:13] nicotine addiction
[2:08:15] you can deliver me if you can deliver
[2:08:17] anybody from food addiction
[2:08:19] you can deliver me
[2:08:24] if you was a believer
[2:08:26] you wouldn't do that somebody said that
[2:08:27] is so discouraging because here i am and
[2:08:30] i think i'm a believer and yet those
[2:08:32] things are still pulling me let me let
[2:08:34] me just encourage you to check up
[2:08:37] just do a checkup don't be condemned
[2:08:39] don't go out of here and say here i've
[2:08:41] been doing my best and i go to church
[2:08:42] they tell me i'm not even a believer
[2:08:44] listen a believer believes
[2:08:47] it's just that simple and if the enemy
[2:08:50] can cause you to not believe
[2:08:53] if he can cause you to miss
[2:08:55] believe
[2:08:57] then your misbelief will not only affect
[2:08:59] you
[2:09:00] but like those ten spies
[2:09:03] it will affect everybody around you it
[2:09:05] affected a whole generation of people it
[2:09:08] caused the whole people to fall like
[2:09:09] carcasses in the wilderness so that a
[2:09:11] new generation could rise up and take
[2:09:14] god i want you to know that there is
[2:09:16] going to be a people
[2:09:19] they're even positioning now
[2:09:24] positioning now
[2:09:26] to take this promise
[2:09:28] with everything that mark 16 promises
[2:09:31] they shall lay hands on the sick and the
[2:09:32] shadow cove they shall cast out devils
[2:09:34] in my name they shall speak with new
[2:09:37] tongues and if they drink any deadly
[2:09:38] poison it shall not harm them they shall
[2:09:41] take up serpents and not be harmed
[2:09:45] remember
[2:09:46] it's not just this
[2:09:48] it's is not the slithery kind but the
[2:09:51] two-legged kind can be slithery too
[2:09:55] come on
[2:09:57] remember the apostles said i fought
[2:09:59] those beasts at ephesus
[2:10:02] and yet the greek word helps us to
[2:10:04] understand he wasn't talking about lions
[2:10:06] and tigers and bears
[2:10:08] he wasn't fighting pooh's problems
[2:10:11] no no no not lions tigers and bears
[2:10:14] no no no he was fighting two-legged
[2:10:17] beasts
[2:10:18] the kind that stand upright the kind
[2:10:20] that opposed the real deliverance the
[2:10:22] kind that opposed the real baptism of
[2:10:25] the holy ghost the kind that opposed a
[2:10:27] real holy ghost meeting
[2:10:30] with slobbering and snotting and
[2:10:33] babbling and
[2:10:39] children
[2:10:41] under the glory under the power of god
[2:10:44] don't even know what they're doing
[2:10:47] if you can just get them to the place
[2:10:49] where they can yield themselves and the
[2:10:51] spirit of god begin to talk out of them
[2:10:53] in some way it may not sound like
[2:10:55] anybody else
[2:10:57] but i remember the old-timers used to
[2:10:59] say it's beautiful to god
[2:11:02] so i found myself speaking over these
[2:11:04] young people it may not sound like
[2:11:06] anybody else's witness but it's
[2:11:08] beautiful to god
[2:11:10] can you imagine what it does what kind
[2:11:13] of a ripple it sounds it sins through
[2:11:16] eternity when there are young people
[2:11:18] like around here tuesday night who pray
[2:11:20] all the way through an experience and i
[2:11:22] know that there are whole movements of
[2:11:24] people who believe that young people
[2:11:27] must go out and experience sin
[2:11:31] we have movements among the truth even
[2:11:34] that have this idea the only way to
[2:11:36] really appreciate salvation
[2:11:39] is to go out and live like the devil for
[2:11:40] a while
[2:11:42] and then you'll really know how to
[2:11:43] appreciate things when you come back to
[2:11:45] christ i tell you what i want you to
[2:11:47] know i have a god
[2:11:49] and i have enough confidence in that god
[2:11:51] to believe that he has power not only to
[2:11:53] redeem the one that has experienced that
[2:11:56] level of unbelief but i believe he has
[2:11:58] the power to keep those
[2:12:00] who put their trust in him why couldn't
[2:12:02] he hold on to a michaela why couldn't he
[2:12:04] hold on to his zachary why couldn't he
[2:12:06] hold on to a carter why couldn't he hold
[2:12:08] on to amaya why couldn't the holy ghost
[2:12:10] just hold on to them so that they never
[2:12:12] have to go out there and experience the
[2:12:14] real depths
[2:12:17] of the attributes of unbelief may they
[2:12:20] never have to have an addiction other
[2:12:22] than one to christ
[2:12:25] may they become addicted to the holy
[2:12:27] ghost
[2:12:28] may they refuse to live without that
[2:12:30] connection
[2:12:31] why can't it be that way that's what
[2:12:33] believers believe
[2:12:35] he said that was a believer you wouldn't
[2:12:36] do that see that's right that's exactly
[2:12:38] right see there's unbelief
[2:12:41] he said what is it
[2:12:43] if we disbelieve willfully
[2:12:47] you out here tonight
[2:12:49] presbyterian methodists are you without
[2:12:51] the holy ghost if we disbelieve
[2:12:54] willfully
[2:12:55] after we have received the knowledge of
[2:12:57] the truth for someone to say i believe
[2:13:00] the message of the hour
[2:13:02] and then to deny the necessity of a new
[2:13:05] birth and a holy ghost experience in
[2:13:07] this day somebody's on dangerous ground
[2:13:11] for you to preach that god restored the
[2:13:13] gifts through pentecost and then to
[2:13:16] preach that they are no more for this
[2:13:18] hour you're on dangerous ground you're
[2:13:21] on dangerous territory and for you to
[2:13:23] buy that idea you're on dangerous ground
[2:13:27] it's like saying the very scripture that
[2:13:29] the brother that the prophet is using
[2:13:31] here he said if we disbelieve willfully
[2:13:35] after we say we've received the
[2:13:36] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[2:13:38] no more sacrifice for sin you turn your
[2:13:40] back on god what do you do then
[2:13:43] can you imagine believing when you first
[2:13:45] heard this truth that it's going to take
[2:13:46] a holy ghost baptism
[2:13:48] and it's going to take total deliverance
[2:13:50] and then coming on 30 years later and
[2:13:52] coming to this idea well nobody can
[2:13:54] really seem to break through to that so
[2:13:56] it must not be the plan of god for today
[2:13:58] why don't you make up your mind i'm
[2:13:59] going to be the one that does
[2:14:01] i'm going to be the one that lives above
[2:14:03] lust i'm going to be the one that lives
[2:14:04] above addiction i'm going to be the one
[2:14:06] that lives above these things i'm going
[2:14:07] to be the one that keeps my mind focused
[2:14:09] on the things of god
[2:14:12] he said you turn your back on god what
[2:14:14] what do you
[2:14:16] do
[2:14:17] then
[2:14:18] seal yourself away
[2:14:21] you take the mark of the beast
[2:14:24] and you go off like cain did from the
[2:14:25] presence of god
[2:14:27] anybody hearing this
[2:14:31] he said that's shaking isn't it
[2:14:33] come right up to the borderline
[2:14:36] would you just read that with me come
[2:14:37] right up to the borderline
[2:14:39] come right up to the borderline
[2:14:42] and then don't believe it
[2:14:45] you believe it but you're scared to take
[2:14:48] it
[2:14:49] he that sins willfully disbelieves
[2:14:51] willfully after he's received the
[2:14:52] knowledge of the truth i'll tell you
[2:14:54] he's breaking this down
[2:14:55] he said regard quote that with me he
[2:14:57] that sins willfully after that he has
[2:14:59] received the knowledge of the truth
[2:15:00] there are made of no more sacrifice for
[2:15:02] sin but he said a fearful looking for
[2:15:04] the fiery judgment and i will repay
[2:15:06] saith the lord it's a fearful thing to
[2:15:08] fall into the hands of a living god he's
[2:15:11] pronouncing a judgment here
[2:15:13] long beach california he said after it's
[2:15:15] brought right
[2:15:16] up to you
[2:15:17] and showed you that it is the seal of
[2:15:19] god and just because of prestige you
[2:15:22] have to give up something or quit your
[2:15:24] denomination or something to receive it
[2:15:27] and then you walk away from it
[2:15:30] what a powerful message to deliver in a
[2:15:33] mixed congregation where people had come
[2:15:35] of all denominations to see the miracles
[2:15:39] and brother branham said to the people
[2:15:40] see god brought you here he shows you
[2:15:42] the demonstration of the holy ghost you
[2:15:44] walk all the way up to it
[2:15:47] and then refuse to step in because you
[2:15:50] know you would be pressed out of your
[2:15:51] church
[2:15:59] you remember the story of daisy osborne
[2:16:02] you remember how that they had gone she
[2:16:05] and tommy osborne had gone to india as
[2:16:08] missionaries for the assemblies of god
[2:16:11] and they basically had their heads
[2:16:13] handed to him on a silver platter
[2:16:14] because they had no power over the
[2:16:15] demons
[2:16:18] they had this vision and a zeal and a
[2:16:20] burden to go see the lost but they had
[2:16:23] no preparation because bible school had
[2:16:26] now prepared them to deal with the
[2:16:27] measure of witchcraft they were going to
[2:16:29] face in india in those days so they had
[2:16:32] very limited success they came back to
[2:16:34] the united states beat up and almost
[2:16:36] ready to throw in the towel
[2:16:39] and brother branham begins to rise up on
[2:16:41] the scene he's preaching in the west
[2:16:42] coast
[2:16:44] they mention it to brother tommy osborne
[2:16:46] he's not interested in going
[2:16:50] he knows he's washed up and almost
[2:16:52] defeated
[2:16:53] but he's not interested in going
[2:16:55] because he knows what'll happen to him
[2:16:58] if people see him there
[2:17:01] and daisy
[2:17:02] you know if you know anything about her
[2:17:03] she was a pretty feisty
[2:17:05] kind of like their daughter ladonna kind
[2:17:07] of a feisty sort of creature
[2:17:10] and she just found her a grandma
[2:17:13] she just found her a woman in her 80s
[2:17:16] who had already lived her life
[2:17:19] and got to a place she didn't care what
[2:17:21] the church thought about her
[2:17:24] they stood in the pulpits all across
[2:17:26] america and they said don't go to the
[2:17:27] brand of meetings
[2:17:29] because he's preaching a strange
[2:17:30] doctrine and strange things are taking
[2:17:32] place so we're we're we're
[2:17:34] encouraging our our members not to go
[2:17:37] and support the brand of meeting now
[2:17:38] this was kind of a strange thing because
[2:17:40] the assemblies of god churches were
[2:17:42] sponsoring the meeting
[2:17:45] so there was a few renegade pastors who
[2:17:47] said we're going to have a meeting
[2:17:48] regardless of what they say they can
[2:17:50] kick us out if they want to
[2:17:51] but most of the people were scared to go
[2:17:54] so so daisy she reached out and found
[2:17:56] her a granny in her 80s who said i'll go
[2:17:58] to those meetings with you and i don't
[2:18:00] care what they say about me it don't
[2:18:02] matter if they turn their back on me or
[2:18:03] throw me out of the church or whatever
[2:18:05] they want to do if god's down there
[2:18:07] moving in that hall i want to be right
[2:18:08] in the middle of it
[2:18:10] isn't that something
[2:18:12] here's one that said i don't want to
[2:18:13] come all the way up to the borderline
[2:18:16] i don't want to come all the way up to
[2:18:18] the borderline and refuse to cross
[2:18:21] and so they went and they saw the
[2:18:23] goodness of god
[2:18:24] they saw the miracles they saw the signs
[2:18:27] and wonders and they heard truth they'd
[2:18:29] never heard before and she goes home and
[2:18:31] tells tommy what's wrong with you her
[2:18:33] husband what's wrong with you
[2:18:35] are you really afraid of what they're
[2:18:36] going to do to us
[2:18:37] why don't you come and see for yourself
[2:18:39] so he went and hid behind the post
[2:18:43] he stood up in the balcony and hid
[2:18:44] behind the post he didn't want anybody
[2:18:46] to see him there
[2:18:49] and his testimony after that meeting was
[2:18:51] this for the second time in my life i
[2:18:53] saw jesus step into a man
[2:18:56] the first time was in a vision or a
[2:18:58] dream an experience that i had with the
[2:19:00] lord i saw a little man standing out
[2:19:02] there and i saw jesus step into that man
[2:19:04] and begin to minister like he did when
[2:19:06] he was on the shores of galilee when i
[2:19:08] got to the meeting that night i didn't
[2:19:09] want anybody to see me i didn't want
[2:19:11] them to know i was there but i could not
[2:19:13] help but the fact that here come a
[2:19:15] little man kind of kind of uh
[2:19:17] teetering out onto the platform and
[2:19:19] stood there just a very uh
[2:19:21] non-impressive sort of fella
[2:19:26] and in my mind i'm thinking this is the
[2:19:28] guy that i have reached my reputation to
[2:19:31] hear
[2:19:34] a mismatched suit
[2:19:38] an out-of-style tie
[2:19:42] and he comes to the microphone bowser's
[2:19:44] head over toward the mic like that like
[2:19:46] he thinks you have to be close to it for
[2:19:48] it to hear you
[2:19:49] he bow brother brandon bows over to the
[2:19:50] microphone like that he says good
[2:19:52] evening friends
[2:20:01] and tommy osborne said i'd never
[2:20:02] experienced jesus
[2:20:06] like i experienced him in that moment
[2:20:10] i realized that it wasn't that little
[2:20:11] humble man
[2:20:12] it wasn't that little non-assuming man
[2:20:14] that was going to get the job done it
[2:20:16] was the jesus that stepped into him that
[2:20:18] was going to get the job done don't you
[2:20:20] love to hear a story like that
[2:20:22] let me tell you something folks here's
[2:20:24] where people miss this
[2:20:26] they say well that was brother branham
[2:20:28] it was
[2:20:35] what of you what of me
[2:20:36] what of us
[2:20:39] that man that jesus stepped into on that
[2:20:41] platform that radically changed tommy
[2:20:43] osborne's ministry
[2:20:45] he said from that moment from that
[2:20:47] moment on i was never the same
[2:20:50] because i now knew that what jesus did
[2:20:53] in that little man
[2:20:55] he could do in me
[2:20:59] i've been in message churches where they
[2:21:01] told that story because they heard it
[2:21:02] from me or from my friend
[2:21:04] and i've been in message churches where
[2:21:06] they repeated that story and they love
[2:21:08] to hear that story they love to tell
[2:21:09] that story
[2:21:10] and then they say
[2:21:12] they run their disclaimer and they say
[2:21:14] imagine that
[2:21:17] imagine tommy osborne thinking that
[2:21:19] jesus would step into him
[2:21:23] let me tell you something
[2:21:25] that's the goal of the new testament
[2:21:27] church
[2:21:28] isn't that why we get people to the holy
[2:21:30] ghost so jesus can step into them
[2:21:33] isn't this the jesus life that we're
[2:21:35] supposed to be living right now
[2:21:37] that doesn't give you a a prophesied
[2:21:40] ministry
[2:21:41] that doesn't say you're one of a million
[2:21:43] it doesn't say that you're a messenger
[2:21:45] to an age but what it says is these same
[2:21:49] works shall you do and greater
[2:21:54] [Applause]
[2:21:55] jesus said to those who would listen
[2:21:57] don't be satisfied doing what you see me
[2:22:01] do
[2:22:03] you can do this and you can do greater
[2:22:07] because i go to my father
[2:22:11] and that's why i can witness to seeing
[2:22:13] things and knowing of things that
[2:22:15] happened in brother ham's ministry that
[2:22:16] didn't even happen in the earthly
[2:22:18] ministry of jesus christ
[2:22:23] and that's why i can believe that
[2:22:24] there's going to be a bride a
[2:22:26] many-membered bride that's not just made
[2:22:29] up of preachers
[2:22:31] it's not just made up of fifa ministry
[2:22:34] and it's not an all-male show
[2:22:36] no
[2:22:37] amen
[2:22:39] but a body show a body ministry a
[2:22:41] demonstration of body ministry where
[2:22:43] jesus is stepping into them and they
[2:22:46] just open their mouth and he speaks
[2:22:49] and they just extend their hand and he
[2:22:51] reaches
[2:22:53] and they just yield their feet and ewoks
[2:22:56] you see even our lord said i can do
[2:22:58] nothing
[2:23:00] except i see my father doing it
[2:23:02] brother branham was in the same ministry
[2:23:04] i can do nothing except he i'm waiting
[2:23:07] on something you know i'm waiting on
[2:23:08] some there he is
[2:23:12] brother branham showing us just what it
[2:23:13] would have been like to have sat there
[2:23:15] in the ministry of jesus christ he said
[2:23:17] i can do it unless i see envision my
[2:23:19] father doing it
[2:23:21] and brother brown the same day you know
[2:23:22] i'm waiting on something
[2:23:24] how many of you have ever heard it on
[2:23:25] tape you know i'm waiting on something
[2:23:27] he said you know i'm waiting on
[2:23:29] something you know i'm just trying to
[2:23:30] i'm just trying to talk a little bit
[2:23:32] here and i'm just waiting on something
[2:23:36] when he comes when when he comes
[2:23:38] i'm just waiting on something i'm just
[2:23:40] going to tell you a little story or
[2:23:41] something here waiting on him there he
[2:23:43] is
[2:23:46] and then he began to open his mouth
[2:23:48] and god was able then to discern the
[2:23:50] needs of the people
[2:23:52] and minister accordingly
[2:23:56] i believe it was hawk told me today
[2:23:58] because we know of a great need
[2:24:00] in a body in a physical body of someone
[2:24:03] in our church a great physical need a
[2:24:05] real miracle needed that only god can
[2:24:07] provide
[2:24:09] and you see how how dire it looks and
[2:24:11] how how negative it looks in the natural
[2:24:14] how serious it looks in the natural but
[2:24:16] i think he said he was listening to one
[2:24:17] of the sermons on melchizedek and at the
[2:24:20] end of that service brother branham says
[2:24:22] something about
[2:24:23] hawk what was that
[2:24:28] a lady laying there on a cot at the end
[2:24:29] of the meeting
[2:24:52] is he the same
[2:24:54] then why would we settle for being
[2:24:56] borderline believers living in a
[2:24:57] borderland
[2:24:58] when the whole promise of god is waiting
[2:25:00] on us just who dare to believe just
[2:25:02] somebody dare to believe that's all
[2:25:04] god's waiting on this hour is somebody
[2:25:06] who'll dare to believe
[2:25:08] brought right up to you and showed you
[2:25:09] that it's the seal of god just because
[2:25:11] of prestige you'd have to give up
[2:25:13] something or quit your denomination or
[2:25:15] something to receive then walk away from
[2:25:17] it you know what you do you seal
[2:25:19] yourself out of the kingdom
[2:25:23] brother man i wasn't looking for some
[2:25:25] tattoo
[2:25:27] he said this is the mark of the beast
[2:25:33] selling your soul for some compromised
[2:25:36] denomination
[2:25:40] where did the book of revelation say the
[2:25:42] seal would be
[2:25:44] the mark would be
[2:25:46] on the forehead and on the right hand
[2:25:49] right
[2:25:50] the forehead representing the intellect
[2:25:53] it's a sealing away that takes place
[2:25:55] because of the intellect of man and that
[2:25:58] glorious you know right hand to
[2:26:00] fellowship
[2:26:02] people joining into a system that is so
[2:26:04] far removed from the whole counsel of
[2:26:07] god's word that it's just a bear bare
[2:26:10] imitation of what god really desires to
[2:26:12] do in people's lives and yet they're
[2:26:14] selling out for that on and on and on
[2:26:16] and ago is there more
[2:26:18] when god told abel or cocaine said just
[2:26:21] go over and worship like your brother
[2:26:30] this is more than we read
[2:26:32] he said just go over and worship like
[2:26:34] your brother bring a lamb
[2:26:36] come down here and worship like your
[2:26:37] brother
[2:26:40] said you'll do all right do as your
[2:26:41] brother does you'll be all right now
[2:26:43] this really
[2:26:46] this really slaps this doctrine that i
[2:26:49] hear preach sometime
[2:26:50] that god rejected cain's offering
[2:26:52] because
[2:26:54] of his origin
[2:27:00] that he could not have brought a proper
[2:27:02] sacrifice because he was of the wrong
[2:27:03] seed
[2:27:04] but that's not what the prophet is
[2:27:06] saying here
[2:27:07] he's saying god gave him an opportunity
[2:27:09] if you'll just go bring the right
[2:27:10] offering god will hear your prayer just
[2:27:12] like you or anybody else that's pretty
[2:27:13] powerful isn't it
[2:27:15] don't get mad i'm just reading
[2:27:17] he said bring a lamb come down here and
[2:27:18] worship like your brother said you'll do
[2:27:20] all right do as your brother does you'd
[2:27:22] be all right
[2:27:23] but he wouldn't do it said this is the
[2:27:25] best i can offer
[2:27:27] and listen to this attitude this is what
[2:27:29] proved who he was
[2:27:30] he said you can take it or leave it this
[2:27:32] is this is the best i've got
[2:27:34] and he was marked and went out of the
[2:27:35] presence of god
[2:27:39] because he wasn't willing to offer the
[2:27:41] right kind of worship
[2:27:45] and he went out sealed
[2:27:47] from the presence of god
[2:27:50] i want to go to why real quick i i i
[2:27:53] i would like to finish a little earlier
[2:27:55] because we've had such a hard time
[2:27:57] getting where we are
[2:27:58] i don't want to belabor
[2:28:00] but i'd like to go to this message why
[2:28:03] paragraph 29 if you'll stay with me and
[2:28:05] you're with me now so thank you he said
[2:28:07] reminds me like like in someone asked me
[2:28:09] the question or not hebrews 10 where
[2:28:11] they who willfully have sin willfully
[2:28:13] and have to renew themselves unto
[2:28:14] repentance why there's nothing left for
[2:28:16] them but the fearful looking for the
[2:28:18] judgment he that despised moses law died
[2:28:21] under two or three witnesses how much
[2:28:22] sorer punishment supposed thou worthy
[2:28:25] who has trod the blood of jesus christ
[2:28:27] under their feet and counted it an
[2:28:29] unholy thing done despite to the works
[2:28:32] of grace
[2:28:34] i said you you read over in deuteronomy
[2:28:36] 14 and
[2:28:38] and forgive me for saying but if you
[2:28:40] read deuteronomy 14 you'll find nothing
[2:28:42] there about the spies it's numbers 14
[2:28:44] where we just read
[2:28:46] he said you read over in numbers 14
[2:28:49] where those spies israelites went with
[2:28:51] caleb and joshua right up to the
[2:28:53] borderland
[2:28:56] they tasted the grapes
[2:28:59] that came from the land
[2:29:01] but when they went back
[2:29:06] they were unbelieving
[2:29:09] and cowards
[2:29:17] we brought a mighty preacher here one
[2:29:19] time
[2:29:20] years ago
[2:29:22] a mighty preacher
[2:29:24] one who shook me with his messages
[2:29:31] it was the first year i think
[2:29:36] of our camp meeting
[2:29:40] and the preachers that
[2:29:43] were invited to speak wouldn't speak
[2:29:47] couldn't get him to
[2:29:48] speak this being one of them we brought
[2:29:51] him from another continent
[2:29:54] in the few days that he was here
[2:29:56] he saw things
[2:29:58] and he felt things
[2:30:00] and he didn't know what to do about him
[2:30:06] he even rose up in a
[2:30:08] there was a
[2:30:09] another brother
[2:30:11] who wasn't invited as a speaker he's
[2:30:13] passed away now
[2:30:15] he wasn't invited as a speaker but i
[2:30:16] gave him a morning service
[2:30:20] and he began to preach what was on his
[2:30:22] heart and this great speaker mighty man
[2:30:25] very well known
[2:30:26] even today
[2:30:29] this man rose up in the middle of his
[2:30:30] sermon and he began to have almost like
[2:30:33] a fit this great speaker he began to
[2:30:35] kind of have some fit or something
[2:30:38] and he was resisting and arguing with
[2:30:41] what the preacher was saying and
[2:30:45] somehow or another
[2:30:47] he ended up in the altar
[2:30:50] and how god met him
[2:30:55] anybody remember hold up your hand if
[2:30:56] you remember two
[2:30:58] two people three people remember
[2:31:01] three of the ones that's here
[2:31:04] he got down in that sawdust and rooted
[2:31:06] like a pig
[2:31:08] i'm not making fun i've done the same
[2:31:11] he got down in the sawdust and he made a
[2:31:13] trench with his nose
[2:31:15] as god was stripping the pride off of
[2:31:17] his life
[2:31:19] and what he came to resist got a hold of
[2:31:21] him
[2:31:23] and he gave his testimony and preached
[2:31:24] for us
[2:31:26] and this was his words i came here an
[2:31:29] experienced minister of the gospel
[2:31:32] preached in other nations of the world
[2:31:34] and i thought i had everything i needed
[2:31:36] but i began to recognize after i got
[2:31:39] here
[2:31:40] that i needed a birth
[2:31:43] is that what he said
[2:31:45] he's coming to preach to us because i'd
[2:31:47] heard him preach one of the most
[2:31:48] outstanding messages i've ever heard my
[2:31:50] life never never heard a greater message
[2:31:53] and he dealt with every false doctrine
[2:31:55] you can imagine in that message so i
[2:31:57] wanted to be identified with that kind
[2:31:59] of of a rebel
[2:32:01] who could preach like that and stir the
[2:32:03] devils up like that he said but as i got
[2:32:05] here i realized i have i need a new
[2:32:07] birth i had to have a new birth he said
[2:32:10] i want somebody to get me a jar
[2:32:13] he said because i want to take a jar of
[2:32:16] this sawdust home with me he pastored a
[2:32:18] church of several thousand people at
[2:32:20] that time
[2:32:22] he said i want to take a jar of this
[2:32:24] sawdust home with me because i want to
[2:32:27] show everybody where i met the pillar of
[2:32:29] fire
[2:32:30] and where i received a new birth am i
[2:32:32] telling the truth you that were here
[2:32:34] hold up your hand if that's similar to
[2:32:35] what was it
[2:32:38] and i expected
[2:32:40] that the world was about to be set on
[2:32:42] fire
[2:32:43] by that brother
[2:32:46] i said he'll he'll go home surely and
[2:32:49] he'll testify to his church and his
[2:32:51] church will be turned upside down and
[2:32:53] those people will cry out for the new
[2:32:55] birth it'll shake the continent of
[2:32:57] africa and i knew he already had a
[2:33:00] ministry in in europe and i said it'll
[2:33:02] probably turn europe upside down
[2:33:09] came all the way up to the borderland
[2:33:11] and even got a taste
[2:33:14] of the grapes
[2:33:18] and i don't know if it was on the plane
[2:33:19] home
[2:33:20] or after he got home but somewhere along
[2:33:22] the way he realized
[2:33:24] this will cost me
[2:33:30] i'll never be invited to preach the
[2:33:32] edmonton convention anymore
[2:33:34] i'll never be invited to preach such and
[2:33:36] such a convention anymore i'll never be
[2:33:39] invited to go over here anymore come on
[2:33:41] because this will cost me this requires
[2:33:44] a price a heavy price
[2:33:46] you know here i am thinking this is
[2:33:48] going to turn the whole thing around
[2:33:50] but in his mind it's going to shut it
[2:33:52] all down
[2:33:54] sometimes god wants to shut it down
[2:33:57] so that he can raise up just like he
[2:33:59] told moses
[2:34:01] he said just let him die if you'll just
[2:34:03] let him die i'll raise up a mightier
[2:34:06] people than they amen
[2:34:08] you'll just let me shut it down i will
[2:34:10] but somehow along the way that brother
[2:34:12] was not willing
[2:34:16] he wasn't willing to be associated with
[2:34:19] that sawdust
[2:34:22] and instead of going to the pulpit like
[2:34:24] he said it would it must have found its
[2:34:27] place in the bottom of a drawer
[2:34:29] somewhere
[2:34:32] and about four five six years later
[2:34:35] someone sent me a tape and i heard him
[2:34:36] given his testimony
[2:34:38] and his experience
[2:34:40] the experience that he described here on
[2:34:42] this campground
[2:34:44] nothing could be any farther from the
[2:34:46] truth than what happened
[2:34:50] are you saying he told us yes
[2:34:53] his testimony was a lie
[2:34:56] it was nothing like happened here
[2:34:59] when i was reading this quote i couldn't
[2:35:01] help i hadn't thought of that situation
[2:35:03] in years but my mind went back
[2:35:06] to that very situation
[2:35:09] it's a very very dangerous thing to come
[2:35:11] all the way up to the border land and
[2:35:13] taste the grapes that come from the land
[2:35:15] but they went back they were unbelieving
[2:35:17] and
[2:35:18] cowards
[2:35:20] he said oh we can't take it it's too
[2:35:22] much for us
[2:35:25] oh they they they we look like
[2:35:27] grasshoppers up beside of them
[2:35:31] the cities are all walled in how many of
[2:35:33] you know god showed him a little bit
[2:35:34] later he knew how to take care of wall
[2:35:36] cities
[2:35:39] they saw those intimidating walls and
[2:35:42] they said we cannot take it but caleb
[2:35:44] steal them and joshua said we can take
[2:35:47] it we're more than able
[2:35:51] yet we being the minority
[2:35:54] but we can
[2:35:56] take it
[2:35:58] why
[2:36:00] those spies was looking at conditions
[2:36:03] what the price they'd have to pay but
[2:36:05] caleb and joshua was looking at a
[2:36:07] promise of god
[2:36:09] are you still still with me
[2:36:11] god said i've given you that land
[2:36:14] go possess it
[2:36:17] glory
[2:36:18] the holy ghost is for whosoever is
[2:36:21] called to this wedding supper
[2:36:24] i don't care what price you have to pay
[2:36:26] go get it
[2:36:27] god said it's yours if you don't get it
[2:36:30] he's gonna ask you why didn't you get it
[2:36:34] why
[2:36:36] it was there for you
[2:36:40] if they didn't possess the land why
[2:36:44] there was too many against us he said
[2:36:46] well if god said if i'm for you who
[2:36:49] could be against you it's there
[2:36:52] what's the matter there's something
[2:36:53] wrong with the individual now watch he
[2:36:56] said many
[2:36:58] you you take a young minister
[2:37:00] feels the call of god in his heart he
[2:37:03] will repent of his sins go off to school
[2:37:06] get his education which is fine
[2:37:10] he'll come back smoke cigarettes maybe
[2:37:12] still got a lustful spirit to say well i
[2:37:14] don't want that lord take it away from
[2:37:15] me
[2:37:16] the spirit of god will come and sanctify
[2:37:18] his soul and take that desire away from
[2:37:21] him then he will be brought right up to
[2:37:22] the borderland
[2:37:24] set right in the meetings and watch the
[2:37:25] workings of the holy spirit see others
[2:37:27] get healed hear them speak with tongues
[2:37:30] see wonder signs and wonders done
[2:37:32] they'll sit around and watch it
[2:37:34] but afraid to put their hand on it
[2:37:36] that's that borderline believer that's
[2:37:39] that fellow
[2:37:40] if ever turns away
[2:37:44] if he ever turns away
[2:37:46] there's no more remission for him
[2:37:49] stand right up here and even look over
[2:37:52] into the land who's received the
[2:37:54] knowledge of the truth out of knowledge
[2:37:55] of the truth know that that was right
[2:37:57] but because of prestige
[2:38:02] well if i do this it'll do this and if i
[2:38:05] accept that it'll do this
[2:38:07] see
[2:38:08] they refuse it they walk away from it
[2:38:10] oh listen if you're watching this and
[2:38:14] you're somewhere around the world other
[2:38:15] than right in the middle of this service
[2:38:17] here in alabama i want to beg you i
[2:38:19] i could care less about my reputation or
[2:38:22] my prestige i don't really have any left
[2:38:25] but i would implore you i would strongly
[2:38:29] encourage you not to live another day as
[2:38:32] a borderline believer
[2:38:34] the holy ghost baptism is real the
[2:38:37] genuine new birth is real the
[2:38:40] supernatural god is real
[2:38:44] i encourage you not to worry about what
[2:38:46] others would say but go after it with
[2:38:49] everything you've got
[2:38:50] [Applause]
[2:38:53] what if i speak in tongues so be it
[2:38:57] what if i mess up my hair so be it
[2:39:00] what if i slobber and snot so be it
[2:39:05] what if i lose my place in the church so
[2:39:08] be it
[2:39:10] what if my own family won't talk to me
[2:39:13] so be it
[2:39:15] there comes a time when we must make the
[2:39:18] decision
[2:39:19] to take god at his word
[2:39:22] and refuse to live in the border land
[2:39:27] go after it with everything you've got
[2:39:31] he said and count the blood of the
[2:39:32] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[2:39:34] that far to bring him up on a step to
[2:39:37] look over into and have a knowledge of
[2:39:39] it
[2:39:45] he was saved
[2:39:48] and sanctified
[2:39:50] but comes up here to look over to
[2:39:52] receive the holy ghost that new birth
[2:39:55] he wants nothing to do with listen the
[2:39:56] new birth is not completed without the
[2:39:59] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:40:02] you must have the genuine baptism of the
[2:40:06] holy ghost
[2:40:08] and someone makes this comment because
[2:40:10] the prophet talks about
[2:40:12] the seal of god and he talks about
[2:40:15] the last feeling
[2:40:17] being without sensation
[2:40:20] and i want you to understand
[2:40:23] that you have to take god at his word
[2:40:26] whether you feel anything or not

[2:43:46] transgression he was bruised for my
[2:43:47] iniquity the chastisement of my peace

[2:43:57] he said it's your choice now we're at
[2:44:00] the borderland
[2:44:02] we've come through many dangerous toils
[2:44:05] and snares i've already come it was
[2:44:08] grace that brought me safe thus far
[2:44:10] following the blessed old bible it's
[2:44:12] grace
[2:44:14] that'll take me on amen
[2:44:17] the promise
[2:44:19] we're on the borderland tonight
[2:44:22] the bible said i would above all things
[2:44:24] you prosper in health it's yours god
[2:44:27] promised it the promise to you is just
[2:44:29] as good as it was to israel
[2:44:33] he said i've given you that land i will
[2:44:35] send my angel
[2:44:37] this pillar of fire before you to guide
[2:44:39] you to the place divine healing's yours
[2:44:42] god promised it to you
[2:44:45] i just felt the spirit of the lord
[2:44:47] speaking to my heart
[2:44:49] somebody who's streaming this service
[2:44:51] right now there are things coming into
[2:44:53] your mind
[2:44:54] pictures and reminders are coming into
[2:44:57] your mind of things in your life that
[2:44:59] would have to change
[2:45:02] and i want to ask you right now to get
[2:45:04] your mind off of what may have to be
[2:45:06] laid aside or what price you might have
[2:45:09] to pay and understand that it's worth
[2:45:13] every
[2:45:14] every sacrifice
[2:45:17] it's worth losing everything else
[2:45:21] to win christ
[2:45:23] to know that you have been born again
[2:45:27] must be a backslider
[2:45:29] that god was calling to right then and
[2:45:32] some of you look at your favorite
[2:45:34] holidays and you look at your jewels and
[2:45:37] you look at the things you love your
[2:45:39] your fake eyelashes and all the things
[2:45:41] you've come to love
[2:45:44] and you wonder how could i ever get
[2:45:45] along without those things
[2:45:48] oh
[2:45:49] i want you to know once you've really
[2:45:51] tasted of this good promise once you
[2:45:54] listen once you've come under the
[2:45:56] influence and inspiration of the genuine
[2:45:59] holy ghost nothing out there
[2:46:02] nothing out there compares
[2:46:04] to the peace and the assurance
[2:46:07] if we could capture that moment for
[2:46:09] these young people
[2:46:10] that received the holy ghost here
[2:46:12] tuesday night if we could capture that
[2:46:13] moment
[2:46:15] and cause them somehow to live in that
[2:46:16] moment
[2:46:18] they would never want the things of this
[2:46:20] world
[2:46:21] they would never want the pleasures of
[2:46:22] this life they would never want to yield
[2:46:25] themselves to the lust
[2:46:27] and to the compromise of this world
[2:46:29] again get your eyes off of what you
[2:46:31] might lose
[2:46:32] and get your eyes on what you can gain
[2:46:35] through a real experience with jesus
[2:46:37] christ
[2:46:38] divine healing's yours god promised it

[3:13:14] somewhere during the preaching

[3:13:19] because of the words of the song that
[3:13:20] they sung this morning that we ought to
[3:13:22] have them sing again
[3:13:24] and worship the lord around the altar as
[3:13:26] they sing but sometimes you you you get
[3:13:30] to thinking in the carnal
[3:13:32] and i didn't want anybody to think i was
[3:13:34] putting that them
[3:13:36] ahead of anybody else or
[3:13:39] just trying to promote them and i i just
[3:13:42] let it slip my mind again brother
[3:13:44] daniel had a word of confirmation by
[3:13:47] just suggesting that
[3:13:49] maybe those were not maybe we've had
[3:13:51] some join us later on in the
[3:13:53] service and haven't didn't get to hear

[3:14:02] sing them and we can sing it with them

[3:40:39] [Music]
[3:40:58] lord of
[3:41:01] hallelujah
[3:41:06] [Music]
[3:41:22] i just want to say something
[3:41:24] as we close
[3:41:26] i just want to say this to you you can
[3:41:27] just play soft if you will
[3:41:30] my
[3:41:31] vehicle was in the shop
[3:41:34] and i don't know if you experienced this
[3:41:35] or not
[3:41:37] but
[3:41:39] uh i always
[3:41:41] like to have a newer vehicle because i
[3:41:43] don't know anything about mechanics
[3:41:46] and i don't know how to fix anything
[3:41:48] take care of anything
[3:41:50] but it seems like if anything ever
[3:41:52] gets wrong with mine or arrive with mine
[3:41:55] it's it's not under warranty anybody
[3:41:58] ever experienced that
[3:42:00] i don't know why i'm so blessed that
[3:42:01] every everything i need help with
[3:42:04] and i did god knows my heart i did raise
[3:42:07] my voice
[3:42:08] but i wasn't i wasn't angry enough to
[3:42:11] punch anybody but i did raise my voice
[3:42:15] and i said now let me tell you
[3:42:17] when i drove off the lot that problem
[3:42:19] was there and it's not fixed and and it
[3:42:21] is under warranty he said no sir it's
[3:42:24] not i said well we're going to run this
[3:42:26] up the ladder until we find somebody
[3:42:27] that says it is
[3:42:30] now
[3:42:32] i do have i do have a problem that's
[3:42:34] under warranty it's my transmission
[3:42:36] and it does crazy things
[3:42:39] and they put it on the machine
[3:42:41] and it told them what what was wrong
[3:42:43] with each part of the transmission
[3:42:46] but he said mr shelley
[3:42:48] we can't do that we can't fix that right
[3:42:51] now because he said the factory has
[3:42:53] ordered another fix
[3:42:55] that has to be done first
[3:42:58] and we've got to fix this first
[3:43:00] and then we can fix the problem that
[3:43:02] you've complained about that you've
[3:43:04] mentioned and noticed but he said if we
[3:43:07] fix this if we address your complaint
[3:43:10] and we don't do this other first
[3:43:13] he said we will have much more serious
[3:43:15] problems than we have right now
[3:43:17] now i hadn't thought of that
[3:43:19] he said it i listened
[3:43:21] i probably couldn't get past my
[3:43:23] aggravation for
[3:43:24] for for my
[3:43:26] sunroof being out of warranty and a leak
[3:43:28] and all that so i as i was standing
[3:43:31] there praying for sister hope my mind
[3:43:33] went back and it came to me again when i
[3:43:35] was praying for brother shane there
[3:43:37] there's an order sometime to to to
[3:43:40] deliverance to victory to to to walking
[3:43:43] in freedom there's a layer to it just
[3:43:45] like fixing my transmission he said now
[3:43:48] mr shelley if in 200 miles
[3:43:51] you don't see a difference he said i
[3:43:53] know right now what we're gonna do next
[3:43:56] and he began to outline the problem and
[3:43:58] he said if that doesn't fix it you're
[3:44:00] under warranty to 101 000 miles on this
[3:44:04] transmission
[3:44:05] and he said if that don't fix it we'll
[3:44:07] put a new we'll have to put a new
[3:44:08] transmission in there so not only does
[3:44:11] have have we followed the order he had
[3:44:13] to do the factory fix first then he
[3:44:16] addressed the problem and he thinks this
[3:44:19] is going to fix it but if that don't fix
[3:44:20] the problem they already know what
[3:44:22] they're going to do next and as i was
[3:44:24] standing there praying for sister hope i
[3:44:26] just felt like i should say now that
[3:44:29] there are times i believe in total and
[3:44:32] complete help from the lord but there
[3:44:34] are times that he has to address maybe
[3:44:37] not even the thing you've come up here
[3:44:39] for maybe you've come with one need and
[3:44:41] you want the lord to minister to that
[3:44:43] but he sees you and he sees something
[3:44:46] that needs to be lined up first so he
[3:44:48] starts taking care of that so that he
[3:44:51] can then come and do what you're asking
[3:44:52] him for does that make sense to anybody
[3:44:55] there's an order to this thing so when
[3:44:58] you stand in the presence of the lord to
[3:45:00] worship you don't have to tell him what
[3:45:02] order to do things in you just tell him
[3:45:04] what you need and be ready for him to do
[3:45:06] what you need
[3:45:08] you be ready for him to do first what he
[3:45:11] sees needs to be done first
[3:45:14] and then he'll take care of the next
[3:45:16] there's an order in the spirit life
[3:45:18] there's an order of things and he wants
[3:45:21] to take care of one thing sometime
[3:45:23] before
[3:45:24] another level is addressed and when i
[3:45:26] was praying for her the lord was was
[3:45:28] saying to me on a level and another
[3:45:31] level and another level how many of you
[3:45:33] want god to address every level of your
[3:45:35] need
[3:45:36] you want him to go right down and and
[3:45:38] touch one thing and and raise you up and
[3:45:41] touch another thing and raise you up and
[3:45:43] touch another thing and raise you up so
[3:45:45] if you're standing here you don't feel
[3:45:47] like what you came for has been
[3:45:49] addressed that's all right
[3:45:52] you just take what the lord will do
[3:45:54] you just accept what the lord has done
[3:45:57] and you believe him to finish the rest
[3:46:00] would you just raise up both hands
[3:46:03] let me just speak to you as you've got
[3:46:05] your hands lifted up father here we
[3:46:07] stand in the presence of the lord here
[3:46:10] we stand in your holy presence
[3:46:13] and there are many things we want it all
[3:46:17] and we want it all now
[3:46:20] in fact we want it all yesterday
[3:46:22] but we submit right now to the
[3:46:25] leadership of the holy spirit we submit
[3:46:28] to your wisdom
[3:46:30] and we submit to your timing
[3:46:32] because you are god's sovereign and you
[3:46:35] are god's supreme and right now in one
[3:46:37] mind in one accord we thank you for what
[3:46:39] you have done
[3:46:41] would you thank him for what he has done
[3:46:44] we thank you for what you have done
[3:46:47] and we thank you for what you're doing
[3:46:48] next and what you're doing next and what
[3:46:52] you're doing next because you're
[3:46:54] building up a house
[3:46:56] that you can dwell in
[3:46:57] you're building up a home
[3:47:00] that you can dwell in
[3:47:01] and we give you praise and we give you
[3:47:03] honor and we give you glory
[3:47:05] and we pray right now for those who
[3:47:08] couldn't be here today
[3:47:10] we pray for those who were sick
[3:47:12] who had a positive test
[3:47:15] and we pray for those who had symptoms
[3:47:18] and they didn't want to spread anything
[3:47:21] we pray for them right now and we ask
[3:47:23] you lord to deal with their bodies
[3:47:27] and to curse those nasty symptoms
[3:47:30] and let them have perfect wholeness and
[3:47:33] healing
[3:47:34] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:47:36] hallelujah one more thing i wanted to do
[3:47:39] before we go
[3:47:41] i want you to know god has been good to
[3:47:43] us
[3:47:44] and since march of
[3:47:46] of last year
[3:47:48] we've paid over half
[3:47:50] of the debt that we have carried
[3:47:53] on this property
[3:47:54] and some of you know that we had some
[3:47:57] compounds and some complications along
[3:48:00] the way
[3:48:01] and you might also know that we
[3:48:04] we took in that property up there
[3:48:07] that brother west had bought for the
[3:48:09] church and we were making payments on
[3:48:10] that
[3:48:11] and his brother wes began to get a
[3:48:13] little bit older
[3:48:14] he wanted
[3:48:16] wanted his name not to have to be put he
[3:48:18] brother shelly what's going to happen if
[3:48:20] something happens to me
[3:48:22] and my name is on everything so he
[3:48:24] wanted us to begin to shift things out
[3:48:26] of his name
[3:48:28] and i went to the bank and they when it
[3:48:30] was time to redo this loan the last time
[3:48:33] they took in that property that mobile
[3:48:35] home that hawk and maribeth live in and
[3:48:37] the acreage there
[3:48:39] so that it's all a part of the same
[3:48:40] property and so god has been mighty good
[3:48:43] to us
[3:48:45] and he has really helped us
[3:48:47] and i have a bill here
[3:48:49] that's due
[3:48:50] on on
[3:48:51] august the 22nd
[3:48:53] of when the loan comes to maturity and
[3:48:56] if you don't think that'll just shock
[3:48:57] you i'm used to looking at 3 900 due
[3:49:00] every month the payment
[3:49:02] is 3 900
[3:49:04] and today when i open up my bill the
[3:49:06] whole loan is due this month right have
[3:49:08] you ever got one like that cost the bill
[3:49:11] because the loan is run out it's a
[3:49:13] commercial loan it's only for a certain
[3:49:15] amount of time and it runs out and so i
[3:49:18] have a bill here in in the church's name
[3:49:21] but i happen to know brother stephen
[3:49:23] shelly and brother wesley greeley are
[3:49:25] the guarantors on this bill so brother
[3:49:27] greeley and i have a bill we have your
[3:49:30] bill
[3:49:31] in our name
[3:49:33] this due on the 22nd i just want to read
[3:49:35] this out like hezekiah i just want to
[3:49:38] stretch this before the lord because
[3:49:40] it's not too late
[3:49:42] it's not too late
[3:49:43] and my bill says that on the 22nd of
[3:49:46] august
[3:49:47] we are due to give the bank 239 thousand
[3:49:51] three hundred and eighty five dollars
[3:49:52] and sixty one cent
[3:49:54] but but january
[3:49:56] of 2021 it was almost a half a million
[3:49:59] dollars
[3:50:00] now that's the goodness of god
[3:50:02] that's the goodness of god so they're
[3:50:04] going to give us an extension
[3:50:06] and they're going to get we're going to
[3:50:08] settle the paperwork with them and
[3:50:09] they're going to give us a loan
[3:50:11] here's what bothers me
[3:50:14] we're going to pay a loan origination
[3:50:16] fee
[3:50:16] and we're going to pay all the other
[3:50:18] fees that go along because it'd be like
[3:50:20] a brand new loan
[3:50:21] and that means they get all their money
[3:50:23] again that's one of the ways they manage
[3:50:26] to to get us on commercial property
[3:50:29] so that means that today we owe 239
[3:50:32] thousand three eighty five sixty one
[3:50:34] before this is over to be another
[3:50:36] somewhere between three thousand and
[3:50:38] five thousand added to that god knows
[3:50:40] that i don't wanna give him that
[3:50:43] i don't wanna give it to him
[3:50:45] i'm gonna just spread this out and i'm
[3:50:48] god has a plan and it may be another
[3:50:50] three-year loan it's all right if that's
[3:50:52] his plan i'm ready but i just want you
[3:50:54] to be aware because this will shock you
[3:50:57] i forgot
[3:50:58] i forgot i've been on the phone with the
[3:51:00] bank this week so i'll open this bill
[3:51:02] and it says do
[3:51:05] pay this amount
[3:51:07] 239 thousand 300 because of how hard
[3:51:10] covet hit him and they and he said this
[3:51:12] to me pastor shelley in the midst of all
[3:51:14] that in the midst of people closing down
[3:51:18] churches
[3:51:19] and us having this resell commercial
[3:51:21] property from churches it couldn't
[3:51:23] afford to keep it you all have paid over
[3:51:26] half of your balance
[3:51:28] he said god something's going on
[3:51:30] somebody's looking out he didn't say god
[3:51:32] but he believes he said somebody
[3:51:34] upstairs is looking out for you all
[3:51:37] somebody's helping you and i just wanted
[3:51:39] to tell you that and i want you to raise
[3:51:40] your hand toward this and i want you to
[3:51:42] ask the lord to his for his perfect will
[3:51:45] to be accomplished and it's going to be
[3:51:48] so wonderful to be out from under this
[3:51:50] and it might be before august 22nd might
[3:51:53] not be
[3:51:54] but it might be
[3:51:55] will you help me pray
[3:51:57] father

[3:52:01] i didn't mean to put a damper on what

[3:52:12] contact and just say lord you're the
[3:52:14] same god
