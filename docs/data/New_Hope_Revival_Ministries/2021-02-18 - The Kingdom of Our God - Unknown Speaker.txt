TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there is a kingdom that's above it all it's the kingdom of our god it's a powerful kingdom we're dual citizens in the sense that we were foreknown in another world and our real citizenship is in that other dimension but we were sent here and so as born again believers our spirit man must always stay in touch with the homeland you are a tripartite man and two parts of you should be must be connected to the real genuine spirit of god or let's say to the kingdom of god the other part of you will function in this kingdom but we must make sure that we keep the spirit man the soul life both two parts under submission to the will of god to the mind of god to the leading of the holy ghost because if we are more connected to the kingdom of men the kingdom of the earth than we are to the kingdom of god we will get in so much trouble along the way this world's messed up i just want you to know she's messed up she's not trying the kingdoms of men are not trying they're lying they're not trying to make us one they're trying to make us idiots [Music] they're not trying to make us one they're not trying to bring us in union in unity with one another they're not after unity they're after division they cry unity and then they divide us [Music] into more than two genders into a various flavor of shades and colors and i don't know what else let me tell you something we just have to kind of ignore the kingdom of men we're not a caucasian or white or non-hispanic i've been born again i've been born again hallelujah and i am of another race i am of a super race hallelujah and you can be you can be native american and asian and hispanic and all shades of brown or black and still be a part of this race because this race is not about the kingdom of man it's about the kingdom of god you can't sign up for this you have to be born into this it's got to be our main citizenship our biggest identity is not as an american or as a caucasian or a non-caucasian our biggest identity is found in jesus christ and we have to start thinking like that and you cannot look in a pool of blood on the floor of an operating room or in a public place where there's been a shooting you can't look at that pool of blood and now if a black man bled that blood or a white man bled that blood it's all the same i know people are not treated the same i don't deny the fact that people are not treated the same and it's because people are focusing on a kingdom that's about to shake like it has never shook before the kingdom of man it's going to have to give away and eventually the kingdoms of the earth are going to have to give away and even the kingdoms of heaven are going to have to give away because there is a kingdom that's above it all it's the kingdom of our god it's a powerful kingdom it operates with its own justice system it operates with his own rules and regulations and restrictions and instructions and it is almost always counter culture not cancel culture counterculture it's almost always flowing against the popular culture of the day
