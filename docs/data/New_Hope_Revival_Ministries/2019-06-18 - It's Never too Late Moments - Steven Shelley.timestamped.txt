[0:00] take your place and take it now
[0:04] your family is at stake it's never too
[0:23] late for a man of integrity to go before
[0:28] God on behalf of his children God is
[0:32] looking for a great group of Daniels
[0:35] that will lead the families and will
[0:41] lead the church in prayer and
[0:44] intercession I believe that God is
[0:46] looking for a generation of David's who
[0:50] will lead the church and lead the family
[0:52] in worship and demonstrative praise I
[0:58] believe that we too often say I'm not
[1:01] built that way when we need to say I'm
[1:04] not that old man anyhow I'm a new man
[1:08] and life creation life resurrection life
[1:12] is on the inside of me and I have to cry
[1:15] out it's a demonstration of faith and so
[1:19] maybe maybe the delay you have a portion
[1:22] of responsibility in that it doesn't
[1:24] have to be that way anymore
[1:26] take your place and take it now your
[1:31] family is at stake let mother mother
[1:37] let mother be a mother and you be a
[1:41] warrior God saved you for that reason he
[1:47] delivered you for that reason you be a
[1:51] warrior
