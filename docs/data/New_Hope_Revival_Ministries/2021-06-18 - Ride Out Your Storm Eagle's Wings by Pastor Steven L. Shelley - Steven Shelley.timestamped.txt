[0:10] you've been in the storm
[0:15] it seems like forever
[0:19] your night of confusion
[0:24] has been oh so long
[0:29] your ship has lost anchor
[0:34] and the storm's got you drifting
[0:39] but the night's almost over
[0:44] ride out your storm
[0:49] write out your storm
[0:53] god's right there with you
[0:58] you may not feel him

[1:02] but you're never alone
[1:07] you're hurting now
[1:12] but morning is coming
[1:16] if you'll hold on to jesus
[1:21] he'll help you ride out your storm
[1:31] remember his promise
[1:35] he said i'll never forsake you
[1:40] though the waters be raging
[1:45] they will do you no harm
[1:50] don't give up the battle
[1:55] your answer is coming
