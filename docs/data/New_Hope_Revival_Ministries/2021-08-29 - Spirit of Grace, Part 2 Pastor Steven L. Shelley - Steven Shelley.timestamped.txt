[55:16] where is the church
[55:19] is it conyers
[55:21] covington maybe i don't know up in that
[55:23] area

[55:26] down there were about eight of us there
[55:28] representing uh sister
[55:31] carol's time with us
[55:33] i guess uh she was most faithful here
[55:36] for about seven years in the 90s
[55:39] we loved her dearly she came
[55:42] off and on through the years we still
[55:45] loved her like she was a part of us i
[55:47] still heard from her she still called we
[55:50] still talked and we had prayer together
[55:52] many times these last few years she's
[55:55] been unable to do that and it was very
[55:58] hard to see what arthritis had done
[56:01] to her body
[56:03] really it was a horror to see it
[56:06] the only only piece that i could have
[56:08] looking at that body was knowing
[56:14] she don't live in that house no more
[56:17] oh
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:25] i know that must have been painful as
[56:27] that process was taking place i can't
[56:30] even get i can't even do that
[56:33] you can't even do that like like it was
[56:35] they were her hand was bent all the way
[56:37] back like that
[56:39] and even all she had been through there
[56:40] was still a glow
[56:42] i don't mean from the way they prepare
[56:44] the dead
[56:45] that inner glow
[56:47] and brother gibson danner
[56:50] i sang i'll see you in the rapture
[56:52] brother
[56:53] yes and dinner preached a wonderful
[56:55] message
[56:56] on the value of life
[56:58] and how the world values life one way
[57:00] and how the believer looks at life
[57:02] another way and
[57:03] here was just 30 of us all gathered just
[57:05] 30 people all the people that carol had
[57:08] known her whole life
[57:10] and steve was there and the cousin and
[57:13] and uh her sister's
[57:15] uh
[57:17] sister-in-law or something like that
[57:18] that was the only family that was there
[57:21] but it was a beautiful service and god
[57:23] was honored and brother gibson denner
[57:25] talked about someone like kobe bryant
[57:27] passing and the whole world just seems
[57:30] like just seems like shuts down
[57:32] to to
[57:34] grieve
[57:35] people were crying and didn't know why
[57:36] they were crying
[57:38] people that never met him i'm sure he
[57:39] was an outstanding fellow
[57:41] uh
[57:42] i do know that he did a lot of things
[57:45] for people and that was nice but to the
[57:47] world he was a basketball star and the
[57:50] whole world
[57:51] wept
[57:52] and grieved and laying up there in the
[57:54] valley was a child of god
[57:58] see
[57:58] and just a handful came it don't matter
[58:02] but just a handful came
[58:04] and uh
[58:06] brother gibson ander said the valley
[58:07] don't even know we're here
[58:09] they don't even know we've come there
[58:10] was only three people there from the
[58:12] valley
[58:13] the rest had come from the church in
[58:15] covington or here
[58:17] the valley don't even know what's laying
[58:19] over here oh i'm about to i'll tell you
[58:20] i'm about to shout
[58:22] something's building up in me here
[58:24] hallelujah
[58:25] but he said jesus does
[58:29] oh
[58:30] there was great celebration just a few
[58:32] days ago
[58:33] [Applause]
[58:34] and sister carol kept the faith i want
[58:36] you to know she was one of the strongest
[58:38] people in her faith through the years
[58:40] that i'd ever known
[58:42] she her life was changed when she met
[58:45] jesus
[58:46] it was changed again when she met the
[58:48] ministry of brother branham
[58:50] and
[58:51] she did it through i think it was the
[58:53] hollis had a role in that and
[58:55] i think she might have even been in
[58:57] shreveport in 65 on the wings of a snow
[58:59] white dove
[59:01] and
[59:02] her life from that moment on was a
[59:04] different life she just didn't fit in in
[59:06] church anymore
[59:08] and so she stood faithful
[59:10] it was a memory a stroll down memory
[59:13] lane for me because we stood there just
[59:15] not too far from where some of the
[59:16] hollis are buried and
[59:18] we stood just across from where we
[59:20] buried
[59:21] uh steve's dad's mother
[59:24] vera
[59:25] whitlow i had her service there many
[59:28] many years ago
[59:30] and
[59:31] i just had this thought one of these
[59:33] days
[59:34] this place is not gonna look like it
[59:36] does
[59:38] there's going to be a great change out
[59:40] here in the cemetery i believe that i
[59:43] still believe in the coming of the lord
[59:46] the great resurrection of the dead so
[59:47] i'm taking this time
[59:50] because some of you seniors would have
[59:51] loved to have been there those of you
[59:53] who knew sister carol way back
[59:55] and steve sent me a note and he maybe
[59:58] he's probably streaming this but he sent
[1:00:00] me a note and he said mother would have
[1:00:02] been pleased with her funeral service
[1:00:04] you know that means a lot
[1:00:06] and i'm so thankful that he felt that
[1:00:08] way and would you help me continue to
[1:00:10] pray for him that god will just give him
[1:00:12] the victory he says he's going to come
[1:00:14] and see us and i believe he will
[1:00:17] well it's not a solemn moment it's
[1:00:19] actually a happy moment because i i'm
[1:00:21] just so thankful for what the lord has
[1:00:23] done brother and sister we're so glad to
[1:00:25] have you all i know you i do but i don't
[1:00:28] remember your names brother i figure
[1:00:30] brother skip will fill in where i fail
[1:00:34] god bless you
[1:00:39] you won't you think i'll remember that
[1:00:41] the next time
[1:00:43] i'm gonna try my best brother peter
[1:00:45] god bless you both we're so happy you're
[1:00:47] here today
[1:00:53] is it all right if i
[1:00:54] call you all sandhill people is it or if
[1:00:57] i say that that's your heritage isn't it
[1:00:59] you're not ashamed of that
[1:01:01] and i don't i wouldn't be either
[1:01:04] uh
[1:01:06] i saw where sister judith is having a
[1:01:08] birthday soon i don't know if you people

[1:01:17] moments of fellowship with her and

[1:07:34] we're talking this morning on the spirit
[1:07:36] of grace
[1:07:38] we have covered
[1:07:40] four others this is the fifth
[1:07:43] and isn't that uh appropriate since
[1:07:47] grace is the number five five is the
[1:07:50] number of grace
[1:07:51] we have two more to go when we're
[1:07:53] through
[1:07:54] these are administrations or offices of
[1:07:58] the holy ghost in our lives
[1:08:00] we've had one session on the spirit of
[1:08:02] grace we will do our best to pick up
[1:08:04] where we leave off
[1:08:06] i want you to know that none of us would
[1:08:08] be here today if it were not for the
[1:08:10] spirit of grace
[1:08:12] we've had a few people reach out this
[1:08:14] week and said we didn't know grace was a
[1:08:16] spirit well it is an attribute of the
[1:08:18] spirit
[1:08:19] it's not some inanimate object somewhere
[1:08:21] or some just emotion or some missed or
[1:08:24] grace is a work of the holy ghost
[1:08:27] and i'm so thankful for grace
[1:08:30] he that despised moses law died without
[1:08:34] mercy
[1:08:36] under two or three witnesses
[1:08:39] of how much sorer punishment suppose ye
[1:08:44] shall he be thought worthy
[1:08:46] who hath trodden under foot the son of
[1:08:49] god and hath counted the blood of the
[1:08:53] covenant wherewith he was sanctified an
[1:08:56] unholy thing
[1:08:58] and hath done despite
[1:09:01] unto the spirit of grace may you and i
[1:09:04] never be guilty
[1:09:06] of offending the spirit of grace
[1:09:09] in in
[1:09:11] john chapter 1 i want you to read verse
[1:09:13] 14 and then we will let you have your
[1:09:16] seats
[1:09:17] this is a very powerful verse of
[1:09:19] scripture that we quote so many times
[1:09:21] together verse 14 and the word
[1:09:25] was made flesh
[1:09:27] and dwelt among us do you really believe
[1:09:29] that yes
[1:09:30] you really believe that's who he
[1:09:32] was the same was in the beginning with
[1:09:35] god i do too
[1:09:37] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:09:39] among us
[1:09:40] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[1:09:43] the only begotten of the father would
[1:09:46] you tell me what he was filled with
[1:09:50] full of grace and
[1:09:53] truth
[1:09:54] you want to know where grace came from
[1:09:56] it came from him
[1:09:59] it came from the lord jesus christ that
[1:10:01] same spirit of god that was dwelling in
[1:10:05] him
[1:10:06] now dwelling in the believer
[1:10:08] and one of the works that he carries out
[1:10:11] in our life is he releases to us the
[1:10:14] grace that only comes from god there's
[1:10:16] no grace in this world
[1:10:19] it only comes from god let's pray just a
[1:10:21] moment our father we thank you today
[1:10:24] that you have allowed us by grace
[1:10:27] to be gathered in this house today we've
[1:10:30] come in your name
[1:10:32] we've come to lay aside everything that
[1:10:34] we have been through during the week and
[1:10:37] to focus our hearts and our minds and
[1:10:40] our attention on you
[1:10:41] and lord because you have come among us
[1:10:44] our coming is already most valuable
[1:10:49] we're already so thankful to have known
[1:10:51] your presence here but we believe now
[1:10:54] we're approaching the most important
[1:10:56] part of any service
[1:10:58] and that is when you by the foolishness
[1:11:01] of preaching choose
[1:11:03] to expound your word
[1:11:06] we as believers reach out for that word
[1:11:10] in faith
[1:11:11] we pull it toward us in faith
[1:11:14] and you activate that word in us by the
[1:11:19] power of the holy ghost
[1:11:21] we're not here today to put the word on
[1:11:24] somebody else we're here to take it for
[1:11:26] ourselves
[1:11:28] we see it as a gift of grace to us
[1:11:32] to be able to hear many people have ears
[1:11:35] but they do not have grace to hear lord
[1:11:38] i thank you today for giving each one
[1:11:40] grace to hear and grace to obey we'll
[1:11:44] give you the honor and the glory and the
[1:11:46] praise for all that you accomplish in
[1:11:49] the wonderful name of our lord jesus
[1:11:51] christ we pray and the saints said
[1:11:55] amen you may be seated may god give you
[1:11:57] everyone grace
[1:11:59] to live such a life
[1:12:01] that you never bring insult
[1:12:05] to the spirit of grace
[1:12:07] it's a gift of god to us
[1:12:10] it is by what we're saved we're saved by
[1:12:13] grace
[1:12:14] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:12:17] somebody might be able to do a bigger
[1:12:19] work or a greater work than somebody
[1:12:21] else
[1:12:22] but we're not saved by works amen
[1:12:25] we're saved by the grace of god and
[1:12:28] because grace is a person
[1:12:31] because grace is a work of the holy
[1:12:33] ghost in our lives he gives us strength
[1:12:36] he gives us power to overcome every
[1:12:39] attack of the enemy
[1:12:41] and when the enemy would distract us or
[1:12:43] when he would try to pull us out of the
[1:12:45] way that spirit of grace is activated in
[1:12:48] our hearts by faith and he starts
[1:12:50] pulling us back to the word can anybody
[1:12:53] testify of how the grace of god is
[1:12:55] working not has worked
[1:12:58] not has worked is working in your life
[1:13:02] this grace of god is something we need
[1:13:04] to entertain every day
[1:13:06] we need to encounter the grace of god
[1:13:08] every day we need to recognize the grace
[1:13:11] of god every day in our life and we need
[1:13:13] to give him thanks for it
[1:13:15] amen we just need to get up thanking him
[1:13:18] for grace and go to bed thanking him for
[1:13:20] grace
[1:13:21] and thank him all day long
[1:13:23] because without that grace we're in
[1:13:25] trouble
[1:13:26] it's god's favor to us
[1:13:29] it's god's kindness to us it's god's
[1:13:32] blessing to us and none of us have ever
[1:13:36] deserved it not even one time
[1:13:38] if all of our righteousness was piled in
[1:13:41] here together around this altar a holy
[1:13:44] god come walking in our midst he would
[1:13:47] see all of that and it would still be
[1:13:48] filthy in his sight
[1:13:50] but once the believer recognizes what
[1:13:53] god has accomplished on our behalf and
[1:13:56] the blood that's laying on your altar
[1:13:58] begins to cry out for you and you take
[1:14:00] off the robe of your unrighteousness and
[1:14:03] put on the robe of his righteousness
[1:14:05] when he sees you he sees the blood when
[1:14:08] he sees you he sees his righteousness
[1:14:10] come on now
[1:14:12] when he sees you he sees his favor
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:16] we're blessed
[1:14:18] we're blessed to have a savior who came
[1:14:20] to this earth full
[1:14:22] of grace and truth he is the source of
[1:14:25] grace and truth we we started talking
[1:14:29] last week about the fact that grace is
[1:14:31] not a substance because when we talk
[1:14:33] about grace sometimes we make it sound
[1:14:36] ethereal or or or you know
[1:14:39] like almost an emotion or or a feeling
[1:14:43] we say well by grace i do this by grace
[1:14:45] i do that but do we really understand
[1:14:48] what the spirit of grace is who he is
[1:14:51] and what he is accomplishing in our life
[1:14:54] i know that there are those who try to
[1:14:56] push the grace message beyond the
[1:14:59] scripture
[1:15:01] oh you don't have to do that the
[1:15:03] scripture's clear it's grace that saves
[1:15:05] us it's grace that keeps us it's grace
[1:15:08] that heals us it's grace that delivers
[1:15:10] us
[1:15:11] it's going to take rapturing grace to
[1:15:13] get out of this whole world
[1:15:15] it's going to take resurrection grace to
[1:15:17] be changed
[1:15:18] i need traveling grace
[1:15:21] i need grace to go to town
[1:15:24] we need that grace
[1:15:26] we understand that but because we have
[1:15:28] grace it doesn't dismiss us or let us
[1:15:32] off the hook we must obey the word of
[1:15:34] god we must cooperate with what grace is
[1:15:37] accomplishing in us we must say a man to
[1:15:41] the truth of god's word not just with
[1:15:43] our mouth
[1:15:45] but also with our lives
[1:15:48] if you believe that you can squeeze out
[1:15:49] another
[1:15:50] amen so grace is a work of the spirit i
[1:15:53] want you to write that down if you've
[1:15:55] got a pencil grace is a work of the
[1:15:57] spirit it's the spirit work
[1:16:00] it's a work of the spirit it's a force
[1:16:02] that leaves a tangible testimony that it
[1:16:06] has been somewhere and that it has
[1:16:08] accomplished the father's work
[1:16:11] when grace
[1:16:12] is loosed in our life it accomplishes
[1:16:15] the father's will if we will yield if we
[1:16:18] will cooperate with that however grace
[1:16:21] is more than just god's unmerited favor
[1:16:24] god's grace is what keeps us from
[1:16:27] getting what we deserve
[1:16:29] and gives us the things that we don't
[1:16:31] deserve
[1:16:36] let's drag that one out a little bit
[1:16:39] it not only keeps us from getting what
[1:16:42] we deserve but it provides for us things
[1:16:44] that we never deserve
[1:16:46] grace can be defined today as god's love
[1:16:50] for us in action
[1:16:54] grace has also been defined as god's
[1:16:56] ability to give us new desires
[1:17:01] that old man's dead when we come in
[1:17:03] contact with god's grace we don't want
[1:17:06] the same highs that we used to want
[1:17:09] we don't want the same experiences that
[1:17:11] we used to want we don't want the same
[1:17:13] life that we used to want so god's
[1:17:16] ability to give us new desires and then
[1:17:19] by the spirit he nurtures those desires
[1:17:22] and he begins to bring them forth in our
[1:17:25] life until his will is accomplished oh i
[1:17:28] want to tell you brother it's a setup
[1:17:32] it's a set up
[1:17:33] i hope that doesn't offend anybody it's
[1:17:35] a set up god has set you up to win
[1:17:39] somebody said is that just some positive
[1:17:41] manpower of positive thing are you just
[1:17:43] trying to build everybody oh no i'm just
[1:17:46] telling you like it is you have been set
[1:17:48] up by your creator to win
[1:17:51] you have to make the choice to cooperate
[1:17:53] with the word
[1:17:55] you have to make the choice to walk in
[1:17:57] faith to the word and with the word but
[1:17:59] you have been given i have been given
[1:18:01] everything he requires
[1:18:04] now you you come up with a more
[1:18:06] theological proper term and i'll listen
[1:18:08] to you but for me it's just like a setup
[1:18:11] i want this this this and this from you
[1:18:14] and if you'll trust me i'll give you
[1:18:16] this this and this and this
[1:18:19] what a contract
[1:18:22] now when we hear that phrase two times
[1:18:24] in scripture once in the old testament
[1:18:27] once in the new testament the spirit of
[1:18:30] grace
[1:18:31] we know that word spirit is pneuma in
[1:18:33] the in the greek in the new testament
[1:18:35] it's pneuma it means wind or movement or
[1:18:39] breath
[1:18:40] or life
[1:18:42] it means breeze
[1:18:44] it can means it can mean a current of
[1:18:47] air
[1:18:48] it can mean something that pertains to
[1:18:51] the divine spirit which is the holy
[1:18:53] ghost
[1:18:54] when we look at the word grace we see
[1:18:57] that it means a gift or a blessing it
[1:18:59] means favor it means kindness it means
[1:19:03] favor it means god freely extending
[1:19:06] himself toward people
[1:19:09] so we can say that the spirit of grace
[1:19:13] is god breathing over us his favor
[1:19:18] god getting to us his kindness
[1:19:22] god making a way for you and i to
[1:19:24] encounter the grace of god every day
[1:19:27] because we don't have to come to church
[1:19:29] to find it
[1:19:30] we don't have to be reading the bible to
[1:19:32] find it
[1:19:33] he now lives inside of us this holy
[1:19:36] ghost
[1:19:37] and with that we have received the
[1:19:39] spirit of life amen we have received the
[1:19:42] spirit of truth
[1:19:43] amen
[1:19:44] we have received all that god had the
[1:19:47] spirit of adoption
[1:19:49] we have received the spirit of holiness
[1:19:51] we have received the spirit of grace we
[1:19:54] have received the spirit of supplication
[1:19:56] we have received the spirit of glory
[1:19:59] how how is that possible because the
[1:20:01] holy ghost has come in
[1:20:03] and he brings all of his attributes with
[1:20:05] him and all of his works among us he
[1:20:07] brings that all into us so we don't have
[1:20:10] to go somewhere in the cave to find it
[1:20:13] we don't have to climb up and down the
[1:20:15] stairs of some church with a hail mary
[1:20:17] and a rosary bead in our hand
[1:20:21] we don't have to go sit in the booth and
[1:20:23] tell the preacher all about it
[1:20:26] we just have to believe it
[1:20:28] to accept it by faith and choose to walk
[1:20:32] according to what god's word is ask of
[1:20:34] us
[1:20:35] and when the way gets hard what do we do
[1:20:38] we depend on his grace
[1:20:42] i'm not going to try to tell you that
[1:20:43] serving the lord is the easiest thing
[1:20:45] that anybody's ever tried to do but i
[1:20:47] will tell you this it's it's a lot
[1:20:49] easier than the way of the transgressor
[1:20:52] the bible said the way of the
[1:20:54] transgressor's heart
[1:20:56] you think that's a great life out there
[1:20:58] you think that success is real success
[1:21:01] you think the christian life is a
[1:21:02] struggle that's the struggle brother
[1:21:05] because they have nobody to go to
[1:21:07] they have nobody to depend on there's
[1:21:10] nobody walking in them
[1:21:12] so you and i have the helper that we
[1:21:14] need we have the advocate with that we
[1:21:16] need we have the comforter that we need
[1:21:18] if you believe that's amen
[1:21:21] in the message the message of grace let
[1:21:23] me give you a quotation this shouldn't
[1:21:24] offend anybody
[1:21:26] paragraph 57
[1:21:29] it says so in the deity
[1:21:32] of jesus christ
[1:21:35] if the lord god
[1:21:38] should i pause just a moment we're we're
[1:21:40] going back to something i think that we
[1:21:42] had in the notion last week
[1:21:44] paragraph 57 of the message of grace
[1:21:48] i didn't mean to pull something there
[1:21:50] you go
[1:21:52] how many of you appreciate these ladies
[1:21:55] i appreciate them
[1:21:58] now they're red
[1:22:01] so in the deity of jesus christ
[1:22:04] if the lord god could come there and
[1:22:06] confirm that this is the truth not only
[1:22:09] that
[1:22:10] but by his word he confirms it's the
[1:22:13] truth
[1:22:14] and by signs and wonders he confirms
[1:22:17] it's the truth then also grace is the
[1:22:22] truth
[1:22:23] he said then why could anyone criticize
[1:22:26] and say that grace is wrong
[1:22:29] that we're saved by works
[1:22:32] we are saved by grace and that through
[1:22:35] faith
[1:22:36] not by works
[1:22:39] works shows that you have been saved
[1:22:44] but what saves you
[1:22:46] is the grace of god
[1:22:48] grace
[1:22:49] saves you
[1:22:50] i want us to understand this morning
[1:22:52] that works is a demonstration
[1:22:56] it is a confirmation of what has taken
[1:22:59] place on the inside of our life but our
[1:23:01] works do not save us
[1:23:04] make sure that we get that and that we
[1:23:06] know it and that we understand it
[1:23:08] because it's very important now i want
[1:23:10] to go to john 1. we were just there in
[1:23:12] verse 14. i want us to go to john 1 15
[1:23:15] for just a moment
[1:23:17] i know we're studying a little bit but
[1:23:19] we're getting somewhere and we're going
[1:23:21] to go verse 15 through 18.
[1:23:24] john bear witness of him and cried
[1:23:27] saying this was he of whom i spake
[1:23:31] he that cometh after me is preferred
[1:23:34] before me
[1:23:35] for he was
[1:23:37] before me
[1:23:38] we're not talking about just birth order
[1:23:41] now
[1:23:42] come on now we're talking about before
[1:23:44] abraham was i was
[1:23:46] amen i was i am he said now he was
[1:23:50] before me and then he goes on and of his
[1:23:54] fullness
[1:23:56] have all we received
[1:23:59] and i'd like for you to read those next
[1:24:01] four words
[1:24:04] grace for
[1:24:06] grace
[1:24:08] multiplied
[1:24:10] compounded
[1:24:12] grace
[1:24:13] does that remind you of zechariah's
[1:24:15] prophecy
[1:24:16] that the headstone will come forth with
[1:24:18] shouts of what
[1:24:20] grace grace what is that that's the
[1:24:22] fullness of jesus christ coming
[1:24:25] to cap that stature of a perfect man
[1:24:29] that he's building in his bride church
[1:24:31] there's no doubt about it verse 17 for
[1:24:33] the law was given by moses but grace and
[1:24:37] truth came by jesus christ oh hallelujah
[1:24:42] the law was given by god through moses
[1:24:47] and we appreciate the law because the
[1:24:49] law has a shadow
[1:24:51] of things that are to come it introduced
[1:24:54] to us a covenant that we we could not
[1:24:56] fully appreciate the covenant that we
[1:24:58] walk under today had we not seen what
[1:25:01] god's idea was in the beginning
[1:25:03] he was always after a separated people
[1:25:06] help me a little bit he was all always
[1:25:10] after a separated people and he was
[1:25:12] building and building and building and
[1:25:14] building to get that separated people to
[1:25:16] come forth
[1:25:18] and he was going to accomplish that all
[1:25:20] the time jesus coming
[1:25:22] and crew being crucified and paying the
[1:25:25] ultimate price for our salvation was not
[1:25:28] plan b
[1:25:29] it wasn't an afterthought it's what he
[1:25:32] had in mind from before the foundation
[1:25:34] of the world but he was laying line upon
[1:25:37] line and precept upon precept he was
[1:25:40] first god above us and then god
[1:25:43] with us and now
[1:25:45] god in us by the power of the holy ghost
[1:25:47] you cannot make it in this life
[1:25:50] if if there's someone streaming this
[1:25:52] service and this is offensive to you i
[1:25:54] challenge you get down on your knees
[1:25:57] lock yourself away for a while and ask
[1:26:00] god to fill you with the baptism of the
[1:26:02] holy ghost
[1:26:03] make sure you meet the prerequisite be
[1:26:06] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:26:08] christ and you can receive the gift of
[1:26:10] the holy ghost because we need the holy
[1:26:13] ghost some people say do you need it to
[1:26:15] be raptured do you need it to be
[1:26:17] resurrected do you need it to be this uh
[1:26:20] let me tell you something you needed to
[1:26:21] get out of bed every morning
[1:26:24] we need the holy ghost to live
[1:26:26] because that's god in us
[1:26:29] giving us strength and power to overcome
[1:26:32] in satan's eden
[1:26:35] that's part of the bride's destiny to
[1:26:37] overcome but grace and truth came how
[1:26:41] not by the law
[1:26:43] that was a shadow
[1:26:45] grace and truth came by jesus christ no
[1:26:48] man hath seen god at any time the only
[1:26:51] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[1:26:53] the father he hath declared him and i
[1:26:56] want you to know that's not just a
[1:26:57] declaring with the mouth
[1:26:59] because christ is the mystery of god
[1:27:02] revealed not just the mystery of god
[1:27:04] declared but the mystery of god revealed
[1:27:06] and i want you to know i haven't changed
[1:27:08] my mind through all of these years if
[1:27:11] jesus christ is the mystery of god
[1:27:13] revealed there is an end time bride that
[1:27:16] will be the mystery of christ revealed
[1:27:18] in the last of the last days
[1:27:20] somebody said you really believe that
[1:27:22] yes and i believe i'm looking at part of
[1:27:24] her
[1:27:26] i believe it's in you that he wants to
[1:27:28] manifest who he is
[1:27:30] i believe it's in us that he wants to
[1:27:32] declare the father's glory that's why
[1:27:34] god sent us the truth
[1:27:36] are you with me
[1:27:38] now oh there's so many versions and i
[1:27:40] don't i don't i don't preach out of all
[1:27:42] those versions but i do read them
[1:27:44] sometime and i always try to check them
[1:27:45] by the lexicon and and
[1:27:48] even brother daniel yesterday was
[1:27:50] quoting a little bit from the amplified
[1:27:51] so it must be all right to do that from
[1:27:53] time to time but as i was looking at
[1:27:56] this one verse in a few other
[1:27:58] translations i picked up a couple that
[1:28:00] i'd like to to just leave with you here
[1:28:02] i've already read it in the authorized
[1:28:04] king james version does everybody feel
[1:28:06] all right
[1:28:08] i established it to be first and
[1:28:10] foremost among us
[1:28:13] but another translation said from his
[1:28:15] abundance
[1:28:16] we have all received one gracious
[1:28:19] blessing after another
[1:28:22] now that's verse 16.
[1:28:24] in king james it said and of his
[1:28:26] fullness have all we received grace for
[1:28:29] grace
[1:28:30] another translation from his abundance
[1:28:33] we have all received one gracious
[1:28:35] blessing after another am i talking to
[1:28:38] anybody this morning
[1:28:40] has anybody here received grace for
[1:28:43] grace
[1:28:45] in another version it says we all live
[1:28:47] off his gender generous bounty
[1:28:51] gift after gift after gift
[1:28:55] grace after grace after grace
[1:28:59] after grace
[1:29:00] you see the spirit of grace in our life
[1:29:03] it gives us a divine enabling we are
[1:29:06] enabled by grace to do all things the
[1:29:09] scriptures require
[1:29:12] everything the scripture requires
[1:29:16] instructs a believer to do we are able
[1:29:19] to do that
[1:29:21] although some people will argue with you
[1:29:23] and they'll say i just can't live this
[1:29:25] believer's life
[1:29:26] i just can't live an overcoming life i
[1:29:29] know i know why listen anyone who says
[1:29:31] that to me i know why and you do too
[1:29:33] that's because you're trying to do it by
[1:29:35] yourself if you could have saved
[1:29:37] yourself jesus wouldn't have had to come
[1:29:39] and pay the price on our behalf you
[1:29:41] can't fight this fight alone you can't
[1:29:44] live an overcoming life alone you can't
[1:29:47] reflect jesus christ without having
[1:29:49] jesus christ
[1:29:51] by the holy ghost inside when the spirit
[1:29:54] of grace is operating in a man's life a
[1:29:56] woman's life it's god enabling us to do
[1:30:00] all things the scripture require and the
[1:30:02] same grace that enables us to do what
[1:30:05] the scriptures require gives us the
[1:30:07] grace to walk it out
[1:30:10] to obey it in all situations
[1:30:13] i guess among you seasoned believers
[1:30:15] here very few of you are ever tested in
[1:30:18] your walk with god as mature as you are
[1:30:21] you probably never have to hesitate to
[1:30:23] make sure you do the right thing
[1:30:25] you you've been doing it so long the
[1:30:27] right thing is so automatic you never
[1:30:29] have to pause you just live off the fly
[1:30:32] is that right
[1:30:34] well then i'm not worthy to be with you
[1:30:36] this morning
[1:30:37] because because i'm not that mature
[1:30:40] because i still need to take a minute
[1:30:44] the world sometimes calls that i don't
[1:30:46] want to be too early but it's kind of
[1:30:48] they say it's a chill pill somebody
[1:30:49] needs to take one i do sometimes i have
[1:30:52] to take one but i don't get it in a
[1:30:54] bottle
[1:30:56] i take a moment and i say wait a minute
[1:30:59] i know where this is going aren't you
[1:31:01] glad that you can recognize when the
[1:31:03] enemy is trying to derail you aren't you
[1:31:06] glad that by the spirit of grace you can
[1:31:08] identify that he's come with another
[1:31:11] mask
[1:31:12] he's come with another way of trying to
[1:31:14] pull you out of god's plan you know what
[1:31:16] he really wants to do is pull you into
[1:31:18] condemnation
[1:31:19] he wants to pull you back into guilt no
[1:31:21] siree
[1:31:23] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:31:26] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:31:29] who walk not after the flesh
[1:31:32] it's a choice
[1:31:34] it's a choice
[1:31:35] but by the spirit
[1:31:38] number two the spirit of grace helps us
[1:31:40] in the painful process
[1:31:42] of coming to the cross
[1:31:45] it's painful
[1:31:46] even though the price has been paid on
[1:31:48] our behalf there's a divine exchange
[1:31:51] that has to take place at the foot of
[1:31:52] the cross i like something brother
[1:31:54] gibson anders said yesterday at the
[1:31:56] funeral he said sister carol didn't just
[1:31:58] die
[1:32:00] he said there's no death like that to
[1:32:02] the believer carol whitlow died many
[1:32:06] years ago
[1:32:08] how many of you believe it's true
[1:32:10] i believe that for you
[1:32:12] you count it up and tell me how many
[1:32:15] years ago did you die
[1:32:17] you died to self
[1:32:19] you died to sin
[1:32:20] have you always got it right since then
[1:32:23] i think not but you invited the only
[1:32:26] thing that's going to help you get out
[1:32:28] of it
[1:32:28] the only presence the only power the
[1:32:31] only authority that's going to help us
[1:32:33] get up above the oppressor
[1:32:35] the one who comes to deceive and to
[1:32:37] destroy the thief that comes to steal
[1:32:40] and to kill and to destroy your life the
[1:32:42] only thing that's going to get us above
[1:32:44] that is trusting in that grace of god
[1:32:47] he helps us in that painful process of
[1:32:50] coming to the cross and exchanging our
[1:32:52] own sinful nature for the sinless nature
[1:32:54] of christ
[1:32:56] come on
[1:32:57] it's not always pleasant but it it's
[1:33:00] available to us by grace number three it
[1:33:02] forms the character of christ in us i
[1:33:05] want to tell you something this is
[1:33:06] something we're missing in many many
[1:33:07] cases
[1:33:08] in our lives and in our families maybe
[1:33:11] church family
[1:33:13] we miss taking that moment to say wait a
[1:33:16] minute
[1:33:18] i'm not here to get my way
[1:33:21] i'm not here to prove my point
[1:33:24] i'm here to try to manifest the
[1:33:26] character of jesus christ
[1:33:28] you know we laugh at the church world
[1:33:29] out there because they got so carried
[1:33:31] away some years ago with wwjd
[1:33:34] they wore it on their bracelets and they
[1:33:36] sung songs about it and they read books
[1:33:38] about it what would jesus do and a lot
[1:33:40] of holiness people you know we can
[1:33:42] easily kind of brush that off and think
[1:33:44] that that's a little bit silly but i
[1:33:45] want you to know something
[1:33:47] the way they go after it might be silly
[1:33:49] but the reality of it is necessary
[1:33:52] that divine pause that says wait a
[1:33:54] minute i've got another character that
[1:33:56] i've got to put on display here
[1:33:58] i've got another character that i've got
[1:34:00] to let move out of me up through me and
[1:34:03] out of me because a world is dying and
[1:34:05] going to hell around me and i'm the only
[1:34:07] bible that most people read
[1:34:10] so i've got to yield it and when you
[1:34:12] can't do it you can't bear the
[1:34:13] responsibility of the lost
[1:34:16] i want you to know if you get caught up
[1:34:17] in that burden that think that you could
[1:34:19] bear the responsibility for all lost
[1:34:22] mankind you cannot do that it is not
[1:34:25] your burden to bear it is not your
[1:34:27] responsibility but it is our
[1:34:29] responsibility to reflect the character
[1:34:32] of jesus christ and it's up to the holy
[1:34:34] ghost to put people in our life that we
[1:34:37] can make a difference
[1:34:39] it's up to us to follow the leadership
[1:34:41] of the lord and he'll send you to
[1:34:42] strange places sometime
[1:34:44] because he wants to get glory in your
[1:34:46] life
[1:34:47] and you're going are you still with me
[1:34:49] number four it sustains us the spirit of
[1:34:52] grace
[1:34:54] the breath of grace
[1:34:56] the wind of god's grace in our life
[1:34:59] sustains us
[1:35:00] in the most difficult situations
[1:35:03] that we will ever face in life
[1:35:05] the grief of losing a loved one
[1:35:07] the panic of a pandemic
[1:35:10] losing a job
[1:35:12] losing a home
[1:35:14] losing a loved one losing a spouse
[1:35:16] losing a child
[1:35:18] you could go on and on and on and think
[1:35:20] about all the darkest moments of your
[1:35:21] life did you get through
[1:35:23] if you got through you got through
[1:35:25] because the spirit of grace was
[1:35:26] operating in your life somebody said i
[1:35:28] wasn't even a christian then let me tell
[1:35:30] you something god didn't find you
[1:35:33] when you knelt in an altar
[1:35:36] he knew who you were before the
[1:35:37] foundation of the world his grace was
[1:35:40] already running after you
[1:35:43] his grace was already seeking you
[1:35:46] before you recognized it enough to seek
[1:35:48] him
[1:35:49] you believe that
[1:35:50] i believe that this spirit of grace
[1:35:52] number five it helps us in the mundane
[1:35:54] things of life
[1:35:56] and not just in hard situations and in
[1:35:59] difficult relationships but just
[1:36:02] everyday typical life
[1:36:04] of a child of god
[1:36:06] just the same old same old sometime
[1:36:09] in those moments when we don't feel like
[1:36:11] we're climbing mountaintops
[1:36:13] in those moments when we don't feel like
[1:36:15] we're chasing devils out of the way in
[1:36:17] those moments when we feel like we're
[1:36:19] barely treading water
[1:36:21] not really going forward afraid we might
[1:36:23] be slipping backward we're feeling a
[1:36:25] little anxiety because of where we are
[1:36:27] let me tell you something it's the grace
[1:36:29] of god that sustains us even in those
[1:36:31] moments
[1:36:33] it's his power that keeps us
[1:36:35] it's his grace that sustains us
[1:36:38] and number six that spirit of grace
[1:36:40] lives up a standard daily
[1:36:42] in our lives against the enemy
[1:36:45] and provides help in our time of trouble
[1:36:48] and gives us liberty and freedom
[1:36:51] i read this to you last sunday i'm going
[1:36:53] to read it quickly and move on without
[1:36:55] the spirit of grace we cannot live up to
[1:36:57] our profession
[1:36:59] we cannot copy the example of our
[1:37:01] beloved master we cannot keep his
[1:37:03] commandments we cannot love one another
[1:37:06] as he has loved us we cannot sympathize
[1:37:09] with lost sinners in the world around us
[1:37:13] we cannot keep god's glory in view in
[1:37:16] all that we do and say
[1:37:18] we cannot walk in high in holy
[1:37:19] fellowship with god without the spirit
[1:37:21] of grace
[1:37:23] we cannot meet death with peace and joy
[1:37:26] without the spirit of grace do you
[1:37:27] believe we need him
[1:37:29] i want to ask you how important is the
[1:37:31] spirit of grace in your life
[1:37:33] and how do we receive grace
[1:37:35] it comes to us as a breath of god it
[1:37:38] comes to us as a gift of god it comes to
[1:37:40] us as a release
[1:37:42] i want to present to you that grace
[1:37:44] affects every area of our life
[1:37:46] you believe that number one it affects
[1:37:49] our salvation i don't usually number
[1:37:50] things but i've numbered them in these
[1:37:52] notes you'll you'll forgive me and work
[1:37:54] with me
[1:37:54] ephesians 2 8
[1:37:56] for
[1:37:57] by grace
[1:37:59] are
[1:38:00] ye
[1:38:01] saved
[1:38:02] through
[1:38:03] faith
[1:38:05] and that not of yourselves
[1:38:09] it
[1:38:10] is the gift of god
[1:38:13] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:38:15] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:38:18] gift of god so the spirit of grace
[1:38:21] operating in our life is what brings us
[1:38:24] to salvation would you say that's
[1:38:25] important
[1:38:27] the most important
[1:38:29] and then in romans 3 24 they should be
[1:38:32] in order romans 3 24
[1:38:34] being justified freely
[1:38:38] by
[1:38:39] his grace
[1:38:41] through
[1:38:42] redemption that is in christ jesus we
[1:38:47] are justified freely by his great do you
[1:38:52] need the spirit of grace yes
[1:38:54] by that spirit we are justified freely
[1:38:57] through the redemption that is in christ
[1:38:59] jesus the only way that you and i can
[1:39:01] enter into a relationship with god is
[1:39:04] because of his grace toward us
[1:39:08] if you call yourself a saved person a
[1:39:11] born-again person it is because of god's
[1:39:15] grace
[1:39:17] it's vital it's necessary
[1:39:20] i want you to look at genesis 3 21.
[1:39:24] you know this verse well
[1:39:26] this was the first demonstration
[1:39:31] symbolic
[1:39:33] of god's divine grace
[1:39:37] in the bible
[1:39:39] unto adam
[1:39:41] also and to his wife
[1:39:44] did the lord god
[1:39:46] this is a physical act
[1:39:51] did the lord god make
[1:39:53] coats of skins
[1:39:56] and clothe them
[1:39:58] why did he do it he did it to cover up
[1:40:00] their nakedness
[1:40:02] the nakedness that just a few hours
[1:40:04] before they didn't even know they had
[1:40:07] it was god's grace how many of you can
[1:40:09] hear brother branham every time we talk
[1:40:11] about it we can hear the message where
[1:40:13] brother branham is preaching about adam
[1:40:15] and eve walking out of that garden with
[1:40:17] those bloody skins slapping the back of
[1:40:20] their legs
[1:40:22] where did they get those skins god
[1:40:24] himself came down and slew lambs
[1:40:30] he slew sheep
[1:40:32] and he made adam and eve all they could
[1:40:35] come together and figure out was some
[1:40:37] fig leaves
[1:40:39] i don't think fig leaves did much
[1:40:40] covering up
[1:40:42] i think people have gone back to fig
[1:40:43] leaves don't you
[1:40:49] you know people don't understand
[1:40:50] original sin like we do here
[1:40:53] and sometimes people will say well uh
[1:40:56] i'll tell you this uh
[1:40:57] eating an apple if eating an apple would
[1:41:00] cause you to know you're naked
[1:41:04] brother ram said we need to pass the
[1:41:06] apples
[1:41:09] how many of you know that's not the way
[1:41:10] it works
[1:41:11] they were naked but not ashamed because
[1:41:15] they were covered by the shekinah by the
[1:41:18] heavy glory of god they didn't know they
[1:41:22] had not been made aware of the of the of
[1:41:26] the knowledge between good and evil it
[1:41:28] was all good they didn't know evil
[1:41:30] existed hallelujah
[1:41:32] there was no shame in their nakedness
[1:41:34] now they've sinned against god and when
[1:41:36] god was coming in the evening for the
[1:41:38] next appointment of fellowship they
[1:41:40] wanted to make sure they didn't face him
[1:41:42] in their newfound nakedness
[1:41:44] so they grabbed them some fig leaves and
[1:41:46] started sewing them together and trying
[1:41:48] to figure out how they would cover god
[1:41:50] said that'll never work but i have a
[1:41:52] better way
[1:41:54] i have a grace-filled way
[1:41:57] i'm going to show you what it's all
[1:41:58] about
[1:42:01] it must
[1:42:02] there must be a lamb
[1:42:06] there must be a death
[1:42:09] there must be blood shed
[1:42:12] and then i'm going to take off those
[1:42:14] skin this is god i tell you what a
[1:42:16] tailor he was
[1:42:18] that he would come down in the garden of
[1:42:19] eden and make coats of skin and put them
[1:42:23] on adam and eve let me tell you
[1:42:25] something that was grace
[1:42:27] breaking forth in a garden
[1:42:30] that had just lost its way
[1:42:32] i want you to know the atmosphere of
[1:42:34] glory that had been in that garden was
[1:42:37] now gone it was a different place eden
[1:42:40] would never look the same
[1:42:43] it was gloomy and depressing and god
[1:42:46] shows up and he makes away by his grace
[1:42:50] where there is no way and he's still
[1:42:52] making the same way today provided a
[1:42:55] lamb that would provide for you a bloody
[1:42:58] cloth that you could wrap yourself in
[1:43:01] the clothes of his redemptive work
[1:43:05] that you would not stand before him
[1:43:07] naked what did it
[1:43:08] because you joined the right church
[1:43:11] because you recognized the right prophet
[1:43:14] because you said you believed a certain
[1:43:16] message
[1:43:18] no because you accepted the gift of
[1:43:21] god's grace hallelujah and you let that
[1:43:24] work in you
[1:43:26] don't ever stop his work don't ever stop
[1:43:29] letting grace do its job in you i want
[1:43:31] to thank god that grace is still working
[1:43:34] in me
[1:43:35] god's still using his grace to talk to
[1:43:38] my heart
[1:43:39] hallelujah
[1:43:41] he could have killed those first humans
[1:43:44] right there for their disobedience but
[1:43:46] rather than destroying them he chose to
[1:43:48] make a way for them to be right with him
[1:43:50] that pattern of grace continued
[1:43:52] throughout the old testament when god
[1:43:54] instituted blood offerings as a means to
[1:43:56] atone for sinful men it was not the
[1:43:59] physical blood of those sacrifices per
[1:44:01] se that cleansed the sinner it was the
[1:44:03] grace of god that forgave those who
[1:44:06] trusted in him hebrews 10 and 4 will
[1:44:08] tell you that sinful men showed their
[1:44:11] faith by offering offerings and
[1:44:14] sacrifices that god required it was
[1:44:17] pointing the way to another way to
[1:44:20] another day to a better sacrifice
[1:44:23] something else was coming that would do
[1:44:25] for us what the law of moses was unable
[1:44:28] to do in a message called israel and the
[1:44:31] church i'd like to give you a few
[1:44:33] paragraphs there if you'll permit me to
[1:44:34] do that
[1:44:35] i'm asking permission
[1:44:37] good paragraph 46
[1:44:42] in the garden of eden when man sinned
[1:44:44] first
[1:44:45] look at the nature of a sinner hiding
[1:44:52] hiding somewhere in the dark
[1:44:56] the children of the evil one they like
[1:44:58] the darkness don't they
[1:45:00] because their deeds are evil
[1:45:02] don't be too critical
[1:45:04] because you and i have hid from god a
[1:45:06] time or two
[1:45:08] we thought he wouldn't find us
[1:45:10] oh
[1:45:11] what a dumb mistake we were making to
[1:45:13] think that god didn't know where we
[1:45:14] lived he knows exactly where we are at
[1:45:18] any given time
[1:45:19] he said but it should have been adam
[1:45:21] calling out to god
[1:45:24] but instead it was adam hiding and god
[1:45:28] calling to adam oh brother robert i tell
[1:45:31] you that thrills me
[1:45:34] it should have been me calling out to
[1:45:36] god it should have been me recognizing
[1:45:39] what was going on and calling out to him
[1:45:41] but before i ever called his name he was
[1:45:43] calling for me
[1:45:45] the prophet of god tells us no man ever
[1:45:47] sought god of his own mind at any time
[1:45:50] it was only when god was seeking man
[1:45:53] that there became this glorious
[1:45:58] we experienced christ because christ was
[1:46:01] seeking his own
[1:46:04] he came looking he came seeking sister
[1:46:08] jeffrey used to sing
[1:46:09] he came seeking for me
[1:46:13] adam was hiding
[1:46:16] he thought god may have come to kill him
[1:46:19] god didn't come down like that to kill
[1:46:21] adam he came down to dress him
[1:46:25] he came down to cover him with something
[1:46:28] that would make a way for him to have
[1:46:29] another opportunity down the road
[1:46:32] but it should have been adam calling god
[1:46:34] but it was adam hiding and god was
[1:46:36] calling adam adam
[1:46:38] where art thou
[1:46:40] brother branham asks you see it let's go
[1:46:42] on
[1:46:45] that's the nature of a sinner hide run
[1:46:47] away get behind something but god
[1:46:50] calling oh my
[1:46:52] grace amazing grace are you with me
[1:46:57] grace amazing grace god calling and now
[1:47:01] notice you say oh that was adam and eve
[1:47:04] it's always through the bible the same
[1:47:07] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:47:09] my father draws him is that right now
[1:47:12] that's the word and that's the way we
[1:47:14] want it the word then you know where
[1:47:16] you're standing
[1:47:17] aren't you glad for the word all right
[1:47:20] let's read on how many in here
[1:47:22] are christians tonight know that you're
[1:47:24] christians there's something in you says
[1:47:27] you are a christian yeah all right you
[1:47:29] see
[1:47:30] why you should be the happiest
[1:47:35] come on brother steve
[1:47:37] you should be the happiest people in the
[1:47:41] world
[1:47:45] i don't mean to be harmed too critical
[1:47:47] here
[1:47:48] but have you ever noticed that some
[1:47:50] holiness people
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:54] are the most miserable looking people
[1:47:57] you've ever seen in your
[1:48:00] life do you think they've smelt one
[1:48:02] another or something
[1:48:05] and that's why they look as sour as they
[1:48:07] look
[1:48:08] i've been all over the world and i've
[1:48:10] ran into holiness people and i do my
[1:48:12] very best when i meet people who dare
[1:48:15] who dare swim in another direction than
[1:48:18] the direction the world is swimming in i
[1:48:20] honor that i don't care if they're amish
[1:48:22] or mennonite or pentecostal holiness or
[1:48:25] message or or
[1:48:27] whatever they are i honor anybody who
[1:48:31] who is willing to to stand and say i i
[1:48:33] want to testify with my life
[1:48:36] i want to testify with the way i dress i
[1:48:39] want to testify by the way i talk and
[1:48:41] the way i walk that i'm a separated
[1:48:44] child of god i want to be an ambassador
[1:48:46] of heaven on this earth i honor that but
[1:48:49] in my experience through the years i've
[1:48:51] seen some of the most miserable
[1:48:56] sad oppressed
[1:48:58] sour looking people that i have ever
[1:49:01] known in my life
[1:49:05] i have caught myself a time or two
[1:49:07] thinking i wonder what a a perm would do
[1:49:09] for that woman
[1:49:13] that's an awful thing to say and i
[1:49:14] wonder if she'd be different
[1:49:17] i wonder she'd be happier about her life
[1:49:19] if she was going another direction
[1:49:22] now i'm telling you here i'm not in any
[1:49:24] way suggesting that anybody should go
[1:49:27] and pattern themselves after the world
[1:49:29] but what i am saying is you and i who
[1:49:32] have been bought by the precious blood
[1:49:34] of jesus and saved by the amazing grace
[1:49:37] of an amazing god we ought to be the
[1:49:40] happiest people on the face of the earth
[1:49:43] somebody said what if you're going
[1:49:45] through a hard time paul and silas were
[1:49:50] what if you're going through a hard time
[1:49:51] miriam and moses and the children of
[1:49:53] israel had just come through the hardest
[1:49:55] time of their life but they looked up
[1:49:57] and saw the victory
[1:49:59] oh hallelujah and miriam had a
[1:50:02] tambourine and led a dance hallelujah in
[1:50:05] the presence of the lord
[1:50:07] it's not what you do in here that i'm
[1:50:09] talking about it's what we do out there
[1:50:13] let the joy of the lord be your strength
[1:50:18] i want to say something unpopular i
[1:50:20] believe
[1:50:21] it is not necessary to be grumpy
[1:50:24] because you're getting older
[1:50:28] there was five amens
[1:50:32] they all come from the shelley house
[1:50:36] if you wondered who those amens come
[1:50:38] from that was stacy benjamin joshua
[1:50:41] living right
[1:50:43] i don't want to be that grumpy old man
[1:50:48] you pray for me i want the spirit of
[1:50:50] grace
[1:50:52] to live me up above my grumpiness
[1:50:56] i want to live exactly like the bible
[1:50:58] said i can live exactly like the prophet
[1:51:00] of god told me i can live we ought to be
[1:51:03] the happiest people in the world they
[1:51:07] ought to be walking up to us and asking
[1:51:09] us why are you not why do you have long
[1:51:12] hair
[1:51:14] and i believe in it
[1:51:16] why do you have on a skirt and i believe
[1:51:18] in it but that's not what they ought to
[1:51:20] be asking us they ought to be walking up
[1:51:23] and saying why are you people so happy
[1:51:26] every time i see you you look so
[1:51:29] happy
[1:51:31] and then you can open wide i feel good
[1:51:34] then you can open wide your mouth and
[1:51:36] tell them because jesus lives on the
[1:51:40] inside of me
[1:51:42] and what i cannot do for myself he has
[1:51:46] done it on my behalf
[1:51:49] and it gives me not only joy but it
[1:51:52] makes me happy
[1:51:54] hallelujah
[1:51:56] we are we you should be the happiest
[1:51:58] people in the world he said you should
[1:52:00] just believe that my that's easy
[1:52:02] take god's word for it look at your
[1:52:05] neighbor and say take god's word for it
[1:52:07] thank you for doing it take god's word
[1:52:09] for it or you make it sound like it's
[1:52:11] easy you're you're talking about the
[1:52:13] wrong preacher
[1:52:15] i have never tried to make you think
[1:52:16] it's easy
[1:52:18] i have been as transparent before you as
[1:52:21] i possibly know how to be i have told
[1:52:23] you of my own struggles
[1:52:25] i just told you i don't want to be that
[1:52:27] grumpy old man that i can be sometime
[1:52:29] i'm not telling you it's easy but i'm
[1:52:32] telling you i have a whole lot easier
[1:52:34] part
[1:52:36] than the one who purchased this on my
[1:52:38] behalf
[1:52:40] and all i have to do is say lord it's
[1:52:42] not me
[1:52:43] it's you
[1:52:44] are you still with me
[1:52:46] let's see i got a little more time not a
[1:52:48] lot but a little more
[1:52:50] thank you
[1:52:52] it goes on
[1:52:55] we ought to be the happiest people he
[1:52:58] said now before you can become a
[1:52:59] christian god called you now you calling
[1:53:02] god not you calling god god called you
[1:53:04] now he called abraham and he's the
[1:53:06] father of us all the faith notice now he
[1:53:09] said abraham
[1:53:11] now it's election i want to know if you
[1:53:13] can say amen to that
[1:53:15] it is election
[1:53:17] election is god's choosing
[1:53:19] and god chooses based on what he knows
[1:53:21] about you
[1:53:23] before you are ever manifested in this
[1:53:25] earth hallelujah it's not that god
[1:53:28] didn't give you a choice
[1:53:30] it's that he knew your choice before the
[1:53:32] foundation of the world and by that
[1:53:34] choice he predestinated you and elected
[1:53:37] you to a grace that neither of us
[1:53:39] deserve
[1:53:40] he said i want to get on that election
[1:53:42] because it's the truth he said now you
[1:53:44] didn't become a christian just
[1:53:46] coincidence because you become a
[1:53:48] christian before you was in this world
[1:53:52] now don't don't think for one moment
[1:53:55] that he is teaching you you didn't have
[1:53:57] to have the grace of god in the blood of
[1:53:59] jesus christ no no no no he's telling
[1:54:01] you god knew exactly what you were going
[1:54:04] to do before you got here
[1:54:07] and your life was perfect
[1:54:12] there's very few of us that would say
[1:54:14] i've lived i've had a perfect life
[1:54:18] because we're measuring see how quiet it
[1:54:20] is
[1:54:21] because we're measuring perfection by
[1:54:23] what we had
[1:54:25] did i have a loving mother did i have a
[1:54:26] loving father did i had a steady home
[1:54:28] environment was there no alcohol were
[1:54:30] there no vices in my home did everybody
[1:54:31] love each other and smooch each other
[1:54:33] all the time
[1:54:34] that's what we're looking for in a
[1:54:35] perfect life that's not the one god
[1:54:37] promised you but i tell you if he knew
[1:54:39] your choice before the foundation of the
[1:54:41] world he gave you a life that would
[1:54:43] bring you to him in this critical hour
[1:54:46] you don't have to say man you can't
[1:54:47] change the word
[1:54:49] you're here this morning because god has
[1:54:52] led you this way by his sovereign grace
[1:54:57] you believe what you believe you testify
[1:54:59] of what you testify because god's
[1:55:02] allowed circumstances of your life to
[1:55:04] line up in such a way that sometimes he
[1:55:07] has led us and sometimes he squeezed us
[1:55:12] sometimes he led us gently and sometimes
[1:55:14] he squeezed us rather
[1:55:17] tightly
[1:55:18] to bring us to a place like this he had
[1:55:20] to do it for the children of israel
[1:55:22] are you still with me
[1:55:24] he said now but your he goes on he said
[1:55:26] oh you say is that right brother that's
[1:55:28] the truth god before there was ever
[1:55:31] before there was ever you before you
[1:55:34] knowed anything let me let me help the
[1:55:36] situation out there just a little bit
[1:55:38] before you note anything and that's the
[1:55:40] truth i believe it
[1:55:42] he goes on
[1:55:43] oh no that's the end of that one look at
[1:55:45] romans chapter 5 with me just a moment
[1:55:48] romans 5 17
[1:55:50] how important is grace the spirit of
[1:55:52] grace in our life without it we're not
[1:55:54] saved that's what we're looking at right
[1:55:55] now romans 5 17 says for if by one man's
[1:55:59] offense death reigned by one
[1:56:01] much more they which receive abundance
[1:56:04] of grace
[1:56:06] and of the gift of righteousness
[1:56:09] shall reign in life by one jesus christ
[1:56:12] how many of you follow the word there
[1:56:15] for if one man's offense
[1:56:17] death reigned by one much more they
[1:56:20] which receive abundance of grace and of
[1:56:22] the gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:56:24] life by one jesus christ folks we have
[1:56:28] received an abundance of grace we have
[1:56:30] received a gift of righteousness
[1:56:34] we're a blessed people
[1:56:36] the amplified says it this way
[1:56:39] for if because of one's one man's
[1:56:42] trespass lapse offense death reigned
[1:56:47] through that one
[1:56:48] much more surely
[1:56:50] will those who receive god's overflowing
[1:56:53] grace unmerited favor
[1:56:56] and the free gift of righteousness
[1:56:59] putting them into right standing with
[1:57:01] himself
[1:57:02] reign as kings in life
[1:57:05] through the one man jesus christ the
[1:57:09] messiah and the anointed one
[1:57:12] i want to read this
[1:57:13] in in weymouth for just a moment i don't
[1:57:15] know if i i don't know if i gave you
[1:57:16] that or not
[1:57:18] but in the weymouth translation
[1:57:21] it says
[1:57:22] this way
[1:57:23] for if through the transgression of the
[1:57:26] one individual
[1:57:28] death made use
[1:57:30] of the one individual
[1:57:33] to see sovereignty
[1:57:35] all the more shall those who receive
[1:57:39] god's overflowing grace
[1:57:44] it's not a trickle of grace that you and
[1:57:46] i have received
[1:57:48] it's an overflowing and abundance of
[1:57:50] grace
[1:57:51] and the gift of righteousness we reign
[1:57:54] as kings in life
[1:57:56] through the one individual
[1:57:58] jesus christ
[1:57:59] the work is done
[1:58:01] romans 5 21 if you'll give that to me
[1:58:04] quickly i'll hurry
[1:58:07] in the in the king james
[1:58:10] that as sin has rained unto death
[1:58:14] even so might grace
[1:58:17] reign
[1:58:22] there's a redeeming authority in your
[1:58:24] life it's not death
[1:58:28] there's a reigning authority in your
[1:58:30] life it's not sin
[1:58:33] there's a reigning authority in your
[1:58:35] life it's not the old nature
[1:58:38] the reigning authority in your life is
[1:58:41] grace
[1:58:42] he said that as sin hath reigned unto
[1:58:44] death even so might grace reign through
[1:58:48] righteousness unto eternal life by jesus
[1:58:52] christ our lord by the spirit of grace
[1:58:56] you can show us in the amplified
[1:58:59] he said so that justice sin has reigned
[1:59:02] in death so grace his unearned and
[1:59:06] undeserved favor might reign also
[1:59:09] through righteousness which is right
[1:59:11] standing with god which issues
[1:59:14] which issues in eternal life through
[1:59:16] jesus christ the messiah the anointed
[1:59:19] one our lord contending for the faith
[1:59:22] look at this
[1:59:26] 1956.
[1:59:31] we are tempted
[1:59:33] you believe that
[1:59:35] all of us are tempted
[1:59:38] all of us sin
[1:59:40] there's none without sin
[1:59:43] every day we sin
[1:59:47] now you know if you have a traditional
[1:59:50] church mentality of what sin is
[1:59:54] you might not understand that message
[1:59:57] because i came from a pentecostal
[1:59:59] holiness tradition
[2:00:01] where everything was sin
[2:00:04] right
[2:00:05] we couldn't keep up with each other sin
[2:00:09] because we would go to one church and
[2:00:10] they believed that it was sin for a
[2:00:12] woman not to wear a hat this was
[2:00:14] pentecostal churches i believe it was
[2:00:17] sin
[2:00:18] and you'd go to another church and i
[2:00:20] heard them preach my grandmother was
[2:00:22] with me i heard them preach it for a
[2:00:24] woman to wear a hat in church
[2:00:26] with sin
[2:00:28] now what's a woman to do
[2:00:32] we were in churches where they preached
[2:00:34] that it was sin to drink a coca-cola
[2:00:38] but all right to have an rc cola
[2:00:43] don't laugh too hard it's the truth
[2:00:44] that's where some of us come from
[2:00:48] my granny tells a story i've told you
[2:00:50] many times through the year she had an
[2:00:52] evangelist in the church in blue springs
[2:00:55] he says before she came to the message
[2:00:57] and stepped aside but she was pastoring
[2:00:59] then
[2:01:00] and she had an evangelist there and he
[2:01:02] got up that night and he preached so
[2:01:03] hard on coca-cola
[2:01:06] he said
[2:01:06] the church is full of cocaine addicts
[2:01:12] and
[2:01:13] my granny was working in a cotton mill
[2:01:16] and driving all the way to blue spring
[2:01:17] springs alabama
[2:01:19] night after night after night for
[2:01:20] revival and coming home working the
[2:01:22] cotton meal and going back she was tired
[2:01:25] she said to the brother as they pulled
[2:01:26] in a little a gas station there on the
[2:01:29] highway coming home down through
[2:01:31] eufaula
[2:01:33] she said brother i'm so sorry i wouldn't
[2:01:35] offend you for anything but she said i
[2:01:37] don't drink coffee
[2:01:38] but she said i think if i could just she
[2:01:40] was doing the driving they're sitting in
[2:01:41] the back
[2:01:43] she said i believe if i could just get a
[2:01:44] cold coca-cola i believe it would help
[2:01:47] keep me awake
[2:01:49] and i could drive us on home
[2:01:53] this used to get her i wish you could
[2:01:55] tell it
[2:01:56] or it used to get her she turned purple
[2:01:58] when she tell it
[2:01:59] and she he said oh no sister mildred
[2:02:03] that won't offend us and all my wife and
[2:02:05] i'll have a double cola
[2:02:12] she said i said all right i shut the
[2:02:14] door and she said as i walked into that
[2:02:16] store a double coal cola
[2:02:19] double cola
[2:02:20] and she said i got in there and i got
[2:02:22] that double cola and it said twice
[2:02:26] the punch
[2:02:30] of a coca-cola
[2:02:33] she said i realized he was more offended
[2:02:35] by the name
[2:02:37] than he was the ingredient
[2:02:39] you see it was such a time period where
[2:02:42] everybody was looking for what they
[2:02:44] might do or not do because they didn't
[2:02:47] want to be offensive to the lord they
[2:02:49] were sincere in their heart
[2:02:52] one of the struggles i had when i came
[2:02:54] to hear brother branham's message was i
[2:02:56] heard him say one dime time early he
[2:02:59] said why there's only one sin
[2:03:05] i said not at my church
[2:03:10] there's only one sin i turned it off i
[2:03:14] thought sure this is heresy
[2:03:17] there could not be one sin we've got
[2:03:19] hundreds of sins and we don't wish some
[2:03:22] we're not sure about
[2:03:23] so there may be thousands of sin and you
[2:03:26] know what he brought us right back to
[2:03:27] the word this is important for somebody
[2:03:30] he brought us right back to the word and
[2:03:31] showed us what sin is
[2:03:34] some of these things may be the
[2:03:35] attributes of sin
[2:03:37] but sin is unbelief
[2:03:41] the bible tells us that the root of
[2:03:43] everything that is against god or
[2:03:46] ungodly is unbelief
[2:03:48] and so you may not struggle with whether
[2:03:51] or not to drink a coca-cola
[2:03:53] and you may not struggle with whether or
[2:03:55] not to do this to your hair do that or
[2:03:57] to do the other but i want you to know
[2:03:59] where the enemy tempts us
[2:04:02] as a believer on a on a fairly regular
[2:04:06] basis
[2:04:07] brother bantam said here daily is will
[2:04:09] you believe god's word or will you yield
[2:04:13] to how you feel
[2:04:15] will you yield to fear or will you take
[2:04:18] the high road of faith come on
[2:04:21] will you choose to take god's word over
[2:04:24] what the news says over what your body
[2:04:27] will tell you over what the enemy will
[2:04:29] whisper in your ear we are tempted every
[2:04:33] day
[2:04:34] to cooperate with unbelief
[2:04:36] and it is a believer's authority there's
[2:04:39] a there is an authority by the spirit of
[2:04:41] grace in you that will raise up in you
[2:04:43] if you yield to it and it'll answer that
[2:04:45] accuser it'll answer that suggestion
[2:04:48] it'll answer that temptation of the
[2:04:50] enemy every time i choose to believe
[2:04:52] god's word
[2:04:53] i choose to believe god's word i don't
[2:04:55] know about you but i know many people
[2:04:57] fighting covet
[2:04:59] and that pain that little tightness be
[2:05:01] in their chest and the devil would start
[2:05:02] whispering to him
[2:05:04] everything better be set in order
[2:05:07] you better make sure you sure did want
[2:05:09] to put in a garden next year
[2:05:12] all the things will start coming to your
[2:05:14] mind and if you cooperate with that more
[2:05:17] than 30 seconds
[2:05:19] if you cooperate with that thing it'll
[2:05:21] take you down a trail with so many
[2:05:24] switchbacks you may never find your way
[2:05:26] back to faith
[2:05:27] so you've got to shut that thing off
[2:05:29] you've got to cut the enemy off of the
[2:05:31] past is anybody hearing what i'm saying
[2:05:34] today and you've got to say wait a
[2:05:36] minute enemy wait a minute devil i'm
[2:05:38] going to stand on god's word i'm not
[2:05:41] leaving this world 30 minutes before god
[2:05:43] calls me
[2:05:45] no cancer no covet no accident no heart
[2:05:49] attack it's going to take me out of this
[2:05:51] life one minute before he calls me
[2:05:55] you tell him i'm not going to serve a
[2:05:57] god now this is bold no no you better
[2:05:59] let me do this
[2:06:02] i've told him this before lord i could
[2:06:05] not serve a god who created an enemy to
[2:06:08] be more powerful than he is
[2:06:12] it's quiet
[2:06:14] the prophet taught us he's just a tool
[2:06:18] that enemy is just a tool
[2:06:20] in the hand of god to bring the saints
[2:06:21] to perfection
[2:06:23] which is the fullness of faith
[2:06:28] gets a little sticky don't it
[2:06:30] let's keep pressing through it
[2:06:32] the enemy's defeated
[2:06:34] he'll tell you all kinds of tales if you
[2:06:36] listen he'll tempt you yes paul said we
[2:06:38] had to die daily what is that death i
[2:06:41] thought he died for us that's not the
[2:06:43] death we're talking about
[2:06:45] that's the truth that's making a choice
[2:06:48] i'm choosing every day to let what i
[2:06:51] want die
[2:06:53] and let his will
[2:06:55] live and prevail somebody said but i
[2:06:57] don't know his will you will always find
[2:06:59] his will in his word
[2:07:03] you don't find his will and a gift if
[2:07:05] there is a gift you must bring that gift
[2:07:08] back to the word
[2:07:10] if there's a dream the dream comes back
[2:07:13] to the word if there's a vision the
[2:07:15] vision comes back to the word if there's
[2:07:17] a prophecy the prophecy comes back to
[2:07:20] the word the word is the absolute
[2:07:22] it keeps us on the right path oh yes and
[2:07:26] if we say we sin and have no sin
[2:07:28] then the bible says we make god to lie
[2:07:30] and we could not do that so we sin daily
[2:07:33] that's unbelief we make the wrong choice
[2:07:35] we have to catch ourselves but it's
[2:07:37] grace god's
[2:07:38] grace that saves us
[2:07:41] and if and as we confess our wrongs god
[2:07:44] is just to forgive them and your can you
[2:07:47] listen to the holy ghost
[2:07:50] some of you might not need to be
[2:07:51] drinking coca-cola
[2:08:00] you heard the healthy friends didn't you
[2:08:01] amen
[2:08:03] i heard mimi
[2:08:06] amen
[2:08:07] i can just about tell you right now you
[2:08:09] don't need to
[2:08:12] you listen you listen to the voice of
[2:08:14] the spirit of god in you he'll he'll
[2:08:16] quicken you like i preached last sunday
[2:08:18] there are things the spirit of god will
[2:08:19] correct you on you need to do it you
[2:08:21] need to obey him you need to hear his
[2:08:24] voice and you don't need to look around
[2:08:26] to see what somebody else is doing about
[2:08:27] it you need to be obedient
[2:08:32] i don't want to hear no more but so and
[2:08:34] so does
[2:08:38] you're not so-and-so
[2:08:40] you're god's chosen
[2:08:42] he didn't call you to live by somebody
[2:08:43] else's standard he called you to live by
[2:08:46] the word
[2:08:47] so you listen to him and all those
[2:08:48] little things that god will talk to you
[2:08:50] about your life but i want to tell you
[2:08:52] something you're going to have a
[2:08:53] full-time job
[2:08:54] making the right choice
[2:08:56] to choose faith every time to choose the
[2:08:59] word every time because he's going to
[2:09:01] come
[2:09:03] he's going to come he'll tell you
[2:09:04] nobody's going to know
[2:09:09] he'll tempt you to click on something
[2:09:12] and tell you that nobody's going to know
[2:09:14] and he'll tell you because you know how
[2:09:16] to erase your history you've got it
[2:09:18] whipped
[2:09:19] but that's not deliverance
[2:09:21] that's what adam was trying to do
[2:09:24] he was trying to hide from a god that
[2:09:25] was not coming to try to kill him and
[2:09:27] destroy him he was coming to try to give
[2:09:28] him something to cover up his nakedness
[2:09:30] with
[2:09:31] your god walked as a man
[2:09:34] and the word was with god and the word
[2:09:35] was god and the word became flesh and
[2:09:37] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[2:09:39] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[2:09:41] father full of grace and truth he knows
[2:09:43] what it means to live in a body all men
[2:09:46] are tempted as we are yet
[2:09:48] without sin though he were son yet he
[2:09:50] learned obedience by the things he
[2:09:52] suffered
[2:09:53] he understands
[2:09:55] let me tell this church and those
[2:09:57] streaming this service today you serve a
[2:09:59] god who understands your struggle
[2:10:04] don't you run to the bush to hide when
[2:10:06] you recognize you've made a bad choice
[2:10:09] run to the cross run to christ
[2:10:12] run to the altar and it doesn't have to
[2:10:15] be a piece of wood up in the front of
[2:10:16] the church you build an altar here don't
[2:10:19] you wait to revival
[2:10:22] you make peace with god you cooperate
[2:10:25] with that grace of god as we confess our
[2:10:27] wrongs god is just to forgive them and
[2:10:29] your confession as long as it holds good
[2:10:32] your salvation is perfect
[2:10:35] same as it is with divine healing it's
[2:10:37] your personal faith in a resurrected
[2:10:39] lord jesus how many of you have personal
[2:10:41] faith
[2:10:42] can i read another one thank you
[2:10:44] i'm hurrying i really am
[2:10:46] it's 105. i got an hour
[2:10:50] abraham's seed paragraph 17. now jesus
[2:10:53] said
[2:10:54] and we wouldn't argue with him
[2:10:56] jesus said no man can come to me except
[2:10:58] my father draws him first then it was
[2:11:01] god knocking at your heart not you
[2:11:03] seeking god it was god seeking you
[2:11:06] so you see the covenant is to you also
[2:11:09] a grace covenant because it's god's
[2:11:12] grace
[2:11:13] calling you
[2:11:14] see you never chose him
[2:11:18] he chose you
[2:11:24] somebody said now is that really
[2:11:25] accurate oh yes
[2:11:27] he saw your choice
[2:11:31] you never chose him he chose you
[2:11:34] somebody said well how does that fit how
[2:11:35] does that work it works
[2:11:37] like this you chose him
[2:11:40] you were able by grace to choose him
[2:11:42] because you were chosen
[2:11:45] somebody said well that sounds a little
[2:11:47] bit like calvinism to me
[2:11:49] well i want you to know something don't
[2:11:52] ever get this picture in your mind that
[2:11:54] god lined up humanity
[2:11:56] and go went down the you can you can't
[2:11:58] you can you can't you can you can't that
[2:12:00] is not predestination by election
[2:12:03] well that was man's effort to try to
[2:12:05] understand
[2:12:06] the conflict
[2:12:08] but this was god knowing before you ever
[2:12:11] came into this earth your life your
[2:12:14] choice and by that he made a way for you
[2:12:19] now because you couldn't save yourself
[2:12:22] what did it
[2:12:23] your choice or his
[2:12:25] it was his
[2:12:27] if you could have saved yourself
[2:12:30] your choice could have been where your
[2:12:32] salvation was but since you and i
[2:12:34] couldn't save ourselves
[2:12:37] if he hadn't chose us
[2:12:39] we could have never chose him
[2:12:41] does that help anybody
[2:12:43] he said you never chose him he chose you
[2:12:45] out of the millions in the world today
[2:12:47] he reached down and shows you because he
[2:12:50] put your name on the lamb's book of life
[2:12:52] before the foundation of the world i
[2:12:54] believe that i'm not going to back up on
[2:12:56] that one he said that's what the bible
[2:12:58] said before there was a world jesus was
[2:13:00] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[2:13:02] the world because when god speaks
[2:13:04] anything
[2:13:05] it's so perfect it has to be to take and
[2:13:09] place and it's as good as done when god
[2:13:12] speaks it
[2:13:14] [Music]
[2:13:15] lord i believe when you speak it it's
[2:13:17] done
[2:13:18] it's finished i believe that with all my
[2:13:19] heart titus 3 7 can you show that to us
[2:13:22] i'll do this verse and one more quote
[2:13:24] and we're going to let you go for the
[2:13:26] day
[2:13:27] titus 3 7 that being justified that
[2:13:29] being justified how by his grace
[2:13:36] we should be made heirs
[2:13:39] according to the hope of eternal
[2:13:43] life
[2:13:45] being justified by his grace if you're
[2:13:48] looking for it in your bible titus 3 7
[2:13:51] that being justified by his grace we
[2:13:54] should be made heirs according to the
[2:13:56] hope of eternal life
[2:13:58] in the message hebrews chapter 2
[2:14:01] paragraph 172
[2:14:04] he said man always feared death
[2:14:08] christ
[2:14:09] became
[2:14:10] sin made low
[2:14:13] to take death upon himself
[2:14:16] and he's not ashamed to be called our
[2:14:18] brother
[2:14:19] for he was tempted
[2:14:21] just like we
[2:14:24] are
[2:14:25] tempted
[2:14:28] you know i never heard this i never
[2:14:30] heard this growing up
[2:14:34] it was always in the bible
[2:14:36] i never heard a preacher i never heard
[2:14:38] it preached
[2:14:40] that christ was tempted in all manner as
[2:14:42] we are yet without sin
[2:14:44] because the the church couldn't
[2:14:46] reconcile their concept of him and what
[2:14:50] the bible said about him
[2:14:53] they didn't want anybody thinking that
[2:14:56] he could have been tempted
[2:14:58] in the same manner than a mortal man
[2:14:59] here on the earth could be tempted
[2:15:01] because they thought that would that
[2:15:03] would take him down that would that
[2:15:04] would cause him to look lower than the
[2:15:06] deity that he was they didn't understand
[2:15:08] the divine connection between god man
[2:15:12] they didn't understand that this was the
[2:15:14] word but the word chose
[2:15:17] god himself chose to condescend he chose
[2:15:19] the body that he lived in
[2:15:21] and it was a body of flesh and in that
[2:15:23] body he was tempted in all manner as we
[2:15:25] are yet without sin
[2:15:27] some people today still struggle with
[2:15:29] the idea you mean that christ
[2:15:34] god living in a man and that man could
[2:15:36] have struggled with what you and i
[2:15:38] struggle with if he could not have then
[2:15:40] we don't have a high priest
[2:15:45] he was created thus
[2:15:47] that his mind could operate in this
[2:15:50] earthly body that he was given it could
[2:15:52] operate like your mind operates
[2:15:55] and it could drift
[2:15:58] yet without sin
[2:16:01] he was tempted in all manners we are yet
[2:16:02] without sin for he was tempted just like
[2:16:05] we are tempted let's go on
[2:16:08] and he and he can be the right kind of
[2:16:11] an intercessor
[2:16:12] because he stood the same kind of a
[2:16:14] temptation that you stand and he took
[2:16:16] your place knowing that you couldn't
[2:16:18] take it yourself i think everybody ought
[2:16:20] to like that
[2:16:22] he took my place
[2:16:25] he took my place
[2:16:27] he took my place
[2:16:29] so don't you see brother sister
[2:16:32] the whole thing is what
[2:16:35] grace
[2:16:39] do you know grace
[2:16:42] grace who
[2:16:44] amazing grace
[2:16:48] the whole thing is grace all of it is
[2:16:50] grace it's not what you do anyhow it's
[2:16:52] what he's already done for you it's not
[2:16:54] on you brother
[2:16:56] now you can't do one thing to merit your
[2:16:58] salvation i know this just oh does this
[2:17:00] ever just go against the grain of all of
[2:17:03] us who have tried so hard to earn his
[2:17:05] salvation
[2:17:06] all of us who spent so many years of our
[2:17:08] life trying to make ourselves good
[2:17:09] enough and we just never to feel never
[2:17:12] ever could feel
[2:17:15] many of us were tormented in our minds i
[2:17:18] told you i would call my granny and she
[2:17:20] wouldn't answer the phone and fear would
[2:17:21] strike my heart i've missed it
[2:17:24] because i had no peace
[2:17:27] i did not understand what had been done
[2:17:29] i didn't know what i had done i i didn't
[2:17:31] have some big reason why i thought i
[2:17:33] missed it i just figured if she was gone
[2:17:35] she was gone
[2:17:39] i had more confidence in her walk with
[2:17:41] god than i had with my own evidently
[2:17:44] i had a lot to unlearn
[2:17:47] so that i could learn of him
[2:17:49] there may be some still struggling
[2:17:51] but i can just help you this morning by
[2:17:53] telling her this afternoon now i can
[2:17:55] just help you to tell you that on your
[2:17:57] best day you didn't deserve what you got
[2:18:03] you can follow all the rules
[2:18:06] and not deserve him
[2:18:08] the whole thing is grace all of it is
[2:18:09] grace it's not what you do it's what
[2:18:11] he's already done for you now you can't
[2:18:14] do one thing to merit your salvation
[2:18:15] your salvation is a gift christ became
[2:18:18] sin that you might become righteous
[2:18:22] don't you think for one minute that that
[2:18:25] grace gives you a license to choose what
[2:18:28] you want
[2:18:31] the grace that god gives us does not
[2:18:34] give us liberty to choose sin
[2:18:37] to choose unbelief
[2:18:40] to choose a life that points people away
[2:18:43] from the cross
[2:18:45] that grace gives us victory to live a
[2:18:48] life that reflects the character of
[2:18:50] christ and what he has done on our
[2:18:52] behalf now you can't do one thing to
[2:18:54] merit your salvation your salvation is a
[2:18:56] gift christ became sin that you might
[2:18:58] become righteous read on
[2:19:00] and he's the right kind of a chief
[2:19:02] captain for our salvation because he
[2:19:05] suffered just like we've suffered he's
[2:19:07] been tempted just like we're tempted and
[2:19:09] he's not ashamed to be called our
[2:19:11] brother because he knows what we go
[2:19:13] through with oh
[2:19:15] blessed be his name for verily he took
[2:19:17] not on him the form of angels but he
[2:19:20] took on him
[2:19:21] the seed of abraham
[2:19:24] oh my he didn't become an angel he
[2:19:27] became the seed of abraham and we being
[2:19:29] dead in christ take on abraham's seed
[2:19:32] and her heirs according to the promise
[2:19:35] see he never took on the form of an
[2:19:37] angel he never become an angel he became
[2:19:40] a man
[2:19:41] he become the seed of abraham and took
[2:19:43] the sting of death in his own flesh to
[2:19:46] reconcile us back to god and now sets
[2:19:49] there for an intercessor bye this is a
[2:19:52] great question my how could we reject it
[2:19:56] friend
[2:19:58] how could anybody reject the gift
[2:20:00] that he has given to us the musicians
[2:20:03] are coming
[2:20:05] this is not a license you must
[2:20:07] understand
[2:20:09] it is not a license
[2:20:11] i woke up this morning the scripture
[2:20:13] rolling over in my mind
[2:20:15] love not the world
[2:20:20] neither the things that are in the world
[2:20:22] or of the world
[2:20:24] because if you love this world
[2:20:27] there's an enmity
[2:20:29] there there is a warfare there is a
[2:20:32] strife that goes on because you cannot
[2:20:35] love god with your whole heart and love
[2:20:37] this world too
[2:20:39] is that right
[2:20:41] so what do i do if i find myself in that
[2:20:43] position you get a hold of grace
[2:20:46] you find where she lives
[2:20:49] and i say she only as the analogy
[2:20:52] for d.l moody
[2:20:55] asking he got to studying on that grace
[2:20:57] of god and he ran out in the street
[2:20:59] found the first person he came to he
[2:21:00] said hey do you know grace
[2:21:02] grace who amazing grace
[2:21:10] it's not something you go find somewhere
[2:21:13] it's something that's living in you by
[2:21:14] the power of the holy ghost how many of
[2:21:16] you are thankful for it let's sing

[2:26:30] i know i'm his child
[2:26:33] but i don't have peace
[2:26:35] how many of you know if

[2:26:47] no shame in in in having a disturbance

[2:26:57] troubled you just have no peace right
[2:26:59] now you you need the lord
[2:27:01] you need the spirit of grace to just
[2:27:03] break forth in your life and you're

[2:28:13] just going to agree with you
[2:28:16] that god give you peace i don't believe
[2:28:17] it's the will of god for his children

[2:30:05] we're coming to say i've been there
[2:30:07] i know what it's like to have your peace
[2:30:09] disturbed and i want to join my faith

[2:30:14] can reach your hand this way and you can
[2:30:16] reach your faith this way toward the
[2:30:18] brothers and the sisters and let us
[2:30:20] believe right now that faith will rise
[2:30:22] up
[2:30:24] and overcome any doubt that the enemy
[2:30:26] might be trying to send
[2:30:28] we know the one who comes to disturb
[2:30:31] peace but lord we also know the one that
[2:30:33] comes to speak peace
[2:30:36] so we're praying right now let's do it
[2:30:38] together father in the name of the lord
[2:30:40] jesus christ these are our brothers and
[2:30:42] sisters
[2:30:44] the ground is level at the foot of the
[2:30:46] cross and there are no no big eyes and
[2:30:49] little yous there are no big saints and
[2:30:51] little saints we come today lord knowing
[2:30:55] that you love each and every one of us
[2:30:57] the same
[2:30:58] and you have called us to be overcomers
[2:31:02] and these precious brothers and sisters
[2:31:04] have said that the enemy is oppressing
[2:31:06] them in some way and causing their peace
[2:31:09] to escape them and causing a disturbance
[2:31:12] in their inner being and we're not
[2:31:14] surprised because that's the enemy and
[2:31:16] he's always on the job
[2:31:19] but we know today that we have something
[2:31:21] that we can do about that
[2:31:24] you have redeemed us by the blood of the
[2:31:26] lamb and these children of god that are
[2:31:30] standing before the altar today i
[2:31:32] personally know they have been to
[2:31:34] calvary i know they have called on the
[2:31:37] blood of the lamb i know they've been
[2:31:39] washed
[2:31:41] i know they have received full salvation
[2:31:45] and so now lord because the spirit of
[2:31:48] god dwells in them
[2:31:50] i'm asking you right now
[2:31:52] to give them strength to push doubt out
[2:31:54] of the way
[2:31:56] to push the enemy back into his place
[2:31:59] to decree in faith greater is he that is
[2:32:04] in me than he that is in the world

[2:32:10] the lord jesus christ
[2:32:12] we take authority over his evil hand
[2:32:17] lord we pray for ian right now

[2:46:19] we're going to dismiss you this morning
[2:46:21] sister did you have something i'm sorry
[2:46:23] i remembered and then i forgot
[2:46:34] of
[2:46:37] to go get the course
[2:46:38] and then she has fear that she doesn't
[2:46:40] need to get the shot so there's a lot of
[2:46:42] wavering in here sure
[2:46:44] if she knew that you prayed for her
[2:46:46] oh well then i'm glad to do it
[2:46:48] how many of you will help me pray for
[2:46:50] sister sharon's mother that the lord
[2:46:52] will give her peace she's going through
[2:46:54] a lot in her body and we just want to
[2:46:57] believe god to speak to all that fear
[2:46:59] and just give her peace and direction
[2:47:01] lord
[2:47:02] in the name of jesus
[2:47:04] lord you see this mother this elderly
[2:47:06] mother
[2:47:08] and lord you see her heart to bless
[2:47:10] other people
[2:47:11] and you know lord everything that goes
[2:47:14] on in her mind in her life and you know
[2:47:16] how the enemy would try to hinder her in
[2:47:19] any way because he hinders us all it's
[2:47:21] just it's his work it seems but lord i
[2:47:24] know that you're peace and i know you're
[2:47:26] the peace speaker and i know that you
[2:47:29] can direct her footsteps you can lead
[2:47:31] her
[2:47:32] you can help her to know what you would
[2:47:34] have her to do
[2:47:36] most of all lord you can speak a word
[2:47:39] and drive the very root of that fear to
[2:47:42] the surface and out of her life for the
[2:47:46] glory of god lord you can anoint her
[2:47:49] faith in such a way that she will no
[2:47:52] longer agree with fear but that faith
[2:47:56] would come out of her mouth because
[2:47:59] faith is settling every issue lord jesus
[2:48:03] we ask you to surround her right now in
[2:48:06] this hour
[2:48:07] cover her with your grace
[2:48:11] oh jesus let there be peace of mind and
[2:48:14] heart no matter what happens around her
[2:48:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:48:21] amen
[2:48:28] we want to pray for those yes
[2:48:30] who are in the path of the hurricane
[2:48:33] you know how i feel about those things
[2:48:35] we get uh notes from all over the world
[2:48:38] people asking us to pray against it to
[2:48:41] speak to it to tell it what to do
[2:48:44] but what i believe is that god is a god
[2:48:46] of the whirlwind name the prophet said
[2:48:48] he was
[2:48:49] and i believe god speaks
[2:48:52] and i believe what we should pray is
[2:48:54] lord watch over and protect innocent
[2:48:57] life
[2:48:59] thy will be done on earth even as it is
[2:49:02] in heaven
[2:49:04] i know some of you have loved ones in
[2:49:06] the way of that storm may we pray that
[2:49:08] god will cause them to run to him for
[2:49:11] safety come on
[2:49:13] he's the only storm shelter i know of
[2:49:15] that you can hide and be safe
[2:49:18] he's the only answer for all of these
[2:49:20] things
[2:49:21] if that unction of the lord should come
[2:49:23] on you you pray how the spirit of god
[2:49:25] leads you but sister kathy's asking us
[2:49:27] to pray for those who are in the path of
[2:49:29] that storm
[2:49:31] and we don't know what shifting it might
[2:49:33] make
[2:49:34] but we know that god is able would you
[2:49:35] just come into agreement with me right
[2:49:37] now lord
[2:49:39] we saw the devastation
[2:49:42] and the lives that were never quite the
[2:49:45] same
[2:49:47] because of storms like katrina
[2:49:50] and now lord we know that there's a
[2:49:53] storm once again in the gulf
[2:49:56] seems that it is increasing and heading
[2:49:58] toward louisiana
[2:50:00] mississippi
[2:50:02] and unless that thing would shift it
[2:50:04] looks like that
[2:50:05] we would maybe miss the impact of this
[2:50:08] one
[2:50:09] rain and wind maybe
[2:50:11] but that thing is projected to move all
[2:50:13] the way up to tennessee
[2:50:15] and lord we just know that you are
[2:50:18] sovereign in all things
[2:50:21] but what we like to do is what you
[2:50:24] taught us to do
[2:50:26] thy will be done on earth even as it is
[2:50:31] in heaven
[2:50:34] may people call on you may they look to
[2:50:38] you
[2:50:40] may they find strength to do the right
[2:50:43] thing
[2:50:44] may they use wisdom in dealing with
[2:50:47] something as fierce as a storm like this
[2:50:51] we pray for your bride who may be
[2:50:54] scattered in those areas
[2:50:57] that they would find shelter in you
[2:51:02] underneath are the everlasting arms
[2:51:05] you're there to hold them up
[2:51:07] and the name of the lord is a strong
[2:51:10] tower and the righteous run into it and
[2:51:12] are saved
[2:51:13] lord as we prepare to go today we thank
[2:51:16] you that you're going with us
[2:51:19] to keep us
[2:51:20] to deal with our hearts lord bless every
[2:51:23] person who's been a part of this service
[2:51:25] bless them for their efforts
[2:51:28] and give us grace to come back together
[2:51:30] again
[2:51:31] hold in your name
[2:51:33] in the name above every name the name of
[2:51:35] the lord jesus christ we pray amen
