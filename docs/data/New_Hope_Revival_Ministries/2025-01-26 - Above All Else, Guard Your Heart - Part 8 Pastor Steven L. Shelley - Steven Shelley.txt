that I think we need a snow day more often because I knew when I came out of the washroom and could hear the singing this morning I could hear you not just the microphone I could hear you as a congregation singing the old hymn we started with you were singing and I could hear your voice and I could feel it I like to have my my feeler working I'm not living by feelings folks but it's all right to feel him there's no crime to feel the presence of the Lord and I would be worried about me if I couldn't feel him I'd be very concerned because I appreciate knowing he's in the house he's in the house he wants to help us if you want to be helped amen you may be seated just a moment give me that key you were singing lighthouse in everybody that lives around us says now why don't you tear that old light house down oh the big ships don't sail this way anymore there ain't no use in that old thing hanging around oh but then my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time I saw the light it was the light from that Old Lighthouse the one that stands up there on a hill the verse again the verse again everybody that lives around us says why don't you tear that old Li house down you know the big ships they don't sail this way anymore there ain't no use in that old thing standing around listen now but then my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time I saw the light it was the light from that Old ligh House the one that stands on cou seal and I thank I don't hear you [Music] yet King Jesus is he is the liouse and from them old rocks of sin woo he has shown a light around me is that your testimony that I might clearly see oh if it wasn't for that Old Lighthouse tell me where would this I want you to listen one more time I'm inspired [Music] everybody that lives around us can you imagine they said why don't you tear that Old Lighthouse down it's not popular oldtime religion you know the big ships they don't sell this way anymore there just ain't no use in that old thing hanging around oh but in my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time thank God I Saw The Light it was the light from that Old Lighthouse the one that stands on Cal H and I thank God for L I owe him everything I owe him everything for Jesus woo glory glory to God and oh he has he has sh the light his light around me so that I can clearly see oh and if it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me where isn't that a good question this morning tell me where would this ship be Lord I don't even know I'm not even sure I'm not even sure today where I would be he didn't just do it once he didn't just send the light once but he sent a light more than once for me Hallelujah he'll do it even now if you find yourself tossed against the Rocks I want you to know there's still alive Hallelujah just a minute hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah they're still alive Jesus said I am the light of the world and he still is hallelujah there is no darkness in him no shadow of turning he's forever more the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I didn't sing that because Kade was wasn't doing a wonderful job he's do he did a marvelous job it was so good it inspired me and I will I almost grabbed the mic I saw it laying there almost grabbed it and just sung it with him but that verse gets me sometime because it's just the way it is you know they're they're they have to work hard to protect the I like lighthouses anyway I love them I think they're one of the most interesting things I'd rather see that sometime than than a civil war statue or something you know and I was standing in Cape hatus and uh watch that Lighthouse before they moved it can you imagine they picked it up and moved it it's the famous one the black and white Lighthouse C hatus North Carolina and I was standing there thinking wonder how many lives that light saved wonder how many ships got lost in a storm depended on that light to keep them from hitting the Rocks because if you know anything about that Outer Banks of North Carolina you know it's kind of Dangerous Waters out there and I'm so thankful for that analogy that a light comes shining across the fo and rescued us that's why we serve the Lord today folks if we lose our sight of how he found us we've really missed it you can get your Revelations and your your high and haughty Revelation you can get all that and miss the Simplicity of the Gospel amen we've been introduced to Jesus Christ he's been raised a generation ago out of the pages of history and he stood alive and well doing the same things that he did when he lived in his Earthly body that same Jesus that lived in William brandham lives in me and he lives in you and we've got to keep our eyes on him he's the lighthouse if you're already bored you're not going to last very long in this service but I'm stirred I'm just inspired I'm just stirred I'm thankful that I'm a Christian I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the only Christian baptism everything else is off the word and I've been Sanctified what a word what an oldfashioned word the old timers used to stand up and say I thank God I'm saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost you wouldn't hear that anymore not in most places but I'm glad that he Sanctified me and he filled me with the Holy Ghost and like they used to say the walking talking Holy Ghost th this age has not uh uh given the Holy Ghost laryngitis or taken his voice he still speaks in the heart of the believer and you know you don't need a prophecy it's good if God will give you one but you don't have to have that he spoke to us in the volume of the book it's there he spoke to us in his word and then went to amazing amazing lengths to preserve that word for us to have it today and then he gave us understanding of that word praise God and our absolute is not our understanding our absolute is the foundation of the word if that's not enough for you I don't know what to say to you because the Bible said the very Church of Jesus Christ is laid on the foundation of the Apostles plural and the prophets plural and when he said that he's talking about those who wrote the scripture I know that but I want you to know he is not a handicapped or or freak God he still has a fivefold Ministry he doesn't start it to lose it well praise God thank you musicians let's give them a hand Hallelujah [Applause] thank you for your prayers I need a little more in the in the monitor just a tad thank you for your prayers for us God was good we we had some snow on Sunday and uh coming down pretty hard there but God gave us the practice there that we needed for here because when I left here Tuesday afternoon uh going home after coming home on Monday evening I came I had to come to work on Monday and when I was leaving it was snowing Harder Faster than it was in Tennessee when we were there on Sunday and it was I I don't think I've ever said this but it was beautiful when I see snow I usually think mess sloppy wet soupy mashed potatoes and gravy mess CU when it starts melting and the dirt runs in it I think it is it looks more like KFC than it does Beauty but there was something beautiful about it Jonathan the only other beautiful snow I've ever seen is in the Holy Land being there when it snows in Jerusalem and hearing the mind of the Lord saying uh I'm purifying I'm sending uh a reminder that though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be quier than snow how many of you saw the video footage that RJ uh posted let me see your hand if you watched it I want to see your hand there's quite a few of you that didn't see it I think we ought to even though he's not able to be here this morning I think we ought to congratulate and thank him for for that [Applause] presentation take a little time to watch it because it's not only just beautiful Drone footage of this property but it's also a prophetic message from scripture to us in this hour and it was so beautiful and uh I just the minute I saw it I kept can I share it can I share it will you share it can somebody share it because I I know that sometimes uh RJ s sort of private about things that I didn't know if he made it for for me he sent it to me or if he made it for the but I just was going to I already got my arguments ready and I was going to talk him into it and the next morning I saw that it was posted and I was so blessed by that it really blessed me God's given us a beautiful place here and you just beautified it before you leave be sure to look out there and see the Snowman that was built here on Wednesday he's still standing now he's leaning a little but he's still standing I I I tell you he's a tough tough snowman because we've had some warm weather yesterday got up little in the low 50s and uh so thank you for praying I want you to turn to Genesis 4 my glasses are so dirty till I can't see anything and maybe that's why you were looking so beautiful to me all of a sudden maybe if I wash maybe if I clean them you're you're not going to look quite as pretty I might see more wrinkles but uh I earned mine I've told you before I didn't know I had any till sister gey told me it never occurred to me isn't it crazy how you can get and she was just talking and we were just carrying on about it and and she said I see you've got a few of their friends smile lines and that was at uh who had their be seated just a minute I got to clean my glasses and I feel relaxed and some somebody's trying to rush me and uh I've not been here I wasn't here last Sunday we didn't get together on Tuesday I don't know why you came in your hurry today just take your time get your nap this afternoon and the world will seem like a better place is that right we had wonderful Fellowship in Tennessee it was like going home to Mama it was when sister Shirley told us goodbye last Sunday afternoon we spent the afternoon in her home and I sat with her on the couch and don't tell nobody but we held hands been like a mother to me in years past and you don't forget those things and they sacrifice so many times to support my meetings and they knew that I was making everybody mad everywhere I went and so they would drive for hours just to say amen and brother Bill used to say I can preach some of them [Music] sermons from memory better than you can because I've heard you preach them so many times but God was good to us and they took us on Saturday afternoon for a wonderful meal on a beautiful farm and the snow was was there you could see snow that had fallen and it was a beautiful thing and I thought we were in a country place and we were but they told us that Dolly Parton had been there the day before for her birthday party and uh I said well I tell you I feel like a celebrity getting to come to a place like like this it was a blessing and then Sunday morning we had a a a nice number of people came out old friends some I hadn't seen in years and a wonderful move of the spirit of God I cried buckets and buckets of tears and it didn't hurt me it didn't make me less of a man and it didn't hurt me I'm waiting on you it it it won't make you less of a man it might make you more of a man because Granny said if a if a head leaks it'll never swell I just cried buckets the spirit of conviction came and God moved among us and we had a wonderful time and there were some things mended and healed and I've been getting notes all week long I'm thankful for that I have to say I I know brother gy surely did a wonderful job last Sunday I haven't heard the service yet but I had good reports and I know that it was good they're not here today because this this beef weekend and they had to go pick up their slaughtered cow and uh it was finally ready and and uh they I think it seemed like it might have been ready on the shower weekend and they could not be here for that and then they were I think maybe they told them next weekend originally and that was the fellowship meeting and so they just took the only chance they had to go and brother gy I think is is visiting today at brother bills uh Church in in Tennessee there just to be another strength and comfort to them and God blessed us with good uh travel and with safety and I told them before I left I won't give you this one one little word I told told them before we came I don't I'm paying my own way I don't want an offering I don't want gas I don't want a hotel God's been good to us the credit card is clear and I want to do this as a thank you and I love offering for for you all and uh so we got there and they had us in a place called Homewood Suites if you ever seen one of those it's a Hilton property and there's a lady that is a general manager for some of those hotels who goes to church there at Lighthouse for Jesus we had two Suites in one Suite we had two bedrooms one bedroom two king-size beds one bedroom one king-size bed and then another Suite with a king-size bed both kitchens and we stayed three nights and you know how much the bill was $178 they gave us the both suits for $58 a night plus tax so you know you just don't beat that a suite like we were in would have cost more than $178 I know you're wondering why are you taking time to share that because that was the goodness of God to me and I want to tell it because I I need him to do that again you can stand again God bless you you're faithful next weekend Fellowship meetings Saturday night 6 o'clock Sunday morning 11:00 we'll be getting a menu together for our fellowship and there are quite a few people coming I didn't know until this morning that there were as many as are coming coming some from West Virginia some who have never been here before are coming and we're thankful for that and then some from our Indiana group we don't know who all will be here but we believe God's going to do something outstanding there's something in the air I feel it I felt it this morning something is in the air

the way down to get her and bring her up here for Wyatt to have a first birthday party I was going to certainly be there and it was the most enjoyable two hours I've had in a long time it was a Pap's dream come true I got to sit on the sofa and watch a room full of children one to what they were playing with one another so pleasant and so kind and they got along every time I bragged a mother would say well you ain't been in the nursery it's not always like that in the nursery but for some reason maybe it's because I was watching over them it just blessed me I said my this is a Pap's dream come true to see all these beautiful children hasn't God been good to us oh he's been so good to us and I'm thankful for it uh I was supposed also to mention that I don't know if any I don't know if

miss anybody if it if they're on the prayer list I'm either going to lay my hand on that list and pray for uh his perfect will to to be done on Earth as it is in heaven or I'm going to read every name to the Lord you don't have to tell him all the gross and complicated details you just say Lord this one is yours and I'm believing you to move Heaven and Earth to get them what they need and I want to say before we read the scripture uh that we are so very very proud of Levi joury and and uh I didn't know if he was allowed to wear his uniform or not but sometime I sure would like for him to wear it it to service and show off that badge it's shiny and he earned it it wasn't just a complimentary gift to him he earned it and we got to go and watch him graduate on Friday from firefighter school and I said so now Levi when is your first shift he said started this morning at 8:00 and we're thankful and you live in this area he's one of our firefighters and so pay your bill pay your fire protection bill because you may need them one day oh it's quiet pay it a portion of it comes out of your property taxes if you get a bill pay it you can do it you can do it less Starbucks more protection from for your home so it don't burn down oh I feel like preaching I couldn't have been more proud to watch him he's handsome he's strong and tall and he's worked hard and he looked uh dashing maybe the first time I've ever thought of him as dashing but he looked dashing in that uniform and uh I'm just proud I know it was a lot of work and we're just very thankful for your persevering Genesis chapter 4 it's just see it's just 12:19 that didn't hurt nobody we're going to carry on we're in a series if you want to call it a series I think this would be number eight and it's called above all else we're still talking about the importance of guarding our heart and we have settled down here now for just a little while on the spirit of offense and we're still there we hadn't got started yet and I wouldn't give it so much attention had I not felt like I should and had the Lord not strongly dealt with my heart that it has been our biggest hindrance in all the years of being together with you folks since 1990 if there's been one thing that I could say by inspiration has hindered us more than anything else it's those who have carried a spirit of offense and I have to tell you that in these nearly 35 would be 35 years uh in September uh I've had one a time or two myself and so I'm not putting this on anybody but we need to hear it and if you're standing here this morning and you're still carrying that chip on your shoulder that the Bible identifies as as a spirit of offense you need to get it knocked off today you need to get that thing out of your heart out of your life out of your family out of your home and out of this church because it is absolutely necessary for offense to come Jesus said so if they didn't come we wouldn't have anything to overcome but iron isn't that what the scripture said so we're going to go back to what we covered Tuesday night was a week ago and go on Genesis CH 4: 3-8 and in process of time it came to pass that Cain Cen brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel Havel hav he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect someone say respect if you've gained the respect of the Lord you've gained something you you understand that we like to be respected respect is earned but there are times that we are resp responsible to show respect in situations where it has not been earned we're like for instance the office that someone holds the president of the United States who may not be our particular uh flavor or we may not have voted for him but it's our duty and responsibility as citizens of this nation to show respect for their office and and I'm Amazed that people can do that I'm also amazed when people refuse to do that but this is so much higher than that the Lord had respect unto havl Abel the Lord had respect unto him and and to his offering it's important to note but un Cain and to his offering he had no respect so the Lord respected Abel and his offering but to Cain he had no respect as a person and he had no respect for his offering and Cain was very rough and that doesn't mean agitated it's a little more serious than that and his countenance fell have you ever watched somebody's countenance fall one word can bring somebody out of their happy place into reality amen I don't want to be responsible all the time for doing that but sometimes as a minister uh and a pastor we have to be responsible for somebody's countenance to fall but I pray that when you get over your Wess you'll get glad again because we need the word to help us amen if thou doest well why are you wroth he goes on to say in verse six and the Lord said unto Kain why why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well sh thou not be accepted question mark and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him these are prophetic words they speak forward do you understand that and Cain talk with Abel his brother they tried to talk it over it wasn't a lack of communication that caused the altercation but came to pass which means some moments later sometime later when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and what did he do slew him he didn't just knock him down he took his life father we thank you today that you have given us this great Grace to be here and and and I hope everyone can see how glad I am to be in this house how glad I am to be in your presence how glad I am to sing your praises today Lord and I need you to come because you have certainly pressed on my heart that above all the things that we have dealt with there's a root and the root is and has always been the the the lack of delivery for the spirit of offense and it compounds like a snowball rolling down the hill but I pray that when this thing is over that there will not be one smidgen not one jot or TI of that past offense left in US you're shaking everything that can be shaken you're letting that offense rise to the surface because you're getting ready to deal with it with your sword and I want to thank you it's a two-edged sword it doesn't hang on your hip it's in your mouth and Lord we release you in every way to send that sword to deal with the root of a spirit of offense the root is always envy and jealousy dig it out Lord Jesus help us above all else to be Gardeners of our own garden our own heart Watchmen on the wall over what you've in invested in us and given to us we will praise you for an anointing that destroys yolks this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated do me this one favor if your neighbor does off gently gently shake them don't embarrass them just gently wake them because this is for them how do you know because it's for every person who has an ear to hear I want the Lord's sword to get right down to it over the course of the next few Services together now I'm not going to go through everything that we have already uh looked at and Tuesday night was a week ago I believe that was January the 14th we did some pretty good study we covered a lot of ground in one evening but I have to go back and hit just a few things before we move on and in order to do that I'd like to go to Hebrews 11 if you happen to have your Bible there uh it's nice to use it it it helps you to know like I've said before where a scripture is on the page and if you're like me you may not remember the address always but you know where it's at on the page upper right hand corner or down on and so use your Bible bring it with you don't leave it here somebody said I've got a dozen more at home well that's lovely but take it with you bring it take it and use it it's life it's life to us it's our absolute Foundation the word of God Amen and we can dig oh my we can dig if you have that desire you can get as deep as you want to get you can have deeper understanding somebody said I thought we had all the understanding we need that's wrong that's not the case we're not talking about Revelation we're talking about understanding you can you can be under Revelation and not have understanding understanding is being able to apply that if you know it but you can't use it if you know it but you can't apply it you can't appropriate it then it's not doing you maximum good is it so we want to know it by Revelation and we want to have great grace to understand it and we want to practice it I I find myself having to use it and don't be religious we're going to get to that in a minute don't be religious nobody wants religion it stinks we're not talking about oldtime religion that's a entirely different definition of the word we're talking about the kind of religion that's as the Pharisees as the Sadducees we have some in this message Pharisees jot and tit folks marking everything to the comma they'd say well you know brother Adam put a comma he didn't put a comma anywhere he's talking it's the editors that put a comma and if you don't think a comma matters just look up some of those little idioms that they post a comma matters it can really matter and so we need the discernment of the spirit to know which is the article that's being modified or you can really have a Doctrine that's outside the word and we've got some around the world of the message we've got doctrines that aren't even biblical doctrines and they just keep preaching them expounding on them over and over and over again and they're not Bas somebody say well if he said it I'm not saying he didn't say something similar but if that comma is not in the right place and you apply the whole modification of a of a half a sentence to the wrong subject you've really missed somebody said why are you talking like that technical because when you're breaking down the timeline of end time events how many of you know it's kind of important to know what comes before and so we should be very careful not to to hang everything on one little comment let's take it back to God's word let's see what it says and go forward amen Hebrews 11:4 H by faith how did he do it by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain did you know the Bible talks about giving God an excellent praise and in this reference in this context that word excellent there is talking about above and beyond one that is more than average I anybody can be mediocre in their life for Christ but I don't want to be mediocre I don't I want to serve him with everything I've got I do folks it's never necessary for overcoming virtue in the end time to just go ahead and give him everything serve him with everything you've got we can get so passionate about things we like and enjoy down here throw your passion into serving God and serve him to the uttermost give him an excellent Sacrifice by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was right righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead this is incredible the scripture in the New Testament refers to Abel as a prophet and yet we have no record of his prophetic Ministry but the Bible lets us know he is indeed a prophet and his message is continuing even until this hour Paul said it's his blood crying out come on it testifies of God's favor and it testifies of the jealousy of religion and the Envy of religion so he's still preaching to us today and so the ministry I I want to make sure you understand the effectiveness of of a Ministry doesn't just have to especially a messenger doesn't have to only be within his lifetime it can carry on praise God for that we have at least seven examples of that kind of carrying on a message a Ministry that goes beyond the lifetime of the mouthpiece and in some cases it becomes more effective because you get the star off the scene and everybody starts looking a little higher John I must decrease he must increase what did you come to see you know this is a great question what are you looking for well I'm not looking for another messenger I'm not looking for another Prophet messenger I'm not looking for another message I'm looking for Christ to be formed formed in me I'm looking for Christ to be formed in you this is the great mystery Christ in you what the hope of glory in that reference hope is expectation the expectation of Glory you may have lost your passion for eternity but eternity is getting nearer to us by the moment let me tell you whether you can hear it or not time is running out the sand is almost out of the top of the sand of The Hourglass it really is we are just a few seconds until midnight and time will be no more eternity will break upon us and there's only one thing that's going to matter as that eternity breaks upon us and that is did you have Christ how much of him did you allow to be formed in you that's going to determine the bride because here we hope and we feel and we some of us have Revelation that we're a part of that number but for many there's that nagging doubt in the back of their mind am I really one of those well let me tell you something the more of Christ you allow to be formed in you you are demonstrating What gene you are of what DNA you carry and there are some folks here this morning they may not be the loudest they they may not be the most popular but there are some folks here in this house today who I know beyond the shadow of a doubt carry the jeans seat of God it's going to matter it's going to matter because their spiritual DNA is going to kick in and give them strength to stand against the last raging storm of leoda leoda is not finished shaking its tail there's a little more to get over but I'm going over I'm going over by the help and grace of God I've told you before you you feel a little you know you don't want to testify too much of that because you don't want someone to think it's Pride I used to hear the oldtimers brother Ellas sing this old song if anybody makes it all the way home surely I will anybody ever heard that and I sat as a child on the Pew and I thought oh that's brag you you know that's bragging a little bit that that sounds a little prideful all you got to do is have a a decade of Holy Ghost life fighting Devils left and right 10 years fighting left and right and you'll be up right down right up in the middle of Flor them old Tim singing if anybody makes it all the way home surely I will shake your neighbor they're sleeping I'm serious this morning you'll be right up in the middle because you begin to realize if you don't know your own heart that heart's deceitful and if you don't know you who's going to know you but the Holy Spirit you've got to come to the place where you know who you are and by Revelation you realize that you're a part of his life and that's the only reason why you believe what you believe and stand on what you stand and may I say again today and I'll say it again as often as it comes to my heart it matters it matters what you believe sir we're not going to argue over how long past the knee it ought to be I think you ought to know that I can just say this if you sit down and you have to pull it's going to get quiet I thought i' have a little water if you have to twist and Pull and yank two things you ought to know if you've got sense that's rough huh it's not long enough and it's not big enough or you wouldn't have to Waddle it down come on and I don't have time to preach that you ought to know that you ought to get that this ain't the world some of you grew up in this is a filthy World somebody said I'm an old woman it don't matter how I do I'm an old woman ain't nobody you just don't know how sick how deprived how how Wicked this old world is you stand for God every chance you get but we don't have time to keep pounding down those kinds of things let the spirit of God uh help you and if you can hear him I'll I'll remind you from time to time but what I want you to know more than anything else is we've got to get out of here we've got to we've got to finish well it's not enough just to finish a race we've got to finish well we've got to finish his Overcomers we can't take on somebody else's battle if you're not called to a battle butt out why would you want to fight a battle that you're not called to if God has called you to punch your neighbor I mean gently why in this world would anybody want to fight a battle that's nothing to them you've heard that expression I don't have a dog in the fight if you don't have a dog in the fight you stay home that's right don't jump in and try to fight somebody else's battle unless you know the Lord has called you stand with one another stand for truth support one another but you don't have to fight somebody else's battle because here's what'll happen you will'll take on their offense and how many of you know you've got your own you working with you got your own things that hurt your feelings and offend you and worry you and trouble you and disturb you you don't have time to take on somebody else's if you want a project if you want a goal if you want something to keep you moving forward in 2025 put your eyes on Jesus see him in the mirror when you look at it when you look at this word instead of seeing your shortcomings see his Perfection I disagree with the interpretation that many people continue to beat beat beat through the years that we look there to see how wrong we are that was the law it was right that was the law that was the instruction that was the purpose of the giving of the of the law you look at the law as a mirror you see how short you are you you see your pimple you see your crooked nose you see then Grace comes and Grace changes the mirror because you're no longer seeing how ugly you are when you look in the mirror in fact if you're looking like the Apostle Paul said you're not seeing yourself at all you're seeing the Lord Jesus there and you know the Bible says we are changed this is powerful scripture we're Changed by looking upon him the more you look at him hahaa the more we look at Jesus in his word the more we see his Perfection the more like him we become my goodness so if you if you're one of those who continues to want to see your crooked nose and your you know and your droopy eye and your and your Crow feet sister V is not the only one that knows about cro on your face if you keep seeing that you how in the world will you ever have any passion or motivation to be more like him you think he's forsaken me I'm looking uglier by the minute this is not working when I look all I see is my is my bad thoughts and all I see is is my my shortcomings and all I see is my failures and and how I don't measure up but you catch a revelation of him and let him be your vision come on somebody and the Bible said we're changed from glory to glory we're transfigured is the right we're transfigured by seeing him look Upon Jesus and live brother brandom preached look away that means you may not see him if all you're doing is looking at your present circumstances and Surround Look Away to him he's ever more alive oh Hallelujah shake them come on I don't see you doing it so the next next thing will be names I'm serious this morning I didn't come here to entertain anybody I've labored before the Lord for this and I don't want you to think that you have an excuse or anyone else has an excuse well I you know I didn't hear it you can hear it by faith able thank God he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh yet prophesieth that word sacrifice there he offered a more excellent sacrifice is the Greek word thusia enthusia is an offering it's the act or the vict victim in other words it's the person offering the sacrifice or thusia can also be the sacrifice itself does that say anything to anybody the same word the same word it can either be talking about the lamb or the one who offers the lamb so when you see that word sacrifice in the New Testament it's most often thusia and it's important to know that it's talking about both the giver and the victim the one that is given why is that important to know because brother Brandon by Revelation told us it's not the Perfection of the worshipper it's not the sinless life of the worshipper it's the lamb but the scripture is in in Greek in the New Testament doesn't show any differentiation between the one giving the lamb and the lamb itself that's a revelation you are your offering Abel was his offering Abel was his sacrifice there was no difference somebody said what do you mean by that the prophet tells us that as Abel was digging away at the jugular vein of his favorite lamb anybody that's seen a severed main artery of the body knows that the blood doesn't just trickle out it pumps like a cannon every time the heart beats is that right it shoots that blood and listen Abel is wrestling around trying to take the life of a lamb that he dearly loved because he had a Revelation that it was by Blood man was going to find his ultimate reconciliation and so instead of giving him turnips and potatoes and parsnips like Cain did Abel gave him something that had blood in it Precious Blood and Abel said I'm not only going to give you the life of what I love so dearly but I'm going to take the fat and I'm going to lay that on the altar as well because the the the giving of the fat after you have given the first of the flock is to say that is my tithe and this is my offering I want to stand before God having met both of my responsibilities I've given him what he said was already his and I've taken a portion of that that could have been mine and it wasn't just talking about the blubber fat when the scripture talks about the fat thereof it's talking about not only fat but meat it's a word that is used for not only just the fat that's no good to eat but also the meat that's attached to the fat and if anybody knows anything about fat and and beef for instance W you got to have it you may trim it off or it may melt if it's marbled but if you trim it before you cook it and you take all the fat off you're not going to have the same taste it's the fat that gives it the flavor and that's how it is spiritually you give God what's his you're keeping Covenant with him you put something on top of that the fat thereof and God says wait a minute he's not only willing to trust me with what belongs to me but he's willing to trust me with a portion of what is his is that's what Abel did that was a revelation and when that jugular vein don't miss this when that jugular vein began to pump like a cannon that blood out of the Little Lamb's body it's spilled all over the one giving the offering so the sacrifice can be both the one giving and the one being given that's you and brother the brandom said Abel got covered woo he got covered in the blood of his own offering he got bathed in the blood of his own sacrifice and you and I do the same and thusia tells us that the offering the thusia the sacrifice of Abel was more excellent because it was a firstling it had blood he gave the fat thereof and in the process of its offering he became the sacrifice because the blood was dripping off of his beard somebody said that disgusts me that makes me nauseated that's that's because you're looking at blood like human blood you're looking at blood like you would look at your child who's who's hurt themselves and and you panic that's not what we're talking about oh we're talking about something beautiful I want you to know the blood that bathed able that day was beautiful blood because it was making him the offering but that does not even begin to compare with the blood that you and I have been bathed in no wonder it's not our Perfection but the one of the Lamb that we give because that blood has spilled back on us brother brandom said it couldn't be an animal for complete Redemption because it was animal life that was in that blood meaning there was no soul there was no middle ground that that animal doesn't have a middle ground does it have a personality sure it can does it have a nature sure it can can it be gentle sure it can can it be uh abrupt sure it can but it doesn't have a soul it's the middle ground so love them treat them amazing be good to your animal if you're going to have one but don't make make it a man don't make it a woman there's no middle ground it doesn't have that that life that was in that lamb could not have saved Abel under this Covenant no no no no brother bam said the life that was in that blood was animal life so it took a different kind of blood it took a special blood a blood created not just to keep an animal bleeding bleeding moaning whatever an animal does ask John Caleb or Caleb John when you see him he'll tell you what any animal in the book does he'll make the sound he'll bring it out of his toes in fact he's the most enthusiastic roaring lion I've ever met brother Luke in my life I've never met a more enthusiastic lion or tiger or bear or whatever he asked me did I want to hear his animal sounds one day and I thought oh my you know he's going to say meow but when he reached down in his toes and he started pulling up this sound it I thought I was standing in the presence of that kind of an animal but that life falling back on a worshipper would not do much for them because there's no middle ground oh but he made a blood a perfect blood come on somebody somebody thrill with me thrill with me that you've been covered no wonder lny wolf wrote it is a perfect blood it is a perfect blood Hallelujah no imperfection in it at all it's a perfect blood and it makes a Perfect Bride body and we can't lose our enthusiasm for the blood some have taken a quotation or two where brother brandom said you're not saved by the blood you're saved by grace and they have made a Doctrine oh I've been sitting for 2 and 1 half hours while they preached a doctrine that has no scriptural basis whatsoever none he said it's not the you're sa by Grace let me tell you something scripturally we know and we take it to the rest of the message where he told us it's the life of the blood but you know that was at Calvary 2,000 years ago it was actuated on planet Earth it was in the mind of God that the lamb shed his blood John was caught up to see it and Revelation chap 4 he was caught up into heaven and began to see the unfolding of what was going to happen we talked about it just here the other day we were together we talked about that but it's the reality it's the reality of it that means so much can you say amen and so without without Grace how would I get the life that was in the blood shed in the mind of God before the foundation of the world how would I get it to my house how would I get some of that blood that that he shed literal blood he shed 2,000 years ago plus on on Calvary and the chemistry of that blood fell into the Earth and I've said to you many times hundreds of times if you were to go with a knife and scrape the the Crusty dried blood if you could find it today it would do nothing for you it would become another icon it would become another plaque another something for the Catholics to worship but he couldn't save you it's not the chemistry it's the life something had to get the life to you something had to get the blood to you and that's what Grace did oh my don't you ever think that you're are saved by works come on don't be a Pharisee you're not saved by by by broadening the Hem of your Ro brother that's how the Pharisees did it they started in increasing the border of their sleeve and they started uh increasing the the Border it was a contrasting Fabric and they started making the border of their hymn in a contrasting fabric making it taller and taller so that all you needed was enough to keep the robe from from what do you call it fra fraying fraying I knew frazzle wasn't right fraying so they just saw a little border but the Pharisees oh they loved their righteousness but it was all of their own behavior and doing it was quite hyp so hypocritical it still is today my goodness you're trying to work on somebody else's life you you're trying to fix somebody else oh my we need to take a good to look at ourselves first the scripture said why are you worrying about the toothpick in your brother's eye sister Beverly's given me lots of amens why are you worried about the toothpick in your brother's eye when you've got a telephone pole in your own eye somebody said I never read that in the scripture oh yes you did you just read Mo and beam oh we who speak King James English even when we sleep and prophesy but if I ask you who's who who knows what a mode is you children you young children would say to me why it's that trench that's dug around the castle to keep the dragon out correct very few of you unless you knew it from scripture would know that a moat is just a small particle something very small and so I like to take it a little way anybody in here know what a telephone pole is anybody in here know what a toothpick is so if you've got a toothpick in your eye you ought to be concerned about that much more than concerned about somebody else if you got a telephone pole in your eye that's much bigger than a toothpick they strain it a that this is the very they strain it a that and swallow a camel don't you let religion get a hold of you Cain you know Cain knew how you know I'm finding out uh they're putting Steeples on message churches today it it blows my mind mind when I heard this message 30 plus years ago they understood that that is not a religious symbol he going to be quiet it's not a religious symbol at all it's modeled after the oblique the oblisk don't even do any research to find out what that's modeled after it's a sign of Babylon I hear somebody say well we want to be more like the other churches no you don't that's the problem the other night it was Nightfall as we were driving in to Johnson City crossing the mountain I'm telling you that's a that's a mountain in the old days we we drove through the valley on a two-lane road now we go over the top of the mountain on a highway ears popping all the way up and all the way down it was dark and we couldn't see the damage but coming out we saw the damage in Irwin Tennessee I'm telling you destroyed by a hurricane of all things 30s something miles of railroad still washed out and some of you wouldd be amazed to know that sitting right in the middle of the destruction is a trailer park mobile homes it looked like they were at least 40 years old I couldn't see a piece of metal bent on them but on the other side gone on the other side gone now somebody tell me that there's not sovereignty in God it it blows your mind you'd think that'd be the first thing to go the flood had dep part to leave those mile homes there who who who can think of such a thing as that but we're riding down on the highway now and we're coming into Johnson City and the song comes to my mind that sister y sister kette Yan the mother of the Yon brothers who sang with Louis blevens and anybody who's been around the Ministry for a long time would know the name Louis bevens and the Yan Brothers they sung amazing songs and their little mother sister cozette Yan who's been with the Lord a long time now I had the privilege of knowing her and when she played the piano she shook it her and Kade would get along just fine except she she had a little more Howard Goodman in her than Kate does she raised her wrist a whole lot higher than he does and she sung a song that she wrote I'd like to read it for you is that all right I asked brother Bill I asked brother lenel I ran into brother lenel at uh where TJ Maxx or somewhere like that and I asked him if he remembered if if the song had any verses he said he he thought it might but he just didn't remember at the time I mentioned it to brother Bill 81 years old he said oh yes and I know exactly where they are and he was able to pull them up and I want to read them to you hold your breath she wrote this song many many years ago with when Jesus name baptism was Blazing a trail through those mountains oh look out Babylon it's already offensive to the modern Church world you're getting ready to fall look out Babylon you're getting your last call you've deceived this nation long enough you've built your Steeples tall but the name of Jesus is getting higher and you're getting ready to fall I thought it didn't matter how you're baptized it matters I thought it didn't matter if God was three persons or one it matters it it the difference is between Babylon and the bride that's a wide difference come on here's the verse you've caused the people to go astray and to lose their souls in hell you've draw the People by the power of Satan and the toning of your Bell but God said in one hour your judgment would come for Mercy you'll weep and mourn and all your riches shall pass away and you'll find them no more look out Babylon you built your synagogue so fine but your money was been in vain you've spilled the blood of the saints of God and denied Our God's name you've nailed Our Savior to the Cross you've mocked and whipped him too but he's coming back with his mighty wrath to bring revenge on you oh look out Babylon you're getting ready to fall look out Babylon you're getting your last call you've deceived this nation long enough you built your Steeples tall but the name of Jesus is getting higher and you're getting ready to fall somebody ought to say something somebody ought to say something and now they're concerned about stained glass even around us stained glass we got a and a steeple because we want to look like other churches folks that Spirit of Babylon is alive and it's well and it's creeping in it's going to take a sold out number it's going to take a sold out people who don't have time to want to be petted and they don't have time to want to be rubbed and they don't have time to want to be consoled even they've got to run they've got to run somebody's got to run somebody's got to run we are running for our lives we are running from Babylon we are running back into the side of the crucified Christ we got got to get back to where we came from we've got to get back to his original thoughts concerning our life so we don't have time for some other stuff we don't have time to nurse our offenses I'm missing some amens we don't have time to give one another bottles are you saying we shouldn't be kind we got to be kind we won't want to be kind but we're not going to compromise there's a vast difference between kindness and compromise there there's such hypocrisy that tries to take a hold of people once they carry that offense then from my relatives to shack up it's fornication and adultery but for yours it's lack of funds have you seen how that works you you look over there somebody and I don't know who else to pick besides me but can I pick you so you look over there to ell we don't know anything about his family so this is all hypothetical but you look over there to Ellas and maybe he's got a relative is living with somebody they're not married to and oh my God have mercy what's wrong with them you know uh they there they must be the wrong seed there there must be no hope for them this late hour all the kinds of things that righteous self-righteous religious people who have no compassion because they have no passion for Christ and then the same thing happens in their family and you say well H I didn't know they were I I mean I didn't know they were together together I I didn't know they were Liv oh yeah they can't afford they can't afford a wedding so so so they're just doing the best can so in other words you you can make all kinds of excuses come on how did that get so big it got that big because somebody got offended and they never dealt with it and the snowball kept rolling and now it goes beyond their slackness to excusing their family slackness sir get off your phone hear the word of the Lord I'm mean it it's important to hear that it starts off she hurt my feelings and before it's over we're so far away from where we need to be right that we're having to run double time just to get back to where we used to be let me tell you something it's not the will of God God for this bride to be struggling to get back to where she was it's his will for us to be running on and in order to do that we may have to stop waiting for someone to legitimize our feelings and we may have to run on for Christ it's getting tough in here we may have to run on anyway how many of you've gotten gray hair waiting on somebody to apologize just run on anyway just run on anyway why does it matter somebody say I know it matters to God you let God worry about that run on brother run on sister run on we must we've got to we have to I'm not going to give you the rest of the definition God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh I want you to look at verse four I I should have been a mile past this 109 this is just one commentary I'm not going to give you but a couple but I have about 10 pages of examples one right after another of those who have studied the language and the continuity of scripture and understand that there's more happening in Genesis 4:4 than what we read in our English version in verse four this is a commentary I think I I I may have I may have may have given it to you after after the definitions there of sacrifice and obtain witness I may that's it well that is not it but it's coming that's not it yet let let me read what I have and we'll get to that in a moment by faith in the future Redeemer th this is this is precious precious commentary somebody said I I didn't come for commentary I want you to know we hear it every time we listen to the prophet I know there are some of you who believe that every word is thus sayith the Lord that would make brother brandom in a league of his own that would mean there was none like him not even Moses because every word Moses said wasn't thus sayith the Lord we know that by how God dealt with him come on let's be real let's just be real real no criticism no condemnation just be real real here it's very important to be real so by faith in the future Redeemer Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice the firstlings of his flock implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved and a desire in Sharing in the great atonement now what that means is by Faith by Revelation Abel looked ahead he looked ahead he's taking this Lamb's life but in his heart of hearts in the deepest part of his Spirit life there is a reality that there going to be many L this is one of many this perhaps is one of millions see it just a moment perhaps this is one of millions that are going to give their life through the dispensation of law I pray that by the same Revelation uh Abel and the New Testament seems to think that he did he looked further than the than the dispensation of Grace I mean of Law and he began to see into the dispensation of Grace and that little lamb that he was precious lamb that he was SA sacrificing and giving if by Revelation he saw that there were millions of lambs that would die under law he must have surely seen like Abraham did the day he offered was willing to offer his son Isaac Abel must have surely seen that there was a sure testimony coming up the road there was a more profound life there was a more profound and precious and perfect lamb one who would die and the Very blood that was in him would not release animal life but it would release the very Divine Life of God the very Zoe of God you have eternal life how many of you would believe I have eternal life I have eternal life through the shed blood of Jesus Christ and by Grace I have eternal life well that's God's own life it's God's own life and you now live in that life that life is now inside of you and here Abel saw it by faith Paul said by faith Hebrews 11 by faith but that word could easily be exchanged for by Revelation I think you'll hear that in a quote if you care to look it look it up it's there implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved and a desire Abel had a desire of sharing in the great atonement he was a for Forerunner of a greater atonement can you see that then Cain who who offer in testified of No Such Faith but a bare acknowledgement of God the Creator by which Faith he obtained both a righteousness and a testimony of it God this is the verse God testifying visibly that his gifts were accepted probably this is one of the original commentaries written on the scripture during the time of the early church visibly that his gifts were accepted probably probably by sending fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice you say wait a minute I didn't read that in Genesis 4 I didn't read that in Hebrews 11 here 4 or Genesis 4:4 so how could anybody make that kind of a statement here is how because of the ex explanation of what took place visibly that his gifts were accepted probably by sending a fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice a token that Justice seized listen to this that Justice seized the sacrifice instead of The Sinner who offered it if fire came down from heaven and consumed that offering that Abel had given it proved that God was not after the destruction of able his Justice wasn't falling on the one giving his Justice was falling on the one being given that's why the New Testament says and though he knew no sin he was made sin for you and I oh my praise God so that the very justice of God you might like to word use the word judgment but the reality is in the English of King James it wouldn't be judgment as often as it would have been Justice because God's fair you and I aren't Fair life isn't fair but God is fair because he doesn't move on the emotional level of fair he moves on righteous Justice and he come down and the judgment and Justice of God was executed on God in flesh our Lord Jesus Christ and the life that was spilled not only fell on his mother it not only fell on those who were standing by spiritually but it fell on the upper room it fell in Ephesus it fell on Believers from Ephesus the way to leod deia that life of the Lamb is falling on Believers even today does anybody believe that and so I I am I'm persuaded for myself that even though the English does not reflect specifically and it goes on and I won't I won't take your time because I I would be surprised if any of you would be as interested in it as I am but I spent hours and hours going through it because it so blessed my blesser as the spirit would take us from verse to verse to verse to verse and show us how God always when he was showing pleasure o on the offering he come and got it with fire can you think of some examples can you think of a fiery torch that appeared out of nowhere you know the Scriptures it appeared out of nowhere and it began to move supernaturally of a t torch of fire that nobody lit it began to move supernaturally between the pieces of the offering and God was doing that signifying that this Covenant was a covenant that not man was not making it but God was making it come on how about how about Elijah how about Elijah why they they're going to have a showdown on Mount carel you you you think it would it would take a month to preus that they're they're going through all the the the raro of religion those false prophets of baale cutting themselves can you imagine cutting themselves isn't it amazing how that same Spirit has made its appearance in these last days with mental illness they're cutting themselves to try to get the attention of their God just like those who are emotionally disturbed would sometimes do it particularly young people falling into this is is such a horrible scary thing it's it's it's like the an anorexia or some of the other kinds of disorders it's such a scary thing it can so easily take somebody's life and they would never understand that it's for attention because they withdraw but but it's a cry it's a cry and young people taking Razer blades and cutting themselves and letting and heal up just to cry for attention but folks it's not an attention that you could give them enough they need him they need Jesus to wrap his arms around them they need to know that it's not religion but this relationship come on we don't have to compromise Holiness clean living to reach him no Siri they don't even want to loose goose way they want to they want to know that it matters they want to know that it counts they want to know that if I choose Christ it matters and I'm here to tell you it matters it matters these Priests of bail they're jumping around cutting themselves shake your neighbor in love bleeding all over trying to get their God to come down there is no God Elijah jumps up and starts mocking him oh he's going on your God is going on vacation or he's like some of the Saints at New Hope he's taking a nap H and nothing nothing moves a God who can't see who can't hear who can't feel who can't know and then then Elijah he just stands up and I it's less than 60 words I can't remember it's 50-some words so we'll just say less than 60 because I can't remember exactly the number now don't count them now count them later I know you're tempted I know you're tempted but do it when you get home and text me later would you please less than 60 words he jumps up no cutting himself no screaming to his Gods no throwing himself on the Rocks hello come on he just gets up and braids this little simple prayer and guess what happens fire falls down from heaven consumes not only the sacrifice W but it licks up because remember he's had them to pour water on water on it water let's make this thing harder let's do it let's do it right let's really get her done and he fills up the trenches of water the fire comes down the old false prophet you know there's oh he's going too far this time there may be a little fire coming but it's not going to be enough for the Bible said it started it started consuming the Rocks do do you know that means that fire had to be hotter than the burning of jet fuel woo it had to be the kind of heat that took down the tower that's the kind of heat that came out of heaven and God said I'm pleased with what you're doing Elijah I could go on and on and on through the scripture Leviticus 9:24 there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces why because they knew that God had heard their prayer how did Cain know that God didn't want him his offering but he w't it able he had to see something Cain wasn't a man of Revelation he was a dense man he must have been quite dense in the head you know religious but dense he didn't figure that out on him on his own but when you've got turnips laying on your altar and your brother your twin brother over there has got his precious lamb and he he's making a bloody mess of himself and you're looking over there and you're wondering what's God going to do with these offerings and all of a sudden you see smoke begin to rise and fire beginning to fall I've got a feeling you're going to know that you're in trouble God was making a difference I'm moving on the word respect that appears in Genesis 4:4 give me just a few more minutes the word respect that appears in Genesis 4:4 it means to look at to regard to gaze at to look at anything with a keen Earnest glance which has been translated multiple times Kindle into a fire so that the Divine approval of Abel's offering was shown uh in its being consumed by fire that just came out of the out of the Lexicon the Hebrew verb that is used in Genesis 4:4 sha simply means to gaze at to have regard for to look on with favor or with devotion the text does not indicate how this was communicated but it indicates that Cain and Abel knew immediately who was received and whose was rejected would you trust John Wesley John Wesley's notes on the Bible John Wesley lived from 1703 to 1791 let me read a little more details but hold that up there would you he was an Anglican cleric and theologian who founded the Methodist movement leading a Revival within the Church of England that emphasized personal faith social reform and Holiness of heart and life through his extensive traveling preaching and writing he established a Systematic Theology that combine Evangelical enthusiasm which is evangelism with rational thought while pioneering new methods of spreading the gospel which included protracted meetings and and tent meetings and public Gatherings and campgrounds even including open air preaching and establish small group meetings for spiritual growth John Wesley I'm telling you he was a Trailblazer in in his lifetime in the early 1700s you and I know him better as the sixth Church age Messenger to the Philadelphian Church age brother brandham suggests Ed that this age lasted from approximately 1750 now notice Wesley was born in 1703 but the church age brother the brandom is is suggesting approximately that it begins in 1750 is that right yes to 1906 now he's in keeping with Clarence Lin who also wrote wrote about the the beginning year and ending year of the Philadelphian Church age and Lin said that it ended in 1900 brother brandham carried it by inspiration to 1906 because that was the transition from sanctification to Pentecost to a full baptism of the Holy Ghost at isusa street you understand that don't you now let me give you this quickly in his words and then I'm going to tell you what John Wesley said about Genesis 4:4 and and we're studying now for those of you who who will and tonight this is the Philadelphia and church age message this is not the church age book this is the sermon 1960 and tonight the church age is called the Philadelphian Church age remember that was the age before ours the age before leod deia you you understand and the star or the messenger remember John saw him Revelation one stars in his hand Seven stars the star or the messenger Angel Messenger to that age We Believe solemnly with all our heart to be John Wesley so brother brandham has a strong conviction that John Wesley was the one chosen to bring the message that was needed for the Philadelphian Church age he goes on to say the church age began in 1750 when the Lutheran Church age went out that was Martin Luther's age which was justification by faith and lasted up to somewhere in 1900 around 1906 he called that the wesleyian church age just like we might call Luther's age the Lutheran Church age although the scripture would call uh this wesleyian church age the Philadelphia Church age and then issued in from that the leodan so Philadelphia gave way for leoda how many you get that stay with me and now the age is the is the church age of that was the last Church age Brotherly Love isn't that amazing that we can't seem to master today are you are you listening yes look this way please put your phone down we we can't seem to master the emphasis of the last Church age brotherly love we got some work to do we got some running hard to do brother Ram said that was the age of Brotherly Love The Great missionary age and the open door age there was more accomplished to spread the gospel in the Philadelphia and church age under the leadership of char of John Wesley than had ever been a accomplished previously since the time of the Apostles now we can say that there has been more missionary effort gone forth in the Leo Dean Church age than any other age prior but it could also have been said about Philadelphia in the Philadelphian Church age more has been accomplished to win souls and that was under the leadership of men like John Wesley he said and the reward was a was a pillar remember I will grant to him to be a pillar in the house of my God and the revelation of three names the name of God the name of the city of God and God's new name is the Revelation that was given to this church in this age so he's clear he believed by conviction that it was John Wesley now let's move on to a message called turn on the light 1964 Stay With Me There came another time that the church should get away from its sins and be Sanctified along Came John Wesley a little Anglican man from over in England there that belonged to the Anglican church but he saw listen he saw the light on the gospel thank God it was the hour for that Philadelphian age to come forth are you here and when he did he preached what the second work of Grace a sanctification how how are we Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ by the washing of the water of the word he said there was nothing could stand in his in its light he was considered a fanatic Imagine John Wesley a fanatic just like Luther was a fanatic just like you are did you know people look at you the same way sometime you're just fanatic you drive P you drive past 50 churches to get over there you you you drive hours to get there you you just must be a fanatic they don't understand but protested all the rest of them shine forth a light because it was the light of the hour it was the light of the hour it was the light of the hour thank God God found a man John Wesley who could turn on the light he found a also a Luther that turned that light on or turned on the light for that age and one more the Masterpiece Jeffersonville 64 again just ification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost thank God thank God thank God it didn't end with justification because then we would just kept repeating the same kind of behavior caught in the same trap come on but he sent a word and the power of his blood to sanctify to set us apart to clean us up and then thank God it wasn't just that them good old sanctified people people of the church age before us they walked as clean as they knew how there was a remnant of them who are shouting the Praises of God in eternity who never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't particularly for their day but methodism begin to give way the wesleyian church Age begin to fade the Philadelphian Church Age begin to fade and leod deia begin to come the most evil of all the ages and yet it was in that age that God determined he would pour out the very life that was in him through the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah and it was the restoration of the Holy Ghost in 1906 isusa street I'm so thankful for it he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost Made A Way listen I'm going to start over justification made away for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again back to the word again back to the word again what was the message for leod deia back to the word again come out of Babylon and get back to the word again come back out of denominational system and get back to the word again come on come out of your Creed and back to the word come out of your confus ion of who God is and how many people and your church baptism and come back to the word it had to be this way justification first sanctification then and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost making way for the perfect word not just to be preached to us but to come and live inside of us are you here this is that perfect word living on the inside now let's listen to what John Wesley said in closing about Genesis 4:4 this is from John Wesley's notes on the Bible and the Lord God had respect to Abel and to his offering and showed his acceptance of it probably by fire from heaven but to Cain and to his offering he had not respect we are sure there was a good reason for that this difference now watch this this this wording is remember he lived in 1700s the governor of the world though an absolute Sovereign that's who he is King of Kings melik ham King of the whole universe king of all Kings he's an absolute Sovereign doth not act maybe maybe next Sunday I shall preach in Old English though an absolute Sovereign doth not act arbitrarily in dispensing his smiles and frowns it must not take much to Thrill Me I jumped up out of my chair when I read it I said in 1700 in language I have to concentrate on to understand John Wesley the messenger that God used for the Philadelphian Church age simply said this God though he's king of kings and Lord of lords the governor of the whole world he does not carelessly smile when there's nothing to smile at right and when he frowns he frowns for a reason you get it and the upon Abel he had respect for his offering but under Cain he had no respect God Smiled On Abel not because he loved Abel more than Cain but simply because Abel came with a revelation Cain came with a religious spirit you hear are you hearing me God does not arbitrarily act dispensing his smiles and frowns you read enough of that and you'll be glad to go back to Kentucky English but it means something to us a man by the name of Joseph Benson give me a moment he lived 1748 to 1821 he was a Methodist Minister he was a contemporary of John Wesley that means he lived in the same time he actually lived longer but he lived in the same time of John Wesley he was born in Cumberland England and became a Methodist at age 16 now I only left that in the note simply because he became dedicated to his faith at an early age that means something he was marked for something let's look at just a moment how he looked at Genesis 4:4 and the Lord God had respect to Abel and to his offering and showed his acceptance of it probably by fire from heaven but to Cain and his offering he had no respect none it means something now if you think that God is going to smile on you because of where you went to church or what you have on your shelf in your home you've missed it that's not the way it works he's looking at your offering I'm closing with this I really am 1952 I'm skipping I hope you can find it 1952 God's way that's been made for us I want to read this one he said now I want you to notice he found himself trying to make his way we had this morning how Cain tried to make his way there are probably people among us and people that we love and people that we know people that we work with and people that are in our family who are trying to make their way but it's not enough it's just simply not enough when someone says I'm doing the best I can the refrain from Heaven would would almost always be it's not enough because normally when we think we're doing the best we can we haven't even beg to scratch the surface if we still have more time for Netflix than we do for the word we cannot say we've tried our best if we spend more time talking about one another than we do praying I'm just preaching just doing my job if we get more excited when we're spreading some rumor about somebody than we do about the great message that God is sent to capture Us in this hour we haven't done the best we can do amen that's in love I'm telling you it's all been in love it has now I want you to notice he found something trying to make his way how Cain tried he brought down some apples and pears and peaches well nobody know and pumpkins ever what it was do you see that phrase I'm not trying to be ridiculous but do you see that phrase ever what it was do you do you understand there's no Doctrine being made here it wasn't necessarily apples and peaches and pears and pumpkins he said ever what it was he's trying to give us something as an example you you'd be surprised at the folks I know who want to make a Doctrine over something like that that's why we have to treat this message like we do everything else that God has given us we take it back to the absolute of the word don't get up and try to say if somebody said it was a cabbage bless God the prophet said it was apples pears peaches and pumpkins he said ever what it was he laid it upon the altar I don't have to say that for folks here but I have to say that for some of our other precious lovely streamers and Friends everybody was laid it on an altar and said now there Lord I built an altar I built a church but a sign on the door he could have said I'm a good church member see I go to church every day I come here built the altar I put the sacrifice upon it now I'm going to kneel down and pray and now Lord I want you to receive me somebody said just pray just build an altar just tell God you love him that's L to see in theology that's church anity that's not Bible religion that's not Bible word that that's not the truth it sounds so lovely just go to church just pay your tithe just love everybody just include everybody just be tolerant of everybody you know all churches all churches lead to God you know Oprah Winfrey religion all faiths lead to Heaven you're going to be shocked you're you're going to be shocked I I doubt doubt there's very many in this room that have ever been to a funeral where the preacher just honestly got up and said I have no idea I've done it twice I have no idea I would love to stand here and tell you that he made a end that he called on the Lord but since I don't know whether he did or not I have to tell you the brutal truth you may or may not see her you may or may not see him but you've got to make it the reality is if you get there and he didn't you get there and she didn't you'll never even be concerned about their absence if you think that heaven is going to be a bunch of granny's sitting in rocking chairs crying because they had grandchildren or children that didn't make it that sounds like the church it doesn't sound like the word Granny's going to run if granny makes it she's running all over Heaven Hallelujah huah Hallelujah she don't have time somebody said well I thought you said sometime they're interceding for their loved ones they are but they don't always know the brutal reality because if they did that wouldn't be Heaven would it how could anybody enjoy that place that the redeemed are resting and waiting on us how could anybody enjoy that if they were overly worried and concerned and torn and broken over over their own family and the way they're doing and how could anyone live in eternity worshiping the Lord and being happy knowing that they had a child on Earth that didn't make it a grandchild that didn't make it listen folks families are going to be separated and everybody that that is born to a woman is not going to be given eternal life just because they ran the race that is that is woke 2025 Society you don't have to win the race you just run the race and you get the ribbon anyway way that's not God's race the ribbon doesn't go the prize doesn't go to the participant the prize goes to every person that runs over the line somebody said you mean not just the first one doesn't matter the order God's not looking to see who comes first he's just looking for you to go all the way that's right tell yourself right now with God's help I've got to go all the way I don't want to be political here but I heard uh Pete say this week our our new secretary of defense I heard him say yes that was the Life I Lived some of those things I did and some of those things I'm guilty of but that was the old me somebody said it's easy to say yeah you you can always say I turned over a new Leaf but I'll tell you what's not easy to say to the whole world to those those Heathen Congressman sitting there some of them atheist some of them Mormons some of them Catholic who think that it can all be taken care of by lighting a candle and praying a little prayer but to stand before them sit before them and say to all of them but because of Jesus and Jenny isn't that her name I'm I'm I am what I am today my wife it's because of the Lord Jesus Christ who saved me so they swore him into office yesterday the vice president I'm not being political he is the vice president right the hillbilly the one who as a young teenager jumped out of the automobile to save his life from his mother who was a a crazy alcoholic and drug addict one of the most beautiful pictures of redemption this is not political is the is the scene of him standing there taking the oath of office as Vice President of the United States and those women who are standing up on that platform uh uh our our first lady there is no telling how much that dress cost it it was probably in the neighborhood of your automobile I'm so thankful that she didn't look like a hoochie and she rep and she she didn't have on a pants suit but she represented herself as a lady maybe not the standard you and I appreciate but I I appreciated the fact that she looked like a lady and then one of these businessman with his poochie mama with him you know standing right up there her her chest exposed for the whole world to see what what a shame somebody ought to took a crook and stick and and took her right off the stage but there stood a mother in a simple outfit someone said it looked perhaps maybe like TJ Maxx well that's where my family dresses so that's where you and I would fit in here this where we would be we wouldn't be in melania's closet we'd be at TJ Max I got on TJ Max sock right now someone said there stood the vice president's mother his wife is standing beside him not telling the money I suppose her shoes cost more than to take every one of us out to eat today I don't begrudge her that I'm glad she had them glad she could get them if there's not even a hair of jealousy in me but then his mother was standing there in just a simple red top of I guess it was a skirt I didn't really see beneath so simple a but a work of Grace a woman who should have been dead but a curing granny told him you don't have to live live your life like ours has been lived you can make a difference so he's being sworn in Vice President of the United States his wife standing beside him and and and and his mother standing here watching on I heard her I saw her and and and heard a word from her at the convention a republican convention this year and I thought to myself how many men would would have been embarrassed and how many women like her would have been embarrassed to go and face that crowd of people with her story I haven't seen a film but a film was made a book was written a best-selling book about her rottenness you'd think she'd be hiding in the wing somewhere but she faced all of that to show a life can be changed come on come on a life can be changed and when when uh Pete Reed took the AU of office yesterday he comes to the microphone to say his word all of this is because of the Saving Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why I can stand here today oh my it was so refresh I'm not being political but it was so refreshing to me that someone could not only say the higher power I was thankful for a prayer that could actually be prayed out loud in in the name of the Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ we pray how wonderful it is to think that there is an opportunity for his grace to be magnified and his power to deliver to be magnified they may not know what you know but they're serving their purpose here on Earth may God give them strength to continue to do it Cain tried to make I've got a musicians are coming he brought apples and pears and peaches and pumpkin and I build a church I go to church every day I come here and build the alar I even buy my coffee and donuts from the church on Sunday morning I'm a I'm a full supporter and I might even get my tattoo in the back I've given money to order the smoke machines and colored lights and I'm I'm supporting the church I put a sacrifice upon it now I'm going to kneel down and pray and now Lord I want you to receive me that's Leia DEA receive me I'm I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing now Lord I want you to receive me and God said but God refused him and that same old religion Spirit don't you don't you miss this and that same old religious spirit lives right down amongst the church today if it did in 1952 it does in 2025 the very same thing just as religious as it can be and knows no more about God than the Hut and pot would know about an Egyptian Knight you know that's a truth he said religious Spirits don't think that Stalin is the Antichrist the Bible said the two Spirits would be so close together they would deceive the very elect if possible that religious spirit is alive and well today and it will give people just enough peace to ease their conviction and they'll stand in a church on Sunday morning and say God just receive me just just take me I've done all you I've done all I'm supposed to do just take me and receive me and God couldn't if he wanted to because why because he has a provided way you're going to come the provided way or you're never coming if God doesn't call you you'll never come did somebody die today and went to hell they did while you were sitting here somebody in Lee County died and guess what went to hell and it doesn't give anybody with passion or compassion pleasure to say such a thing but the reality is everybody doesn't make it everybody they may be religious they may go to church their name may be on a brick they may carry their little box of printed tithe envelopes with their name on it and they may actually give something but God has a provided way all of this happened because resentment because of Envy because of jealousy God even said to Cain I'm going to paraphrase allow me this you go check it out here's the paraphrase you didn't do so well if you'd have just done the right thing if you just bring the right offering it almost sounded like I'm just paraphrasing it almost sounded like God was saying you messed up but you you you can do better about this I'm just saying what it sounded like but instead he let a wound he he his countenance fell he got mad he got mad I got so mad his countenance fell he's so upset he tries to talk it over with Abel and Abel is just caught away in an inspiration of what God showed him perhaps he just took his arm and put around his brother and said now brother God has a provided way let let me talk to you just a little bit it had to be blood it had to be blood sin came by Blood blood original sin came by Blood covering for sin comes by the blood and eventually full Redemption comes by the blood you saw that little lamb I offered Millions just like him are going to die throughout the Covenant of of of of Torah or law or instruction millions are going to die just like that one blood's going to be shed fire just like you saw is going to fall and and and light The Altar and then one day another lamb is coming he may be sitting here just trying to talk it over with with Cain and Cain is trying to hear it but Cain is so mad don't talk to me about that can you imagine I'm so mad I can't hear all that I I've got real world problems can you imagine his rejection so all the Talking is said they talked it over in the field or they talk it over and later in the field and none of that could help Cain get over the offense and so everything that would have happened from then on the rest of those twin brothers lives would have been filtered through Cain's hurt feelings his jealousy his Envy Cain would have not have been able hear me play something softly ve very soft Cain would have never been able to cheer for Abel's children when they want to raise he would have not seen the child for the child he would have seen Cain it's a stinking image of his daddy I don't want anything to do with him come on this is what resentment does it starts off a hurt a wound a legitimate one perhaps even at times and then it starts rolling like a snowball down the hill getting larger and larger as it goes and it it filters everything Abel would have gotten the most beautiful wife and Cain would have had the leftovers that would have been Cain's outlook on the future if Cain would have continued to live and he would had a wife and his wife would have had a miscarriage what would that have done it would have just deepened the wound because he had to look over there and see Abel's Wife Carrying a child full term it gets bigger this could go on all day I could I could take this I could take this thought all day long Cain if we brought him into into today's society and I can't even pay the repair bill Cain would say I can't even pay the repair Bill to keep my jalape going down the road and every time I turn around Abel's Trad in his for a newer model everything that happened in the lives of those brothers would have been filtered through that spirit of offense and it would not have remain just between Cain and Abel because a wounded Spirit sees everybody in the wrong and connections would be made and every time Cain went to church the preacher was preaching right at him and every time Cain did this and that happened it was because of Abel and it goes on and on and on and on and you blame the wrong people at the wrong time because the reality is more painful than your fantasy if you saw the reality you would have to see your part and nobody except God's children want to see their part and so Cain did what he felt he had to do I've got to put an end to this I can't live in the shadow of Able Fire came and fell I I didn't even get a fizzle I didn't even get a whiff of smoke and it'll be that way my whole life I I'll always be the tail and not the head the only way I'll ever become the head is to kill my brother and while they were in the field he rose up in anger and and murdered his brother the first murderer because the Old Testament teaches us the difference between killing and murder he he he committed murder and guess what God still wouldn't have him God still wouldn't show him pleasure and God said no no no no no no you still won't lead you still won't be righteous before me because that thing is still in your life I'll raise up another seed I'll replace you again come on it's hard reality but I'll raise up another one I'll call his name will be Seth that's right and he'll lead a righteous line of my children because resentment never works it never wins it cannot be rewarded Envy can't be rewarded jealousy can't be rewarded you can't tiptoe around jealousy you can't temp toe around Envy you can't temp toe around offense you'll live the rest of your life like a little dog in a sideshow trying to jump through all the hoops and come on it won't work trying to please somebody that has a spirit of offense and the only remedy is to let that sword of the Lord come if it was Daddy Let The Sword come if it was mama let the sword come if it was Pastor let the sword come if it was your child your son your daughter let the sword come if it was your spouse let the sword come that offence out Let It Go but when you do it'll change a lot of things when we finally get shed rid you you all know Southern vernacular you know what I mean when I said we get shed of that get rid of that when we get rid of that it'll change the way we think and the way we live and the way we worship and the way we move among God's people people because jealousy will be gone and you'll never see it as a competition anymore one being lifted up while another one is being pulled down you'll just understand that it's just iron sharpening iron it has to happen has to come and if two can't walk together because they're not agreed let them find another place to walk but walk on for God Paul and Deus had to do it Paul and Barnabas had some the the disciples had some issues brother brandom and Gordon Lindsay had issues they had to go one go one way one or another Graham Snelling the assistant pastor at the brandom Tabernacle they had some issues he had to go one way and brother randman had to go another brother Junior Jackson didn't Embrace Church order the way brother Brandon was presenting it at the Tabernacle so he pulls away and the people were making fun of brother Jackson the T Tabernacle people making fun of them and saying you know calling them silly names because they didn't believe in the same kind of church order that brandom Tabernacle came and brother brandom rebuked them and said Why That's my brother he believes this message as much as anybody don't ever say that again that's his church it's Sovereign let them do what they will in 1965 when brother brandham died do you know what happened does anybody know what happened to the Tabernacle in 1965 those original people that had been rebuked because they made fun of brother Jackson Almost 100% of them left the Tabernacle over the course of a few months and guess where they went to Brother Junior Jackson's why does that matter it matters because one thing can shift your whole thought process when what you're holding on to is no longer there to hold on to it and that's when brother Collins and others stepped up and they wanted to make sure that not only at the Tabernacle but around the world they enforced this strong stand on how the spirit should move and how it shouldn't move and what should be done and what shouldn't be done and there was a fence that took place and brother Brandon was no longer there to pull it together and the the rift gets wider and wider folks we better let the Holy Spirit Come Today right yes let's stand I know I took more time than I should have it will never never lose its power oh it reaches to the [Music] highest mountain

said they from the scripture he found him bleeding and dying on the Jericho Road the Good Samaritan poured in the oil and he poured in the wine Lord you have found us many many times beating and bleeding on the side of the road from the hurts and Brokenness of life but like the Good Samaritan that you are you have always been there to pour in the oil and the wine and I'm asking you again today where there is a need would you pour in oil would you pour in wine would you raise us above would you give us strength and Grace to run on would you help us to turn loose of the thing that we may be holding on to father would you birth in us a new willingness and a new Grace to forgive Lord you have forgiven me you have forgiven us of so much Lord let it be easier for us to forgive to shed the experiences of life that are negative like a duck would shed water let it roll off of us as we step up into the stature of the perfect man we're making room in our life for Christ to be formed come Jesus and manifest yourself in us come and give us that hope of glory as you form yourself in us there may be those today who have never really known you by relationship they've known you by Church Association but they're hearing something that calls them to a fellowship to a relationship with you grant it to today that they would be willing to make room for you to come and take your Abode that you would sit on the throne the control tower of our life and you would be the filter you would help us to reject those things that are not of Truth and therefore are error and help us to receive the spirit of Truth into our lives oh God this bride is stepping forward in this last hour we've climbed some rough mountains we've come up some rough places but we can almost smell Victory I really believe that Overcomers are rising among us even in this hour it's for a purpose it's for a reason so Lord we just lay it we just lay it we just lay it before you right now come and see us identified with our sacrifice see us identified with the Lamb of God let the Holy Ghost and the confidence of the Lord be upon each one of us may we not move forward in self-confidence but may we move forward in the boldness and the confidence of the king of kings oh and the Lord of lords we're believing that the Joshua generation is rising up and that she will go all the way she will not not be satisfied to stay where she is Lord you promised that young people would catch the Baton and take us on many of us will have to turn loose of our thoughts and feelings and resentments to follow young people on ahead so we we just start at it now recreate Lord restore and renew oh Jesus let the reality of a and the joy of your salvation be born in us may may we begin to decree and declare in the spirit in that realm I am an overcomer I am an overcomer because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world just just put your hand if it's appropriate to do so on someone next to you maybe the one you've had to try to keep awake no offense if someone comes to you that it doesn't necessarily mean we need you Jesus somebody tell him we need you Lord we need you today we're going to need you more tomorrow we're going to need you the rest of this week you are our life source you are not our last resort you are our first resource we come to you right now and believe for your life to be poured into a strength virtue from on high poured into US healing for our sick bodies healing in the name of Jesus you Spirit of infirmity take your hands off the children of God you are a trespasser you have no right loose the people of God take your hands off of them you're about to have a lion to deal with we command that you Retreat the angel of the Lord leads the armies of the Lord may may we step forward with him H may we step forward with him in this hour bind us together with cords that cannot be broken we may see one another's faults we may continue to see one another's flaws but may we take them to the altar may we not let them cause division may we not let it be the greatest hindrance of this church may may we maybe we come to a place where we have so ultimately put that under our feet that we move on to find the other things what what other things what other things hinder we see the scripture you did run well you did run well you did run well you did run
