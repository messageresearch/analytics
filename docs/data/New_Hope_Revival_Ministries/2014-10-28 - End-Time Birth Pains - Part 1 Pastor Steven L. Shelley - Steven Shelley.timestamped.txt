[0:00] you
[0:07] you
[0:32] you
[0:50] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly from the
[0:54] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[0:56] station Alabama in the USA and I want to
[0:59] welcome you today to the Eagles cry
[1:01] broadcast it's such a wonderful
[1:04] privilege to be able to come to you in
[1:06] your home wherever you may be across the
[1:10] world we want to thank the Lord for the
[1:12] fine television Christian television
[1:15] networks that God is using in a mighty
[1:18] way to bring the gospel to the nations
[1:21] of the world and we feel so honored and
[1:24] so privileged to be able to come to you
[1:26] today through the gospel channel and
[1:29] through angel TV and we just asked that
[1:32] the Lord Jesus will come and anoint his
[1:35] word today and touch you and strengthen
[1:38] you and encourage you in your life most
[1:41] of all if you don't know the lord I pray
[1:44] that this broadcast will be mightily
[1:46] used of God to stir your heart to cause
[1:49] you to hunger after the things of God I
[1:52] think it's very important for us to
[1:54] begin to realize and recognize the hour
[1:58] in which we live I believe with every
[2:02] fiber of my being that we are living in
[2:05] the last generation I truly believe that
[2:08] the Lord Jesus Christ will soon catch
[2:11] his waiting bride away and then the
[2:15] world is going to be plunged into a time
[2:17] of great wrath such as has never been
[2:21] seen before in the history of humanity
[2:24] and there's going to be a wonderful
[2:27] marriage supper of the Lamb with the
[2:30] bridegroom Yeshua our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:32] and his bride in the realms of heaven
[2:36] and the earth is going to be purged in
[2:38] the time of the great wrath and when
[2:41] it's all done our precious Lord is
[2:44] coming back to this earth with his bride
[2:47] with the Saints of every age to
[2:49] establish his Millennial Kingdom right
[2:52] here on planet earth we talk about the
[2:56] desire for peace we want peace in the
[2:59] world not just peace in the Middle East
[3:01] but we desire peace and ever
[3:04] nation of the world will let me say to
[3:06] you that peace as we desire it will
[3:09] never be known in the world until the
[3:13] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the son of
[3:16] David comes back and establishes his
[3:19] kingdom here on the earth then there's
[3:21] going to be a thousand years of perfect
[3:25] peace we need to know in this hour that
[3:29] we have invited the Lord Jesus into our
[3:32] lives that our sins have been covered by
[3:35] the precious blood that He shed on our
[3:39] behalf to become our propitiation for
[3:42] sin he became the sacrifice he settled
[3:46] the debt sometimes we use the word
[3:49] justified to to describe our experience
[3:53] or our condition when we come to the
[3:56] Lord we are justified and I like to say
[3:59] that means just if I'd never sinned
[4:03] that's how powerful the blood of Jesus
[4:06] is he can not only take his blood and
[4:10] apply it to our lives and cover our sin
[4:13] but our sins are remitted and in the
[4:17] sight of God it is as though we have
[4:20] never sinned if you knew that you could
[4:24] have every mistake and every sin that
[4:27] you have ever committed in your life
[4:31] instantaneously wiped away never to be
[4:35] remembered anymore then what would
[4:37] prevent you from finding that remedy
[4:41] what would prevent you from desiring
[4:44] that condition I can't imagine anything
[4:46] being more important than knowing that
[4:50] your sin has been forgiven and all you
[4:53] have to do is invite the Lord Jesus
[4:56] Christ into your life repent of your
[4:59] sins and say Lord I'm sorry that I have
[5:03] transgressed your word but I thank you
[5:05] that you have paid the price you have
[5:08] settled the dead of sin forever more and
[5:11] I invite you to come with your precious
[5:14] blood and wash me
[5:16] mean though my sins were as scarlet now
[5:20] they shall be white as snow that's the
[5:24] promise of the scripture and all you
[5:26] have to do is invite him to come in and
[5:29] transform your life and then as you are
[5:32] transformed we continue to grow in the
[5:36] things of the word and in the things of
[5:38] the Spirit and that's what the Eagles
[5:40] cry broadcast is all about yes we're
[5:44] going to talk about salvation we're
[5:46] going to talk about what it means to be
[5:48] sanctified by the washing of the water
[5:50] of the word and we're going to talk
[5:53] about what it means to be baptized with
[5:55] the Holy Ghost and fire but we're not
[5:58] only going to talk about the
[6:00] foundational truths of the scripture but
[6:03] by the grace of God and by the
[6:05] revelation of the Holy Spirit it is my
[6:08] desire to take you on a journey through
[6:11] the deeper truths and spiritual
[6:14] revelations of God's Word that are
[6:17] applicable for the hour in which we live
[6:20] I believe that God has sent forth a
[6:23] message of transforming truth to prepare
[6:27] a body of people to go forth in a final
[6:32] move of the Holy Spirit that we often
[6:34] refer to as the bride's revival where
[6:37] they will go forth in the very character
[6:40] and attributes of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:43] performing the same works in the end
[6:47] time that he performed while he was
[6:50] living in his corporal body here on
[6:53] planet Earth I believe it's going to be
[6:56] a quick short work that will cause a
[6:58] final avalanche of souls a harvest of
[7:02] souls to be swept into the kingdom of
[7:05] God and you and I are being positioned
[7:08] to be used of God in unprecedented ways
[7:12] here in the end time and I believe that
[7:15] this message of truth that the Lord has
[7:17] sent to Planet Earth to help prepare a
[7:21] bride of Christ for the second coming of
[7:23] the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that
[7:25] message is what we desperately need in
[7:28] this hour
[7:29] to deliver us from complacent church
[7:33] anity into a real intimate relationship
[7:37] with our heavenly bridegroom you see
[7:40] there is an earthly bride that's being
[7:42] called out in this hour she's being
[7:45] called out of denominational creeds and
[7:48] ideas of man that are so far removed
[7:52] from the truth of the scripture that we
[7:55] can't even find a hint or a trace of
[7:59] some of the ideas that have been taught
[8:02] in this past generation concerning
[8:05] Christianity that that are really more
[8:09] akin to paganism than they have anything
[8:13] to do with the gospel of Jesus Christ
[8:15] there is an hour this is the hour that
[8:19] we're living in right now where the
[8:22] Bride of Christ is being identified
[8:24] there is a word from heaven that's being
[8:28] sent around the world in this hour and
[8:31] when you hear that word if you are
[8:34] called and elected to be part of that
[8:37] Brides revival there's something on the
[8:41] inside of you that is quickened by that
[8:43] living revelation of Jesus Christ that
[8:46] living word it it becomes alive and then
[8:51] you begin to feel that wooing and that
[8:54] pulling and that drawing of the Holy
[8:57] Spirit perhaps we could use the analogy
[8:59] of a magnet you you as a child i'm sure
[9:04] you played like i did with two magnets
[9:06] and and you found out that if you turn
[9:09] them a certain way they pull one another
[9:12] they draw one another together if you
[9:14] flip one of those magnets over and then
[9:17] you would instead of being pulled
[9:20] together the two magnets would be pushed
[9:22] apart they would be repelled and so I
[9:25] believe there's a draw that's going
[9:27] forth in the spirit the Bible calls it
[9:30] the deep calling to the deep at the
[9:33] noise of thy waterspouts the deep is
[9:37] calling to the deep and I believe that's
[9:39] where we are right now the deeper truths
[9:42] of
[9:42] God's Word are being made known on
[9:45] planet earth in this hour and when we
[9:49] hear them if we have been called to be a
[9:52] part of that remnant bride something
[9:54] just draws us like the magnet it pulls
[9:58] us to hear more of that truth you know
[10:01] what I find out as God began to reveal
[10:04] some of these truths to us over the past
[10:06] 20 years plus I found out that there
[10:10] were times that I would hear something
[10:12] and my spirit would grab it before my
[10:15] mind was even able to understand it or
[10:18] comprehended what do you mean by that
[10:19] preacher I mean that internal witness of
[10:23] the Holy Spirit that inner a man not the
[10:27] one that comes out of your lips vocally
[10:29] but the one that's on the inside that
[10:32] that spirit man your spirit man my
[10:35] spirit man responding to the word of
[10:38] truth and something inside just quickens
[10:41] it comes alive somebody said well you're
[10:44] talking awful lot about feeling and
[10:47] emotion is that really how revelation
[10:50] works well remember what the scripture
[10:53] says we know that we are saved by the
[10:57] quickening of our spirit by the coming
[11:01] alive by the resurrecting of our spirit
[11:05] man and so sometimes the spirit man in
[11:08] fact most of the time the spirit man is
[11:12] quicker to grab ahold of a revelation
[11:14] truth before our soul and and the rest
[11:19] of us a rest of our our being our triune
[11:22] being here body soul and spirit our
[11:25] spirit grabs it before the rest of our
[11:28] body is able to filter it and even
[11:30] comprehend it and by all means explain
[11:33] it in other words i received revelation
[11:36] from god's word that I knew was right
[11:38] before I was ever able to articulate it
[11:41] before I was ever able to share it with
[11:44] someone else I just knew that I knew
[11:46] that I knew that I knew that God was
[11:49] making himself real to me in his word I
[11:52] want you to know right now wherever
[11:54] you're watching the Eagles cry that God
[11:56] wants you to have a deeper understanding
[11:59] of his word because when we receive a
[12:03] deeper understanding of his word we we
[12:07] actually began to understand him more
[12:10] and in understanding our Creator more we
[12:14] began to love him more and the more we
[12:17] love him the more we are drawn into a
[12:20] place of intimate fellowship and
[12:23] communion with him it is ultimately the
[12:26] desire of God think about this it is
[12:30] ultimately the desire of eternal God the
[12:34] creator of heaven and earth to have
[12:37] fellowship with me to have communion
[12:42] with me and to have fellowship and
[12:45] communion with you that's how much he
[12:48] loves us now what happens so many times
[12:53] after we're converted after we receive
[12:55] the Lord into our lives we get on that
[12:58] hamster wheel of Christianity of church
[13:02] anity we're going through all of the
[13:04] religious motions and the religious
[13:07] trappings and religious vocabulary but
[13:10] our our relationship is so small it
[13:16] doesn't grow in other words we we become
[13:19] more religious but our lives are not
[13:23] being transformed by the living reality
[13:25] of the word so I'm going to ask the Lord
[13:28] to use the Eagles cry we're sort of
[13:33] relaunching this part of our ministry
[13:35] although we have been on the television
[13:38] now for a number of years consistently
[13:42] weekly but we have a new burden and a
[13:47] fresh auction from the Holy Spirit to
[13:49] just get on here and I want to share my
[13:52] heart I want to tell you about my own
[13:54] experiences with the Lord and where I've
[13:57] come from and a little bit of my story
[13:58] and I want to hopefully inspire you to
[14:04] be able to reach up
[14:06] and pull up into the presence of God and
[14:10] receive a closer relationship with him
[14:13] in this hour and we're going to begin
[14:16] our study today about the end times
[14:19] we're going to talk about some of the
[14:22] things that are going on in the world
[14:24] around us and how they are pointing us
[14:28] to the soon return of the Lord Jesus
[14:32] Christ now I need to say a ride up front
[14:35] that I do believe in the resurrection
[14:38] rapture of the Bride of Christ and in in
[14:42] one of our studies together we will talk
[14:45] about the threefold expression of the
[14:49] coming of the Lord will talk about this
[14:51] resurrection rapture mystery but I do
[14:55] not believe that that the Bride of
[14:58] Christ is going to be caught out of the
[15:00] earth before some pretty serious things
[15:03] begin to transpire on on on this planet
[15:07] in other words this this whole idea of
[15:11] escaping before there's any trouble on
[15:14] the earth I just want to say i don't see
[15:17] that completely in the scripture i
[15:21] actually believe that the bride is going
[15:24] to be very needed and necessary here on
[15:27] the earth during the beginnings of some
[15:30] of those tragic events that are going to
[15:33] be unfolding some of which are already
[15:36] happening even now around the world the
[15:39] bride's presence here in the earth and
[15:41] our ministry is going to be necessary
[15:43] but there is coming an hour where he is
[15:46] going to come and receive his bride out
[15:49] of this earth into the realms of
[15:51] eternity and then the earth is going to
[15:54] go through a great time three and a half
[15:57] years of great wrath such as the world
[16:00] has never seen before and during that
[16:03] time we're going to see the the
[16:06] remaining scriptures that have not yet
[16:09] been fulfilled about the end time
[16:10] they're going to become reality and
[16:13] we're going to talk about that
[16:14] in a future program but I just wanted to
[16:17] give you a little a little taste right
[16:20] from the beginning I want you to know
[16:23] that i do see in the scripture a rapture
[16:26] resurrection for the Bride of Christ I
[16:29] must say from the beginning that I
[16:32] clearly see in the scripture also a
[16:36] differentiation between the church and
[16:38] the bride I truly believe that there is
[16:43] a church that Jesus gave his life for
[16:46] and loves that church supremely I
[16:49] believe that is clearly outlined in the
[16:51] scripture not only in Ephesians but in
[16:54] many other places but I also believe
[16:56] that there will be an overcoming company
[16:59] for instance when when the Lord Jesus
[17:01] was speaking to John on the Isle of
[17:03] Patmos in the book of Revelation and he
[17:06] was speaking to him giving him
[17:07] instructions to the seven churches of
[17:11] Asia Minor which also speak to us of
[17:15] seven church age periods in history not
[17:19] just seven literal churches that was
[17:21] definitely true but it also we can take
[17:24] those seven churches their attributes
[17:27] their strengths and their weaknesses and
[17:30] we can lay them out over 2,000 years of
[17:34] church history and when Jesus was
[17:36] delivering this message to john he would
[17:39] say to the Church of Ephesus write these
[17:42] things to the Church of Smyrna write
[17:45] these things and he would go all the way
[17:48] through the list but he would also say
[17:50] and to him that overcometh right and so
[17:55] I believe that it is clear indication
[17:58] that every church member is not going to
[18:02] overcome in the end time I believe
[18:05] there's an invitation going forth in
[18:07] this hour to come up revelation for
[18:10] talks about that open door that's
[18:12] inviting us to come up into higher
[18:15] realms of glory and when we step into
[18:19] that realm we begin to see things as
[18:21] John saw them from Heaven's perspective
[18:25] I'm telling you if you
[18:27] are only looking at things from Earth's
[18:30] perspective you're going to get pretty
[18:34] discouraged in fact you're going to feel
[18:36] like giving up I know that even in my
[18:39] own life when I when I start looking at
[18:42] my circumstances looking at the darkness
[18:45] that's around me I could really have a
[18:48] tendency to be depressed and when I find
[18:52] myself getting in that place I just
[18:54] remember that the the invitation in
[18:58] Revelation chapter 4 was not just for
[19:01] John i believe it was also for the
[19:03] overcoming bride in the end time an
[19:05] invitation to come up higher because I
[19:08] want to show you some things so I I
[19:10] remind the Lord Lord you invited John
[19:12] I'd like to have that invitation I'd
[19:15] like to respond help me to come up and
[19:17] one of the ways that we go up in the
[19:20] realm of the Spirit is by worshipping
[19:21] Him I mean you don't even have to be a
[19:23] singer to sing worship you can let your
[19:27] heart you don't even have to know the
[19:28] words of a him or a good worship chorus
[19:31] to be able to worship you can just turn
[19:33] your heart loose just loose your tongue
[19:35] and open your mouth and just start
[19:37] singing your praise to God and if you if
[19:40] you run out of vocabulary I've been
[19:43] telling people for for nearly 30 years
[19:45] to to go and read the book of psalms out
[19:49] loud to the Lord because there's one
[19:52] thing for sure David had a beautiful
[19:54] worship vocabulary he he is our example
[19:59] in worship it through the scripture and
[20:01] i just read some time the beautiful
[20:05] words of David and I read them from my
[20:07] heart to the Lord and i feel myself
[20:10] being lifted up and when you get lifted
[20:12] up in the spirit the atmosphere begins
[20:15] to change around you and it's not so
[20:18] much that your circumstances and
[20:20] problems automatically change but you
[20:23] begin to be elevated and now instead of
[20:26] looking parallel at your situation
[20:28] you're now looking down on it because
[20:30] you've been caught up in the realm of
[20:32] praise caught up into the spirit and
[20:35] you're looking down on your problem and
[20:37] you know what it doesn't look as dark as
[20:39] it did when you were
[20:40] looking head on it doesn't seem to have
[20:44] the same depressing discouraging effect
[20:46] that it had before so I guess the best
[20:49] advice I could give you today is get in
[20:51] the spirit in fact that's how the book
[20:54] of the revelation started John said I
[20:56] was in the spirit on the Lord's Day so
[20:58] let me encourage you to worship your way
[21:01] into the realm of the Spirit so that
[21:04] your soulish senses are silenced and so
[21:09] that you begin to move out of your
[21:13] spirit man instead out of instead of out
[21:17] of that soulish realm or that fleshly
[21:20] realm we can we can explain that a
[21:22] little more in another study but get
[21:26] into that place of spirit so that you
[21:28] can begin to look down on on your
[21:31] circumstances and the things that are
[21:33] going on around you in the world from
[21:35] from the Lord's point of view from
[21:38] Heaven's vantage point and I promise you
[21:41] that the things that look like mountains
[21:44] when you were looking at them through
[21:46] the flesh or the soul will look like
[21:48] little mole hills or ant hills when
[21:52] you're looking at them from the realm of
[21:54] the Spirit there's not a problem that
[21:56] you could be going through right now too
[21:58] big for God to solve them so what we
[22:02] need in this hour is a clear word from
[22:06] God a clear word we need a pure
[22:10] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ with
[22:14] all of man's ideas and and traditional
[22:18] interpretations that are not rooted in
[22:20] the scripture we need all that plucked
[22:23] out of the way and we need the Holy
[22:25] Ghost to come and anoint our eyes with
[22:28] eye salve so that we can see the truth
[22:31] of the scripture so that we can hear the
[22:34] pure voice of God let me give you a
[22:38] verse of scripture I got a little
[22:39] carried away in my introduction and my
[22:42] time is nearly gone but let me share
[22:44] first Corinthians chapter 14 verses 7
[22:48] and 8 with you today it says and even
[22:52] things without life-giving sound whether
[22:56] pipe or harp and of course you know
[22:59] that's musical instruments except they
[23:02] give a distinction in the sounds how
[23:08] shall it be known what is piped or
[23:11] harped if any of you are familiar with
[23:15] with music for instance the brass
[23:18] instruments or the woodwind instruments
[23:20] you're probably able to distinguish by
[23:24] the sound what the instrument is that's
[23:27] being played sometimes I find it kind of
[23:30] fun to be listening to a piece of music
[23:32] and start identifying the various
[23:35] instruments that are making up the
[23:38] symphony how can you do that because
[23:40] musical instruments have a distinct
[23:44] sound and you're able to identify what
[23:47] the instrument is and what the piece of
[23:50] music is by identifying the distinct
[23:54] sound that the musical instrument is
[23:56] making verse 8 1st Corinthians 14 says
[24:01] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[24:05] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[24:09] battle and that's what we're dealing
[24:11] with in this hour we need a certain
[24:15] sound from heaven we need a prophetic
[24:19] voice we need prophetic voices to be
[24:24] raised up all over the world that will
[24:28] not be speaking or prophesying or
[24:31] teaching according to their own opinion
[24:34] or what their perception is rather they
[24:38] would be speaking what heavens
[24:41] perception and perspective is i'll just
[24:45] sum it up for you we need thus saith the
[24:48] lord we need the nine gifts of the
[24:52] spirit we need the the offices that are
[24:56] listed for us in the book of Ephesians
[24:58] we need those ministry offices we need
[25:02] the service gifts of Romans chapter 12
[25:05] we need the fresh breath of God to
[25:10] breathe over the places where people are
[25:15] gathered in the Lord's name all over the
[25:17] earth we need a revival we need God to
[25:20] come and and wake us up and break us out
[25:25] of our lethargy are our complacency our
[25:28] laziness and we need to be awakened to
[25:32] the urgency of the hour we need a
[25:35] trumpet blast we need to hear the shofar
[25:38] of God calling us to action and that
[25:43] shofar that trumpet needs to give such a
[25:46] distinct word and a distinguishable
[25:49] sound that the people of God are not in
[25:53] confusion but so that they are able to
[25:57] know the perfect mind and will of God
[26:01] for their lives and for the time in
[26:04] which we live so we're going to
[26:06] hopefully be a part of that trumpet I
[26:12] asked the Lord the often Lord let my
[26:15] voice be a trumpet that will not trumpet
[26:19] my ideas or blast out my own opinions
[26:23] but let me be led by the revelation of
[26:26] the Holy Spirit and let me give that to
[26:29] the eager bride around the world I
[26:32] believe that many of you are being
[26:35] called to hear some of the amazing
