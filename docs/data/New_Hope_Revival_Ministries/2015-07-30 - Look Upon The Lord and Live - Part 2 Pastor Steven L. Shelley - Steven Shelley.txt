[Music] [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the eagle cry I'm thanking God today for the wonderful Christian networks that he has raised up uh to broadcast the good news the

blessing for me to know that there are networks out there who want to cut through the Chase uh lay the entertainment aside and they want to give you the unadulterated uncompromised word of God and that's what these networks are about that you see me coming to you on today and most definitely that's what our ministry is about New Hope Revival ministries I'm in Smith Station Alabama in the United

would want to do anything I could to help you get something anyway so if you contact us we'll do our best we might have to put you in line but we would do our best to give you something free it's our desire to be a bless bling in your life and to help you with with uh the resources that we have available let's get into the study and let's see what God has for us today shall we do that all right we are talking about I I I think the subject is too big to Define because we're walking through a journey and we're headed to the Cross I'll tell you that but we're starting in the book of Exodus and we're talking about uh Moses and we ended our Study last week talking about Moses and his desire to know God in an intimate way in fact the scripture said that Moses had had face-to-face encounters with God and yet he desired even more than that I mean it sounds like if you could talk with God face to face lip to ear what could be better than that but Moses had a even a deeper desire and I believe if you have a deep desire as the scripture talks about the Deep calling to the Deep if you have a desire for more of God then to me that is actual proof that there's more of God available or you wouldn't have the desire and the longing in your heart for it and uh I I I'm familiar with a story and I think it's I I think it's happened around the world but I'm familiar with a with a story that appeared in the news many years ago about a child who seemed to have this disorder uh of of eating Rubber and uh even the Erasers on the end of the pencil and and even the pedals of a bicycle and of course the parents were so concerned that this child would would chew and eat this Rubber and they took her to the doctor and they did blood work and they did a psychological evaluation and they wanted to find out what was wrong with the child you know what they found they found that there was a lack of sulfur in her system her body was craving it was calling out for the compound of sulfur and she found a way to meet that need and and with with an intelligence that she didn't possess in the natural so I think that this speaks to us of there's something on the inside that knows what we need even when we're not conscious of what we need and if there's a pull inside of you for more it's a craving and it means that there there is more available so keep leaning in to God and keep positioning Yourself by faith to receive more and this was Moses he he just said I I I appreciate the fact Lord that you want to send an angel to help us but I would much prefer if you would go with us we want you to be the one to lead us and we want to know you face to face you know Moses I believe didn't just want to encounter God for himself but he wanted the people to have an encounter I think that's the mark of every true leader we not only want to have a greater walk with God but we want everybody we know and love and care about to have a greater walk with God and so we read about this concept of face to face without a veil without a hindrance with no one or nothing no thing standing in our way just a a real clear relationship with the Lord what do you think that means face to face well when we talk about the face of God we're talking about his Spirit we're talking about that which emanates from God that which pours forth from God so when the scripture talks about the face of God it's talking about uh an encounter with the spirit of God do you remember remember in the Book of Genesis in chapter one where it tells us that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water now water doesn't have a face but it does have a surface and you break that surface of the water when you're plunged in when you jump into the water you break that surface so that word uh uh surface or the word face uh it talks about the spirit of God moving over the surface of the water and we follow these uh types through the scripture what does water represent in the Bible if face represents Spirit what does water represent well the Bible tells us in the Book of Revelation CH 17 and verse 15 that Waters represent people multitudes Nations and tongues and symbols are always always consistent in the word of God so Waters means people and face means spirit so if the if the spirit of God was moving over the face of the water it was bringing the peop into an encounter with the face of God the spirit of God the presence of God and when I talk about the presence of God in this regard I'm not just talking about something that that makes you feel A tingle I'm talking about the manifested presence of God and when the manifested presence of God comes into your life things are not the same change transformation Deliverance takes place so I think we all cry out in this hour for more of an encounter with the face of God the spirit of God and we not only need him we need him over all the w Waters we need him over all the peoples of the earth we need a move a deep move of the spirit of God to awaken the churches around the world and to cause the people of Faith to rise up and get a hold of God it's not time to be lazy Christians it's time to be deeply committed to God in this hour in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 it says but we all with open face there it is is face to face nothing in between beholding as in a glass a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord as we look into the face of God as we look into the things of the spirit of God they become like a mirror and we begin to see a transformation in the reflection of the mirror we are be we are beginning to be changed by what we look into that makes me want to cry out Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord like the beautiful worship song says Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you I want to see you this seeing is not with these natural eyes this seeing is with our heart with our spirit it's being able to Spirit to Spirit our human Spirit that's been regenerated and transformed by the Living spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ having communion with the face of God with the spirit of God I call it Spirit to Spirit Fellowship maybe that sounds a little strange to you but but it is a it is a introduction if you have ever experienced this kind of spirit-to-spirit connection with God where you could feel his spirit in your spirit uh quickening you making you alive the Bible said if that same Spirit which raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken make alive your mortal body I want you to know that's not just the promise of a future resurrection of your physical body it's also a a promise of a spiritual transformation in your life and the more that we come like Adam face to face communion with God we sit under the revealed word of God and we worship God we praise the Lord until the spirit of God begins to move upon us and when the anointing of God begins to move upon us we enter into the Realms of worship and worship is not a sacrifice praise is sometimes a sacrifice we we we praise the lord we lift up our hands we shout hallelujah whether we feel like it or not but as we enter in to the presence of God by the sacrifice of praise then the anointing begins to come the Manifest presence of God begins to fall and then there is a transition from praise to worship and worship is not about work it's it's not about will it's not about sacrifice worship is an overflow of your heart God has filled your heart you are so filled with gratefulness and Thanksgiving gratitude and that begins to flow out of you you just can't contain it and you just begin to to gush forth oh you're wonderful Jesus You're Beautiful Jesus you're so wonderful and lovely Lord you mean mean so much to me and that worship begins to transform us it begins to pull us in and we are changed by glory to glory in other words from one experience with the Manifest presence of God to the next from one worship Moment One Moment In His presence I believe it was David that said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord for one day than to dwell in the tents of evil or wickedness for for eternity or forever or for many days and I feel that way I'd rather be in the presence of God I I know there are a lot of people who don't like to gather with the Saints but I'm not one of them I like to gather with God's people there's something about the release of a corporate anointing when we come together I bring my lick of fire you bring your lick of fire and the and the more we gather together the more licks of fire we have and we begin and to encounter God in a corporate level in a way that that is is somewhat different than how we encounter God individually one doesn't replace the other both are very very important in our lives and Moses wanted more of an encounter I believe he was craving and crying out for an individual encounter but he also wanted a corporate encounter for the people of God as we behold God's glory as we we look into the things of the spirit we begin to be changed by what we see and the Bible tells us in that same chapter of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 but in verses 13 and 14 it talks about Moses and the veil let me read it to you and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their Minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ and this speaks about the glory that Moses encountered on the mountain it was so powerful it was so uh radiant that he covered his face with a veil when he would go and meet with the people and there was a reason for that and we could talk about about that in another time but it talks about the fact that with the with the children of Israel there is even to this day a veil that remains over their faces as they begin to read the Old Testament and and what that says to us is they do not fully understand what the promises of the Old Testament were pointing to they have not yet seen the end the Fulfillment the reality of the type and Shadow uh the Old Testament is God's plan it's God's instruction but it is a type and a shadow that leads us to a reality and that reality can only be found in a relationship with the Messiah a personal relationship with our savior I want you to know though that that Veil that separates Israel from from understanding the Fulfillment of every promise and the type and Shadow that was fulfilled in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible tells us that that Veil can and will be removed in 2 Corinthians same chapter but in verse 16 chapter 3 nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away I believe that there will be a Great Awakening in Israel and among the Jewish people all over the world I I believe there will be a Great Awakening when the veil that is over their faces and the partial blindness that they have received for the benefit of the Gentiles when that Veil and that blindness has been removed what a glorious day that's going to be when God revisits his own chosen people and when they see without aail and so in the meantime I want I want the same experience because I know there are times that there are veils in my life there are things that come between me and being able to encounter God in a real way I want those removed I don't want any barrier I don't want a veil remember how the veil hung in the temple and remember that when our lord Jesus was dying on the cross uh that veil of the temple was rent in two it was rent in Twain the Bible says it was ripped from Top to bottom that indicates to me that God himself ripped that Veil opened up the way into the holy of holies I was preaching to my own church last night from the scripture in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 where it talks about our great high priest who has made the holies the holiest of holies accessible we have access he provided way I think the King James says say he consecrated a way he made a way so that you and I can go in and enter into the fullness of his glory into the fullness of his presence now Moses had encountered god let's not forget this he had seen the the power of God demonstrated he saw God split the Red Sea he saw God on the mountain he saw God provide and yet he longed for more and I want to say again that I believe the the heart of the Bride no matter what nation she lives in around the world I believe the heart of the Bride is crying out for more of God a deeper relationship hey look we don't have to settle for a surface relationship with God a pretense we can have what the Bible said is available we can have it if we're willing to line ourselves up by faith now it requires sanctification it requires a consecration and a setting apart and that happens when we yield when we yield ourselves it's not easy to to bring our uh five senses down hush them tell them to be quiet it's not always easy to bring our will and our mind and our emotions and cause them to be calm so that we can have an encounter Spirit to spirit with God but we have to be willing to do that I'll just tell you that one of the ways that can be accomplished is by pulling aside and giving God uh some time just setting aside some time to be in the presence of God and I know it's not easy to do that in the busy life that we live but if you can make that appointment make it a uh a habit and set that up as a goal I'm going to give God uh Wednesday afternoon or uh I'm going to do my best to to spend time with God on Saturday morning morning I'm going to pull away and do your best to be faithful to that I tell you folk it will benefit you more than what you realize if you go about it in in the right motive you're not doing it to earn favor with God you're not doing it so that he'll love you you're do because he does love you already but you're doing it because you just want more of him he knows our heart now let's look at uh Exodus chapter 34 we've been in 32 and 33 let's look at 34 for a moment and verse 29 and 30 and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount SII with the two tablets of testimony in his hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wied not that the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face Shone and they were afraid to come n to him he had physically been changed physically there was a Glory that was emanating radiating from his face because he had encountered the living reality of God and then we go down to verse 33 and 34 and till Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he took that Veil off until he came out notice the veil was when he was speaking to the people but but when he went in to speak with God he took that Veil off and I encourage you to do the same thing any thing that stands between you and God put that aside and come before the Lord with the purest heart and uh well the best way to do that is come before him with repentance with a repentant heart that says Lord you've already paid the price for me but I'm a human and my nature sometimes opposes the law of the spirit and I pray that you will give me Grace as I enter into your presence to worship you and to lift you up because I want to know you try telling God that try uh somebody said well I can't word it that way well you know you might be surprised but sometime I feel the same way I feel like I have a lot more to express that I don't have the language and the vocabulary to express so you're not the only one that feels that way sometime but look he's your friend he's a friend that Stith closer than any brother and he wants to have fellowship with you that's an amazing thing to me that God wants to have fellowship with us and so I just uh encourage you to make that a reality in your life and come before him without a pretense without a veil especially the veil of religion some people get so caught CAU up in in the in the Trap of religion and they you know they think they have to come before God like they're like they're visiting the Queen of England I believe it's right to come before him holy and come before him with reverential fear but I believe that we can be honest with God why not we might as well be honest with him he already knows everything about us we're not hiding anything from him I believe God wants us to just say you know uh I I don't know if you ever do this or not but sometimes when I'm frustrated I tell the Lord Lord I'm just frustrated I need peace you're you're the God of Peace you're the prince of peace and I don't have any peace in my heart right now I feel turmoil I feel stress I'm tired I'm aggravated and I need you oh I hope you're I hope you're not offended by my talking to the Lord that way in fact I hope you'll take it as your example and I think that you you'll find that there will be a peace come over you and a relaxation and a a rest that will begin to come into your spirit and you can stop your striving and quit your labor and working so hard for God to love you I want you to know he loves you and he loves obedience yes of course he does but he loves you and he wants to draw you to himself let me pray for you right now and ask the Lord to draw you and I'm going to pray that you'll find the Grace to be drawable that you will stop resisting what God wants to do in your life and you'll just surrender to him in this hour father I thank you for this television congregation that you've given me today and I ask you Lord to in to move into their lives father the the veil of pretense the veil of religion that keeps us from being able to have Spirit top fellowship with you face-to-face encounter with you I pray that you will extend Grace right now in the matchless name of our Messiah that you will break off the fed the chain any bondage any resistance that's moving against the children of God and you will cause us to come into that place of fellowship with you like Moses was after when he began to cry out oh Lord Show Me Your Glory I pray that you will make that a living reality in those watching this program right now we ask these things in the mighty name of our savior the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for watching the Eagles cry I hope you'll tune in again I'm not nearly through with this study uh so bye-bye for [Music] now [Music]
