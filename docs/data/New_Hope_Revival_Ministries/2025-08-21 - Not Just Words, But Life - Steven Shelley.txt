Description:
Revelation was never meant to make us proud — it was given so we could live it out in our homes, with our children, and within the body of Christ. When someone stumbles, our first response is not judgment but prayer. We call on the Ancient of Days, the One who holds all wisdom in His hands, trusting Him to guide us in love and restoration.

This generation carries a greater responsibility than ever before. The Word must now produce the very life of Christ in us. Not just repeated sayings, but transformation that comes from time in the secret place with Christ the Word.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So, we've got to learn also how to take this great revelation of the word and not be puffed up with bride pride, &gt;&gt; but begin to bring it down to such a place where we can live it very practically &gt;&gt; in our life with our children, with our grandchildren, with our with our church faith community. Because in an environment like that where we know when someone stumbles, we know and we go to prayer and we don't condemn and we don't judge motives and we don't put them in hell, but we begin to try to rescue them first in prayer &gt;&gt; before you put your mouth on any situation as a believer. &gt;&gt; We go to prayer first &gt;&gt; and we ask God for wisdom. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he's got it. &gt;&gt; He is the ancient of days. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has all wisdom in his hands. &gt;&gt; All wisdom. And he knows how to help us. Yeah. I'm telling you, this is the hour. This is actually the most important generation &gt;&gt; perhaps that there that there's ever been. It is more important than the 50s and 60s. And I know that's hard for some folks around the message to say, but it is. It's much more important because the word that God delivered in that generation is more precious and more applicable even to the day and hour we're living in right now than it ever was. And if it's ever going to produce the life of Christ, it has to do it now. If there's ever going to be overcoming Christians, they have to be in this hour. If there's ever going to be fully adopted sons, they've got to step up now. No. [Applause] He didn't come so that all that would come out of our mouth, as brother Bram said, brother Bram said, Brother Bram said, &gt;&gt; he came so that we could get a hold of this word, we could eat it &gt;&gt; and digest it and unpack it until we become it. &gt;&gt; The living word, that's the transformation that has to take place in this hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; And and the only way I know is to spend enough time in that pavilion, &gt;&gt; in that secret place with this with Christ the word. &gt;&gt; If I go in the secret place with Christ the word, &gt;&gt; this must produce a change. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And what we really want is for him to whisper in our ear what we need to work on. Wouldn't that be lovely? &gt;&gt; You just come real, real quiet, and tell me what I need to do different, and I'm going to work on it now, Jesus. But that's not the prayer that this psalmist was praying. He was literally, if you look at the original words, he was saying, "Expose me. Rip off the charade, the facade. dig to the deepest part of who I am &gt;&gt; and let me see my own heart and let me see my own emotions and let me see my own response so that I can throw it before you and be new. The Amplified said, "Examine me, oh Lord, and prove me and test my heart and test my mind and see who I am." And that can't always come with a whisper. It sometimes has to come through public gaze. And nobody wants to hear such a thing. [Music]
