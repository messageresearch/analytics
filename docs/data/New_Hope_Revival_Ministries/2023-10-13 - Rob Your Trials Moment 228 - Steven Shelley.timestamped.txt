[0:00] you better make up your mind and
[0:02] understand to serve God is not for a few
[0:06] minutes when you make a decision it's
[0:09] all the days of your life you should
[0:12] serve him it's not just till the Revival
[0:16] begins and when the Revival ends it's
[0:19] the end of
[0:21] you when God calls you it's going to be
[0:24] for the rest of your life that you will
[0:27] have to serve
[0:28] him woo you cannot serve him
[0:33] come people try to serve him that's
[0:35] right come you need the Holy Ghost to
[0:37] serve him that's
[0:39] right and you will never be able to pick
[0:41] up that cross you need to deny yourself
[0:43] you see you need to deny yourself every
[0:47] day the song says I'll choose you again
[0:49] and again and again Lord amen every time
[0:52] the devil will come around on and and
[0:55] you will not able you will not be able
[0:56] to pick up your cross you need to deny
[0:59] yourself every day you need to turn
[1:02] against yourself your biggest enemy is
[1:05] yourself you need to kill yourself and
[1:08] brother B says you need to lay still and
[1:10] let God slay you and kill
[1:13] you and that's why you can misunder
[1:16] understand your trials you can
[1:18] misunderstand your pain you can
[1:21] misunderstand your
[1:23] [Music]
[1:24] sufferings brother say sometimes you can
[1:26] think it's a devil then it's God doing
[1:27] it right and sometimes you think it's
[1:29] God then it's the devil doing it but you
[1:31] need to
[1:32] discern you see God needs to kill you
[1:34] now God needs to mold and and and and
[1:37] and break you and mold you and and put
[1:39] some character in you listen I always
[1:41] tell our church don't let your trial R
[1:44] you rob your
[1:48] trial don't come out of your trial
[1:51] poor listen Jesus went to hell he
[1:54] experienced yell but he came out of yell
[1:57] when he didn't he didn't just come out
[1:59] of yell he came out with the
[2:04] key so while you experience yelling your
[2:08] life just find the
[2:10] key there's a revelation in your pain
[2:14] there's a revelation in your sufferings
[2:15] and once you find the key you will come
[2:19] out come out with a key come out of your
[2:22] trial with the Revelation come out with
[2:25] character come out with
[2:27] inspiration come out with victory yes
[2:30] Rob your trial Pentecostal churches
[2:33] denominations and they just prosper and
[2:34] prosper but we as a bride why do we have
[2:37] to suffer like this Lord and then the
[2:39] Lord had to tell me we're not in the
[2:41] book of Corinthians we in the book of
[2:43] Ephesians he says we are predestinated
[2:46] unto adoption and bra says in adoption
[2:49] book do you know what is adoption
[2:51] adoption is BR says the angel will come
[2:53] down God will send the angel and he will

[2:59] to your job and turn all the colleagues
[3:02] against you go even into the church and
[3:05] turn the whole church against you just
[3:09] to see what you will
[3:12] do and then the prophet said the angel
[3:14] will go back to God and give a report he
[3:17] said I did this I turned his family
[3:19] against him but he still stood for you I
[3:22] turned his friends against him but he
