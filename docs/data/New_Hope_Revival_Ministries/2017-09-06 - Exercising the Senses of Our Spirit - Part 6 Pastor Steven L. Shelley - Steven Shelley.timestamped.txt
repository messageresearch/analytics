[1:55] watching this program we appreciate
[1:58] every email all the contact that comes
[2:00] in I want us to get right into the study
[2:02] because last week I almost I ran right
[2:06] out of time I introduced the story i was
[2:08] going to share with you and then ran out
[2:09] of time so we need to get right back
[2:11] into our study today okay in Genesis
[2:14] chapter 2 verses 19 and 20 we we read
[2:18] about this place of harmony with God
[2:22] first of all Adam walked in perfect
[2:25] oneness harmony with God made in the
[2:30] image and in the likeness of God
[2:32] communicated with God spirit to spirit
[2:35] because of that because of that oneness
[2:38] that place that he had with God in his
[2:41] spirit man it also caused him to
[2:44] function in harmony with all of God's
[2:48] creation because Adam was action
[2:51] given Dominion and you know I think we
[2:53] could look at that before we before we
[2:55] go to chapter 2 here let's look at
[2:58] Genesis and perhaps we could get that
[3:02] Scripture and just remind you of what
[3:05] the Lord had said part of that part of
[3:08] that Commission was that Adam have
[3:12] dominion over everything he was made in
[3:16] the in the image and likeness of God
[3:18] Genesis 126 and God said let us make man
[3:21] in our image after our likeness and let
[3:24] us or let them have dominion over the
[3:28] fish of the sea the fowl of the air over
[3:30] the cattle and over all the earth and
[3:32] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[3:34] upon the earth so God gave as the
[3:37] original mandate to Adam and Eve
[3:39] Dominion of course we're speaking of
[3:41] Adam now but we know that Eve came out
[3:43] of Adam gave them dominion over all of
[3:47] nature all of the other creations and
[3:50] it's an interesting thing because they
[3:53] flowed and operated in such harmony and
[3:56] that that brings us to Genesis chapter 2
[3:58] where we wanted to share again today it
[4:01] says verse 19 and out of the ground the
[4:04] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[4:07] and every fowl of the air and brought
[4:09] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[4:12] them a member remember again God brought
[4:15] the animals to Adam and said hey Adam
[4:17] what would you name this animal it's an
[4:21] interesting thing and whatsoever Adam
[4:24] called every living creature that was
[4:25] the night that was the name thereof and
[4:27] Adam gave names to all cattle to the
[4:30] fowl of the air to every beast of the
[4:32] field but for Adam there was not found a
[4:35] helpmeet for him so what we were
[4:37] teaching was that we believe this
[4:41] harmony that Adam had with with God's
[4:44] other creations his other creatures it's
[4:48] not just for Adam we believe that the
[4:50] curse is being reversed we believe that
[4:54] God is calling you and I to walk in that
[4:58] kind of place of Dominion in the kingdom
[5:03] of God there
[5:04] may be circumstances as we minister for
[5:07] him that we need to exercise that
[5:09] authority and that Dominion even over
[5:12] stormy winds we see that happening over
[5:17] weather patterns or perhaps even over
[5:21] these other creatures the animal kingdom
[5:24] that God has made I read to you last
[5:27] time we were together two beautiful
[5:29] examples of how God gave brother Branham
[5:32] this this love that projected first to
[5:35] the Hornets and instead of them they
[5:37] were already covering his body but
[5:38] instead of them stinging him when he
[5:40] just started ministering to them out of
[5:42] love and I'm sorry I disturbed you and
[5:45] just go right back to where you came
[5:47] from and I'm sorry I disturbed your nap
[5:49] or whatever the words were and all of a
[5:52] sudden they make that that line line
[5:54] right up and went right back into that
[5:56] bird box where they had made their nest
[5:58] and then he told us about the bull and I
[6:01] read that to you where he he crossed
[6:03] into a field where there was a bull that
[6:06] had killed a man just three months
[6:07] before he was so afraid when he saw that
[6:11] bull coming but all of a sudden the
[6:13] perfect love of God just come flooding
[6:15] over his spirit man and he projected
[6:17] that love and when love is projected
[6:21] grace takes over and and so there are
[6:24] many situations in our life now now
[6:26] we're talking about the animal kingdom
[6:28] but you know you can absolutely defuse a
[6:32] situation with someone on the street
[6:34] with a with a conflict or some kind of
[6:38] relationship that's gone awry or perhaps
[6:42] a traffic situation or or a co-worker
[6:45] where there is a lot of animosity and a
[6:48] lot of ill-feeling that's being stirred
[6:51] up you would be surprised how love
[6:54] projected can diffuse can can absolutely
[6:59] speak peace into a storm or into a
[7:03] stormy situation and so I told you right
[7:07] at the end of the broadcast that I would
[7:10] share with you a testimony from the life
[7:13] of sadhu sundar Singh and he was about
[7:17] 15 years
[7:18] old when he was converted to
[7:20] Christianity in 1904 I think was his the
[7:23] uris of his conversion in 1905 he was
[7:28] baptized into the church of england he
[7:30] disappeared in 1929 and no one ever
[7:33] found his body he was doing a strenuous
[7:36] work in Tibet but there's a testimony of
[7:39] how he lived in harmony with other parts
[7:43] of God's creation and I'm going to read
[7:46] this testimony from a man who hosted
[7:48] sadhu sundar Singh in his home many many
[7:52] years ago those who roomed our lived
[7:54] with him speaking of sadhu sundar Singh
[7:57] not only saw but recorded some of the
[8:00] marvelous events which seemed to
[8:02] constantly take place around his life
[8:04] and I believe that's because he was
[8:07] walking as a forerunner in this place of
[8:11] divine alignment communicating with God
[8:14] spirit to spirit bringing the soul into
[8:18] its rightful place its proper order and
[8:21] balance feeding the spirit man until it
[8:24] becomes the force that governs us the
[8:26] Holy Spirit sitting the Lord Jesus
[8:28] sitting on the throne of our human
[8:31] spirit he said that's a gentleman who
[8:34] later became a YMCA secretary in England
[8:37] wrote of a night which had left him
[8:39] stunned and speechless long after
[8:43] midnight the man said I was roused by
[8:46] movement in the room the sadhu had risen
[8:49] from his bed and was moving toward the
[8:52] door which opened onto the wooden stairs
[8:54] outside the house the creaking of the
[8:57] wood made it clear that he was going
[8:59] down the stairs knowing that the sad who
[9:02] spent hours of the night in prayer I was
[9:04] not surprised at this but when half an
[9:07] hour or so it passed and he had not
[9:09] returned I became uneasy the thought of
[9:12] that leopard that lived in the valley
[9:14] made me feel anxious so I got out of bed
[9:18] and looked out the window toward the
[9:20] forest a few yards from the house I saw
[9:24] the sad news sitting looking down into
[9:26] the deep valley it was a beautiful night
[9:28] the stars were shining
[9:30] quietly for a few moments I watched the
[9:32] silent figure of the sadhu then my eyes
[9:35] were attracted by something moving on
[9:38] his right an animal was coming toward
[9:41] him as I got nervous I saw that it was a
[9:45] leopard choked with fear I stood
[9:48] motionless near the window unable even
[9:50] to call out to him just then the sadhu
[9:53] turned his face towards the animal and
[9:56] held out his hand as though it had been
[9:58] a dog the leopard lay down and stretched
[10:02] out its head to be stroked by the satu
[10:05] it was a strange and unbelievable scene
[10:08] and I can never forget it a short time
[10:10] afterwards the sadhu returned and was
[10:12] soon asleep but I lay awake wondering at
[10:15] what I had seen the foregoing
[10:18] deliverance brings to mind the more
[10:20] famous incident when a man eating wolf
[10:23] was rebuked and tamed by sant francis of
[10:26] assisi incredible as it might seem
[10:29] people who walk close to Jesus Christ
[10:31] have exercised this strange power both
[10:34] over bloodthirsty bandits and cruel
[10:37] beast of prey perhaps we'll just share a
[10:41] little bit of the story of st. Francis
[10:43] in the wolf just kind of go right into
[10:45] that perhaps the most famous story of
[10:47] Saint Francis is when he tamed the wolf
[10:50] that was terrorizing the people of a
[10:52] certain village in the village was
[10:54] spelled GU BBI o gubbio while Francis
[10:59] was staying in that town he learned of a
[11:01] wolf that was so ravenous that it was
[11:04] not only killing and eating animals but
[11:06] also eating people to the people took up
[11:09] arms and went after it but those who
[11:11] encountered the wolf perished as at its
[11:14] sharp teeth villagers became afraid to
[11:17] leave the city walls Francis had pity on
[11:19] the people and decided to go out and
[11:21] meet the wolf he was desperately worn by
[11:24] the people but he insisted that God
[11:26] would take care of him a brave fryer in
[11:28] several peasants accompanied Francis
[11:30] outside the city gate but soon the
[11:33] peasants lost heart and said they would
[11:35] not go any farther Francis and his
[11:37] companion began to walk on suddenly the
[11:40] wolf's jaws a gap charged out of the
[11:43] woods
[11:44] at the couple Francis made the sign of
[11:47] the Cross toward it that was his faith
[11:49] that was his religion the power of God
[11:51] caused the wolf to slow down and to
[11:53] close its mouth then Francis called out
[11:56] to the creature come to me brother wolf
[11:58] in the name of Christ i order you not to
[12:01] hurt anyone at that moment the wolf
[12:04] lowered its head and laid down at the
[12:06] feet of st. Francis meek as a lamb st.
[12:09] Francis explained that the wolf that he
[12:12] that had been terrorizing the people
[12:13] killing not only animals but humans were
[12:16] also made in the image of God killing
[12:20] humans who were made in the image of God
[12:22] Brother Wolf said Francis i want to make
[12:25] peace between you and the people of this
[12:27] village they will harm you no more and
[12:30] you must no longer harm them all past
[12:33] crimes are to be forgiven the wolf
[12:36] showed his ascent by moving its body and
[12:39] nodding its head then to the absolute
[12:41] surprise of the gathering crowd Francis
[12:44] asked the wolf to make a pledge as st.
[12:46] Francis extended his hand to receive the
[12:48] pledge so the wolf extended his front
[12:50] paw and placed it in the hand of the
[12:53] same then Francis commanded the wolf to
[12:55] follow him into the town to make a peace
[12:57] pact with the townspeople the wolf
[13:00] meekly followed Saint Francis by the
[13:02] time they got to the town square
[13:04] everyone was there to witness the
[13:06] miracle with the wolf at his side
[13:08] Francis gave the town of sermon on the
[13:10] wonderful and fearful love of God the
[13:15] power of the love of God when it is
[13:19] displayed when it is projected even
[13:22] toward the animal kingdom calling them
[13:25] to repent for their sin then he offered
[13:27] the townspeople peace on behalf of the
[13:29] wolf the townspeople promised in a loud
[13:32] voice to feed the wolf then Francis
[13:35] asked the wolf if he would live in peace
[13:36] under those terms he bowed his head
[13:38] twisted his body in a way that convinced
[13:41] everyone he accepted the pack then once
[13:43] again the wolf placed his paw in Francis
[13:46] hand as a sign from that day on the
[13:48] people kept the pack they had made the
[13:51] wolf lived for two years among the
[13:53] townspeople going from door to door for
[13:55] food it hurt no
[13:57] one and no one heard yet even the dogs
[13:59] did not bark at it when the wolf finally
[14:02] died of old age the people of the
[14:04] village were sad the wolf's peaceful
[14:06] ways had been a living reminder to them
[14:08] of the wonders patience and virtues of
[14:11] this man of God it had been a living
[14:13] symbol of the power and Providence of
[14:16] God now why would you share such a story
[14:19] is that well I believe I've given you
[14:21] four examples of thousands and thousands
[14:26] of testimonies that could be shared from
[14:28] all the nations of the world that there
[14:30] are times when man has needed to
[14:33] exercise authority over this over the
[14:36] animal kingdom and I believe these are
[14:38] tokens and reminders of a walk that is
[14:42] available to people of God today we read
[14:45] about the mystics who lived in the woods
[14:47] who fasted and prayed in cabins who who
[14:51] came in why was that why is that a part
[14:53] of of church history I believe it's
[14:56] because there were four runners who
[14:58] found a way to tap in to this
[15:01] relationship with God I do not believe
[15:04] that God is calling us all to the woods
[15:06] or that he's calling us all to live in
[15:08] cabins apart from all other people or
[15:11] that he's calling us all to live
[15:13] communally but I do believe that he is
[15:16] calling his his group of overcomers the
[15:20] bride that we have talked about to a
[15:22] place of spirit to spirit communication
[15:26] with him so that we are so transformed
[15:29] from the inside out that we come into
[15:33] such harmony and cooperation with heaven
[15:36] that it brings us into harmony in that
[15:40] other realm that we've been chosen to
[15:42] function in the earthly realm we started
[15:46] introducing this series by saying man
[15:48] has been divinely created to function in
[15:53] two realms the earthly realm and the
[15:55] heavenly realm I believe this place of
[15:58] cooperation where God is calling us to
[16:01] come into a place that we be sensitive
[16:04] that we are sensitive to what's going on
[16:07] in heavenly places well how can we do
[16:09] that well we've been
[16:11] all to sit together in fellowship in
[16:14] heavenly places as we worship the Lord I
[16:17] really believe that there is a lot of
[16:20] activity that that's going on in the
[16:23] realm of the Holy Spirit in that
[16:25] spiritual dimension I believe in angels
[16:28] I don't worship angels I don't believe
[16:30] that we should let our focus be on
[16:32] angels but I do believe that angels are
[16:35] released to minister to strengthen to
[16:39] bring healing to bring words of
[16:41] encouragement words of instruction there
[16:44] even at times meant to warn of judgment
[16:47] we go through the scripture i think i've
[16:49] done a teaching with you here on the
[16:51] Eagles cry concerning some of the
[16:53] different ministries of angels that are
[16:56] outlined in the scripture and I believe
[16:59] that there's a lot of things going on
[17:01] around the throne of the Living God that
[17:03] if we could begin to tap into that if we
[17:06] could begin to discern when angels have
[17:09] come into our home or when when heavenly
[17:12] messengers have come into our services
[17:15] if we could discern that then perhaps we
[17:18] could humble ourselves lay aside our
[17:21] agendas come into a place of cooperation
[17:24] with the realm of the Spirit then I
[17:27] believe there would be impartation like
[17:30] we've never known I believe there would
[17:31] be power and authority released among
[17:35] the believers that we've only read about
[17:37] in times gone by in a few token examples
[17:41] even in the great healing revival in
[17:44] America spread around the world in the
[17:47] late 40s and and through the 50s it
[17:50] seemed yet even in that time to be
[17:53] through token vessels through examples
[17:56] but I believe we're about to enter into
[17:58] a spiritual era a spiritual season a
[18:03] Kairos moment and and what that means is
[18:07] a time of heightened spiritual activity
[18:10] we're there brother we're there we're
[18:12] living in a season of heightened
[18:14] spiritual activity and in times past
[18:17] we've not been able to get enough
[18:19] accomplished when revival would fall
[18:22] when a stirring would come to our
[18:24] churches when we
[18:25] see a real wind of the Spirit of God
[18:27] blowing we've not been able to get
[18:29] enough accomplished before the thing
[18:31] started lifting before man started
[18:33] trying to organize and kind of when that
[18:36] happens the Spirit of God starts with
[18:38] drawing and we see revivals dwindling
[18:40] away but I believe that there's coming a
[18:44] season to the body of Christ that's not
[18:47] going to dwindle that's not going to die
[18:49] out I believe there's a bride's revival
[18:52] on the horizon where a group of people
[18:55] are going to qualify they're going to be
[18:57] called up into a place where we will
[19:00] walk in such harmony in such cooperation
[19:03] with heavens agenda with the with the
[19:07] agenda of the Living God how will we do
[19:10] that we'll do that by having
[19:11] communication with God spirit the spirit
[19:15] did you do you understand what I'm
[19:18] saying when I tell you we were made to
[19:21] function in both the earthly realm and
[19:24] the heavenly realm the problem is we
[19:27] have lost our ability to function in the
[19:32] heavenly realm and God is restoring that
[19:34] it was potentially restored by the new
[19:38] birth the door was opened the way was
[19:40] made it is now possible for us to
[19:43] function dually in the earthly realm and
[19:47] in the heavenly realm but as we've been
[19:49] teaching over the past few weeks this
[19:51] grace this ability this gifting that
[19:55] we've been created with originally to
[19:57] function in the heavenly realm it was
[19:59] lost in the fall of Adam it was made
[20:02] available again by the death of the
[20:05] second Adam the sacrifice of the Lord
[20:07] Jesus Christ but in this hour it is a
[20:09] process now it is a development it is it
[20:13] is an exercise where the more we learn
[20:17] to lay our agenda just just some natural
[20:19] instruction now late start practicing
[20:23] laying your agenda down you can do that
[20:26] in prayer think of the things that you
[20:29] want to get accomplished and you start
[20:31] saying lord I submit that to you I lay
[20:32] that on the altar I want the fire of God
[20:35] to come and burn up my my thoughts even
[20:38] they seem Noble even if they seem like
[20:41] good thoughts if they're not God's
[20:43] thoughts they'll only hinder us from
[20:45] coming into that place of spirit to
[20:48] spirit communication and we want that
[20:50] you may have a good idea of going in
[20:52] winning the lost in such as such a
[20:55] nation but if that's not God's thoughts
[20:57] concerning you then by going and doing
[21:00] that you'll not bring yourself into a
[21:02] closer place of intimacy you in fact
[21:05] instead of a line in yourself you'll be
[21:07] disel ining yourself you'll be bringing
[21:10] dysfunction into your relationship the
[21:13] only way that we can walk in full
[21:15] functionality with the Spirit of God is
[21:19] to come into agreement with heavens
[21:21] agenda with God's ideas with the
[21:23] thoughts of God how does that happen by
[21:26] renewing our mind by allowing the Word
[21:29] of God and the Spirit of God to bring us
[21:32] into that new way of thinking that new
[21:37] way of leadership there is a leadership
[21:40] that God wants to bring forth in our
[21:42] life where he leads from the throne of
[21:45] our human spirit where he gives the the
[21:49] command where he gives the the
[21:52] leadership like the prophet of the of
[21:54] the Old Testament said to hear a word
[21:55] behind me saying this is the way waukee
[21:58] in it I really believe that the majority
[22:01] of those who call themselves believers
[22:05] are hungry for heavenly leadership for
[22:09] divine guidance we've tried it our way
[22:12] and it hasn't seemed to work and so now
[22:15] we're looking for God's Way you see Adam
[22:18] was placed in the garden and the Garden
[22:21] of Eden was sort of like a probationary
[22:23] environment he was really placed in a
[22:26] situation where he would be tested he
[22:29] would be tempted he would be tried and
[22:31] God knew that I want you to know that
[22:35] that did not escape the mind of God he
[22:38] knew exactly what was going to happen in
[22:41] Genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17 and
[22:45] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[22:47] every tree of the garden you may freely
[22:50] eat but of the tree of the knowledge
[22:52] good and evil you shall not eat of it
[22:54] for in the day that you eat thereof you
[22:57] shall surely die see it was a
[22:59] probationary environment God made Adam
[23:03] dependent on himself it was the plan of
[23:08] God that man recognized acknowledged and
[23:13] even celebrate his dependency on his
[23:17] creator and when I say celebrate I mean
[23:20] we should rejoice in the fact that that
[23:24] we cannot accomplish anything outside of
[23:27] the grace of God because if we
[23:29] accomplished something in the grace of
[23:31] God we know we've done God's will so
[23:34] it's really something to celebrate Adam
[23:36] could not learn to walk in the
[23:38] dependency until he had the opportunity
[23:41] to become independent that's why we are
[23:45] where we are right now Adam could not
[23:48] learn to function in that place of
[23:52] dependency long-term until he had the
[23:56] opportunity to live without it to live
[24:00] independent of his creator and that that
[24:03] is why we read about what happened in
[24:06] the Garden of Eden it was a probationary
[24:09] period it was a probationary environment
[24:12] God wanted Adam to be allowed if it was
[24:16] his choice to see what it would mean to
[24:19] be independent and in so doing he really
[24:22] lost that oneness from that moment on
[24:26] Eve took of the fruit she gave it to
[24:29] Adam she believed the lie of the of we
[24:33] could say of the serpent but the live
[24:35] did not originate with a serpent the lie
[24:38] originated with the devil the devil was
[24:40] using the serpent as a vessel that he
[24:43] could speak through but Eve believed the
[24:46] devil's lie and if you'll notice that
[24:48] even the lie was a great portion of
[24:52] truth with just a little discrepancy
[24:56] mixed in with the truth but it was a lie
[24:59] it was enough of a lie to bring her out
[25:02] of fellowship when Adam saw what she had
[25:04] done he took on her see
[25:06] he partook of what she had partaken of
[25:09] and therefore he faced God he faced God
[25:14] and it's a beautiful beautiful type of
[25:17] what our Lord Jesus Christ did now by
[25:21] walking in dependency his spirit could
[25:24] continue to have communion with the Lord
[25:26] but because of the fall he became
[25:29] independent he was driven out of the
[25:32] garden look look at Genesis 38 the
[25:35] beginning of it said and they heard the
[25:37] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[25:40] garden in the cool of the day when Adam
[25:43] for took of the tree of the knowledge of
[25:45] good and evil the part of adam this is
[25:47] very very important for where we're
[25:49] going in the study when Adam disobeyed
[25:53] when Adam took from the tree of the
[25:57] knowledge of good and evil he lost that
[26:00] part of himself which was spirit he lost
[26:07] a part if not all of his spirit life he
[26:12] began to function flesh and soul and the
[26:16] spirit life part of Adam ceased to
[26:20] function and what happened was that cut
[26:23] off his communion with God severed his
[26:29] communion with God Genesis 38 the second
[26:33] part of the verse said and Adam and his
[26:35] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[26:39] the Lord God see what happened the first
[26:42] part of that they had enjoyed their
[26:45] fellowship with God their communion with
[26:48] God now this spirit part of adam has
[26:52] died and he is hiding himself from the
[26:56] very thing that he wants loved so much
[27:00] friend that's why Jesus had to come
[27:03] because that fellowship that was lost
[27:08] between Adam and God had to be restored
[27:12] that fellowship had to be restored and I
[27:16] believe that it has been restored
[27:18] through
[27:19] the coming of the sacrificial lamb the
[27:21] Lord Jesus Christ but I believe that the
[27:24] body of Christ is not yet functioning in
[27:27] that place of communion that Adam walked
[27:32] in and that's why we want to learn more
[27:34] about it so that we can exercise the
[27:36] senses of our spirit man and we can come
[27:39] into that place of divine alignment and
[27:41] walk and commune with God in a way that
[27:44] Adam did in a way that the Lord Jesus
[27:46] did I'm looking for that I believe we're
[27:49] I believe we're moving into that cycle
[27:52] and into that season I want to pray for
[27:54] you right now father I just ask that you
[27:58] would take these words and that you
[28:01] would let them live in the hearts of
[28:04] those who have listened so carefully
[28:08] father I pray that you would not let
[28:11] them just be a lesson but that you would
[28:13] let them become a revelation by the
[28:15] power of the Holy Spirit I call for the
[28:18] awakening right now of the spirit of man
[28:22] those who are tuned in connected to what
[28:26] has been shared in these last few
[28:28] sessions together and I just call for
[28:31] the spirit man to awaken to rise up and
[28:34] to begin to receive the word of the Lord
[28:38] to bring each person into that place of
[28:43] divine alignment where the Spirit is
[28:47] connected with your spirit Oh hallelujah
[28:50] where we come into that place and out of
[28:53] that Lord we get the authority the end
[28:55] the Dominion that you gave to Adam even
[28:58] over the earthly environment even over
[29:00] the animal kingdom Lord father they're
[29:03] missionaries on the field right now who
[29:05] faced some of these same kinds of
[29:07] dangers of vicious animals and terrible
[29:10] weather patterns and lord I just pray
[29:12] that that you will raise up a company of
[29:15] people who recognized by the Spirit who
[29:19] they are and start living and
[29:21] functioning in the fullness of our place
[29:25] of communion and union with you
[29:29] hallelujah oh thank you Jesus
[29:32] Lord we just ask these things in your
[29:34] lovely name the name of Yeshua the Lord
[29:37] Jesus Christ amen and amen I pray that
[29:40] something is being imparted into your
[29:43] life right now that you're going to
[29:45] begin a spiritual Trek a spiritual
[29:48] journey like you've never been on before

[29:54] in you and you begin to step into the
[29:56] fullness of your destiny thank you for
