========================================

Description:
“I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.” John 15:1–2

Pastor Shelley delivered a powerful message centered on John 15, emphasizing the vital importance of staying connected to Jesus Christ, whom he described as the “lifeline.” He taught that feelings of spiritual disconnection don’t mean God has let go - He never does. The sermon stressed that while emotions fluctuate, faith and actively abiding in Christ’s Word provide constant connection. He urged believers to reject negative thoughts and hold fast to God’s promises regardless of circumstances.

your song may sound a little different than somebody else's song but you be who God has created you to be if you're loud don't be embarrassed that you're loud there's a lot of pipsqueak folks that you can't hear them when they talk even but if you're one of those well don't you be embarrassed if that's how God made you to be don't let it be some kind of intimidation or something that causes you to be that way but you worship God according to the dictates of your heart every church is Sovereign I'm so thankful that they don't have have to be cookie cutters of one another as long as the same gospel is being preached we can have Liberty to worship him tonight there's freedom for those who desire freedom I heard something that Hawk said I I think it was Hawk who was praying and and he said there's freedom in submission doesn't that sound like a paradox there's freedom in submission when we submit to the spirit of God we're free we're free when we surrender our rights and we claim his we are free I don't want to take much time for preliminaries because I came this evening with a word from the Lord and I want to do my best to deliver it to you although it does seem very strange to be in the service with sister Emily and not hear her sing will you be here in the morning perhaps all right bring a song Would you please bring a song in the morning we want to give thanks to God for the musicians that are here let's just be grateful so thankful for them their labor but I I didn't just come with a series or the fourth part of a series or the12th part of a Series tonight you know I can have I'm not quite I I'm not quite like brother Donnie he can take them a little bit longer than I can you know um Edition or so 256 of but uh I didn't come with that this evening I came with something that I know that I know that I know that I know is from the Lord and it's for you who is it for it's for you well how do you know it's for me because you're here and God knew who was going to be here I didn't know I got a surprise tonight I didn't know who was going to be here but God knew who would be in the house I want you to turn with me before you're seated to John chap 15 this has been an unusual week for many of us and um I I felt pretty good all day Monday and then at bedtime uh something hit and it was not pleasant and it kept me through the night up and awake and alert and uh left me extremely week I mean oddly so for a couple of days but I had to be in the we didn't have a meeting Tuesday night we thought well if this is something going around we don't want it to spread and so we didn't have a service here Tuesday night not trying to be unspiritual but we just thought it might be the right thing to do and a few other people did catch catch some variation or version of it and um it just felt like I I I don't want to overs spiritualize everything some things are just we just caught a virus sometimes it's just we just didn't take care of our immune system sometimes it's we had too much sugar but there are times that we can sense you and I both that there's something a little more Sinister involved and I sense that the enemy was just flat out agitated and when you know that the enemy is agitated you have a decision to make do you back off so he'll calm down or do you press through and I was taught by some prayer warriors when I was a child you don't back off when there's opposition when the enemy has come to distract you press against him and God will give you the victory several begin to say well maybe we should postpone maybe we shouldn't have the I didn't know who was coming we hadn't had a lot of uh communication that there would be very many people here but I spent most of the the night Friday night praying that God's perfect will would be done and I knew when I woke up that morning that it was his will I think it was Maybe Might Have Been Thursday night I'm pretty sure it was Thursday night and when I woke up I knew that it was his will for us to be here and that was going to have something for us but it wasn't until last evening that I began to experience in the night something uh otherworldly that let me know that there's a key for us some years ago I preached a series I don't remember how many there were sister Alfreda could remember 16 or 13 or 18 how many how many survival strategies were there do you remember how many 50 15 survival strategies for the end time well I can't I know you're just cringing because you're afraid I'm going to preach all 15 of them tonight uh 19 I think we did add some to the end brother Shaw I think you're right I want to give you one tonight it's the only one you need there's only one I only have one survival strategy for the end time and I want you to keep in mind that you're not to be survivors you are called to be Overcomers amen there's going to be a church in this hour that will scarcely be saved that will barely get through but there's a company of Overcomers sons of God and those who are a part of the bridal Paradigm who are not going to go out of here as as just survivors but they're going to go out of here having overcome the spirit of their age and I am glad to report to you tonight I'm one of them I'm not going out of here defeated by the spirit of This leod Dean age and to to the church write these things and to him that overcometh write these things so tonight I want to give you a word to him who overcometh to those who will not be satisfied with church anity but who desire a true experience with the Lord yes and if you're ready are you ready John chapter 15 I'll let you all control the volume seems a little loud but I'll let you all take care of that I do want to be heard John chapter 15 beginning in verse one Jesus all red letters I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman he's the one who takes care of The Vineyard every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it he prunes it that it may now now listen at the difference I know we're reading the scripture but I want you to capture the difference already you see because the same tool that separates the unfruitful Branch from the vine same tool is the same tool that prunes that purges a barely producing Vine so that it might be able to bring forth more fruit same pruning shears the same pruning shears that we use to cut off the dead wood yes we use to prune back so that the shrub can spread or so that the uh fruit or vegetable can flourish the Tomato for instance you're pulling off the suckers and you are it's hard to do it because the plant's already In Bloom and it's hard to cut off those blooms and see those Tomatoes wasted but you understand that if you don't bring strength to the bottom of the plant then by the time the plant begins to grow there'll be nothing to support it so it's better to cut it off and let it begin to Bush out and get strength at the bottom the same tool that's used to separate the unfruitful branch is used to prune the branch that is bearing but not bearing as much as it can he said now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you the word of God is a cleansing to us we are Washed by the Water of the word can you say Amen but now we're getting to the strategy to overcome in the end time it's so simple we will miss it if we don't look at it carefully abide in me Jesus abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide I'm reading it like a like a kindergarten teacher I'm not insinuating that I have to go that slow for you but I'm doing it because I want you to catch these familiar words tonight in a deeper Dimension that except it abide in the vine that's the only way the branch let me read it from the top abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me we're going all the way to verse six I am the vine Jesus is telling us I am the vine you're not the vine I'm the vine Jesus said you are the branches he that abideth in me Jesus and I in him the same bringeth forth if there's no fruit there's no abiding that's what he's telling us I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do let's say that without him I can do nothing do you believe that we get kind of arrogant sometime a little overconfident like we can do something you can't do anything I can't do anything without him let's not be seated until we read verse seven if if if if small word just a small little article here but pretty important in the context of this verse if a man abide not in me uh verse did I not read verse six I didn't excuse me sorry if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire that doesn't sound good and they are burned now here's here is what we've got to know tonight if ye if if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you've got a blank check ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you does anybody believe that word if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Papa we come to you tonight Desiring that every thought that you would have us to know tonight we can know it's our desire to hear whatever you would say to us in order for that to happen I've got to get out of the way and I need your help to do that tonight there's been quite a bit of prayer going up for this service we are gathered now in faith believing that you have something whether it feels simple it it it could be very simple but lord it's something that will help us to move forward in this hour of great opposition that opposer is no doubt among us our adversary is always faithful to be in church but we believe that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world may we push back the darkness in the authority of Jesus Christ may we put our eyes on him and receive Lord from your hand we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints saided amen you may be seated this evening but I pray that you'll have your attention directed toward the word if I were to take a subject for this evening or give it some sort of a title I would call it disconnection the life has been severed disconnection the life has been severed how many of you are familiar with the terminology feeling disconnected sir anybody ever felt disc disconnected let me give you a definition you probably don't need one but here's one anyhow feeling disconnected means experiencing a a sense of Detachment or separation from your surroundings people or even yourself often leading to feelings of isolation loneliness or a lack of connection to anything meaningful in your life anybody ever experience it can feel like you are observing your life from outside yourself not fully engaged in the moment but I'm not just talking about being emotionally disconnected I want to emphasize what it means when we are spiritually disconnected and so this is the definition of being spiritually disconnected it means experiencing a sense of separation from a higher power from your inner self or a feeling of lacking meaning or purpose in life often accompanied by a lack of connection to something larger than yourself for some its nature or Community for others it's almighty God and His word it is aom companied by a feeling of emptiness or disorientation in your spiritual practices beliefs or in your disciplines if I were to pull this congregation tonight I would say that most every one of us have experienced the EB and the flow of feeling connected and not feeling connected there are times when it feels like the Lord is so so close that you can almost feel him breathing down your neck and then there are other times that it seems like God is a million miles away from you notice I said seems like because he's not in the move business of moving to and fro I need to remind you that if God feels like he's 10,000 miles away somebody moved and I want you to know for sure it wasn't him because he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll go with you even to the end of the world I believe that promise tonight I believe that even as brother gy said tonight even when I don't feel him he's working even when I don't see him he's still working and so if there has been a disconnection if somebody has hung up the receiver if somebody has cut the line I want to ask you tonight who has cut us off when we feel spiritually disconnected is it ever because God has dropped the line are you sure you believe that yes it's never because God has dropped the line even when you don't feel him he's there even when you don't feel the connection he's there even when you don't sense the connection he's still there so if somebody hung up the phone who was it that hung up the phone I'm not here to condemn you tonight I'm here to let you know that God's not playing with you like you think he is sometime he's not the problem here he maintains a connection he's as close as the mention of his name all you have to do is breathe Jesus all you have to do is Think Jesus you don't even have to speak Jesus just think him in your mind just bring him into your heart just bring him into the Forefront of your thoughts and you'll know that he's there my old granny told me many years ago she said you ever feel like Jesus doesn't love you she said you go in the room now this is kind of silly advice but granny knew what she was talking about so she said if you ever feel like that he doesn't love you you go in a room shut the door look in the mirror and start telling the Lord I said well I won't be seeing the Lord she said I know that's the problem she said but you look in that mirror and you began to tell him Lord Jesus I love you Lord Jesus I love you Lord Jesus I love you I said you mean Big Mama I've got to say that over and over again she said say it until you really mean it until your heart is really connected Ed with your words and she said I guarantee you you may not hear him say anything but before you finish you ought to keep saying it meaning it I love you Jesus until you begin to sense something changing in you and if you're real careful she said you'll begin to hear him maybe not with an ear but in your spirit you'll begin to hear him Whispering back to you and I love you too and I love you too if he never tells you in an autal voice it's still the truth he loves you he's given everything for us come on and it's a miserable place to be when you pray and you can't feel the tug on the other end of the line right so what do we do in a moment like that do we give up do we pull back do do we stay home do we do we give up our spiritual discipline do we quit qu reading the Bible do we quit praying cuz we didn't feel it one time when we prayed well you can if you want to that's exactly what your adversary would have you to do he wants you to slack up and give up he wants you to look back but I'm here to tell you tonight you'll never overcome looking back the only way you'll ever overcome is to look straight ahead into the eyes that bled and died for you find him in his word find him at Calvary find him on the cross and know that the price is paid and justification means exactly what we know it means Redemption means exactly what we know it means just as if I'd never you never did it brother brandom said well you just never did it in the first place it's not even there it's not being held to your account because the blood the grace of God and the blood of Jesus has set you free somebody in this room tonight is dealing with a spiritual disconnection and our first reaction is to blame somebody it's just human nature you know the devil's really been fighting me and I feel disconnected come on now my life has taken a turn for the worst and I really feel disconnected my wife has said some bitter words to me and it's caused me to feel really disconnect from him from him we we say well I've been a little overlooked in the church and I'm beginning to feel quite disconnected my job is pressuring me and the stress is building and and I'm just feeling so disconnected I know you're acting like I you I you know I'm just making something up here I would dare say I'm not a betting man but I would dare say somebody in this room in the last seven days five days has said that thought that or said that I just feel so if you think that my tone or my attitude is to belittle you it it is in no way it is in no way designed to do that because I've been exactly where you are I know exactly what that feels like that you need him and he's silent I know exactly what it feels like when you go looking for him and you really can't find him not because he's not there but because you're not looking in the right places brother brandham talks about this God who who hides himself and reveals himself in simplicity and he said men will say where is God I don't see God I can't find God and he said they're stepping all over God because he's in every blade of grass he's in every Sunrise he's in every sunset he's in the mountain grandure come on he's in the rain he's in the storm he's in the flood he's in the drought he's in the flower he's in the tree come on you're looking for God he's hiding in simp it and guess what he will reveal himself to you in the same manner in Simplicity Church complicates it religion complicates it but faith will simplify it if you are disconnected if you are feeling disconnected tonight it is not because God has failed you it is not because God doesn't hear you it's not because God has let you down somebody has turned loose and God has not turned loose there's only two of us in this tug if God's still holding the Rope that's right you you you don't have to backslide to let go of the Rope you you don't have to stop going to church to let go on the Rope it's says if you quit letting him have preeminence in your thought thoughts if you stop letting him have preeminence in your decisions if you fail to worship I want you to know whether you like it or not you were created to worship God you were created to worship it's as much a part of who you are as you're designed to hear the word the emphasis is on the word and so therefore we have put the emphasis on preaching the emphasis should be on the word we have placed the emphasis on preaching and we have forgotten the necessity the need the joy that comes when we connect with him Spirit to spirit with worship it's not just a touch you need somebody said oh she was really crying oh she was really WIP in the snot I want you to know that means absolutely nothing about when what we're talking about tonight you can cry or not cry you can snot or not snot that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about a feeling or a goosebump or a sensation or the hair standing up on your on your arm what I'm talking about is a knowing I'm talking about faith by Revelation I know that I know that I know that even when I don't feel connected I am amen and if I have if I'm am not connected the only only possible reason is I have failed to [Music] abide it's abiding in him I had this experience and you know I'm not going to make a big production over it because there are so many critics there's so many people out there especially around the message who believe that you know uh Visions are over and dreams are over and you know and and only only the prophet could see no one else can see no one else can discern no one else can feel I'm so glad I know that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm so glad I know that there are still Sears in the bride of Christ who God deals with by seeing others he deals with by hearing come on but some he deals with by seeing and it's always been my way of communication with the Lord he would let me see something a dream a picture an image a vision some kind of something I don't want to spend time emphasizing it at all but in the night last night I had one of those things let's just call it that not put too much on it except that it was God letting me know there's a key for you in this I was standing on the bow of a of a boat uh I wouldn't call it a yacht but it was certainly more than I could afford I I could afford a dinghy or something like that a a a a blowup boat maybe but but it it wasn't it wasn't a steamliner you know it wasn't a it wasn't a like a like a river cruise boat or something like that but it was it it was a nice boat and I was standing on the on the bow of the boat and there were quite a few people around in fact I recognized some of you some of our own church people were there and there arose a storm it was a motor powerered boat not a not one powered with ores and there was a storm that that Rose and several were were tossed back and forth and everybody was looking for something to hold on to a uh you know some kind of something that was stable and and some were stumbling around and some were falling and some were holding on and and pulling others up that had stumbled and and fallen and it was just just went on and on sometimes these things can go on for quite a while and all of a sudden big waves began to come crashing over the the front of this big boat and it was literally taking people with it it was knocking people right in into the into the ocean right into the sea and I caught a glimpse of people Bob bobbling bobbing up and down like a cork in the water and and a fear struck my heart I here come another wave and and knock some other folks this way and I could see that some were doing pretty good uh treading water like a dog you know just really putting a lot of effort in it and I saw there some that were trying to to relax so they could kind of float and not struggle some some had had a strategy that if we if we just kind of relax is how do you relax when you're drowning you know but if I can relax a little I I I perhaps will last a little bit longer and I looked around to see if somebody was going to help ain't that strange and there was nobody there I don't know what happened to all the people that didn't look like they were all in the water but but uh there was nobody there to help and and I began to look for ropes I look for life jackets I look for what do you call the the round life preservers and all these different things and I found a few and I would toss them out the best I could but remember there's a storm and the boat is still it's still just dashing all around and I could look at people going under and coming to the top and sputtering and I start praying I catch myself and I began to call on the Lord and I said surely there's a Lifeline surely there's a Lifeline surely there's a Lifeline I kept saying it and I opened up this this deck box and and there was what looked like the strongest finest rope you'd ever seen in your life and I thought that is surely going to help us people were beginning to cry out and then I noticed there was some I didn't recognize that somehow we're in the water at the same time when I drug that heavy rope out of the deck box and began to try to figure how I would would unroll it and and get it into the water it changed in my hand and it became like a narrow Vine like a vining plant plant like a Twining plant and it it was such a disappointment to me in that moment because I thought I had this Mighty strong rope very capable rope and it seemed with that rope everyone could be spared but now it has changed into into some kind of little Vine that almost felt at times I'm moving it my hands over it it almost felt brittle like it would not stand up to the weight of one person tugging on it and and certainly more and and I Heard a Voice in all of this that said what are you going to do and I said well I'm going to work with what I have and I began to throw this out and as I threw it out into the water I saw people beginning to grab a hold of what looked like that skinny little Vine and I heard a voice that said it's John 15 they'll all be okay all right every one of them will be all right it's John 15 now I want you to know something I I don't I mean that was kind of even strange for me but I'm here to tell you tonight there is a Lifeline for you there are times that you may not see it or feel it there are times that if you saw it it might not look sufficient but but the answer for us is John 15 I am the vine you are the branches I'm not going to go into any more detail but there are some other interesting things that that happened in that experience but but I realize that the only safety the only escape the the only way out was if people would grab a hold of something that didn't even look like it had the strength to pull them out but it did because it was the vine it was the John 15 Vine it was the Jesus Vine I am the vine you are the branches if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can get out you can find rescue you can find Deliverance you can have your burden lifted you can come out from under the hurt and the wounds and the scars and the pain of what life has done and what religion has done and what churches have done and what preachers have done help me now you've got to get out from under the weight of all of that and take a hold of the vine even if it doesn't look like it'll be enough it'll be enough because it's the Living Vine it's the real Vine if you allow yourself to be disconnected in this late hour you are severing your life you're cutting yourself off from the very thing from the very thing that will give you overcoming strength and power help me now I'm not done help me I want you to hear this in the Amplified version of the Bible John 15:7 reads like this if you live in me abide vitally United to me we hear the prophet saying it's it's it's Unity time it's unifying time it's Union time it's time to be one it's time to be joined with him and I want you to know there's nothing that's nothing but the truth if you live in me abide vitally United to me Jesus said and my words remain they not only need to remain to abide to stay with you they need to be in the Forefront hello they need to have preeminence the word is the only thing I'm telling you God's word is the only thing that's going to be a Lifeline to us in the hour that we're living right now we're going to have to hold on to the word when it's comfortable we're going to have to hold on to the word when it's uncomfortable we're going to have look this way when it's uncomfortable we're going to have to hold on to the word when it feels good we're going to have to hold on to the word word when we don't feel anything we're going to have to hold on to the word because it's a John 15 Lifeline if you abide in me if you live in me and my words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts folks we're the only ones that can fulfill that part of this verse it's up to us to make sure that his words remain preeminent in our life it's up to us to Care it's up to us to take the effort to keep the word ever before us he doesn't hang up true he doesn't disconnect if we are disconnected and sometimes we are it's because we turn loose of the vine well I know brother but I I don't know what to do about it it's more simple than what we would like to think tonight we think that if we feel it simple if we see it as simple uh then it somehow delegitimizes what we're going through or it shrinks the seriousness of our problem it seems like we feel that our problems are so complicated and so complex there will have to be a complicated and complex solution but the reality is our mind is making it bigger than it is it's more simple than what we realize the greatest battle ever fought is not as complicated as we have tried to make it it's actually rather simple if you will abide in Jesus Christ and make sure that his words abide and remain in you and continue to live and Thrive and have preeminence in your heart then ask whatever you will [Applause] yes it's not a blank check for everybody you understand that don't you in the complete Jewish Bible I like Dr Stern's way of looking at this verse he said if you remain United with me and my words with you my words United with you then ask whatever you want and it will happen for you are you here Jesus didn't just say if you abide in me you shall ask what you will he also said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you John 157 isn't talking about the word abiding in your in your head head I'm not a counselor how do you manage as a pastor and and not be a counselor well it's rough it's really rough I'm not a real counselor I don't always know how to help people navigate the situation that they're in I always have felt like I need more training I need some somebody to guide me help me know how to perhaps talk people through their problems there's such an emphasis on that these days in the church and I fall short and I confess to you that I fall short in that area when someone I've I've already told you that when when dear sister Terell nearly 90 years old at the time insisted on going to the zoo with our small school children I I didn't want her to go not because she couldn't get about but because I I thought it should be about them and not about her you know this was years ago I was in my 20s so it was a long time ago give me a little Grace and I said now be careful sister Terell and we're getting the stool and we're helping the kids are out and ready to see you know they're ready to see lions and T ERS and bears and we're still trying to gather sister Terrell's purse and things together to get her out she's dressed in school uniform and she is just ready to be part Sister Williams will remember I'm sure she will and she gets out and as she starts out uh I'm on one side and somebody reached for her on the other side and she didn't want their help she only wanted my help see that's what the problem was and she jerked a little bit away from them and when she did her her uh shoe because oh she couldn't wear tennis shoes no no no she had you know like dress pumps on her something and that slick shoe hit that that last step and down she went before I could even catch her and I look down this kind of counselor I am I looked down and saw this look of excruciating pain on her face and the only thing I could think about was the disappointment of the students we're going to have to take her to the emergency room we'll be there all day there will be no elephants tigers and bears for any of these kids we're there to see Willie be the famous gorilla and so the only strategy that I could think of at the time I knew that if I went in with an extra amount of sympathy it would be bad I knew this precious sister and so I said a you're all right get up from there let's go on and before she knew it she had been hauled up we were halfway across a parking lot before she could resist and guess what she was all right yeah why was she all right she will to be I helped her will to be I helped her make up her mind I am you see a lot of people get offended when I try to counsel because sometimes I say stupid things like this they they describe this elaborate problem that they have and I have a tendency to say it's in your head nobody wants to hear that because you think that means they're making it up no no no they're not making it up let me tell you the real estate of your brain is a reality and it can be in your head and it can be real at the same time every problem that we have will hang us up if it just hangs in the head Jesus didn't say if my words abide in your head he's talking about a relationship with his words he's talking about Spirit to Spirit fellowship with his words he's talking about a trust I trust that your word is going to see me through it's real your pain is real your circumstances are real your problems are real but a lot of them reside between your two ears it's like the old sister in the church when I was a kid she'd stand up and she'd say you know I don't have a problem with anybody I love everybody the only person I have problems with the only one that hinders me in my life is the one who lives between my own two elbows how many of you understand that a lot of times it's not as dark as it looks it's not as bad as it feels God is on the throne God has never lost a battle God has never forgotten one of his children we're engraved in the palm of his hand he couldn't forget us if he wanted to we're inscribed there we're a part of him am I screaming too loud we're a part of him we share DNA with God that's what the Holy Ghost is you and I need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost somebody said don't you want to call it holy spirit sometimes I do sometimes I [Music] don't well they say well people can't relate to ghost well there's one ghost you need to relate to and that's the Holy Ghost that's the very life of Jesus Christ that's the very eternal spirit of the father now dwelling in the life of a Believer it's not the third person of a trinity it's all Mighty God fulfilling his desire he didn't just want to live above you as father or walk with you as Emmanuel he wanted to live inside of us and the only way he could do it is what he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you the extreme trinitarians like to use the verse I I I will not leave you comfort this you won't be alone I will send I'll pray and send another comforter that's good I like that he is that but I like where he said I will not leave I will I will come to to you I will come to you the same Spirit we we know we've heard that all that was in the father was poured into Jesus Christ Yeshua the son and all that was in Christ was emptied and poured out into his church on the day of Pentecost and we forget who this is living inside of us you may have a struggle with a man between your two elbows but I want you to know there's somebody else living in here that's come to solve every problem he's come to deliver you from every situation he's come to throw you a Lifeline amen a John 15 Lifeline if you'll abide in me if you'll take a hold of me I'll take a hold of you if you'll let my word remain in you I got are you here you're not talking about in your head it's something more than that it's in your spirit you see the real you is the inward man we're tripartate men we're made of three parts all one just like the godhead right three manifestations of the same God three but one you're you're three but one you're not three people you're not three people you're one person but you are Body Soul and Spirit you're Spirit soul and body depending on which direction you're moving in it's there it's for us it's important for us to know the real you as Inner Man the spirit man the word must abide not in your head it must abide in your spirit before it will produce results in your life life he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you to abide means to remain to stay not leaving look look Lord look I need you to know one thing G I'm not going anywhere I'm not going to be like Mary and Joseph I'm not going to leave you three days and not know you're [Music] gone I'm going to stay connected to you enough that if you if something's going a Miss in my walk with you in my relationship with you it's not going to take me 3 days to realize oh I'm not going to miss fellowship with you every single day of my life I'm going to pour myself into the word I'm going to find the time if I have to buy a dumb phone I'm going to find the time come on you get rid of the cable you can find the time you cancel your subscription to Netflix you can find the time there's no reason why we don't have the time we can make the time we make the time for disc golf we make the time to work a 9 to5 we make the time for coffee with friends we make the time you can make the time to Fellowship the word I don't want it to sound like I'm scolding you I'm not here tonight to scold you I'm here to tell you there's a lifel don't you let the devil convince you that God has disconnected from you he's holding on to you with everything that he's got you may not be able to hold on to your faith but your faith can hold on to you there are times we get that way remember the congressman said brother Brandon you lost your wife you lost your baby how did you hold on to your religion I didn't hold on to my religion it held on to me he's not talking about religion he's talking about faith he not talking about church anity he's talking about a real experience with God I I I I've been talking to my family and it just seems to me like that we don't see as many people getting the same kind of connection with God that we used to see I want you to know when I was born again at the age of seven it took I was fully inoculated it took didn't mean that the world didn't Flash before me it did right it didn't mean that well-meaning friends didn't want me to try their route they did on I agreed one time to to ride with with a buddy in his sports car in high school and I didn't know it but he had planned way more for me than a ride in a sports car I'll never forget it I'm going to be very transparent here you you're going to you're going to be you're going to be shocked to hear about your pastor riding around in a red sports car I I he said you like music I said oh yes I like music um uh uh uh weam I have a program on W they have they have good music you put on W he said are you kidding me he said I don't listen to Old Folk Music I said you better let me out right now he said I'm going to show you a different kind of music and he turned on something called Prince my little Holy Ghost mind didn't know what to do a prince in the Purple Rain I didn't want to be approved he knew me he was playing with me I made it through how did you make it through I was humming T so [Music] sweet he turned it up it blasting he said well if you don't like that one Stephen he said I've got another one called Jungle Love you hear those people laughing that's go they've heard it and it was monkeys on there CH making all kinds of Racket I said I don't believe I can stand this another hour it's no wonder people fry their brain it's no wonder people want the the the grossness of this life feeding their mind that's right on something that edifies lust and sex and drugs and and alcohol and being stoned out of your mind and don't you look at me you country music Buffs because you're just as bad Who's Cheating who and who's being true and whose car is parked next door and you can eat crackers in my bed anytime what do you think that means knock three times on the ceiling if you want me brother it's not edifying something it's not giving you something that's going to help you to hold on to your lifeline oh it's going to you mean you you mean you're going to be quiet tonight you know it's right you know it's right you know some of you young people and older ones too I'm not here to condemn you you know this you know this is right that's why you'll never have an excuse you'll never get by because you know better that's right but I feel so disconnected well buddy that's not the way to feel connected listening to that garbage come on brother you're feeding your soul your mind your will and your emotion but you're not feeling the feeding the real Spirit man who you really are if I were to go out in that parking lot crank up you're not this way you know but we're Southerners just just a switch or button a button now we really look silly when we say crank the car it's just a button pushing come on if I were to go out there and push your button how many of you would I hear garbage just garbage oh brother it's just George Jones it's just it's just Barbara mandre I I know you don't even know who these people are you know it's just in it just it just George straight and here is the excuse that Christian people keep using well they sing gospel too so did Elvis he sold his [Music] gift and so many others who had their star in the church that's right sold their gifts for popularity and so just because one out of 50 is a himym or one out of 50 is a inspirational message doesn't mean you need to be a Bonafide fan you can abide in the John 15 Vine you can't abide in Jesus and his word abide in you if you keep crowding out his words brother truth it is the truth it is the truth if you abide in me you've got to stay connected it pertains to our relationship and fellowship with him I know I know what they say just John 316 just you know just believe whosoever will just believe that's all it takes you believe you're all right it's okay let me tell you something we're not living in the Ephesian Church age we're not in the Philadelphian Church age we're at the ending of Leo deia the most wicked deceitful deceptive age the world has ever known I want you to know that it's very possible saints of God that what we all got by with last year we may not be able to get by with this year because we've got to overcome I've got to O I've got to overcome I've got to overcome somebody I've got to overcome [Applause] this word this message teaches that there is a total Deliverance [Music] available and church people are being woed into a stuper into a coma and being sold an idea that that's not attainable for you then the word is a lie then the message is deceitful because he said it is available and don't settle for anything [Music] less sir well if I only feed on pornography twice a year really really that's like saying if I step out only step out on my wife every every three months everything I she ought not to mind everything ought ought to be all right folks I know it's getting a little tight I know everybody's not into this kind of preaching I'm actually holding back I'm actually showing a little kindness to the visitor I can cut it a whole lot straighter than this and have been doing it for a long time but it's more urgent to do it now it's more urgent to remind you somebody say well I'm I'm picking up I are you are you using foul language yeah well I pick it up because of of those around me every everybody around me uses it I want you to know it doesn't matter if everybody in your life everybody in your family everybody on your job everybody in your school doesn't matter if you're the only one in the whole odd world that doesn't do it you don't have to do it and if you do it it's because somebody has disconnected no wonder you feel like I can't feel I just feel like I can't feel no wonder we can't feel we've desensitized ourselves we've forgotten to run to the altar we forgotten to run to God we' forgotten to Bow our really bow our knee we get caught up in this cycle anyway we we we we do the religious talk Colossians 127 you see this this let me tell you something this fellowshipping I got to hurry this fellowshipping and relationship with Jesus this abiding in him and his words abiding in you it's a part of the great mystery of Colossians 1:27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you in you the hope of glory when he lives in you you don't have to feel him he's there when you've got a revelation that he lives there it's not about hearing him not about feeling him not about seeing him right it's about knowing that he's there it's about taking him at his word it's about trusting him the issue is a trust issue and I can understand that Mama failed you and Daddy failed you and preachers have failed you and bosses have failed you and buddies have failed you and friends have failed you and neighbors have failed you but I want you to know you're taking it out on the only one that has never never failed you and he never will that's right he never will he never will he never will he never will fa he never will let go of you he would never will forget who you are he sees right where you are he knows exactly how you feel right now it's legitimate and it's real I'm not here to tell you that what you feel is not real I'm here to tell you there's a way out of that kind of a slump there's a way out of that coma there's a way out of that numbness Christ is a mystery of God paragraph 394 we don't have time to talk about all three but here's the second part 394 he said next secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory you see when you realize that it's the manifested Christ in you then you realize it doesn't matter about who's holding on to who or who's Leto who yeah what matters is the reality of the Revelation you're forcing him to that filth you're carrying him around to those junk places it's Christ in you the hope of glory and if he's really there thriving and manifesting his life in you you're desires change we were looking for a particular quote before the service brother gy couldn't locate I couldn't locate it Joshua couldn't locate it but he but but Joshua did find one and I thought it was particularly powerful brother braham's praying for somebody I don't know if I'll ever be to see it or he's getting ready to pray PR he said the devil has put these afflictions on you that's my father I'm his son you're his sons and daughters that's our father the devil has put these afflictions on you deny it deny it no one's saying that the the headaches aren't real and no one's saying that the infirmity is not real and no one is saying the Affliction is not real we're just telling you you got to choose to deny it when you deny it you cut off its life he goes on to say he has no legal rights that's what we need to remember we need to remember we need to remember he has no legal rights he's operating without a license he has no legal rights to do that he's only doing that because our unbelief permits him to do it we have all things in Christ Jesus and now we own it he said right now we're Sons and Daughters of God and the seeds of Abraham with an unconditional Covenant with the power of the Holy Ghost with the resurrection of Jesus with signs wonders and miracles working in the church Hallelujah brother I'm telling you he's a liar he's afraid of the word of God he's afraid of the power of God I want you to understand that your enemy does not have the power to cut you off from John 15 he only has the power granted to him by God and that which we allow him to have right in our own life he's no more than a tool in the hand of God to bring this little overcoming bride to the Perfection that is going let me tell you something we fear what we shouldn't fear he has gained access because of unbelief if we can deal with the unbelief tonight I grew up in Pentecost where everything was sin some thought drinking coffee was sin but they would eat two pieces of chocolate cake instead I told you about the preacher who preached against Coca-Cola but he went home and drank a Double Cola some believed it was sin for a woman to come to church without a hat some believed it was sin for a woman to come to church with a hat that's right and we were constantly trying to jump through the hoops and please everybody and really we weren't pleasing anybody we were making ourselves absolutely miserable and ing the whole the whole revelation of God's grace to us so when I heard brother random say the first time there's only one sin I knew he had to be off the word my little Pentecostal mind said I know good well there's more than one he said oh no there's only one that's unbelief all these other things are the attributes of unbelief we do what we do and play with what we play listen to what we listen feed what we feed watch what we watch see what we see hear what we hear because we're we are we are absolutely showing forth the attributes of our unbelief he has no legal right without the presence of unbelief if we can get the unbelief cut out tonight thank you brother thank you brother he said the notice 394 the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ now Christ manifested but you've got to remain in him and his words remain in you that's why going to church is important that's why reading your Bible every day is important brother bam suggest you lead it read at least one chapter in your Bible every day I promise you that if you will hold yourself to that small discipline of reading one chapter today before you know it you'll be reading more yes I know how the first few days will go forgive me this is a song book I haven't got my scripture printed out but let me show you I know how the first few days [Music] ago got my chapter read who got her [Music] done you'll be putting your little ticks on that you know somewhere you get your sheet you'll get your spreadsheet some of you get your uh note open on your phone with a little TI did it check mark got it done one chapter and you'll do that for a while oh this is a long one so I I'll do half today and half tomorrow I told so and so I'd be so and so let me tell you something some of you are late all the time you're never early you're going to be late for your funeral you probably late for your wedding the only reason why you're still that way is because people tolerate it if somebody would ever hold you accountable I mean really hold you accountable you'd be surprised what you can do when years ago I used to talk to people and I'd say if you pick out your outfit my goodness what about this assassin let's talk about that just one minute I I'm going to take a few minutes here what about that assassin how horrible how hideous how awful we don't know the story I don't care the I don't care the motive hidious awful horrible could have perhaps gotten by with it but he won't they're going to find him he's not in the system they've already got his DNA off of his water bottle but he's not in the system that's okay take a little longer they'll get him they're on it they're looking for him they wouldn't have even known what he looked like he was in the city 10 days and wore a mask until that last day when the little waitress at Starbucks flirted back and wanted to see his face and pretty boy just pulled his mask down and smiled a Playboy smile and the camera did he's on there hundreds of camera foot hundreds of different instances of him always in a mask and the commentator on the news said don't you just love vanity he said vanity will get you when nothing else will that's how the enemy Works he's so slick he'll try to fool us but he's defeated he is 100% defeated don't you let him have advantage in your life when that unbelief Creeps in do something about it get under the word this is why preaching is important this is why listening to the message is important that's why hearing the voice is important fathers you're doing something right when you bring your children to church instead of sending them to church a real man doesn't send his wife and children to church he brings them to church I've been around this thing long enough that I knew a bunch of men that wouldn't come in and sit in the church but they would bring their families to church and sit in the car till church was over I respected that because at least the children didn't beg to stay at home with [Music] Daddy and guess what would happen when the fire would get to fall in on the inside one by one you'd see the Curious come peeking in the door the next thing you know conviction would strike just get them on the property folks God knows how to do his business he knows how to get a hold of somebody's heart you if you'll keep bringing them you'll pass Something On to the Next Generation that'll make a difference in their life Romans 10:17 Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God I got to stop hello it's 8 809 in the message the greatest battle ever fault listen this carefully but your mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it remember when God breathed Spirit life Spirit breath into Adam Adam became a living Soul he was a body first then God added his spirit and when the spirit breath a ruach of God went into Adam he became a living Soul he was able to contact his environment around him mind will and emotions brother brandom is is giving us the right descriptions here your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it what the word of God it brings life into you into your spirit the what the word of God not the radio the word of God when that takes place listen listen when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifested in you that's the only way your your Fallen human Spirit can be regenerated and remade into the resurrected Spirit of Christ it has to come down that channel into you and so that it can then manifest in you he said and here's he tells us right here how to see that happen if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will yes the next paragraph then then what does that do he said from the middle of your heart which is the soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel from the spirit through the soul feeding the Mind feeding influencing the will influencing the emotion somebody said I thought it was the other way around you'll hear him say it both ways this is the biblical way this lines up with the very meaning of the word Body Soul and Spirit you receive the word of God into your spirit from that channel of inspiration and then it goes through your soul your mind it works through your mind that's why you got to be careful that your mind doesn't raise up to reject truth just because the first time you hear it you don't understand it don't you do that don't you let your misunderstanding cause you to reject something take it to the Lord take it to prayer and see if God won't Quicken it make it real then that word of God are you still here are you worn out can I have a few more minutes we're going to feed you a great big meal a wonderful time of food and fellowship in a moment or two I know that you're looking forward to that look forward to this first then it starts moving through the will and I want you to know that's where our trouble that is often the hitch in our get up that will that stubborn will that we that we reinforce instead of bringing it underneath submission to the word to the spirit it starts feeding out through the through the Mind through the will and then hear this just a moment and then hear this it starts filtering through the emotions and those emotions are not your enemy God gave you your emotions for a very powerful purpose they serve a very powerful purpose in your life there's nothing wrong with emotion except that you are not to be led by your emotion you are to be led by the word of God in your spirit in fact you're supposed to pull your emotions with you yes into truth your emotions will tell you you you don't feel anything so you must be disconnected what have you done the sirene starts going off woo and people who have sat under the revealed word of God for for for years for decades will start believing a lie I've committed the unpardonable sin woo woo woo I'm rejected woo woo it works for everyone else but me woo and then what do you do when that thought comes it's your responsibility to grab that thing right out of the air snatch it down and command in Jesus name you bow to the authority of God's word you're a liar I have not committed an unpardonable sin I have not blasphemed the Holy Ghost my sin is no greater than anybody else's sin and by the way devil what sin are you talking about anyway the grace of God the blood of Jesus has [Music] finished when all that's done do you feel different you may you often will do you always feel different no I can hear Brother random screaming more than once what the feelings have to do with it you see we've given them way more attention than they ought to have we've let things Lodge up here that we should have let burn off a long time ago are you still with me you've got to stop that he said the trouble of it is from the middle of the heart which is a soul from There Goes Forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt what that's the trouble I feel I'm being honest that's the trouble I feel right now that's why some of you are having such a hard time accepting such a simple truth something that you already know something that you could preach better than me but you're sitting there as though it has no effect as though it's not even sinking in and I'm telling you the reason for that is we have allowed unbelief to raise up in our hearts and if you filter the word through unbelief you won't believe any of it before it's over you find the website that says that ain't true and that ain't true and that ain't true and the next thing you'll know when these doubts were presented to me the first time it was we don't know whether we believe brother random or not okay that doesn't set off a bunch of alarms in my head the enemy doesn't want anybody to believe something something that'll help him God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief that's where the problem gets a little sticky doesn't it well I don't know about the bridge well I don't know about the cloud well I don't know about this well I don't know about that well I don't know about the picture and used to well I don't know about so that's one thing and you handle that problem another way next thing you know somebody says well I don't even know if the gifts and miracles are and and and and Supernatural power of God is for today you see what happened you started discounting anything that you heard that was Supernatural deciding there must be some other explanation for it the next thing you know you've opened up your heart to doubt I'm being honest here I'm just telling you how the seed of discrepancy works and the next thing you know well I thought I had a miracle I I thought God give me a miracle but you know maybe it was the medicine I I mean I I then the next thing you hear we we we we now believe in a trinity how do you go from doubt in the cloud to beli in the Trinity doubt in the Supernatural sign to believing that God's three people how do you go there do you hear what I'm saying you open up the door and the devil moves in suitcase and all there's got to be a way there's got to be a way to to to approach something that won't jeopardize every bit of Truth every bit of foundation that you have well I'm not even sure that baptism in the name of Jesus is right and I'm not even sure that immersion is right and I'm not even sure and and and my you go on and on and on and on and then you know we we we you want to find a church you got to find a place to worship or whever you go will you go to non- denomination will you go to baptist will you go to meth is what will you do what will you settle for when you know the truth I'll be honest I don't know how anybody could leave the revelation of Jesus Christ and and find their way back to some system some bunch of dead burdess I don't know how anybody could and and then the next thing you know no can't go can't go to charismatic can't go to Pentecostal because the one thing we did learn around the message is all that's of the devil what a shame brother Bram said I'm Pentecostal from the top of my head head to the souls of my feet not by denomination but by experience we need that Pentecostal experience a birth a new birth we need a new birth I I had one I'm not I'm not boasting I'm just telling I said to my family I don't even understand the language I I don't even understand what people say today who who people will testify musicians just be on guard we'll need you in an hour people will testify and they'll I got my help at camp meeting oh God moved for me at camp meeting he did so many things for me at camp meeting I just felt like a new creat I'm so thankful I believe it I'm I'm I'm so thankful for that and then the next thing you hear somebody I'm in the throws of Despair I can't find God my my manners are gone my language is like the gutter how do we how do we fall how do we how do we do it so quickly all I know is brother gy I know it's wrong to compare experiences we all have different experiences with God I'm I'm I'm ashamed I ever even started going down this road but I just wanted you to know he met me seven-year old boy Heaven came down filled my soul the Holy Ghost in fire occupied my life I didn't know all the truth I didn't have all the truth but it led me that's what the Holy Ghost will do it'll Lead You In guide you and direct you into all truth that's what the Holy Ghost will do but whatever it was that I got some say well it might have just been on your flesh some say well it might just been on your soul some might all I know is this from that moment until this there's never been anything out there that attracted me like this word hallelujah hallelujah we move from glory to glory from strink to shrink from Faith to Faith I know we slide back a little I know we get cold I know the flame flickers but I'm here to tell you tonight that even though the flame is flickered it has the fire of God in my heart has never gone out and if there was ever a time that I didn't feel connected to him I had let my mind get between me and God I let my junk get between me and God I let my thoughts get between me and God and I didn't hear sound counsel and I wouldn't listen to good help I decided that I I knew it better and I and somehow I I I would need something people even slide all the way back into this mentality that the blood is not enough it's enough it's enough if you'll surrender it's enough if you can only believe the grace of God is enough you don't have to hail Mary you don't have to pray the rosary you don't have to confess to a priest I could say a lot of other things you don't have to have the belt buckle you don't have to only press play and Obey it's the same kind of dogmas amen same kind of dogmas what you've got to do is just believe with if you can only believe you can only believe you don't have to lie about your doubt do what the man scripture said I preached whole series Lord I believe help thou my unbel I believe I believe let your spirit testify I believe the mind willing the motion says Lord help thou my unbelief are you here I'm closing you've got to stop that the trouble of it is we're standing here in a lot of Doubt trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that Channel with the true word of God and then it goes out itself automatically once it comes in it starts moving out it's what's on the inside he said that's the thing that counts is is the inside Satan approaches us from the inside birth pains you said well you got the same Choice today it's not just written words he's talking about he's talking about quickening living words in you you let God make one truth alive you let God make one truth alive to you and then hold on to that brother Bron said tell somebody tell somebody you let one truth be quickened to you by the Holy Ghost and then you testify he said if all you know how to do is tell somebody how your candle got lit tell it speak it confess it he said well you got the same Choice today she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word Bride As a woman is the part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word word of the Bible please don't come to us trying to convince us that every word that comes out of a prophet's mouth is infallible please don't try to tell us we don't see it in the Old Testament we don't see it in the New Testament I don't know why God was break his order today there is no Prophet who is inherent not even the pope but there is something I want you to know that is not that is not to pull down this glorious message that we have I needed it God sent it it is Daily's bread for me but I must understand that I can't take one thing and go out on a limb I must take everything that includes feelings and vision back to the word he said so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems dogmas or nothing added to it it'll have to be in an unadulterated pure virgin word right you see the way it works through the office of a prophet is revelation is Progressive they don't want you to say it but it's still the truth truth and that's why you can find a quote where he's preaching about preaching hell Eternal and then hell not Eternal that's why you can hear body S Body Spirit soul and Body Soul Spirit we come to different understanding at different times in our life somebody say well then if you can't trust it all you can't trust any of it well that's an awful rough thing to say because God's given us the absolute word so we take everything just right back to that word and guess what you're going to find it fitting in [Music] there Hallelujah so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems talk pure virgin word pure virgin word right now musicians are are truly coming CU it's not nice to have you up here I'm not ready to share this but I'm going to I haven't properly laid the foundation for it but I want to share just a few Thoughts with you and we can do it quickly I'm going to sometime tomorrow probably I'm going to try to give you some practical things that you can apply in your life that will help you to make sure that his words are abiding in you and and and and without laying a foundation let me say that one of those ways is to meditate on God's word to ponder it you see in Psalm 19:14 the psalmist said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my my strength and my redeemer and and I want to say this to you in the Old Testament two Hebrew words are translated as meditate it's up here for you to see one suggests you're going to find it very odd one suggests a low pitched muttering sound and the other means to be taken up or absorbed by something isn't that strange two different Hebrew words both of them translated in English meditate one means a low pitch muttering sound the other means to be taken up or absorbed by something taken together we get the idea of someone pondering a Biblical text quietly vocalizing it repeatedly did anybody hear sister joce's testimony the last testimony service she gave us her testimony of how this works in her life it gives us when we take those two meanings together it gives us the idea of someone pondering a Biblical text quietly vocalizing it repeatedly it can even mean to coup or to growl God forbid to utter a sound to moan you'll get throwed out of the Youth Camp if you're doing too much moaning in some places to read in an undertone to mutter while meditating to plot to speak to Proclaim it's a big word means a lot of different things I know that all theologians don't have it right but maybe ever now and then again they get something right so I I put this one definition here for you from ji Packer meditation is the activity of calling to mind and thinking over and dwelling on and applying to oneself the various things that one knows about the works and ways and purposes and Promises of God this is one way we can make sure that the word of God abides in us because we're abiding in it because we're pondering it meditation is the activity of calling to mind thinking over dwelling on applying to oneself the various things that one knows about the works and ways and purposes and Promises of God it goes it is an activity of holy thought consciously performed in the presence of God under the eye of God by the help of God as a means of communion with God isn't that good meditation based on God's word can have a tremendous effect on helping us overcome negative thought patterns are you here I want you if you didn't hear anything else come to alert please hear this psychologists recommend paying attention to your thought patterns I don't care about that you you might ought to consider some things it's a good idea let me just take that away instead of saying psychologist recommend pastors recommend does that make you feel more comfortable brother Shel recommends paying attention to your thought patterns yes sir when you recognize a negative pattern work to change your thoughts gradually won't happen overnight try to restructure the negative sentences that you repeat in your mind with something more positive what could possibly be more positive than thinking pondering and meditating on God's holy Words of Life come on changing a negative thought pattern takes approximately 21 days psychologist didn't say that brain scientist did takes 21 days to change a negative thought pattern especially a critical pattern in your life one that's a critical of critical nature meaning you are under a critical spirit so your mind keeps thinking these critical thoughts if you don't do something listen this is interesting to know if you don't do something with the information that you hear or receive any new information that you hear or receive if you don't do something with it within 24 to 48 hours that information will move out of your brain I've showed you as heat energy brain scientists have caught it on a brain scan it's like a tiny little flash of light leaves doesn't matter whether it's truth or not if it's truth if you don't revisit it if you don't put some effort to it if you don't make an effort to abide in it and let it abide in you that word of God will go right through you it'll just burn up like a little energy Flash in your mind that information will move out of your brain is heat energy you must start stabilizing this information by engaging it in some reinforcing way right I'm going to show you some things tomorrow how to do it this is how we form such great big negative thought Pathways in our brain literally by thinking the same wrong or negative thoughts of life again and again and again you see we rarely stop and analyze our thoughts most thoughts occur on autopilot in our subconscious when they come up from our subconscious we rarely take the time to decide whether they are positive or negative or even whether or not they're true or not true or just an unsubstantiated lie to stop them from being a habit we need to bring them into our Consciousness meaning we need to think about what we're thinking and that will make them malleable this simply means to do it with purpose stop and think about what you are thinking brain science is telling us that slowing down our thinking brings the thoughts into Consciousness making them adaptable adjustable and better than that replaceable am replace a lie with the absolute truth do it every time do it for 21 days make up your mind take one at a time Capture One negative thought whether it's I'm a loser I'm stupid I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a failure let me tell you something a failed business a failed marriage failing as a parent failing here or there or anywhere doesn't make you a failure that's right right there's not a person in this room that hasn't failed at something but that doesn't make you a failure if you're abiding in the word and the word abiding in you you are not a failure you are not defeated you're not a Survivor you're an overcomer greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world do you believe that it takes 21 days of this cycling for all the necessary protein changes and it is registered protein changes to happen to create a longterm integrated memory and the only answer that we have to replacing our negative thoughts is to use the word of God use it daily use it all the time every time don't let your mind agree with one thought that is not based in the reality of God's word people say things like I'm dying well we all are but that's not the confession that needs to be coming out of your mouth I'm not talking about mind over matter I'm not talking about Norman Vincent Peele I'm talking about winning the greatest battle ever fought the greatest battle ever fought was not fought at Normandy it wasn't fought in gu Canal it's being fought right now in the mind in the Battlefield of the Mind of the little bride of Jesus Christ the the enemy knows that he can't unson you he can't take you out from under your relationship with Jesus Christ but he can affect the fellowship that you have with Jesus by lying to you by accusing you and by causing you to feel disconnected you feel disconnected don't blame mama don't blame Daddy I don't even want you to blame yourself I want you to blame the enemy I want you to say you fou devil of hell you were created that God could use you to perfect me not defeat me I'm done with your Twisted truths I'm done with your half lies I am what God's word says I am when somebody I'm closing when somebody throws me a LIF line I'm not going to look at it and determine whether or not I think it has the strength to save my life that's right if it's a John 15 Lifeline if it's the truth that John 15 contains even if it don't look strong enough even if it doesn't look sufficient enough I'm going to take a hold of that Lifeline because you know what you'll find in your hands it'll become how could it be this easy how could it bring healing to mental illness how could it bring the end to my anxiety my panic attacks my depression how could it be that easy I don't know where anyone ever got the idea that we don't believe in medication medication serves a purpose we need it sometime sometime we don't have a stroke you know we just decide I I don't don't think I want to have a stroke so I'll maybe I'll take a little help I'll try to get a little exercise I'll try to eat a little better and I'll get a little help until I can get it under control the same thing with even even an emotional uh disruption or anxiety or sometimes and we understand that 100% and and and we would want you to do whatever you need to do to get you through this place yeah but that's short term it's short term because it doesn't take too long before the side effects begin to work against your body you can say Amen or om me or nothing doesn't matter now but I have a solution there is a Lifeline Jesus said I'm the vine you're the branches if you will stay connected to me and here's what we need to know the devil cannot cut you off he doesn't hold the pruning shears the devil cannot cut you off from the Vine I want you to say this right now the devil cannot cut me off from the vine what Vine Jesus the John 15 Vine I am the vine he can't he cannot cut me off he is not the husbandman the husbandman is the eternal spirit of the father Jesus said my father's the husbandman he's the one that had takes the pruning shears cuts off the dead Vine the dead Vines dead branches excuse me he's the one that cuts off the dead branches he's the one that cuts back and trims and prunes and purges those that aren't producing all the fruit that they need to produce it's it's the spirit of the father it's the eternal spirit of the Father the devil cannot kill you I know the church teach you something else the devil can't kill you you will never cause me to believe in a God who has created an enemy more powerful than himself that's not even logical it's not theological and it's certainly not logical God did not give the devil more power than he has so a better doctor a better Hospital a better that's not going to change things for you I know we do that sometime we think that way sometime if I could have only got my my mama to a better doctor we went to that old crazy hospital blah blah blah blah blah you need to understand as Believers God has a plan we do the best we can but life is a VOR these things are in his hands you understand that don't you from the scripture I want you to know that no one can cut you off the enemy only has the power that God allows him and in your life as an individual he only has power over you when you surrender your own authority right then he'll move in and brother he'll come in I'm telling you he'll bring the whole circus with him when he comes he won't come in this little stranger he'll come in with a whole circus he'll bring all the stuff that comes with it the all the stuff that comes with him he'll bring it to your life but he cannot cut you off and God cannot cut you off God cannot cut you off if his well I just don't like it when we put limits on God we didn't he put it there he said I will never leave you so if we are disconnected or more importantly if we feel right that we are disconnected God didn't do it and the reality is you can't even completely blame the devil and the only way that you can solve the whole problem problem is to make sure make sure make sure that you are abiding in him and that his words are abiding in you make sure that you're doing something with those thoughts if you can't do it on your own find somebody make them a sounding board tell me what to do with these thoughts somebody say I can never be that transparent you should if you need to be you should I don't know what to do with this so I'm going to tell you and then you help me turn it around you help me make something positive out of it with every Temptation with every every every Temptation with all of them every one of them amen amen amen he will do what make a way of Escape it's in our hands now I want to look over this congregation in closing tonight I want to talk to the young people the old people and everybody in between as a as a local body we've been in a in a strange place for a month we are processing tragedy misunderstanding persecution we're processing loss grief pain so many questions more questions it seems it answers but the reality is we only need one answer he's not a thought or an idea the word is a person his name is Jesus are you here are you with me so we come in with all kinds of different mindsets we come in in different spiritual conditions sometimes we come in encouraged why are you why do you sometimes come in encourage I'll tell you why because you've been doing the right thing you pulled your Journal out we'll get to it tomorrow you pulled your Journal out and you started reading about the things that God has spoken to your heart from his word you you you you you press you Press replay rewind in your mind and you started going over some things that God has done in your life sister Kathy had something extremely I'll leave it to her to share with you she wants to do so extremely disappointing happened just recently something that could have been very very very helpful in her life and it didn't turn out exactly like it should have most of the time when you put lawyers between you and the solution and you have to do it in situations like hers she was just part of a big big thing she didn't do it part of a big thing she was wronged taken advantage of and suffered much pain and physical problem s and surgeries and all kinds of stuff over that but you know who prospered not the poor people that suffered the in the inet right the attorneys when that word first came that it was going to be this instead of this it knocked the breath out of her she she did what you ought to do in a situation like that she reached out to somebody I don't I I pray that you don't feel like I'm betraying your confidence her exact testimony to me was I am so discouraged now that wasn't a lie that was a truth in that moment she was so discouraged so I started praying I shared with her what little bit I could and I reminded her of the goodness of God and I left her with it I don't live at her house she don't live at my my house I couldn't be with her the whole time it wasn't too long but the testimony started coming back you know I got to thinking how God is always provided how God is always seen me through how God has always made a way where there was no way how God has given me a miracle that I didn't expect here's something I expected didn't turn out like I expected all I need is for God to come and do something unexpected but I'm no longer discouraged I promise you I didn't lift her up I promise you it wasn't me who did that all she needed was just a little bit of a Lifeline a little bit of a sounding board and what she did was she just choked up on the Rope she just pulled herself up a little higher on the John 15 lifeline and she said I'm going to abide in him hello I'm going to trust in him I'm going to let his words abide in me yes come on this is the way life is it's full of disappointments yes don't you go an extra day now here's the excuse that some people use sometime around here my pastor is so tired I see that after he through preaching on a Sunday he doesn't hardly have the the strength sometime to pray for me let me tell you something that's true I'll be honest that's true but I'm not the only one in here who can get a prayer through so don't look at my Frailty don't look at where I am don't look at what I've gone through You Look to Him you come up anyway if you spent three or four days in a disconnected place if you spent 48 hours in a disconnected place if you've been 24 hours in a place where you feel like you can't reach up and get a hold of him get yourself up here after the word is preached I'm I need somebody to pray for me why are you so quiet I got to have prayer I got to have help I got to have it now remember you don't need a prophecy you don't need a word from the Lord you don't need to somebody to tell you what the problem is right you know what the problem is Sir you don't need all that thing you just need somebody to come alongside of you with their faith and say I'm going to pray that God will strengthen your grip don't you turn loose of the lifeline cuz how you feel is not what it is you young people you've been through a lot you're living in a in a in an evil hour I know that uh people like to compare generation with other generations with this generation it it it hardly Compares because evil is so accessible today filth is so accessible it's dangerous living living in leod deia but let me tell you something if you are a part of this final economy that God has designed this last day move of God this calling out of a bride to give her an overcoming power to get above the spirit of the age if you're a part of that if your name was found written in the Lamb's Book of of life before the foundation of the world before the lamb was ever slain if you are a part of that you win you make it through you finish well if you'll remember the word not 16 survival not 13 survival strategies not 19 survival strategies for the end time one catch the lifeline catch the John 15 Lifeline I am the you're the branches separated from me you'll dry up and die but if you let me abide my words abide in you as you abide in me Jesus said you'll overcome you won't always feel your connection but it'll be there it's just like that little boy let's stand woo sorry wow 9:00 wow did that happen fast you'll be like that little boy flying a kite above the clouds can't even see the kite got the string in his hand fellow comes by what are you doing son I'm flying a kite well I don't see a kite all I see is clouds it's up there how do you know it's up there it's up there sir Mr is up there I can't see it can you see it no no mister I can't see it but I know it's up there little fell how do you know it's up there he said CU ever now and again ever now and then I feel a little tug on the other end of the line come on church every now and then not all the time not every time I want to not every time I think I need to we don't live by feelings if we felt him every time we wanted to feel him or thought we should feel him we'd get spoiled and we wouldn't live by faith we'd live by feeling and feeling can fool you but faith will perfect you there's a difference so you won't always see him but you'll know he's there right because from time to time you'll feel that tug on the other end of the line reminding you there's somebody on the other end of this Lifeline who can fix it he can fix it if you've let your camp meeting Victory fade 30 days out you can find it again tonight if you have sat in this church or stood in this church week after week after week feeling disconnected I am not in any way trying to condemn you or Shrink the way that you have felt I just need you to know your answer is in your hand it's in your hand we'll stand with you we'll we'll bring our faith with you we'll pray with with you but the answer does not dep does not depend on your pastor or your family or your church family your answer depends on you in order to hold on to the lifeline you're going to have to turn your back on the past don't look at the winds or the waves I thought this thing will never save anybody they'll grab a hold of this it'll be brittle it'll fall apart in their hands but it wasn't what I thought it was it was way more than it looked oh tell them tell them tell them every one of them make it they can all make it if they'll hold on to John 15 hold on to the John 15 Lifeline that's what I've come to tell you tonight I I I want you to make every effort to make up your mind to do it we're going to just give you an opportunity to come we're not going to sing you here we're not going to beg you here we're only going to invite you here if you've got a need tonight come if there's something in your heart and the hour doesn't cause you to be afraid and you want the Lord to meet you I want you to come you're invited to come you can come and stand across this place we're going to worship Him and we're going to pray together we're going to add our faith with your faith we're going to believe that God is able the reason why why we don't always do it in a prayer line or something like that is because people start looking to that I want you to know there's going to be a time there'll be there'll be a place there'll be an hour that you can't get to a prayer line right right there may be a time that you can't get to a prayer partner you're going to have to be able to figure out how to get a hold of him for yourself he's here come on he's here I feel him yes he didn't bring us this far in this service down to walk out of here here he's here he's here and he'll help us if you want to be helped if you've fallen into a backsliding state a lukewarm state if you've lost your camp meeting joy and now you're in the in the throws of Despair if you've let the influence of others pull you down if you're listening to the wrong stuff hanging with the wrong crowd saying the wrong words you don't have to stay that way right there's a there's somebody throwing you a John 15 Lifeline tonight the King of Kings says I love you I care

tonight Lord you wanted to remind us that you're the lifeline you've not left us it's up to us to take a hold of the faith that's always been there we've always known that you were more than enough we've always known that it wasn't that easy to get lost since you revealed it to us Lord we've known it's not that easy to get lost but the enemy's lied he's certainly fooled and he's weighed us down but tonight we're taking a hold of the lifeline we're taking you at your word we're standing on every promise only believe we're going to read back over the things you have done the things we've seen you do we're going to remember how far you brought us and we're going to put our hope and trust that you're going to carry us the rest of the way if you're standing near someone that you feel comfortable enough that you just want to just as a point of contact sister to sister brother to brother just put a hand on a shoulder or an elbow or I I know some of you don't know each other that

circumstances have been so adverse the lies have been so many the pressure has been so heavy but Jesus is here to tell you tonight I am the [Music] lifeline the only way you can be fruitful the only way you can prosper in your spiritual life is to stay connected to that vine brother brandham told us that the branches bring bring forth fruit he said the vine doesn't bring forth any fruit of its own are it's the branches that bring forth the fruit and they can't do it unless they're connected it's the vine that supplies The Source it's the branches that bear the fruit I want somebody to tell the enemy to I'm tired of being fruitless I'm tired of being spiritually baren I've got a promise I'm about to go to war again with my promise I have messed up some things I have failed at some things but I'm going to start looking at me like Jesus looks at me HH he calls me his treasure he calls me his most prized possession he says that I belong to him and nobody else and he's jealous over me and he will not share me with another I'm about ready to spread my wings I've been melted in the Cocoon come on somebody feels just that way I've been melted in the Cocoon I am no longer what I what I [Music] was there's been a change in the Cocoon and I'm about ready ready to spread my wings but there's a little fear holding me back I'm weighted down with a little bit of fear of another false start somebody here tonight is struggling with a history of false starts you tell the Devil he's a [Music] liar doesn't matter how many you've had you don't have to have another amen make up your mind tonight I'm going to hold on to him yes I don't care how deep the waves get I don't care how the storm hows I don't care how the wind knocks me about I'm going to make sure that I hold on to him and I

Vine I didn't mean to turn loose I didn't know I turned L I'm not even sure I did but I'm here tonight to reconnect I'm here to take a hold of the lifeline yes I'm here tonight to hold [Music] on my victory is not found in something that God would give me that's not what victory you're looking for you're looking to win him your desire charity is to have him as your prize you want him to be formed in [Music] you you want to be changed from the inside out might be easy for somebody to misunderstand your need but you know your need your need is like my need like everybody else's need it's him it's him you need you know you belong to him you know that he's yours and you know that you're his the enemy has tried to get in the way he's tried to drag up a dead cat or two on the line to hinder the connection but I'm thankful tonight that it was God who said there's a Lifeline in the house I'm taking my stand in faith Jesus is my My Life Source I'm going to breathe him in him I'm going to live and move and breathe and have my being oh I'm a little weary with the cycles of life I want a victory that'll take me over some [Music] stuff oh Jesus she's looking for a victory a faith that overcomes Oh Come Lord come Lord tonight come and set oh come and satisfy that hey satisfy that woo [Music] [Music] [Music] mhm just going to take my stand just going to change my confession just a little bit I'm going to lean on the one who's more than enough that's where my fulfillment comes oh don't you be like somebody else who finds their fulfillment in some role or some something else even your marriage the one God gave you it's it's not enough never can be it wasn't designed to be enough to fulfill that real longing there's only one one thing that can fulfill that you were created for that purpose that Christ be your prize that he be the the Fulfillment of your life not your job not any office you hold a responsibility hold but he's the lifeline yes in the name of Jesus I've just been asking the Lord I know you've got the baby Jenner but I've just been asking the Lord who and I think I think I think it's supposed to be you would you just lay this I'm I want you all to know

surface again I've got to have him like the woman with the issue I've got to touch him anybody else feel a little desperation like that anybody else feel a witness to that hold up your hand wherever you are hold up your hand Lord I want to see that Supernatural hunger come back into my life like it once was there that desperation that drove me to Touch the Hem of your garment I had to get to where you [Music] are I want my hands full of Jesus I want to turn loose of stuff and things I want to lay down some things so that I can hold tighter to him let him manifest that to your to your life right now let him cause that Supernatural hunger to rise to the surface above some other things other things have tried to satisfy I want you to know other things will try to satisfy that longing but you were created to want him to desire him and he's the only one his word you abiding in him and his words abiding in you that's the only thing yes that will bring you true satisfaction [Music] turn

the Lord tonight to raise up your anoint your faith I'm asking him to anoint it as you begin to raise up your expectation God can do exceeding abundantly above that which we could even ask or thank
