TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he gave you the same kind of an invitation let's go jesus is he gave this follow me to the disciples and he did not tell them what they were going to run into when they got on that boat he didn't give them any details he said follow me or in this account that we read in the book of luke he said let us go to the other side of the lake he didn't give any specifics he didn't lay out the detail he didn't lay out anything that might happen between here and there but he said let's go he gave you the same kind of an invitation let's go and it has taken a measure of faith and at the beginning we have heard in time past that it probably was an intellectual faith that got you started on your road and because many people start out their journey with intellectual faith and think that that is the end of all of it they fall off by the wayside but there are those who know that intellectual faith is not going to be enough to get them to the end of the road and so god has to take you through fiery trials in order to hone that faith to get it to a place where that you can face the next trial jesus remember said let's go to the other side he didn't give him all the details he just said let's go to the other side and he went down in the ship and went to sleep but there on top now fighting the wind and the wave and jesus is asleep and maybe they tried for a while within themselves to row and to get this boat under control and maybe get it back to shore we don't know it doesn't give a lot of details it just says that they were the water was coming into the ship they was filled with water and they were in jeopardy they were having a hard time and they finally they finally went down into the boat and said master we perish [Music] he didn't get all out of sorts and say why did you wake me from my sleep and hey but he did say he as as they came to him and said master we perish he arose and he rebuked the wind the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm and then he said to them where is your faith but i have a heavenly father who wants you to arrive alive exhilarated by the experience that you go through you may not feel exhilarated when you're going through the trial through the test but god has a purpose that he's bringing you through all of that and he wants you to come to the other side of that so full of the spirit of god because we're being bombarded by the powers of darkness and we're we're sensing and feeling all of these things and and maybe maybe your highs and your lows are not like that i'm describing right here but that doesn't exclude you from the greatest battle that has ever been fought it doesn't exclude you from the fact that the enemy wants to kill you he wants to destroy you he wants to take you out he wants to derail you from your destiny he wants you to be detoured from your destiny but i know that my papa is his grooming sons he's grooming real men and real women that are full of the power of the living god because he wants you to arrive at your destiny alive
