[31:57] be sent.
[32:01] The [music] trumpet starts to blaze. And
[32:05] the saints [singing] erupt in praise.

[32:26] What else would I [music] do? Lord, I
[32:28] just want to give you my heart and my
[32:32] heart. [music]
[32:35] Oh Lord, for all that you done,
[32:39] the least I could [music] do
[32:42] is give you my heart.
[32:46] Hallelu [music]
[32:49] with hands lifted high. [music]
[32:52] What else?
[32:55] And I saw heaven open, [music] and
[32:57] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[33:00] upon him was called faithful and true.
[33:04] And in righteousness he doth judge and
[33:06] make war. His eyes were as a flame of
[33:09] fire, and on his head were many crowns,
[33:12] and he had a name written that no man
[33:14] knew but he himself. And he was clothed
[33:17] with a vesture dipped in blood. And his
[33:20] name is called the Word of God. And the
[33:23] armies, listen, and the armies which
[33:26] were in heaven followed him upon white
[33:28] horses clothed in fine linen, white as
[33:32] clean. And out of his mouth goeth a
[33:35] sharp two-edged sword, and with it a
[33:38] sharp sword, excuse me, and with it he
[33:41] should smite the nations, and he shall
[33:43] rule them with a rod of iron, and he
[33:46] treadth the wine press of the fierceness
[33:48] and wrath of Almighty God. Listen. And
[33:51] he hath on his vesture and on his thigh
[33:54] a name written, King of Kings and Lord
[33:59] of Lords. Sing that verse again.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is
[34:11] someday in skies above [music]
[34:14] God.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; On clouds [music] like stallions, he'll
[34:21] descend.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; The trumpet [music and singing] starts
[34:27] to blaze.
[34:29] The saints he robbed in praise. [music]
[34:32] The king is coming back again.
[34:37] [music]
[34:38] Yeah. And our king is coming back again.
[34:42] [music]
[34:44] Hallelujah.
[34:47] With hands [music] lifted high.
[34:50] What else would I do?
[34:54] my [music]
[34:55] heart
[34:57] and my heart.
[35:00] Lord, for all that you've done, [music]
[35:04] the least I could do
[35:08] is give you my heart.
[35:11] Oh, hallelu
[35:14] with hands [singing] lifted high.
[35:18] What else would I do
[35:22] but give you my heart
[35:25] and my hallelujah?
[35:28] Lord, for all that you've done,
[35:32] the least I [music] could do
[35:36] is give you my heart
[35:39] and my hallelu.

[36:20] you
[36:22] paid.

[40:55] Williams and brother Paul Drown and any
[40:59] of the other requests that have come
[41:01] that have been mentioned over the last
[41:02] few weeks but particularly believing God
[41:06] for complete miracles remember Jacob
[41:08] who's been having a difficult time
[41:11] health-wise but he's better doing better
[41:14] now but he's on shift today pray for him
[41:17] that God will help and strengthen him
[41:19] and many others who just need a mighty
[41:22] touch from God.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; So many things.
[41:31] It's already done.
[41:39] It's already done.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; The battle is over
[41:49] and victory is won. done. It's already
[41:55] done.
[42:00] I'm already healed.
[42:08] I'm already healed. [music]
[42:14] The battle is over
[42:18] and victory is won.
[42:22] It's already done.
[42:28] My family [singing] is [music] sealed.
[42:35] My family is sealed.
[42:42] The battle is over [singing]
[42:46] and victory is won.
[42:50] It's already done.
[42:56] [music]
[42:56] Oh, I'm already [singing]
[42:58] healed.
[43:11] The battle is over
[43:14] and victory is won.
[43:18] It's already done. Brother Daniel, would
[43:22] you come today? [music]
[43:25] It's already done.
[43:32] It's already done.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:39] &gt;&gt; The battle is over
[43:43] and victory.
[43:46] Oh, it's
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] yes, it is. This morning, I
[43:51] told the Lord if he wanted me to share
[43:53] what he spoke to me with you that Joshua
[43:55] would ask me to come pray this morning.
[43:57] And so, Joshua asked me to come pray.
[43:59] So, I'm going to tell you what the Lord
[44:01] said this morning to me while I was
[44:03] standing by the bush. The anointing was
[44:05] falling on Brother Shel. The anointing
[44:07] was falling on us all. I trust you could
[44:09] feel Jesus passing you because we've
[44:12] learned recently that the anointing is a
[44:14] person. Yes.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, as brother Benjamin was leading
[44:17] us, I heard the Lord say, "You need to
[44:19] stop in that brook that's praising me
[44:21] this morning, and you need to pick up
[44:23] some stones.
[44:25] You you you've thrown them carelessly.
[44:27] You've thrown them without purpose." and
[44:29] your enemy. Hear me. How many of you has
[44:31] ever faced a giant before? You got
[44:34] scared and you you went off a little too
[44:35] quick or you threw without him backing
[44:38] it. This morning, we're going to hear
[44:39] the word of the Lord this morning and
[44:41] it's going to raise our faith. But if
[44:43] you don't have anything to project at
[44:44] the enemy,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You got to have something in your hand,
[44:48] saints. Fill up whatever the giant has.
[44:52] Right? We heard this a few years ago
[44:54] that he stopped to pick up five stones
[44:56] cuz David had four brother or Goliath
[44:59] had four brothers. I'm sorry. I'm so
[45:00] excited under this anointing.
[45:04] Just don't want you to miss it this
[45:05] morning.
[45:07] The enemy has a soft spot about that
[45:10] big.
[45:12] I don't care that he's 10 foot tall. I
[45:14] don't care that he has 14inch feet. I
[45:16] don't care this morning. He's got a soft
[45:18] spot about as big as a mouse. All you've
[45:21] got to know is that by hearing the word
[45:24] of God, you receive revelation that the
[45:27] projectile will hit the target
[45:29] &gt;&gt; and you'll never have to deal with that
[45:32] giant again after today.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; I believe. Let's pray together. Heavenly
[45:41] Father, we love you this morning.
[45:46] [laughter and gasps]
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to be with us
[45:48] today, Lord. Thank you for sending a
[45:51] word in due season to help us overcome.
[45:54] May we not milly mouth around, Lord,
[45:57] with these things that we faced year in
[45:59] and year out. But may we be victorious
[46:02] by your grace and with your faith, Lord,
[46:04] with the revelation of your word, may we
[46:06] be overcomers today, Lord. May the
[46:09] things that we faced in our mind and the
[46:11] battles that we fought, may it be laid
[46:14] down for the last time, Lord. No more
[46:17] false starts. No more journeys around
[46:19] the mountain, Lord. Only up and into you
[46:22] today.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; We want to come up and into you, Lord.
[46:31] We want to take our place at your side.
[46:34] We want to give you our crowns, Lord. We
[46:36] know that you're the only one that
[46:38] deserves and earned it, Lord. We've done
[46:39] nothing to deserve or earn what you've
[46:42] given to us.
[46:44] We know that we can't be good enough. We
[46:46] know that there's no righteousness found
[46:48] in us, Lord. We know that adhering to
[46:50] the word is because we love you and we
[46:53] believe you, Lord, and that you never
[46:55] change. So, we ask you to speak the
[46:58] words of life that will take deep anchor
[47:01] in our heart that will give us the
[47:02] strength to raise our sling above our
[47:06] head and spin, Lord.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And in the name of Jesus,
[47:11] &gt;&gt; we'll have our victory.
[47:15] bring him down.
[47:20] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for taking
[47:23] those stripes for our healing, Lord. For
[47:26] every need in the body today, for
[47:28] brother Paul. Lord, we think of him and
[47:30] don't know that I've ever met him, Lord,
[47:32] but he's a brother. And I ask you, Lord,
[47:37] may the wings of faith pass by his place
[47:39] today.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Jesus.
[47:43] Thank you for victory today. In the name
[47:46] of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; It's already done.

[49:05] with the offering and go to the people?

[49:08] sing.
[49:10] Lord Jesus, just bless this tithe and
[49:11] offering. Use it for your kingdom and
[49:13] multiply it and give it back to the
[49:14] giver. In the name of Christ, I pray.
[49:16] Amen.

[56:07] and every service was the same. If every
[56:10] service in every church was the same,
[56:14] somehow along the way, it would lose its
[56:16] uh
[56:18] attractiveness
[56:20] and we would begin to take it for
[56:22] granted. Aren't you glad to know that we
[56:26] can let the spirit of the Lord move and
[56:28] have his way
[56:29] &gt;&gt; and he creates a uniqueness in every
[56:32] service
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and uh it makes us want to come back the
[56:36] next time to see what the Lord will do.
[56:41] I understand church order and I
[56:43] understand that brother Brandham brought
[56:46] it three times and as it went along it
[56:48] it got tighter and and tighter and I
[56:51] understand the purposes for it. But I
[56:54] also know that he kept saying to us,
[56:56] "Every church is sovereign."
[57:00] And and we're not in a in a denomination
[57:02] of any kind.
[57:04] And we we don't even want to be
[57:06] identified with those who are sort of
[57:08] building a denomination around the
[57:10] message.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; We're identified with the word.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; And uh I love freedom.
[57:18] I'm not looking for for uh you know,
[57:21] wildness or or um you know, someone
[57:25] trying to draw our attention or
[57:27] something like that. But I love that God
[57:29] has given us a place
[57:31] &gt;&gt; where we can sing. If we want to sing
[57:33] for 40 minutes
[57:35] &gt;&gt; and worship him as long as we're not
[57:37] performing, but we're doing it unto him,
[57:39] we can.
[57:42] And we don't get a head we don't get a
[57:44] call from headquarters
[57:47] &gt;&gt; that says you went a little long in the
[57:48] worship.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. The L L the Lord spoke
[57:54] into my heart like he does yours many,
[57:56] many times. But he's never ever yet told
[57:58] me, you worship me too much.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he lives in he inhabits
[58:06] the praises of his people.
[58:08] And a lot of people think that praise is
[58:10] just, you know, about giving unto the
[58:12] Lord. But we've learned through the
[58:14] years biblically that there are many,
[58:16] many purposes for our praise and
[58:18] worship. And sometimes it's actually
[58:21] giving liberty to another realm, to
[58:24] another host. And and they're moving in
[58:27] ways that we don't even understand.
[58:29] Sometimes it feels like there's a little
[58:31] waring going on. And I want you to know
[58:33] that that's over our heads all the time.
[58:35] We're just not aware of it. the kingdom
[58:38] of darkness and the kingdom of light
[58:40] advancing and moving and and uh you know
[58:43] withdrawing and pushing in. And I I'm
[58:46] just glad that we can uh know even when
[58:50] we don't know exactly what's happening,
[58:52] we can know that something is being
[58:54] accomplished. And I just want I know I
[58:57] kind of stumbled around, but I just
[58:58] wanted to tell you I feel so uh good
[59:01] today that something was accomplished
[59:05] &gt;&gt; in what what we were doing unto the
[59:07] Lord. I'm ready to hear the word.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I I'm looking forward to what God will
[59:13] say to us today. There's something
[59:15] moving among us. I believe it's him.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to sing this old song with me
[59:20] before we have brother John to come. and
[59:23] he has all the liberty and all the time
[59:26] that he needs. Tuesday night at 7
[59:29] o'clock, we'll be back here to worship
[59:31] the Lord, to hear the word. Friday
[59:33] evening at 6:00, we invite you to come
[59:36] and pay your respect uh for the memory
[59:40] of Sister Gert Hammond. And uh you know
[59:43] I find myself several times since she
[59:46] passed wishing that I would have known
[59:48] her through the years if I would have
[59:50] had that opportunity to have really
[59:53] known her through the years. But I'm
[59:55] thankful that we got to have the little
[59:57] bit of time with her that we did. And
[1:00:00] we're going to have a memorial. The
[1:00:02] family is coming in and and a meal
[1:00:05] after. And uh I'm just asking that the
[1:00:08] Lord would be lifted up. And if he's
[1:00:10] lifted up, he's still drawing.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I want to sing just a little bit of Born
[1:00:16] to Serve the Lord. Don't know what key.
[1:00:19] Sister Laurel or Sister Marbeth, anybody
[1:00:22] can tell me the key. Do you know? Well,
[1:00:26] I mean, I don't mean to ignore you. You
[1:00:28] might know the key, do you? From the
[1:00:31] dust
[1:00:33] of the earth, [singing]
[1:00:36] my God
[1:00:38] created man,
[1:00:41] but [music] it took his breath to
[1:00:44] [singing] make man a living [music]
[1:00:47] soul.
[1:00:51] For God so loved this world
[1:00:57] that he gave his only son
[1:01:02] and that and that is why I love him so.
[1:01:10] [singing and music]
[1:01:11] Let's sing it together. I was made in
[1:01:16] his likeness,
[1:01:18] created [singing]
[1:01:20] in [music] his image.
[1:01:24] For I I was born to serve the Lord.
[1:01:32] [music]
[1:01:33] Oh, I cannot
[1:01:37] deny him.
[1:01:39] I will always
[1:01:41] walk beside him for I
[1:01:47] I was born to serve the Lord. How many
[1:01:52] of you believe [music] that's your
[1:01:53] testimony? Oh yes, my hands, they
[1:01:57] [music] were made
[1:01:59] to help
[1:02:02] my neighbor.
[1:02:05] And my eyes
[1:02:08] were made to read God's
[1:02:11] [music and singing] word.
[1:02:15] Oh, and my feet they were [singing] made
[1:02:20] that I could walk
[1:02:23] in his footsteps.
[1:02:26] My body [music]
[1:02:28] is the temple of the Lord. [singing]
[1:02:33] What a privilege to know that today I
[1:02:36] was made [music]
[1:02:39] in his likeness,
[1:02:41] created
[1:02:44] in his [music] image.
[1:02:47] Oh, I I was [music] born to serve the
[1:02:53] Lord.
[1:02:56] Oh, and I can't can't deny him.
[1:03:02] I must always walk beside [music] him
[1:03:07] [singing]
[1:03:07] for I I was born [music]
[1:03:12] to serve the Lord. Let's bring the music
[1:03:15] down. I want to hear your voices. I was
[1:03:18] made
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; in his [singing] image. [music]
[1:03:29] For I
[1:03:32] was born to serve the Lord
[1:03:40] and I can'ty. [singing]
[1:03:46] I will always
[1:03:48] walk beside him. For I
[1:03:54] I was born
[1:03:57] to serve the Lord.
[1:04:04] I know I was and I know you're were you
[1:04:07] were. Give him another.
[1:04:10] Worthy.
[1:04:12] [applause]
[1:04:14] worthy.
[1:04:18] Let's stand again and show our honor and
[1:04:21] respect for the servant of the Lord that
[1:04:24] has come our way today. Uh I love the
[1:04:28] oldfashioned ring of his voice. And I
[1:04:31] like what he brought out last night so
[1:04:34] much. I feasted on it. Every time I woke
[1:04:37] up in the night, I was still going over
[1:04:39] it in my mind. And uh you know, we
[1:04:42] relate. We relate ourselves more to
[1:04:45] eagle than anything else. But I found
[1:04:47] out last night I'm the duck, too. I'm
[1:04:50] the duck, too.
[1:04:53] Because I got pretty close to the water
[1:04:55] one time. I thought I was a land lover,
[1:04:58] you know, until I got close and then I
[1:05:01] found out there's waters to swim in.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there were so many. And I told
[1:05:06] him as we were eating last night, uh, I
[1:05:09] love the stories and I love the examples
[1:05:12] and I love the analogies and that's what
[1:05:15] happens when you have been ministering
[1:05:17] as long as our brother has. Stretch your
[1:05:20] hand this way, would you? Father, in the
[1:05:23] name of Jesus, this is your gift. This
[1:05:26] is your son. And we thank you that
[1:05:29] you're allowing us to drink from this
[1:05:31] well. And we pray today that he will
[1:05:34] have strength a and wisdom and the
[1:05:37] leadership of the Lord to feed this body
[1:05:40] today. May the anointing of God stand
[1:05:43] beside him in this moment and come up
[1:05:46] like a well from the inside. We say
[1:05:49] spring up a well in the name of the Lord
[1:05:53] Jesus Christ. Isn't he good? Isn't God
[1:05:56] good?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Come on brother. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:06:00] welcome him this morning to come.
[1:06:07] [applause]
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Make sure to keep it close to your
[1:06:10] mouth.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I tell you what, shalom,
[1:06:15] little bride. [laughter]
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I must have done all right last
[1:06:20] night. You came back this morning.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just appreciate you so much. I
[1:06:26] love you so much from the bottom of my
[1:06:28] heart. I don't know if brother Shelley
[1:06:30] has ever felt this way, but you know, I
[1:06:32] have been places to preach where the
[1:06:35] Lord moved and you enjoyed the service
[1:06:37] and you left and you went back home
[1:06:39] [clears throat] and that was it. But
[1:06:42] it's different here and it's different a
[1:06:44] couple other places that I have been. I
[1:06:47] just feel part of you. I just feel so
[1:06:49] close to you. I feel like I'm part of
[1:06:52] you and you you just humble me. You just
[1:06:55] I I don't really don't know the words to
[1:06:57] say. I appreciate, brother Ben. The the
[1:06:59] song selection. Oh my, it was just
[1:07:02] perfect. It was just perfect. Amen.
[1:07:06] Because I tell you what, every bit of it
[1:07:08] just tells us where we are, what we're
[1:07:10] going through, what we have to look
[1:07:12] forward to, and and the great God that
[1:07:15] we serve this morning.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate him so much. Amen.
[1:07:19] Bringing greetings from the from the
[1:07:21] family and the little church at home.
[1:07:23] got texts and calls this morning said,
[1:07:25] "Tell everybody we love them and we miss
[1:07:27] them and you don't know them and
[1:07:29] probably most of them don't know you."
[1:07:31] Amen. But there's that kinship. Amen.
[1:07:34] That that goes far beyond be goes beyond
[1:07:37] the recognition of of bloodlines and
[1:07:39] amen. Goes into that special bloodline.
[1:07:43] Amen. That comes only from God. And we
[1:07:46] just appreciate it so much. So we we
[1:07:48] greet you in their name this morning. We
[1:07:50] just appreciate the Lord. won't keep you
[1:07:53] standing. [clears throat] Amen. Long, if
[1:07:55] you have your Bibles, let's turn to
[1:07:57] second Corinthians.
[1:07:59] Amen. And uh my there's been so many
[1:08:03] great brothers that have stood here
[1:08:05] along with your your ministry, local
[1:08:08] church, your minister, Brother Shelley
[1:08:09] and brother Greley. And and uh my I just
[1:08:13] I just feel so humbled to to share my
[1:08:16] little bit. And I guess you found out
[1:08:18] last night I don't preach like anybody
[1:08:20] else does.
[1:08:21] Amen. And uh sometime I uh I think I
[1:08:25] said it last night, but sometime I I uh
[1:08:28] battled in myself that way and I said,
[1:08:30] you know, I wish I could preach like so
[1:08:31] and so. And if I did, I probably would
[1:08:33] preach all the time and never stop. But
[1:08:36] you know, Brother Henry Green told me
[1:08:38] one time, he said, "Brother Johnny,
[1:08:39] God's a God of variety." Amen. Nobody's
[1:08:42] the same. You can't say it like I say
[1:08:44] it. Aren't you glad for that? And I
[1:08:46] can't say it like Brother Shelley or
[1:08:47] Brother Gley or some of these other
[1:08:49] brothers. is I I just can't get the
[1:08:51] words to come out that way. Amen. So,
[1:08:54] just you you don't hold that against me.
[1:08:56] Okay. Amen. But let's just worship the
[1:08:59] Lord. 2 Corinthians chapter 10. We'll
[1:09:01] read a few verses there and maybe turn
[1:09:03] over to First Peter for one verse there.
[1:09:06] Amen. Chapter 10, verse one.
[1:09:08] [clears throat] Amen. Now I Paul was
[1:09:11] myself beseech you by the meekness and
[1:09:13] the gentleness of Christ who in presence
[1:09:16] and base among you. But being absent and
[1:09:19] bold toward you, I beseech you that I
[1:09:22] may not be bold when I am present with
[1:09:25] that confidence wherewith I think to be
[1:09:28] bold against some which think of us as
[1:09:31] if we walked according to the flesh. For
[1:09:34] we walk for though we walk in the flesh.
[1:09:38] That's us. Amen. We do not war after the
[1:09:42] flesh. For the weapons of our warfare
[1:09:44] are not carnal, but mighty through God
[1:09:47] the pulling down of the strongholds,
[1:09:50] casting down imagination and every high
[1:09:52] thing that exaltth itself against the
[1:09:55] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:09:57] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:10:00] of Christ. And if you'll turn over to
[1:10:03] first Peter,
[1:10:05] [clears throat] amen, chapter 4, let me
[1:10:08] read you just one verse there. Amen. For
[1:10:11] as much, verse number one, for as much
[1:10:13] then as Christ has suffered for us in
[1:10:16] the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with
[1:10:19] the same mind. For he hath suffered in
[1:10:22] the flesh hath ceased from sin. May God
[1:10:25] add his blessings to his word as you
[1:10:28] have your seat today. As I said, you
[1:10:30] know, we've had and you've had many
[1:10:32] great ministers to to stand here and
[1:10:34] preach to you and none [clears throat]
[1:10:36] any more than I have enjoyed than
[1:10:38] Brother Dwayne Jackson. Amen. When we're
[1:10:41] here for the for the celebration and and
[1:10:44] my [clears throat] and uh I kind of pull
[1:10:46] a little bit from Brother Dwayne. He
[1:10:48] kind of made me feel like I wasn't so
[1:10:50] much out of place. But every one of you
[1:10:53] this morning, Amen. Remember how he
[1:10:55] walked down this aisle? Amen. uh believe
[1:10:58] it was on a Thursday night and he
[1:10:59] whipped out that badge.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Does anybody happen to remember that?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and it put something in
[1:11:07] your mind so that you could remember.
[1:11:09] And he went on and it wasn't so much
[1:11:11] about the badge, but it was about what
[1:11:14] that badge stood for.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh nobody's in in trouble. You
[1:11:20] forgive me if I have to lay that down a
[1:11:22] moment, but nobody's in trouble this
[1:11:24] morning except the devil.
[1:11:26] Amen. Nobody has to worry about anything
[1:11:29] except the devil. But you know, we read
[1:11:32] the scripture. Amen. Here. Wherefore, as
[1:11:34] much then as Christ has suffered, Amen.
[1:11:38] in the flesh,
[1:11:40] let us arm ourselves.
[1:11:49] [laughter]
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Let us arm ourselves.
[1:11:55] Amen. Now, if you're packing, don't be
[1:11:58] afraid. [laughter]
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing we're packing this
[1:12:03] morning is the word of God.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; My granddaughter, when I preached this
[1:12:08] message back home, she calls me Baba and
[1:12:11] she looked at her daddy. She said, "Baba
[1:12:13] or daddy?" Why is Baba got a gun on in
[1:12:16] church?
[1:12:18] But my my Bible, the King James version
[1:12:21] says, "Arm yourselves. Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That word arm according to the
[1:12:27] dictionary says to provide yourself with
[1:12:30] the equipment or the knowledge in order
[1:12:33] to compete or to complete a particular
[1:12:36] task to enter into a state of readiness
[1:12:39] for war.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; I've got news for you, church. If you're
[1:12:43] not aware of it before now, you're in a
[1:12:46] battle. That's why I I appreciate the
[1:12:49] song selection this morning. We're in a
[1:12:51] battle. Amen. And the the battle that
[1:12:54] we're fighting today, Amen, is with an
[1:12:57] adversary, with an enemy that is
[1:12:59] wellqualified.
[1:13:00] He didn't start this thing yesterday.
[1:13:03] He's been fighting this battle. He's
[1:13:05] been doing this all the way from the
[1:13:07] Garden of Eden. And even before, Amen.
[1:13:11] He's been fighting. He knows me. He
[1:13:13] knows you. He knows my weaknesses. He
[1:13:16] knows your weaknesses. And he doesn't
[1:13:18] play fair. He will kick you when you're
[1:13:21] down. He will step on you when you're
[1:13:23] hurted. He will probe you when you're in
[1:13:26] trouble. Amen. He will pull down
[1:13:28] everything that he can. Amen. To defeat
[1:13:31] you because that's his objective in this
[1:13:33] life.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Arm yourselves." Amen.
[1:13:39] That you might be able to overcome, that
[1:13:42] you might a be able, Amen. to bring down
[1:13:45] the strongholds, the imagination. You
[1:13:47] know, uh uh listen, church, he he is a
[1:13:50] worthy adversary.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But greater is he that's in you
[1:13:56] than he that's in the world. How many
[1:13:58] believe that? Amen. Greater is he that's
[1:14:01] in you than he that is in the world.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. Greater is he that's
[1:14:08] in you than he that is in the world.
[1:14:10] Amen. So, we're going to arm oursel in
[1:14:13] order to fight this battle. We're
[1:14:15] fighting an uncontraditional,
[1:14:17] unconventional enemy. Amen. I said he
[1:14:20] doesn't fight fair. Amen. But it doesn't
[1:14:23] matter. You know, when I was growing up,
[1:14:25] I was always a small and everybody Amen.
[1:14:27] always picked on me and and and and and
[1:14:30] took advantage of me because I was
[1:14:32] always kind of timid and I was always a
[1:14:35] little smaller. and and one particular
[1:14:37] bully bullied me all the time until one
[1:14:39] day he came up and he grabbed me by the
[1:14:41] by the shirt collar and he started
[1:14:44] making all these threats and whatever
[1:14:46] and I waxed bold brother I reached out
[1:14:48] and I grabbed him by the shirt collar.
[1:14:51] So there we were
[1:14:53] and I realized at that moment it was do
[1:14:55] or die. Amen. And I let Lucy give him
[1:14:58] one of the best punches I could ever
[1:15:00] come up with. And for years later when
[1:15:02] I'd meet him, he said, "I never will
[1:15:04] forget how you whipped me that day on
[1:15:06] the playground."
[1:15:08] Amen. I want the devil to remember.
[1:15:11] Amen. Every time that we put him on the
[1:15:14] sole of our feet and we said, "Devil,
[1:15:16] this is where you belong. He doesn't
[1:15:19] belong in your life. He has no place in
[1:15:22] your life. He has no place in your
[1:15:24] worship. He belongs under your feet
[1:15:27] today."
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I realize I'm in Alabama, but I got news
[1:15:36] for you. Ain't nobody ever been shot
[1:15:38] with an empty holster.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may look dangerous, but you
[1:15:44] haven't got anything to fight with.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; You may have an appearance. You may have
[1:15:49] a form of godliness. Amen. But you're
[1:15:52] never going to kill anybody with an
[1:15:53] empty holster. Amen. Arm yourself with
[1:15:57] something. Amen. That will overcome.
[1:15:59] Kill that enemy before he kills you. Now
[1:16:02] listen, I'm not I'm not instigating a a
[1:16:04] a a revolution here only against hell.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Only against hell. Amen. But that empty
[1:16:11] holster has never killed anybody. Amen.
[1:16:14] You have to you might have the
[1:16:15] appearance of being dangerous. Uh-huh.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 3 said, "In the
[1:16:22] last days, men would depart from the
[1:16:23] faith, having a form of godliness.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Looking like they could do something."
[1:16:30] Amen. Looking like they they believe
[1:16:32] God. Looking like they're serving God.
[1:16:35] But you know, there's not much there's
[1:16:36] not much power in form.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; There's there's there's not not much
[1:16:42] power in fashion. Amen. But there's
[1:16:45] power in the word of God. There's power
[1:16:48] in truth this morning. There's power in
[1:16:50] faith. As brother Shelley said, there's
[1:16:52] that faith is is is the main is the main
[1:16:55] weapon that we can have this morning.
[1:16:57] You know, the enemy can use all these
[1:17:00] these these windows to our soul.
[1:17:02] Imagination, intellectual and what we
[1:17:05] see and what we hear and what we think
[1:17:07] and what we use all of those against us.
[1:17:10] But we've got one that is greater than
[1:17:12] any of them, and that is faith in the
[1:17:13] word of God. Do I really believe what
[1:17:16] God said? Do I really believe that God
[1:17:18] can do what he said he could do? Amen.
[1:17:20] But listen, they'll deny the power.
[1:17:22] They'll they they'll have a form of
[1:17:24] godliness, but denying the power of
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "Men draw near with their
[1:17:30] lips, but their hearts far from me."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Their hearts are far from me.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a volunteer in this
[1:17:39] army. Amen. I didn't want to be drafted.
[1:17:41] I want to be vol. I wanted to volunteer.
[1:17:44] I remember my dad, you know, during
[1:17:45] World War II when after the uh Pearl
[1:17:48] Harbor was bombed, amen, the young men
[1:17:50] because their their their country had
[1:17:52] been threatened, their livelihood had
[1:17:54] been threatened, they begin to
[1:17:56] volunteer. Any volunteers today? Amen.
[1:17:59] Some people wait sit back and they wait
[1:18:01] to be drafted. Some people, amen, might
[1:18:04] even take off and run to another country
[1:18:06] because they don't want to serve. I tell
[1:18:08] you what we need to be. We need to be
[1:18:10] people that are ready to fight the
[1:18:12] battle that God has laid out before us.
[1:18:14] Amen. We need to go into battle, brother
[1:18:16] Steve. Amen. With a hero mentality. I
[1:18:19] want to be the one that comes out with
[1:18:21] all the medals. I want to be the one
[1:18:22] that comes out that has done something
[1:18:24] for God. I don't want to be just an
[1:18:27] average Christian. I want to be a bride
[1:18:29] Christian. I want to be an overcomer.
[1:18:32] Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[1:18:34] sit on the throne as I have overcome and
[1:18:37] sit down on the throne with my father.
[1:18:39] That's what I'm longing for.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; But you know, we can have all the
[1:18:45] appearance. We can have all the the the
[1:18:47] the the holster and whatever. We may we
[1:18:50] may look dangerous and and and and
[1:18:52] whatever and none of that's really going
[1:18:54] to matter. But let me tell you
[1:18:55] something. You pick up one of these and
[1:18:58] you start waving it around and you look
[1:19:00] more a little more dangerous. Amen.
[1:19:03] People are asking theirelves, "Is that
[1:19:04] thing loaded?"
[1:19:06] Don't Don't go to sleep.
[1:19:10] Don't go to sleep. Amen.
[1:19:14] But you pick up one of these and you
[1:19:15] start waving around. Amen. And you look
[1:19:18] a little more dangerous. Can I get an
[1:19:20] amen? You look you look like you could
[1:19:23] do a little more damage if you have one
[1:19:25] of these around. Amen. So, you've got
[1:19:28] you've got the mechanics of it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got the mechanics. You
[1:19:32] know, we we've got the word. Amen. The
[1:19:35] word's been given to us today, but it
[1:19:37] just this is not enough.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I know I've got your minds going like
[1:19:47] you. You're sitting there saying,
[1:19:48] "Where's Brother Johnny going now?"
[1:19:50] Amen. But when we pick up one of these,
[1:19:52] we get we get people's attention. Amen.
[1:19:55] I I seen some eyes get real big. Amen. I
[1:19:58] started strapping it. Where what's this
[1:20:00] going to happen? Where's this going to
[1:20:02] go? You'll never forget this message.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You'll never forget this. But brother
[1:20:07] Greley, I don't want you to remember
[1:20:09] this message because of this. I want you
[1:20:11] to remember this message because of the
[1:20:13] word. Amen. And what I'm trying to get
[1:20:15] you to say, I'm sure brother Dwayne
[1:20:17] would tell you the same thing. I don't
[1:20:19] want you to remember this message
[1:20:20] because of the badge, but remember this
[1:20:22] message because of the authority that
[1:20:24] that badge carries. Remember this
[1:20:26] message this morning because of the
[1:20:28] power of the word that you possess this
[1:20:30] morning to defeat the enemy that would
[1:20:32] come against you?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that's ever had a
[1:20:36] problem? Am I the only one that's going
[1:20:38] through a battle? Just about every day
[1:20:40] of my life, the devil comes with
[1:20:42] something you to raise up and to rise up
[1:20:44] against me. Whether it be a mental
[1:20:46] thing, whether it be a physical thing,
[1:20:48] whatever it is, he comes with every day.
[1:20:50] You know, when you wake up in the
[1:20:52] morning,
[1:20:54] how many times have we heard it said
[1:20:56] when we wake up in the morning, the
[1:20:58] devil ought to say, "Oh no, there he is
[1:21:00] again." Amen. But let me tell you
[1:21:02] something. When you wake up in the
[1:21:03] morning, the devil stand said, "Uh-huh.
[1:21:05] I know you. I've seen you before. I know
[1:21:07] what your weakness is."
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, God knows me. So does
[1:21:14] the devil.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; So does the devil. Amen. Now I I I
[1:21:18] [laughter] don't I I I hate to give
[1:21:20] credit to to him where he is. Amen. But
[1:21:23] you know that's the way it is sometime.
[1:21:24] He does know you and I.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; It's not about looks.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not we're not bride because
[1:21:35] of looks.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your long dresses,
[1:21:38] sisters, or your long hair or or the
[1:21:40] neatness that you brothers. Those things
[1:21:43] matter. Yes, sir. Amen. But that doesn't
[1:21:45] make you bride. Amen. That that doesn't
[1:21:48] make you holiness and whatever. I know
[1:21:50] Baptist people that dress a lot holier
[1:21:52] than some of the message people do.
[1:21:54] Forgive me for saying that, but it's the
[1:21:56] truth.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you may have the mechanics.
[1:21:59] You may have the holster. You may have
[1:22:01] the You may have the firearm. Amen. And
[1:22:03] that all looks good. And that is the
[1:22:05] mechanics of it.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And I may wave it around. And I may
[1:22:12] throw it at you. I may scare you a
[1:22:13] little bit, but after a while, you're
[1:22:15] going to have to realize you're going to
[1:22:16] have to kill that giant. Thank you,
[1:22:18] brother.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. After a while, you're going to
[1:22:20] have to realize that it's going to take
[1:22:22] more than all of that.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; After a while, you're going to have to
[1:22:27] reach down deep in your pocket and get
[1:22:30] one of these.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Now you look dangerous.
[1:22:35] Now the the situation has changed. Amen.
[1:22:38] when he comes against you and he wars
[1:22:40] against you. Amen. In your thoughts and
[1:22:42] in your mind, he may have something
[1:22:44] against you. But when you pick up this,
[1:22:46] the the situation, the scenario has
[1:22:49] changed because listen, he can't fight
[1:22:52] against this. Amen. He may fight against
[1:22:55] me. He may fight against your pastor.
[1:22:57] Amen. Your sister, but he cannot fight
[1:23:00] against this.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this is the word. Listen,
[1:23:03] it's been tried before.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he took Jesus after 40 days of
[1:23:09] his weakness. Amen. Physically weak. Can
[1:23:12] you imagine what that body went through
[1:23:14] after 40 days of having no nourishment?
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus was basically almost dead
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; physically. Google it if you want to.
[1:23:25] What happens to the body when you go
[1:23:26] without food and water for that many
[1:23:29] days?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he took him up to a high
[1:23:33] mountain and he offered him all this and
[1:23:34] he offered him that. Amen. But let me
[1:23:37] tell you something. Jesus overcame.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; You ever asked yourself the question,
[1:23:41] why did he go through all this? Why did
[1:23:43] he have to face that? Why did he go
[1:23:45] through that B? He went through it so he
[1:23:46] could show you, Amen, that God in the
[1:23:48] flesh could overcome. Amen. And that's
[1:23:51] what you are. God in the flesh so you
[1:23:53] can overcome. Amen. You can be
[1:23:56] victorious today. Amen. You've got the
[1:23:58] mechanics. Amen. You've got the
[1:24:00] dynamics. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I heard some of the brothers
[1:24:05] talking about hunting last night, so
[1:24:07] they're very aware of this. Amen. This
[1:24:09] little cartridge here is composed of
[1:24:11] three or four different things. Amen.
[1:24:13] There's the bullet out the front. That's
[1:24:14] what does the damage. Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; That's what does the damage.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But inside there is packed with
[1:24:22] powder. Amen. Inside of there is packed
[1:24:25] with power. Somebody say, "Amen." And
[1:24:28] all it takes is for something to hit
[1:24:30] this little firing pin on the end. And
[1:24:32] somebody's in trouble. Somebody's in
[1:24:35] trouble. Amen. That deer, that rabbit,
[1:24:37] that squirrel, that devil, they are in
[1:24:38] trouble. Somebody say, "Amen." And when
[1:24:41] that power, the word of God, when
[1:24:43] revelation strikes that power, Amen. And
[1:24:46] it sets that word off. Let me tell you
[1:24:48] something. The devil is in trouble this
[1:24:50] morning.
[1:24:52] Yes.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; I gave you a little scenario last night
[1:24:54] of the brothers outside debating about
[1:24:57] whether to come in [snorts] and said,
[1:25:00] "Did you see what happened to Joe
[1:25:01] Unbelief?
[1:25:03] He came out looking like he'd been a
[1:25:05] practice dummy for the Crimson Tide. He
[1:25:07] was beat up, blooded, and whatever. I
[1:25:09] want I want the devil to know that when
[1:25:11] he sends his imps against the children
[1:25:13] of God, Amen. things are not going to
[1:25:15] work out well."
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; They sung the song. Listen, when he went
[1:25:20] to the to when he went to hell, Amen.
[1:25:22] and he grabbed the keys right off of the
[1:25:23] devil's belt. Amen. Why Why should we
[1:25:26] fear? Amen. Somebody doesn't even have
[1:25:28] the keys to their own house.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't even have didn't even have
[1:25:33] control over his own household.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; But listen, when we have when we listen,
[1:25:40] the prophet said this that what we're
[1:25:43] looking for tonight, we're not looking
[1:25:44] for the mechanics. Amen. We're looking
[1:25:47] for the dynamics. Amen. So many have got
[1:25:51] the mechanics of religion and of the
[1:25:53] Bible. They've got it all bottleized up.
[1:25:56] It looks like a great big 16 or uh uh 16
[1:26:01] or 35 train sitting out on the track.
[1:26:04] But if it hasn't got any steam in it,
[1:26:06] then it's not going to go anywhere.
[1:26:08] Amen. And if it doesn't have any power,
[1:26:11] if it doesn't have any authority of the
[1:26:13] word of God, if it doesn't have one of
[1:26:15] these in it, this is kind of useless.
[1:26:18] Amen. I could throw it at you. I could
[1:26:20] wave it around and it could it could
[1:26:22] give a little bit of fear. But let me
[1:26:24] tell you something, church. After a
[1:26:26] while, Brother Daniel, after a while,
[1:26:28] you're going to have to stop and you're
[1:26:30] going to have to fight that giant.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. After a while, you know, I love
[1:26:36] all the little sayings like, you know,
[1:26:38] I'm going to give the devil a black eye
[1:26:39] and booevil. And they all sound good,
[1:26:42] but you can only boo so long. After a
[1:26:45] while, you're going to have to pick up a
[1:26:46] sword of the word of God, and you're
[1:26:48] going to have to cut that devil's head
[1:26:49] off. You're going to have to cut that
[1:26:51] J's head off, take it over, and hang it
[1:26:53] up in your room. Amen. As a trophy to
[1:26:55] what God has done.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can boo so long, but after a
[1:27:00] while, listen, you can bluff the devil a
[1:27:02] little while, but he's a bigger bluffer
[1:27:04] than you are.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I told you, he knows you. He knows me.
[1:27:10] Amen. He knows exactly what to come come
[1:27:13] against me with.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And he's not afraid to use it.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; We can come to God, Amen, with just a
[1:27:23] with with just a a speck of doubt.
[1:27:28] And we can we can hinder God. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But he's a bluffer.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; And you can bluff him so long, but after
[1:27:39] a while, he's going to realize you're
[1:27:41] just a bluff, too.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You remember the story brother Brown
[1:27:44] told about the butter beans. He planted
[1:27:47] butter beans and then and and a golfer
[1:27:49] come along and eat his butter beans. He
[1:27:51] plant the butter beans and a golfer come
[1:27:53] along and then eat his butter beans. He
[1:27:55] said, "So I got smart and I went out and
[1:27:56] I made a got some some pebbles or
[1:27:59] marbles. I forget what it was. Put it in
[1:28:01] a can, hung it up on a stick. So when
[1:28:03] the gopher came along and he hit that
[1:28:05] can, it rattled those b those those
[1:28:07] marbles. Scared the gopher and he go
[1:28:09] running away.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He come back and he hit that can and the
[1:28:14] the stones would rattle around in it. He
[1:28:17] go running away. Said that happened two
[1:28:19] or three times. Then after a while, he
[1:28:21] come and he hit the can and the stones
[1:28:23] rattled and he ate my butter beans
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; cuz he found out it was just a bluff.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. In myself, I may bluff the devil.
[1:28:30] But if I've got this, Amen. and I've got
[1:28:33] the I've got the mechanics and I've got
[1:28:35] the dynamics. Amen. The devil knows he's
[1:28:38] in for a fight. If the devil wants to
[1:28:40] warfare today, church, we're ready.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; We're ready. We're ready to fight.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; We're ready to fight.
[1:28:50] Come to God. And if there's any doubt in
[1:28:53] us, Amen. then that bluff, you can't
[1:28:56] bluff him. Amen. But if it's real, if
[1:28:59] that word is really set in your heart,
[1:29:01] if that word is there by faith, Amen.
[1:29:04] you can you can overcome him today,
[1:29:05] church. You can wave it around. You can
[1:29:07] scare a lot of people, but sooner or
[1:29:09] later, as I said, you're going to have
[1:29:11] to put that cartridge in that in that
[1:29:13] gun, and you're going to have to kill
[1:29:14] that devil. Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You can only do it so long after a
[1:29:22] while.
[1:29:23] But the writer said, "Arm yourselves."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourselves. Be prepared.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Let me go back and read that scripture
[1:29:32] again for you. For as much
[1:29:36] for as much as Christ has suffered,
[1:29:39] Amen. in the flesh, arm yourselves
[1:29:43] likewise.
[1:29:45] Amen. Arm yourself likewise.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I said the devil's been doing this
[1:29:52] all the way since Eden. Amen. He
[1:29:55] deceived Eve. He tricked He tricked Dave
[1:29:58] David. Amen. He tempted Jesus. He did
[1:30:02] all these things. Amen. And we can stand
[1:30:06] back and we can boo. We can say we give
[1:30:08] him a black eye and we're going to do
[1:30:10] all this. We're going to do all that.
[1:30:12] But after a while, we're going to have
[1:30:13] to have to pick up this word. Amen. And
[1:30:15] realize that it's not what I can do, as
[1:30:18] I said last night, but it's what he can
[1:30:20] do. It's not about me. It's about him.
[1:30:23] Somebody say, "Amen." You may not be the
[1:30:25] quickest draw in the B ride, but let me
[1:30:27] tell you something. You've got the word
[1:30:29] behind you. Amen. You don't only have
[1:30:31] the word of the word, but you got the
[1:30:33] power of the Holy Spirit, amen, behind
[1:30:35] you to make you an overcomer.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, church, this is not a
[1:30:39] Barney F gospel.
[1:30:41] Amen. This is the word.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the power of God that he's
[1:30:46] g given to his church.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Do they not do Do the world not realize
[1:30:53] what they're missing? Do the do the
[1:30:55] majority of the church well realize what
[1:30:58] they're not missing, but not having the
[1:31:00] fullness of the word of God. You can
[1:31:02] have the appearance. You can have the
[1:31:04] quotes. You can have the pictures. You
[1:31:06] can have every tape, every book. You can
[1:31:08] have the picture of the prophet. Uh uh
[1:31:10] uh you can have the picture of the of of
[1:31:13] Christ. You can have all these things in
[1:31:15] your house.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; But it's going to take more than a
[1:31:18] quote. It's going to take more than a
[1:31:20] tape, more than a book, more than a
[1:31:22] picture. It's going to take a life that
[1:31:24] is living for God. It's going to take a
[1:31:26] life that is qualified. It's going to
[1:31:28] take a life with the mechanics and the
[1:31:31] dynamics to be an overcomer.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And I want to be an overcomer.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; True. And I know that's the desire of
[1:31:39] every one of you sitting here this
[1:31:40] morning.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; But I said that little cartridge doesn't
[1:31:45] look like much in itself.
[1:31:48] Can't do much in itself. But I tell you,
[1:31:51] you put it in you you put it together
[1:31:52] with the word and the spirit, it can
[1:31:54] cause some serious damage.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; In myself, I can't do anything.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, tie me together with
[1:32:05] this word. Unite me together with this
[1:32:07] word. Bring me together with this word.
[1:32:10] Let my faith, let my ideas and opinions
[1:32:12] go this way. Amen. But let me get
[1:32:15] united, amen, with that word. It's not
[1:32:17] what I can see with my natural eye. It's
[1:32:20] not what I can hear with my ear. Amen.
[1:32:22] But it's what thus sayeth the Lord. You
[1:32:24] know, John said, "Let him that hath an
[1:32:26] ear. Let him hear what the spirit says
[1:32:28] to the church."
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't with this. I've got a I've
[1:32:33] got a serious hearing problem. I was
[1:32:35] telling brother Shelley through all the
[1:32:37] years of construction stuff I've lost
[1:32:39] about 80% of my hearing
[1:32:42] and what I learn didn't know for for a
[1:32:44] while was that when you lose your
[1:32:46] hearing amen your brain forgets sounds
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; and then when you get that hearing back
[1:32:53] you have your brain has to learn those
[1:32:55] sounds all over again. When I first got
[1:32:57] hearing aids, Amen. Carol and I walked
[1:33:00] out of the house to go to to church on
[1:33:02] Sunday morning and the birds were
[1:33:04] chirping. I said, "What is that? What is
[1:33:08] that noise?" She said, "That's the
[1:33:09] birds." My brain had completely
[1:33:12] forgotten the sound of a bird chirping.
[1:33:15] Amen. Isn't that Isn't that kind of like
[1:33:16] the church world today? Amen. Dull of
[1:33:19] hearing, brother. They have forgotten
[1:33:21] what the sound of the word of God is.
[1:33:23] Amen. Because they're dull of hearing.
[1:33:25] John, let him have an ear to hear.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something,
[1:33:30] these mechanical ears don't work like
[1:33:33] the real thing.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And your mechanical doctrine.
[1:33:37] Amen. And your man-made doctrine and
[1:33:39] your man-made ideas don't work like as
[1:33:42] good as this does.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's just not the same.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; You forgive me for all this. Amen. But
[1:33:50] you know, I don't know if anybody in
[1:33:53] here has hearing aids. I hope you don't
[1:33:54] have to have but they can't recognize
[1:33:57] Amen. the difference between music and
[1:33:59] noise.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; So when brother Ben starts singing,
[1:34:04] Amen. It's it's like a noise to me.
[1:34:08] Thank God mine have a program in them
[1:34:10] that I can change them around. Amen. And
[1:34:12] get them where I can recognize the music
[1:34:14] and and whatever. But you can't change,
[1:34:17] Amen. the word around. It's absolute to
[1:34:20] begin with.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. My Bible said that we are armed.
[1:34:25] Amen. And you don't have to be a pastor.
[1:34:28] You don't have to be a deacon. You don't
[1:34:29] have to be this. Amen. Just be a just be
[1:34:32] a servant.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember this. God didn't call
[1:34:35] us servants.
[1:34:37] He called us sons.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He called He called us sons and
[1:34:42] daughters. Amen. He didn't just call us
[1:34:44] servants. Amen. He called us sons. We're
[1:34:46] we're far beyond that that servant
[1:34:48] stage.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when God spoke to to
[1:34:52] Abraham over in the 14th chapter, Amen.
[1:34:54] or Abram as he was when he heard that
[1:34:57] his brother had been taken captive, the
[1:34:59] scripture said that he armed,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. the servants of his household. And
[1:35:05] if a servant can fight this battle, how
[1:35:07] much more, amen, can a can a man that's
[1:35:10] got the star on his chest, amen, that
[1:35:12] has been sworn in, amen, by the word of
[1:35:15] God, that has been put in a position as
[1:35:18] a son or daughter of God, become a
[1:35:20] marshall in this word of God, he has a
[1:35:22] right, amen, to defend this word and to
[1:35:26] oh my, and to get the benefit of
[1:35:28] everything God has.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just a servant. You're
[1:35:31] a son. You're a daughter. You're not
[1:35:33] just a deputy.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; You're not Barney F. Amen. You are
[1:35:37] [screaming] the marshall. You are the
[1:35:39] one in charge today. The power belongs
[1:35:42] to you.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; The power belongs to me. The power that
[1:35:46] comes from this word, the mechanics and
[1:35:49] the dynamics come together to make us
[1:35:51] what we are. For as much as Christ has
[1:35:53] suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves,
[1:35:56] Amen. with the same mind.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Oh Lord, does anybody have a
[1:36:03] problem with their mind?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; You know, every battle that is fought,
[1:36:10] Amen. When that battle is is is is
[1:36:12] getting ready to be fought, there's a
[1:36:14] there's a battleground chosen. During
[1:36:16] World War II, there was the Italian
[1:36:18] campaign where my dad fought. There was
[1:36:20] the African campaign. There was a the
[1:36:22] the South Pacific campaign. There was
[1:36:24] this campaign. Amen. And every when when
[1:36:27] the children of Israel, amen, were kept
[1:36:29] about what down there in the valley of
[1:36:31] Eli, amen, that that that that location
[1:36:34] was determined, of course, the
[1:36:36] Philistines thought that getting them in
[1:36:37] the valley, as I said last night, was
[1:36:39] going to give them advantage. And
[1:36:40] sometime the devil get you down. And he
[1:36:43] thinks he's got an advantage. I seen a
[1:36:46] little thing one time said, the devil
[1:36:47] thought he had me defeated when he said
[1:36:49] when I had my head down and then he
[1:36:50] heard me say, "Amen." Amen. He found out
[1:36:53] that I wasn't defeated. I was just
[1:36:55] thanking God.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, sometime the devil
[1:36:58] will come at you. Amen. When you're when
[1:37:00] you're feeling bad and when you're when
[1:37:02] you're suffering a disease or something,
[1:37:04] even maybe a life-threatening disease,
[1:37:06] and he'll use that against you. Amen.
[1:37:08] He'll just keep pushing you down. Well,
[1:37:10] if God be God, and if he said he'd heal
[1:37:12] you, why aren't you healed? I am healed.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I am healed. Amen. Say, "Well, you're
[1:37:18] still limp. You still got a problem. You
[1:37:20] still got this. You're still taking
[1:37:21] prescription. I am healed." Why? because
[1:37:24] that word said so. The authority of it
[1:37:27] said so. Amen. But this mind, you know,
[1:37:30] every battle was had a had a a a
[1:37:32] battleground set out a a place. And what
[1:37:35] did the prophet say? What did the word
[1:37:37] say? That here it is. Amen. When God
[1:37:39] created Adam, he created him a spiritual
[1:37:41] man. But then he created him a body. And
[1:37:44] he put him in that body. And when he put
[1:37:46] him in that body, trouble came about.
[1:37:48] Amen. Is this body of flesh. It's my
[1:37:51] will. It's my ability to say yes and no,
[1:37:54] to choose or not choose that gets me in
[1:37:56] trouble.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it all starts up here.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to be a genius, amen,
[1:38:03] to know it. It all starts up here. And
[1:38:06] and the longest journey, Amen, is not
[1:38:09] from here to Durham, North Carolina. The
[1:38:11] longest journey is from here to here.
[1:38:14] Amen. And boy, let me tell you, the
[1:38:15] devil will war everything he can to get
[1:38:18] it out of your uh keep it in your mind
[1:38:20] because that's where he can work at it.
[1:38:23] If it ever gets in your heart, he can't
[1:38:25] mess with it. Amen. But as long as in
[1:38:27] your mind, you can change your mind.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; You can change your mind.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; But if it ever gets in your heart, it
[1:38:36] becomes real.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do about it.
[1:38:40] Amen. It's like I like I said last night
[1:38:42] talking about my my ancestry. Amen. I I
[1:38:45] I was always a Thornton. Amen. Nothing
[1:38:48] they could do about it. And and will you
[1:38:50] forgive me for just going back to
[1:38:51] something I missed last night. Amen. And
[1:38:54] and because I wanted to share it with
[1:38:55] you so much because listen, we're not
[1:38:58] only bloodline,
[1:39:00] but we're part of God. But the the great
[1:39:03] artist Reimbrandt [clears throat] signed
[1:39:06] his portraits, his pictures, and he said
[1:39:08] the reason that he signed them was
[1:39:10] because he wanted people to know that he
[1:39:13] was the one that painted that picture.
[1:39:16] And even the atheist
[1:39:18] uh Stephen Hawkins said one time said,
[1:39:20] "Is it possible that the intellect or
[1:39:23] the intelligence being left his
[1:39:26] signature on his creation?" So let me
[1:39:29] give you a little scientific fact. the
[1:39:32] DNA module and the man that created this
[1:39:35] or discovered this just passed away just
[1:39:37] a couple of months ago. But the DNA
[1:39:39] modular that that that connects Ever
[1:39:42] Thornton that was Amen. that they could
[1:39:45] go back and they d could dig up my great
[1:39:47] greatgrandfather. Amen. And they could
[1:39:49] get DNA and they could prove that he was
[1:39:52] my great greatgrandfather because of the
[1:39:54] DNA. Amen. You know, you can go all the
[1:39:57] way back to God and dig it up and prove
[1:39:59] that you're his sons and daughters.
[1:40:00] Amen. Because he saw you except in the
[1:40:03] word of God.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; But the DNA module appears as a double
[1:40:06] helix. It's like a spiral staircase.
[1:40:10] Amen. And in that spiral staircase,
[1:40:13] there's there's bridges that are called
[1:40:15] sufferic bridges. Amen. And what they
[1:40:18] do, they hold that DNA stream all
[1:40:20] together.
[1:40:22] And they recur they recur in a set
[1:40:24] pattern. Amen. That every 10 acids
[1:40:28] there's a bridge. And then every five
[1:40:30] assets there's another bridge. And then
[1:40:32] every six assets there's another bridge.
[1:40:35] And then every five assets there another
[1:40:37] there's another bridge. And you say
[1:40:38] where's all this going with the
[1:40:40] significance of those numbers 10 5 6 and
[1:40:44] five. Those numbers correspond with the
[1:40:47] Hebrew numbers.
[1:40:50] Amen. The numbers that correspond with
[1:40:52] the Hebrew letters rather wh
[1:40:57] the very name of God. And and when Moses
[1:41:00] said, "Who shall I say sent me?" God
[1:41:03] said, "Tell them I am have sent you." So
[1:41:06] see every God has his DNA. Amen. All the
[1:41:09] way down into you. All the way from the
[1:41:12] foundation world. Just as the artist
[1:41:14] Rembrandt put his signature on that
[1:41:16] painting, God has put his signature on
[1:41:19] your life.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's put that signature right
[1:41:22] in your life where you can you can look
[1:41:24] back and just say, "I am who I am by by
[1:41:26] the grace of God."
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But arm yourselves with the mind
[1:41:31] of Christ.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourself with the mind of
[1:41:34] Christ. For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:41:36] and blood, but against principalities
[1:41:38] and powers of the air. And this won't do
[1:41:41] any good
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; against principalities and powers of the
[1:41:45] air.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. My intellect, my knowledge, my
[1:41:49] understanding will not do any good
[1:41:52] against the principalities and the
[1:41:54] powers of the air.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're armed for a battle today,
[1:41:59] church. And before that battle takes
[1:42:01] place, Amen. that that ground is set.
[1:42:04] And when when the enemy set that ground
[1:42:06] and listen, it went all the way back to
[1:42:08] the to the beginning when Satan and
[1:42:10] Michael wared in heaven and he got cast
[1:42:13] out.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] You know, we're kind of like wheat.
[1:42:19] We're body, soul, and spirit. Amen.
[1:42:21] We're governed by the senses. As I said,
[1:42:23] you know, we we base a lot of what we do
[1:42:26] on what we can see and what we can hear,
[1:42:29] what we can taste, what we can smell.
[1:42:31] Amen. And those things a lot of time,
[1:42:32] you know, I can look I can look at my
[1:42:34] situation.
[1:42:36] And the devil can make me doubt the
[1:42:38] promise of God.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; But if I look at my situation, Amen. in
[1:42:42] the light of the word of God, he can't
[1:42:44] do anything about it. He can if I look
[1:42:46] at it according to my my pain or my
[1:42:49] disease or my prescription. Amen. He can
[1:42:51] use that against me in my mind. But if I
[1:42:54] look at it according to the word that
[1:42:55] says I'll supply all your needs
[1:42:58] according to my riches and glory that by
[1:43:00] my stripes you're healed. If I look at
[1:43:02] it according to the word of God and not
[1:43:04] the prescription bundle. Let me tell you
[1:43:06] something. Something and life is
[1:43:08] entirely different.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I live a different life.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of that.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Now, you we're we're we're free moral
[1:43:20] agents. We have the ability to choose.
[1:43:22] We have the ability to make a choice.
[1:43:25] Amen. As I said earlier, you know, we
[1:43:27] should every one of us should have this
[1:43:28] mentality. I'm going into war as a hero.
[1:43:31] I'm going to come out a hero. I'm going
[1:43:33] to come out victorious.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; No man ever enters a race with this
[1:43:39] determination in his heart. I'm going to
[1:43:41] race, but I'm going to lose.
[1:43:43] I'm not even worried about winning. I'm
[1:43:45] just going to enter a race and I'm going
[1:43:46] to lose.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; What kind of mentality is that?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; But the devil would tell you, you can't
[1:43:53] win.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Has he ever told anybody here you can't
[1:43:56] win? Has he ever told you when you were
[1:43:58] sick, you ain't going to get any better.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; You can't You're not going to This thing
[1:44:01] is going to kill you.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, whatever it does, Paul said
[1:44:05] to be with Christ is one thing. To be
[1:44:07] with him is the same thing.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I can't lose.
[1:44:12] If I stay here, I I I win. Amen. If I go
[1:44:16] with him, I win.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing, church. But we we
[1:44:20] get we have that decision making
[1:44:22] process. Amen. And the decisions are
[1:44:24] made up here.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what gets us in trouble a
[1:44:28] lot of times. It's not question of mind
[1:44:30] over matter.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; It's a question of the word of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certain Satan's approach is from
[1:44:38] the inside. Amen. If he can get in your
[1:44:40] mind. Amen. But what did the scripture
[1:44:43] say? Be not conformed to this world.
[1:44:45] Amen. But be you transformed.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you love that word transformed?
[1:44:49] That just sounds like power to me. Amen.
[1:44:52] Be you transformed by the renewing of
[1:44:54] your mind. Not double-minded.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Not this way one day and the next way
[1:44:58] the next day you're some other way.
[1:45:00] Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus came, they said
[1:45:04] that they they sought to to stone him.
[1:45:06] And he said, "For what good works do you
[1:45:08] stone me?" And this is not for any of
[1:45:10] your good works that we're we we're
[1:45:12] doing this. It's because you a man are
[1:45:15] making yourself God. Boy, did they have
[1:45:18] that backwards. Amen. He wasn't God
[1:45:20] making him a man making himself God. He
[1:45:23] was God that made himself a man.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the devil looks at you,
[1:45:27] he says, "See this." He said, "See God
[1:45:29] manifested in you."
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Oh, I want to see God."
[1:45:34] Turn around. Look at those sitting
[1:45:35] beside of you. Amen. and you see God
[1:45:37] manifested in the flesh.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Boy, how hard that is for the world to
[1:45:41] accept.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you could actually stand here
[1:45:44] and say, "I'm I'm like God."
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am part of him. Amen. That DNA,
[1:45:50] that ancestry followed right on down
[1:45:52] through every generation of whatever.
[1:45:54] And and and here I am being manifested
[1:45:57] of God.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; He thought it not equal to be God.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; So, we're armed with the mind of Christ.
[1:46:04] when he went when he was tempted and the
[1:46:05] devil said if you do this if you'll do
[1:46:07] that the only thing that Jesus ever done
[1:46:10] was said it is written
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; amen it's written that you'll not serve
[1:46:14] man shall serve God and him alone it's
[1:46:17] it's written this it's written that amen
[1:46:19] what was his defense today church it was
[1:46:21] the word my defense today it's the word
[1:46:25] it's not this
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; doesn't scare the devil
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; but that'll make him step back and take
[1:46:33] another Look.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you start waving this.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You start waving this. Brother was
[1:46:41] talking about the
[1:46:43] Goliath and David and his five stones.
[1:46:46] It only took one. Amen. It only took
[1:46:49] one. Everybody's concerned about what
[1:46:51] happened to the other four stones. I
[1:46:52] just worried about the one. Amen. All it
[1:46:55] takes is one person believe in God.
[1:46:57] Amen. If God can get you to believe, he
[1:46:59] can do great things. If God can get you
[1:47:02] to have faith in his word and know that
[1:47:03] whatsoever God has said, it shall not
[1:47:05] fail because he's not a man that he
[1:47:07] should fail.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if he can get you under his
[1:47:10] control, if he can get us on me under
[1:47:12] his control, then God could do great
[1:47:14] things in this hour. Somebody say,
[1:47:16] "Amen. We are responsible for this hour,
[1:47:19] church. We are the God that anybody's
[1:47:22] going to see." Amen. This uh facts say
[1:47:24] that that most people will never pick up
[1:47:26] their Bible and read it, but they'll
[1:47:28] read you every day. They'll see the life
[1:47:30] that you live. And you don't have to go
[1:47:32] around preaching to them.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go around saying uh uh
[1:47:36] uh uh asking a blessing over your food
[1:47:38] in a restaurant loud enough for
[1:47:40] everybody to hear that. God's not a
[1:47:42] showman.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; But if that life is in there, amen,
[1:47:46] it'll go forth.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was going through
[1:47:50] a real sur severe trial battle in my
[1:47:53] mind. is when I had the limousine
[1:47:56] service and I had to go to the airport
[1:47:57] many mornings very early 3 and 4:00 in
[1:48:00] the morning and I was all discouraged
[1:48:03] and and despondent, depressed. Amen. And
[1:48:07] and just felt like I I just didn't know
[1:48:10] what to do. And I walked into the
[1:48:12] convenience store to get a cup of coffee
[1:48:14] while I waited on the flight. And a
[1:48:17] gentleman was there from the some middle
[1:48:19] eastern country and I paid the bill and
[1:48:21] he looked at me. He said, "You're a
[1:48:23] preacher, aren't you,
[1:48:26] Brother Shel? I like to cry like a
[1:48:28] baby." I said, "God, you do know who I
[1:48:30] am, don't you?"
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I never That man had never spoke
[1:48:34] to me before. I never spoke to him, but
[1:48:35] there was something that emanated that
[1:48:37] made him know there was something
[1:48:39] different about me. That's no glory to
[1:48:42] me. That's no glory to me. Amen. But
[1:48:44] it's glory to God because that word,
[1:48:47] that life, that that life of God, amen,
[1:48:49] will come. the mechanics. Amen. The
[1:48:51] dynamics it will it will come out and
[1:48:54] people will be able to recognize. Amen.
[1:48:57] And they'll say, "I don't know what it
[1:48:58] is, but there's something different
[1:48:59] about you. I don't know what what you've
[1:49:01] done. I don't know how you live. I don't
[1:49:03] know this. I don't know." But there's
[1:49:05] something different about you.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, there's something different about
[1:49:08] us. Amen. We serve a living God.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Arm yourselves with the mind of Christ.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourself.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You know, this this gun
[1:49:20] carries about six cartridges. I think we
[1:49:23] won't get about two or three of them on
[1:49:24] the devil today. Amen. But there's a
[1:49:28] whole lot more where these came from.
[1:49:30] Amen. There there's a whole there's a
[1:49:32] whole lot more where they came from.
[1:49:33] There's a whole lot more where this came
[1:49:35] from. Amen. So, let me tell you
[1:49:37] something. You may be armed with the
[1:49:38] mind of Christ, but he also armed us
[1:49:40] with a pardon.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a precious thing it is.
[1:49:44] Amen. To be to to have that. And the
[1:49:46] word pardon means the action of
[1:49:48] forgiving or being forgiven or of an
[1:49:51] error or an offense.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; 2 Coronicles 30 and 18. Listen. For a
[1:49:59] multitude of people, even many of
[1:50:01] Ephraim, Manasses, Ishikar, and Zebulun
[1:50:04] have not cleansed themselves, yet did
[1:50:06] they eat the Passover. Otherwise, then
[1:50:08] it was written, but Hezekiah prayed for
[1:50:10] them. Amen. And the good Lord pardoned
[1:50:13] them.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:16] Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I got news for you. I'm not on parole
[1:50:20] today.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not on parole today.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not worried that if I don't do
[1:50:26] something just right, Amen, that the
[1:50:28] guy's going to come and grab me up and
[1:50:30] put me back in jail. God's not standing
[1:50:32] around waiting for me to make a mistake
[1:50:34] so he can kick me off into hell. Amen.
[1:50:37] He's standing there, amen, ready to
[1:50:39] forgive. Amen. To a repentant soul, to a
[1:50:42] repentant person. He's ready, amen, to
[1:50:44] welcome us back in. Why? Because that
[1:50:46] pardon is forever.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And he pardoned me before. Listen,
[1:50:50] church, you can have a pardon even
[1:50:52] before you commit the crime. That's it.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was pardoned way back there
[1:50:58] before I ever got here and became a
[1:51:00] sinner in this flesh. I was already
[1:51:02] pardoned. Oh my. You ought to shout,
[1:51:04] "Praise the Lord for that. I'm already
[1:51:07] free."
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm already free. They sang the
[1:51:11] song, "It's already done.
[1:51:14] It's already done. I'm already healed.
[1:51:16] I'm already saved. I'm already pardoned.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 40, he said, "Speak
[1:51:22] ye comfortably to to Jerusalem and say
[1:51:24] unto her, for her warfare is
[1:51:27] accomplished."
[1:51:28] Her warfare is accomplished. Church,
[1:51:30] it's going to be over soon. Amen. We're
[1:51:33] fighting every day.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; It's true, sir.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Now, there may be some here that says,
[1:51:39] "Well, you know, things are pretty good
[1:51:40] to me. I'm not going through a battle.
[1:51:42] I'm not going through a trial. I'm not
[1:51:44] going through this and the other. God
[1:51:45] bless you. Come and tell me how to do
[1:51:47] that. Amen. Because I have a battle
[1:51:49] every day
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; in some way, some form, some some some
[1:51:54] way. Amen. If it's nothing but a a
[1:51:56] thought that the devil puts in my mind,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's if it's nothing but
[1:52:01] speaking harshly, Amen. because I'm
[1:52:04] frustrated over this.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Then I need that pardon. speaking
[1:52:10] comfort to Jerusalem and cry unto her.
[1:52:13] Amen. That her warfare is accomplished
[1:52:15] and that her iniquity is pardoned.
[1:52:19] Amen. Let me say it again. I ain't on
[1:52:21] parole. Amen. I don't have to check in
[1:52:23] ever so often. Amen. Because he done the
[1:52:26] work. He done it completely. He done it
[1:52:28] once and for all. Amen. And I don't have
[1:52:31] to worry about it. All I've got to do is
[1:52:33] is be mindful of what God has done for
[1:52:36] me.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's heard the story, I'm
[1:52:41] sure, about President [snorts] Lincoln
[1:52:44] and the and the young man that that was
[1:52:46] wrongly uh uh uh convicted and uh they
[1:52:49] were going to hang him and and his
[1:52:51] friends went to the president and and
[1:52:53] and sought a pardon for him. And
[1:52:55] President Lincoln after hearing all the
[1:52:57] the the news and and the the facts and
[1:53:00] everything, he took a piece of paper and
[1:53:02] he scribbled down on it. The man's name
[1:53:04] said, "I pardon so and so." Amen.
[1:53:06] President Abraham Lincoln. And when they
[1:53:09] took it to the man in in the cell and
[1:53:10] told him, "Look, we've got a pardon for
[1:53:12] you." Amen. He looked at it. Amen. He
[1:53:15] said, "This this is a trick that it's
[1:53:18] not real." He said, "If this was a if
[1:53:20] this was a a real pardon, it'd be on
[1:53:22] presidential stationary." Amen. It'd
[1:53:25] have the seal on it. It'd have the pres
[1:53:28] have all this stuff on it. Amen. And he
[1:53:30] refused that pardon and he was hung.
[1:53:34] and delay years later that he the the
[1:53:36] government was sued because of it. Amen.
[1:53:39] And the verdict came back that a pardon
[1:53:41] is only a pardon when you receive it as
[1:53:43] a pardon.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it's up to you. It's in your
[1:53:47] ability. It's in your hand to accept
[1:53:49] what God has done for us today, church.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus took his he took his
[1:53:55] blood. Amen. And he took and he wrote on
[1:53:57] my sins and everything, your pardon. and
[1:54:00] cast him into the sea of forgiveness
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; never to be remembered anymore as far as
[1:54:05] the east is from the west.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You realize you can start at the north
[1:54:12] pole and you can start south and at at
[1:54:15] some point you will no longer be going
[1:54:17] you will no longer be going south. You
[1:54:19] will be going north.
[1:54:22] But did you know that if you start in
[1:54:24] the east, Amen. and you start east.
[1:54:27] There is no point ever that you will not
[1:54:30] be going east.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You will always be going east. There's
[1:54:34] no there's no time that it ever change.
[1:54:36] Amen. That's why I love the fact that he
[1:54:38] cast our sins into the sea of
[1:54:40] forgiveness as far as the east is from
[1:54:42] the west because there is no ending to
[1:54:45] the east. It continues forever. You're
[1:54:48] always going east.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So make sure you're always going
[1:54:52] east and not north and south.
[1:54:57] You're armed with a pardon.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And by his own blood, he rode across
[1:55:02] those sins. He rode across our life.
[1:55:05] Amen. And he cast it into the sea of
[1:55:07] forgiveness. Amenise.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; You know, when you're on parole, you're
[1:55:11] just you're just a prisoner temporarily
[1:55:13] released. Amen. You're still a prisoner.
[1:55:16] You got to check in. You got to do this.
[1:55:18] Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; But when you're pardoned, you can go. I
[1:55:24] stood in in in Ford Theater in
[1:55:26] Washington years ago down in the bottom
[1:55:28] of the of the theater there, they have a
[1:55:30] museum. And in that museum, they have
[1:55:33] President Lincoln's coat hanging on a on
[1:55:36] a on a um whatever they call those
[1:55:40] things, mannequin, I guess it is.
[1:55:42] Hanging on that mannequin.
[1:55:45] And on that coat, Brother Shel, you can
[1:55:47] see the the blood stain.
[1:55:50] And I thought, Lord have mercy. That man
[1:55:54] gave his life to free a people.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I said, "But there's a greater one
[1:55:59] today." Amen. To look back at Calvary
[1:56:02] and see the blood that was shed there.
[1:56:04] Amen. Not not the DNA. Amen. Not the
[1:56:08] blood type ABC, BC, whatever. Amen. That
[1:56:10] that dripped onto the ground, but the
[1:56:12] life that was in that blood because the
[1:56:14] scripture said that the life of the
[1:56:16] flesh is the blood, but the life of the
[1:56:17] blood is the spirit. But it was that
[1:56:19] spirit, amen, that that redeemed you and
[1:56:22] I today that pardoned us. Amen. It
[1:56:24] wasn't the literal blood, brother
[1:56:26] Greley, amen, that signed my pardon.
[1:56:28] What it was was the Holy Spirit that
[1:56:30] said, I go to the father and if I go to
[1:56:32] him, the Holy Spirit will come and he'll
[1:56:35] fill you. And guess what, church? On the
[1:56:37] day of Pentecost, Amen. There was a
[1:56:39] sound of a rushing mighty wind that
[1:56:41] filled all the house. Kind of like it
[1:56:43] was this morning. Amen. And he filled
[1:56:46] every one of the believers with the Holy
[1:56:48] Spirit.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that today. Amen.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Nehemiah in in describing Israel's
[1:56:58] deliverance. Amen. And refused to obey,
[1:57:01] neither were they mindful of the wonders
[1:57:03] that thou thou didest among them, but
[1:57:05] they hardened their necks, and in their
[1:57:08] rebellion appointed a captain to return
[1:57:10] to their bondage. But thou art a God
[1:57:13] ready to pardon.
[1:57:15] Amen. Thou art a God ready to pardon.
[1:57:18] Gracious, listen, listen to me. Gracious
[1:57:21] and merciful, slow to anger and of great
[1:57:24] kindness. Amen. Forsook them not.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; You ever felt like God left you? You
[1:57:32] ever felt like you were all alone? Amen.
[1:57:35] I said last night, Lord, don't you
[1:57:37] remember sometime you see what's going
[1:57:38] on down here? Amen. He's never forgotten
[1:57:41] you.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. when you're at your lowest point.
[1:57:44] Amen. He has not forgotten you. No
[1:57:47] matter what you're going through, he has
[1:57:49] never forgotten you. Amen. Never, never,
[1:57:51] never, never, never. We could say it
[1:57:53] many times, but he has never forgotten
[1:57:56] you.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; What did he say? I'll never leave you.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'll go with you even to the
[1:58:02] end of the earth, even to the end of the
[1:58:04] age. Amen.
[1:58:07] When God was speaking to Moses, he said,
[1:58:09] "Behold, I'll send my angel before thee
[1:58:11] to keep thee in the way, and to bring
[1:58:13] thee to the place which I have prepared.
[1:58:16] Beware of him and obey his voice.
[1:58:18] Provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[1:58:20] your transgression. My name is in him.
[1:58:22] But if thou will indeed obey his voice."
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Here we back to him. Here we are back to
[1:58:28] it's in my control. It's up to me
[1:58:31] whether or not to accept God's pardon.
[1:58:33] It's up to me to to to have my mind
[1:58:35] changed.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you this? When Moses
[1:58:40] stood on the mountain and the bush was
[1:58:42] burning, Amen. The bush is still
[1:58:44] burning.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; The bush is still on fire today. Amen.
[1:58:48] It was not unusual for Moses to see a
[1:58:51] bush that was burning on the on the on
[1:58:53] the side of the mountain. It was
[1:58:54] probably a common thing. Why? Because
[1:58:56] lightning would strike the bushes and
[1:58:58] they would burn. But there was something
[1:59:00] different. Amen. There's people shouting
[1:59:02] just like you did this morning. There's
[1:59:04] people singing just like you did this
[1:59:06] morning. There's people even claiming to
[1:59:08] believe what you believe this morning.
[1:59:09] But there's something different. Amen.
[1:59:11] And the difference was that that bush
[1:59:13] that burned that day were not consumed.
[1:59:15] Amen. They shout and it runs out. They
[1:59:18] sing and it runs out. They go to church
[1:59:20] and it runs out. You come to church.
[1:59:22] Amen. It is continual. You take it home
[1:59:25] with you. You sing, you take it home
[1:59:27] with you. You shout, you take it home
[1:59:29] with you. You love God, you take it to
[1:59:31] your job. You love God, [music] you take
[1:59:33] it to the school. Amen. It does not run
[1:59:35] out.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; There is an ex inexhaustible supply.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; There's an [screaming] inexhaustible
[1:59:43] supply of the mercy and the grace and
[1:59:46] the blessings of God today. I'll never
[1:59:48] leave you, never forsake you.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; It's only good. It's only as good as you
[1:59:56] will let it be. that pardon is only as
[1:59:59] good as you will let it be. Isaiah
[2:00:01] chapter 55 said, "Let the wicked
[2:00:03] forsake, Amen, his ways, and the
[2:00:06] unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
[2:00:08] him return unto the Lord, and he will
[2:00:10] have mercy upon him, and to our God. He
[2:00:13] will abundantly,
[2:00:15] he will abundantly, I love that word,
[2:00:18] abundantly." That's more than I can
[2:00:20] hold. Amen. That's more than I can
[2:00:22] That's more than I can comprehend. He
[2:00:25] will more than abundantly pardon.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you armed this morning,
[2:00:33] church? Amen. Are you equipped for the
[2:00:36] battle? Amen. Do you have what it takes?
[2:00:39] Amen. It's not your ability. Amen. It's
[2:00:41] not your understanding, but it's the
[2:00:43] it's the word of God. Amen. He will
[2:00:46] abundantly pardon this. Listen, Jeremiah
[2:00:49] said, "I will cleanse them from all
[2:00:51] their iniquity, whereby they have sinned
[2:00:54] against me." Amen.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; I'll cleanse every one of them. Amen.
[2:00:57] And I will pardon all their iniquities
[2:01:00] wherever by they have sinned and whereby
[2:01:03] they have transgress against me.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Whosoever will, let him come.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; On the front of that door over there, it
[2:01:10] could be whosoever will.
[2:01:13] And when you go through that door and
[2:01:16] shut it behind you and you look on the
[2:01:17] back side of that door, Brother Daniel,
[2:01:19] it says predestinated before the
[2:01:20] foundation of the world. Amen. because
[2:01:24] that's whosoever will. Amen. Those are
[2:01:26] the ones that would come. You're the
[2:01:28] ones that will come. Those that were
[2:01:29] predestinated. Amen. Those that were
[2:01:31] pardoned before the foundation of the
[2:01:33] world. Those that are armed with the
[2:01:35] mind of Christ.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; I mentioned the scripture last night how
[2:01:43] that God laid on Jesus Christ the sins
[2:01:45] of the world. Amen. So that he that knew
[2:01:48] no sin could become sin. Amen. So that
[2:01:52] you that knew that did not know God
[2:01:54] could become God. So that when God
[2:01:56] looked at Jesus, he saw me. And when he
[2:01:58] looked at me, he saw Jesus. Amen. Why?
[2:02:01] Because we have become one. I don't know
[2:02:03] about you, but sometime I look in the
[2:02:05] mirror in the morning, I don't like what
[2:02:06] I see. Amen. And I sometime brother G, I
[2:02:10] say, God, how do you see me? Amen. Don't
[2:02:12] let me see myself, but let me see how
[2:02:14] you see me. Let me be what you want me
[2:02:17] to be. Let me reflect not my image. Not
[2:02:20] let me not reflect what I am. But let me
[2:02:22] reflect the word of God. Let that word
[2:02:25] shine forth out of me. Let me be armed
[2:02:28] with the spirit of God, with the mind of
[2:02:30] God, with the pardon of God, with the
[2:02:31] word of God.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me have it all. But he said
[2:02:37] that he laid on him the sins of the
[2:02:38] world so that he could become when he
[2:02:41] looked at him, he saw me. And when he
[2:02:42] looked at me, Amen. he saw himself.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hello, [snorts] devil.
[2:02:49] You want a challenge? Here sets a bunch
[2:02:51] of people that's ready for the
[2:02:53] challenge.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; He's got 6,000 years of experience.
[2:02:57] Brother Brandham said, Amen. He's the
[2:02:59] God of this world. He's done a pretty
[2:03:01] good job of it. He's pretty He's pretty
[2:03:03] much succeeded in it. Amen.
[2:03:08] It's not enough to shout. It's not
[2:03:10] enough of this good singing as great as
[2:03:12] it is and how much I appreciate it.
[2:03:14] Brother Shel asked me again this
[2:03:16] morning, you going to stay back here?
[2:03:17] How can I stay back there with all this
[2:03:19] going on out here? How can you stay back
[2:03:22] there with all that going on out here?
[2:03:23] Amen. I want to be part of it.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to I want to enjoy it. I
[2:03:27] want to rejoice in it with you. Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Greater is he. The flesh, the senses.
[2:03:33] Amen. He may be bigger than me. Sure he
[2:03:36] is. May be bigger than you. May be
[2:03:38] bigger than your pastor. He ain't bigger
[2:03:39] than my God.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's just it. He's not He's
[2:03:44] not bigger than the one that that lives
[2:03:46] on the inside of me. Listen. John 16:33.
[2:03:49] I have told you these things so that in
[2:03:52] me you might have peace. In the world
[2:03:54] you would have trouble, but take heart.
[2:03:56] Take heart. I have overcome the world.
[2:04:00] Amen. I have overcome the world.
[2:04:03] And if he's overcome, he said that I
[2:04:06] could overcome. Let me let me give you
[2:04:08] the amplified version of that scripture.
[2:04:10] It says, "I have deprived it of its
[2:04:12] power.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I have taken all of its power away to
[2:04:16] harm you and have conquered it for you.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry. He's already won
[2:04:23] the battle."
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. All I got to do is just pick up
[2:04:27] the flag and run along behind saying,
[2:04:29] "Glory to God. We are victorious." "The
[2:04:32] battle's not mine," said little David.
[2:04:34] "It belongs to God." "The battle's not
[2:04:37] mine," says her new hope. Amen. and it
[2:04:39] belongs to God.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. All I've got to do is rejoice in
[2:04:44] the victory. Amen. That's what you were
[2:04:46] doing this morning. You're rejoicing in
[2:04:48] the victory that God has given you
[2:04:49] today. Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; You can't overcome in yourself. I can't
[2:04:54] overcome in myself. Amen.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; It just lives in us.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; It's part of me.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We struggle sometime to live for
[2:05:03] God.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Why are you struggling? Quit struggling.
[2:05:06] Quit trying to live for God. Yes.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to live for God. Rest in
[2:05:10] him. Amen. Be filled with the Holy
[2:05:12] Ghost. And that Holy Spirit lives in
[2:05:14] you. See,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; you don't know what it's like to be a
[2:05:17] Thornton,
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; but I do.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world doesn't know what it's
[2:05:22] like to be a believer, but you do. Why?
[2:05:25] Because it lives on the inside of you.
[2:05:27] Because that word that God is living
[2:05:30] through you. Amen. And as natural it is
[2:05:32] for you to raise your hand, Amen. or to
[2:05:35] eat a meal. It's just as natural for you
[2:05:38] to serve God
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; and to please God.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; You realize how hard that is.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; You realize how hard it is to raise your
[2:05:49] hand.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Try holding it up there for 10 minutes.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't born to be that way. You
[2:05:54] weren't born to be that way. You were
[2:05:56] born for your arms to be down like this.
[2:05:58] That's the reason you're made that way.
[2:06:00] But when you do this, you defy gravity.
[2:06:02] You defy the laws of nature. Amen. and
[2:06:04] you defy everything and you give glory
[2:06:06] to God. Amen. And when you stand on this
[2:06:09] word, you defy everything that this
[2:06:11] natural body was born into this life
[2:06:13] for. You defy everything that the devil
[2:06:16] has against you. Amen. You give glory
[2:06:18] unto God.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not natural for me to do
[2:06:22] this.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; It's not natural for me to serve God.
[2:06:26] Everything in me, Amen, is against God.
[2:06:28] Everything about this natural man is
[2:06:30] contrary
[2:06:33] to serving God.
[2:06:35] But when he comes on the inside,
[2:06:37] gravitation loses its hold and the hand
[2:06:40] and and spontaneously before you even
[2:06:43] recognize it or even realize, brother
[2:06:45] Greek, your hand went up to praise the
[2:06:46] Lord. Your voice echoes, glory to God.
[2:06:49] Amen. You start raising your hand. You
[2:06:52] start praising the Lord. You start
[2:06:53] patting your foot, clapping your hand,
[2:06:55] giving glory to God. All of that is
[2:06:57] contrary to what you are
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; in the natural.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; But not in the spirit of God.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Was it within the ability of the Hebrew
[2:07:12] children to quench the fire?
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't within the ability of of of
[2:07:18] Daniel to close the mouth of the lion.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't find anything in the
[2:07:23] scripture where he was ever trained as a
[2:07:24] lion trainer. He didn't have a whip in a
[2:07:27] chair, but he had God. Amen. You may not
[2:07:29] have what the world looks at and said,
[2:07:31] "Well, you know, there this, there,
[2:07:32] that, and that, there." It doesn't
[2:07:34] matter what the world sees. It's what
[2:07:35] God has given you. Amen. And God had
[2:07:38] given the Hebrew children. Amen.
[2:07:40] Something that that the king didn't have
[2:07:42] any idea what it was all about.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And when they stepped to that fiery
[2:07:46] furnace, they looked in there, brother
[2:07:47] Greley, and they didn't see anything but
[2:07:49] fire.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Sometime God will bring you, Amen,
[2:07:52] brother Benjamin, right to the brink. He
[2:07:55] will bring you to the edge of the water.
[2:07:57] He will bring you to the edge of of of
[2:07:59] persecution. He will bring you to the
[2:08:01] edge to the edge of total destruction,
[2:08:03] so to speak. Amen. But he will never
[2:08:06] leave you nor forsake you. When your
[2:08:08] feet touch the water, the water's going
[2:08:10] to roll back. And God's going to make a
[2:08:12] way. When your feet have faith, amen. If
[2:08:15] you touch that word, the water's going
[2:08:17] to roll back. The healing's going to
[2:08:19] come. Amen. The joy is going to be there
[2:08:21] no matter what if you just hold on to
[2:08:24] God.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; You realize it rained for 40 days and 40
[2:08:31] nights,
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; but it stopped raining on day 41.
[2:08:39] You realize that Goliath, Amen, tortured
[2:08:41] and and and
[2:08:44] battered the children of Israel for 40
[2:08:46] days.
[2:08:48] But on day 41,
[2:08:50] David took his head off.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that Moses lived and hid
[2:08:55] in the desert for 40 years? But year 41,
[2:08:58] he went down and delivered Israel.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." What are you
[2:09:03] saying, Brother Johnny? Your your giant
[2:09:05] will fall. Amen. Your victory come.
[2:09:08] Amen. It took 40 years in the wilderness
[2:09:09] for Israel. Amen. But on year 41 to
[2:09:12] enter the promised land, your giant will
[2:09:14] fall. Amen. Your victory will come.
[2:09:16] Amen. Your promised land will come into
[2:09:18] sight. Amen. If you don't give up on day
[2:09:21] 40.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; If you persevere, if you hold on, if you
[2:09:25] don't give up.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Day 41, year 41 is coming.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your deliverance is coming. Amen.
[2:09:34] Why? Because you're armed with the with
[2:09:36] the weaponry. You're armed with that
[2:09:37] that would that will be able to overcome
[2:09:40] the principalities and the powers of the
[2:09:42] air and the spirit that would war
[2:09:44] against you even in this hour.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Greater things.
[2:09:52] Amen. The greatest thing is to overcome
[2:09:55] myself. I said sometime I look in the
[2:09:57] mirror and I don't like what I see.
[2:09:59] Amen. But the greatest thing if we can
[2:10:02] overcome this flesh, if we can overcome
[2:10:04] ourselves.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; You know when the woman met Jesus at the
[2:10:09] well, you know what? She just
[2:10:12] she had all these hidden secrets. She
[2:10:15] had all these things in her life.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; And she came to the well at a different
[2:10:22] time because of her life.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't want to be associated
[2:10:25] or couldn't be associated with with
[2:10:27] those that that were uh would come to
[2:10:30] the well at certain times. But the
[2:10:32] difference between this trip and the
[2:10:35] trips before is that she met somebody
[2:10:37] different.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And I love the scripture where Jesus
[2:10:39] told the disciples, he said, "I must
[2:10:41] need to go through Samaria."
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it amazing that Jesus had a
[2:10:46] need?
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; His need was to meet her need.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, this this is not to make
[2:10:54] anybody feel bad, but you know, we're
[2:10:56] we're people of habit.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to church, we come in, we
[2:11:00] sit on the same pew in the same spot
[2:11:03] every service.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're we're people of of uh
[2:11:08] we're just kind of put into a mold. God
[2:11:10] God forbid that somebody come in with a
[2:11:13] with a Barnameus spirit. Amen. And sit
[2:11:16] down beside of us. Amen. Because you
[2:11:18] know what's going to happen with a
[2:11:19] Barnameus spirit? He's going to start
[2:11:21] screaming out, "Lord, have mercy on me."
[2:11:23] Why? Because he has a need. The problem
[2:11:26] is that some of us realize or or feel
[2:11:28] like we don't have a need anymore. But I
[2:11:30] tell you this morning, the greatest day
[2:11:32] of your life was not when you got
[2:11:34] married, not when you got your first
[2:11:36] home, not when you had your first child.
[2:11:38] The greatest day of your life was when
[2:11:40] you recognized you had a need
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; and that need was for God.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; That was the greatest day of your life.
[2:11:48] Amen. You can put up all your accolades
[2:11:50] and this and that and the other. They
[2:11:52] don't mean a thing.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; The greatest day of your life was when
[2:11:56] you Amen. recognize I need Jesus.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; I need him. I can't make it without him.
[2:12:02] I can't go any further. You ever been to
[2:12:04] Did you get to that place? Sure you did.
[2:12:06] That's why you believe him today.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; The greatest day of your life.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; If we can overcome ourselves and it's
[2:12:17] hard to do because we make mistakes and
[2:12:20] we we have faults and we have failures.
[2:12:22] Amen. That's just part of who we are. I
[2:12:26] think I said it last night. That does
[2:12:27] not define who we are. Amen. We're we're
[2:12:30] we're children of God, sons of God.
[2:12:32] Amen.
[2:12:34] And you know, you have a mistake and
[2:12:36] people say, "You backslid." Well,
[2:12:38] prophet of God said, "You just broke
[2:12:39] that fellowship with God for a while."
[2:12:42] Amen. Because, as I told you last night,
[2:12:44] I have a son. His name is Adam. Ain't
[2:12:47] nothing he he's my son regardless. He
[2:12:49] may not always please me. Of course, he
[2:12:51] he does now. He does pretty good. Amen.
[2:12:53] And he's single, ladies. Amen.
[2:12:56] [laughter]
[2:12:57] I'm losing my armor. Amen. But listen
[2:13:01] church,
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; the point is he's my son. I may not have
[2:13:05] agreed with everything he done in the
[2:13:07] past, but he was always my son.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may displease God sometime,
[2:13:12] but you're still his son.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; And that's where the pardon comes in.
[2:13:16] Though he's seen our iniquities, though
[2:13:18] he's seen our faults, though he's seen
[2:13:19] our failures, Amen. He still gave us a
[2:13:22] pardon. Amen.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was tempted, Amen. I said a
[2:13:28] little while ago, the reason I believe
[2:13:30] he was tempted is so that he could show
[2:13:31] you and I that that the flesh could
[2:13:35] overcome as long as it depended on the
[2:13:38] word.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "Well, you know, that
[2:13:41] that stone could make a nice French
[2:13:44] bread or something." He said, "It's
[2:13:46] written, man shall not live by bread
[2:13:47] alone."
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the devil will he'll play
[2:13:51] with the scripture and and he knows the
[2:13:53] scripture. He said, "You cast yourself
[2:13:54] down cuz it's already written." Amen.
[2:13:57] Don't ever think that he won't bring and
[2:13:59] use the very thing that you love against
[2:14:01] you. Amen. He will twist it around.
[2:14:04] Amen. One word here or there. We've seen
[2:14:06] that. Amen. This time of the year, we've
[2:14:08] seen that a whole lot. Twisting the word
[2:14:10] around.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; It only took one word for Eve to to to
[2:14:16] sell out to the to the serpent creature.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, not one of us sitting here
[2:14:22] this morning, Amen. have the desire to
[2:14:25] quit serving God. There's not one of us
[2:14:27] that woke up this morning and said, "I
[2:14:28] think I'll just quit. I think I'll just
[2:14:30] go on back out in the world." It wasn't
[2:14:32] part of you. It's not part of you. It's
[2:14:35] not who you are because you've been
[2:14:36] redeemed. You've been born again. Amen.
[2:14:38] Nobody wants to fail God. Nobody wants
[2:14:41] to displease God. How many say amen?
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Sometime we do. Sometime we fail, but it
[2:14:47] doesn't define who we are.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 4, when Jesus attempted,
[2:14:53] we mentioned it. Amen. He overcome not
[2:14:56] by the not by himself, not by his
[2:14:59] desires, but by the word of God. The
[2:15:01] psalmist David said in 142, he said, "I
[2:15:04] pour out my complaint before him. I've
[2:15:08] showed him my trouble."
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know where to go. Don't you
[2:15:12] church? Amen. I show him my trouble when
[2:15:14] my spirit was overwhelmed
[2:15:18] within me.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Can you imagine
[2:15:22] David? He was the shoutiness, dancest,
[2:15:26] harp playing music, music musician that
[2:15:28] you could ever find. Amen. Here he is
[2:15:31] saying, "I am overwhelmed."
[2:15:33] Amen. I am totally defeated.
[2:15:38] Amen. But guess what? God doesn't defeat
[2:15:41] you. Amen. I love the story of Joseph
[2:15:44] and I know you've all read it. Amen.
[2:15:46] Jacob, rather. Amen. when he when he
[2:15:48] wrestled with the angel and the and the
[2:15:50] the angel told him said, "Let me go and
[2:15:52] I'm not going to let you go." Whatever.
[2:15:53] And and there there Jacob is laying with
[2:15:55] his hip out of joint. I can identify
[2:15:58] with him. Amen. And and he carried that
[2:16:00] limp for whatever. And God looked down
[2:16:02] at him and said after he had broken, he
[2:16:06] said, "I can't leave him there." Amen.
[2:16:08] Sometime God has to break us.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with being broken. Amen.
[2:16:13] Because the breaking, Amen. Being broken
[2:16:15] is a sign of healing. Amen. You remember
[2:16:18] the story about the little the little
[2:16:19] sheep. Amen. That wouldn't stay in line
[2:16:22] with he's off running here and there.
[2:16:24] After a while, the shepherd had to pick
[2:16:25] him up and he broke his leg. You say,
[2:16:28] "Well, how terrible that is." That
[2:16:30] brother Shelly would preach such a
[2:16:32] message that would hurt people's
[2:16:34] feelings. Sometime he has to break you
[2:16:36] to make you, Amen, what you need to be.
[2:16:39] And that shepherd would take that sheep
[2:16:41] with a little broken leg and he'd put
[2:16:43] him up around his shoulders and he'd
[2:16:45] carry him until that leg healed. And
[2:16:47] then when that leg was healed, he'd put
[2:16:49] him down and he was worse than your
[2:16:50] house cat. You can't get rid of him.
[2:16:52] He's walking all under your feet. Every
[2:16:54] step he take, he's between your legs.
[2:16:56] You can't. That's the way I want to be.
[2:16:58] I want to be so in love with him. He
[2:17:00] can't get rid of me. Everywhere he goes,
[2:17:02] every step he takes, I'm right there
[2:17:04] with him.
[2:17:06] Amen.
[2:17:08] And Lord, if it takes breaking me a time
[2:17:10] or two, break me.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, nothing wrong with
[2:17:14] being broken because I said it's is it's
[2:17:16] a sign of healing. David said, "I poured
[2:17:19] out my complaint before him. I've shued
[2:17:20] before him my trouble." When my spirit
[2:17:23] was overwhelmed within me, thou knowest
[2:17:25] my path.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That word overwhelm means to bury
[2:17:31] beneath or to defeat completely.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I said, "Can you imagine
[2:17:37] David,
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; a man after God's own heart?
[2:17:42] Can you imagine, brother Shel having a
[2:17:44] battle?" Well, he's the pastor. I
[2:17:47] guarantee he has more battles than you
[2:17:48] do.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he's got all of your burdens
[2:17:52] laying on top of him. He's got all your
[2:17:53] lives and all your responsibilities.
[2:17:55] Amen. laying on his shoulder.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's When you When you're going
[2:17:59] through a trial, when you're going
[2:18:00] through sickness, who's suffering? Not
[2:18:02] just you. He is.
[2:18:04] Hello.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're when you're straying a
[2:18:08] little bit from the word and he sees
[2:18:09] your life getting a little bit
[2:18:11] tarnished, who is it that's that's on
[2:18:13] his knees talking to God about it? Lord,
[2:18:15] restore them. Lord, do this. It's your
[2:18:17] pastor.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever don't ever
[2:18:20] underestimate that.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; He was overwhelmed,
[2:18:26] totally defeated. Amen.
[2:18:30] Do you know who you are, church?
[2:18:33] Do you know who you are? We talked about
[2:18:34] the angel coming to Mary last night.
[2:18:36] Amen. God sent a messenger to you and I.
[2:18:39] Amen. To prepare us for a rapture. I
[2:18:42] hope you believe in a rapture. And I
[2:18:44] know that you do. Amen. There's going to
[2:18:46] become a catching away. Amen. In a
[2:18:48] moment, the twinkling of an eye. Amen.
[2:18:51] Let's do a little exper experiment.
[2:18:54] Everybody close your eyes and count to
[2:18:56] three.
[2:18:58] All right. Open your eyes.
[2:19:01] You opened your eyes, you're in New Hope
[2:19:04] Revival Ministry Church. Is that right?
[2:19:07] You realize in the same three seconds
[2:19:09] that you had your eyes closed, you could
[2:19:11] have been in the eternity of God.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; You could have been in the eternity of
[2:19:15] God. That's how quick your life can
[2:19:18] change.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how important it is always
[2:19:22] to be in tune with God. That's how
[2:19:24] important it all it is. Amen. To know
[2:19:27] that God is in control of your life.
[2:19:29] that you're armed with the right thing.
[2:19:32] Amen. To be able to overcome.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you not only have the the
[2:19:38] appearance,
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you have the mechanics, but
[2:19:43] you also have the dynamics.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they all three go together
[2:19:47] to make you a total overcomer. Amen.
[2:19:51] There's a life to be lived.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a life to be manifested.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's according to the word of
[2:19:57] God. That's that's your appearance.
[2:20:00] Amen. And then there's the mechanics.
[2:20:02] You've got the word, but you've got to
[2:20:03] have also a revelation of that word. How
[2:20:06] many people read this Bible every day?
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people open this Bible
[2:20:11] this Sunday morning in their church and
[2:20:12] read, but they never got out of Malachi
[2:20:15] 4? They never got out of re Revelation.
[2:20:18] They never got out of Matthew 28:19 what
[2:20:21] you got.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a difference. Something
[2:20:26] made a difference. I said a little bit
[2:20:28] ago about Moses in the burning bush that
[2:20:30] the bush was still burning. You know the
[2:20:32] the word that came to Moses when when
[2:20:35] the angel spoke to him out of the bush.
[2:20:36] He said, "I have heard the cries of my
[2:20:38] people and I am come down to deliver
[2:20:40] them." Let me tell you something.
[2:20:42] Deliverance is not a thing of the past.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Deliverance is just as real today.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not something that ended with
[2:20:50] our revivals, brother Shel, in the 60s
[2:20:52] and whatever. That deliverance is still
[2:20:54] just as prevalent today as it ever has
[2:20:57] been. And if you want deliverance, I got
[2:20:59] news for you. I can tell you where to
[2:21:01] go.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Of course, you already know that.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell you. That's been
[2:21:07] preached to you for years here. You know
[2:21:09] where to go.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; It's not just knowing who we are.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; It's knowing where we are.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Where we are with God. I mentioned it
[2:21:19] last night. Our precious brother,
[2:21:21] brother Perry Green said many times or
[2:21:24] one time particularly in church, he
[2:21:25] said, "The fact that we're here, not in
[2:21:28] not in the church building here, but the
[2:21:29] fact that we're here in our walk with
[2:21:31] God is evidence that God is going to
[2:21:34] carry us the rest of the way. He did not
[2:21:36] bring me here to lose me. He didn't
[2:21:39] bring you here to turn you loose. He
[2:21:41] didn't bring you this far, amen, not to
[2:21:43] take you the rest of the way. You are
[2:21:45] here because God ordained that you be
[2:21:48] here. and he ordained that you be here
[2:21:50] so you could be there.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; How do we respond to it? How we don't
[2:21:59] going to react to it? Amen. When we wake
[2:22:02] up, does the devil come sniffing around
[2:22:05] seeking? Amen. How he can play the
[2:22:07] doubter and amen. Make us disbelieve the
[2:22:09] word of God. Amen. Well, one good whiff
[2:22:12] of the Holy Ghost, like that little duck
[2:22:15] getting one one whiff of that water, one
[2:22:17] good smell of the Holy Ghost, and he's
[2:22:18] gone. Amen. Those that the son have made
[2:22:22] free are free indeed. Amen. Those that
[2:22:25] the son have made free are free indeed.
[2:22:28] What's that word deed mean? You're free
[2:22:30] in every aspect of your life. Amen.
[2:22:32] You're free of everything the devil can
[2:22:34] bring against you. You're free of it.
[2:22:36] Can the church say, "I'm free." Amen.
[2:22:38] I'm free this morning. Amen. No matter
[2:22:41] what the devil says, I'm free.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Free. Glory to God.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Cartridge number three.
[2:22:50] The greatest weapon that the bride of
[2:22:52] Christ ever possessed was the power of
[2:22:55] prayer.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The communication between you and
[2:22:59] the almighty God.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The ability to talk to the
[2:23:03] creator, amen, of the heavens and the
[2:23:05] earth. The most powerful weapon in our
[2:23:08] arsenal that we have today. Amen. I can
[2:23:11] quote. I can sing. I can do this. But
[2:23:14] the most powerful weapon in my arsenal
[2:23:16] today is the power to be able to
[2:23:18] communicate with God. To have the ear of
[2:23:20] God. To be able to pray and know that
[2:23:22] God is listening to me. The effectual
[2:23:25] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[2:23:27] avaleth a little bit.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Ah availth a much availth much. Amen.
[2:23:33] The effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:23:35] righteous man. Amen. Avaleth much.
[2:23:39] that communication that we have with
[2:23:41] God, the most powerful weapon in our
[2:23:43] arsenal today, church. Amen. Even
[2:23:45] brother Brandham said that the prayer is
[2:23:47] the most powerful weapon ever put into
[2:23:49] the hands of mankind.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power, the faith, Amen, shall
[2:23:54] save the sick, whatever it is.
[2:23:57] Amen.
[2:24:00] when you pray.
[2:24:03] The reformer Martin Luther said the
[2:24:05] characteristics of a cobbler is to make
[2:24:07] shoes. He said the characteristics of a
[2:24:10] of a Christian is to pray.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; So, well, do we pray enough? Probably
[2:24:15] not. Amen.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Probably something we all could elevate
[2:24:19] our lives a little bit more, talk to him
[2:24:21] a little bit more. Amen. Cuz I don't
[2:24:24] know about you because every time I
[2:24:25] start to pray, the devil comes along
[2:24:26] with something else.
[2:24:28] Every time I want to sit down and pray
[2:24:29] and have have conversation with God,
[2:24:31] here comes the devil with something
[2:24:32] that's got this job or that job or
[2:24:34] something else or something you got to
[2:24:36] do. Always mind always battling in that
[2:24:39] mind.
[2:24:40] But once we have a breakthrough that and
[2:24:42] we have that con we enter into that
[2:24:44] spirit of prayer, we enter into that
[2:24:46] into that that avenue of communication
[2:24:49] with God. Do you know the greatest
[2:24:51] failure in relationships today is a lack
[2:24:53] of communication. You want a marriage to
[2:24:56] fail, you let the husband and wife quit
[2:24:58] communicating. You let them quit talking
[2:25:00] to one another. Amen. It will fail. You
[2:25:03] want your relationship with God to fail,
[2:25:04] you quit talking to him.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he desires to hear you. He
[2:25:11] desires to hear you tell him, "I love
[2:25:13] you."
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Because he wants to tell you he loves
[2:25:18] you also.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:21] The most power you when when when the
[2:25:23] when the bride of Christ goes to her
[2:25:25] knees, hell
[2:25:29] trembles.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; I remember a story about DL Moody.
[2:25:33] Everybody knows DL Moody. [snorts] He
[2:25:36] went to build his church in in in in
[2:25:38] Chicago and he found a piece of property
[2:25:41] that he wanted and he went to the real
[2:25:43] estate company and he told the real
[2:25:45] estate agent, "I want to buy such and
[2:25:47] such a property down on such and such a
[2:25:49] street, such and such an address." The
[2:25:51] real estate agent was real happy because
[2:25:53] it was a valuable piece of property had
[2:25:56] a had a nice p price tag on it. And um
[2:26:00] the real estate agent said, "Well, the
[2:26:02] price is this." And Mr. Mr. Moody says,
[2:26:04] "Well, I can't pay that." He said,
[2:26:06] "Well, what can you pay?" He said,
[2:26:08] "Well, I could pay some dollar." And it
[2:26:10] was some ridiculous amount really. And
[2:26:15] he said, "Well, you may as well go on.
[2:26:16] We're not going to sell you that
[2:26:17] property." So, DL Moody left and the
[2:26:20] boss came in and he asked the agent
[2:26:22] said, "Who was that older gentleman in
[2:26:24] here?" So, all that was that preacher
[2:26:25] down the street there. So, what did he
[2:26:27] want? He wanted to buy that piece of
[2:26:28] property down the road there. Why didn't
[2:26:30] you sell it to him? He offered some
[2:26:32] ridiculous price. What did you tell him?
[2:26:34] I told him to go. He said, "Oh Lord, you
[2:26:36] should have give it to him. Now he's
[2:26:38] going to get it for free."
[2:26:40] Because Dio Muda said, "Well, I'll just
[2:26:42] pray about it." He said, "Now he's going
[2:26:44] to get it for free." So see the See, the
[2:26:46] devil recognized if if the people ever
[2:26:48] start praying, he's in trouble.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the agent, the boss told the
[2:26:53] agent said, "You should have sold it to
[2:26:55] him for what he asked. Now he's going to
[2:26:56] get it for free." Amen. Now we've got it
[2:26:59] for free. See the price has already been
[2:27:02] paid. Prayer has made it free. Amen.
[2:27:05] Prayer has opened the door. Prayer is
[2:27:07] done in everything. Effectual fervent
[2:27:09] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[2:27:12] Watch and pray. He said that you enter
[2:27:14] not in temptation. Amen. I told you at
[2:27:17] the beginning of the message, we're in a
[2:27:18] battle. We're fighting every day. And
[2:27:20] the the the battle that we're fighting
[2:27:22] is not conventional. And if God hadn't
[2:27:24] meant for us to fight, if he didn't know
[2:27:26] we were going to be in a fight, why did
[2:27:28] he ever give us all this armor? Amen.
[2:27:30] When you've done all that you know to do
[2:27:32] to stand stand having his feet shot with
[2:27:34] the preparation of the gospel you loan
[2:27:36] ski about with truth shield of faith the
[2:27:38] sword of the spirit. Amen. The helmet of
[2:27:40] salvation. God knew that you were going
[2:27:43] to be in a battle
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; but he gave you everything that you
[2:27:46] needed. He did only thing he did he
[2:27:48] forgot brother Martin uh Daniel he
[2:27:50] forgot to give us anything for the
[2:27:52] backside.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Wonder why he did that. wonder if why he
[2:27:57] forgive for forgot to give us anything
[2:27:59] for the backside. Could you could you
[2:28:02] believe that maybe he didn't want his
[2:28:04] people running? Amen. Away from the
[2:28:06] battle. Amen. He wanted them running
[2:28:09] toward the battle.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted them going going
[2:28:12] forward. Amen. There's nothing there's
[2:28:15] nothing for defeat. Listen, church. You
[2:28:17] turn your back on God, you turn away
[2:28:19] from God, you're in trouble
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; cuz you don't have anything to defend
[2:28:22] for you.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as long as you're going
[2:28:25] forward, as long as you're facing God,
[2:28:27] as long as you're taking on the battle,
[2:28:29] as long as you're waving the weapon, let
[2:28:31] me tell you something. You got something
[2:28:32] to to to go forward with you.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; You got something to go forward with.
[2:28:38] Arm yourselves. Be ready.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Because God's got an answer on the way.
[2:28:45] I love the song Brother Shelley sung
[2:28:46] last night. The answer's on the way.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Before you ever got sick, you were
[2:28:52] healed. Before
[2:28:55] you ever got here, you were a bride.
[2:28:57] Amen. Prophet said you were said you
[2:28:59] were a Christian before you became a
[2:29:01] Christian. Amen. The answer is already
[2:29:03] here. Before you ever got sick, healing
[2:29:06] was already on the way. Amen. God had
[2:29:08] already made provision for it. Before
[2:29:10] you ever had any situation in your life,
[2:29:13] God had already made a way. Amen. When
[2:29:16] you start praying, when you got a
[2:29:17] sickness or pain, look up because you
[2:29:19] can see the answer's already on its way.
[2:29:23] It's already on its way, church. Amen.
[2:29:27] Arm yourselves. Be ready for your
[2:29:30] adversary. Amen. To seeking whom he may
[2:29:32] devour.
[2:29:34] He went before God. See, he's he's not
[2:29:37] afraid even to approach this the the the
[2:29:39] Almighty. Amen. When the sons of God
[2:29:42] came together, the scripture said that
[2:29:44] the devil came also.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; And God looked at him and said, "Where
[2:29:48] you been? What you doing?" He said,
[2:29:49] "I've been out here seeking whom I may
[2:29:51] devour." Amen. Looking for somebody.
[2:29:54] Amen. When you walk out the door today,
[2:29:55] he's going to be on the outside
[2:29:58] surveying you and looking see if you got
[2:29:59] enough this morning to keep you through
[2:30:01] the rest of the week
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; or to Tuesday night when you come back
[2:30:04] for a refreshing.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; You forgive me for that little those
[2:30:10] little illustrations, but he's he's
[2:30:12] aware. Amen. But but when they came
[2:30:15] together and God said, "Have you
[2:30:17] considered my servant Job?" Brother
[2:30:20] Greley, I believe he included you with
[2:30:22] Job.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Have you considered my
[2:30:25] servant Jo? I believe he included you."
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just talking about Job. He was
[2:30:30] talking about you and you and you and
[2:30:32] you and you. Amen.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I wasn't there." Sure you
[2:30:36] were.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; But what he was saying, Amen. You've got
[2:30:41] a hedge built around him.
[2:30:44] Can you see the devil just destroying
[2:30:45] you? You got to hedge me. That's a
[2:30:46] reason. What's wrong with that? Amen.
[2:30:48] Jesus be a fence all around me every
[2:30:51] every day.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; What is that hedge? What is that? What
[2:30:57] is that shield? Amen.
[2:30:59] I preached a little message one time on
[2:31:01] the boundaries. Stay within the
[2:31:03] boundaries. When I was growing up, Amen.
[2:31:05] the kids get ill with one another and we
[2:31:07] get kind of scuffling whether we draw a
[2:31:08] line on the sand and we dare somebody.
[2:31:11] Don't you step across that line because
[2:31:13] you step across that line, we're going
[2:31:14] to go at it. Amen. Well, let me tell you
[2:31:16] something. God's drawn a line in the
[2:31:18] sand. Amen. And he's told the devil, you
[2:31:20] can't step across that line.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may make him sick. You may
[2:31:25] take his car. You may take his house.
[2:31:26] You may ruin his bank account. But you
[2:31:28] can't touch his life because that life
[2:31:30] is my life. Amen. And you can't touch
[2:31:32] me.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The line's drawn, church. It's not
[2:31:38] drawn a line in the sand, but it's drawn
[2:31:40] a line of blood. Amen. He can't cross
[2:31:42] that bloodline.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't come across it.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Arm yourselves with the mind of Christ
[2:31:52] while the musicians come. Arm yourself
[2:31:55] with a token. You're armed with a token.
[2:31:57] You're armed with the power of prayer.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are an overcomer. Jesus spoke
[2:32:04] about it numerous times and we've read
[2:32:06] it and the scripture says in
[2:32:07] Revelations. Amen. That if we overcome,
[2:32:11] Amen. He will grant to us that we can
[2:32:13] sit on the throne as he has overcome and
[2:32:15] sit on the throne with his father.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; The adversary is all around. He's He's
[2:32:23] looking for one little weak place in
[2:32:25] defense.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; He's looking for one little place, Amen.
[2:32:28] that maybe you haven't prayed enough
[2:32:30] this week. you haven't read your Bible
[2:32:32] enough this week. See, when we do those
[2:32:35] things, those those that prayer life and
[2:32:37] that that scripture reading, those
[2:32:38] things become weak. And when they become
[2:32:40] weak, it gives the devil access, amen,
[2:32:43] to get through to us.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if we arm oursel with with
[2:32:48] with all these things and the adversary
[2:32:50] comes, we're able to stand.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're able to overcome.
[2:32:57] We're able to defeat him.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Christ has armed his servants,
[2:33:04] amen, to battle.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; He's given us what we need today to be
[2:33:08] an overcomer. Can you say amen?
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever, whatever, whatever the battle
[2:33:13] is, God has given you.
[2:33:17] Now, as I mentioned earlier, I heard
[2:33:19] these brothers talking about hunting.
[2:33:22] Look, [clears throat] there's all
[2:33:23] different kinds of guns. Amen.
[2:33:27] Now brothers, if I'm wrong, if I if I
[2:33:30] cross your line, you forgive me. But I
[2:33:32] have a had a friend passed away, gone on
[2:33:34] to be the with the Lord. When he go
[2:33:36] squirrel hunting, he'd go squirrel
[2:33:37] hunting with a shotgun. And I used to
[2:33:40] tell him, "You blowing that little old
[2:33:42] squirrel all the pieces. You going to
[2:33:44] have so much buck shot him, you ain't
[2:33:45] going to be eat him." I've always
[2:33:46] squirrel hunted with a rifle, with a 22
[2:33:49] or something. And there's all different
[2:33:51] calibers and all different types of
[2:33:53] weapons. Amen. when it comes to the to
[2:33:56] the natural warfare. Amen. You go into
[2:33:58] the arsenal and you see everything from
[2:34:00] a from a slingshot of David up to a
[2:34:03] ballistic missile or what are just
[2:34:05] numerous beyond what you can imagine.
[2:34:08] It's the same way with the word of God.
[2:34:10] Listen, these three little cartridges is
[2:34:12] certainly not all that we are armed with
[2:34:14] today to be an overcomer. We have the
[2:34:17] full gospel. We have the full word of
[2:34:19] God. We have everything that God was.
[2:34:21] Amen. that he poured into Christ and
[2:34:23] that Christ poured into the church. We
[2:34:25] have every bit of that, amen, to arm
[2:34:28] ourselves to be overcomers today.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; And we're living under the spirit of an
[2:34:33] hour, amen, that is totally contrary to
[2:34:35] God. We're living under a spirit of the
[2:34:38] hour, amen, that is that everything
[2:34:41] about our the the the world that we live
[2:34:43] in is contrary to God. Politics,
[2:34:46] finances, everything is against God.
[2:34:50] And you have to stand. You may stand
[2:34:52] alone, but when you've done all that you
[2:34:54] know to do, don't tie a knot in the end
[2:34:57] of the rope. Stand.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; Having yourself armed with the armor to
[2:35:04] fight the battle.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; God has given it to you today. God bless
[2:35:08] you. Stand with me.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; I hope that we've encouraged you a
[2:35:13] little bit
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; to give the devil one more round.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:19] Give him one more round. The next time
[2:35:20] he come, just hold up the word.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Here it is." Amen. I'm
[2:35:26] covered by the blood.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; Father, thank you for your precious word
[2:35:30] today in your spirit. Thank you for the
[2:35:32] song service and the movement of the
[2:35:34] Holy Spirit that we felt within our
[2:35:36] midst this morning. I pray that we've
[2:35:38] been able to say something that will
[2:35:39] encourage the hearts of your people. I
[2:35:42] pray that you take it with the cords of
[2:35:43] Holy Spirit and bind it up in a spirit
[2:35:46] of love and give it to them and let them
[2:35:48] know Lord how much I appreciate them and
[2:35:51] how much I hope that the word of God has
[2:35:52] been a blessing to them. Keep us all in
[2:35:55] the center of your perfect word in Jesus
[2:35:57] name. Amen. God bless you. Let's give
[2:36:00] the Lord a big clap offering. Tell him I
[2:36:02] have the victory.
[2:36:08] [applause]
[2:36:15] Hallelujah.

[2:45:14] Father, would you give us the grace?
[2:45:18] Some have not been fighting. Some have
[2:45:20] been just taking the punches.
[2:45:23] Would you raise us up today?
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; It may look different for one than it
[2:45:30] does another, but may we leave here
[2:45:32] today determined
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; to take our place on the battlefield.
[2:45:40] And as your prophet said, to defeat the
[2:45:42] enemy before it defeats us.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; You have equipped us with all that we
[2:45:49] need.
[2:45:51] Your word is life.

[2:45:58] we pray,

[2:46:05] Lord, thank you for giving us access.
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you for telling us to come as we
[2:46:12] are.
[2:46:14] We don't have to get good enough to call
[2:46:17] out.

[2:46:20] and you deliver and you free us. Thank
[2:46:23] you. Thank you, Lord.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; Would you just lift your hand to him and

[2:46:30] that needs to be taken care of as we
[2:46:33] yield different layers of our life to
[2:46:35] him.
[2:46:37] He walks us through the present. He
[2:46:39] walks us through the past.
[2:46:41] He prepares us for the future.
[2:46:45] That's who he is.
[2:46:48] Lord, we thank you that the battle
[2:46:50] belongs to you and the most that we do

[2:48:14] to sing it like you [music] mean it.

[2:50:30] And let's agree
[2:50:32] together [singing and music]
[2:50:35] that all of our eneies
[2:50:40] will crumble at our feet.
[2:50:46] For whatever we bind on earth, it's
[2:50:51] already been bound in heaven.
[2:50:57] And at the name of Jesus, [music]
[2:51:02] oh, Satan has to flee. I still believe
[2:51:07] he has to flee. We've got the power.

[2:51:49] [singing] of the Lord.
[2:51:52] Sing this part again. For many years
[2:51:57] [music] now,
[2:51:59] oh, Satan's tried
[2:52:02] to stop us. [music]
[2:52:04] But the little bride
[2:52:07] of Jesus, [music and singing]
[2:52:10] we are still alive, still fighting,
[2:52:15] [music] still pressing like a mighty
[2:52:19] army.
[2:52:22] We keep marching [music]
[2:52:25] onward.
[2:52:28] We're winning every battle
[2:52:33] with the Lord by our side. [music]
[2:52:37] The last time. Sing it. We've got the
[2:52:42] power

[2:53:04] Though Satan rages and he howls and he
[2:53:08] huffs and puffs and he rages, [music]
[2:53:12] he cannot defeat the word in you. We've
[2:53:16] got
[2:53:18] [music]
[2:53:21] In the name of [music]
[2:53:24] the Lord. [singing]
[2:53:27] Do you believe that?
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout.
[2:53:35] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; That was pretty good for Methodist.
[2:53:46] Let's do it one more time. Let's give
[2:53:48] him a real shout. Would you do it with
[2:53:50] me now? Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:53:53] Hallelujah to the King of Kings.
[2:53:58] He reigns.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; He triumphs.
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; He's our victory.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to hear me carefully.
[2:54:11] Can you play something that'll make
[2:54:12] people listen to me? something soft and
[2:54:16] and sweet.
[2:54:18] I I want to say just a few things and it
[2:54:20] won't take me long. I know what you're
[2:54:22] thinking and I know I know I know I get
[2:54:24] it. But I'm going to obey the Lord.
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; If it hair liips the devil and bankrupts
[2:54:30] hell.
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what he laid on my
[2:54:33] heart. A couple of things quickly.
[2:54:36] One is you may not be comfortable with
[2:54:39] the analogy
[2:54:42] of a gun or war, but you don't get to
[2:54:46] choose what's already written in the
[2:54:48] book.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; This whole journey as a believer has
[2:54:53] been it has been compared to war,
[2:54:58] warfare, fighting, swords,
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; the whole armor of God.
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. breastplate, helmet.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; You You don't dress up like that to go
[2:55:09] to a wedding.
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; You dress up like that to go to a
[2:55:12] battle.
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; And maybe you're just waking up to the
[2:55:16] fact that you're in a battle.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; But you're not going to win the battle
[2:55:20] with sweet talk.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to win it with
[2:55:24] faith
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; and by using the weapons that we have
[2:55:27] been given.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Um, guns make me nervous a little bit.
[2:55:32] And so, um, when when [music] our
[2:55:34] brother said, "I'm going to have a
[2:55:36] little illustration in the bag," you
[2:55:38] know, I'm thinking he's going to bring
[2:55:40] out a little, I don't know, a cup and
[2:55:43] some water or some little
[2:55:46] I had no idea it'd be metal and shaped
[2:55:50] like that. So, I have to be honest and
[2:55:52] tell you, made me a little bit nervous,
[2:55:54] especially as it's going around in the
[2:55:55] air. He's holding it up to his head. But
[2:55:59] the reality,
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; I get it.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; And it touched me. It spoke to me.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; And and and he's right. You'll never
[2:56:08] forget it.
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; And what he spoke was the truth and
[2:56:11] nothing but the truth. And here's what
[2:56:14] the Lord took me to in in a message that
[2:56:17] I would have we're we're almost to to
[2:56:20] page uh 36 in the Samson series.
[2:56:25] We're almost there. and and I'm glad I
[2:56:28] had the weekend off cuz I've been
[2:56:30] blessed. But this is where we would have
[2:56:32] been. Now listen at what he said. This
[2:56:34] is from the message just once more Lord.
[2:56:38] This was 1963,
[2:56:40] [music] December the 1st of 1963
[2:56:44] in Shriefport.
[2:56:46] There's a V in Shreveport. Brother
[2:56:48] Brandham didn't seem to know that
[2:56:49] there's a V there. Shrivefeport. And I
[2:56:52] noticed that Jordan uh Peterson was here
[2:56:55] and he kept saying it just like brother
[2:56:56] Brandham said. Shreport. There's a V
[2:56:59] there. Shriveport. And here's what
[2:57:01] brother Brandham tells us in paragraph
[2:57:03] 125 and 126. And I want you to hear this
[2:57:06] carefully and you will have it if you
[2:57:08] could find it and put it up. He said,
[2:57:10] "Listen,
[2:57:12] destroy your enemy."
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; Before your enemy destroys you.
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; Now, he's preaching on Samson.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; Destroy your enemy before your enemy
[2:57:33] destroys you. He said he'll do it.
[2:57:37] Bring back the oldfashioned meetings
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; and the thing and oh, leave Delilah
[2:57:44] alone.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; Leave the world alone. The thing that
[2:57:49] woos you off into little things that you
[2:57:53] shouldn't.
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; The reality is some of you don't need
[2:57:57] the internet.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; Disconnect it. You don't need it. Come
[2:58:04] on.
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't live without
[2:58:07] it." You did
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; and you will again.
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; Some of us don't need cell phones. We
[2:58:14] don't need them
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; because it I don't know if there's
[2:58:18] payoneses or not, but you can always
[2:58:20] borrow somebody's phone. But sometimes
[2:58:23] it's really good to put away,
[2:58:28] to separate ourselves, to defeat the
[2:58:30] enemy, to destroy the enemy
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; before he destroys us.
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; Some people are going to have to make
[2:58:38] radical decisions.
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't believe that's
[2:58:41] biblical, you didn't read the red
[2:58:43] letters.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the red letters he said
[2:58:47] if your eye offends you
[2:58:50] what he said.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; Now now he was not suggesting that we
[2:58:54] physically pluck out our eye. What he
[2:58:56] was suggesting is that we become
[2:58:59] radically committed.
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; To doing whatever is within our power to
[2:59:06] defeat our enemy
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; before he defeats us.
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; If your right arm offend you, he said
[2:59:12] cut it off. It'd be better to go through
[2:59:14] life maim
[2:59:16] and be whole in the kingdom of God.
[2:59:19] &gt;&gt; He's not telling you to amputate the
[2:59:21] members of your of your flesh. This body
[2:59:23] is to be honored because it's the gift
[2:59:25] of God to you. But he is telling us that
[2:59:28] sometimes we have to be radical about
[2:59:32] destroying what the enemy is sending
[2:59:34] toward us to destroy us.
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; Anybody feel any witness on that?
[2:59:40] He said, "Leave the world alone, the
[2:59:43] thing that woos you off into little
[2:59:46] things that you shouldn't." He said,
[2:59:48] "And little things, troubles, uh, come
[2:59:51] up in the church and you won't stand
[2:59:54] correction because you don't have to.
[2:59:57] You can drop off to another church and
[2:59:59] things like that." In the early days,
[3:00:01] when a man didn't cope up with the word
[3:00:04] of God, they packed him out.
[3:00:10] dead.
[3:00:12] And I want you to see what brother 1963
[3:00:15] December 1st seals are preached.
[3:00:19] And I want you to see what he says in
[3:00:21] the very next paragraph.
[3:00:23] Bring us back.
[3:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; Are you are you listening?
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; Bring us back to Pentecost.
[3:00:36] He's not talking about denominational
[3:00:38] Pentecost.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; He's talking about birth
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; and experience. Brother Brandham said,
[3:00:44] "I'm Pentecostal from the top of my head
[3:00:46] to the soles of my feet."
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; Not denominational, but by personal
[3:00:51] experience. Bring us back to Pentecost.
[3:00:54] Not Hollywood showmanship, but a
[3:00:57] wholehearted turn to God is what we
[3:01:00] need. Once more, oh Lord.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Once more. That's my amen. Yes, sir.
[3:01:06] &gt;&gt; That's my amen to what we heard today.
[3:01:09] &gt;&gt; We must destroy our enemy
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; before he destroys us. God, grant us
[3:01:15] grant us the grace
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; and the faith and the and the radical
[3:01:20] commitment
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; to do whatever we need to do within
[3:01:25] reason, within the parameters of your
[3:01:28] word,
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; and within the in the realm of common
[3:01:31] sense. because some people are missing
[3:01:34] it.
[3:01:35] Grant us that that we don't do anything
[3:01:39] that would not be pleasing to you. But
[3:01:42] Lord, if a separation from something is
[3:01:45] what we need, give us grace.
[3:01:49] I'd rather be embarrassed
[3:01:51] to say, "Can I borrow your phone for a
[3:01:53] phone call?"
[3:01:55] than to have that thing in my pocket and
[3:01:57] constantly war with looking at something
[3:02:00] that is not edifying
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; and pleasing to God. There is no
[3:02:05] condemnation in what I'm saying.
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; I I I know the struggle. I know how he
[3:02:11] operates. But you've got the power.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; I have the power. It's in the name. It's
[3:02:18] in the word. It's in the pardon.
[3:02:20] Hallelujah.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus signed my pardon. We sang.
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; This I surely know. Took my place at
[3:02:28] Calvary so I don't have to go. All my
[3:02:32] life I give him. He gave his for me when
[3:02:35] he signed my pardon
[3:02:38] at Calvary. How many of you believe he
[3:02:41] signed your pardon?
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Glory be to God.
[3:02:47] Glory be to God. Just just give me a
[3:02:50] moment. We're closing. Glory.
[3:02:59] Thank you, Jesus.
[3:03:02] Lord, as we leave this place today,
[3:03:06] I want to just a minute. I'm coming out
[3:03:09] of prayer moment. I want to acknowledge
[3:03:12] Sister Jada. Uh, not that it needs to be
[3:03:15] acknowledged, but I want to I want you
[3:03:17] all to know that that took a lot. That's
[3:03:20] not her nature to do like that. But she
[3:03:23] did that uh spontaneous and inspired
[3:03:27] because she's been fighting some
[3:03:28] battles. She's been going through
[3:03:30] something and she's making some some
[3:03:33] preparation for the victory that God
[3:03:35] has. And she she put that that banner
[3:03:39] together and she wanted to use that. And
[3:03:43] I sent her I sent her this. Let Let me
[3:03:46] read you one more thing. I knew you'd
[3:03:48] get up behind Brother John and preach.
[3:03:50] Well, you know, I I don't even feel like
[3:03:53] apologizing.
[3:03:55] Uh u I I got my own parking place here.
[3:03:59] So, I I'm I got some attachment to this
[3:04:02] place. I wonder I want to read you
[3:04:05] quickly what he said. He said, "You
[3:04:07] know, there's something about about song
[3:04:10] that's got power in it."
[3:04:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He said, 'We aware of that. That
[3:04:14] said, look at look at the army when they
[3:04:16] sing the songs and play the music. Do
[3:04:19] you know the approach to war in the army
[3:04:22] of God is first by music?
[3:04:27] &gt;&gt; He said the singers went before the ark
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; rejoicing and singing. Then come the ark
[3:04:36] and then the battle. How many of you
[3:04:38] know the ark represented the presence?
[3:04:41] So the singing went first, the presence
[3:04:43] followed behind, and what was next?
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; The battle.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; God preparing for the battle that's
[3:04:50] coming. He said the singers went before
[3:04:53] the ark, rejoicing and singing. Then
[3:04:55] come the ark and then the battle. That's
[3:04:57] right. So he said that's the right
[3:04:58] approach. And the that's the reason we
[3:05:01] come in the service at night. What do we
[3:05:03] do? We sing the hymns of the Lord and
[3:05:06] then the ark. The word. Read the word
[3:05:10] and then the battle.
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; Now is the battle.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; Right here. It's in these moments after
[3:05:19] the word goes forth that a decision is
[3:05:21] made.
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; Every time. Every time. We're making a
[3:05:25] decision now. Are we going to take this
[3:05:28] word and use it to whip the devil?
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; Or are we going to let a few things that
[3:05:33] we don't get or or things uh that we
[3:05:35] don't understand exactly, are we going
[3:05:37] to let that keep us from receiving any
[3:05:39] of it? I'm taking it all. I'm taking it
[3:05:42] all. Back to what he said. He said, "So,
[3:05:45] uh, that's the reason we come in the
[3:05:46] service. Sing the hymns of the Lord,
[3:05:48] then the ark, the word, read the word,
[3:05:50] and then the battle we're in." He said,
[3:05:52] "So the great banners are flying."
[3:05:56] That's right.
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:05:59] &gt;&gt; The great banners are flying tonight.
[3:06:01] The name of Jesus Christ.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's it.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:06:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord God may be exalted and the
[3:06:10] enemy.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; Be put to flight.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "And God win the victory
[3:06:20] tonight. Save souls. Heal the sick and
[3:06:22] the afflicted. cause those that are
[3:06:24] weary and stooped low to raise up their
[3:06:28] heads and rejoice
[3:06:30] &gt;&gt; get great glory unto himself. For we ask
[3:06:34] this in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; So I just wanted you to know that that
[3:06:40] is absolutely scriptural to make up your
[3:06:44] mind. I'm going to win this thing. I'm
[3:06:47] going to declare the name of Jesus over
[3:06:50] every situation and every circumstance
[3:06:53] of my life. How many of you believe it
[3:06:55] works?
[3:06:57] &gt;&gt; Father, go with us today. Pour strength
[3:07:00] and virtue and rest and peace into our
[3:07:04] brother
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; uh as he plans to leave us later this
[3:07:09] afternoon and drive a little piece of
[3:07:10] the way. Lord, would you take him safely
[3:07:14] all the way home in your timing? And
[3:07:18] would you refresh him and renew him and
[3:07:20] reward him for being your mouthpiece to
[3:07:23] us, a vessel to us? There were so many
[3:07:27] nuggets this morning, so many precious
[3:07:31] treasures that I can hold on to and I
[3:07:35] can wave them like a banner in victory
[3:07:39] and I can use them like weapons against
[3:07:42] the enemy of my own soul. Thank you for
[3:07:46] brother John Thornton. Thank you for the
[3:07:49] call of God on his life. And thank you
[3:07:52] for sustaining him these years and
[3:07:55] beyond to do your will, to do your work.
[3:07:58] H in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[3:08:01] Christ, go with us and keep us all. And
[3:08:04] the saint said,
[3:08:06] &gt;&gt; and the saint said,
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[3:08:10] I love what I feel right now. It's just
[3:08:13] peace. I just take peace with me. and
[3:08:16] and I take it and I sometimes you have
[3:08:18] to use that to defeat the enemy.
[3:08:20] Wonderful peace. Every need you have can
[3:08:24] be met because of his wonderful presence
[3:08:26] that's here. Do you believe that?
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want us to uh sing as we leave.
[3:08:32] Victory is mine. Amen. You're dismissed
[3:08:36] to go tonight or this afternoon in the
[3:08:38] name of the Lord. Tuesday night at 7:00.
[3:08:41] You know you know what's next. God bless
[3:08:44] you as you go. Victory is mine. Victory
[3:08:49] is mine.
[3:08:51] Victory today is mine.
[3:08:54] Go home and get [music] your lunch and
[3:08:57] bring it back quickly.
[3:08:59] There's plenty for everybody. If you
[3:09:02] didn't bring any, you [music] go down
[3:09:03] anyway and we'll be there when we can.
[3:09:06] Victory is my [music] victory.
[3:09:10] Oh, victory today is mine.
[3:09:15] Oh, now I told Satan
[3:09:19] get my victory today.
[3:09:24] Amen.
[3:09:27] Victory is mine.
[3:09:29] Oh, there's so many.
[3:09:32] Victory today is mine.
[3:09:36] Well, now I told [music] Satan, you get
[3:09:40] me behind.
[3:09:42] Victory today is mine.
[3:09:46] One more time. Victory [music]
[3:09:48] is mine. Victory is mine. Victory
[3:09:52] [music]
[3:09:53] today is mine. Lord,
[3:09:58] oh Satan,
[3:10:00] get me behind. Thank you, honey.
[3:10:04] Oh, [music] thank you.
[3:10:13] Oh, that's amazing.
