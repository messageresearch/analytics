[0:03] but you better come boldly because that
[0:06] is your privilege
[0:08] [Music]
[0:14] there's a throne of grace
[0:16] there's a throne of grace that belongs
[0:19] to you and I
[0:21] Hebrews 4 16 says let us therefore
[0:25] [Music]
[0:27] come how
[0:29] boldly
[0:32] you may come broken
[0:35] but you better come boldly you may come
[0:38] weepy

[0:52] [Music]
[0:54] you're not intimidated to come you're
[0:56] invited to come
[0:58] in fact you're commanded to come your
[1:01] presence is not only invited he demands
[1:03] that you come and stand at the throne of
[1:06] grace you're a subject in the Kingdom
[1:08] then when the king says come before my
[1:10] throne
[1:12] and you say but I can't Lord because
[1:14] I've been yielding the Temptation or
[1:16] because I've been doing this or I've
[1:18] been thinking that or I've been having
[1:19] struggles with that he said come boldly
[1:23] before my Throne because if you come to
[1:26] the throne of grace boldly you will
[1:28] obtain
[1:30] Mercy Mercy how many of you know we need
[1:34] mercy and guess what else we'll do guess
[1:38] what he gives out at the throne of grace
[1:39] it's not just Mercy he gives
[1:42] he said that we may obtain mercy and
[1:45] find unmerited favor undeserved favor
[1:48] Grace
[1:50] to help in time of
[1:53] so this concept church that you've got
[1:56] to be you know good to come and pray and
[1:59] you've got to be you've got to have it
[2:01] all together to come and worship
[2:03] well I just can't believe that
[2:08] you don't stomp up here boldly in your
[2:11] sin
[2:13] you you don't let your arrogance and
[2:16] your pride cause you to ignore the fact
[2:19] that you are struggling
[2:22] but you must not let condemnation keep
[2:24] you out because he's not just inviting
[2:27] you and bidding you he's commanding he's
[2:29] demanding that you come and show
[2:31] yourself to the King of Kings and the
[2:33] Lord of lords everything we deal with on
[2:36] a personal or family level can be
[2:38] brought to the throne of grace
[2:40] [Music]
[2:41] at this Throne or in this heavenly
[2:43] courtroom we can obtain mercy and find
[2:46] Grace to help in our time of need we
[2:48] must learn to come boldly before the
[2:49] throne of grace no shame no condemnation
[2:52] but filled with faith
[2:54] [Music]
