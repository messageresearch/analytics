TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Bible is so clear you'd be surprised how many times the word jealousy appears how many times the word envy appears and it almost always appears in the context of Christian Life is't that crazy the Bible has little to say about Sinners being envious or or ungodly men being jealous the Bible mainly talks about Believers Christians spirit filled folk dealing with Envy I want what you got and we learned that this was something that was formed in the heart of Lucifer and the next thing you know he said I'm going to put my Throne up there above God's Throne come on that selfish ambition is what led him to that great civil war that took place in the Realms of the spirit where he was able to persuade a great portion of the angels to follow him instead of the reality of their creator he's still doing that today he's still filling people with conceit he's making egomaniacs out of people he's plaguing even the body of Christ with narcissistic behavior where people think the whole church should revolve around them or the whole family should revolve around them even the whole world should revolve around them and all of it goes back to Satan's ambition no one wants to live their life tiptoeing around fragile envious jealous people why don't we teach our children that for instance every family just doesn't have the same thing in life it just doesn't happen that way but it's not good to be envious or jealous it's good to be thankful to be grateful to be blessed by what God has given us but the reality is that many times God will give you what he can trust you with so if we work on our character then God can often trust us with more I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind whose heart is stayed is fixed on me God said one of the benefits of keeping your mind on me is I'll help you to have calmness I'll help you to have wholeness I'll I'll help you to to live in a place of of Peace instead of worry and anxiety folks we need that let God do the work let him exalt let him lift up in the modern Church everybody has to have a title they put it on their business card Apostle so and so Prophet so and so uh intercessor so and so you you you don't have to have a title just yield to God let God have his way in your life and if you're to be promoted guess what he knows how to promote us
