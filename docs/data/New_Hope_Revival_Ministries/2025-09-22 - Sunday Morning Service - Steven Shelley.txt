As we approach the throne of grace, &gt;&gt; we come boldly bringing our petitions to him. &gt;&gt; Do you have a need that you just want to lift your hand in the air? Say, "I have a need." Out across the stream, as you join us in this service, and you've probably lifted your hand, the Lord sees the need that you have, and he knows how to meet that need. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Continue to remember brother Bobby Wartz. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And his family to the Lord that God would move on their behalf. And this may sound a little odd to request prayer for somebody like this, but uh we saw the Hoppers last night and the mom and dad aren't able to travel anymore. And I'm only mentioning it because Claude and brother Bobby are very close friends. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; And so I I was able to speak to Dean last night and both his mom and his dad are very ill. They're both sick, very ill, and need a touch from the Lord. And as we were sharing our friendship with Bobby, he mentioned that and let's let's just remember them. You know, we we I I can appreciate anybody that has lifted up the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate that. So, let's go to God in prayer on their behalf. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Claude and Connie Hopper. Let's remember our nation today. Many executives gathering in the west are asking God's protection upon that gathering between 70 and 100,000 people. &gt;&gt; The stadium only holds 60,000. &gt;&gt; But they're saying there could be between 70 and 100,000 people. That's &gt;&gt; a lot of people. [Music] Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory. Glory and honor. Gloryy and honor and power. For thou hast created, hast all things created. Thou hast created all things [Applause] and for thy pleasure [Music] created thou art worthy. Brother RJ, will you come and pray today, please? Oh yes, thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy, oh Lord, [Music] to receive glory. Gloryy and honor, gloryy and honor. and pray. For thou hast created, hast all things created. Thou hast created all things. And for thy pleasure they are creat. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you father. &gt;&gt; Yes yes yes. We thank you for the revelation, Lord, that you overcame. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when you entered into those heavens with your blood, Lord, you sat down, because your work was finished. And we thank you, oh God, that seated in that heavenly realm. You poured out your spirit upon men as an earnest, as a down payment for the house that you desire to occupy. And we're living in an hour, oh God, that we believe that the earnest is going to become fullness. And we rejoice in that today. &gt;&gt; No matter how dark it looks, oh God, there is light that shines forth upon your people. And so we position ourselves before you today, Aba. Again, as participants, hungry for your purposes to be outworked in our lives. I pray again in my life, oh God, in this body that a a a new cleansing will come, &gt;&gt; that your fire will fall, oh God, that we would be vessels prepared for your glory, for your honor, oh God, that we can be used for your purposes. Lord, we speak healing over every body represented. Every name Bobby WZ, &gt;&gt; Lord, you paid the price. Regardless of how it looks in the natural, Father, over every situation, we confess atonement. We confess redemption. We confess healing and deliverance in the name of Yeshua the Messiah. Lord, let it come out of this place today. Let testimonies be heard. Let lives be changed. Lord, we we pray for this meeting in Arizona today. If if anything else, Father, I thank you that Jesus is being exalted, that your name is being made known. And many people have said it, Lord. It was it was Saul that rejoiced in the stoning of Steven &gt;&gt; and he became one of your greatest assets in your purposes in the early church. And we pray that Sauls would be converted into Paul's today as that ears would be open to hear your word and that lives would be changed. Oh God, let it be so. In the name of Yeshua, the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we rejoice in you again, Lord. None of this would be possible without you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Without your love, Lord, that that moved you to come and live and die and shed your blood. And so we thank you today for your goodness. We rejoice in your healing, oh God. We rejoice in your provision. and we lay claim, oh God, to every promise of the inheritance that you've given to us. &gt;&gt; Let it not slip through our fingers, oh God. But may your people today apprehend that which you're offering us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, have your will today. Give us eyes to see and ears to hear. And Lord, may your spirit just feel welcome in this place. &gt;&gt; May you be exalted. May you be lifted high. &gt;&gt; May you rejoice in the praises of your people. &gt;&gt; In the name of Yeshua, the Messiah we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Lord. We praise you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Oh, there is power, power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. There is power, power, wonderworking power in the precious blood of the lamb. Yes, there is power, power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. There is power, power, wonder working power in the precious. Sing one more time. Oh, there is power, power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. There is power, power, wonder working power in the precious blood of the lamb. Yes, in the precious blood of the lamb. Oh, praise to the lamb. We praise you, Lord. [Music] Praise the Lord. You may have your seats today. We are blessed to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're blessed to know what we know. We're blessed to know who we know. &gt;&gt; Because of him, we live and move and have our being. Everything that we are is because of him and his goodness in our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're glad that you're here. Brother Donovan, Sister Audrey, we are so happy to see you today in the house of the Lord. We've been enjoying the blessing of Nikesha and Nia, but to see you today, it's such a blessing. &gt;&gt; So thankful that the Lord gave you strength, Sister Audrey, that you could be here with us today. My sister Doris is here for some time. I don't know how long a time 10, 12, 14 days to help with the children as the birth of the twins are coming close. We're thankful that she is here. We bless her in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're just [Applause] we're glad that God is on the throne, &gt;&gt; that he knows all about us. He knows our needs. He knows our petition. He knows our ups and our downs. &gt;&gt; He knows when to use gentle parenting and he knows when to get out the rod. I was reading in the book of Hosea this morning and I just was was I was amazed to see the Lord saying, you know, I tried being real loving and tried to take the bridal off real gently, &gt;&gt; gentle parenting. But he said that didn't work so well. Had to get a little more aggressive. But I'm glad he knows what I need. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows how to get me where I need to be. &gt;&gt; He knows to what to do so that I can be all that he created me to be. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be one of those, as we have been hearing lately, that has buried my talent under the dirt. &gt;&gt; I want to rise up to accomplish what God has called me to do in this end time hour. And I pray that you are the same way. So, we've come today to to worship the Lord, to hear the word one more time, to let it change us from the inside out. We're letting it change us from glory to glory. He's changing us. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful that he is doing it. &gt;&gt; Brother Cade's going to he's going to sing again today. We're going to worship together as we're preparing uh a little more our hearts to for the hearing of the word. We're going to receive the tithe and offering as he is worshiping and we're worshiping with him. We're going to worship with our voice. We're going to worship with our posture. We're going to worship with our giving to the Lord in tithe and in offering. Brother Austin, would you come? Brother Ellas, will you come? Let you go to the people today to give as giving unto the Lord. Aren't you glad that the Lord provides everything that you have need of? He is good all the time. He is the faithful provider and we bless him for it. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. He is [Music] over the mountains and the sea. Your river runs with love for me. And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And I will daily lift my hand. And I will always sing of when your love came down. [Music] I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. Over [Music] the mountains and the seas, your river runs with love for me. And I will open up my heart and let the evil set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And I will daily lift my hands.

It's not our righteousness. &gt;&gt; All of ours is but filthy rags. &gt;&gt; It's not our holiness. It's his. &gt;&gt; That's why we can be holy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He made us holy. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. &gt;&gt; He's so wonderful and worthy. [Applause] Isn't the Lord good? &gt;&gt; He's so good. &gt;&gt; He's so good. &gt;&gt; He's so good. &gt;&gt; Did you have time to come this morning? Did you have time to be here? Aren't you glad we have an opportunity to be in the house of God? &gt;&gt; Oh, he's wonderful. &gt;&gt; You might want to bump it down now just a tad because it works so much better when I take it off of mute. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; At least I can't get mad at anybody for muting me. I'm muted myself. God is faithful in all of his ways. I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; today. He's wonderful and worthy to be praised. Hallelujah. I feel his presence. &gt;&gt; I know he's here. I know he's up to something, and I want to be a part of it today. I really do. Uh I wanted to mention, I didn't mention earlier, but I wanted to mention, I failed to mention in the prayer request to ask you to please help me pray for brother Adam Knight and his wife, Sister Ida. I had invited brother Adam to come and speak uh at least one night of camp meeting and he is going to be unable to come. Uh he is not well. He has had I don't remember how many surgeries. Do you remember how many Benjamin for for a hernia that he keeps pulling in the pull pit pulling in the pull pit? And uh the doctor finally told him, he said, "It's getting very serious." And and he said, "You you're going to have to stop preaching." And and and well, he just said, "I couldn't never do that. I'd rather be dead than than not be able to preach." And he said, "Well, maybe you could just calm down a little, you know, just hold back a little." He said, "Well, like I said, I'd rather be dead than that, you know." And when he sings, he sings with every I mean, you can feel it coming out of his toes. if any of you were with him with us when we were in North Carolina. He's preached to her a couple times during camp meeting, but it's been a long time. And uh I'm disappointed that he would not be able to come, but also sister Ida's mother is getting very low and may be crossing soon. And they were there uh this week and just lift them up to the Lord. He's a a fellow laborer in the faith and uh has a marvelous balance in all these things that are so important to have a balance in. And so I'd like for you to pray for him. Today is Sister Jennifer Wart's birthday. I don't have any idea that they would be streaming today or maybe they would see this in archive but uh if they did can we just say uh to sister Jennifer how much we love you dear sister and wish you a happy happy birthday and we are all praying for you every day we're praying for brother Bobby and she is a part of him &gt;&gt; I try to call her name before the Lord when I'm praying but even if I didn't she's a part of him so if I'm praying for him. I'm praying for her as well. Uh tomorrow, excuse me, Wednesday is Sister Rona's birthday in South Africa and we want to send her love and happy birthday greetings. Uh they have a desire to be here with us and uh the arrangements have not been coming together. I understand from some of you, they've not been coming together just right yet for for all that's needed. But uh here's how I look about all things like that. We can try to make something happen. And uh if it's God's will, good, you know. Hallelujah. But if it's not his will, I don't want to pull somebody out of the perfect plan of God. &gt;&gt; Did you know something can be God's will but not his timing? &gt;&gt; And and so we want to pray for them. I do believe that sometimes I have been guilty in years past of uh of having such a desire, believing that something was the perfect plan of God and working a little too hard to make it happen and and then not get the same results as you could have gotten if it was the perfect plan. Uh I have people challenge me quite often on perfect and permissive will, but it's in the message. Brother Brandham preached it many times and it's in the scripture and uh it doesn't mean that you won't be successful. It it just simply means you won't have the very full benefit. &gt;&gt; Uh and I want the full if I'm going to labor for the kingdom, I want the full benefit. &gt;&gt; Not just for myself, but for those I minister to. &gt;&gt; And so uh bless them. And if it be God's will, well, we'll see you shortly. That is for sure. Sister Cindy, how many years now? This is is this the second second anniversary wedding anniversary you will have without brother Anthony. So this Thursday and and you know that that's fresh. That's still fresh. And so let's uh uh celebrate the love that they shared together. And uh uh you know the truth is Anthony was an amazing fellow. I know a lot of you didn't didn't know him and I didn't know him as well in the last years but he was an amazing guy. But it wasn't easy. And my mother wasn't easy. And if my mother said somebody wasn't easy, she was an expert. I don't know if she ever called him Brother Anthony. I doubt she ever did. I don't even know she ever called him Anthony unless she was mad. But she always called him rotten. And that was what she called her dog that she loved very much. And so they had a very good relationship and uh he had a dry sense of humor, but it was it was uh plentiful. And I know I know that he got the woman, the lady that God had for him. I'm sure of that because she certainly took very very good care of him. And I know that her heart still breaks. So, we're going to pray for her and uh this week especially and u I know God will bring her through. Uh April has a birthday on Friday. Is that it is right Friday. Let's say happy birthday to sister April. I don't I didn't even look up how many it's just a number, right? What does it matter? Brother Charles Gillard is a streamer, faithful streamer with his parents and I saw that his birthday was Friday and I want to wish him a very happy birthday as well. Uh there's just a lot of things going on that we we just want to be where God wants us to be at the time that he wants us to be there. Would you make sure that I announce that at the end of the service? Would you remind me and and and and uh we'll do it then. Sister Rebecca reached out this morning and she said she'd been listening to Fill My Cup, Lord. And she wanted us to sing it this morning. Let's do that. Um, let's sing that as we get ready again for the word. We just keep getting ready for the word. We've said that more than once, but let's do this because this has been on our If you're able, you can stand. If you don't feel able, you're going to be sitting a while though. Uh fill my cup Lord. I lift it up Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven, come and feed me till I want no more. Fill my cup, fill it up, and make me whole. Sing it just like that again. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. That's why we're here. Oh, we need something. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven. Oh, come and feed us. Feed us till we won't no more. Fill my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Oh, there are millions in this world who are craving. [Music] I believe that the pleasures [Music] earthly things afford. Oh, but none none can match the one treasure [Music] that I find in Jesus Christ my Lord. Sing it to him again. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up. Lord, come. Come and quench, quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread of heaven. Oh mana, come and feed me. Feed me till I won't. I won't no more. Fill my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Let's sing about that little woman before we go to the word. Like the woman at the well, I was seeking for things that could not satisfy. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, but then then I heard my savior speaking. Draw draw from my well. Oh that never shall run dry. Fill my cup, Lord. We just wave our cups before you today. Oh, we lift them up, Lord. Oh, you're so faithful to fill them. Come and quench, quench this thirsting of my soul. Bread, bread of heaven. Come and feed me, feed me till I want, till I want no more. Fill my cup, fill it up, and make me whole. Here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up. Lord Jesus, come as only you can quench this thirsting of my soul. [Music] Bread of heaven. Feed me. Feed me. Feed me till I won't till I want no more. Fill my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. That's what happens when he feeds us. He takes our brokenness and he makes us whole. Why don't you praise him for that right now? I'm sorry. Woo. While you're clapping, clap for these wonderful musicians. My my, how blessed we are. Yes. &gt;&gt; Turn in your Bible this morning to Psalm 98. I want to read verses 1-9. Psalm 98:es 1-9. As the sun goes down tomorrow evening, the chauffear blasts around the world, ushering in the beginning of the fall feast of the Lord. I know that some people refer to them as Jewish feast, but the Bible refers to them as the feast of Yahweh or sometimes we could say the feast of Jehovah. Brother Brandham used the word Jehovah, but he told us more than once that word is incorrect. He knew that it wasn't an accurate translation, but it was the English translation and he spoke English. But we look at his feast knowing they don't exclusively belong to the Jewish people. If they did, the bride would be pretty bored in eternity &gt;&gt; because the scripture tells us that these feasts are going to be memorialized and remembered even in the millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth. Now I tell you, if God feels so strongly about their marking of time that he would let something ordained in time carry over to eternity, there is a message there. &gt;&gt; There's a there is an importance there. There are a couple laws uh quickly I know you're standing but it's only nine verses. There are couple laws that are applied to Bible study or Bible interpretation. There there many but two of the first laws that are applied. Number one is the law of first mentioned. You can learn a lot about a subject by going to where that is first mentioned in the Bible and and if it's in the Old Testament then you will learn a lot by looking at the original language. Brother Brandham used the Daglot. The daglot is more limited than the lexicon, but you can certainly use either one of those tools. That doesn't make you intellectual. It doesn't make you philosophical. It doesn't mean that you like psychology. It simply means you want to understand the meaning of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us so many times, I have no education. And so he said, I can be wrong on these things. and he told us where to go to make sure that what we were getting was was right and was correct. And the other law is looking at how many times something is mentioned in the Bible. Now all the scriptures important &gt;&gt; everything co he said cover to cover to cover. It's important. It's there for a reason. It's not a mistake that we have it. But we learn a lot about a subject by seeing how many times it's mentioned in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And so it's the law of first mention and the law of mention that we start applying when we're looking at any subject in the Bible. And when we look at the feast of the Lord, they go all the way across. Jesus is talking about them. John the Revelator in the book of the Revelation is talking about them. And so there's something to learn about them. Some of them speak directly to the bride even in the last days. And we want to uh take a moment to reflect on that from time to time. The uh I want to read Psalm 98:es 1-9. Oh, sing unto the Lord what? &gt;&gt; A new song. He must not be offended by singing something that is uh written after 65. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he hath done &gt;&gt; marvelous thing. I want you to say it again. Marvelous. &gt;&gt; Marvelous. &gt;&gt; You know, that's a marvelous word. &gt;&gt; We don't use it enough. It's big. It's bigger than big. He's done marvelous things. Can anybody testify that he has done marvelous things &gt;&gt; in your life? Praise God. His right hand, &gt;&gt; which is power and authority, &gt;&gt; and his holy arm &gt;&gt; hath gotten him &gt;&gt; the victory. &gt;&gt; I want you to say, Jesus is the victor. &gt;&gt; He's not the victory. He is the victor. &gt;&gt; Who is the victory? You are. &gt;&gt; Because you are connected to the victor. &gt;&gt; He's the one who won the victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how he got the victory. He became the victor. And you are that victory. You are the lamb's reward. &gt;&gt; You are the seed that he saw prophetically before the foundation of the world. We know that. That's what the scripture tells us. Sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvelous things. His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. I love it. The Lord hath made known his Yeshua. &gt;&gt; That's the word. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath made known his salvation, &gt;&gt; which is the word Yeshua in Hebrew. His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; He delights in showing his majesty and marvelous works even in the face of darkness. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's God's sovereign. &gt;&gt; Somebody say sovereign and supreme. &gt;&gt; He is. &gt;&gt; And he loves to show himself mighty even in the sight of the heathen. Verse three, he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation, the Yeshua of our God. Make a joyful peep, &gt;&gt; a sacred hush, &gt;&gt; whisper. Make a joyful noise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Tua sir. &gt;&gt; Tua. It it's it's the blast of a chauffear. &gt;&gt; It's the blast of a voice. &gt;&gt; In one of the scriptures. In fact, it's this it's in this psalm that the word is used as a noun and as a verb. And one time it's used referring to the to the blast of the hollowed horn uh of a of the ram. Now this didn't come from a ram. I have one maybe in the studio that came from a ram, but it's talking about this. Now it's naturally hollow, but but it gets uh uh it is what it is. It's like fingernails. It's the same kind of uh I I can't remember. Is it keratin or something like that? Am I getting it right? Keratin. Uh the body produces it and for you it makes fingernails. I I'm I'm glad it does. For the for the animal, it makes a horn like this. And by putting a little hole in the end of it, they can blast it. So, one time in in this psalm, it's talking about the sound of this thing and and in the other reference, it's talking about the blast of a voice, the shout, the sound of a human voice. &gt;&gt; And God looks at both the sound of the chauffear and the sound that comes out of his redeemed as the same. It accomplishes the same thing in the earth. &gt;&gt; It pleases the Lord. &gt;&gt; It pleases the Lord. How many of you want to please him? &gt;&gt; I want to please him. &gt;&gt; So, he tells us what pleases him. Make a joyful noise &gt;&gt; unto the Lord. All the earth, &gt;&gt; make a noise. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't need to say anything about it cuz some of you got it down path. and rejoice &gt;&gt; and and do what again? Sing. &gt;&gt; Sing praise. &gt;&gt; Ah, too much singing. Too much singing. &gt;&gt; You better read the Psalms. &gt;&gt; He loves to hear singing. &gt;&gt; He loves to hear you singing. &gt;&gt; And it's not based on whether or not you can carry a tune in a bucket. &gt;&gt; We can all sing in the shower. It's unto the Lord. Amen. Sing praise. Sing praise. Praise God. Sing praise. All right, let's go on. Sing unto the Lord again with a harp. With a harp and the voice of a psalm, &gt;&gt; which is a spiritual song and it can be spontaneous. It can be inspired in the moment with trumpets. Let me show you. Not every time, not every time in the Bible does the word trumpets in English mean this. There are multiple times in the Bible where the word in English is trumpets and it's referring to this. So you won't know which it's referring to. Why do you need to know? Because they mean two different things. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, if you're understanding the fullness of something, you're going to want to know which one it's talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, there's at least one time it's talking about voice, human voice, translated as trumpet. So, you're going to want to know, is that the voice of the bride? &gt;&gt; Is that the the wind, the sound that comes out of a of a trumpet like this, or is it the sound that comes out of a trumpet like this, which is a chauffar? I I am one of those inquiring minds &gt;&gt; and I want to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With trumpets and sound of cornet. Somebody say cornet. &gt;&gt; That is not an a musical instrument uh in the in the band. There is an instrument that they have come to call that. That's not what this is talking about. That word here cornet is chauffar. When we hear the word chauffar, what are we talking about? Are we talking about the silver thing here or we talk about this? We're talking about this. So, this is a cornet &gt;&gt; with trumpets and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise before the Lord the King. &gt;&gt; Why are you doing this? God bless you. You may be seated. May he add blessing to the reading of his word. No need for you to stand just because I have to stand. Why are you doing this? Because I want to show you &gt;&gt; what he's referring to when the psalmist under inspiration is writing these words. So you you may watch this and and you may it may bother you. It may vex you &gt;&gt; if somebody has one of these &gt;&gt; or somebody has one of these. But I want you to know it doesn't vex, perturb, or bother the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "With trumpets and sound of chauffar, make a joyful noise before the Lord the King." &gt;&gt; Now, you know what makes these uh man-made instruments and animalade instruments? Do you know what makes them sound? There's no read in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just a hollow hole. I can't blow it because my teeth are too big. My front teeth are too big. And I can't make that buzz that you have to make to blow a trumpet. Like brother Gley can blow a real trumpet. He has a trumpet. He can blow a real trumpet. It's This is a little harder to blow probably than your trumpet because it has no read, no mouthpiece. This has at least a mouthpiece, but no no read, I don't think. And uh but this won't do anything without what? Breath. &gt;&gt; I I mean, you might hook it up to a uh to an air compressor, &gt;&gt; but I don't think you're going to get the right sound. &gt;&gt; It's not just air. Come on. It's &gt;&gt; not just oxygen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's It's living breath. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what the word what the words mean. Vibrating &gt;&gt; living &gt;&gt; breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh he breathed living breath. Ruach, &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; vibrating breath &gt;&gt; into Adam, Adam. &gt;&gt; And Adam became, which means red earth, by the way, red clay. So Adam was made from from the dirt in uh Eden. And in Eden, there was a garden. And we sometimes call it the garden of Eden. And Adam was made from red dirt. Which means that the dirt in Eden was pretty similar to the dirt in Alabama. &gt;&gt; Red dirt. Adam was made of red dirt. And all he was was a dirt man, a dust man. Until God Almighty, I know you know this, but I can't get past it. God Almighty &gt;&gt; who had no physical form. &gt;&gt; He was only representing himself at that time uh as as something like light, a fountain of light, &gt;&gt; truth, holiness, you know, love projected &gt;&gt; but not in the physical body of a man. God Almighty, the eternal spirit of the father came down mouthto mouth. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And breathed breath into the nostrils of Adam, &gt;&gt; spirit breath, &gt;&gt; vibrating breath, living breath, not air compressor breath. &gt;&gt; That's air. What you put in your tire is not breath. &gt;&gt; It's air. &gt;&gt; There, don't get confused. It's not air that made you a living soul. It's not air that connected your spirit man with your flesh body and therefore connected you to your environment. No, no, no. It was vibrating breath &gt;&gt; of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he and remember what Jesus what we learned about Jesus in the New Testament. And Jesus breathed on them &gt;&gt; and said, &gt;&gt; "Receive ye &gt;&gt; the ruach hakodesh. The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Receive the Holy Ghost, but the Holy Ghost had not yet been given. It was not yet the day of Pentecost." &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus had in him breath. &gt;&gt; There you go. He breathed on them &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not a separate person. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was breath, spirit, life that was inside of son. S O N &gt;&gt; because he had the ability to then impart the Holy Ghost with his breath. Just like he breathed on Adam, just like he breathed on 120. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He came in the form of a of pillars of fire and a mighty rushing ruach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A mighty rushing wind. But it wasn't air only. &gt;&gt; The wind that blew on the day of Pentecost. Oh my. I don't know why this simple simple uh message is is exciting me so the wind that blew at Pentecost wasn't just air. &gt;&gt; It was something more. It was spirit life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the same breath that God breathed into Adam &gt;&gt; and that Jesus breathed into those who he was ministering to in that moment. breathed on them and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you criticize. &gt;&gt; I I mean really we we shouldn't criticize because that's how that life was released. Now it takes more than air to make this thing work and it takes more than air to make this instrument work. It takes breath. Living vibrating breath, not air. breath. &gt;&gt; That's what makes this sound. That's what makes this sound. And that's what makes you sound. &gt;&gt; Because you and I are instruments unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we don't have much to say in the last day. We really don't have much to say of our own accord. &gt;&gt; We really desire to know the mind of the spirit. Uh the prophet told us that in those last days the bride would have &gt;&gt; thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now I don't think thus sayaith the Lord should be a punctuation on every interpretation of tongues or on every inspired gifted exhortation. You can if you know it. If you know that you know that you know that you know. But once you roll something off of you and you roll it entirely on the Lord, it better be. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It better be. Thus sayeth the Lord. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you're taking it out. You're saying, I have no influence in this. This is not me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is not my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Say with me a minute. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; This isn't what I think or what I know about the situation. He's just using my voice. So when you say thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; you if you're punctuating, Brother Brandham warns us and be careful about using that. Don't don't throw that around like it's an amen &gt;&gt; or a filler in some kind of word from, you know, exhortation or something. But if you say it, let it be &gt;&gt; punctuation &gt;&gt; in the sense that you're saying this is not of me. I know that he has come and took charge &gt;&gt; and the inspiration comes. This is thus sayith the Lord. He said in that last day the bride will have thus sayaith the Lord or she will do what? &gt;&gt; She'll keep still. &gt;&gt; She has nothing to say and nothing to do. Jesus had nothing to say and nothing to do. He said except it be shown of me &gt;&gt; of the eternal spirit of my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the prophet taught us that he moved by vision. &gt;&gt; Jesus ministered many times by vision. &gt;&gt; Not just by sunship or by being the word manifest. &gt;&gt; He moved many times in ministry by vision. &gt;&gt; And you and I have been called to carry on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in the earth. Is that right? Yes. &gt;&gt; That doesn't make you Jesus. &gt;&gt; It makes you Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm good with that. &gt;&gt; Anybody follow? &gt;&gt; I'm good with that. &gt;&gt; Married to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Married to him. &gt;&gt; And without some uncction, she's going to say little and do little. But when that uncction comes and she knows who's she is and who it is that has taken control, he will be able to speak through her. He said as the final voice of God to the agemen, &gt;&gt; the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; She won't be hot air. &gt;&gt; She won't just be a bunch of hot air. She's got to have the breath, the vibrating life, the breath, the spirit breath, the spirit life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In New Testament numa in in Old Testament ruach, it's more than wind, more than air. It's vibrating living substance because it's spirit breath, spirit life. Did you know you can get around somebody who's been drinking on that? &gt;&gt; And you feel lively? &gt;&gt; Have you ever been charged by being around somebody who's been charged? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The atmosphere changes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're sitting in a room with hundreds of Baptist people last night and most of them old, precious people. Quite a few of them had blue hair. I'm trying to figure out where that comes along. Blue hair. Uh all kinds of uh you know dudes. They're done up. These old people are so done up. I think Lord, they must have started at 9:00 this morning to be that fixed up to get here tonight. Every now and then, you know, you hear a little little something. I cannot help myself. I don't want to embarrass myself. I don't want to embarrass my family. But but I can't help it. I just can't help myself. When I get blessed, I'm blessed. &gt;&gt; And so you go out and everybody in there's nodding. Pentecostal, aren't you? You're Pentecostal, aren't you? You go Pentecost. &gt;&gt; They didn't act like they hated it. They ought to have been thanking us. &gt;&gt; The singers thanked us. &gt;&gt; Because they appreciate. You've got some pull. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're full of the vibrating life, the breath of almighty God, the spirit of life, if you've got him in you, you've got some pull &gt;&gt; on the anointing &gt;&gt; for the musician, &gt;&gt; for the singer, &gt;&gt; for the worshipper, for the preacher, &gt;&gt; and you ought to use it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to use it with trumpets and sound of coronet. make a joyful again noise &gt;&gt; before the Lord &gt;&gt; the melik the king he's melik haha holam the king of the whole universe &gt;&gt; amen let the sea roar &gt;&gt; and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein let them roar &gt;&gt; don't only let the sea roar but let let those who dwell in the land roar Why? Because it's not your oxygen. It's not your carbon dioxide. It's not your whatever, however all that work. It's not your air. &gt;&gt; When you when you roar your praises unto God, you're releasing something. Oh, I've seen it. &gt;&gt; You're releasing something like Jesus was when he breathed on them. Get under the word. Get under the word. Get under the word. Get under the word as much as you can as often as you can. And when you can hear it in the prophet's voice, do it. &gt;&gt; It's a special blessing &gt;&gt; to hear it. It's a special blessing to hear it because you know that you're not hearing somebody's education. &gt;&gt; You're hearing something divine, &gt;&gt; something from the Lord. Hear it. Let the floods clap their hands. &gt;&gt; Let the hills The hills be joyful &gt;&gt; together before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth. Can you imagine that all creation is praising him, clapping its hands, roaring unto him because he's coming to judge the earth. &gt;&gt; That's that's because creation knows who she is. She knows she knows she's there to serve his pleasure. She's not worried about judgment. &gt;&gt; She knows why she exists. Creation exists to the pleasure. For the pleasure of the creator &gt;&gt; of the Lord. He said, "For he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness &gt;&gt; shall he judge the world and the people with &gt;&gt; with equity, with justice, with a righteous balance." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With justice. &gt;&gt; With justice. You don't. It's a very similar word in the original language. Judgment and justice. &gt;&gt; Judgment has more of a negative connotation often because we feel like it means that that a sentence is going to be uh handed out. But if you look at the book of Daniel, it's okay for a sentence to be handed out &gt;&gt; because he's going to issue a judgment. Daniel said &gt;&gt; it's a just and and and it is equity. It's justice and equity. But he's going to issue a judgment on behalf. &gt;&gt; I got it, but I'll never get to it. &gt;&gt; Of the saints. &gt;&gt; I'm going to render a righteous judgment on behalf of the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he's done that for you more than once. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When all hell had charged you &gt;&gt; and had placed you and I both before the courtroom of the king &gt;&gt; rightfully so. &gt;&gt; Not wrongfully charged, rightfully charged. Guilty of everything the devil said. &gt;&gt; You did. Yeah. Yeah, I did. You You did. Yeah, I did. I did. I did. And I want you to know in that moment it could have been death. In that moment, it could have been destruction. &gt;&gt; In that moment, it could have been uh leaving you as a pile of dust, but he rendered on your behalf a righteous judgment. He could do that because you were covered by the blood &gt;&gt; of an innocent lamb. &gt;&gt; You weren't just saved. Is anybody hear me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You weren't just saved. &gt;&gt; You were redeemed. [Applause] And because of your redemption, it covered what you had done &gt;&gt; it covered what you were doing &gt;&gt; when you got called up to the court &gt;&gt; and it covered anything that you might ever do &gt;&gt; as an infraction &gt;&gt; of his righteous instruction. &gt;&gt; You see, redemption doesn't just cover us from the behind. It covers us all around. &gt;&gt; It's the present. It's the past. It's the future. &gt;&gt; God has a way of bringing us back to his original thoughts about us in the beginning. How can he do it? Because of grace. Because of the blood. &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to dress you &gt;&gt; in my righteousness." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Zachchariah was caught up into the heavenly realms in Zechariah chapter 3 and he saw Joshua, Yahushua, the the high priest clothed in filthy garments, the the residue and the remnants of the captivity in Babylon. &gt;&gt; He was a high priest. He was ordained of God. He had done what he was called to do. But his robe and his turban had become stained by the residue and the remnant of the captivity. &gt;&gt; You were captive. &gt;&gt; I was captive. &gt;&gt; We come way over here and sometimes we find out that we're still stay right here, please. We're carrying some kind of remnant, some kind of piggyback &gt;&gt; like a cockleber or something gets on us and we carry it around &gt;&gt; and and we've got to be made clean. &gt;&gt; And there was no condemnation from him who sat on the throne. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Get that filthy man out of my sight." &gt;&gt; He said, "Come &gt;&gt; and change his clothes." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody bring him a festal robe. The word there is festal robe. It means the royal apparel. Bring him the royal apparel. &gt;&gt; The the the the dress of feast. &gt;&gt; Festival. That's what it means. &gt;&gt; What you would wear to a banquet, &gt;&gt; to a feast. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Bring him those festal robes and clothe him and get him a fair miter. a clean turban for his head. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because the holiness is smudged. &gt;&gt; It covers it comes with a band. Holiness &gt;&gt; unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; His holiness has been smudged by the residue of Babylonian captivity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. Give him a new one. &gt;&gt; Put hole in his back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In that uh in that um what do we call the armor? God's armor. Uh ar uh help me. In the New Testament, the armor of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh the feet are I'm not saying it just right, am I? &gt;&gt; Say it again. Yeah, I know. What What do you Is it What do we call The whole armor of God. I'm sorry. I needed it. King James. Whole armor of God. I couldn't I couldn't I armored in armor of God. Armor of God. Whole whol armor of God. Complete &gt;&gt; armor of God. Head to toe. &gt;&gt; Feet shaw with the preparation of peace. &gt;&gt; Come on. Dressed up all the way down. Don't don't mind the fact that it's patterned after the Roman armor and and not the armor of the Hebrews. Don't don't worry about that. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It's our armor. God gave it to us and we ought to wear it. &gt;&gt; According to the Old Testament, somebody said, "Notice though in the New Testament, there's nothing for your back." Well, that there's I tell you what we'll say about that. We'll say, "Then you better not turn your back to the devil." But if you ever do, &gt;&gt; the Old Testament has you covered &gt;&gt; because he said, "The glory &gt;&gt; of the Lord, &gt;&gt; the cavode of the Lord shall be your rear word." &gt;&gt; Your rear word. &gt;&gt; And no, that word is not re-reward. &gt;&gt; It's rearward. &gt;&gt; It means bringing up from behind. The glory of the Lord will cover you. the breastplate of righteousness, sword of the spirit. Woo! &gt;&gt; Amen. Helmet of salvation. &gt;&gt; But here the Lord said, uh, the word, him who sat as judge said, now put that fair miter on his head. And we know what that was. Holiness unto the Lord. You, you get a little smudged &gt;&gt; because you're you get a little residue of what you've been through. &gt;&gt; Been through some stuff. If anybody's been through some stuff, hold up your hand. &gt;&gt; Anybody been through some stuff? &gt;&gt; Anybody been through some stuff this week? &gt;&gt; I guess the rest of you are comeos. No wonder we didn't see you nowhere. You were hibernated somewhere like a bear. If you got out, you don't have to get out. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Stuff will find you. You can't hide from from swirl, I call it. &gt;&gt; You can't hide from swirl. &gt;&gt; There's always something swirling in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're bi- dimensional. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You are bi- dimensional. You're triune as a man, but you're bi- dimensional. You're living in two realms at one time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're living in a spirit realm, a heavenly realm, an an atmosphere of eternity realm, &gt;&gt; and you're living in an earthly natural flesh realm. &gt;&gt; And and uh if you have a if you have an office uh uh uh in the five-fold ministry, then even that can be magnified. So if you think it's difficult as just maybe a believer and and I don't when I say just I don't mean that it's measured and one's higher than the other. But but I mean as a believer you you learn a little about what that means to live in two dimensions at one time spiritually. &gt;&gt; Now we know that according to the law of physics we're living in three dimensions at one time. But we add something when we're looking at the spirit. We're bi- dimensional, meaning of this earth and earthy as Adam was both earthy &gt;&gt; and otherworldly. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By the spirit. Amen. You are too. &gt;&gt; Adam would have never had a soul. &gt;&gt; He would have never had a soul had not spirit connected with earth. &gt;&gt; When earth connects with spirit, spirit connects with earth. It takes a soul in the middle &gt;&gt; to connect you &gt;&gt; because your your your your your body, your flesh body and your spirit man is going to be in conflict all the time. And that's why God puts in the middle there the senses. That's to connect the outward atmosphere through the flesh. But he puts those senses of the inner man. &gt;&gt; Mine my car. Brother Green used to say memories, imaginations, conscience, affections, reasonings, those are part of the middle earth, the middle part of a man. And that's how your spirit can connect your flesh. Your flesh can connect to your spirit. We might say emotionally, you'd be miserable. You'd be miserable to live half in heaven and half in earth &gt;&gt; if something didn't help you navigate in that middle ground. I may that may not be of interest to anybody else but it has many many many times balanced me out &gt;&gt; when I cried like a little girl and I couldn't control my tears and I didn't know why. I didn't understand it and it was that inner it was that inner balance. It's God is a gift. It's it's to be sanctified and controlled by Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But it's a gift to you. If you didn't have that realm of emotion, if you didn't have that realm uh of of memory, imagination, conscious affections, and reasonings, if you didn't have that realm, you'd be more miserable than you already are trying to navigate this god life in a godless society. &gt;&gt; But you've got to have you've got to have exercise authority over though. You've got to exercise authority over your imagination. You've got to exercise authority over your conscience. You've got to Somebody said, "I thought the conscience was there to guide." The problem is the enemy wants to sear that thing with a hot iron. &gt;&gt; So, you can't trust a conscience that's been seared. &gt;&gt; You've got to let the spirit of God bring life back to that awakening awakening that part of who you are so that you have a moral compass &gt;&gt; because even though everybody else is doing it, hand though, hand join in hand, the wicked will not go unpunished. &gt;&gt; You can't follow the crowd. If you follow the crowd, you'll follow them right to eternal separation from God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; You've got to follow the word if it feels good. If it don't feel good, &gt;&gt; if you like it, if you don't like it, you got to follow the word. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I'm a Methodist." I don't care what you are. You've got to follow the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's here for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the flood before the Lord. Oh, there's so much. Just just Psalm 98:6 in the complete Jewish Bible. Uh I like the way it work because it gives us the word chauffar there. It says with trumpets and the sound of the chauffear. I didn't know what a cornet was, but I knew what a chauffar was. With trumpets and the sound of the chauffar, shout for joy before the king. Adoni, Lord. &gt;&gt; Adoni. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord. Lord. Have you ever thought about what that means to call him Adoni? To call him Lord. It's like it's like the declaration after the resurrection. Raboni. She said, "Raboni, Master, Lord." Daddy Rambo wrote the song. But the angels called him Jesus, born of a virgin. Mary called him Jesus, but I call him Lord, Master Adonai. The church has emphasized the friendship of God and we need to know that we are joints with Christ and we are friends with him. He said so &gt;&gt; he loves us in that in that brotherly affection sort of fraternal affection sort of way as well. &gt;&gt; But he's more than a friend. &gt;&gt; That stickketh closer than a brother. &gt;&gt; He's more than that. He's lord. He's master. &gt;&gt; He's boss man. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? He's boss man and lover. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Boss man and lover &gt;&gt; at the same time. He who my soul longeth after. &gt;&gt; The psalmist said, "As the h a r t as the little deer panteth." &gt;&gt; Running through the w excuse me, I'll get it in a minute. Running through the woods, &gt;&gt; out of breath. You see a dog in the summertime not even running and that tongue hanging out and it's panty, you think it's dying. No, it's living. &gt;&gt; That's a sign that its body is adapting &gt;&gt; to what's going on. &gt;&gt; It's a sign that it needs to cool off. Come on. &gt;&gt; And that little deer's been running through the woods and he comes down and he sees that beautiful cool spring. &gt;&gt; That little cool creek fed by an artisian spring that never runs out. &gt;&gt; It's got something on the inside. Brother Ram said just pushing. &gt;&gt; You ever had one? You ever been to one? I've told you before, I've been to an artisian spring down between Phoenix City and Eupfalla. I'd like to know if it's still there. A pipe coming out of the hill and people standing there when I was a boy with 150 uh empty milk jugs to put them under that that pipe that someone had put in there to catch that artisian water. Oh my. It's probably because I'm 57 years old and it's been 40 something years since I had a drink. It It's probably making it sweeter and more wonderful than it really was. &gt;&gt; Absence can make the heart grow fonder and it can make the hyperbole grow larger. But if I remember right, it was the best water I'd ever tasted in my life. It it didn't have time to get filled up with sediment. It didn't get time to get filled up with anything but natural minerals because it was always running. &gt;&gt; I tell you, you've got a well. You get the Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost. You better get the Holy Ghost because when you get the Holy Ghost inside of you, he is an artisian well. &gt;&gt; He never stops giving out. He just pumping pumping pumping pumping out. And it's not air. And it's not oxygen. &gt;&gt; It's vibrating &gt;&gt; breath, &gt;&gt; vibrating life &gt;&gt; that come from the original life, &gt;&gt; the creator. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me just tell this story. This is not in the note. &gt;&gt; But uh little deer, brother Bram said, you see a little deer come down and drink. Little bird play around in the shallow waters peeping around. You've seen them bathing. Have you ever I told you I'm old cuz now I watch the thing. I watch nature which we never had time for when we were young. Now we make time. I'm late for the offering. I don't have a time to get here. And when I'm late, I usually stay late to make up for it as though I have an invisible clock to clock in. But I'm sometime I'm sometimes a little later getting over here because I'm standing in the bay window watching the deer. or watching the bird or watching something. Brother Brandham liked to do it. He was not not old but getting that way. He said and he he said, "I wonder if that spring could talk. I wonder what what would is always bubbling." He said just happy happy just bubbling. I wonder what it would say. &gt;&gt; If it could talk said if I could ask it, why are you so happy you little spring, you little little creek? Why? Why are you so happy bubbling all the time? Is it because the deer come and find a cool refreshment and satisfaction in your water? Said if that little spring could talk, it'd say, "No, that's not what it is." Is it because the little birds come and splash around? You know, they get water on their feathers and shake it off and the oil of their feathers sheds that water and they feel clean. Did you know a bird will take a dirt bath sometimes? Certain birds will take a dirt bath and they feel cleaner once they do that than they did before because of that natural oil that's on their on their feathers. You see, is it because the little birds are are, you know, flopping around in your little shallow water there? Is that if if you is that what makes you happy? Oh, no. He said that wouldn't be what it was. Then if that little spring could talk, he said we What is it? He He said, "Well, there if it could talk, he'd say there's something down on the inside of me that I it just keeps bubbling out. It just keeps coming out. And that's where &gt;&gt; that's where my joy comes from. And that's where my life comes from, my peace comes from that. My get up and go. My press on &gt;&gt; the zeal of the Lord. It comes from something on the inside. &gt;&gt; It's not a pull from without. &gt;&gt; It's a pull from within. &gt;&gt; Oh, the vibrating life. You will know you. Somebody say, "I don't like that word vibration." I I think the new age uses that word. I don't care. I don't care what words they hijack &gt;&gt; and use &gt;&gt; just like these religious purists who who don't want a musical instrument in a church because it wasn't mentioned in the New Testament. So, uh I didn't read anywhere where grace kicked out the guitar. The Old Testament's full of these instruments. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, the emphasis is not on this instrument. It's on this instrument. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that we don't use this instrument because as we said a moment ago, that doesn't do. You can I don't care what the guitar I don't care what brand it is. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's the Ched Atkins model. &gt;&gt; Do you know who that is, Josh? Uh, it can't do nothing &gt;&gt; over there in the corner on the stand. &gt;&gt; If somebody don't pick it up and use it &gt;&gt; and somebody might pick it up and use it to glorify drunk. &gt;&gt; Riotus, debauchery living. &gt;&gt; And then you'd say that's an instrument of the devil. The &gt;&gt; devil's using that whooping people up into their drunken frenzy, getting them all excited. But if a man of God goes over there and picks up that guitar and begins to play under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, sir, &gt;&gt; then that's not an instrument of the devil anymore. &gt;&gt; Because an instrument of God has picked up an instrument &gt;&gt; and is using that unto the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want no drums in my church. Then you ought to be somewhere else &gt;&gt; cuz you'll never get them out of here. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're going to concrete them to the ground. &gt;&gt; And the reason why is because people can't clap. &gt;&gt; They can't keep the re the rhythm, the beat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so you have something to set them. Just like brother Bam said, you won't have revival. Well, I said they get him a drum &gt;&gt; and beat on it. He's talking about the Salvation Army &gt;&gt; down on the street corner. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Draw drawing the attention of the people &gt;&gt; for the word to go forth. &gt;&gt; You don't take these kinds of things and say just exclusively there of the enemy because Elvis Presley had it or because some other uh you know uh Lucy liked candy bars. But that don't mean that candy bars are wrong because Lucy Lucille s what do you call Susie? He liked to call her Susie. Her name was Lucy. He liked to call her Susie because she liked chocolate bars. And and and and he didn't particularly care for what kind of thing she was advertising and portraying in the world. Thank God he can't see. Thank God I pray he doesn't know what they pump on that crazy television in these days. Right. &gt;&gt; A man smacking a man on the lips. [Music] &gt;&gt; I bet I Love Lucy and her pedal pushers doesn't look so bad now. &gt;&gt; When you see how those things just keep &gt;&gt; magnifying and magnifying and magnifying, but because she liked the candy bar doesn't mean all candy bars are of the devil. I'm here to tell you that all candy bars are not of the devil. &gt;&gt; You've got to have a balancing thing. Use what you have to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Use your clap hands if you don't even if you don't clap on time. Just clap a little softer if you don't know how to keep the rhythm &gt;&gt; so you don't throw somebody else off. But clap clap clap. Use what you got &gt;&gt; to glorify the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so so then in uh Psalm 89:15, let's go there quickly. I got to hurry. It's 105. Blessed is the people. Blessed is I didn't know Sister Annie was here. I didn't see you, Sister Annie, till I heard you. You've got a very distinct very distinct. God bless you for your I like it. Blessed is the people that know &gt;&gt; the joyful sound. &gt;&gt; Terua. Somebody say terua. &gt;&gt; It's the feast of trumpets. Terua. The word sound here joyful sound. Sound is terua. And here's what it means. Shout, blast, alarm of war. Alarm, war cry. &gt;&gt; I wonder if pacifists in the natural will make very good warriors in the spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure. But I pray so because we're in an hour now &gt;&gt; where it wouldn't pay to be passive &gt;&gt; in the spirit &gt;&gt; because hell is marching hounds of hell and onslaught of darkness, &gt;&gt; wicked. That's it. constantly, constantly howling, constantly barking, constantly waring against the saints. &gt;&gt; 10 thousands of ten thousands of demon spirits lid, ripped off, loosed, not on the institutional church, &gt;&gt; the bride. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; But that you got to be here if they're loosed on you. So it has to be before rapture &gt;&gt; if you're going to apply that understanding that brother Brandham had. Then no wonder you fight &gt;&gt; because those spirits are honed in &gt;&gt; on you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They can't change who you are. They can't change your election. They can't change your prefix destiny. They But what they'll do is they will harass you &gt;&gt; until they cause you to let go of the very thing &gt;&gt; that gives you life. &gt;&gt; Don't let go. &gt;&gt; Don't let go. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't let go. Abide in the vine. &gt;&gt; Don't let go of the vine. The vine is the life support. &gt;&gt; The vine is the life source. Don't let go of the vine. No matter what the enemy says. You can get mad at the preacher, but don't get mad at the vine. Don't get mad at Jesus. Don't get mad at the word. &gt;&gt; That's life to us. &gt;&gt; That's all the enemy can do. He'll lie. He'll bring you to court. He'll make you think you're going to have to face it all on your own. &gt;&gt; And then you then you, you know, then you start thinking of the song. Then mercy walks in. Sure enough, &gt;&gt; it's real. That that song is is certainly allegory in some sense of the word and in other senses of the word, it's extremely real &gt;&gt; because the accuser does stand in the courtroom &gt;&gt; accusing you and and oh, where is your God now? &gt;&gt; Where is your Jesus now? And you're this and you're that and you did and you did and you did that and you did the other and you said that and you said the other and there you stand defenseless with no one to plead your case and the door swings open &gt;&gt; and mercy walks in &gt;&gt; and pleads your case and the and the accuser is silenced. He has nothing else to say. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you better let go of some &gt;&gt; terua. Glorisraise. &gt;&gt; You better let go of some terua &gt;&gt; blast, &gt;&gt; noise, shout, battle cry, cry of joy. &gt;&gt; It it is part the the root of terua is rua. And does ruach sound like anything to you? It's ruach. &gt;&gt; It's the same root as ruach. And what is ruach? Breath. Spirit. &gt;&gt; So terua is a blast, a shout, a release. &gt;&gt; Something on the inside &gt;&gt; that can't hold back. Sometimes it's just got to shout. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just got to scream hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And every time you do from the sincerity of your spirit man, you're releasing Can I tell you that it's the same kind of of demonstration as a prophetic utterance? Because a prophetic utterance is a naba which is a bubbling up of inspiration &gt;&gt; of spirit strength and it's bubbling up and the word uh uh is naba. It's a kind of release uh from a prophet. It's a prophetic release and it comes like a bubble and it comes like life and spirit and it's intricately connected to terua because it's intricately connected to rua. Somebody said all this ruaha I get so confused. That's why it's up there. Somebody said, "Well, I didn't hear brother Random talking anything like that." He talked all around it &gt;&gt; and everything he said about it blessed me. &gt;&gt; But as I said a moment ago, my mind is a little more inquiring than that. &gt;&gt; I want to know. Is it a trumpet? Is it a voice? Is it a chauffear? I want to know because I may want to do it right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I know anything about the order of God and the government of God, I'll know this. There's a time for me to let my my terua be my own voice. &gt;&gt; And there's a time to let it be another sound. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did you know science, brain science has proven to us in this day, proven to us as though we didn't know? It has proven to us, as though we didn't know, that every cell in your body responds to the sound of your voice. &gt;&gt; That's why it's so powerful for you, you &gt;&gt; to confess the word of God over your body, over your life, over your situation. Well, I'd feel silly to stand in the middle of the floor and quote scripture. I don't know why. &gt;&gt; It's sweeter. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The instructions of the Lord, the word of the Lord is sweeter than honey &gt;&gt; in the honeycomb. &gt;&gt; More valuable than silver, more desired than gold. So why would it bother you to stand in the middle of the floor and let honey roll out of your mouth? Let silver come flowing out. Let gold come flowing out of your mouth. I can confess it over you and it will have it will have a marginal effect because I may be for you the voice uh that has been chosen as a pastor to you &gt;&gt; and therefore spiritually God would certainly let that voice have some effect on you that that would be the purpose of you getting a revelation of who your pastor is &gt;&gt; there there there's surely some effectiveness in that I would I would think &gt;&gt; but it couldn't possibly be as effective. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; As you declaring, read it. So, I don't know how to I don't know how to declare. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to I don't know how to decree. &gt;&gt; Do you know how to read? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to read, somebody ought to help you. Stand in the middle of the floor. Close the door. Don't tell nobody what you're doing. If you don't want to, nobody care. Get right there. Open up that book and just start speaking that word over your life, over your family. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I I just don't know if Oh, it will." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Can you show me that in the message?" I believe I can. &gt;&gt; Just go your way. Declaring, "You're healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed." And he did. And one day, he believed what he said. &gt;&gt; Am I supposed to say it even though I don't believe it? Absolutely. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Because the more you say it, &gt;&gt; the more opportunity it has to connect &gt;&gt; with the inside of the inside &gt;&gt; of who you are. And you might be like that little blind man &gt;&gt; that one day he believed it &gt;&gt; when he was sitting in the barber chair of the Church of Christ man who believed miracles were over &gt;&gt; and he's testifying to him. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't look healed to me. Look just as blind as you ever looked. He said, "Well, I'm healed. I'm healed. I am healed. Here ye." Stand on the street corner of that morning. Hear ye. Hear ye. He sells newspapers. Hear ye. Hear ye. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Bold, &gt;&gt; daring. &gt;&gt; Get in the devil's face and scream it. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I know what the word has prophesied about me. &gt;&gt; And sitting in the chair, he believes it. I'm healed. It was always a reality, &gt;&gt; but it became a reality to him. &gt;&gt; They used to have this little slogan around the message. I heard brother Billy Paul, God rest his soul. Uh what a wonderful spirit he had. Uh I heard him say, you know, things like that. Uh God thought it. Brother Brandham spoke it. I believe it. That settles it. That was his revelation and that's a wonderful thing. Nothing wrong with that. But there is a higher reality. &gt;&gt; He didn't argue with me when I suggested it to him either. &gt;&gt; I said that that's your personal reality, brother Billy Paul. But there's a higher reality &gt;&gt; because we don't ever want anybody to think that somebody has to believe it in order for it to be so in general. It's so whether you believe it or not. &gt;&gt; It just won't be so for you. &gt;&gt; But the word of God is so because God said it. &gt;&gt; So we could say God settle God said it. &gt;&gt; That settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I want it to operate in me, I better believe it. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "My word is forever settled [Applause] &gt;&gt; in the heavens. &gt;&gt; It is as secure and as old and as settled as the foundations of the earth &gt;&gt; because the heavens existed before the earth existed. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we could say that that realm was older. It was in eternity. Therefore, there is technically nothing older. But but we understand that it was forever settled &gt;&gt; in the above. &gt;&gt; Terua, blessed is the people that know the joyful teroa. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow sundown is yam tera. The modern Jews, the modern Jewish movement call it Rosh Hashana. This is a throwback to Babylonian captivity. We call it that often. It means head of the year. Rosh is head. Head of the year, the beginning of the year. The thing about it is in in the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, there are more than one new years. There's a spiritual new year, an agricultural new year, a new year for the trees. There are multiple concepts of new years because God was already always having to give his people. There's a reason why he was always having to give his people a new beginning. Why do you think God was always having to give his people a new beginning? cuz they were always messing it up. &gt;&gt; Why do you think God has to give you one? &gt;&gt; Because you're always I'm always messing it up. And so this this is nothing to build a big doctrine on all these different new years. But because the agricultural year is divided in half in in the concept of the Hebrew Bible which is your Old Testament now translated for you in English. The agricultural year is divided into two two units two six-month roughly two six-month periods. And because of that, people get a little confused because we know that the feast of unleavened bread and Passover, the spring feast open up also a new year, a spiritual new year. But this time going into the fall feast, it also represents a sense of new year. the the modern modern Judaism has called it another name and they trace that all the way back to Babylonian captivity. And the if you ever notice that the Hebrew names of the months now are different than the Hebrew names of the months in the Bible. Why do you think that is? It's the same kind of influence from the years of captivity that they spent in Babylon. You can't say anything because your days of the month, my days of the month, and my days of the week, they also come from fables and paganism. &gt;&gt; And they also every time we say them, we are pronouncing the concept of false gods. But it would be very difficult not to live with some kind of sense of time if you're living in the realm of time. So we take what we have to take. I don't think the emphasis at this time of year as we learn more. I don't think it needs to be on the head of the year. I think the emphasis needs to be on the on the blasting of the chauffar. Well, somebody said, I think because we've got grace in the New Testament, it doesn't need to be emphasized at all. Well, there's a portion of this that will have fulfillment in your lifetime. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; so you might ought at least be slightly familiar. &gt;&gt; You you're you're not going to go back and perform some kind. In fact, there are no there really are no uh restrictions, rules concerning Yamua, the feast of trumpets. There's very little about it. Some of the feasts are told uh uh that it in bibl in Bible that it represents one thing, two things, three things. But all we're told about the feast of trumpets is that it is to be a Sabbath. It is to be a day of rest. It is to be a day of reflection, a day of prayer, a day of praise. There's nothing else said. In fact, it has sometimes been referred to as the feast of the unknown. Somebody said, "Well, you know what? What's using God making a feast if it's going to be the feast of the unknown?" Because there's something there's something yet unknown. &gt;&gt; It represents something unknown. &gt;&gt; It represents something unknown. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Did I say that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It represents something that is yet unknown. Jesus said, "No man, &gt;&gt; no man, no woman, no little man, no little woman &gt;&gt; knoweth the day, &gt;&gt; nor the hour, &gt;&gt; feast of the unknown directly connects the rapture of the bride, the resurrection of the bride is directly connected in the fall feast to the feast of Yum Towa, &gt;&gt; the feast of trumpet, chauffar. It's not a It's not a silver trumpet. It's not a brass trumpet. It's talking about a chauffear. It's important to know that it is the chauffear that is connected to the rapture, &gt;&gt; to the resurrection &gt;&gt; of the bride. There's so many things, but my time is gone. There are so many things that we still have never gotten it all in. One of the things that is so profound to me and and a blessing to me is the same horn that is used to make uh rua, a blast, a sound, a tone, a vibration. The same horn was used with a stopper on the end and a cap on the end to fill with anointing oil. &gt;&gt; And every time a new king was anointed, &gt;&gt; even a new priest &gt;&gt; anointed to serve in the holy places, the cap off. Benjamin, do you look in the studio there and and see if my ram my ram chauffar is there? So the people could see a little bit more what it look. It's a little short. You see it? Don't know why we're going through this. Oh well, cuz you didn't go to church this morning. You came here. This is a real one. This is a real one. This is a ram's horn. See it? see how it would sit. I'm not going. This is kind of but I want you to see how it's shaped. It's shaped like that. It's a real one. This is the kind This is the kind that would be blown mo most likely one like this. And this is a kind that would be used for the oil stopper cap and poured right on the head. I've done it. I've anointed people that way. You got to be willing to get greasy, &gt;&gt; oily, and you got to be willing to keep your eyes closed. It means something. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if the Bible said it did." &gt;&gt; How beautiful. &gt;&gt; How beautiful. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; How beautiful. How pleasant it is. for brothers, for brethren to dwell together in unity, &gt;&gt; in union, &gt;&gt; in connection. &gt;&gt; And covenant is what connects us. &gt;&gt; It's not just who we are, it's what we believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That connects us. That's why we have covenant connection with people all over the world, the farthest reaches of New Zealand, even into Russia, all across Europe, the darkest places in Africa. There are people who embrace and believe what you embrace and believe. It makes us covenant brothers and sisters. And this represents covenant unity. We are one in the word. &gt;&gt; We're one in our calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. In our election. And we're one by the spirit. &gt;&gt; And the oil represents what? Spirit. &gt;&gt; It is beautiful for brethren to dwell together in unity. It is like the holy oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like the oil that flowed down. &gt;&gt; Hear this. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; There is great truth in the flowing down. &gt;&gt; Every good and perfect gift. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Comes down. &gt;&gt; It comes from above. &gt;&gt; You didn't do it. You're not smart enough to do it. I'm not smart enough to do it. Anything good God has given me, he give it to me. &gt;&gt; And it come down from the father of lights, from the one who dwells above. And it and that's how the oil falls on us. &gt;&gt; When we were anointed, when we're anointed, we're talking spiritual now. &gt;&gt; He said it runs down. Look out. I don't want to offend the Greeks. It runs down Aaron's beard. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we don't know who did and who didn't, but we know Aaron did and we know Jesus did &gt;&gt; because they can't pluck what's not there. &gt;&gt; It ran down that anointing oil. It ran and all the way down to the hymn of the ifad to the hymn of the garment of the priest holy anointing oil. And brother, if you want me to take two two more hours here, I can and break down every ingredient of that holy anointing oil and tell you that there is so much life and so much revelation and so much truth in the ingredients in that oil and how it was made and how it was to be sacred and how that it was to be set apart and how that it represents the anointing and without the anointing. I heard somebody preaching on stream this weekend about the anointing &gt;&gt; and we've got to have him &gt;&gt; because him is the anointing is not just an it. &gt;&gt; It's not a fourth part of the godhead. &gt;&gt; It it's the spirit life of Christ. &gt;&gt; He is Messiah. Messiah means anointed one. And when we feel the anointing, what do you think we're feeling? We're feeling an increase of the presence of the anointed one. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, it's life. &gt;&gt; It's life to us. What about the word? The word is life. &gt;&gt; But the word can either be life or death. Because the letter of the word &gt;&gt; can kill. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But you pour that oil. &gt;&gt; The anointing is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; So all of you who say, "I didn't feel the anointing." Don't be surprised because sometimes you may feel and sense the anointing and sometimes you may not know that it's there except by the results &gt;&gt; not by how you felt. &gt;&gt; Because God may have you in a sober mind. He may have you in a sober mind so that you can sit there and say Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus. If you get drunk, if you get lost in the spirit, there might not be anybody standing in the gap in that moment. So you may feel, you may not feel. How many of you know we're not living by feeling? &gt;&gt; We're living by faith. But oh, when we feel it. &gt;&gt; That's why we sing sweet, sweet anointing flowing down to make me clean. Like a mighty rushing stream. Sweet, [Music] sweet, anointing, pouring out. Ha the oil and wine all over me. It's the touch from the hand of precious Jesus dipped into [Music] the oil of the Holy Ghost. It will soothe all our fears. Tears dry away all our tears. It's the anointing that I need the most. Why don't you sing with us? Sweet. Sweet [Music] anointing. Woo! &gt;&gt; Flowing down to make me clean like a mighty yo. Oh sweet, [Music] sweet anointing. Pouring out the oil and wine all over me. [Music] pouring out the oil and wine all over me. [Laughter] God bless you. Be seated. Thank you for responding &gt;&gt; whether you're standing or not. Thank you for responding. You never know in what moment like that in the middle of the word &gt;&gt; that he'll come riding in on your praise &gt;&gt; and settle down. And once he settled down over you, you don't need any more knowledge. You don't need any more information. Once he has settled down like that, you just ask. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of, you just ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in gifts interrupting the preaching, but I believe in the giver. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; I believe he can come whenever he gets ready. &gt;&gt; Ride. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm I think I'm sorry, but I I only feel sorry for like a half a second when I say that and then the all the sorry just runs off of me and I'm not sorry at all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's alive. Yes. &gt;&gt; He's life to me. &gt;&gt; Now I I got to close 135. That's that's that's plenty long. We are if we if we're going to use this God's time piece, brother Brandham said, you want to know the timing of the Lord, &gt;&gt; watch Israel. &gt;&gt; Well, you've got to know who Israel is. And there's a great great controversy over who Israel is and is all Israeli citizens Israel. Of course not. Of course not. There are Arab Muslim citizens of Israel. Even though it was never founded to be a nation of citizens who were not Jews, the UN resolution was to ba make finally a homeland for the Jews. And those wicked people who say, "Why would the Jews deserve a homeland and not the Africans or the Asians? Everybody deserves a place to call home. &gt;&gt; Everybody. And that's why America has become a melting pot &gt;&gt; for those who desire to come in a legal manner. &gt;&gt; But what we don't need is all the criminals &gt;&gt; of other nations &gt;&gt; who might encroach upon our own safety and freedom. And if you don't like that, I &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It's just common sense. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, what other religion?" Well, you understand that the Jews are not just given, they weren't just given a a homeland because of their religion. They were given also a homeland because their ethnicity and their religion is one. &gt;&gt; It cannot be said about any other nation. And it can be said and because half the Jewish population of the entire world, &gt;&gt; half was wiped out in in little over three-year period of history, half the Jewish population. No other people have proportionately suffered like they suffered. But there every person living in the modern state of Israel, no, they're not all uh spiritual Israel. They're not all true Jews. And some will tell you right away they're not Jewish. And some are Palestinian because Israel multiple times through the years has opened citizenship up for Palestinian people who could prove their dedication to hard work and separating themselves from their violent connections with Hamas or Hezbollah or the Palestinian Authority or some of those other. If if you want to come and live among us and work among us, you we want you to do that. And they have opened it up multiple times. So we can't say that a that a nation has the promise. But there are people in that nation who have the promise. There are people in this nation who have the promise. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us in order for them to live as full beneficiaries of their promise, they needed to be in the homeland. &gt;&gt; The same is true for you and I. But our homeland is not a geographical piece of dirt. &gt;&gt; Our homeland is the promise that is provided for us by the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; That is the promised land. &gt;&gt; The full revelation of Jesus Christ which is more than 1100 1200 tapes. &gt;&gt; He said it is Genesis &gt;&gt; to Revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all a revelation of Jesus Christ. That is our homeland. Our homeland is the word. &gt;&gt; And we can't be the full beneficiaries of being the bride of Christ, Mrs. Jesus Christ. If we live apart from the homeland, &gt;&gt; which which is not represented by icons, &gt;&gt; it's represented by lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. lives and truth. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not some of these fanciful things they say in the name of truth, but truth, pure truth. That's what's going to get us there. &gt;&gt; So, we're in a season of of teshovah, which is a time of of inner reflection and uh repentance. It's it's really a season of return. Come home. Come home to papa. Come home to covenant relationship. Come home. It's it's an invitation. When that trumpet sounded in scripture every year, yam trua. Every year it was a yearly call to return home. Return to abba. Return to papa. Return to the God of your fathers, the God of your mothers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. By the way, that's the God of the Christian. &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham is your God. The God of the God of Isaac is your God. The guy the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yakov, Israel, he is also your God. &gt;&gt; Allah is not your God. Pope so and so, it's not your God. &gt;&gt; Pastor, somebody is not your God. &gt;&gt; But your God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And you don't have to come and be a Jew &gt;&gt; for him to be your God. &gt;&gt; But you do have to come and have covenant with him. &gt;&gt; You do. You've got to pledge your life and follow him. So every year on the Hebrew calendar according to the scripture from El 1 all the way to Tish 10 which is the beginning of the Hebrew month El and the and the 10th day of the Hebrew monthish which is the day of atonement is a 40-day period of God saying come home. Use this 40 days to repent if you need to repent. Use this 40 days to return. If you need to return, turn your heart back toward Papa's house. &gt;&gt; Pursue Papa and he will help you with your career. He'll help you with your family life. He'll help you with your financial situation. Pursue Papa. &gt;&gt; You're not chasing a corporate ladder. You're chasing your papa. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Your aba. &gt;&gt; And when you do that, seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I'd go there if I could." Well, you don't have to. It's come to us. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God has come to us. You don't have to go somewhere to be a part of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God comes to where we are. Jesus told us the kingdom of God is &gt;&gt; within. It's within. The ark of the covenant is no longer uh uh behind a curtain somewhere in a in in a Mishkan or in a temple. The the ark of the covenant has been moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, there may still exist a physical representation. In fact, I'm one who believes it's there. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a mercy seat. I believe you'll hear the prophet say &gt;&gt; that there's a mercy seat within. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if there's a mercy seat, the mercy seat was a lid. &gt;&gt; I doubt you have a lid without the box. &gt;&gt; So, it's a throne. &gt;&gt; It's a throne. It was created to represent everything in the tabernacle. Everything in the temple was created to represent the furniture &gt;&gt; furnishings if you will of the throne room of our God. &gt;&gt; How do we know that? Because Moses was taken there by spirit. Saw it, came down, found a craftsman, told him what he saw. The craftsman said, "You describe it, I'll build it." And he did. And the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat on top was from the description of the throne. &gt;&gt; And sitting right on top are two of the guardians of the throne. &gt;&gt; Cherub beams. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; there were guardians. They've always been guardians. They will always be a representation of God's divine government and guardianship. And that's why he placed them with flaming swords to make sure that Adam and Eve didn't stumble back in and gain illegal access to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; They forfeited their original right to the tree of life by tasting first of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That's why they had to leave the garden and leave the land of Eden. And that's why a cherubim was placed there according to the Hebrew word with a flaming sword that turned in all four directions so that no enemy would be able to stumble into the way. &gt;&gt; Wasn't just guarding the tree of life. It wasn't just guarding the garden of Eden. It was guarding the way. another time. &gt;&gt; This is about awakening and I I'm done. Have to be. The reason why we even mark it, mention it. Well, I think you're making a big doodoo. Oh, you've never seen a big to-do. I got a few big to-dos left in me. I may pull one out for you sometime, &gt;&gt; but I'm feeling my 50 years of experience yesterday. 50 years. 19 September 20th, 1975. [Applause] It's him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus, that you can not only save somebody, but you can keep somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you for your keeping power. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Aren't you thankful for his keeping power? &gt;&gt; We're going home now in a minute. The piano stool is at my house. I'm going to bring it. The altar bench is down there. I'll bring it and show you the first pull pit that I ever used. And my granny got up. She was the pastor at the time. And she said, "Now you folks know Steve just like you know me. You've seen you've seen his unusual life. All God's people have him." And uh he he believes that he's called to preach. I do too. And you were here. You saw the you saw the prophecy that Sister Cotney gave. and you've seen the how God kept his life. And so we're going to give him the pull pit and I don't know what it'll be like. It'll be God. I'm going to trust that maybe five minutes. But his big mama, that's what she called her. But his big mama will be right here to back him up. And it wasn't just my big mama. It was everybody in the room. Everybody. full support, tremendous support. And you know what makes the difference? You can map it all out. I did. I had index cards. My my my mama's mama, she said, "Honey, can I help you? Is there something I could do?" She's a little Baptist. Hadn't got the Holy Ghost yet. He said, "Can I?" I said, "Big mama, I believe I'm supposed to do this just me and him." I mean, mama, excuse me, mama, I believe I'm just supposed to do this, me and him. But I said, "You can pray." And she was about that tall. And I heard her go down the hallway and close her bedroom door. Excuse me. Close her bedroom door. And I heard her knees. I'd heard it before. I'd seen it before. She was just Baptist by faith. But I heard those knees when they hit the floor. And she cried out like a Pentecostal, "Oh Jesus, have mercy. Give him your word." And I had it all mapped out. I had wrote down there, "Bow your heads cuz I was afraid I'd forget." And he came and when he comes, you didn't need all that. &gt;&gt; I just preached. What do you give me? And uh he's been faithful. I haven't always been, but he has been faithful. This uh yearly reminder uh is to show us of an awakening. Musicians, could you come? But I'm going to give you this as you come because if I don't hit this, we hadn't we hadn't hit it. There are three great trumpets mentioned in the Bible. The first trump, the last trump, the great trump. I encourage you to write that down if you've got a pen. First Trump, last trump or trumpet. Trump is short for trumpet. First, I better say, oh, I better say trumpet, hadn't I? We're dealing in feast and not presidents. First trumpet was at Sinai. I'll preach it to you again sometime. Exodus 19:18 and 19. This is when the the giving of the instruction took place at Shàuote, which we call in Greek Pentecost. And then there's the last trump. And that last trump or trumpet, the last trumpet is the one that is sounded on the feast of trumpets. Yam trua. this season and it is the one that is directly associated with the resurrection of the dead which for us is both resurrection and rapture. So it's not a surprise that it's the feast of the unknown because no man knoweth the day nor the hour not even the angels know when that is going to sound when that moment is going to be fulfilled. We don't know the day. We don't know the hour. The Gregorian calendar is in error. And so is the Hebrew calendar. We know that. We know that it has been corrupted several times down through history. And because of that, we have no real idea if this is September 21st or not. But at some point, somebody had to say it's going to be. And the Hebrew calendar has been thus adjusted the same way. Somebody had to say. And that's why in the in the beginning, the Hebrew calendar was based on the phases of the moon. And that meant that some months were expanded longer than one year than they would be the next year because you couldn't announce a new month without a new moon. And sometime the new moon was there, but it had to be seen by at least three people. And if it was cloudy, you just hang around in August another day or two, except on the Hebrew calendar. And so we don't know the day. And this is what Jesus was saying. He knew he knew of the corruption of the calendar, which there was no Gregorian calendar. It was only it was only some they had some Greek uh replacement but the people in the Bible were were living by the lunar the moon calendar not the sun calendar but he knew that there was corruption. You put Pharisees uh and the pheriseical spirit on anything and they corrupt it. And this is why he said no man knoweth the day nor the hour not even the angels in heaven. But what he didn't say, sometimes we learn by what is said, sometimes we learn by what is not said, day or the hour. But he didn't say we won't know the season. And the season is directly connected with the feast of the unknown, which according to the Hebrew calendar begins tomorrow evening at sundown. Are you trying to tell us that the rapture would take place? I I'm not saying that at all. I In fact, I just said it's probably not even the real day. But we're in the right season. You understand? &gt;&gt; We're in the right season. &gt;&gt; Every year when those days of tesha come, the days of return and repentance, we know that we are preparing ourselves. These are called in Bible moeds or excuse me that's English to put an s on moed in Hebrew it's moedim and that's why he's he's Elohim and that's why we say cherubim it's plural and we understand what was I saying season we don't know the day we don't know the hour but we know that is soon is that teshovah comes. It's a time of repentance and return and we start preparing the Jewish people and those who keep covenant with God. We mention it. We we we celebrate in some way. We commemorate it much to the aggravation of some. And that's why I'm more determined than ever. We know that we're entering into the season of the fall feast. And if Jesus in his birth and death and life fulfilled to the letter, to the hour, to the very time, the very time that the lambs were to be slaughtered, the very day, the very time, the very place that they were to be slaughtered from the Exodus all the way up into the into the New Testament, into the time of Jesus, say, "And he was crucified the same day, the same hour in the same city where the lamb had been killed over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. He fulfilled it. He rose on the feast of first fruits, a festival of the Lord that had been celebrated from the time of Leviticus from the time of the Exodus all the way to the time of Jesus in second temple period and everything about his death and resurrection and his ascension and the pouring out of the Holy Ghost on Shàuote, Pentecost, all of it fulfilled. Then why would we not believe that there is some sort of symbol, some sort of connection to the fall feast? Well, I know there there is. It would be foolish to try to deny it. And so, we can say that it's in the season that we're entering in now that two amazing things are going to happen. One, this little bride will respond to the sound of the chauffar, not the trumpet. Every time it speaks of this, it uses the word connected to this. This is nothing without breath. &gt;&gt; Did you ever hear brother Brandham say that the voice of the resurrection would be in the bride? So, so that's what it was about. It's about something else now. &gt;&gt; It's about you and I becoming &gt;&gt; the hollowed out. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; We're becoming the hollowed out. &gt;&gt; So that a breath can &gt;&gt; Huh. can make a sound. The voice of the bridegroom, the sound of the bridegroom's message. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. 1 Corinthians 15. We shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the not the first trump that shall vote, Pentecost, giving of the law at Si. Not the great trump. The great trump also takes place during this season somewhere in the future. That great trump sounds and he puts his feet on the Mount of Olives, reveals himself to the Jewish people. What is this in your hand? This is the scars that I have received in the household of my friends. That's right. &gt;&gt; They weep their way through receiving the second time what they rejected the first time. That's what he said. Scripture, Zechariah, and the prophet to this age. But this last trump is the one that wakens the dead in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be &gt;&gt; changed. &gt;&gt; We understand now by revelation of this message that it's not a one boom bam gone. It's a process. That's right. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians reveals the process, &gt;&gt; but it has to start and it has to process in order to culminate. &gt;&gt; For this corruptible, [Music] &gt;&gt; must put on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Incorruption. And the mortal &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; must put on what? &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16:18. For the Lord himself, the angel of the covenant, the one with a rainbow about his head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a &gt;&gt; shout, &gt;&gt; which is a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can't have a messenger without a message. proving his word. &gt;&gt; Do you know the message? Do you know that? Do you know the sermon? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Proving his word as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming. Your message. Proving his word. Your message. Not you. Your message. The emphasis is never to be on but one messenger, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ, the messenger angel of the covenant, &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, I must decrease, he must increase. Amen. but your message. Now, there are other times that messenger was put in and that is often times what they quote because they want to convince us of this unscriptural teaching that the message and the messenger are exactly the same. That's not biblically correct. It sounds good if you're trying to convince someone to believe something, but it's not biblically correct. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Ouch. Sorry. Sorry. But that message has to be the same. That message has to be that which lines up with that word that is already spoken. It has to dovetail. And when it dovetales, it's like it's like an unveiling. It's an expansion of understanding because you've got the word there as the letter and you've got the interpretation, the the inspiration of the revealing and unveiling of Jesus Christ. It comes down fits right on that word and that's that's what forerruns your message shall forrun the second coming. I believe it with all my heart. I believe the Lord has sent a message of truth to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But I believe that we are slightly disadvantaged if we're only pointing it backward. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; And not forward. &gt;&gt; I I believe he pointed forward &gt;&gt; and we did until the last 15, 20 years. And now it seems to be the trend to only point backward. How can you be ready for something that hasn't come yet if you're doing what the frogs did in the book of the Revelation, only looking back? &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to look back. Get the truth of Moses, &gt;&gt; right? and and the Joshua Holy Ghost, he said it has got to carry us all the way to our homeland. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I'm closing. I'm closing. I'm closing with this. The rapture. First thing is a sounding, a shout, the voice, a trumpet shout, a messenger getting people ready. The second, a voice of the resurrection, the same voice. Then whose voice is it? &gt;&gt; Same voice. &gt;&gt; That a loud voice in St. John 11:38-44. The same voice &gt;&gt; that called Lazarus. &gt;&gt; I know that voice. I know that voice. How many of you can say, "Thank God I know that voice." &gt;&gt; The one that called Lazarus from the grave, getting the bride together, and then the resurrection of the dead. See to be caught up with it. Three things takes place. Now the third thing, a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is calling the people. Did brother Brandham just say that? &gt;&gt; Bless his heart. You think he wanted everybody to be Jews? No. He wanted us to know where to look. &gt;&gt; Amen. which always the feast of the trumpets is calling the people where to the feast. Did you know that Yam Tura the feast of the trumpets is calling us to uh atonement and atonement is calling us to tabernacles where God himself, the scripture said, will dwell with man &gt;&gt; and God himself shall wipe the tears from off of their eyes. It doesn't get much better than that. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; And there'll be that'll be the bride's supper. Oh, bride supper. I thought it was a Jewish feast. The bride supper. He said the lamb supper. That's bridegroom with the bride. Woo. &gt;&gt; In the sky. &gt;&gt; Yes. The first thing that comes forth is his message calling the bride together. The next thing is a resurrection of what? [Music] &gt;&gt; The feast of the trumpet is the feast of the awakening. It awakens the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need some awakening. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And then the trumpet, the feast in the heavens and this what this thing that takes place. We're ready. We're right there. Ready now. The only thing the church is coming out has got to lay before the sun, which is the sen to ripen. Make sure you don't rotten, but you ripen. If you get too much spirit, &gt;&gt; and not enough sen, &gt;&gt; which is body word, or you get too much body word and not enough moisture, which is spirit rain, spirit life, you either dry up or you rot. &gt;&gt; But if you'll lay in the presence of the S O N, &gt;&gt; not a son of man, lay in the presence of the son of man. S O N and you'll ripen. &gt;&gt; I could tell you why, but I said we were done. The great combine will come by. And it is. It's coming by now. Metaphorically, spiritually, we could say it's coming by right now. And what is it doing? It's gathering the grain into the garner with spiritual food in due season. And the wheat then the stalk is to be burned. Pretty serious business. So listen to this. And and I I'm just gonna go sit down. Benjamin, you better have a song. You better be ready. The trump, the last trumpet, listen. That will call up the bride to Christ to the rapture. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is the same trumpet that will call back Moses and Elijah, their spirit to fall on two men who will preach the gospel to the 144,000 according to Revelation 11. There'll be prophets and it will be a simultaneous event. The bride goes at the sound of that trumpet, the the blast of awakening, the shout, the noise of the king, the bride goes into a change, a final change, and and the spirit that was in Elijah, the spirit that was in Moses falls down on two prophets to the Jews. and they give that great short ministry to the to the remnant of the 144,000. It's a simultaneous thing. Uh those of you who are looking at me like I just pulled that out of my ear ear canal. It's in the feast of trumpets. He said, "Now as the church, as this church, the bride is drawn together, she is taken up and that maste of the unknown. Feast of the unknown. I I I don't know. It It went by me. I made out the first. I made out the It went by me in an unknown tongue." He said, "I could not couldn't let's talk like the Kuckian. I couldn't make it out. &gt;&gt; She's taken up." And that mystery of the seventh seal or the seventh seal, the mystery of I I don't I'm not going to interpret it. I I don't think it has to be. He says it remains a mystery until the going because the revelation of the mystery is in the going. Now there's a quick short work that precedes the going. So, Brother Brandon wasn't misspeaking when he said multiple times in the preaching of the seven seal series how gracious God was to reveal six and the people kept pressuring him. You said you said you and Dr. prevailed have said that the seventh angel messenger is to do two things. So this has got to be finished. One part two part was the rest of that couldn't make it out and later you'll hear him say a time or two we have the seventh but what is it? They say they know, but they won't tell anybody. I don't have much confidence in that. But here is what he said. The mystery of the going. And the Jews is called by the mystery, not the feast of trumpets. Sometimes they get this confused. He's talking now about the seven trumpets. And he says, "What the seven seals are to the Gentiles, the seven trumpets are to the Jews." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, we can call that a feast, but there weren't seven trumpets in the feast of trumpets. And so, it's most likely similar, but not one in the same. And the Jews is called by the mystery of the seventh trumpet which is what? &gt;&gt; Two prophets Elijah and Moses. And they come back. Now that's how it's connected. The seventh trumpet is a another installment of the fulfillment of the seventh trumpet. Seventh trumpet. Feast of trumpets. And it causes the bride to change into into resurrection rapture. And it causes two prophets to be anointed with the spirit of Moses and the spirit of Elijah. And boy, they preach they preach their little hearts out. And the same spirit, you don't you don't have to agree with this. Just don't get my face later. The same spirit that wants to take out good men today is the same religious spirit. You say, "Well, this wasn't religious. It was political." Don't you understand that we're already in the hour &gt;&gt; where the political is the religious and the religious is the political? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Didn't you understand that Babylon would change? Yes. &gt;&gt; And while everybody's harping on the reformation of the Roman Empire, what we have before us is something uh gross, something more fearful than than a physical restoration of the Roman Empire. We now have something that has morphed from religious to political and now it has become a a mixture of political power and religious power coming out of Rome. Oh, &gt;&gt; that's where we are. And the same spirit falls that wants to take out a good man testifying of truth today, biblical truth today. Listen, I weep. I don't care what you say or what you think. When I hear somebody, I know that it's we're trained in the message world. We're trained not to get excited about anything that doesn't happen around us. &gt;&gt; Come on. But when I hear, I don't care who you are. &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're serpent seed. I don't know the difference. You see, because we're not to be trying to figure out who's who's his and who's not. That's not our play. So when I hear somebody say, "I've read the Bible for the first time or for the first time in many years of my life this week, it grips my heart." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, are they going to understand what they read?" Did you? Come on. &gt;&gt; Did you understand it in the beginning? &gt;&gt; Then how do you understand it now? When he the spirit is true, when he, the spirit of truth, has come, &gt;&gt; he will lead you and guide you and direct you into all truth. So Lord, let them read their Bible this week. &gt;&gt; And if there's any representation of your life in them, you go get them next week. &gt;&gt; Your will, your will is sovereign. Your way is suffering. &gt;&gt; The reading the romance and the stupid uh AI generated pornography AI generated superhero and all the things the world anime or however you say the demonic stuff that people are so wrapped up in. &gt;&gt; What is it if somebody says I picked up a Bible? And I read &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Worthy is the lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is he. [Music] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy sing. [Music] Worthy is the lamb who was slain.

Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. Tomorrow evening at sundown is the blowing of the chauffear as we have heard today. and got a inspiration yesterday morning that perhaps I would gather a couple of friends and blow the chauffear tomorrow at sundown. The more I thought of it, the bigger it became. And I presented the idea to brother Shelley that we would gather on the campground and whoever was interested would come. There was one problem. I forgot that we were supposed to celebrate Stephen as he is God has blessed him and he is about to marry wife. We were going to celebrate him. So, brother Joshua has been very fluid. We're going to move that time back to 6 o'lock. Brother Truman, it's at brother Truman, Sister Martha's house. Brothers, we're going to move that back to 6:00 rather than 6:30. Those that are going to be doing the cooking are hopefully going to be doing it ahead of time that we can eat right away. If you can't make it there by six o'clock, come when you can come. Well, we're going to gather here on the campground tomorrow evening at 7:15. Sunset is at 7:37 and we want to blow the sha chauffear right around that time. What we're really calling for is for more of the wind of God, &gt;&gt; more of the breath of God &gt;&gt; to breathe on us &gt;&gt; on this eagle's refuge. that more of his breath. We can go back to celebrating afterward. The tradition is that we have apples and honey. I happen to know a man that has some honey. We can probably get the apples, but we're going to come at 7:15, have a little bit of worship leading up to 7:37 when the sun sets and the blowing of the chauffear. So, if you wish to join us, anybody that's here, you wish to join us tomorrow, 7:15, outside, not here in the building, outside, and we're going to have a little time of worship and blowing of the chauffear and perhaps some apples and honey to celebrate the new year as the Jews would do. Until then, may the Lord bless you and may his breath be increased in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want more of his breath &gt;&gt; in me. Because the calling of the bride in the end time is a call for the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And we want to be at the right season, the right time, the right word to call forth what he has called us to be. Love one another as you leave today in the fear of the Lord. You're worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. [Music] For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. You're worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. [Music] For from you are all things. For you deserve the glory. You're worthy of it all. You're worthy of it all. [Music] For from you are all [Music]
