thankful that you do and I'm glad that you're here this morning you may be seated we have experienced already the presence of the Lord you see her maybe you're feeling a little bit tired you have partied this weekend with your Thanksgiving get-togethers and some of you are still in a turkey coma I can tell you but you know it's one time a year I'm glad and uh God deserves Our Praise again and again and above and again and it's good to be in the house of the Lord and even though we have many who are not with us today you're here and more importantly than that he's here he's here and we're here to lift him up and I have a word from the Lord for you in just a moment if you have come to hear from him I believe you will because I believe he's here you uh I didn't hear when when uh Ben was welcoming Deb he said gab so quickly until I didn't know who he was welcoming I didn't clap as hard as I would have if I'd have known who it was for but we're very glad to have gab with us from uh Quebec and that's a long way away French Canada and uh we have some good memories this church used to have a real connection with the church that Gab came out of I mean is is attending now grew up in and some of you will remember brother Andre petite who came here multiple times brother uh brother John Majors some of you will remember him and uh there are a few other brothers who I don't remember their name there were wives that came and there were wonderful people Dominique was with us for a while and we have hosted more than one occasion sister Cindy timmermans who married a brother from that church and they have visited with us here many times so we have a connection with those wonderful people there and we're glad that Gab is with us and then I heard brother Ben mentioning Josh Seiler this is Jump week is this week coming up I I don't understand exactly why someone would choose to jump out of a perfect perfectly good airplane you know it seems like you'd want to stay in but some people's job and commitment and career requires that they do and he's had far worse training than that harder training than that so this should be a breeze just wanted you to know we have full confidence in you I'm glad it's you so glad it's you and not me or my children I'm not interested in that I'm going to stay in the plane I have to get in them sometime for travel but the word says lo I will be with you always didn't say anything about but God is good brother Josh was talking Josh Yantis was talking about his uh flight going up to Maryland and he said Caleb said oh this is a Night Flight and Josh said it feels more like a fright flight so evidently it was a little bit rough you know I appreciate those who made the extra effort I know some were so far away that they couldn't get back for today but I appreciate those who made the extra effort to be with us today Josh and charity and Luke and Caleb took a Night Flight and didn't get to the house till about 1 30 this morning so they could be in church today I appreciate that dedication Benjamin and Jenna drove eight hours yesterday from Arkansas got in last night so that they could be in church today and I I want to mention that because I think it's something that that that should be mentioned and I know again that uh for instance brother Austin and sister Anna Christine were in Iowa well that's a long way to go and I understand that and they're streaming and I'm going to let them off the hook but if you're planning the trips and you're planning the Thanksgiving why why would you plan it on a Sunday when you know that we have one day of the week that we dedicate to the Lord so I appreciate you being here today and uh I know some people plan their getaways so that they can be gone on a Sunday but I like to try to plan mine so that I can be home because there's no place I would rather be if we would have sung the verse to that chorus there's no place I'd rather be than with the ones that have been set free that's right and so I want to honor those of you who are here and those of you who are not here but you're streaming and I want to acknowledge that and I want to acknowledge that that while while babies are coming sister Hannah is streaming the service from the hospital and Thanking us for our prayers so it must not be too intense yet or she might be screaming turn that thing off and let me have this baby but anyway we send our love to her and those who are streaming in various places Arkansas Kentucky Missouri uh God bless every one of you Arizona several countries in Africa Trinidad uh Saints in Indiana Saints in Vancouver British Columbia Saints in the Netherlands Saints in Athens Georgia and just wherever you are streaming the service we recognize that there are all kinds of channels there are all kinds of services being streamed and we're honored that you would choose to be a part of ours and may God bless you and I looked at the calendar can I have just a little more volume in my Monitor here um I looked at the calendar I didn't see birthdays this week somebody surely must be having a birthday but I didn't see one on the calendar and but there is a very special day tomorrow and that is Sister Stacy and I are celebrating our wedding anniversary number 25. is that silver am I supposed to buy silver I have a couple of nice silver trumpets here honey could I interest you in those they're real silver I don't know what I'm supposed to buy for a silver we certainly don't need to buy a 25 plaque do we we don't need anything else stuck around the house for sure and somebody said what are you going to do for your anniversary well a couple years ago we started talking about going to Hawaii and uh and uh but we don't eat pig and so we couldn't do a luau and the next thing you know so many wanted to go with us it was going to turn into a tour group or something and even Hunter amalong said I'm going with you and sister Stacy on your anniversary trip so we just canceled the whole thing I hope somebody'll play that for Hunter we just canceled the whole thing you're not going to be a party crasher oh we're going to do something exotic uh but it'll be a couple months before we do and and we're we're thinking we might go to the Caribbean or something we're a little more interested in that maybe right now than Hawaii because we would like to take our kids to Hawaii I would love to stand in Pearl Harbor with my kids I'd like for them to be able to see that as well so we're going to dinner that's our big celebration and somebody said just you and your wife no no all the kids too somebody said that's kind of sad no it's not sad at all that's exactly what we want we want that your life changes you just your life just changes when you have kids especially if you like them it's a plus it's a plus if you like them and you enjoy their company so that's it that's those of you who've asked that's what we're going to do we're going to dinner with the kids and no you're not invited but uh we'll go with you another time if you invite us and uh but I want to say to my wife you deserve much more than silver you deserve a lot of crowns your crowns are going to be so many and so heavy that it's going to take angels to help you carry them because anybody who can live with me for 25 years serve me the way you have and our family you deserve to be mentioned I love you very much I'm very very thankful for you 25 years well if you if you ask her you know in the marriage counseling sometimes people will ask her questions they'll say you know how long is it hard well after a year she said that first year can be really hard and then after five years I heard her tell somebody well those first five years they can be really hard and ten years come along I heard her telling somebody well if you can get through the first 10 years so I have a feeling that if you ask her today she would say if you can manage the first 25 years you should be all right it's not easy if someone tells you it is they're not being completely honest it's not easy but if if someone makes you feel like it's not worth it they're very wrong it's worth every minute of it when you know that you have got the one that God chose for you in eternity the one you're going to spend eternity with then no matter how you might struggle or what may come along you'll get through it if you let Jesus be not the silent someone said you know we need Jesus to be the silent partner in the marriage well if he ain't talking he's not really involved is he no he he needs to be the one doing the talking the leadership and helping and guiding and directing and I don't know how anybody makes it without the Lord I don't know how any marriage survives without the Lord do you but I feel like I'm a very blessed man and um and I'm thankful very very thankful thank you for praying for ma she is stronger and um she is still very distant and she doesn't recognize us but she's breathing a whole lot better than she was and we're thankful for that and uh would ask that you would continue to pray for her that God will help her as long as her days and hours are on this Earth she needs the Lord's help and I want you to to keep praying for her if you will are you ready for the word let's stand I'm going back to the book of beginnings Genesis let's thank God for these musicians singers and worship leaders let's do better than that come on let's thank God for them thank God for them [Applause] oh no darling my wife texted me she said you said the kids were coming to dinner Nora wants to know if she's coming too oh dear Genesis 1 beginning in verse 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so uh let me paralyze uh paralyze let me paralyze that verse let me paraphrase that verse by saying what brother Branham said he said every Apple that was ever going to be in the Earth was represented in that first apple tree that God made the seed was there and that was the potential of every Apple that was ever going to be in the earth and I think that's a powerful way of expressing what this verse is saying and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind just like God said and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was Tov good it was tof and the evening and the morning were the third day not the morning and the evening but the evening and the morning because the new day begins not when it's getting light the new day begins when it's still dark outside don't ever forget that according to the Bible the new day begins when it's still dark so if you're waiting on the sun to rise to declare the new day you're waiting too long you've got to declare that the sun s-o-n has risen even though it may look very dark in the world around us can you say Amen and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night so understand that this creation of sun and moon was to divide light from Darkness night from day to divide the day from the night and let them be sun moon and stars let them be for signs for seasons and for days and years let me read this verse again and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be foresigns and for seasons and for days and years before you're seated if you'll turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 beginning in verse 1 you're very familiar with this portion of scripture I'm sure to everything there is a season to everything there's a season and the time to every purpose under heaven we're going to verse 8 all the way down a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and the time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak A Time To Love and a time to hate a time of War and a time of peace to everything there is a season and the time for every purpose under Heaven let's pray together father we thank you today that you are allowing us once again to approach your word it's holy it's sacred even in its printed form it is Holy even in its electronic form it is sacred it's precious it's valuable we recognize that it is you it is a written expression of who you are your thoughts expressed to us it is a guide a road map it is encouragement and also correction it is strength and at times renders us weak convicted brokenhearted when we see how far we have fallen from your truth restore us today Lord we pray refresh us renew us may we be recreated by the spirit of the most high God may we be quickened and Made Alive by The Living Word we are in relationship with the Living Word the written word is our marriage covenant it is our katuba it is our contract with you you sealed it with your own blood we love it because it's your gift to us but more than loving your written word we love you because you are the living reality of that word and we will glorify your name for every way in which you help us today and we ask that you strengthen the saints that they might exercise their faith and they might that they might also use the power of the amen of the agreement in sealing this word into their own hearts and lives and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua hamashiach we pray and the saint said amen you may be seated are you ready I'm not sure but the time has come I want you to look at somebody I don't care who it is it can be the one next to you or the one across the room but I want you to look at somebody and I want you to say to them it's time for a change it's huge you might be telling them that uh they need a little more deodorant you you you you might be telling them they don't need quite as much perfume you could be saying something a lot deeper than that you could be telling them that the five pounds of of pumpkin pie and turkey aren't agreeing with them and they need to do something about I don't know what you mean when you say it but it's just a good thing to say I want to remind you that before there were computers and iPads and cell phones and watches and even paper and pencil God gave us something to help us keep track of where we are concerning time we just read that to you in the scripture if you don't know where you are you'll never be able to determine where you're going in God seasons and what to do and when to do what we know to do we need to be able to understand that there are times of ebb when the waters draw back and there are times of flow when the waters push forward we are a spirit people we are a people that are called to walk not by the flesh but by the spirit the Bible tells us lean not to your own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and what will he do he will direct our path you'll never have to stumble if you're following the leadership of the spirit may God help every one of us to tune our spiritual ear you've got physical ears and you've got five physical senses but you also have spiritual senses and we as a people are learning not only to utilize our natural senses but we are learning to exercise to put are you with me to put in action our spiritual senses to be able to discern and by the way the gift of Suspicion is not one of the nine gifts of the Spirit some people call discernment when really they're operating in a spirit of suspicion God's not pleased with that you can come out on the wrong end if I could just have a little more maybe somewhere brother RJ in the house or up here I know it seems that when you put it up here it's squealing but I just need a little bit of a fuller sound so that I don't don't feel like I'm screaming but I don't want to I don't want to be too loud for you all either maybe I'm already very loud to you and I don't want to do that without seasons in our life those Ebbs and flows those times to embrace and those times to refrain from embracing those times to mourn and those times to dance and celebrate without those seasons in our life we can become extremely frustrated because we are doing things in the wrong timing come on now in the wrong season it's not only crucial to do the right thing it's also crucial to do the right thing at the right time otherwise you can do the right thing in the wrong season and not receive the Harvest that you are sowing for does anybody understand what I'm what I'm saying doing things at the right time is very very crucial therefore understanding the seasons of the Lord are very important you need to know when God is trying to build up the church and you need to know when God's trying to bring it back down to a to a little more of a of a time of of Consecration and dedication a time to be on top of the horse riding in Victory and a time to be underneath him right down on the bottom with your face on the ground calling out to God for his Sovereign will to be revealed in your life I want you to know that when God was creating the sun and the moon and the stars he could have caused the sun to shine all the time 24 hours of the day and had he done that there would be there would never be a change in the seasons if he did that we would never know many things if the sun should shine 24 hours of the day seven days a week 365 days of the year we would never know when to rest of being someone who has spent some considerable time in Iceland and other places referred to like Norway and places like that the land of the Midnight Sun I want you to know when it is midnight outside in still daylight it's hard to rest it's hard to go to sleep your body is responding to the light and it really can throw off your your body clock so we need to know when it's time to rest and we need to know when it's time to plant and we need to know when it's time to harvest what we've planted seasons are important and the sun ceasing to shine at some point of the day is an important part of God's creation I assure you that Evolution didn't do that I assure you that it didn't just happen happenstance I can assure you that a Creator all wise God all knowledgeable God all-knowing God created things the way they are he created seasons in first Chronicles chapter 12 and verse 32 and I'm I'm doing this the way I'm doing it for a reason so I hope it won't throw you off I hope you'll just stay with me and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times God help us this is Old Testament and there was a particular man who had descendants and those descendants seemed to be particularly attuned to understanding times to such a degree that they would know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their Brethren were at their commandment can you imagine there being 200 men Among Us in the body of Christ who could understand the times who could tell us what we should be doing as a nation what we should be doing as a church body what we should be doing as a family of Faith what we should be doing as an individual somebody who lived so close to the heartbeat of God that they can lay their head over on his chest and discern the very beat of his heart for his people we need that in this hour it's not a prophet a prophet that we need in this hour what we need is a prophetic people we need a company of prophetic people now when I say that I'm not referring to the fact that God has already sent us a messenger he's done his job and in spite of what some people believe he finished it and he finished it well he's not coming back for a one-man Resurrection he's not going to go across this country preaching under a tent no no that's a spiritual vision you know I I'm amazed sometime I don't want to get too far off this I've worked too hard I don't want to get too far off but I'm amazed sometime at how carnal men are always trying to interpret spiritual visions and dreams really really dangerous to do for instance you take this experience that brother Branham had what we now call the tent vision and you remember that he was fishing and you remember that he was having a hard time getting it just right you know he was snatching too hard wasn't he snatched fish and everything one part of that Vision he had just a a little old fish it was so little that it was just stretched over the lure they're stretched over the bay such a pit of a little thing and these other preachers were standing around and that made brother Brandon a bit nervous and that's spiritual brother bantam's not coming back to take us all fishing I'm saying this for a reason and then there was another part of that where brother Brandon was was uh lacing a little moccasin a little child's moccasin is that right if I get the details wrong help me but make sure you know it when you do a little moccasin and and it was being laced and and the little thing on the end it was seeming like it was hard to get that that big end of that lace into the moccasin now brother Brandon is not going to come back and lace your baby's moccasins for her it was spiritual you you can't teach algebra to these Pentecostal babies who refuse to learn their ABCs is anybody with me you you get in the flesh you're gonna mess up you try to do it your way you're gonna mess up you try to force something to work and it's not going to work and then he was carried away to the tent vision now I know that they're preaching it right when they talk about the moccasin they say that's spiritual and when they talk about the fishing experience that's spiritual they say then all of a sudden they begin to look for a physical tent God is a god of continuity when he gives an experience like that that comes in three courses one is not going to contradict the other come on now somebody had to think this through and when you do you will understand that that we don't need an airplane and some of you may not be aware of this I think some of you are but there were some brothers who brother Branham spoke to about the airplane and and how we would get around in the tent vision and brother random was not in any way thinking about a time after his death he was hoping he was a man he was hoping that this great tent Ministry was going to be the climax of his ministry before he died and so he said to somebody just stay with me that this may be may not be for you but you're not all there is somebody may need to hear something like this and and so uh he said to one you know you can drive the truck well maybe because I know I know a multitude of men who claim the same thing same come same conversation same truck driving job I don't know how many trucks it was going to take to get this kin around and he said to one you can help me help me on the platform and you could help and because he was a prophet they believed that everything he said was prophetic and so they believe that that these things were going to come to pass and was it what kind of plane was it a was it a DC-3 they bought the plane the plane remains not ready but there in case it needs to be ready the money was put in an account so that the tent could be purchased even after brother Branham died because they got this in their mind if he said it it has to come to pass if he just casually said you can drive my tent my truck you can be a stage you you could do it then it has to come to pass like that so after brother random died they began to try to interpret this Vision that was part one spiritual part two spiritual they took part three and tried to make it natural and they began to preach what they call a return Ministry and I have precious friends who are waiting on the resurrection of brother Branham believing that one day he's coming he is watch yourself he is coming out of the Grave one day so is my grandma saints that have gone before it is not a one-man Resurrection we're looking for we're looking for a bridal Resurrection and in that hour yes the Bride of every age will gather with the messenger of that age absolutely right and we're looking for that but we're not looking for the natural fulfillment of attempt isn't it amazing how we can we can get so off when we try to make something work that's why there are times and seasons in God if you could get a group of people we're about 85 strong this morning with a lot of people missing if you could get a group of 85 people in one mind and one Accord prayed up loving one another like sister Flo was talking about all with their head leaning on the Lord trying to hear what he wants to do in this hour and throwing everything that we have and everything we are behind that to make it happen and when I say make it I don't mean as though we control it I mean so that we're not standing in the way of it how many of you would just say I don't want to be in the way of what God is doing if I can't get behind it I don't want to be in the way prevent it anybody following me so far oh what could you do with 85 people who had their head on the Lord's chest to hear what he wants for his bride in 2023 you know we're about to end the Gregorian year and we're about to launch forth into a new Gregorian year the Year of 2023 and I want you to know for one I for one am very ready come on I'm ready for a new season in God it doesn't always run concurrently with the Gregorian calendar it doesn't always run concurrently with the Hebrew calendar you can have seasons in Christ and God in the spirit that last a day some a week some months some years brother Branham talked about cycles and seasons in his own life where he would get so nervous he could hardly stand it where eventually his stomach would become so diseased that he had to go to visit the Mayo brothers to get some help for his condition and then one day out of the blue God did for him what Mayo couldn't do he just came and healed him he let him see that little squirrel Spirit self on the cactus and Sabino Canyon and that was the end of that never to repeat that cycle again brother Branham talks about cycles of various durations seven years five years ten years 12. we don't know how long a particular season lasts but we need to understand that you as an individual may be on one cycle and the body of Christ at large may be on another cycle and a church family like this may be on another cycle or another season so you've got to learn to live multi-dimensional you've got to learn to live multi-seasonal you've got to learn to be patient for some that are still in the grieving process when you feel like dancing your shoes off you've got to understand that individually we may not all be at the same place spiritually but as a body we have another identity we are identified as individuals but we are also identified as a body of Christ and as a local assembly we like to call it it's a family of Faith that's what it is and it is electric eclectic it is eccentric it's downright strange at times but we've got to learn that we are not robots and neither are we clones I'm preaching to the little church this morning I hope you hear me we're not clones of one another we're going to process life differently than each other and we've got to learn to do it while walking in sync with the body of Christ somebody said I have no hope for that I wouldn't either except I read in the Bible that there were 200 sons of issachar who caught this inspiration to be able to discern what God would be Desiring for Israel at any particular time so there are going to be those who discern for the nation and there will be those who discern as a leader for their own local assemblies brother Branham reminds us the highest spiritual order in any local church is the pastor so if I were you I would pray for my pastors I would pray that God would help them to capture the season for the body then I would pray for myself as an individual that God would help me to keep in staff with what he's doing seasonally because I want you to know as you look to one another a few moments ago and you said change is coming I want to say to you as a pastor I want to prophesy to you as his servant that change is coming the season again is changing spiritually now I don't know where you are individually I'm not I'm not speaking to that right this moment I'm speaking to where we are as a body we're about to go up we're about to climb a notch God dealt with me through the night in dreams and I'm not ready to preach about those dreams but I would like to share one portion of a dream I saw a sister a person that I love and respect and in my in my Exchange in this dream last night I'm not you know I don't want to elevate dreams but I am going on 55 years old and I have been a Visionary to see visions so I have to watch my dreams the Bible said young men see Visions old men dream dreams I have to at least watch them at times and see if there's anything that might help guide us or direct us or lead us and we do that by Discerning how it fits the word in the message of the hour always but I was having interaction with a sister and and really I was observing a conversation just to be honest I wasn't an active part of the conversation and the thing that struck me the most is this is a loving person a giving person a person who has a heart for other people I know that in the natural I know that I have observed that I have watched that don't ask me if you're the person don't ask me if you're the sister but she's here this morning and in the course of this conversation I was struck by how quickly she would throw someone under the bus a loving person a compassionate person a caring person one that I would describe and have described as having a heart for others but in this conversation that I was observing it didn't matter who came up or what situation came up my you're listening this must be so close to gossip that I've got your attention because you're really listening some of you I was observing this sister and how quick it was that no matter what name came up or what situation came up it it meant nothing to her to sell out someone else to blame someone else to make fun of someone else to almost rejoice in their calamity it's so grieved to me the only thing that shook me out of the dream was when the power went off at 4 a.m this morning for just a few seconds and it shook me out of the dream I had a very very hard time going back to sleep after the dream because I was processing it in no way changed my feeling toward this precious sister I love her I honor her she is everything I knew her to be a loving person a generous person a a compassionate person one who really likes to see other people happy but in this situation no matter what name came up or what situation came up I just saw this constant throwing someone else under the bus it's so grieved me because I recognized that this is a part of our present condition as a body a woman represents the church the first person I ever saw Changed by the tent vision was my own mother now many have tried to interpret that as physical but remember I told you part one was spiritual part two was spiritual part three is spiritual the change that took place in her life in the vision that I had was a deep change it was a change that was so profound and so prolific that it affected every part of who she was remember what brother random said about women they represent what the church so I knew in that Vision that my mother though dear to me and precious and believed that she would experience some change in her life I knew that she was representing something bigger than her own physical life are you still with me I'll hurry I will hurry when I get ready to after a while I'm not ready to hurry yet but I will it's coming and so in this dream that I had last night I knew in my heart that this was not only something that this person might struggle with from time to time but but unfortunately it was also a seasonal warning for this church body this morning that we should be willing to throw ourselves under the bus all right yes yes sir before we would throw someone else I'm looking back there at Josh Seiler and I'm thinking about the sacrifice and and Jesse and others who serve in whatever capacity they serve even even police officers and firemen and and and those who serve others what kind of a messed up system would we have if we were putting people in those positions who would rather you burn up than to risk their lives so often these men and women are risking their lives throwing themselves In Harm's Way jumping out of perfectly good airplanes so that they can be ready if the need arises that that the defense of our nation would require such a thing you can't do it on the day it's necessary you've got to prepare and train yourself to be ready for the day that it might be God forbid that it ever be necessary but just in case it is you've got to be ready for it when it comes and so uh you wouldn't want to be and and I won't go into the rest of the the dream before that but but you you want to know just let me say it this way you want to know who you're in the Foxhole with you don't want to be with somebody that would snatch you up by the nip of the neck and and wave your head around here's the target you want somebody who if they saw you getting a little high for the whole Would You Yank you back down and say you big dummy get your head down you're gonna make yourself a Target in the rest of us as well you want to know that you've got somebody who has your back you want to know that you've got somebody that loves and cherishes your life whether they like you or not you don't have to like your buddy you've just got to be committed to help saving his life now there's some mighty bloody movies about war I'm not going to name any of them because I don't want to encourage anybody to go and see it if you're not in a person prepared for what what it means but I'm I'm always amazed one particular movie comes to mind and don't call it out and neither will I but one comes to mind actually two come to mind one I might mean no no no don't do that don't mention either one just give me some water let me have some water let me swallow swallow it before I spit it out two come to mind where it was in their religious makeup their Church background not to fight but they find themselves drafted into a war that they didn't want to be a part of and Sergeant York oops that's the least bloody that's the less bloody of the two made up his mind I'm here I'm going to do my part in defending these people in the other movies that are made like that I'm always impressed by the fact that not only did soldiers do everything they could to keep the other person alive when wounded they didn't want to leave them there on the battlefield they're dragging them they're carrying them they're doing everything they can I knew Dave Reaver I don't know if anyone ever knew Dave Reaver he was Assembly of God preacher I knew him pretty well he was wounded hideously horrendously in the Vietnam War his a phosphorus bomb went off close enough to him that it burnt his body and melted the flesh off of his body and disfigured his face took his hand took his ear burned the whole side of his face off and and he tells the story of laying there in the recovery room and watching wives walk in the recovery room and taking their wedding rings off and laying them on the bed no longer committed to marriage by someone left so disfigured that's not loyalty that's not the kind of wife you want brother you don't wanna you don't want a wife that's only after that because that can all pass away you you want one that's going to love you for the Long Haul and I've heard Dave Reaver talking about it even over coffee with some friends I've heard him talking about the fact that he dreaded the moment But realize that there was something more for his wife and with his wife and she just embraced him without a face without an ear without a hand and he told stories about dragging buddies and friends and helping this this is what the world does this is what the secular Army defending our nation does shouldn't it even be more so [Music] in the body of Christ I'm not going to spend my sermon this morning on that but I want to give you the thought because I'll develop it later and because it's for us it's for us we must rather be ready to take the guilt than to so quickly shovel it off on somebody else it's part of what Christianity is supposed to be it's what the word is supposed to produce in us a love for one another that you would take a bullet for another person in the body of Christ not in your clique foreign not in your comfortable zone of fellowship and we all have them I have a comfortable zone of Fellowship I'm not going to tell you that I don't I need to be around people that don't make me nervous because I live my life as a nervous person because of the gift and I need if I am just relaxing I need to relax with somebody that doesn't press those buttons otherwise I couldn't function when I have to stand up here or when I have to prepare to stand up here surely you understand I'm not talking about the fact that we don't have we have our little families and we have our our I'm not talking about that I'm talking about are you willing to lay it down for somebody who makes you nervous or someone who you find to be so out there that you can hardly listen to what they have to say or someone that you are fighting under a spirit of Suspicion against Sheila pause and think on these things would you be willing to take a bullet would you be willing to shove that person down risking the fact that you might be grossly affected by the crossfire and spiritually it works just like it does in the natural When you pray for someone especially around a altar of Deliverance like this when you pray for someone you might ought to know to be prepared because what they fight you may now be fighting that's why I think you should be careful who you lay your hands on and what kind of authority you claim to take because you may invite something into your life bigger than what you're struggling with on your own and when you do it always do it in his name always lay hands on someone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ always do it as an act of ministry don't ever do it because you want somebody to see you because if you do you're inviting the very war that they're involved in to invade your safe Zone come on now you can take on battles that are not yours to fight illegal mercy and showing this unsanctified Mercy to people and and and and and sometimes we we do things because we don't like controversy and we back off and sometimes we open ourselves up to an internal fight that we don't have to have but I want to move on now but I want to leave you with this I want we have just spent time with our natural families and I want to leave you with this as we move to something else for closing I want you to understand that if we can't get there on our own if we can't get there on our own get to that place where we are busy working not to throw other people In Harm's Way but stand in the way and take a bullet for somebody if we can't get to that place on our own let me just remind you God has a way life has a way with God's help of getting you to a place and that's what I I don't want to say fear but that's what I'm concerned about in this body after coming out of this dream we need to be very careful the words that come out of our mouth not just on the volleyball court not just on the on the on the fellowship launch but standing outside in our fellowship and when we meet in one another's homes we need to be very careful about the words that we speak about one another because God is trying to build an army of people that he can trust because 2023 is going to bring some major changes to us spiritually it's going to bring some major changes to this church and the geography of the church it's going to bring some major changes to our nation the Holy Ghost spoke to us last Sunday that the next two years are going to be unprecedented in many different ways and we want to be prepared for that if the only reason why you're on social media is to make fun of somebody else's life you need another Hobby you know I grew up being made fun I know I know that you all find me to be very normal but believe it or not everyone didn't think I was normal and I grew up being very made fun of in public school and I had two big buck teeth who you did too Jennifer big buck teeth and I looked like my nickname beaver most of the time that did I don't want you to feel sorry for me boy I just love you folks some of you were just oh my pastor was made fun of it gets much worse than that you you don't mind it from everybody but you don't expect it from everybody you expect it from The Jealous Ones you expected from your enemy but you don't expect it from your friends from your brothers and sisters in Christ I wouldn't expect that any of you all would call me beaver and some of you knew me when my when I when I still had some pretty buck teeth I I mean I was a grown man with children before I did anything to my teeth and that's a long story my dad refused to pay for braces my mom couldn't afford it it wasn't covered under insurance and so I grew up with with a very gray teeth also because of a tetracycline stains and I rarely smiled when I was a boy preacher my mom wouldn't let me have a decent haircut because she had an idea of what a haircut was supposed to look like and that was like a bowl right on top of my head and I had bangs that come down there like that and I was kind of ugly I'll just be honest you expect but you don't expect your brothers and sisters in Christ I think we're getting a little too much Liberty with our fun I believe that the Holy Ghost is calling this body to a little more careful treatment of one another the season is changing and it may mean that we have to do some changing with it it never occurred to me uh Jennifer and and Josiah I did get a laugh you you when Jennifer sent me the picture she said I want to give you a good laugh I did get a laugh but I loved it it was I said nobody else that's what I said nobody else nobody else is going to dress up like a pilgrim and an Indian and not only go and surprise their family but go to the coffee shop like that come on now I never I know you wouldn't but they would and they did and I love that they did you understand I love it when I say love I mean it I love that they did because to me it's a statement that says we're quirky I'm quirky did you all take that you didn't take that wrong did you and I'm not ashamed amen I I'm brave and I'm not ashamed well David didn't actually didn't do that what's wrong with y'all you understand this constant comparing ourselves to each other and expecting that we all dance the same way up here or worship the same way raise our hands the same way say Amen the same way come on now there's plenty of room in the body for you to be you and still be gods I I fully stand by the things I said last week some people say they want friends but they go around seeing how many people they can insult foreign to the sister who said to my mom to the young sister who said to my mom one time I think your purse is gaudy I am amazed that you developed such a sweet friendship with my mother because that is not the way you make friends with my mama especially does anybody understand I don't care whether you like it or not she said you don't have any taste anyway but they became sweet friends if you don't know who it was I'm not telling but you wonder sometime when you say things like that someone else comes to my mind who would go up to people and say you're wearing that young people standing up for the church you're wearing that do you think that is a way to bind yourself together as a group of young people we learn to tolerate each other's sense of fashion and we learn to tolerate the fact that some people have none somebody said well brother Branham didn't care about that you know he said I don't care if my you know slacks were striped and my coat is checking well he may not have cared but sister me to cared because I didn't see him looking like that in the pulpit that's right so if you're challenged that way you get as close as you can to somebody that's not but this is not a fashion show this is not a competition this is a body and a family and there's always an uncle and there's always a cousin and there's always somebody that does marches to the beat of Their Own Drum but but we don't cut them out of our natural families neither can we cut them out of our spiritual families if we can learn to love one another and embrace one another and celebrate one another and take a bullet for one another and throw ourselves in front of the bus for somebody else's life to be protected then God has a way he has a way he has a way of teaching us how to respect and honor one another and none of us are going to like it so we all have to take a checkup I've always said that poking is my love language my wife has always spoken up and said it's not mine but when I'm preaching to you I'm also preaching to myself where we need to take an inventory because you look around this room this eclectic eccentric room full of people you might say never mind I won't say it you know the world doesn't even know what to call you someone just recently was asked are you Catholic or Christian at least they knew the difference we often get asked are you Amish or Mennonite somebody asked you if we were part of the pilgrims which by the way is no longer a religious order are you one of those skirt people well I'm not particularly but my wife is we we have enough double stairs I have sisters in this church who tell me by the time they loaded up all their children in the buggy and go to Walmart that they turn every head in the building because we're living in a Society now that has come from 15 children in a family to to uh 2.5 and so if someone's got four children or five children in a buggy going through Walmart they look like the Duggars and the world looks at them that way you've got enough folks you've got enough the world looks at you like you're crazy already we need to stop looking at one another like that you'd be surprised how far love can go in a body like this come on you know that little child that gets on your nerves well some of them are married now and we'll have children of Their Own and you know what made a difference for them a little extra love it doesn't mean that Mama's not doing a good job it doesn't mean that daddy's not doing a good job it simply means that there are certain children with certain personality types that crave love from whoever they can get it from that's why they have to be guarded the most that's why they have to be watched the most in public that's why they can't go to the bathroom by themselves hear me because they're just made that way they're fighting something perhaps dealing with something in their DNA even fighting to overcome something in their life that they don't even understand reaching out for attention and they'll run you slap crazy if you're not used to a child like that but let me encourage you there's a way to fix this pull that child close bring them a snack instead of having this at boy I'm really I know that this is whoa this is right down the nitty-gritty instead of saying I can't feed the whole church like some of you mamas have done try buying it at Sam's try bringing a bigger bag be like April who brought a big old box of ice cream sandwiches from Sam's one of the Sunday afternoons and she immediately became the most popular woman in the church kids that have never even said hi to her before were right up under her weren't they they were just a coming and I I'm a worry wart when it comes to stuff like that and I'm sitting over there thinking oh my she's going to run out and somebody ain't gonna get one and and she's just handing around come on folks you'll never outgive God you give to the household of faith you share with somebody you some of you folks will take your used clothes down and give them the good will before you would take the time to try to find someone in the church that needs some shame on you the Bible said we should be particularly kind to the household of faith if you've got a skirt don't take it the Salvation Army I guarantee you if you've got a skirt somebody in here not me but somebody in here could get it on all right come on we ought to be fighting to take care of one another why are you preaching such a thing as this because there may be a time that we can't run to Dillard's there may be a time that Amazon won't have us coming down the river we better learn unless it don't think you need fellowship with the rest of this body I want you to know you make need us one day somebody said I got my family that's all I want you may find out brother sister that you need this body one day you better practice getting along with us while you can I wish somebody would help me this morning somebody said are you preaching the gospel or just airing the dirty laundry a little bit of both because I heard the Lord amen amen and when he told us to build this church he said I want you to take this as a mandate build stronger families that's what we're trying to do this morning build stronger family do you know when they interview people who are starting to church Across the Nation and they interview them and they say to them why are you coming to church why are have you decided to start coming to church very few of them say I want to give my life to the Lord very few of them say I'm tired of being a sinner and I'm ready to get saved do you know what most of them say I want a community right I'm looking for a place to raise my children with those who have have like ideals and morals I want a community I want a people I want I want to plug in to something that's bigger than I am [Applause] I don't like sports although I did stream a little of the iron bowl full disclosure I did stream a little of the Iron Bowl on my iPad for what I don't know what a waste of time but I'm not a sports fan how in the world I ended up with Benjamin and Joshua in my family if they didn't favor me I would think they came from somebody else not not really that's really not the thing to say on the eve of your 25th wedding anniversary although I have seen my wife run through the house when the UPS truck comes I have and I said to her honey you don't have to meet him at the door it had nothing to do with the delivery person it had everything to do with what was in the box where were we but my boys learned something in their Sports activity that church people can learn they learn what it means to be a team now may they bring some of that to church with them I hope so because we need that in this body we're in this together you know you people that have been transplanted here don't make fun of the way we talk in the south I don't appreciate it because this happens to be where God chose to bring you I don't make fun of brother branham's hates and ain'ts cause at least I know what he meant I listen to people trying to be so educated in their delivery that you don't even know what they're saying the one thing you'll never accuse brother random of being is preaching over the people's heads the Bible said Jesus came and his message was so profound and so simple and so precious that both the religious Scholars and the common prostitute [Music] understood what he meant challenged by his words doing things at the right time I'm back to the word now it's crucial it's 115 give me 15 more minutes he created seasons it's no big prophetic thing to say change is on the way because change is always on the way God is not satisfied leaving us the way we he found us very little stays the same in this life it's not necessarily change that we don't like in fact some of us often cry out to God for change let me see your hand if you find yourself crying out to God for change so it's not change that you fear most of the time it's a dread and a fear of the unknown leaving behind the familiar can stress us not knowing what the next season will look like and how change will affect our lives our families our homes our jobs but I want to tell you in the name of the Lord the season that you are in right now is about to change I'm speaking corporately but if you dare have faith you can change your personal season as well something's coming something we've been waiting on a long time something we've been praying for something that was prophesied a generation ago and you better be ready when it gets here if we can't learn to get along we'll never be prepared for what is ahead we need to quit making excuses for our Lacks and we need to ask for Grace to grow up into what God is calling us to be if you believe that say Amen something powerful is coming and you're going to want to be ready for it when it comes Isaiah 54 17 says no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper you can't feel and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousnesses of me saith the Lord I want my hair I want my heritage I want my inheritance my inheritance is to live a life so that no weapon formed against me can prosper and every tongue that rises to condemn me in judgment God himself will condemn that's my Heritage that's my inheritance that's my promise I don't need to spend time worrying about what they're saying out there about me or you you need to worry about whether or not you're walking in the righteousness of the Lord it doesn't matter what you've been fighting against you have authority in the name of Jesus Christ to cause that thing to fall it doesn't matter who's been saying what God desires to come to your defense in this next season how many of you are ready for the Lord to stand up for you then you must be ready today to stand up for him God said every tongue that rises against you I will condemn it as a body we're about to go through another season of Change A change is coming and yet A Change Is Here something you're trying to do before but couldn't do in your own power something that you've been racking your brain over something that you've been praying about a wall that you couldn't get over in the past a situation that you've not been able to change no matter how hard you have tried the problem that just won't go away the impossibility that has held back the potential in your life and your walk with God it's about to become possible if you will step up and take what's yours the impossibility it's a new season and if you'll embrace it even celebrate it you'll see the victory of your Victor you'll see the victory of your Victor isn't it about time you find yourself in the season that God wants you to be in how many of you are tired of running late I'm going to break this down for some of us maybe you've been trying to get a suntan in the midst of winter maybe you've been trying to shovel snow in the middle of the summer then you're in the wrong season anybody hear a man you've been working too hard at something that wasn't in God's timing maybe you're doing the right labor but in the wrong season there is a time to plant there's a time to pluck up what is planted if you're plucking up in a season of planting you're not in God's proper season if you're trying to plant when it's harvest time you're not going to produce anything because winter is going to steal your Harvest from you if you're busy digging in the dirt when it's time to pick the fruit of your Harvest you're going to miss out on a tremendous blessing in your life you must stay in step with the Holy Ghost you must stay in step with the word you must stay in step with the spirit the spirit will keep you in the right season of the Lord no wonder we get discouraged when we're working so hard but we see such little result if you are doing all you know to do and you are seeing no fruit there is a reason for that you need to now ask yourself am I doing all the right things but in the wrong season because if you'll just wait for the season to change and go right back into doing all the right things that you know to do in the right season God will give you the Harvest that you're after don't quit paying your tithe because you're because you're having a little bit of a struggle waiting for a more convenient time to pay your tithe look folks I don't say that much about paying cards so don't you get all twisted up in here the Bible said if you don't pay your tithe you're a thief and a robber if you think God's going to bless a thief and a robber you've missed the whole interpretation of the word the whole Bible tells us God's about honesty and integrity and if you're one of those who says I can't afford to pay my tithe you don't even understand the concept of sowing and reaping because the real truth is you can't afford not to I'm gonna pay my tithe if the light bill isn't paid that's me that's me I'm not telling you to do it because I have learned that if I prove God and put God to the test he will always somebody said I'm just going to keep back this little portion this month because I'm having a hard time I wouldn't do I don't know who I'm preaching to because I don't preach this often but I wouldn't do it if I were you come on I'd find a way to round mine up instead of rounding it down I'd find a way to give God more than what he required I do what brother Branham told us to do don't just pay your tithe and think you've done God a service you put an offering in there it doesn't have to be a big one you put a little fat on top of that and say now Lord I've given you what belongs to you and I'm sharing with you what was mine and I'm asking you to perform your word in my life well I've been doing that and I hadn't been seeing the Harvest keep doing it because there are certain things that you don't have to wait on a season to do because any time is the right time to praise the Lord anytime is the right time to give God what belongs to him anybody with me you've been doing everything you know to do but in the wrong season perhaps and God is about to bring your life into alignment with the season that he wants you to be in are you ready for change I don't really like change but we need to know that change comes and Seasons come and go whether we want them or not I won't change I want God to help me change some things about me let me say that again I want God to help me change some things about me did you notice I didn't say what church says Church says I want God to change some things in me that's not what I said I said I want God to help me change some things about me do you understand that's how it works I know God has moved like this for some people but God's not obligated to move like this for some people when they say things like this now Lord I want you to take this desire for alcohol away I know God has moved for some people like that but not too many that I know of because that's not how God's obligated himself in the word he didn't give you the desire for that that didn't come from God that came from your own ugly associations that came from your own Rebellion that came from your own choices my old granny used to say it's not the it's not the first pint that makes an alcoholic it's a first drop you make up your mind I'm staying away from that because I've never seen anything good I don't know who I'm talking to me maybe somebody out there but I've never seen any good come out of that you need a buzz to get down on the floor and play with your children that'll buzz you okay find you something in life that you can get some enjoyment out of and run to that well I don't think smoking is all that bad and vaping and I read an article this week that came up in my feed that says these people who are trading their cigarettes for Vapes thinking that they're doing something more healthy or actually doing something worse because they're causing more damage to their lungs one of the chemicals in the in the Vape is something that you can swallow in it do you no harm but inhaling it in your lungs destroys your lungs so your body design if you were drinking it to let that chemical go right through you but it was not your your lungs were not created to inhale that into your lung you all do understand that what you inhale in your lungs what you inhale goes to your lungs and you've got to have your lungs anybody in here know you got to have your lungs somebody said that don't matter and you know I grew up with a Baptist granny that dipped snuff snuff filthy filthy I don't know how many times I kicked her spit can over her lady if you'd have seen her you would have thought she was a real lady always presented herself that way but when she was young she got a hold of that and it got a hold of her and she'd Slide the spit cup up under the edge of the chair or the edge of the couch because she certainly didn't want anybody to know and as a kid I don't know how many times I didn't see it and kicked it over and then they made me clean it up that old thick black looking syrup that runs out of that stuff and people putting chewing tobacco in their mouth caused this tongue cancer and cheek cancer and all kinds of things like that and it used to be popular to go around with a with a round circle my kids come along and first time I saw them with one of them round uh uh uh bubble gum things in the back of their I said get that out of your pocket well it's bubble gum I don't care what it is people used to love boys I went to school with they used to love to have that round worn out circle on the back of their pocket where they took their skull can around filthy mess and people come along and say those things don't matter I read this week where brother Branham said your habits are unclean spirits and you'll not get by God with them somebody said are you condemning us not at all oh I'm telling you you're living below who you were created to be you don't have to have to live yourself to that stuff you don't have to it doesn't have to own you you can own it maybe you're not praying the right way maybe you're praying on God to take the desire for it from you and you need to be praying God help me to learn how to change my life so that I don't yield to all of these things you know the answer for some people is quit staying by yourself all the time amen get where there's people I can get really nitty-gritty if you need me to there's just a certain struggle that that people have in life they don't need to be alone they don't need to be where they can get their phone off by their self anybody with me you're not going to sit down in front of your family and watch filth oh you wait until you're off somewhere people spending inordinate amount of time in the potty because they're so addicted to the filth on their phone and they don't want to do it get out of there get in there you're really going to tell us how to go to the bathroom I am in the opportunity to talk to you ask God to give you the grace that you need to change would you think that people come here to church and catch up on the social media in the bathroom what is wrong with folk they're not ready for the season they're in right now they're certainly not ready for the next season that's coming musicians are coming foreign God wants to help us God will help you when you can't art when you absolutely cannot help yourself but what God wants to do is strengthen you so that you can make a difference in your own desires in your own life I'm not going to miss out on my family for a habit I'm not going to miss out on my grandchildren for a habit I don't have any now but I will I'm not going to I'm not going to let my life be so controlled that I miss out because when you get to where I am in life and you start 25 years folks I don't want to wax sentimental but it's like any of you remember being in the in the hospital there were 50 people from this church in the hospital waiting room when Benjamin was born one year after my wife and I married and it seems like it was yesterday 25 years ago tomorrow brother Daryl fecto and brother Andrews larti and brother Wesley Greeley we're standing there in the old church in Columbus my wife and I were exchanging our vows and it felt like life was beginning in 25 years have come and gone so quickly we didn't marry early in life we married a little bit later in life and I am not insisting that that is the way it has to be but I will tell you this what you're looking for as for a companion in life certainly changes as you mature and all you can do a lot of us all we can do is say thank God he didn't give me what I wanted at the time he let me grow until my desires and my thoughts and my what I was looking for begin to change in life because all I really wanted many things we could talk about I wanted in a companion but all I really wanted was somebody that would love me and stay with me through thick and thin who would love God but I was looking for somebody that was in it for the Long Haul the things that that I thought were so important you know I had my list I don't know why somebody that looks like me ought not to be so picky and I'd like to tell some of you folks the same thing everybody thinks we're all such a prize so we get so picky and then life passes Us by I have a friend up the road there who's sick in his 60s uh in Ohio I'll say that so no one misunderstands and he had such a list I just had to tell him one day I said look you better just ask God to give you anybody yes to anybody that God will give you'll be good I know you're just mad at me for saying so but it's right he said I want a piano player I did too I want to piano player my wife can barely run the radio she can do most anything she wants to do but she has got a fancy stereo on her car that she still does not have set up right I've been riding with her lately she don't even have her phone synced in good right with her car and I was trying to help her and I'm about as challenged as anybody I wanted a piano player and I wanted to say this brother you know what this brother told me he said I don't want a wife that's ever played any kind of sports I said well what's that got to do with the prosity in China he said and I don't want a woman that's ever wore a t-shirt because he had strong convictions about women women wearing t-shirts and I he's still alone and bald-headed and can somebody tell me what that's got to do with the Long Haul you better say God give me the person that he wants me to have I tell you Josiah you you're you and you and Jennifer blessed I don't know if he was praying Lord give me somebody that'll wear an Indian costume on Thanksgiving but he did it Lord of Mercy yo here brother Jerry Lord of Mercy Lord of Mercy we shouldn't get so worked up but when you do get one you better know this she's yours for life if you've got any questions to ask you better ask them before you say I do because you folks that have come back later around this message have come back later and said I didn't know so that you could put your wives away and marry another I don't have to tell you what brother Brandon said I'll tell you what the Bible said it was not so from the beginning it's not that hard to get it right if you put it in God's hands let's do that it's not so hard to love one another and fight for one another if you put it in God's hands let's stand he will help us boy this is something else this this will go down we better strike this from all the records and we better just pretend as though this Sunday was for us and nobody else wasn't because I didn't have anything good to say I just must have not got to it and now they're preaching from the pews foreign that's what it's about see it's all right in the laughing at each other in the right spirit but not in the wrong spirit I want us to let one another know I'm fighting for you not against you I want you here I want to say this I want you here I want you here there's nobody here that I want to run off I want you here maybe you've got a bump or two well you'll fit right in I I believe God is sent the ones that are worshiping with us right now I believe God is symptom I hope it's forever I hope it's till Rapture time but if it's not it's not but I hope it's till Rapture time I'm willing are you willing are you willing to embrace one another in all of our differences idiosyncrasies are you willing to let Love cover a multitude of sin how many of you are willing are you willing to make personal preparation for the seasonal change that's taking place in the spirit are you willing to pray for one another that God will strengthen each and every one of us to make some changes in our life to be what God has called us to be are you ready to be serious this isn't a social hour is it this is life or death for me and for many of the others who are here I feel so blessed I feel so blessed to be a part of this body I feel so blessed to worship with you people like sister Flo said I feel so blessed to fight in this war with you and I know that what God has got for us is greater than anything we have yet experienced if we can hold one another we must hold on to one another you've got a song to lead us in worship let's Worship the Lord before we go I didn't stop as early as I intended to but let's worship for a few moments you got any songs that can pull all the scattered preaching together and and let it end with a good thing you are not a god created come on let's worship you are not a god dependent on any mortal man you are not a God right anything we can give yes by your plan that's just the way it is oh and you are not a God created by human hands you're not a god depend on any mortal man Hallelujah anything we can give by your plan that's just the way it is You Are God Alone and Before Time begins [Music] should heal Jesus [Music] yes you are yes you are the only God who's power and none can contend you're the only God whose name and race

matter what the season looks like God is on the throne how many of you know that you know that doesn't matter what it feels like you know that God is on the throne and he's not come down because of a little hard problem oh no he reigns above it all I want the Saints just lift your hands brothers and sisters just lift your hands to the Lord right now Father Here We Stand we are your children we we know the only righteousness we have is from you the only thing good about us is you the only thing near perfect about us is you so Lord we Just Surrender right now to all that you desire for us in this hour we need some changes Lord and there are certain things that we can't execute ourselves we can only yield to you but we ask you Lord to come and give us strength to make right choices to choose what is right over what is wrong to choose what is Holy instead of that which is profane and will defile my God we thank you right now for victory it's not a feeling it is a faith reality and we claim that right now Lord I ask you to touch every mind I sense right now that the Mind battle is Raging but Jesus Is the Victor so we take authority over the Mind battle right now and we ask that every child of God find faith to settle that issue and to say I am who God has called me to be I am who God has created me to be in all of my Hang-Ups I'm surrendering to The Sovereign Grace of the Living God surrender I feel like the Lord is calling somebody Just Surrender just say I will will you tell him well I better know what it's about no no no if you tell God I will he'll help you through it whatever it is would you tell him right now I will Lord I will I will surrender in whatever way you're calling me to surrender I will give you anything you ask for with your help with your strength

strength is thank you Holy Ghost thank you for strength right now thank you for healing right now whoop don't you miss your moment don't you miss your moment Lord I would ask right now because of some

stepping stones but never stumbling blocks Lord I ask right now for the grace that you would watch over my words that you would watch over even my fun that you would watch over me right now that I would not be a stumbling block to your children but I would be a help and a strength and bring courage to those who love you and fear you and who serve you would you pray that prayer with me Lord help me not to be a stumbling block let my life and my behavior and my testimony not be a stumbling block let the words that come out of my mouth the Deeds that I do the way I treat my brother and sister
