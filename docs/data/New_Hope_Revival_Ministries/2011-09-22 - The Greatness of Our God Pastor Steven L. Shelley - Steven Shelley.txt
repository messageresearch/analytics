TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but I said there are multiple universes out there no one has reached the great beyond no one knows the end of this universe but God nobody knows how far it goes and expands I tell you we serve a great God I tell you we think he stays busy just keeping this little thing in orbit and take I tell you he's got more to take care of out there in the expanses of the of time and existence that we don't know anything about and he's capable of doing all of it and he never has to tie a string on his finger to remember what he's supposed to do next Hallelujah and he never has to set an alarm on his iPhone to remember to spin the Earth again that's the God we serve he doesn't have to remember to recharge gravity Hallelujah because when he created it it did what he told it to do and it always has and it always will and if a God is busy enough and yet capable enough of running that I guarantee you he's capable of healing your body when you're sick and cheering you up when you're sad and protecting your children when they're out from under your roof Hallelujah let's give God praise come hallelujah praise God I believe I'll serve that God I believe I'll live my life for that God I believe I'll lay down everything I have for that God hallelujah Lord
