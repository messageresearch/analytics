TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of New Hope Revival ministries I want to share a couple things with you today about the power of our thoughts and the effect that they have on our entire body not just our spiritual life but also they can have a profound effect on our physical health we're we're working on a theme that the Lord dealt with me about last year and that was to become a better reflection of the message that we carry the revelation of Jesus Christ there's a scripture that is translated in in one translation that we would have soul Harmony that we would be in Harmony in our soul that's our mind our will and emotions did you know that if you keep thinking a a toxic thought a negative thought over and over again it is pushed farther and farther into the deeper recesses of your long-term memory until it actually becomes a part of who you are it becomes a part of your non-conscious brain and it's what you think about yourself even though it is probably if it's negative it's certainly not the truth because you're now a new creature in Jesus Christ and those thoughts can easily become strongholds that have to be brought down in the power and authority of the blood of Jesus Christ there's a scripture in the Bible in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse three that talks about we're Waring we though we walk in the flesh we're not Waring In the Flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds in the complete Jewish Bible it says this because the weapons we use to wage war are not worldly on the contrary they have God's power for demolishing strongholds we demolish arguments and every arrogance that raises itself up against the knowledge of God that means that with the weapons that we have the word of God the blood of Jesus Christ the precious name of Jesus Yeshua our Messiah what more could we ask for these weapons are powerful enough to demolish strongholds of bad thinking tox accusations that you're wiring into your brain in fact the scripture says that we can demolish arguments because sometimes that's what thoughts are arguments between Satan's accusations our puny defense of ourselves because uh against the enemy on our own we're not a match it's only because of who lives in us that we have authority to demolish his arguments and it says that we should have authority in King James it says casting down every imagination here it says every arrogance that raises itself up against the knowledge of God so I want you to know you have power and authority to demolish arguments strongholds that Satan has been telling you over and over and over again now is the time you have the grace being extended to the body of Christ in this hour to have our minds completely renewed and by the renewing of our minds our brain actually follows our thoughts so if we think better thoughts more Godly thoughts hiding the word of God in our heart our brain will follow in fact the chemicals that are released in our body when we operate under stress can be so detrimental in the long term but the chemicals that that we release in the body our brain releases in the body when we think on God's thoughts God's word when we think on those things the chemicals that are released bring health and healing to our entire body I want to walk in wholeness and in Soul Harmony and I know you do too and it's possible by meditating on the word of God Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee Oh God and when we believe the devil's lies we're sinning against God's word we're arguing with what God has said we are and let me tell you something I was junk but not to God and when he filled me with the Holy Ghost when Jesus came to live in my heart I'm telling you he made me what I am and God doesn't make junk does he and I know it sounds so simple but it's true practice it today practice confessing God's promises over your life and practice pulling down those strongholds and accusations that Satan throws your way God bless you I'll see you again [Music] I
