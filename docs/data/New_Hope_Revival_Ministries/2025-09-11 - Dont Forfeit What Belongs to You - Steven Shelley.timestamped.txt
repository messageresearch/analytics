[0:00] your spiritual inheritance,
[0:03] &gt;&gt; you'll eat it.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; If you be
[0:08] &gt;&gt; willing
[0:09] &gt;&gt; and obedient, I know we know this, but
[0:11] if you be willing
[0:14] and obedient,
[0:16] &gt;&gt; both
[0:17] &gt;&gt; conjunction and willing and willing and
[0:22] obedient. Ye shall eat the good of the
[0:26] promise,
[0:27] &gt;&gt; the good of the land. You will eat it
[0:31] because you have occupied it.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; You will occupy your promise. You will
[0:36] live in and on your promise if you be
[0:40] willing and obedient.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; You shall be the beneficiary
[0:47] &gt;&gt; of the promise.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[0:50] Not only will you possess, you will have
[0:53] strength, power, and authority to
[0:55] dispossess
[0:57] &gt;&gt; what is squatting
[1:00] &gt;&gt; on your inheritance.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; The devil refuses to budge many times
[1:07] until you address him with the authority
[1:11] that's given to you as a part. You're a
[1:14] part of God. You're a part of the very
[1:18] creator, the very one who created him.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; And when you use bridal authority, the
[1:25] authority of an adopted son, a fully
[1:28] adopted son, a whos, not a tetanon, not
[1:32] a toddler,
[1:33] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; But a man,
[1:36] &gt;&gt; when I became a man, I put away
[1:39] &gt;&gt; childish things. I want to tell you as
[1:41] your pastor this morning, it's well past
[1:45] the time
[1:47] &gt;&gt; for us to put away childish things.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus was such that he
[1:57] said about his own ministry, I can do
[2:00] nothing
[2:02] &gt;&gt; except it's revealed to me
[2:04] &gt;&gt; of my father.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make a trinity.
[2:09] Come on.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; It puts a body on an eternal spirit.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Now he's got a body.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Not just a theophony, but now he has a
[2:21] body. He's not just a rainbow. He's not
[2:24] just a pillar of fire.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; He He has a body.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I can't do anything of
[2:31] my own. I must do what I see him, what I
[2:35] hear from him, what is revealed to me
[2:37] from him." that's what I must do. And uh
[2:40] you might understand that because he's
[2:43] he's telling us in a in a slight
[2:45] paraphrase here, he's telling us it's by
[2:47] vision.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; And as long as he was willing
[2:54] and obedient,
[2:57] &gt;&gt; the the vision was fulfilled.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Well, if we're becoming one with him,
[3:02] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; It may not be a picture that flashes. It
[3:06] may just be a knowing that breaks forth
[3:09] in your heart
[3:11] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Yeah, this is the one I
[3:13] want to invest in."
[3:15] &gt;&gt; We got to be led in this hour. Lots of
[3:18] wisdom,
[3:19] &gt;&gt; uh, lots of maturity.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; That means some of us are going to have
[3:23] to have great change.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You'll learn
[3:28] eventually, but it better be quick
[3:31] because you're being called on to be
[3:34] willing
[3:35] &gt;&gt; and obedient. If if there's any tone, if
[3:38] you sense a tone in me this morning that
[3:40] would make you think that I am uh not uh
[3:43] legitimizing, I am legitimizing all of
[3:47] your anxiety and your stress and your
[3:51] heartache and your burden and your
[3:54] emotion and your depression and your
[3:56] heaviness. It's so it's real. It's not a
[4:00] fantasy.
[4:04] But what I can't do
[4:06] &gt;&gt; is celebrate it.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; You don't need somebody else to
[4:13] celebrate it.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; You need somebody else to show you how
[4:18] to get out of it.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; This is the road map out.
[4:24] [Applause]
[4:25] &gt;&gt; You'll stay there as long as you're
[4:27] trying to figure out how to change
[4:29] people around you.
[4:31] You'll stay depressed.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; You'll stay in that. But once you make
[4:36] up your mind, I don't care. I can't
[4:38] help. I can't help that. I can't help
[4:40] that. I can't do that. I don't know how
[4:42] to fix that. But I've got to get myself
[4:45] up out of the valley of despair. I've
[4:48] got to pull myself up.
[4:52] There's a king in my castle
[4:56] &gt;&gt; who says it's time to rule and reign
[5:01] with authority in your life.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to forfeit anything that
[5:11] belongs to me.
