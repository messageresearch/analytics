and I from a wonderful convention in Nakuru Kenya Africa where God is moving I mean to tell you we saw some wonderful things taking place and there was one night when the atmosphere of the Lord was so strong and miracles were announced and not only were they being announced but they were being received and we have continued to receive testimonies of lives that were touched and bodies that were healed and all of this just continues to confirm for us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and we want to stay connected with you and that's why we make all of these

the first one then go to youtube and you can watch it on your computer or on your handheld device and iPad or a smartphone or whatever you have and I think you'll enjoy following the progress of what of what we're trying to lay out for you today is episode 4 and I want to start again by reading what I would call the foundational scripture for this series and the the portion of Scripture where we took the title it is Galatians chapter 4 and the first seven verses and I'm going to read them again because I just like to lay that foundation each time we meet together now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father see there's that process of growing of learning and of maturing even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come when everything let me just say when everything was in order everything was lined up in God's blueprint in his beautiful design God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father that is the witness we have because we are the sons of God we have the Spirit of the Son of God the Holy Spirit in our lives and that witnesses to our relationship with the father and so we can cry Papa you know we approach him and we want to set his name apart and we want to hallow his name and and we want him to know that we recognize his deity and his sovereignty but I want you to know there are times in our life when we just need our daddy we just need a Papa and that's what the scripture is saying as we grow in maturity there's a witness that comes in our spirit where when we need to we can just cry Papa Abba Father and he hears us wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ what a beautiful work the Holy Spirit of God is accomplishing in the life of the believer now in this series we have been laying out for you that the great designer the Great Architect of the ages had a blueprint in his mind a pattern a plan from before the foundation of the world and although this plan of redemption was in his mind in fact we read that the lamb was slain we read in Revelation 13 and eight last time we were together that the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world all of this took place in the mind and in the thoughts of God it was some four thousand years later that that first messianic prophecy that was given it was spoken to the serpent but it was a word for Adam to hold on to and I'm going to read that again because that's where we're going to move forward from today but it was four thousand years after this first initial promise of a messiah of a savior to come that it actually happened that the word actually became flesh and it could not happen one minute early or one minute late everything had to be according to God's plan and design I believe the Great Creator was watching carefully over the earth to see every detail falling into place and in that moment the Word of God stepped out of eternity into a body of flesh formed in the womb of a little virgin maiden and we're going to talk about that in this program today before we do that let's read Genesis three 14 and 15 often referred to in theology as the first messianic prophecy of recorded in the scripture verse 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life verse 15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is a promise of God sending an answer to the problem of sin God sending a remedy for what had just taken place in the Garden of Eden and God specifically said this answer this remedy this provided way would come through the seed of a woman and even though this seed of the serpent that representation of evil would be able to bruise the heel of this Promised One and we believe that's the death of the cross but ultimately the final bruise would be the crushing of that evil underneath the heel of this promised seed of a woman indeed he was the seed of God but he came in an unusual and unprecedented way a new thing was accomplished in the earth as the Scriptures teach us and we're going to look at some of those scriptures in a moment it's important to remember that the answer for the sin problem on planet earth could only come through a sinless son of man full atonement could not be made in any other way than one who was completely perfect and sinless and in order for us to know that that was the promise we have this beautiful system given designed by God in the older covenant in the Old Testament to show us the importance of the offering and the sacrifice being whole being without blemish the worshiper was coming broken with trespasses with sins with with shortcomings but the offering that he brought had to be a perfect offering without any malady without any shortcoming it had to be to the full measure of perfection that was available and this is a beautiful type for you and I because when we come to the Lord we know that we are unworthy but remember we're not coming in our worthiness we're not coming to God to worship under the pretense that we are sinless or perfect or that we should be received because of our own works or deeds or perfection but we can come to him boldly even though we feel like we have fallen short many many times we can come to him boldly and with sincerity because we're bringing a perfect lamb we're bringing the offering the sacrifice of the blood of the spotless Lamb of God the one that john said was slain before the foundation of the world so you and I may not be worthy in our fallen condition but thanks be to God my lamb is worthy my offering is worthy I come by the blood of the sinless Lamb of God in Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 22 in the amplified version of the Bible it reads in fact under the law almost everything is purified by means of blood and without the shedding of blood there is neither release from sin and it's guilt nor the remission of the do and merited punishment for sins the scripture is clear both New Testament and Old Testament that the the remission of sin and the covering the atonement for sin could only be accomplished by the shedding of blood and this is important to notice because from the beginning God was speaking of this in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 21 Eve has listened to the serpent she has yielded herself to his seduction she has opened up a new world in her own mind Adam the Bible tells us in the New Testament was not deceived when he saw what Eve had done he also / to cover the sin as a mediator the scripture is clear as a covering for for Eve because of his great love for her so though Adam in that moment was innocent until he partook he knew what he was doing he was not deceived the scripture said he was becoming a type of the last Adam our Lord Jesus Christ Oh My look at Redemption that scarlet thread of redemption that runs through Genesis all the way through the book of Revelation and in indeed indeed it runs throughout all eternity but in Genesis 3:21 the fall has taken place and Adam and Eve have tried to cover their sin and this is a problem that started in the Garden of Eden and continues to this day man's desire to hide himself and so they sewed together somehow fig leaves from off the fig tree and they covered their their private parts and they went on about their their way and as God was coming down in the cool of the day prior to this every day to have fellowship with Adam in the cool of the evening the Bible said here comes God and he's calling to Adam because Adam is not in his usual meeting place why because Adam and Eve are hiding in the bushes somewhere even though they've covered themselves with fig leaves they are very much aware of their nakedness they were naked from the beginning of course they had the covering of the light and the glory of God they had never looked at themselves with any shame or feeling any any guilt for not being covered the glory of God was there covering and they were not aware that beneath that covering they were indeed naked but with the fall things so drastically changed they are now naked and they are ashamed of their condition and even though they have covered themselves with fig leaves they're hiding from the voice of God they heard the voice of God walking in the garden and crying out Adam where are you where art thou and you know the story very well Adam and Eve were hiding because they were ashamed of their condition and they were sure that God had come to judge them that God had perhaps even come to destroy them but folks I want to tell you something this is a religious image of God this is not understanding the true nature of the Living God I want you to know that he was not indeed coming to judge them or to destroy them in every way God was coming to protect them it's true that because of their sin they could no longer live in the Garden of Eden but this was for their protection because the way to the tree of life had to be guarded if if there was any taking of the Tree of Life and and experiencing experimenting with eternal life in an illegal way without the death the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ this could have been a terrible situation in the garden and so from the time of the fall Adam and Eve had to be expelled from the garden and we know that there was a flaming sword and cherubim were placed at the entrance guarding the way to the Tree of Life making sure that no one would access eternal life by the tree in any other way then through the death the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ which wouldn't take place it had happened in the mind of God but it would not happen in actuality in reality in the earth realm for another four thousand years God had come to protect them in fact he had come to cover them not to expose their nakedness not to shame them for what had happened in the garden remember after all this didn't catch God by surprise no sir I know that church is sort of teach this I've been in services where people were teaching that you know here this happens God created Adam and Eve perfect and whole and and this is how it was supposed to be forever and and Here Come Satan and he entered into the serpent and he he spoiled God's plan and now God had to find a way of bringing it but I want you to know nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing has ever caught God by surprise we have well established in our last three sessions together the the sovereignty the all knowingness of God how he knew from the beginning all of his works he not only knew what you and I were gonna do from the beginning he knew what he was going to do everything that God was going to do in the earth was already determined before he ever started this whole creation or recreation process that we read about in in Genesis and so it's important to know that God was coming not to destroy but to cover in Genesis 3:21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin what did Adam and Eve do they did the best they could think of they put fig leaves together to make themselves some clothes and God said this is not a proper covering for your nakedness just leaves off the tree there will be listen now there will be a provided way to cover nakedness and shame there will be a provided way to cover the sinfulness of man and it won't be by fig leaves it won't be by botany the shedding of a botany life you know the taking of botany life plucking these leaves off the tree but rather the covering would be made by the shedding of blood this was God's plan from the beginning not just because of all the lambs that would be sacrificed in the tabernacle and later in the temple but ultimately it was pointing even farther than that it was planning to a hill outside the city of Jerusalem where our Lord Jesus Christ would suffer without the camp and who would ultimately shed the blood of God the blood created by God for the plan of redemption and so we read here in Genesis 3:21 that God had a better idea than Adam Adam his idea Eve's idea figleaves God said I've got a better plan now I just want you to know that that's a lesson that you can you can hold on to no matter what your idea is to get yourself out of a mess God has a better plan he thinks higher than we do his thoughts toward us are right and if we will just take the time to discover what does God think what is God's will in this situation how can I get out of this mess that I've gotten myself into Lord show me the way and the way is outlined the way is outlined in the written record of God's Word the holy scripture the Bible it's there we just have to wait patiently some time to discover that way so you can put your your fig leaves away you know that to me that is a type of religion it's a type of man trying to fix himself you can't do all of this through self-help I believe I believe that there are a lot of things that we can do for ourselves and there are changes that we can make in our life by the way we think by changing our thoughts by what we confess by what we speak by what we declare by what we prophesy but I want you to know that all the self-help advice you can read and listen to and all the seminars you can attend they can help you in many ways but I want you to know that real help real wholeness real completeness and true Redemption can only come by discovering God's way out how would you lord have me to manuever how what what road should I take down and and maybe I can't undo or reverse everything that I have done wrong but show me how to get the most redemption for the mess for the sin for the mistakes that I have made and the god I serve is faithful and he will help you in that manner if you'll trust him and here God was showing Adam I got a plan okay your little fig leaves that just didn't get it done but I've got a plan and unto Adam also into his wife did the Lord God make cotan God God became a tailor made coats of skins and clothed them so no doubt in my mind God took some small fluffy furry animal most likely a lamb and in order for those coats of skin to be made a lamb had to die remember this was before Abel killed his lamb this was before the tabernacle system and the offering and sacrificial system of the tabernacle this was before the worship and the offering and the sacrifices of the tabernacle and the temple so this was God pointing to all of that and to the cross he made for them coats of skin and clothed them covered the shame of their nakedness and did it by the shedding of blood I don't believe that there was a way then that he just peeled those skins off of the animals and they continued to live they had to give their life and they had to shed their blood and God was prophesying in Genesis to all of us that it's by the shedding of blood like we just read in Hebrews 9:22 that true salvation comes now Genesis 3 14 and 15 that we read earlier it says the seed of the woman this is an interesting word the seed of the woman because the word in Hebrew is zero and it means seed our fruit are sometimes posterity and I want you to notice that since the promised one would be the seed of a woman something different from the natural order would have to take place since we know from from science from the scripture that normally the seed comes from the man now this is something that we are familiar with but sometimes we look at this word seed of the woman and we just think well it's metaphoric but I want you to know it's a little more holy it's a little more precious it's a little richer in its meaning than just metaphorically the seed of a woman because when we look at Genesis 3 15 through 14 and 15 the word seed that's used for both the Serpent's offspring and the woman's offspring it's the same Hebrew word that we just mentioned and it can be used in the Bible for different ways but one of the most common ways that it is used the number one most common way is as semen which is the fluid that is provided by the man and it is from this fluid that the conception the fertilization of the egg that is provided by the woman takes place it can't take place without the seed of the man it also is a word that can be used in in the sense of agriculture as in sowing seed it also is sometimes means that which is scattered or as the product of what is sown just like we mentioned and it's also used as offspring for instance in the promised line of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that word seed appears so in order for the woman's seed to crush Satan's hair something other than the natural order of Concepcion would have to take place something other than the natural order of producing offspring would have to take place so I want you to know what God did he was creating from the beginning a new way he was producing creating a new thing and this is really the understanding and interpretation we get from scriptures like Jeremiah 31 22 let's look at that for just a moment how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for the Lord have created a new thing in the earth a woman shall come pass a man now this is an interesting prophetic utterance from the Prophet Jeremiah how long are you going to go backsliding o daughter for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall come pass a man I've heard all kinds of different explanations for this verse of scripture but let's look at the verse for just a moment it says the Lord hath created a new thing when we look at that Hebrew word for for create it's bara and it means to shape to form something only a creator can do to bring into existence that which did not previously exist so the word meaning is giving us this understanding the LORD hath brought something into existence that did not previously exist he has created a new thing in the earth when we look at that phrase a new thing it comes from a Hebrew word Kadosh and it's an adjective describing something fresh our new s in something that has never happened before and then we look at that word compass' and it means to encompass to surround to enclose to envelop to circle it's a verb of motion and and it means to make a change and so when we look at that word in in relationship with the other words it lets us know this is a prophetic scripture God is creating a new thing he is circling and enveloping a plan that has never happened in the earth because now a woman is going to come pass she's going to circle and envelop the man she's going to provide the envelope for the man interesting she's going to be the package for the man to come in like a box for a gift to be placed in it's really the Hebrew language can be so beautiful and this word for man here is a warrior a strong man emphasizing strength or ability and this is used 66 different times in the Bible referring to a higher order of mankind and certainly the Lord Jesus Christ would be that this new thing is a virgin woman conceiving a man's a man-child without receiving the semen or the seed of a man this is so interesting we just say the Virgin Mary we all know what the scripture said in Luke chapter 1 that she would be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost but it is so unusual for for the expression to be used the seed of the woman it should be the seed of a man but this time God said I'm going to let the woman encompass the man and I'm going to do an in the earth that's never been done before a virgin is going to conceive the seed would be the unique son of God never happened the only begotten Son of God Adam was a created son and he was fresh from the fingertips and from the spoken word of God but Jesus Yeshua our Messiah he came in a different way altogether this seed that the woman would carry would be the unique son of God no contribution from a mortal man no semen from from the physical loins of a man not Joseph or any other man Joseph being the husband that she was espoused to but no man would provide the seed the semen it would be from the seed of a woman how did she get this seed is it referring to an egg an egg is not a seed because it cannot provide the conception for life an egg receives the seed and that's when conception takes place why are you taking our time because I want you to know that this is the most beautiful thing when we really take a moment to look at it so what this tells us is that that Mary would be almost like an incubator now I don't want you to take that in a wrong way it means that in order for Mary to bring forth the seed of God the seed of a man not knowing a man that even God would have to place inside Mary a special egg a very unusual thing would take place even the egg would be delivered to the woman by the hand of God her physical body would not even contribute the egg that was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit but God would place this seed in her body in a supernatural way so that her body had nothing to do with producing the life of the Son of Man the Son of God it would come totally by a supernatural act nothing natural about it no semen or seed from the man and even Mary not not providing as it would be in the normal way God would do a new thing and she would not even provide the egg but God Himself would provide the seed both the egg and that which would cost conception by the Holy Spirit and the scripture tells us in Isaiah 7:14 don't forget Jeremiah because Jeremiah 31 22 said the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall come pass a man and then look at that with Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign this is not just natural turn of events this is part of that fullness of time that we read about in Galatians behold this is the sign that the Lord Himself would give behold a virgin shall conceive in the natural it is impossible for a virgin a girl who has never known the intimacy of a man to conceive but this is a new thing this was something created by God that was so holy and so pure and so undefiled behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel which we know means by interpretation God with the word sign in Isaiah 7:14 says a distinguishing mark it means a signal a token a miraculous proof see the scripture said the sign was given from the Lord and that was God providing allowing the seed of the woman to do what an egg in a natural woman would not be capable of doing in in a natural womb that egg cannot bring conception without the contribution of another but God placed such a specific egg the scripture calls it a seed so holy so new so unusual that when the Holy Spirit would come over Mary the Holy Spirit would quicken that seed and cause it to bring with conception life into the womb of that highly favored and chosen woman of God that word virgin in the Hebrew is a virgin a maid a young woman one whose characteristic is virginity and I mention that because there are many people who say that that scripture only means it didn't really mean a woman who had not had sexual relations it just means a young woman a young maiden it has nothing to do with her her sexuality or her virginity but we know that that is not the truth we know that this was a new thing we know that God was doing something never before done in the earth and that he planned this whole concept before the world was ever framed let me read it to you quickly in Luke chapter 1 verses 26 through 35 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary or Miriam and the angels came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him it says she was troubled verse 29 at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou hast found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David can you imagine receiving a message like this from the angel Gabriel and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end verse 34 then Mary then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel of the Lord promises you will conceive and bear a son and Mary's response is with the question how can this thing be this has never been done before seeing that I know not a man meaning I've had no physical intimacy with a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee listen therefore also that holy thing which shall be born viii shall be called the Son of God that holy thing indeed as Jeremiah 31 22 said a new thing a holy thing which shall be born of the you're going to carry it and you're going to give birth to it but he shall be called the son of God I tell you that is a powerful visitation and so confirming of what we've read in Scripture and then look at Matthew chapter 1 and get these verses in your spirit verse 18 through 25 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost you might say brother Shelly do you really believe that this is the truth about the conception and the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe it with everything that is within me I believe that this was the new thing I believe that this was a woman encompassing a man and it was a virgin conceiving receiving a child of the Lord as we read in Isaiah 7:14 as a sign not any other ordinary man with an ordinary birth but even his conception was bigger than the laws of science even the way that he was formed in Mary's womb was so holy and so new and so different that it was a sign of greater things he goes on to say in verse 19 then Joseph Matthew 1 her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily this was hard because if she's now beginning to show as one who is with child the obvious perception would be they have had relations together before the completion of their wedding vow and this would have brought a lot of shame and and Joseph he wasn't just being selfish it says his concern was for Mary he didn't want her to be ridiculed and mocked in such a way but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife listen for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost this was the angel of the Lord reassuring Joseph she has not been with any other man she's not only pure to you she's not only kept herself apart from you but she has kept herself apart from any other man you don't have to worry this that is growing in her womb is conceived by the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus Yeshua for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done verse 22 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us so the scripture tells us in Matthew 1 and 22 and 23 that this is the fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 then Joseph verse 24 being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had been him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus what a new thing what a holy sign a woman chosen given a seed that she might encompass circle envelop a man look at Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7 for unto us back to Isaiah's prophecy of the coming Messiah for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal I love this the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this this holy giving of a seed to the woman that she might bear this son who would be known not only as Jesus Yeshua son of God but he would also wear the name wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace and how would this be fulfilled the zeal of the law word will perform this this is what brought about this glorious wonderful gift from God I love this so much and we could take those verses of Scripture and even break them down further but it's important to understand that Jesus was both the Son of God and this was because of the condescension the word becoming flesh all-knowing sovereign all-powerful God choosing to come down into a body of flesh a body that would be hungry a body that would be tired a body that would be sleepy a body that would experience all of the emotions and struggles and even temptations of humanity yet without sin one who would so understand what it means to live a natural life on the earth even though he was very much supernatural God that he could be touched I think I just can't say enough of how much I love God's plan I just want to celebrate this plan of God I just want to give honor to the great architect the designer of all the universe and I just want to say Lord no one has ever had a greater plan no one has ever had better thoughts and ideas of how to answer the sin problem on planet Earth and all of this was because you were looking for someone who would love you who would serve you and worship you not because they were forced to but because with all of their heart they truly wanted to love you they wanted to serve you and this was the whole design we know that Jesus was the only gotten Son of God we mentioned earlier that Adam was a created son but Jesus was referred to as the begotten son of God that was a part of this new thing this was a part of the sign that was going to be given as prophesied by Jeremiah and Isaiah John 1:18 said no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him this was a way of helping us to understand that Jesus was a perfect reflection of the father the spirit of the Father that was inside of him Jesus was the manifestation of the Living God God the Father as we read in Isaiah 9 and verse 6 the ever lasting father in John 3:16 we all know it for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john 3:18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and then one more verse here in first John chapter 4 verse 9 in this was manifested in all of this we could say was manifested the love of God toward us hallelujah in all of this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent His only begotten Son and into the world that we might live through him oh what a beautiful word what a beautiful promise I may not be telling you anything that you don't already know but it's so good to be reminded that every bit of this plan all the players all the characters the timing the cities the little towns every part of it was God's design it was a part of the blueprint of the Great Creator in order for the Lord's purpose to be brought to completion many events would have to be brought to pass many things would have to take place Mary had to get understanding from the angel of the Lord Joseph had to get understanding from the angel of the Lord Joseph had to had to see Mary and Mary had to catch Joseph's eye for them to even come together in an espousal in a commitment just think about all the different things that had to happen to get everybody on the scene at the right time for the sign to show up for the new thing to show up for the woman to encompass the man and and more importantly so that this first messianic prophecy of Genesis 3 14 and 15 could actually come to pass I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel none of this could happen without Jesus coming on the scene to minister to live to die to be resurrected and he had to come as the seed of the woman and this was the only birth where it came by the seed of the woman all other births are brought about all other conceptions are brought about by the seed of a man fertilizing the egg of the woman but this birth was a sign this birth was a new thing this was a part of the plan and the purposes of God to bring Redemption to those who could believe I want to pray for you as we go off the air may God reveal this truth to you may you get a hold of it and may it cause you to love him more and serve him with a more sincere heart than you've ever served him before father I thank you for truth I love your word I love how the Holy Spirit can connect Scripture to Scripture and verse diverse and I love watching the blueprint unfold and I love that you're giving us understanding of the plan and the purpose that you had from before the foundation of the world I pray Lord that you'd make it a greater revelation and reality to those watching this program today I pray for healing for those who are sick and infirmed I pray for deliverance for those who are bound by the Spirit of darkness by the evil of this world and I pray O God that you would draw those maybe someone's watching and they said I didn't even consider what a beautiful plan God had to bring salvation to me through the birth and the death of the Lord Jesus and maybe Lord they would call on you right now I pray that you would touch them that they would know that you're on the other end of the prayer that they could have a feeling a sense of knowing that you have heard their prayer of repentance and that your desire is for them to be born again we ask these things in the precious name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and a man if you want to know the Lord come to the Lord repent of your sin invite him to come into your heart and set you free don't disregard this sign
