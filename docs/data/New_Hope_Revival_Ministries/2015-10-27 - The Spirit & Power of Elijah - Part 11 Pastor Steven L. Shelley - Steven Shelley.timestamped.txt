[0:37] Well, hello there. I'm Pastor Steven
[0:39] Shel and you're watching The Eagles Cry.
[0:42] And I want to thank you for doing that.
[0:44] I hope you'll stay tuned. We're going to
[0:47] soon come to a conclusion on our series
[0:51] that we've been working on for weeks
[0:53] now. Maybe you're tired of the subject.
[0:55] You're ready to move on to something
[0:57] else. But I just feel like it's a very
[0:59] important and timely study that we've
[1:02] been engaged in. And I believe the Lord
[1:04] will certainly use it. Uh hopefully
[1:07] you'll get an opportunity to see some of
[1:09] the episodes again at some point because
[1:12] I want this to get deep in your spirit
[1:14] because I believe that many of us are a
[1:17] part of this commission to be anointed
[1:20] with the spirit and power of Elijah to
[1:23] help prepare the earth for the second
[1:25] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want
[1:28] to remind you that we have a an amazing
[1:31] website revival.org
[1:34] revival.org org and we invite you to
[1:36] visit that website and take advantage of
[1:39] a lot of the free resources that we
[1:41] have, articles to read and visions and
[1:44] things that we've been sharing over the
[1:46] course of a good many years now. And I
[1:48] believe you'll be blessed. I think it's
[1:50] a good way for you and I to stay in
[1:52] touch. You can send us an email with
[1:55] your prayer request or a little note to
[1:57] let us know that you're watching this
[1:59] program. And that is a tremendous
[2:01] encouragement to us to keep doing what
[2:04] we do for the kingdom of God. I want to
[2:07] thank those of you who have already sent
[2:09] in your prayer needs and have already
[2:11] let us know that you're out there on the
[2:14] other end of this camera and you're
[2:16] watching this and you're blessed. And
[2:18] that is a great encouragement to us. I
[2:21] want us to read again uh today Malachi
[2:25] 4:es 5 and 6. Behold, I will send you
[2:29] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[2:31] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[2:34] And he shall turn the heart of the
[2:37] fathers to the children, and the heart
[2:39] of the children to their fathers, lest I
[2:42] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[2:45] Last week we talked about the fact that
[2:47] when the angel of the Lord came to
[2:50] Zachcharias the father of John the
[2:53] Baptist and spoke to him about the
[2:56] ministry commission of John the Baptist.
[2:59] He specifically tell told him in Luke 1
[3:05] verse 17 that he shall go he being John
[3:08] the Baptist shall go before him being
[3:12] the Lord Jesus in the spirit and power
[3:15] of Elias.
[3:17] But I want to remind you that when it
[3:20] came time for him to identify the
[3:23] ministry of John the Baptist in the
[3:25] Bible, he referred back to Malachi's
[3:28] prophecy, but only quoted a portion of
[3:31] it to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[3:35] the children. What about the rest? The
[3:38] children to the fathers. Instead, he
[3:41] said, "And the disobedient to the wisdom
[3:43] of the just." And many say, "Well, that
[3:45] is referring to that other part,
[3:48] children back to the fathers." But I
[3:50] think that it was more intentional than
[3:53] that. I don't think the angel misqued
[3:55] the prophecy. I think he was giving us a
[3:58] key. Even like the Lord gave us a key in
[4:01] Matthew chapter 17. Let's glance back
[4:04] there really quick. The Lord gave us a
[4:06] key because the disciples asked him,
[4:09] "Why are the scribes saying that Elias
[4:11] must first come?" And Jesus answered in
[4:14] in verse 11, Matthew 17, Elias truly
[4:18] shall first come, future tense, and
[4:22] restore all things. But I say unto you,
[4:25] he has come already, and they knew him
[4:27] not. And they did to him whatsoever they
[4:30] listed, speaking of John the Baptist. So
[4:33] there's no doubt in my mind that when
[4:35] the Lord said Elias is come already, he
[4:39] was connecting the ministry of John the
[4:42] Baptist with the prophecy of Malachi
[4:45] concerning the spirit and power of
[4:47] Elijah. No doubt about it. But when he
[4:51] was speaking still in the future tense,
[4:54] he was speaking about another
[4:56] installment, another visitation of the
[5:00] spirit and power of Elijah. And when
[5:02] that when that application came, when
[5:06] that installment was to come, it would
[5:10] be about restoring all things. The
[5:13] ministry of John the Baptist was about
[5:16] building a bridge uh as a forerunner so
[5:20] that those who had held to the
[5:22] instructions of Moses, they needed some
[5:25] help in being able to see that what God
[5:28] was doing in this other generation, we
[5:31] could save the children. what God was
[5:33] doing in the second temple period when
[5:35] the Lord Jesus came as Messiah. It
[5:38] wasn't easy for the old-timers to be
[5:40] able to look ahead and say, "Hey, this
[5:42] is finally it." They waited and waited
[5:45] and waited and waited. And yet, when it
[5:48] finally came, they they had a little
[5:50] trouble and they needed the ministry of
[5:52] John the Baptist. And I did a study not
[5:55] too long ago and went all the way
[5:57] through the Bible and and through the
[5:59] gospels and looked at all the times that
[6:02] the scripture said and many believed and
[6:04] many believed and many believed and many
[6:06] believed and it was so outstanding of
[6:09] how many people really began to believe
[6:12] and accept that the Lord Jesus was the
[6:15] Messiah. Many more much more than what
[6:18] we have come to understand in in church.
[6:21] You know, we think about all of the Jews
[6:24] rejecting uh the Lord Jesus as Messiah,
[6:27] and that's just not the case at all.
[6:29] There were multitudes of them who were
[6:32] able to identify the ministry of the
[6:35] Lord Jesus as Messiah. And part of that
[6:39] was because of the great ministry of
[6:41] John the Baptist. So, thank God for what
[6:44] he did, but he did not restore all
[6:47] things. much much would need to be
[6:50] restored at a later time. There's no
[6:53] doubt about that. And uh another part of
[6:56] the commission of John the Baptist under
[6:59] the spirit and power of Elijah was to
[7:01] make ready a people prepared for the
[7:04] Lord. I want to thank God for what John
[7:08] the Baptist was able to accomplish. And
[7:11] I also want to look forward. I want to
[7:14] see uh if I can identify other
[7:18] applications or installments
[7:21] of the spirit and power of Elijah. You
[7:25] know, there are other scriptures that we
[7:27] could read about the ministry of John
[7:30] the Baptist. But what I would like to to
[7:32] speak to you about now, as we ended the
[7:34] broadcast last week, we talked about uh
[7:38] we well actually we asked a question and
[7:40] we didn't answer it. We said, uh, how
[7:44] important was it for people of that time
[7:48] period, uh, to recognize that John the
[7:52] Baptist was not just an ordinary
[7:54] preacher, but that he had truly come in
[7:57] the anointing in the spirit and power of
[8:00] Elijah and what his commission was all
[8:02] about, fulfilling a portion of Malachi's
[8:05] prophecy. What did it matter whether
[8:07] people received him as such or looked at
[8:10] him as just another preacher like people
[8:12] would do today? Uh why is that
[8:15] important? Well, I want to show you or
[8:17] even is it important? Well, I want to
[8:19] show you what the scripture said in Luke
[8:21] 7 and verse 29 and 30. I think it is
[8:24] important. He said, "And all the people
[8:27] that heard him and the publicans
[8:31] justified God being baptized with the
[8:34] baptism of John." Now, that means that
[8:36] there were a lot of people, including
[8:38] the publicans that recognized the
[8:41] ministry that John had come to fulfill.
[8:44] But verse 30 said, "But the Pharisees
[8:48] and lawyers rejected the council of God
[8:53] against themselves, being not baptized
[8:57] of him." Now, do you understand the the
[9:01] significance of that language? Many of
[9:03] the people that heard him and the
[9:06] publicans justified God, gave God praise
[9:09] and legitimacy being baptized, obeying
[9:13] what John compelled the people to do,
[9:15] and that was to have a baptism unto
[9:18] repentance. But on the other hand, many
[9:21] did not. Pharisees and lawyers are
[9:25] particularly mentioned here. They
[9:27] rejected the council of God. They didn't
[9:29] justify God. They didn't obey the words
[9:32] of the Lord in the mouth of John the
[9:34] Baptist. Why? Because they discounted
[9:36] them. Because they said, "It's not
[9:38] important to believe him. We have Moses.
[9:41] We have the instruction. We have the
[9:43] law. We don't have to listen to what
[9:45] John the Baptist says. Who is he after
[9:47] all?" Many said, "Wait a minute. This
[9:50] man speaks with an unusual speech. Thi
[9:53] there is something prophetic about this
[9:55] ministry." And they went to the water
[9:57] and obeyed his instruction. But the
[10:00] others said nothing to it. And it says
[10:03] that they rejected the council of God
[10:06] against themselves, refusing to be
[10:09] baptized of John. Why are you bringing
[10:12] it out like that, pastor? Well, I'm
[10:14] bringing it out that way because I want
[10:16] you to know that it is important. It
[10:19] does matter whether or not we honor and
[10:23] respect and recognize the messengers
[10:26] that God sends to us. especially when
[10:30] we're trying to identify the spirit and
[10:33] power of Elijah. It is important. It's
[10:36] not just a a common event that we can uh
[10:41] miss. And it doesn't matter if we miss
[10:44] it. It's important for us. That's why
[10:46] we've spent so much time
[10:49] looking at the characteristics of the
[10:51] man who first had the spirit and power.
[10:56] It's important for us to look at his
[10:58] life. so that we can then identify those
[11:00] characteristics and traits in other
[11:03] people's lives. I want to tell you that
[11:06] I believe if John the Baptist fulfilled
[11:09] the first part of Malachi's prophecy,
[11:13] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[11:14] children, there would have to be another
[11:17] application. There would have to be
[11:20] another uh installment of that spirit
[11:23] and power of Elijah that would turn the
[11:25] hearts of the children to their fathers.
[11:28] We've got the fathers turned to the
[11:30] children. But Malachi said, "And the
[11:32] hearts of the children to their
[11:35] fathers." What I believe we have here is
[11:38] a promise of another coming of the
[11:42] spirit and power of Elijah. And I
[11:44] believe that this was already forerun in
[11:47] the earth a generation ago. And many
[11:50] people were able to recognize that God
[11:53] was doing a great work in helping to
[11:55] prepare his bride. and others quickly
[11:58] rejected it because it didn't seem to be
[12:02] in the same flow of their tradition. And
[12:05] you know, that's where we all get into
[12:06] trouble when we are so staunch in our
[12:10] tradition that we miss what the Holy
[12:12] Spirit is trying to do sometimes in what
[12:16] looks like a new way. Now remember Jesus
[12:19] is the one who said uh Elias truly shall
[12:23] first come but he has indeed already
[12:27] come. This is our Lord explaining
[12:30] Malachi's prophecy. Yes, he has already
[12:34] come in John the Baptist fulfilling a
[12:37] portion of that. But yes, he shall come.
[12:41] I believe that there was a fulfillment
[12:44] of that word a generation ago. And I
[12:48] think it would would be interesting to
[12:51] look at it and see because if there was
[12:55] a generation ago an application of that
[12:58] spirit and power of Elijah, it would
[13:00] help us to know how to position
[13:03] ourselves, what to look for in an hour
[13:06] when God begins to pour that out on his
[13:09] corporate bride. And then the scripture
[13:13] tells us there will be another
[13:14] fulfillment, another installment during
[13:16] the great tribulation, the last years of
[13:20] the great wrath when two witnesses will
[13:23] rise up. One having the spirit and
[13:25] ministry of Moses, another having the
[13:28] spirit and ministry of Elijah. In order
[13:31] to help uh sort of prepare you, I'm just
[13:34] going to share my perspective here. I
[13:36] want you to take note. This is what the
[13:39] spirit of God has made real to me. I'm
[13:41] not here to persuade you of anything
[13:44] beyond scripture. But I want to share
[13:46] with you a testimony that I think is a
[13:50] very important testimony. Something that
[13:53] God did in the earth one generation ago.
[13:56] It is this is 2015. One generation ago,
[14:01] God did some outstanding things in the
[14:03] earth uh in the spirit and power of
[14:06] Elijah. I believe that um I think that
[14:10] the Christian history tells us that
[14:13] there have been some who have come along
[14:15] the way especially after Isusa Street
[14:19] who had outstanding ministries and many
[14:22] of those men actually claimed to be the
[14:26] Elijah that was to come and that Elijah
[14:29] that is to come is still out there in
[14:32] the future. that is referring to one of
[14:35] the two witnesses or the two olive
[14:37] branches as Zachariah called them. Uh
[14:40] and so there were some along the way
[14:43] actually quite a few who got so caught
[14:46] up in what they were seeing happening in
[14:49] their ministry uh that somehow they
[14:52] stepped into error and began to claim I
[14:55] am the Elijah to come. You have to
[14:58] follow me. And this is very spooky and
[15:01] it's it's really a dangerous vein for
[15:04] people to flow in. And you know what I'm
[15:07] about to read to you is a ministry that
[15:10] God used mightily in the earth a
[15:13] generation ago. And because of God using
[15:16] that ministry so mightily, others have
[15:19] come along and said, "Well, he thought
[15:21] he was the Elijah." Well, I want to
[15:24] assure you that is an error. The man
[15:27] that I'm about to read this testimony of
[15:30] did not believe that he was the Elijah.
[15:35] I think perhaps that somewhere in his
[15:37] ministry he began to recognize that what
[15:40] God was doing through him was of an
[15:44] extraordinary measure. I I don't doubt
[15:47] that at all. But I do not believe and
[15:49] I've heard hundreds and hundreds and
[15:52] hundreds, I'm not exaggerating, of his
[15:55] sermons and have never heard him say
[15:59] that he felt like he was the Elijah. Let
[16:04] me read this testimony to you and at
[16:06] least consider these things. It was on
[16:09] Sunday, June the 11th of 1933. That was
[16:14] a long time ago, that a most amazing and
[16:18] documented phenomenon occurred.
[16:21] William Brham was 24 years of age and
[16:26] had just completed his first tent
[16:29] campaign in a city called Jeffersonville
[16:32] in the state of Indiana.
[16:36] This had run for two weeks and about 130
[16:40] candidates were awaiting baptism in the
[16:44] Ohio River at the foot of Spring Street,
[16:48] Jeffersonville, Indiana, before a crowd
[16:51] of about 3,000 that had gathered on the
[16:55] riverbank to watch. I stumbled a bit in
[16:57] my reading, but it was uh uh in the Ohio
[17:00] River. That's where the baptism took
[17:02] place at the foot of Spring Street.
[17:04] Again, in the city of Jeffersonville,
[17:07] Indiana, about 3,000 people, the article
[17:10] says, were standing on the banks
[17:12] watching this baptism take place. It had
[17:16] not rained for some 3 weeks, and the day
[17:19] was hot and the sky was clear. At about
[17:23] 2:00 in the afternoon, as William Brham
[17:27] prepared to baptize Edward Kulvin, the
[17:32] 17th candidate for baptism, he heard
[17:35] within him a small voice that spoke to
[17:39] him and said, "Look up." It repeated
[17:43] this twice more. And when he gazed
[17:47] upward, high above him in the clear sky,
[17:51] an area about 15 ft square could be seen
[17:56] churning as the waves were rolling
[18:00] across it. Immediately a bright
[18:03] pulsating star appeared from within the
[18:08] disturbance and lowered itself with a
[18:12] whoosh to hang just above the young
[18:16] minister's head. Do I have your
[18:18] attention yet? Well, that sounds like an
[18:21] outstanding event. Wouldn't you have
[18:23] liked to have been standing there to
[18:25] watch God do something like that? Such a
[18:28] supernatural sign. It was a few seconds
[18:32] before brother Brandham could cry out in
[18:35] alarm, causing the bystanders to then
[18:38] look up themselves
[18:40] and also notice this star or light. Some
[18:45] screamed while others fainted or ran for
[18:50] fear. Now, I don't know how I would have
[18:53] reacted, but I know I would have reacted
[18:55] somehow if I was standing there
[18:59] witnessing something like this. Brother
[19:02] Brham had seen the light many times
[19:04] before, he said, but had seldom spoke
[19:08] about it to others because he found that
[19:11] very few people could believe such a
[19:13] testimony. Maybe some of you are having
[19:15] a hard time believing such a testimony.
[19:18] In his own words, he said, "It nearly
[19:20] scared me to death." And then what
[19:24] happened next was even more outstanding
[19:26] than that. A voice thundered out and
[19:30] spoke over the crowd, saying, "As John
[19:35] the Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[19:39] coming of Christ, you are sent with a
[19:42] message that will forerun his second
[19:47] coming." Now either this is a a a true
[19:51] supernatural outstanding event or
[19:55] someone is telling us a fib. When this
[19:59] was through this pillar of fire, this
[20:02] star was received up into a small white
[20:05] cloud that had formed in the area of
[20:08] churning sky high above the river. The
[20:12] sequence of events occupied only a
[20:14] minute but would lead to the most
[20:16] dynamic and extensive divine healing
[20:19] revival ever experienced by mankind. Now
[20:23] wait a minute. Are you telling me that
[20:26] this event took place there on that day
[20:30] in in on the Ohio River? A star came, a
[20:34] voice spoke out. Okay. But that wasn't
[20:36] the end of the story. You're now telling
[20:39] me that one of the greatest revivals of
[20:42] divine healing in the history of the
[20:44] world took place after this event? Yes.
[20:48] I'm here to tell you that there are
[20:51] thousands and thousands of documented
[20:55] healings that took place over the course
[20:57] of the next 2530 years in the ministry
[21:01] of this man. They came by the thousands
[21:05] to be healed. It was an outstanding
[21:08] ministry. And to me, this adds even more
[21:12] credibility to this witness testimony of
[21:16] what took place that day on the Ohio
[21:19] River. If you're going to tell a
[21:21] supernatural event like this, there
[21:23] needs to be some fruit behind it. Amen.
[21:26] Some miracles behind it. Souls being
[21:29] saved and lives being changed. And we
[21:32] certainly have the historical record to
[21:36] say this was the truth. This happened.
[21:39] Brother Brandham reported that the event
[21:42] that we just read to you was featured in
[21:45] a local newspaper and a man by the name
[21:47] of Dr. Lee Vale stated that news
[21:51] organizations picked up this story what
[21:54] took place there on the Ohio River and
[21:57] circulated around the US. In fact, it
[22:01] went out all over the world. One
[22:03] headline read, "Mysterious light appears
[22:08] over Baptist minister while baptizing in
[22:11] the Ohio River." Now, somebody believed
[22:14] this testimony. That doesn't mean
[22:16] everything we read in the newspaper is
[22:18] so or true, but this had such
[22:22] credibility that it went out through the
[22:25] world in the news. I think that's pretty
[22:28] outstanding. Just as the Lord Jesus had
[22:31] presented himself to John the Baptist in
[22:33] the River Jordan in order that he could
[22:36] be baptized before beginning his public
[22:38] ministry, it appears so that in 1933
[22:42] he publicly commissioned a forerunning
[22:45] ministry while he was baptizing in the
[22:47] Ohio River to begin a ministry that
[22:50] would deliver a message to forrun the
[22:53] second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[22:56] Now I tell you that's an outstanding
[22:58] event and I'm I'm aware of many many
[23:02] other testimonies of how God worked in
[23:05] such an outstanding and supernatural way
[23:08] in the life of brother William Brham. In
[23:11] fact there is a famous photograph of the
[23:14] pillar of fire that came and hung over
[23:17] brother Brandham's head in the in the
[23:20] Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston, Texas.
[23:24] uh as a debate was going on about
[23:27] whether divine healing was real or not.
[23:30] And that photograph has was taken. It
[23:32] was examined and proven to be uh
[23:36] something that couldn't be explained. Uh
[23:38] they looked at and said it couldn't be
[23:40] just a a glare of a light or some kind
[23:43] of uh anomaly like that. There had to be
[23:46] some something of an unusual nature. I
[23:49] want to say supernatural nature. Some
[23:52] people have called that a halo over
[23:54] brother Brandham's head no that was a
[23:56] witness of the pillar of fire just
[23:59] letting people know this there's
[24:01] something to this and uh interestingly
[24:04] enough uh over00 recorded sermons remain
[24:08] today of of this humble ministry that
[24:12] God vindicated time and time again he
[24:15] would stand up in prayer lines and by
[24:18] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit he
[24:21] was able to see right into the secrets
[24:23] of men's hearts. God doing it through
[24:25] him. Calling people by name, calling
[24:28] their doctor's name, calling out their
[24:31] disease, sometimes even their street
[24:34] address, phone number, doctor's name. It
[24:37] went on and on and on every time. What
[24:40] it was, it was Jesus Christ. The same
[24:43] yesterday, today, and forever. It was
[24:45] God showing the people that exactly what
[24:48] Jesus did when he was in his earthly
[24:50] body because of the power of the Holy
[24:52] Ghost available in us that we also can
[24:56] have a portion of that ministry that was
[24:59] none other than the ministry of the Lord
[25:01] Jesus Christ. Now, because I believe
[25:04] that this humble man, Brother Brandham,
[25:07] came in the same spirit, the same power,
[25:09] the same anointing as John the Baptist
[25:12] or as Elijah or Elisha. I think that if
[25:16] you begin to be curious, you ought to do
[25:19] some research. You ought to dig a little
[25:21] bit and find out more about this
[25:25] anointed ministry. And if you write us,
[25:28] if you contact us, we'll point you in
[25:30] the right direction. We'll help you find
[25:32] out more because if he was given a
[25:35] message, that was what the commission
[25:37] said. You will be given a message that
[25:40] will go out and help prepare the the
[25:43] bride to help forerrun the second coming
[25:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then it would
[25:48] behoove me, it would be it would be
[25:50] compelling to me to look into that
[25:53] message, see what's there. And I have I
[25:56] want you to know I have spent many years
[25:59] since 1988
[26:01] studying the ministry and the message
[26:04] that God gave William Brandom. And I
[26:06] know that it is a message sent from God
[26:09] to help prepare a bride to be ready for
[26:12] the resurrection. And so I encourage you
[26:14] to look into that. That being said, I
[26:17] also believe that God wants to anoint
[26:20] this generation with a double portion of
[26:23] that same kind of an anointing that
[26:25] rested on that man's ministry. Doesn't
[26:28] that sound good? How many of you'd like
[26:30] to come into that kind of a double
[26:32] portion spirit and power of Elijah? I
[26:36] believe it's available. Pray about it.
[26:38] Ask the Lord to make that real in your
[26:41] life. Contact us if you want more
[26:42] information. Father, thank you for
[26:45] giving me this privilege today to speak
[26:48] your word and to share a testimony of
[26:51] something that you did in the earth just
[26:54] a generation ago. I pray that you'll
[26:57] stir men's hearts and if there's
[26:59] something within them that's quickened
[27:01] and they become interested to know more
[27:04] that you will put the right information
[27:06] in their hands so that they can be
[27:08] blessed and encouraged by that message
[27:10] that you gave to that servant of the
[27:13] Lord. Also Lord help us to have a faith
[27:16] to believe that we'll be a part of that
[27:19] outpouring when your anointing falls on
[27:23] a corporate body. the spirit and power
[27:25] of Elijah. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:27] Christ, we pray. Amen. Thank you for
[27:30] watching the Eagles Cry. I hope you'll
[27:33] come back again. God bless you. Bye-bye
[27:36] for this week.
