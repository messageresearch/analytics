the other end of this camera you have needs that you wish for the Lord to meet and take care of he is the one who is well able to do that those of you that are local here may remember Pastor up the road brother Bethune I saw him yesterday and he's just a he's getting older and his wife is in a nursing home would you remember him and his wife to the Lord they need the touch of the Lord in their lives not touched it come on now there was a message Pastor that reached out yesterday I'm not going to share his name but uh he has been he's had a lot of sickness and a lot of battles health-wise and this week and some new symptom has come and he he's stuttering and can hardly make a sentence so something has certainly gone wrong and I was surprised to hear from him but he asked me to pray and he asked me to ask anybody that I had confidence in to pray so I'm doing that this morning also brother Dale Knight from Tucson reached out yesterday to tell me that brother Caleb was in the emergency room with a temperature of 106. and they were able to get his temperature down but he has infection in his body uh inflammation infection and they have put it uh sent it off to see if it's viral or bacterial they sent him home late yesterday evening and uh with and told them to watch his temperature it started with a sinus infection it's the same sounds like the same thing the doctor described to me at the beach that that she was having patients hospitalized with let's pray and ask the Lord to touch brother Caleb this morning there is a precious sister who's up in years who is reaching the end of her her life it seems and I would like for her to be lifted up to the Lord in prayer today that God would strengthen her and uh her words to my family where I'm just waiting to go home so may God give her the grace and strength to do anything say anything that needs to be said do anything that needs to be done and I would appreciate you praying for traveling mercies for my family my girls and Benjamin and Jenna are at the youth camp today and they'll be leaving it's a little over eight hours home and Joshua is in Virginia and it's a little over seven hours home I'd like for them to be taken care of the Lord is good and I I don't want God's done good things for them while they're away I don't want the enemy to try to come against that with a hindrance on the way home all right all of those people traveling from the Youth Camp may God just give them traveling mercies and all yeah sister Anna and Bethany are traveling but all that God did for those kids at that Youth Camp seal it in seal it in Lord touching Jesus is all that really matters [Music] is all that really [Music] and then your life will never say there is only one way to do too much brother Hawk will you come to pray today please oh touching Jesus is that really matter and then your life will never be safe [Music] there is only one way to just believe when you call [Music] Lord I just want to thank you even after walking with you a long time you keep making yourself more and more real to us you've given us Grace to believe in the name believe on your name to have faith in you that you made it so real to me that you gave me everything when you went and gave your blood for me and realizing I don't have to struggle no more you didn't just take all the sins away you took my sin nature and you nailed it on the cross and you exchanged it with your Divine Life I I just want to ask you to forgive me when I tried to bring my own Works to the table and not relying on your grace and so father we thank you we have access to you right now through the blood of Jesus Christ we overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ my testimony is today that you're my lamb that you're my life my Creator and everything was accomplished through your death and Resurrection so all the requests that had to deal with sickness any kind of trouble that we deal in this life it was accomplished so about faith right now Lord we just look to you in the name of the Lord Jesus those that need help in their bodies that her pastor mentioned in this prayer request they're your servants they labor for your kingdom and for your people extend Grace extend healing and power and virtue into their lives whatever anything they need in their lives I just ask that you would Minister according to your mercies according to your great power that is that is available in Heavenly places those that are traveling Lord protection watch over them even that the word that was delivered to to the the young people give them the grace to meditate on it and let it plant in them not just the one-time experience made that grow and become something in their lives so Lord we just bless you because today we know we are the redeemed we know we belong to you and so we just bless you we honor you and we just thank you for your cross and for your blood and we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen [Music] we give you praise Lord [Applause] Hallelujah you may have your seats today Hallelujah Hallelujah sister Flo they sent me word that you were going to sing do you have the energy the strength to come foreign to sing we want to receive come on we want to receive the tithe and offering but before we do that I want to say how good it is to be in the house of the Lord with God's people last weekend what happened was unexpected but God is still good he is faithful he brought us through he strengthened us he helped us and we're here today to give him praise and honor that is due to his name he is the one who strengthens us who heals us it is all him we give him praise we give him honor anything that we have it is because of him but it's so good to be gathered together in the house of the Lord once again I know that God is moving he's working he's working in me he's working in you and he does not change he is forever the same and we just honor him for that as sister flows things today I'm going to ask brother Elias and brother Austin Hodges I'm going to let these two brothers come to you for the tithe and offering we want to give as given unto the Lord and after sister flow sings then we will receive the offering for the principle since we did not get to last weekend God bless you as you give to the Lord some morning praise the Lord I want to say something I can't remember if I read it I heard it or it was I think it might have been the movie that uh Corey Chen boom said something I heard it this week I don't know what day but she said something that really resonated with me and I thought it might be helpful to you on down the road I try not to do anything to anybody that don't help them so I just wanted to speak this to you pray that you'll hold it in your heart for the days ahead you know they got lice and her sister was kind of disturbed about it you know but she told her she said you know we just have to thank the Lord for everything and we do we have to thank him for everything it don't matter how bad or good or whatever we have to thank him for it and it turned out that because they had lice they were able to read the word of God and Worship the Lord and to pray [Music] so you know when something happens to us we just thank the Lord for it I just wanted to say that cause y'all just like my children you know and I would tell my own children whatever the Lord does whatever he brings your way thank him for it thank you for everything for me oh Lamb of God he is our lamb what a price I'm sorry right talk about the time [Music] to hide but you have said him from your side walk upon you [Music] come [Music] oh Lamb of God [Music] God I love the whole [Music] Lamb of God oh watch me [Music] pray my Jesus Christ the lamb of God [Music] your gift of love a crew [Music] him and he died [Music] great fight the Lamb of God oh Lamb of God [Music] [Music] oh now of God [Music] his friend my Jesus Christ the lamb lamb of God thank you Jesus I was so lost I should have done [Music] to be led by don't stop and [Music] all the Lamb of God [Music] oh Lamb of God of God I love God [Music] oh me [Music] oh God oh watch me [Music] oh watch me [Music] here [Music] my Jesus Christ [Music] la la la la la [Music] Hallelujah [Music] no no no no [Music] Hallelujah we worship you Jesus oh we bless you Lord hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah oh what a cleansing fountain the precious blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] we bless you Lord she'll be all right Hallelujah Give the Lord another shout of Praise he is worthy of all of the praise Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah although we weren't here last week we come today bringing our offering to the Lord for the principle of the mortgage of this building this property God has been faithful to us to help us get this mortgage paid down as of today there has been some given through the week even though we weren't here and the total that has been given now stands at 299 455 dollars and 84 cents isn't the Lord so good to us how faithful he is [Applause] you may have noticed there were quite a few ruts that were in the property there in front of Hawk and marybeth's house and uh a trucker apparently could not read the sign that said stay off of the grass and decided to take a detour through it lift quite a few ruts that company paid to have that fixed although they were dragging their feet because they said they couldn't find anyone and finally called them and our newest company has fixed that well in the meantime there was a sinkhole that was discovered in that front yard nine feet deep about five feet in diameter may have been there all along I don't know but because of those ruts it was discovered we were able to get it filled in and get that mess cleaned up and we're thankful to the Lord for that that could be taken care of and that no one was hurt no one was injured because of that hole it's kind of surprising that the truck didn't fall into it because it was large enough that the wheel of the truck should have fell down in it but it did not and so the goodness of God we're just so thankful for his goodness today if you brought your offering with you would you put it in your hand we just want to pray and ask God's blessing over you and multiplication of whatever he wants to do with this we're just looking at 2023 this Supernatural year that this mortgage will be taken care of father I thank you for faithful people that bring their tithe and offering we also bless those that have given online Lord I pray your richest blessing on them as they have kept Covenant with you with tithe and with offering now Lord we brought our uh offering and some have also given that online and so we're just asking for your blessing on The Giver in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I pray Lord that you will multiply this and that this debt would snowball quickly that it would be behind us that we can do what you have called us to do we give you the glory and the honor and the praise for you are the worthy one and it is because of you that we live and move and have our being we have that which we have been given financially to be able to live in this life and we want to give you the Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Ian would you be willing to come and hold the offering bag as we give our offering to the Lord today sister Laurel Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow [Music] because [Music] all my fear is gone cause I know yes I know he holds my fears you my life is worth the living just because [Music] God [Music] they called him she he came to [Music] You by my pardon man an empty grave is there to Blue [Music] I can face to because he lives oh yes [Music] is gone [Music] life is worth the living just cause he [Music] Give the Lord another hand clap of praise isn't he wonderful I I said isn't he wonderful you you probably didn't hear me you may be seated you you probably didn't hear me he's wonderful and worthy to be praised he deserves all we can give him and more he is so precious to us we are so thankful to be here today to feel as good as we do it is the grace of God we had no idea when I left here Saturday night I was tired from preaching and by the way we've had testimonies all week long of what God did for people Saturday night so I'm thankful for that I had no idea and a little after midnight sometime the first ones at our house started making the trip and this is too much information disclosure but Jenna will tell you Jenna says I'm a Shelley I am in every way but she said except one and uh that means she has a different way of being sick than than most of my family she she really is a little maybe a little closer to how I am sick but my wife has an unusual way and our children have inherited that and and there is no sleeping through it I'll just tell you that it's it rings through the rafters and uh so I got up I prayed I prayed for the family it was uh Mariah Olivia Joshua I was praying for the family and I thought oh Lord thank you Jesus in that selfish I said oh Lord thank you Jesus I feel pretty good I'll pray a little more and then about five o'clock it found me and um well you know we don't have to go any further I feel pretty sick talking about it but uh anyway the thing that I don't know what was going on with me but I wasn't quite over what I had had the shots for the the uh steroid and antibiotic and so it really really wore me out this week and I I stayed in the chair Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday I didn't come to the office I didn't leave the house I didn't dress I I changed my pajamas that's all I did and uh but I wanted to and needed to be here there were things that needed to be done I'm so thankful that so many things can be accomplished online I can pay church power bills in Jerusalem transfers and do all kinds of things from from home but I just said I've got to ask somebody to pray for me so I sent out a little prayer request there on Thursday night and I don't know who it was I'm assuming it was all of you together but somebody touched the Lord and I want to thank you for it Friday morning I felt a strength as I woke up that I had not had through the week and I was able to come and preach to the to the Saints in Ghana and had strength I've been coughing a lot this week still and so that maybe my throat was a little irritated during the broadcast and we let the mic run a little bit hot but other than that it went you you're so so smooth and I would say so anointed we're not if you want to see it you can see it on the Facebook page but I've asked them to show this little clip uh I posted it so some of you have seen it but many of you are not on Facebook and so you don't have much of a clue what goes on and so here's a way for you to see a little bit of what goes on I wanted you to see this they sent this to Hawk so that we would get an idea of how the service went on their end and and you know technology is amazing when I first started going to Ghana there was no internet and then when the internet came we had to go to internet cafes to check our email in the middle of nowhere these dirty little buildings and sometimes we could get on and you could hear it darling you know remember that sound that AOL sound and now the church has big beautiful monitors and they have a hot internet and you know it's just a blessing and and this is why this is a real real blessing I think to be able to do this one two [Music] [Applause] [Music] Pastor tape [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] us but every [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it wasn't I think that's a loot we've seen it again anyway let's thank the Lord for being able to preach in Ghana [Applause] I had someone from our church asked me where that was coming from so I'd like for everybody to look over there if you've never you know walked around the front and looked in there's a state of the art studio right there and uh what a blessing it is that's where the podcast was done and what a blessing to be able to stand there he said the word was I'll give you a Pulpit to the Nations and that's one of the ways that he does that and we want to thank him for it and by the way let's mention the podcast um within 24 hours over 2 000 people on some on the two on the two two platforms that were available over 2 000 people had already viewed the podcast if you have apple podcast it's now available on on there if you have an Apple phone you have a a purple microphone you have this app automatically it comes on the iPhone automatically and uh it has three circles around the microphone I don't know if you can see that or not but when you click on that you will see can you see that any of you see our our logo there and you can get it in audio and in video we're waiting on Spotify there was a little complication with Spotify but it's going on there and because we're using our app uh platform sub splash it's automatically available on many different platforms including overcast Podcast Addict downcast a cast eye catcher and many more somebody said I don't know what these are nor do I but I followed the link and these are all different podcast apps that people use to get their various podcasts and you can go to our app and the podcast is there and not this week but hopefully next week we'll be able to film part two and uh you can go down if you go to our app you know that's how it comes out for watch and live stream if we clicked on that and then sermons and then moments and then Productions if you click on Productions you will find uh the podcast there and you'll be able to to play it you can put your phone down if you're not watching it and be able to listen to it this is one of the things that people were requesting was the ability to listen not just video but there are many people when when you're having a conversation they have requested to have the video so we have the blessing of doing both Joshua River did a magnificent job and he will he will warm up and do better and better and I said to him now honey excuse me son I still call them honey and darling and sweetheart and sugar and they don't mind but I don't know how they're going to feel about it public uh I still kiss him too and on occasion they still sit on my lap that's we kind of raised him to be close and we really appreciate them being close and I sure miss them it's rare in all of these years that I would be in a service my wife and I without any of our children like we are today but let me tell you this we were in the bed last night after 11 o'clock my wife and I both had a phone we were both looking at the screen and I was playing the volume for both of us but there is no joy you uh Josh and hope and I said this already to Ben and to Zach and Josh and David and these young men you will never know until you have children of your own you girls you all of it you'll never know what it feels like to be laying at home or sitting at home watching a service where your children are going through brother Daniel could see his wife and Bethany get a touch but you'll never know what it's like to to be laying there and see your children go through that prayer line those men of God laying hands on them and them shaking and weeping and dancing under the power of God having to be drug off the platform because of the power of God was so real there's no words to describe that what that feels like and I feel so blessed I I told my wife we are so blessed that they are sensitive to the spirit of God if you have any influence and you do teach your children to be sensitive to the spirit of God a Tiffany don't dare not know it when she sits her doll down there you've got to help her pick the doll up but don't you dare hold that little girl back did you all see her worshiping the Lord brother Shane and sister uh Jada sister Sally Duke who was here a few Tuesday nights ago she said to me I want to see that little boy I said what little boy she said that little boy that stands up in the front there and sings with all of his might I said well that's Moses she said well I want to see which one Moses is she said as a streamer he will never know think about it he'll never know how his praise how his big wide open mouth singing the Praises of God blesses me on the other end of the stream in that wonderful wonderful and Elisha is up Carter and Ian and many many more but you don't realize the impact that it has I uh because we missed a couple Services I'm just talking now you might have noticed but uh I because we had no service Sunday morning and Tuesday night we have had I've heard from people this week that I haven't heard from in years I heard from a sister that I've not seen in nearly well well over 25 years who streams never makes a comment never puts a thumbs up never puts a heart on there but she said I am just not running on full octane this week because she said I wasn't able to stream the service on Sunday she give herself away she said I live for that atmosphere and for that preaching and I've heard from so many this week who said we this has been the longest week of Our Lives well it don't have to be because you've got an app there you can go back and listen we have brother branham's sermons on there you can hear Brother green on there you don't have to listen to me but you can be fed wherever you are and you can watch the moments every week and you can watch the reels I'm hearing from people of all faiths and uh you know 99.5 maybe 99.7 is all positive one brother in the message he streamed to he he sent me a note to let me know that prophecies are not supposed to be quoting scripture well I have the same quotes that you do and I know what if prophecy is supposed to be but I don't consider everything that's spoken out in a service under inspiration as prophecy sometimes it's an ecstatic utterance it's the spirit of God inspiring a thought and a thought or a scripture is spoken out loud to God be the glory so take that if you want to muzzle your people go ahead and muzzle them but you're not going to muzzle mine isn't that right what's that matter we I'm not calling it prophecy but I know that it's the spirit of the Lord reminding us that he is the I am that he is the same yesterday today and forever you don't ever know what brother Shaw's going to haul her out I don't call that prophecy but I call that a holy ghost inspired ecstatic utterance as the Lord just speaks out and blesses my blesser so you watch yourself but 99 point seven percent is all encouraging and and and just a real blessing to keep on keeping on let's get the birthdays in Sister Alfreda had a birthday last Sunday and I promise you that we did not come so we wouldn't have to greet you that was not it at all in fact I apologize to her I said I'm sorry I messed up your birthday but I didn't mean to do that can I just say this we are entering into a time where there are many many viruses and many colds and many flus and many things that you can pick up particularly if you vomit it's a good idea not to be around a lot of people after you have done that for a little season and so if you're on your way to a fellowship and you vomit like that maybe you'd skip the fellowship if you're on your way to a service and you feel something like that maybe just for the sake of elderly including your pastor maybe you just skip that a little it's not that we don't want to be together and it's certainly not that we're afraid but I felt I can't tell you how I felt I know God is sovereign I know there's a reason for it but I also know that we make decisions sometime that affect a whole lot of people is that right are you mad at me and we ought to be making wise decisions for ourselves and we ought to be making wise decision for other people so be careful and if you if you do come wash your hands good and and pull away a little bit and don't be right up under people because we can't help it sometime the children will you think it's sometimes it's something you Aid and of course that's just ask the Lord for leadership if you don't know what to do stop and say Lord what would be the best decision for me to make I prayed I thought how awful that would be if all those Indiana people got sick on the way home God was good to them he was merciful to them he was gracious to them most of our visitors came out as far as we know very well uh Hannah Avery crap she was sick and she's she's not in a position where she really needs to be sick but God was good to her and helped her through it but we don't want to be responsible I saw this week that there were several churches that I'm I know about that were not having service on Easter Sunday because there was so much sickness and they're trying to hold it back and so let's just use all the wisdom we can then on Tuesday of this week was Lily minko's birthday and we didn't get to wish her a happy birthday she's probably somewhere in the back and April and Peter's wedding anniversary was on Tuesday as well and how many years would this have been 14 years if God would have let Peter be with us but we think about April every every year of course on times like that and then on Thursday with sister Claudia's birthday and we didn't get to greet her last Sunday it was also brother John Hall's birthday God bless you brother and it was also brother branham's birthday and then today is the anniversary of the Azusa Street Revival we want to thank God for the beginning of laodicea it had to have a beginning Hallelujah it came in with power it actually came in with talking in tongues brother Branham said he'll go out the same way Thou Art weighed in the balance and found wanting and that's where we are in the church world today tomorrow is jaya's birthday did you know foreign happy birthday the next day on the 11th is the anniversary of brother branham's burial you know that he was buried for some time later not because everyone was expecting a resurrection but because there were decisions that had to be made there were many people who wanted brother Branham buried in Tucson and uh so sister Mita was so ill and had gone through so much and her nerves were so bad and there was a quite a discussion about where he would be buried and so that is the anniversary and then Friday of this week is Sister Karen Avery's birthday that's RJ's mom she's been a faithful friend of this ministry for so many years if she should happen to see this I want to say happy birthday to her and if not I hope RJ will carry the message yes Tiffany and Isaiah's first birthday I didn't have that on the calendar yet but Isaiah has turned one year old and so we say happy birthday to Isaiah Hawk is leaving us tomorrow for a mission in Mexico he will only be gone through Saturday but he is going to meet up with a pastor friend of his from Iceland and we are believing that the Lord will use him in in Mighty and profound ways do you know how far from Mexico City the convention is about oh my about a four-hour drive outside of Mexico City so we want to be praying for Hawk we want to believe that God will protect him and the parties there Mexico is not a not the safest place in the world ever and unless you're in a resort but he will not be in the resort and so we ask that the angels of the Lord will be watching over him and protecting him and keeping him and we know they will let's stand I want us to sing a verse at least in a chorus of he lives he lives you might might remember in the podcast if you saw it how many of you have seen the whole podcast now I'm not asking if you watched it all at one time hold up your hand if you've seen all of it let me see who's seen part of it what's wrong with you all these are stories I've already heard well hear them again a young man who traveled with me sometime just just a short period of time I saw where he come in and he said I heard these stories but it sure did me good to hear them again and uh for every person who said I believe them I really appreciate that the vote of confidence let's sing this you might have heard in that podcast I mentioned going up to the Baptist I think I did I meant to going up to the Baptist pastor when I was just a few years old and telling him one day I'm going to have your job well I also told him if you'd sing he lives a little more there might be something going on in this church because I was there one Sunday and the choir sung he lives he lives and those Baptist people look like finally they believed something I said there'd be a little more life around here if the choirs sing that more often so let's sing a verse of it in memory of brother book I serve a risen savior he's in the world today I know that he is living no matter what men they say I see I see his hand of Mercy I hear his voice of cheer and just the just the time I need help he's always near Christ Jesus lives today he walks with with talks with me a long life's narrow way he lives he lives salvation to Empire you asked me how I know healing he lives where there my heart in all the world around me I see his loving care and though my heart grows weary I never will despair I know that he is pleading through all the stormy blasts the day of his appearing has come has come at last he lives he lives Christ Jesus lived he walks with me yes a long life's narrow way he lives he lives salvation to him heart you ask me how I know he lives he lives within my heart one more verse Rejoice Rejoice oh Christian [Music] Eternal hallelujah's Eternal Hallelujah Jesus Christ [Music] he lives Christ Jesus he was a long life's narrow way he lives he lives salvation [Music] heart you ask me how I know he lives Within [Music] my heart [Music] a praise [Music] thank you [Applause] Hallelujah nobody can tell it like you can tell it let's thank the Lord for these musicians [Applause] lest remain standing for the reading of God's word Leviticus chapter 23 beginning in verse 9 now I've been calculating a little something and and here we go last Sunday morning I didn't preach two hours Tuesday night I didn't preach an hour I got three hours in my account I hadn't got there Megan by the way thank you for setting off the alarm last Sunday morning since you said that and then two hours from today so I've got five hours today God is so good to me I ought to just start in Genesis Leviticus chapter 23 beginning in verse 9 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak until the children of Israel and say unto them when you become into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest I want to read that last phrase again then ye shall bring a Sheaf let's say that a sheath of not a chief a Sheaf remember the old song bringing in the sheaves so that's what we're talking about then you shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest you see today is the day of the Feast of first fruits it is and so this is irrelevant scripture for us today speak unto the children of Israel okay the next verse and he shall wave the Sheaf now you've got to see what a Sheaf is in your in your mind I didn't get a picture of a Sheaf for you but you know at Harvest Time you'll see especially in the fall they'll they locked a bundle corn together and show you what a Sheaf looks like they they put a twine around the middle of it and stand it in the field now when we're talking about the Feast of unleavened bread during the month of Habib which means ripe we're talking about the barley Harvest there's there it is beautiful beautiful way I believe that let me see that again yes I believe that's probably wheat and uh the wheat is a little later than the barley the wheat will be about 50 days from now when we celebrate the Feast of Shavuot which is Pentecost and so on Pentecost wheat was waived before the Lord already in baked loaves but in the time of first fruits which was during the Feast of unleavened bread which we call Passover Passover is one day the Feast of unleavened bread a whole week and it consummates doesn't always end but consummates on the first day after the weekly Sabbath which is today that you would gather The Barley the priest would go out in the field and there would be somebody among them appointed probably one of the one of the Lesser priests and what I mean by what I mean by that is serving in a lower position for now he would go out and go among the The Barley plants and he would pluck The Barley that was ripe and he would tie it together with a twine and stand it in the field and then as we read there would be a celebration a ceremony of sort where those barley sheafs would be waved over the field the whole field all the little heads of grain would be down in their Growing Place and that wave Sheaf offering would take place unto the Lord it was a prophetic message to the people and to the to the grain it said to the people harvest is coming this is the beginning of the Harvest not the end it said to the to the rest of the grain just like this grain that has been waved over you today has come to its maturity you will also re reach your maturity so as as we know the priest of the Lord would thank God for the early Reigns and they would call on the Lord for the latter Reigns and so every part of this is very significant and very prophetic so I want you to see the Sheaf charity showed you a picture and I want you to see the priest holding that Sheaf in his arms something like this and he is waving it over the crop and giving praise to Adonai oh Father of the Harvest thank you for the ripening of the Grain and thank you that in the same manner this grain has become right the rest of the seed will also become right and will also be harvested unto Yahweh now we have something to be thankful for when we look at this picture and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you he is doing it on behalf of the worshiper and because the priest is faithful to carry out his duty it brings an acceptance of the worshiper he is accepted as though he gave an offering because the priest represents in this place the worshiper to be accepted for you on the moral after the Sabbath which is Sunday the priest shall wave it and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheath and he lamb not she a helam without blemish of the first year for a and hola remember last Saturday night and Ola a burnt offering unto the Lord I want you to use the language of offering because the word in Hebrew that we sometimes translate sacrifice gives us an entirely different picture than an offering this was not a sa even the lamb being given to the Lord bled out and burnt on the altar even the lamb being burned was not a sacrifice yes the lamb sacrificed his life but it was an offering unto the Lord and that is why in the new Temple there will be offerings unto the Lord and many struggle with that and you hear many people saying there will never be another lamb slain there will never be another well I want you to know that if the Jewish people have their way they will continue to offer offerings unto the Lord even when they have recognized Yeshua as the sacrificial lamb now this is not to dispute anything that has already been spoken but it is to say that they are not looking at every time a lamb is is killed as a sacrifice sometimes it is just the giving of an offering if you study with a Hebrew root scholar you would understand that they use the word offering instead of the word sacrifice all right so a a he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word I almost forgot you were standing you may be seated and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenths deals a fine flower mingled with oil it almost sounds like somebody's making biscuit flower mingled with oil and offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet Savor have you ever been in the house when the bed was bed when the bread when the British some of you look like you need the bed when the bread was baking oh what a smell I live sometime in the wrong house because there are many days that my house smells like bread and I am very often told this goes to somebody else this is Mariah's business and this goes to the well or this one goes to sister so and so that one belongs to brother so and so and so I have to smell it sometime that sweet saver did you know even the lord loves the smell of baking bread and sometimes I don't get to taste it but every now and again we she'll get around them sometimes Stacy has to get in and make sure that we have some and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of a hen this is a measurement in the time of the scripture and ye shall this is verse 14. and ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn nor green ears until the self-same day that ye have brought an offering unto your god notice what he's saying to us are you with me notice what he's saying to the children of Israel here he's saying you don't participate and partake of harvest until the Lord has gotten his part this is tithe did you know the giving of your tithe is an honorable Memorial of a first fruit unto the Lord the scripture tells us so so we're giving God a portion of the Harvest listen and believing that if we give God what belongs to him he will bless the rest of the money and that 90 percent will spend in a greater way than the than the hundred percent you believe God does that for people this is why JCPenney was able to turn things around and give God 90 percent and live on ten percent because he learned as a businessman early that if you'll give God what rightfully belongs to him and thank him every time he blesses you with a job you'll never be sorry and God will bless you and help you till maybe you get to the place that you can give God another two percent or another three percent how many of you'd like to be in such a place now those of you who round your tithe I mean excuse me those of you who who feel it's necessary to give God fifty dollars and eleven Cent it's going to be very quiet here if you want God to bless you if you're interested in learning how to get that thing moving then go ahead sometime and round that living sin up to the next dollar and say to the Lord Lord I want you to know that I'm keeping Covenant with you and I understand that I could never out give you and so I'm going to put a little extra in my tithe because I want you to know I'm depending on you my preacher said if I'll give God what belongs to him he'll bless what's left I don't preach on tithe very often it's nothing but the truth when I'm asked what to give God I say everything God blesses you with you give him somehow find a way to give him a first fruits of that if you have to calculate the value of something that's given to you and put that in monetarily do it or if you've got some other way when the when the vegetables start coming in I have people bring vegetables I'm not out for veg veggies but I have people that bring them in and they say this is the first fruits of the Harvest there is something you ought to know about first fruits it doesn't represent just the first to become ripe scripturally it represents the best of the crop [Music] so there is a mindset that comes with giving God a first fruit offering if it's truly a first fruit I'll show you that in Hebrew in just a moment you're giving God something that is that is the best of the best so of that which he gives you first you go through that and you give God the best of the best as a first fruit offering unto the Lord and and when you do that even under this Covenant of Grace when you do that you'll see the blessings of the Lord in your life are there any blessed people here is mighty quiet are there any blessed people here you let God you give God something if he blesses you with a job somebody said I don't think uh the children ought to give a tithe on their on their uh grass cutting money or their bread baking money or I think you ought to teach them from the time you can teach them to give God what belongs to him and that's why you'll see 11 cents as in a tithe envelope and nobody cares one ounce about that living sin if that comes from a child then it comes from what they've got and what they've gotten what they've received and we're just as thrilled when that comes in as we possibly could be because it reminds us that even the little ones are learning what it means to honor God we adults can give God an extra 50 Cent from time to time I don't know why it's so quiet you show me the verse that says to the penny now he goes on here and we learn a lot about the Feast of first fruits first fruits let me say it this way first fruits is a Biblical concept that can be used or utilized at any time of the year in other words we there for a while on the first Sunday of the month brother Greeley would say let's instead of going to you for your tithe and offering you come up here as a as a as a first fruits as a remembrance you you're you're giving it to the Lord you're bringing it as the scripture said to the Lord and we did that for many many months maybe a few years just to remind you that this is a time where you are remembering you are commemorating the biblical concept of giving God first fruits let me read you the definition from the Hebrew we're going to get to something in a minute but I had to lay this Foundation the first fruits is the firstborn of the flocks are the first vegetables or the first of the grains that are gathered at Harvest Time thought of as belonging to God this is from the Hebrew in a special sense first fruits is from the Hebrew word bakur which means the first fruits of the crop it also means the beginning the first and the choicest so that's why I said in the concept of first fruits it's not just because you have taken it first but you have taken the first the priest was to take the first but I guarantee you when he made that sheath and waved that before the Lord there weren't any broken stalks there weren't any any heads of barley that had kernels missing because he was giving this unto yah and and therefore he wanted to not only give the first that was ripe he wanted to give God the best of the first that was ripe how many of you believe that sounds right it sounds right to me choicist it comes from a root in Hebrew the word bakar which means to burst the womb it means to bear or make early fruit it can be of a woman it can be of a tree in scripture the male the firstborn of the male was given to the Lord how many of you remember that concept of giving the first male to the Lord then he was redeemed with silver you gave him to the Lord and then with silver you went to the priest and bought him back so that you could raise him as a servant of Yahweh a servant of God but he was to be given he's the one who broke the womb first the scripture uses in King James the word Matrix which is which is uh most likely the cervix of a woman and it means the the the child that has broken that first that has come forth but it also can mean the Apple the apples that have become right first or the wheat stalks that have become ripened first then there is another word that is sometimes used for first fruits in Hebrew and it is rasheth and it means which means the first in place time order or rank specifically as a first fruit offering and the root of that word in Hebrew is Rosh now how many of you are familiar with the Hebrew word rosh as in Rosh Hashanah and that means what anybody remember it means head it doesn't mean New Year it means the head of the year because in in Hebrew there are multiple New Years how many of you remember that there is a civil New Year and that is what we celebrate when we look at rosh Rush the head of the year when when we come to Nissan which is the Hebrew month that we are in now it is the Hebrew month of Passover it is the Hebrew month of the Feast of unleavened bread it is the Hebrew a month of the Feast of first fruits when we come to that it is also the head of the year the Bible tells us so it is the it is the beginning of the religious or spiritual New Year so did you know right now we are in a New Year spiritually according to the Bible the Bible said this now some people say that's for the Jews I want you to know it wasn't just for the Jews it was also for the strangers in your midst now you come Tuesday night and the Lord willing I'll show you some of that because I wanted to speak today on Passover I really wanted to show you why Passover is so significant and so important and why we must at the very least we must remember it every year it may not be necessary to always have a Seder because a Seder is a rabbinical tradition that is not mentioned in the Bible and so we can do a Seder I love teaching from a Seder but it is not a Biblical commandment the biblical commandment is to remember to celebrate and if anybody oh my in all of those Jewish homes a few nights ago around the world when they gathered around the table and they had the Seder plate in place and they ate of the mara I I just tell you there's not going to hardly be a year go by that there's not at least harosith at my house that is part of the seder meal and it goes on the plate and that is that um that is an amazing Apple salad apple wine cinnamon golden raisins and walnuts and honey now somebody tell me what's wrong with that you just have to watch my wife because she'll go by the refrigerator she said as long as it's in there I can't forget it she'll keep a spoon handy I said now honey it ain't the honey you're after make sure you don't keep digging down too deep in that in that salad because you know what sits down in the bottom that's the wine that represents the mortar of the bricks that the Israelites spent many years in hard labor and hard slavery to to serve Pharaoh paying for some of their some of their sin and and suffering in such a horrible way but God had a deliverer he was building on the backside of the desert how many of you are glad that God always prepares a deliverer in every season in every season God has a deliverer in my life he has sent deliverers he has sent those who had a word from the Lord for me just in time I call them deliverers I say they've been Moses unto me we know we have a messenger who has been a Moses unto us but he wasn't the only deliverer in fact he told us that our Joshua was the Holy Ghost how many of times has the holy helped me a little bit I'm going to preach you might as well enjoy it get in here a little bit how many times has the Holy Ghost come and made a way for you when it looked like there was no way when it looked like everything was shutting down and life would never be the same again and the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came to your rescue brought a word brought somebody inspired you with the preaching of the word the Holy Ghost lets you sit under a holy ghost anointed song that spoke directly to your heart my we're blessed to have our Joshua we're blessed to have the Holy Ghost now in in this Feast of first fruits it's such a beautiful thing it's beautiful in in the Feast of unleavened bread it's beautiful and shoveled it's also beautiful in Tabernacles I was one time caught in the old city of Jerusalem it was one of those rare occasions that we brought a vehicle into the old city there are only so many roads that you can travel on by car in The Old City it was one of those rare occasions that we came in Zion gate and we made our way through the Armenian quarter and I don't even remember exactly why we had brought the vehicle in maybe to pick up something but I was there with a few brothers and it was the Feast of Tabernacles time and I didn't know that they were having a pageant at the at the courtyard of the Western Wall and that school children had been bussed there from all over Israel to reenact oh my to reenact this ceremony that takes place first fruits at Tabernacles time when the grapes are ripe when the pomegranates are ripe when the dates are ripe and and so we literally sister Nancy was still alive she was driving the vehicle and we literally got surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of children there was no way to move forward don't miss this there was no way to move forward there was no way to move backwards there was no way to pull to the right or the left you just sat there for several hours we sat there as the children come down out of the out of out of uh Jaffa gate all the way through the old city down by Zion gate down near the dung gate which is down near the cartel the Western Wall and they are bringing baskets full of pomegranates and grapes and dates and jars of honey it's the most beautiful thing you've just about ever seen in your life and they were bringing it as I need your help now they were bringing it as worship unto the Lord worshiping the Lord by nging the first fruit they knew God wasn't going to consume that it would be given to the needy but it was the reenactment and the celebration of the first fruits that can happen at any season of the year according to what is becoming right but there was one time there was one particular time that on the Feast of unleavened bread a meal was taking place near Bethany where Jesus and his disciples were going through what we call a Seder but it predates the actual seder ceremony that is used today but it is a remembrance with the cups and with the breaking of unleavened bread and the cups of wine and when Jesus got to the third cup the cup of of redemption and he began to to pray the blessing Blessed Are You O Lord our god king of the universe who brings forth fruit from the vine as he gets ready to make that blessing over the grape juice the wine he he says something extra this time that has never been said before this cup every year of his young life hear me I'll do more on this Tuesday night I'm on page one of 15 pages for this morning I gotta hurry every year of his young life 30 plus years he has celebrated with his family and friends the cup of redemption one night of the year the night of the Feast of unleavened bread the night of Passover he has done that time and time again the same blessing prayed over that cup year after year after year and everybody takes a drink of that cup and they move on to the next cup which is the cup of halil how many of you know what halil means it means praise halil that's where we get halil ooh yeah praise to God hallelujah Hallelujah I like when somebody says hallelujah I do real well in the Spanish type culture Portuguese type Hallelujah or or Hallelujah it's praise to God and every year they pass that cup the cup of praise and the scripture tells us that in this moment he said this cup is the New Covenant in my blood no longer just wine this represents more than just a fruity drink with a little bit of fermentation in it this represents my blood which is shed for you he takes the matsote the unleavened bread and he breaks it He blesses it Blessed Are You O Lord our god king of the universe who who brings forth bread from the Earth and he says to them this is my body this no longer just represents the bread of haste why is the bread unleavened at Passover time because the children of Israel didn't have time to linger to tarry anybody with me I don't really feel too many but I'm hoping you'll jump in here in a minute I think some are afraid to really help me and pull a little bit because you're afraid you might get too many hours out of me oh this is life to me I can't speak for you it's life for me when I see Jesus I don't have any I should have brought some zamatza today but when you hold a piece of modern matzah in your hand and you know that every Jew around the world is eating that bread this week and they go always remember a Jew believes that you should build walls around the law and if the law requires little you go way overboard so I have to watch Christians I have to watch Christians who get some understanding and some interest in these beautiful typology these beautiful symbols because if you're not careful they'll go way too far they'll try to drag us back under the law they'll miss the messenger to the church age they'll Miss what has happened don't you dare let any symbol or let any ceremony of scripture or celebration or commemoration of any day or any holy day don't you ever let any of that take away from Jesus Christ he's a living bread he's no longer laying on a dish on the table he's living in The Believer but don't miss the beautiful sacred lessons that we learn all right I see the juice holding this piece of bread in their hand as they have held for many many years now once baked in ovens at home and now much easier purchased from why you can buy the most famous of the matzus here made in New York City it's shipped to Israel even you can buy it at Publix the very kind that the most Orthodox of the Jews like to use and you hold that piece of bread in your hand and I want you to know you can see the stripes where the oven there's a piece of it see those see those brown Stripes coming down the Hat and a Jewish man holds that in his hand and he doesn't remember Isaiah 53 like you and I remember I say but he was wounded he was straight discretion how many of you see those holes that's pierced you're holding a piece of striped and pierced bread in your hand that represents what Yeshua what Jesus said it did when he gave it to his disciple this is my body broken for you taking it Have We Become cannibalist no sir he's talking of a spiritual truth remember when Jesus turned to his disciples and said you must eat my body you must drink my bread drink my blood and they the Bible said because of this saying why because the law of Moses condemns the drinking of blood it condemns the tasting of blood or the mingling of blood and did you know a religious Jew today would bleed to death before they would take their finger you you ever pricked your fingering first thing you do hold it up to your mouth and just put a little suction there to try to pull that out and stop the bleeding caught encouraging the blood to clot a religious Jew would never do such a thing because they don't believe in tasting blood or or consuming blood that way why because the Bible tells us that something is in that blood the life of the of the creature the life so to consume animals blood that's why a Jewish man eats meat that has been killed in a Jewish uh butcher shop blessed by the priest because it has to be not only slain but it has to be hung in a certain way that all the blood comes out of it and so for Jesus second temple period man living as a Jew [Music] of course he was living as a Jew I can't imagine why anybody would have any of random said he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was of a different seed that is exactly right his body was not Jewish his blood was not Jewish but he was a man living a Jewish life or he could have never been the Messiah that's what the scripture tells us actually and so they they said I can't have anything to do with this and the Bible said many of them which walked with him walked with him no more and he turned and he said to this Inner Circle aren't you going to leave me also oh Lord where can we go if we left you where would we go for thou alone have the words of eternal life that's why this little bride is still running after Jesus [Music] that's why the Living Word is our absolute that's why we're still eating the flesh and drinking the blood that's why we're still feasting on the living carcass The Living Word of God the bleeding he said the bleeding word of God we do that because in him everything that we have need of is found and so this ceremony took place and the Bible said they they sung a hymn which is something the Jews did after every Passover Gathering and that hymn would have been one of the Psalms that make up the allele which is that special group of Psalms in the Bible that they call the songs of ascent that Jewish pilgrims would always sing on their way up to Jerusalem Jerusalem being the highest place in the land of Israel and they're always going up when they leave their homes to go and worship there so they sing the Psalms of ascent the wonderful praise can you imagine living in that hour and hearing those Jewish people come together from all over the land singing the songs of praise it must be like a Sunday morning around here just multitude by the multitude magnified or multiplied by the by the multitude and then you know and we will talk about this Tuesday night perhaps you'll know you'll understand that he was as as every Passover Lamb has over a Paschal Lamb I think most of you know that in most every language in the world there is no word Easter I think most of you know that in almost every language of the world the word to describe the resurrection is pasca or Pascal which is referring to the sacrifice of the Lamb so or Pasha In some cultures it's called Pasha and it's describing this weekend in English and a few other languages they have borrowed a word from paganism I don't care how many articles you see telling you that Easter is not a pagan name it is it is the goddess of fertility somebody said but brother Branham said happy Easter and I say that's all right I might have said happy Easter back but I'm now many years after that I understand that it is not the most appropriate word to use and let me ask you a question I'm not going to go there some of you are already Dr I'm dragging some of you every inch of the way and I certainly don't want to go somewhere that would make you even be more quiet intense but I I must say why is it that even some of our Believers find it necessary to greet us today by saying happy Easter and happy Resurrection Day when I woke up this morning I saw so many of the message Believers saying things like happy Easter and happy Resurrection Day are you just trying to to remember a few of us Rebels are or do you truly know in your heart [Music] perhaps you truly know in your heart there's a better word to describe this weekend somebody said what is it Feast of first fruits [Music] that's what we're celebrating today we're celebrating the resurrection I don't even if I were if I was gonna say something about a particular day I would call this Resurrection Day but then I would wonder what tomorrow is oh yeah isn't tomorrow Resurrection Day isn't Tuesday Resurrection Day because it's not a day in the first place Resurrection is a person Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life the African bride knows better than Easter the Asian bride knows better than Easter the the Hispanic bride knows better than Easter what's wrong with the American bride what's wrong with the Canadian bride now let's move on not for lack of good things to say I got plenty of good things to say I want you to go to Mark chapter 16. are you too tired for preaching today some of you are tired I've had to clap my hands to wake some of you up but I love you that's why I did it Mark chapter 16. verse 1 and 2 and when the Sabbath was passed now maybe I should just say here that's a problem with a message like this there's so many things to say foundationally because we didn't get to speak on the Passover last Sunday morning as we planned and I don't want to take too much time to do that now but here is where a lot of confusion has come in concerning the day of the crucifixion I have taught on this you can find I don't know where I don't know what name I don't know where to find it but I have taught on the Holy Week I have taught on the sequence of events I have made many enemies because the first thing they say was you're contradicting brother Branham and that would never be my goal that would never be my purpose but I am one of those hard-headed men who do not believe in Good Friday one of the reasons why I don't is I'm a purist which means I believe the word stands alone in its purest form my interpretation of the word must line up with the word itself and Jesus is very clear when he's teaching about Jonah in the belly of the whale how long the son of man must be in the belly of the Earth three days and three nights the modern Church tells us and this is totally erroneous there's no truth to this statement that I'm about to make that in Hebrew that any portion of a day constituted today that's absolutely false and that was taken from Roman culture not Hebrew has nothing to do with Hebrew has nothing to do with the Greek New Testament there's no such idea in Hebrew that you take any portion of a day you've got the whole day and there's no uh understanding in Hebrew I'm in trouble that any portion of a night is a whole night but even if there were if that was true how many nights from Friday at 3 until let's just say until he rose Friday night Saturday night I'm sorry that doesn't fit the church interpretation I'm sorry that you may have some quotes that mention something a little different than that I can't preach what I can't see I'm responsible I felt like an Apostolic father the other day commending the church in tema you know when I first went there there are a small group of people but several times through the years the Lord used me to prophesy growth and expansion and brother Pastor Tay will tell you he told you when he was here that brother Shelley looked out into One Direction and he looked out in the other direction and he said one day I see them clear out that way and clear out that way in chairs and now the church is shaped just like that because what used to be the platform now sets in the middle of the church and now it is a huge facility of which you only saw a very small portion you didn't even see the whole front of the church you just saw a small portion on the front and I remember there's an air conditioner sitting on the platform now to cool the preachers and guess how I go virtually screen in the pulpit I mean God has blessed them with Souls not just materials Souls it's a fine fine building and on the pulpit it says something like this the Bible is our absolute [Music] and I felt like an Apostolic father the other day commending the church because if you have that understanding no wonder why hell fights you because we have no other absolute than the Bible everything the messenger said must line up with the Bible if we don't understand it we don't contradict it or point out the mistakes but we can't preach either what we don't understand or what does not exactly fit the scripture so for me to preach to you today that he was crucified on Friday Rose early on Sunday morning only gives two nights and Jesus himself gave the pattern three days and three nights as Jonah in the belly of the whale the son of man in the belly of the Earth now that should sell it but I don't didn't mean to say all that it wasn't in my notes but I said all that to say another thing that people forget is in the week of past Passover there are two sabbaths not just the weekly Sabbath Friday night it's Sunday on to Saturday night at sundown but there is a weekly Sabbath and when the Bible said he had to be taken down because it was the day of preparation for the Sabbath The Greek mind hundreds of years 325 A.D the Greek mind said okay that has to be Friday because Friday is the day before the Sabbath but the Hebrew mind knows that in the week of pesach Passover unleavened bread there are two sabbaths the High Sabbath of the holiday and the weekly Sabbath and he had to be crucified on the day before and taken down off the cross and already placed in the Tomb before the day of the of the High Sabbath not before the day of the weekly Sabbath if it was the day of the weekly Sabbath you cannot get relations right now I can show you a timeline but not today now Mark 16 1 2 and when the Sabbath was passed Saturday Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day not in mark the first day of the week they came unto the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun what does verse 3 say could you find it can someone read it out of your Bible they're worried about who is going to roll away the stone I'm not going to read the rest of that but if I should read the rest of it what will I find that when they got there at sunrise he was already gone [Music] because there was no Gregorian calendar Pope Gregory had not come along yet that's where it comes from it's Catholic just like Good Friday do you remember any of you remember in the 90s when I stayed in trouble all the time this is not some new doctrine we've been preaching this since God revealed it to us late 80s early 90s so yes a bit of a trailblazer but still find it very dangerous when you're tipping over sacred cows if you would have told me then that there would be more Catholicism around the message today than there was then I would have never believed it but the truth is there's more Catholicism around the message of the hour than there ever was before because you touch somebody's Easter bonnet you're not dealing with just a brother anymore you're dealing with a bear that's how hard they'll fight for something that has no historical root except post nicaea and if if nicaea is responsible for the twisting of the godhead how can I trust nicaea how can I trust the early church fathers if they can't teach the right godhead and the right baptism how can I trust their interpretation of holidays including Holy Week the Bible says here that very early as the sun was coming up the women get to the tomb just before their Easter Sunrise Service wants to begin and what they found was an empty tomb now let's read it in Luke excuse me let's read it in John no I think I I think I meant to say I think I I put John but I I think I was going to put something else to be back I'll just take a little water while I'm back here I won't take time to get a red hot but I'll get water you all still here um that old virus may have delayed us but it didn't stop us now that was Mark now it might be luke I wanna read I don't I don't think it was John I picked up John for another reason yeah yeah it is John John chapter 20. verse 1. the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early The sun hadn't risen yet it is the rising of the Sun s-o-n but the son Rose before the issue in that morning oh that was good if we wanted to make enemies that'd be a good meme on that one that one on that one morning the son Rose before the s-u-n because we know by scripture that the evening and the morning are the first day when the sun uh the day according to scripture doesn't begin at sunrise it begins at sunset and so very shortly after sunset the s-o-n INE got up very early when it was yet dark they got to the Sepulcher and guess what they found that even before the sun was up it was still dark and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulcher Hallelujah how many of you love the word then she runeth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciples whom Jesus loved who was at John and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him oh she didn't have Abraham's faith she didn't have Resurrection faith that morning she thought his body had been stolen and put in another place Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple John and came to the Sepulcher they ran on so they ran both together and the other disciple John No Doubt the Bible is clear and John is writing the book so he gets to tell it like it really was when I tell my story I'm going to tell it like it really was [Applause] they both ran together and the other disciples he didn't care if his name was in it or not but he wanted him to know that he outrun Peter that extra donut didn't hinder John that morning he did outrun Peter and came for pink replica and he's stooping down and looking in saw the linen cloth lying yet when he not in then cometh Simon Peter following him he says it again always a late Comer and went into the Sepulcher and see if the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself they went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulcher and he saw [Music] John didn't say oh where have they laid him John didn't say where have they stolen him away too he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must Rise Again from the dead then the disciples went away again unto their own home now they might not have ever read it in the scripture but they heard what he said they just heard it with natural ears he said just just a little piece from now not one stone that you see in this Temple is going to be sitting on top of one another but don't you worry because in three days I'll raise it up again this spaky of his own body he wasn't talking about just the temple in the natural he was talking about the temple of God then the disciples went away again unto their own home let's catch eight more verses but Mary stood without it the Sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the Sepulcher and see if two angels in white sitting don't be so sure you know anything about angels they don't all look the same foreign they don't all behave the same I met an angel in the spirit not too too long ago and he baffled my mind I I want to tell this I've wanted to tell it and I don't want to tell it but he baffled my mind he was unlike any other Angel of the Lord that I had ever met before and I didn't even know that there could be a non-holiness angel he was holy but he wasn't holiness not by Earth standard he was holy but when he appeared to me he appeared to me with a bare chest and I want you to know the fear of the Lord struck me to my knees be careful what you what you think when you think you have learned something about angels for there are many many many Heavenly hosts there are many Heavenly Creatures yes when the Bible said Heavenly Host he doesn't just mean myriads of angels that all look alike and talk a light and sound to light and dress alike and act alike there's angels of his presence that Usher us into the presence of the Lord but there's also warring angels [Applause] and I met mine for the first time in my life and I want to tell you something everything is going to be all right [Applause] when I got up over my knees I said I have no need to worry because everything is going to be all right the Lord is the Lord of hosts the captain of the whole the lord of the battle and with an angel like that I see some of you looking strange well I had an experience in Jerusalem where Angels crowded into my bedroom it's written you can read it for yourself Angels Came one morning and crowded into my bedroom and I had never seen such an Eclectic group of of anything in all my life and and I was most delighted to find that some are Hefty some have been eating too much show bread if you know what I mean a literally were heavy and they were all coming in rushing in I shouldn't have told that this morning but I should have I should have judged the looks on some of your faces when I described an angel without his shirt on he must have been cutting the grass like brother Brandon because brother Branham didn't wear his shirt to cut the grass but he didn't parade up and down the street trying to be sexy did he neither did this angel he wasn't coming to be attractive he was coming to let me know that he had been specially built I'll go a little bit further than that I put my finger in his belly and my finger buried up in his AB between his abdominal muscles my finger went in because he was so well defined and so strong I could say it's something else but I won't there was a fragrance like I have never smelt before God was he sent me that just like he sent me those angels in Jerusalem I'm I I anyway I'm not going to do a disclaimer now he wanted me to know and they were giggling yes these Angels were pushing in and as one by one and you'd think that there couldn't be a room for another one but here come another one and another one until they were literally standing in my bedroom in Jerusalem and some of them were twisted like this because there were so many in such a small space and the Lord began to reveal to me can you all find me the scripture where it says they have longed to look into this is what God gave me that morning I'm already over time and over over over theology some way past some people's theological let me see if all my streamers have left me too any of your streamers still out there I could use an amen I could over down the eight on Facebook I hope it's not because they've moved on to the Easter egg hunt nine somebody just jumped on Facebook then are we getting any preach it somebody said that's all I needed to hear there's 30 or more on YouTube I don't know how many on the app first Peter is it would you just put it up unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven read the next phrase the Lord spoke to my heart and he said they follow the Heirs of salvation they want to see and understand what makes you who you are and when God is doing something Redemptive in your life even the angels come close even the angels come close to look in to see what God is doing in you if that don't bless you you're unblissable today to think that God is doing such a beautiful work in your life it is that angels have desired to come and look in and see what the Lord is doing in you it's 150. let's go back to my I mean I can't I can't finish I hadn't preached on first fruits see two angels sitting in White in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lained he's not there no more but the angels are still still hovering near where his body laid there's a message there but we'll move on and they say unto her woman the angel woman why weep is thou just like they didn't know she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him John is out there believing Peter's scratching his head wondering what's going to happen to him if Jesus has risen from the dead he's out there wondering I may be big trouble John is praising God for letting him be a believer and the women are still trying to figure out where they've hit him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing not in the Tomb outside the tomb and he looked different than he did when he went in the Tomb and she didn't even know it was him let's read on Jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir I'm glad she didn't compliment his roses she said sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away Jesus saith unto her Mary I assure you he didn't the name Mary had not even been formed it was a Greek name but it actually followed this time period we have a Greek New Testament so translated Greek to English it says Mary her name was Mary but in Hebrew her name was Miriam Jesus said unto her Miriam and it's kind of like the little kid in the in the shook who says Abba EMA in the in the mom or the dad can distinguish that sheep's cry from all the other sheep that are crying there was something about the way she said he said there was something about the way he said her name Miriam or Mary if he had a little bit of a drawl and I think maybe he did he said Mary am she turned herself and saith unto him raboni Rebel not rabbi rabbi it's teacher it's master try it sometime oh master rabonai Rebel nigh the next verse and Jesus saith unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father I could preach all day long on this for I am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and to your God Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her I wonder how they responded I wonder if they all believed her I wonder if you take this to the Chosen and your concept of of the disciples from The Chosen and how they how they because Mary was a broken woman I wonder if there was some doubt among them and and I wonder if there was any vying among them well why why would he reveal himself to her first I don't know it doesn't matter John didn't need John didn't need him to say johannen he just saw the empty tomb I'm a Believer Peters this is true he may hand me my hand in on a platter I may be getting in trouble and Mary dear Gardener where have you taken the Lord but when he called her name it changed everything now I want you to know that he could not fulfill the Feast of firstfruits by raising from the dead alone he then had to be raised up and waved over the heads of the congregation whether they saw it or not how many of you know a few days later I don't have time to go there but how many of you know a few days later Thomas is troubled Jesus comes to the disciples in an upper room in a chamber somewhere and he doesn't use the door he just walks through the wall [Music] which is a lot easier than most people could begin to realize he just walked right through the wall find it give me the scripture I didn't I didn't pull it up because I wasn't going to preach on it I was going to preach on first fruits we could come back and 20 and 19. we could come back in a few hours to do some more we got once a year to strike this John 2019 did you say all these 15 pages or 12 Pages whatever it was didn't do me much good did he 13 pages then the same day at evening being the first day of the week this is Sunday night when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you we got to go on and when he had so sad they showed unto them he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord can you imagine he had to show them proof because people walked through walls all the time think about it the word it's worded that way for you to get it can you get it he didn't come through the closed door he walked through the wall he's standing there and they still he still knows he knows he's got to prove himself and when he had so Sandy let's go on then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you Shalom that's my father has sent me even so send I you is Thomas coming up in this one go to 26 for me well well let's get this don't don't go away from that one charity we've really worked you haven't we smile a little bit and when he had said this he the Holy Ghost couldn't come down until he went up [Music] you think he ever breathed on any of the disciples before you think they ever smelt garlic on his breath before you think they slept close enough and lived close enough that they ever had an encounter with his breath before yes and they didn't receive the Holy Ghost did they but he has now become the first fruit offering he is now the first son to come to Resurrection and maturity he has now ascended to his father he did not ascend from the grave what happened in the grave he descended the most ridiculous thing is this this Catholic Church in all of her prostitute daughters have now been close it's Ash Wednesday and Monday Monday Thursday in the original it's an Ian mondi Thursday Good Friday silent Saturday well there wasn't a whole lot going on in the graveyard that you could hear but he was not silent brother Greeley told you he descended Into the Heart of the earth LED captivity captive gave gifts unto men [Applause] he walked right into Paradise there was only a gulf between paradise and Hell Abraham's bosom being Paradise hell being the place of Torment a great Gulf fix between them Jesus tells us I hear people talking about the parable of Lazarus except it wasn't a parable Lazarus wasn't a parable he was a real beggar that laid it a real rich man's table who wanted to come back from Paradise he wanted to leave Abraham's bosom and go tell his his proud haughty Brothers that there's a right way Jesus said if you should race from the dead they wouldn't believe you they wouldn't leave a man sent from the dead so he goes into Paradise and reveals himself to the Jews who have died under the Covenant think about it Abraham oh very I saw him on the mountain that's him yeah he was the ram called in the thicket I see him I know who he is Shadrach Meshach into bed and It Go said there he is that's the Fourth Man In The Fire Ezekiel said that's who he is the wheel within the wheel [Applause] Isaiah said there he is the conception of a virgin in the Holy Ghost no extra for that powerful David said he's the one that hovered over me as I sung his Praises on the hills of Zion for those of you who saw the podcast that's what I was preaching the night that brother and sister Cleveland came to my church The Way of Holiness Revival Center in South Carolina I was preaching that it was Easter Sunday night and I was preaching that message and that's what made them think or or maybe it was on the radio I'd said something like that on the radio I don't to be honest with you I'm pretty sure that's how it was I had preached that at our church on on Easter Sunday night and that part had played on the radio and she heard it that's how it was and that's what made her think that I had heard of brother Branham because he tells us that story several times of what it would have been like in Paradise as they began to see some powerful things took place right because then he marches down or before he marches over into hell carrying all of our sins with him he goes over and takes off the the look you know the devil don't even have the key to his own house because Jesus just walks Right Through the flames ain't nobody trying to stop him don't you get some drama in your mind there ain't no demon trying to stop him they've all rolled over he just walks right down through there I love I love you he just walks right down through the midst of them if you'd have heard anything it would have been because the Flames couldn't even touch him and he walks right over to Satan somebody said he snatched it didn't know didn't have to all they did was I don't even know if he said hand him over Devil's doing everything he can to hand the keys over to death Helen how do you know he still has them because he appears in Revelation with the keys of death Hell In The Grave he who Revelation 19 didn't it he who is faithful and true he's got him with him and then the Bible says maybe he stops back by Paradise I don't know the exact order of how things were but it could be that he stops back by paradise and hollers in the door come on y'all because he empties Paradise how do you know that because the Bible tells us that when that veil of the temple was written in Twain many of the Saints which slept a rose somebody said well that doesn't quite seem like the right order I don't understand how how all that happens maybe some maybe some were emptied out that we're going to see him in his glorified body and receive him through salvation on the earth maybe some of the older Old Testament Saints stayed there waiting on him I don't know how it happened but I know that in at least two installments he emptied it out what I know is there was nobody not one who said that ain't the one we've been waiting on [Applause] nobody stopped back into hell those that hadn't already left left with him that day he goes into the grave now this the Assemblies of God Church used to teach us that before he appeared in the resurrection he went to the father and he came back came back to the Earth that's what the church used to teach but we have a problem with that he said to Mary don't touch me I have not yet ascended to my father now let's read Thomas's story here we got to go home and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you then saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger behold my hands reach hither thy hand thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God you know the church has condemned Thomas they've called him an old doubter and harassed him and talked so bad about him I like to think I would have been a John probably would have been more like a Peter I'm in trouble now could have been like a Mary he's lost to us but I could have very possibly have been a Thomas didn't benefit from from some of the experiences of the other disciples and he was built differently than they were all built quite differently weren't they and he just wanted a little physical evidence just let me put my hand he didn't ask Jesus knew what he needed when I was seven years old and God filled me with the Holy Ghost the way he did he knew what I needed everybody don't get it the same way he knew what I needed so that I would never be talked out of it again God knew what Thomas needed so he would never be tucked talked out of it again so I have to be honest I have no judgment no condemnation on Thomas because I know some Thomases I saw some in here a moment ago and I talked about a bare-chested angel well you say but I've never seen a bare chested Angel nor had I but you do reach a place in your Supernatural walk with God where it's easier for you to believe than it is to misbelief I found the place that's all I'm saying I found that place when you come and tell me the Lord said he showed me I dreamed a dream I had a thought when somebody texted me Saturday night and said I saw the light I saw the color I saw this in the service when I hear the things that I hear on a weekly basis from people who have encountered the Lord in some way it is easier for me to believe that God has done that for you than it is for me to doubt somebody said well you're believing the Lord yes but I cannot imagine why anybody would want to lie about something that the Lord did I know there are people who've lied I know there are people who have scammed I know that in the 50s when brother Branham was having great healing lines and casting Devils out that there were some men on the field putting frogs in jars and telling people this is a demon that I cast out of a woman last night there were all kinds of things the sign of the blood where blood was flowing out of the palms of people's hands Stigmata I believe it's called and some of that may have been real I wasn't there but some of it was fate and when those healing evangelists came through Columbus and they caught him with a with a microphone and an earpiece and they told them don't you ever come back to this city again or we will run you out with tar and feather that man went on to have a very successful television Ministry but the people the the ushers were feeding him information because the technology had now come along that could fool the people when brother Branham was operating in the gift of the prayer card and knowing what was on the prayer card there was nobody to tell brother Branham what was on the card and some of the most profound Miracles were under were not even on a Prayer card or underneath the prayer card and some of the diseases that brother Branham called out were diseases that the people didn't want to mention because they thought it might put them to the end of the line they thought it might be too serious and if someone read that they would never get called because they weren't always calling them by numbers in the early days they weren't using the number system they were just randomly calling cards they were numbered but they were looking at the cards and calling people by the number where later he would say we'll take tonight prayer card 50 to 100. it was so Supernatural in brother branham's day that a man came and put a whole bunch of stuff on a card that wasn't real and he comes through the prayer line going to expose brother Branham as a fake and instead of brother Brandon praying over him for those diseases he said now God's going to make a sign of this and although you didn't come in here with those diseases you now have everything written on the card he sealed his faith as pretty serious Supernatural fooling around what does a man do when he never got to his punchline no no no you say that but I like to never got y'all going in the first place you ain't fooling me brother Austin I had to clap my hands for you would you wide awake now I saw one of those little memes one time said something like there's one in every Church and it was a little one one little sister or two crying out preacher stop now we got ours and I know they get judged sometimes sister Joyce and sister Sharon and sometimes sister flow and whoever else says preach on come on and Austin now that I've mildly whooped him let me let me let me let me prop him up he's one of the first to say come on but if I were to really kick in here I don't know what had happened musicians are coming Lord of Mercy so he went to the father he fulfilled the Feast of first fruits he became the Sheaf raised from the dead waved over the heads of the people he was the beginning can I just do a just another two or three minutes here he became to the beginning of the new creation Revelation chapter 3 verse 14. Jesus said red letter Amplified and to the angel messenger of the Assembly Church in laodicea right these are the words of the amen the trusty and faithful and true witness the origin and beginning an author of God's creation Jesus was the beginning of the father's creation he was a new creature he was a new creation in the message why it had to be Shepherd brother Branham said in paragraph 92 the first time Angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven if you look in Job 38 7 I see some of you taking notes when God first planned on making his first creation the Earth job was a great smart man and he had all kinds of wisdom he said when I go up to the markets the young princes they all bowed before me and just want a moment of my wisdom and he couldn't figure out why he had to be treated the way he was and so God asked him said gird yourself up like a man because I'm coming down to talk to you and when God came down in a whirlwind he said job where was you where were you before I laid the foundations of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together and uh that's not angels the angels are not the sons of God the Bible said as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God the sons of God are the redeemed and there they were before the world was being framed there they were shouting for Joy before the Living God where were you and he was deflated at that time where was you see the first time Angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven the next paragraph 94 there but the first time they ever sang on Earth was to Shepherds at the birth of God wasn't he Emmanuel on Earth first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble Shepherds now one more message and I'm closing I really am you better have a song Ben why it had to be Shepherd same sermon but paragraph 97 now notice God is fixing to make another creation here's what I've got to say if Jesus was the first fruits of them which slept in Corinthians says he was and we'll pick that scripture up he was the first son to come to full maturity and to defeat death with Resurrection Life then there had to be sons that would follow him remember firstfruits means if one man comes in the resurrection they're going to be others who come in the resurrection is that right and if we saw brother Branham being that son that came to maturity with the resurrection quickening power in his life and Ministry guess what that says to us it says there will be many more many more Sons will come Hallelujah and you're part of that I'll have to show you Tuesday Sunday sometime now notice God is fixing to make another creation he creating mortal Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he's singing to his subjects listen at this he's singing to his subjects through angels glory to God in the highest peace on Earth Good Will toward me brother Brandon said that was God singing to his subjects through angels on the earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life and see he sang they sang to the heavens when the Mortal creation come in and hear the immortal The Immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to Earthly people the first time to Shepherds striking isn't it verse 98 look at that he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us who who could think such a thing behold I will do a new thing in the Earth something that has never been done before here it is he started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelled Among Us that's the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ how many of you believe that you know what God is when you see Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed we're pushing toward that let's stand my I thought I would get farther oh I had some Commons I had some keep preachings I even had somebody say thank you Lord for this preacher somebody's thankful for me I love it thank you thank you thank you [Applause] isn't he good just a minute let me check on my youngins yes they're on the way there are only 399 miles away how do you know because I track them when Benjamin got married didn't he asked to come off the track he did not and Jenna asked to come on we're in a war I know it I know you're tired Ben you got a good song is that a yes sir no sir maybe sir let me see it I won't see it that'll work [Music] Calvary [Music] my savior [Music] and drenched in tears they laid him down [Music] the entrancy thy heavy Stone massage [Music] to Calvary where Jesus bled and died for me I see his worms his hands his feet My Savior all [Music] his body and drinks [Music] your sisters the entrances still [Music] in all the love alone oh praise the name of the Lord [Music] forever [Music] our God oh praise the name of the Lord our God [Music] oh Lord [Music] our God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh praise the name of the Lord our God [Music] our God [Applause] Oh Praise [Music] School praise His name before [Music] endless days [Applause] [Music] shall return [Music] the blazing sun shall pierce the night and I will rise [Music] Among Us [Music] of the Lord hallelujah praise His day foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] furthermore [Music] [Music] the angels for Christ the King [Music] foreign [Music] forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh Lord Oh Lord our God [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] the Bible says something that's very very powerful it's the reason why we remember the resurrection [Music] it's in First Corinthians chapter 15. we've got so much to be thankful for it says in verse 20 excuse me it says in verse 14. and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vein and your faith is also vain all the Miracles he did all the good words he said even the shedding of his perfect blood was not enough [Music] he would have been as another good man Remembered in death we would have no reason to Hope we would have no reason to have faith if if they would have got to that tomb and found him still there yea and we are found false Witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then it's not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain and listen to this ye are yet in your sins so just purchasing and redeeming it by the blood was not enough he had to keep all of his promise your faith would still be in vain you would still be in your sin then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable but look at this [Music] but now is Christ risen from the dead and not only that become the first fruits of them that slipped did you know that's why we can walk to the grave of our loved ones and Say Goodbye because we know that if Christ had power to raise himself up from the dead he has given us every one hope he will also raise our loved ones up and raise us up in the resurrection if you should get an opportunity to see his only son is that the title you should see it I was impressed with the few minutes before the movie when this young man comes out and gives his testimony of why he made the movie I was in I was as impressed with that as I was the movie and I like others there are things I would have changed and things I would have tweaked and things I had a hard time looking over I would have made that that scene where he sees the cross and the resurrection the empty tomb I would have made that a lot more of a to do it passed by so quick that you could hardly catch what was happening I didn't have no rewind button but if you get a chance to see it and support that man young man's Vision I want to support that young man's vision he said he's going to do Jacob and somebody got to him with some revelation because when that Ram is caught there and that Thicket and he goes into that flash of lightning and he sees the cross and he sees the empty tomb that's what I believe that's what I preached to you last Saturday night so you can imagine a preacher sitting there seeing his sermon being acted out I could look over some of the some of the acting and some of the other things and I could Rejoice that somebody caught us the inspiration of something so powerful Abraham was willing to give his only son he didn't have to but somebody had to aren't you glad he did aren't you glad the only son was given on your behalf and aren't you glad he didn't stay in the grave I want you to sing with me alive you can help us to be and I didn't mean to cut you out but I want us to sing that little chorus and clap our hands before we go home alive alive forevermore my Jesus is Alive I know that's old for some of you younger Crews but I love this little alive alive [Music] I will lie forever my Jesus is Alive oh Hallelujah [Music] my Jesus is alive forever Lord Saint Hallelujah sing Hallelujah my Jesus is Alive oh Alive Alive forevermore my Jesus is Alive [Music] forever more Justice let's celebrate him sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah my Jesus is alive forever [Music] let me hear you again [Music] Oh my Jesus alive alive alive my Jesus is Alive oh Hallelujah Hallelujah my Jesus is Alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's have brother Hulk come and stand among the brothers here and let's lay hands on him and uh there is a there I won't share this out because it's a sort of a private thing but there is a connection in in this that interests me greatly and I have watched God connect things and use one thing it's like dominoes I guess I should say the Domino Falls it knocks and and it just sets something in motion for the benefit of the kingdom of God and I wish sometime we could interpret it and understand all of these connections but we cannot always do that and but there is something about this little trip to Mexico for brother Hawk to assist and and be a blessing to this brother that that feels connective to me and I'm asking the Lord to cover them and of course protect them but to anoint them and I can't imagine that Hawk will not have an opportunity I believe he will for sure have an opportunity to share his test is it young people it's a young people it's both so it it is a time of of convention and we're just asking the Lord to anoint the ministry there and and particularly our brother Hulk if you feel that you would like to have a part of the fruit that comes out of it then you can give brother Hawk a Pentecostal handshake and with some money in it and uh if you need it to go through the church you'll have to make it out to the church and Mark on it for Hawk but if it's just cash and and you don't need particular credit for it you can hand it right to him I trust him I know that his expenses are going to be covered while he's there but the ticket was a little pricey and uh I would like that it not strained their finances in any way and I've already put a seed toward it and and maybe you want to do that and if you do feel free I'm not a jealous person I want that work and that convention to be blessed and I want our brother to know we're 100 behind him amen would brother Greely would you lay hands on our brother and with the rest of you Brothers just form a Presbytery around him and and you sister stretch your hands toward him and maybe you sisters near Maribeth uh or any of the kids would you lay your hands on them because I know there must be concern in her heart and let's pray the comfort of the Lord over them and the peace of God in their home father in the name of Jesus Christ we commission our brother now to go out from this place in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Bear witness of his testimony of what you have done in his life Lord may his hunger be contagious may his passion be catchable Lord may they Marvel as they hear of his wisdom the wisdom that you have given him the truth that you have revealed to him may he go forth he represents us as a family but he goes forth representing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the continuation of apostolic Ministry so Lord anoint him [Music] from the top of his head to the souls of his feet direct him and lead him and give him wisdom from on high protect his body in the name of Jesus and keep him from harm and from sickness we pray over the the pastor from Iceland who will be ministering there Lord Jesus use the gift that you have given to him let him be a blessing to those people there that he loves dearly watch over the group that comes and travels and gathers to be there let your anointing be there guard the mouths of the leaders and let there be nothing but truth spoken in that place in the name of Jesus Lord confirm our brother's testimony confirm it with signs and wonders and miracles even as you promised you would Lord if he would lay hands on the sick may they recover May there be confirmations of the life your life that he carries and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray hallelujah amen amen now greet him and greet Sister Mary Beth and let's believe the Lord let's believe the Lord to be with him now maybe you have a need and if you have a need the resurrected Lord is here you don't need my hands you need his touch is that right so let's agree right now for just a moment you can go back to your greeting in a moment let's agree right now father there are needs in this house their burdens that people carry but but it almost seems inappropriate to to go into every bit of that as we have remembered the resurrected Christ he lives in US and because you live in us we claim our healing we claim our deliverance we claim our encouragement we claim your leadership in our lives we lift up Caleb to you Lord right now in the name of Jesus deliver him from the oppressor just a young man impressionable and needs your absolute truth to break out in his life strengthen his mother I pray right now in the name of Jesus let us leave with the promise of your healing [Music] foreign [Music] Tuesday night at seven o'clock we're going to have been to come and lead us in in one last worship song you are to greet one another and love one another especially Hawking his family send him forth in the name of Jesus we thank God for bringing brother Billy through this week another another procedure and God has been faithful to him and has helped him so much and we're so thankful for that so we're going to have another worship song and and we're going to give God praise as we leave here today Tuesday night seven o'clock you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord [Music] Lord of lords and throughout [Music] eternity I'm going to praise him and forever more I will reign with him [Music] all hail King Jesus [Music] right more Stars [Music] around please [Music] I'm going to praise [Music] I [Music] am oh hell King Jesus [Music] [Applause] sin and foreign [Music] king of years [Music] I'm going to pray ers and forever foreign [Music] [Music] Bright Morning Stars [Music] eternity I'm going to pray [Music] reach your hand this way [Music] reach your hand this way [Music] I

the Lord is your servants [Music] Jesus [Music] King of Kings Bright Morning Stars [Music] foreign [Music] with him [Music] [Music] just play that keep playing that I want to just tell you you're always going to be opposed laughs first hell Satan demons they hate the call of God on your life because you're born a spiritual person you're always going to battle nerves it's going to feel like from time to time hopefully a few few and far between we will feel at times that you're losing your mind maybe you could you could afford to do a little of that because sometimes our mind in God's way I feel like I'm standing in a vision because I feel like I've seen this moment and I believe that it is the perfect will of God that you're here right now in this moment so I have to believe that God's going to do for you what you need him to do second of all you're going to be opposed because you know more and you believe more than the average person you can't come as close to truth truth and to fit in and it's a hard hard lesson to learn one that if we could spare you from we would have already done that it's not a bad thing a God thing you are called to preach his word the fullness of his word the fullness of his word and and man is not interested the fullness of his word they have to have the seed of God in them or they're not interested in the fullness of the word of God so they're going to oppose and they're going to puppet you they always will they did me when I was your age and younger they will try to hold the strains and as long as your mouth moves and they want it to move and says what they want you to say all is well but you just break out with a little something that's not status quo behave a little differently than the average Pentecostal and that spirit the ones who love you will oppose you the most the ones who stand on Sunday afternoon and tell you what a blessing you are and how much your sermon has meant to them and so thankful that God sent you to them their very the varying ones are the very ones same ones that in one moment's time will be from your best friend to your worst enemy this is just how religion works but I believe that God has met you today your your part of our family extended I respect your office as a pastor of a another church and I don't know how in the world you got here because I thought you were having service at your church today which is many miles from here so I don't even know how you got here but I believe with all my heart that we have been here before and that we are standing in a vision and I can tell you right now that if you'll lean on the Lord you will not have a breakdown you will not lose your mind you will not explode even though that's exactly how it feels if you will with everything that is within you cry out not just now but in these coming days for the for the very perfect leadership of the Holy Spirit I believe give it to you we break every assignment of the enemy I can't you wouldn't want me to or any of us to but we can't pray off of you what God may be doing for you but we will cancel every assignment of the enemy against your body against your mind against your emotions in the name of Jesus Lord give him Grace my brother my friend to throw himself on the rock [Music] no Illinois [Music] is this [Music] Lord we bless our brother we add strength to his strength Aya [Music] I I wanted to I Really desire to pray that you know mouths will shut and that people will behave themselves I have a feeling that that'd be praying against God because right or wrong God uses people whether they're doing it right or whether they're doing it wrong God uses people Lord if today my dear brother could come to the end of himself I could spare him 25 years [Music] Lord in the name of Jesus I just call an end to religion that this is a relationship and my brother knows that he's had that he's walked in that and will never be satisfied never be at home in religion only in relationships Lord wrap him up I will pray that you would wrap him up in your arms today now I feel a little mad that's the way it works I feel a little mad at people this is just people [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] don't you take wrong anything I said make sure you find my heart make sure you find my spirit I mean that I'm for you I hope I've shown you that a little bit I'm for you not against you I can bless anything that you do because I'm for you and I can support you and pray for you in anything you do because I'm for you but I don't have to agree don't misunderstand because I I honor the walk you have had with honor it I believe in it I believe in your testimony I believe in the call of God but and I believe the devil would kill you I believe he'd run you absolutely crazy I don't think you have to be prophetic know that because of the gift because of the call but he will not be successful but you can hear the Lord Lord may he hear you may he hear you it's hard sometime it's hard when you get in this fix thank you I've been hunting sometime I've had to hunt for people that Mike could hear for me because when I get so nervous and I get in such a fix like this it seems like you get silent Lord I've had to seek out at times and find somebody who could talk to me Lord I pray right now as I anoint his ears in the name of Jesus that not his condition or any of his troubles would keep him from hearing your voice in all [Music] Let Jesus Define you you're not a failure not at all in anything you've ever done for the Lord you're not a failure you're a man born out of season and you're ruined by the truth you're ruined by the truth I remember this is off the subject but it reminded me of a of a voicemail that was left on my voice machine in in 97 when our church split a woman screaming at the top of her lungs and she said we are ruined by the truth we're ruined by the truth there is nowhere else there's nowhere where we could walk in truth and yet we can't walk with you you have ruined us by the truth that phrase come in my mind for and for our brother because he's marked for higher things Lord have mercy I wouldn't I I I don't regret anywhere I've been as I was doing that little podcast my mind went back and I I could see myself at Shoney's I had preached for Gary Cockney in in in the valley his nephew pastors Upper Room Church there now in the valley did you know any of them I had been preaching for Gary And Laverne Cockney they were living in my grandmother's home when Priscilla was born and I had come home with some young people from Calvary Temple and I stopped in Shoney's and there was two couples sitting there brother and sister Hagler brother and sister Turner and they said brother Steve you're the person we want to see our church you're the very person we want to see our church is in a mess will you come and help us and I did and it was a hard three years we got sued the pastor the former pastor sued us his son owns the float in in downtown there where they have that therapeutic float sued us they I I drove to Montgomery and and took a a subpoena subpoena to our district superintendent because the church was Assembly of God I took a a subpoena and and they talked so down to me of course I was a kid they talked so down to me and and intimidated me so until I tore the subpoena up and threw it in the trash because they they convinced me that they were too spiritual and too high in the in the denomination to have to come and help us out in Phoenix City I went to court with those church people 17 years old scared I was terrified and God used me in that court and used that situation to turn that around and and the church did not have to pay him all the money he was suing the church for and I spent three years there and it wasn't easy because I had deacons that wanted to fight about how long is long and how short is short and I wanted brother Luke to come and preach for me and from the congregational Holiness and and they were he was what an Assembly of God and he didn't have license and it was just a mess and everything I wanted to do for God somebody opposed me but I'm sitting there thinking the other day talking to John I wouldn't change that I wasn't a failure I resigned I left when my time was over I wasn't a failure I did everything God wanted me to do while I was there and I just put another notch on my belt and moved on to the next place because God will use you in places and in Seasons like he like you had to place here he was working for the Lord he uses Us in seasons and places and times and and we don't have to feel like we fail because we run into problems because that's it I run into problems here we had a church split couple and you just do and I don't I don't even know I mean I'm just just talking because you're a pastor but anyway don't ever feel like that it wasn't worth it or there wasn't a reason in it everything that happens in the life of a Marked Man is a lesson I'm sorry I've been
