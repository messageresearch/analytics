[0:00] you
[0:07] you
[0:32] you
[0:51] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of the
[0:54] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[0:56] station Alabama USA I want to welcome
[1:00] you to the Eagles cry broadcast today I
[1:04] want to tell you what a privilege and
[1:06] honor it is to be able to come to you
[1:08] every week on these fine Christian
[1:11] networks that God is raising up in the
[1:14] end time to take the gospel and the
[1:17] bride's message I trust all over the
[1:20] world I want to thank God for the gospel
[1:22] channel I want to thank God for angel TV
[1:25] and I want you to join with me in prayer
[1:28] that God will bless the men and women of
[1:31] God who are involved in these fine
[1:34] Christian networks that the Holy Spirit
[1:36] will continue to anoint and that the
[1:39] Lord will continue to provide the
[1:41] finances that are needed so that these
[1:44] ministries can not only be maintained
[1:47] but so they can be expanded I just
[1:50] really thank God that he would bless me
[1:54] with strength and health to be with you
[1:56] again this week on the Eagles cry in our
[2:00] last broadcast we ended the broadcast by
[2:03] reading first Corinthians chapter 14
[2:06] verses 7 and 8 i'd like to read that
[2:10] quickly for you again and even things
[2:13] without life-giving sound whether pipe
[2:16] or harp except they give a distinction
[2:19] in the sounds how shall it be known what
[2:23] is piped or harped for if the trumpet
[2:26] give an uncertain sound who shall
[2:30] prepare himself to battle and we talked
[2:34] about how that different musical
[2:37] instruments have different tones and
[2:39] different sounds but even on one
[2:42] particular musical instrument like the
[2:45] trumpet or the shofar that is made from
[2:48] from the ram's horn there are different
[2:51] sounds that can come forth from the
[2:54] brass trumpet or or silver trumpet or
[2:57] from the shofar and some of you know
[3:01] that in different military exercises in
[3:04] different armies around the world for
[3:06] instance the trumpet or the bugle is
[3:08] used in the United States we have known
[3:12] for years the the trumpet or the the
[3:16] blast that would wake everyone up
[3:19] revelry the sound to to get everybody up
[3:23] and going on the bugle and then of
[3:26] course taps to retire everyone at night
[3:30] and if you've ever in the United States
[3:33] if you've ever attended a military
[3:35] funeral a funeral of someone who has
[3:37] served in the US military you've heard
[3:40] that lonesome sound of taps being played
[3:43] even as the casket was being lowered
[3:45] into the ground so different songs can
[3:49] come forth from the same instrument and
[3:51] so we need to be able to know what
[3:54] instrument we're hearing and what song
[3:57] or sound we're hearing and what it means
[4:00] for us is it time to get up or is it
[4:03] time to go to bed is it time to come
[4:06] together and march to battle or is it a
[4:09] time to retreat what is the trumpet
[4:13] saying in this hour and how should we
[4:16] respond we really need the Holy Spirit
[4:19] don't we we need the Holy Spirit in this
[4:21] hour to anoint our eyes to see and our
[4:24] ears to hear we need the Holy Spirit to
[4:27] give us revelation of the word because
[4:30] we need to know the day and the hour
[4:32] that we're living in I don't mean I mean
[4:36] we can go to the calendar and see that
[4:38] this is 2013 and we can find out what
[4:40] month it is and what day it is and we
[4:43] can look at our watching and see what
[4:45] time it is but I'm talking about an
[4:47] entirely different timing altogether not
[4:50] Chronos time but God's timing what our
[4:54] are we living in what is this age what
[4:57] is this generation what is the message
[5:00] for the hour that we're living in right
[5:03] now I believe that the message that's
[5:06] going forth for this hour for this day
[5:09] for this generation is a message to
[5:12] prepare the Bride of Christ I believe it
[5:15] is a separating message
[5:17] I do I believe that the true revelation
[5:20] of Jesus Christ once it strikes your
[5:23] life it so transforms you that it it
[5:26] forces a separation because you are no
[5:30] longer satisfied to be a lazy
[5:34] happy-go-lucky everyday run-of-the-mill
[5:37] church member you are now on a journey
[5:41] to to discover the heartbeat of God you
[5:45] want to know not just not just the
[5:48] simple interpretation of the scripture
[5:50] but you want a revelation you want the
[5:53] Holy Spirit to come in quicken that word
[5:55] in you and make you alive and transform
[5:58] you from the inside out and when that
[6:00] begins to happen in you and that
[6:02] transformation begins to take place in
[6:04] your life you're just changed and
[6:08] sometimes we say the things that we once
[6:11] loved we're not interested in any more
[6:12] the things we hate it at one time we're
[6:15] now passionate for this is a it's not
[6:18] just the conversion experience or being
[6:20] born again but we're talking about the
[6:23] revelation for call come up higher I
[6:26] want to show you things which shall be
[6:29] Hereafter so what we're praying for in
[6:31] this hour is for a message to come forth
[6:35] to the Bride of Christ around the world
[6:38] in every nation of the world that will
[6:41] be so clear so pure so accurate all of
[6:46] man's ideas plucked out of it
[6:48] traditional dogmas and creeds and
[6:51] denominational theories plucked out of
[6:54] it straight pure revelation of the word
[6:59] the Bible tells us in the book of
[7:01] revelation that the spirit of prophecy
[7:03] is the testimony of Jesus or the
[7:06] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[7:09] prophecy and we need that we need the
[7:12] testimony of Jesus we need the
[7:15] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[7:17] how does it come it comes by the
[7:19] prophetic it comes by the unction of the
[7:23] Holy Ghost even in our own individual
[7:25] lives it's not enough for us to seek out
[7:28] profits in this hour we've also got to
[7:31] have
[7:31] prophetic unction is as ordinary
[7:33] believers you know who may not feel the
[7:36] call to be a major in time profit but
[7:40] but we do feel the call to make up a
[7:42] part of the Bride of Christ and in that
[7:44] call we need to ask the Holy Spirit to
[7:47] sharpen up our prophetic perception so
[7:50] that we can hear the trumpet know what
[7:53] the trumpet is saying to us and we also
[7:56] need to ask for grace to be able to
[7:58] respond and obey sometimes even when we
[8:02] know what God is asking us to do we have
[8:05] a hard time doing it and so I pray often
[8:08] lord give me the grace I need grace
[8:12] grace like Zechariah talks about I need
[8:15] double grace maybe even triple quadruple
[8:18] gray some time to do what God is calling
[8:21] me to do in this hour and I know I'm not
[8:23] alone in fact I know that a multitude of
[8:26] you out there feel ill-equipped to be
[8:30] what God has called you to be in fact
[8:32] you've probably ask him a dozen times or
[8:35] more like I have why did you choose me
[8:37] why did you call me and you can spend
[8:39] the rest of your life asking him why or
[8:42] you can spend that time asking him to
[8:44] empower you and equip you to go forth
[8:48] and do what he's called you to do and i
[8:51] guarantee you whatever God has called
[8:53] you to do in this hour he has the grace
[8:55] the grace is available to be able to do
[9:00] whatever it is that he's asked of you I
[9:02] remember a generation ago one of God's
[9:06] great servants a prophet by the name of
[9:09] William Marion Branham he said one time
[9:12] that in the end time there must come
[9:15] forth a end time message that will meet
[9:20] in time conditions in other words the
[9:24] conditions are going to be bleak they're
[9:26] going to be dark there's going to be
[9:28] some serious things unfolding on the
[9:30] planet and God's message for that hour
[9:33] will have to arise and meet every
[9:37] challenge and every condition that the
[9:40] end times will present in fact he said
[9:44] when that end time message comes forth
[9:46] it will take us all the way back to the
[9:50] original word I don't know about you but
[9:53] that makes my spirit man stand up it
[9:56] makes me come to attention and it makes
[9:59] me desire to be a part of that end time
[10:03] message that's going forth even now to
[10:08] call us back to the original word out of
[10:11] paganism out of church creeds and dogmas
[10:16] out of man worship out of the
[10:20] intimidation and fear of man and all of
[10:24] those stifling religious regulations
[10:30] that have been placed on our lives by
[10:33] man and not by the Holy Spirit we want
[10:36] for Holy Spirit of God to teach us how
[10:38] to live our lives I want you to know I
[10:40] believe in holiness I believe God is
[10:43] calling his bride to walk before him as
[10:46] a true reflection of his holiness you
[10:50] see all my righteousness all my holiness
[10:53] is still filthy rags in the sight of a
[10:56] holy and righteous God it's only when I
[10:58] become a mirror it's only when I become
[11:01] a mirror that I can become a reflection
[11:05] of his glory and his holiness and his
[11:08] purity and I asked the Lord Lord make me
[11:11] a mirror make me a reflector of your
[11:14] holiness and your purity when God
[11:17] reveals to you his holiness and his
[11:20] purity again there's going to be a
[11:22] separation that will come in your life
[11:24] you're going to find that there are some
[11:26] things that are not helpful for you
[11:28] anymore there are some things that are
[11:30] not healthy for you anymore and gods
[11:32] going to call you out of some
[11:34] destructive patterns and destructive
[11:37] behavior and your friends and family are
[11:39] going to look at you like you've lost
[11:41] your mind but it's just a return to the
[11:43] word it's just God calling you back and
[11:46] I am so sick and tired like you and
[11:48] everybody else in the world of hypocrisy
[11:51] I believe it's time for the pure
[11:53] righteous bride of Jesus Christ to stand
[11:55] up and be counted in this
[11:57] as those who have laid down their lives
[11:59] just laid down their lives before the
[12:03] Lord and said I am nothing I have
[12:05] nothing I can accomplish nothing without
[12:08] you so come and live in my life and be
[12:10] what you can be and what you are I need
[12:14] that I need that to be able to go
[12:16] forward in this hour so we need an end
[12:18] time message that will be so pure and so
[12:22] clear that it will call us back to the
[12:25] original word it will help us to to go
[12:28] through our ideas with a fine-tooth comb
[12:32] find anything in there that is not
[12:34] biblical it's not word based and get rid
[12:38] of it so that we can move forward to be
[12:42] the hands and the feet and the
[12:44] mouthpiece of God for the end time
[12:46] brides revival I believe many of you are
[12:49] being positioned and called for such a
[12:53] time as this to be a part of that great
[12:55] move of God that's coming on the earth
[12:58] now the scripture talks about how we can
[13:01] know that we're truly living in the end
[13:05] time how can we know we know because of
[13:09] birth pains we start watching for those
[13:14] birth pains let me give you a definition
[13:17] of what birth pains are birth pains in
[13:21] terms of Bible prophecy refer to a
[13:24] certain convulsive geopolitical
[13:28] geophysical astrophysical and worldwide
[13:32] socio-economic event and issues
[13:36] scheduled to occur in the time leading
[13:39] up to the second coming of the lord
[13:42] jesus christ i hope you followed all
[13:44] that because i didn't it's a theological
[13:47] definition a little complicated i think
[13:51] we can break it down for you a little
[13:52] bit easier than that by looking at the
[13:55] words of the Lord that's what the church
[13:57] is saying about it and I think it's
[13:59] accurate but it would require defining
[14:01] each one of those terms so let's look at
[14:04] what the scripture said in Matthew
[14:06] chapter 24 beginning in verse 3 and as
[14:10] he
[14:11] at upon the Mount of Olives the
[14:13] disciples came unto him privately saying
[14:16] tell us when shall these things be and
[14:20] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[14:23] of the end of the world now there are
[14:27] three questions that are being asked by
[14:30] the disciples in this verse of scripture
[14:32] three distinct events three distinct
[14:37] questions and what we need the Holy
[14:39] Spirit to help us discern is when he
[14:42] gives the answers which of these three
[14:44] questions is he answering when because
[14:48] the questions are tell us when shall
[14:51] these things be what shall be the sign
[14:54] of thy coming and the sign of the coming
[14:57] of the end of the world so we have three
[15:01] questions and three answers in this
[15:05] chapter and sometimes this can be very
[15:08] confusing when we try to put this on a
[15:10] timeline and determine what is going to
[15:14] happen when Jesus went on to say in
[15:17] verse 4 take heed that no man deceive
[15:20] you now that's a message in itself it's
[15:24] an important message because it comes
[15:26] from the lips of our Messiah Yeshua the
[15:28] Lord Jesus Christ he is answering he's
[15:31] beginning to answer the questions that
[15:34] his disciples have asked concerning the
[15:37] end time and the first thing he says he
[15:41] doesn't jump right in and start
[15:42] explaining the signs of the end of the
[15:45] world or the signs of his coming the
[15:47] first thing he says is take heed that no
[15:49] man deceive you so I think we are safe
[15:52] to assume that in the end time that
[15:57] period is going to be marked with great
[16:00] deception in fact verse 5 helps define
[16:04] that deception where many shall come in
[16:06] my name saying I am Christ I am Messiah
[16:09] and shall deceive many and you know that
[16:14] even right now in the world there are
[16:16] men who have risen up to declare
[16:18] themselves as thus the second coming of
[16:21] the Lord Jesus Christ they're great
[16:23] communes
[16:25] large communities of followers who have
[16:28] identified in in almost all cultures
[16:32] someone who is like unto or in some
[16:36] cases they believe he is the
[16:39] reincarnation or how whatever the
[16:43] terminology would be in fact this man is
[16:47] the Lord Jesus Christ who has come the
[16:49] second time and jesus knew that 2,000
[16:54] years ago he knew that that was going to
[16:56] increase now this was going on in the
[16:59] time of the scripture because even at
[17:01] the at the hour that Jesus was speaking
[17:04] to his disciples there were already
[17:06] those who had risen up during this Roman
[17:09] a beginning of the Roman occupation of
[17:12] Jerusalem there were those who had risen
[17:14] up and declared themselves to be the
[17:16] Messiah and so there was a lot of
[17:18] division and in the in the ensuing years
[17:22] the years after the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:25] there were many who rose up and declared
[17:28] and decreed themselves to be the Messiah
[17:30] so this is something that Jesus said we
[17:32] needed to watch for he was speaking to
[17:35] those hearing him in that hour and he's
[17:37] also speaking to us in this hour and you
[17:41] will hear of wars and rumors of wars I
[17:45] can say that that could certainly be
[17:47] talking about the hour we're living in
[17:50] today as well as some of the things that
[17:53] were going on in the world when this was
[17:56] being spoken see that you be not
[17:59] troubled for all these things must come
[18:01] to pass but the end is not yet for
[18:06] nation shall rise against nation and
[18:09] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[18:12] be famines and pestilences and
[18:14] earthquakes in divers places now how
[18:18] many of you can say that sounds like the
[18:21] news that sounds like the newspaper or
[18:24] the television news or the radio news
[18:26] famines pestilences earthquakes in
[18:29] diverse places but verse 8 is worthy of
[18:33] taking a moment of our time to look at
[18:35] it says all these
[18:38] all of these things that are thus
[18:40] described are the beginning of Sorrows
[18:46] this is not the end of the end just yet
[18:49] you'll see all of these things happening
[18:52] and that will be the beginning of
[18:54] Sorrows now Jesus speaks more to his
[18:57] disciples then shall they deliver you up
[19:00] to be afflicted verse 9 and shall kill
[19:03] you and you shall be hated of All
[19:05] Nations for my name's sake and then
[19:08] shall many be offended and shall betray
[19:10] one another and shall hate one another
[19:12] and many false prophets shall arise and
[19:16] shall deceive many we had false christs
[19:19] a moment ago now false prophets and
[19:21] because iniquity shall abound the love
[19:24] of many shall wax cold but look at verse
[19:28] 13 here again we have a contrast between
[19:32] the perspective of looking out at
[19:35] hearing the news and seeing what's going
[19:37] on right now and then the perspective of
[19:40] of getting up in the spirit and looking
[19:42] down at things from God's point of view
[19:44] and here comes verse 13 to encourage us
[19:47] but he that shall endure unto the end
[19:52] the same shall be saved and I'll tell
[19:55] you right now you can't endure to the
[19:57] end without the help and the grace of
[20:00] the lord jesus christ you won't be able
[20:02] to stand the circumstances that are
[20:05] coming on the earth if it were not for
[20:07] the grace of god to endure and to stand
[20:11] and verse 14 and this gospel of the
[20:14] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[20:17] world for a witness unto all nations and
[20:19] then shall be income so these verses
[20:23] that we've just read have certain
[20:25] applications for the time in which Jesus
[20:29] was speaking and in the years that would
[20:32] follow for instance the destruction of
[20:36] the Temple in Jerusalem was sort of a
[20:38] culmination and it was historians say it
[20:44] was an event that
[20:46] changed life as it had been known in
[20:51] other words the destruction of the
[20:53] temple was such a devastating event to
[20:56] the Jewish people that it changed a
[20:58] culture it changed the way they
[21:00] worshiped it changed so much until
[21:03] really there are a certain there is a
[21:06] certain aspect of these scriptures that
[21:08] were definitely fulfilled in a measure
[21:12] in that time we can say that of a surety
[21:16] however there is other applications
[21:21] there are other applications we should
[21:23] say of these scriptures that are being
[21:25] fulfilled in the hour that we're living
[21:27] in right now if God's Word was true
[21:29] 2,000 years ago it's certainly true
[21:32] today but he that endureth to the end
[21:34] shall be saved and this gospel of the
[21:37] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[21:39] world for a witness unto all nations and
[21:41] then shall the income what I'm trying to
[21:44] say to you is a lot of what we see going
[21:46] on in the world right now are the birth
[21:49] pangs that were spoken about in the
[21:53] scripture when I read to you just a
[21:56] moment ago Matthew chapter 24 and verse
[21:59] 8 in the King James Version it says all
[22:02] these are the beginning of Sorrows in
[22:05] the New International Version it says
[22:07] all these are the beginning of birth
[22:09] pains the new American Bible said all
[22:12] these are the beginning of labor pains
[22:14] the new American Standard said but all
[22:17] these are merely the beginning of the
[22:19] birth pains wyeth new testament says but
[22:23] all these miseries are but like the
[22:26] early pains of childbirth and the world
[22:30] english bible said but all these things
[22:32] are the beginning of birth pain so many
[22:34] translations of the Bible take this word
[22:37] sorrow and specifically interpret it to
[22:41] be the sorrow the pain that a woman goes
[22:44] through the travail and the labor that a
[22:47] woman goes through in giving birth and
[22:50] there's something that we know about
[22:52] labor and that is it starts off mild the
[22:58] contractions I think is what
[23:00] called the labor pains they start off
[23:04] mild and they start off with large gaps
[23:09] between them and as labor increases and
[23:13] the time of delivery is nearer what
[23:17] happens is the pains become more intense
[23:20] and the time and the duration of those
[23:24] paints is longer and the interval
[23:27] between those pains actually becomes
[23:30] shorter because now the baby is dropping
[23:33] into the birth canal it's time for that
[23:35] precious baby to make its appearance
[23:38] here on planet earth and so labor has to
[23:42] to intensify the pains get more severe
[23:46] and the amount of time between the panes
[23:48] gets less and less and less that's what
[23:50] we're going to see in the earth that's
[23:52] what we are beginning to see now labor
[23:55] pains we have seen the beginning of
[23:58] Sorrows now we're getting ready to enter
[24:01] into a period of time where we're no
[24:04] longer going to call it the beginning of
[24:06] Sorrows we're going to begin to have to
[24:08] identify the hour we're living in is
[24:10] full on set labor because the baby is
[24:14] dropping down in the canal and it's time
[24:17] for Messiah to come forth and receive
[24:20] his precious bride it's time for the
[24:24] manchild it's time for not only the
[24:26] Messiah but it's time for an overcoming
[24:29] remnant of people to be raised up in the
[24:32] character and the attributes and the
[24:33] power of the Lord Jesus Christ with his
[24:36] authority I might add because we it's
[24:39] not just more power we need to be
[24:41] operating in when we take the gospel to
[24:44] the needy it's the authority of God I'm
[24:47] telling you the authority of God
[24:49] supersedes power and so we need we need
[24:52] more power but we need the authority of
[24:56] God and the only way that we can have
[24:57] the authority of God is to begin to
[25:00] discover who we are because when we
[25:02] discover who we are spiritually and
[25:05] prophetically it changes the way we
[25:08] relate to go
[25:09] and when we relate to God in a proper
[25:12] way in proper alignment he releases to
[25:16] us more of his authority I believe the
[25:20] power of the spoken word not just the
[25:23] spoken word but the creative spoken word
[25:26] is going to be in the mouth of the Bride
[25:29] of Christ in the end time I believe
[25:32] she's going to have the creative word of
[25:35] God in her mouth so we've got a lot of
[25:38] ugly things to expect on the planet but
[25:42] we also have a glorious period of time
[25:47] where the overcoming remnant bride will
[25:51] rise up with the power of the creative
[25:53] spoken word in her mouth she will come
[25:56] to the full adoption of sons with it
[25:59] with the same authority that Jesus
[26:00] Christ had when he was here on the earth
[26:03] Abby and that transforms us from who we
[26:07] are where we are from what church we go
[26:09] to it transforms us from our old
[26:12] identity to a new identity and our new
[26:15] identity is mrs. Jesus Christ mrs.
[26:19] Yeshua the Messiah that is our new
[26:22] identity I hope that doesn't offend you
[26:24] but if it offends your religion and okay
[26:27] because that's not going to be enough in
[26:30] the end time brother sister religion is
[26:33] not going to be enough to empower you to
[26:35] stand in this last hour it's only an
[26:38] intimate relationship with our Lord a
[26:41] total transformed life that's going to
[26:45] be able to stand against the wiles of
[26:47] the enemy in this hour I'm going to pray
[26:49] for you as we go off the air that God
[26:51] will release to you another dimension of
[26:55] the Holy Spirit of God that it will
[26:57] become so fresh and so new and so real
[27:01] in your life that you'll be snatched out
[27:03] of depression and discouragement and
[27:06] you'll be lifted into a new realm one
[27:10] perhaps you've never walked in before
[27:12] with the joy of the Lord but we've got
[27:14] to have the joy we need the power of God
[27:16] we've got to have the authority of God
[27:18] but we also need the joy of the Lord why
[27:21] because the joy of the Lord is our
[27:24] strength and we need strength in this
[27:26] hour to be able to stand so I asked the
[27:30] Lord right now father I thank you for
