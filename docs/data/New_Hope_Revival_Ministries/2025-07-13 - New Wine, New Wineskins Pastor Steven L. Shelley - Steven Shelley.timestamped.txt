[37:58] how great
[38:01] is our God.
[38:08] As we go to prayer today,
[38:10] the need that you have pondered in your
[38:14] heart, the Lord knows what it is and he
[38:18] knows how to take care of it. I know
[38:20] that there are needs all over this
[38:21] building. I don't even have to ask. I
[38:24] know there are out across the stream
[38:27] needs that I don't know what they are,
[38:29] but my Lord Jesus does
[38:32] and he knows how to take care of you.
[38:36] continue to remember Sister Audrey.
[38:39] Remember Sister Gert Hammond and Sister
[38:42] Terry. And would you continue to
[38:45] remember Brother Frank Christensen?
[38:49] We take these needs to the Lord for he
[38:52] is well able to do something about them.
[38:55] Majesty,
[39:01] worship his majesty.
[39:05] [Music]
[39:08] unto
[39:10] Jesus
[39:13] be all gloryy,
[39:16] honor and praise,
[39:23] oh
[39:25] majesty,
[39:30] kingom
[39:32] authority,

[39:42] unto his own.
[39:46] His anthems raise.
[39:50] So exalt,
[39:53] so

[39:57] lift up on high the name of Jesus.
[40:08] Magnify.

[40:15] Christ Jesus the king.
[40:20] [Music]
[40:23] Oh
[40:25] majesty.
[40:27] Brother Hawk, will you come to pray
[40:29] today? Worship his majesty.
[40:37] He's Jesus who died
[40:41] now glorified.
[40:45] King of all king. So exalt and lift up
[40:49] on high.
[40:52] So
[40:54] exalt,
[40:56] lift up on high the name of Jesus.
[41:03] [Music]
[41:06] Oh magnify
[41:11] glorify
[41:14] Christ Jesus the king.
[41:21] Oh
[41:23] majesty
[41:26] I worship you. Worship his majesty.
[41:34] [Music]
[41:36] He's Jesus who died
[41:40] now glorified.
[41:56] You are the king of all kings.
[42:05] May we never lose
[42:09] an awareness.
[42:10] That's right.
[42:11] Of the value
[42:14] that you have purchased
[42:17] our soul,
[42:18] our salvation.
[42:21] Like in this moment we thank you Lord
[42:24] for eternal life.
[42:30] May we understand
[42:34] we we call ourselves the bride
[42:42] and Lord we're going to have your heart
[42:46] not just now but for all eternity.
[42:49] Anything
[42:51] that comes our way right now,
[42:57] we just surrender it.
[43:01] It's not that significant. The hardship,
[43:04] the troubles,
[43:06] they're designed
[43:08] for our good
[43:10] to lead us to something greater.
[43:13] [Music]
[43:15] Lord, we want you. We want to know you
[43:19] Lord.
[43:20] Help us Lord
[43:22] to know you by a personal revelation
[43:27] that we can see you Lord as our creator
[43:31] and as our redeemer.
[43:33] Amen.
[43:35] Like brother Gley he said there's many
[43:38] needs in this house
[43:40] but Lord you are the answer for all of
[43:45] them.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:49] Lord, we believe you're the healer of
[43:53] this physical body.
[43:55] You have purchased already the price for
[43:59] it.
[44:00] And Father, in the name of Jesus, we
[44:03] just thank you for healing our bodies.
[44:06] May our bodies respond to the truth of
[44:10] your word and of your character, of your
[44:13] promises.
[44:17] And Lord, that revelation that I'm
[44:20] asking for for all of us,
[44:22] it will help us with any battle in our
[44:26] mind.
[44:28] It does.
[44:28] It will enable us to overcome and see
[44:33] the power that is in your blood.
[44:35] Amen.
[44:35] That comes by your spirit, Jesus.
[44:38] It's that overcoming power and an
[44:40] anointing that you put in us.
[44:43] Amen.
[44:44] It's you. Thank you, pastor.
[44:46] It's you in us.
[44:48] It's the king of king in us.
[44:51] And then you become the king of our
[44:53] heart.
[44:58] Lord, what an honor to be called to be a
[45:02] bride.
[45:06] Thank you, Lord, for your affection to
[45:08] us. May we respond to your affection, to
[45:12] your drawing, to your wooing, oh God,
[45:16] and say yes.
[45:19] We've been learning, Lord, the offenses
[45:21] and all of that stuff that comes our
[45:24] way,
[45:26] Lord. We lay it all down.
[45:30] That old man is crucified.
[45:33] It's gone. It's dead. We are now a new
[45:37] creation.
[45:40] True.
[45:41] I remember
[45:44] brother Brennham said we are now we're
[45:46] kings.
[45:47] We are spiritual kings right now. We'll
[45:50] become kings in the age to come.
[45:53] May we may we get that eternal
[45:55] perspective that we're we're being
[45:58] trained and prepared for something
[46:00] greater.
[46:02] And father for just for this house for
[46:04] this body of believers. Let your plan
[46:07] unfold. Would you draw us together in
[46:10] the spirit? Would you help and give us
[46:13] grace to just to cast our vision on the
[46:16] things above? May we just claim and and
[46:20] take a take grab the hold of the
[46:22] promises of God for for us individually
[46:26] and for this house
[46:28] and may we move forward step by step
[46:32] following you by by faith following you
[46:36] believing you trusting you with
[46:39] everything.
[46:41] And so we just commit all of the names
[46:43] that were were named by brother Shelley,
[46:46] we we just lift them up to you. Have
[46:48] your way in their lives,
[46:51] have your way in the service.
[46:54] Amen.
[46:54] And give us the grace just to to expect
[46:57] more,
[46:59] to expect more for us individually,
[47:02] to take a hold of what is being
[47:04] proclaimed from this pullpit.
[47:06] Give us the understanding that we need.
[47:09] It's the only way to to bear fruit if we
[47:11] understand the word. Help us to
[47:14] understand. May that come
[47:17] and live it out
[47:18] by grace and by faith in you Lord in
[47:21] Jesus name.
[47:22] Amen.
[47:23] Amen.
[47:23] Amen.
[47:24] Amen.
[47:25] Amen. Amen.
[47:29] Hallelujah.
[47:34] Oh come let us adore
[47:40] him. Oh come let us adore
[47:47] him. Oh come let us adore
[47:54] him.
[47:56] Christ

[48:06] is worthy
[48:09] for he alone is worthy
[48:16] for he alone

[48:34] is worthy.
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] For he alone
[48:41] is worthy.
[48:45] For he alone
[48:48] is worthy.
[48:51] [Music]
[48:53] Christ
[48:56] the Lord.
[49:03] Will you give him another worthy clap of
[49:05] praise?
[49:07] We shout unto you, oh Lord, that you
[49:10] have given us the victory.
[49:14] Hallelujah.
[49:17] [Applause]
[49:20] You may have your seats today. Thank
[49:22] you, Jesus.
[49:26] Hallelujah.
[49:29] He is worthy to be glorified,
[49:32] worthy to be magnified,
[49:35] how great he is.
[49:38] No matter what I feel like, no matter
[49:40] what my situation looks like, he is
[49:44] great and greatly to be praised.
[49:47] Hallelujah. We're glad that you're in
[49:50] the house with us today to worship the
[49:52] Lord. Uh we just honor each of you that
[49:56] have come. We say God bless you. We're
[49:59] glad that you're here. Uh Jessica has
[50:02] her son Trevor and his family with her
[50:05] today. We're so glad to see them. The
[50:06] Lord bless you.
[50:08] May the Lord minister to you while
[50:10] you're here today.
[50:14] David Stoultz in from Indiana. And
[50:16] somewhere is Lydia. There she is. That's
[50:19] his sister, Lydia. We're glad that
[50:21] they're here from Indiana.
[50:27] Sister Anita, it's good to see you today
[50:29] with your mother, Sister Dorothy. The
[50:31] Lord bless you. We're glad that you're
[50:32] here.
[50:38] I'm glad to be here with you. I'm glad
[50:41] he's here
[50:42] because if he wasn't here be wouldn't be
[50:44] worth coming.
[50:46] It would just be another lodge meeting.
[50:48] But we don't have a lodge meeting here.
[50:50] We come to be in the presence of the
[50:54] Holy One of Israel.
[50:56] We're glad that he's here. I brought him
[50:58] with me when I came.
[51:00] I woke up with him on my mind
[51:03] and I came to church with him living
[51:06] inside of me. And I know you did, too.
[51:08] Brother Cade's going to continue to lead
[51:10] us into worship and on into the
[51:12] preaching of the word. And we're here
[51:14] today to hear what the Lord would say
[51:17] unto the church. He did not quit when he
[51:21] gave the word in the book of Revelation.
[51:23] He continues to speak. He wants to
[51:25] continue to reveal himself to his people
[51:29] in the end time. Now, Leodysia is
[51:32] Leodysa.
[51:34] We live in Leody with Leodysia all
[51:37] around us. But the bride has been called
[51:39] to come up higher. And I've heard the
[51:41] voice that said, "Come up higher." And I
[51:44] will show you things that must shortly
[51:46] come to pass. And I want my eyes to see
[51:49] and I want my ears to hear what he would
[51:51] say to us today because he has something
[51:54] to say. And I believe it's a relevant
[51:57] say something for us right now.
[52:01] Amen. Brother Ellias, will you come?
[52:03] Carter, can I call on you? Let these two
[52:05] brothers go to you today for the tithe
[52:08] and the offering giving as unto the Lord
[52:10] as we continue to worship together.
[52:17] [Music]
[52:24] [Music]
[52:32] I have seen some pretty towns.
[52:39] Guess you could say
[52:41] I've been around.
[52:46] I found no place to settle down.
[52:53] There is a land.
[53:03] Oh, but I'm just a pilgrim
[53:08] here.
[53:10] I'm tolling through this old world of
[53:14] fear.
[53:16] And my time to leave
[53:19] is drawing near.

[54:57] that leads onto

[55:08] I'm going to dry these weery
[55:12] eyes.
[55:14] Going to lift my head up toward
[55:18] the sky.
[55:20] I'm going to say farewell to this world.
[55:24] Goodbye.
[55:28] There is a
[55:32] land.
[55:33] [Music]
[55:35] There is a land
[55:39] [Music]
[55:40] I'm home sick for.
[55:45] Though I've never seen it before, I've
[55:51] got loved ones
[55:53] that are waiting on that shore.
[55:59] There is a land
[56:04] [Music]
[56:07] and it's not a mess
[56:13] away
[56:16] or on some far off distant
[56:20] strand.
[56:23] Oh, I'll speed up
[56:25] and they'll slow down. Cuz
[56:30] there is a lamb.
[56:34] [Music]
[56:40] What am I so homesick
[56:45] for?
[56:47] I'm just not myself
[56:49] here anymore.
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] Oh, I'm waiting for
[56:56] that
[56:59] door.
[57:01] It leads onto

[57:10] So I'll try
[57:13] going to dry these weery eyes
[57:18] and I'll lift my head up up on towards
[57:22] the sky.
[57:24] We're going to say goodbye to this
[57:27] world. Goodbye.
[57:31] I'm going to go to that
[57:35] land.
[57:38] Oh, there is a land.

[59:14] Oh, but I'm I'm just a pilgrim

[1:00:02] that shore.
[1:00:04] There is a lamb.
[1:00:05] There is a land.
[1:00:13] And it's not a million
[1:00:18] miles away

[1:00:28] Oh, I'll speed up and then I'll slow

[1:00:57] it
[1:00:59] before,
[1:01:00] I've got loved ones
[1:01:03] that are waiting on that shore.
[1:01:08] Bless the Lord. Oh, there is a land
[1:01:18] and it's not
[1:01:21] a million
[1:01:23] miles

[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:49] Oh, do you believe that? Would you give

[1:01:52] [Applause]
[1:01:54] Wonderful Jesus.
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:01:59] Wonderful Jesus.
[1:02:02] Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] I believe you can do better than that
[1:02:07] this morning. I can't hear.
[1:02:11] I believe you can do better than that.
[1:02:14] Oh, we believe there's a land, Lord.
[1:02:18] This is not the end.
[1:02:21] This is not the end. Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:37] I had a note from I don't know why it
[1:02:39] seems we mentioned uh Sister Flo's
[1:02:43] Brenda so much but I had a note from her
[1:02:46] one time and she said when I die
[1:02:49] would you sing there is a land
[1:02:52] I said well I've never s I didn't even
[1:02:54] know she knew the song I I didn't even
[1:02:56] know she because I wasn't singing the
[1:02:59] song and I said, "Well, I'll try to
[1:03:01] learn it and sing it." And I didn't
[1:03:04] think it would be as soon as it was,
[1:03:07] but she said, "That's what I want. I
[1:03:08] won't sing at my feet." There is a land.
[1:03:12] I want you to know that it's more real
[1:03:14] today to me
[1:03:16] than it's ever been before.
[1:03:18] It's just a breath away.
[1:03:20] Yes, sir.
[1:03:22] Uh maybe it makes a good fairy tale to
[1:03:24] you, but to me, it's the reason why I'm
[1:03:26] here. It's the reason why I keep moving.
[1:03:29] If I didn't believe that eternity was
[1:03:32] real and that Jesus is waiting on the
[1:03:35] other side of this with my loved ones, I
[1:03:37] don't know that I would have been able
[1:03:39] to make it this far.
[1:03:41] But it's that blessed hope the Bible
[1:03:44] talks about.
[1:03:45] The Bible warns us not to become like
[1:03:47] the scoffers of our day who say, "Show
[1:03:50] us is coming."
[1:03:52] And you'll hear people say, "Well,
[1:03:53] they've been saying that for
[1:03:55] generations. They've been saying that
[1:03:57] for hundreds of years. That's right. And
[1:03:59] it was right then.
[1:04:01] And it's right now.
[1:04:03] And one morning you'll wake up
[1:04:07] and you'll find that we're gone.
[1:04:14] Yes. Uh there'll probably be somebody
[1:04:17] here to open the church doors.
[1:04:21] There will no doubt there'll probably be
[1:04:24] somebody here who can have a little song
[1:04:27] or make a little do something, make a
[1:04:29] little prayer or something. I don't know
[1:04:31] what it will be,
[1:04:33] but I know what the word says. It'll be
[1:04:36] in a moment. It It will culminate in
[1:04:38] just a moment and we'll be gone. And it
[1:04:40] won't be a millions and millions and
[1:04:42] millions disappear like we've been told.
[1:04:45] Oh, no. that that uh
[1:04:50] rapture is for his wife.
[1:04:53] Hear this.
[1:04:55] And uh if you miss it, you you've missed
[1:04:58] a lot.
[1:05:00] You'll have to know that you have more
[1:05:02] courage than you've shown in this life
[1:05:04] thus far.
[1:05:06] The Bible said those who remain, who who
[1:05:09] believe, who want to make a testimony,
[1:05:12] will have to prove it
[1:05:14] by the giving of their life.
[1:05:17] I'm just telling you what the book said.
[1:05:20] That's no doctrine we're making up as we
[1:05:22] go along. Don't you believe that you can
[1:05:24] know that you're ready? Yes.
[1:05:28] Long before I ever called myself his
[1:05:30] bride, he called me that
[1:05:33] way before I ever called myself his son.
[1:05:35] He called me that.
[1:05:37] And he did the same for you. And it's a
[1:05:39] living reality. And if you're not ready
[1:05:41] to meet the Lord, you'll be lost. And
[1:05:44] you won't just be lost that day. You'll
[1:05:46] be lost for all eternity. There's no
[1:05:49] second chances then. It's time for all
[1:05:52] of us
[1:05:53] to be serious about serving the Lord.
[1:05:56] You are not here to serve yourself or
[1:05:58] sin. You're here to glorify the name of
[1:06:01] Jesus Christ. And that doesn't mean on
[1:06:04] Sunday only or Wednesday only or Tuesday
[1:06:06] only. It means every day of our lives.
[1:06:08] What a privilege to serve him. Give him
[1:06:10] one more hand clap. He's worthy. He's
[1:06:13] worthy.
[1:06:16] I don't care whether you clap for me or
[1:06:18] not, but will you clap for Jesus? Will
[1:06:22] you give him a praise?
[1:06:24] Will you tell him that he's lord of
[1:06:26] lords and king of kings?
[1:06:30] He's the melam.
[1:06:32] He's the king of the whole universe.
[1:06:34] He's s shalom, the prince of peace, the
[1:06:38] mighty God, the everlasting father.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. He is wonderful counselor,
[1:06:45] lily of the valley, the bright and
[1:06:47] morning star, faithful and true. That's
[1:06:51] who he is. He said, "I am the way, the
[1:06:54] truth, and the life." Hallelujah. He
[1:06:57] said, "I am the resurrection
[1:07:01] and the life."
[1:07:03] And he's worthy.
[1:07:06] He's worthy. Well, you all are getting
[1:07:08] mighty worked up, aren't you? Well, you
[1:07:09] call it what you like.
[1:07:12] But I'm thankful this morning.
[1:07:14] Would you thank God for the musicians
[1:07:16] and their their labor and those in the
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:24] those who are working in the sound and
[1:07:27] the and the video and the stream. If you
[1:07:30] are streaming this service on any of our
[1:07:35] down just a tad uh on any of our
[1:07:38] platforms, would you take just a moment?
[1:07:41] I know some of you like to be like
[1:07:43] Nicodemus.
[1:07:45] You you you like to come in the shadow
[1:07:47] of the night so that no one knows who
[1:07:50] you are. And that's all right. But if
[1:07:54] you are not a Nicodemus and you're not
[1:07:56] ashamed that you're would you just put
[1:07:58] your where you're from. Would you just
[1:08:00] tell us where you're from? Maybe you're
[1:08:03] streaming on the website revival.org.
[1:08:06] Maybe you're streaming on the app on
[1:08:08] your phone. Maybe you're streaming on
[1:08:11] YouTube or Facebook Live. Just put a
[1:08:14] little just just a note. Tell us where
[1:08:16] you're from. and uh because we don't
[1:08:18] have any way of knowing where you're
[1:08:20] from unless you unless you take a moment
[1:08:22] to mention it to us and we certainly
[1:08:24] appreciate that. Many times people will
[1:08:27] say, "Well, where where are people
[1:08:29] streaming in from?" Well, we don't
[1:08:30] always know unless you tell us. God is
[1:08:32] good. I know you're standing. Uh in a
[1:08:36] minute you'll be sitting. I'll be
[1:08:37] standing by myself unless you just want
[1:08:40] to stand and join me. But anyway, um we
[1:08:43] want to say how wonderful it is to see
[1:08:45] you in the house of the Lord this
[1:08:46] morning. I woke up this morning at 6:30
[1:08:49] with heaven on my mind.
[1:08:51] I decided not to be a holy roller. I
[1:08:53] decided to get up, get out of bed first
[1:08:57] call, and get started on what I needed
[1:09:00] to do to be here today. This is the most
[1:09:02] important day of my week. I'm here to
[1:09:04] give God all the praise, all the honor,
[1:09:06] all the glory. I'm not here to impress
[1:09:09] anybody. What you think of me won't mean
[1:09:12] one thing in eternity.
[1:09:15] No need to try to perform in this life.
[1:09:18] Just be who God made you. Your reward is
[1:09:21] not of this world.
[1:09:23] It's out of this world. Amen.
[1:09:26] Sister Anita is Sister Dorothy's
[1:09:28] birthday today or was it yesterday?
[1:09:30] Today. And did I read it? 81. Sister
[1:09:34] Dorothy Hammock is um a survivor, a
[1:09:38] cancer survivor. more than once and a
[1:09:41] survivor of life. Rough, ugly, hurtful
[1:09:47] stuff. And she has lived as an overcomer
[1:09:51] by the grace of God. Fooled the doctors
[1:09:55] and she's 81 today. Would you wish her a
[1:09:57] happy birthday?
[1:09:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:07] there for a while she would come to
[1:10:09] visit and she was looking lower and
[1:10:11] lower to me gray kind of gray in color
[1:10:14] but I tell you she she looks like a
[1:10:16] morning star this morning she's just
[1:10:19] shining hallelujah yesterday was little
[1:10:22] Charlotte Ruth's birthday and we're
[1:10:25] having a little lunch afterwards and the
[1:10:28] church doesn't we don't throw birthday
[1:10:30] parties you know for for children but
[1:10:33] just there were so many who wanted to be
[1:10:35] a part of this uh little miracle life
[1:10:38] and uh celebrate with her. And she's got
[1:10:42] more mamas than anybody I know. More
[1:10:44] aunts and uncles than anybody I know,
[1:10:47] more grandmothers, grandfathers, paps,
[1:10:50] and nannas and cousins by the dozens
[1:10:54] because we have uh come to love her.
[1:10:57] This whole body loves her and we are so
[1:10:59] thankful. As we prayed in the back this
[1:11:02] morning, my the words came out of my
[1:11:04] mouth, what what a bright future she has
[1:11:06] because she belongs to him. Nothing,
[1:11:10] nothing of any tragedy has altered her
[1:11:13] destiny. No, no, no. It's fixed and she
[1:11:17] will be everything that God created her
[1:11:19] to be.
[1:11:20] So, we look forward to celebrating her
[1:11:22] later this afternoon. Today is also
[1:11:26] Nikesha's birthday, and I see her in the
[1:11:28] house of the Lord. She's She's not as
[1:11:30] tall as some of them in front of her,
[1:11:32] but I see her.
[1:11:37] And it's also
[1:11:39] brother brother James Skip Yantis'
[1:11:42] birthday. He is in Texas, but you can
[1:11:46] tell him sometime that we wished him a
[1:11:48] happy birthday today and we're praying
[1:11:50] for him as always. And if our precious
[1:11:53] sister Tmaine would have lived, today
[1:11:54] was her birthday and she was born in
[1:11:57] 1930. You can do the math. She would
[1:11:59] have been she'd have been on up there.
[1:12:01] 95 years old. Wednesday is Michaela
[1:12:05] Faulner's birthday. Is that right? And
[1:12:07] you'll be 15. Wow.
[1:12:10] I don't know how that happened, but it
[1:12:12] just did. And Thursday is Elisha's
[1:12:15] birthday and he'll be nine. Is that
[1:12:18] right? Where is he?
[1:12:20] Will you be nine?
[1:12:22] That is so, you know, that's some
[1:12:24] people's shoe size. not mine, but it is
[1:12:27] somebody
[1:12:29] nine years old. And Friday is July 18th
[1:12:33] is brother and sister Waller's
[1:12:35] anniversary, wedding anniversary. And I
[1:12:38] had a wonderful conversation with him
[1:12:40] this week on the telephone. And we send
[1:12:42] our love all the way out to the to the
[1:12:44] West Coast nearly. Uh send them our love
[1:12:48] today. And if I have written it down
[1:12:50] right, Saturday is July 19th is our
[1:12:53] brother Joseph Ryder's birthday in South
[1:12:56] Africa. So we send our love and
[1:12:58] greetings to them today. We miss them
[1:13:02] and appreciate their love for us. Open
[1:13:05] your Bible if you have it. I know we're
[1:13:08] living in a day of of great technology
[1:13:12] and but I've been reading articles. I've
[1:13:15] mentioned to you that that we are
[1:13:18] becoming so addicted to dopamine
[1:13:23] and our brain releases an unusual amount
[1:13:26] of that stuff when we are somehow
[1:13:30] gratified
[1:13:31] by keeping up with everybody else's
[1:13:33] business. Isn't that amazing? You you
[1:13:36] you you actually now receive some
[1:13:39] benefit
[1:13:41] uh scientifically your brain and your
[1:13:44] body benefits with a wash. It washes
[1:13:47] over you because you are scrolling
[1:13:51] through somebody's life.
[1:13:54] Interesting, isn't it? Unfortunately,
[1:13:57] it's forming an addiction
[1:13:59] and that addiction is causing almost
[1:14:02] every person on the planet to have ADHD.
[1:14:07] I'm not making this up.
[1:14:09] It's what brain scientists are telling
[1:14:11] us now. Isn't that crazy? And there are
[1:14:14] ways that you can help help yourself.
[1:14:17] And one is if you will uh once a day
[1:14:22] make up your mind to read
[1:14:25] from a real page,
[1:14:29] something that used to belong to a tree,
[1:14:32] a real page. And you'll read, if you
[1:14:35] could possibly read for 30 minutes, they
[1:14:39] say that you will be actually healing
[1:14:43] yourself.
[1:14:44] And just not looking at a screen is
[1:14:48] actually good for your brain and it will
[1:14:50] help you a bit with the dopamine
[1:14:52] addiction. So if you've got a
[1:14:54] oldfashioned
[1:14:56] Bible, open it up. Just one verse. Mark
[1:14:59] 2:22.
[1:15:01] Mark chapter 2 verse 22.
[1:15:07] If you don't then you can use this
[1:15:09] screen up here in a moment.
[1:15:12] It will come up. This is uh red letters,
[1:15:16] words of Jesus,
[1:15:19] words of life.
[1:15:21] We're moving today because of him. In
[1:15:25] him we breathe, we move, we live, we
[1:15:28] move, we have our being because of his
[1:15:31] goodness. Amen.
[1:15:32] And no man putteth new wine into old
[1:15:37] bottles.
[1:15:39] Somebody said, "Well, that couldn't be
[1:15:41] wine. It would have to be grape juice."
[1:15:43] Well, all wine starts out with grape
[1:15:46] juice, but grape juice doesn't generally
[1:15:49] burst a bottle.
[1:15:51] some kind of fermentation is taking
[1:15:53] place in that juice. And the Bible said
[1:15:56] Jesus particularly he's talking giving
[1:15:59] several examples here. One is he said
[1:16:02] you don't take a new piece of cloth and
[1:16:04] and put that in an old garment or vice
[1:16:07] versa. You wouldn't take an old garment
[1:16:09] put a new piece of cloth in that. Uh
[1:16:12] it'd be kind of a waste. Then he went on
[1:16:14] to say, "And you don't put new wine into
[1:16:16] an old bottle, else the new wine doth
[1:16:20] burst the bottles. And the wine is it's
[1:16:25] not only spilled, it's spoiled."
[1:16:28] Unless you're going to lick it up, it's
[1:16:30] an explosion.
[1:16:32] And the bottles will be marred. I say,
[1:16:36] "But new wine." New wine. Somebody say
[1:16:39] new wine. When we read about new wine in
[1:16:43] the scripture, we read about the spirit,
[1:16:46] we're reading about the Holy Ghost
[1:16:50] or the Holy Spirit, as some people like
[1:16:52] to say. He's alive.
[1:16:55] He's not the third person of the
[1:16:57] Trinity.
[1:16:59] He's almighty God.
[1:17:01] Emmanuel once and now he's living in us.
[1:17:05] The same spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:17:08] is now in the believer. by the baptism
[1:17:12] of the Holy Ghost. And that's about as
[1:17:14] much new wine as you can get.
[1:17:17] And if you don't make some adjustment to
[1:17:19] your bottle,
[1:17:21] you'll burst.
[1:17:24] And the wine will be spilled. The spirit
[1:17:26] of God will be spilled. It will be
[1:17:28] wasted. It would be a shame for the very
[1:17:31] life of Jesus Christ to be poured out as
[1:17:35] a waste. He has purchased you and I with
[1:17:38] his own blood. We are no longer our own.
[1:17:41] Some people don't like that. They call
[1:17:43] that being out of control. It's all
[1:17:45] right to be out of control as long as
[1:17:47] he's the one controlling our lives.
[1:17:50] Amen.
[1:17:51] Uh he is in charge if you'll let him be.
[1:17:54] He's more than a comfortable shoe that
[1:17:56] you pull out when you need him. He wants
[1:17:59] to be our constant companion.
[1:18:02] Pray with me. Bow your head just a
[1:18:04] moment. Father, we thank you that you
[1:18:06] have let us come today. Worship has been
[1:18:08] nearly off the chart. I've been moved
[1:18:12] deeply. Every every cell, every fiber of
[1:18:15] who I am has been ministered to by the
[1:18:18] presence of Jesus. The atmosphere of
[1:18:20] your glory that has been in this room.
[1:18:23] It's more than an ordinary Sunday
[1:18:25] service. It's special. It's unique. It's
[1:18:28] a divine appointment because you're here
[1:18:31] and you've come in such a tangible way.
[1:18:34] You've made you've made the backslider
[1:18:37] uncomfortable, but you have thrilled the
[1:18:40] believer.
[1:18:42] You have thrilled the believer.
[1:18:44] And today, Lord, I ask that we everyone
[1:18:47] leave here as believers.
[1:18:50] No compromise in us. No shadow of
[1:18:53] turning back in us. But I pray that we
[1:18:55] will leave here today with our shoulder
[1:18:58] to the plow like it has never been
[1:19:00] before. Pressing in and toward the
[1:19:03] kingdom of of God. For we know, Lord,
[1:19:06] that it is now breaking forth in us.
[1:19:10] It's not us in the kingdom. It's the
[1:19:12] kingdom bursting forth in us. How we
[1:19:16] praise you. Come and sit on the throne
[1:19:19] of our heart. Come and be Lord over
[1:19:22] every decision. Be Lord over where we
[1:19:25] work and where we go and what we eat and
[1:19:28] who we fellowship with. Be Lord over all
[1:19:31] of that.
[1:19:32] And we'll give you praise and honor and
[1:19:34] glory. Bless our time in your word. I
[1:19:37] ask that you would arrest every unrest,
[1:19:40] every spirit that would be troubled in
[1:19:43] any way and you'd let truth come forth
[1:19:45] today piercing the darkness and setting
[1:19:48] us everyone free. We desire to be free,
[1:19:53] free, free. We ask for this help in the
[1:19:57] mighty exalted name above every name,
[1:20:00] the name chosen whereby men may be
[1:20:03] saved, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] and for his glory. And the saints said,
[1:20:10] will you do it one more time?
[1:20:12] You may be seated. We are in a series
[1:20:16] this week, last week, week before. We're
[1:20:19] in a series, a transformation from the
[1:20:23] grape vine to the king's table.
[1:20:26] We're we're walking through the journey
[1:20:28] of making wine in the Bible. Somebody
[1:20:31] said, "Well, that's a silly subject."
[1:20:33] Well, uh I I found a burden. A burden
[1:20:36] found me a few uh weeks now ago. One
[1:20:40] that I couldn't shake. One that my tears
[1:20:45] uh remain behind my eyeballs all day,
[1:20:48] all night. Anybody ever had one like
[1:20:49] that? You just felt this heavy pull of
[1:20:53] the spirit of God within you. Somebody
[1:20:55] said, "I've never felt God at all." I
[1:20:57] pray you feel him today.
[1:20:59] I pray you feel. It's not about feeling.
[1:21:02] He's real whether you feel him or not.
[1:21:04] But I pray you feel him today because
[1:21:06] it's a wonderful thing. The Bible said
[1:21:08] you'll know you're saved
[1:21:10] because you feel a quickening.
[1:21:13] You feel a resurrection.
[1:21:15] in your own being in the on the inside
[1:21:18] of the inside. Well, this burden got
[1:21:20] heavy and I would often have to close
[1:21:22] the door in my office and just talk to
[1:21:24] him. And um I I didn't have much to say
[1:21:28] to my family. I I I couldn't help
[1:21:31] myself. It was just an assignment. And I
[1:21:34] just kept asking the Lord, Lord, help me
[1:21:36] get through this. Show me who to pray
[1:21:38] for. Show me what to pray for. Help me
[1:21:40] to be faithful in all things. Uh uh
[1:21:43] don't let me be distracted by Facebook
[1:21:47] or or anything else. Don't let anybody
[1:21:51] uh pull on me that doesn't need me uh
[1:21:54] really urgently. Let me just have a few
[1:21:57] days with you. And he granted that for
[1:21:59] the most part. And he gave me an answer.
[1:22:03] And it was an answer out of the book of
[1:22:05] Jeremiah. And it was a scripture that we
[1:22:08] may come to in a bit. how that Moab had
[1:22:12] settled in his lees less. It's the
[1:22:16] dregs. It's what happens when the
[1:22:18] sediment begins to drop through the
[1:22:21] through the liquid through the wine as
[1:22:23] it is fermenting. As the grape juice is
[1:22:26] being transformed into wine, the dregs
[1:22:30] begin to drop down. The leaves begin to
[1:22:32] drop down to the bottom. Now, in in
[1:22:35] biblical times, if you left wine in the
[1:22:38] drag, if you left the leaves in the
[1:22:41] bottom of the wine, it would contaminate
[1:22:44] the flavor, the value, and even the
[1:22:47] fragrance of the wine. We are called
[1:22:50] like wine, like grapes that have been
[1:22:53] crushed to become wine in the in the
[1:22:56] chalice, in the cup of the King of Kings
[1:23:00] and the Lord of Lords. He desires to
[1:23:03] find fellowship and relationship with
[1:23:07] us.
[1:23:08] And there's so much comfort in that
[1:23:10] and there's peace and there's
[1:23:12] stimulation
[1:23:14] by revelation in that fellowship that we
[1:23:17] have. Religion is so uh unsatisfying.
[1:23:22] Church annity is so satisfying.
[1:23:25] Singing dead dry uh uh crusty songs. I'm
[1:23:30] not talking about hymns. There's plenty
[1:23:32] of life in an inspired hymn, but I'm
[1:23:36] talking about singing the same song over
[1:23:39] and over again until you you have
[1:23:41] literally sung all the life out of it
[1:23:44] and you come back and try to sing it
[1:23:45] again and it's lifeless
[1:23:47] because the spirit is no longer moving
[1:23:49] on that for this season. He may come
[1:23:52] again and use that again. But people get
[1:23:56] so um you know boxed in and they get so
[1:24:00] religious
[1:24:02] and what happens is they settle down in
[1:24:05] their leaves and the wine that they
[1:24:08] could be
[1:24:09] the beauty and the value and the flavor
[1:24:11] that they could be in the kingdom of the
[1:24:13] Lord. the cup of the king, it's now
[1:24:15] tainted by the things that have never
[1:24:18] been removed from the wine because the
[1:24:21] process of fermentation in the Bible was
[1:24:24] such that you're pouring from one vessel
[1:24:26] to another vessel to another vessel and
[1:24:29] each time you do that, there's stuff
[1:24:31] left behind. How many of you been
[1:24:33] through some stuff in your life and
[1:24:35] you're thankful that you left some junk
[1:24:37] behind you
[1:24:39] and now you come forward some newness in
[1:24:41] you and you start churning again
[1:24:44] and then you're poured out about that
[1:24:46] time you're poured out again
[1:24:48] and what happens then is uh there are
[1:24:51] more drags.
[1:24:54] You know, it's hard to believe that that
[1:24:56] that I was that rotten
[1:24:58] that God had to just keep pouring me out
[1:25:01] and pouring me out, leaving behind every
[1:25:03] time that which was unlike him.
[1:25:05] You know, it doesn't matter to me how
[1:25:07] many vessels it takes.
[1:25:08] Doesn't matter to me how many years it
[1:25:10] takes. Before I leave here, I want to be
[1:25:12] just like him.
[1:25:15] Amen.
[1:25:16] It's the only way. He said, "We're going
[1:25:18] to see him. When we see him, we're going
[1:25:20] to know him
[1:25:22] because we'll be like him." Amen.
[1:25:24] Is that Bible?
[1:25:25] Yes, sir.
[1:25:26] It certainly is. Now, in Jewish
[1:25:29] tradition, they they write about this a
[1:25:31] lot in the in Midrash, which is uh
[1:25:35] discussions over the scripture. And they
[1:25:38] tell us that freshly pressed juice even
[1:25:42] before fermentation becomes titheable.
[1:25:45] We preached that the the moment
[1:25:47] fermentation visibly begins when you see
[1:25:51] that grape juice begin to bubble,
[1:25:54] you know that wine is in the making. And
[1:25:57] according to Leviticus, that portion
[1:26:00] wine already belongs to the Lord. It's
[1:26:03] already his. It's used for his service.
[1:26:07] And this often fermentation often
[1:26:10] started in the first day of the pressing
[1:26:12] because it was warm in the Middle East.
[1:26:15] And it still is. Once fermentation
[1:26:18] began, the juice was no longer just
[1:26:20] fruit. It now became an increase from
[1:26:24] the fruit. So they tithe the increase of
[1:26:27] the fruit. Now the same fruit has become
[1:26:30] juice. Same fruit. And the juice now is
[1:26:34] becoming wine. And guess what you do?
[1:26:37] Tithe.
[1:26:37] You tithe again.
[1:26:39] You tithe on the increase of the grapes.
[1:26:42] Now you tithe on the increase of the
[1:26:44] wine. And you move forward. And just as
[1:26:47] Israel tithed their first and their
[1:26:50] best, including grapes, including wine.
[1:26:53] We are tithing in some way. not only our
[1:26:57] finance, our time, our prayers, our
[1:27:00] efforts for the Lord and the ministry,
[1:27:02] but we're also uh we're also sort of
[1:27:05] offering up the the first fruits of
[1:27:09] what's happening as we begin that
[1:27:11] process of being transformed into his
[1:27:14] image. Sometimes it comes out a little
[1:27:17] immature.
[1:27:20] Sometimes we do things as baby
[1:27:22] Christians
[1:27:23] that we wouldn't do as more mature
[1:27:25] Christians. Amen.
[1:27:27] And God is gracious. Help me.
[1:27:29] He's gracious. He's merciful. He doesn't
[1:27:32] expect you to be uh all that you're
[1:27:34] going to be
[1:27:36] overnight.
[1:27:39] You know, you didn't get to be so messed
[1:27:41] up overnight,
[1:27:43] nor I. And we're not going to be fixed
[1:27:46] just like him overnight. It's a process.
[1:27:49] But we don't wait until we come forth in
[1:27:51] his image to give him something. Amen.
[1:27:54] So today we're here tithing a portion of
[1:27:58] where God has brought us from. We're
[1:28:00] offering it up to him as a shout, as an
[1:28:04] uplifted hand, as a clap, as a
[1:28:07] hallelujah, as a praise the Lord.
[1:28:10] Somebody danced a little bit, somebody
[1:28:13] walked a little bit, somebody moved a
[1:28:15] little bit. All of that an offering,
[1:28:19] a tithe to the Lord.
[1:28:21] You're not saying, "I'm there. I've
[1:28:23] arrived. I'm better than anybody else in
[1:28:26] the house." You're saying, "Lord, you've
[1:28:28] been so good to me when I didn't deserve
[1:28:31] it. You've been so good to me when I
[1:28:34] didn't deserve it. And today, I'm going
[1:28:36] to praise you, not because I'm anything,
[1:28:39] but because you're everything.
[1:28:42] You deserve the highest praise.
[1:28:45] So Lord, if you can receive any honor,
[1:28:48] any glory from a broken vessel such as
[1:28:51] these,
[1:28:53] then we want it to be unto you.
[1:28:56] Brother Brandon would always tell us,
[1:28:58] you know, uh quoting that we are not
[1:29:01] what we ought to be,
[1:29:04] maybe not yet what we want to be,
[1:29:07] but we've got something to celebrate.
[1:29:10] Just like that first bubble in the
[1:29:12] juice.
[1:29:14] That's not telling you it's ready to
[1:29:16] drink yet.
[1:29:18] It's not telling you that the king wants
[1:29:20] to dip his cup in that. But what it is
[1:29:24] telling you is the process has begun.
[1:29:28] So he deserves that. Give him some of
[1:29:30] that. He wants some of that first
[1:29:33] praise.
[1:29:34] Somebody said, "I don't know very much
[1:29:35] about this, that, or the other. I'm just
[1:29:37] a baby. Just a new Christian. just don't
[1:29:40] know. Well, don't let that worry you.
[1:29:42] Everybody started out that way
[1:29:46] and and as soon as they get there, they
[1:29:48] wish they'd have paid more attention
[1:29:52] all the times. They tuned the preaching
[1:29:54] out and and didn't read the Bible, read
[1:29:56] all the Western books and all the true
[1:29:58] romance books and watched all the
[1:30:00] vampire love stories and the things the
[1:30:03] world gets so crazy about.
[1:30:06] Can you imagine the world gets so crazy
[1:30:08] over love affairs between werewolves and
[1:30:12] hello
[1:30:14] walking dead and all the kind zombies
[1:30:17] and all the kind of things they talk
[1:30:19] about in this life. You and I miss our
[1:30:23] opportunity to feast on the word of God
[1:30:26] and we're going to know it one day.
[1:30:28] None of that will give us strength to
[1:30:30] stand in the last day.
[1:30:33] destiny won't be there to help you.
[1:30:37] When you stand to overcome in the last
[1:30:39] day,
[1:30:40] anybody help me. Well, you're preaching
[1:30:42] against everything. Actually, I'm not
[1:30:43] preaching against anything.
[1:30:45] That's true.
[1:30:45] I'm preaching for something.
[1:30:47] I'm telling you, your strength comes
[1:30:49] from the Lord.
[1:30:50] If you think your smarts is going to get
[1:30:52] you through,
[1:30:54] it'll fail.
[1:30:56] Why? There's computers smarter than me.
[1:31:00] Hello. If I get through this, it'll be
[1:31:02] by the help and the grace of God. It'll
[1:31:05] be because the spirit of the Lord lives
[1:31:06] inside of me. Amen.
[1:31:08] So, even the juice when it starts to
[1:31:10] ferment belongs to him. Before we're
[1:31:12] fully finished, we yield the process to
[1:31:16] the Lord. And we do that by saying,
[1:31:18] "Lord, I want to thank you for where
[1:31:20] you've brought me from."
[1:31:22] Anybody got something to thank him for?
[1:31:24] Yes.
[1:31:25] You brought me, as the old-timer used to
[1:31:27] say, you brought me a mighty long way.
[1:31:32] I want to know, can you really say that?
[1:31:34] Is there anybody here that feels like
[1:31:36] you've really been brought a mighty long
[1:31:38] way?
[1:31:39] Then you could quote another old-timer.
[1:31:41] You You could say, "I'm waiting down
[1:31:43] here at the river,
[1:31:45] waiting to cross. Will you come help me,
[1:31:48] Jesus?"
[1:31:49] And he will.
[1:31:50] Amen. The same God who brought you this
[1:31:52] far will take you all the way
[1:31:54] if you'll put your trust in him.
[1:31:57] So after that wine tithe was taken off
[1:32:00] of the first juice that was beginning to
[1:32:04] ferment fermentation takes a shift and
[1:32:08] it starts becoming more violent.
[1:32:11] Violent. Yes. Violent pressure.
[1:32:16] Fermentation is not just bubbles. It's a
[1:32:19] tremendous amount of pressure. And Jesus
[1:32:22] said, if you take new wine that's still
[1:32:25] in the beginning days of fermentation
[1:32:28] and you try to put that in an old
[1:32:31] vessel,
[1:32:32] the old vessel who's been through so
[1:32:35] much already, it will never be able to
[1:32:38] withstand the pressure that builds up in
[1:32:41] the process of transforming the juice to
[1:32:44] wine.
[1:32:46] So you got to be careful what kind of
[1:32:47] vessel. So in reality before we receive
[1:32:51] the new wine there has to be a
[1:32:53] sanctifying work take place in our life.
[1:32:57] Somebody said what does sanctification
[1:33:00] mean? I think brother Brandham had the
[1:33:02] best explanation of sanctification that
[1:33:05] uh of anybody I've ever heard. He said,
[1:33:07] "It's like you go out off the the steps
[1:33:10] or the porch of the farmhouse and you
[1:33:13] look over there in the yard where their
[1:33:15] kids have been playing and you see a a
[1:33:18] little something sticking out." And he
[1:33:20] said, "It's a glass. It's one of mama's
[1:33:23] glasses from inside, a drinking glass."
[1:33:27] And maybe the kids I I know I was bad
[1:33:30] about uh scattering stuff at my
[1:33:32] grandmother's house. And you find it,
[1:33:35] oh, it's a glass. And he said, "You you
[1:33:37] you don't just dig that out of the dirt
[1:33:40] and take it in, fill it up with milk,
[1:33:42] and drink out of it. Not after it's been
[1:33:45] laying out there in the yard and it's
[1:33:47] got all dirty and cruddy and no telling
[1:33:50] what's crawled through it, you know,
[1:33:52] into it." And and it's almost it's
[1:33:55] almost uh, you know, you're almost
[1:33:58] thinking you ought to just toss it,
[1:34:00] but you know, it's just a maybe it's
[1:34:03] just a grape jar anyway. Maybe it's just
[1:34:05] a jelly jar. I know you all were
[1:34:07] wealthy. I know you all came from big
[1:34:09] fancy families. And you didn't drink out
[1:34:11] of mason jars like we did. And you never
[1:34:14] drank your juice out of a great jar, a
[1:34:16] grape jelly jar, did you? No, not you
[1:34:19] folk. But but but I did. And today, uh I
[1:34:23] went to the cabinet last night to get to
[1:34:25] get a glass and and I said, "Honey,
[1:34:27] where are my glasses?" She said, "Oh,
[1:34:29] they're in the dishwasher. I only have a
[1:34:32] couple of them and they're real tall."
[1:34:33] Mason jars about that tall. And she
[1:34:37] we've got Crystal. We We've got uh my
[1:34:40] glasses, her glasses, everybody's gl M
[1:34:44] some of Ma's glasses. We got plenty of
[1:34:46] things to drink out of. But I like my
[1:34:49] tall
[1:34:51] sort of slimmer mason jars. I I like it
[1:34:54] makes things colder. When you put ice in
[1:34:56] glass, it's colder. I go to countries,
[1:34:58] they want to give me a styrofoam cup.
[1:35:00] Don't give me a styrofoam cup. Give me a
[1:35:02] glass.
[1:35:05] So you take that jar out of the dirt and
[1:35:08] you bring it inside. You don't pour milk
[1:35:10] in it.
[1:35:11] You got to do something to it first. He
[1:35:14] said, "Now when you dug it up, you took
[1:35:15] it up out of the dirt." He said, "That's
[1:35:17] like that's like salvation. That's like
[1:35:19] redemption. That that glass would be
[1:35:22] forgotten. It'd be lost. But you picked
[1:35:24] it up, knocked off some of the dirt."
[1:35:27] That's what the Lord does.
[1:35:29] Amen. starts us toward the process of
[1:35:33] being usable
[1:35:35] again. We were once usable in his mind
[1:35:39] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:35:41] had a plan for us and our life took us
[1:35:44] in another direction. So now he picks us
[1:35:47] up out of the farmyard and he begins to
[1:35:49] knock us off a and get us ready to take
[1:35:53] inside. But he doesn't start pouring
[1:35:55] wine. Let's say, can you imagine wine in
[1:35:57] a mason jar? Anyway, milk and a and a
[1:36:00] glass like that that's come out of the
[1:36:01] yard and and No, no, no, no, no. Now
[1:36:04] it's got to be scoured. It's got to be
[1:36:06] really clean. Now,
[1:36:08] going to take some soap.
[1:36:10] Going to take some Dawn detergent.
[1:36:13] I want you to know some of your
[1:36:15] fancymancy
[1:36:18] uh organic
[1:36:20] all natural
[1:36:23] Amazon purchases
[1:36:27] uh dishwashing stuff. May not get it
[1:36:30] clean enough.
[1:36:32] You might have I know this is not much
[1:36:34] of an advertisement, is it? You you you
[1:36:37] may need you some of that old Dawn
[1:36:40] liquid detergent. got so many chemicals
[1:36:43] in it, nothing's going to stay on your
[1:36:45] dish.
[1:36:46] It'll burn them right off probably. You
[1:36:48] scrub that thing. That's brother Bannon
[1:36:50] said that's like sanctification.
[1:36:53] You you really get it all cleaned up.
[1:36:56] Then you pour something in it. He said
[1:36:58] now you're pouring in. That's like the
[1:37:00] Holy Ghost. You're not worthy fit to be
[1:37:03] filled up when you're laying out there
[1:37:05] in the dirt. You got to be picked up out
[1:37:07] of that dirt. Thank God he justified us.
[1:37:10] Amen.
[1:37:10] Thank God he redeemed us out of our
[1:37:12] sinful, dirty yard mess. And then you
[1:37:15] got to go through the process of
[1:37:17] scouring out. Thank God he sanctified us
[1:37:20] with the washing of the water of the
[1:37:21] word. And we're still in that
[1:37:23] sanctification process. Now we really
[1:37:26] are.
[1:37:27] But by grace, by mercy, he baptized us
[1:37:30] with the Holy Ghost because he saw our
[1:37:32] heart.
[1:37:33] There's some people think you've got to
[1:37:35] be clean enough, perfect enough, holy
[1:37:37] enough. Let me tell you something. And
[1:37:38] God will give you his spirit if you're
[1:37:41] sincere enough and if your heart is
[1:37:43] fixed on him.
[1:37:45] But that doesn't mean you can keep on
[1:37:46] doing the things you've been doing.
[1:37:50] He gives you the Holy Ghost to give you
[1:37:52] what? He said you shall be endued with
[1:37:55] what?
[1:37:56] Power.
[1:37:57] Power.
[1:37:58] Power in the Greek dunamis. It's the
[1:38:01] word from which we get dynamite. You're
[1:38:04] going to have dynamite put in you. My
[1:38:06] Holy Ghost is going to come and live
[1:38:08] inside of you. So we are saved,
[1:38:11] justified, redeemed by the grace and by
[1:38:14] the purchase price of the blood of the
[1:38:16] lamb. We are sanctified by the washing
[1:38:19] of the water of the word and we are put
[1:38:21] in service as we are filled with the
[1:38:24] Holy Ghost. So this is just a process.
[1:38:26] We may not be all the way there yet, but
[1:38:29] tell them when you saw me.
[1:38:32] Tell them when you saw me, I was on my
[1:38:35] way.
[1:38:36] I tell you what I'm not doing. I'm not
[1:38:38] sitting there, why should we just sit
[1:38:40] here till we die. I'm not just sitting
[1:38:42] somewhere uh seeing just how stagnant I
[1:38:46] can be, how static I can be.
[1:38:50] I'm going to move. I'm going to move
[1:38:51] when he moves. How many of you want to
[1:38:54] move when the spirit of the Lord When
[1:38:56] the spirit of the Lord falls upon my
[1:38:58] heart? I will dance like David dance. I
[1:39:01] don't care what you think about it. I
[1:39:04] don't care what it looks like to the
[1:39:05] world.
[1:39:07] When the spirit of God falls on my
[1:39:09] heart, I'm going to dance like David
[1:39:11] dance. I'll shout like David shouted.
[1:39:14] Somebody said it's too noisy over there.
[1:39:16] Don't go to hell
[1:39:18] and don't go to heaven.
[1:39:22] This is the quietest world you'll ever
[1:39:23] live in. Because I guarantee you when
[1:39:26] those when those beautiful home gates
[1:39:29] click behind your heels,
[1:39:32] even a Methodist, even a Baptist,
[1:39:36] even a Church of Christ, if any of them
[1:39:38] make it all the way, just like if you
[1:39:40] and I make it all the way.
[1:39:42] It It'll make you want to holler. It'll
[1:39:44] make you want to get a little excited.
[1:39:46] Amen. What I have, what I feel, what's
[1:39:49] inside of me is better than SEC
[1:39:52] football.
[1:39:53] Yeah,
[1:39:55] it's better than the great big boxing
[1:39:57] matches of this world.
[1:40:00] This is life.
[1:40:01] And we're in a process of becoming uh
[1:40:04] what the king would desire for us to be.
[1:40:06] But once that fermentation starts
[1:40:09] getting a little more violent, uh you
[1:40:11] got to be careful where you put it.
[1:40:13] You're not going to want to put it in an
[1:40:15] old bottle. You're going to want to put
[1:40:17] it in a new bottle when that secondary
[1:40:20] fermentation starts taking place. Are
[1:40:22] you following me?
[1:40:24] So wine begins its fermentation process
[1:40:27] in a dark sealed place where the wine is
[1:40:32] changed over time and in stillness.
[1:40:36] Don't get in a hurry. I shouldn't tell
[1:40:38] some of you not to get in a hurry
[1:40:43] because some of you already move like
[1:40:45] molasses in the winter. I mean
[1:40:47] spiritually. You can't rush God. If
[1:40:51] sister if Sister Crawford was here,
[1:40:53] she's there. She don't care. She's
[1:40:55] there. She made it all the way over. But
[1:40:57] if she was here this morning, she'd kick
[1:40:59] her little shoe and and sing, "You can't
[1:41:03] hurry, God.
[1:41:07] You just got to wait.
[1:41:10] You You You can't rush the process.
[1:41:13] You've just got to yield to the
[1:41:15] process." Somebody said, "I don't even
[1:41:16] know how to do that." Praise the Lord in
[1:41:18] the storm. Praise him in the rain.
[1:41:21] Praise him in the good time. Praise him
[1:41:23] in the hard time. Hello.
[1:41:28] I don't want you sleeping in here this
[1:41:30] morning.
[1:41:31] I want you to be awake because I want
[1:41:33] you to understand you don't wait till
[1:41:35] you get it all to praise him.
[1:41:38] Got to praise him now.
[1:41:40] Got to praise him now. What's somebody
[1:41:43] going to think of me? You'll never be
[1:41:44] anybody for God until you get to the
[1:41:46] place where you don't care
[1:41:48] what somebody else thinks about your
[1:41:50] praise.
[1:41:53] We're not all going to praise alike,
[1:41:55] but we're going to praise him.
[1:41:58] Amen.
[1:41:59] I don't care if it hair liips the devil
[1:42:01] and bankrupts hell.
[1:42:04] I'm going to praise him.
[1:42:05] Jerry's going to praise the Lord.
[1:42:08] He's going to praise the Lord whether we
[1:42:10] like it, whether we don't like it,
[1:42:11] whether the devil don't like it. Come
[1:42:13] on. Because God's been good to him.
[1:42:16] You and I, the same way he's been good
[1:42:18] to us. So, the first initial
[1:42:20] fermentation, as we looked at last week,
[1:42:23] it takes place in the Yakub, which is
[1:42:25] the second vat of the wine press. Would
[1:42:28] you put up that picture, wine press one?
[1:42:30] Uh would you put that up there? And
[1:42:32] let's just be reminded. You see, uh up
[1:42:35] at the top is where they stomp on the
[1:42:37] grapes. And then there's a channel that
[1:42:39] leads down into the lower vat, the ye in
[1:42:43] Hebrew. And we mentioned to you that
[1:42:46] there are these uh lids. Do you see the
[1:42:48] split lid there? And and that lid will
[1:42:52] be laid on top of that lower vat for the
[1:42:55] first process of fermentation to begin
[1:42:58] to take place. It's not nearly as
[1:43:00] violent there. It has some room to
[1:43:03] expand. You see that vat is large and it
[1:43:06] it begins its process of transformation
[1:43:10] both in darkness and in a in a
[1:43:13] relatively sealed environment where
[1:43:15] where no uh insect is getting in and no
[1:43:19] extra dirt uh is getting in it. It's got
[1:43:22] to be a somewhat a pure environment
[1:43:25] because fermentation is a natural
[1:43:28] process of yeast that is building up and
[1:43:31] it starts slow and just a little and it
[1:43:34] starts expanding and as that natural
[1:43:36] yeast begins to expand through the juice
[1:43:40] that fermentation process takes place.
[1:43:43] We call that lower vat the King James
[1:43:45] version of the Bible calls that lower
[1:43:47] vat uh the the wine fat. It's called the
[1:43:51] wine fat F A or the press fat F A
[1:43:57] because it is the results of the
[1:43:59] pressing. The crushed juice can also be
[1:44:02] poured into a separate vessel for
[1:44:04] additional fermentation. It would mostly
[1:44:06] most usually be an earthn jar, but in in
[1:44:09] some cases uh it could be a skin for for
[1:44:14] a shorter duration. At the end of 40
[1:44:16] days, stay with me. We're going
[1:44:18] somewhere. At the end of 40 days, it was
[1:44:20] regarded as properly wine, and it could
[1:44:23] then be offered by the priest as a drink
[1:44:26] offering unto the Lord. Now, the Lord's
[1:44:28] already got three portions out of this
[1:44:29] juice.
[1:44:32] Same same grapes.
[1:44:34] He got the first portion of the grapes.
[1:44:37] When the fermentation process started,
[1:44:39] he got the first process of that. The
[1:44:41] first tithe of that, he got that. And
[1:44:45] that is what it is. It's like a
[1:44:48] preserved grape juice. And this is most
[1:44:51] likely what was what was uh uh drank
[1:44:54] more commonly in the time of the Bible.
[1:44:57] Yes, enough fermentation in it to uh
[1:45:02] purify it and to keep it from spoiling
[1:45:05] as rapidly, but not enough fermentation
[1:45:08] to to drink a one glass and be buzzed or
[1:45:12] drunk or feel inebriated by it. And so I
[1:45:16] don't care how many Baptist commentaries
[1:45:19] will tell you that there was no
[1:45:21] fermentation in the juice. Anybody
[1:45:24] that's ever been to that part of the
[1:45:26] world knows you're not keeping grape
[1:45:28] juice overnight in that hot climate.
[1:45:31] You're not going to have you're not
[1:45:33] going to have vinegar first. You're
[1:45:34] going to have mold.
[1:45:36] Mold is going to be and I don't see the
[1:45:38] disciples drinking mold on top of their
[1:45:40] juice. So, it was new wine, meaning
[1:45:44] juice that had just began the
[1:45:46] fermentation process. Now, we're going
[1:45:48] to eventually pour that wine out of that
[1:45:52] lower vat, and we're going to start
[1:45:54] putting it either in a clay vessel or in
[1:45:56] a skin. And guess what? The Lord gets
[1:45:59] the first portion of that. Same grapes,
[1:46:02] same juice, same wine. Now, he gets a
[1:46:05] portion of that.
[1:46:08] Is God greedy? I don't think he's greedy
[1:46:12] at all. I think he just wants to look
[1:46:14] for ways to bless us.
[1:46:17] Do you believe Israel got a blessing
[1:46:19] every time they gave God what was his?
[1:46:21] I know they did.
[1:46:23] I know they did. The Bible's clear about
[1:46:25] that, isn't it?
[1:46:26] And so there there were some other ways.
[1:46:29] I'll show you this in just a minute. So
[1:46:31] at the end of the 40 days, the Lord gets
[1:46:32] a drink offering. The the practice after
[1:46:35] this point seems to be varied a little
[1:46:37] bit depending on what kind of wine was
[1:46:39] being made and in what area of the
[1:46:41] Middle East it was being made in. The
[1:46:44] leaving the wine in the fermentation
[1:46:46] vessel usually would interfere with its
[1:46:48] improvement. It would begin to
[1:46:50] degenerate. So they wanted to after 40
[1:46:53] days they wanted to transfer it into
[1:46:55] either as I said a clay vessel an
[1:46:58] amphora or into a wine skin. Not every
[1:47:02] jar was fit. If it was going to be a w a
[1:47:06] vessel used for fermentation, it had to
[1:47:08] be clean. It had to be sound. And it had
[1:47:11] to be uncracked
[1:47:15] because if it was clean, the dirt, the
[1:47:18] residue would hinder the process. You
[1:47:20] got to be clean.
[1:47:22] Who will ascend the holy hill of the
[1:47:23] Lord?
[1:47:24] Pure heart, clean hands.
[1:47:26] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:47:28] You got to be sound.
[1:47:31] You've got to be in your right mind.
[1:47:34] Everybody thinks they are.
[1:47:37] Mental illness is an epidemic
[1:47:40] in this nation.
[1:47:42] Part of the epidemic of mental illness
[1:47:44] is related to dopamine addiction.
[1:47:49] The the rewiring of the brain by
[1:47:52] artificial intelligence and by the means
[1:47:56] of which we get our dopamine fix. The
[1:47:59] rewiring of the brain is causing an
[1:48:02] epidemic of one form or another of
[1:48:05] mental illness. And that can that can
[1:48:07] range from from schizophrenia all the
[1:48:11] way down to narcissistic syndrome and
[1:48:15] beyond.
[1:48:16] It's mental illness. It's unwellness.
[1:48:20] And and there's a promise in the word
[1:48:22] that you don't have to live like that.
[1:48:25] You don't have to live the rest of your
[1:48:26] life in PTSD. You don't have to you
[1:48:30] don't have to live the rest of your life
[1:48:32] with an overactive stress response.
[1:48:34] There's something to heal you. Every
[1:48:36] stripe he took on his back. You
[1:48:39] shouldn't have to live your whole life
[1:48:40] with panic attacks and with anxiety and
[1:48:43] and uncontrollable depression. His word
[1:48:46] has come to heal us.
[1:48:48] It may be a process.
[1:48:50] It may not be overnight,
[1:48:52] but God knows how. We know that God is
[1:48:55] so good. He created the brain with the
[1:48:57] ability for the brain to heal itself.
[1:49:00] Epigenetics. And this epigenetics was
[1:49:03] one time considered something that
[1:49:06] wasn't possible. But God is good. He
[1:49:09] told us in his word all along that if
[1:49:11] our mind would stay on him.
[1:49:13] This is a neuroplasticity that we're
[1:49:15] talking about.
[1:49:16] If our mind was stayed on him, he said
[1:49:18] if your mind is stay I will keep him.
[1:49:22] I will keep her in perfect peace.
[1:49:27] whose mind is stayed on on him on me. He
[1:49:30] said,
[1:49:31] and I believe that with all my heart
[1:49:34] that we can be healed from it.
[1:49:37] And being someone who has dealt with
[1:49:40] depression, being with someone who was
[1:49:42] diagnosed with with a with an overactive
[1:49:45] stress response, I understand and many
[1:49:48] others here understand what it can feel
[1:49:51] like and what it can be like. But we
[1:49:54] must never accept what the enemy wants
[1:49:56] to put on us as final.
[1:50:01] That's right.
[1:50:02] We must sing with with Benjamin this
[1:50:04] morning.
[1:50:05] Fear will come.
[1:50:08] Fear will anxiety may come.
[1:50:12] Has to go in Jesus' name.
[1:50:14] Somebody said, "I think that's false
[1:50:15] hope." I tell you, I think it's Bible
[1:50:17] hope. I think it's what the scripture
[1:50:19] teaches us. So, not every jar, it can't
[1:50:21] be dirty. It's got to be sound. It can't
[1:50:24] be cracked. Well, I guess at one time or
[1:50:27] another, we were all cracked.
[1:50:29] Aren't you glad that Jesus knows how to
[1:50:31] put even a crack vessel back on the
[1:50:34] wheel?
[1:50:36] That was Sister Tibo's song, Pastor Sing
[1:50:39] again.
[1:50:42] He didn't throw the clay away. Sing it
[1:50:44] again. He didn't throw the clay away.
[1:50:47] First time she came into the church with
[1:50:49] a little dress barely to her knees and
[1:50:53] hair all colored up and c chopped off
[1:50:56] and blue eyes. You know, she was really
[1:50:58] fixed up pretty. I didn't know her. I
[1:51:01] just knew God was calling to her. I'd
[1:51:03] never met Brother Tibo, Billy's dad. God
[1:51:06] showed me a vision of where he was
[1:51:08] hiding his stuff.
[1:51:12] Showed me the hiding place. He'd been
[1:51:14] lying to his wife for years and years
[1:51:17] and hiding his stuff. You know what? God
[1:51:20] exposed him. Not because he wanted to
[1:51:22] embarrass him. He wasn't there.
[1:51:25] He wanted her to go home and understand
[1:51:28] and he wanted her to go home and tell
[1:51:29] him there's a better way. She told him
[1:51:31] and God saved him and delivered him.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah.
[1:51:35] And he had to go show her the hiding
[1:51:37] place
[1:51:38] and God saved her. And we were singing
[1:51:40] that song. He didn't throw the clay
[1:51:42] away. She was raised as a Pentecostal as
[1:51:45] a little girl. She saw what it was real,
[1:51:48] what was real, and what it but she had
[1:51:49] gotten away from it. Let me tell you
[1:51:51] something. God knows how to pull us
[1:51:52] back.
[1:51:53] You may be ashamed of where you've come
[1:51:55] from in the faith, but I'm not ashamed
[1:51:57] of the old Pentecostal church. I'm not
[1:51:59] ashamed of what God did for us there.
[1:52:01] I'm thankful that he's bringing us into
[1:52:03] himself.
[1:52:07] But I'm thankful.
[1:52:09] In those days, we were so desperate to
[1:52:11] have a musician that they would put
[1:52:13] somebody up who was hardly clean. Hardly
[1:52:15] clean.
[1:52:17] And they just thought, well, we got to
[1:52:19] have a guitar player even if he even if
[1:52:21] he played in the honky junk honky tonk
[1:52:23] last night. Well, we just need him. We
[1:52:25] need the music. Well, we're not in that
[1:52:27] place anymore
[1:52:28] cuz we'll sing ac cappella if we have
[1:52:30] to.
[1:52:32] If you want to do something for God, you
[1:52:34] can make a little adjustment in your
[1:52:35] life. Amen.
[1:52:37] All right. Look, I want to show you a
[1:52:39] couple pictures here uh of what one some
[1:52:42] of these wine vessel wine- making
[1:52:44] vessels look like. Uh especially the
[1:52:48] ones that are mentioned in the Bible at
[1:52:50] the first miracle of Jesus. These were
[1:52:53] ceramic jugs. The plural is amphora. and
[1:52:56] and these are some that have been found
[1:53:00] in Israel
[1:53:02] and put back together.
[1:53:04] Now, a couple of these were barely
[1:53:07] damaged at all and others have been
[1:53:10] glued back together. And down here,
[1:53:12] you've got a collection of just the
[1:53:14] spouts. These are amphora that date all
[1:53:18] the way back to the time of Christ.
[1:53:20] These clay vessels are 2,000 years old.
[1:53:23] That's kind of That's kind of amazing,
[1:53:25] isn't it? it is to me. I've enjoyed
[1:53:28] looking at them. I've seen these
[1:53:29] particular vessels in person. And then
[1:53:32] let me show you another one. Image 59.
[1:53:35] This is another uh uh style of of a
[1:53:39] wine- makingaking vessel made of earth
[1:53:41] or made of clay. But more often the wine
[1:53:46] would uh if it belonged to a nomadic
[1:53:48] people. Do you know what that means? It
[1:53:50] means they did you know there are still
[1:53:52] nomads today. Both the Drews and the
[1:53:56] Bedawins are tribes that live in the
[1:53:59] Middle East that still live in tents
[1:54:03] with camels. You you're you can be right
[1:54:05] outside the modern city of Jericho and
[1:54:07] look and see an encampment in Israel
[1:54:09] right now today of Bedawins. They're
[1:54:13] unusual people. They they they have
[1:54:15] their cattle with them and they'll
[1:54:17] settle a little while in a place they'll
[1:54:19] pick up and go. They couldn't haul these
[1:54:21] big clay vessels like this all over the
[1:54:23] desert. They didn't know where they were
[1:54:25] going to end up next. And so they used
[1:54:27] what we call uh skins, wine skins.
[1:54:33] And the the real word that's used in the
[1:54:36] scripture I read Matthew 2:22.
[1:54:39] It it's translated by King James is
[1:54:41] bottle. But there were no bottles.
[1:54:44] There were no bottles. It would have
[1:54:46] either been referring to something like
[1:54:48] what you're seeing there made out of
[1:54:49] clay, a jug, or an earthn vessel. If you
[1:54:53] if you think of a bottle like a like a
[1:54:55] wine bottle, there were no such things.
[1:54:58] Not in the second temple period. More
[1:55:01] likely, they were wine skins. You want
[1:55:04] me to show you what that would look
[1:55:06] like? If the wine belonged to a nomadic
[1:55:08] people, they would use wine skins like
[1:55:10] the ones you see there. for this
[1:55:12] purpose. These are very often the
[1:55:14] bottles that you read about in the
[1:55:16] Bible. These wine bottles or skins were
[1:55:20] made out of a goat skin and they were
[1:55:22] sewn together where it had been cut to
[1:55:25] remove it from the carcass. So, what
[1:55:27] you're looking at there is a more modern
[1:55:30] sort of a modern take on what a wine
[1:55:32] skin would have looked like. Just a bag
[1:55:35] made out of goat skin. Uh, pretty solid.
[1:55:40] And and the next picture is a bedawin.
[1:55:42] This particular picture was made in
[1:55:44] Petra of Jordan. And this wine skin is
[1:55:48] hung on uh you know a a piece of um
[1:55:53] wood. These sticks are tied together
[1:55:55] made into something that you could
[1:55:57] almost use for a teepee. And that is a
[1:56:00] wine skin. And now there's no wine in
[1:56:03] that. That's actually milk in that wine
[1:56:06] skin or in that skin. And do you all
[1:56:09] know what he's doing?
[1:56:11] Can anybody guess what he's doing with
[1:56:12] the milk that's in that wine skin or in
[1:56:15] that animal skin? He's churning it to
[1:56:17] make butter
[1:56:20] by swinging it.
[1:56:25] Can you imagine,
[1:56:28] David? I wonder how long it'd take to
[1:56:30] make butter in that.
[1:56:33] It would take quite a while.
[1:56:36] And it's back and forth in that heat and
[1:56:39] uh you're going to get you're going to
[1:56:41] get buttermilk way before you get
[1:56:43] butter. But butter melts and the heat is
[1:56:46] going to be there. So what you were most
[1:56:48] likely getting is not going to look like
[1:56:50] the yellow butter you put on your table.
[1:56:53] It would look a little bit more like a
[1:56:54] sour cottage cheese. But anyway, it
[1:56:57] would serve the purpose. But that'll at
[1:56:59] least show you what a skin would look
[1:57:01] like. Now when they when they removed
[1:57:04] that skin from the carcass, it formed a
[1:57:06] sack. They tied it up. It could be tied
[1:57:08] at the neck and hung up like what you
[1:57:10] see. The resilience of that new rawhide
[1:57:13] took up whatever expansion might be
[1:57:16] needed for the process of fermentation.
[1:57:18] Of course, in the Bible days, no one
[1:57:21] would think about putting new wine in an
[1:57:24] old animal skin, one that had already
[1:57:28] been used, dried up and cracked. from
[1:57:32] the previous years of wear and and uh
[1:57:36] this would actually be unsafe and that's
[1:57:38] why we read again in Matthew 9:17
[1:57:42] neither do men put new wine into old
[1:57:45] bottles else the bottles break and the
[1:57:49] wine runth out and the bottles perish
[1:57:52] but they put new wine into new bottles
[1:57:55] and both are preserved. the word new in
[1:57:58] this verse, both verses, both both in in
[1:58:02] Matthew and and also in uh Luke, excuse
[1:58:05] me, Mark, although the Gospels, they all
[1:58:08] mention this this verse.
[1:58:11] The word new here is referring to wine
[1:58:15] that has just began the process of
[1:58:17] fermenting. And I mention it because
[1:58:19] it's still alive. It's still active.
[1:58:23] It's still volatile. It's still moving.
[1:58:27] The new wine still has energy. It still
[1:58:30] has movement. It still has bubbling
[1:58:33] gases in it. It hasn't yet settled down.
[1:58:37] Somebody say, "We need some of that."
[1:58:40] Oh Lord, we need some of that new life.
[1:58:43] We need some of that new wine. I saw
[1:58:46] some of it this morning causing people
[1:58:49] to get out of their comfort zone and
[1:58:52] magnify the Lord
[1:58:54] because he's moving in us. Have you ever
[1:58:57] felt the spirit of God bubbling up in
[1:58:59] you like a like an artisian well and you
[1:59:03] could feel that spirit of the Lord? No
[1:59:05] wonder Jesus said out of men's bellies
[1:59:07] will flow rivers
[1:59:10] of of living water.
[1:59:14] Living water coming out of us. That's
[1:59:18] Jesus. He's the source of that. He's the
[1:59:21] source of the new wine. When he talks
[1:59:24] about old bottles here, he's talking
[1:59:26] about unyieldedness.
[1:59:28] Inflexible people. Did you know you were
[1:59:31] inflexible?
[1:59:33] Did you know you you you have no sp some
[1:59:36] of us have no spontaneity at all?
[1:59:40] Did you know that some of us have no
[1:59:41] elasticity?
[1:59:43] We're not happy unless it's the same old
[1:59:45] way,
[1:59:49] nothing new. We don't want anybody new
[1:59:51] on the piano. We don't want anybody new
[1:59:53] on the organ. We don't want anybody new
[1:59:55] leading a song. We don't want any new
[1:59:57] preacher. We don't want any We don't
[1:59:59] want anything new. We don't want a new a
[2:00:02] new uh let's see what we can say. You
[2:00:04] know th this this will do. This is fine.
[2:00:07] We don't need any more. No need to
[2:00:09] paint. Good paint. Got good paint. No
[2:00:11] need to paint. Just a change of color.
[2:00:12] But spiritually we become worse.
[2:00:18] Three songs,
[2:00:21] one special
[2:00:23] preaching 35. Let's say we're talking
[2:00:25] about the modern church 20 minute
[2:00:28] sermon.
[2:00:30] and get out by 12
[2:00:33] so we can fight the crowd at Western
[2:00:35] Sizzling, if there is such a thing
[2:00:36] anymore.
[2:00:38] This is old bottles. Let me tell you
[2:00:40] something. The new wine
[2:00:43] that that the kind that's moving, the
[2:00:45] kind that's still bubbling and purifying
[2:00:48] and getting sweeter and more valuable.
[2:00:50] That movement of God, God moving in us
[2:00:53] and us moving for him. You got to move.
[2:00:56] You got to move. We used to sing it.
[2:00:57] Amen. You may be high. You may be low.
[2:00:59] But when God gets ready, you got to
[2:01:01] move.
[2:01:04] You just got to move. You got to be
[2:01:05] willing to obey. You got to be willing
[2:01:07] to change. You got to be willing to go.
[2:01:09] When God says go and stay when God says
[2:01:12] stay.
[2:01:15] Hallelujah.
[2:01:16] My granny, you know, she bought that
[2:01:18] piano. And in fact, my granny did buy
[2:01:20] that piano. I was just making making a
[2:01:22] story, but my granny did buy that piano.
[2:01:26] My granny bought that piano. You better
[2:01:28] not move it. That's where Granny wanted
[2:01:31] it. Well, she never saw this church. She
[2:01:33] didn't know where that piano is. She
[2:01:35] probably thought it was still at 8100
[2:01:37] Cooper Creek Road. Granny had it like
[2:01:39] that and she didn't want it dusted. I
[2:01:41] guess that's why it don't get dusted too
[2:01:43] much. No, it does. Sister Jennifer, I
[2:01:44] guess is key. I don't see much dust on
[2:01:47] it. Uh, you know how people get. I'm
[2:01:51] going to leave that church if you move
[2:01:52] the piano.
[2:01:54] Some people tell me, they've told me for
[2:01:56] years, I'd leave the church I'm in and
[2:01:57] go somewhere where there was life, but
[2:01:59] grandpa's buried in the back.
[2:02:02] I want you to know nobody's grandpa's
[2:02:04] buried on this property.
[2:02:07] So, if God's sending you somewhere else,
[2:02:09] you go. But I've told them, if you if
[2:02:12] you're really hungry for God, you'll dig
[2:02:13] grandpa up, do it legally now, and take
[2:02:16] him with you. But you wouldn't sit in a
[2:02:18] dead church because grandpa's tombstone
[2:02:20] is out back. God is a moving God. He's
[2:02:23] an alive God. His spirit is moving in
[2:02:27] his people.
[2:02:31] Just like that new wine, it's still
[2:02:33] bubbling. It's still moving. Old bottles
[2:02:38] uh look like fit containers, but they've
[2:02:40] lost the elasticity. They can't stretch
[2:02:42] when the pressure bills. They can't
[2:02:45] stretch when there's movement in the
[2:02:47] spirit. The This symbolizes a religious
[2:02:50] form without power. People who want the
[2:02:52] appearance of spirituality but resist
[2:02:55] any internal stretching.
[2:02:57] Come on.
[2:03:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:03:04] Somebody thinks I'm preaching at the
[2:03:06] wrong church.
[2:03:07] I know right where I am this morning. We
[2:03:10] can get this way.
[2:03:15] Hallelujah.
[2:03:17] No drums. It don't need no drums.
[2:03:22] Unless you bought them, it's none of
[2:03:24] your business.
[2:03:28] I mean, that's just way we got to get.
[2:03:30] We've got to get that way.
[2:03:32] Well, I didn't I didn't care nothing
[2:03:34] about no hydro seeding. Nobody asked.
[2:03:38] The the brothers who were in charge
[2:03:40] said, "This might work and it might save
[2:03:42] us thousands of dollars. So, this what
[2:03:44] we're going to try."
[2:03:46] the man who did this, he the man who who
[2:03:49] brought it out here, the older man that
[2:03:51] works, he said, "Now, I mean, we're not
[2:03:52] going to tell her, but but if this,
[2:03:54] we're going to we'll make this right.
[2:03:55] It's, you know, we're not going to leave
[2:03:57] you high and dry. Uh this clay, this red
[2:04:01] clay is not good." How many of you saw
[2:04:02] it this morning when you pulled on?
[2:04:04] Hallelujah. How many of you prayed and
[2:04:06] asked the Lord to let that grass take?
[2:04:08] So did I. Now, you've seen answered
[2:04:10] prayer
[2:04:11] because that's red clay and it was hard.
[2:04:14] have done got really crusty there for
[2:04:16] about 10 days of no water. But you know,
[2:04:19] a little water come on. Hallelujah. I
[2:04:22] went out a few times and told them crows
[2:04:24] to go right back where they come from
[2:04:26] because they come flying in here trying
[2:04:28] to eat the seed.
[2:04:30] Now, isn't that just how the devil
[2:04:31] works?
[2:04:33] I just stood on the part said, "Go.
[2:04:37] Get out of here, you old crow. Oh, that
[2:04:40] seed. That's $5,000 worth of seed.
[2:04:44] That's God's seed. You find some seed
[2:04:47] somewhere.
[2:04:48] Don't you just love the crazy life?
[2:04:54] Thank God they didn't get it all.
[2:04:57] God's making it grow out there. That's a
[2:05:00] blessing of the Lord.
[2:05:02] Don't become like 2 Timothy 3:5, having
[2:05:05] a form of godliness.
[2:05:08] Yeah.
[2:05:09] But denying the power.
[2:05:11] That's right.
[2:05:12] They'll tell you what Jesus did, but
[2:05:14] they don't know anything about what he
[2:05:15] is doing.
[2:05:17] How many of you want to know that he's
[2:05:18] still alive and well? He's alive and
[2:05:22] well, living in me to tell the world
[2:05:27] that he is the same.
[2:05:30] He's the same yesterday and today and
[2:05:35] forever.
[2:05:36] Jesus is alive
[2:05:40] and well.
[2:05:42] Do you believe he is?
[2:05:43] Then tell somebody
[2:05:46] he's not just some relic. He's a living
[2:05:49] reality in his people.
[2:05:52] We can't be satisfied with a form or a
[2:05:54] fashion.
[2:05:56] New wine demands a new vessel. The Lord
[2:05:59] will not waste his wine. He's searching
[2:06:01] for somebody who can be fresh, flexible,
[2:06:04] and have a yielded heart that can expand
[2:06:07] under pressure.
[2:06:09] That that just disqualifies stubborn
[2:06:12] people.
[2:06:13] Amen.
[2:06:15] Mule religion people.
[2:06:17] I know people that have what brother
[2:06:18] Brandham called mule religion.
[2:06:21] They say amen like an old mule,
[2:06:24] but they have no intention of changing
[2:06:26] their life.
[2:06:28] Brother Brandham said the bride is a
[2:06:30] thoroughbred.
[2:06:32] He said she doesn't have mule religion.
[2:06:34] He said oh mule preacher tell the truth
[2:06:37] and the and the mule will stick his ears
[2:06:38] up and say
[2:06:41] amen.
[2:06:42] Amen.
[2:06:43] He don't even know what he's amening.
[2:06:45] Right?
[2:06:46] Said he'll go right out and do the same
[2:06:47] old thing he's been doing all along.
[2:06:50] Don't even know the word is talking to
[2:06:51] him.
[2:06:52] She don't even know the word is talking
[2:06:54] to her. And yet she's got the hehaw just
[2:06:57] right. But he said, "Not a thorough
[2:06:59] bread."
[2:07:00] He said, "A thoroughb bread. She'll run
[2:07:02] just because she knows the whip's
[2:07:03] coming."
[2:07:05] She knows she's about to get the the
[2:07:08] word that says run on. And she's ready
[2:07:11] to run. How many of you would rather be
[2:07:13] a thoroughbred in this thing than a than
[2:07:16] a hehaw?
[2:07:17] That's right.
[2:07:19] Now this fermenting wine, it means it to
[2:07:22] me it symbolizes a revelation that's
[2:07:24] getting richer and realer in your heart.
[2:07:27] Doesn't mean new truth. It means a it
[2:07:29] means a fresh understanding of truth
[2:07:31] that has already been spoken in your
[2:07:33] life. Something perhaps you've already
[2:07:36] heard the prophet say, but it hasn't
[2:07:38] been made personally active in your life
[2:07:40] yet. That's why we need to let the
[2:07:43] process work. That's why we need to
[2:07:44] embrace what God is doing.
[2:07:47] Amen. I'm not quite done yet. So,
[2:07:49] squeeze out an amen and let's move on.
[2:07:52] Revelation doesn't stand still.
[2:07:55] Revelation by nature is always
[2:07:57] expanding. It's transforming. It's
[2:08:00] maturing
[2:08:02] from glory to glory.
[2:08:05] Amen. Many want a fresh outpouring, but
[2:08:08] they don't want to be stretched.
[2:08:12] Stretching is uncomfortable.
[2:08:14] Just leave it like it was. If it's not
[2:08:17] broke, don't try to fix it. Let's do
[2:08:21] today what we were doing 40 years ago
[2:08:24] exactly like we were doing it 40 years
[2:08:25] ago. Let's not get too modern, too
[2:08:29] excited, too.
[2:08:32] Let's not take what the world creates
[2:08:34] and sanctify it and use it for the
[2:08:36] kingdom. I've told you many times when
[2:08:39] the television first came out, everyone
[2:08:42] in the church knew it was going to be
[2:08:43] evil. Everyone in the church knew it was
[2:08:45] going to destroy families and lives. You
[2:08:47] can say amen or nothing. Doesn't matter.
[2:08:50] Still the truth. And yet the Lord fell
[2:08:52] on my granny one day and she rose to
[2:08:54] prophesy. And God spoke out of her lips
[2:08:56] and said, "It'll be used to drag many
[2:08:59] souls out of the kingdom. But I will
[2:09:02] also use it to spread my gospel in the
[2:09:05] last days. My name will be proclaimed
[2:09:08] declared in the far regions of this
[2:09:10] world for the sign of the end.
[2:09:14] I believe
[2:09:16] we could say that about the internet and
[2:09:17] everything else. The enemy will use
[2:09:19] anything and everything. The the devil
[2:09:22] will use a banjo,
[2:09:24] but that don't mean the king can't use
[2:09:26] it, too.
[2:09:29] There's folks who love the preaching
[2:09:30] here, but they won't come. They're local
[2:09:32] that could get here, but they won't come
[2:09:33] because there's instruments in the
[2:09:35] music. Oh my goodness.
[2:09:38] Use a little cotton in your ear. We
[2:09:40] don't care. Don't be cheated out of what
[2:09:43] God has for you perhaps in this day
[2:09:45] because the music got a little juky for
[2:09:48] your taste.
[2:09:52] We need some life.
[2:09:54] Maybe you don't. I do.
[2:09:56] If we don't have a little life, we'll
[2:09:58] slip right back into the things of the
[2:09:59] world. Just look at them.
[2:10:01] Just look at them. Many want that
[2:10:04] outpouring, but they don't want any
[2:10:05] stretching, any bubbling, any yielding.
[2:10:08] If you're not growing, you may be trying
[2:10:11] to pour something living into something
[2:10:12] lifeless.
[2:10:14] Your own old mindset or your wounded
[2:10:18] expectations,
[2:10:20] your hope deferred may be causing you
[2:10:24] not to receive new wine.
[2:10:27] Your hurt feelings may be causing you
[2:10:31] not to receive new wine.
[2:10:34] Are you willing to give the old skin
[2:10:37] away? Are you willing to let the old
[2:10:39] stuff slip away so that God can create a
[2:10:43] new vessel in you and fill you with new
[2:10:47] wine?
[2:10:48] God's pouring something into you. You're
[2:10:50] going to have to be renewed daily. I am,
[2:10:52] too. Or you'll risk spilling and wasting
[2:10:55] what he's doing in your life. You're
[2:10:56] going to have to be willing to grow.
[2:10:58] You're going to have to be willing to
[2:10:59] change your mind.
[2:11:04] You can't be so dyed in the wool that
[2:11:06] you can't follow what God's doing in
[2:11:08] this moment.
[2:11:10] It won't contradict the word.
[2:11:12] It can't contradict the word. God can't
[2:11:15] contradict himself.
[2:11:17] If you believe that, say amen.
[2:11:18] One paragraph, just one short paragraph,
[2:11:22] just a couple, three sentences from the
[2:11:23] end time evangelism. Brother Bram said,
[2:11:26] "The message still moves on."
[2:11:29] Oh, wait a minute. You're not going to
[2:11:31] say
[2:11:31] amen.
[2:11:35] Why? Because the message is not what
[2:11:38] comes out of one man's mouth.
[2:11:41] That's right.
[2:11:41] The message is that it is that and it's
[2:11:45] more.
[2:11:46] Amen.
[2:11:46] The message is the revelation of Jesus
[2:11:48] Christ.
[2:11:49] Brother Brandham tells us the Bible
[2:11:51] giver to cover.
[2:11:54] That's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:57] Even the places uh there is an there is
[2:11:59] a a a website you can go to called the
[2:12:01] message hub. Has anybody ever been
[2:12:04] there? The reason why it's of interest
[2:12:06] is because you can go in the Bible, find
[2:12:09] the verse of scripture that you're
[2:12:10] looking for, and if if Brother Brandham
[2:12:13] mentioned that verse by reference,
[2:12:15] there'll be a little number out there to
[2:12:16] the side. You can click on that number
[2:12:17] and it'll bring up the places where
[2:12:20] brother Brandham referred to that verse,
[2:12:22] either by by address or by content. And
[2:12:25] it I find it very interesting because
[2:12:28] you can read you can look at chapter
[2:12:29] after chapter after chapter after
[2:12:31] chapter of the Bible without one quote
[2:12:35] chapter and chapter and chapter. I you
[2:12:38] can look up some of the most valuable
[2:12:40] verses to me
[2:12:41] and there'll be no quote. And what that
[2:12:44] tells me is that brother Brandham
[2:12:46] brought everything he was to bring in
[2:12:48] the hour that he was to bring it.
[2:12:50] But the whole Bible reveals Jesus
[2:12:52] Christ. And there may be something in
[2:12:55] one of those verses that has no number
[2:12:57] at the end that God wants to help you
[2:12:59] and I tie together to something that he
[2:13:02] was telling us and move us a little
[2:13:04] closer in our personal acceptance of the
[2:13:07] revelation of Jesus Christ. If that
[2:13:09] confused you, you're easily confused
[2:13:12] because that's just what the word said.
[2:13:14] The message moves on.
[2:13:16] Israel followed, not Moses.
[2:13:21] Come on. They weren't just following a
[2:13:23] prophet.
[2:13:25] They were following a pillar of fire.
[2:13:27] [Music]
[2:13:29] And guess what? The pillar of fire
[2:13:31] didn't leave when Moses left.
[2:13:33] As I was with Moses. Ain't that what the
[2:13:36] scripture said?
[2:13:37] Where it stopped.
[2:13:39] They stopped. Where it went,
[2:13:42] they went. The pillar of fire is moving
[2:13:46] on. Somebody read the last word.
[2:13:50] Yes.
[2:13:51] And you and I, if we've got any sense at
[2:13:53] all, we'll move with it.
[2:13:55] You can't receive kingdom new wine if
[2:13:58] you're holding on to an old Pharisee
[2:13:59] skin.
[2:14:02] The spirit will stretch you beyond old
[2:14:03] religious limits.
[2:14:05] Revival ruptures religious rigidity.
[2:14:09] Some of you come here and you thought it
[2:14:11] was all emotion. Everything anybody was
[2:14:13] doing was emotion.
[2:14:14] And you squatchched it and you squeezed
[2:14:16] it and you let your religious uh nature
[2:14:22] stuff it
[2:14:23] and miss it.
[2:14:26] And some of you might not be in the mess
[2:14:27] you're in now if you'd have been a
[2:14:29] little more flexible when the spirit of
[2:14:30] the Lord began to move.
[2:14:33] And just because it didn't move that way
[2:14:34] where you were from didn't mean it
[2:14:36] wasn't real.
[2:14:37] If you were getting what you needed
[2:14:39] where you were, why didn't you stay
[2:14:40] there?
[2:14:41] See, that's how things work. God's
[2:14:44] moving on. You don't have to do like
[2:14:46] somebody else. But when you start
[2:14:48] discouraging others,
[2:14:49] come on.
[2:14:50] Then you have picked up the spirit of a
[2:14:52] Pharisee. That's right.
[2:14:53] Don't Don't do that. New wine isn't
[2:14:56] convenient. It ferments. It moves. It
[2:15:00] pressures you to change. I know folks
[2:15:01] aren't used to perhaps if you're
[2:15:03] streaming or visiting. You're not used
[2:15:04] to a sermon or service lasting this
[2:15:06] long. Uh but I'm sorry. I don't know
[2:15:09] what else to say if they didn't tell you
[2:15:11] before you got here they should have.
[2:15:13] And maybe they didn't because or before
[2:15:15] you tuned in or whatever because they
[2:15:17] thought you might not want to stay. But
[2:15:18] let me tell you something. We'll be done
[2:15:20] before SEC football would be over. We'll
[2:15:23] be done before a Braves game finishes.
[2:15:30] A Marvel movie.
[2:15:34] If I've got it within three hours, I've
[2:15:35] beat the Marvel movie.
[2:15:37] Hello.
[2:15:40] So, let's give more time to the world.
[2:15:43] No sir, you can do that at your church.
[2:15:46] But as the scripture teaches us from the
[2:15:49] ministry of Jesus, the best wine, you
[2:15:51] don't drink it first.
[2:15:54] The best wine comes at the end of the
[2:15:56] feast.
[2:15:57] Amen.
[2:15:58] In this analogy, you're the wine skin.
[2:16:00] Let God soften you, stretch you, and
[2:16:02] make you new again. Let God make you
[2:16:04] hungry again for more of his word, for
[2:16:07] more of his spirit, for more of his
[2:16:08] power, for his healing in your life.
[2:16:11] Somebody ought to squeeze an amen here.
[2:16:13] Let him soften you. Who who realizes
[2:16:16] your life has made you a little bit
[2:16:18] hardened?
[2:16:19] Lord, soften us with the oil. You know,
[2:16:22] you can take some oil and rub it on that
[2:16:23] old wine skin and get some more life out
[2:16:26] of it.
[2:16:28] Praise the Lord. Did I You know what? I
[2:16:31] I forgot to give them give them uh image
[2:16:34] 55 and see if some of them recognize
[2:16:36] theelves.
[2:16:38] You see you there.
[2:16:46] I didn't come to church to get insulted.
[2:16:49] Sometimes the Holy Spirit has to insult
[2:16:51] your mind to reach your heart.
[2:16:55] I I I almost named it.
[2:16:59] I almost put a name on it. I've been to
[2:17:01] church with that.
[2:17:04] How many of you have ever been to church
[2:17:05] with something like that? That is a What
[2:17:08] is that, Brother Shel? That's an old
[2:17:09] wine skin.
[2:17:12] It's that same beautiful thing you saw
[2:17:15] just a few minutes ago, except the other
[2:17:16] one was subtle and and it was it would
[2:17:19] move and stretch and it still had sheen
[2:17:21] and it still had life and color to it
[2:17:24] and it was going to get them through
[2:17:26] whatever they needed to get through. But
[2:17:28] this one here has not been oiled. It has
[2:17:31] dried out. It has no elasticity. If you
[2:17:34] were to try to pour wine in that thing,
[2:17:36] it would only be a matter of time before
[2:17:38] you had a face full of wine because it
[2:17:41] would explode. That's what Jesus was
[2:17:43] teaching. You don't take the new wine of
[2:17:45] the Holy Ghost or the new wine of the
[2:17:47] message of the hour and try to stuff it
[2:17:50] into an old dried up, dead,
[2:17:53] wrinkled up
[2:17:57] church form.
[2:18:02] We got to be made new.
[2:18:06] Anybody see yourself?
[2:18:08] I pray you don't ever look like that to
[2:18:10] God. I pray you don't ever explode like
[2:18:14] that. If you explode, I hope it's cuz
[2:18:16] you popped a cork.
[2:18:18] Not because you ripped your bag. Praise
[2:18:21] God.
[2:18:22] There's so much going on inside of us.
[2:18:25] When the word begins to stimulate this
[2:18:27] spirit within us by revelation,
[2:18:30] oh thank God. It makes you want to
[2:18:32] embrace the process. It makes you want
[2:18:34] to say, "Lord, just keep on pouring me
[2:18:36] from one vessel to another
[2:18:39] to leave behind that what I don't need.
[2:18:42] Let God soften you, stretch you, and
[2:18:44] make you new." God doesn't want to waste
[2:18:46] wine. If you won't yield, he'll find
[2:18:49] somebody else to pour it into.
[2:18:51] You know why some people always get
[2:18:52] blessed?
[2:18:56] cuz they've always got their mouth open.
[2:19:01] Fill me up, Lord.
[2:19:05] Come on.
[2:19:06] Amen.
[2:19:07] I didn't say they were loud mouths. I
[2:19:09] didn't say they had big mouths. I just
[2:19:11] said they had open mouth.
[2:19:14] Have you ever seen a mother bird
[2:19:17] when she goes to get the worm,
[2:19:20] she don't have to announce to her little
[2:19:21] baby birds, "All right, now birds,
[2:19:23] mama's got lunch." They smell it coming.
[2:19:27] And before she ever lands on the nest,
[2:19:29] every one of them's mouths open
[2:19:32] and they're ready for it. They don't
[2:19:33] know she's going to bite it in pieces
[2:19:35] and chew it up and spit it in their
[2:19:37] mouth, but she they'll take it however
[2:19:38] they can get it
[2:19:39] because they understand it's life to
[2:19:41] them.
[2:19:42] You take someone born of the word.
[2:19:45] You take somebody carrying the seed of
[2:19:47] God.
[2:19:48] You take somebody that has the DNA of
[2:19:50] the Holy Ghost inside of them.
[2:19:52] And you let a little word come down and
[2:19:54] I'll tell you, they'll catch it
[2:19:56] and they'll keep their mouth open
[2:19:57] waiting on some more. There's something
[2:19:59] wrong with some of us
[2:20:02] cuz we can miss a half a dozen services
[2:20:04] and we don't even care what was said
[2:20:06] while we're gone
[2:20:10] because we don't understand the value
[2:20:13] and we don't understand what God's doing
[2:20:16] because it's not fast enough to suit our
[2:20:18] busy lifestyle.
[2:20:20] He's taking his time. Hallelujah. But
[2:20:23] he's getting us ready. Oh, preparing us.
[2:20:27] As brother Hawk was praying, preparing
[2:20:30] us.
[2:20:31] Brother Brandham said, "I want to tell
[2:20:33] you what a real scriptural life is."
[2:20:36] He said, "A real scriptural life is one
[2:20:38] that casts out devils, heals the sick,
[2:20:41] and raises the dead."
[2:20:42] He said, "That's what a real scriptural
[2:20:44] life is."
[2:20:45] How many of you want that life?
[2:20:50] Glory. Come on.
[2:20:52] You want enough of the Holy Ghost in you
[2:20:54] that when you go into Walmart, the devil
[2:20:56] either has to come out or get out.
[2:21:01] Hallelujah.
[2:21:02] Boy, sometime we come in line, come in a
[2:21:04] restaurant and get in line, folks in
[2:21:06] front of us just start leaving. They
[2:21:08] don't even want to wait no more.
[2:21:11] Thank y'all. Thank y'all. Thank y'all.
[2:21:13] Cuz it just moves us right up to the
[2:21:15] front.
[2:21:16] Well, what do you think's wrong with
[2:21:17] them? I know exactly what's wrong with
[2:21:19] them. They can't stand that presence
[2:21:22] that it better be in every one of us.
[2:21:25] They can't take it. They don't even know
[2:21:27] why they're so agitated.
[2:21:32] I not too long ago saw a mama just slap
[2:21:34] her little little boy. Of course, he
[2:21:36] probably needed it, but not not like she
[2:21:38] did it.
[2:21:40] And I said, "Wonder what made that woman
[2:21:42] become so agitated with her son?" It was
[2:21:43] us that walked in and changed the
[2:21:45] atmosphere. It wasn't that little boy,
[2:21:47] right? She didn't even know why she
[2:21:48] become so agitated. She just popped him
[2:21:51] real good and didn't even know why she
[2:21:52] was popping him.
[2:21:55] You say, "I don't believe in such as
[2:21:56] that." Well, then you don't understand
[2:21:58] this life at all.
[2:21:59] Hallelujah.
[2:22:01] Somebody in here ought to expect things
[2:22:03] to shift.
[2:22:06] Let me tell you, let me tell you
[2:22:08] something. God was good. You heard
[2:22:09] Sister Gia's testimony. That micro burst
[2:22:11] that came right out here on the end of
[2:22:13] of 379 and 280, that could have been
[2:22:16] terrible.
[2:22:17] I don't know if you know anything about
[2:22:19] a micro burst, but it's an unusual
[2:22:21] terrible high pressure that comes
[2:22:24] straight down out of the sky and when it
[2:22:27] hits the ground, it pushes out those
[2:22:30] sheer winds in every direction. And
[2:22:33] there have been multiple times in this
[2:22:35] nation that micro burst took out
[2:22:37] buildings and took lives. And people
[2:22:40] immediately thought it was a tornado.
[2:22:42] But after they went back on the radar,
[2:22:44] they found out it wasn't a tornado at
[2:22:46] all. It was a micro burst. It comes so
[2:22:48] suddenly that there's no way to be
[2:22:50] prepared for it. And who would have
[2:22:53] thought one would have come just up the
[2:22:55] road right near Gia lives closer to it,
[2:22:58] I guess, than most any of us. took roo
[2:23:01] took those metal roofs off the uh the
[2:23:04] flea market there, knocked the power
[2:23:06] out. It happened so quick that people
[2:23:08] didn't even know what was hit. I want
[2:23:10] you to know there were there were people
[2:23:12] right around the area didn't have a
[2:23:13] piece of pine straw fall off the tree.
[2:23:16] Somebody said, "Why in the world are you
[2:23:18] even mentioning things like that?" I'm
[2:23:20] just going to talk about the goodness of
[2:23:21] God. I'm just going to talk about look,
[2:23:24] anybody can replace a 10 roof on a on a
[2:23:26] flea market shed,
[2:23:28] but thank God, Sister Gia's home didn't
[2:23:31] get
[2:23:32] ripped off its foundation. Have you seen
[2:23:35] what the waters doing? The Bible talks
[2:23:37] about the force and power of water and
[2:23:39] the force and power of fire. Have you
[2:23:41] seen what those floods are doing out
[2:23:43] there? It makes you wonder why people
[2:23:45] would want to buy build all for years
[2:23:47] and years and years why people would
[2:23:49] want to build these Christian camps for
[2:23:52] for small children in the world's worst
[2:23:55] flood zone, the nation's worst flood
[2:23:58] zone.
[2:24:00] It makes you wonder what people are
[2:24:01] thinking, doesn't it?
[2:24:03] Because if you've ever been in a place
[2:24:05] like Israel, uh do you know when when uh
[2:24:07] Sister J uh uh I'll get it in a minute.
[2:24:10] She's just my daughter. uh my uh bonus
[2:24:13] daughter Jenna. When Jenna's mother was
[2:24:16] here for Elelliana's birthday party, she
[2:24:18] went home and up until just a few days
[2:24:20] ago from the birthday party till now, it
[2:24:22] never has rained at her house. That's
[2:24:25] Texas. She lives in Texas. Few hours
[2:24:27] away from where this tragedy took place.
[2:24:29] The ground is so hard. The ground is so
[2:24:32] slick, especially in that area where
[2:24:35] this happened in and in that hill area
[2:24:38] that when that water and I've seen it
[2:24:40] happen in Israel the same way. When that
[2:24:42] water comes, it comes down, it has
[2:24:44] nowhere to go but forward like that
[2:24:45] flows right in to the river. And uh you
[2:24:48] know people uh uh will say the devil
[2:24:51] this, the devil that and this and that.
[2:24:53] Let me tell you something. Nothing
[2:24:54] happens in this world that God doesn't
[2:24:56] know it. He's not out to hurt. He's not
[2:24:59] out to harm. But he is out to make sure
[2:25:02] that you and I fulfill the purpose of
[2:25:05] our birth.
[2:25:07] And those little children, some of them
[2:25:08] went out of here singing the praises of
[2:25:10] God.
[2:25:11] So we know exactly where they were.
[2:25:14] Some of them not even at the age of
[2:25:15] accountability. Somebody said, "What do
[2:25:17] you want to say about that?" Well, if
[2:25:19] you want to read social media, it's the
[2:25:21] seed, the cloud seeding. It's this
[2:25:24] conspiracy theory here. It's this, that,
[2:25:26] or the other. Why don't you just take
[2:25:28] what the word of God says? The Bible
[2:25:30] said the gro creation,
[2:25:33] creation is groaning,
[2:25:36] the earth is talking
[2:25:38] and people are refusing to listen.
[2:25:41] God is saying once again, this thing is
[2:25:45] coming to an end.
[2:25:47] Will you party on the brink of disaster?
[2:25:53] Will you spend the night at the honky
[2:25:55] talk on the on the very precipice of
[2:25:58] eternity?
[2:26:02] Or will you surrender?
[2:26:05] Will you spend your life sitting in
[2:26:06] front of that idiot box and let your
[2:26:09] soul go to hell?
[2:26:10] Or will you make up your mind, I'm going
[2:26:12] to get full of God. I'm going to get
[2:26:14] full of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to one
[2:26:16] last time give my family trouble. I'm
[2:26:18] going to get so full of Jesus
[2:26:20] that they don't even want me at
[2:26:21] Thanksgiving
[2:26:24] because I can't leave them comfortable.
[2:26:26] I can't leave them comfortable. I've got
[2:26:28] to let them know that something is real.
[2:26:32] I want the musicians to get ready to
[2:26:34] come.
[2:26:37] We're pouring. We're being poured. We're
[2:26:39] being poured.
[2:26:42] Next time we come together, we'll begin
[2:26:43] the four vessels, a vessel of
[2:26:45] misunderstanding. But I want to leave
[2:26:47] you with this. No, I didn't fall. I am
[2:26:49] okay. Don't call the police. Don't call
[2:26:51] rescue squad. Levi's here. I'll be all
[2:26:54] right.
[2:26:57] He sees me gr grabbing my chest and
[2:27:00] gasping for air. He'll be up here and
[2:27:01] help me. I'll be all right.
[2:27:04] Uh this word lees or dregs that we're
[2:27:07] talking about, it means the grosser
[2:27:09] parts of any liquor or wine that settle
[2:27:12] down to the bottom of the vessel. We
[2:27:14] call it dregs. The Bible call it leaves,
[2:27:16] but it's like sediment and it's made up
[2:27:19] of several different things. It's made
[2:27:21] up of dead yeast cells. These are
[2:27:24] byproducts of fermentation. Yeast eats
[2:27:26] the sugar in the grape juice and
[2:27:28] converts it into alcohol and into CO2, a
[2:27:31] gas. Once their work is done, those uh
[2:27:35] those yeast cells die and settle down at
[2:27:37] the bottom. That dead yeast cell will
[2:27:40] change the taste of the wine. It's also
[2:27:44] grape skin particles. Particles of the
[2:27:46] skin, bits of skin, bits of seed, bits
[2:27:49] of stems that were not filtered out
[2:27:51] during the process of pressing that is
[2:27:55] also leaves and it will settle down to
[2:27:57] the bottom. The bitterness of the stem,
[2:27:59] the bitterness of the seed, the
[2:28:01] bitterness of a piece of that skin after
[2:28:03] it sits there in a fermenting juice, it
[2:28:06] will become bitter and it will even
[2:28:08] begin to smell like something that is
[2:28:11] rotting. You wouldn't want the wine to
[2:28:13] be uh flavored by that or even the
[2:28:16] fragrance to be affected by that.
[2:28:18] There's something also in fermenting
[2:28:20] juice called tartrates. And these are
[2:28:22] natural acids and mineral crystals which
[2:28:25] are often called wine diamonds. And it's
[2:28:27] it's very similar to the cells that
[2:28:29] crystallize in honey. And these diamonds
[2:28:32] these wine diamonds form during the
[2:28:35] process of fermentation. And sometimes
[2:28:37] if you're chilling uh the wine that has
[2:28:40] fermented, it will bring those uh uh
[2:28:42] crystals back to to a to a solid state.
[2:28:46] They fall down to the bottom and that
[2:28:48] can also contaminate the wine. And then
[2:28:50] there's a number of other organic
[2:28:52] matter, proteins, pectins, tiny bits of
[2:28:55] grape pulp, uh that will all settle and
[2:28:58] come down out of that juice or wine as
[2:29:00] it clarifies.
[2:29:02] And uh if you leave it there, just
[2:29:05] imagine now when we get through these
[2:29:07] vessels, you're going to have this
[2:29:09] picture already. You leave that there,
[2:29:11] it will change just like you putting
[2:29:14] some sprigs of rosemary in vinegar or or
[2:29:18] you put some some flavor of orange slice
[2:29:22] or something in honey, you can infuse
[2:29:25] the flavor of what you add. Well, in the
[2:29:27] same way that infusion can be a positive
[2:29:29] thing, infusion of something bitter can
[2:29:32] make the wine bitter. It can cause it to
[2:29:34] lose its value. Oh, God. I if there's
[2:29:37] jealousy in me, it's going to fall to
[2:29:39] the bottom eventually.
[2:29:41] And if somebody don't come along and
[2:29:43] disturb me,
[2:29:46] if somebody don't disturb me, then I'm
[2:29:48] just going to be bitter. My whole life
[2:29:50] will become embittered by my jealousy.
[2:29:55] My father rejected me. My mother chose
[2:29:58] the world for so many years over me.
[2:30:02] I know what this can do. It builds up
[2:30:04] resentments. It builds up all kinds of
[2:30:06] things in your life that just sort of
[2:30:08] settle down to the bottom and try to
[2:30:09] make you stink.
[2:30:15] Try to make you bitter.
[2:30:17] You're just around somebody five
[2:30:18] minutes. All they do every Lord have
[2:30:20] mercy.
[2:30:24] Like I've said before, there are some
[2:30:26] people you don't want to ask them how
[2:30:27] they're doing.
[2:30:32] Because nobody knows the trouble I've
[2:30:36] seen.
[2:30:37] They don't have a good thing to say
[2:30:39] about anything.
[2:30:41] You know, praising God for a job one
[2:30:43] week and complaining about it the next.
[2:30:48] You know what's good about that job you
[2:30:50] hate?
[2:30:52] You get to eat.
[2:30:57] Your wife gets to eat. Your children get
[2:30:59] to eat. Your children get to have shoes.
[2:31:03] Sometimes you just have to make the best
[2:31:05] and ask the Lord to give you something
[2:31:07] better. But you'll never get better from
[2:31:09] him. If you're only spending time
[2:31:12] murmuring and complaining about I'm
[2:31:14] telling you. I'm telling you. I'm
[2:31:16] telling you. The word will cleanse us.
[2:31:18] It'll help some of those things to
[2:31:19] settle down to the bottom. You can
[2:31:21] choose in the morning what kind of
[2:31:22] Monday you're going to have. Boy, I have
[2:31:24] to every Mondays are my hard day. And
[2:31:27] every Monday, I have to choose. Am I
[2:31:29] going to get am I gonna have a a lousy
[2:31:32] Monday, a tired Monday, a griping
[2:31:34] Monday, or am I going to have a Monday
[2:31:36] where you can be glorified in my mind
[2:31:38] and in my life? You make up your mind.
[2:31:41] I'm going to work today with Jesus in my
[2:31:43] heart. No matter whether it's a Monday
[2:31:44] or an or or or a whatever day it is,
[2:31:47] doesn't matter. Amen.
[2:31:48] Amen. So all this organic matter, if
[2:31:51] it's not dealt with, if it's not if
[2:31:53] you're if the good wine is not poured
[2:31:55] off the top and the yucky stuff left
[2:31:57] behind, then the wine is deeply
[2:32:00] affected. Each vessel in the wine-
[2:32:02] making process reflects a season of
[2:32:05] divine refinement. God is cleansing his
[2:32:09] people.
[2:32:10] God is preparing his people. God is
[2:32:14] getting his people ready
[2:32:18] for what he's going to do through them,
[2:32:21] in them, and through them in these final
[2:32:24] days. Come musicians. Moab was the one
[2:32:27] that Jeremiah was prophesying to.
[2:32:33] He was the one that the scripture
[2:32:34] rebuked. Jeremiah the prophet rebuked
[2:32:37] because he was settling in his leaves.
[2:32:39] He was finding peace. The actual
[2:32:41] translation of that is he was finding
[2:32:43] peace in his dregs.
[2:32:47] Did you know some people find their
[2:32:49] peace in their trouble?
[2:32:51] They find their peace in their problems.
[2:32:55] They are more satisfied
[2:32:58] in turmoil.
[2:33:00] Have you ever known anybody like that?
[2:33:04] If something wasn't stirring, if
[2:33:06] something wasn't stinking,
[2:33:10] they weren't
[2:33:12] shining.
[2:33:13] But it seems that if there's always a
[2:33:15] turmoil, you've got her in your family,
[2:33:20] you've got him in your family, you've
[2:33:22] got that one in your church. You know
[2:33:25] those people who seem to somehow thrive
[2:33:29] when there is some kind of
[2:33:32] you can't be that person.
[2:33:35] God called you to something better than
[2:33:37] that.
[2:33:38] Stay out of other folks's business.
[2:33:41] Let God work a work in your life and in
[2:33:43] your family before you start working on
[2:33:45] somebody else's life.
[2:33:55] Isn't that right?
[2:33:58] If I'm going to take parenting advice
[2:34:01] from any parent, it's going to be
[2:34:03] somebody
[2:34:05] who has children that they've raised in
[2:34:07] the faith.
[2:34:10] It's going to be somebody whose children
[2:34:12] are testifying, their life testifies
[2:34:16] that they were raised in a in a way that
[2:34:18] would be God edifying. I'm not going to
[2:34:21] take parenting advice from somebody.
[2:34:26] We all make big mistakes.
[2:34:29] We just have to be careful when we're
[2:34:30] trying to tell other people how to do
[2:34:32] it. Are you with me?
[2:34:35] There's a lot of misunderstanding that
[2:34:37] comes into our life. And that's that's
[2:34:39] the next vessel that we'll talk about.
[2:34:41] The lesson is this. Every time God pours
[2:34:44] us out, he's removing the residue of
[2:34:47] yesterday. Old offenses,
[2:34:50] overinflated ego,
[2:34:56] me and my four, no more.
[2:35:00] all of that stuff that troubles and
[2:35:02] affects our lives, he's trying to leave
[2:35:04] that behind so that only the best part
[2:35:07] of who we are goes forward.
[2:35:09] You know, it's it's a blessing.
[2:35:11] We ought to be thanking him instead of
[2:35:13] murmuring.
[2:35:14] He's taking us all the way from the
[2:35:16] grape vine until we we find ourselves in
[2:35:20] that beautiful chalice of the king. And
[2:35:24] and as we sing that song of worship,
[2:35:26] we've sung it even recently. I mentioned
[2:35:28] it and we sung it. Uh uh I want to be
[2:35:32] oil for his feet,
[2:35:35] wine for him to drink.
[2:35:37] I want to bring my Lord some. Look, I
[2:35:40] could never pay him. How many of you
[2:35:42] could never pay him for where where he's
[2:35:44] brought you from?
[2:35:45] There are addicts there. There are
[2:35:47] people in this room who have known the
[2:35:49] throws of addiction.
[2:35:52] addiction that conquered their life,
[2:35:55] affected their brain cells, destroyed
[2:35:58] their relationships.
[2:36:00] BC before Christ,
[2:36:02] he came, he changed, he delivered. He
[2:36:05] made the difference.
[2:36:07] That's the God we're talking about.
[2:36:09] No one in this room is too far that God
[2:36:11] can't reach out to you and draw you to
[2:36:13] him. Nobody's too late getting in. Not
[2:36:17] yet. He's still calling. He's still
[2:36:20] wooing. He's still pulling. Let's stand
[2:36:23] together.
[2:36:25] Thank you so much for your patience this
[2:36:28] morning and for your pull. Somebody
[2:36:31] pull. Thank you. Thank you for pulling.
[2:36:35] I know when we're breaking this down uh
[2:36:38] and and trying to hit every part, it can
[2:36:41] get a little bit monotonous, but uh
[2:36:45] you're going to start seeing if you
[2:36:47] haven't already seen yourself. you'll
[2:36:49] see yourself because as we mentioned in
[2:36:52] the introductory sermon, that next
[2:36:54] vessel is often a vessel of
[2:36:56] misunderstanding
[2:36:58] where it's between you and him. And
[2:37:01] nobody understands what's going on.
[2:37:05] Not even you sometime, but he always
[2:37:07] does.
[2:37:09] Everything you seem to do is being
[2:37:11] scrutinized and overjudged,
[2:37:14] criticized, and misunderstood. And God
[2:37:16] has allowed that.
[2:37:19] And it's hard not to want to defend,
[2:37:22] isn't it? But you have to sometime. He
[2:37:25] was led like a lamb to the slaughter.
[2:37:29] Are you with me?
[2:37:31] He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.
[2:37:33] He was dumb. The Bible said, dumb like a
[2:37:36] lamb before her sheerers. Led to the
[2:37:38] slaughter. And he uttered not a word. He
[2:37:41] laid down his life. It's in that place
[2:37:44] of misunderstanding and misjudgment
[2:37:47] where you are learning to lay down your
[2:37:50] life. Where you are learning not to
[2:37:52] defend yourself.
[2:37:54] We get so creative, church. We get so
[2:37:57] creative. We've learned how
[2:38:00] to persuade others
[2:38:04] without
[2:38:06] full explanation.
[2:38:08] We we've learned how to change someone's
[2:38:11] perception of someone else without ever
[2:38:15] telling the story with little innuendos,
[2:38:18] with little slight changes
[2:38:21] and twisting of things. And we've
[2:38:24] learned it as a survival mechanism.
[2:38:26] We're not here to survive. We're here to
[2:38:29] overcome.
[2:38:30] Let God leave all that behind now. And
[2:38:34] if you if you feel the need to defend
[2:38:37] yourself, just go talk to him about it.
[2:38:39] Lord, it would be so it would be so
[2:38:41] tempting to just uh scream out, "That's
[2:38:44] not right. You what you're hearing is
[2:38:46] not right." If you and I were to do that
[2:38:49] every time something come up, we'd be
[2:38:51] spending our whole life defending every
[2:38:53] action.
[2:38:55] Sometimes we just have to commit
[2:38:56] ourselves into Papa's hands
[2:38:58] and we have to say, "Lord, help those
[2:39:00] who don't understand. All I know is
[2:39:02] right here in this vessel of
[2:39:03] misunderstanding, you are changing me.
[2:39:07] You are getting out of me what needs to
[2:39:09] be left behind.
[2:39:12] You see, there there is a there is a
[2:39:14] meat that you and I will have to eat a
[2:39:17] whole lot of in this season,
[2:39:20] and that's the meat of obedience.
[2:39:23] That's the kind that says yes, Lord, to
[2:39:26] your will, to your way. just keep doing
[2:39:29] in me what you're doing and give me my
[2:39:31] family, Lord. I just want my family uh
[2:39:34] wherever they are today, I just want
[2:39:36] them to serve you and love you and know
[2:39:38] you the way that I love you. Don't you
[2:39:40] serve a great God?
[2:39:43] Beautiful God, faithful God, loving God,
[2:39:47] a tender God. Then let's take a moment
[2:39:50] to worship his name again before we
[2:39:52] leave here today. Why don't you come and
[2:39:54] help us? Why don't you that feel to come
[2:39:57] and just gather close and let's just
[2:39:58] tell the Lord, "Thank you, Lord, for p
[2:40:00] pouring me out. Thank you, Lord, for
[2:40:03] pulling me out.
[2:40:05] Thank you for taking me out of the
[2:40:07] farmyard and into the old sink,
[2:40:11] cleansing me and filling me up and
[2:40:13] getting me ready.
[2:40:15] I love you, Lord.
[2:40:18] Hallelujah.
[2:40:20] For your mercy fails me.
[2:40:25] And all my days
[2:40:28] I've been held in your hands.
[2:40:34] From the moment that I wake up
[2:40:38] until I lay my head.
[2:40:42] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:40:47] of God.
[2:40:51] Cuz
[2:40:53] all my life you have been faithful.
[2:41:00] And all my life you have been so so
[2:41:06] good.
[2:41:09] With every breath that I am able.
[2:41:14] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:41:19] of God.
[2:41:22] I love your voice,
[2:41:25] [Music]
[2:41:26] Lord. You have led me through the fire
[2:41:32] and darkest night.
[2:41:35] You are close like no other.
[2:41:40] Cuz I've known you as a father
[2:41:44] and I've known you as a friend
[2:41:48] and I have live in the goodness
[2:41:53] of God.
[2:41:55] Oh,
[2:41:58] cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[2:42:03] [Music]
[2:42:05] Oh, and all my life you have been so so
[2:42:10] good.
[2:42:13] Oh, with every breath that I am able.
[2:42:19] Oh, I will sing
[2:42:21] of the goodness
[2:42:23] of God.
[2:42:25] Oh, all my life.
[2:42:28] Cuz all my life you have been faith.
[2:42:33] Oh, you've been so faithful, Lord. And
[2:42:36] all my life, you have been so Lord,
[2:42:40] you've been so good.
[2:42:43] Oh, with every breath that I am able.
[2:42:49] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:42:54] of God.
[2:42:58] Oh, cuz your goodness is running after.
[2:43:02] It's running after me.
[2:43:06] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's
[2:43:09] running after me. Oh, with my life laid
[2:43:14] down, I surrender now. I give you
[2:43:18] everything.
[2:43:21] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:43:24] running after me. Oh, your goodness is
[2:43:30] running after. It's running after me.
[2:43:34] Oh, your goodness is running. It keeps
[2:43:39] running after me. Oh, with my life laid
[2:43:43] down, I surrender now. I give you
[2:43:47] everything.
[2:43:48] [Music]
[2:43:50] Your goodness, oh, it keeps running
[2:43:54] after me. Oh, your goodness is running
[2:43:59] after. It's running after me. It's your
[2:44:03] goodness. Your goodness is running
[2:44:07] after. It's running after me. Oh Lord,
[2:44:11] with my life laid down, I surrender now.
[2:44:15] I give you everything.
[2:44:18] [Music]
[2:44:19] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:44:23] running after me. Cuz
[2:44:29] all my life you have been faithful.
[2:44:36] And all my life you have been so so
[2:44:42] good.
[2:44:44] With every breath that I am able.
[2:44:50] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:44:55] of God.
[2:45:00] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[2:45:04] [Music]
[2:45:06] We wouldn't even be here if we had all
[2:45:08] my life. You have been so so good.
[2:45:14] [Music]
[2:45:16] With every breath that I am able,
[2:45:22] I will sing of the goodness
[2:45:27] of God.
[2:45:27] Do it one more time like that where we
[2:45:29] can hear the voices. All my life. All my
[2:45:33] life you have been faithful.
[2:45:40] And all my life you have been so so
[2:45:45] good.
[2:45:48] With every breath that I am able.
[2:45:54] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:45:59] of God.
[2:46:04] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:12] And all my life you have been so so good
[2:46:20] with every breath that I am able.
[2:46:26] I will sing of the goodness
[2:46:30] of God.
[2:46:32] Keep playing but soft. In a time like
[2:46:35] this, you don't want to have a flashback
[2:46:38] that brings a some bad memory to your
[2:46:41] mind. I don't know what in the world
[2:46:44] brought it to my mind,
[2:46:46] but it was the goodness of God in it.
[2:46:51] If you will allow the Lord some time to
[2:46:54] bring some of those painful things to
[2:46:56] your mind and show you where his
[2:46:59] goodness prevailed.
[2:47:01] I saw my mother running with me as a
[2:47:04] boy.
[2:47:05] She had grabbed me by the hand and she
[2:47:07] was really dragging me.
[2:47:11] I was probably too heavy to carry. I
[2:47:13] wasn't a wasn't a a toddler,
[2:47:18] so to speak.
[2:47:20] She was dragging me down the steps
[2:47:22] because her second husband was in a
[2:47:25] drunken rage again. And he had already
[2:47:28] broken bones in her body that she was
[2:47:31] still recovering from. And I saw her
[2:47:35] dragging me and I saw our hiding place.
[2:47:38] And I can show you the bush. It's still
[2:47:41] there in Columbus.
[2:47:44] And she shoved me in behind a bush.
[2:47:48] But she was breathing so hard from the
[2:47:50] pain of the beating that she had just
[2:47:53] endured that I just knew he was going to
[2:47:55] find us. And I remember thinking, "Oh,
[2:47:58] oh, I just wish she wasn't breathing so
[2:48:01] hard."
[2:48:03] He found us, but something had already
[2:48:06] shifted in him. And he was falling back
[2:48:09] into that religious
[2:48:12] upbringing that he had.
[2:48:14] And he knew that what he had done was
[2:48:16] wrong. Do you know that was the goodness
[2:48:18] of God spared my mama's life
[2:48:22] and perhaps even mine?
[2:48:26] I don't know why that I don't know why I
[2:48:28] saw it. I don't know why I'm mentioning
[2:48:29] it. I have mentioned it before, but
[2:48:33] perhaps there's someone here and it's a
[2:48:36] little hard for you to sing I've lived
[2:48:37] in the goodness of the Lord because
[2:48:39] you're remembering the times when things
[2:48:41] weren't good. The song doesn't say
[2:48:43] everything that happens to me is good.
[2:48:46] The Bible doesn't say that everything
[2:48:48] happens to me is good. The Bible said it
[2:48:50] happens
[2:48:52] for my good.
[2:48:55] For my good,
[2:48:58] for my good. Maybe the Lord just wants
[2:49:01] me to say to you that even the darkest
[2:49:04] place, even the scariest place, even the
[2:49:09] most rotten place in your life, it was
[2:49:13] the goodness of God, the mercies of God,
[2:49:16] the grace of God
[2:49:17] that somehow preserved you and brought
[2:49:19] you through it.
[2:49:22] Because of that and because of the
[2:49:23] goodness of God, we raised four children
[2:49:27] that never had to know what that feels
[2:49:30] like
[2:49:31] to flee in the night.
[2:49:34] So that's the goodness of God.
[2:49:37] If you can get whole and healed and well
[2:49:40] and raise your children
[2:49:42] to go forward and be better Christian,
[2:49:45] better parents, then everything that
[2:49:47] happened to you was for a reason. And it
[2:49:50] was the goodness of God that brought you
[2:49:52] through it.
[2:49:53] Do you understand?
[2:49:54] He knows. Listen, somebody said, "Well,
[2:49:57] what about that thing?" Well, listen. We
[2:49:58] we were talking last week about uh uh
[2:50:01] Abraham paying his tithes to Melzdc.
[2:50:05] And the scripture says that the benefit
[2:50:07] of that was also uh allocated or
[2:50:10] allotted to Levi who was still in the
[2:50:13] loins of his grandfather.
[2:50:15] Did you know doing the right thing in
[2:50:17] your generation can affect generations
[2:50:19] to come?
[2:50:21] Did you know doing the wrong thing in
[2:50:23] your generation and not repenting of it
[2:50:25] and making it right can cause that thing
[2:50:27] to pass down generationally?
[2:50:32] It matters how we live in front of our
[2:50:34] children.
[2:50:35] Matters. It matters. Father, we are I
[2:50:39] guess everyone maybe maybe someone looks
[2:50:41] in here on the stream and and they
[2:50:43] think, "My, look at those goody goodies.
[2:50:46] They've never known any heartache.
[2:50:48] They've never known any trials." Lord,
[2:50:50] if they only knew that the lives in this
[2:50:53] room are no different than the lives of
[2:50:55] any any place where folks, broken people
[2:50:59] who have been saved, delivered, and
[2:51:01] restored in Christ, gather together.
[2:51:04] As I said a moment ago, there there
[2:51:07] abused and the abuser
[2:51:11] worships in your presence. Those who
[2:51:14] were once the abused, those who were
[2:51:16] once the abuser can come to you and be
[2:51:18] healed and be whole and go forward.
[2:51:23] Those who are broken and those who did
[2:51:25] the breaking both deserve the same
[2:51:27] redemption.
[2:51:29] They both deserve the same grace because
[2:51:32] grace is something not deserved. It's a
[2:51:35] gift from God. We don't earn it by our
[2:51:38] good behavior or lose it by our bad
[2:51:40] behavior. Lord, I don't know who you're
[2:51:43] talking to today the most.
[2:51:46] Is it someone here? Is it someone tuning
[2:51:49] in? I don't know. But what I do know is
[2:51:51] Lord, if they would somehow be able to
[2:51:54] surrender their life to you,
[2:51:56] you'll show them. You'll show them your
[2:51:59] goodness in the darkest moment,
[2:52:03] in the most hideous moment of their
[2:52:04] life,
[2:52:06] in the things that they did not deserve
[2:52:09] and yet they experienced
[2:52:12] your redeeming grace.
[2:52:20] Lord, would you help every person under
[2:52:22] the sound of my voice to see your
[2:52:25] goodness?
[2:52:28] in the land of the living.
[2:52:33] I don't want to make you uncomfortable,
[2:52:35] but if you're standing near someone and
[2:52:37] it would be appropriate to do so, would
[2:52:39] you just lay your hand over on a
[2:52:41] shoulder, an elbow, an arm, just
[2:52:48] the ground is level at the foot of the
[2:52:50] cross.
[2:52:51] There's nobody in this room that was
[2:52:53] born into perfection.
[2:52:55] We were all born in sin, shapen in
[2:52:57] iniquity.
[2:52:58] We all came here with a fallen Adamic
[2:53:01] nature and we needed to be redeemed.
[2:53:04] We've all been on the mountain and in
[2:53:06] the valley.
[2:53:08] We've all been through something.
[2:53:11] Now we stand together united in the
[2:53:13] presence of the Lord and we realize that
[2:53:16] it's grace that has brought us this far
[2:53:18] and it'll be grace that takes us the
[2:53:20] rest of the way. So we take this
[2:53:22] opportunity, Lord, to pray for one
[2:53:24] another. Would you do that right now?
[2:53:26] Lord, I pray for this one nearest to me.
[2:53:30] I don't know what the struggle could be
[2:53:32] or might be. I don't know what the enemy
[2:53:35] is trying to magnify in their mind to
[2:53:38] cause them to miss what you would do for
[2:53:39] them, Jesus. I I don't know what uh has
[2:53:43] wounded them the most or brought them
[2:53:45] the most pain.
[2:53:47] Maybe they have known healing. Maybe
[2:53:48] they're still healing.
[2:53:51] But I stand with them.
[2:53:54] My hand on their shoulder, my hand on
[2:53:56] their elbow. It's it's just a symbol
[2:53:59] of how the fallen race of Adam
[2:54:04] has come into the presence of the
[2:54:05] redeemer and the creator. And we have
[2:54:07] found mercy and grace in his sight. And
[2:54:11] he has cleansed us and made an
[2:54:13] everlasting covenant with us. We are not
[2:54:16] who we were.
[2:54:19] We are not sinners. saved by grace. We
[2:54:21] were sinners
[2:54:23] and now we have known the redeeming
[2:54:24] power of Jesus Christ who forgives us of
[2:54:28] all of our sins, the ones behind us. And
[2:54:31] even if we were, it will not be our
[2:54:34] intention or aim or our goal. But if we
[2:54:36] were to fall today, if we were to make a
[2:54:38] terrible choice today, we know your
[2:54:42] grace is sufficient to woo us back to
[2:54:46] call us back, to keep us from going too
[2:54:49] far. We surrender to your love and mercy
[2:54:52] today.
[2:54:54] What Satan planned, what he desired to
[2:54:56] do, he has been defeated
[2:55:00] because you have interrupted his plot,
[2:55:02] his plan, and you have redeemed us. Oh,
[2:55:05] thank you, Jesus. Strengthen this
[2:55:07] brother. Strengthen this sister. Lord, I
[2:55:10] pray for streamers right now stirred in
[2:55:14] their inner being and need a touch from
[2:55:16] you. Come Lord,
[2:55:18] heal, restore, pour oil.
[2:55:24] May we not only be healed physically,
[2:55:26] but may we be healed emotionally.
[2:55:29] May every cell and fiber of our body
[2:55:32] respond
[2:55:33] to the healing virtue
[2:55:36] of Jehovah Rafa, Yahweh Rafa, the Lord
[2:55:41] our God, our healer. Would you heal?
[2:55:45] Would you move? and soothe
[2:55:48] and help. Would you strengthen?
[2:55:54] Would you give us overcoming power?
[2:55:58] Would you remind us of your love right
[2:56:00] now?
[2:56:04] Would you help us to get our eyes above
[2:56:06] our stuff and get our eyes on you today
[2:56:11] and glorify your name?
[2:56:15] We break off the works of the enemy, the
[2:56:18] works of darkness. We break off the
[2:56:21] oppressing spirits that the enemy would
[2:56:24] try to torment minds with today.
[2:56:28] And we ask for new thoughts. We ask for
[2:56:31] the mind of Christ to overwrite and
[2:56:35] override
[2:56:37] every work of the enemy.
[2:56:40] We surrender to this process. We trust
[2:56:43] you and we know that you're working all
[2:56:45] things for our good. In the name of
[2:56:49] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[2:56:54] Falling in love
[2:56:57] with Jesus.
[2:57:02] Falling in love
[2:57:05] with Jesus.

[2:57:20] done.
[2:57:22] Oh,

[2:57:30] [Music]
[2:57:33] I'm falling in love
[2:57:35] with Jesus.
[2:57:39] Oh, I'm falling in love with Jesus.
[2:57:46] And it's the best thing I've ever
[2:57:50] done.
[2:57:52] Oh,

[2:58:03] Falling in love with Jesus.
[2:58:09] Oh, I'm falling in love with my Jesus.

[2:58:25] Oh. Cuz in his arms I feel
[2:58:30] protected.
[2:58:33] And in his arms I'm never disconnected.
[2:58:38] [Music]
[2:58:40] Oh, and in his arms that's where I feel
[2:58:45] protected.
[2:58:47] And there's no place I'd ra
[2:58:51] be.
[2:58:53] Why don't you just grab somebody
[2:58:58] shake somebody's hand?
[2:58:59] I feel protected.
[2:59:02] I'm praying for you, brother.
[2:59:03] And in his arms,
[2:59:06] never
[2:59:08] connected.
[2:59:11] And in his arm, that's where I feel
[2:59:15] protected.
[2:59:17] There's no place I'd ra
[2:59:21] be in his arms.
[2:59:24] [Music]
[2:59:26] In his arms, I feel
[2:59:30] protected. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:59:33] In his arms, I'm never disconnected.
[2:59:39] [Music]
[2:59:41] In his arms, that's where I feel
[2:59:45] protected.
[2:59:46] And there's no place I'd ra
[2:59:50] be.
[2:59:55] We're going to dismiss you. If you want
[2:59:58] to stay and worship a moment or pray a
[3:00:00] moment, you certainly are free to do
[3:00:02] that. The rest of us will slip home and
[3:00:06] bring our lunch down to the fellowship
[3:00:08] hall so that we can get it here fast as
[3:00:11] we possibly can. If you didn't bring
[3:00:12] anything, you're still more than welcome
[3:00:15] to have a a fellowship lunch with us and
[3:00:18] then in the afternoon when we're it's
[3:00:20] sort of all a part of the celebration.
[3:00:23] But we're going to give God thanks for
[3:00:24] this beautiful little girl that Josiah
[3:00:28] has and cherishes.
[3:00:31] It's a gift. She is a gift from God.
[3:00:34] Charlotte Ruth is a gift from God. And
[3:00:38] we have all benefited and been blessed
[3:00:40] by her little life already. One year,
[3:00:43] just one year.
[3:00:46] People have prayed for her around the
[3:00:47] world.
[3:00:49] So, we'll have a nice time. Thank you
[3:00:51] for being here today. There's a deep,
[3:00:54] deep, deep something. Take it with you.
[3:00:57] Would you take it with you? Let God do
[3:01:00] something for you. Let him raise you out
[3:01:02] of the grief. Let him raise you out of
[3:01:04] the place where you are. Father, go with
[3:01:07] us now. Give us safety on these
[3:01:10] dangerous highways of life and bring us
[3:01:12] back just a few moments for food and
[3:01:16] fellowship together. Let your presence
[3:01:18] be just as real with us as we sit at the
[3:01:21] table as we have felt you and known you
[3:01:24] and experienced you today. And we'll
[3:01:26] give you all the praise and glory and
[3:01:28] honor. It's in the name of the Lord
[3:01:30] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. You're
[3:01:33] dismissed to go in the name of the Lord,
[3:01:35] but reverence the sanctuary. Would you
[3:01:38] please, if you were going to fellowship
[3:01:40] and do a lot of chatting, do that out in
[3:01:42] the vestibule.
[3:01:43] Give us a moment or two to get our food
[3:01:45] back together and we will soon have
[3:01:47] lunch. Go in this piece. If you want to
[3:01:49] stay in worship, please do. Pray, please
[3:01:52] do.
[3:01:55] You look so pretty.
[3:01:58] That looks so pretty. Falling in love
[3:02:01] with Jesus.
[3:02:04] [Music]
[3:02:07] Falling in love with Jesus.
