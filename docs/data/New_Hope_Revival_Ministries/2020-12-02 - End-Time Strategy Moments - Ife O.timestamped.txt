[0:00] there's a hand that knows exactly where
[0:03] each piece is to be placed because there
[0:07] is a strategy
[0:15] and as i began to pray i saw a
[0:18] chessboard
[0:19] i don't know very much about chess but
[0:22] but i know a little bit from
[0:23] hearing other people talk and i saw a
[0:26] chessboard
[0:27] and i saw a shadow bump the board
[0:31] i didn't see a person or or an image but
[0:34] i saw what looked like a shadow of
[0:36] something
[0:37] bumped the chessboard and many pieces
[0:40] began to fall over toppled over in slow
[0:43] motion
[0:44] you'd think they'd just fall over but in
[0:46] slow motion
[0:47] i watched the pieces of the chessboard
[0:50] fall over
[0:51] and i saw a hand and i knew it was the
[0:54] hand of the lord
[0:55] and i saw him begin to go and i was
[0:58] thinking in my mind
[0:59] i would never remember because i'm not a
[1:01] chess player i would never remember
[1:03] where they were
[1:05] you know here they go and they fall over
[1:07] and they're scattered and kind of
[1:09] rolling around
[1:10] i would never remember but i saw a hand
[1:12] that knew
[1:14] see this was a reminder to me
[1:17] that there's a hand that knows exactly
[1:20] where
[1:20] each piece is to be placed because there
[1:24] is a
[1:24] strategy because it's important to have
[1:28] a plan
[1:28] as you go along and there was a strategy
[1:32] and in normal circumstances the enemy
[1:35] would be able to come in and just
[1:36] disturb the strategy
[1:38] when he disturbed the pieces on the
[1:40] board but there's
[1:41] somebody that remembers the strategy i
[1:44] saw the hand
[1:45] restoring the game and i knew that
[1:48] god's strategy was being restored
[1:52] and that though the enemy had caused a
[1:54] confusion
[1:55] and a scatter that he is still
[1:59] sovereign and he has a purpose and a
[2:02] plan
[2:03] it's not a game to god it's not a game
[2:07] it's something that he had on his mind
[2:09] for you
[2:10] and for me before the foundation of the
[2:13] world
[2:14] so i just began to give god praise that
[2:16] he knew exactly how
[2:18] to move every piece right back to where
[2:21] it was originally supposed to be
[2:23] and that the enemy's confusion and his
[2:26] interruption
[2:27] of the game was short-lived it was
[2:31] serious but it was short-lived
[2:34] and god has the grace and the ability to
[2:37] pick up where things left off
[2:39] and carry them all the way to eternity
[2:42] let me tell you the god who started a
[2:44] good work of redemption in you
[2:46] the god who sanctified you from the mess
[2:48] you were in
[2:49] and set you up right into his
[2:51] righteousness
[2:53] he knows how to take you all the way
[2:55] he's not just the author
[2:57] of our faith this morning but he's the
[2:59] author
[3:00] and the finisher of our faith hallelujah
[3:04] he'll see us all the way through because
[3:08] that's who he is
