TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know what the mind of Christ looks like it looks like the word it is a beautiful victory to know that we can take in any situation that we choose to the mind of Christ we can in fact it's ours and we can process life through the mind of Christ if we keep making the right choices but it is a choice it's not a daily choice it's actually a minute-by-minute choice to process life through the mind of Christ which is the word you don't know what the mind of Christ looks like it looks like the word come on now and when we say Word we don't just mean Genesis to Revelation either but if the bride could understand that she has received a portion of that word she has received a portion of that logos because that's who she is you were once in him he didn't just think about you he thought you you are a font of God you are now a word of God because you've been expressed into the earth that is who you are not a loser a word sent from God not a defeated whip a word citric god not a nervous wreck a word sent from God come on not a not a jealous Mouse no a word citric god I find out that in the church people are living perpetually in the need for deliverance because they don't understand what deliverance really is deliverance is not the absence of opposition it's not the absence of warfare that's not what deliverance is deliverance is the ability to know that everything you need to win the victory over whatever it is that you're walking through is in you
