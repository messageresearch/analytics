[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New
[1:02] Hope revival ministries and we're coming
[1:05] to you today on behalf of the gospel
[1:07] channel our wonderful friend and brother
[1:10] Eric Erickson all of the staff of the
[1:13] gospel channel we greet you we salute
[1:16] you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19] Christ our Savior our soon coming King
[1:23] we are so excited about the things that
[1:26] the Lord is doing my family and I just
[1:29] returned from a Bible conference in
[1:31] North Carolina and we were so blessed to
[1:34] be with the Saints of God and singing
[1:37] the songs of Zion and hearing the Word
[1:40] of God preached the theme of that
[1:42] meeting was our future home that's the
[1:45] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:48] and the earthly bride of which I believe
[1:52] I'm apart and I'm trusting that you are
[1:55] also pressing into Christ in this hour
[1:58] so we came home a little bit tired but
[2:01] revived in our spirit it's good to be
[2:04] refreshed in your spirit man and we're
[2:08] really blessed to have the gospel
[2:10] channel as one of the ways that we can
[2:13] be blessed and we can be refreshed you
[2:16] know it feels a little bit like a
[2:18] paradox to me sometime because
[2:21] television has never been a part of my
[2:23] life I lived without a television and it
[2:28] has never been something that was of
[2:30] great interest to me through the years
[2:32] and so so many of my friends laugh and
[2:36] they think it is quite a paradox that
[2:38] God would open the door that he has
[2:40] opened for us to be able to speak to you
[2:43] by the means of television it's the
[2:46] grace of God that's what it is it's the
[2:48] grace of God and we have to have enough
[2:51] a discernment in the realm of the Spirit
[2:54] to know when God's opening a door and so
[2:57] I'll say to you again there's a lot of
[2:59] things on the television that are
[3:01] absolutely rotten no good but I am so
[3:06] grateful and so thankful that God has
[3:08] given us a pulpit
[3:09] to the nation's brother Eric Erickson we
[3:12] salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:15] Christ because over twenty years ago you
[3:18] had a burden you had a vision to start
[3:21] with a radio receiver in your beautiful
[3:25] country of Iceland and that expanded to
[3:29] now a television network that's reaching
[3:32] many many nations with the gospel and
[3:35] without you without you viewing the
[3:38] program and without your partnering with
[3:41] the gospel channel that would not be
[3:43] possible we are so blessed today to have
[3:47] a wonderful brother with us it always
[3:51] makes me feel good it gets lonely on
[3:53] here sometime when I'm by myself and so
[3:56] I'm always happy to have a friend with
[3:58] me and today we have brother Gerald
[4:01] Hicks who is a now at this particular
[4:06] moment an evangelist but he has pastored
[4:09] and has had a ministry for many many
[4:11] years we're going to get to know him
[4:14] today so whatever you do leave it right
[4:17] where it is
[4:18] don't this is not a time to go channel
[4:21] surfing with the remote because brother
[4:24] Hicks has a testimony that I believe it
[4:27] is the will of God for you to hear and I
[4:30] believe it's going to encourage you
[4:31] because he has had a life that has not
[4:34] been what we might say ideal it
[4:37] certainly has it been usual but it has
[4:41] been exactly what God has ordained it to
[4:44] be to get him to where he is today so
[4:47] that he can be mightily used of the Lord
[4:50] he was preaching for us in our church
[4:53] last night and we were blessed and it
[4:55] was one of those sermons where you want
[4:57] to go back and hear it again and again
[4:59] because you know there was rich rich
[5:03] food what we call eagle food that kind
[5:07] of food that strengthens us to press
[5:10] into Christ and we're delighted to have
[5:13] him with us today and before we get to
[5:16] know brother Hicks I want to share just
[5:18] a portion of Scripture that I woke up
[5:20] with this more
[5:21] I believe the Lord was speaking to me
[5:23] about you I really do I believe that
[5:27] we're going to be taping this program
[5:28] and we're going to do another program a
[5:31] little bit later with brother Hicks and
[5:33] I believe that God already knows in his
[5:37] foreknowledge who is going to see this
[5:40] program and the program we will record
[5:43] later and it will be rerun and God knows
[5:46] the ones who will watch it in the rerun
[5:48] and God knows who might see it on
[5:51] YouTube or who might be directed to it
[5:54] through Facebook or some other form of
[5:56] social media or preacher you don't
[5:59] really believe God knows and cares about
[6:01] all those things I absolutely do I
[6:04] believe that God knows right now this
[6:06] moment every person that will ever see
[6:09] or hear these words and I believe that
[6:12] he has a purpose in you being a part of
[6:15] this program today and I woke up this
[6:17] morning and I heard these words and it's
[6:20] found in the book of Saint John chapter
[6:23] 15 beginning in verse 16 ye have not
[6:27] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[6:34] ordained you that you should go forth
[6:38] and bring fruit or that you should go
[6:42] forth and bring forth fruit and that
[6:47] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[6:51] you shall ask of the Father in my name
[6:54] he may give it you this is our Lord
[6:59] speaking to those who were gathered that
[7:01] day to hear the words of life that he
[7:04] would share and I can't get away from
[7:06] that phrase you have not chosen me but I
[7:11] have chosen you and ordained you that
[7:15] you should go and bring forth fruit I
[7:19] believe that's a verse that applies to
[7:21] your life absolutely I believe that may
[7:23] be one of the reasons why the Lord woke
[7:25] it woke me up this morning with it
[7:27] was to confirm our being together today
[7:30] Britax we're very
[7:32] very happy to have you here I'm very
[7:34] honored today to be here by the Shelley
[7:36] I believe you're one of those that the
[7:38] Lord has chosen you you may we may think
[7:42] sometimes we choose him but we know
[7:43] before we get that opportunity he's
[7:45] already chosen us absolutely would you
[7:48] tell us a little bit today about your
[7:50] background your life your family your
[7:53] growing up years and how you came to
[7:55] know the Lord I would certainly be
[7:57] delighted to do that just as a little
[8:02] background history I made my debut on
[8:05] the 23rd day of April 1970 that's a good
[8:09] mud and I happened to come into the
[8:12] world probably about eight weeks earlier
[8:16] than I was supposed to and I would learn
[8:20] later in life that the premature birth
[8:23] was the result of the traumatic
[8:27] experience that my mother was going
[8:29] through at the time I would discover
[8:31] that just prior to my birth my father
[8:35] would be condemned to prison for a
[8:39] hideous crime he had a sentence of 99
[8:43] years with only one option for parole
[8:46] and this crime was so devastating and
[8:51] this event was so devastating to our
[8:53] family that my mother immediately turned
[8:56] to the dark side of life she became
[9:00] quickly addicted to drugs and alcohol
[9:03] and a sin a life of promiscuity because
[9:07] she was trying to hide and cover her
[9:09] pain right and oddly because of that she
[9:14] ended up having me prematurely and when
[9:18] I was when I was born she was really a
[9:21] psychological and an emotional wreck you
[9:24] might say sure and it would only be
[9:27] about five or six months later that my
[9:31] mother would decide that she could no
[9:32] longer really care for me properly and
[9:35] so she would take me and two other
[9:38] siblings one that was six years older
[9:41] than me one that was eight years older
[9:43] than me
[9:44] and put us in a local daycare center and
[9:47] at first it was protocol she would come
[9:51] pick us up every evening take us back
[9:53] the next day but after a few weeks my
[9:56] two older siblings ended up going to
[9:59] live with family members and she would
[10:02] leave me there not for days at a time
[10:04] but weeks at a time then months at a
[10:07] time and finally by the time I was three
[10:11] years old I had spent more time in that
[10:13] daycare center than I had spent with my
[10:15] own mother and I did not have any idea
[10:20] being so young exactly what all was
[10:23] going on but by the time I was three
[10:25] years old my mother was so addicted to
[10:28] drugs and alcohol that one night she was
[10:30] in a house that caught on fire had no
[10:33] idea that the house was on fire because
[10:36] she was so intoxicated and inebriated
[10:39] and by the time they rescued her from
[10:42] the flames of that burning home she had
[10:45] been burned on 75% of her body and she
[10:51] lay in a hospital for about three and a
[10:53] half months desperately trying to
[10:56] recover but on the fifth day of July
[10:59] 1973 she finally closed her eyes and her
[11:04] heartbeat the last time and when she
[11:07] left this world she left behind five
[11:09] children who would never live together
[11:12] as a family under a roof again she left
[11:16] behind a husband who was serving a life
[11:18] sentence behind bars for a hideous crime
[11:22] and no doubt this psychologically
[11:27] affected all of our family the older
[11:31] children much more than myself however
[11:33] it would it would be discovered that
[11:36] early on in my life learning these facts
[11:39] that uh I would struggle for many many
[11:43] years with the question of why of course
[11:46] just that one word while was a stumbling
[11:50] block for me it was a hurdle that I did
[11:53] not think I would ever be able to truly
[11:56] overcome
[11:57] I struggled with that one word why it
[12:01] was just it was there every waking
[12:05] moment of the day I was I was haunted
[12:08] you might say by that word wife every
[12:12] day of my life I wanted to know just
[12:15] exactly why has this happened to measure
[12:19] why has all of these in justices come my
[12:23] way what did I do to deserve this in my
[12:27] life and little did I know at that time
[12:31] that God had a plan that God had a plan
[12:35] for me I would discover later on in life
[12:38] that the Bible said the steps of a good
[12:41] man are ordered by the Lord right and I
[12:45] would certainly realize years later that
[12:48] God Almighty was certainly directing my
[12:53] footsteps I was a I was a very troubled
[12:57] young man and by the time I was 12 years
[13:00] old I was truly sin bent and hail bound
[13:05] I was bitter I was full of unforgiveness
[13:08] I was filled with anger I was a I was
[13:12] stumbling from one day to the next over
[13:16] that one word why when eventually one
[13:19] day our family was invited to a
[13:23] Pentecostal church when you say our
[13:25] family who are you referring to now I'm
[13:28] referring to the to the lady that would
[13:31] raise me I was abandoned at the daycare
[13:34] center and she took me into her home and
[13:37] decided although she was 54 years old
[13:41] and had already raised all of her own
[13:44] children and had outlived two companions
[13:47] at 54 decided to take me in and make me
[13:52] her own do you do we know how she knew
[13:55] about you particularly in the daycare
[13:58] center what was she just aware of the
[14:02] circumstances in the situation or did
[14:05] she go looking for a child to adopt do
[14:07] we know how she
[14:08] well actually what happened her daughter
[14:10] was the owner of the daycare center all
[14:13] right and she helped manage the daycare
[14:15] center and so I was just left there for
[14:19] days at a time then weeks at a time then
[14:22] months at a time and she took me in and
[14:26] and wanted wanted to race me 54 years
[14:29] old and getting started over again with
[14:32] a small baby yes and she would later she
[14:35] would later tell her family that she
[14:38] felt like it was her destiny that she
[14:40] felt like it was her call in life was
[14:42] she a Christian woman she she was not a
[14:44] Christian but she was a moral one I
[14:47] think so she was a woman of great moral
[14:50] values and she would later say that she
[14:53] felt that it was her her destiny her
[14:56] call in life to provide me with a home
[14:59] and so it is at that time her her adult
[15:03] grown children would say mother why in
[15:05] the world would you want to assume the
[15:08] responsibility right for such a young
[15:11] child when it is a very good possibility
[15:15] that you might not even live long enough
[15:18] to raise this child exactly however she
[15:22] felt like that it was her destiny it was
[15:25] her call she said there's just something
[15:28] inside of me that keeps telling me that
[15:31] I must provide this child with a home
[15:35] that I must provide this child with
[15:38] guidance and direction and so it is that
[15:41] she took me in and she made me her own
[15:44] and so to go back to where you were so
[15:47] now you're a preteen going into your
[15:49] teenage years and you're very troubled I
[15:51] was a very troubled young man because
[15:54] she never kept from me the fact that my
[15:59] biological family had basically
[16:02] abandoned me you know they were they
[16:05] were good people but none of them wanted
[16:07] the responsibility of an infant and so
[16:11] she never kept that from me
[16:13] and because of that I always struggled
[16:17] with you know the heartache and
[16:20] pain and the disappointment of just
[16:23] literally being abandoned you know I
[16:25] struggled with those feelings of you
[16:28] know my family not truly wanting me and
[16:32] so it is that I was certainly struggling
[16:36] in many ways however we were invited to
[16:39] a Pentecostal church had no idea what a
[16:42] Pentecostal church was and I'll never
[16:45] forget the first service was was not all
[16:49] of that unique to me it wasn't
[16:51] earth-shaking
[16:52] by any means it just seemed to be an
[16:56] average ordinary church service like
[16:58] several other church services I had
[17:00] attended however the thing that did
[17:03] stand out to us the people were so kind
[17:06] that were so cordial they were so loving
[17:09] that uh we decided we wanted to go back
[17:12] and investigate even more and so it is
[17:16] on Sunday evening we did decide to go
[17:19] back to that same church and on Sunday
[17:22] evening the service was so much
[17:25] different than on Sunday morning the
[17:27] song service began and basically really
[17:31] the only way I could describe it the
[17:33] longer the song service continued the
[17:36] faster and the louder it seemed together
[17:39] until finally all of a sudden it was
[17:43] what I would call Pentecostal
[17:44] pandemonium brown people started jumping
[17:47] people started running people started
[17:50] crying people started laughing
[17:52] some people were shouting and I sat
[17:55] there on the edge of my Pew and I had
[17:59] never witnessed anything like this with
[18:01] my eyes in all of my life and even
[18:05] though it seemed to be chaos in the
[18:08] middle of what I thought was chaos there
[18:11] was a peace and a serenity that I had
[18:14] never experienced in all of my entire
[18:17] life threes and I'll never forget when
[18:20] that service was over walked outside
[18:23] climbed in the backseat of the old car
[18:25] we were driving and I'll never forget
[18:27] shutting the door to that car and saying
[18:30] in my
[18:31] and I have no idea what these people are
[18:34] I have no idea what they have but I do
[18:37] know one thing for sure if I'm ever
[18:40] going to be anything I'm going to be
[18:43] exactly what these people are there was
[18:48] something that happened in my heart that
[18:51] night for the first time in my life only
[18:54] 12 years old I finally realized there is
[18:59] a God in heaven
[19:00] and he is real and I decided at that
[19:04] moment that somehow if he would give me
[19:07] the opportunity I would find him well
[19:10] what an incredible story what an
[19:13] incredible story your life this is
[19:17] something that we could read in a good
[19:18] book right but this is God this was
[19:21] God's hand on your life and he lined up
[19:24] a precious woman yes who wasn't even a
[19:28] Christian at the time to play a role
[19:31] really it led her to the Lord I mean
[19:35] really didn't it I mean I see you and
[19:37] her absolutely you told me once about
[19:39] coming down the steps I think this might
[19:41] have been a little prior to the
[19:42] Pentecostal yes tell would you tell that
[19:45] I think especially because here we are
[19:48] on Christian television so I I think it
[19:52] would be a blessing for people to hear
[19:53] what what you saw one day when you came
[19:56] down the steps and your adopted mother
[19:58] was there yes only only a short time
[20:01] before we were invited to this
[20:03] Pentecostal church again we were not
[20:06] religious people we were not Christian
[20:08] people fact is from from the time I was
[20:12] born until I was about 11 years old I
[20:15] don't even recall ever attending a
[20:18] church service other than a funeral or a
[20:21] wedding mama we were just not
[20:23] church-going people missing my my
[20:26] adopted mother was very moral she was a
[20:30] kind woman she was a good woman but we
[20:33] were not we were not Christian people we
[20:35] were not we were not a church-going
[20:37] people
[20:38] however I'll never forget one Sunday
[20:41] morning I walked downstairs
[20:44] from my bedroom and it was on a Sunday
[20:47] morning and I'll never forget coming
[20:48] down those stairs as I turned the corner
[20:52] of the hall starting into the living
[20:55] room I saw something I'd never seen
[20:57] before
[20:57] my mother was sitting on the edge of her
[21:00] chair and she had her hand stretched out
[21:03] toward the television in front of her
[21:05] and there were tears streaming down her
[21:08] face and she was repeating a prayer with
[21:12] a minister who was on the television set
[21:15] and this was very unique to me I had
[21:18] never seen anything like this this was
[21:21] very uncommon fact is this would be only
[21:25] one of the very rare occasions that I
[21:28] would ever see my mother shed a tear she
[21:32] was a very stern a very no-nonsense kind
[21:36] of woman she was not a very nurturing
[21:39] woman although she had a very deep love
[21:42] for me and I would later understand that
[21:45] she had a very deep love for God and for
[21:48] the gospel but she just did not show
[21:52] that with very much outward emotion
[21:54] right however the unique thing was the
[21:58] very next Sunday
[22:00] I was laying in bed when she walked in
[22:02] the room she woke me up and she said get
[22:05] up I said what for she said we're going
[22:09] somewhere I said where are we going she
[22:11] said we're going to church and that very
[22:14] next Sunday she started carrying me to
[22:17] church on a regular basis of course we
[22:21] were not Pentecostal we didn't know
[22:23] anything about being spirit-filled we
[22:26] just basically started attending the
[22:28] closest church to the place where we
[22:31] lived and it would be only a short time
[22:35] later that someone would invite us to a
[22:37] Pentecostal church and it was just God's
[22:40] divine providence my my my it's uh it's
[22:46] hard to fathom how that God had a plan
[22:49] in all of the chaos in your life and yet
[22:53] God had a plan for you
[22:55] and for your adopted mother yes
[22:58] absolutely
[22:59] and Christian television played a role
[23:02] which I'm very very blessed to hear that
[23:05] what what well it was a conversion she
[23:08] accepted the Lord international praying
[23:10] a prayer and it gave her a desire to go
[23:12] and and find out more so that led to to
[23:16] a church that was non Pentecostal that
[23:19] eventually led to an invitation to a
[23:20] Pentecostal church where there was I
[23:23] think you described it as Pentecostal
[23:25] pandemonium is that how you say
[23:27] absolutely absolutely I've been in
[23:30] meetings like that I certainly have
[23:32] all right you you're you've attended
[23:34] your first Pentecostal Sunday you've
[23:37] been there in the morning the evening
[23:38] and you're closing the door of the
[23:40] vehicle and you're deciding that you've
[23:43] seen something real and you want more of
[23:45] it so what happened next
[23:48] we began to attend this this Pentecostal
[23:51] church on a regular basis and of course
[23:54] back in those days in the early 1980s
[23:57] sunday-school was a very big part of
[24:00] local churches and so it just so
[24:04] happened that God allowed me to be in
[24:07] the class with a man who was a very
[24:11] passionate servant of the Lord Jesus
[24:14] Christ and he was not your typical
[24:17] Sunday school teacher because whereas
[24:20] other Sunday School teachers were using
[24:23] printed material from Christian presses
[24:26] somewhere he said what I'm gonna do is
[24:29] we're just gonna open up the Word of God
[24:30] and we're gonna go from one chapter to
[24:34] the next verse five verse in a
[24:36] chronological order and we're just going
[24:39] to decide what does the Bible say and
[24:43] little did I know from one service to
[24:46] the next on Sunday morning that brief
[24:49] time in Sunday school there was a seed
[24:52] that he planted in my heart and that
[24:56] seed started coming to life and one
[25:00] Sunday morning as I walked out of Sunday
[25:03] school I just happened to sit down on
[25:06] the front row of the church
[25:08] and when the preacher gave the
[25:10] invitation on this particular morning
[25:12] all of a sudden I felt the presence of
[25:16] someone standing behind me it was so
[25:20] real that I could feel a breath on the
[25:23] back of my neck and as I turned to see
[25:26] who was standing behind me I realized
[25:29] there was no one standing there and all
[25:33] of a sudden there was something inside
[25:35] of me that would not allow me to stay on
[25:38] that Pew any moment any longer I jumped
[25:42] up off of that Pew and I fell across the
[25:44] altar in front of me a 12 year old boy
[25:47] who was sin bent and hail bound a young
[25:51] boy who had never prayed a prayer in his
[25:54] life a young boy that did not even know
[25:57] how to pray but as the tears streamed
[26:00] down my face
[26:01] all I could say was Jesus if you can
[26:04] save me please save every part of me and
[26:09] all of a sudden the guilty burden of sin
[26:13] began to lift away oh yeah and I got up
[26:16] on my feet and I turned and walked out
[26:19] of that building the world no longer
[26:21] looked the same to me the grass seemed
[26:24] to be greener the sky appeared to be
[26:27] bluer the birds singing sounded so much
[26:30] sweeter
[26:31] and all there was a joy and a peace in
[26:34] my heart that I had never experienced in
[26:37] all of my life omma a real conversion
[26:41] absolutely in the old time way
[26:43] absolutely because I remember hearing
[26:45] the old-timers testify of that kind of a
[26:48] conversion experience where where
[26:50] everything old is new and the things
[26:53] that you love you now Hayden the things
[26:56] you hated you now loved so your life was
[26:58] completely turned around absolutely it
[27:01] was it was so dramatic that the next day
[27:05] when I went to school I had about five
[27:08] or six very close friends and we stayed
[27:11] together most of the day during school
[27:14] and by mid afternoon my friends that
[27:18] were closest to me realized that there
[27:21] was
[27:22] something definitely wrong and they
[27:24] wanted to know exactly what it was and
[27:27] they began to ask me what's wrong what's
[27:31] happened to you and finally I looked at
[27:34] my friends and I said you may or may not
[27:37] be able to understand this but I went to
[27:40] church yesterday and I fell in love with
[27:44] Jesus Christ and I'm gonna serve Him as
[27:47] long as I live I'll never forget my
[27:51] friends did not approve of my conversion
[27:54] some of them laughed some of them made
[27:57] fun one of them looked at me and said
[27:59] I've tried that before too however it'll
[28:03] get old and it'll wear off and you'll
[28:07] eventually outgrow it and no doubt if
[28:10] you live long enough you'll go on to
[28:12] pursue other things in life however it's
[28:15] been three and a half decades since that
[28:18] original experience and that now the
[28:21] experience is so much more real and so
[28:25] much more lasting the songwriter said it
[28:28] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[28:31] by
[28:32] oh what a love between the Lord and I
[28:35] absolutely absolutely what about the
[28:38] question why how did you sort that out
[28:42] how did your conversion experience play
[28:45] what role did it play in helping you to
[28:48] come to that place to be able to deal
[28:50] with the why and anger and the hurt and
[28:54] rejection that you had known it would
[28:56] only be a few months later that I would
[28:59] be baptized in water and after I was
[29:02] baptized in water our church had a
[29:06] revival and the evangelists who came to
[29:08] our church at that time seemed to feel
[29:13] the inspiration of God to instruct the
[29:17] congregation that if they were not
[29:20] filled with the spirit they certainly
[29:22] needed to be seeking and desiring to be
[29:25] filled with the spirit that God had much
[29:28] more for them than what they currently
[29:31] had
[29:32] and as I listened to this evangelist
[29:35] there was a hunger that was birthed on
[29:38] the inside of me that I wanted
[29:41] everything that God had for me and I
[29:44] could look around and I realized that
[29:46] although I had truly repented and that
[29:51] my life had been changed such a way that
[29:54] people were taking notice of the changes
[29:58] that had taken place however inside of
[30:01] me I realized that I still desperately
[30:05] needed so much more oh yes so much more
[30:09] and so it was that I began to seek the
[30:13] Lord for this spirit in filling and God
[30:18] would give me a very real experience
[30:21] just prior to this spiritual in feeling
[30:24] and once I receive the baptism of the
[30:27] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[30:30] tongues as the Spirit of God gave me the
[30:33] utterance there was a glorious change
[30:36] that came in my life and all of a sudden
[30:39] I would begin to realize that God had
[30:43] strategically allowed these things to
[30:47] come my way in life because he was
[30:50] protecting the call that he had placed
[30:53] upon me from birth I would realize once
[30:57] I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:59] that the call of God was upon my life
[31:02] even before I was in my mother's womb
[31:07] absolutely so the value of the call of
[31:11] God in your life as God looked at that
[31:14] and he looked at what you would be and
[31:16] how you would work for him he was
[31:18] orchestrating things for your good even
[31:21] though someone standing off watching and
[31:24] looking maybe they would have pity and
[31:26] sympathy and feel sorry for you not
[31:29] knowing and you didn't know until you
[31:32] really received the baptism of the Holy
[31:33] Ghost that God was leading you and he
[31:35] was setting it up absolutely and I like
[31:38] to explain it like this that God allows
[31:42] us to see snapshots of our life
[31:46] along the way however at the end of life
[31:50] God takes all of the snapshots and he
[31:53] puts them together and they make one
[31:55] beautiful portrait and many times when
[31:59] we only see the snapshots we don't
[32:02] understand however when he finally puts
[32:05] all of the snapshots together and we
[32:08] behold the beautiful portrait we truly
[32:11] understand what the writer meant when he
[32:14] said that all things work together for
[32:17] the good to them that love the Lord who
[32:21] were the called according to his purpose
[32:23] I would finally begin to realize that
[32:27] all of the darkness and all of the
[32:29] negative moments in my life they were
[32:32] not from my demise they were not from my
[32:35] hurt they were not from my detriment but
[32:38] all of those things were truly for my
[32:41] good because each of those things were
[32:44] bringing me one step closer to the
[32:47] Father right was this an instantaneous
[32:51] realization when receiving the baptism
[32:53] of the Holy Ghost or was it a process
[32:56] that you that you grew into being able
[32:59] to understand and accept the
[33:00] circumstances of your life it would it
[33:03] would be a process of grace
[33:05] absolutely it would it would come
[33:07] through a process of time one experience
[33:10] building upon another experience and I a
[33:14] course was was broken when I came to God
[33:17] I had no talent
[33:19] I had no skill I had no ability I had no
[33:23] resource I had no pedigree I had no one
[33:27] to promote me I just was broken in every
[33:30] way I was broken spiritually I was
[33:33] broken emotionally I was broken
[33:35] physically and I was a real liability as
[33:39] far as the world was concerned as far as
[33:43] the church was concerned I was a
[33:45] liability my adopted family would tell
[33:49] my mother over and over again why do you
[33:53] keep holding on to him why do you keep
[33:56] investing in him it's obvious he's
[33:58] destined
[33:59] be nothing it's obvious that he's not
[34:02] ever gonna be anything he's not ever
[34:04] going to amount to anything however
[34:06] there was something deep down inside of
[34:09] her that just would not allow her to let
[34:12] go somehow she knew that God had a plan
[34:16] and as God would begin to change me I
[34:20] would feel the call of God upon my life
[34:23] but I would wonder God why would you
[34:26] want to use someone like me there are so
[34:29] many people who have so much more skill
[34:32] they have so much more ability they have
[34:35] so much more talent they have so much
[34:38] more resource they have so much more
[34:40] knowledge why would you want to use
[34:43] someone like me and I would soon
[34:46] discover that what God looks for is not
[34:49] always ability but what God looks for is
[34:53] availability and what happened is at a
[34:56] very young age I would just simply make
[35:00] myself available to God I would hold the
[35:03] broken pieces of my life in my hand and
[35:07] unashamedly I would hand them to God and
[35:10] say this is all I've got
[35:12] it's broken and it doesn't look like
[35:14] much but I want to give it to you know
[35:17] and what I would discover is that
[35:19] oftentimes some of God's greatest and
[35:23] most valuable treasures are found in the
[35:27] scratch and dent department of life oh
[35:29] my oftentimes some of his rarest jewels
[35:33] come from the potter's field where other
[35:36] peoples have walked by and shook their
[35:38] head and said there's nothing valuable
[35:41] there mmmmmm
[35:43] it reminds me of the scripture that says
[35:46] they that are whole need not a physician
[35:48] it's the broken
[35:50] it's the needy that Jesus has come to
[35:53] make such a difference in their life
[35:54] rather Hix maybe someone's watching not
[35:57] maybe I I feel most definitely that
[36:00] there will be people watching you right
[36:01] now who have similar circumstances at
[36:06] least in the sense that things haven't
[36:08] been ideal for them and maybe
[36:10] they're right where you were at it at
[36:13] your teenage years you know why would
[36:15] God want me why would he want to use me
[36:17] I I would like for you to take a few
[36:19] moments and look into that camera and
[36:22] speak to that person what I would what I
[36:25] would like to say today is that perhaps
[36:28] you're listening to me right now and you
[36:31] feel broken perhaps you feel bruised
[36:34] maybe it is that you are halting in your
[36:37] step perhaps it is that you are
[36:40] struggling to put one foot in front of
[36:42] the other today and you wonder is there
[36:45] any possible way that I can overcome the
[36:49] circumstances that are surrounding my
[36:52] life perhaps it is that when you look at
[36:55] your own circumstances today it's a
[36:58] broken heart maybe it's a broken dream
[37:01] maybe it's a broken career maybe it's a
[37:04] broken relationship maybe it's a broken
[37:07] family that you're struggling with
[37:09] perhaps you're struggling with a broken
[37:11] body
[37:12] maybe it's affliction disease perhaps
[37:16] it's sickness or illness that you're
[37:18] struggling with today but I would
[37:20] challenge you today although it may look
[37:23] dark
[37:24] although the clouds may be looming in
[37:26] the distance and you may be wondering if
[37:29] the Sun will ever shine again I want to
[37:32] challenge you to just pick up the pieces
[37:35] rather than focus all of your attention
[37:39] on what you no longer have and that's
[37:42] where many of us are yeah many times we
[37:45] get trapped focusing our attention on
[37:48] what we no longer have but what I would
[37:52] ask you to do today is to stop looking
[37:55] at what you no longer have and start
[37:58] looking at what you have left just pick
[38:02] up what you have left and walk into the
[38:05] presence of God and just simply in a
[38:09] very humble way in a way with Noah with
[38:13] no fear and no trepidation just simply
[38:17] say God Here I am my life is broken my
[38:21] dreams are broken
[38:23] my home is broken my body is broken but
[38:26] I know today that somehow you specialize
[38:30] in broken things and I want to give you
[38:34] my broken heart I want to give you my
[38:36] broken dreams I want to give you my
[38:39] broken life and I'm asking you to make
[38:42] something beautiful out of it I can
[38:45] promise you today if you'll pick up the
[38:48] pieces and put them in the hand of God
[38:51] that God can take your misery and he can
[38:54] turn it into something that is masterful
[38:57] God can take all of your hurt and all of
[39:01] your pain and all of your brokenness and
[39:04] he can turn it into something beautiful
[39:06] amen because he's that kind of a God
[39:09] absolute that's who he is
[39:10] that's absolutely who he is and so how
[39:15] many years have you spent now in
[39:16] ministry I have been in ministry now for
[39:20] 33 years
[39:22] I would not truly advise a young
[39:25] aspiring preacher to do exactly what I
[39:28] did however when I realized that the
[39:31] call of God was upon my life one day in
[39:35] prayer I just decided that I would be
[39:37] bold that I would be audacious oh yes
[39:40] and so I got the local telephone book
[39:44] out I turned in the Yellow Pages to the
[39:47] church section and I called what I
[39:50] thought was every Pentecostal church in
[39:53] the Yellow Pages and every church that
[39:57] answered the phone I introduced myself
[40:00] and I asked for an opportunity to come
[40:03] to their church and to share my
[40:05] testimony and that day every single
[40:10] individual that answered the phone gave
[40:13] me the same answer no no every one of
[40:17] those individuals declined to give me
[40:20] the opportunity to come and share my
[40:23] testimony it was very disappointing sure
[40:26] it was a very devastating fact is I'll
[40:30] never forget the feelings of rejection
[40:33] that lost over
[40:35] and all of the pain of my past tried to
[40:39] come back worse and I remember laying
[40:41] down in the floor and I began to weep
[40:44] and I wept uncontrollably for a long
[40:47] period of time and when I finally got up
[40:51] out of the floor and began to wipe the
[40:53] tears away there was a part of me that
[40:55] wanted to quit there was a part of me
[40:58] that wanted to turn back they wanted to
[41:00] walk away however there was something
[41:02] else inside of me that just compelled me
[41:05] to open up the Bible and when I walked
[41:08] over picked up my Bible and I opened it
[41:11] up I looked down and my eyes the first
[41:15] thing I saw was the Spirit of the Lord
[41:17] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[41:21] to preach the gospel those words
[41:24] literally leaped off of the page and
[41:27] they became alive in my heart it was
[41:30] like those words kindled a fire inside
[41:34] of me that all of these years later is
[41:36] still burning so I decided that rather
[41:40] than wait on someone to give me the
[41:42] opportunity I would just go to the
[41:45] streets I would go to the parks I would
[41:48] go to the highways and the hedges as
[41:50] Jesus would say and I would begin to
[41:53] compel them to come in that his house
[41:56] might be fire my so how long was it
[41:58] until you had an open door in a church
[42:01] it would probably be about two years
[42:05] oh my about two years of preaching on
[42:09] the streets and witnessing and
[42:11] testifying in restaurants and Parks and
[42:15] own street corners at school in
[42:18] hospitals and nursing homes after church
[42:21] in parking lots
[42:22] sharing the Gospel message little did I
[42:26] know that there were some kids at school
[42:28] that had been watching me and they went
[42:31] to bat for me and they finally convinced
[42:34] their youth pastor to invite me to their
[42:37] youth service and I shared my testimony
[42:41] and just as I was finishing my testimony
[42:45] the pastor of the church walked in
[42:47] called about
[42:49] the last 10 minutes and the pastor came
[42:52] up and introduced themselves to me after
[42:55] service and gave me the opportunity to
[42:59] come back a few weeks later for a couple
[43:02] of nights and God would gloriously fill
[43:05] that place not only with his presence
[43:08] but with people and from that service
[43:11] from those three services doors would
[43:14] begin to open one door after another
[43:17] over and over and over again and I would
[43:21] quickly be thrust into full-time
[43:25] ministry traveling up and down the East
[43:28] Coast sharing the gospel with anyone who
[43:32] would listen you know I sense also that
[43:35] there will be people watching this
[43:37] program who have experienced the kind of
[43:40] discouraging setbacks that you did I
[43:43] mean I think you may be the only person
[43:45] and all the all the acquaintances and
[43:48] friendships that I've had in ministry
[43:50] through the years I think you're
[43:51] probably the only person I've ever heard
[43:53] of opening up the phone book and calling
[43:55] I loved the zeal behind that I do and I
[43:58] know your heart was just to find a place
[44:01] absolve him ever wherever - I think part
[44:11] of that was proving ground wasn't and I
[44:14] mean God was was allowing you to come to
[44:16] a place where it didn't matter if it was
[44:18] the pulpit or or on the street corner
[44:21] you just wanted to share the fire that
[44:22] was in you and there must be somebody
[44:24] watching that's had a lot of closed
[44:26] doors in their life knows they've heard
[44:30] a lot more knows what would you
[44:31] encourage of course preachers but but
[44:34] anyone who has a vision a burden to do
[44:37] something for the Lord and every time
[44:39] they start making a step it's it seems
[44:41] like there's doors being closed in their
[44:43] face what would you say to them I would
[44:46] I would challenge you that if you feel
[44:48] like that one door after another is
[44:51] being closed for you the the thing that
[44:55] sustained me through that period of time
[44:58] in my life was the word faithfulness
[45:02] that God was warming me to be faithless
[45:06] yes and as I was faithful to God
[45:10] what I discovered more importantly was
[45:13] that God was faithful to me yes a man
[45:17] and what I realized was that God was
[45:20] preparing me he was preparing me and he
[45:24] was allowing me to understand that I had
[45:28] been brought into the kingdom for such a
[45:31] time as this in those in those early
[45:35] moments of my life and ministry and
[45:37] conversion I probably wasn't as ready as
[45:41] I felt like I was but God certainly had
[45:45] a plan he wanted me to be faithful right
[45:47] and he wanted me to understand that
[45:50] although I did not think so he had his
[45:54] eye upon me and I would like to say to
[45:57] you today that if you feel like you have
[46:00] experienced a lot of disappointing
[46:03] setbacks in your life and maybe perhaps
[46:06] you feel all alone remember that God
[46:10] does not have to autograph every single
[46:14] page of your life to be a part of it
[46:16] sometimes God does his greatest work in
[46:21] your life and mind when he is behind the
[46:24] scene and we can't see him
[46:26] sometimes we can't feel him sometimes we
[46:30] can't sense him sometimes we wonder if
[46:33] he even realizes that we still exist
[46:36] right amen oftentimes it's in those
[46:41] moments that God is busy behind the
[46:44] scene and he is working on our behalf
[46:48] amen so be faithful your advice is to be
[46:52] faithful because it teaches us about the
[46:54] faithfulness of God absol absolutely if
[46:57] we will be faithful to God God will
[47:00] certainly be faithful to us and one of
[47:03] the things that we'll understand is that
[47:05] God is always right on time always God's
[47:09] time schedule and our time schedule does
[47:12] not always coincide that
[47:15] the fact of the matter is oftentimes we
[47:19] want to get in a hurry and we want
[47:21] everything to be as instant and as quick
[47:24] as possible right however God oftentimes
[47:29] a seems to kind of wait he but really
[47:33] the fact of the matter is that he's just
[47:35] simply allowing us to know that his time
[47:38] clock in our time clock is not always
[47:40] the same but he is always right on time
[47:45] he is never a moment too early
[47:47] he's never a moment too late he's always
[47:51] right on time
[47:53] absolutely I know that at some point in
[47:56] your life your ministry developed into a
[47:58] tent ministry were you pastoring first
[48:01] before you were doing the evangelistic
[48:03] work or how did that how did that come
[48:05] about in order did you go immediately to
[48:07] the tenants as my ministry began to
[48:11] unfold and I began to feel the call of
[48:13] God and accept the call of God and move
[48:17] toward ministry God allowed some very
[48:20] special men with some very powerful
[48:23] ministries and gifts to come into my
[48:27] life and those men had tent ministries
[48:31] and so naturally because of the impact
[48:35] that they had upon my life there was a
[48:39] great love that quickly developed in my
[48:42] heart for the tent ministry and I began
[48:45] to see the opportunity that people could
[48:48] be reached in that venue and so it is
[48:52] that as a young man I didn't have any
[48:55] idea how I would ever be in the tent
[48:58] ministry but God allowed some people to
[49:02] invest in my life a man gave me a
[49:06] telephone call and said would you come
[49:09] and preach for me a couple of nights I
[49:12] quickly agreed because back in those
[49:15] days I wanted to walk through every door
[49:17] that God opened regardless of where it
[49:20] was at big or small and before the
[49:24] conversation was over he said now
[49:27] brother Hicks I want
[49:27] you'd understand that we don't have any
[49:30] money we are struggling ourselves we're
[49:33] a whole mission Church we only have a
[49:35] handful of people he said however I can
[49:38] promise if you'll come we'll provide you
[49:41] with a place to stay and we'll provide
[49:44] you with plenty of food to eat and I was
[49:47] just as happy as a jaybird on a
[49:49] chocolate cake I mean to tell you I was
[49:52] excited about the door being opened and
[49:55] so I was counting down the days and I
[50:00] finally made my way to that small little
[50:03] home mission church in Kentucky
[50:05] Friday night Saturday night to services
[50:09] on Sunday and god-glory visited us in
[50:13] those services and on Sunday evening
[50:16] there was some people who came to the
[50:18] service that invited me to their home
[50:21] after service and for some fellowship
[50:24] and so it was that I went to their home
[50:27] and we had fellowship and when the
[50:30] fellowship was coming to a close I was
[50:33] getting ready to drive all night back to
[50:36] North Carolina to prepare for some more
[50:38] services in the future and they said
[50:42] brother Hicks we would like to give this
[50:44] to you and we hope that it'll be a
[50:47] blessing to you it was in a brown sack
[50:49] and I just took the sack and thank them
[50:53] for it got in my car started down the
[50:56] highway I'll never forget I reached
[50:58] Knoxville Tennessee it must have been
[51:00] about 3 o'clock in the morning I pulled
[51:03] over went into a and an all-night Waffle
[51:07] House and refreshed myself got a cup of
[51:11] coffee because in my mind I thought they
[51:14] had given me some food for the road I
[51:16] went back outside and I had the coffee
[51:19] in my hand I reached over and I picked
[51:22] up the bag that I had just sat in the
[51:24] seat beside me and when I opened up the
[51:27] bag how shocked I was because it was not
[51:30] sandwich ism it was eight thousand
[51:33] dollars in $20 bills my
[51:36] and I was absolutely astounded because I
[51:40] had never seen $8,000 in my life and I
[51:45] knew the very moment that I saw that
[51:48] $8,000 that God wanted me to buy a tent
[51:51] mine I took that money and I purchased
[51:54] my very first tent and God blessed in
[51:59] such a miraculous way my water provision
[52:02] what a faithful God to meet the need
[52:05] very faithful so it wasn't sandwiches
[52:08] not at all not at all we have about five
[52:12] minutes left and I'd like for you to
[52:14] spend that time praying yes I really
[52:18] would because I know there are people
[52:19] who watch this program who have needs
[52:22] and I know that in the spirit but I also
[52:25] know that in the natural because you're
[52:27] faithful to call we have a prayer line
[52:30] and many of you have called and some of
[52:34] you have spoken with staff members
[52:35] others of you have called after our
[52:38] hours and left messages and we've
[52:40] carried those needs to the body here and
[52:43] we have prayed and we're already hearing
[52:45] testimonies of how God is answering
[52:48] prayer we serve a prayer answering God
[52:52] and let me say if you've not taken the
[52:55] opportunity to send in your prayer
[52:57] request you can be assured that we will
[53:00] take them before the Lord will join our
[53:02] faith with your faith and believe God to
[53:05] meet your needs he's still a healer he's
[53:08] still a savior he is still a deliverer
[53:10] and he cares about our needs big and
[53:13] small brother Hicks just say a word or
[53:17] two about God's faithfulness to answer
[53:20] prayer and then pray pray for the needs
[53:23] of all of the people who will see this
[53:26] program whatever they are I would
[53:28] certainly want to remind you today that
[53:31] the beautiful thing about prayer is that
[53:33] not only does God hear us when we pray
[53:38] but God stands ready and willing to
[53:42] answer us man when we pray that is why
[53:46] he said
[53:47] ask and you shall receive seek and you
[53:50] shall find knock and the door shall be
[53:53] opened unto you he would later say what
[53:57] things soever you desire when you pray

[54:05] you shall have them I want you to know
[54:08] today that there's nothing too big yes
