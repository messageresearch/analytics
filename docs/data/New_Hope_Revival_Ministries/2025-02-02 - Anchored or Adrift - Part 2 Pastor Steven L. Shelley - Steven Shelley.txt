========================================

Description:
This message calls believers to spiritual positioning in Christ, where worship creates an atmosphere for transformation. True freedom comes from standing in the cleft of the Rock, the smitten Christ, where generational iniquities are broken, and divine mercy is revealed. We are not just spectators but participants in God's unfolding plan, anchored in His Word. By cleaving to Him, we find strength, revelation, and the power to overcome in this prophetic hour.

hallelujah brother Kate is not going to sing for us and let amen amen [Music] I've had visions and I've had dreams I've even held them in my [Music] hands but I never knew they would s right through oh like there were only grains of [Music] s the Anor hold though the ship is battered the anchor [Music] hold though the Sails are to and I have fall in all my knees as I face the reny The Anchor Holds in spite of the song and I have Journey Through The Long Dark [Music] Night Out On the Open Sea [Music] my faith Al alone he was side unnown and yet His Eyes Were Watching Me and the anchor hold oh though the ship is batter oh the anchor though the Sails are [Laughter] Tor and I have fall on my knees as I face all the reny The Anchor Holds in spite of the stor and I have been oh but I'm older

anchor the SS are Tor I have fallen and I have fallen on my knees as I the agency the [Music] Anor in Sp of the praise the Lord the anchor hes the anchor hes would you give God praise with me what a solid rock hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you so much we thank all of you who've given so much to help us in the the service last night in the service this morning we we don't take it for granted we know that some were here last night straight from work and yet they come and consider it a privilege to give their gifts to the Lord and we become the beneficiaries of it because it takes an atmosphere brother brandom talked about Papa Bosworth and the story that he always told and he said it didn't matter whether it was uh under a hound dog or under a mother hen or whatever it was it takes atmosphere to hatch the eggs he said do you put eggs under a hound dog and if if she would lay on them while they would hatch even though that hound dog is not the mother because it takes atmosphere and that's what worship creates your sincere praise and the anointing that breaks every yoke of bondage creates an atmosphere the Bible tells us that this morning in this atmosphere we are seated together amen I want you to help me say we are seated together in in Christ Jesus that's where we are right now we are living in dual dimensions a part of us is here on planet Earth and as we worship and the word begins to lift us then there's a part of our being that's represented Before the Throne of God Amen maybe that's too much for some of you but that's what his word has taught us amen and so we are bidimensional people given the grace of of God to have a physical existence on this Earth but the ability to be moved into Heavenly places as we focus on the name of Jesus he's here I want to tell you this morning he is here I brought him how many of you brought him he's here he's here and he will do whatever we let him do you say I don't know about that language it's right language because our faith determines how much of him is loosed in this service it's according to our faith according to your faith be it done unto you isn't that what he said so may God anoint our faith right now may we lift above the realm of Hope and come into a place of perfect Faith to believe that whatever God would desire we are with him and not in his way and whatever we have need of that our faith would touch him and he would activate that reality in all of us I I I feel it's not about feelings but I feel something in in the atmosphere that my I don't know whether to say this so many visitors here are not but every cell uh in my body is responding to something that God is doing in the atmosphere and I feel something moving from the inside and maybe you think that sounds just absolutely uh uh weird or strange but you were created by that God you you are his creation and every cell of your body responds to his voice you believe that and I feel him in this house and I'm going to pray him whether I feel like it or don't whether I feel him or not it's not whether we feel him or not but when we can we should and when we do we ought to be very grateful for it thank you for being here thank you for coming and supporting this meeting I want you to get ready to go again to Hebrews chapter 2 I want to make just a few quick announcements because I have a tendency to uh to forget things and uh somebody said well you should write them down oh I do I just don't always re remember to read them but I write them down yesterday was Sister Hannah hollowell's birthday and I meant so much to we said happy birthdayday to her last Sunday but she's here and I miss my opportunity uh happy birthday sister Hannah God bless you and uh I'm I'm just wanting some of the rest of them to come in now I need to make some announcements kind of along that line but but our next fellowship meeting is Saturday uh and Sunday April 5th and 6th and we'll try to have a a uh maybe God willing April or June we'll try to have another special speaker to come and minister to us so April 5 and 6 June 7 and 8 is the is the one following and then August 2nd and 3rd and then our camp meeting this year is October the 7th through October the 12th now you folks that are here don't don't write us tomorrow and ask us when camp meeting is this is your chance to jot it down or to get your neighbor to remember so that you won't miss camp meeting this year October 7th through the 12th who's speaking I don't know I don't know what the vessel is going to look like but I know the Holy Ghost is going to do the talking I'm confident of that if you are say Amen today is Sister Rebecca's husband hollis's birthday although he's not here we want to pray for him and lift him up Tuesday is Ginger is she here is ginger here somewhere well she doesn't have oh there she is right in the middle in the back Tuesday is her birthday and those of you that didn't know she is a spoken for sister in fact her her wedding is coming up uh February 15th and her beloved is flying in on her birthday I wonder if that was planned he's flying in from Iceland on their on her birthday so we are we know that it's an exciting time for her it's also Sister Mary bot's birthday in uh in Calgary and we send our love to her as a faithful streamer um I know they're oh there they are come in for just a minute uh brother come come in just a minute because I wanted to make an announcement two announcements that I didn't make yesterday uh last Sunday well I didn't know about one of them but we are so very delighted to tell you that Brother David Yantis and sister Ashley TBO Yantis are going to have another baby a gift of God to their life and family so let's congratulate [Applause] them is okay and I got a text yesterday I had to make sure that I got that one in first because that was supposed to be mentioned last Sunday but now we get this exciting out of the blue surprise news that brother Austin and sister Hannah Hollowell are are expecting another baby so we want to congratul ulate them praise [Applause] God this is what we call Church growth we're thankful amen Hebrews chapter 2 I want to again respect and give honor to all of you who have sacrificed to be here and I realize that you're all on a journey and the journey gets hot and it gets hard but the answer is keeping your anchor on the solid rock he never disappoints can you say amen amen I'm a little bit needy when I preach I I Need a Little Noise I need an amen from you I need you to at least wiggle your finger or your toe in your shoe to show me just a little bit of pull because uh my old granny used to say that when you say Amen to a Holiness preacher it's like saying sick them to a dog well I must be a dog because every now and again I need an amen let it be one from the heart but don't just absorb because every time you say Amen you are claiming a promise amen so be it that's what amen means so be it and you're not just saying so be it for the body you're saying so be it that's right for me therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him father we approach your life giving word it changes us the revelation of your love as brother Hawk was praying when your love becomes a revelation to us it changes our perspective so today we are here for a a shift in our perspective we have seen the the darkness getting closer to to us in this hour and we desire not to be overwhelmed or overcome by that Darkness we desire to scatter it by being filled with your light when you walk in a room Darkness has to flee when you walk in a room doubt has to go and anxiety and depression has to go a disease has to go and heaviness has to go so Lord we invite you to come and unveil yourself to us through your word and may we leave here with a a deeper determination to hold on to your word in this unsettling hour while there are many voices that are speaking Desiring to have our attention Lord may we keep our he our frequency Our receiver tuned to your voice may we hear it clearer and louder than any other voice may it be so uh uh profound in our spirit that that all other voices are drowned out and and we have courage to walk by the leadership of the Holy Spirit Break Every yoke right now in the name of Jesus we thank you for bringing all Spirits under your author Authority that your word might cut the atmosphere and accomplish all that you've sent it forth to do we ask this thing in the mighty name in The Only Name under heaven where B men may be saved the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bashim Adonai Yeshua hamashiach and the Saints said you may be seated stay tuned in if you possibly can last night we discussed what it means to let these things that we have heard slip away it's not as though we have found ourselves on a slippery slope we are standing on a solid foundation the Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of the Holy Apostles and Prophets we are told in the New Testament that Foundation is not prophetic or Apostolic that Foundation is the Lord Jesus Christ the apostles and Prophets of the scripture are built on the foundation of the Lord Jesus Christ and on top of their leadership the church is established Jesus said to to Simon blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and thou art Peter Petros it means a rock but it means a chip off the bigger Rock it's it means a smaller Stone it's more like a piece of gravel it testifies not only of of its size the word in in Greek but it also testifies to us that this particular Rock has come from a larger rock Rock of Ages cleft for me so Peter in the mind of God was a little stone that had been chiseled off a bigger Stone that's what you and I are amen we are Lively Stones the scripture said we are living stones because we have come from the original Stone as brother Brandon would say not the Rock of Gibralter but the rock of aen how many of you are glad that you're standing surefooted on the rock that will never roll Hallelujah well prophetically he did roll because Daniel said I saw a stone HED out of the mountain side and it came rolling down through Babylon on striking that old uh giant the image that Daniel saw striking that image on on the on the feet and and shattering that Kingdom that desired to rise up and exalt itself against the name and knowledge of Jesus Christ in the end time a false religion that mixes with it its Palo Rome coming together with a a political system and my we're not waiting on that to come it's here the Nations have made their Federation and the world is is growing darker but the light of God in his bride it's not dimming oh I'm going somewhere if you'll go with me it's not dimming his light is getting bright as you and I let it shine through US amen nothing can stand before a people who are surefooted on the Rock of Ages so it's not a slippery sto slope that we're standing on we're standing on a solid rock but sometimes because we think we have learned it all or we have come to know it all we let precious truth come Drifting by us and we miss it when brother brandham had the vision of the bear H this silver tipped Grizzly I don't think that bear ever knew that he was going to cause so much controversy uh as as that bear has caused because so many people have said aha there is a vision that didn't come to pass but they missed something in the telling of that of that event that you and I need need to understand the weather was different that morning than it had been and folks were out of sorts and those who were there give this testimony that I I firmly believe has some great value and weight and Merit Among Us brother brandom understood that there is a possibility that we miss what God desires to do in the timing that he desires to do it that doesn't mean he's not God he's God's Sovereign and God supreme but there are certain Visions there are certain things that that he would like to do and desires to do in us and and we must cooperate we must participate in the plan you understand we've got to be in the right place at the right time in the early days of brother ROM's Ministry he he would find himself uh Envision concerning uh uh some prayer needs that somebody would come with and they would come the next day and he would notice that something was not quite right and he would say no no no wait a minute you sit here are you listening you sit here and then you take that chair he was bringing people into alignment with what he saw because he saw God was going to bring the healing that was needed but but in order for the vision to be fulfilled everybody had to be in the right position somebody said I don't know if I believe that or not better check the book because the book teaches that principle you've got to be lined up it's not enough just to believe the truth it's not enough just to say I believe the word we've got to know what God is doing right now I love what God did in the 50s and 60s but I missed it I didn't show up till 1968 the prophet is gone the healing Revival has finished and so I can't just live my life in in in the 50s and 60s I have to believe that the god of the 50s and the god of the the 60s is still Jehovah Rafa he's still God Sovereign and supreme in 2025 how about the Saints giving a little amen and so it's it's also important to understand the seasons and the cycles of what God is doing in his people and there is a season going on right now where we are examining our hearts because we know that our hearts our blood pump but the Lev in Hebrew the heart is the seat of the emotions and most of us struggle in the area of mind will and emotions and and so that greatest battle that's ever fought is being it's being waged right now in this little bride and that's the season now where God is is putting his finger on things that we have allowed to to uh sprout in us a little resentments little prejudices sir little judgments and he's saying I can't have a people uh fully surrendered until they will dig in their garden and allow me by the Holy Spirit to help them I want you to know it's painful brother have you ever had a tooth pulled without novacaine it's painful would anybody want to have their appendix took out without medication without some you and I want to be Cowboys sometime but we couldn't have lived in the in the old west where they just poured a little Whiskey on them and cut them open we want to we don't even want to see the doctor knock me out before I get in there I don't want to know anything until it's all over and everything's put back into place you understand but sometimes God reaches in us oh yes and he starts extracting things from us that we thought we wanted to get rid of until they're gone on and we have come become so used to what we've carried that when it's taken from us it hurts still the hurt remains and God wants to heal every Wounded Heart in this house house he wants to heal every Wounded Heart in his little bride around the world we're not going to be a basket case at Rapture time we're not going to be addicted to nerve pills and anxiety pills at Rapture time he's going to have a people strong and mighty because they have been molded in the stature of the perfect man fully ad opted so that their name on the check their identity is no longer as I said last night former Amish or or the Pentecostal side of the message or or the dry side of the message or the Thunder side or the two Soul side or the come on he's going to have a people that their identity is not with who they fellowship with their identity is going to be mising is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and it won't matter in that moment who your pastor is or what your flavor is or your particular slant in the message is what's going to matter is that you are fully adopted and your name is the same as his name and in that moment of quick short work it's it's anastasis it is a reproducible resur ction right here on the earth it will bring eventually after God begins to stir in that he our loved ones will begin appearing to us and so if the old church hasn't kicked you out yet when you start letting it be known I caught a glimpse of my of my old sainted mother or I come on they're going to think you have surely lost it somebody said I have to see that in the word oh yes I'm glad you mentioned that because the Bible tells us that in the first resurrection that's how it was why shouldn't it be that way in the last Resurrection the Bible said the veil of the temple was torn in Twain the Earth Shook and darkness covered the face of the deep the Bible said and many of the Saints which slept you don't think they were taking a nap do you they were graveyard dead many of the Saints which slept arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem and appeared to many amen hallelujah yes that's exactly right Hallelujah because we've got some over there and when we see that we'll know that this is Rapture time we're in that last season and cycle and brother I want you to know there will not have to be a sick one Among Us I don't believe that he's taking a bride out of here that is sick and defeated and broken and maimed and Halt and blind I believe that Resurrection cycle when it unfolds we're in the process of rapture now but when that final part begins to unfold every sickness every infirmity will begin to drop off of us those who are alive and remain will begin to feel the renewing of the spring it's coming folks it's closer than it's ever been we must not let these truths slip by us like icebergs we must grab a hold of them ground them in the word if you hear brother brandom say something you take that right back and find how to place that in the word and if you can't do that don't you make a doctrine of it on don't you make a doctrine of it if it's going to be a Doctrine it's got to find its place properly posed positioned in the word does anybody believe that so we are living in an hour there there's only one way it seems that we can make sure that our heart stays pure and our hands stay clean so that we have no hindrance ascending the hill of the Lord I I I don't want to wait till eternity to ascend the hill of the Lord every day I want to make my way up to Zion spiritually and and who can go there except he that hath Clean Hands no blood come on no blood that's right you're not guilty of murder right you've laid that aside remember what he said you don't have to take a gun to be guilty of murder he said you you tear somebody's influence down you've assassinated their character you're guilty you you you'll never go up properly and daily to the hill of the Lord with Innocent blood on your hands repent make it right if you have told things that have caused people to lose confidence in those that God might have even chosen to use for them or for their loved ones now is the time to repent make it right so that you can go up to the hill of the Lord with Clean Hands a pure heart one of the ways to make sure that that is true is to do what the scripture said Psalm 51 the repentance prayer of the psalmist for thou desirest not sacrifice 51:16 else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit one that is not hoty one that has been dashed against The Rock and has been broken not by the world not by Family you've been broken by the Rock of Ages let me tell you something that is what we're missing sometimes is throwing ourselves on The Rock when we do it's going to break us but it's going to break the part of us that needs to be broken have you ever said Lord I throw myself on your mercy I have Lord I throw myself on your mercy I throw myself on you I want you to break me so that you can easier extract from me what what I have picked up from my life Mama issues and daddy issues and family troubles and church hurts and but who the man or the woman I hope you're hearing me the man or the woman who refuses to to be broken the one who refuses to throw himself or throw herself not only once and for all but quite consistently we need to be dashed against The Rock because God said I'm not looking for sacrifices of of burnt offerings and lambs and and sheep and this such anymore but but I am looking for a broken and a contrite humble heart oh God if I come with a broken and a contrite heart you will not despise you will not reject this is also for the believer brother brandom said in the message he calleth for you let's be a real Christian let this fire let this church be on fire prayer meetings going all the time it doesn't have to be organized it doesn't have to be we'll meet every Wednesday at 12 but it has to be that we find ourselves in a spirit of Prayer not a spirit of Gossip oh I need some preaching help I thought I was in the right place this morning for some amen help oh we've got to have a a spirit of prayer brother R said you can do a lot of things too much but there's one thing you'll never do too much and that's pray oh my and your prayer is not a Santa Claus list your prayer is oh God give me what I need what you desire I want to be positioned to receive and when we don't know how to pray he the spirit you get in your prayer closet there is no church order that's right hello that's right you get in your prayer closet and you let the spirit of God lead you and direct you in prayer and if you feel a groan coming up from your inner man groan own if you feel travail just travail if you feel God giving you uh somehow letting you capture a Heavenly language when you pray pray in that language speaking in tongues is not the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost that is a life that is surrendered to every word of God so you can talk in tongues and not have the real Holy Ghost but because that is a revealed truth doesn't mean that that you don't have the same blessing that God gave the early church and he said when you don't know how to pray as you should the spirit of God will will make intercession for you through you with groanings that cannot be and that word uttered is a word that actually means understood when we get to praying sometime and something begins to oh God oh God especially those of us who are not prone to emotion now I'm prone to emotion I I I I I just thought I should tell you that about myself I go all in I just go all in but but even you that are not prone to emotion if the spirit of God should move on you that way in your prayer time let him have his way and I'll never tell on you it's it's the bride's special power it's her special gift to be able to let the holy spirit of God if it's a groan let it be a groan if it's a sound that you don't understand let it be a sound you don't understand but you are uh living below your privileges if you you don't find that channel of prayer it's for you somebody said that's just for a few certain people let me tell you something that's not what the scripture says we want to stay in the scripture don't we so I I want to move on we need a church on fire we need a church on fire put your hand right here I'm a church on fire they they got over to uh to uh Wales they're looking for the Welsh Revival where are the where are the Jeffrey Brothers we we hear that there's a great revival going on in in Wales the southern part of the United Kingdom or England at the time and and we hear that God's doing amazing things and the old miners are getting saved and they're having to retrain the mules that go into the mines because they trained them with curse words and the old miners have been going to the Welch Revival getting born again yeah how many of you know when you get born again your language gets born again and and so their language got born again and and they but before that they would use curse words to tell the mule which way to go when they got saved they couldn't say those words anymore so the mule didn't know what to do that's Revival somebody say that's Revival oh may God give such a Revival that we don't talk the same way personal personal I'm not talking about a national Revival I'm talking about a personal Revival may God do that so that we have to learn a new vocabulary maybe we have to take up new habits Lord may we have to change our pastimes because we get so passionately filled with the love for you are you here oh my so they went over to see it I want to see this for myself you know then there weren't any Concords or jet planes and they had to go by ship they left the United States sailed all the way to to to England and then wanted to make their way down to Wales to see where the Revival was but they couldn't get any information there was no internet no Twitter Twitter No IG Facebook oh my goodness a 100,000 more so they they they didn't know how to get there and they saw Bobby that is a British policeman and in those days they had little and and some today I've seen them in my travels to England preaching they had these little round concrete stands out in the middle of the intersection and the there's a police officer standing there a Bobby with a big hat and a a boy stick and a badge and he is directing traffic or he's watching over to make sure people are obeying the signals they've got a bunch of those roundabouts and and they try to bring those over here to Lee County some of you've got them up there in opala and nobody knows how to use them that's obvious and they must have not trusted their folks over in England either cuz they put a Bobby out there in the middle directing people so they went up to him and they said can sir excuse me can you please tell me how where is the Welch Revival we've come from America we've been traveling 90 days plus and now we desire to see this Welch Revival oh that Bobby that officer he didn't have to give them a map he said it's right here you're looking at the Revival the Revival of fire the bride's Revival of third seal Brides Revival promise there is an individual Affair not a national not an international Affair it's an individual Affair oh God may we step into it today May somebody move into that desperation that brings the evidence of that stirring so deep within the fibers oh oh yes the fibers of their being that they are able to possess every promise he spoke to the storm I have some storms you ever fa any storms there's word in your mouth there's Authority in your mouth to do something about it sister mey with a tumor in her body before the doctor's hand would touch you let that tumor be gone in the name of Jesus Christ by Spoken Word Authority brother brandom in shreport Sister MAA back home in Jeffersonville he had that unction he wanted to be there couldn't get there in time time from where he was down at Jack Moore's inport but the word of the Lord inspiration came somebody said that's because he was a prophet that's because he was a church age messenger that's because he was a spokesman for the seventh angel that's because he was Malachi 4 that's no no no it's because he was a Son of God it's because he was a Son of God who had come into that adoption the one that Jesus found on the Mount of Transfiguration when the voice didn't just say I'm pleased to dwell in you but he said I'm pleas hear him you see brother brandom had to come to that place like a wave sheath offering he had to come to that place of spiritual maturity that God could say over his life hear him he's talking for me now if you think that that's one to a generation You' misunderstood that's a messenger one to a generation but Jesus was the first seed he he was the first fruits of the Resurrection he was the first son to come to maturity he was the first fruits of Resurrection meaning that if he came to maturity they're going to have to be some more seed that come to maturity and speak to their tumors brother and sister hadie writes two sons bunch of snicker doodles or what do you call them Snicker fritzel Fritz Snicker Fritz I I'm I'm not German I don't know how to put the fritzes and the itses and all that together you know but their Rebellion their Rebellion they're they're they're just teenage today we would almost say like punks but back then Snicker fitzel or fitzel or they were mocking and laughing and having a big time at the at the speaking of this creation of of squirrels by the spoken word of God somebody said that's such an amazing thing well listen God can do that he does it every day in the ocean he has that little starfish a certain kind of that starfish loses an arm or a leg or whatever starfish have and it regenerates that's something God knows exactly how to do he placed it within them to be able to do it don't you know he can do that today and and he can create and restore even missing limbs he's the greatest transplant surgeon he can give somebody a new heart a new kidney a new liver somebody said I've never seen or heard anything like that well let me tell you something God's just waiting on a people that will take him at his word oh my my just a minute I don't have any windshield Whoppers so I have to take time to be my own windshield whoer here I want to be one of those that Cleaves that clings so close to him I I uh I I wanted to go back over some of the things but I I won't take the time to do that but I want to just pick one thing out of of where we were last night and and and say that the lesson that was to be learned from bael peor was that there is always the temptation to compromise I I failed to mention last night that just before the plague struck and the plague came because the children of Israel were lusting after the women of Midian and Moab and they began to lay with those women those foreign women that God had told his people not to be mixed with and when they began to do that they begin to lose the favor of God over the nation and it began to manifest in various forms of division stay with me just a moment compromise will divide that's right when when you start going out pitching your tent towards Sodom laying your head in Delilah's lap it divides the body and people start getting their eyes on one another and they start patterning after one another and they'll say well she does it he does it that family can and the next thing you know they'll be patterning after one another how many of you know that was never God's intention it was his his intention for us to pattern our life and our lifestyle after the word oh God make us word people make us strong in our stand and strong in our convictions that if everybody in the message has a Christmas tree that will stand against [Music] paganism oh just a minute Amen brother I'll just help myself may God give us such conviction that we're not looking to see what other churches are doing but we're going to stay on the word and we're going to flee Babylon and we're going to flee Pagan Rome we don't want anything to do with the gods of of the Heathen but here were the Israelis the Israelites the Hebrew people lusting and not only that they begin to worship the god of the Heathen Nations bpor and this was a filthy God this was a fertility God it was a God that was worshiped with all kinds of terrible practices of of of orgies and and I I don't know brother brandom called it free love but it's way more than than that it it it was filthy ungodly hideous forms of worship and this was God's people and the favor of the Lord and just before the plague came did you understand that God said kill them God said destroy them the only way to get out from under that influence is to take them out now we know we're not living under that Covenant of the javelin we're not in that dispensation where we take the Vengeance of God into our own hands but in that day you see the T Commandments doesn't say in Hebrew it doesn't say thou shall not kill English it says thou shall not kill in Hebrew it says thou shall not murder and murder was to take somebody's life out of anger out of jealousy out of Envy out of a a case of adultery and you wanted to remove the partner selfish reasons but there were times under that old Covenant that God said kill every one of them men women and children right you may think that was extreme and I would have to agree with you just slightly except that from where God was sitting his perspective was if we let one if we let one little no harm sin go on without standing against it in our own lives you have no Authority in somebody else's family neither do you have any respons responsibility right of what goes on in someone else's family but you're the priest of your home Brother come on and if you set your children down in front of the idiot box and feed them the filth of Babylon and the filth of the world that generation that you're raising will be farther away from Biblical truth than your generation and if Jesus carries their children where will they be the Pentecostal Church compromised when the old preachers preach it's better not to have a television get that thing out of your home the the Next Generation said we think we can control it and uh so maybe we will we'll just keep it and be careful with it and now this generation carries it in their hand carries it in their hand the enemy has more access to our lives in this generation than he ever has before and that means we're going to have to be on guard like we've never been before and a man that's not filled with the Holy Ghost doesn't have a filter he doesn't have a filter to know when it's affecting his Spirit everything that comes in your eye gate will have an effect on you everything that comes in your ear gate will have an effect on you everything that you smell on has an effect on your brain that's why we can walk into a kitchen and be carried back to our childhood because of a certain smell that smell itself is registered in a library in our brain amen so everything that we let in has an effect it finds real estate in our lives and if we're not careful it'll be enough am I going too far it'll be enough to make a creeper out of us us something that tightens us and bends us and molds us God help us there's got to be a way back to Holiness there's got to be a way back to Sanctified living there's got to be a way back amen yes sir the worst thing that somebody could do who has been delivered out of a system uh uh whether it's omish or minite or or Pentecostal or denomination this or that or whatever doesn't matter but the worst thing that somebody can do when they're pulled out into something higher is to is to feel like we're free now to do whatever the world does it breaks my heart when I see men and women called out of of one system into another because God wants to help them and the next thing you know they're looking exactly like the world that's not the kind of Exodus that God's involved in if God's pulling you out of one thing he's taking you higher come on now and you may be free to drive an automobile and you may be free to choose the color of curtains that you wear and you may be free to put a button where a button should be but that doesn't give anybody the right to go out into the world and pick up the fads and [Applause] Fashions he's slick amen he Sly yes sir to take a stand against sin requires courage and you and I need a more of it we need some of the Phineas anointing we need some of that anointing that set as for me in my house the problem is we get religious with it and we start wanting to enforce it on someone else's house as for me in my house amen Oh my he he tells us that that that there's something in us to wake us up if we listen in the message have not I sent thee paragraph 32 I hope you don't mind a few quotations mixed in here because it helps us to stay focused and when you feel that little buzzer down in your heart my ears so wet that my my microphone slipped off my ear no wonder we have to replace it all the time it gets rusted and when you feel that little buzzer down in your heart warning you then you better what if it's not what if you got yours on vibrating what if you've turned your ringtone off I'm preaching come on to who to you yes yes sir to you yes to me to all of us maybe we turn our ringtone off we've got it on vibrate well that's all right if you've got it in your pocket or in your hand but you lay it in another room you may not even hear hear it you when that when that alarm goes off on in your inner man and says you you are uh you are waiting into a a treacherous Waters you are on the edge we better listen to that when that buzzer begins to warn us we better stop right there and do what take inventory we better check up on our payments to the Lord he said like I was preaching the other night of the people of God doing what drifting away from God when you hear the word come right back it's truly the word of God there's a little buzzer Rings you better listen to it because the the next voice you hear will tell you she does it half the church does it so you better listen to the first buzz you better hear the first voice don't listen don't walk across that because if you do that little thing rolling around we last night before Corners the old black man said it makes a circle after a while it numbs you and you don't feel it anymore don't keep Crossing that line cuz you'll never get any farther till you come right back here where you left him don't even be I don't want you to even be like Joseph and Mary took them days right they didn't have a dozen children but it took them days to realize that Jesus wasn't walking with the cousins then they realize he's not even with us we've got to go back and get him and and where did they find him in the town they left him and if you keep walking past that buzzer you'll realize one day amen he's no longer on board the brother random said if you get dead cats on the line you can't get a signal through how many of you believe it's time to get all the isms and the sisms all the feelings and the strangeness and all the things that the enemy is trying to put on us us toward one another it's time to get all that off the line anybody here in the message letting off pressure there's a way back I want to tell you there's a way back there's a way back tell your neighbor there's a way back do you have another neighbor tell them turn to the other one there's a way back take me back this is letting off the pressure take me back to the Rock Lord take me back I'm drifting oh don't let me drift away from it if I'm going to eat let me eat around the [Applause] CFT let me stay close where the Mana is falling oh I'm just going to take a little break from church you was already spoiled now you'll be absolutely starved well I didn't get anything out of it anyway you don't know that there are times that just by sitting in the atmosphere where the presence of the Lord is moving there are things on the inside of us that are being shifted around and positioned so that God can help us out of our mess and we don't always feel it it's not always a a a a chill or a thrill it's not always hair standing up on our arm or or or chill bumps Goosebumps or whatever they call them sometime we're not feeling anything but because we've been obedient and we have chosen not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together even though our attitudes rotten and we really don't deserve to even be in the presence of the Lord there are things that take place sometime so you be careful how you say I didn't get anything you'll get exactly what you come to get and if you get anything else that you didn't come for Grace come on he said just stay as close to where the man is falling I don't have to wander out if I stay in the [Music] cliff Mana is laid right at the door is that not good is that not a beautiful quote I'm thankful there's something to hold us I'm going to get to something in a moment yeah but we're ready for you to be done well I'm just beginning the absolute he said that's why I know the holy spirit is my compass that guides me he is the one that makes me know his word is true this word is true he he he is my absolute he is my absolute he is my sunshine he is my life he is my anchor when troubles are on brother amm's telling you he's not only the rock that your anchor hits he's the anchor he's my North Star when I'm lost the holy spirit is my compass that guides me back to the place in another in another place in the absolute he said don't figure it out somebody read those next two words you can't don't try to be some kind of Theologian here and figure everything out you can't you will lose your mind trying that's right well what did he mean by that and why did he say this over here and something else over there I don't have any problem with the fact that you'll find something over here and a little something different over here what I have a problem with is when men get up and say it's all thus sayith the lord it's going to get quiet now it's not all thus sayith the Lord how do I know what is I thought a prophet how do I know how am I going to know you're going to know because you're going to do what he said there's a there's a lazy people that are that are identifying themselves as bride there's a lazy people in the land that don't want to do the homework don't you understand that everything God did is piled on top like this he said line upon line precept upon precept don't you know the message came in such a manner that we have to take it back it's like a teacher giving us a homework assignment it's like a tutor bringing us to maturity so that we can be trusted with the father's business you hear what I say and you take it back to the word and if you hear me say more than one thing about the same thing you go back and see what the word says and then you'll know exactly because Pro because Revelation is somewhat Progressive it's unveiling and I don't think it's safe to just say well if it was after 63 or it was before I I don't think that's the way we ought to interpret this message at all I think the best way to interpret the message is to let God interpret it for us by the word take it back to the word and if it fits if it Dove Tales like the the ticket at the Chinese Laundry then you know you've got a f Foundation to stand on don't get away from that don't spend more time on Google trying to figure it out do your homework take it back to the Bible we need that my my I I I wished I was there I wish I was there and you were here because I would amen you me you he said that's why he's my compass don't try to Fig figured out just believe it that's right now that doesn't mean believe it because it's hanging out there it means you take that back to the word and when you see where that's placed believe it with all of your heart because it has to be built on the same Foundation amen make him make him your absolute not a printed page not a magnetic recording him the Living Word Jesus Christ the sweet peace stay there stay there make him your absolute stay there the sweet peace and the experience that you'll never forget anchor to that and your anchor will hold Hallelujah within the veil Amen in the holy of holies not in the outer Court not in the inner Court not in the Holy place but in the holiest of holies when that Veil falls behind you it shuts you in and it shuts the world out don't ever turn loose of that word he said you'll never forget anchor to that and your anchor will hold within the veil let's bow our head he said How Great Thou Art how great th isn't he great in another place hear here's here's a few more it's it's just a few more mhm evening messenger I've had the privilege of preaching behind the pull pit and in the same church under the same pastor at that time that hosted brother brandom it was the Mesa Church Pastor Roy Carpenter in Mesa Arizona 1963 brother Brandon was scheduled to come back in the beginning of of 1966 and passed away uh uh Christmas time 1965 but this is a special message if you've never heard evening messenger paragraph 196 he said that's what you Pentecostal people had to separate yourself from the rest of the world straight with the word now don't fade back into the very thing that you come out of if you do you're what don't cut your anchor from Calvary does that sound like a man that was trying to attach you to himself or does it sound like a man that was trying to make sure that you saw who the star really is it's not the star in his hand that I follow it's the one whose hand was holding the star that's the one that I follow melik ham the king of the whole universe he said hold on to God's word for Upon This Rock I'll build that's what he said to Peter Petro Little Rock chipped off blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood is not revealed to thee you didn't hear this from Mom and Dad you didn't hear this from the church Cemetery you didn't hear this from some a preacher somewhere you received this as a Revelation from my father it was a revelation that the church wasn't built on a piece of gravel the church was built on a bigger Rock right the one that Peter was chipped off of hello and that rock is is a revelation it can be boiled down if you will it can be boiled down Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament the greatest mystery ever revealed I quoted that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament it matters it matters if you're still following a Babylonian threepers God you're not following then the god of the Bible at that point we did all we knew to do we followed the best way way that we knew how but when God opened our eyes and we saw that he's not three different people walking around in heaven ringing their hands over us but it's one God somebody said you know you're you you you're you're you're not preaching that Jesus is the is the second person in the godhead the second person of the Trinity no we're not preaching that at all we're preaching that Jesus is the only person in the godhead that's right the rest is eternal spirit it's logos it came forth from from a great Fountain of Light amen and truth and reality but when God decided to walk as a person to walk in a body of Flesh he's only done that completely one time it was in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ he was the word made flesh if you believe that say Amen if you don't believe that ask God to open your eyes to it that's right because there is false baptism uh can I be real plain well that's easy for some of you to say because it's not going to be on you but can I say to my precious brothers and sisters who've come from from anabaptist background your people your forefathers died murdered martyred because they had a conviction that baptism should not be infant some of them even saw that it should not be sprinkled or poured some of them had to to pull away from their own movements because they they saw that it should also be by immersion while many of the anabaptist went from a few drops to a cup of drops do you understand are you making fun no no no no I'm not because I think every step we make toward the truth should be celebrated and we should say God be praised I do I do if if you had a cup and not a Sprinkle I say praise God you were getting closer to the way that it was done to our Lord nobody sprinkled him nobody poured a cup of water on him it's death it's a symbol of death when you go down by immersion underneath those Waters you are symbolizing testifying prophesying I'm a part of his death and when that preacher pulls you up out of that water you're saying to God to the world around you to your brothers and sisters and to the Devil Himself I'm also raised with Christ Jesus many were murdered simply because they said it it shouldn't be a force it we shouldn't baptize our infants and sprinkle our infants it should be when a when a person is old enough to make a decision and you would think that that that people could just say okay you know you may have something there but instead their own church murdered them if you've read Fox's book of Martyrs you've only scratched the surface take a look at martyr's mirror look at some of the anabaptist writings and see how that for a simple fact you're not going to baptize our baby that eventually men and women were oh hideously horribly murdered and here's what breaks my heart to my brethren here's what breaks my heart for your people to have died choosing a truer baptism rejecting a false baptism and for you to remain in a false gospel that God is three people and that true baptism is in the name of titles breaks my heart because it was hatched in the very same system that sprinkled their babies and murdered your forefathers if you're going all the way go all the way back to the word if you can't understand ask God open my eyes I don't need a three-headed God I just need to find the god of the Bible I want him to be real in my life and I want to wear something more than just a title I want to wear his name I want to be his wife I desire to be his bride don't settle for just coming a little way out oh spirit of God Holy Ghost get on those here today that have received already that Revelation May their lives become so salty may you become so filled with the spirit of God that your community begins to be transformed yes I saw it many years ago I saw multitudes of Amish multitudes of of anabaptist people coming to the message of truth I saw myself riding in the back of an Amish buggy with a Bible on my lap and a spoken word book on my lap and and I knew that I would live to see and not that I've had a part but God knew who to use but I knew that I would live to see uh some of the of the embryonics and when I was sitting in my home in 201 14 what year did Brother green die 2015 or 2016 honey 2015 I think the year before brother green died they started 16 in 2015 they started streaming I'm off my subject but I don't care they started streaming Harmony of the desert and I didn't have the courage to go yet because I didn't I didn't want to you know I didn't want to draw attention and I it's been years and all all that Fellowship broken and whatever but I begin to watch these people coming to sing and there was a a what do you call Mari Mar Mariachi I'm I'm not very culturally diverse a mariachi band of Believers and they got up and played and sang their Marchi style of of music with Maracas and and uh accordion and whatever they had what else do they play guitars and they s singing the Praises of God from their culture and I said oh my that that really touches my heart and then I saw a group of of anabaptist people a group of what looked like Amish people get up and sing and they began to sing on that on that stream that I was watching and I knew in that moment I knew in that moment that God was doing something that he had let me catch a glimpse of years before I nearly knocked brother Levi fiser down the next year he didn't know me and I'm big bigger than life sometime and when I got to go the next year to take sister green and I saw some of those same people in that meeting and I thought I can just go and hug their neck and grab a hold of them and and tell them how glad I am to meet them but boy I I came on too strong and brother Levi fish I know his children are some of them and relatives and church people here but he looked at me and he goes I said I'm serious Brother God's going to do something I saw it years ago what did you see I began to tell him what I saw and he put his hand over my shoulder he said tell me more he was no longer bothered by my bear hug or by my tie or whatever else might would have caught his attention then he was interested and I want you to know God is only beginning it's only beginning and it's got to come quick it's got to come quick it's got to come quick because we're already entering the season of rapture it's got to come quick may God touch you that are here to come all the way to the revelation of who he is as one here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one may you soon if you haven't already made the choice to be baptized in his lovely name and then brace yourself because when you identify with him by name all hell puts a Target on your head and you're going to have to hold on to the Rock but the rock will hold you if you can't hold him it's 117 I have a little more time in in in another place did I read evening messenger yeah no did I don't cut your don't I think I did Upon This Rock yes let let me do this one paragraph 96 it's just like a ship a ship has an absolute and that ship's absolute is the anchor now when that ship is tossing Waters in tossing Waters where easily could be thrown against a rock or bursted up or hit ground where the water is not deep enough and the great swells coming up will Flash the ship and even turn it over it's got to have a deep enough water to float it it's or the waves will turn it over and a ship with an anchor that's great mighty of metal that drops out of steel it goes down until the top of the bed of the ocean somewhere in a top of a mountain down underneath the sea he's talking there's something down there and that great anchor pulls as the waves Rock the ship till it strikes the great big Spears into a rock and there the ship has an absolute it's anchored waves might toss it about but still that ship can stand still right where it's anchored because it's an absolute to it and Christ I want to hear you say Christ is my absolute Christ not your church Christ is your absolute you're tied to him in that manner no matter what anybody says how hard the persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be how it looks impossible for it to happen go on is there more if something has happened to in you that Christ becomes your absolute or any promise in the Bible becomes your absolute if you're sick and you're praying for healing and something comes to that strikes that promise in the Bible I've got it there's nothing going to wave you from it say Amen there's nothing Charles virgon said this I have learned to kiss the waves that throws me against the Rock of Ages don't waste another minute of your life I'm coming to the last section don't waste another minute of your life cursing the circumstances that have brought you where you are today God picked them he chose them the prophet says he harnesses troubles and problems he harnesses them to use them to execute his purposes in your life every heartache I'm so sorry for your hurts I'm sorry for your tragedies I'm sorry for your griefs he was not a stranger to grief he was not a stranger to tragic betrayals or to persecution and he's close to those who have broken hearts and I'm sorry that you had to go through it and some of it was so awful that it would be understandable that it affected the rest of your life but please know this that God may not have been the author of it because sometimes God isn't the instigator but he takes advantage he harnesses that that happens sometime and he will always use what touches your life for his glory to shape you to mold you to make you to what you should be today those waves are chosen and orchestrated not to destroy you but rather to preserve You by throwing us repeatedly against the solid rock the solid answer our only hope is found in him we all know what Philippians 46 and 7 says be careful for nothing but in everything well if you're like me and you're reading that without a little study or without the Holy Spirit making that real to you the old English here would say don't be careful with whatever you do just just don't even be careful just just do what no no no no no no that's old English you you've got to find out somehow how to to put that in some understanding it's not telling you not to be careful it's not telling you not to Be watchful let let me read it to you in this version it says do not fret or have any anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything not for everything in everything by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving continue to make your wants your desires your petitions known to God come on and God's peace shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ every now every one of them come on every one of my sins amen nailed yes I bear them somebody say I bear them no more no fearing nothing from God and being content with its Earthly lot of whatever sort it is let that peace stay on you which transcends all understanding it shall Garrison and mount guard over your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus hasn't he done that hasn't he been an answer to your anxiety if you'll let him be he will and closing Exodus 33 I won't take time to read it 18 through 20 Moses is called up into the mountain of the Lord and he says show me thy Glory I want to see your glory your cavod your heavy presence I want to see you for who you are God heard that request it should be the Cry of every man woman boy or girl in this house today in those streaming this service in the nations of the world I want to know you more don't be like Pentecostals and say well we spoke in tongues we've got it all don't be like message people and say because we've got the full revelation of the word that's all we need no you've got to have constant intimate fellowship with that word it's a daily daily communion it's a daily Union I want to know you Show Me Your Glory not just a social Gathering not just a Seeker sensitive surface Association not christianet who long for a sermonette those christianet who are satisfied with sermanet they need bassinets real Christians that I may know him Christians how many that I may know him Christians are in the house not people who come to see if they might catch a miracle or have a fish sandwich come on I want his presence few more minutes he doesn't need to perform a miracle to keep me around that's right I want him not just the blessings I want the blesser not just the gifts I want the giver Moses said just Show Me Your Glory and I need to read these verses for you to get this Exodus 33: 21-23 and the Lord said behold there is a place by me huh by me God said I've got a place by me and thou shalt stand not on a sifting sand come on help me now we're closing we're in this last cycle hear it you sure are asking I know I'm begging I'm begging on I I don't even care to be it doesn't bother me to beg you to hear it I want you to hear it and see if it lines up with the word because if it lines up with the word it might help you on the journey there's a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passees by that I will put thee in what King James translators translated Clift of the rock now when you hear the word Clift what do you think about a a bluff a place up on a mountain somewhere that you could stand on and look over a cliff in Modern English we take the tea off and we say it's a cliff but that word is not enough Cliff or Cliff because that word comes from a Hebrew word that doesn't mean just a particular Overlook on a mountain it means something more so hold on a moment I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by are you following that and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen now remember this what God was showing Moses Was preparing him to write the first five books of the Bible God said I'm going to show you my hinder parts do you know what that really means to us God was saying I'm going to show you where I've been Moses you weren't around but I'm going to show you what I've done and though Moses was not there in the beginning right Genesis 11 he was able to write that's right the first five books of the Bible through a scribe telling every detail and then God said and then God said and then God said and then God said he wasn't there how did he know because on that mountain he said I want to see your glory and God said if you're going to understand my present glory and catch a glimpse of my future Glory you're going to have to see my [Music] glory from the backside you're going to have to see the glory that I have already brought forth in creation and so Moses under the leadership of the Holy Spirit sits with a scribe and writes the first five books of the Bible as though he were an eyewitness somebody say that's remarkable sometimes you ask God for something you don't get get it just the way you think you're going to get it but you get something good Moses got something good the grace the ability the inspiration to write the first five books of the Bible as though he were an eyewitness because God let him see the hinder part he let him see what he had done are you still following me but it gets even better a Clift not a Clift in English it says Clift it's a cleft the Hebrew word says cleft and the cleft is different than a cliff a Clift is a place that is a result of a cleaving that has taken place a cleaving is the opening up or the breaking open of something unusually hard or solid a cleaving is a smid a striking that occurs by an earthquake sometimes and The Rock opens up hear it the rock opens up and in the opening of The Rock an earthquake splits The Rock and in the opening the the Hebrew word is translated whole you're going to stand in a hole in the Rock yes Lord amen oh Jesus today tomorrow and every day for the rest of my life let me stand in the hole in the Rock let me live in the cleaving of the rock let me live in the caft of the rock hide me in the hole that you have opened up for me in the Rock are you do you seem to all of that in that CFT in that cleaving in that smiting in that opening up of the rock Moses was to stand God said that's right by me I've got a place for you right by me in a hole in the Rock You preachers could preach this better than I if you caught that I don't even hardly have the words to preach it Moses I've got a hole right next to me and when you get in that hole you can see my glory you can see what I have done you can see a revel you see folks God said Moses go to the Clift stand in the position of Where The Rock was smitten from that perspective and Viewpoint you can see my glory remember Moses also smoted a rock at one point and the Striking of that rock caused a what not a cliff it caused a cliff the smiting did what it opened up the rock didn't it and what happened when the rock opened up anybody with me water began to flow out of the hole in the Rock God knew exactly what he was doing brother random said the next time he should have spoken to The Rock he said he threw everything in God's economy out of cater when he struck it the second time because he said Christ has been forever smitten once and you never has to be smitten again now all we have to do is now all we have to do is speak to the Rock do you understand what is available to us because of the hole in the Rock do you understand what has been made available to us for daily Su sustenance and and and sustaining Grace because the rock was opened up because the rock was struck because the rock was smitten 1 Corinthians 10:4 the Apostle caught it in the New Testament and he said and they did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank W Hallelujah they all drank water that came out of the rock but it this wasn't just any Rock This Rock was a type of Christ this rock it followed them what does that represent somebody said I don't think that was was was you know I think that was you know just totally symbolic well I'd like to I'd like to agree with your interpretation except for the fact that the New Testament word in Greek there for followed doesn't mean something that fell in squits it doesn't mean something that just sort of flowed out of a of a situation it followed it followed them it it no no the word that is used there means followed you understand what it means to follow come on Elli stand up the folks are missing I don't want them to miss this follow me is he behind me is he is he way back there if he's way back there he's not following me oh do it one more [Applause] time that's why I chose you yeah because I knew you knew it you do it that rock followed them they didn't know it they didn't understand it they were living in a in a covenant that was to open up to a newer Covenant but Moses perhaps maybe Joshua maybe some of the people would say that's a mighty familiar Rock there have we passed this way before have we ever I don't remember this particular spot but that rock looks so familiar it's because that rock was a type every place they went God wanted them to see the type of the rock that had been smitten for them amen I I could show it to you in archaeology if you needed to see it it came from the same mountain range of hor it's such a beautiful picture God is simply saying the rock is Christ The Rock has a Clift in it and that is where Moses was standing he didn't understand the fullness but God said I'm not going to talk to you out there on the edge I've got a hole right next to me I've Got A Plan of Redemption that you're a forerunner of because there's coming another one and he will be like you Moses he will be a prophet like you are but he will be so much more he'll be savior he'll be Redeemer he'll be healer in fact he will be salvation and his mother will call him Yeshua because his name means salvation that's where we've got to stand we've got to find that place in the rock musicians are coming slowly normally I tell you to come quickly come slowly but come not like elas fast moving but just like a wedding march come because I want to say something else Romans 66 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him you can't understand that in the world you can't understand that in church you can't understand that in religion the only place that you can understand that verse knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin the only way that you can understand that is if you'll stand in the cliff you've got to stand in the smitten Christ you've got to see it from the perspective of the rock that was opened up for for you you remember when that Soldier he's already dead soldier thrust that sword to make sure that he's dead and blood and water did what it come flowing out it wasn't urine it was the fluid it was it was pericardium fluid it was the fluid from the pericardium which is the fluid in the sack around the human heart that's heart underneath the load of his pain hear it his Agony his suffering his crucifixion the cruestv his par cardium the protective sack around the heart exploded you've heard the expression he died she died of a broken heart it's really a thing it's not the heart itself that explodes it's the sack around the heart the pressure builds up in the pericardial fluid and it ex and it burst and there's there's I don't know I I'm sorry I don't remember the amount of water that's there but quite amount of water and it runs down loose through the body it has no vein to carry it it just runs loose down into the organs and it it will settle down in the extremities of the body the bottoms of the digestive system and that spear went right in his side and when it did not only did his life's blood what was left of his life's blood not only did that run out but that paracardial fluid it came running out as well brother brandom said that's a type in the same manner that Eve was taken out of Adam that day at Calvary symbolically God was taking his bride out of the side of the crucified savior that's powerful why is that powerful because it explains scripture I was with him when he died I wasn't physically with him I was symbolically spiritually type in a type I was with him and when he when that narrow hole was pierced and the blood and the water flowed out he said it was like Eve being taken out of Adam bride being taken out of Christ I am that bride the Bobby said I am that Revival I'm waiting on somebody here to say I am that bride that day at Calvary I was a part of him before the foundation of the world I was a part of of him died with him raised with him brother bam said I was with Paul rever when he rode his midnight ride I was with George Washington when he crossed the Delaware well somebody said this is a fanatic talking he's hundreds of years old he didn't mean he was physically in the boat he didn't mean he was physically on the horse he said I am an American and therefore I'm identified with her her risings her fallings her Goods her bads I'm identified with her listen when you get a revelation that you are identified with Christ that you died with him you suffered with him you died with him you raised with with him it's it's it's it's something you can't understand in church anity you've got to be standing in the place where the rock was opened up thank God for Revelation thank God for the hole in the Rock Lord let me live there somebody ought to want to live there he said you're bury Colossians uh Romans 6:4 therefore we're buried by with him by baptism into death Colossians 2:12 buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who had raised him from the perspective of being in the same place where Christ was smitten we can see the glory we can't we won't just see past Glory we can begin to see present Glory we can begin to see future Glory if we if we remain cleaving come on hide oh God it's not the bosom of Abraham that I want to hide in I want to hide in the Cliff of the rock Rock of Ages that's what the song says Rock of Ages open up let me hide the world is wicked they Nash their teeth against the elect they mock your clothes they mock your style they mock your faith they bite and chew and devour and gossip and misund understand and judge and it gets so hard sometime that you can L keep your head above it but he opened up the rock he said come on children I've opened up my side do you remember where you came from he said come on back come back I've got a place by me that I want you to hide when the storm is Raging I don't want you to be drifting I want you to be anchored is it possible to play soft oh yes marabeth is there I love you brother Kate when the storms of life are raging Stand By Me Yes amen when what you once trusted is shaking and you you're no longer sure about what's what really is and what really isn't he said I've got a place not just Moses come on Daniel berer Billy TBO Brent brother Miller he said come on I've got a place by me this is why it's so important for us to see that we died with Christ once you stand in that vantage point and look at everything from that perspective nothing can defeat you there is no offense there is no bitterness there is no jealousy there's no envy that can live with you and in you for any period of time time if you choose to remain in the hole in the Clift of the Rock in the Smit in Christ it's Union with him on a level that only the true bride will ever be able to fully participate in because she was one with him from the beginning you don't have to know this message or the name William brandom to be saved amen you have to know the name Jesus you have to call on the name with sincerity of faith not just use it as a swear word but with all your heart Jesus have mercy on me and the Bible said whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but that doesn't make you an overcomer and the spirit of this age will toss you and torment you and harass you until the last but for that little bride there's a place in his side it's a revelation it's not a physical location it's a revelation hide in his side get back to the Rock let your anchor grip don't kiss and run cleave he said there in Deuteronomy those who who participated in that debauchery they die and the ones you don't kill the plague 24,000 the plague took out until one righteous man said I've taken all I can take here we are standing before the altar of the Lord it says all of Israel was weeping before the altar of the Lord and here comes an Israelite who had rode the back pew his whole life he had rode the back pew he had said let me see how far I can get away and still be identified as a Christian and here come a hor woman and in the midst of repentance in the midst of the whole nation weeping before the altar of the Lord he took her in his tent and lay with her and the righteous indignation of the Lord fell on one Phineas and he said I can't stand it anymore how you could continue to commit fornication in the very vicinity of the altar of the Lord and those who cleaved to me in that hour Moses said the ones who cleaved to the Lord they were they were pardoned and granted a life this is it I'm not intending to be a liar Exodus 34:5 and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there where in the place The Rock was smitten and proclaimed the Lord declared the name of the Lord the Lord declared the name of the Lord and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious you can't see him like that in church anity he becomes the judge in church anity he becomes someone that is feared not reverential fear terrifying paralyzing fear like some have feared the bishop fear man's religion produces fear but when the Lord came to Moses he proclaimed his own name and he said said the Lord the Lord God read this with me merciful and that's the glory it's the glory for you now to know that you were in Christ that your sins were nailed to the cross if you'll walk away from them and cling and cleave to the Rock You Will will not face the Wrath and Judgment of a righteous God he'll hide you in his side until the storm passes over there's a little bride in Union with him who seeing God merciful and gracious long put it back up for me would you aren't you glad let me tell you some of you folks have given him a fit he had to be longsuffering is there anybody here you're willing to say I'm one of them he had to be longsuffering or he' have thrown me out a long time ago he just kept drawing me back the Lord is merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant that's what you need a revelation of goodness and Truth Listen the rest of it I heard you're right keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children under the third and the fourth generation somebody said for what what in the world does that mean it means there's a way for God to separate you from the generational iniquity of your family your fathers he's got a place by him in his side that breaks the curse but it only works if you cleave if you cling if you drift your sin will Dash you and rock you and rip you until you really have no peace but in here where the rock is smitten stand with me rock of [Music] AES CL for for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which [Music] flow be for sin the double cure I know this is a different Tempo but it's all right safe from Wrath oh and make me [Music] pure oh let the water

over on the shoulder of the Lord and find everything that she has need of today if there be one who hasn't seen the godhead open their eyes anoint them with Isa that they might see the reality that Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new there's a new place to stand when you have that Revelation and may they never be satisfied until they stand there give my brothers courage Lord to lead their
