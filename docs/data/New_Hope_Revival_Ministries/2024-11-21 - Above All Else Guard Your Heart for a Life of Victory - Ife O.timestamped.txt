[0:00] perhaps the word of the Lord for where
[0:03] you are right now you're going to keep
[0:05] falling again and again and again you're
[0:10] going to have the wind knocked out of
[0:12] you again and again and again until you
[0:16] discover what's growing in your
[0:18] garden until you discover what's coming
[0:21] into your heart what you have allowed to
[0:26] grow in your inner man
[0:30] I if I were to ask you the question
[0:32] which is the most important part of who
[0:34] we are outer man or inner man of course
[0:38] it's the inner man because it's out of
[0:41] the inner man that everything else
[0:45] flows IT issues forth but I want you to
[0:49] know that even in a world gone wild even
[0:52] in Satan's Eden there is a place of
[0:56] safety there is a place of rest there is
[1:00] a place of pleasure and of delight and
[1:03] it is in Christ and it is only in Christ
[1:06] and it's not being in Christ in word
[1:09] only or or in in language that comes out
[1:12] of our mouth but it's really when the
[1:15] rubber meets the road that we can
[1:18] testify I'm so hidden in Christ that the
[1:22] waves are not going to take me out I'm
[1:25] I'm anchored to the Rock of Ages I'm
[1:29] planted myself in a place of rest in a
[1:32] place of pleasure in a place of delight
[1:36] so come what
[1:39] may I know who's I am you've just got to
[1:44] guard your heart and you can't guard it
[1:47] until you clean
[1:49] it you've got to discover what it is
[1:52] that's growing in your heart that's
[1:55] causing you not to be able to get over
[1:57] the wall well I need to pray more you
[2:02] do I need to read the Bible more you
[2:05] do I need to hear the message more you
[2:08] do but above all else you better put a
[2:12] Watchman on the wall of your
[2:15] heart because your mind will and
[2:18] emotions is where the enemy is going to
[2:20] fight you day in and day out it's not
[2:25] your enemy it's only the arena it's only
[2:29] the venue where the battle rages but
[2:32] blessed be the name of the Lord It's
[2:35] where the battle rages that the victory
[2:38] is born it's where the battle is Raging
[2:42] that Jesus the
[2:45] Victor can come and be
[2:50] Lord he wants to be Lord he wants to be
[2:54] your
[2:55] leader remember there is an overcoming
[2:58] bride that is being raised up in this
[3:01] hour it doesn't matter how many give up
[3:05] it doesn't matter how many lay down
[3:08] there's going to be
[3:10] some that refuse to give up because they
[3:15] have recognized by Revelation the reason
[3:19] why they were
[3:21] born most of the time we already have
[3:25] the leading of what we know we should do
[3:27] what we're supposed to do what God is
[3:30] expecting out of us but we're hoping
[3:33] that someone might tell us something
[3:34] else so that we can lay our options out
[3:37] let me tell you something you don't have
[3:38] any options other than the perfect will
[3:41] of God for your life you were born for a
[3:44] purpose for a reason and that's the only
[3:47] option you
[3:50] have Above All
[3:54] Else guard your heart because it's out
[3:57] of your heart that your life happens am
