[39:20] to every family does i know that
[39:23] but i just said lord you suffered
[39:26] you paid the price
[39:29] you suffered enough for rose tebow
[39:32] she shouldn't have to suffer any longer
[39:34] and i'm asking you to show her mercy
[39:38] not too long after that she closed her
[39:40] eyes and brother billy said she only
[39:42] opened them one other time the rest of
[39:44] the day the afternoon and into the
[39:46] evening
[39:47] and the lord was just taking her home
[39:50] i didn't say it's a vision
[39:53] certainly wasn't a dream i was wide
[39:55] awake but about 5 40 this morning i had
[39:58] an image
[40:00] my mind has an eye and so does yours
[40:03] this was about an hour after she had
[40:05] crossed
[40:06] i checked my phone at 4 15
[40:09] to see if there was any news and it was
[40:12] just a little bit after that actually
[40:14] that she passed
[40:15] but
[40:16] about an hour later i'm laying there in
[40:18] bed and i am just meditating on the lord
[40:22] my flesh feeling a little bit sad but my
[40:25] heart just happy just rejoicing and in
[40:28] my mind's eye
[40:29] i had a an image let's just say it that
[40:32] way and i saw
[40:34] a papa tebow
[40:36] in my mind's eye i saw brother sister
[40:38] tremaine
[40:39] in my mind's eye
[40:41] so brother skipworth
[40:43] in my mind's eye and brother and sister
[40:45] heist
[40:46] and they were making their way
[40:48] gathered together and they were making
[40:50] their way in
[40:51] a certain direction
[40:52] i didn't see the rest
[40:54] it was just my mind's eye
[40:56] but all the thought of a reunion like
[40:59] that
[41:00] and many others i don't mean to leave
[41:02] anybody out
[41:05] but they are gathered together
[41:06] hallelujah
[41:08] reunited
[41:10] sister tebo didn't much want to live
[41:12] after brother tebow was gone
[41:15] but god was gracious to her and good to
[41:17] her and he helped her and we thought
[41:19] that we would have her for years longer
[41:23] but god had a different plan
[41:25] i think that
[41:27] i'm happy about a lot of different
[41:29] things that come to my mind this morning
[41:30] but one is god loved her so much that he
[41:34] gave her a brand new place to live
[41:37] the last little bit does do you know how
[41:39] long she lived there
[41:41] i don't know
[41:42] say that again
[41:43] a little less than a year maybe she had
[41:46] a brand new home brand new furniture
[41:49] just given to her
[41:51] and she lived in that and she enjoyed it
[41:54] so much and i loved the look on her face
[41:57] when she hosted us there
[42:00] it was it was fancier than she'd ever
[42:02] known in her life
[42:04] and god gave her that but i want you to
[42:06] know it doesn't even begin to prepare uh
[42:09] compare excuse me it doesn't even begin
[42:11] to compare with what she has now
[42:14] and what she will have for all eternity
[42:17] so please remember brother billy and the
[42:19] family here at our church
[42:21] and let's remember also the rest of the
[42:24] family that god will comfort them
[42:27] and minister to them and speak to their
[42:29] hearts in this time and draw them really
[42:32] close
[42:33] there are no final arrangements because
[42:35] her passing has just happened but
[42:37] tentatively the the family is going this
[42:40] afternoon to make arrangements and it
[42:42] looks perhaps that her viewing would be
[42:45] on thursday evening uh and her funeral
[42:48] here at the church on friday
[42:51] and they'll have to give us the times
[42:53] and so forth but her main desire
[42:57] when paul passed away
[42:59] brother tebo was that we celebrate
[43:03] the presence of the lord and that we
[43:05] that we have church
[43:07] she said that's what bill would have
[43:09] wanted and that's what i wanted and we
[43:11] did
[43:13] we did have a time
[43:14] a real wonderful presence of the lord
[43:17] was here
[43:18] and let's believe that god i don't know
[43:20] how many will be able to gather with us
[43:21] but let's believe that god will come i
[43:24] don't know if you remember remembered or
[43:25] not but when the announcement came of
[43:27] her sickness and she was in church that
[43:29] first morning she said i want you to
[43:31] sing my theophany for me brother shelly
[43:34] now that don't really sound like
[43:36] somebody that's looking for a healing
[43:38] down here
[43:40] it looked to me like somebody that was
[43:42] already looking for a new body and she
[43:45] went around this church didn't she
[43:47] praising god and giving god glory
[43:49] hallelujah
[43:51] and so she would want us to celebrate
[43:54] but i didn't know benjamin was going to
[43:56] sing that song but i i think that was
[43:58] very appropriate i've never been this
[44:00] homesick before and i know there are
[44:03] hearts here this morning that feel that
[44:04] way let's stand and go to the lord in
[44:07] prayer
[44:09] r.j has a little sickness that he's
[44:12] fighting with a low-grade fever we want
[44:14] to hold him up to the lord sister
[44:16] nakisha reached out this morning to say
[44:18] that she was in a lot of pain and wanted
[44:20] to be remembered and sister audrey is
[44:23] coming home from jamaica this week
[44:26] and needs traveling grace to be able to
[44:28] make a safe trip home without any
[44:30] complication so we're asking god to do
[44:33] that
[44:34] many had hands that went up in this room
[44:37] and said i have a need well i want you
[44:38] to know we know the need meter
[44:41] we know the one who is more than able
[44:43] and i believe him this morning don't you
[44:45] let's sing have faith in god
[44:49] that's where our faith is
[44:52] our faith is not in faith
[44:55] our faith is in god
[44:58] let me hear the key

[1:03:59] like there was no media 30 years ago
[1:04:02] but there was media 30 years ago
[1:04:04] thousands of cassette tapes went out of
[1:04:07] the church of columbus thousands not not
[1:04:10] hundreds thousands
[1:04:12] boxes full across the world
[1:04:15] and there was a precious family that was
[1:04:18] coming to visit us during those days the
[1:04:20] boulevard family they were living in
[1:04:22] mobile
[1:04:24] and the young people they were young and
[1:04:26] some of them coming up to a marrying age
[1:04:29] and uh they would come up to the service
[1:04:32] four hour drive
[1:04:34] from mobile
[1:04:35] and one of those young men dorell
[1:04:38] uh had a videotape of a service that we
[1:04:41] had had there in columbus this was this
[1:04:44] was
[1:04:45] early 90s
[1:04:47] and passed it to billy there's you you
[1:04:50] some of you know the story
[1:04:52] and they saw the video he passed it to
[1:04:54] his mom
[1:04:55] and she watched that video and in that
[1:04:57] service the lord called her he called
[1:04:59] her through that video
[1:05:02] and
[1:05:03] excuse me
[1:05:04] and they came
[1:05:06] and god ministered to her called her out
[1:05:09] minister to her brother tebo wasn't with
[1:05:12] her but god read his mail
[1:05:15] he'd been sneaking around
[1:05:17] on doing some things that he was keeping
[1:05:19] from rose
[1:05:20] but the holy ghost told on him
[1:05:23] and she went home and said there's no
[1:05:24] need to lie
[1:05:29] it's out
[1:05:31] and you know god so changed her life she
[1:05:33] was dolled up
[1:05:35] oh
[1:05:36] she was dolled up
[1:05:38] made up little short dress on like
[1:05:41] anyway don't matter what it was like
[1:05:44] a little short dress on
[1:05:46] curled up colored hair
[1:05:51] god really reached down
[1:05:54] her son-in-law paid her a an amazing
[1:05:57] compliment yesterday
[1:05:59] he said you know way back then brother
[1:06:01] shelly
[1:06:03] mom wasn't serving the lord
[1:06:05] but he said she had the the most unusual
[1:06:08] sense of right and wrong
[1:06:10] of anybody i'd ever met
[1:06:12] because she had been touched by
[1:06:14] pentecost as a child
[1:06:17] now i don't know if you know some of the
[1:06:19] suffering that she went through in her
[1:06:20] life but she saw a lot of hurt and a lot
[1:06:22] of pain
[1:06:23] she saw suicide she saw
[1:06:26] abuse she was abused herself
[1:06:29] family members
[1:06:31] she went through a lot
[1:06:33] god so graciously reached out and
[1:06:35] delivered and saved her and we were
[1:06:37] singing that that service he didn't
[1:06:40] throw the clay away
[1:06:42] and she said i'm so glad that he didn't
[1:06:44] throw me away hallelujah
[1:06:46] but he reached down to mississippi on a
[1:06:48] videotape vcr
[1:06:52] anybody
[1:06:53] know what that is
[1:06:56] anyway i'm reminiscing like an old man
[1:07:08] my precious friend sister craighead
[1:07:10] wrote this song
[1:07:12] and she was a fiery little lady
[1:07:14] i've told you that before when the holy
[1:07:16] ghost would fall she would get excited
[1:07:19] and she would kick her leg
[1:07:21] and they criticized her because they
[1:07:23] told her that wasn't ladylike
[1:07:25] and she was dressed a whole lot more uh
[1:07:28] modest than people dressed today so you
[1:07:30] didn't see anything but she'd be singing
[1:07:32] and she'd say
[1:07:34] and she'd kick her leg out while she was
[1:07:36] singing i'll never forget it all right

[1:14:02] mobile uh why do i always say it a
[1:14:04] travel trailer
[1:14:06] do they have a better word for them now
[1:14:08] do they say rvs or something

[1:14:12] that
[1:14:13] that's a lot of miles to make
[1:14:15] and i know everybody i want you all to
[1:14:17] know that last night we had a geyser
[1:14:20] it looked like old faithful
[1:14:22] over there behind the church just
[1:14:24] shooting up over
[1:14:26] i i there's no way to tell you what that
[1:14:28] is like to someone who don't know how to
[1:14:30] repair when you when i see something
[1:14:33] like that i can't tell you how i feel
[1:14:35] brother robert wanted me to know what
[1:14:37] was happening i appreciated that so much
[1:14:39] he wanted me to know that somebody was
[1:14:41] dispatched and sister alfreda had
[1:14:43] reported it and
[1:14:44] we need to get it off as soon as
[1:14:46] possible because whether you believe it
[1:14:48] or not hundreds of dollars get shot up
[1:14:50] in the air like that
[1:14:52] and we had a we had a power bill one
[1:14:54] time i mean a water bill one time nearly
[1:14:56] a thousand dollars
[1:14:58] because of a big leak like that so we're
[1:15:00] asking the lord for grace and mercy but
[1:15:02] i want you to know these brothers came
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:05] and i don't i don't know who all was
[1:15:07] there because they were already moving
[1:15:09] some of them had already gone away when
[1:15:11] i got to it but i i know josh and nathan
[1:15:14] and austin and josiah was in the ditch
[1:15:17] and brother todd was in the ditch and
[1:15:19] who else helped me so i don't
[1:15:22] did i say luke did i say luke already
[1:15:24] lukyovic
[1:15:25] and and i don't know who all else
[1:15:28] but it my heart just went out to him
[1:15:31] muddy
[1:15:33] muddy and raining on them that was a
[1:15:34] blessing they said a blessing it was it
[1:15:37] was going to rain that was a good time
[1:15:38] to rain i don't know if that's true or
[1:15:39] not
[1:15:41] their mud was up to below their knee
[1:15:43] they
[1:15:44] oh my goodness i had to move my mat
[1:15:46] today to my coming in matt because it
[1:15:48] was muddy and i didn't want to see that
[1:15:50] tracked in the church and i told my wife
[1:15:52] to watch and make sure the kids didn't
[1:15:54] track it in but we can't help it brother
[1:15:57] skipworth is in heaven but he just did
[1:15:59] not like our red mud over here
[1:16:02] and uh now we've got these uh idaho
[1:16:04] people and they've never seen red dirt
[1:16:06] like that probably and they didn't see
[1:16:08] it in idaho anyway
[1:16:10] and uh but god helped these brothers and
[1:16:12] they worked so hard
[1:16:14] and they're tired they worked all week
[1:16:16] and these things just weighed on my mind
[1:16:19] and then it wouldn't hold
[1:16:21] and uh so i left her here about nine
[1:16:24] o'clock i was over here with some of the
[1:16:26] young folks and i went to leave about
[1:16:27] nine o'clock and i slipped around in
[1:16:29] front of my vehicle and i said lord
[1:16:32] you see these men
[1:16:34] these young brothers that's worked all
[1:16:36] week and how hard they've tried to
[1:16:37] please lord help us
[1:16:39] let this hold
[1:16:41] there was talk of having to go
[1:16:43] to get parts and luke said i might have
[1:16:46] it in my office and we might have time
[1:16:47] to get the home depot but this is this
[1:16:50] is already nine o'clock at night
[1:16:52] and i knew the campground needed water
[1:16:55] the folks that live here needed water
[1:16:57] and you'd need water this morning i said
[1:16:59] lord please i'm i'm just asking you
[1:17:01] please
[1:17:02] help us help these poor brothers that
[1:17:04] have worked hard and let this last
[1:17:07] i don't know if they have to do
[1:17:09] something else to it but just let it
[1:17:11] hold for now
[1:17:12] and i'm so glad it has
[1:17:15] but i wanted to say to every one of you
[1:17:16] men thank you so much i i don't take it
[1:17:20] i said please bring your receipts
[1:17:22] we want to pay for that but i don't take
[1:17:24] that for granted i don't think that they
[1:17:26] have to
[1:17:28] i don't think that they're that that in
[1:17:30] in in the natural sense of the word that
[1:17:32] they're obligated to
[1:17:35] i think that they did it because they
[1:17:36] loved god and they loved the church and
[1:17:39] they wanted to ease the burden
[1:17:41] and you did and i want to thank you all
[1:17:43] for that so much and had i hadn't seen
[1:17:46] josiah in a while and i saw him in the
[1:17:48] hole working
[1:17:50] and that blessed me
[1:17:53] i know i'm a little bit of a wreck
[1:17:55] but i'm his wreck
[1:17:58] turn in your bible if you will to
[1:18:01] the book of luke i have so much to say
[1:18:04] today and i know you probably didn't
[1:18:05] want to hear that just now
[1:18:07] but i've got so much i need to say
[1:18:10] and i know i won't get it all said
[1:18:15] oh sister terry's
[1:18:17] mom what is her last name

[1:18:43] day they have off work and they're
[1:18:44] coming all the way here
[1:18:46] and uh
[1:18:48] prayer requests here from different ones
[1:18:51] god bless each one of you
[1:18:55] i really need the lord today
[1:18:58] i need to give you the second half of
[1:19:00] this
[1:19:02] we preached
[1:19:03] sunday and tuesday night on total
[1:19:05] deliverance requires total separation
[1:19:08] so we started on the total separation
[1:19:10] and today we're going to start on the
[1:19:12] total deliverance
[1:19:14] how many of you are interested in that
[1:19:17] i'm interested in that
[1:19:19] i need
[1:19:20] that luke chapter 4 verse 16
[1:19:24] and he came to nazareth where he had
[1:19:26] been brought up
[1:19:29] and as his custom was he went into the
[1:19:31] synagogue on the sabbath day
[1:19:34] and stood up for to read
[1:19:37] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:19:39] book of the prophet isaias and when he
[1:19:42] had opened the book he found the place
[1:19:44] where it was written now you all know
[1:19:46] there were no books
[1:19:49] the codex was not even in place this was
[1:19:51] a scroll
[1:19:53] our king james version
[1:19:55] speaks to us in terms of a book but it
[1:19:58] was a scroll
[1:19:59] it was the custom to read they were
[1:20:02] already this is second temple period
[1:20:04] they're already going through the torah
[1:20:06] schedule
[1:20:07] it might have looked a little different
[1:20:09] then that it looked now but they're
[1:20:10] going through it and so it was
[1:20:12] determined already what would be read on
[1:20:15] what particular sabbath
[1:20:17] you need not think it was a coincidence
[1:20:19] it was divine inspiration
[1:20:22] that had our lord there
[1:20:24] it's one of the only synagogues there's
[1:20:27] two that i know of in all of israel that
[1:20:29] have been discovered uncovered all the
[1:20:32] way to the to the foundation stones
[1:20:35] that would have been used in the second
[1:20:37] temple period so i've stood in nazareth
[1:20:40] and i've stood on those stones
[1:20:42] that this they know for sure this was
[1:20:46] the synagogue that jesus was standing in
[1:20:48] when he read this scroll
[1:20:51] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:20:54] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:20:57] the gospel the good news to the poor
[1:21:01] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:21:05] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:21:08] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:21:11] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:21:16] doesn't that sound a little strange
[1:21:20] don't you normally soothe someone with a
[1:21:23] bruise
[1:21:25] don't you usually maybe pray over that
[1:21:28] or put a little ointment on that or
[1:21:30] something some little essential oil or
[1:21:32] something but but jesus said to set them
[1:21:35] free
[1:21:36] amen to set at liberty them that are
[1:21:39] bruised
[1:21:40] he was talking about all of us
[1:21:43] who are bruised by life
[1:21:45] by stuff
[1:21:47] by situations
[1:21:49] and jesus came with a ministry mandate
[1:21:53] to set at liberty
[1:21:55] them that are bruised oh thank god for
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:00] to preach
[1:22:01] the acceptable
[1:22:03] year
[1:22:04] of the lord
[1:22:06] and he closed the book he gave it again
[1:22:08] to the minister and sat down and the
[1:22:11] eyes of all them that were in the
[1:22:13] synagogue were fastened
[1:22:16] on him
[1:22:17] i'd like for you to turn before you're
[1:22:20] seated to john chapter 8.
[1:22:23] if you're a senior and you need to save
[1:22:26] your legs please just go right ahead and
[1:22:28] sit down the rest of us
[1:22:30] will stand for you
[1:22:33] john chapter 8 verse 31-36
[1:22:37] then said jesus to those jews
[1:22:40] which believed on him
[1:22:43] if ye continue in
[1:22:46] my
[1:22:47] word
[1:22:49] then are ye my disciples
[1:22:54] indeed
[1:22:56] that word continue
[1:22:58] in greek means to abide
[1:23:02] in my word
[1:23:03] it reminds us this is john 8 but it
[1:23:06] reminds us of the words of our lord in
[1:23:09] john 15 where he's talking about i am
[1:23:12] the vine
[1:23:14] you are the branches if you abide in me
[1:23:18] and my word abides in you
[1:23:21] this is a this is a cooperation it is a
[1:23:24] drawing of life
[1:23:26] and if we remove ourselves from the vine
[1:23:29] we remove ourselves from the source of
[1:23:32] life so jesus is saying to the jew don't
[1:23:35] trust your jewishness
[1:23:37] if you want to be my disciple you've got
[1:23:39] to abide in my word you've got to stay
[1:23:43] there you don't visit it on rare
[1:23:45] occasion but you've got to draw from it
[1:23:48] every day of your life continue in it
[1:23:51] abide in it remain
[1:23:54] steadfastly in it
[1:23:56] then are you my disciples indeed
[1:23:59] and then he goes on and ye shall
[1:24:03] know
[1:24:04] the truth
[1:24:11] mary
[1:24:12] had never known a man
[1:24:15] it's the same root
[1:24:17] this is not hearing truth and and saying
[1:24:20] i have information
[1:24:22] this is becoming intimately acquainted
[1:24:26] with truth
[1:24:28] and truth is not a doctrine brethren
[1:24:30] truth is a person
[1:24:32] jesus said i am the way i am the truth i
[1:24:36] am the life so you shall know him as a
[1:24:39] person
[1:24:40] he is truth and he the truth shall
[1:24:46] make you free
[1:24:48] those nearly inspired versions like to
[1:24:51] say set you free
[1:24:53] for this
[1:24:55] but this says make you free
[1:24:58] which is a recreation
[1:25:01] how many of you have been recreated
[1:25:04] the old nature has died
[1:25:06] and a new nature your old spirit man has
[1:25:09] been renewed it has been regenerated
[1:25:13] by the infusion of his spirit life
[1:25:16] you're no longer that old creature you
[1:25:18] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:25:21] make you free make you free
[1:25:23] hallelujah i like it and then it goes on
[1:25:27] jesus answered them oh excuse me they
[1:25:30] answered him we be abraham's seed
[1:25:34] this is religion talking
[1:25:36] we slept with the prophet
[1:25:39] we hunted with the prophet
[1:25:42] we got a belt buckle like the prophet
[1:25:46] we have cowboy hats like the prophet and
[1:25:48] we wear boots like the prophet oh that's
[1:25:50] not enough
[1:25:52] being being familiar with the prophet is
[1:25:54] not what it takes being abraham's seed
[1:25:57] is not what it takes
[1:25:59] they said we're never in bondage to any
[1:26:01] man how sayest thou ye shall be made
[1:26:03] free
[1:26:04] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[1:26:07] unto you whosoever committeth sin
[1:26:10] is the servant of sin
[1:26:13] what an answer and the servant of god is
[1:26:16] not in the house forever but the son
[1:26:18] abideth ever
[1:26:20] you got to know the difference church
[1:26:22] you've got to know the difference this
[1:26:24] morning between servant and son
[1:26:27] come on
[1:26:28] slave and son
[1:26:31] from slavery to sonship
[1:26:34] that's our journey
[1:26:35] do you believe that
[1:26:37] do we have another no that's it now
[1:26:39] let's let's look at 8 31 in the
[1:26:40] amplified
[1:26:42] father thank you for our time together
[1:26:45] in your word we ask you to bless
[1:26:48] us as we feast on it and lord help your
[1:26:52] servant to get out of the way and you
[1:26:54] deliver your word through me i pray
[1:26:56] beshem adonai yeshua hamashiach amen you
[1:27:00] may be seated 8 31 in the amplified
[1:27:05] said so jesus said to those jews
[1:27:08] who had believed in him
[1:27:11] if you abide in
[1:27:14] my word
[1:27:16] look at the brackets
[1:27:18] know that these are words added in the
[1:27:21] amplified to amplify the meaning of the
[1:27:24] phrase they're added by the translator
[1:27:27] hold fast
[1:27:29] i like them
[1:27:31] hold fast
[1:27:32] to my teachings
[1:27:34] and not just for information's sake only
[1:27:37] but live in accordance
[1:27:40] with them
[1:27:42] if you do that
[1:27:43] then you are not just my disciple in
[1:27:46] name only
[1:27:47] but you are truly
[1:27:49] my disciples how many of you want to
[1:27:52] truly be followers and disciples of the
[1:27:55] lord jesus christ in this hour then that
[1:27:58] must transpose into our everyday life
[1:28:01] it may it must not be our behavior on
[1:28:04] sunday and tuesday night it must be our
[1:28:07] everyday way of living abiding in the
[1:28:11] word are you with me
[1:28:13] thank you stay right there then isaiah
[1:28:15] 61
[1:28:17] and 1. i want to go back to the scroll
[1:28:19] of the prophet isaiah
[1:28:21] i want to read the portion
[1:28:23] to you that yeshua that jesus would have
[1:28:27] been reading that day
[1:28:29] it's it's it's quite a ceremony
[1:28:33] it's really something that
[1:28:35] that that's really beautiful to look at
[1:28:39] and uh if you if you
[1:28:42] well before you do that go to
[1:28:45] go to luke 4 20.
[1:28:48] i think we
[1:28:49] stopped without reading 20 and 21.
[1:28:52] he closed the book
[1:28:54] and he gave it again to the minister
[1:28:58] and sat down
[1:29:00] and the eyes of all them
[1:29:03] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:29:06] on him
[1:29:08] they recognized him as joseph's son
[1:29:12] they knew who he was
[1:29:14] they weren't expecting that
[1:29:16] this day he would take his reading all
[1:29:20] all jews
[1:29:22] in good standing in the synagogue we're
[1:29:24] invited to come and make aliyah
[1:29:28] it's the same word we use in modern
[1:29:30] hebrew
[1:29:32] to describe going home to israel
[1:29:35] when you see pictures of jews coming
[1:29:37] home from the ukraine and they're
[1:29:39] kissing the ground we say they are
[1:29:41] making aliyah
[1:29:42] it means they're coming up to jerusalem
[1:29:44] to live
[1:29:46] it's the same word that describes a
[1:29:48] person a jew coming up to the bema
[1:29:52] because in the synagogue
[1:29:54] this this desk is called the bema
[1:29:58] and it is a place of judgment
[1:30:02] it's the same word that's used for a
[1:30:04] judgment seat it's the table that holds
[1:30:07] the scroll
[1:30:09] and those of you who don't know this is
[1:30:11] a a complete torah scroll
[1:30:15] and it has the first five books of the
[1:30:17] bible in it
[1:30:19] but there were
[1:30:20] there were there were half torah scrolls
[1:30:23] and there there were scrolls from the
[1:30:25] different prophets
[1:30:27] and on this particular day it was the
[1:30:30] book of isaias that was to be read
[1:30:33] it was not an accident it was divine
[1:30:36] providence that brought our lord to the
[1:30:38] bhima
[1:30:39] making aliyah to the torah going up to
[1:30:42] the torah standing behind the bhima and
[1:30:45] reading and never to touch it remember
[1:30:48] he never would have touched the scroll
[1:30:50] the scroll would have been unrolled for
[1:30:52] him and he would have been handed a yod
[1:30:55] which is a which is a stick
[1:30:58] very elaborate
[1:31:00] a little rod i guess is a better way of
[1:31:02] putting it and usually on the end of
[1:31:04] that rod is a silver finger
[1:31:08] and you use that
[1:31:09] to follow along well you don't go this
[1:31:11] way you're going this way
[1:31:14] you to hold your place as you're reading
[1:31:16] so here is
[1:31:18] the creator of all the universe
[1:31:20] think of it
[1:31:22] standing there behind this written
[1:31:24] record of the word
[1:31:26] and he's he's going along and it could
[1:31:28] have been anything in isaiah scroll
[1:31:31] but it happened to be the very words
[1:31:33] that prophesied his own mandated
[1:31:35] ministry
[1:31:36] oh hallelujah and he closed the book
[1:31:38] gave it to the minister and sat down and
[1:31:40] the eyes of all of them that were in the
[1:31:42] synagogue were fastened on him and
[1:31:43] listen to what he said he began to say
[1:31:45] unto them this is a no-no
[1:31:48] let me tell you he is breaking protocol
[1:31:51] he's doing something he's never done
[1:31:53] before and had probably never happened
[1:31:55] in that synagogue before
[1:31:57] he is not there for commentary he is not
[1:32:00] there for comment
[1:32:02] it is not his place to add to what has
[1:32:04] been read he's supposed to come follow
[1:32:06] along read those words and go and return
[1:32:09] to his seat and sit down
[1:32:11] but in that particular moment he could
[1:32:14] not contain himself
[1:32:16] and he prophesied and declared his own
[1:32:18] identity by saying this day
[1:32:21] this scripture
[1:32:25] is fulfilled
[1:32:27] in your ears
[1:32:28] now you go on to read that later and
[1:32:30] you'll find out this was a very
[1:32:32] mystifying statement they thought it was
[1:32:34] certainly out of order he had no
[1:32:35] business saying that but i want you to
[1:32:37] know no tour words had ever been spoken
[1:32:40] because here stood the person are you
[1:32:43] listening
[1:32:44] here stood the personification
[1:32:48] of the words that had just been read
[1:32:50] he could have just as easily said i am
[1:32:52] he
[1:32:54] i am the one
[1:32:56] this day
[1:32:57] this scripture
[1:32:59] fulfilled
[1:33:00] in your ears now isaiah 61 1
[1:33:03] this is the prophecy that our lord jesus
[1:33:07] was reading
[1:33:08] and
[1:33:09] fulfilling
[1:33:11] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[1:33:13] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:33:15] preach good tidings unto the meek
[1:33:17] he hath sent me slightly different in
[1:33:20] translation
[1:33:21] he hath sent me to bind up the
[1:33:23] brokenhearted
[1:33:25] to proclaim liberty i want to hear you
[1:33:27] say liberty
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:31] do you remember that one of the eagles
[1:33:32] that was coming to me
[1:33:36] do you remember his name was liberty
[1:33:45] and the mother was prayer
[1:33:48] the mother was carrying
[1:33:50] our prayers as we were praying on that
[1:33:52] mother eagle was carrying those prayers
[1:33:54] right to the throne
[1:33:56] while nursing her little ones
[1:33:59] and she introduced me i know it sounds
[1:34:01] strange to somebody
[1:34:03] but she introduced me to those
[1:34:09] it's very uh it's a little uncommon it
[1:34:12] happens
[1:34:13] but a brood of eagles is usually two to
[1:34:16] three but on a rare occasion four
[1:34:20] this mother had four
[1:34:24] i've had their name written down
[1:34:25] although i've never called all four of
[1:34:27] their names at one time but i feel
[1:34:29] impressed to do that the third one was
[1:34:31] liberty the fourth one was deliverance
[1:34:34] now you can check my notes
[1:34:37] i don't i know you wouldn't think that
[1:34:38] i'd make that up on the spot
[1:34:41] the fourth one was deliverance i don't
[1:34:42] think i've ever told it have i have if i
[1:34:44] did i didn't didn't remember it
[1:34:47] but the fourth eagle was deliverance
[1:34:50] and these eagles were being raised up
[1:34:52] they were being nurtured and fed by the
[1:34:53] mother and they were getting large large
[1:34:56] enough and i could tell as i would watch
[1:34:58] them growing in the spirit i could tell
[1:35:00] they were getting older and ready to fly
[1:35:04] and whether you realize it or not at
[1:35:06] election time
[1:35:08] there was a release of liberty
[1:35:12] somebody said i think it's the greatest
[1:35:13] travesty that's ever happened in our
[1:35:15] nation i tell you a lot of people don't
[1:35:17] understand what was unfolding in that
[1:35:19] hour
[1:35:20] but god is saying i have a higher
[1:35:22] concern
[1:35:24] i have a justice that's never going to
[1:35:26] be worked out on this earth
[1:35:28] until the king of kings and the prince
[1:35:30] of all kings and the prince of peace sir
[1:35:33] shalom comes and sets up his
[1:35:36] perfect order in the earth
[1:35:38] and so i am believing god to release
[1:35:41] that eagle of deliverance
[1:35:43] because i for one stand in need of total
[1:35:47] deliverance in my life
[1:35:49] and i believe it's available to us
[1:35:52] and i believe we need to contend for it
[1:35:54] don't you don't don't look don't let
[1:35:56] don't let your mind wander right now
[1:35:59] because i know i'm not the only one who
[1:36:01] needs to be free indeed
[1:36:03] free indeed right down to the very dna
[1:36:06] right down to the very cell the makeup
[1:36:08] of your cell on a cellular level i want
[1:36:11] to be deliverance i want to be
[1:36:12] deliverance i don't want to just have
[1:36:14] deliverance i want to be deliverance
[1:36:17] i want to exude deliverance
[1:36:20] and impart deliverance
[1:36:23] as i go forward to do god's will and i
[1:36:25] don't believe that's for preachers only
[1:36:28] to proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:36:32] that word is dorar
[1:36:34] it's similar to the word for word it's
[1:36:36] similar to the word for word but it's
[1:36:38] it's a word liberty it's it's from an
[1:36:40] unused root
[1:36:42] and it means freedom
[1:36:45] and it also means
[1:36:47] spontaneity of outflow
[1:36:51] now old faithful
[1:36:54] has no spontaneity of outflow
[1:36:58] o faithful
[1:37:00] has a mysterious schedule
[1:37:05] that you can set your watch by
[1:37:08] that's why she's called old faithful
[1:37:12] but this word liberty speaks of a
[1:37:14] spontaneous outflow
[1:37:18] it's talking about a flowing
[1:37:21] a free run
[1:37:27] my granny used to talk about letting a
[1:37:29] stall-fed calf
[1:37:31] out of the gate
[1:37:35] she said they pulled the little calves
[1:37:37] in the in the stall
[1:37:39] and they would feed them
[1:37:41] good things
[1:37:43] of course you know why
[1:37:46] feed them good things
[1:37:48] and they would miss their liberty they
[1:37:50] would miss their freedom
[1:37:53] to run in the pasture
[1:37:55] and she said oh when it come time to set
[1:37:58] them out of the gate to open up the gate
[1:38:00] and let them go she said literally
[1:38:02] you could watch them kick their heels up
[1:38:04] and their front heels and back hills
[1:38:06] would come together as they went jumping
[1:38:09] through almost like little lamb jumping
[1:38:11] through the pasture let out that's what
[1:38:13] liberty means
[1:38:15] it means recognizing that what has had
[1:38:18] you in bondage no longer you better hear
[1:38:20] me
[1:38:21] it no longer holds you in bondage
[1:38:24] you are now free
[1:38:29] and he whom the son sets free makes free
[1:38:33] is what
[1:38:35] free indeed that's total deliverance
[1:38:38] free indeed is total deliverance
[1:38:40] hallelujah
[1:38:42] so this word liberty it's a in fact it's
[1:38:44] it
[1:38:45] when when when uh
[1:38:46] when we hear this expression
[1:38:49] uh
[1:38:50] that jesus said in in luke 4 19 he said
[1:38:54] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:38:57] lord it means the year of the lord's
[1:39:00] free flowing favor
[1:39:03] let me say it again it means the year
[1:39:06] that the favor of the lord will flow
[1:39:09] freely how many of you want to be under
[1:39:12] the spout
[1:39:14] huh where the favor of the lord is
[1:39:17] flowing freely
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:20] this is also a word in hebrew that is
[1:39:24] used to explain
[1:39:26] the extraction of the resin of myrrh
[1:39:32] myrrh in the bible represents suffering
[1:39:37] as sister anita wrote us the song
[1:39:40] as a gift from god it's a mixture
[1:39:44] of suffering and blessing
[1:39:47] we're talking about esther's ointment
[1:39:49] we're talking about the bride's perfume
[1:39:53] who is this
[1:39:54] that i see coming out of the wilderness
[1:39:58] leaning on her beloved dress like a
[1:40:00] bride with her bridegroom
[1:40:03] her fragrance
[1:40:06] her amazing perfume is filling the air
[1:40:09] and she smells just like him
[1:40:12] and sister anita wrote that song as a
[1:40:15] mixture of suffering and blessing until
[1:40:17] we come out smelling like him
[1:40:20] the myrrh that was used in the ritual of
[1:40:22] purification and anointing for hadassah
[1:40:25] or esther in the bible
[1:40:28] it was sweet smelling ointment and also
[1:40:30] bitter bitter herb
[1:40:33] and the myrrh represents the bitterness
[1:40:35] of tears
[1:40:36] and this word liberty is the word that
[1:40:39] describes what happens
[1:40:42] when they take a notch
[1:40:44] in the shrub of the myrrh
[1:40:46] in the bark of the myrrh
[1:40:49] they take a notch
[1:40:50] and when they peel that notch out the
[1:40:54] resin the life
[1:40:56] the essential
[1:40:57] resin or gum
[1:40:59] of that tree begins to weep out
[1:41:03] and as it weeps out it's slow in
[1:41:06] beginning and it just barely begins to
[1:41:09] move down the tree but before long it is
[1:41:12] used to this pull of gravity that's
[1:41:15] working on it and it begins to spew
[1:41:18] down that tree and that is the word
[1:41:21] that's used for for shedding tears
[1:41:24] and it's the word for myrrh the word for
[1:41:26] bitterness
[1:41:27] it's the word that helps us to
[1:41:29] understand that when things are flowing
[1:41:32] freely it is the liberty of the lord it
[1:41:36] is the favor of the lord it is not god's
[1:41:38] will for you to be bound up in your
[1:41:40] praise
[1:41:42] it is not god's will for you to be
[1:41:44] clogged up in your amens
[1:41:48] somebody said what's an amen got to do
[1:41:50] with it you know what the power of an
[1:41:52] amen is
[1:41:53] you know what it means when you say amen
[1:41:56] you are accepting the blessing of the
[1:41:58] lord on shabbat when we call our
[1:42:01] children around the table to bless them
[1:42:04] we did it for many years
[1:42:07] we called our boys around laid hands on
[1:42:09] them may our father make you like
[1:42:12] manasseh like ephraim
[1:42:14] said to our girls may alba make you like
[1:42:17] rebecca and rachel and sarah of old
[1:42:21] then we would pray over the virtuous
[1:42:23] woman the mother of the house
[1:42:26] and even read the scripture about the
[1:42:28] godly man
[1:42:29] and when a blessing like that is
[1:42:31] pronounced
[1:42:32] if i should when our when our kids sing
[1:42:35] uh the blessing over the church may the
[1:42:37] lord bless you and keep you
[1:42:40] the the answer is always the same
[1:42:44] nobody ever says i don't want none of
[1:42:46] that
[1:42:48] the answer's what
[1:42:50] a man

[1:43:33] but i'm abiding in his word
[1:43:35] and by abiding in his word i am being
[1:43:38] made freedom
[1:43:41] my life is being changed and tuned
[1:43:44] and i have i've
[1:43:46] well i just might as well get this one
[1:43:48] out
[1:43:49] i wasn't going to tell this this isn't
[1:43:51] even in the notes
[1:43:52] because you've heard it so many times
[1:43:55] but i want to tell this somebody brother
[1:43:58] said i haven't
[1:43:59] maybe you have i don't know
[1:44:01] but once upon a time
[1:44:03] there was an old bear who was a part of
[1:44:07] a circus in germany
[1:44:09] and he traveled
[1:44:10] in an old old train
[1:44:12] you know that's how they traveled in
[1:44:14] those days with the circus in fact one
[1:44:16] of the most awful tragedies that ever
[1:44:18] took place in this area
[1:44:20] was a was a horrible wreck that took
[1:44:22] place i was reading it to some of you
[1:44:23] young brothers maybe zach one time
[1:44:25] because it was the anniversary of that
[1:44:27] terrible circus train and many people
[1:44:29] lost their lives and many animals lost
[1:44:31] their lives and there is a memorial
[1:44:34] downtown columbus that marks the spot
[1:44:36] where the train wrecked and where all of
[1:44:38] those people were killed that's how the
[1:44:40] train used to go and the cages were made
[1:44:43] uh like railroad cars and they had had
[1:44:46] the wheels and and you know what i mean
[1:44:48] underneath and and so this train
[1:44:51] traveled all over europe
[1:44:53] and in that in one of those
[1:44:56] cages was an old brown bear
[1:44:59] and it that that cages was 12 foot long
[1:45:05] and uh the everything about that bear
[1:45:08] took place in that little cage
[1:45:12] and so he spent all of his life
[1:45:14] from one end of that 12 foot to the
[1:45:16] other end of that 12 foot
[1:45:18] and i call that the 12 foot shuffle
[1:45:21] just back and forth and back and forth
[1:45:23] and back and forth oh people were
[1:45:25] it's not just in our era that people are
[1:45:28] cruel they were cruel back then
[1:45:31] and they liked to torment that bear and
[1:45:33] poke that bear and bring sticks and prod
[1:45:36] that bear
[1:45:37] that bear had a miserable life as it got
[1:45:40] older it get more angry about it
[1:45:43] they they even one time slipped in a uh
[1:45:46] some food to that old bear hamburger
[1:45:49] meat that had been laced with slivers of
[1:45:51] glass
[1:45:53] and that old bear ate that meat and it
[1:45:55] cut up his gums his tongue his cheeks
[1:45:59] until he walked back and forth filling
[1:46:01] up the floor
[1:46:02] of that 12-foot cage with bloody drool
[1:46:06] and walked around in that bloody drool
[1:46:08] for days
[1:46:10] until his gums healed up
[1:46:12] his whole existence was
[1:46:14] 12 foot forward and
[1:46:16] 12 foot backward and one day a wealthy
[1:46:18] man
[1:46:19] came along and he said i can't take this
[1:46:21] anymore
[1:46:22] he said that bear shouldn't have to live
[1:46:23] out the last years of his life in that
[1:46:25] kind of bondage oh hear this
[1:46:31] i've gone to church with bears like that
[1:46:35] i fellowshipped and loved people
[1:46:38] in the same condition that that old bear
[1:46:40] was in
[1:46:42] on a 12 foot shuffle 12 foot forward 12
[1:46:45] foot backward day in and day out no
[1:46:48] freedom no liberty
[1:46:51] no deliverance
[1:46:53] just going through the grind because
[1:46:55] there are no other options or
[1:46:57] alternatives
[1:46:58] well they were building a brand new
[1:47:00] fancy zoo in heidelberg germany
[1:47:02] and uh wealthy men had done this because
[1:47:05] they were tired of seeing so they they
[1:47:07] bought the bear
[1:47:09] you'd have thought they'd got a
[1:47:10] discounted price but oh they paid a big
[1:47:12] price
[1:47:13] to ransom that bear
[1:47:15] out of his slavery
[1:47:17] they come with a big truck and and they
[1:47:20] haul that uh
[1:47:22] they hauled that big cage and everything
[1:47:25] uh way away from where they were
[1:47:28] camping and they
[1:47:30] took it all the way to heidelberg this
[1:47:31] beautiful zoo now this was not a zoo
[1:47:34] like we think of it's more like modern
[1:47:37] zoos we see around today
[1:47:39] where they build these amazing
[1:47:40] environmental enclosures
[1:47:43] where they can roam around a little
[1:47:44] freer and they they don't
[1:47:46] you know they don't cross the they can't
[1:47:48] get out well on occasion they do but
[1:47:51] they don't usually get out
[1:47:53] but it's not cages you know when i was a
[1:47:55] little boy i used to go to the atlanta
[1:47:57] zoo and and visit the famous gorilla
[1:47:59] willy bee
[1:48:02] and willie b played with a with a uh uh
[1:48:05] with an american tourist or suitcase
[1:48:09] that was that was willie b's toy
[1:48:12] and willie b was in an iron cage with
[1:48:15] bars
[1:48:16] and glass around and kids for
[1:48:19] generations my mother saw saw willie b
[1:48:22] when she was young and and i saw
[1:48:25] and my children didn't get to see willie
[1:48:28] b but they saw the memorial to this
[1:48:30] famous gorilla that's there
[1:48:33] now if you go to the atlanta zoo the
[1:48:35] gorilla
[1:48:37] display is is one of the grandest in the
[1:48:40] world
[1:48:41] and they have such success because they
[1:48:43] no longer isolate those gorillas behind
[1:48:46] iron bars and glass but they built these
[1:48:48] amazing enclosures how many of you have
[1:48:50] seen them
[1:48:51] if i ever go to the zoo that's where you
[1:48:52] usually will find me watching those
[1:48:54] gorillas
[1:48:56] i'm amazed by the family structure of
[1:48:58] gorillas and how they treat one another
[1:49:00] and how they raise their children it's
[1:49:01] amazing to watch
[1:49:03] and they enjoy their life a whole lot
[1:49:04] better than they did when willie b was
[1:49:06] little
[1:49:07] and so we understand the benefit
[1:49:10] this was an amazing display
[1:49:12] and there was a there was a jitter brook
[1:49:15] that ran right down the middle of this
[1:49:17] enclosure for bears
[1:49:19] lots of green grass to roll around in
[1:49:23] and plenty of food to eat and none of it
[1:49:25] laced with with glass
[1:49:28] nobody standing there with a stick to
[1:49:30] poke or prod
[1:49:32] but it looked like heaven to a bear
[1:49:35] freedom to a bear
[1:49:38] and so they pulled the truck out into
[1:49:40] that open area into that open field
[1:49:43] and they opened up the end of that old
[1:49:45] iron cage
[1:49:47] that that bear had lived in so long 12
[1:49:49] foot forward
[1:49:50] 12 foot backward
[1:49:52] 12 foot forward 12 foot backward
[1:49:55] they raised up
[1:49:57] the end of that thing and they waited to
[1:49:59] see what would happen
[1:50:05] how many of you know what happened
[1:50:07] 12 foot forward
[1:50:09] twelve foot backward
[1:50:15] you dumb bear
[1:50:17] don't you know you're free
[1:50:22] don't you know that everything you've
[1:50:25] ever wanted as a bear is waiting on you
[1:50:27] just a few steps out of this cage
[1:50:30] don't you know that what you've longed
[1:50:32] for your entire life to be free to sit
[1:50:35] down when you want to sit down and get
[1:50:36] up when you want to get up and roam
[1:50:38] about roll in the grass and drink water
[1:50:40] from the stream and eat good food
[1:50:42] have fellowship with other bears you've
[1:50:44] been locked away in solitary confinement
[1:50:47] don't you see down there the hill don't
[1:50:49] you see those other bears they're ready
[1:50:52] to welcome you into their family and
[1:50:55] make you a part and your your your the
[1:50:57] end of your life will be great
[1:51:02] what did he do
[1:51:09] they said we don't understand this kind
[1:51:11] of behavior what's wrong with this bear
[1:51:13] maybe his brain has been affected
[1:51:16] so they begin to yell at the bear
[1:51:18] that was nothing to the bear he'd been
[1:51:20] yelled out every day of his life
[1:51:22] it meant nothing to him so the more they
[1:51:24] yelled and tried to rattle the cage and
[1:51:26] make noise to scare him out
[1:51:29] the more he just kept walking 12 foot
[1:51:31] forward 12 foot back or 12 foot forward
[1:51:33] 12 foot backwards
[1:51:35] and finally they said fire will do it
[1:51:38] and so they took a torch and lifted lit
[1:51:41] the rags on fire and they began to go
[1:51:43] out the end of that and they were able
[1:51:46] to prod that bear out of the cage with
[1:51:48] waving fire in his face like that and
[1:51:50] back him out of that and the truck pull
[1:51:53] that cage out of the way and they all
[1:51:55] draw back because they have no idea what
[1:51:58] this bear is going to do
[1:52:00] in his condition and they start getting
[1:52:03] over the hill there to observe what's
[1:52:04] going on how many of you know what the
[1:52:06] bear did
[1:52:08] without bars
[1:52:10] without confinement
[1:52:13] he just kept doing the same thing he'd
[1:52:14] always done 12 foot forward 12 foot
[1:52:18] backwards 12 foot forward
[1:52:20] no cage
[1:52:22] don't you understand little bride
[1:52:25] no bars
[1:52:28] no bondage
[1:52:30] he whom the son makes free
[1:52:33] is free indeed
[1:52:35] and why should we be satisfied
[1:52:40] with a 12-foot shuffle
[1:52:43] when the jubilee trumpet has sounded in
[1:52:47] our day hallelujah
[1:52:50] hallelujah
[1:52:53] freedom
[1:52:56] liberty
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:00] i can't promise you freedom in your
[1:53:02] rights
[1:53:03] in this nation but i can promise you
[1:53:06] freedom as a child of the most high
[1:53:10] god
[1:53:13] hallelujah
[1:53:18] i want you to turn to leviticus
[1:53:32] some of you know
[1:53:35] that i went across this nation with that
[1:53:36] message
[1:53:38] in the 90s
[1:53:41] i saw thousands
[1:53:43] of message people
[1:53:46] who had lived their life
[1:53:48] in another kind of slavery
[1:53:51] set free
[1:53:54] i hear from them now
[1:53:57] it seems like when i was going through
[1:53:59] so much here in my own church
[1:54:01] being a buffeted and oppressed every
[1:54:03] time i stood here
[1:54:04] god would see me he would see my
[1:54:07] my feelings he would see how low i was
[1:54:10] he would see how hard it was to come and
[1:54:12] do what i was called to do and he would
[1:54:14] let somebody from way back when reach
[1:54:17] out to me ain't god good
[1:54:22] they'd ride in they say brother shelly i
[1:54:24] was in that meeting
[1:54:26] 12 year old boy
[1:54:28] 15 year old boy
[1:54:31] just a few weeks ago a pastor
[1:54:33] reached out and said i don't know if i
[1:54:34] ever told you or not
[1:54:36] but i was just a young boy in that youth
[1:54:38] camp
[1:54:39] when you were preaching on the 12-foot
[1:54:41] shuffle
[1:54:42] and i realized that my life was that and
[1:54:44] so was everybody's around me
[1:54:47] i couldn't think of one single person i
[1:54:49] knew that was as free as you were
[1:54:51] preaching about and i was determined to
[1:54:53] be the first
[1:54:55] he said i was the first to hit the altar
[1:54:57] that night and god filled me with the
[1:54:59] holy ghost
[1:55:01] and he said i've been free ever since
[1:55:04] and pulling as many people as i can out
[1:55:06] of their cages and telling them you
[1:55:08] don't have to be bound
[1:55:10] the truth has come
[1:55:13] the trumpet has sounded
[1:55:15] it's the jubilee of jubilees
[1:55:18] we're there
[1:55:20] we're there
[1:55:21] leviticus 25.
[1:55:23] this is a message i wanted to bring last
[1:55:25] sunday
[1:55:26] and remember the spirit of the lord woke
[1:55:27] me that morning and said you can't you
[1:55:29] can't preach a total deliverance until
[1:55:32] you until you preach the prerequisite
[1:55:35] a total deliverance requires a total
[1:55:37] separation from unbelief
[1:55:40] i want it
[1:55:42] i don't want a smidge i don't want to
[1:55:44] smudge
[1:55:45] of unbelief in my life
[1:55:48] the only way i know to deal with that is
[1:55:49] stay in the word and stay in his
[1:55:51] presence
[1:55:52] stay in the word and stay in his
[1:55:54] presence
[1:55:55] stay in the word and stay in his
[1:55:56] presence i don't know any other way
[1:55:59] to deal with unbelief because it'll
[1:56:01] creep up into everybody's mind
[1:56:06] it doesn't matter what you know about
[1:56:08] death it doesn't matter what you know
[1:56:09] about god's sovereignty you lose a loved
[1:56:12] one there's still a thought that comes
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:17] i want it all gone
[1:56:19] verse 8 leviticus 25 and thou shalt
[1:56:22] number seven sabbaths
[1:56:24] of years unto thee
[1:56:26] seven times seven years forty-nine years
[1:56:28] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[1:56:30] years i'm still reading
[1:56:32] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[1:56:34] years shall be unto thee forty and nine
[1:56:37] years
[1:56:38] then shall then shalt thou cause the
[1:56:41] trumpet of the jubilee
[1:56:43] anybody like how that sounds
[1:56:46] the trumpet of the jubilee the sound
[1:56:49] on the tenth day of the seventh month
[1:56:52] in the day of atonement this is talking
[1:56:53] about the fall feast shall you make the
[1:56:56] trumpet sound
[1:56:58] throughout all your land i want to read
[1:57:00] to verse 13
[1:57:02] and ye shall hollow the 50th year
[1:57:05] not the month
[1:57:08] the year
[1:57:10] and ye shall hallow the 50th year and
[1:57:12] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[1:57:14] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[1:57:16] shall be a jubilee unto you
[1:57:18] and you shall return every man listen ye
[1:57:21] shall return every man unto
[1:57:24] his possession
[1:57:28] it's time to get your inheritance back
[1:57:31] anybody hear me
[1:57:32] and you shall return every man unto his
[1:57:34] family
[1:57:36] because some are indentured slaves
[1:57:40] they've been working out their solitary
[1:57:42] away from their family
[1:57:44] let's read on
[1:57:45] a jubilee shall that 50th year be unto
[1:57:48] you ye shall not sow neither reap that
[1:57:51] which groweth of itself in it nor gather
[1:57:54] the grapes in it of thy vine
[1:57:58] undressed
[1:57:59] for it is
[1:58:02] the jubilee
[1:58:04] it shall be holy unto you
[1:58:07] ye shall eat the increase thereof out of
[1:58:09] the field only what the field brings
[1:58:13] forth of itself
[1:58:16] and how many of you know there's always
[1:58:18] some little remnant that comes back
[1:58:20] it's been plowed under and it lay there
[1:58:22] and the seed rots and life begins to
[1:58:25] sprout and so there's something in the
[1:58:27] field but it's not plowed and it's not
[1:58:29] cultivated and it's not nourished not
[1:58:31] fertilized and not cared for not even
[1:58:34] watered except that which god provides
[1:58:37] and on that 50th year you're only
[1:58:39] allowed to go out and take that
[1:58:41] for your food
[1:58:44] all right let's read on
[1:58:46] in the year of this jubilee
[1:58:50] ye shall return every man
[1:58:53] unto his possession
[1:58:55] let's go down to verse 39 through 42.
[1:58:59] i know you're tired
[1:59:01] and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee
[1:59:03] be wax and poor
[1:59:06] and be sold unto thee
[1:59:08] thou shall not compel him to serve as a
[1:59:11] bond's servant but as a hired servant
[1:59:14] and as a sojourner he shall be with thee
[1:59:17] and shall serve thee unto the year
[1:59:21] of jubilee
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:23] and then shall he depart release debt
[1:59:25] free
[1:59:26] from thee
[1:59:28] both he and his children with him
[1:59:31] both he and his children with him
[1:59:33] both he and his children with him
[1:59:35] both he and his children with him
[1:59:38] and shall return unto his own family
[1:59:41] and unto the possession of his fathers
[1:59:45] shall he return
[1:59:47] for they are my servants
[1:59:48] which i brought forth out of the land of
[1:59:50] egypt they shall not be sold as bondsmen
[1:59:59] this word jubilee is the yobel
[2:00:03] it means a year of remission
[2:00:08] it is related to a root word that speaks
[2:00:11] about both the ram's horn
[2:00:17] which is shafar
[2:00:20] and also the silver trumpet
[2:00:24] and for those of you that don't know
[2:00:26] these silver trumpets were a gift to me
[2:00:28] from sister nancy
[2:00:31] in jerusalem
[2:00:33] she bought them with the only
[2:00:34] inheritance that she would ever receive
[2:00:37] from the death of her father
[2:00:39] and she wanted this church to have these
[2:00:42] silver trumpets and they were made
[2:00:44] by the very same man who is hired
[2:00:47] to make the silver trumpets for the
[2:00:49] restored temple
[2:00:51] and before he finished the second
[2:00:54] trumpet that he was working on for the
[2:00:56] restored temple he made these for us and
[2:00:59] they say at the bottom
[2:01:02] holiness unto the lord zechariah 14 20
[2:01:05] 21 holiness unto the lord and they're
[2:01:08] real silver and they're valuable and
[2:01:09] they're precious to me
[2:01:11] because every time i look up there i
[2:01:13] know that silver stands for what
[2:01:16] redemption
[2:01:18] brass is judgment silver's redemption
[2:01:21] and i know that what these represent
[2:01:23] is is the is the loosing of slaves
[2:01:27] they represent loosing the land from
[2:01:30] under its oppression and loosing the
[2:01:32] people from out for under their
[2:01:34] oppression
[2:01:35] and i'm telling you it sends a message
[2:01:37] to us even today
[2:01:40] i'll put this here so that you can see
[2:01:42] it and because i touched it it'll
[2:01:43] probably tarnish and have to be clean
[2:01:50] means you're of remission it means uh
[2:01:53] connected to the ram's horn the shofar
[2:01:55] but also directly connected with the
[2:01:57] sounding of the silver trumpet it also
[2:02:00] is a word jubilee is jovel and it means
[2:02:03] liberty and it means release
[2:02:06] hallelujah
[2:02:09] you know that there was a a 50-year
[2:02:11] jubilee did you know the same word
[2:02:13] 50 there is the word that we will we
[2:02:16] will be thinking about as we come into
[2:02:18] the next week
[2:02:20] shavuot
[2:02:22] pentecost
[2:02:24] the church celebrates
[2:02:26] pentecost sunday we're coming to the
[2:02:28] 50th day of the counting of the omer
[2:02:31] and we're about to celebrate
[2:02:33] both the giving of the law on mount
[2:02:36] sinai and the giving of the holy ghost
[2:02:38] and the birth of the church on the day
[2:02:40] of pentecost penti is 50.
[2:02:43] jubilee is 50. it comes from the same
[2:02:46] word how many of you know the true
[2:02:48] pentecost has given us our jubilee
[2:02:52] the true outpouring of the holy ghost
[2:02:54] has set us free
[2:02:56] you note takers notice this there are
[2:02:58] three things that are promised in the
[2:03:01] year of jubilee and it it grieves me to
[2:03:04] tell you this
[2:03:06] did you know that those scholars who
[2:03:08] look at the old testament
[2:03:11] and who studied jewish history from the
[2:03:13] writings
[2:03:14] of the sages and the eventual writing
[2:03:17] down of the oral tradition
[2:03:19] that we now call the mishnah
[2:03:22] it was oral tradition passed down from
[2:03:24] generation to generation it was recorded
[2:03:27] so many years ago
[2:03:29] and it tells sometimes the behind the
[2:03:32] scenes of what was going on
[2:03:35] we look at those
[2:03:37] and we look at the early writings
[2:03:40] of the men who lived in the second
[2:03:42] temple period
[2:03:44] josephus and also the targums
[2:03:47] which we have talked about many times
[2:03:49] before
[2:03:51] the targums were written in aramaic
[2:03:54] and they give a very interesting
[2:03:57] explanation of what was going on
[2:04:00] in everyday life
[2:04:02] when jesus was on the earth powerful
[2:04:05] powerful study tools
[2:04:08] and when we look at all of this
[2:04:10] we we understand that israel
[2:04:13] rarely
[2:04:15] ever
[2:04:16] celebrated a 50-year jubilee
[2:04:22] how sad
[2:04:24] when i read that it grieved me
[2:04:28] why because conditions were not just
[2:04:30] right and
[2:04:32] it didn't seem to be a convenient time
[2:04:35] and
[2:04:36] somebody was afraid there wouldn't be
[2:04:38] enough food and
[2:04:40] so many of their years were spent in
[2:04:42] bondage and slavery and
[2:04:44] and so historically we know that many
[2:04:48] many many times they missed their
[2:04:51] opportunity to celebrate their freedom
[2:04:56] from slavery 50 years
[2:04:59] and so many men and women who could have
[2:05:02] died free
[2:05:07] had they lived in that jubilee free
[2:05:11] for the rest of their life
[2:05:13] died in slavery
[2:05:15] because israel did not take the
[2:05:18] initiative
[2:05:19] to declare the jubilee
[2:05:22] it's terrible isn't it
[2:05:24] something so carefully covered in the
[2:05:26] scripture did you know brother adam
[2:05:27] talks about the jubilee
[2:05:29] over and over and over and over he names
[2:05:32] sermons after it he he carries this
[2:05:34] subject he even talks about the priest
[2:05:38] who went forth blowing the trumpets
[2:05:41] sounding the alarm
[2:05:44] we'll get to that in just a minute
[2:05:46] there are three things you need to know
[2:05:47] about the jubilee year number one as in
[2:05:50] the sabbath year the land was to remain
[2:05:53] fallow
[2:05:56] nothing in it
[2:05:58] nothing planted
[2:06:00] nothing tilled nothing sown the people
[2:06:03] were not to farm the land but were to
[2:06:05] eat what grew naturally
[2:06:07] both people and the land could enjoy
[2:06:10] their year of remission or their year of
[2:06:13] release the year of jubilee are you
[2:06:16] still there
[2:06:17] secondly and more importantly every he
[2:06:20] brew slave was set free
[2:06:30] thirdly
[2:06:32] the land reverted
[2:06:34] to its original owner
[2:06:39] what a time to claim your family
[2:06:41] inheritance
[2:06:44] hard times required that land be sold
[2:06:48] family farms sold
[2:06:51] you've heard these stories even in our
[2:06:54] own land our own nation
[2:06:56] how family ranches and family land and
[2:06:59] and how some squandered away
[2:07:03] and thousands of acres of fertile land
[2:07:06] lost
[2:07:07] from family inheritances
[2:07:09] belonging to strangers but oh friend in
[2:07:12] that 50th year of jubilee
[2:07:16] all the land that had been sold to other
[2:07:20] families
[2:07:21] it had to go back to the original owner
[2:07:23] because jubilee was a divine reset do
[2:07:27] you hear what i'm saying it was god
[2:07:29] saying we're going to pull this back
[2:07:32] and this was to guarantee that no
[2:07:34] citizen would remain poor forever
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:40] i like that
[2:07:43] the poverty mindset had to end
[2:07:46] because
[2:07:47] the jubilee
[2:07:49] returned the inheritance of the family
[2:07:53] it guaranteed that no one no citizen of
[2:07:56] israel would have to remain poor for the
[2:07:58] rest of their life and it guaranteed
[2:08:00] that no citizen would remain a slave
[2:08:03] forever
[2:08:05] as long as their life fell around that
[2:08:07] jubilee it didn't matter if they'd been
[2:08:08] a slave 10 years or 40 years
[2:08:11] as long as their their their term of
[2:08:13] slavery fell around that jubilee year
[2:08:15] from that moment on
[2:08:19] you remember this
[2:08:23] no matter what they were doing
[2:08:27] no matter what they were doing
[2:08:30] they'd been doing it all their lives
[2:08:32] no matter what they were doing
[2:08:34] when that trumpet sounded
[2:08:42] don't laugh
[2:08:43] that's the best i got
[2:08:46] didn't matter what they were doing when
[2:08:48] that jubilee trumpet sounded it was done
[2:08:55] they could have been hoeing in the
[2:08:56] middle of a row
[2:09:00] oh
[2:09:01] sir i'm not gonna hold your taters
[2:09:04] anymore
[2:09:06] because i'm free
[2:09:08] are you with me
[2:09:10] no no no no don't call us don't don't
[2:09:12] call the ambulance i'm all right i did
[2:09:14] not fall
[2:09:19] it vibrates sos until i tell it not to
[2:09:22] i want you to go to the message
[2:09:24] returning jubilee i i don't seem to have
[2:09:28] the real what i want to deliver this
[2:09:30] this morning so i know you're worn out
[2:09:32] already but would you just put a little
[2:09:33] prayer in this right now and just ask
[2:09:35] the lord to help me deliver this i just
[2:09:38] want to scream it that's my problem i
[2:09:40] want to scream it i can't get it out
[2:09:42] fast enough i just want to stand there
[2:09:44] and scream it i want to tell everybody
[2:09:46] here you have no excuse
[2:09:48] i want you to know all your excuses have
[2:09:50] been removed
[2:09:51] i want you to know the jubilee trumpet
[2:09:53] has sounded
[2:09:56] hallelujah the message that we were
[2:09:58] waiting on has come
[2:10:01] we don't have to keep living on a
[2:10:04] 12-foot shuffle
[2:10:06] we've just got to get our eyes off of us
[2:10:11] and get them on him
[2:10:13] the perfect lamb has been slain the
[2:10:16] prize has been paid
[2:10:19] and redemption has been secured for his
[2:10:23] bride in this hour hallelujah
[2:10:26] no more reason to be slaves
[2:10:30] no more reason to be slaves
[2:10:32] [Applause]
[2:10:33] [Music]
[2:10:34] you can drop your hoe
[2:10:40] paragraph 52
[2:10:43] now a man in his family
[2:10:46] now a man and his family
[2:10:49] now a man and his family
[2:10:54] it gets me
[2:10:57] when i hear it it gets listen
[2:11:00] the first time when you mention this
[2:11:02] message i preached years ago drop your
[2:11:03] hoe its deliverance
[2:11:06] when i preached that message many years
[2:11:07] ago i didn't have a family i didn't have
[2:11:10] a wife
[2:11:12] i didn't have children but it got me
[2:11:14] there
[2:11:15] even then it got me
[2:11:17] even then it gripped my heart
[2:11:19] because i knew it was a promise
[2:11:22] not only for you but for your children
[2:11:24] and your children's children they don't
[2:11:27] have to live their life in bondage
[2:11:30] they don't have to serve slavery of sin
[2:11:33] there's a way out
[2:11:35] and it's not about what you do it's
[2:11:38] about what you hear
[2:11:39] it's about what you believe
[2:11:41] it's about what you receive it's about
[2:11:44] what you confess
[2:11:46] it's not about how you perform
[2:11:52] the striving of the church ages is over
[2:11:56] we're not under that striving anymore
[2:11:59] somebody said what about holiness it
[2:12:01] must be
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:04] it must be
[2:12:07] but it's not legislated
[2:12:10] it's the holy spirit of god
[2:12:12] separating his people as they separate
[2:12:15] themselves from all unbelief
[2:12:17] you recognize that to be like him you
[2:12:20] can't be like the world
[2:12:22] so you start pulling away
[2:12:24] nobody had nobody should have to measure
[2:12:26] your skirt
[2:12:28] nobody should have to tell you all of
[2:12:30] these details you should know in your
[2:12:32] heart by now the only way to be
[2:12:34] separated from unbelief is to pull
[2:12:36] yourself away from the fads and the
[2:12:39] fashion and the routine of this whole
[2:12:41] world and live a different life
[2:12:46] that means get you a wife and stay with
[2:12:48] her
[2:12:51] it means so many things
[2:12:54] that should not have to be
[2:12:56] written down in some kind of church
[2:12:58] covenant
[2:13:00] it should be written on the fleshy
[2:13:01] tables of your heart i want him i want
[2:13:05] him i want to hear him say your mind i
[2:13:09] want to hear him say well done
[2:13:11] [Applause]
[2:13:13] and because we want him
[2:13:15] and we want his favor and we want his
[2:13:18] blessing no price
[2:13:21] it's too high
[2:13:23] no price is too great to pay
[2:13:26] anybody with me
[2:13:27] the church ages produced striving
[2:13:31] but once that jubilee trumpet
[2:13:34] sounds
[2:13:35] you get out from under that that's why i
[2:13:36] find that so odd that some of our
[2:13:39] messianic friends
[2:13:41] now have this idea
[2:13:43] that beyond the church ages we go back
[2:13:46] into more restriction
[2:13:48] when the truth is beyond the church ages
[2:13:51] we're already practicing the powers of
[2:13:53] the age to come
[2:13:55] we're not looking back
[2:13:59] do you know why israel never got around
[2:14:01] to practicing too many years of jubilee
[2:14:04] because it wasn't just for natural
[2:14:06] israel
[2:14:10] hallelujah amen
[2:14:13] it was for those who would be neither
[2:14:15] jew nor greek
[2:14:17] they would be of another seed altogether
[2:14:20] another race saul together
[2:14:22] yes
[2:14:24] a new race a word come to redeem a new
[2:14:28] race that's right
[2:14:30] it's not a black race or a white race
[2:14:33] indian race or a gentile race or a
[2:14:36] jewish ray no no
[2:14:38] it's a new man it's a super race of
[2:14:40] people
[2:14:41] it's those who god had on his mind
[2:14:43] before the foundation of the world i
[2:14:45] know some of you may be streaming this
[2:14:47] and that may choke you but i just tell
[2:14:49] you if you can only have a heart to
[2:14:51] believe it
[2:14:52] if you can only have a year to hear the
[2:14:54] trumpet it'll sound in your life
[2:14:57] and if not you'll have no other choice
[2:14:58] but to go right back to the 12-foot
[2:15:00] shuffle
[2:15:04] because that's all religion can produce
[2:15:07] following the rules doing all the good
[2:15:08] stuff you're supposed to do and yet
[2:15:10] you'll just be a miserable wreck
[2:15:13] going from one end of the cage to the
[2:15:15] other end of the cage there's no liberty
[2:15:16] in that there's no freedom in that i
[2:15:19] know when the church talks about liberty
[2:15:20] i know when the church talks about being
[2:15:23] having liberty being set free i know
[2:15:25] what they mean
[2:15:27] they mean having no holiness
[2:15:29] they mean having no standard of living
[2:15:31] they mean doing just what the world
[2:15:33] dressing like the world talking like the
[2:15:34] world living like the world that's not
[2:15:37] what i'm talking about
[2:15:38] i'm talking about leaving the religious
[2:15:40] struggles and striving of what the flesh
[2:15:44] it's really it's really this this
[2:15:46] ishmael thing
[2:15:48] as we spoke about it tuesday night
[2:15:50] ishmael was a product of sarah's mind
[2:15:54] and abraham's loins
[2:15:56] that made him mixed
[2:15:59] that made his origin of of a little iffy
[2:16:01] nature
[2:16:03] sarah had an idea and of course abraham
[2:16:05] being a man had no problem with it
[2:16:09] so sarah had an idea abraham had the
[2:16:11] loins
[2:16:12] and an ishmael was born
[2:16:15] and there was no problem i'm telling you
[2:16:16] abraham loved him
[2:16:18] abraham loved this boy i i caught a
[2:16:20] vision of it one time years ago when god
[2:16:22] first made this message real to me i
[2:16:24] caught a vision of it and i saw i saw
[2:16:27] abraham i saw ishmael i saw abraham's
[2:16:30] arm around ishmael as he taught him the
[2:16:33] things of the god of israel i saw him as
[2:16:37] he began to try to teach him in the way
[2:16:39] and love him
[2:16:42] i saw him share in this in this vision i
[2:16:45] saw him share a little lunch
[2:16:48] with ishmael and they took a bite
[2:16:51] out of the same piece of bread
[2:16:54] abraham took a bite of that bread and he
[2:16:56] handed that bread to ishmael and ishmael
[2:16:58] looked at him looked up at him like he
[2:17:00] was the greatest thing in all the world
[2:17:01] my daddy my papa my abba
[2:17:04] and he took a bite of the bread that
[2:17:06] abraham had handed it to to him and i
[2:17:08] said lord why are you showing me this he
[2:17:10] said i want you to know how much abraham
[2:17:12] cared for ishmael
[2:17:13] and how much ishmael cared for abraham
[2:17:16] everything was fine they grew along
[2:17:18] together and the next thing you know
[2:17:19] it's time for isaac to be announced
[2:17:22] he's born god's performed the miracle
[2:17:24] and he's brought out it's a coming out
[2:17:26] it's an announcement and in the back of
[2:17:28] the crowd is hagar the bonds woman with
[2:17:31] her son ishmael standing beside her
[2:17:35] and sarah has had a hard time through
[2:17:38] this whole process it was her idea but i
[2:17:40] want you to know just because it works
[2:17:41] in your head doesn't mean it always
[2:17:43] works in practicality
[2:17:46] you know i preached this uh years ago i
[2:17:48] found inspiration from another preacher
[2:17:50] who was preaching on a little bit
[2:17:52] and then god gave me the inspiration of
[2:17:54] a visionary experience that kind of
[2:17:56] helped me understand because there was
[2:17:58] nothing i heard that caused me to feel
[2:18:00] that it was much of a sacrifice for
[2:18:02] abraham but when i had that experience
[2:18:04] and i saw that exchange of bread i saw
[2:18:07] abraham's arm around ishmael i knew how
[2:18:09] much he loved him
[2:18:11] and now what a hard thing it was for him
[2:18:14] to have to get rid of ishmael and send
[2:18:16] him into the wilderness
[2:18:17] perhaps to die
[2:18:21] it's kind of an amazing thing
[2:18:23] when i was dramatizing that a little bit
[2:18:25] under inspiration of some things i'd
[2:18:27] heard
[2:18:28] i i brought it out like this if you
[2:18:29] remember
[2:18:32] i said you know here is sarah unpregnant
[2:18:35] she
[2:18:36] she's yet barren and she's had this idea
[2:18:40] and hagar the bonds woman is now
[2:18:41] pregnant
[2:18:43] and all of a sudden the step gets fixed
[2:18:49] if you follow me
[2:18:51] the step gets fixed
[2:18:52] here's abraham down with his hammer nail
[2:18:55] fixing the step
[2:18:57] and sarah walks by
[2:18:59] hmm
[2:19:01] you wouldn't fix it for me
[2:19:04] i don't know how many times i asked you
[2:19:06] to fix that step but you just let hagar
[2:19:08] get pregnant whose idea was it sarah
[2:19:12] it was her idea but when she had to live
[2:19:14] with it
[2:19:17] when her idea was birthed
[2:19:21] and began to walk around her home
[2:19:23] and she had to face that every day
[2:19:26] hagar's big belly
[2:19:29] it was harder
[2:19:33] all of a sudden the garden was tended in
[2:19:34] a way that hadn't been tended in a long
[2:19:36] time
[2:19:37] and sarah saw it and
[2:19:39] and she said who did that abraham said
[2:19:41] well i was doing it i wanted to make it
[2:19:43] a little easier for hagar and i built
[2:19:45] her look honey i built her this little
[2:19:46] stool here so that when she's gathering
[2:19:48] she can kind of sit on that stool and
[2:19:50] and continue to gather the specials
[2:19:53] well you never did anything like that
[2:19:54] for me
[2:19:55] well honey you understand you've never
[2:19:57] been you've never been pregnant and and
[2:19:59] and i was only doing that for because of
[2:20:01] her condition yeah that's what you said
[2:20:03] but
[2:20:05] can you imagine the tension going on in
[2:20:07] that house
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:11] lots of pressure
[2:20:13] now now ishmael was born he's fallen in
[2:20:16] love with his papa abraham abraham has
[2:20:18] fallen in love with ishmael
[2:20:21] and the word of the lord comes
[2:20:24] guess who it comes from
[2:20:26] guess who it comes through
[2:20:28] sarah
[2:20:33] because as her son is being shown off
[2:20:36] little isaac is being shown off standing
[2:20:39] in the back of the crowd is hagar and
[2:20:42] little ishmael and ishmael is mocking
[2:20:44] the baby he's saying something like this
[2:20:45] to his mama look at them big monkey ears
[2:20:51] you ever seen ugly babies i've never
[2:20:52] seen jacob
[2:20:56] i don't know what they were saying but
[2:20:57] something like that the bible said
[2:20:58] mocking
[2:21:00] i don't know what he was saying
[2:21:02] maybe he was saying like sister west's
[2:21:04] daddy brother stuckey used to say like
[2:21:06] i've been forced to say on occasion
[2:21:09] when someone thrust an ugly baby in my
[2:21:12] arms
[2:21:15] and i learned from brother stucky what
[2:21:18] to say you say oh i've never seen
[2:21:20] another one like him
[2:21:25] because
[2:21:26] around here you know it's a baby oh it's
[2:21:28] a baby that won't work
[2:21:31] i've never seen another one like my
[2:21:34] goodness
[2:21:39] now the truth is we don't have any ugly
[2:21:41] babies born around here
[2:21:45] and we're blessed
[2:21:49] this man said i want you to look at that
[2:21:50] baby
[2:21:51] hagar said yeah he has a little little
[2:21:53] drone in he
[2:21:55] something's not quite right i'm afraid
[2:21:56] there's something wrong with that child
[2:21:58] and sarah sees it
[2:22:00] she may not even know what's being said
[2:22:03] but her paranoia that has been with her
[2:22:06] for nine months
[2:22:08] causes her to think and assume and make
[2:22:10] sure i'm sure there's something but
[2:22:12] really god was in this you know
[2:22:14] god was in this
[2:22:16] it might have been sarah's suggestion
[2:22:17] but it was god's idea that ishmael be
[2:22:20] drawn driven
[2:22:21] she said why don't you get rid of that
[2:22:23] woman and i want you to get rid of that
[2:22:24] boy and i want you to do it now
[2:22:27] why what drove her to that place of
[2:22:29] desperation because her mistakes
[2:22:34] had risen up to mock her miracle
[2:22:37] [Applause]
[2:22:38] you see if you don't deal with your
[2:22:40] mistake
[2:22:43] if you sweep it under the rug
[2:22:46] hope nobody ever finds out
[2:22:49] you can rest assure that about the time
[2:22:51] your miracle is born your mistakes will
[2:22:54] surface
[2:22:59] a preacher friend of mine used to say
[2:23:01] here in this pulpit from time to time he
[2:23:03] said you don't want to wait
[2:23:07] to get things right
[2:23:08] when your face is on the on the on the
[2:23:11] front page of the popular christian
[2:23:13] magazine
[2:23:14] he called the name charisma because you
[2:23:16] know this is a famous uh pentecostal
[2:23:18] charismatic magazine he said you don't
[2:23:20] want a way to deal with your sin your
[2:23:22] mistakes your mess
[2:23:24] until your picture is plastered on the
[2:23:26] front of a magazine because then it's
[2:23:28] too late to fix your junk
[2:23:31] most of us don't have to worry about our
[2:23:33] name being on the front page of any
[2:23:35] magazine but i'm telling you right now
[2:23:37] it's time to dig your mistake out from
[2:23:39] under the rug and get it made right
[2:23:41] before the lord
[2:23:43] so that it doesn't rise up about the
[2:23:45] time your miracle starts coming for
[2:23:48] to mock it to steal it to cheat you of
[2:23:51] the joy that comes when god's word is
[2:23:53] fulfilled in your heart
[2:23:58] i don't know how he did it
[2:24:00] but he stands there at the well that day
[2:24:02] i gotta i gotta get past this
[2:24:06] he stands there at the well that day
[2:24:08] pumping that whale
[2:24:10] i guess in those days they
[2:24:12] pulled up i guess they just did it
[2:24:14] probably like this
[2:24:15] he's
[2:24:16] hauling up the
[2:24:18] the rope
[2:24:20] to pull up the bucket of water
[2:24:22] and pouring it into these skins
[2:24:24] and he's preparing a little lunch
[2:24:27] and he walks with hagar and ishmael out
[2:24:29] into the wilderness
[2:24:30] and leaves them there
[2:24:37] had it not been for the angel of the
[2:24:39] lord who came
[2:24:40] and spoke to this bonds woman
[2:24:43] and told her
[2:24:46] your life will be spared
[2:24:52] and god would have let him die
[2:24:56] he not had a purpose for ishmael
[2:25:00] and do you know all these years later he
[2:25:02] still marks the promise
[2:25:04] his children
[2:25:06] still mock the promise
[2:25:10] just this week
[2:25:12] just this week just last week just the
[2:25:14] week before
[2:25:17] here comes a palestinian with a knife
[2:25:19] hidden in his clothes until he gets
[2:25:21] right up to the bus stop
[2:25:23] just this week he was going after a
[2:25:25] police of israeli police at the border
[2:25:28] and goes right in to do everything he
[2:25:30] can his full intention is to gut him
[2:25:34] but before he ever gets to strike the
[2:25:36] first blow he's on the ground
[2:25:39] he can't help himself
[2:25:44] this was part of the prophecy
[2:25:46] he's the wild seed of ishmael
[2:25:48] also claiming abraham as his father come
[2:25:51] on now
[2:25:54] and they're still mocking the miracle of
[2:25:56] israel
[2:25:57] they're still mocking the fact that god
[2:25:59] has given the land not even sometimes
[2:26:01] realizing that their very existence is
[2:26:03] the grace and benefit of god the very
[2:26:05] gift of god that they're even alive and
[2:26:07] have an opportunity to trust in the
[2:26:08] salvation that that our god offers to
[2:26:11] them
[2:26:12] and there's no reason for you to
[2:26:13] mistreat anybody because of their
[2:26:14] ethnicity and i'm not saying that i'm
[2:26:16] not encouraging that i'm i wouldn't want
[2:26:18] you to do that to anybody no one can can
[2:26:21] help where they come from but i'm just
[2:26:23] telling you this is why we have had
[2:26:25] intifada after intifada after intifada
[2:26:27] is because there's a wild seed in there
[2:26:30] they can hardly help themselves
[2:26:32] and you know had it not been had we not
[2:26:34] had abraham not helped out a little here
[2:26:37] had we not gone into this mode
[2:26:41] and you know what i love this is this is
[2:26:43] outside the subject but you know what i
[2:26:44] love when abraham makes it to the hall
[2:26:47] of faith
[2:26:51] god forgot
[2:26:53] whoa
[2:26:55] god forgot his mess
[2:26:58] yes
[2:26:59] it was all a part of god's plan he
[2:27:01] forgave it he forgave it and listen at
[2:27:03] what the new testament says about our
[2:27:05] papa abraham
[2:27:07] staggered not at the promises of god
[2:27:20] god keeps a different record
[2:27:23] than the one you keep
[2:27:25] and the one i keep
[2:27:27] is anybody still here
[2:27:31] all right now uh 52 where we did we get
[2:27:34] anywhere i don't know where we are i
[2:27:35] don't know what i'm doing
[2:27:38] now a man and his family whoo i know
[2:27:40] where we are
[2:27:42] could go back
[2:27:44] to their original inheritance
[2:27:49] leave it up there
[2:27:51] read it for me
[2:27:52] if
[2:27:55] [Music]
[2:27:59] if i could just pray more
[2:28:02] if i could just fast more
[2:28:04] if i could just hear tapes more
[2:28:07] this will make somebody good and mad
[2:28:09] you're not gonna do it anyway
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:13] your flesh is not going to let you
[2:28:16] you're going to have to whoop that thing
[2:28:17] every day
[2:28:20] if you think all of a sudden you're
[2:28:21] going to live the rest of your life
[2:28:23] wanting it like you've never wanted it
[2:28:24] before i want you to know there is a
[2:28:26] process in some of this
[2:28:28] and there is a daily battle to be won
[2:28:31] but once the war is settled once you
[2:28:33] realize
[2:28:34] that your life today is not based on
[2:28:37] your behavior today
[2:28:39] or your performance today
[2:28:41] it's based on his grace and mercy and
[2:28:44] his favor that has been shown toward you
[2:28:47] [Laughter]
[2:28:49] oh if i could just get holy enough i've
[2:28:51] seen women try to get holy enough
[2:28:54] i've seen people try to get holy enough
[2:28:57] we've seen people in our nation that
[2:28:59] thought if i can just not drive in an
[2:29:01] automobile
[2:29:04] if i can just not have frilly curtains
[2:29:06] at my window then i'll be separated
[2:29:08] enough
[2:29:12] well i came up i was talking
[2:29:14] sister anna in my office this morning i
[2:29:16] won't embarrass you to mention that she
[2:29:18] asked me about her hat she said would it
[2:29:19] be all right i don't know what the
[2:29:21] protocol here is about a hat i said wear
[2:29:23] it i like hats that's nice
[2:29:25] but i said i will tell you this when i
[2:29:27] when i came through old
[2:29:30] timey holiness
[2:29:33] we would go to one church and preach and
[2:29:34] they'd preach if you didn't wear a hat
[2:29:36] if a woman didn't wear a hat her head
[2:29:38] wasn't covered
[2:29:40] she already had long hair
[2:29:43] the bible said a woman's long hair is
[2:29:45] giving her for a covering the bible says
[2:29:47] that
[2:29:48] that's not my interpretation the bible
[2:29:50] says that
[2:29:52] you just have to read it and and look at
[2:29:53] it in the original language
[2:29:55] they said if a woman don't wear a hat
[2:29:57] then her head's not covered and then
[2:29:59] we'd go over to the next church to
[2:30:00] preach revival and they'd say any woman
[2:30:02] that would wear a hat got pride
[2:30:05] well over at this church she's got pride
[2:30:07] over at that church she's uncovered
[2:30:08] naked if she don't
[2:30:11] so then i'd go preach at the other
[2:30:13] church and you know what they'd preach
[2:30:14] they'd preach if a woman doesn't burn
[2:30:15] her hair up
[2:30:17] but if she leaves it hanging down that's
[2:30:19] sensual
[2:30:21] and she's trying to attract another man
[2:30:22] besides her husband so they preach you
[2:30:24] better burn it up now i have to be
[2:30:26] honest in most cases i like to see a
[2:30:28] married woman with i i like beautiful
[2:30:32] hair
[2:30:33] dues
[2:30:35] i know i know you just you're quite a
[2:30:37] god
[2:30:40] yeah and i'm another i like
[2:30:42] flowers and plants and when brother todd
[2:30:45] comes to visit i wave at him like this
[2:30:49] [Music]
[2:30:53] but my wife will tell you
[2:30:56] if i had my way
[2:30:59] if it was really my thing you'd see
[2:31:01] beehives here today
[2:31:03] [Music]
[2:31:06] i love them old pentecostal hairdos that
[2:31:09] i grew up with
[2:31:11] i love it it was my culture and i love
[2:31:13] it
[2:31:15] feels like home
[2:31:17] but then i'd go over to another church
[2:31:19] and they'd say bunnied up shamed of it
[2:31:23] you're ashamed of it so you bundle it up
[2:31:26] and put it on top of your head don't you
[2:31:28] no long hair is a veil
[2:31:31] and you're supposed to leave it hanging
[2:31:32] down
[2:31:36] so there'd be sisters with four or five
[2:31:38] stringy hairs down their back
[2:31:42] because their age and whatever and they
[2:31:44] say this is a woman's glory
[2:31:46] i'd say not nomore
[2:31:51] i got your attention at least
[2:31:54] oh
[2:31:55] we used to worry about that
[2:31:58] it gets in us at some time and we think
[2:32:02] if i if i do that
[2:32:06] there's not many women in this church
[2:32:08] that would make the rapture that i was
[2:32:10] taught about
[2:32:13] because the one that i was taught about
[2:32:15] was that a woman if a woman didn't have
[2:32:17] on holes
[2:32:18] she was naked
[2:32:22] for years
[2:32:24] in our church
[2:32:26] we insisted
[2:32:28] in this church
[2:32:31] because it was preached so hard to me as
[2:32:34] a boy
[2:32:36] that if a woman didn't have on host
[2:32:38] she she was not
[2:32:40] properly
[2:32:41] a tired her legs were naked
[2:32:47] when i say that i can hear brother
[2:32:49] branham going down the street
[2:32:54] rayon and what was the other one chiffon
[2:32:57] chiffon what was the other one
[2:32:58] rayon chiffon rayon chiffon which is it
[2:33:03] because this wife has sent him to get
[2:33:06] some
[2:33:07] and he couldn't remember what she'd
[2:33:08] ordered
[2:33:13] we used to think that that that we had
[2:33:16] to get that right
[2:33:18] you'd be surprised if i told you i've
[2:33:20] spent quite a bit of time before the
[2:33:22] lord
[2:33:24] praying about things that simple
[2:33:27] and i must not have been the only one
[2:33:29] because in questions and answers they
[2:33:30] asked brother random about a woman
[2:33:32] shaving her legs
[2:33:34] because i also grew up in a culture
[2:33:36] where they weren't so sure about that
[2:33:37] either
[2:33:38] and
[2:33:39] by all means
[2:33:41] it's a good thing
[2:33:46] so let it be written so let it be done
[2:33:50] i'm a married man now for 25 years and
[2:33:53] that is a good thing
[2:34:02] come back holy spirit
[2:34:06] now a man in his family
[2:34:10] i wanted to bravo drive home a point i
[2:34:12] don't know why i got way out there cut
[2:34:14] all that out
[2:34:18] go back to their original inheritance if
[2:34:20] they could
[2:34:22] hear the jubilee not if they could
[2:34:24] figure out all
[2:34:27] the little it's and
[2:34:28] pieces and bits and systems and
[2:34:33] thoughts and
[2:34:34] figurings and
[2:34:36] if they can hear the jubilee
[2:34:39] don't you don't you leave this place and
[2:34:40] think that i don't believe in holiness
[2:34:43] i pastored this church for years and
[2:34:46] never wore a short sleeve shirt
[2:34:48] in the heat of the summer because i just
[2:34:50] wanted to be right
[2:34:52] i just wanted to be right
[2:34:55] imagine my surprise when i found out
[2:34:57] that i wasn't going to be judged on the
[2:34:59] fact that i bought a short sleeve shirt
[2:35:02] it's like a revelation
[2:35:04] to you some of you
[2:35:05] being raised so differently you think
[2:35:07] that's the craziest thing you've ever
[2:35:09] heard but to me it was life or death i
[2:35:11] have to know lord i have to know i have
[2:35:13] to be right i've given my whole life i
[2:35:16] have to be right
[2:35:18] i'd rather not know what time it is than
[2:35:20] to wear a watch if that would offend the
[2:35:22] holy spirit
[2:35:24] i just want it to be right
[2:35:27] then we come down to the message of the
[2:35:29] hour and this is what i hear
[2:35:31] he said if they could hear
[2:35:40] that you believe
[2:35:42] not if they could pin it right or hang
[2:35:44] it right or cap it right
[2:35:46] if they could hear it right
[2:35:49] powerful isn't it
[2:35:51] if they could hear the jubilee and the
[2:35:53] trumpet sound
[2:35:58] we're gonna have to close here in a
[2:36:00] minute
[2:36:01] and know
[2:36:03] that what it
[2:36:05] meant
[2:36:06] to them
[2:36:11] you've got to hear the jubilee
[2:36:15] you've got to recognize the trumpet
[2:36:17] sound
[2:36:18] and you've got to know what it means to
[2:36:22] you
[2:36:26] he said now if they heard the priest
[2:36:27] sound the trumpet the minister
[2:36:30] the trumpet
[2:36:32] is the gospel are you there
[2:36:34] and when they hear it
[2:36:36] and they know
[2:36:38] what it means
[2:36:39] oh lord have mercy does that mean i've
[2:36:41] got to know ever i got to know which
[2:36:44] which vial that happens under and which
[2:36:46] seal that happens under and do i have to
[2:36:48] know how the trumpets and the vials
[2:36:50] under overlap and do i have to figure
[2:36:52] all that out i want to know i'm just
[2:36:53] that kind of person i want to know all
[2:36:55] of that
[2:36:56] but the truth of the matter is
[2:36:59] that's not what it takes to be ready to
[2:37:02] get out of here
[2:37:04] you've got to recognize the trumpet that
[2:37:06] god's blowing in your ear you've got to
[2:37:08] recognize the voice that god is using to
[2:37:11] call you out of religion
[2:37:13] you've got to do something about that
[2:37:15] hole you've been holding on to
[2:37:20] he said no matter where they lost how
[2:37:22] far they went back listen oh man
[2:37:25] i gotta go i gotta i gotta hurry i gotta
[2:37:28] stop i gotta preach i gotta i don't know
[2:37:30] what i have to do he said it when they
[2:37:33] hear it and they know what it means and
[2:37:35] they know that that's their inheritance
[2:37:38] no matter where they lost
[2:37:41] how far they went back

[2:39:33] live it now
[2:39:39] i have a friend who's
[2:39:41] probably watching this
[2:39:45] a
[2:39:46] retired
[2:39:47] corrections officer
[2:39:49] in a prison in las vegas nevada
[2:39:56] the first time he reached out to this
[2:39:58] ministry he reached out with a tithe
[2:40:01] from his retirement
[2:40:03] and he said a tithe is to be given to
[2:40:05] the work of god but
[2:40:07] i do wish you all would buy brother
[2:40:09] shelly a better air conditioner because
[2:40:12] from where i can see he sweats
[2:40:15] terribly
[2:40:17] and i said but what you don't know is we
[2:40:19] keep it very cool although
[2:40:22] this was something off on this one i
[2:40:23] noticed it last weekend today
[2:40:25] and sister anna miller's glad because
[2:40:27] she can throw out the day but this one's
[2:40:29] not putting out enough i said what you
[2:40:31] don't know brothers i got a fan blowing
[2:40:33] on me
[2:40:34] and the air is cracked
[2:40:36] cranked down and i'm still sweating i'm
[2:40:38] just working
[2:40:39] just digging ditches
[2:40:46] he retired and
[2:40:47] while he was working that job he never
[2:40:49] had any problems
[2:40:51] you know i never met him i had never met
[2:40:53] him
[2:40:56] i admired his family and
[2:40:58] knew some things about the family and
[2:41:00] the mother and
[2:41:02] grandmother
[2:41:05] but i
[2:41:06] got a big surprise in tucson this year
[2:41:10] he said as i was leaving he said a text
[2:41:12] said i forgot about it i was thinking i
[2:41:14] would come out there this year to
[2:41:16] harmony and i and i just didn't plan
[2:41:18] ahead in time and
[2:41:20] they had a little picnic one day and
[2:41:22] invited us to come at the tabernacle
[2:41:24] there and we went
[2:41:25] and brother bobby called me over and he
[2:41:27] said there's somebody here that has to
[2:41:28] ask to meet you and it was my friend
[2:41:30] that i had been communicating with
[2:41:34] and he sent me a text this weekend and
[2:41:37] he said when i was working in that life
[2:41:40] i had no problem finding somebody to
[2:41:41] witness to
[2:41:43] he said there's always somebody to talk
[2:41:44] to about the lord but he said now i find
[2:41:46] myself rather isolated i'm
[2:41:48] i'm retired and he said i just was
[2:41:50] getting feeling discouraged about it and
[2:41:53] so i prayed
[2:41:54] this day and i said lord please give me
[2:41:56] somebody to witness to
[2:42:00] and he said a scammer reached out to me
[2:42:02] on an app that i used
[2:42:13] [Laughter]
[2:42:16] that's better than cussing them out
[2:42:18] didn't it
[2:42:19] [Laughter]
[2:42:22] oh i don't want to quote this wrong i
[2:42:24] want to quote the time involved wrong
[2:42:28] you said a scammer message through an
[2:42:30] app usually wanting money of some kind
[2:42:32] and then the thought came to me that's
[2:42:34] your person there's your person
[2:42:36] so i spent over an hour messaging back
[2:42:39] and forth testifying about the lord and
[2:42:42] the importance of salvation
[2:42:44] goes to show how god can really work in
[2:42:46] mysterious ways we could never imagine
[2:42:50] i said to him that's incredible he said
[2:42:52] not sure it was effective on their end
[2:42:54] but sure made me feel better have a
[2:42:56] blessed day
[2:42:59] just live it
[2:43:01] just live it
[2:43:03] just share it
[2:43:05] just be it
[2:43:08] live the life let christ live his life
[2:43:12] through you
[2:43:15] then they know that's their inheritance
[2:43:16] no matter what they lost how far they
[2:43:18] went back whatever they had to do they
[2:43:19] had the privilege to come and receive
[2:43:21] again their inheritance
[2:43:23] i can't read that you read that for me
[2:43:25] the
[2:43:27] could come
[2:43:32] hallelujah
[2:43:34] this jubilee trumpet gives us
[2:43:38] inheritance for our family
[2:43:41] we have every right
[2:43:43] to claim them
[2:43:44] but you've got to hear it
[2:43:47] you've got to know it
[2:43:49] you've got to understand it you've got
[2:43:51] to recognize what it means to you
[2:43:55] otherwise it's no more than another form
[2:43:57] of religion
[2:43:59] some people look at churches like this
[2:44:01] one even they say well it's just another
[2:44:03] flavor this is another brand they don't
[2:44:05] understand the message that has been
[2:44:07] sent in our day
[2:44:09] they don't understand what the lord is
[2:44:11] doing we're not hanging all of this on a
[2:44:13] man we're not hanging all of this on
[2:44:15] brother branham
[2:44:19] we're following the lord jesus christ
[2:44:22] but i never knew him like i know him now
[2:44:30] i never heard anybody talk about him
[2:44:33] they were too busy talking about whether
[2:44:34] to wear a hat or not
[2:44:38] whether to bun it up or let it hang down
[2:44:41] whether whether whether knee-highs were
[2:44:43] as good as pantyhose
[2:44:45] i heard those i heard those discussions
[2:44:46] in the church
[2:44:48] and all of a sudden a trumpet sounds
[2:44:49] right in the middle of that
[2:44:52] and somehow god loved me enough to let
[2:44:54] me hear it and recognize it was for me
[2:44:56] it was my jubilee brother that got me
[2:44:59] off of my 12-foot shuffle
[2:45:02] the whole family could come and receive
[2:45:04] their inheritance so it is tonight that
[2:45:06] men and women here of louisiana that
[2:45:09] knows the things that we do know and
[2:45:10] have heard from our brethren different
[2:45:12] ones of our
[2:45:13] experience of years ago and find that we
[2:45:16] have walled
[2:45:21] i don't even know if brother branham
[2:45:23] realized this or not when he says this
[2:45:25] i'm not sure he could have but did you
[2:45:28] know there was one place where the
[2:45:30] jubilee did not hold
[2:45:33] a walled city
[2:45:38] if an inheritance was behind the walls
[2:45:40] of a city it was not returned in the
[2:45:43] jubilee
[2:45:46] i said why brother braham say this like
[2:45:47] that and i looked it up
[2:45:51] it tells us that in a walled city
[2:45:54] it remains it's like a it's like a
[2:45:56] government unto itself
[2:45:59] and it doesn't matter how loud the
[2:46:00] jubilee trumpet sounds if part of your
[2:46:02] inheritance is behind that wall you do
[2:46:04] not get it back it does not have to be
[2:46:07] released to you now knowing that keeping
[2:46:09] that in mind i'm nearly done for today
[2:46:11] i'm just quitting
[2:46:13] because i haven't even got to what i
[2:46:14] want to do
[2:46:16] but we're working toward it try to be
[2:46:18] here tuesday night if you can if not
[2:46:19] please stream
[2:46:22] but this is so vitally important if we
[2:46:24] can catch this with the with the
[2:46:26] understanding that
[2:46:28] what was behind the wall was protected
[2:46:30] he said if we haven't walled ourself
[2:46:32] away from it so far
[2:46:36] that we got to hear what somebody says
[2:46:38] instead of what thus saith the lord is
[2:46:43] and can hear what the word of god has
[2:46:45] got to say about it now
[2:46:48] is the hour
[2:46:50] of jubilee
[2:46:52] come back to your original inheritance
[2:46:55] to a real holy ghost
[2:46:58] again
[2:47:01] not a feeling not a sensation not a
[2:47:03] clacking of the tongue
[2:47:05] or a wiggle of the hip
[2:47:07] but a real holy ghost experience
[2:47:10] he said remember he could go free didn't
[2:47:13] have to pay nothing free
[2:47:16] he didn't have to buy it back
[2:47:18] he didn't have to redeem it back
[2:47:20] it just is
[2:47:23] his friend clear
[2:47:24] because the jubilee trumpet is the
[2:47:26] divine reset
[2:47:28] takes us all the way back it's a year of
[2:47:30] remission
[2:47:31] he said just get up and go that's all
[2:47:33] had to do go back if he knew the sound
[2:47:35] of the trumpet if he knew the sound of
[2:47:37] the trumpet i'm telling you right now
[2:47:38] there are people i love they're precious
[2:47:40] people that i love going to church with
[2:47:42] that i'm not sure of this morning i'm
[2:47:44] going to be honest with you this
[2:47:45] afternoon i'm not i'm not sure whether
[2:47:48] or not you have truly understood and
[2:47:51] heard and know the sound of the trumpet
[2:47:55] i can't
[2:47:57] reveal that to you or cause you didn't
[2:47:59] know it it's something the holy spirit
[2:48:01] has to make real to you
[2:48:03] but i'll tell you once you know once you
[2:48:05] do know once you understand
[2:48:08] and you know how vital and important it
[2:48:10] is
[2:48:10] to stay under that
[2:48:14] he had to know the sound of the trumpet
[2:48:16] see for they were sons of god
[2:48:19] remember he could go free
[2:48:21] didn't have to pay nothing didn't have
[2:48:23] to do nothing
[2:48:26] just get up and go
[2:48:29] i know this is going to disappoint some
[2:48:31] people because you'd rather spend 45
[2:48:33] minutes beating the altar
[2:48:36] go ahead i'm willing
[2:48:38] nobody's worked around the altar any
[2:48:40] more than i did in the first 10 years of
[2:48:42] 15 years of my ministry
[2:48:44] because i thought if i brought him to
[2:48:46] the altar i brought him to god
[2:48:48] i'm not against the altar
[2:48:50] but i tell you what it's become a place
[2:48:52] of bless me
[2:48:53] and the altar never was to be a place of
[2:48:55] blessing
[2:48:59] we don't even have any record that there
[2:49:00] ever was an altar bench in the new
[2:49:02] testament church
[2:49:06] but i believe in the altars but part of
[2:49:07] my pentecostal blood
[2:49:09] i believe it's a good place to gather
[2:49:11] but but we don't read about an author in
[2:49:12] the book of acts
[2:49:14] because the altar was in the temple
[2:49:16] and the altar wasn't a place to pray
[2:49:18] wasn't a place to kneel down to either
[2:49:20] was it
[2:49:21] what was it
[2:49:22] it was a place to die
[2:49:28] so if you want to come up here and lay
[2:49:30] down on that order
[2:49:32] present yourself a sacrifice unto god
[2:49:35] spiritually that's perfectly all right
[2:49:38] we need some of that we need
[2:49:39] consecration
[2:49:41] we need more dedication
[2:49:43] we need to focus and make him a priority
[2:49:46] and let jesus have preeminence in our
[2:49:48] life
[2:49:49] but i want you to know more than what
[2:49:52] you do
[2:49:54] more importantly is what you hear
[2:49:59] and only you can control what you hear
[2:50:03] i can tell you god didn't give you ears
[2:50:05] to be garbage cans
[2:50:08] and god didn't give you ears to scan the
[2:50:10] internet so that you can pull every
[2:50:12] message from every source
[2:50:18] i tell you that youtube got some folks
[2:50:20] in trouble around here and you don't see
[2:50:22] them this morning
[2:50:26] because they chose youtube as their
[2:50:27] source
[2:50:29] instead of thus saith the lord
[2:50:33] i knew when i heard that man
[2:50:35] railing that video they sent around that
[2:50:37] man railing against c.s lewis i knew in
[2:50:40] my heart the religious spirit that was
[2:50:42] on him had we given him an opportunity
[2:50:45] he would rail the same about brother
[2:50:46] branham
[2:50:48] i responded to the one that sent it and
[2:50:51] i said let me tell you something the
[2:50:52] religious devil that's on that man that
[2:50:55] very same spirit is a spirit that tries
[2:50:58] to discredit the life of a man who's
[2:51:00] laid down everything to give me the
[2:51:02] truth
[2:51:05] the same kind of i'm against everything
[2:51:08] i'm against everything i'm against
[2:51:09] everything
[2:51:11] there comes an hour where we've got to
[2:51:12] be known what we're for
[2:51:16] you can only survive so long living off
[2:51:19] of what you don't believe in
[2:51:23] eventually you've got to believe in
[2:51:25] something
[2:51:27] you've eventually got to believe in
[2:51:29] someone
[2:51:30] [Applause]
[2:51:35] remember he could go free didn't have to
[2:51:36] pay nothing didn't have to do nothing
[2:51:38] just get up and go
[2:51:46] all this charismatic world
[2:51:49] they want to lead us through 50 stages
[2:51:52] of repentance
[2:51:58] we're repenting for how the american
[2:52:00] indians were treated and we're rep
[2:52:02] repenting for how this woman was treated
[2:52:04] we're repenting for how that one was
[2:52:06] retreat we're repenting of this we're
[2:52:08] repenting of that we're tracing our
[2:52:10] family line 15 generations to see where
[2:52:13] a mason might have been
[2:52:18] i'm not trying to be ugly i'm not trying
[2:52:20] to be critical i'm just telling you
[2:52:22] isn't that just like the enemy to send
[2:52:23] the people on a wild goose chase
[2:52:29] so they can't hear the trumpet
[2:52:33] they can't hear the trumpet they can't
[2:52:34] hear the drum and if you can't hear it
[2:52:36] you're you're still a slave
[2:52:38] if you can't hear it you're going to be
[2:52:39] hoeing
[2:52:42] if you can't hear it you're still going
[2:52:43] to be shuffling
[2:52:45] but to those who can hear it my god let
[2:52:47] me hear it
[2:52:49] my god let me hear it if he knew the
[2:52:51] sound of the trumpet but he had to know
[2:52:52] the sound of the trumpet see for they
[2:52:54] were sons of god they were sons of god
[2:52:56] they were sons of god anybody still here
[2:52:59] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:53:02] 147
[2:53:03] second seal
[2:53:05] help me lord
[2:53:08] i'm nearly done
[2:53:11] because you're you're tired i know
[2:53:12] you're
[2:53:13] old brother ward you know he finally
[2:53:15] went to heaven
[2:53:19] he hung out over there jr steakhouse all
[2:53:21] the time if you ever went in there you'd
[2:53:22] see old brother ward he told me when i
[2:53:25] was seven years old
[2:53:29] i was always a long-winded preacher
[2:53:32] no i was probably a little older i was
[2:53:33] probably about 12 when i was preaching
[2:53:35] for him
[2:53:37] i was probably about 12 years old when i
[2:53:39] was preaching for brother ward at auburn
[2:53:41] road assembly of god
[2:53:44] i remember the first sermon i ever
[2:53:46] preached there i preached on noah
[2:53:48] i'm telling you god moved
[2:53:55] and it was all over brother ward he said
[2:53:57] brother brother stevie that's what they
[2:53:59] all call me then
[2:54:01] that's probably why i like flowers today
[2:54:07] brother stevie he said i need you to
[2:54:10] remember
[2:54:12] the mind will only comprehend what the
[2:54:14] seat will endure
[2:54:23] i guess i forgot that
[2:54:26] in the old testament when a man had been
[2:54:28] sold to slavery this is second seal
[2:54:31] 2 14 you can get these notes they'll be
[2:54:33] on the website as early as tomorrow
[2:54:35] probably i don't know could could be a
[2:54:37] little delay
[2:54:39] because rj and hawk are going out of
[2:54:41] town for a few days this week and it
[2:54:43] could be but as soon as they as soon as
[2:54:45] they can they put these quotes and
[2:54:47] scriptures on the app
[2:54:49] and on the website
[2:54:50] so all you have to do is go pull up the
[2:54:53] document and press
[2:54:55] print
[2:54:56] if your printer is set up to your phone
[2:54:58] you can print off your phone i could
[2:55:00] print them right now from my phone to
[2:55:01] the printer and you can do that too and
[2:55:03] if you don't know how there's enough
[2:55:05] there's enough techies around here to
[2:55:07] help you know how to get these if you
[2:55:09] want to read them over and over again
[2:55:10] and i do read them over and over again
[2:55:12] in the old testament when a man had been
[2:55:14] sold to slavery there come a year of
[2:55:16] jubilee every 50 years 49th year and
[2:55:18] then the year of jubilee and when a
[2:55:20] slave heard this he wanted to go free
[2:55:23] there isn't nothing that can keep him
[2:55:25] from going free
[2:55:27] he can throw down his hoe
[2:55:30] [Music]
[2:55:36] and say so long
[2:55:39] go back home
[2:55:41] the trumpet sounded that's right
[2:55:44] but if he don't want to go and he's
[2:55:46] satisfied how about you musicians coming
[2:55:51] i'm almost to the end of my tank of gas
[2:55:59] depending on
[2:56:02] several factors i don't know how long
[2:56:03] i'll be before i can afford to fill up
[2:56:05] again
[2:56:10] can i have a courtesy laugh that was
[2:56:12] kind of funny
[2:56:17] but if he don't want to go and he is
[2:56:19] satisfied with his slave master
[2:56:23] then he's taken in the temple and they
[2:56:25] take an awl
[2:56:26] you know what it all is and they press
[2:56:28] his ear
[2:56:30] when i see these women with ear bobs on
[2:56:32] that's the first thing that comes to my
[2:56:34] mind
[2:56:37] why in this world a woman would want to
[2:56:40] punch holes in her ears and everything
[2:56:42] else
[2:56:47] i told my mother the divorced woman
[2:56:50] why in this world would you want five
[2:56:52] holes in one ear one in one enough to
[2:56:56] testify that you're a servant of sin
[2:57:00] why would you need four extra
[2:57:03] there's a spirit behind it
[2:57:06] thank you for those amens but i didn't
[2:57:08] need them
[2:57:10] because i know it is the truth there's a
[2:57:12] spirit behind it here listen
[2:57:15] they would take that slave up there to
[2:57:17] the temple and lay his ear up earlobe up
[2:57:21] against the doorpost of the temple and
[2:57:23] take an oil and pierce a hole through
[2:57:26] his ear
[2:57:28] come right out of egypt like this and
[2:57:30] it's a mark
[2:57:32] and he can never go back
[2:57:35] is that right
[2:57:36] that's right it don't matter how many
[2:57:38] jubilees doesn't matter how many come to
[2:57:40] ransom him out and pay his way out once
[2:57:42] he
[2:57:43] has his ear bored through with an awl
[2:57:45] and usually they did put a ring in it
[2:57:49] and it was a symbol of being owned
[2:57:52] and when i see these people with these
[2:57:54] hoops in their nose
[2:57:59] things on their tongue
[2:58:01] breaks my heart
[2:58:03] especially when i see some of these
[2:58:04] little girls like that and my family
[2:58:06] gets so terribly embarrassed because i

[2:58:38] had them big old hoop things in their
[2:58:39] ears i've said to them
[2:58:41] are you inviting somebody to come along

[2:58:57] leave me
[2:59:01] i don't even have condemnation in my
[2:59:03] voice
[2:59:04] i just want to understand why people
[2:59:07] need freakish things
[2:59:10] to feel apart
[2:59:12] my god i don't want to feel at home in
[2:59:14] this world anymore
[2:59:16] i don't want to be a part of this mess
[2:59:19] oh i want to stand out like a sore thumb
[2:59:23] i do i do i do i i'm not trying to be
[2:59:26] peculiar for the sake of being peculiar
[2:59:29] i just want to be different than the
[2:59:31] than the group around me i want i want
[2:59:34] the i want jesus to shine out of my life
[2:59:38] i want to do what's right before
[2:59:40] god if he didn't want to go press his
[2:59:43] ear and put a hole in his ear and it's a
[2:59:44] mark
[2:59:46] that he could never go back is that
[2:59:47] right he has to serve this master for
[2:59:49] all time i don't care how many more
[2:59:51] times the jubilee sounds whatever
[2:59:52] happens he absolutely has sold his
[2:59:54] birthrights of being free
[2:59:56] and when a man turns down the gospel
[2:59:59] truth
[3:00:01] satan marks him
[3:00:03] where
[3:00:05] at his ear he deafens him so he can't
[3:00:07] hear the truth no more he's finished he
[3:00:09] stays with the group that he's with he
[3:00:11] stays with the group that he's with he
[3:00:14] stays with the group that he's with if
[3:00:16] he won't hear the truth
[3:00:21] i'm so thankful that for most of us
[3:00:23] that's not the first time or the second
[3:00:24] time or the third time the gospel is
[3:00:26] presented
[3:00:28] i'm so thankful for a merciful god
[3:00:31] the one that we called on yesterday when
[3:00:32] we saw sister tebow struggling i'm so
[3:00:35] thankful for that merciful god that
[3:00:37] calls us when we need to be called more
[3:00:39] than one time and we'll tell you
[3:00:40] something we're coming to the end of
[3:00:41] this thing now
[3:00:42] and we're not guaranteed to be called
[3:00:44] and called and called and called to call
[3:00:46] to call it's time to lay down it's time
[3:00:48] to lay down our lives it's time to hear
[3:00:50] truth it's time to have our ear tuned
[3:00:53] to the gospel message he said he deafens
[3:00:56] him so he can't hear the truth no more
[3:00:58] he's finished he stays with the group
[3:00:59] he's with if he won't hear the truth no
[3:01:01] you shall know the truth and the truth
[3:01:03] shall make you free
[3:01:04] son tell him i started to say honey you
[3:01:06] probably don't want me to call you in
[3:01:06] front of everybody
[3:01:08] tell them what you're going to sing and
[3:01:09] let them be playing it softly
[3:01:11] let's get ready to move
[3:01:17] i want to go to jubilee year two
[3:01:18] paragraphs and we're done
[3:01:20] yeah you said that before you i probably
[3:01:22] did
[3:01:23] [Music]
[3:01:27] now in these days when these priests
[3:01:29] they take the man out there and maybe
[3:01:30] hoe it in the cornfield
[3:01:32] the master walking down whipping him
[3:01:34] with a whip i want you to i want you to
[3:01:36] see this
[3:01:37] give me this last 10 minutes if you can
[3:01:41] i want you to try to see this in your
[3:01:42] mind
[3:01:43] here's the cornfield out there and a
[3:01:45] bunch of men hoeing in the cornfield i'm
[3:01:48] pretty sure that brother miller give me
[3:01:49] this whole i think he made it i may be
[3:01:51] wrong
[3:01:52] but i'm pretty sure that brother truman
[3:01:54] miller give me this hole
[3:01:56] and i almost didn't bring it today
[3:01:58] because i didn't know if i'd sling it or
[3:01:59] not
[3:02:01] and i didn't want to break it i'm proud
[3:02:02] of it and thankful for it
[3:02:05] and it does the job it may not look like
[3:02:07] a big old fat but i'm telling you it
[3:02:08] does the job
[3:02:10] i don't chop down trees with it i know
[3:02:11] what a hose for
[3:02:13] and that's what i use it for
[3:02:16] i want you to see if you can picture
[3:02:17] your mind
[3:02:19] yourself
[3:02:22] out there in a cornfield somewhere
[3:02:24] hoeing weeds
[3:02:26] and clearing clearing them away pulling
[3:02:28] them away dragging them away
[3:02:31] and the master coming down behind you
[3:02:33] with a whip
[3:02:34] hurry up there
[3:02:37] go to hurry up with this
[3:02:38] [Music]
[3:02:40] you're taking too long
[3:02:43] and crack that whip across your back
[3:02:46] and drive you to keep hoeing and keep
[3:02:48] holding and keep holding and keep
[3:02:50] holding
[3:02:52] give me 74.
[3:02:54] but just as soon
[3:02:56] as that trumpet sounded
[3:02:59] the master standing there with a whip
[3:03:02] [Music]
[3:03:03] driving them
[3:03:05] to their job
[3:03:07] to their task
[3:03:10] just as soon as that jubilee trumpet
[3:03:12] sounded that man could throw that hole
[3:03:14] down and say i won't hold that no more
[3:03:19] if you don't quit whooping me i'm going
[3:03:20] to tie you up with that whip
[3:03:23] i do not belong to you anymore
[3:03:28] because my ear
[3:03:30] has heard the sound
[3:03:32] [Applause]
[3:03:34] my ear
[3:03:36] has heard my jubilee
[3:03:39] can't answer for anybody else
[3:03:42] i can only answer for myself
[3:03:45] my ear has heard the message that said
[3:03:47] to me go free go free go free go free
[3:03:51] quit your striving and go free except my
[3:03:54] deliverance
[3:03:56] [Music]
[3:03:59] that taskmaster that slave driver was
[3:04:01] forbidden to touch him anymore don't you
[3:04:04] lay one more finger
[3:04:06] on him
[3:04:08] why because he had heard the good news
[3:04:17] the jubilee was on
[3:04:20] the atonement was made

[3:04:26] me would you please let's all stand
[3:04:34] did you choose that song
[3:04:37] sister laurel suggested it
[3:04:39] i find that prophetic
[3:04:42] because my next scripture
[3:04:44] charity could show you
[3:04:46] my next scripture psalm 32 7 8.

[3:15:18] deliverance i want to talk about the
[3:15:20] difference between a process of
[3:15:22] deliverance and a total deliverance
[3:15:25] there are a lot of things i want to talk

[3:15:28] strength to pull together
[3:15:30] and give you this morning
[3:15:32] i know their needs here
[3:15:34] i went to stephen because he reached out

[3:15:40] come stephen i'll come to you and pray
[3:15:41] for you now i'm asking the lord to do
[3:15:44] the work

[3:16:01] knew that the anointing was already on
[3:16:03] him when he was describing his need
[3:16:06] because it was so clear
[3:16:07] that i could understand it and i believe

[3:16:46] to stand for every one of us in prayer
[3:16:48] and i'm telling you god speaks to her

[3:20:58] your glory
[3:21:00] and let that nature that you've placed
