========================================

Description:
Jesus knew exactly what His calling was.  He knew who He was, He knew where He had come from.  That is why the enemy could only tempt Him, but not bring Him to unbelief.  Because of the Christ in us, we too can have the same revelation to overcome every temptation the enemy hurls our way.  When the Bride of Christ receives a real revelation of who she is, we can overcome all.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do you know what would happen in your life if you got a true and genuine revelation of who you are in christ but the bible said he was tempted in all manner as we are so you think about your temptation you think about what the enemies tried to pull you into and then you will know that in every way that the enemy tried to tempt you he tried to tempt him whoa and none of it could pull him into unbelief why because he knew who he was somebody said because he was god no because he was god man but it was because he knew who he was he knew who he was he didn't have to go to church to find out who he was in fact when he went to the synagogue in luke chapter 4 the prophecy of isaiah was fulfilled because he recognized who he was by the reading of his own commission and mandate the spirit of the lord is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach he knew exactly who he was and when he went to sit down he left the rostrum by saying this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he knew exactly who he was he knew where he had come from he knew where he was going back to and because of that all the enemy could do was tempt him but he could not bring him into unbelief do you know what would happen in your life if you got a true and genuine revelation of who you are in christ and who christ is in you did you know that you would be able to reject every temptation that the enemy would throw in your way because you would recognize you came from god and you're going back to god and nothing that the enemy used against you would be successful brother branham said if that bride has a revelation a real revelation of who she is nothing would be able to touch her nothing would be able to stop her nothing would be able to dissuade her i dare say to that the most important thing for all of us today would be to have a revelation of who we are in christ and who christ is in us
