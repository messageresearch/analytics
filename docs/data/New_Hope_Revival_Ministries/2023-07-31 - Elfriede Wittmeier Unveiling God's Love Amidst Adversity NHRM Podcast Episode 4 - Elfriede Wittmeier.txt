pillar in our church for a long time I'd like to welcome and introduce social Alfredo Whitmire to our podcast for the first time and we're just going to talk today about her life and her life story and talk about her mom's life story because that is a big thing for you too and all the experiences your mom had so welcome I'm glad to have you on here nice to be here Usher um so I like I said we want to talk about your mom because how long have you been in our church now 30 years so you've been in our church for 30 years in our church a long time you've seen a lot of us grow up a lot of us born oh yes sister Alfreda has been a big prayer Warrior for not only our young people but especially our young people I feel like um in so many different ways he used to lead prayer meetings with our young people and stuff that were such an encouragement and uh we can never thank you enough for all that you've done for this this ministry I mean you've worked for this ministry for 30 years pretty much so thank you for that and I'm excited to get into some of your family history a lot of people may not know where you came from and and all that so um where let's I'm just gonna ask a couple quick questions before we get into the story where were you you were born and where I was born in Poland Poland in went in 1942 I'm the set i'm I come from a big family my first um my older siblings the five were actually born in Ukraine or in a province of Ukraine at the time called walinia okay it it's not very far from Kiev and Rob no these places that are in the news oh or have been yes and so um I'm I'm just very thankful here to be here and to be able to share many of the the wonderful ex things that actually in order for us to realize the enormity of what God is doing today there are so many prayers that have gone forth in the regions in the world in the Nations and it's good to know you know that there are people who have prayed and have always looked for more sure you know before um it was a it was just right after covid started we were having a little prayer meeting with with sister Flo and Sharon we were at her house and we were praying and all of us and it was very powerful it was a there was such an anointing and Sharon began to see the light of the the light come in and I went off to the other direction because the Lord began to speak to me and he told me to pray for the Ukraine and Russia that was before anything had come in and I thought well and then he said you have an inheritance and because many seeds have been sown by your your ancestors and uh that I thought was very interesting and since then you know I have really prayed many many times because it's like my roots yeah you know for sure and so where you're from thankful you know that my God is God is just mindful of everything we do and everything we say and you know it's it's such a privilege you know to be a child of God in these days and really you're you're really a miracle sitting here because kovid got you I mean it hit you pretty good oh yes I almost died and you're I mean so really it's for you to be sitting here talking with us today is really a miracle in itself yes that was that was well the doctor at the hospital had actually told me three times he said if you don't check in at the hospital uh you have double pneumonia covet double pneumonia and uh he spoke of death he said you will not make it wow and so I went to the greeleys they were all sick as well and uh but it was amazing you know when he left he was angry that I didn't stay yeah and and he asked me again are you sure you're not you're you you don't want to stay and I said yes I am I and uh right afterwards the nurse told me you made the right decision wow she told me that you're sitting here with her she told me that three times because I told her I said I'm going to trust the Lord in this and uh you know it was a state of the greatest for about a week they were as sick as I mean it was it was it was terrible there was a real battle going on in there yeah but um seven days later I was driving my vehicle yeah it was so the Lord really undertook so how many siblings do you have I've got eight siblings there's nine yeah the number seven and um yeah so I'm number seven from the top up and number three from the bottom so big family it's a big family yes and they're all in all your siblings now besides all except they're all still alive except for my oldest brother he died last year and they're all they all still live in Canada right yes yes um so let's we're going to try and dive into it um I know you really want to talk about I mean really Your Life Starts before actually yes because so you want to talk about your mom I mean I kept she had such a big impact and your life and spiritually and stuff that we really need to get into that and talk about that as well you know uh you when you go back to well about a hundred years 110 years you know that um just to see things in the perspective I'll just touch a little bit on the the history let's just take a little walk together let's go and 100 years yes so when was your mom born in 1912 and um just you know because this is in the news again she was born two months after the Titanic sank wow so that you know it's not just saying well it's this person first world war but that had just happened so and the Titanics and you know all that in the news again it's and all these different countries too like Russia uh now Poland and Ukraine and Germany all you know there has been so much turmoil throughout the years I mean this what is happening now is just another repeat another repeat so tell me a little bit about your mom and a little bit about her history and background okay um like I said she was born in 1912. my dad was born in 1906. they shared a birthday the 24th of June and Dad was born in at the time the Azusa Street Revival began and also like brother Branham had said you know that leodicia the church age started in 1906 so that's kind of a landmark we can go back on so um my mom she well the political situation was terrible I mean as you as you know like the devastation the destruction and and the nation was rising up against nation and Russia itself they they during that those 10 years they got rid of royalty of the tsar and his family that um he was incarcerated in 17 they shipped him to Siberia and then they the kid they assassinated the family and Lenin took over he was and that was actually the birth of Communism that took place all the upheaval so you can well imagine what it was like to live in that part of the country and your mom when she was a little girl didn't she have to weren't they supposed to be like shift off to Siberia or something yes yes but before that um she when she was nine months old her relatives many of them went moved to Canada her ad and I'll go and cousins simply because of they were targeting the German ethnics you know the colonization there that you know although they had lived there for years and years you know probably as far back as under Catherine the Great so that you know they had every right to be there but then when War arises and they think that that they thought perhaps Germany might move over to take over part of that Eastern section so you know that these things just build up for sure so that's the reason they thought well we're getting getting out of here we're not uh so but they lost contact with my mother's family all together because they all went to Canada they went to Canada and my great-grandpa and Grandpa they decided to stay because they had worked very hard and so they you know had started their family mom by that time by the time the war started she was two two and a half and her mother was expecting another baby but my grandpa had to go to war in at the start of the first World War so um because of all the upheaval and that the soldiers had come although they lived more in a remote area you know everything seemed peaceful yeah that but yeah that the soldiers came and they actually she was seven months pregnant my grandma just young she was 21 or 22. and she was a real educated uh person she had gone to school all the time she spoke quite a few languages and she did all the legal work you know for the people in the town and and you know she was she was whereas with my mother because of all the upheavals and that she didn't go to school at all or hardly she taught herself how to read and write and I'm telling you she was a whiz at math yeah we always laughed at her you know anytime we would try to buy some you know linoleum or whatever she had it figured out in her head in no time she was just and like I said she taught herself so she could read and write and your grandmother ended up getting killed in the World War II yes so then what happened right near I think it was almost probably in 1914 in the fall mother would have been about two and a half and she um she was the soldiers had come and they were going to deprive get take all the food from them and everything and so she begged them not pleased to leave them something for the winter and he got so angry and he kicked her in the belly and she tried to get away through the window and she died in in real Agony it was it was apparently was terrible so then mother had to uh because her dad was in the army and she went to live with the her grandparents so then it didn't take very long there because again because of all these upheavals I think perhaps mom might have been around for four years at the time you know when the Czar got killed or just before that so they the soldiers had come right the Baltimore weeks because communism was coming in right and um they came and just overnight they had to get up and leave they could just take with whatever they had they were put on the train and they traveled about 2 000 kilometers so around like I said 12 13. 100 miles miles somewhere yeah and they moved down to the near the um well the Volga River the Caspian Sea or the Black Sea it would be at the bottom of the Euro mountains and so that was it was a very Lush land it was very uh it was nice and they had to work in the Orchards so they worked during the the summer the winters were very severe and that and they had a lot of snow so most of that most of the time then her Grandpa would work in inside and um they said sometimes the snow would go right up to the rooftops wow yes it was it was awful and uh but Grandpa her Grandpa really took advantage of it and he taught her he read the Bible spent a lot of time reading and this is I think with the Lord manned even the the Heritage that I have from because he would teach her and um and one of the things he kept repeating to her was about Israel he so he saw from the scripture that Israel would again become a nation and that he said I know I will not see it but you most likely will and if you don't your children definitely will see the day that Israel will become a nation so that was more than 30 years before it happened now why do you think he was talking so much about Israel and Stockton he loved is I don't know but he he just had it in and he saw that from from the word now I don't know I don't know if we have any Jewish heritage heritage I I wouldn't be surprised okay I was just wondering because that's very interesting I wouldn't say a random thing but like that's something different for him to you know yes yes as a young girl yes and so um they got to go back home in uh right at the end of the war probably around maybe 1920 somewhere and they found you know that the home had been plundered and everything was was um it was vandalized and so they had to start from scratch so to speak it was and that happened actually several times in my mom's life really yes she where she had lost everything I think about either four or five times where they had to start right now so that was very difficult but somewhere in there they were able they rebuilt and they acquired some cattle but because of the uncertainty and the wild animals you know they so Mom and her cousin had to look after the cattle she said for during the day you know just at a young age she would have been is that eight nine ten you know that time and uh she said it's so scared me because there were a lot of wolves around and I learned to pray see Grandpa had taught her a lot yeah she was always very interested in in scripture and so that was she was always looking you know how her mom was right so um it was then that the Lord when she began to pray like that the Lord began to show her and things in the spirit she either would see Visions open Visions that's what she told me that she had seen just before she died I thought it was a one-time thing but that particular time when she had that visitation about two weeks before she died that I was telling you about um she she I had a conversation with her right after I talked to her for about two hours and she kept emphasizing that to me she said remember and then I I said Mom did you see it more often it sounds like that she said yes I kept seeing it either open Vision or I saw a thought in a dream at different times and she said it's very important which is always a Bible and it had a lock on it she thought it was it had a lock on it and she heard the Lord say in your day I am going to send I'm I'm going to open up that word and I'm going to reveal this many secrets you know the secrets of the scripture yeah and he said and I have seen that happen see so he pointed her and I feel that is so important for our day for sure because it's part of that prophesy again and the things we have seen through brother brownham's Ministry and God has done amen I mean if we could even comprehend ever you know what the Lord has really done through that Ministry it's it's just unfathomable for sure too so but he was already then at her young age pointing right direction yes and it's crazy how I mean like like at a young age your grandpa or her grandfather was teaching her about the Bible and stuff yes and then she learned to pray because she was watching cattle and livestocks exactly God really works in mysterious way sometimes yes he does that's awesome so again one thing that they did although they had I'll just share that because um the house they built or it was very small but Mom said at times because of all the upheaval and people you know would come and they would house them really yes they barely had enough of their own but she said they they were sleeping in the living room on the floors everywhere because they had no place to go just people from after the war yes and with what was happening in in Russia and later on when we emigrated to Canada and you know times were very hard at the beginning for all of us in Canada as well and then some people had contacted us from the British Columbia area and they had sent to us a boxes of fruit you know they by this time these people had had acquired an orchard I mean British Columbia is beautiful and it's a fruit area and that and so we started to get all kinds of things like apples and peaches and cherries and and you know and we come to find out that these people have had been one had been a family that they had housed there in Russia really and yeah and they said that um that her those grandparents and them had done so much for them wow and they had just heard that we had emigrated and they just wanted to reimburse wow jumping ahead but I just want to ask you this one thing what year did Joe go to Canada and well we came in um my older sister came in 19. that's right because y'all came in different times different times always a half a year apart wow yeah Bernie's mama she came first and art half a year later and Lydia came half a year later and then the rest of the film okay okay so we can jump in the head a little bit we came in June of we uh it would have been yeah we got on the ship on the mom's birthday I remember that 24th of June 53. when did your mom and dad meet what year did they meet get married they got married in 1929 1929 yes yeah Mom was still very young I think she wasn't quite 17. wow yes and so they they lived in in that part of the Ukraine and that's where my older siblings were born and then all all like in the 30s that's when all the things happened with Hitler he came into power in 33 now Stalin he was he he came into power in 24. so all of that was going on in Russia and under that rulership uh it was just his work Terror maybe even more as bad as the Holocaust and I mean if you know any history at all it was yeah it was terrible but so then Hitler came into power in 33 and while Germany was far off you know they were pretty safe yeah so they thought they thought and then yes um so you were born and you were born in okay so then as time progressed um Hitler had invaded Poland in 1939 okay okay and then when he did that my my he replaced he took a lot of these German people and moved them into Poland so these they were basically they were forced to do that they had no option to you know whether they wanted to go they had to leave their Homeland I mean it was home to them and they lost everything then I mean they had to leave everything behind and by the time they my dad had come with a wagon and with the few belongings they were able to take and Mom and the kids had gone by train and they were they were waiting for him to come and you know at the border they stole it people stole everything you know they lost yeah so they had to start all over again poverty in but they were put into oh they had no choice they had to they were placed into a different home and the Polish people they some had to go went to again Siberia or or to Germany yeah to Germany they you know and that there's a lot of animosity even though they had to leave everything behind but then when you have to take over somebody else's home so you don't have a choice yeah and you know with that so now um I mean y'all stayed in y'all's home and right until the tanks were pretty close didn't you uh well yes so now in 1939 we had to move to Poland and the place or the province or whatever it was in the vatago it was assigned you know Hitler would have taken that so that's where the four of us the youngest were born what okay so so they had already moved once and now you're in Poland yes okay that is like the oldest siblings were born in the Ukraine my my older brother he said just a year older and I he was born in 41. I was born 42 Bob in 43 and Adolf and 44. okay so we were all about 15 months apart so we were all just babies no now when did your dad have to leave okay that was in dad he was able to stay there you know most of the time of the war at the end of 44 the war ended in May 45 so that was only about six months half a year before he was conscripted into the army he had to go but up to that point he was taking care of all the business you know because most of the men had been drafted yeah and so he was always busy he worked he was a member of the fire department and anytime anything needed fixing or you know he was responsible he was one of the two there were two men dad was one of them so that's why he even got to stay at home until 40 you know the end of 44 probably I think the very beginning of um November 44. my youngest brother was born in August so he was just a little over two months old and like I mean and y'all stayed I mean now he had when he was leaving he had packed a wagon for y'all just in case y'all had to get it he did there was a barn and so he had because it was considered treason if you even thought that the Germans were forced to retreat yeah you know they were winning the war right up everybody tell me that Lydia says I was we we were running for our lives but we were winning the war you know so so and there were a lot of treaties and and things going on behind the scenes between Russia and Poland and and everything so it was most dangerous for Germans to be living in that part so then I mean I mean y'all like I said y'all left it like the last minute really well um yes it was on the 17th of January that early in the morning someone this man opened up the door and just hollered and said Mrs Whitmire the enemy is upon us their their close I think it was only about 12 kilometers away from the Russians were coming and we have to you have to get out so that was very very dangerous you can imagine so you have nine kids to get ready but we didn't have many belongings because you had to wear whatever you owned yeah you I mean there was little to be had right so you didn't really have adequate and your dad had already packed up the wagon for y'all yeah well what he had done he did what he could yeah like um he put all the feed for the horses on there and you know with the flower they had it had that in the house yeah you know until you know ready to go so that whoever you know they helped with that and by the time you really get going it took longer than but we were always ahead of the the Army as a that was like the Russians so then y'all y'all went when y'all left the house by wagon did y'all have an idea where y'all were going or y'all just just went you were just going you were trying to head out to West Germany Germany I mean because we were German citizens yeah but it's you just ran yeah and yeah that's crazy yes um now when y'all were all I do want to talk about this uh which sister was it that got lost yes it was Judith's Mom okay that's I don't know this oh it's this one yeah I have yeah yeah um I'm gonna I have pictures of these and Hawk is gonna insert them in the uh yes uh clip or video later on yes um but tell me that story because that's a pretty I mean that's pretty crazy story because I mean y'all are just on this road it was only about we had been on the road for only about two or three days so it wasn't even really hadn't really been that long no no but you also have to realize that Poland you know in January it was always referred to as the hymite it means that cold Homeland really you know you always they always referred and didn't until they switch off on the wagon to who was walking to keep warm or something like that well just to get some exercise too and and so my older sister had just gotten back and I mean it was very exhausting as you can well imagine and so she she was telling me yeah she said I got off the wagon and you know I was just Meandering along and looking to see um you know she was curious at this and that and not realizing the severity of not paying attention now how old would she have been she was eight she turned eight on the first of January and this happened on the 20th well just a baby you know that was you know little you picture that you know nature and in the cold cold weather but anyway then she started running and trying to find uh the wagon you're trying to find the family she got really scared and then she came to y in the road and uh thinking they must have gone straight ahead and she said mom had really drilled that into them that whatever you do you keep running you keep going yeah you know don't stay behind because the enemy is right behind us so um she went straight and mother had veered off to the left where most of the traffic had gone the track had had gone you know what one wagon behind the other and uh yeah and that's that's when your dad years later here she was going through some some things in that and but your dad saw that the vision about her coming to that why and she had had taken the wrong road so she went she went down that Y and she ended up stumbling up on another wagon she came she kept going straight and she said there were only two wagons you know she was running and running hoping to catch up to the family and one thing she did is she stuck to the she held on to that wagon one of them and all night she ran all night long did she well held on and I don't know how she did that I mean an eight-year-old little and uh what happened is she's she said I knew if I let go I would either be trampled to death by the horses or you know wound up wind up under the wagon or land in the ditch either way would have meant death because because she would have frozen to death it wasn't a heavily traffic area it was yeah so she held on and somewhat towards morning they discovered that there was a child here at the back holding on to the wagon they held her up I and they put her on a pillow I probably gave her something to eat I don't know but they were very kind and they put her on to the on the pillow and she fell asleep sound asleep and when she woke up that pillow was soaked in blood like it was all bloody they anyway they took her to a school in the next town you know the school and that's where they left her because that's where people would have picked them up that couple came and picked them up you said the pill was Bloody that's because she was causing blood from her lungs like her lungs and yeah over exertion it was it was yeah just as a and so they took her to a school where this school yes and then that's where that couple came and they took her in cheese spent at least over a year with them and but they did not register her because you see Mom tried everything to locate her even after the war through the Red Cross anybody who would have known any whereabouts you know they but because they didn't register her they they couldn't find her no and uh so when that happened then that man the he had butchered his own sheep you know it was but they weren't allowed to he and then he tried to make it look like it had been stolen and and uh yeah so that's when they they got him they knew it wasn't so so they broke the law he went to jail he went to jail for that yes and then so she went to another family that's it yes and so they registered her yes gotcha so she was with them for over a year they put her in school and uh so this one day and mom always she she told you know her brother her happy she her half-brother you know he was he he was living in in Germany there where we were by that time already and uh she asked him she said would you go and get her if we ever find her and he always tried to distract her and she says no we're going to find her you know the and uh and he said if we do then then I yes I would do it I'll I'll go wherever she is and fortunately she had crossed that one Bridge because it was a city of guben and and that was occupied I think partially by the the allies and also the Russians if she had stayed if she had not gone across it would have been very difficult to to get her out but this was there was no problem then so how long she was gone two and a half years years she came back we lost her in January and she came back sometime in June yep 47. wow yeah do you remember when she came home like I I yes I do I I just remember her standing by the door and mom was explaining to us that this stranger here was uh also from now on she was also our sister I remember her standing and I thought who is you know I mean I didn't remember yeah no oh so so she was about 10 and a half when y'all forgot her back that's that's unbelievable yeah but it's really a miracle it really survived yeah and really I mean it's America I mean think about like all the little certain like the first family didn't register her but then he ended up doing something wrong and ends up going to jail exactly the next family register her I mean that's that's crazy all in itself so we did get her back um now what were the roads I know you have a pretty interesting story about some of the roads that y'all had to travel on to where y'all were go west to West Germany I mean some of them were super Nero on a cliff and stuff oh even when while we were fleeing you see there was that whole time from January until May we were we were overrun in May by you know the the that's when the Russians came out you see and um that's when that incident happened with the pig Barn oh yeah tell me that one that one first yeah tell me that one first okay it um it was it was when when we came there then Mom was so happy that we would finally have a roof over our head you know I mean this was why y'all were still fleeing to get out yes it was right at the end of the war I mean it was early May so the war ended on the 7th and so um we we were she was so happy that so we slept we were supposed to sleep in that pig Barn it had been cleaned up you know it was had been empty for quite a while and my older brothers were staying in the on the wagon art and Irvin they were looking after the belongings mom and the baby by that time he was about well about eight nine months and they slept right by the entrance of the door of that barn and then the way they had you know there was a long hallway and the rest of us were where we had to keep our clothes on you know she was ready to run at any time but um so it was in the middle of the night and mind you the horses that there was a barn there were a lot of there there were in the it was a how like a lot of barns that belonged to that uh house and so they were able to keep the horses in in a barn okay you know so otherwise we would have lost the horses right there and uh so the boys were sleeping on that wagon and Mom all of a sudden in the middle of the night she heard the voice saying uh take the baby and get out and she sat up and she was so exhausted and thought this can't be happening you know what what he didn't she just laid back and fell asleep again and uh this time every time she told it she says whenever I tell that I feel those hands those hands grabbed her under her arm and stood her up he said take the baby and get out wow so she took him and went over to the wagon and he and you know she said I've got to go and wake up the rest of the children now you have to realize everything was dark pitch black it was around one o'clock one two and then when she came back to wake the Wake the rest of us up the tanks have moved in and that Barn had taken a hit wow and it was exactly all of y'all still in it yes but Mom where Mom was with the baby that was where it hit wow it was a direct hit yeah so that was very very so anyway and you know the buildings in in Europe yet they have you know all the brick so that all came down and on the Rafters and and uh right behind while we were right behind that but with whatever happened to Mom from the pressure and and that she was knocked unconscious wow and so it took a little while for her to come too and then she heard a scream and uh she made her way on her hands and knees and and all that rubble and that she pulled out one child after the other but still you know everything was still dark and so they started counting you know we were a short one we don't know who's who's missing and and it was me I was missing so she had to go in again but uh by that time I was already unconscious and that and she kept slapping me and hitting and and Lydia said what's the matter with Mom I thought she was just beating you so so anyway and it was somewhere in there then you know she kept pounding me and that and I yeah I came too I screamed but so I mean that story right there in itself blows my mind every time just to think about what would happen if she would just stayed there I mean yes yeah well none of us would have survived because yeah and and the thing the you know the Divine protection that was there we were right in the middle of the crossfire yeah and the house they had some officers there and that house took a hit see these people were all protected right and uh the officers but they were the ones that got killed they lost their limbs they were torn apart and everything and we were right in the middle of it my brother had a has a scar on his cheek and it and Adina has she had just a little bit on her on her neck really but in all of that none of us were now what happened afterwards y'all got all got out of the barn did y'all just get in the wagon and take off again or no then there was a field Barn there and everything and it was actually um it was then one of the Russian soldiers in all of this I mean all this screaming that was going on in that but the Russian soldier was going to come and he was going to rape mom wow and um and she and all of us kids gathered around her and that and we were and she told him if you touch me these if you do anything to me these kids you're going to be hearing uh their cries in your ears the rest of your life you know he told him and he took off and uh and so we went to the field barn but it didn't take very long and he came back and he had a feather tick and he said now take that and cover all of your kids so we were he just turned right around and and um you know the the Lord just really took care wow of that and then yeah after that well the Russians had come in yeah and uh no no so we lived we lived uh there for almost a year in in uh that that area and that's the Eastern Bloc that was you know captured by the Russians it was Russian territory so as soon as the Border opened up to the West that Mom took the opportunity immediately as soon as we were able to get to West Germany then we left everything behind again and started out yes and over there uh that's when you had asked me if I you know the means of transportation it was um um I do remember being in the cattle cars like the the kind you always see the Jewish people were transported I remember that I thought I'm going to suffocate here because first of all it was hot but the you know I mean I was just what four when we got to the West and uh you're little and you have to stand up it was overcrowded and I could hardly breathe now before we get to uh talking about where when y'all got to West Germany and stuff yes tell me about the story about the two soul I think there are two soldiers that came and helped y'all with the wagon I think no there were more more than two there were yes because the area that see was all at times mountainous region when y'all were traveling yes when we were fleeing you have to realize we were on the go for almost four five months four months and um yeah it was probably um night or dark and or desk or whatever but the roads were so stretch treacherous it was it was you know coming around the corner there was the mountain and then there was the just dropped off dropped off yes and the road was very narrow and so the wagon had to make its way around and no matter how careful you were but just in front of us mom was telling us you could hear that wagon didn't make it and uh and they went down the horses and the screams and and you know it was it was it was terrible it really and so no matter how hard she tried the the horses couldn't get a grip and we were going slowly but the the wheel got caught right on the edge and all the kids were on there you know and she was she was trying to get you know she took a blanket to see if the the horses would get some traction to be able to get out and there was just no way and she was just praying and then all of a sudden these men appeared uh coming around the corner and in no time flat they they helped her out and she was she said I I was just turned and for a moment and she was going to thank them and they were gone wow they weren't yeah they were nowhere to be seen yeah that's crazy so I mean so that yeah it's amazing it really is yeah but it's it's one one thing after the other the mercies and and the protection of the Lord was unbelievable I mean believable yes you know but so so it's like it was a crazy Journey just to get to West Germany well yes well by the time we got to Germany West Germany in 46. so it would have been um you know we were in a in a you know you had to go to all that transition and they designated the the um town or wherever we had to we were able to go okay but and and you said like now look back and stuff y'all were actually pretty close to some of the concentration camps oh there were I mean Poland was was dotted with with him all over yeah we've learned I mean you know when you think about it even Auschwitz was not very far yeah you know it it was but it wasn't or the ghetto the the uh Warsaw Ghetto and then but quite often you know the the Jewish people would come you know when we were still living there and uh uh many times the Jews would come to the door and uh mom would you know because it was so dangerous to even help them at any time and uh and uh she would always make sure that some of the help police so would be gone she would send the girls away and that and she would when she would just gather up whatever she could and she would go and then give it to her well yes behind like the back way and she would make sure she you know she would give them whatever because everything we had was also rationed yeah you know you had to report any anything you know the amount of butter that or or eggs or whatever you would have or you know you had to give that up yeah you just had enough for your own kids and that's it oh now hard times in West Germany after the war ended what made y'all want to start transitioning to Canada just to get out of there just because that's where y'all's family was well tell me about the address because that's okay see then yeah I mean you have to think Germany was destroyed so many of the bridges were gone they were blown up and all the rubble I mean you you wouldn't believe yeah the devastation that was and so um we had well there was no support anything Mama worked you know we were we were living by that time we were living in that little on the second story of that old house it was 200 years old and the quarters were actually meant for the uh old people for their the parents as a retirement so it was square footage was about 600 square feet that we had we had no light in that last little room where we slept the little ones then in the middle room there was only one hanging light bulb and I can't remember if we had a light in the other bedroom so there were three rooms 600 square feet no running water no facilities and 10 people living in there yes and we had to yeah but we all had to work I'm telling you we had to go and get the water any anything we needed we had to go right around the house at least a half a block to go and get a pail of water there was a a minister that came to y'all's house yes every once in a while right yes I'm going to tell you about that because right away yeah because that's yes let me just share a little bit just what our living conditions were like there in addition to our not you know just having that little bulb and uh they would turn off the electricity so usually around supper time we and the only heated room we had was that middle room you know that served as a as a kitchen as a living area and one of us kids always wound up sleeping there as well right so but we had that stove and we again we had to go into the woods to try to gather wood so that we would be able to heat the place and that was our only warm place as you can imagine yeah so but so in the winter time you know around suppertime when they would turn off the electricity and that well mom she was she made sure that we would learn a lot of things she set us around there we and we would sing We had to sing or she would tell us stories or you know the scripture she taught us a lot of things we she just used that time at two two you know teach us so anyway she uh we learned a lot of songs that way and if there were 10 verses we had to sing them all white great but you know because of it all we were a very close family I mean you know and even now sometimes when I gone home and I look at them all and I think you know now they're all old and you know and I thought but these are the people that we went through all those Hard Times yeah you know it it I love them dearly and you're getting to go back and see them yes oh yeah so yeah tell me about the preachers because I mean that's really how y'all were introduced to brother Brandon yes okay uh he he was like an itinerant preacher he would come he you know we got to know some of the different people even in in the town we lived in and also three kilometers away there was a the town of Lindell and you know we got to know what Mom was always a people person but they were Believers and they really believed in praying through and experiencing the Lord and so that man was related to one of those families okay but we had we had mm-hmm talking a lot um so he would come and he would preach and sometimes in that little you know in those little rooms I don't know how we fit all these people and but you know where there is a will there's a way and uh I remember falling asleep so often they had the benches along the the wall there and we'd be sleeping underneath there but I can I can still remember his preaching really I was seven eight somewhere around that yes I really it interested me how would he come around to y'all oh sometimes every three four months or so not very often no but but they would also get together you know with the people and prayed so it they weren't fully dependent on him but it was very but he saw he saw visions and dreams he was a very spiritual man and at the time when we emigrated to Canada he told he told my mom whatever you do when you get to Canada make sure that you get in touch with the ministry of William Branham he said he's a great man of God on the rise right now and that would have been in the 40s I think the late 40s already yeah so so we got to hear you know I remember even about the you know the magazine the midnights cry the uh they uh translated that and things were written about brother Brown I'm there already so we got to hear and then later on I'll just fast forward a little bit to with what happened is um all these the years had gone my mom had searched and she because we we were in Baptist circles and they didn't know they didn't hear we didn't hear of him at all and she didn't know where to find him and until one day we had a young you know the young people always came to our place this is Canada this is Canada already and this one young man he uh he said oh I'm just gonna stay for dinner and then because I want to go over and go over to the the exhibition because there's a preacher there and I want really want to hear him so Mom asked him you know who it was what was his name she was interested and she said he told her that was it was William Branham wow so that that and and it was within walking distance yeah I think it was only about from where we lived it was just to three miles well yeah now did she end up going she went to one meeting and but she didn't understand very much that's right you told me because you know we had gone to a German Church she didn't yes and um she would always ask her what did she say what did he say yeah you know she understood a few words but yeah she wants now so that lady actually my her granddaughter is now married to my nephew really yes I did not know that yes yeah yeah they did not know that they live so oh now I feel like it's important to tell everybody how y'all came to Canada because y'all had no y'all y'all had no idea where to go no idea who to contact no no and the lord gave your mom's an address yes what happened and that was would have been fairly early because we came to West Germany in 46. and um that she had really experienced the Lord and I'll tell you about that right away but um she kept praying and uh she said Lord we have to have some help here you know we all she worked she worked for the farmers down you know as much as she could and and everything but um and uh he and she saw this address now you have to think that was they had emigrated well let me let me just tell you when she she wrote it down and wrote to these people I had no idea who it was so several weeks later we she gets a letter and it turned out to be a letter from her cousin and her aunt and uncle who had moved in 1913 and this would have been in the 40s now how did she get that address though the Lord showed it to her in a dream or a dream or Vision yes it was very it was plain she wrote it down immediately and yeah and it was that that specific I mean she would have known that she has relatives in Canada okay well she would have had no idea where they were yeah no but never mind um Edmonton Alberta and then 11818 67th Street I mean you know it was it was just and so it ended up being y'all's family and they kind of sponsored y'all yes they sent us a lot of care packages and um everything it was and coffee was one of the the Staples they said yes and you would think why would they send coffee you know but Mom said it was the best thing because you know all the bartering going on and the neighbor the next door neighbor was a baker and he first of all he loved coffee for himself but also he um he was very um why he sold it on the black market so he made money but in turn you know he had wheat and he he you know we got several loaves of bread for each pound of coffee so and uh so they were they were the ones that ended up helping y'all get to Canada yes they went to a Baptist Church it was a big Baptist church and they they sponsored a lot of German people he the the pastor he was he spoke German and English and he was very instrumental in helping many of the German people to come because even in the early 50s just in the Edmonton area they had approximately somewhere at least 60 000 German people it was like the the south side part was was now what made that such a popular place for everyone to well everywhere I mean Europe was overrun with refugees so they had to go somewhere and you know the The Americans and and Canadians I mean they did on they helped Europe unbelievably I mean I don't know if you're you're familiar at all with the Marshall Plan and and in every they helped oh Lord and I think even well every Feud if you just really dig into that a little bit about what all it all entailed the Marshall Plan was America was unbelievable in helping in helping Europe come to so do you have any like memories about coming over to Canada like when you got here I was 11. oh so you yeah you would yeah by the time you see we lived in Germany for for about uh for seven years than before we finally came but let me just share share something else that really happened with Mama is uh is one of the things that I really remember is you know when I got a little older I I would sleep in her bedroom you know I mean we had beds everywhere as you kind of position did y'all stay in the same building for all seven years of the same house same same house same place yeah it there was such a housing shortage it was but anyway I I do remember those 40s I would wake up in the night so often and she would be crying out to the Lord is is like I heard her pray that it was it was only the Lord that brought us through because I mean it was it was amazing but one of the things now that preacher really helped her a lot and he told her that she needed to pray through and the Lord would really answer and she had had quite a few Supernatural experiences her breakthrough came one night when in those early early 40s and she had been praying and it was dark and she said the room all lit up and she heard the audible voice of God and he quoted scripture to her about um one of them was yay I have loved you with an everlasting love and with loving kindness have I drawn you now it was so real to her that it because it was audible years later I remember I was talking to now this was all in German right and I was telling somebody about that scripture having been given to Mom and she was just passing by and I still see her she just stopped and she she didn't recognize the English version of it right well and she said what did you just tell her because as soon as you did she said everything it just came through me like like the power of God just struck me so what did you just tell her that's how real yeah how real it was yeah I remember standing in that kitchen it happened and then the other one he quoted three script scriptures to her that time and uh and the room was all light and then when he was over she said he placed his hand on her head and it the power of God just she felt the hands on her head and the power of God would strike her it was it was amazing I mean God just took care of us yeah for sure it was and we were taught we were taught to look for the supernatural and she always did so I mean I mean as you as a young girl for you to be you know laying in the same room as your mom praying and crying like that I mean that I mean I guess that's where you could have learned to like really pray I hurt you yes she was yeah and then when we came to Canada you know once they sponsored us and she it's still but you can imagine you're coming to a new country different language different Customs you don't know what is awaiting there was no income at all except you know my older siblings they by that time you know Adina art and Lydia had been there but then again she prayed and the Lord showed her and she heard kept seeing this hand and she heard him speak and she didn't know where where this was written and uh it and he said I no Ishmael it meant it was I will be the I will be I am the I am and she said she found it later in the scripture but it was the Luther translation and you know and that's uh he said I will be the I that that there is that is the yeah so that's God just really he really really we had to work very hard yeah but even as kids as you can imagine you know we had to go and uh and uh even as a preschooler I remember we had to go to the woods we have to get had to get gather Woods or we did a lot of gleaning after the farmers um when you know once they had dug the potatoes then we were free to go and do what you can get what we could yes and sometimes we would have a little bag full and you know but God always saw to it that we would we would you know we never we never went hungry and Mom she she almost could make something out of nothing you know yeah she was is that where you get your shoes from is your mom you like this she makes the best chicken skin and she's the one that got me hooked on coffee on coffee you were two years old I mean you've I mean really you've been a part of our family in Michigan a long time you've traveled the world with us yes yes she got me hooked that coffee on it I remember that table and this little guy that he thought I thought it was a big boy he drank coffee and you have been yeah whatever I'm addicted ever since so it's all thanks to you um yes I'm sure yeah you know it must have been I mean just a total like culture shock going culture it was gone from Germany to Canada it was yeah see I had I had all my in my basic schooling I finished I was in grade six by the time we came to Canada and um didn't understand a word of English so they they put us back into grade three just to learn yeah and then yeah but it didn't it took about two or three months and I was right back on yeah so there wasn't that wasn't much of a problem because as a as a young person it's surprising how quickly you do pick it up when you go back home do you still speak German to your family yeah I speak German very like but like they still speak it to them sometimes I don't even know which because I know like I'm saying Judith or do we call it Juju who is your niece yes um like when she when her mom calls her on the phone or something they both speak German to each other I know a lot of the time so yes that's why I didn't know yeah well we kept it up because when we were uh we went to a German English church Baptist Church okay they would have German services and in the morning and English in the evening so there again you know that's when you learn the because the Bible language is so different too yeah you know yeah for sure it was it it all worked out yeah but actually even the next the next Generation still speaks German yeah they do yeah um I want you to tell me about brother how you got to the services of brother Branham because it's a pretty I mean it's a pretty uh fascinating Story how God lined everything up for you able to get there and so like that and we have time for you to tell us I'd love for you to go ahead and tell that story and yes and how you uh were in his meetings Okay um that was in in 65 at the end of well that was in January 65. um actually by that time you know we had gone through quite a bit in in the Baptist Church well first of all we were always looking for more somehow there was that pole you know and and uh I will I remember just being a barely a teenager and the Baptist preacher announced for instance that he was going to preach on the Book of Revelation I was so excited I thought I thought I now I really want to be able to understand that yeah right and I can't even tell you how disappointed I was when after he had done that I thought I could have done better I I don't mean to be bragging there but I thought you know when you just read I thought there is even women preachers there is a deeper no but what I'm saying is you know there's a deeper meaning there than what he said for sure and you knew that I just felt that and so that and you're always looking for more there's just there's this part of God that you that you wanted to too and I remember when I first heard brother Brown I'm later on I thought I've heard that before I've you know when he said that I somehow it was like you know you always said that a voice within a voice well I know for me I thought yeah that just clicks that's that's the way it is you know but anyway so we had there was a great like a split in the Baptist Church after like in the 50s okay already and that was very hurtful even to that Pastor and everything it was to me it was very traumatic but the German people they opened up another church on the south side and there was only German so we went there for quite a while and then they branched out some more and so I they had asked us they didn't have a choir or anything you know so they asked us to sing for one month until they kind of got established and okay we agreed for about a month we would do it but that then that one month turned into six months and I wanted to go back to that other church I was you know it was just temporary and that's what they had told us and but I can see now you know that God was using these Stepping Stones so to speak for sure and you got kind of really disgruntled and that's how I was we were very open to that we got invited to go to this little skid row mission that was a woman preacher and it was God was moving you know and we went there and that's where I had a powerful experience with the Lord and that's how we got us out of Baptist Church so it was just one thing so then when y'all left you heard about well you had already heard about brother Brandon really but there in that little mission they were there was a problem because many of those people had heard brother Branham and he he knew what he said about women preachers so there was another stepping stone so my family was in and out in no time you know about a half a year yeah and that was okay but not me I thought I'm gonna I'm tired I'm tired of going here and There and Everywhere You Know it was it I knew I had experienced the Lord there and to me it didn't matter if the drunks were in the back you know it just didn't I knew that I was I was finally coming into a real relationship with the Lord yeah it was real that was in 63 and at the time at the time I was going I was finishing up my education I had to you know I had to quit because because and work to help contribute for our family to because times were very hard okay and so I would go back I would go to night school and you know I was always always studying going you know I was a bookworm anyway and so we I had gone I was in that Baptist College right there and that year I'll just quickly tell you that because because you will think it's funny okay here I am um 20. 20 21 something like that and uh so we would always have Chapel in the morning the whole of the it was also Seminary and and uh so we were all Gathering the chapel and I had a powerful I I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that during that those Christmas wow holidays okay so our first day back um we we all gathered there and then they said we're going to do something different today we are going to have all of all of you testify what you have experienced during these Christmas holidays and I was sitting at the very front to the left and I thought oh good I'll be the first one and I'll get it over with because I thought I I would have to testify what the Lord did had done for me well they said no we'll do something this different this time and we'll start at the back so I was happen to be the very last one and they all all testified about how you know they visited Raul their relatives and all the good times they had and you know one after the other and then when it came to me I said I have to tell you something entirely different because I experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I have found out that God is real just very short yeah short and the uh the dean he was so nonchalant about that if as if I had talked about the weather but it was like it just settled over everybody I after that I'm telling you they watched me like a hawk they had special classes they had special instructions that you automatically received the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you believe and and all this they tried to disprove me and and I mean sometimes they made fun I remember this whole this man he was saying I'm this is all leading up to here to brother Branham but he he was saying Alfreda are you saying now this was a senior in the Seminary he was graduating these two of them and I was sitting in the lunchroom this is minding my own business and he and he said are you trying to tell me that this precious brother of mine here doesn't have the Holy Ghost so he put me on the spot that's right and so I just looked at him I said I don't know what he has I'm just telling you what I received it's probably the best energy yes and that they but um after a while I only got to study in the library I was not allowed I don't know I know it was it was pretty it was quite an experience but anyway but you can see it was just stepping stones to go on and then the Lord so here I kept Faithfully going to that that mission and um then there was a group of people going to hear Brother Branham and uh I in Tucson right Phoenix in Phoenix in Phoenix it was in January in Phoenix and what happened was I was working but at that time I was working for the oil company and I had had previous service with them so so that really worked out very well but this time it was a cold cold uh winter terrible winter we had and the the conditions were very severe and what happened it was the winter I mean it was so cold then a chinook had blown in like a warm wind it turned warm and then we had rain and then everything froze again so the whole city was like an ice box skating rink and uh just even the highway there was a short distance of about a 20 minute travel I remember there were 180 vehicles in the ditch wow yeah it was so I'm just describing you how how when you have an appointment with God he will he will see to it it gets down and I knew I had to okay so that morning I didn't drive my brother drove me but he in turn he had to go to the consulate he got his Visa he's got it he got his passport and I had a doctor's appointment so he dropped me off so by this time it was about 10 o'clock in the morning and I kept contemplating I could have gone there I there's still an empty seat uh with these strangers but I would be able to go with them and then so I just made mention made mention that to the girl sitting beside me there lady and she said go you know why don't you go and she was so persistent and my boss was actually at a very important meeting and and I said listen he's not even here I can't even ask for permission to go and she said call him and finally I did okay and I asked him and that man he is left his important meeting he said I'll be right there he left that meeting and and then Within just and I called my brother within just a short time I had my vacation because I had had previous service with him so I had my two week vacation we got paid twice a month the the money came my check came in the day before so that was waiting for me and he called the Personnel Department right away and and he says yeah because I needed a letter from them stating that I was working there and I would be returning and I called my brother and I said would you please come and pick me up because I want to go and get my I had no valid passport okay so by quarter to 12 and the the embassy closed at 12. quarter to 12 I had the money I had the vacation I had I had my my passport everything you couldn't get your passport that fast nowadays yeah but I was a German citizen yeah at that time I wasn't even a Canadian yet really no and so so that's why I had to go to the Embassy and I got it and and by I think about two o'clock we were on the just you and your brother or who just you my brother and I we went with this couple and their boy so there was enough room for three days we traveled to Phoenix now what brother went with you Herbert yeah the dark one here oh no and then we got to brother Brown on some meetings now I they didn't know these people they didn't know that I was still going to that mission because they had been there and left okay so these people that I went with because they would not have taken me okay and so anyway with brother Branham and I at home they had the reel to reel they played that but they let me go to you know it was okay but I was drawn to it but but I just I just had to know it was it was very important to me that it would become Revelation to me that that was it so there was that whole series of meetings how many did you attend uh actually it was six six he preached seven but we didn't know because of what happened when he preached birth pains that um that I he had had that experience with a priest handing him the Bible so actually that was supposed to have been his last meeting he was not and we had to leave on the Monday okay okay so but brother Branham had returned and he had he had told them what that was all about okay so so I we we attended six services and actually there was a total of seven what was that like but it was amazing you know he um turned his back to people towards the ending you know he he didn't look at them he he said because uh people have said you know it's mental telepathy and all of this so or he's reading people's minds and that so he when there was a prayer line you know he said I'll turn my back to him and he would tell them anyway but yeah it was amazing I remember um the very first time there were I would say there must have been close to 3 000 people there at the hotel it was packed and talk about a noise talking talking talking I had my head down and all of a sudden it was like a hush came right over the whole audience that was I mean you're I'm just trying to give you a few details yeah no and and I thought what happened now you know and so here was brother Branham and he was greeting everybody on the platform and then he went to the pulpit and he said good evening friends you know and uh it was it was very special just just the atmosphere change in a moment yeah sure what was your feeling just sitting in there like well uh did it get better every night you went back or or well see I was going through the turmoil of having to leave that place you see I was still in going to that mission okay and I said Lord I'm so tired of this I had been fasting and praying that God would send the family back we would have a place to go to and uh and instead he got me out of there what happened it was I said Lord you will have to speak to me yeah you know you I I just can't I can't accept just anything you know these people were all all um Gung a hoe about brother Bannerman I loved what I heard don't get me wrong but would that mean that I would have to leave I said you would have to tell me Lord and I had that kind of a relationship with him it was it was very important to me so I as as the services went on and all of a sudden and that's how I perceived it I don't know it was my experience okay brother Branham was preaching all of a sudden suddenly he kind of stopped now you have to realize that we're about three thousand people and um it was like there was a connection between him and me I thought what just happened you know something was coming from him and he said lean not on your own understanding and he said if I were you I would not go back wow and I don't that's what I heard yeah okay and I can just tell you it was almost like a swish something just left him and touched me I felt something dropped like it's almost like something dropped from my eyes it was like my eyes were veiled before it and I felt it on my cheekbones just you know and I thought what just happened I had no idea but but that's a supernatural experience I had and from that moment on I knew I would not go back yeah I knew exactly God had answered my prayer that I needed to believe what that man was preaching for sure that's that's incredible yeah and I had no pull whatsoever to go back um and I loved it I loved it was there was there anything that like really stuck out to you about brother Branham or something I can tell you and yes I'll just share with you again and that it was um you know that Bishop Stanley is this still yeah that's fine okay Bishop Stanley was the the man who he was sitting on the front platform he were on the front row of the platform and brother banham had picked up the Bible and he had he had he was trying to find the the scripture about this day this scripture is fulfilled I think it was either he mentioned Luke 4 and and then he he said aren't or and Luke 16 or 17 I think and he couldn't find this scripture he had been looking for and uh and then he turned to Brother Moore I think behind him and he said isn't this the right one Etc and uh finally the priest gets up he had all of the his robes on you know and it was and he came over there and whispered something to brother Branham and handed him the Bible and um so then so he read it then and uh that's when he he spoke about all birth pains and Roy borders I think he had him preach before the service even began and he told of the incident you know when Alaska almost had that when he had thrown the rock up you're all familiar with that story and uh and right after that there was the Alaskan earthquake on Good Friday and that that was a terrible time okay so he spoke about that next was brother Brown and when that incident happened and he continued to preach about uh birth pains and then all of a sudden towards the end he was speaking about California and the condition that how sin was increasing and uh you know all the problems that they were having having when he did that all of a sudden this woman up at the front jumps up and begins to prophesy and she keeps saying like it was it I thought what is happening now here and you can hear it on the tape birth pains they in the books all they have written there was um a woman speaks in tongues that's all okay so they didn't it's never been printed right what she actually said but one of the things she said I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and she got louder and she really rolled her R's if you if you have you heard it yeah and then she kept saying them it's the message the message and she gets louder and she said the Judgment the judgment is coming and it is coming it is coming you know all all of that it was it was very powerful okay but then about a month later no the next day that's when brother Branham didn't really know what had really happened and the Lord had told him that when he read the scripture about that Jesus being in the synagogue and how he only read up to a certain point because it was the acceptable year of the Lord and then he did not read the time thing uh that part of the scripture that pertain to our day that the day of judgment you know is so all of that was transpiring in before us it was it was it was just amazing and so a month later brother Branham preached no when he came back the following day I I've just heard the tape okay he they allowed him to explain what had really happened so and and it's only about not not quite 30 minutes and but on there that woman prophesied again and uh it so you can hear that on the tape I knew normally I would not have um look for looked for it or anything but I because I had heard her and even um yes and even on my way back you know the people there they had they had told us that that was a pretty sister who had prophesied and apparently she had never spoken in tongues or prophesied before wow and a month later when brother Branham preached that this day this scripture is fulfilled then he referred to that again and yet just yesterday as I was reading that brother Branham said that she actually uh he had been discussing something with with Bishop Stanley up on the platform and he had just whispered it to him you know and they had not and and he said she prophesied what he they they were Whispering about wow yeah and she had never that's interesting yes it is as I thought another thing that happened in the service was with Florence shakarian and uh you know who she was I do yes okay now that was demus's sister and she was very ill at the doubt and uh she looked she I she wore this red dress she looked very Greek she was 42 years old and Demas came and she had a beautiful singing voice so he uh went and got her and they had her sing and she sang the song it's real it's real I know it's it's real okay and the second verse she she sang in tongues and the atmosphere now you have to realize I've come from Baptist background and just I had my own experience with the Lord I knew how powerful that was but um her whole body was shaking it and she's saying like it's the second verse in tongues wow yeah it was it was amazing okay the whole atmosphere changed and then people began to prophesy and the theme I remember there were three there may have been more but there was one lady that she was about two or three uh pews ahead of me you know so I heard her very well but in general it was all my daughter you will live and not die um and yet brother Brown I'mma have to go and tell Demas that she would not live that she would die within the year it would be between two and three o'clock in the morning and uh and uh you know that she was not so everything he had to say the exact opposite to what had transpired so I and it caused a lot of confusion as you can well imagine yeah for sure so and um but the priest Bishop Sandy he said all we have to do is just wait a year and see what happens well Florence died 10 months later between it was 20 to 3. and uh and I know he was with Carl Williams some brother Bonham was with her and he said something about can't you see her can't you see her and Carl says can't you see who you know he said it's Florence I see her climbing the golden stairs wow yeah so that so he she had she had passed away a young woman she was 42. yeah but so that was another another incident that happened was um you know that was also the time of the inauguration of President Johnson he had you know there had been that the Kennedy assassination and so he felt he completed that term and the next so that was his first his inauguration and he got really sick and everywhere on the news you heard well he had he was hospitalized and he had a bad case of the flu or whatever but they sent a telegram to brother Branham and asked him to pray for him because he had to have a heart attack [Music] you know that and that is documented as well you know in there so those are some of the things that were those the only set of meetings that you went to a brother yes he was yes because he died 11 months later yeah and and that was very that was very see and because of what had happened to me that experience see I didn't go back but we you know you also have to realize you hardly had any tapes so brother Martins this was like my brother's future uh father-in-law he he received all the realtor reels and because there was it was quite a group already they um he passed them around but so we got to keep them maybe for just a few days and then we had to pass them on okay I mean it's hard to believe you know but there was nothing to be had hardly anything in in writing it's crazy to think about it now you have it on your phone or on everything yes and crazy yeah and it was so we listened to that and in that whole summer okay I from January and brother Bonham died this December so that was 11 10 months 11 yeah months later I I remember when I heard brother Branham had passed away my reaction was not I mean I I thought it was terrible it was it was like a family member had just passed away but my reaction was this now what is going to happen what's going to happen about the White Eagle Ministry I heard him talk about about the seventh seal what about the Thunders what about the tent Vision what about the bride's Revival and to me everything was hinged on him yeah amen I was certain he's got to come back I mean I know that this is real God let me know that this is what I was to follow and what you know I mean that's your initial reaction and then it was it was very very hard but it didn't take too long and I realized God was going to do some other things yeah you know but there's a lot of people who have have you know follow that and they think yeah I mean there was so much there's a lot of people that are excited to hear this one a lot of the young people were really excited to hear this yeah but there's so much more you know what God has given us here and I heard a lot of your
