[1:18:26] isn't it

[1:18:30] with us this weekend
[1:18:33] what a joy
[1:18:38] what a sweet joy to have her with us and
[1:18:42] all of you
[1:18:43] we're just so thankful I was feeling a
[1:18:46] little bit down because there weren't
[1:18:48] too many planning to be here although I
[1:18:50] know that God look you don't have to
[1:18:52] preach to me I know that God knows
[1:18:55] before the foundation of the world I
[1:18:58] know all that but I'm a human being
[1:19:01] and I thought oh I don't want it to lose
[1:19:03] momentum coming up toward camp meeting
[1:19:06] and sister Rebecca met me there at the
[1:19:09] at the going out of my office on Tuesday
[1:19:11] night to tell me the family was coming
[1:19:13] and my steps got lighter and I went home
[1:19:16] and posted
[1:19:18] so welcome to all of them can we give
[1:19:21] God another hand type of bread you think
[1:19:25] he'll be tired of us I don't think so
[1:19:27] Praise Him
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:33] Hallelujah I woke up this morning with a
[1:19:36] particularly unusual anointing
[1:19:40] and I could it's not always tangible we
[1:19:43] don't always feel it but I did this
[1:19:46] morning and I felt it moving all over my
[1:19:48] body I I so appreciated I sat on the bed
[1:19:52] I told my wife I said there's an
[1:19:55] anointing on me and I don't know I don't
[1:19:57] understand it I don't even know what to
[1:19:59] do about it but I I said I I'm I'm
[1:20:03] thinking I I might ought to just stay
[1:20:05] home and not go over to the campground
[1:20:09] because if I go over there something
[1:20:11] will agitate me
[1:20:13] and I don't want to get out from under
[1:20:15] this anointing
[1:20:17] and uh she said well you do whatever you
[1:20:20] feel to do but I didn't want anybody to
[1:20:22] feel forsaken either but I was right
[1:20:28] so I had to go home and do some praying
[1:20:31] and uh as I was sitting in the chair uh
[1:20:35] this is not what what particularly got
[1:20:38] me but someone was sharing with me it it
[1:20:41] hurts my feelings I'm not an easily
[1:20:45] wounded person I've proven that to you
[1:20:48] in these 30 years but it hurts my
[1:20:51] feelings when someone chooses an
[1:20:54] absolute other than the word of God
[1:20:59] you know I I I'm worried about that I'm
[1:21:04] concerned about that
[1:21:06] it's dangerous talk
[1:21:09] it's not Bible talk it worries me and I
[1:21:13] just went home kind of in that mood how
[1:21:16] can people get so blind by the by the
[1:21:21] preaching all these years what has been
[1:21:25] said and the people buy into that and
[1:21:27] they just repeated and repeated and
[1:21:29] repeated and and sometimes you'll say
[1:21:31] well where is that in the message and
[1:21:33] they'll say oh it's got to be in there
[1:21:35] somewhere because so-and-so said it
[1:21:37] so we don't even treat things like we
[1:21:40] ought to we we ought to check each other
[1:21:43] come on
[1:21:44] we've got to take it back to the Bible
[1:21:48] your pastor can't be your absolute
[1:21:51] you know Moses was not my absolute
[1:21:57] it's my absolute
[1:21:59] so I was feeling a little just oh
[1:22:03] you know and and it sometimes
[1:22:06] frustration can lead to desperation but
[1:22:10] it's not the same
[1:22:13] the Lord spoke to me this week those
[1:22:15] words clearly
[1:22:17] frustration is not the same as
[1:22:19] desperation
[1:22:21] we're not asking to be frustrated we're
[1:22:24] asking God to make us desperate
[1:22:27] and anyway that was in my heart uh that
[1:22:29] because he had he had just really I was
[1:22:32] at my desk and he just spoke that to me
[1:22:34] in in prayer and I appreciated it but I
[1:22:37] was needing a little something and I I
[1:22:39] don't ever usually even check email on
[1:22:42] Saturday but I went to my email and a
[1:22:46] pastor that I've never heard from ever
[1:22:49] ever ever before
[1:22:51] don't really even know who he is we have
[1:22:56] mutual friends and his email was I just
[1:22:59] want to introduce myself to you we've
[1:23:01] been watching the services and we are so
[1:23:04] blessed and the thing we appreciate the
[1:23:07] most is that you're not making a profit
[1:23:10] an absolute but the word of God is the
[1:23:14] absolute I needed to hear that
[1:23:19] so we are not alone
[1:23:22] we are not alone in this there are
[1:23:24] others who have isolated themselves
[1:23:27] because of the blasphemy that comes out
[1:23:29] of Jeffersonville they have isolated
[1:23:32] themselves and God is stirring those
[1:23:35] people in this last day and I'm thankful
[1:23:38] for that
[1:23:39] Hebrews chapter 4
[1:23:42] I meant when I said blasphemy coming out
[1:23:45] of Jeffersonville I certainly didn't
[1:23:46] mean prior to 65.
[1:23:49] I mean in modern times
[1:23:53] in uh so I want to speak a little bit
[1:23:57] tonight as the Lord will let me and I
[1:24:00] want to ask you parents
[1:24:02] I almost did this Tuesday night and I I
[1:24:06] want to ask you parents to you know I
[1:24:10] don't know what the age limit should be
[1:24:12] but I think by the time someone is you
[1:24:16] know 13 or I think we could go way down
[1:24:20] more like seven or eight
[1:24:22] nine ten I'm not going to put an age
[1:24:24] limit on it I think they ought to be
[1:24:26] taught to stay awake
[1:24:31] I think you ought to teach them to stay
[1:24:33] awake and be alert in church
[1:24:36] you know when you're when you're if
[1:24:38] you're in the Jewish faith 13 years old
[1:24:40] you become a man
[1:24:42] and if you're a man you're old enough to
[1:24:44] learn to sit up
[1:24:46] and hear the word of God
[1:24:48] and show respect to the word if you
[1:24:51] don't respect your pastor that's between
[1:24:53] you and God but you don't have a choice
[1:24:55] about whether or not to respect the word
[1:24:58] it has preeminence above us all so I'm
[1:25:01] going to ask you parents to to just not
[1:25:03] nudge your children pinch them
[1:25:07] in love if they need it but maybe a
[1:25:09] nudge will get the job done and don't be
[1:25:11] a pillow for them
[1:25:12] because if you become a pillow they'll
[1:25:15] you I'll use it
[1:25:17] you know if I if you were to let me lean
[1:25:19] on your shoulder it wouldn't take me
[1:25:20] long to be asleep
[1:25:22] but I because of how I woke up this
[1:25:25] morning I have a feeling and it's just a
[1:25:29] it's just a just an inspiration that the
[1:25:32] Lord wants to talk to somebody
[1:25:34] I feel like I'm gonna need your help
[1:25:37] we've been a little sleepy the last few
[1:25:39] services and I feel like I can't do it
[1:25:41] without you I don't feel 100 physically
[1:25:44] and so I I really believe I'm going to
[1:25:47] have to depend on you all as well as the
[1:25:51] Lord I don't just mean loud I thank you
[1:25:54] for I need it but I mean in the faith
[1:25:56] pool you can silently pull in your faith
[1:26:01] God sees your Hungry Heart and he knows
[1:26:05] if you want to be spoken to is that
[1:26:07] right Hebrew I think I said four but I'm
[1:26:10] going to Hebrews chapter 3
[1:26:15] don't get turned off when you hear what
[1:26:17] I'm reading
[1:26:18] and I'm going to read beginning in verse
[1:26:21] 8. Harden not your hearts
[1:26:27] you know you you got to actively work on
[1:26:30] keeping your heart soft
[1:26:33] because it gets wounded it gets hurt
[1:26:36] there's always misunderstandings in
[1:26:38] among people and you've got to keep you
[1:26:42] know there's only one way I know of to
[1:26:43] keep it from getting hard and that is
[1:26:46] keep pouring oil on it
[1:26:48] there's oil it out
[1:26:50] let the Holy Spirit the oil of God just
[1:26:54] keep pouring that on there so that it
[1:26:57] will not be hard Harden not your hearts
[1:26:59] as in the provocation in the day of
[1:27:03] Temptation in the wilderness
[1:27:06] when your fathers tempted me proved me
[1:27:10] and saw my Works how long
[1:27:14] 40 years
[1:27:17] wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:27:20] generation
[1:27:22] and said they do alway err
[1:27:27] in their heart
[1:27:30] air
[1:27:32] it's a short way of saying error
[1:27:37] they do always err in their heart and
[1:27:42] they have not known my ways with 40
[1:27:46] years under a Vindicated Prophet that
[1:27:51] God spoke to lip to ear they saw the
[1:27:56] supernatural every day of their lives I
[1:28:01] had you to read those scriptures a few
[1:28:03] weeks ago when they got hungry God fed
[1:28:06] them when they got thirsty he gave them
[1:28:08] water when they wanted the menu to
[1:28:10] change he changed them in you
[1:28:12] and yet the word of the Lord is they
[1:28:17] have not known my ways
[1:28:21] we're not going to be that kind of a
[1:28:23] people
[1:28:24] so I swear in my wrath this is God they
[1:28:28] shall not enter into my ring they shall
[1:28:33] not enter into my rest they may have sat
[1:28:37] in every service that Moses was
[1:28:39] preaching
[1:28:40] but because there was something going on
[1:28:44] in their heart
[1:28:46] and they wouldn't allow the word of God
[1:28:49] to reveal what was going on in their
[1:28:51] heart they shut it out
[1:28:53] they didn't allow that word of God to
[1:28:56] get in and start searching and sifting
[1:28:59] through them they shut it out and so God
[1:29:03] says because because of this he said
[1:29:07] they shall not enter into my rest
[1:29:11] and why because they have not known my
[1:29:14] ways
[1:29:15] my ways
[1:29:18] are you here
[1:29:21] so he goes on to say take heed brethren
[1:29:26] lest there be in any of you
[1:29:30] an evil heart
[1:29:31] of unbelief
[1:29:34] departing
[1:29:36] from the Living God
[1:29:38] remember how he started out don't Harden
[1:29:41] your heart
[1:29:42] keep your heart soft
[1:29:44] come on now
[1:29:46] you know I once had a man I know I'm
[1:29:48] reading I once had a man say to me in in
[1:29:52] our church
[1:29:54] he said now I don't want you giving my
[1:29:59] family a word from the Lord without my
[1:30:03] permission
[1:30:07] I said
[1:30:09] God bless you brother you won't have to
[1:30:12] worry about it
[1:30:15] I will not go against that Authority
[1:30:19] I said does that include your wife too
[1:30:24] now
[1:30:25] there was a problem there wasn't there
[1:30:27] he didn't have Pro he didn't have
[1:30:29] confidence in me
[1:30:31] call me as pastor but he didn't have any
[1:30:33] confidence in me he said if you've got a
[1:30:35] word
[1:30:36] for my family you come and tell me
[1:30:40] and then if I feel too I'll go with you
[1:30:44] and you can say it to them
[1:30:47] and I said well you won't have to worry
[1:30:49] about that brother I won't speak into
[1:30:51] their lives the responsibility is now
[1:30:55] yours
[1:30:56] I wash my hands of that responsibility
[1:31:01] your heart is hard you've hardened your
[1:31:05] heart how many of you have ever felt
[1:31:07] your heart getting hard
[1:31:10] it feels like numbness
[1:31:12] it starts off numbness and then you feel
[1:31:15] things bouncing off of you that ought to
[1:31:18] be penetrating you so don't let anybody
[1:31:21] say to your neighbor there I I don't
[1:31:24] know what that feels I don't know if my
[1:31:26] heart has ever been hard you know you
[1:31:28] know deny you're sitting in this room
[1:31:30] tonight and you know right now if you've
[1:31:33] hardened your heart
[1:31:35] nobody has to tell you if your heart's
[1:31:37] hard Hello I'm am I
[1:31:40] can I smile
[1:31:43] I uh I was a pain I was in pain God when
[1:31:47] I got here and uh I I come out of there
[1:31:50] and I was walking on the sore foot and I
[1:31:53] said I feel kind of like a grouchy old
[1:31:55] man but I put on the best smile I had
[1:31:57] for for Solomon and Zion they were
[1:31:59] sitting there I put on the best smile
[1:32:01] and waved and went back and hugged them
[1:32:03] and I said I feel like a grumpy old man
[1:32:05] did I fool you with my smile
[1:32:08] sometimes we just have to smile
[1:32:11] I'm calling on you to smile
[1:32:14] even if you feel a little under the
[1:32:16] microscope
[1:32:17] why not
[1:32:20] I've been under it with him this week
[1:32:22] shouldn't we all really want that place
[1:32:25] we should we should I'll let you sit
[1:32:28] down just a moment take heed Brethren
[1:32:31] lest there be an any of you an evil
[1:32:34] heart
[1:32:36] of unbelief
[1:32:38] something as simple as unbelief can
[1:32:41] cause the heart to to be not only
[1:32:45] hardened
[1:32:47] faithful
[1:32:48] oh that that really Grieves me somehow I
[1:32:52] don't want that
[1:32:54] I don't want that and and listen he said
[1:32:57] uh let me start said take heed Brethren
[1:33:00] unless there be in any of you an evil
[1:33:02] heart of unbelief in the party
[1:33:04] from the Living God
[1:33:07] you start pulling away from him and you
[1:33:10] don't even realize
[1:33:12] you're trying to show somebody else
[1:33:14] you're mad at them or you're trying to
[1:33:16] show somebody else they've hurt your
[1:33:18] feelings and by letting that get in your
[1:33:20] heart you're really pulling away from
[1:33:23] the Lord
[1:33:26] how can you say that because we're not
[1:33:28] doing what he told us to do
[1:33:30] but but exhort one another daily
[1:33:37] don't you think you can live this two
[1:33:39] nights a week
[1:33:40] two days a week
[1:33:42] and not get no more daily
[1:33:45] while it is called today
[1:33:49] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:33:54] deceitfulness of sin
[1:33:57] lest you be caught up in sin and
[1:34:00] unbelief and not even know it because
[1:34:02] that stuff is deceitful
[1:34:05] it never announces itself when it comes
[1:34:08] in it just slips in
[1:34:11] and it starts taking a hold
[1:34:14] and it spreads through a family through
[1:34:18] a community through through through a a
[1:34:21] region even look at our mess
[1:34:26] look at our Mass right now in our
[1:34:29] country
[1:34:30] but exhort one another daily while it is
[1:34:33] called today lest any of you be hardened
[1:34:36] through the deceivleness of sin for we
[1:34:38] are this is so powerful
[1:34:40] for we are made
[1:34:44] par takers of Christ co-participants
[1:34:52] with him that doesn't just mean we're
[1:34:55] taking from him it means we are
[1:34:57] partnering with him because there is a
[1:35:01] union that is found in a relationship
[1:35:04] with him if we hold the beginning of our
[1:35:09] confidence
[1:35:11] steadfast
[1:35:12] until the end has he ever failed you
[1:35:16] has God ever failed anybody in here I
[1:35:19] didn't ask you if you ever failed him I
[1:35:21] said has he ever failed you no there's
[1:35:23] no way to believe no reason to believe
[1:35:25] no no excuse to believe that he'd ever
[1:35:27] fail us now can you stand for two more
[1:35:30] verses
[1:35:31] Hebrews 4 11 and 12. now that was
[1:35:35] Hebrews 3
[1:35:37] and you know when I get in Hebrews I
[1:35:39] want to read the whole chapter
[1:35:40] but I didn't
[1:35:42] let us labor therefore
[1:35:46] again this is the most paradoxical
[1:35:50] sentence in the Bible probably one of
[1:35:52] the most let us labor therefore to enter
[1:35:57] into that rest
[1:36:00] even rest doesn't come automatic
[1:36:04] there's a requirement
[1:36:06] to find rest
[1:36:08] lest any man fall
[1:36:11] after the same example of unbelief now
[1:36:15] remember what example he's talking about
[1:36:17] the children of Israel do you hear every
[1:36:19] little prophetic utterance every
[1:36:21] spiritual exhortation that was given
[1:36:24] tonight all referred us back to the
[1:36:26] children of Israel every one of them
[1:36:36] afford to enter into that rest lest any
[1:36:39] man fall after the same example of
[1:36:41] unbelief for the word of God is quick
[1:36:47] and Powerful
[1:36:50] and sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:36:55] commentator say a two-edged sword is so
[1:37:00] designed that it on the draw
[1:37:04] it can cut coming out just like it cuts
[1:37:08] going in
[1:37:10] how many of you know the word it does
[1:37:13] that to us sometimes it cuts going in
[1:37:16] and it cuts going out but you know what
[1:37:19] he does he takes that same cutting word
[1:37:22] lays that blade right in the fire
[1:37:25] has he ever done it for you and then
[1:37:28] lays it on the wound
[1:37:29] he cauterizes the wounds heals you up
[1:37:33] and makes you stronger than you ever
[1:37:35] were before for the word of God is quick
[1:37:37] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:37:39] two-edged sword piercing this is so
[1:37:42] important here piercing even to the
[1:37:46] dividing asunder
[1:37:50] of soul mind will and emotions and
[1:37:53] spirit
[1:37:55] and whether we realize it or not this is
[1:37:57] the greatest question that all of us
[1:37:59] have in our life
[1:38:00] is that me
[1:38:03] or is that him
[1:38:08] am I the only one ever asked that Lord
[1:38:09] is that you or is that me is that you is
[1:38:12] that me I know what I'm feeling but is
[1:38:14] that you or is that me I know what I'm
[1:38:16] hearing but is that you or is that me
[1:38:18] there's only one answer there's only one
[1:38:20] answer
[1:38:21] there's only one thing to answer that
[1:38:23] it's the word of God because that word
[1:38:26] of God the edge of that two-edged sword
[1:38:28] is so fine and so sharp that you will
[1:38:33] cut yourself before you see the edge
[1:38:36] that's that's sharpened it it's like
[1:38:38] those cactus needle you they're the
[1:38:41] jumping cactus that Cactus don't jump
[1:38:44] you know why they call it the jumping
[1:38:46] cactus because the end of the knee the
[1:38:48] the uh what I call them needles is that
[1:38:51] what they say say it's so sharp and so
[1:38:54] fine that you don't see it and so you
[1:38:57] think you're gonna just test the end and
[1:38:59] you've already got on it it's already
[1:39:02] stuck in you before you ever thought you
[1:39:04] were getting to that that thing it's
[1:39:05] that fi the word of God can so be so
[1:39:09] fine and so sharp that it can get down
[1:39:12] in there and it can divide from the
[1:39:15] regenerated Spirit and the and the mind
[1:39:18] the will and the emotion and it can
[1:39:21] separate that for us so that we can say
[1:39:24] I am truly following the spirit of the
[1:39:26] Lord instead of my mind my will and my
[1:39:29] emotions how many of you just say word
[1:39:32] of God come on come on word of God come
[1:39:35] on word of God and do that for us
[1:39:38] and of the joints and Marrow
[1:39:42] get down into the marrow of the bone and
[1:39:46] is a discerner
[1:39:49] I don't know why people in the prophetic
[1:39:52] Church the first thing they think is
[1:39:56] somebody's been talking to somebody I
[1:39:58] know they talk
[1:40:01] but why would people in a church that
[1:40:03] had an edge of the prophetic why would
[1:40:05] that be your first thought
[1:40:07] don't you believe that God can speak to
[1:40:10] you in and don't you know he knew your
[1:40:13] conversations on the way over here
[1:40:15] tonight don't he don't you know he sat
[1:40:18] for you this week and has heard what
[1:40:21] you've said
[1:40:22] and he knows exactly how to speak to
[1:40:25] your need because he loves you and you
[1:40:28] are his
[1:40:29] and he doesn't want your heart to be
[1:40:31] hard and he doesn't want you following
[1:40:33] in falling falling in to any form of
[1:40:37] unbelief
[1:40:38] Lord we ask you right now to come and
[1:40:41] help us in your word bless your people
[1:40:46] strengthen your people anoint your
[1:40:49] people to receive the word come by the
[1:40:53] Holy Ghost and say Amen Lord perform

[1:41:14] I I woke up this morning realizing we
[1:41:18] are right back to where we started
[1:41:21] before

[1:41:26] not to get it now
[1:41:29] we've got to get it we've got to embrace
[1:41:31] this truth
[1:41:33] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:36] Christ anoint us all because your word
[1:41:39] is already anointed and the Saints said

[1:42:27] to save my energy if you you'll do it
[1:42:29] for me I know you'll do a good job
[1:42:33] let us therefore be zealous and exert
[1:42:36] ourselves and strive diligently to enter
[1:42:39] that rest all right you've got a slow
[1:42:41] day on you're doing a fine job but this
[1:42:44] is the way that works I get to interrupt
[1:42:46] you multiple times
[1:42:48] see that's how they do it at the
[1:42:50] African-American church and tonight
[1:42:52] we're going to be African-American and
[1:42:54] we're we're going to let us let us

[1:43:25] four now go ahead start over
[1:43:31] let us therefore be zealous and exert
[1:43:35] ourselves and strive diligently to enter
[1:43:38] that rest of God to know and experience
[1:43:42] it for ourselves look at that
[1:43:46] does that make any sense to anybody does
[1:43:50] that help anybody
[1:43:52] it amplifies it doesn't it King James
[1:43:55] said let us labor therefore to enter
[1:43:57] into that rest lest any man fall after
[1:44:00] the same example of me but look how the
[1:44:01] Amplified let us therefore be zealous
[1:44:05] desert ourselves
[1:44:08] strive how
[1:44:10] diligently to enter that rest
[1:44:14] what rest the rest of God to know and
[1:44:18] experience it
[1:44:20] for ourselves read on
[1:44:22] that no one may fall or perish by the
[1:44:27] same kind of unbelief and disobedience
[1:44:30] into which those in the wilderness fail
[1:44:34] do you understand why the warning or the
[1:44:38] admonition is coming to prevent any any
[1:44:43] of us from falling or even perishing
[1:44:47] under the same kind of unbelief and
[1:44:50] Disobedience into those switches so this
[1:44:52] is really they are an example to us as
[1:44:55] Paul said in in another place go on
[1:45:00] for the word of that God speaks start
[1:45:03] over for the word that God's word for
[1:45:07] the word that God speaks is alive and
[1:45:11] full of power making it active wait a
[1:45:15] minute
[1:45:18] it's alive
[1:45:24] for the word of God
[1:45:26] is alive for the word that's that God
[1:45:29] speaks
[1:45:31] is alive and full of power
[1:45:36] now David is going to tell you what that
[1:45:39] full of power means
[1:45:40] making it active active say it with us
[1:45:43] active
[1:45:45] operative operative
[1:45:47] energizing energizing and effective
[1:45:52] I love this word
[1:45:54] who could not love this word
[1:46:01] it is active it is energizing it is
[1:46:05] effective
[1:46:07] tell us more it is sharper than any
[1:46:11] two-edged sword
[1:46:12] penetrating to the dividing line of the
[1:46:15] Breath of Life Soul and the immortal
[1:46:18] spirit and of the joints and Marrow of
[1:46:22] the deepest parts of our nature let's go
[1:46:25] back we've got to see if we can
[1:46:26] understand that that word of God Is So
[1:46:29] active so operative so energizing and so
[1:46:31] effective it is so sharp that it can
[1:46:35] penetrate to the very dividing line of
[1:46:39] the Soul which is the breath of life
[1:46:41] that God you know God breathed breath
[1:46:44] into man and he became a living soul and
[1:46:47] the immortal Spirit which is your human
[1:46:50] spirit that has been regenerated by his
[1:46:54] eternal spirit
[1:46:56] so really that is that is as much as
[1:46:59] saying that word can divide between you
[1:47:02] and God
[1:47:03] so that you are able to always know by
[1:47:07] the word
[1:47:09] by the absolute
[1:47:11] [Applause]
[1:47:15] if this is you
[1:47:17] or if this is God
[1:47:20] now I'm a person who believes that God
[1:47:23] is capable of doing things that are not
[1:47:25] written in this word
[1:47:27] but I will tell you this he will never
[1:47:29] do anything that is contrary
[1:47:35] to this word never ever ever ever all
[1:47:38] right so it gets down in there between
[1:47:40] the Breath of Life Soul and the immortal
[1:47:42] Spirit go go on for us would you and of
[1:47:45] and of the joints and Marrow of the
[1:47:48] deepest parts of our nature
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] now remember in Matthew Chapter 7
[1:47:58] when the Bible says judge not
[1:48:02] that you be not judged for with what
[1:48:05] measure you meet it shall be meant to
[1:48:08] you
[1:48:10] in other words if you're if you judge
[1:48:13] you're going to be judged well what
[1:48:14] about the scriptures who say a righteous
[1:48:17] man or spiritual man judgeth all things
[1:48:19] what about scriptures that tell us there
[1:48:22] are times that we are to judge well the
[1:48:25] only thing that we can judge is whether
[1:48:28] or not something is bringing forth the
[1:48:30] fruit of the word
[1:48:33] if it is we say check mark
[1:48:36] if it's not bringing forth the fruit
[1:48:38] that the word produces we say
[1:48:42] that's the word is the absolute
[1:48:47] right gotta lay there
[1:48:50] so if if you say if you come to me like
[1:48:53] some half already married and say uh I
[1:48:56] believe the Lord's telling me to to get
[1:48:58] married again and and you say the Lord
[1:49:01] told me well then you put me in a bad
[1:49:03] place and I have to tell you well I
[1:49:06] don't know if it's the Lord or not I
[1:49:07] just know what his word said you may
[1:49:09] have to do like you do I can't stop you
[1:49:12] from that but you know what I can't have
[1:49:14] full confidence in somebody telling me
[1:49:17] something that's against God's word I
[1:49:20] have to watch that
[1:49:22] I have to watch that I've had that
[1:49:24] happen multiple times through the years
[1:49:26] so I have to look to the word does the
[1:49:29] word say thumbs up no
[1:49:32] the word says
[1:49:34] so I have to take the word so make it
[1:49:37] personal in your life maybe something a
[1:49:40] dream you have a goal you have something
[1:49:42] you'd like to do something you'd like to
[1:49:44] accomplish where you take that back to
[1:49:46] the word
[1:49:48] sometimes that's not always the easiest
[1:49:51] thing to do that's why we're so glad to
[1:49:54] have the Holy Ghost
[1:49:55] oh because he will help us to find the
[1:49:59] answers that we need in that Living Word
[1:50:01] he'll get right down into the deepest
[1:50:04] parts of our nature because sometimes
[1:50:07] we've got some nature left
[1:50:10] we've got some human nature left in US
[1:50:12] hello
[1:50:14] and we need something to get right down
[1:50:16] in there and do some dividing Now read
[1:50:18] on David I'm not trying to chop you up
[1:50:20] I'm really not I just want to make sure
[1:50:23] we get this
[1:50:25] exposing and shifting and analyzing
[1:50:30] 15.
[1:50:32] careful
[1:50:34] read again exposing and sifting and
[1:50:39] analyzing
[1:50:41] and judging now that's a lot
[1:50:44] that amplifies it pretty good for me
[1:50:47] that word gets down in there and it
[1:50:50] exposes and it sifts
[1:50:54] you see when we read that verse it says
[1:50:56] judge not that you be not judged if you
[1:50:59] look at the original Greek you'll find
[1:51:01] out that it's talking about judging
[1:51:03] another person's motives
[1:51:06] we have the right to judge fruit
[1:51:09] if it's according to the work
[1:51:13] that's judging
[1:51:15] if it's not according to the work
[1:51:18] anybody with me tonight I think you are
[1:51:22] so whatever the word says
[1:51:26] but the Bible tells us what we can't
[1:51:28] judge is somebody's motive
[1:51:32] now how many times this week have you
[1:51:34] said
[1:51:38] well I know why I know why he did that
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] well I know why she said that
[1:51:48] I know why they handled it that way
[1:51:53] now when you do that you're doing the
[1:51:55] very thing that Jesus told us not to do
[1:51:58] when he said judge not that you be not
[1:52:00] judged he's speaking about judging
[1:52:03] another man's motives and you know you
[1:52:06] may be right
[1:52:08] you may be right
[1:52:09] that may be exactly why she said it but
[1:52:13] here is what Jesus would say from his
[1:52:15] word that is none of your business
[1:52:20] somebody said I didn't read that in the
[1:52:22] word I did
[1:52:23] he said what is that to you
[1:52:28] remember if I would that he tarry till I
[1:52:31] come remember the other Apostle what
[1:52:34] about John Lord what about John what
[1:52:36] about John Lord
[1:52:38] who's done that this week don't raise
[1:52:39] your hand
[1:52:41] what about him what about her
[1:52:44] I want to tell you something some of you
[1:52:47] ought to have no time at all to be
[1:52:49] examining somebody else's stuff
[1:52:53] cause yours is stinking everywhere
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] it gets that way sometime
[1:53:01] and when our own life is the stinkiest
[1:53:05] is sometimes when we feel like we've got
[1:53:08] to start examining somebody else's
[1:53:10] motive
[1:53:11] every time you hear that scripture judge
[1:53:14] not that you be not judged remember it's
[1:53:16] judging another man or another woman's
[1:53:18] motive you might be exactly right
[1:53:21] but the question is what is that to you
[1:53:26] you might be absolutely wrong
[1:53:29] my favorite example was my good friend
[1:53:32] Paul Kane who was with us this week
[1:53:36] however many years ago this is the
[1:53:37] anniversary week of him being here the
[1:53:40] last time of the of the two times he was
[1:53:42] here I can hear him saying right now I
[1:53:45] like this Pulpit there's room to walk
[1:53:46] around up here I like this I can see him
[1:53:49] doing that but he would always say and
[1:53:53] it is the truth that he said I had such
[1:53:56] a complex
[1:53:57] because I had been talked about so much
[1:54:01] and he said I had such a complex that if
[1:54:05] if I saw people talking I I just knew
[1:54:09] they were talking about me and if I
[1:54:11] walked in and they all got quiet now
[1:54:14] listen you know just because somebody's
[1:54:16] quiet when you come in don't mean it's
[1:54:17] about you it may mean they don't want
[1:54:20] you to hear it because it's none of your
[1:54:23] business
[1:54:25] that's not personal
[1:54:28] that may not be against you it might be
[1:54:32] to protect you
[1:54:38] it might be for your good that somebody
[1:54:41] doesn't want you to know
[1:54:43] might not be
[1:54:45] there are people who love secrets
[1:54:48] I don't trust those people
[1:54:52] I don't trust them
[1:54:54] I'd rather be transparent
[1:54:58] I would rather you know something bad
[1:55:00] about me
[1:55:01] I would
[1:55:02] I figure we can deal with that
[1:55:05] I can repent you can forgive me if you
[1:55:07] want to don't if you don't want to and
[1:55:09] we'll go on but I don't want to hide I
[1:55:12] don't want to hide
[1:55:13] I don't want to live my life incognito
[1:55:16] I don't want you to live your life that
[1:55:18] way
[1:55:19] don't you let the devil torment you but
[1:55:22] I know that I've heard what they said
[1:55:24] and I know they talk about they may have
[1:55:27] but don't assume that because you walk
[1:55:30] into a room and people look at you and
[1:55:32] they Huss that they were talking about
[1:55:33] you in that moment and papa Paul said to
[1:55:36] me I I'm the worst
[1:55:38] and then he made the joke that you've
[1:55:39] heard me make so many times he said I
[1:55:41] had to quit going to the football game
[1:55:44] because he said when I got the football
[1:55:46] game and saw the teams down there in a
[1:55:48] huddle
[1:55:50] he said I just knew they were talking
[1:55:52] about me
[1:55:54] now he made that a joke
[1:55:57] but I was around him enough
[1:55:59] and got emails from him enough in 52
[1:56:03] Point font
[1:56:06] this is how we emailed each other for
[1:56:07] the last years of his life in letters
[1:56:10] that big
[1:56:11] he said I always like your emails
[1:56:13] because they always come big enough for
[1:56:15] me to read I don't ever have to string
[1:56:17] to read them
[1:56:18] and in every one of those I would hear
[1:56:20] the paranoia
[1:56:23] in his voice
[1:56:25] reading his text I could hear him
[1:56:28] panicked paranoid he was absolutely
[1:56:33] right he had been maligned he had been
[1:56:35] lied about some of you know that that
[1:56:38] that we paid a ticket
[1:56:41] and brought someone here one time who
[1:56:44] had lied against him
[1:56:46] and sat back there in the office and let
[1:56:49] this young man face him
[1:56:52] and he wilted like a little flower and
[1:56:55] said I lied
[1:56:57] we said you didn't just lie you lied to
[1:57:00] leaders
[1:57:02] maybe you've heard the name Mike Bickel
[1:57:05] you've lied to leaders
[1:57:08] you've lied to people of influence
[1:57:11] and now you the damage is done
[1:57:15] and all we can do is clean it up in this
[1:57:17] room but we can we can we can only pray
[1:57:20] that the effects of that will be
[1:57:22] mitigated but that stuff went around
[1:57:25] until even after his death uh there were
[1:57:28] just hideous things he was paranoid
[1:57:31] there's no room for you and I to move in
[1:57:35] paranoia
[1:57:39] we can't judge one another's motives you
[1:57:43] may think you know why somebody does
[1:57:45] what they do but there's only one thing
[1:57:48] that can get down into the base nature
[1:57:51] of a man come on thank God for this word
[1:57:55] thank God for this word
[1:57:58] because it searches us
[1:58:01] it searches us you know my encounter
[1:58:04] you know the White Eagle that came into
[1:58:07] my room some years ago I was sleeping
[1:58:10] there with a with a bare chest in my bed
[1:58:14] next to my wife I wake up on my back
[1:58:17] which I rarely in those days slept on my
[1:58:19] back I have to now that must be noisy
[1:58:22] but I have to now
[1:58:24] but in those days I always slept on my
[1:58:27] side
[1:58:27] uh and sometimes on my stomach like that
[1:58:31] this night I was so tired I fell asleep
[1:58:33] before I could get positioned I wake up
[1:58:36] and I see two red lights
[1:58:40] on my bare chest two red
[1:58:44] laser lights
[1:58:46] and a fear struck me because I had seen
[1:58:50] enough movies in the past
[1:58:55] to know that ain't a good thing
[1:58:57] that means you are in somebody's sights
[1:59:01] and the next the next thing that
[1:59:03] happened ain't good
[1:59:07] that means a bullet comes next
[1:59:10] but there was such a presence
[1:59:13] that I looked up and over my bed was a
[1:59:16] was a huge king-size bed
[1:59:20] stretched the edges of the of the bed
[1:59:23] just filled up the up above the bed a
[1:59:26] white eagle
[1:59:28] and he was looking down
[1:59:31] on my chest with those penetrating red
[1:59:35] laser light eyes
[1:59:37] and I knew that whatever that
[1:59:39] represented in that moment I there was
[1:59:42] no secret from him
[1:59:44] whatever that was there was no hiding
[1:59:48] you know my testimony being in Arizona
[1:59:51] at a conference that I was invited as a
[1:59:53] guest where they were going to repent
[1:59:56] charismatic movement was going to repent
[1:59:59] for how they had maligned brother
[2:00:01] Branham and and A.A Allen
[2:00:04] and they invited me to come as a guest
[2:00:06] and I'm sitting there on a chair and a
[2:00:10] lightning bolt I'm telling you it was a
[2:00:13] lightning bolt from eternity struck my
[2:00:15] chair
[2:00:17] right between my legs
[2:00:20] my legs were spread like that as you
[2:00:22] would sit on a folding chair and and
[2:00:24] there was just enough of that folding
[2:00:26] chair exposed that that lightning of God
[2:00:29] came and struck that
[2:00:31] and later a friend that I had confidence
[2:00:34] in he said that was God observing your
[2:00:38] base nature
[2:00:40] there is nothing about you that God
[2:00:43] hasn't discerned
[2:00:49] it's a good thing
[2:00:51] don't take it as a negative thing
[2:00:54] take it as a positive thing because this
[2:00:57] is the only thing that can judge your
[2:00:59] motive
[2:01:00] and it's also the only tool that can cut
[2:01:03] you up
[2:01:04] and get every root out of you that
[2:01:06] doesn't need to be there and heal you
[2:01:08] too same sword
[2:01:10] same sword that performs the surgery
[2:01:12] laid against us in the spirit and seals
[2:01:16] up the wound cauterizes the wound so
[2:01:19] that we can heal Church we're blessed to
[2:01:24] have this Living Word it's active
[2:01:26] operative energizing and effective come
[2:01:29] on and it exposes and sifts and analyzes
[2:01:33] and judges the very thoughts
[2:01:36] and read on David
[2:01:39] and and purposes of the heart see
[2:01:43] you and I have no right to analyze the
[2:01:46] purposes of someone's heart
[2:01:48] or to judge what makes someone tick or
[2:01:52] to analyze why someone did listen this
[2:01:55] is such good advice did you know this
[2:01:57] could heal your marriage
[2:01:59] did you know this doesn't only work for
[2:02:02] church business this is this is healing
[2:02:04] for a marriage I've lived with him long
[2:02:09] enough tonight
[2:02:13] there ain't nothing about her that I
[2:02:16] don't know
[2:02:18] her up one
[2:02:20] on the next
[2:02:22] but I know what she really means
[2:02:30] how many times this week as a husband
[2:02:32] said to a wife I know what you mean
[2:02:36] how many times this week has a wife said
[2:02:39] to her husband I heard what you said
[2:02:41] but I know what you meant
[2:02:45] I don't have no hands up
[2:02:47] but I see red cheeks glory be to God the
[2:02:51] Holy Ghost is on the case
[2:02:53] cause I see blushing going on
[2:02:57] somebody knows what I'm saying is right
[2:03:00] we can't even do that with our own
[2:03:02] companion
[2:03:03] you may be right you may know her better
[2:03:06] than anybody on this planet knows her
[2:03:08] but God did not give you the grace to be
[2:03:11] able to see the intents of her heart
[2:03:15] God did not give you the gift to be able
[2:03:18] to discern between Soul and Spirit
[2:03:20] there's only one force
[2:03:23] and that's not 40 Years of Living With
[2:03:26] Somebody
[2:03:27] there's only one force
[2:03:29] that can get down to the nitty-gritty
[2:03:37] and that's the word
[2:03:39] I read we're an African brother this
[2:03:41] week uh was talking and he said he said
[2:03:44] uh we were my family was sitting down
[2:03:47] reading the Bible
[2:03:49] and he said my son was using the same
[2:03:53] hand to turn the pages of the Bible that
[2:03:55] he was using to pick his fingers and his
[2:03:57] toes
[2:04:00] this is how How African people look at
[2:04:03] things
[2:04:04] and he said I corrected him and I said
[2:04:06] go wash your hands
[2:04:10] I don't know if that's necessary
[2:04:13] remember I told you that I had to redo
[2:04:16] my whole program
[2:04:18] in India
[2:04:20] because I was preaching on the
[2:04:22] television in India and I'm PR for a fat
[2:04:25] man I'm pretty flexible
[2:04:31] not everybody can lay that leg flat like
[2:04:34] that
[2:04:35] sums up like that you know me
[2:04:38] I don't know why I was built that way
[2:04:40] but I was using my leg as my Bible prop
[2:04:45] and the Indian Church felt like that the
[2:04:48] Bible was getting too close to my foot
[2:04:50] my shoe
[2:04:52] and they were offended by it
[2:04:54] so I had to change my posture
[2:04:57] I grew up with a family who didn't
[2:04:59] believe in laying their Bible on the
[2:05:01] ground
[2:05:04] and to this day I catch myself laying
[2:05:07] something on top of my Bible and and not
[2:05:10] religiously I don't repent and go
[2:05:12] through a whole process of forgiveness
[2:05:16] I just did it you know not conscious
[2:05:18] conscious of it but when I see it I to
[2:05:21] this day will pick something up and take
[2:05:23] it off my Bible so they can sit there we
[2:05:26] if and and I'm not I'm not making a
[2:05:29] Doctrine on that because that's only the
[2:05:31] written record of the word there's
[2:05:33] something more precious on the inside of
[2:05:35] you you who have received the word hello
[2:05:38] and if we should be so so obliged to to
[2:05:42] honor a book how much more
[2:05:46] how much more should we respect the
[2:05:49] Living Word of God when it's in our
[2:05:52] midst
[2:05:53] and not only the Living Word of God that
[2:05:55] comes through the preaching because you
[2:05:58] start preaching the revealed word and
[2:05:59] the Living Word comes
[2:06:01] he comes he's in the building now
[2:06:05] how do you know that because you feel it
[2:06:08] no because he promised it
[2:06:10] and I have no reason to believe that he
[2:06:13] would keep not keep his word to us
[2:06:17] but that and how much more should we
[2:06:19] give honor and respect to the Living
[2:06:22] Word that's planted in somebody else's
[2:06:24] life
[2:06:27] so even treating one another with
[2:06:30] respect and honor
[2:06:32] and creating such a culture is a is a
[2:06:35] benefit in the body of Christ
[2:06:37] I don't know if that little boy but but
[2:06:39] that Dad felt like that little boy was
[2:06:41] going to learn something from that
[2:06:43] experience and uh and maybe maybe he's
[2:06:47] absolutely right maybe all of us can you
[2:06:50] just sit tight there David for a little
[2:06:52] while or do you does your wife need your
[2:06:53] help
[2:06:54] if she doesn't need your help just sit
[2:06:56] tight there for for just a few minutes
[2:06:58] uh you can do some more reading for me
[2:07:01] now now
[2:07:02] this is uh that Hebrews was just a
[2:07:05] foundation for where where we're going
[2:07:07] tonight let me see how much time I have
[2:07:08] okay just a little while I want you to
[2:07:11] read Genesis 1 27. back to the beginning
[2:07:14] of the notes I jumped ahead to give you
[2:07:16] a little foundation for where we're
[2:07:18] going but I wouldn't take any of that
[2:07:20] back I believe every bit of it was
[2:07:21] ordered of the Lord
[2:07:23] Genesis 1 27.
[2:07:27] pray is his name
[2:07:30] you okay
[2:07:32] Hallelujah
[2:07:36] okay David you're on
[2:07:39] so God created man in his own image
[2:07:42] don't go back to I mean get in there now
[2:07:44] and read that good don't go back to that
[2:07:46] don't you hate to be listening to
[2:07:49] somebody preach
[2:07:51] you'll never accuse me of being monotone
[2:07:55] you'll accuse me of screaming
[2:07:57] but you'll never accuse me of being
[2:07:59] monotone I cannot take monotone talkers
[2:08:02] that it's all like this they never go up
[2:08:04] they never go down they just leave the
[2:08:05] voices like this it's like listen to a
[2:08:07] robot I don't even know if God can
[2:08:09] anoint that when it's just like this it
[2:08:11] really gets on my nerves
[2:08:14] so you weren't doing that David but I
[2:08:17] want you to get in there and read this
[2:08:19] like it is written so God
[2:08:23] so God created man in his own image and
[2:08:27] the image of God created he him him
[2:08:31] male and female created he them them
[2:08:35] very good now go to Genesis 2 7 would
[2:08:38] you
[2:08:40] and the Lord God formed Man Out of the
[2:08:43] Dust of the ground and breathed into his
[2:08:47] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[2:08:50] became a living Soul that's powerful I
[2:08:53] love that verse read it again one more
[2:08:55] time and the Lord and the Lord God
[2:08:58] formed man out of it Formed Man Out of
[2:09:01] the Dust
[2:09:05] of the ground and and breathes into his
[2:09:09] nostrils the Breath of Life
[2:09:12] and Man became a living Soul he's just a
[2:09:16] body there created from the Dust
[2:09:18] came from the dust the body goes back to
[2:09:21] the dust he would lay there a Dusty body
[2:09:24] forever and ever but almighty God Elohim
[2:09:28] came and breathed the breath of life
[2:09:31] into the nostrils of Adam Adam
[2:09:34] and the the name Adam means red Earth
[2:09:38] meaning that he was created from the Red
[2:09:41] Dirt from the red Earth so the dirt
[2:09:46] in Eden
[2:09:48] must have been similar
[2:09:54] to the dirt in Alabama
[2:09:58] because I didn't I've never seen too
[2:09:59] much red dirt in Israel it's changed now
[2:10:01] because I never saw but I know where
[2:10:03] there's a lot of Red Dirt
[2:10:06] God made Adam from the Dust from the
[2:10:10] dirt breathe breath go ahead finish
[2:10:14] and breathed
[2:10:15] and breathed the breath into his
[2:10:18] nostrils the breath of life and Man
[2:10:21] became a living soul and Man became a
[2:10:23] living Soul now the dust of the ground
[2:10:26] Earth
[2:10:29] the breath of life was what came from
[2:10:32] eternity
[2:10:33] I want to remind you this evening The
[2:10:35] church here has been taught this but I
[2:10:37] want to remind you this evening that we
[2:10:39] are made of two Source realms
[2:10:42] we are all made from the spiritual and
[2:10:46] from the physical
[2:10:47] one part from God which is Spirit and
[2:10:51] the other part from the earth which is
[2:10:53] physical which is natural I want you to
[2:10:56] put up the paragraph from Gene Edwards
[2:10:58] would you do that I've mentioned the
[2:11:00] name of Gene Edwards before and this is
[2:11:03] this is the paragraph that he wrote I
[2:11:06] love this concerning uh the creation of
[2:11:10] man in in in in one of his books I don't
[2:11:13] remember if this came out of Divine
[2:11:14] Romance or if it came out of the book he
[2:11:16] wrote on creation but I want to quote
[2:11:18] Gene Edwards to you this evening he said
[2:11:22] God came to man in the lowlands of the
[2:11:26] earth realm he breathed
[2:11:29] man so magnificently formed of the Earth
[2:11:34] breathed into him
[2:11:37] spiritual
[2:11:38] Realm
[2:11:41] oh does that resonate with anybody
[2:11:44] that was God adding
[2:11:50] added he had just created he breathed
[2:11:53] into him the spiritual realm The
[2:11:56] life-giving Winds of Heaven the breath
[2:12:00] of divinity oh that's great
[2:12:04] from the mouth of the almighty Creator
[2:12:07] came a
[2:12:14] ours that surged with divine power into
[2:12:18] the nostrils of Adam and flowed through
[2:12:23] his body and soul permeating
[2:12:27] every cell
[2:12:31] that's a writer
[2:12:34] permeate oh read it again brother okay I
[2:12:38] will out from the mouth of the almighty
[2:12:42] Creator came a brilliant dazzling see
[2:12:44] how I'm reading David
[2:12:46] sparkling effervescence like living
[2:12:49] stars that surge with divine power into
[2:12:53] the nostrils of Adam flowed through his
[2:12:56] body and soul permeating every cell of
[2:13:00] his being sounds like me the night I got
[2:13:02] the Holy Ghost
[2:13:05] though that wind this that spirit that
[2:13:09] breath that Celestial air that Divine
[2:13:13] and Heavenly life animated the clay
[2:13:16] model
[2:13:17] creating within a dimensionless
[2:13:22] quality
[2:13:24] condition
[2:13:25] and state of being
[2:13:28] does anybody find that beautiful and
[2:13:31] then read for me David Genesis 2 8 we're
[2:13:33] going somewhere we're going to do
[2:13:34] something now Genesis 2 8.
[2:13:38] and the Lord God come on planted a
[2:13:41] garden Eastward in Eden now notice again
[2:13:44] he planted a garden where
[2:13:49] Eastward in Eden
[2:13:52] so Eden was more than a garden
[2:13:55] say that with me Eden was more than a
[2:13:56] gardener there was an Eden
[2:13:59] and in that Eden
[2:14:01] on the east side of the land of Eden
[2:14:06] which is Delight
[2:14:09] the word Eden means Delight
[2:14:13] when we say uh again Eden
[2:14:18] we are saying the garden of delight
[2:14:22] oh to think that God
[2:14:25] delighted to make such a place
[2:14:29] he planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[2:14:33] read the rest of that for me and and
[2:14:36] there he put the man whom he had formed
[2:14:39] okay so see this with me for a few
[2:14:41] minutes tonight Eden is a big place we
[2:14:44] don't know exactly how big but the Bible
[2:14:46] does give us some dimensions and tells
[2:14:48] us there are four rivers that come
[2:14:49] together and eat which puts it uh across
[2:14:54] that huge land uh because the river
[2:14:57] Euphrates is is part of that that that
[2:15:00] concept so we don't know exactly how big
[2:15:02] Eden was as as a creation but God made a
[2:15:07] place called Eden delight and then in
[2:15:11] the Easter Eastward part of that land
[2:15:14] that he created he made a garden
[2:15:18] we call that the Garden of Eden because
[2:15:20] it was a garden in the land of Eden and
[2:15:24] there he put the man whom he had formed
[2:15:26] now there's something you can get out of
[2:15:28] this
[2:15:28] you can get from this that God did not
[2:15:31] make Adam in the Garden of Eden
[2:15:36] we've always sought and we've always
[2:15:38] read
[2:15:40] picture book and we see that God created
[2:15:44] Adam in the Garden of Eden he didn't
[2:15:46] he created Adam in Eden
[2:15:49] and then he created a garden
[2:15:52] and what did he do
[2:15:55] he put the man
[2:15:58] whom he had created who he had formed he
[2:16:02] placed him
[2:16:04] ever so purposefully
[2:16:07] he placed him in the garden of delight
[2:16:11] isn't that good
[2:16:13] oh I like that I've got one more quote
[2:16:15] from Gene Edwards it's a good one in
[2:16:18] that wonderful day when the Lord God
[2:16:21] planted a garden in Eden for the man in
[2:16:25] His image
[2:16:26] God stood in the boundary between Heaven
[2:16:30] and Earth and did a most incredible
[2:16:33] thing
[2:16:35] stretch forth his hands of omnipotence
[2:16:39] and took this terrestrial ball in one
[2:16:44] hand as with the other he grasped the
[2:16:48] Heavenly Realm
[2:16:50] I want you to see that Earth
[2:16:53] and Heaven how is man made part Earth
[2:16:56] part Heaven part physical part spiritual
[2:17:00] this is what God was doing that day he
[2:17:03] was reaching into the heavenlies and
[2:17:05] bringing it down he was reaching into
[2:17:08] the Earth that he created and bringing
[2:17:10] it forward
[2:17:12] he was going to pull them together
[2:17:15] it's part of his Divine Purpose
[2:17:18] he held that terrestrial ball in one
[2:17:21] hand as with the other he grasped the
[2:17:23] Heavenly realm he moved the two
[2:17:27] toward one another that's good isn't it
[2:17:29] he brought the spiritual realm the
[2:17:33] Timeless realm the dimensionless realm
[2:17:36] toward planet Earth and moved Earth
[2:17:40] toward the Heavenly Realm
[2:17:43] the two moved closer and closer
[2:17:46] like brother Branham told us until they
[2:17:48] did what
[2:17:51] yeah
[2:17:53] Heaven and Earth
[2:17:56] kissed each other they came together
[2:17:59] in that moment of time the two Realms
[2:18:03] touched
[2:18:05] entering into Union with one another the
[2:18:10] area where Heaven and Earth met together
[2:18:13] and overlapped
[2:18:15] he called Eden
[2:18:17] that's what the Jewish people teach
[2:18:19] that's what they believe that when
[2:18:21] Heaven touched Earth
[2:18:23] the place of the smack
[2:18:26] was Eden
[2:18:28] and in Eden he created a garden
[2:18:32] the the place where these two Realms met
[2:18:35] overlapped and interfaced became unlike
[2:18:40] Earth
[2:18:42] and unlike heaven
[2:18:45] that which had never existed before
[2:18:50] not heavenly
[2:18:52] and not Earthly
[2:18:55] something entirely different can you
[2:18:58] follow that line of thought
[2:19:00] you you can discern whether you think
[2:19:02] that's right or not I I I'm one thousand
[2:19:04] percent convinced that that's what he
[2:19:07] did because that's what God's doing in
[2:19:09] this hour
[2:19:10] so I find that very easy to believe God
[2:19:13] is bringing Heaven and Earth back
[2:19:15] together
[2:19:16] he's absolutely bringing that realm
[2:19:19] closer to this realm and the bride is
[2:19:21] the ones caught in the middle of the
[2:19:23] smack
[2:19:25] what he's doing now by his word and by
[2:19:28] his spirit is bringing those around
[2:19:30] close because unbelief and and all that
[2:19:33] has happened in the Earth has pushed
[2:19:35] Heaven back and caused the Earth to fall
[2:19:38] into its Fallen State and now God is
[2:19:41] reaching out into this Earth finding
[2:19:43] those that were his before the
[2:19:45] foundation of the world building his
[2:19:48] sanctuary in them allowing the word of
[2:19:51] God to live in them come on
[2:19:54] changing them from glory to glory
[2:19:57] from strength to strength from Faith to
[2:20:00] Faith
[2:20:01] so that what we will eventually have
[2:20:04] again
[2:20:06] is Kingdom
[2:20:09] which is bigger than Church
[2:20:11] in that day it was the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:20:14] on Earth
[2:20:15] that's exactly what Jesus was
[2:20:17] establishing in his Earthly Ministry if
[2:20:20] you can see that or if it in any way
[2:20:23] resonates with you can you say Amen
[2:20:27] all right now Eden means Delight
[2:20:30] speaks to us of a state of being
[2:20:33] even more than a location
[2:20:35] man in the image of God and in communion
[2:20:39] with God and in Union with him have you
[2:20:43] ever said the word communion
[2:20:45] and did you know that the word Union
[2:20:47] shows up in the word communion so when
[2:20:51] we take the Lord's supper and we call it
[2:20:54] communion we're celebrating something
[2:20:56] more than just a Passover seder we're
[2:21:00] celebrating more than just a meal that
[2:21:02] the Messiah shared with his disciples
[2:21:04] when the bride takes that bread and the
[2:21:07] bride brings that cup of wine
[2:21:09] representing the blood of Jesus we're
[2:21:12] celebrating the union not the union that
[2:21:14] shall be but the union that is
[2:21:18] the union that God is forming now as he
[2:21:22] takes the veil off of his word is
[2:21:24] anybody here
[2:21:26] he unveils he continuously
[2:21:30] consistently unveils his word to us
[2:21:34] and so Adam was placed in the garden
[2:21:38] and the garden
[2:21:40] was also placed
[2:21:45] in Adam
[2:21:47] because the Bible talks about man's
[2:21:49] heart
[2:21:50] being like a garden
[2:21:52] so God put Adam in a garden and God put
[2:21:55] a garden in Adam
[2:21:56] and God told Adam you better tend to
[2:21:58] that garden and God told you you better
[2:22:01] tend to yours anybody with me that's
[2:22:03] where we started preaching tonight is
[2:22:05] everybody getting busy about tending
[2:22:07] their own garden
[2:22:10] if I would that he tarry till I come
[2:22:12] what business is out of yours you tend
[2:22:14] your garden
[2:22:16] I don't know about you but I find that
[2:22:18] it increasingly takes a lot of my time
[2:22:20] tending my garden
[2:22:23] because overnight you'd be surprised
[2:22:26] overnight something will find its way
[2:22:29] into the garden of my heart
[2:22:32] overnight I can find something growing
[2:22:35] that just the day before I thought I had
[2:22:38] cleared it all out
[2:22:40] but what I have taught you and you some
[2:22:42] of you gardeners already knew what I
[2:22:44] have taught you is the worst thing you
[2:22:46] can do is pull a weed out of your garden
[2:22:49] and shake the dirt off
[2:22:53] and we do it because we you know if
[2:22:56] you're if you're serious about it you're
[2:22:58] thankful for the dirt it's good dirt you
[2:23:00] put it there you've you've cultivated
[2:23:02] that dirt you worked on that dirt to get
[2:23:05] it to where it is and you don't want it
[2:23:06] going in a trash bag
[2:23:08] so what you do is you pull the weed and
[2:23:11] you shake it
[2:23:12] and you shake the dirt back but guess
[2:23:15] what else you do
[2:23:16] you shake the seed
[2:23:19] if you've got them old crazy little
[2:23:21] weeds that look like a a mimosa tree
[2:23:25] everywhere oh my there's so many of them
[2:23:28] so me they have little spores you turn
[2:23:31] the leaves over they've got little
[2:23:33] spores underneath you go to shaking like
[2:23:35] that you're just giving birth
[2:23:39] you can't do it you you get in there one
[2:23:42] day and you start taking them out and
[2:23:44] overnight you go back and it looks like
[2:23:47] you've never never even visited yourself
[2:23:50] have you found that out about your own
[2:23:52] spiritual life you come to the altar you
[2:23:55] get in the presence of God you feel the
[2:23:57] word digging around on some of your
[2:23:59] stuff
[2:24:00] you leave the church you go back home to
[2:24:03] your family you go through all those
[2:24:05] things you have all those things built
[2:24:07] up resentments come and jealousies come
[2:24:09] and Stripes come come on and judging
[2:24:12] everybody's motive it starts creeping up
[2:24:14] I know why she did and I know what she
[2:24:16] meant and I know what he was why he was
[2:24:19] doing that I know what they were getting
[2:24:20] to hello
[2:24:23] and you got to dig again
[2:24:26] because God put Adam in the garden and
[2:24:29] God put the Garden in Adam
[2:24:31] and you and I are charged with the
[2:24:34] responsibility to tend God's Garden in
[2:24:37] US
[2:24:37] come on now somebody said can you relate
[2:24:40] that to something else so that I can get
[2:24:41] a hold of it I will it's the greatest
[2:24:43] battle ever fought
[2:24:45] it's the same thing it's tending your
[2:24:47] own thoughts it's it's catching your own
[2:24:50] thoughts is pulling down your own
[2:24:52] thoughts it's submitting everything and
[2:24:54] anything every emotion every feeling
[2:24:56] every thought subjecting it
[2:25:00] to the truth
[2:25:01] hello I need a little help
[2:25:04] don't Wilt just yet we're going to give
[2:25:06] you breakfast
[2:25:10] now I've got to move on
[2:25:12] David would you read Genesis 2
[2:25:16] 16-17 whatever offering they give me
[2:25:19] tonight I'll split it with you
[2:25:22] that won't be hard to do
[2:25:25] read on and the Lord God commanded the
[2:25:28] man saying of every tree of the garden
[2:25:31] thou mayest freely eat every tree You
[2:25:34] Can Eat You Can Eat You Can Eat you can
[2:25:37] eat that's all some people hear
[2:25:40] they got so excited you get so excited
[2:25:43] over the buffet
[2:25:47] that you don't hear please take a Clean
[2:25:49] Plate
[2:25:53] you forget to listen for all the
[2:25:55] instructions and rules read the next one
[2:25:57] for us would you but but
[2:26:00] of the tree of the knowledge of Good and
[2:26:03] Evil let's break that word down just a
[2:26:05] moment the tree of the knowledge of Good
[2:26:07] and Evil did you know that had that tree
[2:26:10] never been planted
[2:26:12] Adam would have never known evil
[2:26:19] now now remember what what evil is
[2:26:24] it's raw
[2:26:27] when the Bible said and it was very good
[2:26:30] the word good is what tovan what does
[2:26:33] Tove really mean it means when a seed
[2:26:37] that God has planted begins to bring
[2:26:41] forth the original intent and purpose
[2:26:45] for which it was planted God looks at
[2:26:48] that and says that is good
[2:26:53] if God should plant a seed in your life
[2:26:56] and and you not cultivate that seed and
[2:26:59] water that seed and guard that seed and
[2:27:02] fertilize that seed so that that seed
[2:27:05] does not bring forth its potential God
[2:27:07] put it there for a reason how many of
[2:27:09] you know God put some things in us for a
[2:27:12] reason
[2:27:13] anybody awake
[2:27:15] he put some things in us for a reason
[2:27:17] and some we cultivate and some we leave
[2:27:22] look if God's give you a gift to sing
[2:27:24] sing
[2:27:26] and you don't have to wait till you have
[2:27:27] a microphone in your hands sing
[2:27:32] [Music]
[2:27:36] car
[2:27:38] crying out loud singing Walmart
[2:27:41] [Applause]
[2:27:49] seed that God planted in you to reach
[2:27:54] its fullest potential
[2:27:55] because if it does not reach its
[2:27:58] potential do you know what God calls it
[2:28:01] evil evil
[2:28:04] evil
[2:28:06] evil
[2:28:09] now if I were in this and I was doing
[2:28:11] all the doing I would call it
[2:28:14] disappointing
[2:28:18] because I've been as a gardener I've
[2:28:20] planted things
[2:28:21] that didn't come
[2:28:23] that didn't survive
[2:28:25] it's disappointing
[2:28:27] you feel so disappointed but what do you
[2:28:29] do you snatch it out and buy another one
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:33] you don't give up you try again come on
[2:28:36] maybe you've never farmed outside you
[2:28:38] girls but you a lot of you have green
[2:28:40] plants and some of them aren't fake
[2:28:43] in your house
[2:28:45] some of you live in a jungle
[2:28:49] I told him the other day at my house
[2:28:50] that we have a bird of paradise that
[2:28:53] sits in the living room and it is
[2:28:55] growing so big I have to push it out of
[2:28:57] the way to look across the living room
[2:28:59] there's one leaf on it Chad saw it the
[2:29:01] other day there's one leaf on it about
[2:29:03] that big it's one of the biggest leaves
[2:29:05] I've ever seen
[2:29:08] what happens if you fail ask Mariah
[2:29:11] because she has failed several times
[2:29:13] along the way in her in her houseplant
[2:29:15] studies if you like
[2:29:18] you like want to have it you get you
[2:29:19] another one and you start again so if I
[2:29:23] were writing this script I would say
[2:29:25] that if God gives you a seed and it
[2:29:28] doesn't bring forth this full potential
[2:29:30] I would say that's disappointing
[2:29:33] and God's got a lot of seed
[2:29:37] so I would just say Lord give them
[2:29:40] another seed
[2:29:43] they went on vacation
[2:29:46] the plant died
[2:29:49] they got caught up in the swirl
[2:29:52] of somebody's gossip
[2:29:57] I'm going to say this I hope you'll be
[2:29:59] okay
[2:30:01] they took on somebody else's offense
[2:30:05] that's illegal
[2:30:07] that's illegal
[2:30:09] that's illegal you can't be offended
[2:30:11] because I am
[2:30:16] that's mine
[2:30:18] I've got to deal with that
[2:30:20] I got to deal with that
[2:30:22] and that's why it's better not to tell
[2:30:24] people what you're offended by
[2:30:29] oh pastor's preaching tonight
[2:30:33] you'll be you'll be I tell you what
[2:30:35] you'll be doing you'll be circulating a
[2:30:38] uh petition to bring in a special
[2:30:40] speaker the next time we have a a buy-in
[2:30:42] bi-monthly meeting you'll say now we've
[2:30:45] had enough of that we were ready for a
[2:30:46] special speaker
[2:30:48] I'm going to tell you like it is you you
[2:30:51] you don't want to don't want to take on
[2:30:53] somebody else's offense and I'll tell
[2:30:55] you how human beings are
[2:30:58] misery I'm really preaching now
[2:31:01] Ms I'm not even screaming but I'm
[2:31:04] preaching misery loves company
[2:31:08] if I can just get one person to be
[2:31:10] offended with me
[2:31:15] it reminds me of the little children
[2:31:16] when we all pull together when we all
[2:31:19] Pat together how miserable we'll be
[2:31:26] for your offenses my offense and my
[2:31:29] offenses your offense when we all talk
[2:31:32] together how miserable we'll be
[2:31:35] I just wrote that I hope they don't make
[2:31:37] me pay a royalty
[2:31:41] you can't carry somebody else's events
[2:31:46] it'll rot your seed
[2:31:49] but but you get caught in these swirls
[2:31:52] of things
[2:31:54] I I I I I I
[2:31:58] I'll get i'll get started in a minute
[2:32:00] I learned to watch for it
[2:32:06] when this uh reel started you know
[2:32:09] getting out there on Facebook it's first
[2:32:10] one we've ever had on Facebook to have
[2:32:12] that many views it's got over forty
[2:32:14] thousand views now
[2:32:17] it's been shared how many times 600
[2:32:19] something times have over 600 comments
[2:32:21] or something like that or locks locks
[2:32:24] locks and uh I know some of you don't
[2:32:27] care I don't I mean you know I can't say
[2:32:29] I don't care because I do
[2:32:31] but but
[2:32:33] it has both good and bad it has positive
[2:32:37] and negative you know one person will
[2:32:38] say finally somebody tells the truth and
[2:32:41] the next person will say that preacher
[2:32:43] needs to let somebody else eat some of
[2:32:44] the pizza
[2:32:45] foreign
[2:32:49] one comment says that's the truth I'm
[2:32:52] waiting on amen amen amen and somebody
[2:32:54] else says who made him the authority
[2:32:57] so when I know I've done this enough
[2:33:00] I've been in this thing long enough to
[2:33:02] know that when even something like that
[2:33:06] is out there in the Airways who who is
[2:33:09] it
[2:33:10] that is Lord over the airwaves
[2:33:13] [Applause]
[2:33:14] who is the prince of the power of the
[2:33:16] air
[2:33:18] Satan
[2:33:20] it's the prince of the power of the air
[2:33:22] if it gets up there in his domain he has
[2:33:25] the ability to twist
[2:33:28] put the Leviathan spin on it
[2:33:31] it starts drawing attention of the
[2:33:34] heavenly
[2:33:35] and it starts to bring it starts drawing
[2:33:38] attention of the second heaven
[2:33:43] so you start you start getting attention
[2:33:45] in third heaven and you start getting
[2:33:48] attention in second heaven you've got
[2:33:50] Angels moving around to help you and
[2:33:52] you've got demons plotting their next
[2:33:54] attack against you just for something as
[2:33:57] simple as a real a meme
[2:34:00] that's why we pray every day over one
[2:34:03] another
[2:34:04] I pray every day particularly for you
[2:34:06] sister Anna Christine every day for for
[2:34:09] a good amount of time because I realize
[2:34:12] that just by you picking these nuggets
[2:34:16] and presenting them out there pushing
[2:34:18] them out there you become vulnerable
[2:34:22] you draw the attention of the uh of that
[2:34:25] which is beyond the third heaven but you
[2:34:27] also draw the attention of that which is
[2:34:29] in second heaven where Satan has built
[2:34:32] his throne
[2:34:34] and strangers get stirred
[2:34:37] you think witches see that
[2:34:40] that you think the occult
[2:34:43] s you think if something goes out there
[2:34:45] forty thousand views you think there's
[2:34:48] somebody in there that would like to
[2:34:50] curse
[2:34:54] so if we're going to have a reach out
[2:34:56] that's a that's a reverse of Outreach
[2:35:00] if we're going to have a reach out we
[2:35:03] need to know that it's going to take
[2:35:05] prayer to keep every one of us where we
[2:35:09] need to be
[2:35:15] as some of you have realized that
[2:35:17] through the years we've had to deal with
[2:35:19] these spirits
[2:35:21] that have come to undermine what God had
[2:35:24] done and what he was doing and who he
[2:35:26] was trying to use we've had to deal with
[2:35:28] that
[2:35:29] you have to sometimes say God bless you
[2:35:34] au revoir
[2:35:36] go find your place get in it and do
[2:35:39] everything you can for God
[2:35:41] we've got to understand there comes a
[2:35:43] time that even Apostles of scripture
[2:35:45] can't work close together
[2:35:47] and there's times that they have to say
[2:35:49] go on but here's what I learned in my
[2:35:51] experience in in Frederick Maryland
[2:35:54] I was in a doing a convention a
[2:35:56] conference in Frederick Maryland when I
[2:35:58] was taken into that Realm
[2:36:00] where demons
[2:36:02] were competing
[2:36:06] they were struggling for the position to
[2:36:09] replace
[2:36:11] another principality that had been
[2:36:14] ripped off his throne by the authority
[2:36:16] of Jesus Christ
[2:36:18] I want to explain that just just a
[2:36:20] moment to someone who may never heard
[2:36:22] that again but I saw those Thrones were
[2:36:25] principalities and Powers were sitting
[2:36:28] and they were ruling over regions and
[2:36:31] areas and even families
[2:36:33] because sometimes Spirits can can
[2:36:36] predominantly show up in Family Lines in
[2:36:39] regions in certain areas there are
[2:36:42] regions of our country and and you think
[2:36:45] there's a homosexual Spirit on them
[2:36:46] because because there's a lot of
[2:36:48] homosexuals living in that region but
[2:36:50] what you don't understand is that thing
[2:36:53] drew them there
[2:36:55] it wasn't for for because they heard
[2:36:58] that there were a bunch a bunch of
[2:36:59] homosexuals living there it's because
[2:37:01] there's a spirit over certain areas that
[2:37:04] operates predominantly over an area and
[2:37:07] it draws people who are under the Same
[2:37:08] Spirit just like brother Branham would
[2:37:10] say in a service that spirit is rising
[2:37:13] up there and calling out to this other
[2:37:15] Spirit similar spirit for help
[2:37:17] [Applause]
[2:37:19] getting some help and some string now I
[2:37:21] tell you that's how it works
[2:37:23] and I saw that that what was being
[2:37:26] accomplished in some of those meetings
[2:37:28] is that principality spiritual
[2:37:30] wickedness in high places was being
[2:37:32] pulled down and I saw Spirits rolling
[2:37:34] off of Thrones losing their Authority
[2:37:37] being toppled but that was good and that
[2:37:39] made me Rejoice but what I saw next was
[2:37:41] like a strong man competition in the
[2:37:44] spirit if this is too much for you plug
[2:37:45] your ears
[2:37:48] if you wanted an ordinary church that's
[2:37:50] where you ought to be
[2:37:54] but they started competing
[2:37:56] like a strong man competition these
[2:37:59] demon spirits to see who would show and
[2:38:02] demonstrate the most power
[2:38:05] so they could crawl up and occupy that
[2:38:07] place that look Satan is never going to
[2:38:09] be satisfied with a throne sitting empty
[2:38:12] with a region not having a predominant
[2:38:14] spirit with a family not dealing with
[2:38:16] certain issues
[2:38:18] and so the enemy out there is just
[2:38:20] looking for something else
[2:38:25] somebody said I don't I don't even I
[2:38:27] can't even fathom that that's because
[2:38:28] you don't know how important you are
[2:38:32] you don't understand your value in the
[2:38:34] Kingdom
[2:38:36] all of Heaven wants to get a hold of you
[2:38:38] and all of hell wants to get a hold of
[2:38:40] you for the same reason
[2:38:42] because God has sown his seeds of
[2:38:44] potential in you you carry the seeds of
[2:38:46] Destiny so if I were setting this thing
[2:38:49] up and and God give a seed and this seed
[2:38:52] is flourishing I'd say yeah that's good
[2:38:54] that's told but if you happen to have a
[2:38:57] seed and it wasn't doing too good
[2:38:59] because you got caught up in something
[2:39:00] that was going on some strong man
[2:39:02] competition in the other realm you got
[2:39:04] caught up in someone's offense you got
[2:39:07] caught up in someone's jealousy you you
[2:39:09] got this social justice kind of thing
[2:39:11] getting on you or you always feel like
[2:39:13] you've got to take up for the underdog
[2:39:16] yeah
[2:39:18] and sometimes you don't understand what
[2:39:21] he said when he was telling us we don't
[2:39:24] want to be guilty of praying something
[2:39:25] off of somebody that he put on them
[2:39:29] because if God allowed that and he put
[2:39:31] that on him he did it to drive them into
[2:39:33] their full potential
[2:39:35] so you get up there trying to cast that
[2:39:37] off you're you're going against God's
[2:39:38] ordained plan for their life so just be
[2:39:41] careful
[2:39:43] I just say that's disappointing
[2:39:46] you've got one seed flourishing you've
[2:39:48] got one seed about to dry up and die but
[2:39:50] God's got a lot of seed but that's not
[2:39:52] what God says
[2:39:53] God's bigger than I am he's smarter than
[2:39:55] I am
[2:39:56] he has a different way of looking at
[2:39:58] things than I do I have to I have to
[2:40:00] work at thinking like him
[2:40:02] come on now I have to utilize the mind
[2:40:04] of Christ that's been given to me and
[2:40:06] when God sees something stay away just a
[2:40:08] moment when God sees in you one seed
[2:40:11] thriving he said that's Tove he might
[2:40:14] even say that's Tove mayode
[2:40:16] which is very good
[2:40:18] very good
[2:40:21] but if he sees one over here that's not
[2:40:24] doing anything accomplishing anything
[2:40:27] he doesn't say that's disappointing
[2:40:31] he doesn't even say that's non-tove
[2:40:34] not good
[2:40:36] he actually says it's raw
[2:40:38] in Hebrew and R A in Hebrew ra is evil
[2:40:44] God says God says that it's actually
[2:40:48] evil
[2:40:50] when you allow a seed hear me
[2:40:54] of Destiny and purpose that he has
[2:40:57] planted in your life for you to let that
[2:41:00] go untended ungarden uh unguarded
[2:41:03] undernourished
[2:41:06] for whatever reason for whatever else
[2:41:09] you got occupied in while this seed is
[2:41:11] drying up and Dying God doesn't say I'm
[2:41:14] disappointed he says that's evil
[2:41:27] he actually says in the New Testament
[2:41:29] that's unbelief
[2:41:31] because if you believed what I had
[2:41:33] placed in you you'd be doing something
[2:41:35] with it
[2:41:36] you know this principle is also taught
[2:41:38] in the garden in the in the parable of
[2:41:39] the talents
[2:41:41] you don't take what God's placed in your
[2:41:44] care and bury it in a hole
[2:41:46] and then go back and say well I got your
[2:41:48] dried up seed you left me
[2:41:51] you go back and take him a harvest and
[2:41:53] say look what I've done with what you
[2:41:55] gave me I've multiplied it I've utilized
[2:41:59] it I've taken that muscle and exercised
[2:42:02] it
[2:42:08] serious
[2:42:09] Adam would have never even known evil
[2:42:14] he would have never even known that's
[2:42:16] what knowledge means
[2:42:17] he would have never even known evil
[2:42:21] he was created to no good
[2:42:24] that's a god-consciousness that Adam was
[2:42:27] created with that he saw God in
[2:42:29] everything
[2:42:31] every time Adam moved he saw God it
[2:42:35] wasn't just in the cool of the day when
[2:42:37] God came down and met with him that he
[2:42:39] saw God he saw God in every blade of
[2:42:41] grass he saw God in every grain of sand
[2:42:44] ever a little toad frog every Cricket
[2:42:47] every grasshopper every everything that
[2:42:50] are you listening
[2:42:51] everything that he encountered he saw
[2:42:54] God in that I see God in that I see the
[2:42:57] thumbprint of the Creator until that day
[2:42:59] in Eve the same until that day
[2:43:03] because God was conditioning them to be
[2:43:05] able to eat from the Tree of Life
[2:43:09] but once they took of that tree of the
[2:43:12] knowledge of Good and Evil Adam not only
[2:43:15] had a consciousness of God
[2:43:18] and the consciousness of good
[2:43:20] but he now knew that there was an
[2:43:23] opposite of good
[2:43:25] and that was bad that was evil
[2:43:27] that was rotten
[2:43:30] and all the trouble you've ever had in
[2:43:32] your life
[2:43:33] is because of the knowledge of evil
[2:43:38] had we not but remember God planned this
[2:43:40] whole thing
[2:43:41] because God didn't want robots that only
[2:43:44] knew how to do good and only knew what
[2:43:47] good was he actually wanted people who
[2:43:50] could see both sides of the coin good
[2:43:52] and evil and choose good
[2:43:56] all the power is in your choice
[2:43:58] I'm preaching again
[2:44:00] the power's in your choice whether you
[2:44:03] choose the good or will you choose the
[2:44:04] evil we all know there's evil we all
[2:44:07] know we all know when when it tries to
[2:44:09] operate in US
[2:44:11] we know when we try to sit down on a
[2:44:13] seed that God's placed in our life
[2:44:15] something he wants to do through us we
[2:44:17] all know when we're sitting down on that
[2:44:20] now I want you to read one more thing
[2:44:22] and I'm going to I haven't gotten
[2:44:23] anywhere I am on the middle of page two
[2:44:27] but I wanted to get a little further
[2:44:29] than this I want you to read Genesis 2
[2:44:31] 16 and 17 but these people have come a
[2:44:33] long way and I know I know as good as
[2:44:36] the biscuits and graveyard I know that's
[2:44:38] not why they've come
[2:44:39] I I think you all could have probably
[2:44:42] said amen
[2:44:44] you visitors there uh Austin Hannah come
[2:44:47] on sister that you missed a good place
[2:44:49] to shout
[2:44:52] I said I know they didn't come for the
[2:44:54] biscuit and graviness
[2:45:02] and the Lord God commanded the man
[2:45:05] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[2:45:08] mayest eat freely
[2:45:10] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[2:45:13] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it don't
[2:45:15] eat it
[2:45:17] don't eat it
[2:45:19] go ahead for in the day that thou eatest
[2:45:22] thereof Thou shalt surely die
[2:45:26] somebody said but they didn't die but
[2:45:28] they did
[2:45:30] the innocence of only having a god
[2:45:32] Consciousness died that day
[2:45:35] oh I'm telling you something
[2:45:37] anybody that's ever chosen sin anybody
[2:45:41] that's ever chosen a filthy habit
[2:45:44] you know the sting of that that tree of
[2:45:47] of Eve knowledge of evil
[2:45:50] every time you've ever told yourself
[2:45:52] I'll never do it again
[2:45:54] you've known the taste of that fruit
[2:45:58] from the Tree of evil
[2:46:02] had it not been that way but remember
[2:46:04] again I want to make sure you understand
[2:46:06] God didn't want you to serve him as a
[2:46:08] robot he wanted to put two two tables
[2:46:11] out there for you
[2:46:14] and he wanted you to choose
[2:46:16] and at this point he knew the only way
[2:46:18] that you would ever choose to eat of the
[2:46:21] Tree of Life
[2:46:23] would be if you first ate
[2:46:26] bye
[2:46:28] of the tree of the knowledge of evil
[2:46:33] he knew the only way that you would ever
[2:46:34] understand the value of eating Jesus
[2:46:40] first you were going to have to take
[2:46:41] what the stupid devil
[2:46:45] was serving
[2:46:47] you either did it by adamic Nature
[2:46:50] finding the Lord as a child or you did
[2:46:52] it as an adult but every one of us have
[2:46:55] tasted that evil fruit
[2:46:58] we know and we know the guilt that comes
[2:47:00] with it and we know the condemnation
[2:47:01] that comes with it and and and that last
[2:47:04] way
[2:47:06] longer than the high
[2:47:08] preach brother wow
[2:47:11] longer
[2:47:13] that awful feeling lasts a lot longer
[2:47:15] than the moment of pleasure
[2:47:19] David one more uh Genesis 3 1-3 we agree
[2:47:23] with going somewhere we'd have to do it
[2:47:25] tomorrow I guess
[2:47:26] let's get these verses in these are so
[2:47:28] familiar
[2:47:30] Genesis 3 1-3
[2:47:35] I guess it's 8 48 so that's almost
[2:47:40] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[2:47:43] beast of the field which the Lord God
[2:47:45] had made this this word subtle
[2:47:49] in Hebrew
[2:47:51] is not just conniving
[2:47:55] it's beguiling
[2:47:58] and beguiling
[2:48:01] means to appeal
[2:48:04] to the senses
[2:48:06] it actually speaks
[2:48:09] rather clearly
[2:48:11] of appealing to the sensual nature
[2:48:15] of a person
[2:48:18] that flesh pleasure you understand what
[2:48:21] I mean the sexuality
[2:48:24] of a man that's just the word that's
[2:48:26] used there
[2:48:28] is a great portion of Jewish people who
[2:48:31] believe original sin like you and I
[2:48:34] believe original sin it's not mainstream
[2:48:37] it's not the multitudes but there are
[2:48:40] there are major groups of Jewish people
[2:48:42] around the world who believe original
[2:48:44] sin like you do simply because of the
[2:48:47] Hebrew word that is chosen here
[2:48:49] it doesn't just mean he told a lie
[2:48:53] it means he used everything within his
[2:48:56] power
[2:48:57] to appeal to the lowest nature
[2:49:04] read on David I just keep doing it to
[2:49:06] you don't I and he said unto the woman
[2:49:08] yea hath God said You shall not eat of
[2:49:12] every tree of the garden
[2:49:14] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[2:49:17] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[2:49:19] garden but
[2:49:21] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[2:49:24] the midst of the garden God hath said ye
[2:49:27] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[2:49:29] touch it lest ye die see there's a
[2:49:32] little twist
[2:49:38] read verse 4 and 5 for us
[2:49:42] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[2:49:44] shall not surely die you shall not
[2:49:47] surely die I know that's what God Said
[2:49:52] but you're not really gonna die
[2:49:57] verse 5 for God does know that in the
[2:50:01] day ye eat thereof then then your eyes
[2:50:04] shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods
[2:50:07] knowing good and evil the very thing
[2:50:10] that was going to give her a wretched
[2:50:12] life
[2:50:14] the very thing that was going to change
[2:50:16] the history of humanity forever he sold
[2:50:19] it to her like a prize
[2:50:23] your eyes are going to be open and
[2:50:26] you're going to be as gods that old lion
[2:50:29] deceiving
[2:50:31] seducing devil that had hijacked that
[2:50:35] Serpent and crawled in his body
[2:50:39] possessing him and speaking through him
[2:50:43] knew what he was saying
[2:50:45] and he knew what he was doing
[2:50:48] he wasn't just selling her a lie he was
[2:50:51] telling her exactly what she needed to
[2:50:56] hear
[2:50:57] to appeal to that
[2:51:03] you see Adam would have never fallen for
[2:51:05] that lie
[2:51:08] the Bible tells us the New Testament
[2:51:10] Adam was not deceived but he was the one
[2:51:13] in deception
[2:51:14] Adam chose
[2:51:17] knowing full well eyes wide open he knew
[2:51:21] exactly what he was doing he was under
[2:51:23] no deception or seduction he was
[2:51:25] forerunning becoming Messiah
[2:51:28] he didn't do it stellarly he did blame
[2:51:31] her for a few things when God came down
[2:51:33] you know the story right
[2:51:38] it's not the tree of that knowledge of
[2:51:40] Good and Evil that was going to make him
[2:51:41] his gods
[2:51:45] weren't they already as gods
[2:51:48] didn't they already have full Authority
[2:51:50] didn't Adam already have dominion over
[2:51:52] everything that God had made hello
[2:51:55] so he was actually offered the offering
[2:51:58] them a repackaged reality
[2:52:03] you're already seeing more than than you
[2:52:07] can imagine
[2:52:08] you're already operating in more
[2:52:10] Authority than you than you fully
[2:52:12] understand and yet he said God knows
[2:52:15] that in that day that you take part of
[2:52:17] this your eyes are really going to be
[2:52:19] open and they were
[2:52:22] but it wasn't in that moment that they
[2:52:24] were going to no good they'd already
[2:52:26] known good
[2:52:27] but in addition to the good they had
[2:52:29] known they were now going to No Evil it
[2:52:31] was going to give them a consciousness
[2:52:33] of that which is wrong
[2:52:35] because before that moment all they knew
[2:52:37] was that which was right and it was as
[2:52:40] though nothing else existed the serpent
[2:52:42] sowed a seed of resentment into Eve make
[2:52:46] sure when you're quoting the prophet and
[2:52:48] you often use the seed of discrepancy
[2:52:51] please understand that for Eve the seed
[2:52:54] of discrepancy was resentment
[2:52:57] he knew resentment
[2:53:01] [Music]
[2:53:02] he knew that if he could get Eve to
[2:53:05] doubt
[2:53:06] the loving nature
[2:53:08] of her Abba
[2:53:10] her Creator and even grow to resent he
[2:53:19] is what what he was doing
[2:53:21] if I can get her to doubt that God is
[2:53:25] all together good and lovely and that
[2:53:27] somewhere he's running a scheme
[2:53:31] to keep me away from the better life
[2:53:36] that's what he was selling her he was
[2:53:37] telling her there's a better life and
[2:53:39] God knows that you're going to breach
[2:53:40] into that better life if you take her
[2:53:42] that
[2:53:45] he also knew that in the moment that she
[2:53:47] started along that that line of thinking
[2:53:51] that he could get her to do anything he
[2:53:52] wanted her to do
[2:53:54] listen listen to me
[2:53:57] because if the enemy can cause you I
[2:54:00] want you to hear this and close
[2:54:02] if the enemy can get you to doubt that
[2:54:07] your God is all together good and that
[2:54:09] he is all together lovely
[2:54:13] if if that enemy can cause you to doubt
[2:54:16] that he loves you ultimately ultimately
[2:54:19] above all
[2:54:21] if if that old enemy can get you to feel
[2:54:25] some moment of resentment
[2:54:28] toward God
[2:54:30] he let me lose my baby
[2:54:34] he let me lose my marriage
[2:54:37] hello he let me lose my family
[2:54:43] he was trying to keep me down it seems
[2:54:48] so and so drives a new car
[2:54:51] I can't afford to repair the old car
[2:54:54] I've got
[2:54:55] you see how that resentment starts
[2:54:57] working
[2:54:58] you see ultimately the only reason why
[2:55:00] the enemy wants us to resent one another
[2:55:02] is he's building a case
[2:55:05] so that we will one day resent God and
[2:55:07] we'll say you know we hear people saying
[2:55:09] all the time life isn't fair that's just
[2:55:11] that's just one swallow
[2:55:14] you've just swallowed one seed that's
[2:55:18] just a little bit of the discrepancy
[2:55:20] that life isn't fair but what the enemy
[2:55:23] really wants you to believe is that God
[2:55:25] isn't fair
[2:55:27] because if you begin to believe that God
[2:55:29] isn't fair then you pull yourself out of
[2:55:34] fellowship and relationship
[2:55:37] with him
[2:55:39] isn't that right
[2:55:40] so that word that Satan was giving
[2:55:42] through the serpent inside the emotions
[2:55:45] of Eve
[2:55:46] and by the way women are not the only
[2:55:48] emotional creatures in the house
[2:55:51] but the enemy knew how to speak right
[2:55:53] into her emotion causing her to feel
[2:55:55] that God was withholding something good
[2:55:57] from her everybody everybody but not you
[2:56:01] know God knows he don't want you to be
[2:56:03] like him well that's exactly what he
[2:56:05] wanted it was just going to take a
[2:56:07] Calvary to bring that to pass
[2:56:10] and Satan thought if I can pollute the
[2:56:12] seed now
[2:56:14] you know the whole the whole purpose of
[2:56:16] injecting a seed
[2:56:17] was to pollute the bloodline
[2:56:20] so that there would never be a
[2:56:21] possibility of Christ coming as a pure
[2:56:23] seed
[2:56:25] you follow that
[2:56:27] if the serpent you know used he was
[2:56:30] hijacked and used for a purpose and the
[2:56:33] enemy said if I can find a seat
[2:56:37] that would mingle with man
[2:56:40] come on
[2:56:43] then I can contaminate
[2:56:46] the bloodline
[2:56:48] and no one will ever know
[2:56:51] who comes from a Pure Line like the Pure
[2:56:54] Line of Sith
[2:56:55] are from the Fallen line of Cain
[2:56:59] it's all about it's all about the seed
[2:57:02] it always has been it all always will be
[2:57:06] so I mean Satan was doing more than just
[2:57:09] trying to get her to be mad at God
[2:57:11] he was trying to hijack the whole
[2:57:13] purpose of redemption let's stand
[2:57:24] but how do you end I need to bring that
[2:57:26] to a positive point and in order to do
[2:57:28] that would take more time
[2:57:30] musicians are coming
[2:57:33] I don't want to take more time to bring
[2:57:35] that back to the positive but if you
[2:57:36] come in the morning the Lord willing
[2:57:38] will try to do that because it's
[2:57:39] extremely positive
[2:57:44] what I'm really trying to get to and I
[2:57:46] will hopefully will land there tomorrow
[2:57:47] what I really want to get to is how how
[2:57:50] uh
[2:57:52] negative
[2:57:55] we see what happened when God said okay
[2:57:59] you can't stay here anymore
[2:58:02] you can't live here anymore
[2:58:04] you're going to have to go live
[2:58:05] somewhere else
[2:58:07] you know part of that was
[2:58:10] Adam was taken from ground outside of
[2:58:12] the garden
[2:58:14] and there's something you need to know
[2:58:16] there were no graves in the garden
[2:58:21] Adam was created to never die but
[2:58:23] because he had partaken of this sin he
[2:58:25] was going to die and there was to be no
[2:58:28] death
[2:58:29] no graves in that Garden
[2:58:33] because death and the Tree of Life
[2:58:35] cannot exist in the same Realm
[2:58:40] you get a taste of that tree
[2:58:42] you live forever
[2:58:44] come on now
[2:58:46] so God was going to have to take him out
[2:58:47] of that garden and he Adam and Eve and
[2:58:50] put them in Exile
[2:58:52] he was going to have to drive them out
[2:58:53] and we see that as such a negative thing
[2:58:55] did God really have to put a flaming
[2:58:58] sword
[2:59:00] and Cherry beams to guard the way
[2:59:05] he did
[2:59:07] but here's where the church has missed
[2:59:09] the teaching
[2:59:10] they teach that God put that flaming
[2:59:13] sword there and those cherubims there to
[2:59:16] keep people from getting to the Tree of
[2:59:18] Life
[2:59:20] and that is not what the scripture said
[2:59:23] the Bible said it was to guard
[2:59:26] the way
[2:59:30] to protect the way
[2:59:32] because the ultimate goal
[2:59:35] is that that every destination
[2:59:38] destinied get back to the garden
[2:59:42] because in the garden there is another
[2:59:44] tree
[2:59:45] and that's the Tree of Life
[2:59:47] and once you Feast on that thank you
[2:59:51] Lord thank you for the Living Word
[2:59:54] once you Feast on that your eyes are
[2:59:57] opened again
[3:00:00] and you realize that what the enemy sold
[3:00:03] you is a bill of goods you owned and
[3:00:06] possessed potentially all along you
[3:00:09] always were created to have that
[3:00:10] Dominion
[3:00:12] and Satan was promising you something
[3:00:14] that was already yours and so now you
[3:00:17] realize all I have to do is take
[3:00:19] all I have to do is get back so the
[3:00:22] purpose was not to keep people from the
[3:00:24] tree
[3:00:25] it was to protect the way
[3:00:27] because you're not going to walk in and
[3:00:29] take a bite of that tree of life like
[3:00:31] fools walking around with hobnail shoes
[3:00:34] there's a way
[3:00:36] there's a way
[3:00:38] it's called the way of holiness
[3:00:42] [Music]
[3:00:46] God shut up God has an order
[3:00:51] and he has a way
[3:00:53] the way shall be called the way of
[3:00:58] Holiness and and no fool
[3:01:02] shall stumble air therein
[3:01:06] if you get on that way that has been
[3:01:08] protected for you by a flaming sword
[3:01:18] that turns
[3:01:23] I'm gonna give all my punchlines away
[3:01:26] but it turned whichever direction you
[3:01:28] need God to talk to you in
[3:01:31] you have not walked down a road
[3:01:34] that that word can't help you get get
[3:01:36] get on the right path
[3:01:38] you've never fallen so far or stumbled
[3:01:40] so bad or straight shoot
[3:01:43] you've never strayed so far away
[3:01:45] Hallelujah
[3:01:47] I would have had more amens than that
[3:01:50] but what that word will go looking for
[3:01:52] you
[3:01:53] you see it's not there to keep you from
[3:01:55] it's there to protect the way to get to
[3:01:59] I'll show you
[3:02:01] I'll show you I've preached this for
[3:02:03] years I'll show you
[3:02:05] it's a gift
[3:02:07] and I'll also show you that that the
[3:02:10] same fire
[3:02:12] that that was on that sword
[3:02:15] it was guarding the way that fiery sword
[3:02:18] that's the same fire that fell on the
[3:02:20] day of Pentecost
[3:02:23] um
[3:02:24] so it looked like the fire was trying to
[3:02:26] keep you out
[3:02:27] but the fire was really trying to take
[3:02:29] you in
[3:02:31] Hallelujah
[3:02:33] and when you get some of that fire on
[3:02:35] you you'll be like Jeremiah it's like
[3:02:36] fire shut up on your bone in your bones
[3:02:40] Hallelujah
[3:02:43] anyway we gotta close let's just let's
[3:02:45] just worship him you got something to
[3:02:46] lead us in Chad I've rattled on longer
[3:02:50] than I expected to
[3:02:53] hallelujah
[3:02:58] it's nine o'clock
[3:03:01] that's not too too bad

[3:13:45] this is gonna
[3:13:47] this is going to get a little personal
[3:13:51] I don't even want to say this
[3:13:54] but I I have to because I want us to lay
[3:13:58] this before the Lord
[3:14:01] if you're here and you'd say Pastor
[3:14:04] I find myself at times
[3:14:07] feeling sorry for myself
[3:14:11] I just look around and
[3:14:14] I look Inward and I see all the hardship
[3:14:16] and
[3:14:19] my past and
[3:14:20] I just feel sorry for myself sometimes
[3:14:24] and and when I do I don't ever feel good
[3:14:27] you don't you don't ever leave that
[3:14:29] moment
[3:14:30] feeling good it
[3:14:32] it don't really make you feel better
[3:14:34] about life
[3:14:36] but I won't I believe the Lord wants to
[3:14:38] just deal with that in every one of us
[3:14:40] I don't know who could be that honest
[3:14:42] but I'm going to give you an opportunity
[3:14:43] just to be that honest right now and
[3:14:46] just say uh
[3:14:47] sometimes I just find myself feeling
[3:14:50] real sorry for myself
[3:14:53] and and what I have to deal with and
[3:14:56] what I Lord
[3:14:58] you see these Honest Hearts
[3:15:01] we're honest before you and and there
[3:15:05] are times that we feel that way
[3:15:08] we we look at other people's lives and
[3:15:10] sometimes look at ours and we think
[3:15:12] they've got it better than we do and
[3:15:13] easier than we do it
[3:15:15] and they complain more sometimes
[3:15:20] caught up in that gerbil wheel of
[3:15:23] sorry for herself
[3:15:25] and when we do Lord we're not confessing
[3:15:28] your word we're just talking out of our
[3:15:30] emotions
[3:15:31] I ask you tonight to
[3:15:33] create a clean heart in US
[3:15:37] would you pray with me right now if you
[3:15:39] feel it Lord would you create in me a
[3:15:41] clean art I want that out
[3:15:44] I want to know Lord that with your help
[3:15:46] and with you in in my life I can make it
[3:15:50] I can I can overcome
[3:15:53] I don't have to be a victim
[3:15:56] I don't have to live with a victim
[3:15:58] mentality caught up in that vicious
[3:16:01] cycle of comparison
[3:16:03] because you are so good to me Lord
[3:16:07] would you just take that route out would
[3:16:09] you rip that right out
[3:16:12] that that self-preserving
[3:16:14] sympathy that we carry for our own
[3:16:17] situation would you just rip that out
[3:16:20] and fill us with such gratitude and
[3:16:23] Thanksgiving of your faithfulness and
[3:16:26] your goodness in our lives
[3:16:29] sometimes we say well what if I'd have
[3:16:31] had a daddy or what if I'd have had a
[3:16:33] mother or what if I'd had a better daddy
[3:16:35] or better mother what if I'd have lived
[3:16:37] in another place
[3:16:40] but Lord tonight I just want to thank
[3:16:43] you for for my life and I want to give
[3:16:46] you thanks for every time you have seen
[3:16:49] me through
[3:16:51] Lord would you just feel your children
[3:16:53] right now with a spirit and with an
[3:16:56] attitude of of gratitude and
[3:16:59] Thanksgiving and Deliver Us
[3:17:02] somebody ain't praying that ought to be
[3:17:04] praying
[3:17:06] Deliver Us
[3:17:10] from that feeling sorry for ourselves
[3:17:13] and then getting mad with others because
[3:17:14] they don't seem to feel sorry enough for
[3:17:17] us
[3:17:18] but maybe they don't because we seem to
[3:17:20] have it covered
[3:17:22] forgive us Lord
[3:17:25] rip that out
[3:17:27] I want to thank you for my family I want
[3:17:30] to thank you for my life I want to thank
[3:17:32] you for this church I want to thank you
[3:17:35] for your goodness and your faithfulness

[3:18:15] believe God but I also know that
[3:18:17] prednisone at an early stage when you
[3:18:20] first start showing symptoms like that
[3:18:21] can make a world of difference
[3:18:24] would you ask the Lord whatever is going
[3:18:27] on it seems to be we don't like to put
[3:18:31] names on anything but it seems to be
[3:18:33] something operating on brother Austin
[3:18:35] like Bell's palsy and we don't want that
[3:18:38] we want that gone
[3:18:40] and uh it's a neurological condition
[3:18:43] caused by infection in the nerve

[3:18:56] what else your mouth drawn a little bit
[3:18:58] too and we know that the Lord can do it
[3:19:01] and we want to believe God for a miracle
[3:19:04] so that he wouldn't even have to go
[3:19:05] beyond that
[3:19:07] I don't mean to be you know I I wouldn't
[3:19:10] dare trying to put doubt in I'm just
