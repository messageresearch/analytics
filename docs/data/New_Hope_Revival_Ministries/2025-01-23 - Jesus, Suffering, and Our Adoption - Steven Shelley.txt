Description:
Discover how Jesus—though God in flesh—was perfected by suffering, and see how that same process applies to each of us. We were once thoughts in God’s mind, spoken into existence for this time, and equipped with everything needed to overcome. Let this brief message encourage you to stir up what’s already within and walk in your full, God-given identity.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if Jesus was God the word made flesh and if he was not perfected by his identity as God but rather the scripture said he was perfected by the things that he suffered though he were tempted in all manner like we are yet without sin the suffering is what brought him to the total surrender I believe it was beginning in the baptism when the voice said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in and it and the full adoption was announced when Mount of transfiguration when the voice said what hear him this is my son hear him hear what he has to say he has reached that place of total adoption somebody said I don't get why God did it that way you should he did it that way for you he did it that way for me so that we could see that being reduced to flesh condescending to a fleshly body with a middle ground a soul is a complicated process you were first a thought in the mind of God Amen but you couldn't be be all that you were as a thought floating around in his head you had to become a word it's not the the original thoughts that become the Original Seed but it's the original word it has to be spoken and what did he say about a thought a word is a thought expressed so that's who you were you were in the mind of God as a thought but In God's Time at his choosing we didn't get to choose when we came we didn't get to say hey I'll go in Ephesus or I'll go in thyra or I'll go in pergamus he chose I'm glad he did it means he knew more about us than we would know about ourselves and he sent us it's not a mistake I want you to know tonight it's not a mistake that you came to leod deia you are here by God 's choosing he chose the age for you to be in and he knew that everything you would need to overcome in this age would be provided for you when you got here this beautiful plan is rigged it's rigged in your favor because everything that he requires out of us he provides does that sound like somebody who wanted you to go to hell it sounds to me like somebody who wanted you to win and so he gave you everything you need by the revealed word of the hour to make a Rapture already we're not waiting on another deposit to be ready we're Desiring the stirring as brother brandom explained we're Desiring the stirring of what God's already poured into us not one drop of water was added to the Great Lake but when that wind began to blow and those waves began to stir he said there was a mighty Revival taking place out there on the water without the addition of anything and that's the reality that you and I are walking in the gene of God in you his seed in you is more than enough to help you get out of here so your struggle is not your physical body as some describe nor is it the innermost being the spirit the inside of the inside it's in that middle ground where the will kicks in where the thoughts produce the war and where the emotions complicate everything your soul is not your enemy your flesh body is not your enemy The Devil is the one working the life Li hello the accuser the father of All Eyes he's the one that's and look the reality is he knows that he can't change your predestination he can't change your election you were chosen elected sent here for such a time as this and Satan can't change that but what he can do is stir up the middle ground
