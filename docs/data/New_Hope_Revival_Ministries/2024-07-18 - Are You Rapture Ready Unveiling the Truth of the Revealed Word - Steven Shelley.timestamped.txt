[0:00] that's right and you and I better not
[0:02] only know we're fixing things up with
[0:04] God we better know we're Rapture
[0:08] Ready remember we're not going to be
[0:11] judged in Rapture by what's only
[0:13] abounding in our lives but we're going
[0:15] to be judged by what's put there the
[0:18] seed that is within us and I want you to
[0:21] know everything we need to make the
[0:23] Rapture is in us right now because we've
[0:27] received the word of God that's what it
[0:29] takes to get out of here but that seed
[0:32] is watered and at different times it
[0:35] blooms and produces fruit in our life
[0:38] and we want to live a fruitful life for
[0:40] him but we want to know that we are
[0:43] ready and the people started gathering
[0:46] in the 60s from the North and the South
[0:50] and the East and the West they gathered
[0:52] to Rally around a word that they
[0:56] discerned was sent to help prepare them
[1:00] for the Rapture I believe that the
[1:03] message and the revelation of Jesus
[1:06] Christ that he has sent to us is not for
[1:10] everyone I don't believe it was sent for
[1:14] the church at large I believe it was
[1:17] sent to an elected number I don't know
[1:20] the
[1:22] number I know there's some in the East
[1:24] and the and the and the west and the
[1:26] North and the South I know some have
[1:29] light skin in some have dark skin and
[1:31] some have un between in between skin
[1:34] some from one continent and some from
[1:37] another continent it's not about one
[1:40] church it's about those who have
[1:43] received a real unveiling of Jesus
[1:46] Christ it's the revealing of the
[1:50] word it's the word revealed that's what
[1:54] our wedding garment is what I think is
[1:57] the biggest deal is that we hold St
[2:00] ready under the influence of this
[2:03] revealed word until every fiber is
[2:08] filled with the Holy
[2:12] Ghost and Jesus said when he the Holy
[2:16] Ghost has come he will lead you guide
[2:21] you and direct you
[2:25] into all truth
