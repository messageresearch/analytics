[0:00] there is no accusation that we'll be
[0:03] able to stand against you in the court
[0:05] room of heaven I want to say something
[0:15] to God's people hold your head up
[0:18] quit shuffling pick up your feet and
[0:24] square your shoulders and walk like a
[0:28] child of God get your head up and let
[0:33] the devil know I don't have to defend
[0:36] myself in the courtroom of life
[0:39] I was far known predestinated called
[0:45] justified and glorified it doesn't make
[0:49] me perfect in my flesh but it makes me
[0:54] perfect in my spirit that's where the
[0:58] profession
[0:59] it lays there this morning by a Jean not
[1:05] blue jean but a life Jean a seed of God
[1:10] lays in that spirit on your control
[1:15] tower doesn't mean that in your flesh
[1:18] you're not going to be wrong you're
[1:23] gonna be wrong
[1:25] you're going to do something wrong
[1:26] you're gonna say something wrong and the
[1:30] enemy is going to exploit that he's
[1:34] going to try to exploit that moment and
[1:38] accuse you and defeat you and cause you
[1:42] to shuffle around like a nun we are
[1:46] children of the Most High God there is
[1:49] no accusation that will be able to stand
[1:53] against you in the courtroom of heaven
[1:55] because you have somebody who is
[2:00] standing up for your defense
[2:03] but here's the problem if you agree with
[2:07] the accuser and you live like someone
[2:11] under the accusation you're not living
[2:15] the Crucified life you're not living a
[2:17] laydown life you're living a defeated
[2:20] life and I want you to know that's not
[2:23] just bad for business that's not just
[2:26] bad for your mental health that's not
[2:28] just bad for your physical body but
[2:31] that's bad in the courtroom of God
[2:34] because you are buying
[2:40] you are binding the hands of your
[2:44] defense it's finally important in this
[2:52] righteous courtroom that you have no
[2:56] agreement with the accuser and the only
[3:00] way you can do that is to step out of
[3:03] which you know about yourself because
[3:07] you know yourself by the flesh and you
[3:10] know yourself by the soul mind will and
[3:14] emotions that is not who you are for on
[3:19] the inside of the inside of a born-again
[3:21] believer is the very eternal life of
[3:24] Almighty God and that life raises up
[3:28] that blood life races up to meet every
[3:31] accusation we better not do anything to
[3:34] bind his hand when he stands against the
[3:36] accuser on our behalf we better just say
[3:39] well talk on just go right ahead and
[3:44] speak up for me because here's the
[3:47] greatest part the one who defends you is
[3:49] the one who gives you grace and purpose
[3:51] to be able to live the version that he's
[3:56] defending oh if it were not for grace we
[4:01] could never be what God wanted us to be
[4:02] but he provided the grace to do that as
[4:05] well let me tell you something he went
[4:07] all the way he could have made a short
[4:10] cut you and I wouldn't had anything to
[4:11] say about it he didn't make a short cut
[4:13] the old songwriter said he could have
[4:15] called 10,000 angels to take him down
[4:17] off that cross and destroy the world and
[4:19] nobody would have had anything to say
[4:21] about it he was sovereign God but he
[4:22] loved you so much and he had made such a
[4:26] covenant with you before you were ever
[4:28] born he could not back off that covenant
[4:32] he could not change the terms of that
[4:34] agreement he had to go all the way to
[4:37] the cross and shed his own blood to pay
[4:40] the price for your sin
[4:42] you
