[1:12] our good friends at the gospel channel
[1:15] today's broadcast is part 6 in a series
[1:19] in the fullness of time and we have been
[1:24] studying together how that God the great
[1:28] architect has a blueprint for instance
[1:32] we studied together how that God came
[1:36] down condescended and was born of a
[1:40] virgin girl fulfilling the prophets
[1:44] prophecies and changing lives forever
[1:47] the Word of God made flesh again
[1:51] and I hope you've enjoyed the study we
[1:54] have had some good response and
[1:56] especially on part 4 where we talked
[2:00] about the Incarnation we talked about
[2:03] this messianic prophecy that was spoken
[2:06] in the book of Genesis chapter 3 and we
[2:11] just pray that the truth that we study

[5:21] great honor
[5:22] I consider it a great honor to be able

[5:27] we said before a lot of these things are
[5:29] available in other places on the
[5:31] internet however it's a wonderful thing
[5:34] to be able to bring them together in one
[5:36] convenient location that you can access
[5:39] it with your iPad your smartphone tablet
[5:42] whatever whatever it is that you use and
[5:45] we also have the songs of sister Janice

[5:55] the Lord these are some of her earlier
[5:57] recordings and they are very anointed
[6:00] and I know that you will be blessed and
[6:03] just a few weeks ago my wife and my
[6:06] children and I had the privilege of
[6:08] spending a couple weeks with sister
[6:09] green we tried to do that every year in
[6:12] the warm City of Tucson Arizona and it
[6:17] was a real blessing for me to be able to
[6:20] download the new hope revival ministries
[6:22] app on sister greens iPad and show her
[6:27] some of the material that's available
[6:29] there so go and look for that will you I
[6:31] want us to go back today to the
[6:34] foundation of this series although we
[6:37] read it just the last time we were
[6:39] together and the time before but I just
[6:41] want you to get the theme and I'll try
[6:43] to do it quickly so that we can move on
[6:45] to the portion of material that we have
[6:48] set aside for the broadcast today but we
[6:51] were studying from Galatians chapter 4
[6:54] the first seven verses now I say that
[6:57] the air as long as he is a child
[7:00] differeth nothing from a servant though
[7:03] he be Lord of all but is under tutors
[7:06] and governors until the time appointed
[7:09] of the Father even so we when we were
[7:13] children were in bondage under the
[7:16] elements of the world but when the
[7:19] fullness of the time was come God sent
[7:23] forth his son made of a woman made under
[7:27] the law to redeem them that were under
[7:30] the law that we might receive the
[7:33] adoption
[7:34] of Suns that is really good news and
[7:38] because she our sons God had sent forth
[7:42] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[7:46] crying Abba Father or Papa wherefore
[7:51] thou art no more a servant but a man a
[7:55] son but a son and if a son then an heir
[7:59] of God through Christ wherefore thou art
[8:04] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[8:07] then an heir of God through Christ I
[8:12] believe every word of that portion of
[8:15] Scripture Paul writing to the church in
[8:18] Galatia when we have studied in the
[8:21] other portions part one through five of
[8:24] this series in the fullness of times we
[8:27] talked about the way that God made we
[8:32] talked about how that he introduced his
[8:34] plan how that he chose Joseph and Mary
[8:38] and those who would play a very
[8:40] important role in playing out or
[8:44] fulfilling the plan that God had on his
[8:47] mind from before the foundation of the
[8:49] world we talked about the the Messianic
[8:53] prophecy given there in the third
[8:56] chapter of the book of Genesis we talked
[9:00] about the the seed of the woman and how
[9:04] God did something new something that had
[9:07] never been done in the earth before how
[9:10] he visited the womb of Mary how he
[9:13] placed in her this very special creation
[9:17] something that he had created
[9:20] specifically of took to bring forth God
[9:24] in in a body of flesh we're going to
[9:28] move forward now in in our study
[9:31] together we're going to share some more
[9:33] scriptures that talk about exactly what
[9:37] took place in that little manger in
[9:40] Bethlehem it was more than a the birth
[9:43] a good man much more than the birth of a
[9:47] prophet even more than the birth of a
[9:50] savior but it was indeed God
[9:54] condescending coming down choosing to
[9:57] live in a body of flesh in 2nd Timothy
[10:02] chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 he it says who
[10:06] hath saved us and called us with a holy
[10:10] calling not according to our works but
[10:14] according to his own purpose and grace
[10:18] see his own purpose his own blueprint
[10:23] his own plan which was given us in
[10:27] Christ Jesus before the world began now
[10:33] I better read that together without
[10:35] interrupting it who had saved us and
[10:38] called us with a holy calling not
[10:40] according to our works but according to
[10:43] his own purpose and grace which was
[10:45] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[10:49] world began but is now made manifest by
[10:55] the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ
[10:58] who hath abolished death and hath
[11:01] brought life and immortality to light
[11:04] through the gospel so here is another
[11:07] portion of Scripture revealing to us
[11:09] that God had a plan and in the fullness
[11:12] of time he actuated that plan he
[11:17] activated and fulfilled the greatest
[11:21] portion of that plan it was determined
[11:25] before the world began but verse 10
[11:27] tells us but is now made manifest by the
[11:31] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ one
[11:35] of my favorite portions of Scripture in
[11:37] the Gospels John chapter one verses one
[11:41] through three in the beginning was the
[11:44] word and the Word was with God and the
[11:48] Word was God
[11:51] that's such an important verse
[11:54] the word was not only with God it was
[11:59] but it was God God and the word were one
[12:07] and the same what a beautiful picture we
[12:12] can get with the eyes of the Spirit the
[12:16] same was in the beginning with God all
[12:20] things were made by him and without him
[12:23] was not anything made that was made and
[12:28] they're beautiful verses that go on to
[12:31] reveal this plan in John chapter 1 but
[12:35] look at verse 14 with me again because
[12:39] this is that in the fullness of time
[12:41] moment and the word we already learned
[12:46] the Word was with God and the Word was
[12:48] God it was the same from the beginning
[12:52] and now we learned that the word was
[12:55] made flesh the word the logos of God was
[13:03] made into flesh and dwelt among us and
[13:08] we beheld his glory the glory as of the
[13:12] only begotten of the Father full of
[13:15] grace and truth
[13:17] what a revelation to know that Jesus was
[13:23] the Word of God Jesus was God made flesh
[13:31] the Word of God put on flesh in the body
[13:36] of our Lord Jesus Christ and this was
[13:40] God's plan from before the beginning
[13:44] from before the foundation of the world
[13:47] and then in Luke chapter 2 we read what
[13:50] this looked like in verses 3 through 7
[13:54] and all went to be taxed and everyone
[13:58] into his own City and Joseph also went
[14:00] up from Galilee out of the city of
[14:03] Nazareth into Judea into the city
[14:07] David which is called Bethlehem because
[14:09] he was of the house and lineage of David
[14:13] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[14:17] being great with child and so it was
[14:20] that while they were there the days were
[14:22] accomplished that she should be
[14:24] delivered and she brought forth her
[14:27] firstborn son
[14:29] not just her firstborn son but she was
[14:34] bringing forth the Word made flesh she
[14:39] was bearing God made flesh what a
[14:43] beautiful plan she brought forth her
[14:47] firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling
[14:49] clothes and laid him in a manger they
[14:53] tell me that those swaddling clothes
[14:55] were not beautiful baby blue warm
[14:59] blankets like a baby might receive in a
[15:02] modern-day hospital but rather most
[15:06] likely the oily rags that were used to
[15:10] wipe down the sweaty animals when they
[15:12] would come in out of the field into the
[15:15] stable for rest and they would be rat
[15:18] wiped down with these oily rags - to
[15:23] help keep their body temperature right
[15:26] can you imagine what those sweaty rags
[15:30] may have smelt like but it was what was
[15:33] available the king of all kings not born
[15:37] in the nursery of a palace but in a in a
[15:40] stable in a barn some say in a Sukkah a
[15:45] temporary dwelling place where the
[15:49] animals were gathered and God made flesh
[15:53] the Word made flesh laid in a little
[15:56] stone manger a trough where the animals
[16:00] would come in and find their grain find
[16:03] their food and some believe that it was
[16:07] also a shelf that was used in the sukkah
[16:10] for the laying of bread where bread was
[16:13] laid either way what a place for the
[16:17] king of kings
[16:19] to be born what clothes swaddling
[16:22] clothes to be wrapped in but it doesn't
[16:25] matter so much the circumstances of his
[16:29] birth but who he was is what matters
[16:33] the circumstances are important because
[16:36] each and every detail as I will show you
[16:39] in a future study each and every detail
[16:42] of his prophesied coming was fulfilled
[16:46] to the letter
[16:47] that's the goodness of God to you and I
[16:51] look at Philippians chapter 2 with me
[16:54] verses 6 through 11
[16:56] who being in the form of God this is
[17:00] describing our Lord Jesus who being in
[17:03] the form of God thought it not robbery
[17:07] to be equal with God please understand
[17:11] he has no less God than what you
[17:15] understand of the father he was the same
[17:19] God he is the same God and of the same
[17:23] essence the body of our Lord as son the
[17:29] Word made flesh as the Son of God but no
[17:34] less God than the eternal spirit of the
[17:38] father when the father decided that he
[17:41] would come to this earth he came in a
[17:45] fleshly body jesus said when you have
[17:48] seen me you have seen the father because
[17:51] in his body was contained that spirit of
[17:55] the father the same essence of God who
[18:00] being in the form of God thought it not
[18:02] robbery to be equal with God but made
[18:06] himself of no reputation and took upon
[18:08] him the form of a servant and was made
[18:12] in the likeness of men and being found
[18:15] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[18:19] and became obedient unto death even the
[18:24] death of the cross
[18:25] verse 9 wherefore God also hath highly
[18:29] exalted him and
[18:32] giving him a name I think that it is so
[18:36] profound I know that there are many who
[18:40] who teach an eternal sonship but if
[18:44] there were an eternal sonship what would
[18:46] be his name because his name was not
[18:49] eternal he did not always have that name
[18:54] the scripture says and the father hath
[18:58] highly exalted him God hath highly
[19:02] exalted him and given him a name which
[19:06] is above every name that at the name of
[19:09] Jesus we sometimes say Yeshua his Hebrew
[19:14] name every knee should bow of things in
[19:18] heaven and things in earth and things
[19:20] under the earth and that every tongue
[19:22] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[19:26] to the glory of God the Father
[19:29] to recognize that Jesus is God to
[19:33] recognize that he is equal to God and
[19:36] that he is the word of God made flesh
[19:39] it's not to take anything away from the
[19:43] beauty of the office of the father in
[19:46] fact it is to recognize the expression
[19:50] of the father in a body of flesh
[19:53] remember the last verse says and every
[19:56] tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[19:59] to the glory of God and Father so this
[20:04] is this is a glory to the father when we
[20:08] recognize who Jesus is it's a glory to
[20:12] the Father and and the same the same
[20:14] reference in John 1:14 that we just read
[20:17] when we when we look at him when we look
[20:20] at Jesus we behold the glory as we
[20:25] behold his glory the glory of the only
[20:29] begotten of the Father full of grace and
[20:32] truth
[20:33] so don't get bogged down in the
[20:38] semantics of theology so that you so
[20:43] completely divide God
[20:46] into three pieces that you are not able
[20:49] to see how in spirit he is one many have
[20:56] made that mistake and it originated from
[20:59] the idea of trying to settle the people
[21:03] down who were coming out of pagan
[21:05] religions into Christianity and into
[21:09] what is known as a monotheistic a one
[21:13] God faith and many of the pagans from
[21:17] the Roman system and from the other
[21:19] Isles all these pagans coming in to
[21:22] accept Christ as Savior they were having
[21:24] a hard time making that mental shift
[21:27] because they were used to worshipping
[21:29] many many gods and now they've had to
[21:31] come and say wait a minute there is one
[21:33] God here o Israel the Lord thy God is
[21:36] one and they were making making some it
[21:39] was making it difficult and so many of
[21:42] the religious leaders in their efforts
[21:44] to try to describe it have actually
[21:48] taken away the beauty of the oneness of
[21:52] God and his love his great love for us
[21:57] and what I often say is when when I hear
[22:01] people emphasizing God is three I say oh
[22:06] he's he's much more than that he's much
[22:10] more there there is so much more in him
[22:14] than that he is healer and Savior and
[22:17] deliverer and counselor he's wonderful
[22:20] the mighty God the everlasting father
[22:22] lily-of-the-valley goes on and on and on
[22:25] but all of these are one because it is
[22:29] the same spirit the one and only spirit
[22:35] the eternal spirit of the Father look at
[22:39] Galatians chapter 4 the verse that we
[22:41] just read a moment ago here we are again
[22:43] in verse 4 but when the fullness of the
[22:46] time was come God sent forth his son
[22:49] made of a woman made under the law to
[22:52] redeem them that were under the law that
[22:54] we might receive the adoption of sons
[22:56] this is why God chose to do it
[22:59] way he did he did it to reveal sonship
[23:04] he did it to model sonship the the the
[23:09] love of the Father for the son the
[23:12] relationship of the son to the Father
[23:15] and because of that he has sent the
[23:18] spirit of his son into our hearts by the
[23:23] new birth so that we can cry my father
[23:28] Abba Father
[23:30] Papa God we are not the only begotten
[23:34] Son of God this is the body of our Lord
[23:37] Jesus Christ but we are also the sons of
[23:41] God for John one st. chapter tells us as
[23:45] many as are led by the Spirit of God
[23:48] they are the sons of God
[23:51] this happens by spiritual adoption we
[23:54] are given the authority of sons because
[23:58] of the work of the new birth on the
[24:01] inside of us every bit of this a part of
[24:04] God's plan
[24:04] he didn't just choose Bethlehem and
[24:07] choose Mary and choose the shepherds and
[24:10] decide who would be the king and who
[24:12] would be the Roman governor at the time
[24:14] all that was definitely a part of what
[24:18] had to be determined in the blueprint of
[24:20] God but he was thinking much deeper than
[24:24] the players on the stage he was also
[24:28] planning and thinking the effect the
[24:31] personal intimate effect that this Jesus
[24:37] the Word made flesh would have in our
[24:41] individual lives when he sent us that
[24:45] same spirit that was in the son that we
[24:49] could feel our connection and cry Abba
[24:52] Father I know we've talked about it
[24:55] before being in the shook in Jerusalem
[24:58] on the day before Shabbat and all the
[25:02] little children coming with their dads
[25:04] because most cases mom is at home
[25:08] preparing the home and the meal for for
[25:11] the Shabbat
[25:12] that will come in at sundown that
[25:14] evening so you see dad's with many many
[25:16] children sometime and in the crowd they
[25:19] can get separated and you'll hear these
[25:22] sweet little tender voices Abba ABBA
[25:26] it doesn't matter how many voices are
[25:28] crying Abba that father knows the voice
[25:31] of his child that child recognizes the
[25:34] voice of his father and this is what the
[25:37] scripture is telling us it's by that
[25:39] spirit of adoption it's by the same
[25:42] spirit that was on the son he sent forth
[25:45] that spirit into our lives that we might
[25:49] understand the grace the spirit of
[25:53] adoption whereby we can also say oh my
[25:57] papa
[25:57] my Abba my father oh this is it gets me
[26:05] every time I talk about it
[26:07] I mean I love to talk about the star and
[26:10] the wise men and and all the different
[26:14] aspects but all when we start talking
[26:17] about the the the huge transforming
[26:20] effect that this has on my life as an
[26:23] individual it was all about getting you
[26:27] and I into that intimate place of
[26:30] relationship with eternal God God loved
[26:34] you that much that he would go to all
[26:36] this planning to all this trouble indeed
[26:40] to all this suffering that he might make
[26:44] it possible for you to be one with him
[26:47] in the spirit Wow
[26:50] Oh how He loves us and in order to do
[26:54] that he had to think of everything God
[26:56] the Eternal Spirit of the Father had to
[26:59] plan at all he had to think about how
[27:03] that seed would be protected in Luke
[27:07] chapter 3 and verse 38 you'll you'll
[27:11] you'll get a glimpse as you read some of
[27:13] those early chapters of the Gospels
[27:16] you'll get a glimpse of the lineage of
[27:20] our Lord and in verse 38 of Luke 3 it
[27:24] says we
[27:25] was the son of eNOS which was the son of
[27:28] Seth which was the son of Adam which was
[27:32] the son of God that's one of my favorite
[27:35] verses in in the listing of all those
[27:39] lineages of who began who and who and
[27:42] and etc you come up to Adam and and and
[27:46] and who was before Adam only God God was
[27:50] his father and this was a lineage that
[27:54] had to be protected all the way down
[27:57] because even though the man Joseph would
[28:02] not have a physical contribution Mary
[28:07] would receive this gift into her womb
[28:10] and so the seed had to be protected even
[28:14] all the way through to Mary from the
[28:20] lineage of David all the way down
[28:22] because God chose Joseph even though he
[28:26] was an adopted father he cared for the
[28:32] Lord and raised the boy Jesus and loved
[28:36] him as his own but physically had no
[28:38] contribution because Mary was
[28:41] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and
[28:43] received this seed of a woman that was
[28:46] so different than any other conception
[28:51] because here is an egg that has already
[28:53] been infused with the very seed of God
[28:56] the very chosen gene life of God what a
[29:01] plan on a plan this is greater than
[29:04] medical doctors science can explain all
[29:07] of this because this was supernatural
[29:09] the holy spirit overshadowed her and
[29:12] prepared her physical body to receive
[29:14] this gift since it was the woman Eve in
[29:18] the garden who was deceived it was
[29:21] chosen that way and it would be a woman
[29:25] through whom the Savior would come
[29:28] remember the seed of a woman it was
[29:31] chosen that way and not the seed of a
[29:34] man and so what happened in the
[29:36] Arden played a very important role a
[29:39] very important aspect of the birth of
[29:43] our Lord and the way he came and that he
[29:46] came through a woman it goes all the way
[29:48] back to the beginning to the Garden of
[29:50] Eden first Timothy chapter 2 verses 13
[29:54] 14 and 15 read for Adam was first formed
[29:58] then Eve remember it was from Adam God
[30:04] reached inside of Adam and took out this
[30:09] portion that became Eve verse 14 and
[30:14] Adam was not deceived but the woman
[30:18] being deceived was in the transgression
[30:22] I have seen some angry people when you
[30:26] point out that verse of scripture to
[30:28] them I've heard them say some awful
[30:31] angry things what do you mean Adam was
[30:35] not deceived that's exactly right that's
[30:37] what the scripture said Adam knew
[30:40] exactly the Bible said that she did eat
[30:43] and gave to Adam and he did eat also so
[30:47] whatever it is that Eve partook in Adam
[30:50] partook of the very same thing and yet
[30:55] the Bible said Eve was deceived and Adam
[30:59] was not deceived what does that mean it
[31:01] means that Adam knew exactly what he was
[31:04] doing because his life as a son of God
[31:09] and his ministry as the first created
[31:14] son of god was about to unfold adam's
[31:19] ministry was that even though he was not
[31:22] deceived he partook he became guilty by
[31:28] partaking of the same thing he did not
[31:31] do it through deception deception means
[31:35] fooled into doing something beguiled
[31:38] into doing something you're not even
[31:40] really aware of all the consequences Eve
[31:45] opened up her life to reason
[31:47] and she believed what the enemy was
[31:50] telling her perhaps she thought that
[31:53] what she was doing would even be a
[31:55] blessing to her husband that this would
[31:58] in fact be something that would help him
[32:01] in the future that he would receive
[32:04] because remember the Satan through the
[32:07] serpent said why God knows that in the
[32:09] very minute that you do that your eyes
[32:11] are going to be opened you'll be just
[32:14] like God let me tell you something Adam
[32:17] was already just like God he was created
[32:20] in the image and in the likeness of God
[32:23] and from that image Eve was taken so so
[32:26] Satan was trying to sell something that
[32:28] was already theirs and by introducing
[32:32] the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
[32:34] of good and evil I'm telling you this
[32:36] this opened the door for thought
[32:39] patterns that have literally attacked
[32:45] nearly to the point of destruction
[32:47] mankind all down through the ages Adam
[32:52] in that original creation had no real
[32:56] understanding of good and evil it was
[32:58] all good that's all he had for a concept
[33:03] was that which God had created as good
[33:07] once you add in the knowledge that there
[33:10] is also evil you'd think that that would
[33:13] be enough to keep man only on that which
[33:16] is good
[33:18] but instead it opened a temptation that
[33:22] forbidden fruit
[33:24] mentality that has plagued a man ever
[33:27] since but God knew this none of this
[33:30] took God by surprise he had Adam though
[33:34] he was not deceived
[33:36] he knew that Adam would step in that he
[33:40] would also partake and in doing so he
[33:43] would become a very important covering
[33:46] for the sin of Eve now when God comes
[33:50] down in the cool of the day Adam is
[33:53] standing there a representation of his
[33:56] own bride of his own wife also guilty
[33:59] but
[34:00] not by deception the scripture goes on
[34:03] to say that notwithstanding even though
[34:06] the woman being deceived was in the
[34:08] transgression notwithstanding she shall
[34:10] be saved in childbearing if they
[34:13] continue in faith and charity and
[34:16] holiness and sobriety this right here
[34:19] that shows us that from the Garden of
[34:22] Eden there was a prophecy going forth of
[34:25] how the answer to the sin problem was
[34:30] going to come and how the answer to the
[34:34] deception problem was going to come it
[34:37] was going to come through childbearing
[34:39] not just the childbearing of godly women
[34:43] but the childbearing of a godly woman
[34:46] Mary who was going to give herself be it
[34:50] unto me according to thy word and in the
[34:54] bearing of this special gift child who
[34:58] had remember blood not the blood of Mary
[35:02] not the blood of Joseph but the blood of
[35:06] God God's created blood for redemption
[35:09] but yet to get this blood to the earth
[35:13] so that it could be shed so that it
[35:17] could cover the sins of mankind
[35:19] childbearing childbirth was a very
[35:22] important part of this process this word
[35:26] childbearing is only used one time from
[35:29] the Greek in the entire New Testament
[35:30] and it means a specific one it's not
[35:36] just talking about childbearing in
[35:38] general but it's a Greek word that
[35:41] speaks about one specific child that has
[35:45] been born it's interesting to know that
[35:48] because because this one special child
[35:53] was born
[35:54] it makes redemption available to every
[35:57] godly woman if they continue in faith
[36:00] and charity and holiness with sobriety
[36:02] and also to every man what a beautiful
[36:05] way to look at this scripture in in the
[36:10] texts when we look at this verse it
[36:14] actually would read through her
[36:17] childbearing referring back to Eve as a
[36:23] type or a symbol of another woman
[36:27] another one who would come and bring
[36:30] forth from her loin Eve brought forth
[36:33] from her body the knowledge of good and
[36:37] evil two seeds were represented in that
[36:42] birth twins but in the birth that her
[36:47] childbearing pointed to Mary
[36:50] there was only one seed brought forth
[36:52] the very seed of God oh my I love the
[36:56] scripture I really do and first
[36:58] Corinthians 15 helps us to see this I
[37:01] hope I've not bogged you down
[37:03] 1st Corinthians chapter 15 verses 45
[37:07] through 47 and so it is written I pray
[37:11] when we are in a program like the one
[37:14] today where we have lots of scriptures I
[37:17] hope you get your Bible I hope you'll
[37:20] get your Bible out and read them in your
[37:22] own Bible for yourself mark them down if
[37:25] you can't go to youtube and watch the
[37:28] episode again if you're really
[37:30] interested in these scriptures and
[37:32] taking a little more extra time to study
[37:34] them or go to the app find the program
[37:37] and get your Bible on one knee and your
[37:41] your your smartphone on the other knee
[37:44] or whatever and mark these down in your
[37:46] Bible because this is your story these
[37:50] scriptures not only tell about God's
[37:52] gift to mankind but they are telling the
[37:55] story of God's gift to you as an
[37:58] individual as a part of corporate
[38:01] mankind this is my story what happened
[38:05] in the garden is part of my story what
[38:08] happened in Bethlehem is part of my
[38:11] story what happened on a hill right
[38:13] outside of Jerusalem is my story
[38:17] hallelujah what happened on the day of
[38:19] Pinnacle Point it's my story
[38:22] because I'm
[38:24] connected to this truth I'm a Parchin to
[38:27] bear it to live it to be an example of
[38:32] it
[38:32] first Corinthians 15:45 and so it is
[38:35] written the first man Adam was made a
[38:39] living soul pause a moment remember here
[38:44] is this body created from the dust but
[38:48] it was not until God came and breathed
[38:51] breath into the nostrils of Adam who
[38:56] think about this the Eternal Spirit of
[39:00] God came into the garden nose to nose
[39:05] mouth to mouth with Adam and breathed
[39:09] into him the ruach ha'qodesh
[39:13] the very the very breath of the spirit
[39:16] the very breath of eternal God and when
[39:19] that breath was entering into Adam the
[39:24] spirit breath entering into Adam the
[39:28] body of flesh the connection between the
[39:32] body of flesh and the Eternal Spirit of
[39:35] God there had to be something to to
[39:38] connect the two there had to be a bridge
[39:41] and the bridge between body and spirit
[39:45] was soul and man became a living soul
[39:51] and in that soul is the mind and the
[39:55] will and the emotions so look at this
[39:59] verse in light of that truth the first
[40:02] man Adam was made a living soul and I
[40:05] just explained how that was the last
[40:08] Adam who is that last Adam the Lord
[40:13] Jesus Christ in the same way that Adam
[40:17] knew no deception and yet he willfully
[40:22] took on this sin joined himself with
[40:27] this sin he was guilty there's nothing
[40:31] here that says Adam wasn't guilty it
[40:33] says he wasn't deceived meaning he knew
[40:37] what he was doing he was guilty of that
[40:40] sin but he knew that he was and he was
[40:45] doing it for a purpose a beautiful
[40:49] purpose it was a sermon it was a symbol
[40:52] and a type that preaches to us about the
[40:55] coming of the last Adam the first man
[40:58] Adam was made a living soul the last
[41:00] Adam was made a quickening spirit a
[41:04] resurrection spirit verse 46 howbeit
[41:08] that was not first which is spiritual
[41:12] but that which is natural Adam and
[41:15] afterward that which is spiritual we had
[41:17] to see Adam the first Adam becoming a
[41:21] living soul which connected him in the
[41:24] natural he was of the natural and we see
[41:29] by resurrection our Lord becoming a
[41:31] quickening spirit a resurrecting spirit
[41:34] which is not of the natural but it is a
[41:36] spiritual event and listen remember what
[41:40] the scripture said if that same spirit
[41:42] quickening spirit resurrection life
[41:45] spirit if that same spirit that raised
[41:48] Jesus from the dead dwell in you it
[41:51] shall also make alive it shall also
[41:54] quicken revive resurrect your mortal
[41:59] body so what a promise we have for the
[42:02] future even if we leave this earth by
[42:05] the way of death there is a resurrection
[42:08] spirit life that will resurrect and
[42:12] revive and quick and even the mortal
[42:15] body I also believe that this is a
[42:17] spiritual Scripture that is not only
[42:20] referring to a future physical rebel
[42:23] resurrection not only referring to a
[42:25] future physical resurrection but it also
[42:28] describes that spiritual quickening that
[42:31] takes place when the Word of God finds
[42:36] that resting place in us and the spirit
[42:38] of Revelation anoints that word and it
[42:41] becomes quickening resurrection life on
[42:43] the inside
[42:43] I've been sitting where the Word of God
[42:46] was going forth and felt like there was
[42:48] a man coming out of the tomb
[42:50] me so much alive I can't say that it
[42:55] happens every time I sit under preaching
[42:57] but I have sat under preaching at times
[42:59] when the word was really going forth
[43:02] where I really felt like a dead man was
[43:04] coming alive in me that is a very
[43:07] important experience because it gives
[43:10] you something to hold on to when there
[43:13] are no feelings because there are times
[43:16] when we live this thing entirely by
[43:18] faith not at all by sight not at all by
[43:21] feeling we just have to take God at His
[43:24] Word and remember the times that we have
[43:26] seen in the times that we have heard the
[43:28] times that we have felt now watch verse
[43:31] 47 the first man is of the earth earthy
[43:36] the second man is the lord from heaven I
[43:40] want you to know this is New Testament
[43:44] understanding of what took place all
[43:47] those years before showing us that God
[43:52] knew exactly what he was doing the last
[43:56] Adam restored what mankind lost in the
[44:02] first Adam we needed the last Adam one
[44:06] who also was not deceived he wasn't
[44:11] fooled into the trial fooled into this
[44:15] into the crucifixion he knew exactly
[44:18] what he was doing he was made sin though
[44:22] he personally knew no sin though he
[44:25] personally committed no sin he was made
[44:29] he was transformed into sin so that he
[44:33] might stand before God on my behalf
[44:38] like Adam was willing to stand before
[44:41] God on Eve's behalf can you see that can
[44:46] you see that the Bride of Christ is
[44:50] really her type is of of the eve of the
[44:57] earthly eve of the first Eve that what
[45:01] Eve how he failed in the
[45:04] way that Eve failed by receiving this
[45:07] lie of the enemy she received a seed of
[45:11] discrepancy she reasoned the Word of God
[45:14] away listening to a lie believing a lie
[45:17] acting upon a lie there was another
[45:20] woman that we have identified as Mary or
[45:24] Miriam who received a seed by saying be
[45:30] it unto me according to thy word she
[45:32] didn't receive it in deception she
[45:35] didn't receive it in sin she didn't
[45:37] receive it even in a sexual act she
[45:40] received that seed in a supernatural
[45:42] overshadowing which is a type of exactly
[45:46] what was going on in the garden it
[45:48] pointed to it and now today there's a
[45:51] bride Church being raised up to serve
[45:56] the Lord and we have a choice you have a
[46:00] choice which woman of God will you will
[46:04] you carry on which woman of God will you
[46:08] be identified with Eve who reasoned the
[46:13] Word of God away and created quite a
[46:16] mess or will you as a bride of Christ
[46:19] identify yourself with a Miriam with a
[46:22] Mary who said oh it's going to be
[46:26] reproach it's going to be misunderstood
[46:29] it's not going to be easy there's going
[46:31] to be accusation but be it unto me
[46:34] according to thy word yes friend there
[46:38] is a little bride around the world that
[46:42] God is working in and dealing with and
[46:44] speaking to getting us ready because
[46:49] there is a work yet to be done and there
[46:51] is a character an attribute that must be
[46:56] manifested in this last day the
[47:00] resurrection life of Jesus Christ so the
[47:03] last Adam restored to mankind what was
[47:07] lost in the first Adam this is called
[47:10] reconciliation to restore to the
[47:13] original position before the fall
[47:17] and even beyond look at another verse of
[47:20] scripture in the time that we have left
[47:22] look at Ephesians chapter 1 verses 9
[47:26] through 12 here's another another gospel
[47:29] message here's another letter another
[47:33] epistle talking about this great mystery
[47:36] unfolding in the fullness of the time
[47:39] having made known unto us verse 9 the
[47:44] mystery of his will according to his
[47:48] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[47:51] himself that in the dispensation of the
[47:55] fullness of times he might gather
[47:59] together in one all things in Christ
[48:06] this is what it was about this is what
[48:10] the garden was about this is what the
[48:13] the Tabernacle the temple was about this
[48:17] is what the backsliding of Israel was
[48:20] about and the prophets of restoration
[48:22] were about this is what the Gospels were
[48:25] about the life of Jesus Christ the
[48:28] crucifixion the death the resurrection
[48:32] this is what the day of Pentecost was
[48:35] about this is what the glorious
[48:38] revelation that flowed to us through the
[48:41] New Testament was about this is what all
[48:43] of the seven church ages were about it
[48:46] was about these verses that in the
[48:50] fullness of times when all of these
[48:53] things had happened when everything had
[48:55] been pointing pointing pointing pointing
[48:59] to Christ from the Garden of Eden to the
[49:02] cross everything was pointing to Christ
[49:05] and the work of redemption that he would
[49:08] accomplish at the cross
[49:09] from that moment on everything is not
[49:13] just pointing to Christ but it's
[49:16] pointing to a bride to two sons who
[49:21] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[49:24] we cry Abba Father it speaks now it's
[49:29] pointing now
[49:30] to a corporate man a many membered body
[49:35] the body of Christ has one head but we
[49:38] are many members the scripture said it's
[49:41] talking about and pointing to an
[49:44] overcoming people
[49:46] to him that overcometh will I grant
[49:50] these gifts will I grant these things
[49:52] these blessings I'm telling you there
[49:55] are going to be there is a people who
[50:00] will raise up in this hour overcoming
[50:03] the spirit of the age how will they do
[50:07] it because they're smart because they're
[50:09] good-looking because they go to the
[50:11] right church no no no no no because
[50:14] they're chosen because they have been
[50:17] identified with Christ since before the
[50:19] foundation of the world let me go back
[50:22] and read instead of interrupting the
[50:23] scripture having made known unto us the
[50:26] mystery of his will here it is how do we
[50:29] know the mystery oops I'm interrupting
[50:31] how do we know the mystery of his will
[50:33] by looking at Jesus and his ministry by
[50:38] reading the New Testament because no one
[50:40] had a revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[50:43] Bible like the Apostle Paul read those
[50:47] those scriptures some of which I've
[50:50] shared with you that's how the mystery
[50:53] of his will has been revealed and made
[50:55] manifest having made known unto us the
[50:58] mystery of his will according to his
[51:01] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[51:04] himself that in the dispensation of the
[51:07] fullness of times he might gather
[51:08] together in one all things in Christ and
[51:15] if you say wait a minute I'm not a thing
[51:18] well listen how it qualifies this both
[51:21] which are in heaven and which are on
[51:24] earth even in him we're a part of that
[51:29] we're a part of the gathering together
[51:32] of all things in Christ things which are
[51:36] in heaven things which are in the earth
[51:38] but even in him all in him verse 11 in
[51:42] whom
[51:44] also we have obtained an inheritance
[51:49] what what did we do to deserve an
[51:53] inheritance how is it that we get an
[51:57] inheritance who invited us to the
[52:00] reading of the will listen this didn't
[52:05] just happen the night you walked down
[52:07] the aisle and gave your heart to the
[52:09] Lord at an old revival meeting Oh No
[52:12] in whom also we have obtained an
[52:14] inheritance being predestinated
[52:18] according to the purpose of him who
[52:23] worketh all things after the counsel of
[52:27] his own will that we should be to the
[52:34] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[52:39] Christ what a message if you can only
[52:44] see if I can only see what this
[52:48] scripture is revealing to us we receive
[52:52] an inheritance we are made partakers of
[52:56] Christ because we are a part of his
[53:01] predestinated plan for planet Earth we
[53:05] have been chosen in him since before the
[53:09] foundation of the world we've read those
[53:11] scriptures to you before remember that
[53:15] biblical predestination is foreknowledge
[53:18] so don't let that trip you up
[53:20] God knew your choice this is never to
[53:25] say you didn't have a choice it's
[53:27] freewill free moral agency I'm I know
[53:31] that that's biblical enough I've got to
[53:33] stand by that
[53:34] but this predestination is a
[53:36] foreknowledge according to the New
[53:38] Testament
[53:39] it's a foreknowledge II it's God knowing
[53:41] before before it happened before you ask
[53:46] before you were born before you went to
[53:48] the altar in whom also we have obtained
[53:53] an inheritance being predestinated
[53:55] according to the purpose of Oh
[53:58] you Lord that you have predestinated me
[54:00] according to your purpose thank you O
[54:03] Lord that I have an inheritance thank
[54:06] you that you called me to the reading of
[54:08] the will and I've become the beneficiary
[54:11] of the resurrection life of Jesus Christ
[54:14] I stand justified not because I'm worthy
[54:18] not because I deserve it but because
[54:20] it's my inheritance justification is our
[54:25] inheritance sanctification is our
