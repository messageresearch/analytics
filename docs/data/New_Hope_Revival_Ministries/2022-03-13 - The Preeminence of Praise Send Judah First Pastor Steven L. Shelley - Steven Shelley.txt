surrender to your king [Music] arise in this and the place see we sing to your king i'm surrendering by all i surrender to the kings [Music] the song of your redeemed as the saints of every nation they're awakening to sing oh and from my heart there comes an envelope oh to hear the heaven drink this is our song oh a song [Music] [Music] oh i'm surrendering my all oh i surrendered to the king i surrendered to the king let the worshipers arise [Music] i'm surrendering my own [Music] and father i see that you were [Music] so let your kingdom come lord let it live in me this is my prayer lord this is [Music] [Music] i surrender to the kings [Music] i just want to read you this quote most of you get the text and you heard it but i want you to understand what we mean when we sing let the worshipers arise there is an authority in the bride of christ that the church at large does not have she doesn't have that same authority she doesn't have his heart like you do and his ear like you do not in this hour but this is what the prophet said he said now sons and daughters who has the most power before god what is an angel an angel is a servant that's right that right he said they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side the sinner the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven [Music] oh hallelujah the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son son has more authority than a servant of course so when you come into his presence to praise him you don't come as a beggar you don't come as just a servant you have a special invitation as one of his sons to come before him and worship him this is the week of purim and on wednesday night as the sun goes down we begin to think about purim on thursday until thursday night and we think about a little girl she wasn't much to look at but born for a purpose born for a reason little hadassah we call her esther and she came knowing not in the moment what her purpose was but god revealed it to her and when all the other girls concubines came they were all painted up like the world likes to paint up dolled up like the world and frizzy hair and jewels and all that stuff hanging on her on them and they didn't find favor but esther she asked the servant she asked the chamberlain of the king what must i do what can i do to gain his favor oh let me tell you something little bride god has sent a servant to tell us from the word what we must do to be pleasing in his side let's come like esther today i want to worship him i want to get in here and worship him like esther i want to be able to reach up when he extends his scepter toward us today i want to be able to reach up and touch the tip of his scepter and hear him say my beloved what do you have need of today oh make sure as you're going before the king to worship him you remember who you are you're a son of the most high god you weren't born in the ephesian church age you weren't born in thyatira or smyrna or all the other philadelphia you were born for such a time as this to live in laodicea the most wicked age of all not so that you can be overcome by the lukewarm spirit of the age but so that you can overcome in all things remember your authority as you worship him today [Music] i'm surrendering my own [Music] let the worshipers arise [Music] i'm surrendering my i surrender to the kings and father i hear it growing louder the song of your redeemed as the saints of every nation they're awakening to sing and from our heart there comes an anthem oh to hear the heavens [Music] [Music] oh i surrender to your king i surrender to the kings [Music] lord just holding your hand so let your kingdom come oh let it live in me this is my prayer lord this is my plea oh let the worshipers arrive we'll rise in this place [Music] [Music] let the worshipers [Music] i'm surrendering [Music] i surrender to the king let the worshipers [Music] i'm surrendering my i surrender to see you like that again let the worshipers around [Music] [Music] i'm surrendering [Music] we live to worship you or we worship your holy name [Music] teach us the royal protocol for how we come before the king teach us the royal protocol oh the prophet said fools walk with hobnailed shoes where angels fear to trod lord teach us the royal protocol for standing before the king of kings and the lord of lords that we might find favor with him would you just pour your love on him for just a moment before the next song you don't always have to be singing a song take a moment right now tell him you love him let your heart connect with him right now lord i love you i love you i i love you i adore you lord i'm so thankful to stand in your holy presence and call you my lord call you my redeemer my savior come on lift your voice let's let this build up in here see what god will do when the word comes let's let it build up just a moment whoa [Music] hallelujah for such a time as this for such a time as this you've called us for such a time as this lord may we not miss our opportunity lord may we not miss our opportunity lord we have a divine appointment with the king of kings [Music] may we not be late may we not miss our opportunity to stand before the king of kings lord we recognize today that it's not just us it doesn't just matter for us but we as esther we are intercessors for our generations we are intercessors lord for our generations had she not been accepted in that moment what might have befallen the jews what might have happened to your people lord but she did not miss her chance she kept her appointment lord we have a divine appointment with the king may we not miss it lord may we not miss it lord [Music] god i thank you that you're sovereign and if there's been times that we have missed it you have always brought salvation through another your ways are not dependent on us but you desire to use us lord you desire to raise us up as both worshipers and intercessors in this wicked hour oh hallelujah we're going to see the end of haman we're going to see the end of haman your bride is going to see the lineage of haman cut off hallelujah hung on his own words haman will hang on his own words the bride will always overcome she will always prosper if she comes boldly yet humbly before you lord we are here to say be lifted up yeshua have a sheoc lord jesus christ i will stand i want you to just tell the lord before we go on i will stand for my children church she risked her life all the king had to do was knot his head to one side and off with her head she risked her life to come before the king for her children for her grandchildren for all the generations of israel we owe that little woman don't you forget she was a woman chosen for her people for the salvation of her people other women like we sing in the great speckled bird all the other churches are against her they envy her glory and her fame they seek to find fault with the prophet's teachings but theologians find no mistake [Music] vashti and all the other women all the other candidates they found fault with esther brother branham sometimes talked about the jews he called them hook nosed jews which today would be a very very detrimental thing to say a very very rude thing to say but in his generation he just wanted you to know they didn't come esther didn't come with her beauty it wouldn't have been enough she came dressed in the word for her hour the word for her hour her holy ghost had helped her get dressed and get ready i want you to just tell the lord one more time i'm standing for my children i'm standing for my grandchildren i'm standing for my generations oh god this is serious to me church i don't mean to drag it out but this is serious to me what a privilege that god would allow you into his presence to cry out for your generations for our children and our grandchildren our great-grandchildren as many as the lord our god will call until the last gentile has come in and the little bride goes to live in this palace forever and ever thank you for the divine appointment lord of all the millions and billions you chose a little bride we thank you for the invitation lord

glory full of glory it is joy unspeakable and full of glory all the happy [Music] it is like a great or glowing well springing up within my souls [Music] i want you to go ahead and be seated god bless you i realize you were standing in nearly an hour and uh thank you so much that you were putting forth that much effort and energy and strength into worshiping the lord and then we just went on and stood for the everything else a prayer request and then prayer and uh i like it when everybody's standing since i have to but i understand that uh legs and backs and ankles and it's not just old folks either when i woke up this morning i wasn't able to put all the weight on my right foot but i just want you to see now what the lord did he did that he did that i had to kind of turn it sideways this morning when i woke up and yesterday was in a lot of pain with the sciatic and all those different things going on but you just ought to get in his presence you just ought to put your feet under the masters table and see what the lord will do we look like mighty few in number this morning uh looking back to how many we had last sunday but you know i just know that god knew all about it he knew all about it and there were some that i was expecting this morning that i haven't seen some that were traveling and i don't know what i pray that all is well with them but i just appreciate the goodness of the lord it is so wonderful to have jenna with us and her mother sister melinda we are so glad to have you all this morning god bless you i think today they have driven the furthest to be here they drove all the way from arlington texas and uh brought a few things and the boy that makes it real to see jenna coming in with her rug she may not have much of anything else but she's got a rug to put on the floor and benjamin said oh daddy feel how soft it is i said i'm glad it's soft you may lay on it one of these days and she may put you on it you may say there's your bed and uh but anyway god is good we couldn't have gotten as far as we have in the remodel of moss place and i tell you she would be so happy every time i go in there i i can just hear her i can hear her voice and in my heart and i can hear her say uh two things one i didn't know this place could look so good two why didn't you do this for me [Laughter] but everybody knows if it was going to be done for anybody else other than her or maybe me uh benjamin was uh he was the first grandson and and she didn't always uh she didn't always uh make them all feel equal but uh she loved them all i know that i know that it would be uh special to her to know that that they're going to be starting their life there and uh it couldn't be would not have been possible if if we hadn't had some real help and we appreciate it very very much some of the young brothers have really spent hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and that's not an exaggeration i'm asking god to bless them abundantly i'm so thankful that they don't work by the hour i'm asking god to pay them even better than the hour and there are many i'm not calling names because there's many that have done some things but there are a couple of brothers who have been there all the time just about and i really really do appreciate that i feel like i've already had more to say in the service than anybody else and it's my turn again but i just couldn't help myself i couldn't really couldn't help myself because i think sometimes we forget what worship is supposed to be about not not you folks so much but i i just think it's important to remember that it's it's not just to make him feel good you know it it's it's for us it's to get in that presence and be changed i i heard brother branham say just recently in a sermon that there's nothing like being in that presence of god because your spiritual cells just soak it in like a sponge and when you get in trouble or you have problems or something that that strength that you that you gleaned in soaked in it's there residually on a monday morning when you don't want to get up and and on a tuesday when things aren't going good on the job and a wednesday when the children are about to run you crazy and come on and on a thursday when you've got a bunch of workers that have called out no matter what your situation or a school teacher we've got a few teachers here and uh when they come back after a long weekend and they act like they've had sugar the whole time they were gone and there and you've got to try to bring them to some kind of a place where you can help them i'm so thankful so thankful that we are not wasting our time when we come and soak in his presence can you say amen well let me make these announcements really quick this tuesday night no excuses accepted well brother maybe i might accept an excuse for someone who lives four hours away brother reed i would i think that's a good excuse but most of us don't live four hours away uh by the way i don't i haven't done this i've not said a whole lot about it but i uh i would like to mention that today is brother reed's 12th weekend with us in a row driving nearly four hours one way to get here i think that's just a blessing i appreciate it i really appreciate it we've become very quick friends and he means a lot to me and he does to my family and we are just very very thankful that he finds something among us we know what it is i'm sorry to tell you it's not you and i it's his presence it's the fact that he's here i will let brother reed slide tuesday night as long as i can tell that he's streaming but the rest of you please try to come we don't have a special speaker on tuesday night very often what once a year twice a year maybe three times a year and uh brother caleb doron it's been a few years since he's been here and he's meant a lot to the church in the past he really has god has used him in special ways for us he has a servant heart he has taken such good care of our family when we go to tucson since the first time i met him oh i don't know how many years 12 years 13 years or more ago now i don't know without stopping to try to count he walked up to me he was at the tucson tabernacle in those days and shook my hand and he said so your brother shelly you know that's always a kind of a loaded statement you wonder what that means you

something hold you back sometime i thought so so let's come believing miss a meal miss a row of meals a day of meals do something to say lord i'm setting myself apart for a divine appointment with you and uh brother it's wonderful when we can have somebody that don't know too much about us and we haven't had a lot of fellowship except when he was here the weekend and we've known them now for several years i had a phone call this week i don't know if i should mention it here but it's too late from sister anna's dad who is brother forest farmer and remember he's the one that was healed in brother branham's meetings and uh of a being crippled and his dad sitting up there in the balcony and brother branham looks up and says there's a man up there and a boy that's crippled and and the brother farmer's dad's mind was saying uh well that you know that could be anybody it's a big crowd and you can't really see you know all the thoughts how do i know that's real and he said why brother uh mr farmer you just let the holy ghost call your name out like that he knew it was for him and he jumped up and his son was healed just a few weeks ago a couple weeks ago now he was in the hospital and it looked bad there for with heart attack and lots of blockages it looked bad there for a few days we all prayed and god brought him through and i'd never spoken to him on the phone before but he called this week and we had a wonderful time he would love to be here and i've invited him specifically to come that weekend and give his testimony out of his own words those beautiful arkansas you know everybody uh we get reminded from time to time about our accent well if you think alabamians have an accent you got to go to kentucky and arkansas you'll hear one there too you got to hear that beautiful well i didn't know his number but i just took a chance and answered and as soon as he said well hello there i knew exactly who it was wouldn't it be great to hear him give his testimony here i don't know but god spared him for some reason maybe you and i are a little part of that to be able to hear that testimony i i'm looking forward to it i know i'm taking some time here sister cindy chadwick we love you very much and we want to wish you a happy birthday tomorrow god bless you amen sister emily wassinger even though she's still in my contacts uh by her maiden name she is a was singer and we are so very blessed she's standing there you all turn around don't embarrass her too much but just turn around she's standing there holding that beautiful beautiful baby girl and miss emily has a birthday tomorrow so would you all wish her a happy birthday i think she was one of the first babies that was born in our church when we first started out and god started bringing people and i believe she was one of the first babies and she was very special to me uh as a little baby i just thought she was amazing and i still do i still do i'm so thankful for god blessing her and r.j and those two wonderful children uh david yantis i think you're all right too he's got a birthday on tuesday let's wish david a happy birthday [Applause] he's mighty glad that the tebos didn't stop with emily but that they kept having girls because he got to marry one and then i mentioned in the in the worship that purim begins on uh wednesday night through thursday if you happen to live in a walled city i don't believe anybody in here lives in a wall city city then then you have purim shushan or shushan purim the next day if you're in jerusalem and i've been i've been in jerusalem during purim you celebrate it two days but outside just one day somebody said well what do you do to celebrate it well we eat hamentashen of course we eat the most amazing cookies for purim but we try to remember you got your your little bit of a rehearsal this morning it's one of the most wonderful stories god has been so good he has been so good to preserve his people and i want you to know that every just about every other day a group of ukrainian jews are coming out and landing in the homeland oh hallelujah if you saw my little live on on whenever it was this week i mentioned something a friend of mine was in israel and staying at a five-star hotel on on the on the sea on excuse me in tel aviv on the mediterranean and it's a beautiful beach i'm telling you it's a beautiful place and got a notification and said i'm so sorry to tell you your room is canceled because we're giving your room to refugees from the ukraine five-star hotel and my friend was delighted he doesn't have to have it he's delighted and he said what country do you know of gives a refugee from another country a five-star hotel on the beach there's no land like the homeland that's right god has certainly kept his word in the nation of israel i told brother farmer that's what we were talking about i told him those people who come there many of them planned to be there temporarily but they don't know what to expect when they get there they're going to be treated with so many different things blessed with so many gifts provided everything they have need to start their new life in israel the israeli government has no intention of of encouraging them to go back to the ukraine because some of them understand the importance of the jew being in the homeland and they're going to give them everything they can get their hands on they're going to immediately enroll them in a free hebrew school they can do that within the first few days of being there if you want to know the home language you you there you go and they're going to help them with leasing a piece of property to live in and and all kinds of things and this this blessing goes on for years when they're able to buy their first automobile all the taxes are are stricken off they owe no taxes to the government anything the government can do to help them get settled in the land and you may have seen the pictures that i saw this week of ukrainian jews that have never been to israel before oh i can't help myself i i can't help myself you you think about putin and all of his evil deeds and uh you got charismaniacs praying this and that and the other and they don't even know what they're praying don't even know what they're calling on you just ought to hold your peace and you ought to say thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven because whether you realize it or not the prophet of the old testament said the the fishers will come and the hunters will come and god sent theodore herzl as a fisher in the late 1800s to start the zionism movement to beg the jews to encourage the jews it was the beginning of the of the calling in the aliyah of the diaspora the scattering of the jews were now being gathered in and herzl never lived to see the establishment of the nation but his desire was to be buried in the land and he helped encourage hundreds and thousands of jews to go home and i particularly enjoy standing over his grave and thanking him every time i'm there thank you sir for having a vision to fulfill scripture but many didn't come by the fishers are you with me i'm preaching and i haven't taken the text many didn't come by the fishermen so the hunters had to come and a stalin came on the scene and a hitler came on the scene and what the fishers couldn't do the hunters began to drive them in by the thousands [Music] hallelujah and now we live in such an hour that in many nations the jews have such a very comfortable life and it takes a stirring sometime takes a stirring sometime i don't like war and i don't like what it's doing and my heart is wept and my wife and i have cried looking at the pictures of those old people who ought to be treated well and fed well and given safety and there they're climbing across those boards to try to get across a river to get out of ukraine and to get into poland and it breaks your heart uh to hear of their deaths and children and all of this stuff and you've got these crazy people on social media who think they know so much they think they know what it's all about and they have no clue what it's all about but god does god knows what it's about and when i saw them this week getting off an ll a plane which is an experience in itself and walking across that floor and getting down old people and young ones alike getting down and kissing the dirty floor and thanking god for making a way for them to come home my heart cannot help but thrill and i have to say god you are faithful to your word you said i will give them a land and i will gather them in from the four corners of the earth don't lose the big picture church god is fulfilling his word hallelujah hallelujah so get you some some haman's ears and celebrate what god has done read the story of esther the megillah read it to your children and boo like the jews do when haman's name is mentioned and when mordechai and esther's name is called you cheer yay somebody said you want us to act like little children or something i don't mind i don't mind i'm closer to the second childhood than the first one probably but i don't mind it thrills me to know that god has been so faithful and then beginning on thursday of this week you will remember that it is the anniversary of the preaching of the seven seals you may not have an opportunity over that week to hear those sermons but choose one if you can't get them all in around the table get one choose one of the seals and and make a special effort to hear it in in the anniversary week and if you've got uh running low on things to praise god for praise him that his word is open praise him that he kept his word and opened up those seals bible becoming a new book so that you and i can know who we are it changed things it didn't only explain the symbols of the scripture it changed the symbols of the scripture somebody said what the world do you mean it caused things to mean something entirely different than what people thought it meant because they were interpreting it by by some natural skill but boy when that word even brother branham could have easily made a mistake he said i was about to make the biggest mistake of my life he was going to put jesus on the white horse like he had done he said i preached it all one time years before and i put jesus on the white horse but he said that wasn't that was the antichrist now where would you and i be you're still trying to figure out why we wouldn't even know i'm so thankful don't get quiet i'm so thankful i'm so thankful and then on friday brother richard botchway i don't know if he's watching but i saw that he was watching recently i think he's in ghana now and it's his birthday god bless you brother richard your family means a lot to us and then uh rj and emily's firstborn enoch mountain uh he's somewhere around here with his dad i guess his birthday is he two two years old terrific speak that prophesy that you will be terrific twos in jesus name and do that over your children and don't say terrible twos don't prophesy that the twos don't have to be bad say amen now are you ready to stand again let's thank god i don't think i'll sing now i did took all my time i feel good today i i think it's just me but i'll i'll do it i'll be that i'll feel good you feel good benjamin why you're supposed to say cause jesus is lord and he is amen whoa i don't know what i'm going to do with myself it's 12 30 some churches is already at the restaurant well you ain't at some church you're at your church you're at your church if there was somewhere else you needed to be or wanted to be for church this morning you should have been there but you're here god's been good to us i uh i was just looking here because sometimes it's nice to let you know that people are with us and unless they make a comment we have no way of knowing but uh brother elijah golden god bless you i believe from god and the gospels are here brother and sister hall from tucson brother benjamin uh nagiwa i'm not exactly sure god bless you reverend shelly i'm watching you from uganda east africa it's a soul-touching service full of god's love and brother elijah said we closed from church three hours ago where we enjoyed god's presence and behold another gathering of the saints at new hope revival ministries and uh sister gabriella sees on and and evangelist azeem and there are some here from pakistan i saw a little brother here from pakistan someone from denmark and just god bless you all

don't you come back and see us sometime and others and that's just on facebook i didn't even have a chance to see what was going on here on youtube or other places but thank you so much for being with us this way i want to preach this morning from luke chapter 19 and i need about three hours so i hope you'll just uh bear with me and help me i need help sister flow's not here and that means somebody's got somebody else has got to pull a little harder and um but i got to get something out i i really struggled this week to find the mind of god i don't like it like that i like it when it's easy and uh yes sister ruth we're praying for you in dubai god bless you brother merle god bless you and the and the um hallelujah veronique and brother george and others they're in the netherlands and vancouver god bless you folks there brother brother wasim from pakistan god bless you may god prosper everything you put your hands to do there and god bless you from brazil hallelujah oh my i can't help myself sometime i go back and look at this and i weep i do it touches my heart that somebody takes some of their time to help us worship the lord here and to be a part of what god is doing i struggled to know his mind i've had so much fun preaching about joy and i need to move on to something else i had some things in my heart and thought i would get to them but it was not until i began to set my i've studied i studied all day friday i studied mostly all day yesterday but it was real i went to bed last night still not knowing exactly where to go i knew something that i would bring but i didn't know exactly where to start i was troubled in the night about it i lord give me peace show me exactly what to do my family was offering suggestions aren't they wonderful i should tell you that uh i said i well i got about a one hour sermon and a three hour sermon i should tell you mariah suggested the one hour sermon that don't surprise you does it but anyway uh one of the many many many many times i woke up singing a song and through the night it seemed like it was just running over and over and over and i've got to get it because it's not a song i've ever sung before i've seen too many victories it's just been played a lot on the on the satellite radio i've seen too many victories to let defeat have the last word crazy i just kept hearing that song lyric over and over and over again i've seen too many victories to let defeat have the last word seen too many victories to let defeat have a lie i said that's good that'll preach that'll preach right there but that's not what i'm going to preach about then i went back and slept a while got up and went out and come back and i went to start the doors off again and i heard a voice say send judah first i said yes lord send judah first that's what i want to do is make sure my praise goes ahead of me into every battle come on now and so i'm going to preach right now on this morning i'm going to begin on the preeminence of praise send judah first i want to read in luke chapter 19 beginning in verse 28 and read all the way to 40. that's a lot of verses but i want to get them out and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem and it came to pass when he was come nigh to beth fage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering you shall find the cult tithe whereon you never yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do you loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him i like that and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them no surprise there is there and as they were loosing the coat the owners thereof said unto them why lucy the colt i guess they had a right to ask didn't they since it belonged to them and they said the lord hath need of him and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus there on and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice anybody with me for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king baruch haba basha baruch baruch uh oh my baruch atta adonai it slipped my mind blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord in the name of the lord beshem adonai peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples i want to have a little fun with this are you with me somebody from the cold formal church the first church of the message yes that's what we used to say first baptist church i just heard brother branham say this yesterday he said it used to be that we said as cold and formal as the baptist church but he said now we have to say as cold and formal as the pentecostal church and you know what we have to say now as cold and formal as some message churches and they begin to rebuke mat correct the master telling him why don't you tell your disciples to hold their peace master rebuke thy disciples and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace i can tell them if that's really what you want i can tell them to be quiet but i need to let you know that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out i want somebody to say ain't no stone going to cry out in my place no rock is going to thank him for me i'm going to live my voice as long as i have a voice and glorify the god of all eternity hallelujah he's worthy of that father we thank you that you are good you are god sovereign and supreme you have brought us here this morning because you want to help us on the journey and i need you today lord now i've taken so much time already i need you to come lord and help me to drive home a focus so that when we leave this place we have a little something to use against the enemy when he harasses us this week and he howls and accuses we're going to need a little something to use against him so i pray lord that you will provide that in your word today that somebody will take it up and carry it out of here and see the enemy defeated in their life we ask this help in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated no rock no stone no tree the bible said the trees of the fields cup their hands the bible tells us that the sun and the moon and the stars are giving god continual praise when you're asleep and you're tired and you're dreaming of being on a beach somewhere or in the mountains in a chalet somewhere and you're you're just enjoying yourself without even a thought of praise outside whether you can see them because of the clouds or not the stars are twinkling their praise and sending it to their creator the sun is giving its creator glory are you with me and the moon is reflecting the light of god's creation the sun so designed by god i know it's loud out there plenty but i need a little more in this monitor if you will please so designed by god to carry no light of its own but to be a mirror to be a reflection there you are little bride there you are god didn't place a light in you at your birth but he filled you with a light and you are a reflection of that light that little bride is glistening out across the night sky reflecting i tell you when it when the moon starts getting full i don't need a nightlight i don't need any help getting to the washroom in the middle of the night because i've got a little uh folding a little folding shutter on the bathroom window and a little drape at the top there's a little bit of a gap about there across the top of the of the bathroom window and when that moon gets bright and the weather permits it to shine i don't need a light i can see well to get out of the bed and to go into the washroom i don't have to have on any artificial light or use any electricity because the moon is out there doing its job amen you may not know it but these created things have voices they have sounds they have vibrations you know science has recorded the the sound of space you can hear it you can google it and you can hear the sound of outer space my my my my it sounds like just pleasant noise maybe like white noise to us but to the creator [Music] it's praise it's worship it's adoration somebody said well the moon don't have a choice he doesn't she doesn't it doesn't the stars don't have a choice they don't but i want you to know god receives their praise they were created to give their light they were placed there as a testimony of the greatness and the goodness of our god but you have a choice and even if every star in the galaxy is praising him and if the mountains are singing his grandeur hallelujah if the trees are clapping their hands and the hills are giving god lord and awe and praise he would rather hear from those who have a choice are you with me he would rather hear your voice giving him praise are you with me oh nobody can praise him like i can you can't take my place nobody can praise him like you can i can't take your place your voice must be heard it's your heart turned and positioned toward god that he's after oh oh the clamor of a service all the praise of a service and the glory of a service is not enough he wants to hear your voice the songwriter wrote a song and said god wants to hear you sing i know what some of you are thinking you're thinking he don't want to hear me sing i'm not a very good singer let me tell you something you you may be right i'm not going to argue with you i'm not going to tell you everybody can sing cause they can't it'd be nice if everybody could i hate to say i'm so sorry brother billy i hate to you see people get quiet brother billy was preaching brother billy was preaching one time he told this years ago he thought well if i'm going to preach i'm going to need to be able to sing so he signed terrible terrible i'm terrible to me to laugh he's i felt sorry for him that night i'm just laughing at him today he said it got him some voice lessons and after a few they just told him you need to save your money oh i'm sorry i'm trying to help you out here he said it was halfway through the first lesson now if you know that's an honest person because most people would have just said i'm going to try to work with you and took his money but somebody just finally told him you you just threw you're done everybody admitted but you know what brother billy god wants to hear your song he does [Music] he doesn't judge it by the bar of music he doesn't judge it by by it's it's melody or whether every note is pitch perfect that little tuner who come in here he tuned the piano and then he played the piano even my untrained ear could tell it sounded a lot better this week than it was sounding before he got here and he didn't want to offend him he said it's pretty awful but we knew that especially like mirabeth said down toward those higher notes and uh everything can kind of get out of tune like that and you notice it but kovid was here and kept some of them in fact the man we scheduled to come uh who is a blind gentleman who does an amazing job was not was unable to come and our this other fellow had to be rescheduled they neither one live here they have to drive from either montgomery or eufaula to come and tune the piano but i don't i knew it sounded off a time or two but it didn't really bother me like some you know it's bad when a streamer writes a streamer thank you streamers and says i will be more than happy to pay to tune the vienna i didn't get my little feelings hurt i said thank god this will be the motivation we need to get it tuned and you'll be proud of me i've scheduled to have it tuned every six months now and i said you know what we're we're pentecostal and we can be a little heavy-handed and he said well it doesn't really matter he said but it's just better to keep it in good working order i couldn't tell but somebody could tell but i want you to know that it was like that week after week after week month after month aldrin covet didn't keep sister laurel from playing it didn't keep sister marabeth from playing it didn't keep cinderella when she was here from playing it didn't keep me from singing along didn't keep you from praising the lord singing to an out-of-tune piano god didn't come and say hey no more of that attitude stuff he just blessed us didn't he blast us and blessed us and blessed us so that shows you it's not the tone it's not the pitch perfect it's the sincerity of your heart whoa boy i want to preach and i don't feel able i want to preach i want to get it to you i want to show you where you should preach a lot about prayer i know i know i do i preach a lot about praise i'm trying to make up for all those that won't preach about it because i have a lot of friends that won't preach about it because they're afraid it'll cause a little wildfire in their churches i've had them tell me i've had them tell me brother shelly i'd love for you to come and do a series in our church on praise but i can't do it i got some big names i could toss out here they said i can't let you do it because said then i'm afraid the people would get a little wildfire you ought to hear what brother branham said about wildfire i tell you what i'll tell you like my old pentecostal granny she said well they holler wildfire wildfire till they put out the fire she said i just want some fire and she said i'll tell you right now if this ain't the real fire it'll do to the real fire gets here [Applause] you say i can't amend that then hold your peace hold your peace if you can't amend that but i can amend that if preaching on praise it's going to cause somebody to get a little wild no wonder the disciples the people standing there told the disciples tell them to hold their peace jesus said i could if you wanted me to but if i told them the bible said they praised him in a loud voice too said it they just started crying out blessed is he who comes hoshanah hoshanah blessed is he who comes hosanna hoshanah got loud and they said just you need to tell them didn't they hear two times church order if you didn't get it in 51 you got it the next time you've got church order twice anything you get twice or you ought to listen to and i have and when i listen to it i don't hear anything in there telling me that i ought not to give god all the praise that i can i'm going to tell you something for me praise and worship is the most important weapon [Applause] come and say what about the word what about the word what about the word you can't even praise god the way he wants to be praised outside of that word because he's not listening at your voice whether you can sing or not he's reading your heart he's looking to see if the word of the hour is there that's right that's right coach brother branham said this week when i was listening he said i'll tell you right now he said i used to say pentecostals used to say speaking in tongues it's the initial evidence of the holy ghost he said then one day i said love he said perfect love and then he said one day i was talking to level and level had an idea and he said and he said i think it's a good one he said the evidence of the holy ghost is being able to receive the full word for the hour i don't have a problem with that all i know is somebody needs to get so full of the holy ghost that you quit dipping in unbelief [Applause] [Music] you need to be so filled with the holy ghost that you're looking for more room in your skirt not [Music] less more him more length instead of less a little more covering your arm than not you see when we get filled with the holy ghost it keeps us right on the word and when we start pulling away a little bit it's the holy ghost that pulls us back to the word that's what he said i've heard him seemed like everything i was listening to i heard a whole sermon friday night and a whole heard a whole sermon yesterday and i'll tell you it seemed like everything and i wasn't picking them by the title cheater you can kind of get what you want sometime doing that i just said i'm going to take the last sermon that he preached on this day and i listened to the last one he preached on friday it's in the app you can find it and i listen to the last one that he preached yesterday on that date all those years ago i think yesterday it might have gone all the way back to 61. i can't remember and in both of those sermons years apart brother brandon was saying a lot of beautiful things but i found an amazing see it was the same day day one day after another but years apart and i found so many wonderful similarities in what he was saying in both of those sermons he was calling for people to have an experience with god and when you have an experience with god you can't sit on your hands when you come to church nobody in my house but me brother branham couldn't hear me nobody could tell that i was getting into the spirit of it like he told us to do but right by myself i couldn't help but say a man brother that is nothing but the word thank you for telling it like it is i cannot be like some dead zombie when the word goes forth there's an a man on the inside of me that has to come out praise the word should take the most preeminence among us always but praise having a praise to to put praise first is a good idea not too long ago the lord was dealing with me about prayer and he said you'll get on track and on target a whole lot quicker if you'll praise me before you pray now see the pentecostals taught us the other way they said you pray and get everything out and then you praise well the holy spirit taught me to do it differently he said you'll get a whole lot good luck on track a whole lot quicker praying the mind of the spirit instead of your own selfish desire if you start coming in with praise and instead of praying first praise first get your heart moldable and pliable before god because we don't want any rocks crying out are you with me judah was just one of the tribes it was not the firstborn among the tribes but it was the tribe that over and over and over again god said you're first you're first you're first he didn't love judah any more than he loved the rest of the tribes he had a reason prophetically for sending judah ahead of all the rest because judah's name mean praise come on now and when the holy ghost was directing even we're not talking about the baptism of the holy ghost now in the old testament we're talking about the leadership and direction of the spirit of god which we can also call the eternal spirit of the father but he wants the holy spirit and he was directing things and moving in ways in the old testament that we find very very profound when we look back and there was an order like i mentioned this morning about a pro a prophetic protocol of coming before the king you don't just stomp your way in i know some of you are sleepy i know you're sleepy please don't be don't miss this because you may have something come up this week that you need to send praise first instead of panic praise first panic later say it with me praise first panic later you may find out that you don't have to panic you may be caught up in faith you may be caught up in blessed assurance you may get so anointed in your praise that what was disturbing you a minute ago is no longer disturbing you you may find that your mind doesn't keep dragging you back to how bad it is we just got to get some of this extra stuff out of moss place there won't be room to move their stuff in well i just don't have a room in my pocket for it i told my wife i i just don't have room in my pocket for that stuff we got to figure something out i said i call them and find out how much it'll be to rent a mobile attic i'll put that out there for a few months and start going through the rest of it and selling what we can and getting keeping what i want i've had to say a time or two get in your place now woman with a smile on my face she's been pretty good about it i gotta have a little room and that we called it was a good price now i know why it was so cheap to get it so we get it it comes out there and the man don't take time to see where the power line is he just runs right through it all he had to do was lower his hydraulics just a little bit he could go right under it if you'd have met him you kind of understood he's a little scattered so he not only rips the power line down he splits the pole i'm so glad that sister beth is having such a good time mm-hmm she wasn't laughing like that when the washers and dryers and vehicles and all that was going or was she when she was having a hard time when brother steve called me on the phone i'm kidding bust burst the pole splintered it and laid it out there and then wanted us to say that we couldn't he said well all of us was all of us thought it would work well benjamin wasn't him up there yet and stacy was on the porch and i was in the house there wasn't all of us involved anyway it took a solid week because they come out and they said you can't fix it like it was they forgot about grandfather cause that has saved us many times in many places including where you stand now on this property they forgot about all that and everything had to be redone not just new poll everything had to be redone and it feels so heavy so it went from about a 300 project to almost a 3 000 project in in a few days and days are ticking off no power pressure's on because jen and her mom were coming last night and we needed a place for them to be able to stay of course and that wasn't the biggest problem the biggest problem was getting it fixed right and getting the inspect i tell you what i'm going to pray that man gets saved filled with the holy ghost and baptized in the name of jesus and all the rest of them too and if you're listening i'm talking to you you need jesus [Applause] he was just being picky but i just kept saying to him we got to we cannot let this we cannot we cannot we can't get off track there's reason to panic there's reason to fret there's reason to be upset but we've got to choose to say it's all for a reason i finally said to him i want this safe i said to my family i want this safe i don't want it unsafe i don't think it was unsafe but i want it safe i said our future grandbabies may live here [Music] and i said and furthermore benjamin and jenna can run but those grandbabies may not be able to run from the fire i want it done right it's all for a reason god knows what he's doing he provided he made a way you ought to see how god made a way it didn't even have to go on a credit card because god miraculously provided and made a way [Applause] something that i should have gotten last month came this month and it wasn't my tax refund it should have been here last month but if it would have been it would have been spent but it not only come this month it came days before the check had to be written so i just kept saying we got to praise him we've got to praise him we cannot let this get us off track we've got to praise him my little wife running through the house saying god is moving among us we are about to see a mighty move of god no wonder the devil is mad and i'm not going to let him win come on [Applause] we don't just preach this we practice this it's the only way to survive in this hour sin first hallelujah i don't know if they're going to pay for any of it or not but i'm sending judah first i'm going to praise first and fret later if i have to i got a feeling i'm telling you folks if you let praise go ahead of you when you go to battle my see it's like this and i can't preach when i want to preach i just can't get it out judah means praise the sons of israel broke camp and every time they broke camp the tribe of judah led the way when israel went to war judah was the first to battle what kind of military strategy is that the best one they didn't send the swords they didn't send the catapults [Music] they didn't send the slingshots or the shotguns i'm taking a little liberty here or the atom bombs you know anything about the stories of hanukkah brother has told us the story of hanukkah and even in that in that period between the testaments the greeks used elephants for warfare so don't think that it was so primitive they didn't know how to kill one another even in the time of israel against the philistines they had ways of killing one another some of it was hand-to-hand combat and some of it was was these catapults that they used to to to sling these boulders to tear down the walls and to take out the camps and they would set fire while you've even heard about some foxes who are caught in their tails tied together in a torch lit on fire sit out into the barley fields of the philistines any kind of weapon anything can become a weapon when you're involved in active warfare but when it come time for god to set the order for the camp to move he didn't choose those who were the most skilled in brutal hand-to-hand combat he said no sin judah first let judah go before the bows and arrows help me let judah go before the bullets and the bombs and and all you let judah lead the way it was a good strategy then it's a better strategy now it prepares the atmosphere it impregnates the atmosphere with the promises of god when we come praising him it releases the atmosphere of heaven which is glory in our midst it prepares our hearts to receive the word when we gather corporately and send judah first when we individually get caught in a bad situation during the week and we individually or as a family decide hey we're not going to send emotions first we're not going to meet the enemy with emotions first or opinions first or prejudices first we're going to meet the enemy with praises first we're going to baffle the devils the demons aren't going to know what's going on because instead of getting in a tither and panicking and killing ourselves by falling into our own entrapments we're going to target our praise and our praise isn't headed toward the enemy our praise is heading toward our deliverer and we're going to let him know that if anything is accomplished in this battle it will be because of him you are great you are faithful you are mighty you are worthy you're the god of the whirlwind you're the god of battles mighty god everlasting father prince of peace lily of the valley bride and morning star that's who you are that's who you are oh numbers 2 9 just flash that if you can all that were numbered in the camp of judah were 100 000 and four score thousand and six thousand and four hundred throughout their armies these shall first set forth somebody say send judah first in the book of judges we see two instances where the lord said that the tribe of judah is to go first against their enemies in battle the first occurrence is found in judges chapter 1 following the death of joshua when the children of israel inquired of the lord he said now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them that's judges 1 1 and this is 1 2 and the lord said read it for me would you judah behold i have delivered the land into your hands all of israel's hands judah you get judah you get judah leading the way you get the children of judah going first they were not those who were skilled in hand-to-hand combat do you know what they were skilled in they played trumpets help me they played shofars they clapped their hands and sang praises to the god of heaven come on they were singers and i don't mean to disturb your peace but they were twirlers when they went to praising him the word that's used for dance is a hebrew word that means to twirl where are you i'll be with you shortly i wasn't made for that stop world i want to get off that is what they did they did twirly gigs can you imagine an enemy waiting up on the hills for israel to approach and here come trumpet players shofar blowers symbol claspers and these folks it's a hebrew word it means to twirl hallelujah you see these little girls that love to be ballerinas they may be picking up on something more ancient than we realize because there was an hour in the bible when battles were won with a twirling army think about it what were we reading did we finish uh um did we get it out i'm loaded i can't get it out fast enough the second is found in judges uh uh 20 and i won't read that but in verse 18 it says judah shall go up first so two times judges one and judges 20 when there was an inquiry made of the lord who will lead the way god already told them who was to break up camp and go first but they wanted to make sure that it meant to battle so two times they pray what should we do for have you ever been there i don't i know i got to do a lot of things sister anita let me let me talk to sister anita she came in here last sunday overwhelmed really really overwhelmed she had a list of things that had to be taken care of legally and practically for their lives no time to do it constant full-time caretaker for her husband no time to read anything understand anything fill out anything hardly enough time to pay the bill and make sure the house doesn't fall apart she was overwhelmed she has become a trained nurse she has learned things she never thought she would have to know and sometimes she has been able to to advise professionals of what to do her whole life for these years has been dedicated to the love of her life her beloved and she has weathered the storm quite well but this past weekend her testimony is she just hit the wall and friday night and saturday night it was just a culmination of everything and she nearly had a breakdown and as i was preaching here i feel god anyway as i was preaching here she texted and said ken we were coming toward the end of the service and we were going to pray and she said can i come over and crystalline had stayed home with her dad and was helping take care of him and i i looked over 10 12 minutes later i think it's about 12 minutes later i found the text and and i thought i said oh no i didn't tell her she could come over and we're getting ready to start closing and i looked up and my wife was standing there and sister anita had found my wife and they were standing there hugging and she came and got prayer and got some direction for her life and when i spoke to her late friday night i think it was late friday night i was sitting at the dining room table listening to brother branham and i i finally was able to touch base with her it's probably ten o'clock she the first thing out of her mouth was brother shelley you'll never know thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you and thank everybody for praying for me i have been able to accomplish so many things she began to list the things that she had taken care of in one week's time that had been chasing her like extending their tax deadline and all these legal things that you and i just do when they have to be done but they piled up on her you know that dirty low down sorry devil from hell if he can't break you down one way he'll try another way but she just knew she had to get under the atmosphere and the presence of the lord and we prayed for her after the service we sat there on the front row and talked for quite a while and she said you just wouldn't believe the things that i was able to get taken care of when that old fog and whatever else that the enemy had put on me was lifted i was able to focus so much better and get things done i want to give god praise for that i want to tell you that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about she could have sat at home and said well crystalline's here i need this time to fill out these papers so i'll go to the table and i'll begin to do all this she could have used her time that way but she chose to use her time like i'm preaching this morning send judah first you ought to be a little louder than that send judah first we ought not to have to beg anybody to praise the lord we ought not to have to beg anybody to sing for jesus we ought not to have to beg anybody to do anything in the kingdom of god no no no no no no you ought to send judah first you may not need him now but you'll need him one day you better send judah first she decided to put god first and give him that time and let him minister to her and she had a better ability so panic or praise which will it be which will it be will you panic or praise will you let your emotions get out of hand or will you praise the lord the preeminence of praise i'm talking this morning about sin judah first i won't finish this morning you know that i got to stop now pretty soon but i know that this is a subject that you and i can utilize in our life brother brother reed had a had a god moment last week and he got something hung up in a situation and and it was just going to be overwhelming all the things that had to be done to correct it he he's a plumber by trade and he knows what to do and what needs to be done but this was a bad situation and god moved for him he just moved i don't even know if you stopped to pray he moved he turned his heart towards the only one well i'm not going to bother god with oh let me tell you something anytime you call his name you're not bothering him he wants to hear from you he wants to hear your voice billy tebow whether you can sing or not he wants to hear you call his name when you get well i i don't i don't talk to him enough when things are going good so i better not talk to him when they fix it quit feeling sorry for yourself and fix it talk to him all the time you never have an excuse to say there's nobody i can talk to you can go to him well it's just not the same your mighty right it's not the same because he listens and he does something about it he possesses the power to do something about it i want to remind you again of the authority of a son when i first came around the message they were all the time they were so afraid back in the 90s they were so afraid so many of my friends were so afraid of pentecost so afraid that it was going to break out as an experience among us and drag us back into some kind of wildness or something i don't know what the fear was but we heard it every time we went to church the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word i tell you if you're not careful you sit under that for so long you'll find a little resentment building because you can fill up with the word but until you learn to do something with the word that you have heard i'm telling you there's people dying on the vine around this message dying on the vine not because they haven't heard the word but because they don't recognize the authority that god is placing in their mouth and in their hands to use this word to accomplish the will of god in the earth so you just say i need the word we need the word we need the word we do we we did the word but what are we going to do with it when we get it so every time i would go among them they would preach power i'm not being ugly i'm being a little mocking because it nearly destroyed my life and i hadn't forgot it power power lady power they say why brother branham said we don't have power why do you want power in pentecost we had power we thought we had so much power in pentecost so i heard that until it was running out my ears so i just started searching the same message well remember back then there wasn't it wasn't as easy to search as it is now the very moment the message was searchable i was in the first 12 people in this world that owned a computer with the software i was in in the in the in the group of the first 12 that were able to search this message god helped me to do it i didn't have the money to buy a computer and the computer that i had to buy to search it was this big it was called a laptop but i had to have it and i went and i walked i walked these years with them through every transition when brother neil holliva came out with with a more more uh i'll get it in a minute uh a faster database by using folio views i was one of the first to buy it he told me my computer wouldn't run it i said okay sell me a computer then and i bought a computer from him that would run his robust software to be able to search it i remember when they came out with the e-book anybody ever have an e-book i bought one of the first it was sold and i found out that i couldn't that little e-book you could search a whole message on a little ebook my goodness it the screen didn't even light up it was horrible to have to try to read it but we were so glad to have it i carried that thing in my luggage everywhere i went to preach and i found out that a printer was available so i bought me a printer that was about that big chad just talked to chad he's toted it all he's drug it all over the world he can tell you i finally bought me a little printer like this that printed the message on uh thermal paper like you use for a receipt so i would be standing up there preaching the message with a roll of paper because i found so much that he said that i had never heard anybody else preach and it sets me free i'm not trying to brag i'm telling you it was a hard road to hoe and some of you hold it with me we found that for everything they would say to try to reduce the need for a personal pentecost they would quote it like it was the authority for everything they could pull out we found out we could pull out 30 that said back to pentecost back to an experience come on i'm just being honest here you've got to have your per brother branham even said i never heard nobody say it until i found it because we couldn't you couldn't say you could listen to the tapes and couldn't remember what you heard we're so blessed today i can do it on my phone i don't have to take preacher's words for it you don't have to take my word for it it's available the absolute and right interpretation of the scripture is available for all of us to find it for ourselves but we cannot take out an isolated quotation here and shut the move of god down in our lives you've got to balance every one of them together to see what the mind of god is saying and when i balance it together and i see what the mind of god's saying i want to stand here today and say send judah first go praise him praise him with everything you've got praise him out there and when you come in here praise him too i believe we have to take it all i don't believe we can cherry cherry-pick i believe what we have found out with all of the resources available to us is that what they were trying to say is that there's something greater for us than power but i just couldn't get him around to saying it where i was sitting all i could hear them say was power power power only the pentecostals won't power our power and i'm thinking well what do we what what do we got then and here come brother ban i'm saying it don't take power the balance the balance don't say power it takes authority anybody with me whoa i'll never forget i had never heard a preacher never heard another preacher say this never ever ever in any big message convention anywhere i was ever preaching had i ever heard anybody quote this until i was listening for myself what's the lesson here hear it for yourself and hear it with the right spirit and don't hear it to try to fight somebody else with it hear it to get delivered just let the word do the work come on one day i'm listening and i'm desperate i'm so desperate i have been censured i have been told all kinds of things you'll calm down we thought you'd calm down in 12 months now it's been four years you're still on the road you ain't calmed down yet we still hear you speaking in tongues around the altar but we know one day all that'll get settled great men that i love to this day pet me on the head and say i was just like you just like you when i started out but i got all settled in the word and you will too and i'm thinking i don't i don't even know what that means but if it means act like that um you see i was there when it happened i was there when heaven opened up and he baptized me with the holy ghost and fire i didn't know it was illegal then i didn't know that i didn't know that you had to be baptized in jesus name i didn't know you had to do this or that or the other all i knew was i wanted the holy ghost more than anything else in all the world one day i'm sitting down listening to a tape tape cassette for you kids aaron come to my office sometime i'll show you a cassette oh thanks be to god i was listening to a cassette one day my heart was so broken i had been so censored so criticized i had been sitting in a week of meetings where i was the subject every night and i'm thinking your poor people lord here they need to be helped and fed but they're using all their time to preach against me and i wasn't mad i was broken i was so broken i said god i don't know why in the world you'd drag me into this anyway but i cannot survive like this and i heard a sermon i was listening to a sermon in the motel room and brother branham came out on that sermon and this is what he said i'm paraphrasing he talked about the difference between power and authority he talked about that little police officer i'd never heard it preach never heard it quoted never heard anybody mention it but i was hearing it right out of his lips and i immediately had a vision it wasn't a spiritual vision it was a carnal vision i saw barney fife my battery died what time is it 1 27. i saw barney five i saw his brother branham preached that that little weak officer of the law he was describing him had no power against the oncoming traffic hear me stay with me he couldn't have stopped that truck if he wanted to he had no power he had no power he had no power guess what he didn't need any power of his own he had something greater than power that's what they were trying to say but they never said it i never heard him finish it they just kept saying powerful i got my parallel hold up a pentagon's a power to brother power but when i heard him say it i knew where they got it i just didn't know why they didn't finish it it must have not they didn't have visions of barney fife like i did it didn't speak to them like it spoke to me i saw that man standing there but he didn't have to have power to stop that vehicle he had a badge big old shiny badge and of course i'm adding to the quote there had a bullet in his pocket brother graham didn't say that that's what i'm saying bull in the pocket he couldn't have got it in the gun fast enough to stop the driver if he wanted to but oh standing there the sun the son glistened on that badge he had authority [Music] all he had to do was raise up his hand it's all you have to do little bride it's not your power that you've got to find god has all the power he has all the power and he said behold let's balance the quote he said behold i give you power over all the powers of the enemy why could he release that to his disciples because he was teaching them the grace of authority he knew he knew he knew and boy he knew him really well because some of them had some issues still they were still working through some stuff and they could have used that power pretty wildly you see you could pick up a sword and cut somebody's ear off but because jesus wasn't just there representing power he was also representing authority he reached down and picked up that ear and power didn't do that the creator's authority did that he just reached down and put that ear and slapped it right back on the head and it grew just like it always had attached just like authority did the work so what i found out is the more i searched and the more i heard the more i understood that there has to be a balance and that pentecost is not a swear word because we're not preaching pentecost as a denomination we're talking about pentecost as an experience and if you don't have a holy ghost experience you need one because if i understand what he said you can't make the rapture now it's quiet because we're putting all our denominational friends in the rapture we do don't look like you don't i hear the way you talk about everybody that that goes to church all it takes to be saved is to call on the name of the lord you don't have to believe this message to be saved if you hear them preaching that you know they're off the word because the bible tells us how to be saved you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth you're saved brother braham said get back to the abc's except believe confess didn't he say it but we're not talking about being saved we're talking about being rapture material and if i understand what he said he said it takes a new birth to make the rapture and he said the new birth is not complete until you receive the baptism of the holy ghost he didn't say you have to talk in tongues he said you've got to be able to believe the word for your day you don't understand the value i pray you do but many don't understand the value of what god's given us and i don't mean no harm and i know there's a visit there too and i know there are people streaming everywhere and i don't mean to sound like i'm against anybody i'm not against anybody i'm for everybody but i can't forget what i've had to learn the hard way along the way and i cannot stand back in this hour and let this little church die on the vine i can't let us cool down until we look like status quo i'm telling you the holy spirit spoke into my heart as i lay there on the bed send judah first and we're going to send judah first we're going to praise when we can we're going to praise as often as we can and as long as we can and we're going to open up the atmosphere with our praise then we're going to let the word work we're not looking for more power we're looking for how to use the power we've been given and it comes by authority who's got more authority tiffany an archangel or a sinner saved by grace my belly was shaking i laughed so deep just then i felt like i felt my old body shaking like some old granddaddy it thrills me when i hear that i've seen angels it doesn't make me anything but i believe in them brother branham said you want to see them believe in them i heard him say this week asked he said ask to see them he said it ask to see them don't give up and quit if you don't but it wouldn't hurt i've seen them standing on this i've seen him walking i've looked out my window that i was just describing to you alfreda was in my home one time many years ago and i looked out that very same window and i saw huge strong mighty angels walking through the yard i knew that god had sent them i knew that they were investigating angels i knew they had come on us on a commit i didn't worship them i didn't try to paint a picture of them i didn't buy me a statue of them i just honored god i just thanked him i just thanked him that he would let me see they're there whether you see him or not but i just thanked him that he let me see them i'm not going to deny that i did i'm not trying to boast that i did but i'm not going to deny that i did they're real they're powerful they make fun of oral roberts because they said he saw an angel you know whatever it was 12 or 13 i don't care i'm not going to criticize that maybe he did i'm not going to come against that it's none of my business don't you be everybody's judge it's not our business but here's what you need to know about angels they're servants they don't get to go when they want to go they go when they're sent even old jacob he got an understanding of that as he had wrestled all night i'm coming to an end he'd wrestled all night with an angel god just a moment angel said i gotta go we got to finish this up here but i got to go the day's breaking you know the change of life that came you know what god did and you know that he gave him a limp that he never forgot and he always remembered wrestling with god or an angel of god at that place but it's very early in the morning like that that angels stand before the throne and receive their commissions and they get their assignments to go and do i know the pentecostal and charismatic world has encouraged people to command angels but i don't encourage people to do that even though we understand that we have more authority we understand that man was created lower in the order of of creation than the angels doesn't mean authority it means they were created in a higher order than a man and from the angel in the lower place he created man is that right am i telling what the scripture said i didn't miss that did i got it right they're powerful they're created beings they feel they feel the atmosphere you feel them sometimes you sense them sometimes you see them sometimes you don't know what you're feeling but you know the presence of god is here because those angels have stood before the throne they've stood in the presence of god and they come bearing his face to us they come bearing his presence to us and they change the atmosphere i just want to remind you of a time that brother brother billy paul was not sensitive he was meeting in the little trailer with his dad over some prayer requests and some mail that had come in and paul was running back and forth across there and his daddy told him not to do it and he did it again and his daddy swatted him like we all do i pray because there's a time to do it you just evidently got to know the time he swatted him on the seat of the pants as he went through there again and disobeyed his dad brother branham reached over and picked up his hat off the chair and put it on his head and left left he said dad we're not finished here he said no paul i'm doing oh billy i'm done he said everybody's got an angel the story came everybody's got an angel and when you swatted that swatted him that way you offended that boy's angel and i have to go i'm telling you folks that's powerful if you'll get get your mind as far around that as you possibly can it'll help you understand that every one of god's children have angels assigned to them we've got to remember that there's a time and a place for all things there's a time and a place for all things there's a protocol and an order for things i see people behaving in this sanctuary sometimes in ways that nobody ought to behave in a place that has been dedicated to the house of god and i'm not talking about running the aisle and i'm not talking about jumping and i'm not talking about praising the lord i'm talking about dragging in and out as you do i see people sometime leaving the service and greeting people all the way down the aisle there's a time to greet people it's going to be deathly quiet there's a time to kiss babies and hug folks there's a time to do that but there's a time not to do that and what you do in here you should be very very careful with because you may have run in at the last minute without any preparation to be here but i want you to know there are people sitting in this room today that prepared their hearts way before their bodies got here there are people that prayed for this service they're people that got up extra early to dedicate their heart and turn their heart toward the service that god would move and minister and you and i have an obligation to respect and honor that which is sacred and as i said a moment ago brother branham talked about angels he said fools walk with hobnailed shoes where angels fear to trod don't you be one of those fools longer we know one another and the longer we worship in the building the more familiar we become with one another the more familiar we become with this building brother branham was not a fanatic he preached church order but he was not a fanatic about church order he allowed it to be broken many many times on tape and blessed it he put the gifts in a room and then blessed the lord when they operated in the sanctuary never criticized even though there was an order set for the local church when someone would give still a message in tongues and interpretation that witnessed with his heart he would honor god and thank god for it sometimes calling the name of the person used so we would know who was used of god so he wasn't a fanatic didn't you hear brother greene talk about the time that he was at the tabernacle with a broom sweeping up he said i just didn't want to leave he said and i was had the broom there and i was trying to be careful that i didn't strike the broom against the pew he said the service was over we were dismissed everybody was out but he said i was trying to be respectful to the sanctuary and so i didn't even want the broom to clank against the chair or the pew and he said all of a sudden brother branham opened up the door of the study there and hollered out brother perry you want to go to breakfast in the morning and brother green he said i i i almost grabbed my chest he said here i am trying not to break make the broom make a clicking sound again and brother branham calls out real loud and i said that would be good he said what can't hear you he said i said that'll be fine now somebody said are you trying to tell me he didn't do what he said or practice what he preached i'm not saying that at all i'm telling you he knew that there's a balance in all things and when we forget that this is a sacred place then we're off balance i'm not going to call you down for worshiping the lord if you do it with sincerity of your heart and you do it not to draw attention to yourself but you do it to bring honor to the king i'm not going to call you down for praising the lord when it's time to praise the lord i'm not going to call you down or try to place you in some kind of restriction or bondage when you get so excited in the presence of god that you seemingly can't contain yourself and you jump or you dance or you holler or you raise your hands and praise god because i understand that you are in a battle you're in a battle i'm in a battle we're in a battle and it's not getting easier it seems to be getting harder and the strategy for dealing with these battles is to let praise go ahead of us not our emotions let praise go ahead of us i want the musicians to come i i'm not even on page two i have not preached i've just shared it's just a familiar battle we sometimes have to come back and realize people will sit here sometime and they'll say i'm just not going to raise my hand because somebody told me to raise my hand you you're just forgetting what it's all about we've had it here many many many times people act one way when the pastor's here in another way when the pastor's not here my band-aid is flapping around well don't you just took it off i thought you was bringing stitches you're going to sew it up or something we've had it here where if a certain worship leader was was leading people could really get in and if another one was they couldn't seem to enter in we've had evangelist after evangelists come through here and you shout them down and freeze me out on a sunday morning because i made a decision you didn't like and watch it get quiet i'm too far into this now to care i'd have cared about 20 minutes ago now i don't care come on now when we do like that you know what we're showing we're showing we're not in order we've missed what it's about you're not here for me you're not even worshiping because i'm telling you to worship you're here for him you came to meet him i found myself this morning sitting there i'm not the only one but i'm the only one that'll tell it i found myself sitting here this morning and i don't i don't i don't criticize benjamin's worship leading because i think it's outstanding and it's anointed and he's had a lot of criticism he's been criticized because he smiles don't react well he just smiles up there like it's a show or something don't react joey see i'm talking to you yeah or he wiggled a little bit moved a little bit cried a little bit and people sometimes don't like that was that beth you can't hold yourself she can't contain herself but the truth is i have sat in worship services where a worship leader stood right here like this not not here we never had one like this much well maybe one or two but not much never worship just song lead because you know in the message that's what it's called song leading just lead a song just sing a song i i whispered to benjamin i'm sure you heard me too this morning i said don't forget son lead us yes lead us it's not just singing the songs it's encouraging us by showing us the way. that's what a leader does he shows the way he don't just tell you to do it you can say a lot of things about me you can say a lot of things about him but you cannot say that we tell you to do what we're not willing to do i have led you into praise and worship by my own example for for nearly 30 years plus because i have seen the importance of doing that so i was standing here this morning and those first two songs he sung are songs that i love but the thought came to my mind i wonder why he sung those back to back doesn't usually come this way son don't think it does but i was standing i wonder why he sung those songs back to back i don't know if i'd have done that or not i'm not sure i would have sung those songs back to back i wonder what he could have done instead of that very constructively my mind was trying to come up with a better plan why would you tell this because i ain't the only one and the next thing you know he's not on either one of them songs anymore but i have missed the first five minutes of my next opportunity because my mind was trying to think what he could have sung and i may have mentioned it i may have never mentioned it but i found myself thinking of what i could suggest that he sung that would have went along with that one and made way for the next one and then it don't know me i don't even know what the next one is cause i have checked out oh i'm preaching at me don't you let your carnal mind cheat you out of your opportunity there was a time i thought i would have never let some of these modern worship songs be sung where i was sitting and what i have come to understand is you don't have to like the style or the or or the or the age you don't even have to like all the words it ain't about that now tonight i'm going to the lord willing if i'm able i'm going to hear the callings we're saying over at the baptist church i probably shouldn't have told you i was going because some of you won't want to go the last time we were there i got really blessed we were listening to the hoppers and i think ben and ken maybe zach i don't remember how i was we had a whole row or two there and the baptist people sitting in front of us turned around and said you all are making this fun little life ain't going to hurt nobody i'm going to try to respect where i am i'm going to listen to the words i'm going to i i don't think i'm going to hear a style that i don't particularly care for i think i'm going to like that but i'm going to worship him i can't help it if they wanted to sell a ticket and have a concert they oughta done that but they put it in a church and when i get into church i cannot help myself i don't see myself running the aisle i don't see myself embarrassing you but i'm going to worship him come on now because i realize it's about him not what i like or don't like it's about him send judah first let me have my oh come on the rest of the way sing this with me wow i'm not preached oh god bless you god bless you sister hannah she says leaders lead and we must and that's so interesting brother merle her daddy from tucson said i'm thankful for your beautiful family thank you brother merle i appreciate that and and hannah the daughter mary daughter living in norway comments next and says leaders lead they're hundreds of miles thousands of miles apart and they're in our service together this morning isn't god good oh what wonderful things i won't take time to read them now but i just want to sing this little chorus before we go send judah first and the battle will be one less stance in judah first and the foe is overcome giving praise to the father and glory to the son sin judah first sing it with me sin to the verse and the battle will be won send you to first and the foe is overcome giving praise to the father and glory to the son sin and they're one [Music] send you the first and the battle will be send you the first as the foe is overcome giving praise to the father and glory to the son sin judah let's go up one send you the first and the battle will be won since you the first get your praise in there oh praise to the father and glory to the sun sent judah for no matter what the enemy is [Music] send to the verse i just wanted to get that old song in we used to sing that under the tent many years ago all right benjamin lead us in worship and i don't care what two songs you sing together watch your sandwich in the middle i'm going to worship him i'm going to give him praise hallelujah thank you all this has been an unusual service thank you so much for helping me get through it i'm so glad that you were here to amen and support and i i appreciate it now i hope you'll practice this this week send judah first [Music] i uh i try to worship no matter who's singing they sing specials i try to worship with them because i know it's not a concert somebody gets up here in front of folks and sings it ain't easy i i try to give my i i try to give your kids the same support and worship when they're singing as i do my own i try not to do things like that because we're one big family we're doing what we do for the kingdom of god i don't want you to let anything get in your mind in your heart that keeps you from worshiping the lord my granny always told me if you're going to sing for the lord sing with everything you've got put everything in so why don't you just encourage one another every chance you get to let judah go before you we'll finish this and we'll do something with it later we couldn't do today but sing [Music] i cast my mind to calvary hallelujah where jesus bled and died for me i see his wounds his hands his fear my savior all that cursed hallelujah his body bound [Music] the [Music] messiah still [Music] and all alone yes [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] of god our god oh we praise his name forever more in this space we will see your praise [Music] [Music]

[Music] sing like that again you have that name above all names and you are worthy [Music] how great is god just play i want to read this to you as you play keep playing it you weren't here some of you weren't here tuesday night there's hardly a a service that i don't make a quote but i usually read one i checked myself this week i took this quote home and studied it against all the other quotes i made a document i'll share with you if you like it was it was all the quotations i could find i'm still looking for some where brother branham said when that which is perfect has come and almost every time he says that he says his love almost every time almost every time it's a very very rare reference that he says something about the word almost every time he says it's perfect love when that which is perfect has come almost every time but i wanted to check myself out this is a quote that i think you ought to hold on to because the enemy would like to talk you out of your experience i shared this i went back and studied two church ages excuse me two church orders that he preached and this sermon was after both of them after both of them he said this after the seals were preached he said this after all the things he said about that which is perfect has come he said this so put this in the right balance it's the message thirst it's paragraph 236 you have nothing to apologize for if you have an experience with god you have nothing to apologize for this is what he believed this is what he told us was coming he said wait now i want you to see the date again 9 19 september the 19th 1965 three months he's gone church ages preach seals preached both church orders preached every quote he makes about that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with all preached and yet he comes in september of 65 and says this wait till that satisfaction comes [Music] the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the holy spirit comes in then these joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit will come anybody with me you won't have to do it by the music you will do it when you're going down the road in your car [Music] now that is not to say that you can't do it in god's house it's only saying when you get the real thing you don't have to have the drums to shout you don't have to have the piano to shout you can worship god talk in tongues and scream out hallelujah driving down the road when the real satisfaction let me read you'll do it when you're going down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you are that joy unspeakable and full of glory i like the balance sing something else sing a little more of that whatever you need to do we're not having service tonight don't usually so we might as well squeeze every moment out of this one we possibly can but if you're not going to worship then there'll be no need we just go but if you want to have a little more i do i need it i'll be honest i need a little more i need just a little more time in this prison let's take that let's take that right now what will we sing i love you lord [Music] fails me and all my days i've been held in your hands from the moment that i wake [Music] oh [Music] all my life you have been so you've been so good with every breath that i am able to see of the goodness [Music] i love your voice [Music] [Music] oh yes [Applause] [Music] with every breath that i am [Applause] [Music] cause all my life you [Music] [Music]
