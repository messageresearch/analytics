[0:10] it's about to be your time to
[0:13] shine it is it's about to be your time
[0:16] to shine gross Darkness covers the face
[0:18] of the Earth it's going to be about your
[0:21] time to shine and if you'll remember the
[0:24] message the lord gave me concerning the
[0:25] captive Daughter of Zion she lay there
[0:27] beaten and bloody she lay there raped
[0:30] and mangled by the systems of her day
[0:33] right in the word of God and she lay
[0:35] there with a with a a burden a yoke
[0:38] around her neck that had already been
[0:40] broken but she was still living under
[0:43] the mindset of bondage and slavery and
[0:46] so she was laying there weak but not so
[0:49] weak that she couldn't have got up she
[0:52] was laying there with a broken Spirit
[0:54] more than with a broken body and God
[0:57] didn't come by and say oh you sweet
[0:59] things here let me help you up and kiss
[1:01] your wounds he said arise oh Daughter of
[1:06] Zion and you know what she thought she
[1:08] thought exactly what you and I think
[1:10] when God requires something of us that
[1:12] we don't think we have enough strength
[1:13] to to endure but as she was laying there
[1:16] perhaps it would have crossed her mind
[1:18] uh how could God ask me to get up
[1:20] doesn't he see my wound doesn't he see
[1:22] my bleeding doesn't he see that I've
[1:24] been beaten doesn't he see this big old
[1:26] yoke on my shoulder yes he saw it all
[1:30] but he knew that sympathy or empathy was
[1:33] not going to get you up the only thing
[1:35] was to reconnect you listen to reconnect
[1:38] you with your calling to reconnect you
[1:40] with your Destiny to remind you who you
[1:43] are once she was reminded of who she was
[1:46] she found strength by the word of the
[1:48] Lord to get up out of that place and she
[1:51] found out that the Yoke that had been
[1:53] keeping her down was just a
[1:58] farce it might have been the one thing
[2:01] that bound her
[2:04] then but it was not binding her
[2:06] anymore the bars had already been
[2:09] removed everything had been broken the
[2:11] call of God was still on her life she
[2:13] didn't ruin her call because she ended
[2:15] up on the bad side of
[2:17] town she didn't ruin the calling of God
[2:20] on her life because she failed the Lord
[2:22] at some of the Junctions along the way
[2:24] she was still the queen of Zion she was
[2:27] still the Bride of Zion rise oh Daughter
[2:31] of Zion Shake
[2:33] thyself get the dust off of you and
[2:37] recognize who you are for your time has
[2:40] come to arise and shine and we are so
[2:43] close to our shining time it's only
[2:46] going to be in a moment when you make a
[2:49] determination that goes beyond your
[2:51] emotional level and it goes right down
[2:53] to the inside of the inside that you are
[2:56] not going to let anybody or anything
[2:58] stand in your way from your destiny and
[3:01] your calling and your commission
[3:03] somebody said do I have to know what my
[3:05] commission is to fight for it no you can
[3:08] fight all the way to
[3:10] it if that's what it takes
