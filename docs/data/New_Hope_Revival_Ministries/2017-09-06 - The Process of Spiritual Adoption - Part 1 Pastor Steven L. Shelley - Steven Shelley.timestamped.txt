[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to thank you for tuning in to
[0:58] the broadcast today we're looking
[1:00] forward to sharing with you the good
[1:02] news of the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:04] Christ I've been particularly blessed
[1:07] lately by your emails we get a few
[1:10] letters and even a few phone calls but
[1:12] mostly correspondence through email and
[1:16] you have been sharing with us how that
[1:20] this program has been a blessing in your
[1:22] life and we recognize that because of
[1:25] the miracle of satellite television the
[1:28] Lord is allowing us to reach you in your
[1:31] part of the world perhaps in places that
[1:33] we may never be able to go physically
[1:36] just simply because of time restraints
[1:39] but it is a wonderful joy every time an
[1:42] email comes in from someone and they say
[1:44] we watch you on the gospel Channel we
[1:47] watch you on Angel TV sometimes people
[1:50] say we watch you on the Internet we see
[1:52] these programs on by streaming them on
[1:56] the networks on the internet or even by
[2:00] podcast so however you see these
[2:02] programs it is a real joy and I say that
[2:05] from the bottom of my heart to be able
[2:07] to come to you in this manner and we
[2:09] know it's a gift from God
[2:10] and we want to use it we want to be good
[2:13] stewards of the gift that the Lord has
[2:15] given us so we invite you if you haven't
[2:18] already contacted our ministry the
[2:20] contact information is given to you at
[2:22] the bottom of the screen and it would be
[2:25] a great delight to hear from you also
[2:27] share with us your prayer request we
[2:29] believe that where two or more agree is
[2:32] touching on any one thing the Lord has
[2:34] promised that he would grant it and so
[2:37] we we really enjoy the privilege of
[2:39] being able to join with you in faith for
[2:42] your prayer requests the most exciting
[2:44] part of praying with you concerning your
[2:48] prayer requests is when another email
[2:50] comes in with a testimony to tell us
[2:53] that God has answered prayer we've had
[2:55] testimonies of people healed from cancer
[2:57] we've had testimonies of children who
[3:00] were
[3:01] born very handicapped and very afflicted
[3:04] and God intervened and one child
[3:07] particularly was an unable to walk and
[3:10] after prayer the Lord raised up the
[3:13] child to be able to walk and baffle the
[3:15] doctors and so I tell you when we know
[3:18] that we have had some small part in
[3:20] agreeing with you in faith and then God
[3:23] gives the increase then it's a it's a
[3:25] wonderful encouragement to me to our
[3:27] family and to all of those who pray with
[3:30] us here in Alabama for your request I
[3:33] want to look we're starting a new series
[3:35] today we're going to be talking about
[3:38] the spiritual process of adoption and
[3:42] adoption spiritual adoption has been
[3:45] misunderstood down through the church
[3:47] ages and we're going to talk about it
[3:50] for the next few weeks we're going to
[3:52] look at the scriptures we're going to
[3:53] examine some of the Greek words and I
[3:56] trust and pray that God will use this
[4:00] series to quicken your heart and to
[4:02] awaken you to your destiny as an adopted
[4:06] son of God so we want to look to the
[4:08] Word of God right now if you'll go with
[4:10] me to Romans chapter 8 we're going to
[4:14] begin reading in verse 14 Romans chapter
[4:18] 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by
[4:24] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[4:29] God for ye have not received the spirit
[4:34] of bondage again to fear but ye have
[4:39] received the spirit of adoption see that
[4:44] is one of the very first places in the
[4:47] Bible where we get that word thus the
[4:51] phrase the spirit of adoption indicating
[4:55] that we're not talking about a natural
[4:57] process of adoption through the legal
[5:00] court system where a family might adopt
[5:04] a child from another family whose
[5:06] parents were unable to take care of that
[5:09] child but we're talking about a
[5:11] spiritual process of adoption
[5:14] we have not received the spirit of
[5:16] bondage again to fear but ye have
[5:19] received the spirit of adoption I even
[5:23] like the way it sounds
[5:25] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[5:30] itself we're talking about his spirit
[5:33] beareth witness with our spirit his
[5:37] spirit is bearing witness coming into
[5:41] agreement with our spirit that we are
[5:45] the children of God
[5:47] now what this verse is saying to us is
[5:50] it is only by revelation spirit to
[5:54] spirit fellowship with God a revelation
[5:58] where a vital truth that we have heard
[6:02] that we have read that somehow has
[6:05] entered into our mind into our thinking
[6:07] process now by the inspiration of the
[6:10] Holy Spirit we say it drops from our
[6:13] head to our heart it becomes more it was
[6:18] an idea it was a thought it was perhaps
[6:21] a belief but when the Spirit of God
[6:23] anoints that truth and it drops down
[6:27] into our heart and deeper than that
[6:30] into our spirit man it becomes a
[6:32] revelation and it's only by revelation
[6:36] that we can know that we are truly the
[6:39] sons of God now remember that this is a
[6:43] genderless spiritual process it has
[6:47] nothing to do with male or female so if
[6:51] you're a precious sister and you're
[6:52] watching this program and you say he's
[6:55] not even preaching about me because I'm
[6:58] a woman and he never says daughter of
[7:00] God
[7:01] he always says a son of God but we
[7:04] understand that these spiritual truths
[7:06] are genderless they're not based on male
[7:10] or female they're their spiritual and in
[7:14] this aspect the Bible tells us there is
[7:17] neither male nor female with God now
[7:21] it's also interesting to understand that
[7:23] God is speaking to his people all over
[7:26] the world about the bridal pair
[7:28] dime or the revelation of being the
[7:31] bride of Jesus Christ and this is also a
[7:34] genderless revelation so if I as a male
[7:39] can be the Bride of Christ then you my
[7:42] precious sister can be a son of God it's
[7:46] a genderless revelation but remember we
[7:50] don't come to that place of being a son
[7:53] of God because we join a church or
[7:55] because we shape the pastor's hand or
[7:58] because our name is put on the rulebook
[8:01] of a particular denomination or a
[8:04] religious system this is a spiritual
[8:08] birth we are born again of the Spirit of
[8:12] God we are then sanctified by the
[8:15] washing of the water of the word and
[8:18] then we receive the precious infilling
[8:23] or the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[8:26] fire and this completes the new birth
[8:31] process once we receive the baptism of
[8:34] the Holy Spirit we we can say that we
[8:38] have come to this full place of being
[8:40] born again but there's more once we can
[8:45] say I have now in reality and in
[8:48] fulfillment been born again of the
[8:50] Spirit of God that's not the end that's
[8:53] the end of one process but it's the
[8:55] beginning of something much greater than
[8:58] that being born again of the Spirit of
[9:02] God is the beginning of your spiritual
[9:05] process of becoming an adopted son of
[9:10] God or we'll read in this study later in
[9:14] one of the portions of Scripture in the
[9:16] New Testament where it talks about the
[9:18] manifestation the unveiling the
[9:22] revealing of the sons of God and that's
[9:25] where we are coming to swiftly in this
[9:29] hour a time where God Almighty is going
[9:33] to unveil he's going to take the cover
[9:37] off and he's going to show planet Earth
[9:40] what he's been working
[9:41] on for six thousand years he's been
[9:44] working on a bribed one who a company
[9:49] when we say one we don't mean one
[9:51] individual we mean one company one group
[9:54] of people a holy remnant that God will
[9:57] manifest himself through in great and
[10:01] mighty ways here in the end time now I
[10:05] was going to just read these verses and
[10:07] then break them down at the end but
[10:10] since we talked about verse 16 the
[10:13] spirit itself various beareth witness
[10:15] with our spirit that we are the children
[10:18] of God then I want to go back to verse
[10:20] 15 for ye received the spirit of bondage
[10:24] again to fear now there are multiple
[10:28] layers of truth in verse 15 we can talk
[10:32] about lots of different subjects one
[10:35] thing that we could look at is fear the
[10:38] Bible tells us that fear brings torment
[10:41] and I'm finding out that the enemy is
[10:45] doing everything he can in this hour to
[10:48] bind God's people with fear but we must
[10:53] overcome fear and the Bible tells us how
[10:56] fear is overcome you remember what the
[10:59] scripture said the Bible tells us that
[11:02] perfect love the perfect love of God
[11:06] that has been shed abroad in our hearts
[11:09] through the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the
[11:13] Messiah because of that perfect love
[11:16] fear is cast out perfect love casteth
[11:20] out fear it is not God's will for you to
[11:25] be paralyzed by fear the fear of the
[11:29] unknown the fear of stepping out in
[11:31] faith to obey the Word of God are to
[11:35] obey the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[11:38] it is not God's will for you to be
[11:41] afraid of coming into the place of your
[11:44] destiny where where you are beginning to
[11:47] fulfill what God has called you to do
[11:49] there are hidden gifts and talents that
[11:53] are a part of your
[11:54] Destinee that are a part of who you are
[11:56] that are lying in you right now in seed
[12:01] form that must be anointed by the power
[12:04] of the Spirit of God and quickened and
[12:07] made alive so that they will begin to
[12:09] manifest and that causes many people to
[12:12] be afraid because as one brother said to
[12:15] me one time I know that if I yield
[12:18] myself to the Spirit of God I will lose
[12:22] control and really I thought that was a
[12:26] outstanding thing that the brother would
[12:28] be able to admit his fear of losing
[12:32] control but many of us have that fear
[12:35] we're afraid that if we yield our lives
[12:37] to the Spirit of God that we no longer
[12:39] called the shots that he begins to make
[12:43] our decisions for us and I want to tell
[12:45] you as something not an expert but as
[12:49] someone who has learned that walk of
[12:52] surrendering my will and losing control
[12:54] it's the greatest life there is there's
[12:57] no life greater on planet earth or I
[13:01] want to say above the earth or under the
[13:04] earth as well that there's no life that
[13:07] could compare to knowing that you are
[13:10] led every moment by the power of the
[13:14] Holy Spirit and if you lose your way or
[13:17] the instruction from the Lord is a
[13:20] little bit unclear then you just go back
[13:22] to him in prayer and you say Lord I've
[13:24] lost my way I can't seem to hear from
[13:26] you I'm not sure what you would have me
[13:28] to do and so I'm going to do nothing I'm
[13:31] going to stand still until you reveal to
[13:34] me the next step and God who is faithful
[13:37] he wants to reveal that to us now what
[13:40] we've just been describing is a big
[13:43] portion of what we would call the Spirit
[13:46] walk and God is calling us to step out
[13:50] of the walk of carnality the flesh walk
[13:54] and he's even calling us to a place
[13:56] where we are no longer allowing our soul
[14:00] or even our heart to lead us but where
[14:05] we are allowing the Spirit
[14:08] that God has given us our human spirit
[14:10] that has been regenerated by his Spirit
[14:14] that spirit to spirit contact or spirit
[14:18] to spirit fellowship the transformation
[14:21] of our spirit because of his spirit
[14:25] coming to live inside and that's how we
[14:27] want to be led from his spirit that has
[14:31] given new life to our spirit so really
[14:34] there is a place in Christ where his
[14:37] spirit and our spirit are merged and we
[14:41] call this the union experience we are
[14:45] thinking about the Apostle Paul when he
[14:48] was talking about some of the heavenly
[14:51] experiences that he had had and he said
[14:54] I knew a man in Christ and you know many
[14:58] of you are familiar with that he was
[15:00] caught up into the third heaven and so
[15:02] forth God showed him some unbelievable
[15:04] revelations and some of which could not
[15:06] even be uttered because of the magnitude
[15:09] and and then he also tells us that he
[15:12] was there was a messenger of Satan that
[15:15] was assigned to him to buffett him lest
[15:19] he be exalted above measure because of
[15:22] the magnitude of the revelation that God
[15:24] was giving him but when we read that in
[15:26] the King James it says I knew a man in
[15:28] Christ and I think that's lovely
[15:31] but I don't think we get the fullness of
[15:33] what that means I knew a man in Christ
[15:35] sometimes when we read that we think
[15:38] well I he's saying I knew a man that
[15:41] went church or I knew a man that went to
[15:43] Mass or I knew a man that fasted on
[15:46] Friday but it's so much more than that
[15:49] and I like dr. Stern's translation of
[15:53] the Bible the complete Jewish Bible and
[15:56] in his translation of that verse of
[15:57] scripture he said I knew a man in union
[16:01] with Messiah and I want to tell you
[16:05] something that's not just for the
[16:08] Apostle Paul's of planet Earth that's
[16:10] not just for the Enoch enix or the
[16:13] Elijah's or the Moses that is a promise
[16:17] that is available to you and I it
[16:21] is possible for men and women in this
[16:25] hour to come into that place of being in
[16:30] union with Messiah it is about
[16:35] relationship we're finding out in this
[16:38] hour this is the most unusual hour
[16:42] season of my Christian journey I've been
[16:46] preaching the gospel since 1975 so I'll
[16:50] be celebrating this year 34 years of
[16:54] following the Lord Jesus and having the
[16:56] baptism of the holy spirit and preaching
[16:59] the gospel
[17:00] I entered into active full-time public
[17:03] ministry at the age of seven and started
[17:06] pastoring a Pentecostal church at the
[17:09] age of 17 so ministry is all I've ever
[17:12] known but this right now is the most
[17:16] unusual season that I've ever known
[17:20] in the Lord because his emphasis is a so
[17:26] loud he is emphasizing this one thing so
[17:32] loud in my spirit and many of those men
[17:35] and women around the world who have
[17:37] prophetic insight are getting the same
[17:40] message the same theme the same emphasis
[17:44] and that is it's all about relationship
[17:48] with him and you know this makes some of
[17:53] us very uncomfortable because we have
[17:56] learned to approach God by the vehicle
[18:00] of religion and there is safety in
[18:04] religion people feel safe in religion
[18:09] because they know what religion dictates
[18:11] and what it expects it doesn't matter
[18:15] what flavor of religion you have you
[18:18] know if you've been brought up in a
[18:20] particular religious faith you know what
[18:22] the expectations are and so over a
[18:26] period of time you begin to think if I
[18:29] meet those expectations then I have a
[18:33] relation
[18:34] ship with God if I follow the
[18:39] expectations or the rules of my church
[18:42] then I am automatically magically in
[18:47] relationship with God and this is where
[18:51] religion has its place it certainly has
[18:56] its place but religion is not enough
[18:59] because religion can become tradition
[19:03] and it can become legalism it can bring
[19:08] us to the place where we feel like the
[19:11] only way that we can approach God is to
[19:14] live more religiously and when I say
[19:18] religious I don't mean a life of
[19:21] dedication or a life of real
[19:23] consecration I mean a life where we
[19:27] think by going to church two or three
[19:31] times a week or in some faiths two or
[19:33] three times a day
[19:37] you know perhaps praying with beads or
[19:40] are going through some liturgy and I
[19:43] don't want to leave out the Pentecostal
[19:45] church because we have a lot of
[19:47] Pentecostal liturgy we have a lot of
[19:49] ideas about what church is supposed to
[19:52] be and what it's not supposed to be but
[19:54] when we start depending on those things
[19:56] to bring us closer to God then we're
[19:59] using religion in a wrong way and and
[20:02] the end of that road will never be
[20:05] relationship and so I think what we must
[20:08] do in this hour is to find relationship
[20:11] first and God will lead us by
[20:15] relationship to where we need to be in
[20:17] him and I trust the the convicting power
[20:22] of the Spirit of God to speak to you as
[20:26] individuals if you're in relationship if
[20:30] you're in union with Messiah he will
[20:33] teach you the Bible said so
[20:35] when he the Spirit of Truth has come he
[20:38] will lead you and guide you into all
[20:41] righteousness it is the will of God that
[20:44] you walk sanctified and
[20:47] separated and set apart from the things
[20:50] of this world but but religion cannot
[20:54] produce relationship so if we if we
[20:58] allow the Spirit of God to draw us into
[21:00] relationship first then by our
[21:05] relationship with him he will then
[21:08] reveal to us the things that we should
[21:10] do the things that we should not do the
[21:13] the the measure of dedication that he
[21:17] would want us to have how long he would
[21:19] have us to fast and and how we need to
[21:22] be faithful to meet with one another in
[21:24] in faith and talk about the good things
[21:27] of the Lord perhaps how we should be
[21:30] modest because God wants his people to
[21:33] to conduct themselves and in a modest
[21:37] way in a holy way so that wherever we
[21:41] are and whatever we're doing people are
[21:43] able to immediately identify us as
[21:46] children of God but what has happened in
[21:49] the church world is we have brought
[21:51] people to religion which leaves us
[21:55] feeling very detached from God and then
[22:00] when we make us a mistake and when we
[22:02] fail we feel like all of heaven is angry
[22:05] and that God is sitting on his throne
[22:07] with a white wig and a sledgehammer and
[22:10] he's ready to crack our heads with his
[22:12] sledgehammer and nothing could be any
[22:15] further away from the truth the truth is
[22:19] your heavenly Father loves you and he's
[22:22] not going to compromise with your sin
[22:24] he's not going to pat you on the back
[22:27] when you walk in unrighteousness but his
[22:29] desire when you fail when you sin when
[22:32] you make a mistake his desire is to call
[22:36] you to draw you back into relationship
[22:40] with him so his way of correcting you
[22:44] his preferred way of correcting you is
[22:49] by grace and in love calling you back
[22:52] into fellowship with him now if you're
[22:55] as hard-headed as I've been sometimes
[22:57] over the years it takes more than a
[22:59] gentle wooing of
[23:01] come back and get on the right track
[23:03] sometimes God does have to deal with us
[23:05] a little more harshly but the scripture
[23:07] tells us this is also a part of God's
[23:09] Way it's also a part of relationship the
[23:13] Bible tells us that those who God loves
[23:16] he chastens he corrects he brings
[23:20] correction to and if he does not correct
[23:23] us then we're illegitimate we are none
[23:26] of his and I believe that many of you
[23:30] are desiring a place of relationship and
[23:34] you love your church and you love what
[23:37] you've been brought up in and you love
[23:39] the fellowship that you get but you're
[23:41] finding out that that is not enough you
[23:44] can follow all the traditions you can
[23:47] follow all the rules you can be faithful
[23:49] to church you can pay your tithe and
[23:52] still not be satisfied with your
[23:54] spiritual life so let us work on
[23:58] relationship first and thank God
[24:01] relationship is a two-way street it's
[24:03] it's it's hearing from God and it's also
[24:07] God hearing from you
[24:09] he wants you to be able to pour your
[24:12] heart out to him and you know some
[24:15] people are so afraid of offending the
[24:17] Lord if they tell God how they really
[24:19] feel I have a newsflash for you he
[24:22] already knows how you feel so when you
[24:25] tell him how you feel
[24:26] you're not going to offend him he
[24:28] already knows and it is so healing it's
[24:32] so strengthening to be able to go to the
[24:34] Lord sometime and say I don't understand
[24:36] what's happening around me I don't
[24:39] understand what's happening in my life
[24:41] right now and I'm not here to complain
[24:44] I'm here to ask for your help and for
[24:48] your strength
[24:48] I want your deliverance I want your
[24:51] healing power I want your word to work
[24:53] in my life as you have promised that it
[24:56] will and it will so God doesn't want us
[24:59] bound by fear he doesn't want us bound
[25:02] by religion he doesn't want us bound by
[25:05] shame he war he wants us to be bound to
[25:09] him in love in perfect love you have not
[25:14] received the
[25:14] spirit of bondage again to fear but
[25:16] you've received the spirit of adoption
[25:17] whereby we cry Abba Father now I get to
[25:22] tell my favorite story about this phrase
[25:25] ABBA
[25:26] it's the Hebrew word of affection for
[25:29] father and this is what God is calling
[25:33] us to and I'm gonna say this again and
[25:36] then I'm gonna get off religion but most
[25:39] people with a religious mindset have a
[25:41] very hard time embracing the concept
[25:45] that your father wants you to come into
[25:49] a place your heavenly father the father
[25:52] of all the creator of the universe wants
[25:55] you he's after you his heart is toward
[26:00] you and he wants to show you his love
[26:02] and he wants to pull you into a place of
[26:06] intimate fellowship and relationship
[26:08] with him and because of religion most of
[26:12] us have a very hard time embracing that
[26:15] idea that God really cares that much
[26:19] about us as individuals but I want to
[26:22] tell you friend he does and he would
[26:25] move heaven and earth to come after you
[26:28] that is his love and that is His grace
[26:32] when we're in Jerusalem sometimes we
[26:34] like to go to the market to the shook
[26:37] and sometimes we go on air Shabbat which
[26:41] is the day before Shabbat begins that
[26:43] evening and people are busy very very
[26:46] busy buying their food their produce and
[26:50] everything that is going to be a part of
[26:53] their Sabbath meal and even beautiful
[26:56] flowers to adorn the table and
[26:58] oftentimes I will see father's with
[27:02] their small children most of the time
[27:04] you will see mothers and their small
[27:06] children but oftentimes on this day
[27:08] mother is at home she's cleaning the
[27:11] house she's preparing the food she's
[27:13] getting ready to usher in the Shabbat
[27:15] and father bravely has taken the
[27:19] children to buy the last-minute things
[27:22] that have been forgotten now in the
[27:24] press of the crowd in the in the
[27:27] shouting of the
[27:28] then nurse a little child can get lost
[27:31] from his father very easily and it has
[27:35] been more than once that I've heard the
[27:38] cry of a little child saying
[27:42] abba-abba-abba and every father in the
[27:46] vicinity every father in in distance in
[27:50] the right distance to be able to hear
[27:52] the child will stop what they're doing
[27:53] to see if this is their child that is
[27:57] calling out Papa Abba daddy and you know
[28:01] I have children and my time is gone and
[28:05] I'm gonna have to let you go and talk to
[28:09] you about this another time father I
[28:11] just ask that you would take this truth
[28:14] and make it real in the heart of every
[28:17] viewer in the name of Yeshua the Lord
[28:19] Jesus Christ we pray amen bye-bye thank
[28:22] you for watching the Eagles cry tune in
[28:24] again
[28:27] [Music]
[28:57] you
