TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you can feel the wind blow but there's no one who really knows where it's going sometimes it's a breeze gently stirring the trees as it's blowing that's just how it is when the spirit within starts to flow in [Applause] like the wind it's a warm gentle touch from the hand of the lord the hand of the lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] and make oceans run dry [Music] but the very same hand [Music] [Music] wherever i go this hand's holding mine there are times we all know there's simply no place to go but to jesus though the tempest may blow he has promised he won't ever leave us at the end of the road he will carry the load for the weakest saying listen to me stand still you'll see the hand of the lord the hand of the lord [Music] and make oceans run dry but the very same hand [Music] what a blessing to know wherever i go this hand's holding mine [Music] what a blessing to know wherever i go his hands holding mine
