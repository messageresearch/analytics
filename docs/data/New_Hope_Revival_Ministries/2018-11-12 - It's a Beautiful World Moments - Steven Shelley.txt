TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I am a part of the word bride of Jesus Christ and because I have the word of God in me because that is my origin because that is my seed because that is my Genesis because that is my beginnings I am creative by Nature as soon as I become one with him in the spirit I become creative there are many aspects of my life that I have to create I believe we create the atmosphere of our life by how we come into agreement with the Word of God I believe we create the atmosphere of our home by how we come into agreement with the Word of God therefore I believe we could say it's a beautiful world because I'm living in the one I created if your life is not beautiful if you recognize tonight I'm not living in a beautiful world don't don't feel condemned and don't throw up your hands and quit just do what God has given you the authority and the power to do create a better one
