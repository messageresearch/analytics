Description:
“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” 2 Corinthians 10:3-5

and we're so thankful for his presence Somebody's Watching The Chosen because we had two songs this morning older than the chosen the the stories are older than the than the films but isn't it wonderful when some old story becomes new to you again and fresh to you again and this has happened to us as Tiffany sister Tiffany and sister Jaya were singing oh Hallelujah press through the crowd and then brother Luke and sister Megan reminding us that death has to flee well this has been a wonderful wonderful worship service may God help us now in the word would you thank the Lord with me for these musicians and the leading of the worship camera people stream people projector people whatever else your job is your help to us well we just appreciate it so much and we're just thankful for all that God is doing and we don't want to take time for a lot you may be seated just a moment but prepare to get right back up but I feel for you you've been standing a lot and we'll just uh mention that we are very very thankful for God's protection just a few days ago the Lord was so good to us I don't know about you but I like to be home when it's storming and but the Lord just spoke so sweetly to my heart and he said I want you to be at the campground during the time of the storms and I want you to be praying and so that's what I was doing I wanted to be at home I really did I I believe that this is a very safe place but I wanted to be where my family was but his presence was so real here and the rain came in sheets and waves and the winds were blowing and Howling and you know really God was so good to us because the the worst of the storm just stepped over us it just went right over us hitting Selma and Montgomery and places up up Interstate 85 and then right over us started at LaGrange 85 Interstate went right all the way up to Griffin and I don't know did you see the Hobby Lobby pictures and Griffin took a wall out and uh a big brick building where poor children were gathered people are gathered for safety took the building down not one loss of life there and trucks uh just as close to us as the Grange 18-wheeler truck turned over on the side of the road by the wind and God was so good he was so good and some loss of lives I've heard different numbers I'm not sure exactly what the total was and those lives are precious and uh they they weren't taken by accident no they their their number the days the number of their days had come to an end and it was ordained oh yes you can have predestination one way in sovereignty one way and not have it another way it goes all the way across the board and you know what I appreciate about God's sovereignty so much is that uh we don't have to live in this cycle of if if he would have had a better doctor if they'd put him in a different hospital it just takes all the responsibility All For You and I and I was just listening this week to just a little clip of a service from here and uh we were talking about that terrible tragedy that happened when that uh was it what was the little girl's name Chloe no no it was her sister the Reynolds girl Charity Reynolds cherish cherish your cherith cherish I just happened to to click on a service and that I was talking about that event when her life was taken so quickly I heard dad a preacher and we were talking about the the reality that he had met those girls just a few minutes before the accident at Walmart and the thought comes to our minds I know it would any human being you have to resist that and push that down what if I would have talked to my girls another 10 minutes what if I would have bought him a Coca-Cola what if we would have lingered in the parking lot but you know what when we trust in the sovereignty of God we realize that nothing he could have done would have changed that event now it's hard to think of that when you're in the fire so embrace it now get that in your spirit now so that when tragedy comes you can continue in your steadfastness that all things work to the good of them who love the Lord the called according to his purpose so I wanted to take a moment and just say thank you Lord for watching over our homes and our families and and this Campground during these storms and you know my grandmother was she believed in the sovereignty of God I told the kids this and they came down there just to oh it seemed like a week before was it the week before that the sirens were going off in the middle of the night we had the kids to come down just because they're up on a hill uh and we didn't want them to be concerned about being in a mobile home but I remember as a little boy my granddaddy was a worry wart and he'd get up in the middle of the night and he'd Go Turn All the Lights On and he'd get try to get my grandmother up and uh he'd say Mildred they're going it's going to blow us away it's gonna it's gonna blow us away and she'd say honey uh we're gonna go she said it don't matter whether you're laying in the bed or under the bed oh she said if it's our time to go it's not going to matter whether you're in a room with no windows or you're standing on the glass porch she said none of that is going to matter we trust in a great big God now if you don't mind I'm gonna roll over and go back to sleep and I can hear my granddaddy now he come come out of the room and he'd say you can't do nothing well holy rollers [Music] you can because we believe we we believe what we believe amen tomorrow is sister Anna Christine's birthday is that right and we're we're not going to ask her if it's a it's if it's a Monumental one because everyone is all of our so we want to say happy birthday to her and we sure appreciate what she does for the Lord and on Thursday of this week is Sister Jeanette West's birthday and if she's streaming this service this morning we want to say to her how much we love her and we miss her and we want to wish her a very happy birthday and brother Bobby Wertz is not a part of our local church but he's a very dear friend of ours and his birthday is on Thursday and he's having some physical pain the last bit more than than usual and so I would like if he should cross your mind especially those of you who know him I would very much like for you to ask the Lord he is he's really the Thomas in the chosen he's the one that didn't get the miracle they call him big Thomas or little Tom not Thomas James I knew you folks would know that's a little extra biblical the story but I I really appreciate it because there are a lot of those little James's out there who didn't get can you imagine riding in a vehicle with God's Prophet who had prayed for hundreds of thousands of people who had been healed and brother Bobby's brother saying to to Bobby Bobby why don't you ask brother Brandon why don't you ask brother Branham brother Branham asked him what it was and he talked about his leg that was crippled with polio and uh brother Branham said if you had two good legs you you'd go you'd never would stop you'd go all the time all things happen for a reason he didn't lose his faith in God or the truth or the prophet or or the ministry because he saw people healed himself before that and after that he just accepted it for a reason and I've heard him say recently even if I would have had good legs and no pain and complete health I might not would be here today I might would be living a different life not even serving God but I'm where I am today by The Sovereign Grace of God folks we've got a lot to be thankful for amen would you stand if I missed your event it wasn't on purpose all of you who are streaming the service I just want to say that we are thankful for every person who comes and visits us but our brother here who has come all the way from Kentucky to be with us today and how many of you like a visitor that comes and sits on the front row I like that he's not scared of us and I appreciate that brother God bless you for being here today second Corinthians chapter 10 I want to read some verses to you there and we are taking just a slight step away from where we have been preaching a series that we've been preaching on the throne of grace we'll come back to that but the Lord is spoken to us here prophetically that we are to expect Supernatural this year 2023 and so we want to get a good understanding of what Supernatural is and when I was here in the service last Sunday I knew how the Lord was already directing my thoughts and I want to just bring a lesson or two on this subject beginning this morning second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 through 5 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holes nothing could be more Supernatural than seeing strongholds brought down casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the original Greek would read like this taking prisoner every thought and you and I must do that this morning and again this afternoon and tomorrow and the next day now could we look at Hebrews 11 verse 1 and 2. it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and for by it the elders obtained a good report what an introduction to the chapter of Faith the Hall of Faith Hebrews chapter 11. and then I would like to go to Second Corinthians I know you're standing chapter 12 verse 5 verses it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord let me remind you that these are the words of the first church age messenger the Apostle Paul he goes on in verse two I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable Words which it is not lawful for a man to utter of such and one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in mine infirmities the apostle was taking himself out of the scenario and he was speaking of his own experience but he was doing it in a way that would not bring Glory or attention to himself it's not us running around I had a dream I had a vision I had an experience it's what God is doing and what he is accomplishing for his glory if God gives you that don't deny it if he gives you a vision you own it don't you be ashamed of it it should be happening in our lives can anybody say Amen now let's finish our reading today in mark 16. verses 17 through 20. and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God which is the right hand of power and authority now listen to what they did and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following notice God is Not confirming the apostles he's not confirming the preachers he's not even confirming the prophets he is confirming his word and when his word is confirmed it is confirmed with signs following now that is Supernatural and we've got something to thank God for father thank you this morning for your great grace among us thank you for the living reality of your word thank you that we're not just reading about what you what you could do or what you might have done but we're reading about a God who is Ever present and ever more able to meet our needs today you are truly without a doubt Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever you change not if you ever were Supernatural God you are a supernatural God today and we are submitting Our Lives to you to your sovereignty we are thanking you for your faithfulness to the children of men we take authority over every spirit and every principality that opposes the supernatural Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and we rebuke and resist their influence and we ask that by the power of the Holy Spirit you would come today and you would confirm your word even Among Us with signs following and we will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated we are serving a supernatural God he is a supernatural God I want to read to you this morning just a little sentence from the message God identifying himself by his characteristics I think the title is powerful I think the title is Anointed but in this little message brother Branham said now again God's characteristic is always Supernatural why because he is Supernatural God is Supernatural now I want to Define supernatural the word Supernatural means it is above above and beyond the natural so anything that God does above the natural anything that God does beyond the natural is Supernatural I want you to know there is there is a vast universe of what God can do out there that we don't fully understand in our little in our little world where we're living I want you to know God is not limited by anything but truth and and he is able to do whatever he needs to do he can defy even the laws that he set in place in nature how many of you believe that gravity is in God's control and the rotation of the earth and all that we understand in the universe is all in God's control if he wants to make iron swim he doesn't have to grunt to do it he doesn't have to strain to make iron swim if he wants the dead to live he doesn't have to work up the faith if he wants the blind to see and the death to hear and the dumb to talk if he wants the dumb to shut up he doesn't have to work hard to make it happen he's God he's God Supernatural he's God's Sovereign he's God's Supreme now I want you to know right now from the get-go he's called you a supernatural people and that means that you and I are also to be able to do above [Music] and Beyond what looks like natural the church at large has settled for natural many around the message of the hour have settled for natural but you must understand that God he's not going to have he has a supernatural people he has he always has he always will because he's a supernatural God nothing limits him nothing constrains him someone said well well doubt can certainly do that in your situation in your circumstance you can limit God in how he effectively moves for you but you can't limit how he moves for me come on I'm putting my faith in there and recognizing who he is and what he does in the next little sentence here in a message called a greater than Solomon is here brother Branham said in paragraph 46 God always in every age in every age dealt with man how through signs you know I love the way they quote this I love the way they say oh yeah they're just like the Jews they finally know a scripture they say oh they're just like Jews down there always looking for a sign you've got to understand I'm not looking for a sign I'm not following a sign I'm not chasing after a sign I read what the book said these signs shall follow them that believe my belief my belief my faith is tested by the supernatural that's how I know I have a supernatural Faith because I see God moving in a supernatural way come on now oh we could stand here all day all night and two or three more days reading the things that brother Branham has said about how the Supernatural is to be present in our everyday life I have to believe it's there I believe that sometimes we step over it we look over it we don't see it but he's there times that we come along on a car accident and we say all those poor people never realizing that you spilled your coffee you had to go back and clean off your clothes or change your shirt or do something like that and and if not you would have been right there in the middle of that that's a supernatural God looking out for a supernatural people so if you look at it that way you'll never run out of things to praise him for you'll never run out of things to glorify God for or shout about because he's always moving around us in a supernatural way I believe that uh Wednesday evening of this week we were streaming in our home the first night of Harmony in the desert the first year in six years not counting coveted year that we have not been there as a family together and we were streaming it there and they were they always hear a tape on the first night bringing people together by the word which is a very good idea because you're going to sing several spend several days singing and that's a wonderful thing to do but it's always good to bring the people's attention to what brings us together when we're there it's the word that's what brings you and I together that's what makes us a family it's the word among us that's the attraction it must be and we were not only listening to the comments and the announcements and the introductions but we stayed I stayed and listened to the tape it was the tape expectations it was preached in that very church the church that is now Tucson Tabernacle was Once Upon a Time Grant Avenue Assembly of God brother Branham was invited it was his first sermon in Tucson he was invited to preach there and one of the brothers had actually laid the foundation step for that church there were several families that were living in Tucson attending the Assembly of God Church while following the ministry of brother Branham they had no church to fellowship with so in that hour it was safe for them to Fellowship there and as they're nailing the step and working on it the brother was praying Lord I want you to make a way for that prophet of God to step across this threshold and preach in this church and I'm sitting there knowing that and I'm sitting there listening to this tape and what was the message expectations if God is saying to us you should watch and recognize the supernatural among you I'm going to move among you in Supernatural ways in 2023 then you and I have to work today on our expectation we have to raise the level of our expectation and we must recognize that anything is possible when God is moving in our lives what makes a service a powerful service is when you and I come together with our licks of fire and we're not rubbing our wounds and licking our wounds for all that we've been through this week we're laying all of our troubles down we're putting our problems aside and we're lifting up a praise to a faithful God that creates an atmosphere where Faith begins to boil and you don't even have to have hands laid on you all you have to do is say it's mine healing is mine Deliverance is mine the victory is mine [Applause] I don't know how many songs we sung this morning with the word victory in it but there were several of them he is our Victory the Victory Is Ours somebody said well I don't feel very Victorious uh what's feelings Got to Do with It I don't want to hurt your feelings but nobody cares what you're feeling let me tell you what sister Megan Kino said she said I'm not going to be able to be there today brother Shelley she needs prayer and she said this probably twofold she said it's all in my head you remember a sermon I preached one time it's all in your head you want to make people mad when they have spent 30 minutes telling you how rough and terrible and awful their life is and you just look at them this is my style and you just look at them and say well it's all in your head you talk about church folks wanting to cuss they'll have that look at your man that's all in my head the truth is a whole lot of it if not all of it it's what we worked ourselves up into people will come to me and ask me to pray and then tell me after I'm praying how worried they are well why don't you just go worry and don't bother me to pray you just go worry a solution see if worrying is going to make a difference but if you decide to pray you've got to stop that worrying you've got to make up your mind whatever comes life or death God is good whatever happens on my job God is good Hallelujah I was listening to the testimony service that took place on Thursday morning during Harmony brother sister Anna Miller's dad brother Forrest farmer was giving his testimony of how his dad went there with this attitude here brother Forrest had his crippled feet and his dad went there with attitude I'm going to see if this is real I'm going to see if he's shotgunning because there were a lot of men on the scene you know when you shoot if when you fire a shotgun it spreads those little pellets in all directions and there were preachers in those days just speaking very general words that could apply to anybody and I don't want to criticize that because God heals people under those kinds of things but if a man is going to be a prophet then brother Forrest Farmer's Daddy he had the attitude he's going to have to be a little more than just so wonder what he thought we know what he thought we've heard the testimony when brother Branham looked right up in the crowd and called his name Mr farmer told him about the little boy that was down behind in front of him there with crippled feet now I'm telling you you you can't call that a shotgun that was gun barrel sniper straight wasn't it that was Supernatural God's a supernatural God and then brother minnow Friesen who has turned 80 years old and has finally retired as the pastor and his son-in-law is pastoring the church he give a little testimony and they were in brother branham's meetings and particularly there for the series on marriage and divorce and and he quoted a scripture that we all know but it is nothing but the truth he said like David I am an old man and I have never seen [Music] I have never seen the righteous see no 13 year old boy up there telling us that here's a man 80 years old lived his life for the truth I tell you it means something when he quotes a scripture like that I'm an old man he said and I have never seen the righteous forsaken nor God's seed beckoned for bread brother sister there's nothing that's nothing but the truth so you ask God to deliver you from that Spirit of a worry wart and you understand that God is a supernatural God he's going to provide a pillow for your head he's going to provide a meal for your body and for your family there are going to be shoes on your children's feet I don't care what the doctor says I want to confess something I got the same text that brother Greeley got this morning about praying for crystalline and her babies Michael sent us a text and it's already started it always does it always will the doctors are always covering theirselves [Music] they tried that on us they're just trying to I don't I'm not against it they don't want to be sued they they want to cover all their bases and so someday I'll start telling you all the things that can be wrong well I got the devil for that I don't have to pay somebody to tell me all them things you better let it go in one ear and out the other here I said to brother Greeley when you request prayer would you don't mention that don't mention that because we don't need to strike fear in anybody's heart [Music] I'm going to be honest with you this morning I can't tell you how many babies are going to be born at the end of this I don't have that answer from the Lord but here's what I know the devil won't take any of them [Applause] foreign he cannot he cannot he only has the power that you allow him to have he only has the power that God grants him as permission and so I'm going to use my faith in an entirely different way and I'm going to decree and declare what I believe to be the truth that God will give them health that they will be exactly the size they're supposed to be [Applause] fully functional I'm going to speak what I believe is right and I'm going to put my trust in the Lord he took our little Benjamin over to the pediatrician and they had told us you know we're going to have to turn you in we're going to have to report you because pretty much you don't do everything we tell you to do and believe everything that we tell you to believe and our insurance won't cover us so you're we're going to have to turn you in and tell you we went home a few hours early from the hospital they said we're going to turn you into Family Services you can't get worked up you just have to roll we took him over there to my wife is Canadian so I'm not against Canadians but we took him over there to a Canadian pediatrician Dr so and so and he say look down he's done treated him and he's seen him a couple times he looks down at him and he says hmm his eye whites are kind of Gray we're just young parents we're just sitting there all relaxed until he says that and then we go we've seen him every day we never knew he had gray eyes we feel like rotten sorry parents I didn't know I had great did you know he had gray eye did you no I didn't know and we said to the doctor well what does that mean and he had no no tact he had no bedside manner at all should have started off with a little stuff no he looked right at me and he said well it could mean that he has brittle bone disease foreign we go out of there and I'm praying Lord I pay my tithes oh God I tried to do what's right I live good to the best of oh forgive me Lord I did say so and so I'm trying to get everything right because I don't want my bored child to have brittle bone disease so my wife said we've got to take him back in a few weeks so I said well I'm going with you you're not going by yourself bracing ourselves I said what about the gray of his eyes he said oh I said you said that it might mean that he has are we going to do some tests he said no it it could mean that he has brittle bone disease or it could mean nothing at all so he said I think it this probably means nothing at all now you know what I tell you what I'd like to go [Music] it's of our ability because he tried to aided me no harm but the enemy tried to use him to strike a fear and you may not believe what I'm telling you but I know what fear can do it becomes a magnet fear draws disease fear draws problems to your life the little booklet that they handed out in the Branham campaigns do you fear cancer if you let fear take a hold of your life every symptom you have you will run to Dr Google [Music] how many have been there this week to Dr Google you don't know he is not reputable Dr Google works for the drug companies [Applause] [Music] Dr Google was for the devil devil you want to about anybody on Dr Google you can have a little slight problem and go look and the next thing you know you're sure you have stomach cancer [Music] may I just be very plain I'm going to step over here just because you're constipated doesn't mean you have stomach cancer you cannot believe everything you read your trust has to be in the Lord [Applause] someone called and said did you know that that there might have not been as many as brother Branham said that fell off the bridge I said well how did you know that were you there no I wasn't there I Googled it I said sin that's right Google wasn't there I said send me the article and they sent me a Wikipedia article did you know people Wikipedia competed on there anything I want to put on there and even the person themselves has a hard time getting it off of there once it's approved so you can read anything you want to out there you will be a nervous wreck you will plan your children's funeral you'll see an attorney you'll take everything the doctor gives you to take if your source of Truth is the World Wide Web but you get an anchor in the word of God and you begin to realize that we serve a supernatural God who is bigger he's bigger than gray eyes you've seen you see him up there jumping around bouncing around I've seen him on the softball field I've seen him doing all kinds of things doing this and that and the other the gym he don't have any brittle bone disease thank you this is just how the enemy works he'll tell you you're going to lose your children he'll tell you you're going to this that and the other come on we serve a supernatural God I want to read Ephesians 3. we're not getting very far 19 and 20 but maybe God will speak to us in the simple and to know the love of Christ which passeth the knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God does that sound good to anybody to be filled with all the fullness of God and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God verse 20. now unto him that is able now unto him that is able to do exceeding I know I always put a a a exceedingly on there but but we've just quoted the way we heard it I don't think exceeding and exceedingly is going to going to throw us off here but let's say it just like the word said it now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above oh that's a supernatural God that's a God that can make the iron float that's a God that could cause the sun to stand still that's a God that can create today just like he created in the beginning by the power of the spoken word he's still a creator I received a promise from the Lord some years ago that he was going to give new organs that people weren't just going to have healed Hearts they would have new Hearts they weren't just going to have better livers they were going to have new livers somebody said I don't know about that it doesn't matter whether you know about it or not the God who made the first liver knows how to give you another liver The God Who made the first heart is able to give you another heart according to your faith be it done unto you don't you let the enemy sign your death certificate prematurely you stand on the promise of God he who is able to do exceeding abundantly above that we ask all above all that we ask what I asked for may be differently than what I think I need you know sometimes we think big and we ask small that's why brother Branham taught us you should ask abundantly remember he said you ask abundantly you think abundantly well ask abundantly he's able to give us a exceeding abundant above all that we ask or think according to the power that does what brother Holston that worketh in US that Supernatural power of the supernatural God working inside of us now we've been blessed we've been blessed in our day I want to read two paragraphs from the message the voice of God in this last days and I want to I want to say before I read them I do not believe that God has lost his voice I do not believe that he has laryngitis I don't believe that brother Branham quits that God quit speaking when brother Branham passed away he'll speak to you if you'll shut up and listen he'll speak to your heart he won't tell you anything contrary to his word but he'll talk to you how many of you believe he's still a walking talking God but I want you to know that one of the ways he vindicates that it's his voice talking is with Supernatural and this is explained for us in this message the voice of God in this last days paragraph 31. he said there are so many voices in the Earth today and how many of you know if that was true in 63 it's even more true in 2023 because of Dr Google there is so many voices in the Earth today that it is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens The Voice of the supernatural there are so many natural voices that we become deafened at times to the supernatural voice he said there is so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even shake the Nations he goes on they're just one they're they're just not overnight people but they Shake Nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowerly and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper and they do even today and there's voices that raise up and do all these things and it causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of God are you with me and then he goes on and the voice of God they say how will we know it's the voice of God because for today then it was in a Vindicated Prophet now today how we know it's the voice of God because it's the manifestation oh oh Hallelujah because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word I don't know if you're catching that or not go back and let's look at that again he said now today how do we know how we know it's the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word I think people have forgotten what brother random said was going to be going on in the last day bride I think they got so excited about their little stirrings that they had in the 60s when they started declaring this is the bride's Revival this is the bride's Revival they got so excited about it back then as they began to identify what they thought the Thunders were they got so excited about what was going on it's almost as though they believe that it's finished but I want you to know it's not finished at all it's gaining momentum because the prophet tells us it will and just before the Rapture he tells us there will be a mighty moving of the holy ghost power of God in the last day bride of Jesus Christ a quick short work he calls it he calls it the manifestation of the sons of God he calls it the full adoption of the sons of God he calls him the fullness of the third pole he calls it the bride's Revival [Music] he described how it would look he said there will be ananiases and sapphiras [Music] and a few of them now you that have been around this thing since the 50s and 60s have you seen very many have you been in Services where someone had lied to the Holy Ghost and they felt dead in the church not very often we saw brother way I wasn't there but I know many people that were there and he had a little attitude in his heart toward brother Branham when brother Brandon was preaching he spoke about brother way having a complex which it's obvious that he did because he turns to his wife and he says I resent that and it wasn't long and let me tell you something brother Edmund way was a believer and they can say anything they want to him want to about him but I'm in Israel in 2003. and I'm preaching Jesus name baptism in Jerusalem in 2003 and a woman a little woman sister Emmy walks up to me and she said brother Shelley I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know who brother Branham is and I said you do she said I do because a man named Edmund way and his wife came here and told us and I've followed them down to the river and was baptized so he was a believer but he didn't appreciate his complex being spoken about remember brother Brandon preaches and he says to the people I have developed a bit of a complex you didn't know he said it shall I pull out the 17 quotes where he talks about his complex it's very very common that you and I can pick up a complex and when we do it will hinder us from being who God called us to be but he identified that for brother away and by the way he said I resent that and it wasn't long before brother Wade has a heart attack and is on the floor and his wife a registered nurse reaches down for a pulse and pronounces him dead here's one of the most powerful things of the whole event brother Branham never got excited if it would have been us somebody would have been screaming call 911 service canceled and the whole thing shifted in chained but brother random just when did exactly what needed to be done walks right back up to the pulpit and takes the service and goes on uh he goes on finishes his sermon he goes and finishes his preaching why because he knew that God was a supernatural God his confidence wasn't in his gift his confidence was in his God he had no reason to allow the devil to interrupt or disturb a service let's just get to manage life back and go on we're a supernatural people following a supernatural God has anybody got a problem with that isn't that what we want isn't that what you want to see manifested Among Us don't you want to see the prophet's word manifesting among us even if it means ananiasis and it's a virus I'm quoting he said there will be and a few of them you you got to make up your mind do you really want a supernatural move of God because if you do you you run the risk of having to be careful about your complexes don't you talk to me I know I'm on somebody's toes right now don't you talk to me about a book of Acts Church if you don't want all of it if you don't want to get free from your witchcraft if you won't have to bring in some of your curious arts and burn them in a pile out there don't talk about the book of Acts because when the move of God begins and you have a ax move of God acts of the Holy Spirit moving among you everybody goes to house cleaning sure come on everybody starts going through their movie collection but he starts going through their true romance and true crime books and whatever else they might have they start searching to make sure that it's edifying that it's creating the right atmosphere in your home you can bring one thing in your home and shift the atmosphere and not even know what did it it sometimes takes the Holy Ghost to reveal what it was that shifted the atmosphere of your home you sure you want a book of Acts move a supernatural move of God I do I do even if it's your cherished items [Music] you really want to see you know what else a manifestation of the prophet's words you know what else he said he said missing limbs will be restored I've I've asked a few Through The Years what was he talking about and you know what the answer has been by so many he was describing his own Ministry he's gone he said this was what would be going on just at Rapture time if brother Branham had not finished the commission I want to make sure you understand this morning the devil didn't kill William Branham a drunk driver didn't take brother branham's life and the Jews didn't crucify Jesus Christ and the Romans aren't why he died and a wreck on the Amarillo highway is not what took a profit from the scene the one who called The Prophet said you've done your work it's time for you to decrease so that I can increase in the hearts of the people when we begin to deal with those demonic Powers we're not going to be able to have time to figure it out and do it in the in the name of William Branham I cast you out you try something like that you may get the devil out all right he may strip you of your clothes and you run naked through the streets like the sons of skiva the devil may say Paul I know William Branham I know but who Do You Think You Are there's going to be a people she's in preparation now she's being worked on now he's having religion trimmed off of her now she's getting her legalism out of the way now now she's running to the absolute of the word building a people God is building a people that will take God at his word they won't try to explain it away and why it hadn't already happened they'll understand that God has a timing for all things if God can cause a starfish out there in the ocean to grow another arm or leg or whatever starfish have don't you know he can put a finger on sister Flo's hand don't you know he can put an arm on somebody's elbow don't you know he can put a leg on somebody's knees somebody said I I don't know clucking chickens has stood in the way long enough it's not what he was it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever it's not always pointing the people backward it's helping them to understand that we are to be the manifestation of the prophet's word we're supposed to be the Fulfillment of what the little bride looks like acts like in order to do that we need to hear his voice we need to hear the prophet's voice there's two things brother Branham said that we we must not forget any of it but there's two things we better not forget one is come out of her my people we better stay out of Babylon we better stay out of paganism so you can save your money on my heart-shaped box of chocolates because I'm not going to need it come on come out of her my people be separate saith the Lord and the other thing I don't ever want you to forget is he said stay in line dance [Applause] [Music] so once you come you cloud of Babylon that's not all there is to him now that you're out of those systems you've got to stay in step with the master when he rises you rise when he fall when his foot falls your foot falls when his leg Rises your eyes what we often say this we don't know what it's going to look like well we we do we do know what it's going to look like it's going to look just like the book of Acts looked that's what he's saying somebody said well what did the book of Acts look like it looked just like Matthew 16 said excuse me Mark 16. these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover does anybody still believe that's the Mandate for this hour it has not changed somebody said well we're just uh well you know we're just uh ripening in the Sun the churches so many times have been rottening and you're not supposed to rot in the shade you're supposed to ripen in the Sun so keep putting yourself under the ministry of the son keep getting under the ministry of the son and you'll ripen and not rot you pull out over there into the shade somewhere and you'll turn to rot how many of you know it'll happen you've got to stay under the voice all right he goes on I didn't mean to get on that I think it sounded a little angry and I'm not angry you forgive me if it sounded angry it's the manifestation of the prophet's word that's exactly what we're looking for let's go on he said this is God's prophet and the true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with this Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word you want a definition of a true voice of God there it is a true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with this Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it's the voice of God you better know that for this hour you better know that for this day come on now we need to understand where we are sitting where we're sitting right now and what we're sitting under right now we need to get an understanding of that because we want to see the manifestation of this Supernatural word you've got to be in a place listen if you're in a place where the people don't praise it'll be harder for you to be a praiser these precious men I love these preachers as much as possible but sometimes they come out like a good amen or a good praise O Lord or a good Hallelujah would shatter their reverence or something I I I don't get it if we preachers are afraid for the people to see us in the spirit what will be the attraction for them to get also in the spirit if I come out here and look like some solemn somebody never raise my hand never praise the Lord what would be the motivation of the people to try to enter in and praise the Lord it's very rare that it would continue for any amount of time because the prophet told us that no people are going to get above there you know I don't post these things on Facebook all the time pray for your pastor but I ought to you don't know how many times I delete them just before I post them because the enemy says yeah well they'll just think you're trying to get attention for yourself I I am brother Greely needs it and brother Shelley needs it when you pray I need it he need we need your attention when you pray because every devil in hell would like to stop all of God's men around the world from doing what they do and I tell you if it and somebody said well why should we well you know all the reasons why preachers need prayer but let me give you a new one because it's not likely that you're going to get above us in this thing and so the only hope you've got to go higher is to send us ahead of you does that make sense to anybody oh God raise up my preacher is that my pastor feeling so full of the Holy Ghost [Applause] brother Greeley so full of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah when he walks down the aisle let the Devils of Hell tremble because if you can get your leaders up you get to fly right along all of that this is going to sound self-serving come on I'm gonna say it anyway I want to give you another reason for making sure you're where God wants you to be you know people gravitate toward the quotes they like it's very rare when a man will get up and read enough that you get all sides well we printed out for you today brother that's that's all sides positive negative in between that's all of what he said about that subject that's what we need to be after if we're trying to find the balance you've got to read it all you line that up with the word and then you find where your balance is you don't just depend on a few quotations that your preacher likes and I have my favorites just like you have your favorites but we pastors tend to like those quotes that say things like you get a revelation of who your pastor is and stay with him he's ordained to take you to the Rapture I actually believe that with all my heart he also said stay with that man as long as he's with the word if he leaves the word so a lot of people will think well if he Don't Preach something off the word then I have to be there forever and ever and ever and ever because that's what the prophet's saying well just add this to the list add the one where he said you're not going any higher than your pastor then you make your decision you ought not to run off just because something goes along that you don't like nobody ought to leave a man standing there with no help that's wrong no one should treat anybody like that the first thing you ought to do is fast and pray for your pastor that God will raise him up get him to a higher place so that you can follow but whatever you do don't let Granny's grave don't let the fact that Uncle Leroy bought the piano [Music] he's moving the pillar of fire the supernatural God is moving and he's going to have a people that follow him it's not to a place it's not to a place it's not to Alabama or to Georgia or to Texas or to Louisiana or it's not a geographical the Revival for the bride the stirring for the bride the supernatural happenings and manifestations for the bride are not for geographical locations they're for anywhere the people of God are meeting together expecting Hallelujah I came today with expectation [Music] [Applause] and a true voice of God only brings back the real I gotta hurry only brings back that real living Supernatural god with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it's the voice of God because of that that's there's so much other there's so much other in the other Realms that just almost deadened that out but remember it will glisten it'll come forth it'll do it and how many of you believe it will and that little message have not I sent thee Phoenix Arizona brother random said where God Appears he's Supernatural how about reading the rest of that for me all of you his [Music] you believe that I know you know this this is 101 for everybody in this room and most of you streaming this service I know you would have liked to have heard something a little newer a little a little fresher but I wanted to just remind you if God said I'm going to show you the supernatural in 2023 I wanted you to just get a little bit of expectation I just want you to get stirred a little bit oh Hallelujah because there's nothing like a Supernatural season to bring forth the suddenlies of God and you know what I like about the suddenlies they happen suddenly after all the years of waiting and fasting and logging and praying and all of a sudden the season changes and God just steps on the sea boom overnight it's all right overnight the Affliction is gone overnight why the Deliverance has come the god of the Breakthrough by El perisim has walked into the room the god of the Breakthrough I feel him the god of the Breakthrough [Applause] Hallelujah breaks rule for my family Lord breakthrough for my my body breakthrough for my nerves breakthrough for my blood pressure whatever is oh God break through [Applause] his surosha [Music] [Applause] it's not just a feeling it's what happens when Faith begins to boil let me tell you how demons will operate brother Branham taught us he taught us in prayer lines how demons operate he said wait a minute Spirit that's on that one the spirited on they're calling out to one another he said they know their time has come I feel that he said they know their time has come and they're calling in support for one another I'm paraphrasing it they're trying to join up forces did you know Faith Works the same way did you know that Dark Realm is just a counterfeit [Applause] it's it strikes right off the original it has to if there's a false Pentecost there has to be a real Pentecost if there's a false healing there has to be a real healing if there are false tongues there has to be a genuine Holy Ghost tongue come on they love that Mark 16 cast out devils but they don't know what to do about that speak with new tongues we need it your old tongue keeps getting you in trouble [Music] I'm playing on the words a little bit we need a new tongue Hallelujah oh let me read you some notes here about the supernatural the realm of the supernatural it's a realm of Faith let me just say this before I do that it's a realm of faith we we saw how God taught brother Brandon to believe he he started dealing with him in the natural I mean in a very Supernatural way about very natural things he he let him see a caribou up and God give him the caribou that's how God dealt with David God gave him a lion God gave him a bear and then God gave him a giant delivered the people that's how God was working with brother Branham if he could help him to have the faith to believe for these little visions that would come and then he would see them come to pass it built his faith and he started getting Bolder in his faith now somebody told me he said well brother Brandon he just stepped out on the scene he never had to learn a thing he just did it well I'll tell you what if that's the case he was he came here higher than Jesus Christ because the Bible said though he were a son yet he learned by the things he suffered I want you to know brother Branham had some learning to do because he was a man and he learned in front of the people he didn't have a choice his ministry was so in demand he had to learn as he went and God honored and blessed him for it you let one little thing happen like that and he saw that little vision come to pass and that gave him Faith to believe for the next then a son came in his hand and that gave him the faith that he needed to call that out and brother brother uh FF Bosworth brother Ern Baxter excuse me brother Aaron Baxter saw that operate several times and he began to describe that it was a physical thing that he could see with his own eye when that when that hand that sign would come in brother branham's hand in the very skin of his hand would change sometimes it would bump up and sometimes it would turn color and sometimes it would do different things and brother Brandon was able then to look at his hand and the response of that gift to the vibration of the disease and he began to learn what to call the disease but that wasn't the highest part of the ministry that was getting him ready for what was coming and then there came a time that he was able just to say uh and yes Mr farmer and Faith Works that way you just let God deal with you and some of you know what someone sees an eagle and they get excited about it and I think you should because I think it builds your faith amen I try to celebrate I get you you'd be surprised how many Eagle pictures I get people send me Eagle pictures from all over the world of all kinds of eagles that they've seen and they say look what God did for me brother Shelley and you know what I try to celebrate with every last one of them because if they can come to believe that God has sent that eagle by to encourage them you ought to see us out here sometime when they come Benjamin came to me just last week and he said come out here Daddy it's so far I can't hardly see it but see if it sounds sounds like an eagle to you I believe it's one of the Eagles but he was by himself and I went out and I heard it and I tell you what it was too almost so far away I couldn't see it with my glasses but I could hear him and I come walking down that aisle that hallway a little higher than I was walking before well God made Eagles and you can always see an eel and you don't uh yeah but you know what I see a buzzard it don't build my faith I saw a headless deer out there on the highway today it didn't build my faith I saw them circling around getting ready to make dinner that didn't build my faith but you let me see an eagle oh yes Lord why because I can identify myself my faith allows me to identify myself with that eagle you see I too like you I'm a special built bird though an eagle from the start had to have a change of heart I was living by the nature of Earth's sway but that nature burned and died when Jehovah Eagle cried and I recognized my papa on that day spread your wings come and fly a little Eagle rise to meet our blessed Lord on the wings of great Jehovah through the witness of his word beat your wings and rise to meet him in the sky I hope Jonathan Hollis is singing that with me on the Stream because it was his little short Daddy and I heard sing it the first time he sung two songs I loved and that's that your friend's cousin your what's your name I forget her name Debbie sister Debbie's cousin I'm talking about and he he was about that tall in his country as grits just country just real and he heard a rumor he heard that sister Shelley's grandson had received the message because he his mom and daddy were great friends to my grandparents and he'd heard a rumor and he got Steve Knoll he got uh Jimmy Beach's brother can't think of his name was his name Steve Beach big to drive him because brother Hollis didn't drive and drove him I was off doing something for my granny she was sick she was low and I came home there to bring whatever it was she sent me for and there was this great old big man and and little short tiny man and I didn't know them I'd met them seen them seen brother Hollis but didn't know him and they had brought me this is what what we've had to do for each other then he had brought me a pasteboard box of every VCR testimony ever good service he'd ever been in that he could share a stack of spoken word books and articles and papers and mimeographs anything he thought would encourage me on my new Journey he brought me that box I said brother I'll pay you for this oh he said you couldn't afford you couldn't afford to pay me for what I brought you he said this is a feast for Eagles right here you can't put a price [Applause] granny said Marin there's a an old Gibson guitar behind the couch Steve get the guitar and sing us a song and he's about this tall and the guitar is bigger than he is and he sings if you'll move over just a little bit I'll help you carry your load and I thought little man I don't know who you are but you ain't big enough to carry nothing you can't hardly carry that guitar but something tells me you're a giant you don't look like you can carry a sack of potatoes but what you carry something tells me is a far greater value than being able to win a a schoolyard fight and then he sung that song Sitting on Granny's old brown couch though an eagle from the start God that will let you see that eagle and it it just does something for you it builds your faith sister Jeffrey's having an experience like that I'm not going to tell what it is but something's bringing her a little gift why say it again two times yesterday bringing her little gift just putting it on the railover I'm gonna tell it it don't look like nothing to nobody else she's sitting wrapped it up in the kleenex and sent it to me Tuesday night because we'd already seen it and talked about it why would God bother to send a little animal with someone why would God bother to do something like that because the right kind of a person sees that and they say who am I who am I that God would love me enough to send me a bird it's not who I am it's whose I am [Applause] that starts building your faith and you bring that to church with you when you come and your faith is lifted up and you hear a Tiffany [Applause] [Music] who had an issue [Applause] I'm okay don't call the police I haven't fallen and I can't get up at any of it that's not the problem I sold Charisma magazine where one of the big preachers I can't think was named his iPhone his iWatch or whatever you call these things tries to keep calling the one Sunday they're trying to call and said it fallen and do you need us to send help and they made a big article about it and sent it all around on the internet and I I I wanted to comment and say it happens to me every Sunday he just needs to get a little more stirred up sometime wouldn't shock everybody if he got a little happier every now and then it happens to me two or three times in the service I can't help it it's whose I am I'm not even preaching I'm not even I'm so sorry to you visitors that I'm not even preaching uh this morning I don't know I think I'm just testifying or something I don't know what I'm doing but I want you to know he's a supernatural God I want you to know we limit him with our own our own uh uh non-expectation law low expectation if you if you watch start watching for God's Supernatural in your life and embracing it it will only increase if you'll thank him for every Eagle's siding and everything Lily are you listening to me if you're streaming this service what impresses me sister Rebecca about your sister Lily is every little thing that's what I I encouraged her in the beginning every little thing that God is doing for her she's sending a text I know she don't sin for everything but when she recognizes it she sins and yours your sister Hannah the same way the dog got lost she was concerned about that dog pray for my dog to come home and the next thing you know heard the texts come I said well that ain't cancer being here let me tell you something if you can trust God for the puppy to come home [Applause] if you can let that build your faith [Music] if you can be facing what Lily is facing right now and and some little shift happened and you you send your long distance Pastor a text and said look here what the Lord is doing I Want To Praise Him for every little thing he does I'll just give one example that came to my mind she needed something done to her home and nobody to do it and somebody found out what needed to be done and drove a distance to do it how much do I owe you let me get my money you don't owe me a thing and he told a story about a time that he was he needed help and he didn't know how to fix it and somebody came and helped him and he passed it on and she became the beneficiary of that you might be like Benjamin and Jenna you just need somebody to come and tell you what the switch is for but God will send somebody I want to praise him for that simple we were up there the other day and they had gotten some beautiful wedding pictures framed I said that's the right thing to do some people come in and say oh they got a lot of pictures of themselves in their wedding and whatever else up I said that's not the thing to think about a lot of us bought albums had it all put in albums and we get them out every five years and look at them they don't do us a bit of good if you're going to spend that money you might as well have them to enjoy yourself remember your good day and have somebody else come in and remember it and so they there was one that there was kind of a different shape and they decided Jenna I think had the idea of hanging it there on the over the panel and they no that wouldn't hurt nothing to hang that there and there's a light switch up above up above their light switch way up there and said what's that last one I don't know light switch I don't know what that's for switch it nothing happens yes it does you just gotta know what it is so she's showing her mom and them and their sister Joy showing them about the pictures she takes off and she flips that switch with the picture I think and they go to get hot water they had to call the repairman we was all saying oh I hope it's just an element oh I hope it's just the element won't be one I hope they don't have to replace oh Lord I hope they don't have to replace that hot water heater they didn't have to replace that hot water heater they didn't have to put in a new element they just needed a man to come and tell him what the switch was for eign I took up your time just to tell you that if you don't know if you're like me and you don't know how to fix things and God blesses you that way you can help but praise him [Applause] you've got to learn to see him and then you stop and give him praise and then you bring that Faith with you when you come come on here is uh Luke and Megan and they they're they're gone forever over the holidays and I had a little something come on me Thursday of that last weekend they were gone something come on me and I did not obey the Lord and the only person that knows anything about what I'm going to say is Benjamin and I'm not going to say it but I told him later something came on me and I I felt like I was supposed to do something and I said I can't do that I I can't inconvenience people that way I can't expect or ask or or or even think that somebody would change their plans for me and I wouldn't want to try to have to convince somebody that it was the Lord because sometimes when you do that you start defending and the Lord doesn't want you defending so I I didn't obey the Lord and and some of you be Mighty glad I didn't because you would have been put in a position more than one would have been put into the position whether you trusted me or not so I didn't obey the Lord and then I got a text from them that says we're coming home early we want to be in church on Sunday thank you Lord it was confirmation and I praise the Lord for it and then they get up here and something goes amiss and they're stranded there and they can't make it back the weekend after all and there's nothing like being with all them babies and being stranded like that and depending on whoever will come along and help you that would stress you like that and and I have to say I I did say Lord I don't understand because I truly believe that that was you moving on them whether they know it or not I believe that was you stirring them to be here and then look how circumstances happen but I couldn't blame the devil I'm not a Pentecostal from denomination I couldn't blame the devil that they didn't make it I had to say God you have a sovereign plan I don't know why you didn't bring them all the way but you brought him part of the way and I don't know what you spared them from but you did something Supernatural now I'm saying all that to say this and here they come in this morning and Luke's not a big singer he's not sung any kind of lead like that more than a a half a dozen times or a dozen at the most and he gets up here and they sing that song to us that built up my faith now I said Lord it didn't come like it's just like I thought it would come but it came it didn't turn out just the way I thought but it just began to work on my faith a little more and let me know that if we are listening a supernatural God is talking if we have an ear to hear him I want you musicians to come I'm almost apologizing for this sermon but uh let me read a few things here to you as they're coming the realm of the Supernatural is the realm beyond the reach of science it's the realm Beyond human explanation and here's where we get in big trouble even the angel of the Lord rebuked Brother Branham for trying to explain the supernatural to people who don't have ears to hear Jesus talked about casting pearls Before Swine brother Branham was told not to try to explain that but in his in his effort to want people to get on board and get behind what God was doing he spent a little extra time explaining the way the Lord worked with him and he got royally rebuked for it which encourages me it encourages me that God was watching after him it doesn't make me lose confidence it causes me to have more confidence that God knows how to correct us when we get out of line even with the best of intention there are some things that will never be explained I cannot explain people have said I don't know what you're doing brother Shelley when you are worshiping you're moving your hands and you're making motions and you're I can't explain I don't understand all of the ways that shift that realm I don't understand all the things but I'm not going to criticize others that I don't understand and I'm not going to spend all my time trying to figure out the ways of God I know that one motion one act of obedience yes one song one flag can shift the atmosphere of a room it can usher in a Heavenly Host it can send demon spirits of light that's all I know folks I don't know how to tell you why all I know is I have watched it happen again and again and again and again I don't know why sister Anna Christine pressed in so close she doesn't normally come and stand up close but when I looked down at her and I saw her standing up close like that I knew I cannot explain it but I knew that the Lord had her in that place for a reason I saw sister hope come down the aisle at a particular time and stand right there in the aisle with the little miles I think in her arm but it was at that moment it was the moment she came it was it was at the at the right timing that she came and it struck my heart again that's exactly what she should be doing in this moment don't you come running up here so I'll say that about you that is not what this is about don't you sit there and say I'm up there every service and he don't mention that that's not what I mean to do I wouldn't discourage you or hurt your feelings for nothing in the world I'm just telling you you may be sitting there and you keep feeling that urge to do something and you don't know why you're supposed to do it you can spend the rest of the service trying to figure it out or you can just be like brother Shaw and say hey if he were to sit there and figure out now what does that mean and why why am I going to enter why am I going to say hey if he were to figure that out the urge would leave him in the purpose gone but there are some times when he says that I tell you I feel something riding in on it there are times that someone can say just the right thing in this service and you feel things riding out on it you obey the Lord we're serving a supernatural God we're a supernatural people we're living in a supernatural hour we don't want church as usual I want it to be as unpredictable as possible and still glorify the Lord Hallelujah because we don't ever know what moment he's going to break out and nagging infirmity or whatever it is that has troubled you so long absolutely leave you because your faith has reached a level the realm of the Supernatural is beyond the reach of science it's beyond human explanation it means above and beyond the natural that Supernatural realm is the realm where God operates it is the realm where Heaven and Earth intermingle it is the realm of intersection intersection between God and man when God and man intercept when they have a meeting that meeting is in the realm of the supernatural when you say he touched me he did it by reaching from The Unseen Realm and impacting you in the realm of the natural God wants his children he wants his bride to live and operate from the realm of the supernatural and if we explain ourselves all the time we'll lose the edge of instant obedience I want to be that one that God says jump and I jump somebody said I want to be the one who screams how high I don't if he'd wanted to say JUMP three feet he said jump three feet if the Holy Ghost said jump I just want to jump you understand what I'm saying I'm not trying to make it a gymnastics class here I'm just telling you we want to be that fluid I don't wanna I don't want to disappoint the Lord like I felt like I did that weekend I don't want to miss I'm I'm selfish when it comes to these things I don't want to miss what God has for us and because I love you I don't want you to miss what God has for you and so I'm willing we have to be what he said he met me down at Fort Morgan he said I'm going to make you a a gazing stock I thought well if the Lord said it that sounds good but something about gazing stock don't sound too good looks to me like something people stare at and scratch their head and try to figure out that is not what I'm after Lord and guess what I looked it up and that's pretty much much what it means people will look at you and scratch their head and try to figure out what in the world you are but that's what he came and said well if if I'm if I'm to be that I want to be the best one I don't want them to scratch for a half a minute I want them to keep on trying to figure it out come on now I'm not trying to be silly he wants you and I operating from that realm he wants us to be more familiar with Spirit Realm we got natural round down pat we know how to live in the Physical Realm we need to learn how to exercise the grace and the authority to operate in that Supernatural realm I've done some teaching on that you can find it maybe under exercising your spiritual senses because just like you have natural senses to connect you with your your external environment you've been given internal senses that help you connect to Spirit realm him sounds a little strange to some but it's there and we have to be able to control the mind the will and the emotions to be able to get out of the way enough to let Spirit move as many as are LED are you ready for your song Get Ready be ready as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God I don't know who you are friend but you've posted to come in here and I like it I believe that's a brother stellen I don't know where you're from but he said the message of the hour is Supernatural from the supernatural to the supernatural citizens of the supernatural promise new city I'm with you you can say Supernatural a few more times and I'll still be with you let me close with this Revelation 4 1 says come up hither and I will show you what must take place after now or what must take place after this or what must come here after as the King James says it this was an invitation to the realm of the supernatural brother Branham says this is where we trace the rapture this was this was him coming for his bride John a type of the Bride caught up into a higher place but in context John was caught up into higher place so that he could come and begin to share and spread what he saw what he learned in that Supernatural realm he could bring it to us and we are the beneficiaries of the fact that John got in the spirit we are benefiting because John got in the spirit wives your husband will benefit if you learn how to get in the spirit husbands your wives will benefit if you learn how to move in the realm of the spirit children your parents will benefit if you learn how to yield yourself your life to the spirit of God and children will benefit in the home of parents your relationships will shift as you learn to operate in that realm the supernatural realm is a realm of Consciousness it's a realm of reality it's a realm of power it's a realm of Holiness and Purity it's a realm of beauty and it's a realm where God speaks to us and where we hear him and we depend on him for Grace to be obedient anybody with me let's stand I I would have desired to do better for you but I'm trusting him the old timers used to sing that song when the Lord gets ready you better move I just want to tell you church folks when the Lord gets ready I want to just look at you a minute when the Lord gets ready I was sure glad to have these older children of sister minkels and back here they were gone a long time and uh I might say their presence was missed and I even looked back there today right back in that crowd when worship was going on and Carter was singing he wasn't up here but he was back there and he was singing and I thought you know what that little fellow makes a difference [Music] all right you make a difference when you're where you're supposed to be doing what you're supposed to do do you feel this there's something something brooding bubbling boiling somebody's faith is being stirred and anointing on your faith why don't you just reach your hand up right now and see if the Lord would so anoint your faith that you could just reach up and take it as your own whatever it is that you have need of and Lord I need an answer receive your answer her from the Lord right now I need relief from symptoms and healing in my body receive that right now you serve a supernatural God who wants to impact your life he wants to help you carry that worry he wants to help you carry that burden so that you don't have to worry just let him do that right now let's worship him let's come and see what the Lord will do for us as we enter back into his presence come up here glory be to God glory be to God hallelujah hallelujah Satan hey

very Resurrection the final change for the bride [Music] would you give us qualifying ourselves constantly trying to take ourselves out of your economy and would you drop a revelation down into our hearts today that this is our destiny that's being preached this is our destiny that's being witnessed to be a supernatural demonstration of a supernatural God [Music] one who refuses to see The

Nothing Gonna Steal My Brain hey [Applause] amen thank you [Music] she just wrote that little song and uh was going to sing it this morning and there was no time to for the musicians to run over it but something she said in her text touched me she said I I feel it strong and she said I'll just I would sing it without music if I had to do it and I didn't want us to miss that chance sister shoshana feels that she has a testimony that she should share with us so let's just stay put if you need to sit you can but if not just stay right here brother Shelley has been really strong about not taking up time talking about how that you don't public speak and the Lord's really been using that for me because there was a point in my life where I was absolutely Fearless I'd talk about the Lord to anybody anywhere the Lord had done such a supernatural change in my life when I was 16. and then the Lord allowed me to go through a church situation where a pastor basically any time that I would even share a scripture with him privately he just told me that I was wrong and that I couldn't testify him because I was a woman and it really put a complex on me I guess and I had a friend when the Lord was beginning the process of healing I had a friend look at me and say shashana do you really think the devil would tell you to share scripture yeah or talk about the Lord he said it comes from one of two places he said if you ever feel like you need to come share something with me from the Lord he said you just come share it with me and that really helped in the years that I've spent here have really helped and the Lord's been doing so much for me just privately praise somebody and you'd say that you felt like apologizing for the service this morning brother Shelly you literally said word for a word I was alone in the house yesterday for a while Edith was sleeping and he was outside and I the Lord's just been doing deep and I picked up my phone and I started voice texting my sisters I didn't even share this with Nathan they're the only ones you know either I trust God or I don't yes yes he's either Sovereign or he's not there's no accidents there's not a storm that can touch my life either I keep Covenant with the Lord or I don't I have Bridal Authority or I don't you can't have it two ways and I have the right in my tongue to speak to a storm and say stop and it has to stop and when the enemy is attacking my family I can say stop and he has to stop and it's just been so strong on my heart and then you get up this morning and you just said everything and I just felt such a bubbling up inside of me and I couldn't keep it still I had to share what the Lord has been doing for me for two weeks I couldn't hear out of my left ear and I knew I needed to go get it checked out and I just said Lord I don't want to see a doctor I believe I know what this is about and tonight I want you to open my ear and that night the Lord began to open my ears and while I was standing in church this morning it finished opening and I can hear just fine [Applause] and I just gotta give him praise Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah thank you that you give the victory [Applause] in the early 90s it went around the movement I mean it really went around the movement you you that couldn't be a true message church because they let the ladies testify I appreciate a good testimony David your mother what has a something of scripture I believe they said that she felt the Lord had laid on her heart and I'm I don't mind that either um yesterday God was really dealing with me in my own personal life too and I was taking back ground that the enemy's trying to steal from me for years and so I had even testified to a couple of my sons you know I'm taken back being the Lord I read scripture and it was in the cjb so I have to read it from there because there are some you said in your prayer a little bit ago sparked that and it is so true it was like stop dwelling on past events and brooding over time's gone by I am doing something new it's springing up can't you see it and that was a question can you see it and I could see it just that day I am making a road in the desert rivers in the Wasteland Hallelujah [Applause] I failed to read it in this scripture in the verse that I heard it in the cjb I read the other versions and it just didn't make like this one did for that scripture it just didn't for me I I praise the Lord is that the complete Jewish Bible you're reading your brother Dr Stern oh that's wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful it's Isaiah 43 18-19 wonderful wonderful wonderful God used him God used him he was in our meetings in Jerusalem God used him for that complete Jewish Bible he just went home to be with the Lord just a few months ago now about two months ago but but God really used him he was a Hebrew scholar and he makes that live there are certain places that really that that's so beautiful I don't why don't you read it again yes sir stop dwelling on past events and brooding over time's gone by yes to all of us I am doing something new it's springing up can't you see it such a question I
