[0:00] you are remembering the hand that
[0:03] reached way below the bottom and pulled
[0:06] you out
[0:07] [Music]
[0:13] and he will meet you at the point of
[0:15] your need and he will deliver you with
[0:17] his blood and he will meet you right
[0:20] where you are you don't have to get
[0:22] clean enough or holy enough or good
[0:24] enough he will come right down to the
[0:27] gutter where you are and have fellowship
[0:30] with you
[0:31] but you will have to make the choice to
[0:34] get out of that gutter
[0:37] to quit allowing the life of sin to drag
[0:40] you back to the pit where you once were
[0:42] freedom is a choice and it's going to
[0:44] cost you because it's going to be an
[0:46] everyday affair
[0:49] fighting
[0:50] toe-to-toe with satan
[0:53] fighting for every inch of ground that
[0:55] you take somebody said how do i know
[0:57] it's worth it it's eternal life
[1:01] it's the difference between heaven and
[1:03] hell
[1:06] you've got to make up your mind to fight
[1:08] your way through until you reach that
[1:10] place where these things have no hold on
[1:12] you and they have no pull on you i want
[1:15] to make sure that everyone hears me
[1:16] today i believe there's a place we find
[1:19] in christ
[1:20] where we have total deliverance
[1:24] where we no longer have to fight against
[1:26] the same spirits
[1:28] and the same lies and the same habits
[1:31] we walk out in freedom and we choose to
[1:33] remain in freedom
[1:35] and god strengthens our decision you
[1:37] don't have to make this decision by
[1:39] yourself he will strengthen your
[1:41] decision if you'll lean on him if you
[1:43] ever forget where god brought you from
[1:47] you're in danger of religion
[1:52] when you remember that you don't have to
[1:54] remember the guilt you don't have to
[1:56] remember the condemnation you are
[1:59] remembering the hand that reached way
[2:02] below the bottom and pulled you out
[2:06] you must never forget how far the lord
[2:08] has brought you from
[2:10] [Music]
