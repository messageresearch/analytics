[0:05] the Bible talks about a a situation
[0:09] where our private words could be shouted
[0:12] from the Housetop
[0:13] there's no hiding place
[0:16] so it behooves us as Believers to
[0:19] continually
[0:21] examine our thoughts and our words
[0:25] but understand that he knows and he
[0:28] understands
[0:30] he's not standing with a sledgehammer
[0:32] waiting to crush your skull when you
[0:36] think something you shouldn't think or
[0:37] say something you shouldn't say
[0:40] he didn't come to the Garden of Eden to
[0:42] destroy Adam and Eve he came to cover
[0:45] their nakedness and their nakedness was
[0:48] a result of their rebellious sin
[0:51] is that right it was reasoning that
[0:55] caused the problem in the first place
[0:56] and remember what that reasoning was
[0:59] about it was to place a seed of
[1:02] discrepancy and doubt in Eve's mind that
[1:06] God is ultimately good
[1:09] want you to understand tonight is a part
[1:11] of the bride of Christ that God father
[1:14] your papa your ABBA is ultimately good
[1:19] and he is out to help you to bless you
[1:23] to strengthen you to prosper you we only
[1:27] get in trouble when we walk against his
[1:29] will when we live against his word but
[1:33] the Blessed Place The Sweet Spot in life
[1:36] is walking in obedience to his word and
[1:41] taking advantage of the grace that he
[1:44] gives us to sanctify our thoughts and to
[1:48] arrest and control the words that come
[1:51] out of our mouth I don't believe that
[1:53] words just spill out of their own accord
[1:56] or out of our imagination I believe what
[1:59] the scripture said you can say I didn't
[2:01] mean it you can say I don't mean it but
[2:04] the Bible tells us that what's in the
[2:06] heart is bound to come out
[2:09] out of the abundance of the heart if the
[2:11] heart is filled with hate or bitterness
[2:13] or anger or hurt or woundedness
[2:17] then what what fills our heart is going
[2:20] to spill out of our mouth and we can't
[2:22] exactly say that we don't mean it if
[2:24] we've been nursing that bitterness if
[2:28] we've been nurturing that unforgiveness
[2:31] if we've been petting the wound instead
[2:35] of allowing the Holy Spirit to scrape
[2:37] the scab and pour in the healing bomb
[2:40] and the Salve you're not growing in
[2:43] Christ if you're blaming somebody else
[2:45] you're not growing in Christ if you're
[2:48] blaming somebody else for your situation
[2:50] we are not a bunch of Puppets
[2:54] life is not snatching us around or
[2:57] controlling us there's a loving God who
[3:00] wants to give us victory over every
[3:02] stressful situation in our life and if
[3:05] we can learn the place of worship that
[3:08] David did by by constantly expressing
[3:11] the overwhelming goodness of God you're
[3:14] so good God you are so good you're so
[3:17] good to me you are so faithful to me
[3:21] foreign
