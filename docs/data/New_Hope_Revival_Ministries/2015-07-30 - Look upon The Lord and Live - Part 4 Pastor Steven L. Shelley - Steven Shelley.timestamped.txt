[0:54] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:56] and I want to welcome you to the Eagles
[0:59] cry
[1:00] I am sitting right now in Smith Station
[1:03] Alabama in the sanctuary of the New Hope
[1:06] Revival ministries and it is a real joy
[1:10] to be coming to you wherever you are in
[1:13] the world I know that this program is
[1:16] going across the Nations and that is
[1:18] possible because of the dedicated men
[1:21] and women who serve the Christian
[1:24] Network where you're watching this
[1:25] program let's remember to pray for these
[1:28] networks that God will sustain them and
[1:31] that he will continue to expand them and
[1:35] multiply them so that they can
[1:36] accomplish the vision that the Lord has
[1:39] placed upon their life if you've never
[1:42] taken the opportunity to write us at New
[1:44] Hope Revival ministries the information
[1:47] will be given to you on your screen and
[1:49] we would love to hear where you're
[1:51] watching from and if you have a prayer
[1:54] request it's something that uh I look at
[1:57] Daily I check the prayer request every
[1:59] day and when I go to prayer I take those
[2:02] prayer requests with me and often times
[2:05] we share them with the prayer warriors
[2:07] and the intercessors in our ministry and
[2:09] I can assure you that if you send in a
[2:12] prayer request there's somebody here
[2:13] that's going to lift it up to God now I
[2:16] believe there's power in your prayers
[2:19] but I think that it's a wonderful thing
[2:20] when we can bind together when we can
[2:23] join our faith together and believe God
[2:27] we need to have unshakable faith in this
[2:30] hour what that means is even when we
[2:32] don't see the immediate result of what
[2:34] we've been asking God for of course
[2:36] we're supposed to be praying according
[2:38] to his will and not our own whim or our
[2:41] own desire but we're trying to discover
[2:44] the will of God and the desire of God
[2:46] and pray for that but uh when we don't
[2:49] see the results as fast as we would like
[2:52] to we have to remember that God is
[2:54] Sovereign and he is faithful he knows
[2:57] how to do his business doesn't he uh and
[3:00] if we'll just wait and be patient and uh
[3:03] put our foot on the solid rock and not
[3:05] be shaken and moved by what we see or
[3:08] hear I know the answer will come just
[3:10] hold on uh I I like to to think about
[3:14] the the old song that says joy comes in
[3:17] the morning the darkest hour is just
[3:20] before the dawn and so it may look
[3:23] mighty dark right now in your life and
[3:25] you may wonder how your circumstances
[3:28] could ever be turned around and then
[3:30] Here Comes King Jesus walking on the
[3:33] water and he can change everything he
[3:36] certainly can he is the same yesterday
[3:39] and today and forever he changes not his
[3:43] word is yay and amen he is not a man
[3:47] that he should lie neither the son of
[3:48] man that he should have need to repent
[3:51] if God said it that settles it so you
[3:55] let your faith be settled you let the
[3:57] issue be settled in your life to today
[4:00] and uh we're going to help you pray if
[4:03] you'll send in your prayer request we
[4:05] will and don't forget to give God praise
[4:08] he is worthy to be praised and uh you
[4:11] know we read in the New Testament about
[4:13] the 10 lepers that Jesus cleansed they
[4:17] all were healed they all were set free
[4:19] but only one came back to thank him
[4:22] don't you be like those nine lepers that
[4:25] that got healed but got so excited they
[4:28] ran away and never took the time to be
[4:30] thankful you be like the one leper who
[4:33] came back and bowed before the Lord and
[4:35] thanked him took time to show him his
[4:38] appreciation I believe there's power in
[4:41] prayer and I believe that there's power
[4:43] in Praise I believe that the Bible tells
[4:47] us in everything to give thanks I
[4:49] believe when the Praises go up the
[4:51] blessings of God come down so you be
[4:54] faithful to give God thanks just lift up
[4:56] your hands before him every opportunity
[4:59] that you you have and just give him
[5:00] praise he's worthy he's certainly worthy
[5:04] let's get back to our study for this
[5:05] week but I get excited when I talk about
[5:08] what prayer can do and I get excited
[5:11] when I talk about what praise can do but
[5:13] let's get to our subject for today all
[5:16] right we're talking about uh drawing
[5:21] closer to the Lord we're talking about
[5:23] the veil of Flesh being removed the last
[5:27] time we were together we talked about
[5:28] the fact that just before the children
[5:30] of Israel were crossing the Jordan into
[5:33] the promise that God had prepared for
[5:35] them it was at Harvest Time and the
[5:38] banks of the Jordan had overflowed and
[5:40] we talked about the fact that Jordan
[5:42] River represents flesh and death and
[5:45] that just before you and I begin to
[5:47] cross into to what God has called us to
[5:50] the the the fullness of our destiny in
[5:53] him being fulfilled uh the enemy gets in
[5:56] stirs up the Flesh and we ought to just
[5:59] take take advantage of that instead of
[6:01] letting it overwhelm us and overcome us
[6:04] we ought to just take advantage of that
[6:05] and let God dig in let God cut us free
[6:09] and set us free from some of those
[6:11] things that the enemy is trying to use
[6:14] listen God doesn't want you bound up he
[6:16] wants you to have freedom in him he whom
[6:19] the sun sets free it's not just free but
[6:22] free indeed God wants you to have real
[6:27] freedom to serve him the way your heart
[6:30] desires to serve him the flesh will
[6:34] oppose the flesh will rise up but thanks
[6:38] be to God there's victory in the spirit
[6:41] Romans 8:3 for what the law could not do
[6:45] what the instruction could not do in
[6:47] that it was weak through the flesh
[6:50] anytime man is involved in something
[6:53] it's there's going to be a weakness
[6:54] there when man touches something when
[6:57] man gets involved in something
[7:00] uh it it it weakens whatever that
[7:03] something is and so what the law could
[7:06] not do in that it was weak through the
[7:09] flesh God sending his only son in the
[7:13] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[7:17] condemned sin in the flesh we talked
[7:20] about uh the Flesh and how it's
[7:23] represented by a veil we talked about
[7:26] the veil of the temple being rent in two
[7:30] and uh I wonder sometime when we look at
[7:33] that when that veil was was ripped in
[7:36] two does anybody remember what was
[7:38] embroidered on the
[7:40] veil the Bible tells us that on the veil
[7:44] that protected or that covered the holy
[7:47] of holies there were
[7:49] cherubims that were embroidered on that
[7:52] Veil now where do we where do we see
[7:55] cherubims in the Bible Well we find out
[7:58] that in the the Book of Genesis when
[8:00] Adam and Eve were were driven out when
[8:04] they they were told they had to leave
[8:06] the Garden of Eden the way to the tree
[8:09] of life was guarded by Cherry beams and
[8:13] flaming swords and I find it very very
[8:17] interesting we see these cherubims there
[8:20] guarding the way keeping man from having
[8:25] uh total open access to the Tree of Life
[8:29] because there was something now that had
[8:31] to be protected because a way was going
[8:34] to be provided for man to be able to
[8:37] have access to eternal life or or the
[8:40] tree of life which is the Lord Jesus
[8:42] Christ so I find it very very
[8:45] interesting that when the veil was
[8:47] ripped and the way was opened up to the
[8:51] holy of holies that cherry beams were
[8:54] the very image or the very symbol that
[8:57] were embroidered on the Veil when it was
[8:59] ripped what do you think God was saying
[9:01] I think God was saying what I have
[9:04] guarded and protected and kept man from
[9:07] having open access to uh I have come uh
[9:11] he came God sending his only son in the
[9:14] likeness of sinful flesh to rip the veil
[9:18] to to uh tear aside or to tear away the
[9:24] very thing that God had placed there to
[9:26] keep man out and now the way is made and
[9:30] no Chariot beam and no flaming sword is
[9:34] going to keep you from having access
[9:37] because our great high priest the Lord
[9:40] Jesus Christ has entered within the veil
[9:43] Hebrews 10 tells us and sprinkled his
[9:46] blood there oh Hallelujah and made a way
[9:50] for us to go in unhindered unashamed not
[9:55] in our righteousness don't you
[9:57] misunderstand not because because we're
[9:59] good not because we're holy in ourselves
[10:03] the Bible tells us that all of our
[10:06] righteousness when compared to the
[10:08] righteousness of God is but filthy rags
[10:12] and tables filled with vomit so there
[10:16] that that lets me know right there
[10:17] there's no comparison with my
[10:19] righteousness and God's righteousness
[10:22] but he has imparted he has released his
[10:26] righteousness To Us by the word work
[10:29] that he accomplished on the cross my my
[10:32] my what a work has been accomplished
[10:36] what a way has been made for you and I
[10:40] to enter into the holy of holies now
[10:42] what does that
[10:44] represent it represents full access to
[10:48] God and to the things of God and to the
[10:50] spirit of God so that we can go in and
[10:54] receive
[10:55] Revelation uh
[10:57] impartation what we we need instruction
[11:00] whatever it is that we need to come out
[11:03] you can't live your whole life you can't
[11:05] live always on a mountain you can't
[11:08] always live in by the ark you've got to
[11:10] come out after you've received your
[11:12] impartation and you've got to go do the
[11:15] work that God has called you to do and
[11:17] when you need more when you need another
[11:19] another release Another Touch another
[11:22] taste you go right back in how why how
[11:26] is that possible because the veil is
[11:28] gone
[11:29] because the way has been made because
[11:32] the blood has already been sprinkled on
[11:34] The Mercy Seat the blood of a goat or a
[11:37] lamb or a dove is no longer required in
[11:40] this hour for the purpose of redemption
[11:43] Redemption has been paid for by the
[11:47] Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:51] now if God is made a way for you you
[11:53] must be careful that you don't let the
[11:55] flesh rise up and cause you to be afraid
[11:59] to go in to the things that God has
[12:02] opened up for you you see if you allow
[12:04] fear fear will keep you captive now I
[12:08] believe in Godly reverence and I believe
[12:11] in reverential fear we walk softly
[12:14] before the Living God but that's not the
[12:16] kind of fear I'm talking about I'm
[12:18] talking about how the enemy will raise
[12:21] up fear in our flesh he'll cause us to
[12:24] be afraid to be obedient to what God
[12:26] tells us to do let me tell you something
[12:29] if God leads you to it he's going to
[12:32] bring you through it if God brings you
[12:36] into a situation in your life the grace
[12:39] is already available the grace package
[12:42] has already been made available and
[12:45] released to you to get you through that
[12:47] place regardless of what the opposition
[12:50] is I often tell my church here in
[12:52] Alabama if you think the devil is going
[12:55] to uh roll over and play dead like a dog
[12:58] somewhere while you begin to raise up
[13:03] and move into the stature of a perfect
[13:05] man as an adopted son of God and start
[13:09] calling those things that are not as
[13:10] though they were and speaking with the
[13:12] creative spoken word of God if you think
[13:14] the devil's going to lay over there in
[13:16] the corner and pretend to be dead while
[13:18] you do all that you're
[13:20] wrong he's going to howl he's going to
[13:23] huff and puff he's going to lie he's
[13:26] going to try to accuse you and condemn
[13:28] you and keep you out of what God has for
[13:31] you that dirty dirty devil but he will
[13:34] only be successful in the in the extent
[13:37] or to the extent that you allow him to
[13:40] be and I'm not going to allow the enemy
[13:43] to lie and keep me out uh of what God
[13:47] has called me to do and sometimes that
[13:50] comes in a direct lie and sometimes it
[13:52] comes with a just just a sense of
[13:54] unworthiness that paralyzes you let me
[13:57] tell you let's settle it let's settle
[13:58] this today we're unworthy there's no
[14:01] doubt about it we're unworthy in
[14:04] ourselves we are not worthy but God
[14:07] called us if you feel the spirit of the
[14:10] Lord pulling to you God is calling you
[14:13] and if God is calling you he knows who
[14:15] you are he knows how unworthy you are in
[14:18] your flesh but if God loves you enough
[14:20] to call you you ought to love him enough
[14:23] to surrender to that call step out of
[14:26] that place of of being being paralyzed
[14:29] by your own fear and by your own uh lack
[14:34] of
[14:34] selfworth and I'll just be honest with
[14:37] you in myself I am not worth very much
[14:39] at all but with the help of the Lord I
[14:43] can be more than a conqueror if I yield
[14:47] to the word of God he will take care of
[14:49] it won't he Romans chapter 88:9 but ye
[14:52] are not of the flesh but in the spirit
[14:56] if so be that the spirit of God dwell
[14:58] well in you now if any man have not the
[15:01] spirit of Christ he is none of his if
[15:04] you're born again of the spirit of God
[15:06] then the spirit of Jesus Christ lives
[15:08] inside of you and you are not after the
[15:11] flesh you are not motivated by the
[15:14] things of the flesh but by the things of
[15:16] the spirit now does that make it
[15:18] automatic and the flesh just lays down
[15:20] no the flesh is going to rise up but
[15:24] what we must
[15:25] remember is this is not a battle of
[15:28] Flesh and Blood this is a battle of
[15:30] principalities and powers and spiritual
[15:33] wickedness in high places so what do we
[15:35] do when we know that we're facing
[15:37] something on that level of evil we run
[15:40] to the Lord because he said I have given
[15:43] you power over all the powers of the
[15:46] enemy now we don't take that casually we
[15:49] don't take that lightly we want to stay
[15:51] plugged into to Jesus he said if you
[15:54] abide in me and my words abide in you
[15:57] this is about Abid hiding this is about
[16:00] resting in the secret place and the
[16:04] secret place is not a geographical
[16:06] location it's not your closet somewhere
[16:09] the secret place is a
[16:11] revelation I'm telling you if you're
[16:14] hiding in a secret place with God you're
[16:17] hiding in a revelation something that
[16:19] God has made real to you that the devil
[16:23] can't steal and you don't just receive
[16:26] Revelation from your pastor of of course
[16:28] we do but God wants to make himself
[16:31] known to you as an individual he wants
[16:33] to reveal truth to you if you have a
[16:36] Hungry Heart before God tell him say
[16:39] Lord I'll be quiet sometime I will I
[16:41] will be still I will wait on you and I
[16:45] will position myself to receive
[16:49] Revelation it's a wonderful gift from
[16:52] God look at Galatians chapter 3 I don't
[16:56] have it here so I'll look it up real
[16:58] quick quick but let's let's look at
[17:00] Galatians chapter 3 because it talks
[17:03] about uh uh striving and and I don't I
[17:07] don't believe that it's the will of God
[17:10] for us to have to strive to receive what
[17:14] he has already made available to us as a
[17:17] free gift so let's look at what
[17:19] Galatians chapter 3 says oh foolish
[17:24] Galatians now don't think because that
[17:26] says foolish Galatians that it's nothing
[17:29] to us I think we can find ourselves in
[17:32] these verses who hath Bewitched you or
[17:35] seduced you that you should not obey the
[17:39] truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[17:43] hath been evidently set forth crucified
[17:47] among you this only what I learn of you
[17:51] received ye the Spirit by The Works of
[17:54] the law or by the hearing of Faith are
[17:57] you so foolish having begun in the
[18:01] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[18:05] flesh you know what what this is saying
[18:08] to us quit striving In the Flesh to
[18:11] accomplish what can only be achieved by
[18:15] the spirit of God in other words we
[18:19] sometimes strive to become more lovable
[18:23] or more acceptable to God and listen he
[18:26] didn't accept you uh because you're
[18:29] good-look anyway or because you're smart
[18:33] or because you own a a a business or or
[18:37] because of what cast you're in let me
[18:39] tell you something that's not why God
[18:42] accepted you he accepted you because of
[18:44] the blood of Jesus that's what makes you
[18:47] acceptable in his sight and and
[18:50] sometimes when we get in this rat race
[18:53] of trying to fix
[18:55] ourselves and repair our damage
[18:59] selves it becomes striving it becomes
[19:02] fleshly it becomes our own uh uh
[19:07] motivation instead of letting God do it
[19:10] and God is saying to us through the
[19:11] words of the Apostle Paul if you start
[19:14] in the spirit how did you start out with
[19:16] the Lord you didn't know very much you
[19:19] you were just like a little spiritual
[19:20] baby weren't you but you knew enough to
[19:22] call on Jesus you heard the truth and
[19:25] you knew enough to call on him and he
[19:27] came in and washed you with his blood
[19:30] and he is still in the process to this
[19:33] day I've been a born again believer a
[19:36] long time 38 years or so and uh filled
[19:41] with the Holy Ghost that long and yet I
[19:44] am still being Washed by the Water of
[19:48] the word I am still being tweaked and
[19:51] adjusted or if you want to use the
[19:53] analogy of a musical instrument I'm
[19:56] still being tuned because I can get out
[19:59] of tune you take that guitar over there
[20:01] and you put it out in the element or you
[20:04] let it get too cold or too hot and that
[20:06] those strings will stretch or or
[20:10] contract and uh it will change the tune
[20:14] it'll take that guitar R Out Of Tune and
[20:16] you have to get it out and find the
[20:18] perfect pitch and adjust it and God is
[20:21] still adjusting me to this very day
[20:23] almost 40 Years Later by his word and
[20:27] you know what that's good news well
[20:29] don't you feel ashamed that you hadn't
[20:31] got it right yet I may never get it
[20:34] right in my flesh but I have somebody
[20:36] with me who loves me so much that he
[20:40] corrects me from his word he washes Me
[20:43] by his word he directs Me by his word he
[20:48] feeds me by his word he he strengthens
[20:52] me he balances Me by his word sometimes
[20:56] I could get in a big old m mess if it
[20:59] wasn't for the word of God directing me
[21:02] and leading me that's the goodness of
[21:04] God so quit striving In the Flesh to
[21:06] accomplish what can only be achieved in
[21:08] the spirit now I can speak to ministers
[21:11] also and I can tell you that if God gave
[21:14] you a vision for Ministry if God showed
[21:17] you something that you were supposed to
[21:19] do and you started out doing it by being
[21:22] led by the spirit what makes you think
[21:25] that you're going to be able to finish
[21:27] that VIs Vision or to complete that task
[21:31] by striving or by working with your
[21:34] hands or by doing it in your own ability
[21:37] or your own
[21:38] strength it will never happen that way
[21:42] if something starts out in the spirit
[21:44] it's going to be finished in the spirit
[21:46] I can say about the Church of America
[21:49] that it was by the spirit that God used
[21:51] to draw people to the house of God we
[21:54] didn't have any gimmicks we didn't have
[21:56] any contests we we didn't have a coffee
[21:59] shop we didn't have uh Seeker sensitive
[22:03] uh uh thoughts and programs and and a
[22:06] program for this and a pro we didn't
[22:08] have all of that in the day old days uh
[22:11] when I was just a boy in Pentecost we
[22:13] just had the spirit of the Lord and we
[22:16] depended on God now we invited people to
[22:18] church and they wanted to come because
[22:21] they saw a difference in our lives they
[22:23] saw what what God was doing among the
[22:25] people in the church and when they I I
[22:28] mean drug addicts delivered and
[22:29] alcoholics delivered and and and and and
[22:32] when they saw what God was doing in
[22:34] their life they wanted to come and see
[22:35] what it was all about today the church
[22:39] has began to think that we can do it in
[22:42] our own intelligence that we can set up
[22:45] some programs or make everybody
[22:47] comfortable or tell people you can come
[22:49] in your in your pajamas or however you
[22:52] know you don't have to dress up just
[22:54] just come like you are we we we've
[22:56] thought of all kinds of things that we
[22:58] could say to make people want to come
[23:01] something is wrong we're behaving like
[23:04] the foolish Galatians we're trying to
[23:06] finish something in the flesh that was
[23:10] started in the spirit it works on the
[23:12] corporate level and it works on the
[23:14] individual level I just feel like I'm
[23:16] speaking to somebody right now I mean
[23:18] I'm speaking to somebody specific right
[23:21] now and God wants to call you back to
[23:24] your roots and God wants to say to you
[23:27] you will never ever accomplish in the
[23:29] flesh what the what the will of the
[23:32] spirit is calling for you'll never
[23:35] please the spirit of God or please God
[23:38] by The Works of your hands now that
[23:40] doesn't mean that we don't have to labor
[23:42] we labor but we labor knowing that it is
[23:45] not up to what we do that the Harvest is
[23:50] going to be brought in the Harvest is a
[23:52] supernatural Harvest we make ourselves
[23:55] available we're willing to do whatever
[23:57] God tells us to do that's still Spirit
[24:00] work if God tells you to go to the
[24:03] farthest reaches of a n that's still the
[24:05] spirit work you have to work hard at
[24:08] doing it I'm not saying that there's not
[24:10] physical difficulty and sacrifice that
[24:12] we make and that we don't work at all
[24:14] with our hands of course we do but it's
[24:17] it's by obeying what the spirit calls us
[24:20] to do not by sitting around trying to
[24:23] think of good
[24:24] ideas if we sit around and try to come
[24:27] up with a good idea uh to serve the Lord
[24:30] and to work for God what's that going to
[24:32] be it's going to be a a product of our
[24:35] mind uh not of the spirit this is what
[24:38] happened to Abraham God said I'm going
[24:41] to give you a son by Sarah what did
[24:43] Abraham say I'm going to help you out a
[24:45] little bit Lord doesn't look like
[24:46] Sarah's ever going to give me a child
[24:48] I'll just take Hagar and and I'll get a
[24:51] child that way and so it was what was
[24:55] Ishmael then Ishmael was a product of
[25:00] Abraham's thoughts his mind his
[25:04] ideas not necessarily a product of the
[25:08] perfect and divine will of God now did
[25:11] God make a plan for Ishmael yes did God
[25:14] know what was going to happen in his
[25:16] sovereignty yes but it doesn't change
[25:19] the fact that this whole uh idea was
[25:23] something that Abraham thought not
[25:27] necessar something that God inspired now
[25:31] we want to be careful that when we start
[25:33] out to do something for the Lord that
[25:35] we're moving in the spirit I feel
[25:38] something on this today I know this is
[25:41] not a message for every person perhaps
[25:44] watching this program but I'm happy if
[25:46] God wants to use this little section to
[25:49] speak to one person I'm happy I'm happy
[25:52] about that let's pray father you see
[25:54] Lord whoever is watching this program
[25:57] that needs this this word today give
[25:59] them strength to lay still and let the
[26:03] spirit of God be renewed in them so that
[26:06] they can move forward in the spirit not
[26:10] trying to accomplish and finish things
[26:13] in the flesh that were started in the
[26:17] spirit if it's started by the Holy Ghost
[26:19] and Lord I'm counting on you to help us
[26:22] finish it by the Holy Ghost break
[26:25] whatever it is that the enemy is using
[26:27] using against the Servants of the Lord
[26:30] to get them caught up in that in that
[26:33] cycle of trying to do it in their own
[26:36] strength the joy of the Lord is our
[26:39] strength father fill the believer with
