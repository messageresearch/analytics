[36:36] back into the beginning and God I mean
[36:39] Jesus was what God was is that right
[36:43] Jesus is the product of what God was in

[37:07] to believe he meant to give and give and
[37:10] serve and serve is that right that was
[37:14] his character amen hallelujah
[37:16] and we think about that they meant how
[37:18] he that was his choice he could have
[37:21] done anything he could have chosen
[37:23] anything that he wanted to but he chose
[37:26] to redeem he chose amen to come down is
[37:32] that right Amen from his glory to the

[37:41] be born he's right beside the the manure
[37:45] pile and they're a mean in the most
[37:48] humblest place there was that was his
[37:51] choice and I did not think about his
[37:54] choice and our choice here tonight
[37:56] Church our choice is too it's too high
[37:59] it's too great amen
[38:02] compared to God amen
[38:05] we look for the best things you know

[39:25] or you choose to believe it I believe we
[39:30] ought to say tonight I choose to believe

[41:03] that was his character he may he made
[41:06] this earth I mean when you see the trees

[41:11] rivers that's his character and then

[41:29] men to die not for men to be sick not
[41:33] man to have heartache or worry it wasn't
[41:36] in his intentions is that right but he
[41:40] says God had a better way provided for
[41:42] us amen provided for us amen he said
[41:47] Paul speaking here thinking not robbery

[43:57] maybe when all of those men that were
[44:00] standing at the foot of Jesus really
[44:02] realized what was taking place they
[44:05] probably had in their mind that this is
[44:07] a murder this is this is murder took our
[44:11] friend and killed him hey man I know
[44:13] that they didn't have the revelation
[44:14] that was him dying for their sins is
[44:18] that right I mean I really don't think
[44:20] that they got that realization till
[44:22] after it was over with but after it was
[44:25] over with they got up there in an upper
[44:27] room oh praise the Lord after it

[44:42] their hopes was that they left their
[44:43] jobs for they had left everything for
[44:46] their families everything it was intense
[44:48] because they thought everything was
[44:51] between him but church he was just
[44:53] becoming a beginning it was just
[44:55] becoming a big guinea what God's plan
[44:58] was fixed to take place his intentions
[45:02] was him to become in our hearts and
[45:05] doing the same works that Christ was no
[45:09] Church we can't put all the weight on
[45:10] brother Isaiah we can't put all the
[45:12] weight on brother Steve here we can't
[45:15] put on the wall all the weight on one
[45:17] person it's all of us in one Accord one
[45:20] night Amen believing that whatever God
[45:23] says just do the word just speak sisters
[45:28] we you can speak the word young brothers
[45:31] you can speak the word hey man
[45:34] it's got to do with our choices is that
[45:37] right amen
[45:39] I want to take God had a choice hey man
[45:42] and he just didn't choose for anything
[45:45] look what is his choice was he said
[45:47] there must be something to save this
[45:49] creation and nothing could save it
[45:51] because the high specie of his creation
[45:54] had fallen everything under it fell with
[45:57] it because it fell there's only one
[46:00] thing left that did not fall and that
[46:05] was God oh he didn't leave us here to
[46:11] die
[46:12] he said so something of the heavens had
[46:14] to come down to redeem this creation
[46:16] because there was nothing here that
[46:19] could create it and God's own love for
[46:22] the world created the character
[46:24] expressed in Christ Church that is why
[46:28] we're here tonight cause of God's own
[46:31] love God's choice God's character is why
[46:36] every one of us are here amen he said it
[46:40] was God expressed image in him was God
[46:43] God in Christ revealing himself to the
[46:47] world and no love could ever be greater
[46:50] than that love such a person a man would
[46:54] become what he did in order to redeem
[46:57] what had been lost
[46:58] he said that order said us our heart so
[47:01] in love with Christ
[47:02] that order stirs a man holiday to see
[47:06] what a condition that we have fallen
[47:08] into God projecting himself to make a
[47:10] plan of redemption this was done so that
[47:14] the penalty could be paid the penalty
[47:17] was death and 100 the sentence of death
[47:20] could not pay the penalty for the next
[47:22] one under the sentence of death so there
[47:26] had to be somebody who was free from
[47:29] death in order to pay the penalty amen
[47:33] the infant Jehovah crying in a manger
[47:37] could you imagine it yard alarmed the
[47:41] hearts of the believers
[47:42] could you imagine Jehovah being a baby
[47:46] amen could you imagine a little Jehovah
[47:49] plane as a boy he meant him as a
[47:51] teenager that was his choice praise the
[47:56] Lord I mean you know what it was like as
[47:58] a teenager
[47:59] confused I mean all kinds of emotions
[48:03] going everywhere
[48:04] Jesus had those but he chose to go
[48:06] through that time so he could say I've
[48:09] been there is that right he chose that
[48:12] praise the Lord he said could you
[48:15] imagine him as a teenager or in a
[48:17] carpenter's shop and could you imagine
[48:19] you such complete obedience to God Amen
[48:22] dying on a cross to redeem his fallen
[48:25] creation that's the kind of love that
[48:27] God had he had to become that in order
[48:30] to die to hold the sting of death Oh
[48:34] church hey man that's why we're here
[48:37] tonight he said think about it he said
[48:41] his character projected that lovely
[48:44] person no woman could bring that
[48:47] character amen Moses's mother couldn't
[48:50] bring it I mean he says none of them
[48:54] could produce this kind of character
[48:55] because it would come through sex by
[48:58] falling people but God projected his own
[49:01] body his dwelling place he meant cuz
[49:05] nothing else could project it but his
[49:08] own divine character projected this
[49:11] tabernacle
[49:12] hey man is I right amen so many times
[49:18] people judge people by the way they
[49:21] dress or their statue the man is not
[49:25] judged by how big he is or how strong
[49:28] his muscles are man's judged by
[49:31] character and character alone hey man
[49:35] it's all right man is judged by
[49:37] character what is in his heart a man a
[49:40] man he said there's no way that you
[49:43] could ever produce a character like that
[49:45] the character that God had you wouldn't
[49:50] have done it
[49:51] I wouldn't chose to done that none of us
[49:54] would have chose that that character
[49:56] wasn't handed down to us a man through
[49:59] our birth praise the Lord
[50:02] it wasn't even in us to think of one
[50:04] another like that is that right amen and
[50:07] we're Christians are we barely have one
[50:09] another today we barely think of another
[50:13] one we barely saw one another where
[50:15] we're at today much less if we was the
[50:18] board is sin and having that character
[50:20] we would have never done it praise the
[50:27] Lord it's like that song I don't know if
[50:29] you've ever heard it brother I was a the
[50:31] bad girl down the street
[50:36] mmm amen

[51:00] they said the bad girl down the street
[51:03] you know church man
[51:05] God has sprayed this earth with his
[51:07] blood he sprayed his earth with blood
[51:12] and every person that's walking around
[51:14] outside these doors
[51:16] amen has an opportunity has an
[51:19] opportunity to this word like we have it
[51:22] we should never get to the place that
[51:24] our noses up in the air
[51:26] Amen thinking they don't have a chance
[51:28] at it o Church whereas our character
[51:31] that we're wanting to see the walls
[51:33] redeem we're wanting to see this great
[51:36] gift handed down to others oh praise the
[51:40] Lord Church
[51:41] I mean God was looking at us like that
[51:44] Amen hallelujah we know enough of this
[51:47] message to realize Amen well is it for
[51:50] the blood I mean what would we look like
[51:54] everything that we ever done for my
[51:56] birth will be standing staring at God in
[51:58] the face maybe he needs to bring us
[52:01] behind the door sometimes Amen he says
[52:05] look here he says Jesus on his way up
[52:08] he said the devil always doubted that
[52:11] being any more than a prophet
[52:13] he didn't believe he was Immanuel God
[52:16] manifested in his own son he couldn't
[52:19] see that how could God the Great Creator
[52:22] ever stand there and let somebody pull
[52:26] his beard let somebody smite him in the
[52:31] face let somebody spit on him I'm
[52:35] talking about the God chose this
[52:39] character to let somebody spit in his
[52:44] face
[52:45] right I mean that was his character
[52:48] cough hey man hallelujah and we see that
[52:52] Amen is there jerking his beard and
[52:55] bloods pouring through I mean they
[52:57] placed that crown of thorns on his head
[52:59] I mean the devil standing there says
[53:02] this is no way could be the Son of God
[53:04] no way would he let them do that to him
[53:08] oh it was throwing the devil for a loop
[53:11] Church that God was letting them do that
[53:14] to him all brother sisters a felony
[53:17] already speaking to us that's the kind
[53:20] of character that God wants us to have
[53:23] hmm raised the Lord he never opened his
[53:29] mouth now you that's sittin here tonight
[53:33] that's going through these trials and
[53:35] through these Amen intense moments this
[53:40] is speaking to you here tonight while
[53:44] he's speaking those things last night I
[53:46] was thinking about the this here tonight
[53:48] the character of God hey meant that we
[53:52] don't fight amen amen we don't fuss back
[53:56] praising Allah we don't try to prove
[53:58] ourselves is that right God didn't try
[54:01] to prove himself he didn't fight back
[54:04] he didn't fuss back is that right he
[54:07] knew who he was and you know who you are
[54:10] and you know where you're standing a
[54:13] manhunt solid ground you're standing on
[54:16] the word Amen but don't let the devil
[54:18] try to prove you make you prove to him
[54:21] you don't have to do that that's what
[54:25] the devil wants us to do to try to prove
[54:27] to him O God didn't prove to the devil
[54:30] nothing he just said it is written say
[54:33] that it is written hey man it's all we
[54:38] got to do is believe who we are amen I
[54:42] just choose to believe Who I am
[54:46] amen
[54:51] he said the devil says that can't be the
[54:54] Son of God it just can't be he wouldn't
[54:57] put up with that but sons of God put up
[55:00] with anything as long as they are know
[55:03] they're doing the will of God and that's
[55:06] what he come to do criticism well now we
[55:11] with our message can we stand by the
[55:13] looking glass of God's Word and see
[55:15] Christ reflect in our own lives then can
[55:18] we bear such and reproach the message
[55:21] that we're standing for here someone can
[55:24] say something about it and yet you just
[55:25] don't open your mouth and say nothing
[55:27] about it he was an example because God
[55:30] was reflecting his character in him and
[55:32] then if we're sons and daughters of God
[55:35] we reflect his character in us then we
[55:39] become like him
[55:41] that's our heart's desire is to be like
[55:45] him is that right
[55:48] Emma Church amen you have a choice to be
[55:50] like anybody in this earth and then the
[55:54] internet is full of patterns I mean full

[56:03] heroes and you can patter your life off
[56:06] of that I mean you've got a choice to do
[56:08] that amen but there's a choice that you

[56:20] are something that's affected my life
[56:22] that I choose to believe that's what I
[56:25] want to be like amen
[56:27] praise the Lord Amen I pray that we're
[56:32] interested in that character amen

[56:51] workshop you know Satan's got a workshop
