[3:11] sons and I from a wonderful convention
[3:15] in Nakuru Kenya Africa where God is
[3:19] moving I mean to tell you we saw some
[3:22] wonderful things taking place and there
[3:25] was one night when the atmosphere of the
[3:28] Lord was so strong and miracles were
[3:31] announced and not only were they being
[3:34] announced but they were being received
[3:36] and we have continued to receive
[3:39] testimonies of lives that were touched
[3:42] and bodies that were healed and all of
[3:45] this just continues to confirm for us
[3:48] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[3:52] and today and forever and we want to
[3:57] stay connected with you and that's why
[3:58] we make all of these different social

[4:17] one then go to youtube and you can watch
[4:21] it on your computer or on your handheld
[4:24] device and iPad or a smartphone or
[4:26] whatever you have and I think you'll
[4:30] enjoy following the progress of what of
[4:33] what we're trying to lay out for you
[4:35] today is episode 4 and I want to start
[4:39] again by reading what I would call the
[4:42] foundational scripture for this series
[4:44] and the the portion of Scripture where
[4:47] we took the title it is Galatians
[4:51] chapter 4 and the first seven verses and
[4:54] I'm going to read them again because I
[4:57] just like to lay that foundation each
[5:00] time we meet together now I say that the
[5:04] air as long as he is a child differeth
[5:07] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[5:10] of all but is under tutors and governors
[5:14] until the time appointed of the Father
[5:18] see there's that process of
[5:21] growing of learning and of maturing even
[5:25] so we when we were children were in
[5:28] bondage under the elements of the world
[5:31] but when the fullness of the time was
[5:35] come when everything let me just say
[5:38] when everything was in order everything
[5:41] was lined up in God's blueprint in his
[5:45] beautiful design God sent forth his son
[5:49] made of a woman made under the law to
[5:54] redeem them that were under the law that
[5:57] we might receive the adoption of sons
[6:02] and because ye are sons God hath sent
[6:07] forth the spirit of his son into your
[6:10] hearts crying Abba Father that is the
[6:15] witness we have because we are the sons
[6:19] of God we have the Spirit of the Son of
[6:22] God the Holy Spirit in our lives and
[6:26] that witnesses to our relationship with
[6:31] the father and so we can cry Papa you
[6:35] know we approach him and we want to set
[6:39] his name apart and we want to hallow his
[6:42] name and and we want him to know that we
[6:46] recognize his deity and his sovereignty
[6:49] but I want you to know there are times
[6:51] in our life when we just need our daddy
[6:54] we just need a Papa and that's what the
[6:57] scripture is saying as we grow in
[7:00] maturity there's a witness that comes in
[7:03] our spirit where when we need to we can
[7:05] just cry Papa Abba Father and he hears
[7:10] us wherefore thou art no more a servant
[7:13] but a son and if a son then an heir of
[7:19] God through Christ what a beautiful work
[7:23] the Holy Spirit of God is accomplishing
[7:28] in the life of the believer now in this
[7:31] series we have been
[7:32] laying out for you that the great
[7:35] designer the Great Architect of the ages
[7:40] had a blueprint in his mind a pattern a
[7:45] plan from before the foundation of the
[7:48] world and although this plan of
[7:52] redemption was in his mind in fact we
[7:55] read that the lamb was slain we read in
[7:58] Revelation 13 and eight last time we
[8:00] were together that the lamb was slain
[8:03] from the foundation of the world all of
[8:06] this took place in the mind and in the
[8:08] thoughts of God it was some four
[8:10] thousand years later that that first
[8:14] messianic prophecy that was given it was
[8:17] spoken to the serpent but it was a word
[8:21] for Adam to hold on to and I'm going to
[8:24] read that again because that's where
[8:26] we're going to move forward from today
[8:28] but it was four thousand years after
[8:31] this first initial promise of a messiah
[8:35] of a savior to come that it actually
[8:39] happened that the word actually became
[8:42] flesh and it could not happen one minute
[8:45] early or one minute late everything had
[8:49] to be according to God's plan and design
[8:53] I believe the Great Creator was watching
[8:57] carefully over the earth to see every
[9:01] detail falling into place and in that
[9:04] moment the Word of God stepped out of
[9:08] eternity into a body of flesh formed in
[9:13] the womb of a little virgin maiden and
[9:16] we're going to talk about that in this
[9:18] program today before we do that let's
[9:21] read Genesis three 14 and 15 often
[9:26] referred to in theology as the first
[9:28] messianic prophecy of recorded in the
[9:32] scripture verse 14 and the Lord God said
[9:35] unto the serpent because thou hast done
[9:39] this thou art cursed above all cattle
[9:42] and above every
[9:44] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[9:48] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[9:51] days of thy life verse 15 and I will put
[9:57] enmity between thee and the woman and
[10:01] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[10:07] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[10:11] his heel this is a promise of God
[10:17] sending an answer to the problem of sin
[10:23] God sending a remedy for what had just
[10:27] taken place in the Garden of Eden and
[10:30] God specifically said this answer this
[10:35] remedy this provided way would come
[10:39] through the seed of a woman and even
[10:44] though this seed of the serpent that
[10:47] representation of evil would be able to
[10:50] bruise the heel of this Promised One and
[10:54] we believe that's the death of the cross
[10:56] but ultimately the final bruise would be
[11:01] the crushing of that evil underneath the
[11:05] heel of this promised seed of a woman
[11:09] indeed he was the seed of God but he
[11:13] came in an unusual and unprecedented way
[11:17] a new thing was accomplished in the
[11:20] earth as the Scriptures teach us and
[11:23] we're going to look at some of those
[11:25] scriptures in a moment it's important to
[11:27] remember that the answer for the sin
[11:30] problem on planet earth could only come
[11:34] through a sinless son of man full
[11:37] atonement could not be made in any other
[11:40] way than one who was completely perfect
[11:44] and sinless and in order for us to know
[11:48] that that was the promise we have this
[11:51] beautiful system
[11:54] given designed by God in the older
[11:57] covenant in the Old Testament to show us
[12:00] the importance of the offering and the
[12:04] sacrifice being whole being without
[12:07] blemish the worshiper was coming broken
[12:12] with trespasses with sins with with
[12:17] shortcomings but the offering that he
[12:20] brought had to be a perfect offering
[12:23] without any malady without any
[12:26] shortcoming it had to be to the full
[12:29] measure of perfection that was available
[12:32] and this is a beautiful type for you and
[12:35] I because when we come to the Lord we
[12:38] know that we are unworthy but remember
[12:41] we're not coming in our worthiness we're
[12:44] not coming to God to worship under the
[12:47] pretense that we are sinless or perfect
[12:51] or that we should be received because of
[12:54] our own works or deeds or perfection but
[13:00] we can come to him boldly even though we
[13:04] feel like we have fallen short many many
[13:07] times we can come to him boldly and with
[13:11] sincerity because we're bringing a
[13:14] perfect lamb we're bringing the offering
[13:17] the sacrifice of the blood of the
[13:20] spotless Lamb of God the one that john
[13:24] said was slain before the foundation of
[13:28] the world so you and I may not be worthy
[13:32] in our fallen condition but thanks be to
[13:35] God my lamb is worthy my offering is
[13:39] worthy I come by the blood of the
[13:43] sinless Lamb of God in Hebrews chapter 9
[13:47] and verse 22 in the amplified version of
[13:51] the Bible it reads in fact under the law
[13:54] almost everything is purified by means
[13:59] of blood and without the shedding of
[14:02] blood there is neither release from sin
[14:06] and it's guilt nor the remission of the
[14:11] do and merited punishment for sins the
[14:14] scripture is clear both New Testament
[14:18] and Old Testament that the the remission
[14:21] of sin and the covering the atonement
[14:25] for sin could only be accomplished by
[14:28] the shedding of blood and this is
[14:31] important to notice because from the
[14:35] beginning God was speaking of this in
[14:39] Genesis chapter 3 and verse 21 Eve has
[14:45] listened to the serpent
[14:47] she has yielded herself to his seduction
[14:52] she has opened up a new world in her own
[14:57] mind Adam the Bible tells us in the New
[15:00] Testament was not deceived when he saw
[15:03] what Eve had done he also / to cover the
[15:07] sin as a mediator the scripture is clear
[15:11] as a covering for for Eve because of his
[15:15] great love for her so though Adam in
[15:18] that moment was innocent until he
[15:21] partook he knew what he was doing he was
[15:25] not deceived the scripture said he was
[15:28] becoming a type of the last Adam our
[15:32] Lord Jesus Christ Oh My look at
[15:35] Redemption that scarlet thread of
[15:38] redemption that runs through Genesis all
[15:41] the way through the book of Revelation
[15:43] and in indeed indeed it runs throughout
[15:46] all eternity but in Genesis 3:21 the
[15:50] fall has taken place and Adam and Eve
[15:53] have tried to cover their sin and this
[15:56] is a problem that started in the Garden
[16:00] of Eden and continues to this day
[16:02] man's desire to hide himself and so they
[16:07] sewed together somehow fig leaves from
[16:12] off the fig tree and they covered their
[16:15] their private parts and
[16:18] they went on about their their way and
[16:20] as God was coming down in the cool of
[16:24] the day prior to this every day to have
[16:28] fellowship with Adam in the cool of the
[16:30] evening the Bible said here comes God
[16:32] and he's calling to Adam because Adam is
[16:36] not in his usual meeting place
[16:39] why because Adam and Eve are hiding in
[16:42] the bushes somewhere even though they've
[16:44] covered themselves with fig leaves they
[16:47] are very much aware of their nakedness
[16:50] they were naked from the beginning of
[16:53] course they had the covering of the
[16:55] light and the glory of God
[16:58] they had never looked at themselves with
[17:00] any shame or feeling any any guilt for
[17:05] not being covered the glory of God was
[17:07] there covering and they were not aware
[17:09] that beneath that covering they were
[17:12] indeed naked but with the fall things so
[17:16] drastically changed they are now naked
[17:19] and they are ashamed of their condition
[17:21] and even though they have covered
[17:23] themselves with fig leaves they're
[17:26] hiding from the voice of God they heard
[17:29] the voice of God walking in the garden
[17:31] and crying out Adam where are you where
[17:35] art thou and you know the story very
[17:38] well Adam and Eve were hiding because
[17:41] they were ashamed of their condition and
[17:44] they were sure that God had come to
[17:49] judge them that God had perhaps even
[17:52] come to destroy them but folks I want to
[17:56] tell you something this is a religious
[17:58] image of God this is not understanding
[18:03] the true nature of the Living God I want
[18:07] you to know that he was not indeed
[18:10] coming to judge them or to destroy them
[18:13] in every way God was coming to protect
[18:17] them it's true that because of their sin
[18:22] they could no longer live in the Garden
[18:25] of Eden but this was for their
[18:27] protection because the way
[18:30] to the tree of life had to be guarded if
[18:33] if there was any taking of the Tree of
[18:37] Life and and experiencing experimenting
[18:43] with eternal life in an illegal way
[18:46] without the death the blood of the Lord
[18:50] Jesus Christ this could have been a
[18:53] terrible situation in the garden and so
[18:56] from the time of the fall Adam and Eve
[18:59] had to be expelled from the garden and
[19:01] we know that there was a flaming sword
[19:04] and cherubim were placed at the entrance
[19:09] guarding the way to the Tree of Life
[19:13] making sure that no one would access
[19:17] eternal life by the tree in any other
[19:20] way then through the death the blood of
[19:23] the Lord Jesus Christ which wouldn't
[19:26] take place it had happened in the mind
[19:28] of God but it would not happen in
[19:31] actuality in reality in the earth realm
[19:33] for another four thousand years God had
[19:37] come to protect them in fact he had come
[19:41] to cover them not to expose their
[19:44] nakedness not to shame them for what had
[19:48] happened in the garden remember after
[19:50] all this didn't catch God by surprise no
[19:53] sir I know that church is sort of teach
[19:56] this I've been in services where people
[19:59] were teaching that you know here this
[20:01] happens God created Adam and Eve perfect
[20:04] and whole and and this is how it was
[20:07] supposed to be forever and and Here Come
[20:10] Satan and he entered into the serpent
[20:13] and he he spoiled God's plan and now God
[20:17] had to find a way of bringing it but I
[20:19] want you to know nothing nothing nothing
[20:23] nothing nothing has ever caught God by
[20:27] surprise we have well established in our
[20:31] last three sessions together the the
[20:33] sovereignty the all knowingness of God
[20:38] how he knew
[20:40] from the beginning all of his works he
[20:43] not only knew what you and I were gonna
[20:45] do from the beginning he knew what he
[20:47] was going to do everything that God was
[20:50] going to do in the earth was already
[20:53] determined before he ever started this
[20:58] whole creation or recreation process
[21:02] that we read about in in Genesis and so
[21:06] it's important to know that God was
[21:08] coming not to destroy but to cover in
[21:13] Genesis 3:21 unto Adam also and to his
[21:17] wife did the Lord God make coats of skin
[21:22] what did Adam and Eve do they did the
[21:25] best they could think of
[21:26] they put fig leaves together to make
[21:29] themselves some clothes and God said
[21:31] this is not a proper covering for your
[21:35] nakedness just leaves off the tree there
[21:39] will be listen now there will be a
[21:43] provided way to cover nakedness and
[21:47] shame there will be a provided way to
[21:52] cover the sinfulness of man and it won't
[21:56] be by fig leaves it won't be by botany
[22:00] the shedding of a botany life you know
[22:03] the taking of botany life plucking these
[22:06] leaves off the tree but rather the
[22:09] covering would be made by the shedding
[22:13] of blood this was God's plan from the
[22:17] beginning not just because of all the
[22:20] lambs that would be sacrificed in the
[22:23] tabernacle and later in the temple but
[22:26] ultimately it was pointing even farther
[22:28] than that it was planning to a hill
[22:32] outside the city of Jerusalem where our
[22:36] Lord Jesus Christ would suffer without
[22:38] the camp and who would ultimately shed
[22:41] the blood of God the blood created by
[22:46] God for the plan of redemption and so we
[22:49] read here in Genesis 3:21 that God had a
[22:53] better
[22:53] idea than Adam Adam his idea Eve's idea
[22:58] figleaves God said I've got a better
[23:01] plan now I just want you to know that
[23:03] that's a lesson that you can you can
[23:05] hold on to no matter what your idea is
[23:08] to get yourself out of a mess
[23:11] God has a better plan he thinks higher
[23:14] than we do his thoughts toward us are
[23:17] right and if we will just take the time
[23:20] to discover what does God think what is
[23:24] God's will in this situation how can I
[23:28] get out of this mess that I've gotten
[23:30] myself into Lord show me the way and the
[23:34] way is outlined the way is outlined in
[23:38] the written record of God's Word the
[23:41] holy scripture the Bible it's there we
[23:44] just have to wait patiently some time to
[23:48] discover that way so you can put your
[23:50] your fig leaves away you know that to me
[23:53] that is a type of religion it's a type
[23:56] of man trying to fix himself you can't
[23:59] do all of this through self-help I
[24:02] believe I believe that there are a lot
[24:05] of things that we can do for ourselves
[24:07] and there are changes that we can make
[24:10] in our life by the way we think by
[24:12] changing our thoughts by what we confess
[24:15] by what we speak by what we declare by
[24:18] what we prophesy but I want you to know
[24:21] that all the self-help advice you can
[24:25] read and listen to and all the seminars
[24:28] you can attend they can help you in many
[24:30] ways but I want you to know that real
[24:33] help real wholeness real completeness
[24:38] and true Redemption
[24:40] can only come by discovering God's way
[24:43] out
[24:43] how would you lord have me to manuever
[24:47] how what what road should I take down
[24:50] and and maybe I can't undo or reverse
[24:53] everything that I have done wrong but
[24:56] show me how to get the most redemption
[24:59] for the mess for the sin for the
[25:02] mistakes that I have made and the god I
[25:04] serve is faithful
[25:06] and he will help you in that manner if
[25:08] you'll trust him and here God was
[25:10] showing Adam I got a plan okay
[25:13] your little fig leaves that just didn't
[25:14] get it done but I've got a plan and unto
[25:18] Adam also into his wife did the Lord God
[25:21] make cotan God God became a tailor made
[25:28] coats of skins and clothed them so no
[25:34] doubt in my mind God took some small
[25:39] fluffy furry animal most likely a lamb
[25:43] and in order for those coats of skin to
[25:47] be made a lamb had to die
[25:51] remember this was before Abel killed his
[25:55] lamb this was before the tabernacle
[25:59] system and the offering and sacrificial
[26:02] system of the tabernacle this was before
[26:05] the worship and the offering and the
[26:08] sacrifices of the tabernacle and the
[26:10] temple so this was God pointing to all
[26:15] of that and to the cross he made for
[26:20] them coats of skin and clothed them
[26:22] covered the shame of their nakedness and
[26:26] did it by the shedding of blood I don't
[26:29] believe that there was a way then that
[26:31] he just peeled those skins off of the
[26:33] animals and they continued to live they
[26:36] had to give their life and they had to
[26:38] shed their blood and God was prophesying
[26:41] in Genesis to all of us that it's by the
[26:44] shedding of blood like we just read in
[26:47] Hebrews 9:22 that true salvation comes
[26:50] now Genesis 3 14 and 15 that we read
[26:55] earlier
[26:55] it says the seed of the woman this is an
[27:02] interesting word the seed of the woman
[27:06] because the word in Hebrew is zero and
[27:11] it means seed our fruit are sometimes
[27:17] posterity and I want you to
[27:20] notice that since the promised one would
[27:23] be the seed of a woman something
[27:26] different from the natural order would
[27:30] have to take place since we know from
[27:33] from science from the scripture that
[27:38] normally the seed comes from the man now
[27:43] this is something that we are familiar
[27:45] with but sometimes we look at this word
[27:48] seed of the woman and we just think well
[27:50] it's metaphoric but I want you to know
[27:54] it's a little more holy it's a little
[27:57] more precious it's a little richer in
[28:01] its meaning than just metaphorically the
[28:05] seed of a woman because when we look at
[28:08] Genesis 3 15 through 14 and 15 the word
[28:12] seed that's used for both the Serpent's
[28:15] offspring and the woman's offspring it's
[28:19] the same Hebrew word that we just
[28:22] mentioned and it can be used in the
[28:24] Bible for different ways but one of the
[28:28] most common ways that it is used the
[28:32] number one most common way is as semen
[28:35] which is the fluid that is provided by
[28:39] the man and it is from this fluid that
[28:44] the conception the fertilization of the
[28:50] egg that is provided by the woman takes
[28:53] place it can't take place without the
[28:56] seed of the man it also is a word that
[29:00] can be used in in the sense of
[29:03] agriculture as in sowing seed it also is
[29:08] sometimes means that which is scattered
[29:11] or as the product of what is sown just
[29:14] like we mentioned and it's also used as
[29:17] offspring for instance in the promised
[29:20] line of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that
[29:24] word seed appears so in order for the
[29:28] woman's seed to crush Satan's hair
[29:32] something other than the natural order
[29:35] of Concepcion would have to take place
[29:38] something other than the natural order
[29:42] of producing offspring would have to
[29:45] take place so I want you to know what
[29:47] God did he was creating from the
[29:51] beginning a new way he was producing
[29:55] creating a new thing and this is really
[30:00] the understanding and interpretation we
[30:03] get from scriptures like Jeremiah 31 22
[30:07] let's look at that for just a moment how
[30:10] long wilt thou go about o thou
[30:13] backsliding daughter for the Lord have
[30:17] created a new thing in the earth a woman
[30:23] shall come pass a man now this is an
[30:28] interesting prophetic utterance from the
[30:31] Prophet Jeremiah how long are you going
[30:34] to go backsliding o daughter for the
[30:37] Lord hath created a new thing in the
[30:40] earth a woman shall come pass a man I've
[30:45] heard all kinds of different
[30:47] explanations for this verse of scripture
[30:49] but let's look at the verse for just a
[30:52] moment it says the Lord hath created a
[30:55] new thing when we look at that Hebrew
[30:58] word for for create it's bara and it
[31:02] means to shape to form something only a
[31:05] creator can do to bring into existence
[31:10] that which did not previously exist so
[31:15] the word meaning is giving us this
[31:19] understanding the LORD hath brought
[31:22] something into existence that did not
[31:26] previously exist he has created a new
[31:31] thing in the earth when we look at that
[31:34] phrase a new thing it comes from a
[31:37] Hebrew word Kadosh and it's an adjective
[31:41] describing something fresh
[31:44] our new s in something that has never
[31:47] happened before and then we look at that
[31:50] word compass' and it means to encompass
[31:53] to surround to enclose to envelop to
[31:59] circle it's a verb of motion and and it
[32:04] means to make a change and so when we
[32:07] look at that word in in relationship
[32:11] with the other words it lets us know
[32:14] this is a prophetic scripture God is
[32:17] creating a new thing he is circling and
[32:21] enveloping a plan that has never
[32:24] happened in the earth because now a
[32:28] woman is going to come pass she's going
[32:31] to circle and envelop the man she's
[32:36] going to provide the envelope for the
[32:40] man interesting she's going to be the
[32:44] package for the man to come in like a
[32:48] box for a gift to be placed in it's
[32:51] really the Hebrew language can be so
[32:55] beautiful and this word for man here is
[32:58] a warrior a strong man emphasizing
[33:01] strength or ability and this is used 66
[33:05] different times in the Bible referring
[33:08] to a higher order of mankind and
[33:10] certainly the Lord Jesus Christ would be
[33:13] that this new thing is a virgin woman
[33:17] conceiving a man's a man-child without
[33:21] receiving the semen or the seed of a man
[33:25] this is so interesting we just say the
[33:29] Virgin Mary we all know what the
[33:32] scripture said in Luke chapter 1 that
[33:35] she would be overshadowed by the Holy
[33:39] Ghost but it is so unusual for for the
[33:44] expression to be used the seed of the
[33:47] woman it should be the seed of a man but
[33:50] this time God said I'm going to let the
[33:52] woman encompass the man and I'm going to
[33:55] do an
[33:56] in the earth that's never been done
[33:58] before a virgin is going to conceive the
[34:03] seed would be the unique son of God
[34:07] never happened the only begotten Son of
[34:12] God
[34:13] Adam was a created son and he was fresh
[34:17] from the fingertips and from the spoken
[34:20] word of God but Jesus Yeshua our Messiah
[34:24] he came in a different way altogether
[34:27] this seed that the woman would carry
[34:32] would be the unique son of God no
[34:36] contribution from a mortal man no semen
[34:40] from from the physical loins of a man
[34:43] not Joseph or any other man Joseph being
[34:48] the husband that she was espoused to but
[34:51] no man would provide the seed the semen
[34:55] it would be from the seed of a woman how
[34:59] did she get this seed is it referring to
[35:02] an egg an egg is not a seed because it
[35:06] cannot provide the conception for life
[35:10] an egg receives the seed and that's when
[35:14] conception takes place why are you
[35:16] taking our time because I want you to
[35:19] know that this is the most beautiful
[35:21] thing when we really take a moment to
[35:24] look at it so what this tells us is that
[35:27] that Mary would be almost like an
[35:33] incubator now I don't want you to take
[35:35] that in a wrong way it means that in
[35:39] order for Mary to bring forth the seed
[35:42] of God the seed of a man not knowing a
[35:49] man that even God would have to place
[35:53] inside Mary a special egg a very unusual
[36:00] thing would take place even the egg
[36:04] would be delivered to the woman by the
[36:07] hand of God her physical body would not
[36:12] even contribute the egg that was
[36:15] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit but God
[36:18] would place this seed in her body in a
[36:23] supernatural way so that her body had
[36:26] nothing to do with producing the life of
[36:29] the Son of Man the Son of God it would
[36:32] come totally by a supernatural act
[36:36] nothing natural about it
[36:38] no semen or seed from the man and even
[36:43] Mary not not providing as it would be in
[36:47] the normal way God would do a new thing
[36:50] and she would not even provide the egg
[36:53] but God Himself would provide the seed
[36:56] both the egg and that which would cost
[36:59] conception by the Holy Spirit and the
[37:03] scripture tells us in Isaiah 7:14 don't
[37:06] forget Jeremiah because Jeremiah 31 22
[37:11] said the lord hath created a new thing
[37:13] in the earth a woman shall come pass a
[37:15] man and then look at that with Isaiah
[37:18] 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall
[37:23] give you a sign this is not just natural
[37:27] turn of events this is part of that
[37:30] fullness of time that we read about in
[37:33] Galatians behold this is the sign that
[37:37] the Lord Himself would give behold a
[37:40] virgin shall conceive in the natural it
[37:44] is impossible for a virgin a girl who
[37:49] has never known the intimacy of a man to
[37:53] conceive but this is a new thing this
[37:55] was something created by God that was so
[37:58] holy and so pure and so undefiled behold
[38:03] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[38:05] and shall call his name Immanuel which
[38:10] we know means by interpretation God with
[38:14] the word sign in Isaiah 7:14 says a
[38:19] distinguishing mark it means a signal a
[38:23] token a miraculous proof see the
[38:28] scripture said the sign was given from
[38:31] the Lord and that was God providing
[38:36] allowing the seed of the woman to do
[38:40] what an egg in a natural woman would not
[38:44] be capable of doing in in a natural womb
[38:47] that egg cannot bring conception without
[38:51] the contribution of another but God
[38:55] placed such a specific egg the scripture
[38:59] calls it a seed so holy so new so
[39:03] unusual that when the Holy Spirit would
[39:08] come over Mary the Holy Spirit would
[39:12] quicken that seed and cause it to bring
[39:16] with conception life into the womb of
[39:20] that highly favored and chosen woman of
[39:25] God that word virgin in the Hebrew is a
[39:29] virgin a maid a young woman one whose
[39:32] characteristic is virginity and I
[39:35] mention that because there are many
[39:37] people who say that that scripture only
[39:39] means it didn't really mean a woman who
[39:42] had not had sexual relations it just
[39:46] means a young woman a young maiden it
[39:48] has nothing to do with her her sexuality
[39:52] or her virginity but we know that that
[39:54] is not the truth we know that this was a
[39:57] new thing we know that God was doing
[39:59] something never before done in the earth
[40:02] and that he planned this whole concept
[40:06] before the world was ever framed let me
[40:10] read it to you quickly in Luke chapter 1
[40:12] verses 26 through 35 and in the sixth
[40:16] month the angel Gabriel was sent from
[40:19] God unto a city of Galilee named
[40:22] Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man
[40:25] whose name was Joseph
[40:28] of the house of David and the Virgin's
[40:30] name was Mary or Miriam and the angels
[40:34] came in unto her and said hail thou art
[40:39] highly favoured the Lord is with thee
[40:42] blessed art thou among women and when
[40:46] she saw him it says she was troubled
[40:50] verse 29 at his saying and cast in her
[40:54] mind what manner of salutation this
[40:58] should be and the angel said unto her
[41:01] fear not Mary for thou hast found favor
[41:05] with God
[41:07] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[41:12] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[41:18] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[41:22] and shall be called the son of the
[41:25] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[41:29] him the throne of his father David can
[41:33] you imagine receiving a message like
[41:35] this from the angel Gabriel and he shall
[41:38] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[41:41] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[41:45] verse 34 then Mary then said Mary unto
[41:49] the angel how shall this be seeing I
[41:55] know not a man the angel of the Lord
[42:00] promises you will conceive and bear a
[42:03] son and Mary's response is with the
[42:06] question how can this thing be this has
[42:10] never been done before seeing that I
[42:13] know not a man meaning I've had no
[42:16] physical intimacy with a man and the
[42:19] angel answered and said unto her the
[42:22] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[42:27] power of the highest shall overshadow
[42:31] thee listen
[42:33] therefore also that holy thing which
[42:38] shall be born
[42:41] viii shall be called the Son of God that
[42:46] holy thing indeed as Jeremiah 31 22 said
[42:53] a new thing a holy thing which shall be
[42:58] born of the you're going to carry it and
[43:01] you're going to give birth to it but he
[43:05] shall be called the son of God
[43:10] I tell you that is a powerful visitation
[43:14] and so confirming of what we've read in
[43:18] Scripture and then look at Matthew
[43:20] chapter 1 and get these verses in your
[43:24] spirit verse 18 through 25 now the birth
[43:28] of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[43:32] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[43:35] before they came together she was found
[43:39] with child of the Holy Ghost you might
[43:44] say brother Shelly do you really believe
[43:46] that this is the truth about the
[43:50] conception and the birth of the Lord
[43:52] Jesus Christ I believe it with
[43:55] everything that is within me I believe
[43:58] that this was the new thing I believe
[44:02] that this was a woman encompassing a man
[44:06] and it was a virgin conceiving receiving
[44:11] a child of the Lord as we read in Isaiah
[44:15] 7:14 as a sign not any other ordinary
[44:21] man with an ordinary birth but even his
[44:25] conception was bigger than the laws of
[44:29] science even the way that he was formed
[44:34] in Mary's womb was so holy and so new
[44:37] and so different that it was a sign of
[44:40] greater things he goes on to say in
[44:44] verse 19 then Joseph Matthew 1 her
[44:48] husband being a just man and not willing
[44:51] to make her a public example
[44:54] was minded to put her away privily this
[44:58] was hard because if she's now beginning
[45:02] to show as one who is with child
[45:05] the obvious perception would be they
[45:11] have had relations together before the
[45:15] completion of their wedding vow and this
[45:19] would have brought a lot of shame and
[45:20] and Joseph he wasn't just being selfish
[45:24] it says his concern was for Mary he
[45:28] didn't want her to be ridiculed and
[45:30] mocked in such a way but while he
[45:32] thought on these things behold the angel
[45:35] of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream
[45:37] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[45:41] to take unto thee Mary thy wife listen
[45:44] for that which is conceived in her is of
[45:49] the Holy Ghost
[45:51] this was the angel of the Lord
[45:53] reassuring Joseph she has not been with
[45:57] any other man she's not only pure to you
[46:00] she's not only kept herself apart from
[46:03] you but she has kept herself apart from
[46:06] any other man you don't have to worry
[46:09] this that is growing in her womb is
[46:12] conceived by the Holy Ghost and she
[46:16] shall bring forth a son and shall call
[46:19] his name Jesus Yeshua for he shall save
[46:23] his people from their sins now all this
[46:28] was done verse 22 that it might be
[46:31] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[46:35] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[46:38] shall be with child and shall bring
[46:40] forth a son they shall call his name
[46:43] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[46:46] with us so the scripture tells us in
[46:49] Matthew 1 and 22 and 23 that this is the
[46:55] fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 then Joseph
[47:00] verse 24 being raised from sleep did as
[47:03] the angel of the Lord had been
[47:05] him and took unto him his wife and knew
[47:09] her not till she had brought forth her
[47:13] firstborn son and he called his name
[47:17] Jesus what a new thing what a holy sign
[47:23] a woman chosen given a seed that she
[47:31] might encompass circle envelop a man
[47:36] look at Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7
[47:41] for unto us back to Isaiah's prophecy of
[47:46] the coming Messiah for unto us a child
[47:49] is born unto us a son is given and the
[47:53] government shall be upon his shoulder
[47:56] and his name shall be called wonderful
[48:00] counsellor the mighty God the
[48:03] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[48:09] of the increase of his government and
[48:12] peace there shall be no end upon the
[48:16] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[48:19] order it and to establish it with
[48:22] judgment and with justice from
[48:24] henceforth even forever the zeal I love
[48:30] this the zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[48:36] perform this
[48:39] this holy giving of a seed to the woman
[48:45] that she might bear this son who would
[48:50] be known not only as Jesus Yeshua son of
[48:56] God but he would also wear the name
[49:01] wonderful counsellor the mighty God the
[49:05] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[49:08] and how would this be fulfilled the zeal
[49:13] of the law
[49:15] word will perform this this is what
[49:18] brought about this glorious wonderful
[49:22] gift from God I love this so much and we
[49:29] could take those verses of Scripture and
[49:31] even break them down further but it's
[49:35] important to understand that Jesus was
[49:39] both the Son of God and this was because
[49:44] of the condescension the word becoming
[49:48] flesh all-knowing sovereign all-powerful
[49:53] God choosing to come down into a body of
[49:59] flesh a body that would be hungry a body
[50:03] that would be tired a body that would be
[50:06] sleepy a body that would experience all
[50:10] of the emotions and struggles and even
[50:13] temptations of humanity yet without sin
[50:18] one who would so understand what it
[50:22] means to live a natural life on the
[50:26] earth even though he was very much
[50:28] supernatural God that he could be
[50:31] touched I think I just can't say enough
[50:35] of how much I love God's plan I just
[50:39] want to celebrate this plan of God I
[50:43] just want to give honor to the great
[50:45] architect the designer of all the
[50:48] universe and I just want to say Lord no
[50:51] one has ever had a greater plan no one
[50:54] has ever had better thoughts and ideas
[50:57] of how to answer the sin problem on
[51:01] planet Earth and all of this was because
[51:04] you were looking for someone who would
[51:06] love you who would serve you and worship
[51:10] you not because they were forced to but
[51:12] because with all of their heart they
[51:15] truly wanted to love you they wanted to
[51:21] serve you and this was the whole design
[51:24] we know that Jesus was the only
[51:28] gotten Son of God we mentioned earlier
[51:31] that Adam was a created son
[51:35] but Jesus was referred to as the
[51:38] begotten son of God that was a part of
[51:41] this new thing this was a part of the
[51:45] sign that was going to be given as
[51:48] prophesied by Jeremiah and Isaiah John
[51:51] 1:18 said no man hath seen God at any
[51:56] time the only begotten Son which is in
[52:00] the bosom of the Father he hath declared
[52:03] him this was a way of helping us to
[52:08] understand that Jesus was a perfect
[52:13] reflection of the father the spirit of
[52:17] the Father that was inside of him Jesus
[52:21] was the manifestation of the Living God
[52:26] God the Father as we read in Isaiah 9
[52:31] and verse 6 the ever lasting father in
[52:37] John 3:16 we all know it for God so
[52:41] loved the world that He gave His only
[52:43] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[52:46] him should not perish but have
[52:49] everlasting life
[52:53] john 3:18 he that believeth on him is
[52:58] not condemned but he that believeth not
[53:02] is condemned already because he hath not
[53:06] believed in the name of the only
[53:09] begotten Son of God and then one more
[53:13] verse here in first John chapter 4 verse
[53:17] 9 in this was manifested in all of this
[53:22] we could say was manifested the love of
[53:26] God toward us hallelujah in all of this
[53:32] was manifested the love of God toward us
[53:35] because that God sent His only begotten
[53:40] Son
[53:41] and into the world that we might live
[53:45] through him oh what a beautiful word
[53:50] what a beautiful promise I may not be
[53:54] telling you anything that you don't
[53:56] already know but it's so good to be
[53:59] reminded that every bit of this plan all
[54:03] the players all the characters the
[54:05] timing the cities the little towns every
[54:10] part of it was God's design it was a
[54:14] part of the blueprint of the Great
[54:17] Creator in order for the Lord's purpose
[54:20] to be brought to completion many events
[54:24] would have to be brought to pass many
[54:26] things would have to take place Mary had
[54:30] to get understanding from the angel of
[54:32] the Lord Joseph had to get understanding
[54:34] from the angel of the Lord Joseph had to
[54:37] had to see Mary and Mary had to catch
[54:40] Joseph's eye for them to even come
[54:43] together in an espousal in a commitment
[54:46] just think about all the different
[54:47] things that had to happen to get
[54:49] everybody on the scene at the right time
[54:52] for the sign to show up for the new
[54:56] thing to show up for the woman to
[55:00] encompass the man and and more
[55:02] importantly so that this first messianic
[55:07] prophecy of Genesis 3 14 and 15 could
[55:11] actually come to pass I will put enmity
[55:14] between thee and the woman and between
[55:16] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[55:19] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[55:21] none of this could happen without Jesus
[55:25] coming on the scene to minister to live
[55:28] to die to be resurrected and he had to
[55:32] come as the seed of the woman and this
[55:37] was the only birth where it came by the
[55:43] seed of the woman
[55:44] all other births are brought about all
[55:47] other conceptions are brought about by
[55:51] the seed of a man fertilizing
[55:54] the egg of the woman but this birth was
[55:58] a sign this birth was a new thing this
[56:02] was a part of the plan and the purposes
[56:05] of God to bring Redemption to those who
[56:09] could believe I want to pray for you as
[56:11] we go off the air may God reveal this
[56:14] truth to you may you get a hold of it
[56:17] and may it cause you to love him more
[56:19] and serve him with a more sincere heart
[56:22] than you've ever served him before

[57:16] right now I pray that you would touch
[57:19] them that they would know that you're on
[57:21] the other end of the prayer that they
