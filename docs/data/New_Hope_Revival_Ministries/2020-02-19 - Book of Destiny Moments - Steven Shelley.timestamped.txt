[0:00] how many of you'd like to run your
[0:01] finger down God's plan of destiny
[0:11] there's no romanticizing about what age
[0:14] you wish you could live then you were
[0:16] chosen handpicked Oh God saw you in out
[0:21] up and down strengths and weaknesses and
[0:24] everything else he saw it all and
[0:26] hand-picked you for such an hour as this
[0:29] because we know and have said hundreds
[0:32] of times a body was created for you
[0:34] through through the miracle of a of an
[0:37] act of consummation you had a physical
[0:39] assistance provided for you but it was
[0:42] only God and it remains only God who
[0:46] chooses what the Spirit will go into
[0:49] that little body only God and His
[0:53] sovereignty could design could choose
[0:56] what spirit would go into what body what
[1:01] family in what age let me tell you
[1:05] something a little newsflash here God
[1:07] never makes mistakes I'm suggesting that
[1:11] you step over into another realm there's
[1:15] a realm of walking in the flesh there's
[1:17] a realm of walking in the spirit I'm
[1:19] suggesting that we begin to walk in the
[1:22] spirit and that instead of trying to
[1:24] walk through where we have been or where
[1:27] we think we're going it'd be a great
[1:29] idea to find the path of life that God
[1:33] had chosen for us and shaped for us and
[1:37] recorded about us it would be good to
[1:39] catch up with God's plan for for what is
[1:43] the date today February 16th 2020 how
[1:47] many of you'd like to run your finger
[1:49] down God's plan of destiny or scroll of
[1:53] destiny or book of days or whatever
[1:55] you'd like want to call it how many of
[1:57] you'd like to scroll your finger
[1:59] find that spot x marks the spot
[2:03] February the 16th 2020 find any
[2:06] variation in who you are and what God
[2:09] said you were to be and get that under
[2:12] the blood and step up into what he has
[2:15] for you somebody said I don't even know
[2:18] what it is it's there it's in the book
[2:20] it was first a thought but now it's
[2:23] written down and I thought about those
[2:26] demon spirits that want to swindle you
[2:30] and swindle me out of a page in my
[2:37] Destiny's book I don't want to live
[2:40] another moment in the permissive will of
[2:42] God when there's a book somewhere with
[2:45] the perfect will of God for my life
[2:47] written in that book and it was sealed
[2:50] up I believe it I believe those truths
[2:52] and even the days of your life were
[2:55] sealed up underneath that book of
[2:58] redemption and whether you realize it or
[3:01] not it's not sealed up anymore you have
[3:05] an opportunity by revelation to see the
[3:07] plan of redemption to see your name in
[3:09] the book come on to see what how you fit
[3:14] and to get up and do it I love the fact
[3:18] that God not only had a thought but he
[3:20] wrote it down and he is forever
[3:23] accountable to what his first thoughts
[3:26] were about you he cannot forget what he
[3:29] thought about you in the beginning even
[3:31] if he could he can't even if he won't he
[3:34] can't because it is written down in the
[3:36] book
