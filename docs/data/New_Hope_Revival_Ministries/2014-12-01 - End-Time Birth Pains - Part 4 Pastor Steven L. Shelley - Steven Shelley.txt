access to all of our video archives including every uh episode of the eagles cry we're making that available on the video on demand as well as many of our regular services here at new hope revival ministries so for a small investment you would be able to gain access to to a real resource of truth that i know would be a blessing in your life i didn't intend to give that as a commercial but it is a good idea for you to know what's available on our website revival.org we want to be a blessing to you and we realize that 30 minutes a week is not enough to be able to share with you many of the things that the lord has placed in our hearts to share so our website would be a great resource of information for you as well let's look to the word of god today we're studying birth pains we're talking about the end of time as we know it and we are counting down through 10 of the major categories of birth pains that are specifically mentioned in the scripture last week we talked about number 10 signs in the sun and the moon and the stars luke 21 25 jesus clearly tells us there will be signs in the sun in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring so uh we're talking about major weather pattern changes we're talking about uh increased uh signs in the heavens we we've been we've talked about the comets and the asteroids the meteors all of these kinds of things that are happening and some bringing devastation you know in times past it's just been the thought that these things could happen and now they're happening in reality and they're going to continue to happen and increase in frequency and intensity as we approach the coming of the lord we even talked about unidentified flying objects we mentioned at the uh in the broadcast last week that some of what people are saying there there are definitely natural explanations for for what they're seeing or what they're photographing but i also believe that people are observing both demonic activity and angelic activity that takes place between here and the second heaven uh between the earth's atmosphere and the second heaven and so people are seeing it they're they're appearances of some of this activity we really need the help of the holy spirit to be able to discern is this demonic activity i'm viewing or is this angelic activity that i that i have observed and of course some people have no grid for that so they're calling it flying saucers and life on mars and all kinds of other things uh but it's it's sometimes people dismiss it too quickly because there is some legitimacy to it it's part of the prophecy of our lord that there would be signs in the heavens and then we talked about number nine violence upon the whole earth luke 17 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man and we read genesis 6 11 that describes for us as well as genesis 6 13. but genesis 6 11 said the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence and that's number nine violence escalating to the point that it is covering the whole earth we are seeing violence of such an unprecedented nature uh at least in our lifetime you know we're seeing things that that we never dreamed about we're talking about terrorism on a different level we're talking about uh i mean we're talking about nuclear warfare again we're talking about nations who who have either have the capability or are very close to having the capability to to launch weapons that would take out enormous numbers of people and there's going to be some some violence like that happen on planet earth what we must remember as children of god is that we cannot move and live in fear because the scripture is clear that fear brings torment and we can't live in that kind of fear you know i always remember what david said i'm an old man and i've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread i truly believe you know call me naive if that's what you need to do but i truly believe that god is more than able to take care of his seed he is more than able to protect and to and to provide for his bride no matter what's happening in the world you see it's extremely dark out there but it's extremely bright in here because the bride of christ is being positioned and prepared and not only positioned and prepared we're being equipped we are learning by revelation the word of god we're learning how to deal with some of the issues of our heart we're learning how to quiet our souls so that we can live out of the realm of the spirit and our spirit has been regenerated and transformed by the very life of jesus christ so when we live out of our spirit we are living out of the life of jesus christ the organic life there is a there is an organic union that has taken place in our spirit man and that has brought to us the life of jesus christ zoe the eternal life of god and i i just believe if we lean on that and live out of that that we're going to be taken care of i think that we need to be wise i think that we need to consider making practical choices and decisions in our life i don't think that we need to tempt the lord i don't think that we need to be foolish in the way that we handle the end time but i think that we need not live in fear we need to live in confidence not self-confidence but but properly placed confidence what is that that is putting our hope and our trust and our confidence in the one who created us and not only created us but the one who made a way of redemption for us uh our eternal loving heavenly father he loved us so much that he took his spirit and placed it in a body that he created with specific specially designed creative redemptive blood and that blood was shed by our lord jesus christ yeshua the messiah who came to fulfill every jot and tittle of the passover promise he became our passover lamb shed his blood paid the price settled our sin dead we are being sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and we have the promise of being filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and fire somebody say fire we need the fire of god to fill us to consume us so that we can be transformed from this vile image to the very image and likeness of the one who loves us the most the one who created us for this specific purpose to arise and shine in the end time the bride of christ is going to arise and shine the church world the religious world is falling to apostasy but the bride of christ is going to arise and shine she's going to let the light of god emanate from within her she's going to point others to this way of hope this way of salvation so we're going to see violence increasing on the earth terrorism on a level i i shudder to say this on a level that we have not known it in the past and it has definitely increased over the past few years but unfortunately we're going to see it some more a new president a new prime minister a new dictator whatever the case is not going to solve the problems of the world the only hope for planet earth is to bow before her creator we're going to have to acknowledge the god of abraham isaac and jacob we're going to have to repent of our sins and take god's provided way of of salvation and in doing so if we could get enough people to come together and make that declaration we could see some changes but unfortunately there is going to be a harvest of souls but it it's not going to be the whole world every person on the planet turning to the lord like some have tried to make us i'd love that i mean that that works for me the problem is to teach that is giving false hope because the scripture does not tell us that every person in the world is going to be saved we have a choice to make and the truth is god already knows our choice before we ever make it in fact he knew our choice before we were ever born in fact he knew our choice before the foundation of the world we make the choice but god saw that choice in his foreknowledge and according to the foreknowledge that he had concerning us he predestinated us which means he gave us a pre-fixed destiny to those whom god did for no to them also he did predestinate and we have been predestinated to be conformed to his image to be changed from this old corruptable flesh we live in to a new and glorious body that's been created for us but also transformed on the inside our soul being redeemed and our spirit uh redeemed you know john g lake the great man of god uh taught uh this understanding of triune salvation salvation for the body for the soul and the spirit and i believe i mean it's simple the salvation of god is sufficient his grace is sufficient and he not only saves us so that we can you know be nice little church people but he changes us and transforms us so that we can be ambassadors of light so that we can keep covenant with god and so that we can speak deliverance to those around us i know every one of you watching this broadcast today no people not only do you know them some of you have loved ones who are bound by the power of satan and the power of sin and you want to be able to see them come to the knowledge not just the knowledge the saving knowledge and the saving reality of the lord jesus christ and i i join my faith with yours right now i believe we have every right to believe god for the salvation of our loved ones but i'm going to tell you what's going to have the biggest impact on our loved ones and our neighbors and that is when we are delivered you and i are delivered from hypocrisy when we come out of that place of of speaking one thing and living another when we are determined i guess i'm using my hands too much huh but uh so but i guess if i fold them like that maybe i won't use them for a few seconds but i i just get pretty intense when i talk about these kinds of things and i feel like sometime when i'm sitting here that that i'm just having a chat with you and uh i believe that's the anointing of the lord that makes that possible because i don't want to be preaching down at you i want to be encouraging you we want to see our loved ones saved we want to see them delivered we want to see them filled with the walking talking holy ghost and in order to do that i think we're going to have to to bring our lives in in alignment with what we say you know we're good at talking the talk now we need to be good at walking the walk i think that that spirit of hypocrisy and compromise has has certainly kept a lot of precious people away from the saving reality of jesus christ so you and i need to do something about that we need to draw up to the lord as close as we can possibly get we need to be able to lay our head over on his chest and hear his heart beat and know what he cares for what he loves what he's passionate about i want to discover what breaks his heart what disappoints him i want to be able to know him in that intimate way so that i can better live to serve him it's time for the bride of christ to rise up and and serve god not only in word but indeed because these birth pains are going to continue as i've said over and over they're going to increase in intensity and frequency and we're going to have to shine we're going to have to help pick up the pieces of of broken lives and devastated nations and cities that are going to be shaken by the power of god which brings us to number eight on our backward countdown jesus said there's going to be famines pestilences and earthquakes like never before the scripture tells us in in matthew 24 and 7 for nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places and in luke chapter 21 verse 11 he said and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven so all of these diff birth pains that have indicated the beginning of sorrows the beginning of travail are now moving faster and increasing and so we have to prepare ourselves i mean earthquakes have been happening forever the earth has been shaking the plates have been shifting but we can see by careful research that there has already been an intensity a change in intensity and frequency um i noticed that that the usgs the united states geological uh society or or whatever they are averaging the earthquakes and and by doing that they averaged the frequency since 1900 and by averaging them that way uh from 1900 until 2010 it doesn't really show us an accurate concept of the change in frequency and intensity the trend it has to be done in a different way it has to be broken up and an easy way of doing that is breaking it up in decades do you follow what i'm saying if you if you take a hundred years and you average every earthquake that's happened in 100 years it pulls the frequency and intensity down but if you divide the the number of earthquakes in the world into decades and you look at them by average you've got a different picture you're seeing something and i've i've uh i have that research here and i can share that with you we're talking only right now about earthquakes 8.0 and above we're talking about major rumblings okay so from 50 from 1950 to 1959 there were only three earthquakes in the world 8.0 or greater from 1960 to 69 only three 8.0 or greater 70 to 79 only three 8.0 or greater 80 to 89 there was a change there were four that year 8.0 or greater 90 to 99 there were six six earthquakes 8.0 or greater and then from 2000 until 2009 there were 13. so we've gone from three a decade now to 13 or more in a single decade that was from 2000 to 2009 and now we're in a new decade and we're seeing frequency and intensity increase now look at deaths for instance quickly i'm going to give you the total number of deaths in a decade from earthquakes from 80 to 89 there were 58 880 deaths in that decade in from 90 to 99 it nearly doubled 114 646 from 2000 to 2009 there were 471 000 and 12 deaths so we're not talk did you see that jump for in the 80s there were 58 000 in the 90s 114 000 and from 2000 to 2009 471 000. look at this in 2010 there were 226 729 in one year 226 000. in one year of this decade that we're living in now there have already been 200 and i don't have the information uh for 2011 12 and now we've entered into 2013 but it's certainly not likely that we're going to see less earthquakes of 8.0 and greater and it's certainly not likely that we're going to see less deaths as these earthquakes increase in frequency and intensity the number of casualties is going to increase why because the earth is in birth pains you know people say uh oh it's the judgment of god god is judging the earth listen you can you can look at it any way you want to i mean you can call it judgment if you like but is it really judgment if you warn people ahead of time and tell them this is how it's going to be in the end time you need to consider your ways and then when it begins to happen 2 000 years later like jesus prophesied it then we all rise up and say well it's the judgment of god now i'm not going to say that it doesn't pertain to his judgment it's but it's really the purging of the earth it's the purifying of the earth it's the earth in birth pains squeezing something contracting so that something can come forth of greater glory and the greater glory is the kingdom of god this earth as we know it has to give way for the coming kingdom of god and so the signs of the nearness of the coming of the kingdom of god are these birth pains part of which are earthquakes and so we're going to see them they're going to not only shake the places that are familiar in fact i had a word a couple years ago where the lord said i'm going to clearly allow earthquakes to come into the places where people expect them but i'm going to show my power in my strength in places where people have not expected earthquakes to come so it sounds to me like we're going to see a baffling of science that we're going to see a scientific knowledge in theory even tested in the end time the bible said the scripture tells us that god is going to shake everything that can be shaken to determine what is strong enough to remain i tell you the bride of christ is going to withstand the shaking of planet earth we're going to stand we're going to remain and we're going to bring forth the fruits of righteousness i'm not saying that that righteous people won't die in these things that happen in the earth i'm not saying that at all i'm telling you in all likelihood they have and they will but not without warning and remember that precious in the sight of the lord is the is the death of his saints if if we are taken out of here by by some tragedy or some uh some natural calamity or disaster my to be uh to to to be absent from this body is to be present with the lord i'm ready i want to stay ready i want to stay packed up paid up and ready to go and we need to do that we need to be aware of the things that are going on listen i get on the airplane all the time i'm aware of the fact that airplane may not always stay where it's supposed to stay i hope it does i don't believe i'm going to die one second before the lord is through with me and i don't believe you are either but i'd like to stick around as long as i possibly can i just i just love serving the lord i love god's people i love taking the message of truth to the nations of the world by christian television but if if you hear the news one of these days that i'm gone by by natural death a problem in my body or some tragedy you can know because i can know i know that every sin is covered by the blood of jesus i am not a perfect person i make mistakes i fail the lord but i know what to do about it i know how to call on him and he shows and extends his grace and he forgives me and i walk in a in a place of redemption and wholeness and you can too i want to pray for you right now father be with those who are watching this broadcast release your revelation truth into their lives lord let your promises come alive in our hearts in the wonderful name of yeshua our messiah thank you for watching the eagles cry my time is gone but i hope you'll tune in again i have a whole lot more on my heart that i want to share with you bye bye for now you
