the 5th and the 6th on that weekend we will receive an offering for the principle of the mortgage of this building I'll get to that in just a moment what I would like to say first is the grounds need to be mowed and trimmed and and and the Under the Tent there's going to take some manpower to move tables to get that all cleaned up and so I will not be here next weekend so I'm going to throw this all on my son Nathan so I'm asking you if Nathan does not have your phone number will you please make sure brothers that he does have your phone number so when he is getting ready to uh mow and trim and so forth that he can reach out for some help we don't want to put this all on him he can't do it by himself although at times he'd like to try but we want to make sure that the grounds are beautiful for the fellowship uh so that would probably have to happen next weekend so if you can help out doing that you can we ask Nathan to give them a little bit of a heads up because sometimes if it's the morning of or even the evening before people have made plans and we don't want them to do that yeah give them a good notice a couple days if possible and uh perhaps he can even utilize the um the app to be able to reach out to you so he can tell when he's going to do that and give you some notice I would like to report to you that a 5500 payment was made is that right this week and so the amount owed on the loan right now stands at 142 701.67 isn't the Lord good to us [Applause] huh Hallelujah glory to God he is faithful and you have been faithful to give 324 thousand ninety three dollars and sixty two cents toward this to get rid of this debt by the grace of God so brother Elias and brother Austin Hodges were going to ask these two brothers to come to you today while they sing We want to give is giving unto the Lord of our tithe and offering and remember two weeks from now in our fellowship weekend the first weekend of the month we will receive the principal offering as

seated you've been standing for quite a while and I want you to have a little rest while we share a few things with you if you are streaming this service today would you go into the chat and put where you're from we would like to do that over the course of the next few weeks we would like to know where people are from who are streaming the service and we respect the fact that some of you want to remain anonymous and uh may I say that if you're streaming on Facebook you're not completely anonymous because your friends can see when you join so many are being exposed around the world because they don't know that Facebook has that little feature and I'm getting screenshots sent to me from three or four continents so uh uh hahaha no we're so blessed uh there are hundreds of Ministries around this message thousands around the Christian faith that stream their services and we are pioneers I I'm thankful that we had a vision a long time ago before this streaming stuff was was possible I opened up an old Bible of mine a few days ago and found a note in brother Wallace's handwriting to tell me who all was streaming the service a whole list and it wasn't streaming then it was telephone hookup and uh so we've been at this a long time and that's why people have tried to buy our our domainrevival.org and uh we will it's not for sale no no no we we we got it just as there was an internet breaking forth and I remember I've told this before but I remember sitting in the in the apartment and the offices upstairs at the church in Columbus and uh Kevin was on the other end of the of the computer in Edmonton Alberta Canada I'm looking at a black screen it was kind of like playing Atari like I mentioned last week just a blank screen and all of a sudden a little cursor appeared on the blank screen my I'm feeling old no texting no smartphones only a few cellular phones and they were bag phones about that big pagers were big I think at one time I had one on each hip and uh but I'll never forget seeing my name Hey Brother Shelly I jumped up and down I got up out of the chair I jumped all over the office I said this is the most wonderful invention that has ever been made and it's going to make it possible for us to send our services to the world and all it was was just a little chat an inside chat going on between brother Kevin and I and now look what we have uh an app where we can stream right on our phone somebody said aren't you concerned about the filth that is uh that is on the internet I'm very concerned about it but it's not going anywhere it's not going anywhere if anything it will increase and so all we can do is not get caught in that trap but use I'm going to tell this because I I feel a little something unusual here this morning now you know my grandmother was a preacher she was a pastor and when she heard this message she stepped down because of the word what the word said but she had been doing it she was ordained in the Assemblies of God in 1949 and 50 somewhere in there and so she had been doing it a long time my granny was Assembly of God but she was a Holy Roller she didn't cut her hair she didn't wear pants like they all do today and uh she didn't wear makeup and she didn't wear jewelry and every now and again she would wear a pen if she had a dress that didn't come tight together she would wear a little pen there or something small I think I've got a picture of her back there with a little Shepherd's crook for a little pen that someone had given her and she had had some new dresses made and they had made the sleeve shorter than she liked and she wore one to the pulpit she wore one out on the platform and the spirit of the Lord this is her testimony convicted her and told her that that wasn't she wasn't covered enough and so she went and had him to add something on that's just just how my granny was and she was in a service and they were uh preaching against television now this would have been in the early 50s and they were preaching against television and she said I knew everything they were saying was right I knew that what they were saying was right that Satan was going to use it that it was going to put filth in people's living rooms that there would be adultery on it there would be alcohol there would be smoking on it and everyone would have I knew everything they were saying was right but something in my heart was turning differently in that moment and she said I was sitting on the platform listening to the preacher and at the end of the service the spirit of the Lord came on her she said I stood and began to prophesy and the Word was something like this I the Lord hath seen this I see the evil I I know the end from the beginning but I want to say to my people that I will take what the enemy has meant for evil I will use it to reach my seed around the world and she you would have never moved her off of that prophecy she said that the Lord spoke and said that he would use the medium of television and you all know that he has that he is he's used our brother Erickson in Iceland to send the gospel into Palestine the Palestinian territories and the gospel has gone in we were we had people in Janine and in Ramallah that we're watching our program when normal television couldn't even get in or get out and God was letting satellite take the the message of Truth and so we always have to keep our balance and that being said you have the gospel so you don't need one I'm just being honest don't look at me like that you don't need it you may want it and you may have it but you don't need it it's not a necessity you can get your highlights on the news what do you call it I started say facts to you boy Squad but you don't need it Christians don't need it we have everything we need if we have the word of God the message of the Hour come on you're some of you right now sitting here wouldn't be in the mess you're in right now if you didn't feed the other side of Who You Are hello it's the truth so we are thankful for the streaming we are thankful for YouTube I don't know what all is on YouTube I don't care I don't watch it I don't look for it but I know one thing God is using YouTube for the message of the hour to go out and he's using Facebook he's using the app he's using the website and I want to give God praise I just want to thank him for doing that thank you we are getting ready to restock our inventory of the Supernatural series it's a reprinted book six is reprinted now there was almost uh somewhere between 12 and 18 months that we couldn't even get the last book of the series it was out of print it has been reprinted now and we are getting ready to restock it's going to be expensive to do that hundreds of dollars to restock what we need because we want them to be available the price will drop because they've got a better deal on the on the printing and so if you have uh had a book if you've taken a book if you've asked for a book from the Supernatural series there are two or three families that have and you've not yet paid for them would you do that now today before you leave um so that we can use that money we don't when we were traveling and we had a big product table we had an account and it had money in it all the time because everything that we sold on the road went to the ministry I didn't take any of it personally we don't have that account anymore because most of everything we have is free online and so we don't really have the extra funds to do that so if you will help us in the get that taken care of today that would be great also to you streamers we have had two families one from Missouri one from Kentucky who have had their tithe check returned to them I have looked at the envelopes I can't see anything wrong with the address uh sister Terry for one she just stuck hers in another envelope wrote the same address and it came to us and the same thing happened to brother and sister brother Truman and and sister Martha Miller in Missouri would you all help me pray that if someone is you know I don't know how they do it anymore more sort it wrong or or return it or whatever they're doing uh we could we need the finances we need them always to keep doing what we're doing and I I don't need that we don't need to have to wait another 10 15 days on on a check to come back to us I wouldn't have mentioned it if it was just one but since there's been two now uh I'll mention that to the streamers if it returns back to you just put it in another envelope and and and put the address uh on and always remember we have the app and and the website for giving as well and no it's not as convenient for some people but you never know with the mail and the price keeps going up to mail something and really it's just uh just a difficult thing brother Greely has already mentioned the fellowship I know you all are still here I'm very aware just wanted you all to know I hadn't forgot you uh brother Greeley has mentioned our fellowship service is coming up on August the 5th and the 6th and so we need you to respond to Sister Stacy's note there on uh on the app uh what you'll be bringing we'll have a lunch and fellowship on Saturday and we will have a breakfast uh Fellowship that evening after the service and then a picnic potluck whatever you call it on Sunday we want to feed the people who come for a visit and we're looking forward to what God's going to do that weekend something tells me he's going to show up Hallelujah I found something pretty special earlier in this service I got pretty excited all their my faith just started jumping up and down and then some of you started pouting about what something I said I don't know and that will lift it'll lift if we let it I don't want it to lift I want to thank Brother David Mann I don't want to advertise for you because I I may need you and I don't want you to be busy with anybody else but I want to thank Brother David Mann and and David Jr uh for helping Benjamin and Jenna yesterday their air conditioning went out this week we need Benjamin here leading worship and uh not melting and uh it was hot can you imagine in the 90s in the in the mobile home and uh he came out and charged it but that wasn't going to help us and whatever else he was doing trying to fix it so they had to replace that unit a great expense in in uh in the America that we live in you know that's when you really realize there's inflation when you see that prices have doubled on certain things but God was good to them Brother David was able with his son to come spend all day in the heat installing the unit tearing out a wall doing all kinds of things to get it done he gave up his day off for my family and I want to thank you so much both of you thank you thank you thank you for doing that we appreciate it Hallelujah let's get something else out of the way uh tomorrow Monday June 24th his sister Judith's birthday we want to say happy birthday to her in Edmonton can we send our love to Sister Judith this morning [Applause] Thursday of this coming week is Sister Rhonda Shaw's birthday she's not here this morning but we say happy birthday to Sister Rhonda God bless you [Applause] and Saturday uh the 29th is Gregory May's birthday there out of town on an anniversary trip and not here today but we want to send a happy birthday to Gregory as well God bless you [Applause] all right I have two announcements that I need to make this morning one of them is a little sad but don't be sad it's going to be okay God always makes a way amen a couple months ago no excuse me about a month ago four weeks ago something like that we found out through the grapevine that our apartment in Jerusalem was being sold now that was very hard to hear very hard to hear it's still very hard to hear I mentioned brother Greeley that I had gotten the confirmation this morning and I said but I don't want to talk about it and I didn't and I don't I don't want to talk about it but I want to give God an opportunity to move so we prayed I didn't say anything to many people about it because it brought up so many raw emotions for me and I'm thinking now Lord here we are just now believing that we're entering into a cycle where we're really going to need it and we're losing it so it's hard and uh but God has been good to me over the last few weeks he's given me a vision and a heart for for Israel again he has showed me a few things that I cannot share with you this morning but I will share with you at some point that I believe God is very much concerned about our connection in the land and I believe that we are to have an apartment in Jerusalem until the Rapture and when that takes place we won't need it anymore and they can do with it as they want we are very blessed for 21 years we have rented the apartment it is an amazing place it has been a great blessing to brother Benny Friedman and his wife and children as they have lived in it now for quite a few years and it was important that we have someone in it because there was a break-in some years ago that was quite a hassle and we used to have two apartments and then we went down to one and I did receive official confirmation this morning hadn't had it been praying just believing the Lord but I had asked Benny to start looking for a new place because I cannot feel as I've prayed that that it's time to to move out of of Jerusalem I believe it's time to move in and that there are greater things ahead for us so we are going to be looking for an apartment we're going to be believing that greater days are ahead for the work in Jerusalem we want to thank every one of you for your faithful prayers and your unbelievable sacrificial giving through the years we've had some tough times but I had a beautiful letter from the owners of these apartments Thanking us for all of the years now you might say well you just about paid for one in 21 years I wish that were the case but the apartment is it sold for over a million dollars and we won't know the exact amount real estate has gone up up up in Jerusalem and apartments like the one we have are unheard of you don't find a three-level apartment like we have in a little hidden but beautiful place God gave it to us it served us it served many people around the world we had beautiful Services there we baptized many people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because of the ministry sister Nancy served us so well there for many years but it's a new beginning God giving us a new beginning so we have to have a new place they are going to honor the lease till the 28th day of February which is a tremendous relief to us because we have you would not believe only you that have been there would believe the amount of stuff that's in the apartment I inherited everything that sister Nancy owned we gave her clothes away we gave a lot of her personal items away when she passed but but books and computers and office equipment chairs for about 75 people Pulpit keyboard set up for a church everything and so we either need a a great storage place which is a little iffy or we need an apartment between now and then would you pray that God will lead us do you know how hard it is to tend to that kind of business on the other side of the world so guess what that means I get to go but we don't know when in fact several of us may get to go because we may have to make some trips and I can't lift all that stuff so we're going to have to have some help lifting it uh I don't even want to think about what's all there there's beds to sleep we probably have beds to sleep 30 people stored in the basement I mean it's a camp we have just about everything two apartments two three level Apartments full of stuff and uh so anyway uh I had a piece come over me even though I didn't want to talk about it I had a peace come over me that it's a new beginning and God has it I just want to see a hand of commitment that you will help me pray and you'll get you'll just believe that God Will Make A Way because we believe that this message must be preached in Jerusalem as a sign of the end of the end we believe it we believe it how that looks what that looks like I have no idea that was some sad news but hopeful news now I want you all to look at me carefully anyone out there in the hallway anybody in the nurseries I'd like to see every face of every person that's here can you ask them to come out this is strange day isn't it I had no intention of announcing this today but I just felt like the lord gave me the permission as I was sitting there the nudge no one's in trouble that sounds terrible when you start clearing the bathrooms and the nurseries and I just want you to hear it face I want to see you when you hear what I have to say brother Greely knows Hallelujah Luke is the men's bathroom empty charity is the lady's bathroom empty drag them out [Music] this is big news and guess what I'm not even turning off the Stream who's coming they're coming in come in I want to see your faces should I be saying it nicer please let me see y'all's face everybody in now I heard brother Greeley announce what I had given him to announce you have given 324 000 93.62 from March of 2020 uh one March of 2021 to July 22nd of 23. 324 093.62 that is quite a gift and some of you made great sacrifices I also heard brother Greely announce that as of today we owe on the loan now this isn't the payoff but when I looked at the payoff this week you know that changes almost daily but when I looked at the payoff this week it was actually a dollar or two less than what it says we owed on the payment so that's good if it'll stay like that we'll be glad so I heard brother Greely announce that we owed 142 000. can you all put that on the screen I want people to see what that looks like can we do that is anybody having fun yet brother and sister man I'm so sorry that that it's like this today David your son is here he will think we're just crazy I'm sorry Junior 140 to 701 142 701 dollars okay I'm with you I'm waiting on you I'm not going anywhere I've got another two hours here 701 67. what's that I'll wait till it updates you'll you'll at least say I've never been to another church like this one I heard brother Greeley say because that's what I put on his paper 104 I wrote this today 142 dollars oh no one hundred and forty two thousand seven hundred one dollars and sixty seven cents how many of you know we're believing to pay every bit of that off by the end of the year that's a lot of money for anybody for anybody we're believing God it looks a little scary when we look at that number right but God said 2023 is going to be a Supernatural year so God's going to do Supernatural things now we haven't paid this has not gone on yet because I we need another day for the for the money to clear the check to clear and so this hasn't gone to the bank yet and I wanted to wait until it had gone to the bank and everything and I could come and give you the updated balance and not even announce it we've known this for two weeks now boy it's been hard to not to tell you whoa but can I tell you that God in an unexpected way has provided an additional one hundred thousand dollars [Applause] [Music] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] thank you Lord we give you the praise we give

Jesus he made the way and the only other thing I'm going to say is that we have friends around the world who love this place and who want it to be all that God has created it to be and so do you and so God has provided and that's all we need to know is that he is faithful and he will be faithful but I can honestly say that it's a lot one more time let me see it charity did you take it away one more time let me look at that that looks did you ever think that 42 000 would look small it looks so tiny God is so good let's thank God for the musicians John chapter 1. beginning in verse 1 through verse 14. in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God in the beginning there was the word and the word was with God and the word was God it's powerful it's beautiful it's mysterious until the Revelation comes now the next verse the same the word was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made can you say Amen in him God and the word now they're one now they're one so we can say in God was life or we could say in the word was life because we're now told they're one in him the word was life and the life was the light of men what was the light of men both God and the word in him was life and the life was the light of men let's go on and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him not not John but the light John was a witness of the light and many would believe in the light because of John that all men through him might believe so can we say that God must have made John a light to reflect the light so that all could see the light beautiful really there the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light remember that light was God that light was the word John was not that light but as the moon reflects not its own light but the light of the sun John was like the Moon he was like a mirror and when that light shined on John John reflected that light if you saw John you would have seen the light if you would have met John you would have met the light because the light was emanating from John though he was not that light he was sent to Bear witness of that light you follow that let's go on that that that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the word he was in the word he the word was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not because we know that our lord Jesus was the word made flesh he was in the world Jesus the word was in the world and the world was made by Jesus the word god and the world knew him not how is it that he created the world and the world didn't even recognize its creator that was because of religious men who already had an idea of what he would look like when he came and when he came he didn't look like they thought he would look you bear a sword like a zealot and try to rid Israel of the Roman occupation and so because man had produced this thought of how the Messiah would look when he came he came and they didn't even know who he was because preachers rabbis had presented their concept of what he would look like and it caused the people to miss him religious men still doing the same thing today [Applause] he came unto his own both the Jewish people and those of Adam's Fallen race and his own his own his own the ones he created the ones he had relation with the ones who he would become a Kinsmen Redeemer for and his own received him not but as many here I am here I am here you are but as many as received him to them death not to those look The Light Came to light the path for every man The Light Came To Shine on every man but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God many received the benefit of the light being in the Earth healed Miracles fish sandwiches bills paid because of him but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God not just to everyone who amend him or who benefited from his coming but to those who received him to receive him is to give up to receive him is to give up your own rights your own will and surrender to his but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God all right now and the word verse 14 and the word remember the word was with God in the beginning and the word was God and the Word was made flesh no Trinity here no three persons of the godhead here the god the word that was one one was made flesh one and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory you're not replacing the father you're not putting the father out you're not dishonoring the father when you receive him you've received the father didn't Jesus say when you have seen me you have because I'm here to Bear witness of him when you've seen me you've seen the father John could have said when you've seen me you've seen the father because he was made one with the word is that right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth father we need you today we've been on a roller coaster this morning we've had some serious things to think about contemplate and pray about and then we had a climax like no other that you have miraculously reduced [Music] graciously generously reduced that big mountain that was in front of us and we started praising you in the first grain of sand rolled off we didn't wait until there were big checks we started praising you in the first grain of sand rolled off that mountain in your name we gave you praise we jumped we dance we Rejoice we shouted and we gave you the glory and so until the end of this we will do the same yours is the glory help us now during this time in your word in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated thank you to all of you who are rejoicing with us streaming this service many many and and telling us where you're from thank you thank you we will go back and see every one of those comments I want to go to questions and answers number two and we're already 15 minutes to one and so we're going to have to have a slightly abbreviated version of this this morning but if you will pull we'll get to where we need to be by God's grace now in paragraph 106 he said the pillar of fire is the anointing did you know when you are calling for the anointing to come you are calling on the pillar of Fire isn't that great now now what do we know about that Pillar of Fire we know that that Pillar of Fire is what led the didn't we just do this a few weeks ago when different ones were reading scriptures and they told us how that Pillar of Fire would lead the children of Israel by day and a pillar of cloud by night I mean Cloud by day Fire by night we got it didn't we read how that when the enemy was approaching that fire before them removed itself came around behind them and blocked the enemy that that manifestation whether it was fire or whether it was Cloud it it provided protection for them and and and don't we understand that as Believers of this end time truth that God allowed that same Pillar of Fire to come down at Shavuot in the upper room and divide itself one great manifestation of God now divided into individual little licks of fire appearing over their head and that same light I want to say this again it divided itself you see God is in the multiplying and dividing business he both multiplies and he divides and so on that day he both multiplied and he divided he divided himself because he was that light he was that fire he was that cloud amen same manifestation the Bible is clear that was God that wasn't a an object lesson that wasn't just a symbol it was a manifestation of God so if the pillar of fire is the anointing and the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God I want you to understand that when the anointing comes he comes like a person not a Feeling but he comes as a manifestation of God are you awake are you with me I need you to be with me this morning so the pillar of fire is the anointing if the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God did you know the anointing is also a manifestation of God not a Feeling it's really God showing up in the house you can take a song and and it'd be a lovely song a nice song but when the anointing comes in that Psalm God oh God is manifesting himself in that song and through that song have you ever had God show up in your conversation you're just having a good bible discussion and he comes the anointing come you may not see the pillar of fire but the pillar of fire is the anointing and the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God amen and uh so are you because you are a word sent from God and the Bible said that God is very very particular about his word and not any of his word none of it will return to him void and what that means is it will not return to him not having accomplished all that he sent it to accomplish that includes you you must see yourself as a part of that word a part of that fire a part of that anointing so I want to I want to summarize Again by by reading this sentence the pillar of fire is the anointing now when you're Sway and and sister uh Jaya we're getting ready to sing I said bless them Lord anoint them Lord what am I asking I'm asking for God to manifest himself to them so that he can manifest himself through them you're saying Lord let the pillar of fire fall on them but you're also saying let the pillar of fire rise in them because the anointing doesn't just fall on us we are the anointed did you know anything that the anointing falls on it becomes anointed of God did you know on that day excuse me did you know on that day that the pillar of fire fell on the mountain it shows an ordinary bush there was nothing particular about that bush it wasn't a glorious Bush it wasn't necessarily a beautiful bush we don't even know the Botanical genre of that bush we don't know the Latin name of that bush somebody said well I got a burning bush in my yard well good for you that's what someone has called it but we don't know if we don't know the the Bush was not the important part that Bush was just a bush just about I feel like preaching and I only feel like about half of you feel like listening that is dangerous combo because I feel like preaching and only about half of you feel like listening I don't know where this thing will get to just a bush I want you all to see it Mr Bush not a pretty bush necessarily might have been might have been beautiful nobody said anything it wasn't beautiful enough for Moses to tell about how beautiful it was till the fire hit it it was not a holy Bush I'll tell you that Mr Bush and one day God come down on the mountain and he said I got to talk to my prophet so I'm gonna crawl inside of a bush and God doesn't do things all uh you know just totally random so he looked down among the bushes and he found a bush if I know anything about God's character he chose the lowliest bush [Applause] he chose Bethlehem he chose to make him a Galilean he chose Shepherds to sing about his birth to go tell the good news about his verse why it had to be Shepherds so if I know anything about the character of God he didn't say let me look down here and see the most amazing Bush I can use it it was more or less most likely that it was just a scrub God said that one will do because he was not nearly as concerned about that bush before it didn't really matter what it was five seconds before when God crawled into that bush and it began to burn with a fire and the fire could not consume the bush God protected the bush so that he preserved the bush so that it burnt but was not yet consumed we don't know if the bush actually looked any different when the fire of God moved out we don't know if it was scorched we don't know if it was singed we don't know if his growth was stunted we don't even know that in 50 years Moses came back up on that mountain if he could even found the bush we're not told the Bush was given eternal life so when was that bush most important when God was in the bush when the fire was on the bush was the bush holy before the fire or after the fire it was holy when the fire came [Applause] if we were denominationally minded we would say as soon as the fire left the Bush was still holy and we would build a shrine and we would paint a picture of it and we would make an icon in the Church of it and we would have people do the sign of the cross when they passed the picture of the Bush because we like to put the holy in common things and make them big things and we do that with religious intent and not sincere hearts so I don't know what the bush looked like after but I want you to know as long as the fire of God was on that bush an ordinary Bush was made into a holy bush and as long as you and I have the very life of God inside of us [Applause] doesn't matter what we were five seconds before he came [Music] when he puts himself in US we become a holy bush we become a holy people well we gotta go the pillar of fire is the anointing paragraph 107. now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God the prophet talks about in the original how that there was a great big Fountain of Light and out of that Fountain of Light came the logos that logos came from that light that light was the word that light was God it would become God right so the pillar of fire is the logos which doesn't have a body of its own that went out of God so when you have the anointing that's the logos of God that's that Spirit Light life that went out you have a part of that in you that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God when you are anointed you are anointed with that logos which is a manifestation or you might call it a demonstration of who God is the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God we might add without a body because when the fullness of God the logos was made flesh when it was given a body the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so in Jesus was father and Jesus was son and Jesus was Holy Ghost the Bible tells us in him dwelt the fullness not one of the attributes not one of the offices not one of the personalities all of God all of God in Jesus in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily someone give us that scripture reference and let us read let us tell it out in case someone is watching this service and not familiar with that verse of scripture in him uh throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily so we can give that because there may be someone watching this who's never heard that verse of scripture like that and you might want to go back and read it for yourself who can give me the address Colossians 2 9 Colossians 2 9. all right let's go on now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God paragraph 107. the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God when God become into a form now that's unusual wording there we can leave off the bee and we can say came instead of come and we can say when God came into a form to where it could be seen you follow that it was the anointing of the great spirit we're not talking about the Native American great spirit unless the Native American is talking about God Our God the one true Living God we're talking about the great spirit being the eternal spirit of the father it was the anointing of that great spirit that went forth it's condescending coming down God the Father the logos that was up over Israel he was holy could not bear sin are you still with me there had to be a blood offering right in Eden remember some Lambs had to die to cover the nakedness of Adam and Eve right so there was a blood offering there and then also Abel had a blood offering there God had the first Blood offering Abel had the next blood offering then the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us that's John 1 14. and where this logos dwelt in a human body which was the sacrifice when man was made in the image of God and then God came down in the image of man to redeem man beautiful that you got to read that that and god let's do it again together that brought man and God together what brought man and God together when God came down in the image of a man when the logos became flesh when the word became flesh Heaven and Earth heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other big sloppy wet kisses when Heavens came down and Earth and hugged each other when God became banned when the Heavenly broke forth into the Earthly when eternity stepped into time come on God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship no eternal sonship Jesus was an eternal part of who God is but he was not an eternal son there's no such thing as an eternal son you can't always be a son there has to be a begetting there has to be a birth there has to be a creating so yes Jesus was is the son of God was eternal in the sense that he was the image of God the express image of God correct but as a son he was not Eternal do you follow that there was a time and brother random was telling us when that time was When Heaven and Earth hugged and kissed each other when God became a baby in a Manger There It Is God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us oh my goodness what kind of a God we serve I want you to help me now what kind of a god do we serve did he come down he loved us so much that he stripped himself of the royal Robes of Eternity and said I'm going to Dawn the Robes of an Earthly Fallen man just a man of Flesh just a man of passion just a man of emotion but I'm gonna do that Son of God is going to become a son of man that the Fallen sons of men might become the sons of God Jesus said paragraph 109 I came from God and I go to God is that right after his death burial resurrection and Ascension when the body was taken up to sit at the right hand of God now I don't mean God's got a right hand God's a spirit remember the right hand of God is a place of power and authority it's a symbolic place the right arm of God the right hand of God that's where Jesus is all right but at the right hand means in power and authority of God that in that name what name Jesus Yeshua that in that name everything in heaven is named after it the Bible tells us the whole family of Heaven is named after him so why in the world would you want to be baptized in a title of father when the father has taken on a name why would you want to be baptized in the name of a son which is not a name at all when the son has taken on a name why would you want to be baptized in the title of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has taken on a name the whole family of God is named after him ice cream you included if you've gone down in a watery grave Hallelujah you came up Mrs Jesus Christ you go down in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost you come up a confused sinner there's only one thing that can transform you and it's not water it's the blood and you've got to be able to identify where the blood came from it doesn't come from father it was created and it's named Jesus Christ even the blood has a name even the word has a name isn't that good that in the name that in that name everything in heaven is named after and subject to it everything in Earth is named after it and subject to it a name above all names and we know that name is Jesus Christ we're not ashamed of that we're thankful very very very thankful right now the logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God and let me tell you something about those sons of God they are anointed oh yes with the same logos same Pillar of Fire same anointing same logos same God this Holy Ghost In You is God he said so the word teaches us it's not a watered-down version it's not a piece of apportion it's him Amen in the message the seed shall not be aired with the shut paragraph 32 thank you for staying with me I will never get to the text this morning but we'll get a good foundation and be ready for it when we come back you he wasn't even God is an object of worship now this throws people because brother Branham is trying to make a point that in order for God to be God there had to be a creation to worship him well that to me makes a whole lot of sense and God quickly took care of the problem but before he was God and in the sense that there was something created to worship him you were not the first thing created to worship God he created angels in the Heavenly Host to worship him before he had a people or a creation that could worship him he was logos he was the word he was God but not worshiped as God so don't let that throw you in any shape form or fashion and the logos logos we call it the word that went out of God that anyone knows that that was the what that was the angel of the Lord so now we have the anointing is the logos the pillar of fire is the anointing powerful all the same different manifestations of The Same Spirit and now we learn that the logos was that word that went out of God that was the angel of the Lord so the angel of the Lord is the logos the angel of the Lord is the anointing the angel of the Lord is the word that went out from God isn't that right we're pulling it all together right don't don't don't get confused it's just how many spirits of the Lord are there different manifestations according to Isaiah 11 2. but the same God the same Spirit of the Lord it all falls under the category even the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of mind the spirit of counsel all those mentioned in Isaiah 11 do they all fall under the cat of the fear of the Lord all that falls under the category of the spirit of the Lord so these other things are not different Spirits even though the Bible refers to them as the seven spirits of God they're all a part of the spirit of the Lord together for us and he's saying that was also the angel of the Lord or the word of the Lord that followed the Israelites through the wilderness one generation ago there was a Ministry on the earth it couldn't do anything of itself had to wait on the angel of the Lord to show up correct he had to wait on the logos to come he had to wait on the pillar of fire to come he had to wait on the word of the Lord to come so he said you know I'm stalling I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him who him who the angel of the Lord who is the Angel of the lord it's the low gods what is the low God says that which came forth out of that great Fountain of Light is it physical form or Spirit form it's Spirit form but it Longs for a body form that's why John 1 14 is so important and the word became flesh so we see that Jesus was the fullness of the godhead he was the manifestation of the logos in an Earthly body that was the angel of the Lord or the word of the Lord that followed the Israelites through the Wilderness there he is and then he calls him the angel of the Covenant and that takes us to revelation 10. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from God out of Heaven come on put one foot on the land one on the sea declare that time would be no more the angel of the Covenant who is the Angel of the Covenant the logos the anointing the pillar of fire the angel of the Lord the word of God the Eternal Spirit of the Father the manifestation of the son the fullness of the Holy Ghost hero Israel somebody's sitting there or listening this this you got to be kidding me this is confusing no no no no no no no this is simplicity the church is confusing they've cut God up in so many pieces they'll never be able to pull him back together again we've seen what the word said he's one he's one somebody say he's one many offices many manifestations many demonstrations he can take on any form he chooses he can come in a body of Flesh like a man or he could come in a bush [Applause] but as long as God was in that bush that Bush was God [Applause] as long as that God was in that bush that Bush was deity oh come on you're getting it now I'm thankful for this I got to hurry I'm thankful for this he chose that bush for one afternoon he chose me for eternity [Applause] I'm not gonna crawl in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out of you I'm not just going to be God above you hanging like a pillar of fire I'm not just going to be Emmanuel God walking around with you in fleshly body of Jesus he said but I'm going to be God in you I'm gonna fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire the pillar of fire is living in the bride job then brother Glory the angel of the Lord the word of the Lord the angel of the Covenant Lord Jesus Christ that that's confusing I'll tell you what's confusing father's the first person of the godhead the son is the second person of the God Hand the Holy Ghost is the third person of the godhead that's confusing because we know Jesus is not the second person of the godhead he's the only person of the godhead the other two manifestations are Spirit not persons um when did it start I don't want to go too far in this don't know who's watching but when did this whole cutting up the pie start 325 A.D at the Nicene Council [Music] the same day same time that they accepted pagan holiday Expressions called Christmas same counsel the same counsel that they replace the The Old Rugged Cross for a Christmas tree the same counsel same same ministers meeting 325 A.D read it change the baptism change the godhead because so many pagans were coming to the faith and they didn't want to ask them I'd ask them they didn't want to ask them to give up their gods because they were ignorant and thought that you could have the one true Living God while still kind of coddling all of these other uh familial Gods because they thought they were traditional and you can't take a man out of his tradition that's what they thought so they cuddled they cuddled they refused to stand so I want you to know that some of the early church fathers that everybody brags about makes them such amazing Heroes I want you to know that many of them were confused and they let the church into confusion and that's why there had to be a Word of Promise that said I will restore what the caterpillar and the Pummel worm and the canker worm hath eaten that's why the bride tree had to be restored Hallelujah I'm yelling a lot forgive me I'm a Yeller I didn't say I'm yellow I said I'm a Yeller that was Angel Lord the word of the Lord that followed the Israelites through the Wilderness the angel of the Covenant the logos that went out of God brother Ram just put it all together my God that's not confusing and then that logos was made flesh and dwelt among us and what was that that was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God the manifestation of son but in that body throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily now we're in Saint John 1 and I was we read it in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and now as he gave his life for us then his spirit comes back upon us I don't have all the verses in front of me this morning didn't know where I would go but remember Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless in one place he said I'll pray the father and he'll send you a comforter in another place he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you why could he say that how could he say that how could he say I'll come to you because he did come the first time he came in body form the second time he came in spirit form same Jesus wonderful wonderful wonderful you see it's a multiplication That Old Devil had to deal with one Jesus until the day of Pentecost don't go crazy don't think I'm saying something blasphemous I I understand the difference I understand the difference and then I don't right I see there is a difference and then I see there's not a difference but I know where most of us are and we better emphasize the difference because we may not yet quite be ready to embrace the fullness of what the word's really teaching Us in this hour where we come from come on but we're coming up now we're in Saint John okay read all that uh gave his life for us then his Spirit comes back on us upon us Jesus said at that day you'll know at that day you'll know that I'm in the father I'm in the father the father in me I in you [Laughter] [Music] and you and me so I said that is so confusing no no it's really not no it's really not a paragraph 33 see it's God all along God manifesting himself working himself through different ages so those three of Father Son and Holy Spirit same God working in three attributes we know that don't we let's go on and we today are one can we go back Austin so these three Father Son and Holy Spirit same God working in three attributes period now and we today are one how could it be because Jesus said I'm in the Father the father's in me I'm in you you're you're in me and I'm in you an attribute of God's thinking before the foundation of the world to have a church so those which are in Christ are you in Christ let me ask how many are here today in Christ how did you get in Christ not by joining a church how did you get in Christ by praying a little sinner's prayer no that was only an entrance that was only a beginning you can't be in Christ unless you're born again you can't be fully you can't be fully born again without the fullness of his Spirit you can't have the fullness of his Spirit without having the fullness of his word so there are going to be many around us and Among Us and and and in this world that have the spirit of God the holy spirit of God fall on their flesh and that's powerful and that'll make you do all kinds of things they're going to be those that the Holy Spirit goes all the way down into the realm of the mind and the will and the emotions and that's powerful but where we really must show the attributes where where the rubber beats the road where things are really put to the test it's when we understand the Regeneration of the human spirit again I recognize that some replace the two they sort of describe them the same as I do but they replace the two and they have uh flesh Spirit soul but I'm going to do what he said I'm going to take everything he said back to the word and the word tells me that it's Body Soul spirit Spirit on the inside of the inside of the inside and so we've got to have an anointing that's rubbed all the way in it's not just getting the spirit on your flesh it's not just getting it in your emotion it's when your inner man has been completely regenerated the Fallen Spirit of man has been completely regenerated by his spirit and what that does is it actually creates a new spirit one with him that's really being born again and I'm I I'm not sorry to tell you but I I have to tell you that without the fullness of the word you won't see your need if you don't have the revelation of this message you won't see your need and you'll think that a little tongue talking is all it takes or a little jumping around feeling good is all it takes but if you understand the word that God has sent to us you'll understand that a transformation has to take place on the inside of the inside that's where the real work of regeneration takes place and it works itself out it works itself out it's not an outward work going in it's an inward work coming out it's not dressing the part and then dealing with the rest it's getting it in here and letting that flow out are you still with me good we've got a little more time so those which are in Christ was in Christ at the beginning that was his thoughts and his thoughts is his attributes that's good now paragraph 79 uh the sermon is the same seed shall not be aired with the shut he goes on to say he was God the logos the word that went out of God when it began to brood upon the Earth remember we just mentioned that and brought forth marine life when the spirit of God below Goss the word which God said let there be and there went out the logos there went the logos which is the word so when God spoke that logos went out to perform to accomplish and the word began to cause all this excuse me because all this was in the logos the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age and as the logos began to breathe upon the Earth there came marine life and building up the bird life on up to animal life remember what he was really doing is restoring the word that had already been spoken and the seed that lay beneath the surface of the water and finally there comes something in the representation or look like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it God a man in the very image of God we know him as Adam or Adam because he was made of the red Earth that man fell like the seed has to fall you don't miss that what's he talking about the seed has to fall the Bible said a seed has to fall into the Earth because there are many sons to come the son becomes a seed and the seed is there for a harvest to follow and then then God uh began to brood over that after the fall he brought up an Enoch he brought up an Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought a prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again what image a man in the likeness and in the image of God that's what he was trying to restore because Adam Lost That Glory he lost that Glory are you with me good I'll hurry and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was God Jesus the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us praise God now in paragraph 81 he said now that same logos has a part he has got a bride wait a minute wait a minute whoa that same logos has a part there's a part in that logos there's a portion in that logos and the portion in that logos is the bride same seed and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with it's brooding over the churches today see him see him making love trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation now now what is the word in its full manifestation a man in the image and likeness of God Adam was one Fallen seed he went into the ground Jesus was one seed went into the ground it's time for the manifestation and the multiplication of that seed to come forth which will be as brother skip said in the back sons of God and those sons of God will be men women made in the image and the likeness of God and because we won't have time to get to where I want to go today let me just give you a little a little teaser here and that is and when that when that group of people begin to move in Divine synchronization with the word of the hour of the word of God the logos Among Us when they begin to move in Divine synchronization with that word what they say she will have the saith the Lord or she will keep still what is thus say of the Lord that's his talk that's what he says it's the same that's what the sons of God are executed here for to manifest that Authority what Authority the authority of sonship it's the placing of Sons Sons are being placed right now sons are being placed right now positioned right now in the Kingdom yeah just wait just wait that's why you've got to run away from the world and run to the word that's why you've got to hear this word every day that's why you got to spend a few minutes every day in the book you got to get in that holy book you've got to let that book talk to you come on you've got to sit under the anointed word for the hour you need to do it every day turn off the idiot box somebody said I don't have time you got time for that you got time for a game to play nothing wrong with fun don't go paranoid don't go pan again don't get religious you need a moment you need a time you need to defragment you need some singing or or or or some some fun nothing wrong nothing wrong with pulling away and relaxing a little bit but if we are left without any accountability we'll live like chill pills we'll live like couch potatoes making no time I'm preaching now making no time for the word how are you and I going to come for speaking that word if we're not eating that word you are what you eat and you speak what you are [Music] that same logos has a party has got a bride and that same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word of God to its full manifestation let's go on which the prophets was carriers to that seed and the church denominations has been carriers to the seed now now notice quickly but like the shuck hugs I don't let people rebuke and and criticize and and spend all their Time Cursing the shook because the shuck is is a protector he calls it a carrier but it's more than just a carrier it's actually the protection it hugs the seed it protects it from the elements you have to pull that shuck off and brother that's where we are right now we're in shuck shedding time the shuck is pulling away from the seed come on and the Shucks got to go it's got to go thank you thank you for the shock but it has to go now because when you got that ear in your hand you have a multiplication of the original seed that was planted in the dirt that corn is a multiplication of what you put in the dirt a seed of corn you put in a kernel of corn now you got about 300 kernels of corn and how many ears off of a stalk multiple ears coming off of a stalk you take care of it you can have another another Bloom another Harvest come on and the church denominations has been carriers to the seed now thank you Chuck thank you my old churches thank you all my old systems where I were thank you thank you thank you for protecting me didn't feel like I was being protected but thank you anyway it felt like he was constantly trying to throw me out because I didn't do like you did but nonetheless God says the church denominations have been carriers to the seed now now notice quickly but like the shuck hugs holds in the seed now then what does it do then it leaves her Jesus was God he was his father was the great logos itself and he could not pour it all in Moses or he was a prophet and the word of the lord always never fails comes to the prophet there is no place no time in the Bible or since the Bible that the correct interpretation of the word comes to a theologian it's not in the scriptures never did the Pharisees never did the Sadducees and never did God raise a prophet out of any of them and never did he in the last days so seminaries are not producing today's Prophets didn't produce yesterdays won't produce the days what do you mean today's I'm not talking about major word prophets I'm not talking about Messengers to Angels I'm talking about five full prophets they're still prophets they still fit in the category and seminaries aren't hatching them out now let me read just a little more here and maybe I should close we'll see uh I know you're ready and of course of course you are but I I I don't want to leave in such a place that we can't uh kind of finish this Tuesday night if that would be the will of the Lord so let me read from the exposition of the seven Church ages the smyrnian church age according to Romans 4 16 we find that God has given a sure promise to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he said he says Abraham who is the father of us all we're talking about one new man now that's what the New Testament Covenant is about one new man then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed plural children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election or the choosing of God didn't he say you have not chosen me but I have chosen you all right and then and that is exactly what we have been saying those who are of the royal seed are the elect of God or the predestinated foreknown of God and we're in the mind of God and in his thoughts now in very plain language listen carefully in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body beautiful beautiful thus this bride thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride powerful and though she is feminine in designation as bride she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now boy that's good and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ not anymore one member December 1965 the one man Ministry ceased it can never be it will never be it must never be a one-man Ministry ever again it must be a body Ministry for she is a many membered body praise God whereas God once was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now he goes on last paragraph now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the God dead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh if you believe that same man and thereby gain the title of son even so we even so we even so we even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed he was the original spoken word seed but even even in the same manner we are so Eternal in his thoughts in our turn in our specific age became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh oh my oh my oh my you were seed before you were flesh was Jesus seed before he was flesh now we understand by the word you were seed before you were flesh beautiful chip off the old block and though oh this is so beautiful and in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are thee are you listening are thee are thee are thee are thee are the and now those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called now look at this we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were Reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken why why because God saw their choice because God knew their thoughts he saw their rejection of him before they were ever born Our God to his infinite in his foreknowledge he saw that they and therefore they came to this Earth with no representation of the Original Seed and therefore there was nothing in them to Quicken so all the praying and all the fasting and all the track handing out and all the things that we do sometime you can only reach those who have a quickening seat a seed that can be quickened come on now somebody said that's a serious thing folks this is a serious word now here is where you better listen to your preacher God is not sending you to the bar just real simple it's just real plain you say somebody's got to tell them somebody's got to reach them somebody's got to do this somebody's got to do that like I told you the other day people will tell me what I don't drink I just go and play pool I just go cause I like the music let me tell you something the true seed of God cannot stand the atmosphere that's produced by the filth of this world you stand in the parking lot if you feel like God is sending you you'll be there to reach somebody on the outside you don't put yourself in that atmosphere unless you know that you know that you know that you know that you know where you're standing with God there better not be one hook in you I was in a spiritual experience one time and I met a friend of mine in the spirit now this is this is heavy for some of you that don't understand that realm which I'm one of them that don't understand it but I met a friend in that Realm I was going in One Direction he was going another and he was struggling like this really struggling and I said to him what's wrong what's wrong with you and he said oh there's nothing wrong with me and he turned and when he turned I saw the treble hook that had cooked hooked him in the back and God revealed to me the three things that had hooked him in the back and he was just twisting and turning and twisting and turning and twisting and turning a whole whole experience I won't go into all that experience but I I sat with that man my wife was with me and we sat with him and we told him the experience and and even uh you know gave some pretty good uh Insight thank you on to where these hooks were and why they were there and how they got there and how they were manifesting and he looks at me and says well I can't imagine what that is something in me screaming you're lying you're lying you're lying you're lying I don't believe that we're walking around with hooks in our in our spiritual lives that we don't know are there I believe we know I believe we know and I believe we're foolish to keep putting ourselves in the same environment and in the same situation that causes that hook to tighten a little bit if you're gonna listen this is powerful words that Jesus spoke to Peter and I know that some of you are stirred at me that's okay I'm big I can handle it Jesus gave some interesting words to the Apostle he said and when thou art converted now remember in the church we thought that just meant pray the sinner's prayer and you're converted but conversion is more than praying the sinner's prayer true conversion is actually the born-again experience and the born-again experience is more than just speaking in tongues or saying the Holy Spirit has come it's when your inner man that Spirit of man that Fallen Spirit has been regenerated by the eternal spirit of God and you're delivered you are delivered you're delivered you're delivered and a man that is truly delivered a man that is walking in True Deliverance ought to be able to go anywhere in any environment in any atmosphere with anybody and be who he was created to be but until that until you know that you're there and you're hopeless I can just hear the how the mighty are Fallen how the mighty are Fallen I have no clue I I don't know what you're talking about now fast forward a few months wife gone marriage destroyed Ministry in shambles not not years less than three four months sitting in your place in the beach and he looks back across the table I owe you an apology what you saw those hooks I told you I couldn't imagine where what they were and I knew in that moment exactly what you saw and I want to apologize to you now I'm nothing I just had a great love for that brother great great love for that brother God showed me that because he thought God knew me he knew I'd share it and I did now the man lost a whole lot he may never fully recover he may get out of here with the salvation of his soul but he may never fully recover from a moment that could have been dealt with a little prayer a little Deliverance a little confession a little repentance little forgiveness God gave him an opportunity to get it from out from under the pull of the drugs God gave him an opportunity to get out from the pull of sexual perversion God gave him that opportunity and God gives us an opportunity to come to Total Deliverance and unless we know we're walking there we need to be very careful where our influence comes from because the enemy wants you to fail here's the thing you can thank God for he doesn't crawl in and crawl out you ain't a bush you were his son from before the foundation of the world who can't lose him he can't lose you [Applause] he'll find you if you make yourself findable he'll restore you if you make yourself restorable if you will correct your path he will forgive you and deliver you and cause you to help others find their way to Deliverance amen we have to be careful who we yoke with and how we yoke ourselves to these kind of spirits if you were here this morning and you've got a little lustful thing that you battle with in your life then you've got to be careful in all of your friendships in all of your relationships don't ever let a woman put her hands on you that you're not married to you you tell her right up front you tell because the world is slick don't ever be alone in a place with just a woman that's not your wife same way woman don't you be alone in a room with a man like that that's not your husband without somebody right near you

said let not your good be evil spoken of come on you don't have to be paranoid my grandmother was a bit paranoid she locked the door between cousins I mean she was just always you know just extra on the guard she would have been real real helpful in 2023 but I don't want you to become paranoid but I want you to be wise because there's an enemy that wants to cheat you out of some of your destiny I

you're just out running up and down the roads hear him there's a better remedy for that someone said what should I do find you another room to go in close the door get out on your knees pray read the Bible hear the message of the hour refuse to give in to the Temptation and urges of this old world don't you let the devil run you out of your house go get the other end if you were mad with your wife and your husband and fighting away go get the other in the house but don't go riding up and down the roads don't go searching the internet When You Know You're vulnerable you've got to strengthen yourself why because you have a calling and you have a Destiny and you have a purpose in this hour and God does want to use you to reach people in those horrible places but you can't do it if you're as vulnerable as they are you've got to be filled up filled up with light filled up with light get get in the house of God worship don't miss so many services come in here and worship you know someone

your way you'll overcome musicians are coming oh foreign you were born for this day you're born for this purpose for this season for this hour if you think the enemy is going to lay down and play dead

you jump up and smell like Jesus he's going to fight you every step of the way but I want you to know what the prophet reminded us of he's no match for you [Music] say it again under my feet he's an old match for this little bride everything she needs to make the Rapture is inner even now and when you fall away you just fight your way back to his arms he's not scolding you he's a redeemer by Nature he's a forgiver that's who he is you condemn yourself but he doesn't condemn you but get back to God as quick as you can and I love it I love it when people have some struggles or troubles or whatever and they come back to church and they just worship the old devil will say well they know they know you're you know they know you've been struggling they know you've been going through some
