Who do I lean on? When there's no foundation stable, I go to the rock cuz I know he's able. I go to the rock. Then I go to the rock of my salvation. Go to the stone that the build is protected. I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me. And when the earth all around me is sinking sand on Christ the solid rock I stand. When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Then where do I hide till the storms have all passed over? Where do I run to when those winds of sorrow threatened? There is a reuge. Oh, in your time of tribulation. When my soul needs consolation, I'll go to the rock. Well, then I'll go to the rock of my salvation. Go to the stone that the village rejected. I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me.

G. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to serve the living God. &gt;&gt; Do you have a need as we're getting ready to pray today that you would just like to make known by the lifting of the hand all over the building out across the stream? The Lord sees the needs that you have. He knows what they are and he knows best how to take care of them. Yes, &gt;&gt; he does. Yes. &gt;&gt; I may not know the details, &gt;&gt; but my Lord does. &gt;&gt; He does. &gt;&gt; He was the one who fearfully and wonderfully created us &gt;&gt; and he knows all about us. He knows how to take care of us. &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless you. Can you just lift your hands into his presence? [Music] Brother Elum, will you come and lead us in prayer today? So, we just take a moment, another moment to worship the Lord, to give him the praise that he deserves. &gt;&gt; Coming into his presence with thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; thanking him for all of his wonderful works. Holy Lord. &gt;&gt; He's a God that likes memory. He likes us to remember what he already has done. &gt;&gt; But he doesn't want us to just live there. &gt;&gt; He wants us to bring it up to today that he is today as he was yesterday &gt;&gt; the same. And he will be the same tomorrow &gt;&gt; as he is today. Let's join our faith together as our brother leads us in prayer today. G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dear us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we come before you with humble hearts this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just we want to give you praise, Lord, for all that you've done for us already, Lord. &gt;&gt; And for what you will do, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we go further, &gt;&gt; Lord, even this day, let your hand be here upon us. Yes. &gt;&gt; Let it continue, Lord, as you already were here in our midst. &gt;&gt; We just pray for more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your anointing to be so strong here today, Lord, &gt;&gt; that it changes us on the inside. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, that our hearts can be drawn to you. &gt;&gt; To go deeper, Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, to to &gt;&gt; Lord, where we need more cleansing. &gt;&gt; Cleanse us, Lord. do it, &gt;&gt; Lord. Where there's areas in our lives that have not been fully surrendered, &gt;&gt; we pray that today, &gt;&gt; you would help us, Lord, &gt;&gt; to just give it all, &gt;&gt; to just give it all to you and let you have your way in our hearts, Lord. And Lord, if there's areas we're unaware that we still need to change, &gt;&gt; Lord, we open those to you, too. Lord, as as that uh Lord, that one night when we were in prayer and I just saw you like going before us, Lord, and we come to this uh maybe a Y in the road and if we don't yield, we get before you and you want to go first, Lord. So, help us to just yield &gt;&gt; and come after you, Lord. Come behind you, Lord, and let you lead the way. &gt;&gt; You lead the way, &gt;&gt; Lord. We don't always know how it should be. So, we just ask that you help us to yield &gt;&gt; and let you go before us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you. We give you praise this morning for you are worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray that you speak today &gt;&gt; through our brother. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you take control, &gt;&gt; that you have the preeminence in this place and that you reign and that you touch every heart. We give you all the glory in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How we praise you Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today.

He's merciful and kind and we're thankful that he worked among us last night. But last night was last night. We rejoice in what happened last night. But we came again today because God is a God of today as he was yesterday. And he wants to minister and speak to us once again today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're thankful that he still speaks. &gt;&gt; He is not a deaf mute. &gt;&gt; He has a voice and he can hear when we cry to him. And I want to be able to have ears to hear him when he speaks. And I'm thankful that he is still speaking. So Olivia, you want to bring the children and we'll let them get ready. F please. Once again, we welcome you into the house of the Lord. And today may be just a little bit different, but we've come to worship and magnify the Lord &gt;&gt; because he is good. He is always good. [Music] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim way for the hand of God in all my life I see. And the reason of my bliss. Yes. The secret all is this that the comforter abides with me. Oh, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the milker way. For the comforter abides with me. Once my heart was full of sin. Once I had no peace within. Till I heard how Jesus died on the tree. Then I fell down at his feet and there came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides with me. Oh, he abides. He abides. Hallelujah. He abides with me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the pilgrim way. For the comforter abides with me.

Steven Yantis, can I call on you and Ian McFarland to go to the people as we are continuing to worship the Lord, preparing our heart for the preaching of the word. You know, we could say a lot of things, but the word of God endures forever. My words may fail, but his do not. &gt;&gt; And we are sure grateful to be in a place where the truth of the word of God is preached. &gt;&gt; We heard it last night, and I believe we're going to hear it again tonight, today, and we want to hear it as much as possible because it's what changes us from glory to glory. He's changing me. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you as you give to the Lord today. Father, I pray that you will bless the people as they give to you. May it be multiplied back into their homes. May the blessing of the Lord rest upon them and in their homes. Uh God, I thank you that you multiply what is given for the purposes of the kingdom. And it's in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing this old hymn with us as you're giving your tithe and offering today. Oh Lord my God, [Music] when I in all wonder consider all the world thy hands have made. I see the stars. I hear the rolling thunder. Thy power throughout the universe displays. and sings my soul, my Savior God to thee. How great thou are. [Music] How great thou are. and sings my soul, my Savior God to thee. [Music] How great thou art. How great thou art. When through the woods and forest glades I wonder and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees. When I look down from lofty mountain grand and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze. and sings my soul, my Savior God to thee. How great thou are. How great thou are. and sings my soul. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; How great thou are. How great thou art. And when I think that God is so not sparing, and when I think that God is so not sparing, sent him to die. I scarce can take it. Think about what he did for you &gt;&gt; that on the cross my burden gladly bury. He bled and died [Music] to take away my sin. Would you stand together with us if you can? Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee. How great thou are. How great thou are. and light is my soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, my soul sings to you. How great thou are, how great thou are. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Give the Lord another praise. Hallelujah. He's worthy. Hallelujah. Isn't he worthy this morning? &gt;&gt; You may be seated. He is wonderful and worthy to be praised. You you may wonder why we're up and down a lot. Uh but we do it because we want to show honor and respect to the creator. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's worthy. &gt;&gt; You know, you may not be British, but if the a and no matter how you feel about Charles, he's still the king, &gt;&gt; not of this nation. But if he were to walk in this room, there would be many of us who would stand not to honor his character, but to honor his office. &gt;&gt; I was tested on that very point. I was in Washington with my wife some years ago and uh the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, he came into the room, and I'm not Israeli, but I respect the office that he held then and that he still holds today. and I stood up. That's what you should do. It's just respect. If the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords was in the midst, you're not standing for a preacher. &gt;&gt; You're standing to give honor to the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. Then the next day, the the uh current president of the United States, Barack Obama, he came into the room where we were, just a few feet from where we were standing. He was not a president that I particularly was fond of. had nothing to do with his race or his place of birth or any of the other controversial things. I did appreciate his stand for Israel, but he was just really making some poor decisions in my opinion. But I never hesitated, not even one second to stand up because it wasn't the man. Brother Brandham tells us, not the man. We're honoring the office that he holds. I tell you what a privilege to be able I I prayed with the musicians in the back this morning and I was overwhelmed with this thought. Thank you Lord. I woke up today in my right mind. &gt;&gt; I knew where I was. &gt;&gt; I knew who I was. &gt;&gt; When I began to see my family, I recognized them. &gt;&gt; I knew who they were to me. And I don't want to take that for granted because there's many people who woke up this morning and that was not their condition. &gt;&gt; God is good. He is faithful. He is gracious. He is worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, would you say amen? &gt;&gt; Didn't the children do a wonderful job? my not only not only the the small ones, but the the young adults who came and sang afterwards. We we've called them the the younger young people, &gt;&gt; but uh the reality is that the the old youth group is uh mostly married with children. So that isn't really the younger young people. I hate to tell you Ben and Zach and I hate to tell you that is the young people &gt;&gt; but it it just changes you know uh we we are blessed because our babies have many of them have stayed with us and they have grown up and they have married somebody else's babies and they have had some babies and uh and have stayed. It's our idea of church growth. &gt;&gt; That's how we do it. God is good. He is faithful. We are thankful this morning. Very thankful. &gt;&gt; Uh today among the Jewish community is tishav. It is the day that the Jewish people around the world remember the destruction of the temple which has some significance to us as well. And so we look at that. time in scripture. It's also the end of the season of the dire straits. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That squeezing time that is commemorated on the calendar every year and uh it's sometimes felt by intercessors and we're very thankful that it has once again come to an end. You have blessed us to be here this weekend. We appreciate your presence here and we want to invite you to our camp meeting in October of this year during the tabernacles time, October 7th through 12th. Now, somebody will text before bedtime and ask, "What were those dates again?" They're on the app. They're on the web page. And they're where you're writing them down right now or typing them in right now so that you don't miss October the 7th through the 12th. That's a Tuesday night to a Sunday morning. We'll be having food and fellowship in the evening after the service. And then on Friday night, there will not be a service here in the sanctuary, but we're going to have a banquet on Friday night, which is the 10th of October. And uh we're going to celebrate 35 years of ministry here at in at New Hope Revival Ministries and 50 years of public ministry. So, you're going to want to be here because it's going to be a special time. There may be pictures, there may be mmentotos, and there may there may be bloopers. May maybe you're going to want to hear them, see them if there are. Can you imagine all the all the mistakes that have been made on camera in 50 years? I'm glad a lot of that uh uh is so tightly packed away that no one is getting to it. I know that for sure. I hold the key. How about that? That's good. &gt;&gt; But we want you to come and be with us. We believe that God is going to meet us in a very special way. Would you like some good news? &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus is Lord. That's good news. &gt;&gt; But there is other good news in our midst today. Uh Stephen and Lydia, would you all stand up and let everybody see you all? I'm sure you've noticed that they have migrated to the same pew this weekend. Giving you a hint. I'm pleased to announce that our sister Lydia and our brother Stephen are engaged to be married later this year. Let's congratulate them. [Music] We're very happy. We believe that God knows exactly what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So naysayers, push them out. &gt;&gt; You ought to believe in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why? Why? They're coming from two different communities." Yes, in many ways. But in many ways, they're coming from the very same family. That's right. &gt;&gt; The family of God, &gt;&gt; the bloodbought, &gt;&gt; the redeemed of the Lord, &gt;&gt; and this is a relationship. These wonderful saints in Indiana, Brother Elum, you're representing them. Brother Amos representing them here today. They are not just uh fellow believers, but they're family to us. &gt;&gt; And the fellowship that God has given us these years has been absolutely a blessing. And uh we believe that this is spiritual and somewhat prophetic. &gt;&gt; And uh we sometimes have to get up above ourselves to discern the will of God. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to nod a little while while you register what I'm saying. So we give my mighty praise to God. This is a week of birthdays and I'm not going to take the time to commemorate the birthdays of those who have gone on. and I would normally uh try to do that but we have some saints that we continue to remember. Sister will mention her uh this week but uh among those who are worshiping with us Mary Bethl where is Mary Beth? Mary Beth has a birthday uh this week and she on Tuesday and I didn't I didn't write down any number so would you just say happy birthday to sister Mara. Sister Teresa, some of your children know that you were born on August the 6th. I doubt very many of them know what day of the week that is. I tested David. I said, "What day this week is your mother's birthday?" I born on the 6th. So, I warned him. It's Wednesday, so he has time to get the card and the cake and the balloons and the and and the thank yous and everything else. Would you all just say happy birthday to Sister Teresa? Let's stand for the reading of God's word today. I know we are just slightly perhaps distracted. There is a lot that goes on in moving this pull pit because there are wires that connect it to various things and we just have to make up our mind not to lose any momentum in the spirit. &gt;&gt; I need more in this monitor please. Uh we want to just keep moving toward what the Lord has for us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For he is Lord. He is Lord. He has risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; He is Lord. Every knee, every knee shall &gt;&gt; shall bow. Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. You may not be able to sing this, but if you can, would you do it? He's my Lord. He's my Lord. I'm not changing songs. He my Lord. He has risen. He has risen from the dead. And he my Lord. Oh, every knee shallow &gt;&gt; it will &gt;&gt; every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is my Lord. Now sing this with with me. He's my Lord. There is no other one. Who can calm the storms of life like my Lord? Thank you Jesus. He give rest to the weary. Give new life to the hopeless. There's no doubt. No doubt about it. He's my Lord. One last time. Sing that with me. He's my Lord. He's my Lord. My Savior. There is no other one. Who can come &gt;&gt; like my Lord? &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. He give rest to the weary. Give new life to the hopeless. &gt;&gt; He's done that for some of us. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt, no doubt about it. &gt;&gt; He's mine. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He is. He is. He's my Lord. Would you thank the musicians for their labor? Hallelujah. I appreciate all of you. Turn in your Bibles while you're standing to Psalm 27 verse 5 and 6. We want to welcome all of you who are streaming the service across the nations of the world. I see the United Kingdom is represented largely this morning. We want to give thanks to God for South Africa, the Netherlands, many saints in Indiana, Uganda, more in Indiana, more in Indiana, Ghana, West Africa, it just goes on and on. God bless every Zambia. Wow. More from Cape Town. We just welcome every one of you. Thank you for being with us today. We appreciate it. Psalm 27. For in the time of trouble, he shall &gt;&gt; hide me in his &gt;&gt; pavilion. In the secret of his &gt;&gt; tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. Hallelujah. A rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle? What? &gt;&gt; Sacrifices of &gt;&gt; I I didn't I didn't know you could sacrifice joy. I knew you could sacrifice praise, but how do you sacrifice joy? You cannot unless you're in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; He has a hiding place. And in his hiding place, joy is a part of who you are. &gt;&gt; So you offer whatever you offer, you do it in the joy of the Lord. Didn't the Bible say, "The joy of the Lord is mine. I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the Lord. Father, we come to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. How we thank you for your wonderful presence in our midst. You have given us rest upon the bed last night and as mentioned, you woke us up in our right mind and we give you praise for that. You have met us again in the atmosphere of worship. And now as we approach the holy word of life, we ask that you would come and minister to us in a way that only you can. We take authority over every distracting spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. And we ask that you would pull our hearts and our minds together that you might speak to us. And that when we leave this place today for more fellowship and a meal among ourselves, may we leave here saying it was good to be in the presence of the Lord. We heard his voice and we know that he has spoken to us today. This is our desire. We ask for your help alone in the name above every name, the name of our Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; let's let's do it again. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." You may be seated. As we mentioned to you last night, Psalm 27 is a very particularly special one of the Psalms in the rapture message in July, I believe, of uh 65 when brother Brandham was preaching this one of the last public messages of his ministry and he titled it the rapture. As we were coming to a close last night, we mentioned that he mostly anybody referring to resurrection or rapture, they would use Corinthians. They would use Thessalonians. They would speak about Enoch being translated, Elijah being caught away in a chariot drawn by horses of fire. But the spirit of the Lord led this prophet to a particularly unusual place to preach one of his last messages on the earth to help us understand that the rapture is not just an event, &gt;&gt; but it is a position. &gt;&gt; I want you to hear what the spirit of the Lord might want to say to you today. It's not just an event, &gt;&gt; but it is a position. &gt;&gt; It is a place of rest in him. &gt;&gt; We hear uh many times, several times in the message, we we hear him indicating to us that the rapture is in &gt;&gt; it's in progress. It's in process. it meaning that it's not just the twinkling of an eye, the batting of an eye, and we're out of here, &gt;&gt; but there's a change that must take place in us &gt;&gt; to be ready for that event. &gt;&gt; So, we want to see it not as just a twinkling of an eye moment, but we want to understand that the word rapture doesn't appear in English in our translated Bible. But the concept of being captured, snatched up, caught up is the meaning of the word rapture. And I want you to know there is a revelation that God has sent to his people in this hour that catches them up a little bit higher than what's going on around them. &gt;&gt; When we are sitting under the revealed word of God, we are physically seated together in the house. But spiritually, the Bible tells us we have been raised up together and we are sitting together, seated together in &gt;&gt; in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; And where are those heavenly places found? &gt;&gt; In &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; He in the anointed one. in the manifestation of God in flesh. We are caught up to a higher place. &gt;&gt; And when we're caught up higher, we have this unique ability to praise no matter what's going on. &gt;&gt; We become Paul's and Silases. Come on. &gt;&gt; Not whipped and imprisoned in man's prison, but facing a lot of oppositions and a lot of persecutions and a lot of hardships in Satan's Eden where we are now living. &gt;&gt; But there's something about the revealing of Jesus Christ, his word becoming alive in his people &gt;&gt; that for a few moments we are caught a little higher. &gt;&gt; We forget about the burdens. We forget about the bills that are due. &gt;&gt; Some of us do. &gt;&gt; We forget about people troubles and how awkward a meal is going to be with &gt;&gt; Uncle Alfred or whatever his name is. We forget about all of the different complications of our past and for a few moments we find ourselves in a transcended place. &gt;&gt; It's another realm. The Bible clearly tells us it's another realm. It's another dimension. Physically, we're just right here together. But spiritually, we move up into another place and we begin to receive something. If you if you think that I'm talking about a feeling, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a feeling because feelings are fickle. &gt;&gt; Feelings come and feelings go. We've got to find something more than an emotion. &gt;&gt; We've got to find something more than a feeling, a feel-good moment, a goosebumps on our arms, or whatever it is that you would use to describe a moment of pleasure, a moment of happiness, a moment of of feeling good. But it's more than that. It's an atmosphere where we can be changed. It's an atmosphere where our desires are finetuned and our priorities are rearranged as we come into a higher place of &gt;&gt; of surrender. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you all to turn turn it down now just a little bit in the monitor. I'm so sorry. We're having a hard time getting it just right. And uh I've turned it toward the wall because it's so loud and uh it it distracts just a little bit because I don't want to scream in such a way that you can't hear the words, but I don't want to put so much energy into it that I don't have a voice later uh to to say God bless you and to greet you. So uh forgive us for trying to get it just right. Oh, the Lord is good to help us, isn't he? Now when we start looking at Psalm 27 as a rapture scripture, &gt;&gt; we understand that we are not just waiting on a rapture, but we are somehow exper experiencing rapture. &gt;&gt; It's a caught up. It's a catching up. It's an exaltation. It's being moved up a little bit higher. And I can say with all my heart, it's in progress. &gt;&gt; I've experienced it most recently, a moment of being just caught up into a place where you just would like to stay there all day long. &gt;&gt; Never have to answer another text. &gt;&gt; Never have to check another Facebook status. &gt;&gt; Never have to answer another phone call. Just let me stay right here in the presence of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we have that, we're having moments of rapture. &gt;&gt; I want you to say moments of rapture. &gt;&gt; Moments of rapture. &gt;&gt; The reason why we're looking at it in such an elementary way is because after all these years, we're still programmed to think of it as some glorious morning &gt;&gt; one day way out there. And it will be. There will be a culmination. &gt;&gt; There will be a consummation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; But there is a preparation because Christ is descending. It's an ing. &gt;&gt; It's an ing with his word. &gt;&gt; He is descending in his word. &gt;&gt; And according to the scripture, we're living under the voice &gt;&gt; of the archangel. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to understand that that's not just a prophet's voice, &gt;&gt; but that is the voice of a prophetic people. &gt;&gt; God has sounded a message in a trumpet to gather his people together. And now that people are finding fellowship under the voice of a five-fold ministry all over the world. &gt;&gt; And it is our duty to echo what the trumpet has sounded. Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's also our duty to recognize the moving of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; The blowing of the spirit wind. &gt;&gt; Amen. to understand the times and the seasons of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, don't you sit here this morning and even consider how somebody else is taking this. &gt;&gt; You see if you can take a piece of it for yourself. &gt;&gt; This is our hour. This is our day to catch what we can because we are changed by what we catch. &gt;&gt; I don't mean just like that. I mean in spirit &gt;&gt; here we laid a little introduction last night. We've got United Pentecostal people here last night. Baptist people sitting right up here on the front. And notice we didn't change the message one ounce. &gt;&gt; Can't do it. &gt;&gt; Can't adjust it based on who's in the crowd. &gt;&gt; Unless the spirit says, "I want to take you somewhere else." &gt;&gt; It's important to stay with the assignment until the assignment is finished. And the assignment is for you. The assignment is for me. There is a secret place in his tent, in his tabernacle, in his pavilion, in his refuge. There is a place for us. This is Bible language. &gt;&gt; It's scripture language. There is a place for us in the canopy or the nuptual chamber. There's a place for us in the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; In the tent within the tent or the room within the room, there is a place for us. &gt;&gt; You are a tripartate man. &gt;&gt; You also have three dimensions inside of you. Amen. A body of flesh, a soul that is mind, will and emotion, and a spirit. You were spirit first like Adam. The breath of God blew over Adam, body first, then spirit, and then man became after the breath of God, he became what? &gt;&gt; A living soul, mind, will, and emotions so that he could have contact with the environment around him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I know some people teach that a little bit different order, but we we we we won't even talk about that this morning. It's not important. I don't care what you call the inside of the inside. If you call it soul, that's fine. If you call it spirit, that's fine. But we need to understand how each part functions and how it relates to God. &gt;&gt; And your flesh is never going to tell you to come to church and serve the Lord. This body is never going to do that. It's always going to want five more minutes. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Just five more minutes, honey. &gt;&gt; Turn off the alarm. Just five more minutes. It's just the way we are. &gt;&gt; It's the way our flesh is. And then your soul's going to kick in. They won't miss me. &gt;&gt; They won't even know I'm not there. &gt;&gt; They don't even hardly shake my hand anyway. &gt;&gt; So why do I get out of this bed? And then there's something on the inside &gt;&gt; that says, "I'm not going there for the preacher. &gt;&gt; I'm not going there to hear the singing. &gt;&gt; I'm not going there to have my face on the stream. I'm going there because my creator is calling me to have fellowship with him like he had fellowship with Adam in the garden in the cool of the day, &gt;&gt; in the cool of the evening. When the when the busyiness of the day was coming to an end, the creator came and walked. &gt;&gt; That's rapture. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? That's rapture. &gt;&gt; It's fellowship with the divine. &gt;&gt; Now, one day, again, don't misunderstand, there's going to be a culmination. The dead in Christ shall rise &gt;&gt; first. We which are alive and remain will be changed. We'll be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't prevent us. We don't prevent them. They don't get there before we do if we're alive. We We arrive in the heavenlies at the same time before the King. &gt;&gt; But I don't have to wait until the end of the age &gt;&gt; to stand in his presence. &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait until the end of the age to experience a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when brother Brandon was going to leave the bride with a message concerning the rapture, he spoke about not a body change, &gt;&gt; but he chose a text that talks about a position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A place in the secret of his &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you put that back up and let us see? In the secret of his tabernacle shall he How many of you want to be hidden &gt;&gt; in him? &gt;&gt; He will lift me up &gt;&gt; above mine enemies, &gt;&gt; my my burdens, &gt;&gt; my worries. &gt;&gt; I will find myself in his pavilion. I'll go around my house and I'll start singing praises to the Lord. Not because I don't have a care in the world, &gt;&gt; but because I know what happens when I begin to mention him. &gt;&gt; When I begin to focus on him, he lifts us. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He wants to set you on a rock and give you a song. Hallelujah. How many of you need a rock? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're making some progress now. How many of you need a rock? &gt;&gt; How many of you want a song on the rock? &gt;&gt; I want a song. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know where it came from except from down within. Paul and Silas had no reason to sing. &gt;&gt; Beaten and jailed, wounds bleeding. And yet in the midnight hour, hallelujah. The body said, "I don't feel like praising the Lord." The soul said, "I I I expect the church is having supper about now. mind, will, and emotions. And yeah, they probably don't even care that we're over here suffering in the for the king, for the Lord. We're suffering. They're feasting while we're fasting. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They may not even know that's not the truth. They were being prayed for. &gt;&gt; The saints were praying for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, the body said, "I've never felt pain like this." The soul said, "Nobody even knows that we're not in the prayer meeting tonight. But something on the inside of the inside of the inside &gt;&gt; said, "Soul, you better hush. Body, you better bow. There's something that tells me that we have a reason and a right to give praise to our creator. For he is not only our creator, but he is our deliverer." &gt;&gt; And in the midnight, they sang praises to God. And what happened? Elvis wasn't anywhere to be found, but the jailhouse began to rock. &gt;&gt; The Bible said it began to rock &gt;&gt; as the power of God began to fall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what was a dire and desperate moment became an evangelistic service because Paul and Silas experienced a moment in the tabernacle. They experienced a moment under the tent. They experienced a moment in the hiding place with sacrifices of joy. They began to sing unto the Lord. They found themselves on the rock of ages. Hallelujah. With a song in their mouth. &gt;&gt; And God gave them deliverance. &gt;&gt; There's a bride. &gt;&gt; There's a bride. She's going to find that very same rapture moment. &gt;&gt; You may find it before you go home today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because every time you get caught up above your stuff, &gt;&gt; then biblically, you've had a moment of rapture. You've had a moment of ecstasy. You've had a moment that just takes you up a little bit higher. &gt;&gt; I used to hear them preach you, no one has ever been changed by a feeling. That's exactly right. The feeling is only a byproduct of an experience that has taken place. Don't ever let anybody, I don't care how many theologians come your way, don't ever let anybody talk you out of having your own personal experience with a living God. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Having an experience doesn't amount to anything. It may not for you, &gt;&gt; but it made a change in me. 7 years old when he reached down, filled me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and changed what I would have thought was the trajectory of my whole life. He did it. It was a moment of meeting. It was a moment of rapture. It was a moment in his tabernacle in his pavilion. He moved me from the holy place to the holiest of holies &gt;&gt; for just a moment, &gt;&gt; for just a season. And it changed everything. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; So, I'm not surprised at all that Brother Brandham chose Psalm 27. I think you and I ought to read the whole Psalm. I think we ought to ask the Lord to make it real to us. Maybe we ought to read it often. I mentioned last night that the Jews read it uh every day for 30 days leading up to the feast of trumpets. And that period of time is referred to as the wedding of the Messiah. And so even in Judaism, the wedding of the Messiah is not a one-time event. &gt;&gt; It's a process. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a moed. It's an appointment. It's a meeting with the Lord. But it doesn't happen in one moment and then finished. &gt;&gt; In fact, it repeats itself every year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Interesting. Every year there is a commemoration of the wedding between Messiah and his wife, his bride, which we know was originally the Hebrew people, the nation of Israel. &gt;&gt; But we understand that under the new covenant, there is neither a Jew or a Gentile. Isn't that New Testament? &gt;&gt; He has now made us what? one new man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Romans tells us that the middle wall of partition has been torn down and that we are now partakers of the same promises &gt;&gt; and the same covenant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What if you got a revelation that you could have a moment in the promised land before you land in the promised land? &gt;&gt; The Israelis did. The Hebrews did. What do you think that was? When God came down on the mountain and chauffars blasted and thunder sounded and lightning flashed and God was talking with his prophet. &gt;&gt; It was a moment of meeting. &gt;&gt; It was a moment of ecstasy. It was a moment of rapture. We could say it's not stretching it. &gt;&gt; It's a divine appointment with God. &gt;&gt; We need that. &gt;&gt; We need more of them. We need maximum effect. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be in a hurry. &gt;&gt; We need to wait on him and in his presence. Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; We want to be under those wings. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that there's glory &gt;&gt; under the wings of the cherubim? &gt;&gt; Underneath the wings of the cherubam. remember when God caught, if you read it, I mentioned it last night. I didn't put it in the notes for today, but I mentioned the sermon of Stephen. And he's preaching to these Jews who have rejected the Lord. And he's preaching to them about the the the pattern of the tabernacle that was given to Moses in heavenly places. He didn't receive that pattern on earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He received it in a moment of rapture. in a moment of ecstasy. &gt;&gt; He was caught up into a place like John was on the day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was in the spirit &gt;&gt; on the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Moses saw a pattern. &gt;&gt; God brought him back. It wasn't the final rapture for Moses. It was a moment of rapture. He comes back with a pattern and that pattern is executed. &gt;&gt; God raises up people who will hear the vision, who will receive the pattern, and who will say to that prophet, "We'll make it be so." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So it is written. &gt;&gt; So it be done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't help it. Every time I say that, it reminds me of Mr. web &gt;&gt; who came down here and everybody else said, "It'll never be. &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to build anything down there and and they just went and came and gone. Just goodbye then. God bless you." But here come Mr. Web, an Assembly of God man. &gt;&gt; And I described it to him. He said, "Where'd you get an idea like that?" I said, "It came by vision." &gt;&gt; How did you know it had to be here? Because it came by a vision. Right? &gt;&gt; He just stretched himself a little bit and he said, "Well, I'll tell you right now, if the preacher can see it, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can build it. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't this be our attitude of faith?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God sent a prophet who said there'd be a people in the last days who would experience a thunder revival just before they leave, &gt;&gt; then why wouldn't we believe it? &gt;&gt; I said if a prophet can see it, I want to lend myself to the vision. &gt;&gt; I want to position myself to be a part just a part. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be a big part. &gt;&gt; I'm probably going to be a loud part, &gt;&gt; but I don't have to be a big part. &gt;&gt; Just let me be a part. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand, I'm many years off the scene. But let me say, if you can see it, sir, &gt;&gt; I can lend myself to the vision. &gt;&gt; Now, I won't need an airplane to do it. I won't need a tent &gt;&gt; in mothballs &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; I won't need a one-man resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To do it. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. I tell you, he settled that for me when he simply said, "If Jesus Christ were to come here tonight and walk down that aisle, he couldn't do anything more for you tonight &gt;&gt; than what he's already done." &gt;&gt; You know, that ought to make you shout your shoes right off your feet. &gt;&gt; Because what that simply means is it's finished. &gt;&gt; No wonder we sing, "It's already done." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because by faith, &gt;&gt; it's a finished work. &gt;&gt; The vision has been seen &gt;&gt; and we're leaning into it &gt;&gt; and positioning ourselves. &gt;&gt; Many people have lived the rest of their life a generation ago, passed off the scene believing casual words that were spoken to them. I believe you'll be there. I believe you'll be there. Brother Brandon was known to say that to several. I believe you'll be there. While you'll drive the truck, why while you may be the front man just giving people these little assignments, he was doing that based on what he knew about them. &gt;&gt; He knew they were faithful. &gt;&gt; He knew they would stick with the word till the end. &gt;&gt; And he's just celebrating them in that moment. He wasn't prophesying. You see, every word that comes out of a prophet's mouth is not thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Every word Moses said wasn't thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a good thing &gt;&gt; because God had to use his woman. God had to use his wife &gt;&gt; to correct him. &gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn't want to be found correcting the prophet. Well, God used Moses wife. Come on. &gt;&gt; You've been a bloody husband to me. &gt;&gt; You knew circumcision was God's seal of covenant. &gt;&gt; And we got so busy that we didn't take time to keep our covenant with God. And now look at the curse that's come because of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A lot of people had to have some pain that day &gt;&gt; and God used a woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a woman to preach a gospel, &gt;&gt; but a woman to shake her husband. &gt;&gt; We got to get back to being right. &gt;&gt; Because we were once right is not enough to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; We got to be right now. Because we once had oil in our lamp, it's not enough. &gt;&gt; We've got to have oil in our lamp now. Because our wick was once trimmed, it's not enough. We've got to have a trimmed wick now. &gt;&gt; Because we wiped the globe years ago and cleaned up the smut. That's good. But we can't let that be all there was to our experience. &gt;&gt; We've got to clean the globe today. &gt;&gt; We've got to wipe the lens today. Come on. We've got to believe that God is still a God who keeps every promise. who cannot fail. &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Third seal. The bride hasn't had a revival yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then there's got to be something. &gt;&gt; Two phases went by me today. I gave you what I But that third got to come. &gt;&gt; It's all got to come. Somebody said, "What would make you think you can get to be a part of it?" Because I was on his mind before the foundation of the world. No other generation was positioned to receive this final move of God than this generation. Last generation and the generation before were not positioned to receive it because they did not see the decrease. &gt;&gt; Preach. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to see Elijah go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to recognize John the Baptist becoming smaller. &gt;&gt; So that he &gt;&gt; simple. &gt;&gt; Psalm 31:20, "Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man." Oh yes. Many people get locked outside the pavilion because of pride, because of offense, &gt;&gt; because of an unrecognized offense that you've picked up from somebody else. You carry the influence of somebody else's disagreement or beef. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Gossip has triangulated you and pulled you right in and and you don't even understand why you don't. I just don't like them. My mama used to say she had sharp for years sharp discernment. &gt;&gt; I just don't like them. I said, "Well, mama, that's no reason to mistreat them." I didn't say nothing about mistreating them. I said, "Mama, God said we got to love them." I didn't say nothing about not loving them. I love them, but I don't particularly like them. And I said, "You know, that can change one day." She said, "Absolutely." And that's what I'm hoping for. &gt;&gt; That it'll change one day. &gt;&gt; It was their ways. &gt;&gt; Did you know you can love somebody, you don't have to love everything about their ways, &gt;&gt; but you love them? And you've got to believe that the same God who is preparing preparing a tabernacle who's stretching his tent &gt;&gt; for for you is stretching his tent for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, won't that be a day when God swings all of these divisions &gt;&gt; and he takes a piece of that one and a piece of that one and a handful of those and a handful of those and pulls them all all right under the same stretch &gt;&gt; sits them on a rock and puts a song in their mouth and they begin to rejoice in what God has done not only in a day gone by but in their days. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must not just share a testimony of what God was. You need a testimony of what God is. &gt;&gt; He's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; He's an updated God. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Put 31:20. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man. Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion. Oh, from the strife of tongues. [Music] As long as you be you stay aware of what people say or what they think &gt;&gt; or what they expect. &gt;&gt; And that just kind of drives you. You'll never get under the tent. &gt;&gt; You'll never find yourself in the pavilion or the tabernacle. You'll have to get to a place where it's you and him. Lord, you see what's in me that's not like you. &gt;&gt; I know others see it, too, &gt;&gt; but they can't do anything about it but ostracize and misunderstand and wag their tongue. But if I can get locked in here with you for a little while, &gt;&gt; you put your loving finger on what's wrong with me &gt;&gt; and you release oil &gt;&gt; and wine. &gt;&gt; Oil and wine to heal my wound &gt;&gt; to remove the scar. Joshua, our Joshua was in Jerusalem. He comes down the stone stairs of our apartment and somehow maybe I don't know what all he's doing, playing. I can guarantee you that. I know that you parents think you're the only one who has raised children with energy. I almost said wild, but I want to be nice. But you're not the only one. We did, too. A lot of folks in this house did too. And we saw some of the same things you saw. Maybe the only difference is we didn't take our eyes off of them. &gt;&gt; When they had an accident, we were usually watching or somebody else was watching because we didn't leave them alone to the elements. We understood that we have a responsibility as stewards &gt;&gt; to try to keep them alive &gt;&gt; so they can grow up and be what God called him to be. &gt;&gt; Are you getting my drift? &gt;&gt; I hope so. Anyway, he slices his chin. Was it here somewhere, honey? Lip below. Right below the lip though, wasn't it? Right there. Slid it open all the way through. Tooth went through it. We're in a foreign land. We rushed around. We did all kinds of things. Story too long to tell. Most of you have heard it anyway. God arranged things. He just does. Well, why didn't he just stop it? Well, I guess he's sovereign God and he can, but I wouldn't have had a testimony. &gt;&gt; See, I I I like the testimony that comes after the test. &gt;&gt; But he arrests in the parking garage. two of the leading pediatric pediatrician or young uh children's plastic surgeons. They're having a conversation in the parking garage and should have been gone a long time ago and they're telling us in the in the second hospital we went to, you're we're just going to be able to stitch it up. We're not going to be able to do anything about scarring or anything because the plastic surgeons are off their uh their shift and and it won't be in and and this we can't leave it open like this. What they didn't know what God had arrested. &gt;&gt; He had arrested them. They're having this long conversation. They tell us later the the the man tells us later that he lingered and he and and and was concerned and wondering why I'm lingering like this. I need to be home. I'm exhausted. &gt;&gt; But God arrested them &gt;&gt; and they they looked at the situation and they took care of it. And one of the things that we were told was, "Use oil. Once the wound is healed, use oil. Doesn't matter. It could be even olive oil or vitamin E oil. Whatever you can get, even cooking oil. and and just rub it once it's healed. Just keep rubbing it. And when scar tissue is forming, little hard places, get under that le uh squeeze them hard and keep rubbing them with oil and there'll be no scar. And you know what? That's exactly how it happened. God knows exactly what to give you for your wound. And he knows exactly what to give you for your scar. He can take care of every bit of it if you can find a time, a place, a position with him. &gt;&gt; He just stretches his word over us. &gt;&gt; The Bible says underneath are the everlasting arms. That's when he c that's when he lifts us up. &gt;&gt; He comes up under us like that. The Bible talks about the uh the the eagle and and how that that eagle draws the the the little eaglet up under itself. It does it by by uh moving those five primary feathers on the end of his wings, creating a centrifugal force that sucks those little eigllets right up close under mama's breast or under daddy's chest. Don't you know that the creator &gt;&gt; if he puts that kind of an ability in a noble animal or bird? Don't you know he has the creative power to put that kind of a relation to create that kind of a relationship with you to pull you up under himself &gt;&gt; to cover you with his feathers? The psalmist said, &gt;&gt; somebody said, "These are there's so many different metaphors and allegorories. I can hardly get them all straight." Well, I want you to know that just about all of them are the same concept. pavilion, &gt;&gt; tabernacle, sanctuary, holy of holies, &gt;&gt; chambers, &gt;&gt; tent, hoopa, &gt;&gt; almost all of it is about being covered, protected. It's not only about events leading up here or there, a moment here, a moment there, but it's about a culmination. It's about a change of ministry. One that brother Brandham didn't live to see the final installment of that of that new ministry that he looked for where it would be a private thing, not a public thing. The way he saw it and tried to interpret it in his own mind, I'll show you. I'll show you before we leave, but I'll have to hurry if I get to it. where he said, "Maybe the next time we'll put up that tent and that little place and we'll pray for the people in private." Because what he saw was that little place where they were going in and coming out entirely changed, completely healed in a new form. &gt;&gt; And so in his mind, he thought, "Well, now that's the way it'll be. We'll we'll take the prayer line off the platform and we'll put it into a little tent. Can you imagine what kind of uh uh press &gt;&gt; that would have caused? Can you imagine the misunderstanding that that would have caused if it would have seen the natural fulfillment that he was expecting? &gt;&gt; This healer, they called him taking them back in private. Only only two people know what's going on in there. He even said we'll bring two two women if it's a woman. He he he had this little program and it never happened that way. &gt;&gt; He even refers to a little moment of trying it. &gt;&gt; Somewhere behind the curtain of a theater where he was and it never was quite what he was expecting. We ought to know by now that a vision or a dream like the book of the revelation comes in symbols &gt;&gt; and they can only be understood by revelation &gt;&gt; and for some reason God didn't give brother Brandham the full understanding and he kept trying right up until the end to look forward to that new ministry and now there are many around this movement who have tried to make sure that we don't think it failed. &gt;&gt; And so they've come up with things to kind of describe, well maybe that was the new minister. Well, maybe that was a new All I know is he left the scene saying, &gt;&gt; "Maybe next time." So for us to interpret things after the fact, it makes us a little bit brassy. &gt;&gt; For us to try to go back and say it was fulfilled and and even he didn't know it, &gt;&gt; that would make us a little brassy. &gt;&gt; So all we can do is say, Lord, it's in your hands. You gave the vision. I lean myself. I lend myself to that vision. I still believe that there's change coming like that. And so there must be some installment of that in the day and hour that I'm living in. Even though he is long gone, God is the same. God keeps his word. He's not obligated to my interpretation or your interpretation &gt;&gt; or a prophet's interpretation, but he is obligated &gt;&gt; to his word. So, I don't think they're going to need the airplane. &gt;&gt; I have pictures if you want to see it. It once belonged to Lady Bird Johnson. Anybody know who Lady Bird Johnson was? Nobody. Nobody under 40. She loved wild flowers. She was the the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson and the jet plane that she was tra traveled around in was bought many years ago by believers who are are holding it. And now the owners are mostly dead and it sits deserted on a field in Arizona waiting on a prophet to rise and fly it from place to place to have that new ministry to have that tent meeting that he was always looking for. And yet when brother Brandon was talking about rapture, he gives us Psalm 27, &gt;&gt; a pavilion, &gt;&gt; a tabernacle, &gt;&gt; a secret place in him, a position, &gt;&gt; not transportation, &gt;&gt; not not some physical something, &gt;&gt; some spiritual something. Would you really believe that the rapture is a is a natural? Or would you believe it's a supernatural? &gt;&gt; What God does is supernatural? &gt;&gt; He's a supernatural God. That's why people can't figure it out on their own. That's what frustrates the brainiacs. &gt;&gt; It frustrates the brainiacs because they're not able to really figure God out. He designed it that way &gt;&gt; because it takes faith to access the reality of who God is. &gt;&gt; You've got to have some faith. You've got to place some faith there. And in order to do that, you've got to surrender some control. And that's the problem. Men don't want to lose control. Women don't want to lose control. But faith will take you to a dimension where you're no longer in complete control. &gt;&gt; You recognize the sovereignty of a God who directs. Sir, &gt;&gt; are you still here? &gt;&gt; I believe you are. I want us to move on just a moment. Uh I want us to go back uh to No, before we do, look at look at Isaiah 26:20. Come, my people. I hear it. Come my people, enter thou in. Enter thou into thy chambers, thy chambers, &gt;&gt; a and shut thy doors about thee. Hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpassed. Doesn't Isaiah sound strikingly like the psalm? The same word is used in Song of Songs:4. We looked at it last night. Draw me. We will run after thee. The King hath brought me into his chambers. We will be glad and rejoice. That word chambers. Can you show us that? It's a masculine noun referring to a chamber, a parlor, a room, an inner room, a room of lying down or sleeping room. Innermost parts. Room within a room. Building within a building. The word means a compartment or room within a building which affords privacy. Solomon start draw me. He's writing but the bride is the one doing the talking here. Draw me. We will run after thee. It's Christ like a magnet. &gt;&gt; It's our bridegroom like a magnet. &gt;&gt; Draw me. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever felt a draw? &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever felt a pull? &gt;&gt; Until you do, you'll never be able to acknowledge the reality of a savior. &gt;&gt; I pray that if you've never felt that before, I pray you'll feel it unexpectedly, &gt;&gt; maybe even now, &gt;&gt; because that's just how sovereign he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand that no man has ever just made up his head one day, I'm going to seek God. &gt;&gt; It's never happened. It cannot happen unless God first &gt;&gt; is drawing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No man cometh to the father &gt;&gt; except my spirit draw him." &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? That you're only seeking after God. How many of you would say, "I'm seeking the Lord in this hour." I'd say, "I am." &gt;&gt; Do you know why you are? &gt;&gt; Because he's seeking you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's not trying to make you a fanatic. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's trying to make you a wife. &gt;&gt; I want you to know the concubine doesn't have the authority that the wife does. &gt;&gt; The street walker doesn't have the authority that the wife does. &gt;&gt; You understand? Her name on the check. &gt;&gt; His Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She's become one with him in the spirit by the word through a revelation. &gt;&gt; He now resides. His spirit, his life, his love, his attributes now reside in her. &gt;&gt; Can you see that? Look at Psalm 195, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber. A moment ago, it's their chamber. Now it's his chamber. And rejoicth as a strong man to run a race. Here is a bridegroom that has just left the moment. Now, I'm going to say this with King James language so that no parent has serious questions asked of them before lunch. You're not baby prepared for that today. Today's needs to be a chill day, right? Not a birds and bees day. So, we'll use King James The the bridegroom has just left the moment of consummation. &gt;&gt; I promise you, he doesn't leave the chamber, the nuptual chamber, the consummation chamber as a wimp. &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to agree? &gt;&gt; Are you blushing? Am I blushing? I guarantee you not. &gt;&gt; He is not a brokeback horse that day. &gt;&gt; He's a stallion. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; He comes out with strength. &gt;&gt; He comes out recognizing that a seal has taken place. It's actually so holy &gt;&gt; that this world doesn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; It's so clean and so holy and so spiritual and so beautiful that this old rotten world doesn't even deserve it. &gt;&gt; But it's nonetheless it is the way. It is procreation. It is multiply. It is everything that the scripture said it would be. But but this is a moment of a seal. &gt;&gt; Just just follow me just a minute. I won't get deep. I won't get embarrassing. Two destinies have come together and they begin to weave into one destiny. Amen. &gt;&gt; Two ideas, two thoughts, &gt;&gt; two upbringings, &gt;&gt; one raised in a heavy-handed family and one raised in a maybe new age uh gentle par. Thank you. Lazy parenting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now. &gt;&gt; And yet they've come together and they can't afford to spend the rest of their life arguing about how it's done. &gt;&gt; It's a holy moment. &gt;&gt; It's a holy union. And and the bridegroom when he comes out of that chamber, she knows what there is to know about him. And he knows what there is to know about her. Right? &gt;&gt; There was nothing to separate them. There was no veil to separate them. &gt;&gt; They weren't hiding from one another. &gt;&gt; It wasn't hidden underneath clothes because consummation doesn't happen that way. &gt;&gt; I'll be careful. It's a holy thing. It's so holy that the only reason why we have this marriage concept and this consummation uh concept is because it that's not listen folks that's not the reality. &gt;&gt; That's the type. &gt;&gt; The reality is one with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reality is before the foundations of this world, God desired to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; He desired to have intimacy, not sexuality, intimacy &gt;&gt; with a people. &gt;&gt; He desired, can you imagine? He desired a counterpart. Come on. &gt;&gt; How unbelievable. How unbelievable that the creator of all that we know would long to have fellowship with a counterpart when he dwelt alone &gt;&gt; with his thoughts. Elohim not a multiple of personality, not a multiple of person, but a multiple of attributes. Elohim. He dwelt alone with his thoughts. And one of those thoughts and some of those attributes are represented in this meeting. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at them. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at them. &gt;&gt; He longed to have fellowship. The whole reason why Eve was taken from Adam, it's a part. Look. Look, folks. That wasn't the reality. That was the type. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That wasn't the reality. That was the shadow. That wasn't the antitype. That was the type. &gt;&gt; The the the reality was there was a a bride in Christ &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; She was in him as an attribute like Eve was inside of Adam &gt;&gt; called he them &gt;&gt; both in the same body. He separated a bride not by ri. This is metaphor. Some people will come along and say, "Well, didn't you know the man has one less rib than a woman?" Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? It's It was way more than just bone. &gt;&gt; It was a part a feminine part, a feminist part of who he was. &gt;&gt; He longed to have fellowship. and what he was looking for was in him. &gt;&gt; While he's looking around to find it, &gt;&gt; Adam sees the animals with a mate, &gt;&gt; he has no mate. &gt;&gt; The reason why Adam had to come to this reality is because the creator had already come to the same reality. &gt;&gt; I have no mate. &gt;&gt; I have no wife. I have no bride. I have no counterpart. I fellowship in my own attributes and thoughts. He longed. I tell you folks, if you can get a glimpse of this greatest, it's the greatest romance. &gt;&gt; There is no story like this story. You can't believe it with head knowledge. You can only access it with faith. &gt;&gt; But he found a way. He found a way. And it was an overnight way. It wasn't an instant way. It wasn't a microwavable way. It was a way that would take 6,000 years. and eventually seven church ages &gt;&gt; to even begin to execute it on planet earth. &gt;&gt; First, he wasn't even a god [Music] &gt;&gt; because there was nothing to worship him as such. &gt;&gt; So, he had to create a heavenly host &gt;&gt; that would worship him. &gt;&gt; Were they forced to do so? Evidently not, &gt;&gt; right? because a portion of them rebelled and followed Lucifer. &gt;&gt; So they must have also had an opportunity to decide for themselves &gt;&gt; and you do too. &gt;&gt; Ex's just one little caveat and that is he knew your choice &gt;&gt; before you were ever formed in your mother's womb. &gt;&gt; He already knew your choice. Brother Brandon was preaching about Calvary that day at Calvary &gt;&gt; and he talks about God reaching in and separating from Christ, the bridegroom, pulling the bride out. Same kind of same kind of typology that we saw over there. It wasn't about Adam. It wasn't even originally about Christ. &gt;&gt; It was about creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was about what came forth from the log go &gt;&gt; desiring to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; Did he desire worship? He did. But there was something he desired more than worship. &gt;&gt; Fellow. Someone say it with me. Fellowship. &gt;&gt; Fellowship. That's not two fellows in a ship. It's intimate one- on-one relationship. It doesn't replace your earthly wife. &gt;&gt; It supersedes her. &gt;&gt; A man that doesn't have relationship and fellowship with his creator can never be enough &gt;&gt; for his wife. a woman who doesn't have fellowship with her creator. There there there doesn't have to be any jealousy. If there's jealousy in your home &gt;&gt; over time that your husband spends with God or your wife spends with God or if they or or one of the other spends in church or around the things of the spirit, if there's jealousy involved in that, it's simply because somebody is not fellowshipping with their creator. Because once you understand the beauty that comes out for you &gt;&gt; when your wife is madly in love &gt;&gt; with her creator. &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing could ever replace you. She married you. She chose you. She took a vow with you. &gt;&gt; But she will love you more. She will be able to be what you have need of if she stays in union and in communion with her creator. &gt;&gt; And it's more than fellowship twice a week at church. &gt;&gt; That's only a type. &gt;&gt; It's another shadow &gt;&gt; of what has to take place when you pray, when you worship, when you sit down to read your Bible. You've got to remember it's more than words on a page. This is the written record of of a God who created and loved it. It's just the written record of his word. There's a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the written record of the living word. But the living word lives in the people. &gt;&gt; It's the life of God. It's the life of Christ. It's eternal life. The apostle said, "The life I now live is not my own life." &gt;&gt; I once lived my life. That's right. &gt;&gt; I wish you could help me. &gt;&gt; Uh, we'll give you a good lunch if you'll stay a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; it's it's it's a it's a life that supersedes because this one comes to an end. And all your folks who love you, who see you once in a while, sometimes remember to send you a card or bake you a pie, and sometimes they don't. They'll all gather and they'll boohoo and they'll moan and they'll groan and they'll and they'll reminisce at your demise. There's more. I'm telling you, there's more. Yes, sir. The agnostic can't see it because it has to be accessed by faith. Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I have no faith." You're a liar. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said, "Look, I'm going to believe God's word every time over you. You're mighty convincing, but I'm going to believe what God's word said." &gt;&gt; God's word said to every man is given a measure, the measure of faith. It's there. It's just a seed. It's just a small little germ, but it's there somewhere. There's faith in you. You wouldn't be walking around if God hadn't placed it somewhere way down. Maybe you have to find it in your big toe, &gt;&gt; but there's some faith there. &gt;&gt; And you just have to get in an atmosphere &gt;&gt; where it can come alive &gt;&gt; underneath your toenail or wherever it resides &gt;&gt; and begin to spin around on the inside of you. and you say, "Well, maybe I maybe I could believe. May maybe I could put a little hope beyond this this thing. May maybe maybe there is a little more beyond this life." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There is an eternity. There was an eternity before there was a time. &gt;&gt; There will cease to be a time, but there will never cease to be an eternity. &gt;&gt; And the fellowship that God is longing for can only be executed in measure on this earth. But beyond this veil, beyond this curtain of time, &gt;&gt; there's an eternity at peace with him, in fellowship with him. We're not all laying on our backs. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Like some kind of goat yoga style or something, you know? It's not soul sleep we're talking about. &gt;&gt; It's an eternity that's more vibrant, more real &gt;&gt; than the one we're living in now. And God wants you to experience that in moments of rapture, &gt;&gt; in moments of tabernacle, in moments under the pavilion, in moments sitting up on a rock. &gt;&gt; So if the one on the end of your row gets more excited than you, get out of their way. &gt;&gt; Don't criticize them. Get out of their way. They may be having one of those moments. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Yeah, they may be just showing out. Don't you worry. Don't you worry about somebody else showing out. &gt;&gt; God's got a number. He's got it. &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring us down. He knows how. He know if you're putting on, God knows how to expose you. &gt;&gt; If you get your eyes on somebody because you think they're putting on, you'll miss your moment of rapture. You'll miss your moment under the tabernacle. You'll miss your moment hiding in the rock. &gt;&gt; Your eyes on him. your eyes on the word. Don't get your eyes on Are we still here? &gt;&gt; It's 119. I need another minute or two. This this uh Psalm 195, it's actually the word hoopa. Hoopa. It's a breath. It's breath. It's more more than a German h. It's breath. You see, if you should take the there there there are no vowels in the sacred name of God. So, we know even as brother Brandham said, Jehovah is not right. &gt;&gt; You do know he said that, don't you? &gt;&gt; He used it all the time because it was what he had to use. But he says right away, it it it's not right. There's no J in the Hebrew language and there were no vowels in the name of God. &gt;&gt; It's represented by four Hebrew letters. Y vave and that's not how it's pronounced. That's the names of the letters. That's not how it's pronounced because there are no vowels there. It really has little sound. That's why the Jewish people call it the unpronouncable name of God. And so they call him things like Adoni, which is really a word that means Lord. &gt;&gt; Or you will find among the Jewish community, they use this madeup word, Hashem, which means the name. &gt;&gt; When they're referring to God, they say Hashem, the name. But I want you to know he has a name. Amen. &gt;&gt; His Old Testament name is barely pronouncable because no vowels were revealed in the name when the when the name was revealed to uh uh in scripture it was not revealed with vowels. So it would really just be like releasing air. Interesting. When we say it, we try to say Yahweh Jehovah Yave. We we find some way. Hashim, Adoni, Lord. We find some way. But the reality is the name is so holy and so sacred &gt;&gt; that it's the first thing you said &gt;&gt; when you were born. &gt;&gt; The sacred holy name &gt;&gt; of your creator. The first breath of air that you breathe, &gt;&gt; didn't know it, not aware of it. You didn't do it as a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; You did it as a fingerprint of God's creation. &gt;&gt; You acknowledged him before you ever said mama, before you ever said da. &gt;&gt; By the breath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There lay this body of [Applause] &gt;&gt; There lay this body of flesh, just flesh. God himself, it's a breathed breath into the nostrils of man. &gt;&gt; I don't think that's just symbolic metaphor. I think it's mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. I think it's God face to face with his creation, Adam. &gt;&gt; And all he does is breathe his name. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "Adam became a living soul." &gt;&gt; He now had contact with his environment and with his creator. Praise the Lord. And so did you. Right? &gt;&gt; There is a place of intimacy and oneness with him that church will take you far away from because it come becomes religion and it becomes jumping through the hoops. &gt;&gt; And there are people right here among us that we love dearly right in our own church who are still in that stage of their relationship with God. And we have to respect that and love people no matter where they are on the scale. But there are still some people who believe that you have to reproach approach him in some religious form or fashion &gt;&gt; because they don't understand yet how he longs. &gt;&gt; I I I like being with my wife. not looking always deeply in her eyes, but I like being where she is. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The first thing that I rearranged in my message experience was when I first came around the message, I wasn't married and I I watched how people couldn't wait to get to the steakhouse so the men could go to one table and the women could go to another table. The men are going to debate the word and the women are going to talk about purses and never the twain shall meet. I told my wife at the beginning, I didn't choose a wife to sit with a bunch of stinking men. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to buck the trend. There will be a time that brothers will be together and sisters will be together and that's beautiful. And that's precious and that's wonderful. There'll be times when my wife is serving uh uh like like here and and and I'm sitting there waiting on her to come. But there's just something about I like being with her. If you could catch a re if you could catch even the smallest glimpse &gt;&gt; that he wants to have time. &gt;&gt; It's not always about whether you understand everything that's said. It's just getting in his presence, &gt;&gt; being where he is. and having some fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. Isaiah 45:5 and 6. Let's get it out and hurry. And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night. For upon all the glory for upon all the glory shall be a defense. What did Psalm 27 say? In the time of trouble, he shall hide me &gt;&gt; in the pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle. The glory shall be a defense. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert Anybody with me? I'm hurrying. This is me in hurry. &gt;&gt; You need to slip out. You know you can. I won't throw a stone. I understand. I wouldn't want to listen to anybody this long either, perhaps. I'm sorry about that. There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain. Now, we've got to figure out when that is. Some people say it's only in the millennium, but the scripture says there will be those who catch a foretaste &gt;&gt; of the powers of the age to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means there will be a people who experience millennial glory in the closing hours of the church age. Amazing. &gt;&gt; You mean I get a little taste of the millennium &gt;&gt; on this side of the millennium? That's exactly what the New Testament tells us. &gt;&gt; They're tasting the powers of the age to come. &gt;&gt; I tell you, little bride, I have. Some of you have had moments where his presence became so real that it was realer than than your reality. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to strut around the room like a rooster &gt;&gt; when you get in that presence. &gt;&gt; What you really want to do is find a place under the carpet. Just let me lay down and get as low as I possibly can in that moment that he has become a covert, a shelter, a tabernacle, shutting out life, shutting me in to his glory. What if you come to a place in a new ministry where where you don't have to leave those moments where you become a person under such influence and revelation and inspiration that you finish out your days here on the earth but untouched by what worries and disturbs and stresses other people. You also have problems, but your problems don't weigh you down &gt;&gt; because you found a shelter from the heat, &gt;&gt; a covert from the storm. &gt;&gt; People will say about you, you you think you're misunderstood now. They'll say then you don't care about nobody but yourself. &gt;&gt; You have very little compassion, it seems, or anybody else. It won't be that. It won't be that. What it will be is you found a place in him in his side &gt;&gt; where you never want to leave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In that place you discover a new ministry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is not executed by effort &gt;&gt; or striving &gt;&gt; or sweat. &gt;&gt; You don't scream your guts out &gt;&gt; to try to get somebody to listen to you. You don't try to have a vision so you can tell somebody what the problem is. &gt;&gt; It's a new ministry. &gt;&gt; It's executed without real physical strain and labor and worry and concern. It's executed in a creative fashion. &gt;&gt; It's executed by the power of the creative. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There shall be light. Yes. &gt;&gt; And there was light. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't accept that." Doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; It will be, &gt;&gt; whether you see it, &gt;&gt; whether you experience it, &gt;&gt; it won't change. I'm leaning myself into a vision. &gt;&gt; I'm lending my life to a vision. &gt;&gt; If you think it was only five little examples and God fizzled out, Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Five examples in the efforts and ministry of brother Bham. Five executions of the spoken word. If you think that's all God's got, &gt;&gt; five little sputters of powerful. Don't you think I unbelievable conviction falling? These little snickler fritzes, snicker fritzes, &gt;&gt; laughing at their stories of God's creative power. One minute and the next minute, &gt;&gt; I give you your sons. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God falls upon them. They fall over their mother's lap. The spirit of God moves on the prophet. He said, "Before the doctor's hand touches her side, the tumor's gone." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the very doctor that felt the tumor in the first place reaches for the tumor to get it. It's gone. It's not there. A storm that could have taken them all to their death by the power of the spoken word. The resurrection of a small animal. Resurrection life. Listen. Five examples. What did I leave out? The squirrels. Creative. Creative power. The same power. This what he said. You don't have to believe it. &gt;&gt; The same creative power that put the ram. &gt;&gt; That put the ram. &gt;&gt; It put the lamb in the thicket. &gt;&gt; You see the the human carnal mind. It says, "Well, a ram was I I mean, I see this is doesn't have horns, but it was a horned animal. It got hung in the thicket that way. In Hebrew, you can read it. We just think, well, God told Abraham to take his son Isaac, and he he's up there willing and ready to obey, and God said, "No, you don't have to." And so, he caused this little ram to stumble in there and get hung up. And that became the sacrifice. After all, Abraham said up the way up, excuse me, on the way up the mountain, he said, uh, Isaac said, "Daddy, where's the sticks? I see how we're going to make the fire, father, but who where will the sacrifice be?" He didn't know. He didn't know &gt;&gt; that Abraham so blindly believed, so so so blindly trusted his creator that he was willing to do anything that he asked him to do. He didn't know he might be, he was going to be, he was destined to be at sea. And what did Abraham say? Son, God will provide himself. Don't you worry. God will provide. You need to understand that God will provide the sacrifice. He has provided the lamb on our behalf and he will give you the strength you need &gt;&gt; to worship him to be what he would desire for you to be. &gt;&gt; The But we believe I believe by supernatural event God brought and this shows it. this this sculptor uh decided to show it with an angel that looks like that. I've never seen one like that, but anyway, that was his artistic rendition of a ram that was brought down and and and perhaps the angel just hung it in the bush until it was needed. This seems to fit the whole typology of scripture because Jesus wasn't a man that was chosen as he reached a certain age to be the lamb. He was the lamb as an egg as a cell in his mother's belly. He was a ram. He was a lamb. He was a sacrifice. He was destined to be. God put him there. &gt;&gt; God overshadowed by the Holy Ghost Mary and provided what was needed for salvation and deliverance of the Lord. I can't believe that. Not with this, but with this. So, you're telling me I have to lose my intelligence to believe? No. You've got to let faith rise. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a doofus. &gt;&gt; You see, some people look at all Christians like they're just a bunch of idiots, uneducated fools who don't know any better. Don't know anything about all I know is this. Before the worlds were formed, &gt;&gt; he wanted melle. &gt;&gt; Beyond that, I am. He wanted me &gt;&gt; and he wooed and drew &gt;&gt; and found &gt;&gt; that which he was after. Do you believe that &gt;&gt; that word tabernacle, would you put that up for us? Let me remind you and we'll close a moment. 136. And there there shall be the glory upon all the glory shall be a defense. There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and a covert from the storm. That word tabernacle is the same word we mentioned last night. It was suk. This is suka. It it describes the the booth that's built at tabernacles time. &gt;&gt; It it is a covert. It is a cottage, a booth, a pavilion, a tabernacle, a tent, a temporary shelter. I I imagine some of you didn't know how many times these same words were used interchangeably through the scripture. God's always pointing people to a place to hide, to rest, to be covered, to be secret, to have fellowship, to have intimacy. It's a beautiful picture. And and go back that word defense. Can you show it to us in verse five? The glory. The glory. For upon all the glory shall be a defense. Do you know what Hebrew word that is? It's the word for the bridal canopy. The hoopa. It's translated here defense. Let's see what it means. Chamber. Closet. Defense. A nuptual chamber. It's a feminine noun referring to a chamber, a closet, a cover, a canopy, andor a defense, a pavilion of marriage. It refers figuratively to the bridal chamber from which the sun comes forth in Psalm 195 and 6. And in Joel 21:16, it indicates a mighty protective canopy over God's people in Isaiah 4:5. It's a place where the vows are exchanged. But in biblical times, it wasn't just the place where the vows were exchanged. Because after the covenant was sealed, the curtains were hung. And it became the nuptual chamber. It became the place of intimacy where the bride and the bridegroom became one. And when they came out of that bridal chamber, can you imagine their guests are still at the party? It lasted at least seven days in the Orient. the celebration. Can you imagine the pressure of knowing that all of your guests are waiting for you to make the seal of your union? And yet that's how it was done. Deuteronomy tells us that it was so literal that there was a piece of cloth laid down. I'll be careful. So that when the union took place, it was believed that when the membrane was broken, I won't even say the word for you to have to face it. But the ancients believe that when that membrane was broken, there was always blood. We now know that that is not necessarily the case. But it likely is, often is if a woman is a virgin. Literally they that sheet in Deuteronomy 20 5 23 Deuteronomy 23 vers is it 13 through what? Can you put that up? I won't read it but I'll need the reference. I want you to write this down because if I wasn't such a long-winded preacher, I could have got to all my notes in in an hour. If I was smarter, if I was better at it, I do. I confess all of that. Uh I had too much hay on my fork. I I uh I gave you those scriptures this morning, so I know you got it somewhere. I wished I I can just give you the place and maybe it'll help you find it. We're we're leaving Deuteronomy 22 13-21. It it it refers in one of those verses to the tokens of her virginity. And it's referring to that sheet, that cloth. And it was such a literal experience that that sheet was folded up and preserved. It was then handed. There it is. It was handed to the father of the bride. It's holy. It's not just about pleasure. It's holy. It's a seal. It's a covenant. The world has made it sick, perverted, nasty. But God instituted it as a holy seal because God is a God who believes whose whose covenant says it's once. Marriage is once. It's not easy. It don't always turn out the way you want it to, but that's what it is. And therefore, father of the bride gets the sheet. I've stood in the museum in in Jerusalem, the Israeli museum, and I have seen the ancient uh bags that are hand embroidered among the Yemenes, the Yemenite Jews, the Iraqi Jews, the Iranian Jews, the Sphartic Jews, darkerkinned Jews. I was going to call another group and it slipped my mind. And they made these little bags so that the the sheet was folded up and put in that bag and it was kept. The father kept that as for safekeeping. So that if that man ever got tired of this little wife like happens even in our ranks, if some other little younger Philly comes along, don't get me started. Then all of a sudden he he pulls from the well a story. Well, she wasn't a virgin. She wasn't pure when I married her. How in the world did it take you 30 years to figure that out? &gt;&gt; This would have been right away known. The Bible then says that father can cancel that vow. if deception has taken place and there is no proof. But if there's proof that you let's just spiritualize it for just a moment. You're not going to be able to go on what you say. I I've been with him. I've been with the Lord. I've had my f my Bible time. I've had my me time with God. You've missed it. If it's me time with God, you've missed it. &gt;&gt; It's not me time. &gt;&gt; It's his time. Him time. That's it, Sister George. Him time. It's me time pulling away from your f. But it's not about you. It's about him. &gt;&gt; But guess who gets the most out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're then there'll be a little bride come forth with proof. Oh, you've been with him. Oh, yes. I saw the prophet. I believe the prophet. I I know God sent a prophet. You've been with him? I've been in a message church for 30 years. Do you have the Holy Ghost? Sure. Couldn't believe there was a prophet if I didn't have the Holy Ghost. Baloney. The devil believes that God uses prophets. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the Holy Ghost. Proof. &gt;&gt; Bring the sheet. If we spend that time in that intimate place, if we see the new ministry that he told us about, if the bride has that little quick short work &gt;&gt; that culminates in a resurrection, &gt;&gt; where the dead in Christ rise &gt;&gt; and appear just like they did in Jerusalem. If we see that it will be because we have proven with our life with our with our the way we treat people &gt;&gt; not our religious talk. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The life. &gt;&gt; The life. &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them. That's right. that believe. One day, one day, one day, one day, let me end with this. Two places I want to read in closing. Identification of Christ in all ages. 1964, Birmingham. Alabama, the meetings that my grandmother attended. So that makes it very special to me. This meeting was April the 9th of 1964. He's praying a prayer. Heavenly Father. Oh, just a minute. I need a breath. We are grateful to see the risen Messiah. 1900 years of all kinds of theology and movements, but still in the darkness of all of it. You promised that you would appear here in the last days in this Sodom day and you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham, the called, the elected. And here you are tonight. After 1900 years, you are just as much alive tonight as you was when you talked to the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; And if you stopped reading, you would think he was only referring to himself. This is Jesus ministering in me. But he didn't stop there. He said it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh &gt;&gt; bride &gt;&gt; of his bride. For the bride and the husband is the same self &gt;&gt; flesh &gt;&gt; one together fellowship under the tabernacle under the folds of the tent in the secret place in the pavilion in the hiding place on the rock. It couldn't just be millennium and it couldn't be beyond millennium because in that new heaven and new earth we won't experience the light of a created sun. &gt;&gt; For in that realm there is neither need for any of those created elements or candles. For the Bible said Christ himself is the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we're going to have a covert from the heat, from the sun, from the storm, &gt;&gt; it must not just be talking about in the sweet by and by. &gt;&gt; There must be a period of time that the bride enters into a place of holy union, &gt;&gt; the invisible union &gt;&gt; of a heavenly bridegroom &gt;&gt; and an earthly bride. There must be something culminating yet. Not a new message, not a new prophet, not an eighth messenger, not a chief apostle, &gt;&gt; none of those things. &gt;&gt; Bride. The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. Wherever she is, the bride. Musicians come. Here's the last one. Oh, I didn't finish that one, did I? These two are one now in the flesh of his bride. For the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh. These two are one. And the church is becoming the bride. That's part of the transition. Right? &gt;&gt; You begin to recognize, hey, I got feathers and they've got feathers, but my feathers ain't like their feathers. &gt;&gt; Their feathers only get them to the fence post. But I'm beginning to see that my feathers take me a little higher &gt;&gt; because I wasn't born to be a chicken &gt;&gt; or a turkey, &gt;&gt; but an eagle. &gt;&gt; Scripture all through scripture. Eagle. Is Elelliana asleep? Eagle. Eagle. Honey. Eagle. Elelliana. Jane. Eagle. Not a chicken. Higher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Getting up above stuff &gt;&gt; emotion. We're nearly done. How many of you realize that you are a part of that eagle? &gt;&gt; That overcoming getting above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I heard a scream. &gt;&gt; I recognize that I don't have to spend my whole life in the barnyard. Jehovah Eagle has made a way for me to go higher. &gt;&gt; Now, back to this quotation. Uh, these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word. There's ing on this by believing the word. It's happening all the time. Becoming the bride, believing the word. So that the word and the church &gt;&gt; becomes the same. the word in the church making it the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation, the unveiling of Christ &gt;&gt; pulls many from the church to a higher place, &gt;&gt; the last sign. &gt;&gt; I hear this preached all the time that brother Brandham is the last sign. You embarrass him with your misplaced theology. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you don't quit saying those things, you you make me an antichrist." &gt;&gt; I'll quit. I'll come off the field. I would rather face God a quitter than to face him as an antichrist. &gt;&gt; People cannot let men be men. Flawed men, human beings chosen mightily used of God, worthy of double honor. Yes, but not to be worshiped &gt;&gt; or exonerated as gods. You don't have to sit in church every Sunday and look at him to believe the word in the church making it the last sign. What a prophet. That's not what he's saying. God identifying himself. The word in the church. &gt;&gt; Identification of Christ of all ages. Birmingham. Now here's the last one. Play something soft. Say something that'll make the preacher shut up. You have anything like that? In my feeble attempt, I want to close and culminate everything said in two services with this quotation. Hear it carefully. Hear it very carefully. Write it down. Hold on to it. Take a picture of it. Paragraph 474. Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963. Take a picture of it if you have your phone handy. Use the thing for something smart. So you'll be able to go and find it. That's not all of it. That's just the first part of it. But get a picture of it. That's how I remember things. I'm sorry. I'm getting older. I tell myself I'm going to remember, but if I don't snap it, screenshot it, I don't. This is God's. I I want you to stand up because we're we're that serious about it. Some of you don't even believe me. I'm I'm not very trustworthy to you, am I? Because I threaten so often. But I want you to be standing so you can catch this. This is God's great mystery of love &gt;&gt; expressed &gt;&gt; that God and man became one. The whole thing is God and man one. &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand. &gt;&gt; Don't get weird. &gt;&gt; This is too beautiful to be weird. &gt;&gt; You are not God. &gt;&gt; You are the man part of the equation. &gt;&gt; He is the God part of the equation. And when he fully occupies you, &gt;&gt; you have creative power &gt;&gt; and authority because he is with you. &gt;&gt; He is in you. &gt;&gt; Not because you. &gt;&gt; So this isn't making men gods. No, this is joining God with man to become one for a quick short explosion of God's authority and power. Lord, please let me live to see it &gt;&gt; more than seeing my children married and happy and my grandchildren happy. Above everything, I'm not trying to be emotional. Above everything, I beg him. Every time I have a pain, every time I have a feeling, I I rebuke it. I can't get sick, can't die now, can't can't get old before my time. &gt;&gt; Every time I hear someone leaving soon, doesn't even know they're sick and die, I say, "Oh, God, just let me live with my right mind &gt;&gt; just long enough to see a people It doesn't have to be a long time. Just give me a few days to see a bride operating in full adoption. She wouldn't dare speak a word on her own. It would only be what the bridegroom would have her to say. Jesus, God in the flesh, yet he moved by vision and he said, "I can do nothing except it is given to me, shown to me of my father." The bride will operate in that kind of authority. Hallelujah. All of creation groans. The New Testament said, "For the manifestation of the sons of God. Let us see it. God and man is one. What is it? Being filled with his spirit. Him having the preeminences. You can be in church and not be under the hoopa. &gt;&gt; You can be in church and not be under the pavilion. &gt;&gt; I place myself under the tabernacle of the Lord today. I place myself under your pavilion, Lord. I place myself under your authority. Now work in me, Lord. Do for me what I can't do for myself and for this precious people gathered here today. you having the preeminences. He said that was God's achievement. That's God's purpose to do that. He might that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No two soul. No. Are you thunder? Are you return? Are you seventh seal open? Are you seventh seal closed? Are you none of that? It does not matter. When we are one in Christ, doctrine matters nothing because if you have doctrine and cannot produce, reproduce the life of Christ. If you have religion and you can't reproduce the life of Christ, it's vain. &gt;&gt; It's vain. Benjamin, be ready. That God's that was God's achievement. That's God's purpose to do that. That he might be in Christ. Christ in us, all of us together, one. The Holy Spirit, same thing. It revealed it to Christ. Reveals it here. Somebody else read that power. &gt;&gt; The supernatural creative power. &gt;&gt; I can't believe in that. That's up to you. He said missing limbs. would be restored. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't believe that." But I'm like, "You, Sister George, I can't afford not to believe it. I have to believe it. I've given my all &gt;&gt; for the vision. I couldn't walk away from it now if I if I wanted to. I don't, but I couldn't because it's everything to me. I want him to have the wife that he was looking for. &gt;&gt; I I don't know for sure, but in my mind, I think this I think that if I knew I could never be that, I would still want to help somebody else be that &gt;&gt; because if he said it, &gt;&gt; it's got to be so. &gt;&gt; That's right. He cannot lie. [Music] &gt;&gt; It happens in the ocean. &gt;&gt; There are certain species of starfish that lose an arm. And God has placed in that creation the regenerative power and the cells reproduce themselves and rush to that wound and begin to rebuild what is lost. If God can do that for a silly little starfish, you're trying to tell me that God couldn't do that for one of his own. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't accept that. I cannot accept that. It's supernatural creative power. There will be a people, but she won't come by it automatic. She'll only come by it by spending time with him. &gt;&gt; Cover us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Would you ask him right now before we worship? Cover me, Lord. Be my covert, &gt;&gt; my pavilion, my tabernacle, my refuge, my hiding place. Be my holy of holies. Let me be transformed by your presence. This life is not ours anymore. It's you who lives in us. Be real to us, Lord. Let somebody today. Let somebody. I don't care if they're eight or 80. &gt;&gt; Let somebody believe. Yes. &gt;&gt; Let somebody grab it and say, "I want to give my life to that truth. &gt;&gt; I want to be that example [Music] &gt;&gt; and I'll come running after you." [Music] Draw me. Draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Draw me, draw me, Lord, [Music] and I'll come running after you. me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Oh, draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Oh, draw me, Lord. And I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Oh, draw me, Lord. and I'll come running after you. [Music] Draw me. Draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Draw me. Won't you draw me, Lord? I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Draw me, Lord. I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Oh, draw me. Draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after you. Peace of God. Cover me.

Let me look into your face. &gt;&gt; My love is draw. We have nothing to sell there. There's no gimmick here. It's just a question. Are you willing to lend yourself to a vision that you didn't have to see God perform what he promised in his word? I'm willing. I'm willing. I I just took a glance. 1964, he says, "Far as I know," this is him talking. "Far as I know, it hasn't happened yet. I read you last night, 65, where he said, "Maybe this will be the thing that drives us into that tent." 1965. He didn't see it. I can't tell you what that does to me. I've never been able to explain it. It's It's scripture for prophets to pass and not see the fulfillment. It's scripture. It's what forerunners do. But somebody somewhere, and I refuse to make up something and say, "Well, it happened and he missed it, or it happened and no one knew it." And I don't believe there can come a company of people with creative power. and nobody know anything about it. I don't think it means one miracle &gt;&gt; in a region. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's going to be years in the in the in the duration. He said a quick short work. What does that mean? I don't know. But all of creation's groaning for it. The least you and I can do is grunt every once in a while, longing for it. Just be Jesus in me. Lord, just come and be real and be Lord in my life. When we used to have meetings years ago, fellowship times and missionary times, they would give a call and they would ask, "Who wants to come and give your life as a missionary and service for the Lord?" And I saw many people launched into international world ministries as little missionaries because they felt moved to do so. That's not what this Closing service is about this is about wondering would you be willing to to lend everything you have to be one of those. It means that you have to get rid of some bitterness, some some resentment, some offense, some pride, whatever. I don't know. But it means that you just empty yourself. It's a process. I get it. I know I'm in it. Less of me, Lord, more of you. But but it's a it's a it's a vision out there. It's a go. It's something out there that's tangible if we can get to it. It's promised in the book. There will be overcomers in Leodysia. There was a church in Babylon. If there was a church in Babylon, there will be a bride in the last day &gt;&gt; surely. who has that authority. If you're willing, I I'm not we have nothing to join, but if you're willing, would you just tell the Lord right now, Lord, I'm willing to yield my life to be what you promised I could be. And it's not because I need to be a hero. It's simply because I I need to be a vessel for you to come and finish your work in the earth. I'm not trying to get out of my duty. I'm trying to get in it, Lord. Use me. Use me, sisters. You're usable. You may never fulfill You may never fulfill a pullpit ministry, but you're usable. You're God's chosen. He can use you in mighty ways for your family, for your neighbors, for your church sisters. He can use you in ways that you have never been used before. Are you willing to be usable, brothers? We're not all pastors. We're not all preachers, but we're all usable. &gt;&gt; Will you Will you let him use you? If so, tell him. Tell him today, "Lord, here we are. Here we are. You've done so much for us until it feels almost wrong to ask you to keep doing, but Lord, you promised you're the same. you don't change. And even after all you've done, we still need you in our lives to help us come to a place where we can yield to you and be all that you have created us to be. For some people, they're tired of waiting. They've given up. They've forsaken the journey. Their criticisms have overtaken them. They're back in a life of sin. But I thank you, Lord, for every person who lays their shoulder up against the plow today and says, "I'll plow on. I'll press on. I'll pray on. I'll praise on. I'll surrender more. I'll let that word become a living reality in my life." &gt;&gt; While old-timers are passing from the scene, Lord, a new generation must catch the vision. A new generation must step up and say, "I lend myself to the fulfillment of that vision that the lamb might may receive the reward for his suffering in me. My stuff is not so big that God can't use me. &gt;&gt; Would you surrender in this one? In this one moment, it's you and him. No one is monitoring your prayer. It's you and him. Lord, here I am. Here I am. Here I am, Lord. You might even tell him, "You're stuck with me. You called me. You saved me. You sanctified me. You're stuck with me. I'm going to be a part of this. I'm going to keep positioning myself under the spout where your glory runs out. I want my life to matter. I want my life to count. I want my existence to matter. I don't want to get down to the end of my life and wonder what it was all about. I want to see you glorified and exalted in my family, in my neighborhood, in my region, in my nation, and to the nations of the world. I want to see your name glorified and lifted up. I want someone to know the reality of a of a unchanging, unconditional, loving God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're not interested in being church members. We surrender as disciples. He's the lily of the valley. He's the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. He's the beautiful rose of sheriff. He means more than this world to me. And best of all, he is my coming king. Sing it as your prayer. Oh Jesus, use me. Oh Lord, don't refuse me too low. Surely there's a work that I can do. Even though it's humble and even though it's humble, Lord, help my will to crumble. And though the cross be greater, &gt;&gt; give me a little better key for me. Thank you. I'm sorry. Are we agreed? Jesus, use me. Oh Lord, don't refuse me. Surely there's a work that I can do &gt;&gt; and even though &gt;&gt; help my will &gt;&gt; and sing it again. Jesus use me. Oh Jesus, use me. Oh Lord, don't refuse me. Surely there's a word that I &gt;&gt; and even though [Music] &gt;&gt; I will be crumbled though the cross be great. &gt;&gt; I will stand for you dear Jesus. Though death should come my way, I'll spread the gospel to the fallen here. And should it be your will, Lord, for me to go across the sea, oh help me, willing, Jesus, singing Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, don't &gt;&gt; surely there's a word. &gt;&gt; And even though it's humble, Lord, whatever you would have us do, you speak and we're ready to be obedient to you. Thank you for this service today. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for these beautiful children and young people. Some had to step way out of their comfort zone to sing in front of us. I ask you to bless them with courage, with anointing, and with holy desire. May they not have to be pushed or shoved or pulled, but may they find a desire to bless your people. It's not just those little ones, Lord, that have a promise. It's not just those little ones that have potential. &gt;&gt; All of us have something to do for you. Lord, draw us everyone close to you in this hour and we'll give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Who has something to chew on at least? &gt;&gt; I hope you do. I hope you do. Uh please be mindful that there are those who have a long way to journey today. And that means the quicker you can get your food back here warm here ready to eat, the better for them. I always get that feeling. I felt like my granny because she always worried that people would would have to leave before they could have something to eat. So, as as fast if some of us will just be fast, you got plenty of time to fellowship this afternoon. Say, "God bless you and wave and run to your car. bring your food back so that these who have to go to Carolina and Indiana and wherever else. Uh maybe some aren't leaving today, but I know some are. I want them to have something good and southern and fattening. I want Luke uh to have something fattening to take back to Wisconsin with him. I do. I I told him last night, you need biscuits and gravy. You need We have dessert with breakfast. Did you see that last night? We have dessert when we have our breakfast. I want everybody to have something good to eat. Uh we're blessed. Camp meeting is going to be incredible. God's going to be with us until then. &gt;&gt; How many of you love one another? If there is somebody in this room that you don't like, you are going to have to love them &gt;&gt; or you're going to miss it. You might as well practice. You might as well practice. I'm not being funny. It is kind of funny that we have to think of these things. You better love people. I better love people. Whether I can get on with them or not, I've got to learn to love them. I've got to love them like Christ loved them. Boy, that ain't easy. It's easy to say, &gt;&gt; harder to do. &gt;&gt; But how many of you have confidence in him? &gt;&gt; I know he can help us. &gt;&gt; There's people in this room that have been through so much together. We know each other's stuff and we love each other anyway. Don't you let some little something rise up among you and cause you to be at odds with one another. &gt;&gt; You're in the vessel of misunderstanding, you don't have to stay there forever. God bless you. You maybe because my glasses are so dirty, but you all look so beautiful. You just shine. You just shine. You've been scoured. I pray you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord. Watch how they don't obey me. Watch how they just tar. Please bring something back so these visitors can have a good meal to eat today. Let's sing as they go out. I'm one of them. Benjamin, I don't have a lot of voice here, but help me. There are people almost everywhere. Sister Gwen, love you. Love you almost everywhere whose hearts are all a flame with the fire that fell at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Oh my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to his name. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that I can say I'm one of them. Well, I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Well, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Well, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them.

I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. Father Glorus free from this Jesus. Jesus. Hallelujah.
