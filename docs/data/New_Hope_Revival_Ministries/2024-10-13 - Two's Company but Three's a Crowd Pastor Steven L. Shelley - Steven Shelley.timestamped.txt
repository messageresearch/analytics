[40:09] hope her their daughter is John's mother
[40:12] and they were married here and for some
[40:15] time raised their children here anyway
[40:17] John uh has been going through a lot of
[40:20] things there's been a divorce in their
[40:22] family and he's not maybe taking his
[40:25] medication like he should I don't know
[40:27] all the the details but he had an
[40:29] epileptic seizure at work he works for
[40:32] FedEx if I understand it right he went
[40:35] off the forklift and way down onto the
[40:37] loading to the bottom of the loading
[40:39] floor broke his face a brain bleed and
[40:44] and so forth but God has has already
[40:47] moved for him he's still in intensive
[40:48] care he's still
[40:50] intubated uh he's still under you know
[40:53] they're keeping him under because when
[40:55] he started waking up he was quite
[40:57] restless and actually had another
[40:59] seizure so they put him back down again
[41:03] last night hope told me that uh he has
[41:06] an infection now and that they are
[41:09] starting him on very serious rounds of
[41:12] antibiotics Etc to try to bring that
[41:14] down they're going to do an MRI Monday
[41:18] if if uh he remains stable enough to do
[41:21] it to find out if there's something else
[41:23] going
[41:24] on there there there is still a question
[41:27] about how what kind of condition he
[41:29] would be in if he comes through this uh
[41:33] when when they asked them the night when
[41:35] Amanda who who went to the hospital uh
[41:38] and met them there still his whatever
[41:42] you call Medical power of attorney or
[41:43] next of Ken when she asked them can you
[41:47] survive this they would look her in the
[41:48] eye but God has certainly shown him
[41:51] Mercy I can't get him off my mind he's
[41:54] away from God but he has known the Lord
[41:58] and he has known the truth and I want to
[42:01] see God reach down in that hospital and
[42:04] and talk to his heart and and see what
[42:07] God can do with his life just pray for
[42:10] the whole family it's a it's an awkward
[42:12] situation with a split like that and the
[42:15] kids of course they're concerned about
[42:17] their dad and and uh the family is here
[42:21] with John's sister and so forth I know
[42:23] I'm taking a lot of time but these are
[42:26] people that have meant so so much to us
[42:28] let's ask the Lord's perfect will to be
[42:31] done uh block every every attack of the
[42:35] enemy and what Satan would try to do to
[42:37] pull the this timing of the Lord into
[42:39] another Direction I want to see John set
[42:42] free and serving the lord and I want to
[42:45] see his family uh growing in the things
[42:49] of God so pray for them would you pray

[53:31] the house of the Lord with us today
[53:33] brother Kate is going to come and sing
[53:35] for us today he told me that he thought
[53:36] he could I know he's struggling a little
[53:39] bit but we're going to worship with him
[53:41] while he's getting ready I just want to
[53:43] give a a a short uh testimony here
[53:47] concerning I a month ago over a month
[53:50] ago I ordered the the vanity tops for
[53:53] down at the fellowship hall and when the
[53:55] order was placed I was told they would
[53:57] be ready in two weeks we're over a month
[54:01] and I went Friday and they made a call
[54:03] and I was told that I would not see them
[54:05] until November the 5th they're still in
[54:08] production well I wished I could produce
[54:11] them myself but I can't and so I'll just
[54:15] have to wait I'm asking the Lord to let
[54:19] him arrive this week he can do that for
[54:22] me for us yesterday Nathan saw a yard
[54:27] sale down our street and he sent me a
[54:31] picture and so later in the day I went
[54:34] to the yard sale and they had a vanity
[54:38] and I you know the wheels turned and so
[54:42] I thought well at least there could be
[54:44] uh a sink to wash hands in one of the
[54:48] bathrooms just a temporary thing it had
[54:51] a faucet on it and I said I can make
[54:53] that work so I went up and I handed the
[54:56] lady $10 and she says well what did it
[54:58] have on it I said
[54:59] $10 and she says you're not paying $10
[55:02] for that and she looked at her husband
[55:04] and she says give him 8 back
[55:08] $2
[55:10] okay so so the man helped me load it and
[55:15] he walked away and in a second here she
[55:18] comes and she says what did he charge
[55:19] you for that I said well you told him $2
[55:22] so that's what I paid she says here's
[55:24] your $2 back so I didn't pay anything
[55:27] for
[55:29] [Applause]
[55:33] it so one of the bathrooms will have a
[55:36] vanity if by chance you have a sink
[55:42] bowl that is in your shed that you are
[55:44] not using that I could cut a hole in a
[55:46] piece of plywood and put a faucet on I
[55:49] would invite you to bring it to me I can
[55:52] make it work temporarily until we get
[55:54] the good ones it won't look as as I
[55:56] wanted it to but at least it'll be
[55:59] functioning that we you can wash your
[56:01] hands after you use the bathroom the the
[56:03] both bathrooms now have a a a commode in
[56:06] them so they are now usable and we're
[56:09] very happy that we can tell the the ouse
[56:12] byby and uh we can have working
[56:15] facilities in the fellowship hall we are
[56:19] gearing up for a wonderful week and so
[56:23] we want to give we know that all you
[56:25] ladies are going to be giving of
[56:26] yourself this week in in the preparing
[56:29] of the food and I just want to say as

[56:40] clearness of mind with your recipes so
[56:42] that there won't be any mess ups that'll
[56:45] just go smoothly for you so that we you
[56:48] won't feel that agitation uh of
[56:50] something like that to cause your you
[56:53] know another battle may God just bless
[56:55] you with clear mind to be able to fix

[57:05] of the camp meeting and and we could go
[57:07] through them but we're not going to take

[57:11] want you to give with your finances and
[57:14] whatever else this week and I know that

[1:26:45] call praise be to God hallelujah let's
[1:26:50] thank God for these musicians
[1:26:59] Colossians chapter 1 thank you for
[1:27:01] coming and spending the day with us
[1:27:04] today Colossians chapter
[1:27:07] 1 verse 17 and
[1:27:10] 18 it's in these verses of scripture
[1:27:13] that our theme for camp meeting 2024 is
[1:27:18] found it's actually found in Colossians
[1:27:21] 1:1 188b and when you see that a or a B
[1:27:25] there it means either the first part of
[1:27:27] the verse or the second part of the
[1:27:29] verse and so it would actually read the
[1:27:32] the address would actually be Colossians
[1:27:34] 1:18 B and it says that in all things
[1:27:39] listen that in all things he might have
[1:27:46] the
[1:27:47] preeminence that's the theme for the
[1:27:50] 2024 camp meeting that in all things he
[1:27:55] might have the
[1:27:58] preeminence reading verse 17 and 18
[1:28:01] together it says and he is before all
[1:28:04] things and by him all things
[1:28:10] consist and he is the head of the body
[1:28:15] the church do you believe that who is
[1:28:19] the
[1:28:20] beginning the first born from the dead
[1:28:25] he's not the last he's not the ending
[1:28:29] he's the beginning of those who will
[1:28:32] arise from the dead that in all things
[1:28:36] he might have the preeminence we are in
[1:28:41] the hour where Christ the
[1:28:45] word must have the preeminence in all
[1:28:50] things we do not our pastor come on now
[1:28:55] not our worship leader not even a
[1:28:58] prophet but he must have the
[1:29:03] preeminence brother brandom always
[1:29:06] pluralized preeminence almost every time
[1:29:09] he would say he must have the
[1:29:24] has the
[1:29:25] preeminence let the activities of the
[1:29:29] church project
[1:29:32] declare manifest that he has the
[1:29:36] preeminence and let the preaching of the
[1:29:39] word yes make sure above all things that
[1:29:43] Jesus and the Living Word somebody said
[1:29:47] well you said Jesus have the prein and
[1:29:49] you said the word don't we understand
[1:29:51] what John told us in the beginning
[1:29:54] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:29:56] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:29:58] word became
[1:30:00] flesh and so this word is not talking
[1:30:03] about a group of sermons
[1:30:06] only it's talking about that which came
[1:30:09] forth from the
[1:30:11] logos it came forth as Rama to the body
[1:30:15] of Christ a living spontaneous nabba
[1:30:20] word that's Hebrew for bubbling forth it
[1:30:23] was a bubbling forth word of sure
[1:30:27] prophecy for us and we're thankful for
[1:30:31] it it cannot stand alone let me make
[1:30:34] sure as we enter this camp meeting that
[1:30:37] you know that I believe that the message
[1:30:40] that God entrusted to brother brandham
[1:30:43] cannot stand by itself it was not
[1:30:47] designed to stand alone it must be laid
[1:30:52] on the absolute
[1:30:54] scripture because as he is teaching and
[1:30:57] preaching it to us he says over and over
[1:31:00] again that that word that word is the
[1:31:04] absolute he's always referring us back
[1:31:07] now we know and I know you're standing
[1:31:09] but we know today that the Bible itself
[1:31:11] is only a written record of a Living
[1:31:14] Word but we honor that above all and God
[1:31:18] protected it down through the years and
[1:31:21] men gave their lives to give us this
[1:31:24] Holy Scripture and so if you should come
[1:31:27] in contact with with anything above or
[1:31:30] beyond that make sure you understand
[1:31:33] that every dream and every vision and
[1:31:36] every gift and every feeling and every
[1:31:38] leading and every sensation and every
[1:31:42] inspiration must come
[1:31:45] back and lay upon the foundation of the
[1:31:49] absoluteness of the scripture and if you
[1:31:53] have an in spiration a vision a dream a
[1:31:56] word or you hear a sermon that cannot
[1:32:00] completely lie in the absolute
[1:32:03] foundation of the scripture you have an
[1:32:05] obligation as a holy ghost Christian not
[1:32:08] to condemn it but to lay it
[1:32:12] aside that's your job not to be
[1:32:15] critical but to just lay it aside and I
[1:32:18] believe that we can find enough even in
[1:32:22] this message of the hour as we call it
[1:32:25] which brother brandham when he's
[1:32:26] describing the message of the hour he
[1:32:28] calls it the whole Bible right the whole
[1:32:31] book that's what he refers to as the
[1:32:33] message but we have come to call it
[1:32:35] something else but remember that
[1:32:38] Revelation is Progressive sir and
[1:32:41] understand that if we take what we hear
[1:32:44] on those tapes we must take it as it
[1:32:48] lines up yes sir we're not Catholics no
[1:32:52] sir we don't believe in the in ereny of
[1:32:54] a pope or a prophet we believe that
[1:32:57] prophets are men God designed it that
[1:33:00] way we're thankful that we have an
[1:33:02] Earthly Angel who comes to speak on
[1:33:05] behalf of a Heavenly Angel he became the
[1:33:10] mouthpiece but I'm going to tell you
[1:33:12] something something's wrong around our
[1:33:15] ranks in this hour because we're not
[1:33:18] seeing in this hour what the scriptures
[1:33:21] have have presented as the right
[1:33:24] pattern the right pattern is let the
[1:33:27] forerunning messenger
[1:33:32] decrease so that he might have the
[1:33:37] preeminence among us and what we see
[1:33:40] happening as as uh so many are pulling
[1:33:43] away it has caused a chain reaction that
[1:33:47] causes uh ministers to bring people back
[1:33:51] uh constantly makes such an effort to
[1:33:54] bring people back to the messenger and I
[1:33:57] understand the need to do that always uh
[1:34:00] you know uh hanging on to pictures and
[1:34:03] and and I I I totally understand the
[1:34:05] need for that but please remember that
[1:34:09] Christ is to be glorified Among Us he is
[1:34:12] to be lifted up to the highest place he
[1:34:15] is to have full preeminence in the
[1:34:18] church and if you don't believe that's
[1:34:20] according to the message of the hour go
[1:34:21] home today and listen to the message
[1:34:24] that Christ is the mystery of God
[1:34:28] revealed three things God wanted to do
[1:34:31] in revealing Christ and uh get a hold of
[1:34:35] that and let that be your anchor in
[1:34:37] these uncertain times one more place of
[1:34:41] scripture if you don't mind Leviticus
[1:34:44] chapter 20 and I don't make any apology
[1:34:48] for that in fact I intend to say it even
[1:34:50] uh uh Bolder before I'm done l US 20: 23
[1:34:56] and ye shall not walk in the manners of
[1:34:59] the nation which I cast out before you
[1:35:03] for they committed all these things and
[1:35:07] therefore I abhor them remember the word
[1:35:10] abhor the strongest degree of hate God
[1:35:14] said I hated the way these people
[1:35:19] lived sir I hated it but I have said
[1:35:24] unto you ye shall inherit their land and
[1:35:28] I will give it unto you to possess it a
[1:35:32] land that floweth with milk and honey I
[1:35:35] am the Lord your God which have
[1:35:38] separated you from other people do you
[1:35:42] see that this little bride like Israel
[1:35:45] is to be a separated people unto the
[1:35:48] Lord unto the word ye shall therefore
[1:35:50] put difference between clean be
[1:35:54] yeast and unclean yes sir and between
[1:35:58] unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not
[1:36:03] make your souls
[1:36:06] abominable did I get it out abominable
[1:36:09] by Beast or by foul or by any manner of
[1:36:14] living thing that creepeth on the ground
[1:36:16] which I have separated from you as
[1:36:19] unclean now I just want to make one
[1:36:21] reference here and move quickly on
[1:36:23] before the bacon lovers get
[1:36:26] stirred you don't want to come against
[1:36:28] bacon folks you know but I just want to
[1:36:31] say that the word of God is telling us
[1:36:34] here that we we have to differentiate
[1:36:37] between clean and unclean what What's So
[1:36:40] Pro profound in this verse is that it
[1:36:43] tells us that that it has
[1:36:46] effect not only on the
[1:36:49] belly not only on the lip but it
[1:36:52] actually has an effect on the mind the
[1:36:56] will and the emotions yes sir it says
[1:37:00] Soul so what we
[1:37:03] eat can evidently have an effect on our
[1:37:07] mind our will and our emotions let's
[1:37:11] pray for all the sugar addicts in this
[1:37:14] place so that's that's established here
[1:37:16] in the scripture that what you eat can
[1:37:19] have an effect on your mind your will
[1:37:22] and your emotions especially an animal
[1:37:24] that God has said is unclean yes and ye
[1:37:28] shall be
[1:37:30] holy unto me for I the Lord why don't
[1:37:35] you help me read it am Holy and have
[1:37:40] severed you severed let's say that
[1:37:43] severed you from other people that you
[1:37:46] should be M I have cut you off that word
[1:37:50] severed there means to divide to
[1:37:53] separate to set apart and the last uh
[1:37:56] definition of that word in the Hebrew is
[1:37:59] to make distinction God has set a
[1:38:03] distinction upon his people sir amen and
[1:38:07] that means that anybody out there should
[1:38:10] be able to look at you listen to you
[1:38:13] spend time with you and
[1:38:17] know that you are not of this
[1:38:19] world come on now you are of another
[1:38:24] dimension you have another home how many
[1:38:27] of you have another home praise be to
[1:38:29] God father I thank you today for The
[1:38:32] Living Word and it is indeed the truth
[1:38:34] that we've taken a lot of time in
[1:38:37] preliminaries so we need you to come and
[1:38:40] help us today your word is already
[1:38:43] anointed but father we pray that you
[1:38:46] will send anointing to deliver it and
[1:38:49] anointing to receive it for the
[1:38:51] anointing destroyed is the Yoke and it's
[1:38:55] so easy for us to pick on a yoke uh of
[1:39:00] something in this life and we need to
[1:39:03] have that
[1:39:05] demolished broken destroyed so that we
[1:39:08] have Liberty to worship you in spirit
[1:39:13] and in truth and that we have Liberty to
[1:39:16] serve you a h among others who have
[1:39:21] paved the way before us we join in that
[1:39:24] great company of host who have paid the
[1:39:28] price and made it now God we thank you
[1:39:32] for the same Grace in the precious name
[1:39:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:39:38] church said you may be seated please do
[1:39:41] your best to stay with me because this
[1:39:44] is a well it's a
[1:39:47] foundation uh I won't be ministering
[1:39:49] again as far as I know this week until
[1:39:52] Saturday night
[1:39:54] and I'll give part one this morning and
[1:39:56] and most likely part two on Saturday
[1:39:59] night so that means you got to have a
[1:40:00] long memory that means you've got to
[1:40:02] hold on to this foundation so we have
[1:40:05] started in Leviticus and we have read
[1:40:07] these verses of scripture where God is
[1:40:09] speaking to Israel and he's saying I
[1:40:12] I've called you out from among the other
[1:40:15] nations and I have made you clean and I
[1:40:18] have left them as unclean and I want you
[1:40:21] to be a separated people uh uh uh
[1:40:24] separated he says it very clearly from
[1:40:27] other people I want you to be different
[1:40:29] I want you to be mine Peter tells us
[1:40:32] that we are a royal priesthood come on a
[1:40:36] holy
[1:40:37] nation now this is a one new man that
[1:40:40] Hawke was praying about he called it a a
[1:40:42] one new creation and that's what the
[1:40:44] scripture said neither Jew nor Gentile
[1:40:47] but called together under a covenant of
[1:40:50] God's Great Grace both the natural Seed
[1:40:54] of Abraham and the Royal spiritual Seed
[1:40:57] of Abraham we're together in this
[1:40:59] Covenant amen Gentiles were not an
[1:41:02] afterthought he had them in his mind
[1:41:05] from the foundation of the world he said
[1:41:08] you're going to have to join yourselves
[1:41:10] to those that I have chosen and you're
[1:41:12] going to have to submit and surrender to
[1:41:14] what I have required of them but there's
[1:41:17] coming a time that I'm going to bring
[1:41:19] fulfillment and every type and every
[1:41:22] shadow is going to have fulfillment and
[1:41:24] a reality and I want you to know when
[1:41:26] Jesus came he did that brother sister in
[1:41:29] fact he's still doing it today when I
[1:41:31] read the Old Testament I see Jesus there
[1:41:35] if you don't you might ought to rub your
[1:41:36] eyes and read it again because he's
[1:41:39] there in the Tabernacle he's there in
[1:41:42] the garments of the priest he's there in
[1:41:45] the Holy Temple he's there in the
[1:41:47] offering system and in the sacrifice
[1:41:51] system God is there and he's revealing
[1:41:55] that there's coming an hour like we
[1:41:56] preached last week when Abraham was
[1:42:00] about to take the son the life of his
[1:42:02] only son the angel of the Lord and the
[1:42:06] voice of Eternity stopped him and and
[1:42:09] said wait a minute I I have prepared a
[1:42:12] sacrifice God in essence saying you
[1:42:14] didn't have to do it but you had to be
[1:42:16] willing to do it and the Bible said he
[1:42:19] lifted up his eyes and he saw and that
[1:42:22] lifting up of his eyes is a Hebrew idiom
[1:42:26] a Hebrew expression that talks about not
[1:42:29] just lifting up your eyes and seeing
[1:42:31] what is a few feet or a few yards away
[1:42:34] from you but spiritually lifting up your
[1:42:37] eyes and seeing a future fulfillment
[1:42:40] because it was right there on Mount
[1:42:42] Moria on Mount Mariah that our Lord our
[1:42:47] sacrificial perfect lamb would hang so
[1:42:51] one ram gave his life life that day as a
[1:42:54] substitute for Isaac but how many of you
[1:42:57] are thankful for a bleeding lamb who
[1:43:00] came God's word made flesh to die for us
[1:43:05] and we still enter in by grace and we
[1:43:08] still enter in today by the blood of the
[1:43:11] Lamb not by your belt
[1:43:14] buckle on not by the picture you carry
[1:43:18] in your
[1:43:19] wallet not by the sign over your door
[1:43:23] not by saying I believe the
[1:43:26] message you enter in by the blood of the
[1:43:30] Lamb because demons believe and
[1:43:34] tremble you might have to argue with
[1:43:37] people about whether or not William
[1:43:38] brandom was a prophet but you'll never
[1:43:40] have to argue with a demon about it
[1:43:43] because if he's presenting anything
[1:43:45] other than that he's just trying to fool
[1:43:47] you because he knows the plan of God for
[1:43:51] the end time he knows the economy of God
[1:43:55] he knows how the revelation of Jesus
[1:43:57] Christ was to be made real to a little
[1:43:59] bride in the last days because as Christ
[1:44:03] is the manifestation of God Christ is
[1:44:06] the mystery of God revealed he said
[1:44:09] there would be a bride yes sir a multim
[1:44:13] membered body that would be the mystery
[1:44:16] of Christ revealed yes sir he said all
[1:44:19] that was in the father
[1:44:21] he poured into the and everything that
[1:44:24] was in the
[1:44:25] sun Jesus he poured into his
[1:44:28] church now brother if that don't excit
[1:44:31] you then something's wrong like I said
[1:44:34] Sunday if that doesn't stir your soul
[1:44:36] your spoons fell out of your bowl you
[1:44:38] need to get your spoon back because
[1:44:41] these things that we have heard all so
[1:44:43] long ago they are more real today than
[1:44:46] they have ever been we're living in the
[1:44:49] season of the coming of the Lord he's
[1:44:52] here right he's here in Bride form
[1:44:56] already yes sir and one day he's coming
[1:44:59] to receive a bride he came the first
[1:45:02] time to do what to redeem the bride he's
[1:45:07] coming the next time to receive the
[1:45:10] bride and then we say the second coming
[1:45:13] which is really a third coming so to
[1:45:15] speak he
[1:45:16] comes with the bride he came to
[1:45:20] Bethlehem yes sir didn't he do it just a
[1:45:23] little baby in the arms of a mother and
[1:45:25] a father he came that way to later die
[1:45:28] on a cross and redeem a bride then he's
[1:45:31] coming well he doesn't put his feet on
[1:45:34] the on the Earth but he comes in clouds
[1:45:36] of Glory he receives a bride unto
[1:45:39] himself so the Rapture is about Christ
[1:45:43] receiving his bride out of this world
[1:45:45] somebody said I don't believe in that
[1:45:47] doesn't matter what you believe in
[1:45:49] nobody's asking you what you believe
[1:45:51] we're just saying what the word said for
[1:45:53] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:45:55] heaven first with a
[1:45:58] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:46:00] and the last Trump of God and the dead
[1:46:02] and cry shall rise first and we which
[1:46:05] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:46:08] together to meet the Lord in the air
[1:46:11] don't forget the rest of that verse and
[1:46:14] so shall we ever be with the
[1:46:18] Lord that is an eternal promise it's not
[1:46:22] one that H are you with me this morning
[1:46:25] that's not one that has an expiration
[1:46:27] date oh do you mind if I take a little
[1:46:30] water good why don't you take if you've
[1:46:32] got some why don't you take some with me
[1:46:34] so I don't feel alone and the rest of
[1:46:36] you just wished you had
[1:46:40] some I would say Wet My Whistle but it
[1:46:44] was more than my whistle that needed
[1:46:46] some water
[1:46:48] there so many years ago I preached a
[1:46:50] sermon that got me kicked out of the
[1:46:53] ranks so I've been I've been living most
[1:46:56] of my life uh on the outside of the
[1:47:00] camp and uh my name no longer appears in
[1:47:03] the in the in the announcements of big
[1:47:06] conventions and camp meetings and so
[1:47:08] forth I'm just a little spoke on the
[1:47:10] wheel thank God I'm okay with that 100%
[1:47:14] but I thought if it caused me so much
[1:47:16] trouble way back
[1:47:17] when why not revive
[1:47:21] it oh seems like my I'm gaining more
[1:47:25] friends so so why not thin them out
[1:47:30] again F them out again if people get too
[1:47:33] excited over your ministry and you
[1:47:35] realize that it got you in trouble one
[1:47:37] time when people did that then you you
[1:47:39] you ever now and again have to come and
[1:47:41] kind of thin out the crowd a little bit
[1:47:43] so that you don't start thinking more
[1:47:45] highly of yourself than you
[1:47:48] should we're just a humble we must be
[1:47:51] just just claying his hand it's not us
[1:47:55] so so the name of the sermon that got me
[1:47:57] in so much trouble was to's
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] company but three is a
[1:48:05] Crowd Oh I preach that all over in the
[1:48:08] 90s and you know it's it's just kind of
[1:48:11] amazing to me that most people remember
[1:48:13] me for 12-ft Shuffle and House of hell
[1:48:16] and one more night with the frogs and I
[1:48:19] mean I get inboxes on Facebook almost
[1:48:22] every week speak from people who say I
[1:48:25] was in your meeting in Michigan in Ohio
[1:48:28] in Virginia and Arizona and I heard you
[1:48:30] preach some of those sermons but very
[1:48:32] few ever mentioned two two stand out one
[1:48:36] was the image of the
[1:48:38] Prophet which I preach from the
[1:48:40] scripture and the message of the hour
[1:48:42] concerning the fact that brother
[1:48:44] brandham tells us that the statue that
[1:48:46] was made in the days of Daniel Shadrach
[1:48:48] Meshach and Abednego was not likely the
[1:48:51] image of the King as it has been
[1:48:54] presented to us but more likely the
[1:48:56] image of the Prophet so I preached a
[1:48:59] sermon about the image of the prophet
[1:49:01] and I preached that there were at least
[1:49:03] three boys in that crowd that said I
[1:49:05] love him too
[1:49:08] much I love him too much that's Daniel
[1:49:11] that's an image of Daniel I love him too
[1:49:14] much to bow my knee and worship him as
[1:49:18] Lord you can only imagine how that
[1:49:20] stirred the the soup
[1:49:23] and then this one two is company but
[1:49:26] three is a crowd how many of you like
[1:49:29] people let me see your
[1:49:32] hand some of you aren't being very
[1:49:35] honest cuz I never see you with
[1:49:38] anybody I didn't raise my hand because
[1:49:42] the only struggles I've ever had in life
[1:49:44] were
[1:49:47] people it doesn't mean you don't like
[1:49:50] people particularly but it means that
[1:49:52] you have to understand that you come to
[1:49:54] a place where you are slightly peopled
[1:49:58] out you don't hate people but you've
[1:50:01] just had a lot of folks and you just
[1:50:03] pull back a little bit and get your
[1:50:05] breath and re scriptural scriptural you
[1:50:09] know Jesus was was up in in Lebanon the
[1:50:12] southern part of Lebanon trying to get
[1:50:14] some
[1:50:15] rest and his disciples were there to
[1:50:18] make sure he got it and here come a
[1:50:19] little woman have mercy on me my
[1:50:21] daughter grievously vexed with the devil
[1:50:24] and and and he tried to get rid of
[1:50:26] her but how many of you know there's
[1:50:28] certain amount of Faith there that you
[1:50:30] just can't get rid of he tried to insult
[1:50:33] her and he did a good
[1:50:36] job he said you know the dogs eat the
[1:50:38] crumbs if all I I I mean he said it's
[1:50:41] not meat to take the children's
[1:50:43] bread the Lord said and cast it to the
[1:50:46] dog and she didn't say oh like like a
[1:50:49] 2024 Christian would a 20 24 Christian
[1:50:53] would say oh I got my feelings hurt I
[1:50:55] ain't never going back there no more I
[1:50:56] don't want nothing to do with him he's
[1:50:58] just a charlatan come on she it was too
[1:51:01] late to tell her he wasn't real she just
[1:51:04] kept screaming out even more have mercy
[1:51:07] on me my daughter's grievously vexed
[1:51:09] with the devil and when he told her that
[1:51:11] that uh you know that the healing is the
[1:51:14] children's bread and doesn't belong to
[1:51:17] her she said truth Lord but even the
[1:51:20] little dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[1:51:23] from the master's table Jesus said I've
[1:51:26] never seen such faith in
[1:51:29] Israel I had to get out among the the
[1:51:31] other other folks to find somebody who
[1:51:34] would believe but scripturally he was
[1:51:37] there to take his rest and it's all

[1:52:50] company companions
[1:52:53] and to add to the
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:53:00] mix there's just a time let me let me

[1:53:11] while and then I'm going to say it

[1:53:21] wedding and we have rented a big old
[1:53:24] limousine you know where I'm going don't
[1:53:26] you and I thought the purpose of renting
[1:53:29] that big old limousine was to bring the
[1:53:31] bridal
[1:53:32] party to the reception isn't that what
[1:53:36] you thought it would be about I mean why
[1:53:38] do you need that big old vehicle just to
[1:53:40] take you and your newly married wife
[1:53:42] over to the over to the oh it's getting
[1:53:44] quiet in here you know where I'm going
[1:53:45] don't you and I said well honey I guess
[1:53:48] we'll just bring all the groomsmen and
[1:53:51] bridesmaids over I guess guess it just
[1:53:52] all ride with us to the reception and
[1:53:55] and I don't want to overdo it I don't
[1:53:57] and I don't want to embarrass my wife
[1:53:58] any more than she needs to be
[1:53:59] embarrassed but I just want to kind of
[1:54:01] tell you how she did she's
[1:54:07] said
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:11] uh-uh now she don't say that all that
[1:54:14] much lately
[1:54:16] but in those
[1:54:20] days she was people out for a while no
[1:54:23] it's not that at all she just wanted to
[1:54:26] be with
[1:54:28] me she wanted to smooch me let's just
[1:54:31] tell it right out
[1:54:33] here she wanted to smooch me and she
[1:54:37] thought Two's Company
[1:54:41] today and Three's a Crowd there's a time
[1:54:45] for a
[1:54:46] buddy and there's a time for just you
[1:54:52] lover lips do you know what I'm
[1:54:56] saying so I I began to research the uh
[1:55:01] where does that come from Two's Company
[1:55:03] threes a crowd it's an idiom that means
[1:55:06] a third person is not welcome when two
[1:55:10] people want to be
[1:55:15] alone and let me just go ahead and say
[1:55:17] this cuz some of you are
[1:55:19] purple I notic this it's not single
[1:55:22] people that are purple it's all you that
[1:55:24] are married that are
[1:55:26] purple uh sometime it's not about
[1:55:30] smooching sometime it's just about
[1:55:33] sitting quietly drinking coffee together
[1:55:37] and you just want it to be you and your
[1:55:40] love you
[1:55:43] understand what's
[1:55:45] that in each other's company you know
[1:55:49] what that requires some time it even
[1:55:51] requires you to put down your phone
[1:55:56] sometime but but I can tell you that
[1:55:58] sometime just being in a room with the
[1:56:00] one you love you're reading your thing
[1:56:03] she's reading her
[1:56:05] thing that can be in itself
[1:56:08] precious it it doesn't always have to be
[1:56:11] conversation but it this this title to
[1:56:14] company through a crowd it's an idium
[1:56:16] that means a third person is not welcome
[1:56:18] when two people want to be alone for
[1:56:20] example you might say
[1:56:22] well I'll leave you two love birds alone
[1:56:26] two is
[1:56:28] company three is a crowd this expression
[1:56:31] alludes to a third person spoiling the
[1:56:35] privacy of a pair of lovers and was
[1:56:37] already a proverb used in the year
[1:56:45] 1546 I mean folks got it a long time ago
[1:56:47] more than folks get it
[1:56:49] today and do you know what they were
[1:56:51] saying in
[1:56:54] 1846 and this wasn't talking about
[1:56:56] automobiles it was talking about carts
[1:56:58] and
[1:56:59] wagons it was Two's Company the three is
[1:57:02] a crowd is and that's a fifth
[1:57:07] wheel you got four wheels on the cart
[1:57:10] you don't necessarily need the fifth
[1:57:12] wheel does anybody know where I'm coming
[1:57:14] from yes sir let's look at Genesis I'm
[1:57:17] going to need you to help me look at
[1:57:19] Genesis 24: 1 through n this was not my
[1:57:23] message today I I uh I built three
[1:57:27] messages this week and I thought I had
[1:57:29] settled but in the night just like last
[1:57:32] Saturday night the Lord came and he
[1:57:34] changed my mind and I had to get up this
[1:57:36] morning and build something entirely
[1:57:38] from scratch but I knew that this was
[1:57:40] the leading of the Lord to sort of set
[1:57:43] the theme of the camp meeting that in
[1:57:45] all things
[1:57:48] he that's right you know it's not
[1:57:51] necessarily church about pulling
[1:57:53] something else
[1:57:54] down it's it's just about putting him up
[1:57:59] Jesus referring to his crucifixion said
[1:58:02] if I be lifted
[1:58:05] up I will draw all men unto me he was
[1:58:11] speaking about being lifted up on the
[1:58:13] cross but how many of you know in
[1:58:15] another level of understanding we can
[1:58:18] say today that if we're busy lifting
[1:58:21] Jesus up
[1:58:23] people sometimes say today making Jesus
[1:58:26] famous that's exactly what we ought to
[1:58:28] be trying to do it's make sure that
[1:58:31] everybody knows he's the number one
[1:58:33] number one king of kings and Lord of
[1:58:38] lords he must have the
[1:58:52] when we share the gospel we should be
[1:58:55] sharing who Jesus
[1:58:59] is we should be more concerned about
[1:59:02] getting people to the New
[1:59:06] Birth than we should unscrambling the
[1:59:08] godhead for them because once you get
[1:59:12] people to the New Birth Jesus said in
[1:59:15] Red Letters when he the spirit has come
[1:59:18] he will lead you and guide you in to all
[1:59:22] truth that's right come on now so it's
[1:59:27] not always feasible to tell somebody uh
[1:59:30] in such and such a sermon 1956 paragraph
[1:59:34] 301 because some people will look at you
[1:59:37] like you've got two heads but what you
[1:59:39] can tell them is who Jesus is in your
[1:59:43] life folks aren't looking for a
[1:59:45] historical Jesus they're looking for one
[1:59:47] that has skin on
[1:59:49] him today one who's walking around in
[1:59:53] your shoe leather our life is a living
[1:59:57] epistle it's a living letter it's a
[1:59:59] living book read by all men and
[2:00:02] sometimes we don't want them to know but
[2:00:05] they're watching us anyway Genesis 24
[2:00:08] and Abraham was old and well stricken in
[2:00:11] age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in
[2:00:15] all things and Abraham said unto his
[2:00:18] eldest servant of his house that ruled
[2:00:21] over all that he had put I pray thee thy
[2:00:25] hand under my thigh and I will make thee
[2:00:29] swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and
[2:00:34] the god of the earth that thou shalt not
[2:00:37] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[2:00:42] of the
[2:00:44] Canaanites uh this is from the region uh
[2:00:48] of of Canan of Canaan the AR original
[2:00:52] inhabitants of the land so to speak and
[2:00:56] if you wanted to bring some sort of a
[2:00:59] modern
[2:01:00] terminology brother brandham often
[2:01:02] referred to that region as Palestine
[2:01:06] because it was very correct to do so in
[2:01:09] that hour it's never been called
[2:01:12] Palestine Palestine came not not
[2:01:15] biblically it came from philistia H
[2:01:18] where we get the
[2:01:20] Philistines this was always land that
[2:01:23] God had his eye on for his people a and
[2:01:28] so uh Abraham was concerned why because
[2:01:31] God had brought him out of the land of
[2:01:33] er of the calans and caused him to
[2:01:36] separate from everything that he knew he
[2:01:39] left family be behind he left so many
[2:01:42] things he broke off he's constantly
[2:01:44] having to separate himself from
[2:01:46] everything familiar sir to go and find a
[2:01:50] land that he didn't even know where it
[2:01:52] was he didn't know how to get there but
[2:01:54] God said you come separate yourself unto
[2:01:57] me and I will make he he stood him up on
[2:02:01] the place of Elon Moray and told him to
[2:02:04] look over the land he said I'm going to
[2:02:06] make your seed as plentiful as the Sands
[2:02:10] of the seashore and as the stars of the
[2:02:13] heaven he later told Abraham all the
[2:02:15] nations of the Earth are going to be
[2:02:17] blessed because of your seed how many of
[2:02:19] you know that is absolutely nothing but
[2:02:21] the truth we have seen the Fulfillment
[2:02:23] of that in in the in the refounding of
[2:02:26] the modern state of Israel there's no
[2:02:29] doubt about it the technology that has
[2:02:31] rolled out of Israel has blessed the
[2:02:34] nations of the
[2:02:36] world paraplegics have
[2:02:39] walked because of the
[2:02:42] technology that has come out of Israel
[2:02:44] lugar's
[2:02:48] disease so many things
[2:02:52] in fact there are treatments available
[2:02:55] in Israel that we will never see in the
[2:02:58] United States of America because of the
[2:03:02] bureaucracy bureaucracy and the red tape
[2:03:05] that we have in our Health Care system
[2:03:08] in fact I know of of many situations
[2:03:11] like this and my wife does as well where
[2:03:14] men were entering the United States with
[2:03:20] inventions that could ere eradicate some
[2:03:22] of the
[2:03:24] diseases that wipe out so many people in
[2:03:28] this nation they were
[2:03:31] arrested their devices
[2:03:34] confiscated and the ability to rebuild
[2:03:37] and make
[2:03:39] outlawed come on and then they get in
[2:03:42] the news and debunk the possibility of
[2:03:45] this being able to help
[2:03:47] anybody when Israel is not just hoping
[2:03:50] so there doing
[2:03:53] it what a shame what a shame that people
[2:03:57] would not have access to the to the
[2:04:00] great grace of God that he has put upon
[2:04:04] uh the Jewish people that they would be
[2:04:06] able to pull some of these things
[2:04:08] together now God has brought him out
[2:04:11] he's left everything behind and it is
[2:04:14] his deepest concern now that his son
[2:04:17] Isaac not marry a woman of of the nation
[2:04:22] of the land why was that such a concern
[2:04:26] I read it to you in
[2:04:28] Leviticus anybody with me God wanted to
[2:04:31] make sure that his people were separated
[2:04:35] from other peoples sir and so Abraham
[2:04:38] when it come time for Isaac to have a
[2:04:41] wife he wanted a Kinsman he he wanted a
[2:04:45] relative he he wanted someone related to
[2:04:48] his family as it was done in that time
[2:04:52] and so he calls Eleazar in and he makes
[2:04:56] a covenant a vow he said uh H I will
[2:05:00] make thee swear by the Lord the god of
[2:05:02] Heaven and the god of the earth that
[2:05:04] thou shalt not take a wife unto my son
[2:05:06] of the daughters of the Canaanites among
[2:05:08] whom I dwell let's read on but Thou
[2:05:10] shalt go un my country to my Kindred and
[2:05:14] take a wife unto my son Isaac now
[2:05:17] wouldn't you think he'd be taking Isaac
[2:05:19] with him
[2:05:23] but that's not what happened let's read
[2:05:25] on and the servant said unto him per
[2:05:28] Adventure the woman what if the woman
[2:05:31] will not be willing to follow me unto
[2:05:34] this
[2:05:35] land must I needs bring thy son
[2:05:39] again unto the land from whence thou
[2:05:43] camest now make sure you understand
[2:05:46] elaser is saying what if I get there and
[2:05:48] I can't I can't find a woman who will
[2:05:50] come back
[2:05:52] should I then quickly return to you are
[2:05:55] you here should I quickly return to you
[2:05:58] and bring Isaac and then take him back
[2:06:00] to your to your people to your
[2:06:03] countrymen oh I tell you this is not
[2:06:06] what Abraham wanted at all let's read on
[2:06:10] and Abraham said unto him beware that
[2:06:13] thou that thou bring not my son thither
[2:06:18] again leave him here the Lord God Of
[2:06:21] Heaven which took me from my father's
[2:06:23] house and from the land of my Kindred
[2:06:25] and which spake unto me and that swear
[2:06:28] unto me saying unto thy seed will I give
[2:06:31] this land he listen he shall
[2:06:35] send his Angel before
[2:06:43] thee eleazer don't worry what her answer
[2:06:47] will
[2:06:47] be don't worry whether or not she'll be
[2:06:51] willing follow you into a Strange Land
[2:06:53] to marry a man she's never laid eyes on
[2:06:56] I need some help you just know this that
[2:06:59] the Lord God the one who called me out
[2:07:03] the one who promised me an eternal
[2:07:05] inheritance he will send his
[2:07:08] Angel not Earthly come on now he will
[2:07:12] send his Angel to go before thee and
[2:07:16] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[2:07:19] then in other words El it's going to be
[2:07:22] all right and if the woman will not be
[2:07:24] willing to follow thee then Thou shalt
[2:07:26] be clear from this my oath you're
[2:07:29] forgiven pardon if if God doesn't do it
[2:07:33] if God doesn't send the angel before if
[2:07:35] the woman refuses to hear the
[2:07:38] angel you are let off the hook yes sir
[2:07:42] but you need to know right now I'm not
[2:07:44] going to let my son go off to that land
[2:07:48] god called my seed out out of that place
[2:07:53] hello now and I'm not going to let him
[2:07:56] go back amen you know in essence Abraham
[2:07:59] is saying I'd rather him live a life
[2:08:02] without a
[2:08:04] wife than to join himself to a woman
[2:08:08] from a people that God has rejected
[2:08:11] because of their Pagan
[2:08:14] ways I would rather him live a lonely
[2:08:18] life now this is pretty important
[2:08:22] because Abraham has to have some
[2:08:24] seed and without a wife Isaac is not
[2:08:27] going to be able to do that remember
[2:08:30] what happened when Jacob went and told
[2:08:31] Abraham a few chapters later Jacob said
[2:08:34] I found me a wife from among the Heathen
[2:08:37] come
[2:08:39] on Abraham said drag that boy do
[2:08:42] whatever you have to do you go find that
[2:08:44] that boy a wife it didn't matter that he
[2:08:47] already picked him
[2:08:49] one Abraham was going to make sure that
[2:08:53] it was a wife of Ken one who God had beg
[2:08:58] to make promises to even though they
[2:09:01] were not even aware they were not even
[2:09:02] aware of what God was doing down in the
[2:09:04] land yet uh email and texting was not
[2:09:07] available at the time is anybody still
[2:09:09] with me okay and then he said you're not
[2:09:13] going to bring my son therei again and
[2:09:14] the servant put his hand under the thigh
[2:09:17] of Abraham his master and swear to him
[2:09:21] concerning that matter now I want to
[2:09:24] read from uh from the sign of this time
[2:09:27] just a moment I want you to get the
[2:09:28] flavor of this he said like
[2:09:31] eleazer representative coming from
[2:09:34] Abraham see to pick up the bride to
[2:09:37] Isaac the beautiful Rebecca obedient the
[2:09:42] model servant see he was about his
[2:09:46] master's business alone he's describing
[2:09:50] the character of
[2:09:53] elaser and now he's going to type it out
[2:09:56] for us he said what a
[2:09:59] type of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:02] today what did we sing a few moments ago
[2:10:06] the the Blessed Holy Spirit from the
[2:10:08] father God above hath come down to earth
[2:10:11] to find a worthy bride here brother
[2:10:14] brandham tells us that the ministry of
[2:10:17] eleazer the servant of Abraham is a type
[2:10:20] of the Holy spirit and he said the same
[2:10:23] thing picking out a bride see in the in
[2:10:28] the evening time when the lights are
[2:10:31] going out now if you're still awake go
[2:10:34] with me to Genesis 24 and look at verse
[2:10:36] 10 for a moment I I just hesitated to
[2:10:41] read all these verses but as I started
[2:10:44] going through them I couldn't find ones
[2:10:46] to leave out so here we go and the
[2:10:49] servant took
[2:10:51] 10 camels of the camels of his master
[2:10:55] and departed for all the goods of his
[2:10:58] master were in his hand and he arose and
[2:11:01] went to Mesopotamia unto the city of
[2:11:04] nahor and he made his camels to kneel
[2:11:08] down without the City by a well of water
[2:11:11] at the time of the evening even the time
[2:11:14] that women go out to draw water now let
[2:11:17] me just insert here that
[2:11:20] Josephus a Jewish historian describes
[2:11:24] what that Trek would have been like the
[2:11:28] Bible leaves it out the Bible makes it
[2:11:31] sound like he went across
[2:11:33] town and found a whale but we're talking
[2:11:37] about a long distance over many many
[2:11:41] Hills and down through many many valleys
[2:11:44] and places where there were no roads
[2:11:47] Abraham knew the way but he had to make
[2:11:50] a off hard journey to get over in the
[2:11:53] first place now Eleazar is returning
[2:11:56] back there are no
[2:11:58] highways there are hundreds of miles
[2:12:01] where there is nothing but dirt and
[2:12:03] hills and uh you know like brother
[2:12:06] Brandon would say scorpions and Cactus
[2:12:08] and you know it's just a desert out
[2:12:11] there but he gets there he finds a well
[2:12:14] and he said oh Lord God of master of my
[2:12:19] master Abraham I pray thee send me good
[2:12:23] speed this day and show kindness unto my
[2:12:26] master Abraham stay with me behold I
[2:12:29] stand Here by The Well of water and the
[2:12:32] daughters of the men of the city will
[2:12:34] come out to draw water and he said or
[2:12:38] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[2:12:41] to whom I shall say let down thy picture
[2:12:44] I pray thee that I may drink and she
[2:12:47] shall say drink and I will give thy
[2:12:50] camels drink
[2:12:51] also I I want you to notice that that
[2:12:54] eleazer is making it a little more
[2:12:57] difficult it's not so much that a woman
[2:13:01] would say I'll give you some of my
[2:13:03] water but she saw them 10 thirsty
[2:13:07] camels does anybody have any idea how
[2:13:10] many bathtubs of water it would take to
[2:13:12] fill up those thirsty camels and did
[2:13:15] anybody realize that she didn't go over
[2:13:17] there and turn on a faucet no sir and
[2:13:20] and she didn't have a hand pump no sir
[2:13:23] did anybody think about the fact that
[2:13:25] she had to draw buckets of water out
[2:13:27] skins of water out of deep deep Wells
[2:13:31] they had to dig these Wells extra deep
[2:13:33] because of the dry terrain of the desert
[2:13:37] and now she has uh he said if if this
[2:13:40] right woman comes may she not only offer
[2:13:44] to draw me water to drink but may she
[2:13:48] offer to give water to my C anals

[2:15:05] was placed upon him to hunt a bride for
[2:15:10] Isaac eleazer of Damascus was a great
[2:15:13] man he was favored by Abraham notice he
[2:15:16] wasn't a Jew he was a Syrian he was
[2:15:20] favor by Abraham and he was trusted by
[2:15:23] Abraham to go out and hunt a bride a
[2:15:26] right type of a bride for his son Isaac
[2:15:30] though uh through that would bring forth
[2:15:33] Christ see it's a lineage that was being
[2:15:36] protected it's a bloodline that was
[2:15:38] being preserved are you with me now
[2:15:40] Eleazar being a spiritual man knowed
[2:15:43] what it
[2:15:45] meant he's not born a Jew but he's lived
[2:15:50] in the house of a spiritual man yes sir
[2:15:52] and he has become spiritual he said the
[2:15:55] right kind of a woman had to be that
[2:15:57] man's wife and how would he choose
[2:16:01] it in the hour of his desperation when
[2:16:05] he arrived at the city he prayed and
[2:16:07] said Lord God that's the thing when you
[2:16:10] get desperate listen what he's telling
[2:16:11] us not just for a wife not just for a
[2:16:15] husband but when you get desperate go to
[2:16:20] praying
[2:16:22] how many of you have got something that
[2:16:23] you're passionate for and you're
[2:16:26] desperate to see
[2:16:27] happen why not
[2:16:29] now why not this week yes sir so if you
[2:16:33] feel any desperation toward something
[2:16:37] let's go to
[2:16:38] praying brother bam said Lord God let
[2:16:41] the first maid that comes forth and
[2:16:44] Waters the camel and gives me a drink be
[2:16:47] that he prayed in the hour of his
[2:16:51] desperation Rebecca the beautiful maid
[2:16:54] came watered the camel and then he said
[2:16:57] don't delay me in my way I'm on a
[2:17:00] mission I've got something I've got to
[2:17:03] accomplish she had to come
[2:17:06] listen where is Isaac Isaac is at home
[2:17:11] sir at father's house
[2:17:15] right it has fallen the responsibility
[2:17:19] of eleazer to find the right kind of
[2:17:22] wife yes sir for the son of his master
[2:17:28] Abraham she had to
[2:17:32] come you've got to come yes sir she had
[2:17:36] to come to a time of
[2:17:39] decision whether she would go she was a
[2:17:43] type of the
[2:17:44] Bride would she go and marry a man who
[2:17:48] she has never ever even
[2:17:53] seen
[2:17:56] oo just think about it we live in a
[2:18:00] society where attraction is often based
[2:18:03] on look instead of
[2:18:05] character what is Rebecca going to do if
[2:18:08] she gets back and he's
[2:18:10] ugly on now what is she going to do this
[2:18:15] is not even in her heart he said now
[2:18:18] that's a great thing never even seen him
[2:18:21] yet she had only heard about him by his
[2:18:28] servant the thing that I appreciate the
[2:18:32] most about this ministry that God has
[2:18:36] sent to
[2:18:37] us is that he made
[2:18:42] Jesus a living Hebrews 13 and8
[2:18:49] reality he didn't just tell the people
[2:18:51] he is the same he
[2:18:54] demonstrated sir hello that he is the
[2:18:58] same the blind saw the deaf heard the
[2:19:01] lame got up and walked the dead were
[2:19:03] raised he didn't just tell that he's the
[2:19:06] same he showed that he was the same in
[2:19:09] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[2:19:11] tells us that it's going to be up to the
[2:19:16] church to do the same thing yes sir
[2:19:19] we're not just going to be able to tell
[2:19:21] people he's the same we're going to have
[2:19:23] to show
[2:19:25] them that Jesus Christ is still the
[2:19:28] Savior that he's still the Healer that
[2:19:31] he's still the
[2:19:33] deliverer somebody said what is it going
[2:19:35] to take to get us to that place well
[2:19:37] desperations is going to help bring us
[2:19:39] in we're going to have to be struck by a
[2:19:44] desperation that drives us to our knees
[2:19:48] we're going to have to believe that the
[2:19:51] angel of the Lord will go before
[2:19:54] us and work on the other end of the
[2:19:59] line when you know God's telling you to
[2:20:02] witness to somebody when you know God's
[2:20:04] telling you to share with somebody
[2:20:06] you've got to hope and believe that the
[2:20:08] Lord is already preparing their heart
[2:20:11] because if God is not working on their
[2:20:13] heart they're going to cold refuse you
[2:20:16] but what if God is already on the other
[2:20:19] end he stirring them up and they know
[2:20:22] they've got to get straightened out they
[2:20:24] may even be praying Lord send somebody
[2:20:26] to
[2:20:28] me send somebody to
[2:20:31] me send somebody who will tell me what I
[2:20:35] need to do he said not never even seen
[2:20:38] him yet she had only heard by his
[2:20:42] servant he said that's a type of the
[2:20:44] Bride you've never seen Christ but you
[2:20:46] hear by his servants what he is you sell
[2:20:50] out everything stay with me folks this
[2:20:52] is vitally important leave your homes
[2:20:56] everything else it takes to go and find
[2:21:02] him nothing is more important than
[2:21:05] finding him hello nothing is more
[2:21:08] important not a career not an education
[2:21:12] not a
[2:21:14] relationship he said now notice she made
[2:21:19] the decision
[2:21:22] and what a decision it was he said a
[2:21:25] type of the Bride she left her comfort
[2:21:29] zone oh there you go brother brandom
[2:21:31] said she left her denominational home
[2:21:34] yes to go and see you see there are
[2:21:37] still people in this hour that are that
[2:21:39] are kind of hooked in to the name on the
[2:21:42] sign huh and when they're looking for a
[2:21:45] church they're looking for a church sign
[2:21:47] that says something like Assembly of God
[2:21:49] or church of God or Baptist or Methodist
[2:21:53] they're they're looking for a
[2:21:55] flavor come on and that's where they
[2:21:58] feel the most comfortable and maybe
[2:22:00] that's where Grandma
[2:22:02] went and something like that maybe
[2:22:04] granddaddy was a part of that many many
[2:22:06] years ago so they feel some kind of pull
[2:22:09] and some kind of connection but I want
[2:22:11] you to know there's a decision that has
[2:22:13] to be made in this hour and that is are
[2:22:16] we going to hold on to what is familiar
[2:22:20] oh come on now are you going to hold on
[2:22:23] to what is
[2:22:25] dying or you going to turn loose of that
[2:22:28] and find something that still has a
[2:22:33] heartbeat you see this Bride Can Only
[2:22:36] survive so long in a
[2:22:39] cemetery there comes an hour you say
[2:22:42] well isn't the word enough and we'll
[2:22:44] just uh press play and Obey and we'll do
[2:22:48] this and that and the other I want you
[2:22:49] to know we've been told the importance
[2:22:52] of an atmosphere of gathering together
[2:22:55] with Believers worshiping the Lord
[2:23:00] together to be
[2:23:02] transformed nothing could be more
[2:23:04] important than that and so we go on stay
[2:23:07] with me I know I keep saying that
[2:23:09] Genesis uh verse 24:1 16 now and the
[2:23:12] damsel I don't usually read this much
[2:23:15] and the damsel was very fair to look
[2:23:17] upon a virgin neither had any man known
[2:23:19] her and she went down to the well and
[2:23:22] filled her piter and came up and the
[2:23:26] servant ran to meet her and said he he
[2:23:29] he's about to do his part he's about to
[2:23:31] rehearse his part of the line he said I
[2:23:33] pray thee drink a little water of thy
[2:23:35] picture give me just a little sip of
[2:23:37] water from your picture and she's just
[2:23:41] as Fair beautiful uh uh like we
[2:23:43] described Rebecca her middle name is
[2:23:45] radiant and today is her birthday and
[2:23:47] we're preaching on Rebecca I want you to
[2:23:49] see uh her but a little older way
[2:23:54] older I want you to see her older she's
[2:23:57] at the well she's radiant she's she's
[2:24:00] shiny and here comes this old dusty old
[2:24:05] coder he's been through the desert his
[2:24:07] feet are dirty he stinks he smells like
[2:24:10] the camels that he's
[2:24:12] leading and he walks right up to her and
[2:24:14] he says could I have a little sip of
[2:24:17] water from your picture and she said
[2:24:20] drink my Lord she immediately honored
[2:24:23] his his age she honored him as an elder
[2:24:26] as a Lord she said drink my Lord and she
[2:24:30] hastened and let down her picture upon
[2:24:33] her hand and gave him a drink she took
[2:24:36] it down off of her shoulder she held it
[2:24:38] over to him and she gave him a drink of
[2:24:40] her
[2:24:41] water the water that she had Drew for
[2:24:44] her own family are you following this
[2:24:48] and and she and it goes on and she
[2:24:51] hasted and when she had done giving him
[2:24:53] drink she
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:56] said I got a feeling that he was thirsty
[2:24:59] bone dry he drank about half the
[2:25:03] picture and she's standing there looking
[2:25:05] you said a drink you really meant a
[2:25:08] drink didn't you you're just drinking
[2:25:10] drinking drinking drinking drinking so
[2:25:12] she now knew that she was going to have
[2:25:14] to draw again to fill up her picture
[2:25:18] please understand these were water pots
[2:25:20] that are about like this these are huge
[2:25:22] water pots that they had to carry like
[2:25:24] this on their shoulder he's took a lot
[2:25:27] of that water she can't go home with a
[2:25:29] half half jug she's going to have to
[2:25:31] draw again to fill up the jug that she
[2:25:33] just filled and and for some
[2:25:37] outlandish come on
[2:25:40] now reason she said yes uh I'll draw
[2:25:45] water for thy camels
[2:25:47] also and she didn't say I'll just give
[2:25:49] them enough to with their
[2:25:51] whistle how many of you know the camel
[2:25:53] doesn't just drink for himself right
[2:25:56] that moment he drinks for after a while
[2:25:59] he fills up his Reservoir she said I woo
[2:26:02] hear this I'm going to give them water
[2:26:06] until they're finished
[2:26:08] drinking I don't know how many times
[2:26:11] she'd have to send that bucket down to
[2:26:13] fill up those camels and she didn't
[2:26:15] slack about it she hasted and emptied
[2:26:18] her pitcher into the TRU and ran
[2:26:22] again unto the well to draw water and
[2:26:27] Drew and Drew and Drew and Drew and
[2:26:32] Drew for all of his camels can you see
[2:26:37] this great effort that she's putting out
[2:26:41] a and the man wondering at
[2:26:44] her he asked God to do it that's right
[2:26:48] he did but he didn't think there was a
[2:26:50] woman anywhere on planet Earth that
[2:26:54] would do
[2:26:58] it he you know he may have expected more
[2:27:01] like get it

[2:28:11] that she's not doing herself and
[2:28:15] more when it comes that that that's the
[2:28:18] woman that God gave me I'm thankful for
[2:28:21] her
[2:28:21] today I'm thankful for you who have
[2:28:24] found a wife like that who goes above
[2:28:27] and beyond do you know why I found a
[2:28:29] wife like that I was looking for one
[2:28:31] like that I wasn't looking in the
[2:28:35] bar I I wasn't looking on a drunk
[2:28:38] somewhere I wasn't looking in The Honky
[2:28:39] Tonk I wasn't looking in the biker
[2:28:41] Club I was looking among God's people I
[2:28:44] was looking in the house of the Lord
[2:28:47] come on now in the household of faith
[2:28:49] that that's where women of virtue like
[2:28:51] that can be found that's what the
[2:28:53] scripture said and the man wondering at
[2:28:56] her held his peace he wanted to spill it
[2:28:58] all right then he wanted to say Woo
[2:29:01] you're the
[2:29:03] one I've come to get
[2:29:06] you I'm taking you back to a foreign
[2:29:09] land and marrying you off to my master's
[2:29:13] son but he held his peace to whe whether
[2:29:16] the Lord had made his journey prosperous
[2:29:18] or not because he knew that even though
[2:29:21] she had fulfilled the test she had sort
[2:29:24] of fulfilled the feast the the fleece
[2:29:26] excuse me he knew that something had to
[2:29:29] change in her sir I want you to hear me
[2:29:34] something had to change in her heart
[2:29:37] right there was nothing about her that
[2:29:39] said I want to leave my town I want to
[2:29:41] leave my family I want to leave nothing
[2:29:43] about her would have caused you to think
[2:29:46] that she was looking for a ticket out of
[2:29:48] there so he said I'm I better keep this
[2:29:50] to myself just now it came to pass as
[2:29:54] the camels had done drinking that the
[2:29:56] man took a golden earring of a half a
[2:29:58] shekele weight and two bracelets for her
[2:30:01] hands of 10 shekels weight of
[2:30:05] gold and said whose daughter art thou
[2:30:09] tell me I pray thee is there room in thy
[2:30:12] father's house for us to Lodge
[2:30:15] in and she said unto him I'm the
[2:30:17] daughter of bethuel the son of Mila
[2:30:20] which she bear unto Nahar what verse are

[2:30:30] moreover we have both straw and
[2:30:32] provender enough and room to Lodge
[2:30:36] in shake your neighbor and say sleep
[2:30:39] later but Wake Up Now The Preacher's
[2:30:41] preaching a long time but you need to
[2:30:42] hear it and the man bowed down his head
[2:30:46] and worshiped the Lord he's getting the
[2:30:48] idea this is her this is her this is her
[2:30:52] this is her this is her he bowed down
[2:30:55] his head in worship and he said bless be
[2:30:57] the Lord God of my master Abraham who ha
[2:31:00] not left destitute my master of his
[2:31:03] mercy and his truth I being in the
[2:31:06] way hear it I'm on a mission of
[2:31:10] dedication and
[2:31:12] obedience I being in the way the Lord
[2:31:15] led me to the house of my Master's
[2:31:18] brethren
[2:31:20] and the damsel ran and told them of her
[2:31:24] mother's house these things now in the
[2:31:29] message time of decision I hope you're
[2:31:31] listening paragraph 27 and it was in the
[2:31:35] evening time when he come to the well
[2:31:38] near the city and it was about that time
[2:31:40] that Rebecca had
[2:31:41] to she had to make a decision I want you
[2:31:45] to say that again Rebecca had to make a
[2:31:48] decision I believe the angel of the Lord
[2:31:51] beat him there
[2:31:55] listen about half
[2:31:58] hour if God is in this Arrangement the
[2:32:02] angel of the Lord is going to go before
[2:32:05] you and he is going to prepare the heart
[2:32:08] of the young
[2:32:09] maiden and she's going to be willing to
[2:32:13] follow you wherever it
[2:32:16] is that you need to go
[2:32:20] yes sir that's right brother random said
[2:32:22] I believe the angel of the Lord beat
[2:32:24] beat beat Eleazar there by about a half
[2:32:26] an
[2:32:27] hour oh praise God it only took 30
[2:32:32] minutes to help her make the right
[2:32:36] decision must have been the angel of God
[2:32:39] listen it must have been the angel of
[2:32:42] God that spoke to Rebecca's heart
[2:32:52] when God began to give us our children
[2:32:54] we begin to pray that he would show us
[2:32:57] their
[2:32:59] Destiny and we were blessed when God
[2:33:02] showed us that their Destiny was in this
[2:33:05] ministry and that God was going to plant
[2:33:08] them here to help us do the work of the
[2:33:11] Lord it was beyond our desire it's what
[2:33:15] the Lord showed
[2:33:17] us and when Benjamin met Jenna we didn't
[2:33:20] know
[2:33:21] Jenna Jenna came from a large
[2:33:25] Church much larger than this Jenna has a
[2:33:29] large family huge
[2:33:33] family I think when they're all gathered
[2:33:36] together be over a hundred or more of
[2:33:38] them her dad has many brothers and
[2:33:43] sisters the parents the grandparents are
[2:33:46] still alive and they're a close family
[2:33:49] and they get together and as the more we
[2:33:51] begin to
[2:33:53] learn the more concerned we begin to
[2:33:57] be and I remember finally saying to
[2:34:00] Benjamin you know honey you you you
[2:34:02] better find
[2:34:03] out before this thing goes too far you
[2:34:07] better find out if she will be
[2:34:11] willing to leave what she has always
[2:34:14] known and follow you so that you can
[2:34:18] walk in your destiny
[2:34:20] right and the Jenna that I thought I
[2:34:23] knew I wasn't sure what her decision
[2:34:26] would
[2:34:26] be but I had to throw myself on the
[2:34:30] mercies of the Lord and pray and believe
[2:34:33] these
[2:34:35] verses that if she was indeed the one
[2:34:39] that God had called for for him that the
[2:34:42] angel of the Lord would go before her
[2:34:45] and touch her before him and touch her
[2:34:49] heart
[2:34:52] heart and he
[2:34:54] did she loved him so
[2:34:59] much that she was
[2:35:02] willing to leave everything she was
[2:35:05] familiar with behind and embrace his
[2:35:11] Destiny somebody said well doesn't a
[2:35:13] woman have a Destiny she does and it's
[2:35:16] up to
[2:35:18] God to bring the right woman and the
[2:35:22] right man together because it's a it's a
[2:35:26] destiny that has to be walked
[2:35:29] out it doesn't always look the same the
[2:35:32] logistics may be a little different as
[2:35:34] we go along but there there comes a time
[2:35:39] that in in a situation like that that a
[2:35:41] woman has to
[2:35:43] say it's not that I want to leave what I
[2:35:46] love it's not that I want to leave what
[2:35:49] is uh you know familiar to me but I
[2:35:53] recognize the call listen the destiny
[2:35:57] that was on Isaac was of such importance
[2:36:00] that the promise of God the word of the
[2:36:04] Lord was at
[2:36:07] stake I'm going to make your seed as
[2:36:11] plenteous as the Sands of the seashore
[2:36:14] and the stars of Heaven Isaac couldn't
[2:36:16] do that by himself there had to be a
[2:36:22] Rebecca who was willing to say the
[2:36:27] destiny that God has laid on your life
[2:36:31] is more
[2:36:35] important than what I
[2:36:37] want and what I desire I I appreciate
[2:36:41] that little bit of help because it gets
[2:36:44] pretty it gets pretty
[2:36:47] hairy in the hour that we're living
[2:36:49] living in it can be a lot of
[2:36:52] fighting it can be a lot of
[2:36:55] misunderstanding because the in the New
[2:36:57] Testament Jesus talks about the fact
[2:37:00] that a that a man would have to leave
[2:37:02] his mother and father and cleave unto
[2:37:05] his wife and there's no doubt about it
[2:37:08] it is very important that a man be
[2:37:11] willing to do that you can't take Mama
[2:37:15] side against
[2:37:17] wife you can't take Daddy's side against
[2:37:21] wife when that commitment is made you
[2:37:25] have joined yourself to one another and
[2:37:28] that's how it has to be amen but a
[2:37:33] Destiny is is over both of their lives
[2:37:37] they might not have seen the end yet of
[2:37:40] either they might not have discerned
[2:37:42] what the end will be but but love love
[2:37:47] comes love comes and when Love
[2:37:51] Comes see well well how could Rebecca
[2:37:54] have loved what she didn't
[2:37:57] see what she didn't know well let me
[2:38:00] tell you something when the angel of the
[2:38:02] Lord Goes
[2:38:04] Forth he can put a love in your heart
[2:38:07] for something you don't know anything
[2:38:10] about you hear a truth that you can't
[2:38:12] dissect and you can't explain but
[2:38:14] something in your heart says that's the
[2:38:17] truth
[2:38:19] I love that
[2:38:21] truth you couldn't explain it yet you
[2:38:25] you couldn't ground it in the word yet
[2:38:28] but something in you lays a hold of that
[2:38:32] and says that's part of who I
[2:38:34] am I'm going to follow that through are
[2:38:38] you with me that Rebecca had to make a
[2:38:41] decision he said I believe the angel of
[2:38:43] the Lord beat him there about half an
[2:38:44] hour I'm hurrying for he will send his
[2:38:47] angels before you then makes the the way
[2:38:50] clear and it must have been it must have
[2:38:54] been the angel of God that spoke to
[2:38:56] Rebecca's heart said go get the
[2:38:58] water because Rebecca didn't know what
[2:39:01] Eleazar was praying and Rebecca came to
[2:39:04] the Water of Life
[2:39:07] when at the evening time give me just a
[2:39:13] moment he said you get the picture it's
[2:39:16] the church in the last days the evening
[2:39:20] time the evening lights are here it's
[2:39:22] the time that the angel of the Lord in a
[2:39:25] Supernatural is revealing himself to the
[2:39:31] Rebecca to the
[2:39:34] bride the angel of the Lord that's not
[2:39:39] an ordinary Angel that's the angel of
[2:39:42] the Covenant that's the angel with a
[2:39:45] rainbow about his head that angel is not
[2:39:49] brother brandham that angel is the Lord
[2:39:53] Jesus Christ the angel and messenger of
[2:39:57] the Covenant it's found right grounded
[2:40:01] in the scripture but here he is on the
[2:40:05] earth manifesting himself dealing with
[2:40:10] people's hearts he said is revealing
[2:40:13] himself to the Rebecca the Bride of
[2:40:15] Isaac and somehow or another she's moved
[2:40:20] to go to the
[2:40:23] waters yes of life she didn't even know
[2:40:27] how thirsty she
[2:40:29] was she didn't know how dissatisfied she
[2:40:32] was but all of a sudden when the angel
[2:40:35] of the Lord visits her she starts
[2:40:37] getting this hunger I've got to get to
[2:40:39] the water I've got to get to the water
[2:40:41] I've got to get to the water and so she
[2:40:42] goes to the well hello it's a natural
[2:40:46] typing a spiritual and a spiritual
[2:40:48] typing something that plays out in the
[2:40:51] natural can you say amen and so he goes
[2:40:54] on oh my heart is turning over with joy
[2:40:56] listen as I read these verses not these
[2:40:59] quotes particular but as I read the
[2:41:00] scriptures today this morning going over
[2:41:02] them again I began to weep at the table
[2:41:05] my wife said are you all right what are
[2:41:07] you saying I said honey I'm not talking
[2:41:09] to
[2:41:10] you I got so moved I got so stirred in
[2:41:14] hearing this story in reading this story
[2:41:18] again I remember remember my own story I
[2:41:21] remember how the angel of the Lord
[2:41:23] prepared my heart to make the right
[2:41:28] decision I didn't know the ins and the
[2:41:30] outs I didn't know the what ifs and the
[2:41:33] maybe I didn't know what the future
[2:41:36] would look like all I knew is that I had
[2:41:38] heard something like I had never heard
[2:41:42] before and my heart was burning and
[2:41:46] yearning for more and if if it meant
[2:41:49] leaving my people if it meant leaving my
[2:41:53] church I was pastoring a church if it
[2:41:55] meant leaving my church if it meant
[2:41:57] leaving my friends it didn't matter to
[2:42:00] me anymore all I knew was I had to get
[2:42:03] to the well I had to get to the well I
[2:42:06] had to get to the well the evening time
[2:42:08] has come the angel of the Lord's in the
[2:42:10] message he goes forth and Woos the
[2:42:12] Rebeca to come to the Waters of Life the
[2:42:15] moving of the supernatural not a painted
[2:42:19] fire but a real fire amen uh paragraph
[2:42:23] 29 so why did Rebecca make that sudden
[2:42:26] move why did she make that sudden move
[2:42:29] why did she go to the Waters of life so
[2:42:31] quickly why could she could the angel
[2:42:33] speak to her because listen because she
[2:42:37] was a blood relation to
[2:42:44] Isaac had she not been a Kinsman had she
[2:42:47] not been of the family had she not been
[2:42:50] of the same bloodline she might not have
[2:42:52] received the words of the
[2:42:54] Angel there was something laying in her
[2:42:57] there was a destiny already in her there
[2:42:59] was a blood already in her come on there
[2:43:02] was a gene already in her there was a
[2:43:04] representation of life already in her
[2:43:08] and that's why she could hear the word
[2:43:09] of the Angel that's why her heart could
[2:43:11] already be
[2:43:12] ready so that when elaser got there she
[2:43:16] didn't have any
[2:43:18] hesitation he said he said now blood
[2:43:21] relation and that's who the angel can
[2:43:23] speak to tonight I'm going to say this
[2:43:25] morning is a blood relation by the blood
[2:43:27] we are born into the body of Christ
[2:43:30] Rebecca was Isaac's own cousin by both
[2:43:32] fathers which made them blood relation
[2:43:36] and the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[2:43:38] Sanctified how through the blood of
[2:43:41] Christ and an open vessel for the Holy
[2:43:43] Spirit to do what to speak to don't you
[2:43:47] ever be shut off off to the voice of the
[2:43:52] spirit because he may speak to
[2:43:57] you she'll come no wonder she'll come to
[2:44:02] the
[2:44:04] Waters of
[2:44:06] life he that heareth let him come to the
[2:44:10] Waters of Life freely the bride

[2:44:15] thirsty let him come blessed are ye when

[2:45:30] widow it won't be an easy

[2:45:44] a few just a fleeting moment together I

[2:46:15] just wanted to make sure
[2:46:20] but God had already moved on her heart
[2:46:22] her heart had already opened and love

[2:46:26] to talk about liking one
[2:46:29] another what what if I would have said

[2:47:15] in the
[2:47:17] message there's something in the message
[2:47:20] that stirs
[2:47:22] them maybe they've never heard anything
[2:47:24] that long before maybe they've never
[2:47:25] heard anything that loud before maybe
[2:47:28] they've never heard anything that out of
[2:47:30] out of out feel before unorthodox before
[2:47:33] but something in their heart
[2:47:36] yes I put in the tape spoken word is the
[2:47:40] Original Seed never heard a tape message
[2:47:43] like that never heard a sermon like that
[2:47:45] never heard a topic like that never
[2:47:47] heard a title like that but I want you
[2:47:49] to know the angel of the Lord had come
[2:47:53] before preparing my heart to receive
[2:47:57] what was my
[2:47:58] destiny
[2:48:00] amen my heart was already stirred by the
[2:48:05] message from the angel of the Lord that
[2:48:07] Holy Spirit preparing me oh can't you
[2:48:09] see the picture of the Angel of the Lord
[2:48:11] leading her the angel of the Lord was
[2:48:13] leading
[2:48:14] her then she was stirred and immediately
[2:48:17] when she watered the camp
[2:48:20] the gift went on
[2:48:23] her and he began to take out the
[2:48:26] earrings which means oh wait just a
[2:48:29] minute don't be a
[2:48:31] jezebel and hang all that stuff on you
[2:48:34] like you're some kind of Christmas tree
[2:48:35] or something and you need ornaments he
[2:48:38] said why this means that
[2:48:41] Faith cometh by hearing you
[2:48:45] see put the bracelets on and that
[2:48:49] doesn't mean to deck herself out and
[2:48:51] tingle and tinkle and make noise when
[2:48:54] she walks like people want to do today
[2:48:57] something in their heart makes them want
[2:48:59] the the flashy flashy flashy and the
[2:49:02] blingy blingy blingy can you imagine

[2:49:39] need them earbobs she didn't need all
[2:49:42] those bracelets to decorate herself this
[2:49:45] was a spiritual message coming The Works
[2:49:47] of your hands
[2:49:49] he said the bracelets talk about the
[2:49:51] works of your hand the earring is
[2:49:54] talking about hearing faith comes by
[2:49:58] hearing he got her
[2:50:02] ready as soon as she began to water give
[2:50:05] the Waters of Life testify tell others

[2:55:36] you know that that was the natural Seed
[2:55:38] of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of
[2:55:41] Abraham let's go on he said well if elas
[2:55:43] are the messenger hunting the bride and
[2:55:45] trying to find character if that man is
[2:55:47] come a messenger of the last day trying
[2:55:49] to find the bride for Christ he will not
[2:55:52] look for a denominational membership
[2:55:54] he's not going to check the name on the
[2:55:56] door and make sure it's something he's
[2:55:57] heard of before he will look for
[2:56:00] character that's willing
[2:56:03] watch good character first then to get
[2:56:07] her ready to meet Isaac after he found
[2:56:10] the character then get her stand still
[2:56:12] long
[2:56:15] enough to listen to the message of Isaac
[2:56:18] she needed to know a little bit about
[2:56:19] what Isaac was about she needed to know
[2:56:22] a little bit about what Abraham was
[2:56:24] about right so so he had to begin to
[2:56:27] tell her a little
[2:56:28] bit you know he's the
[2:56:31] son of of your relative Abraham oh yeah
[2:56:36] I I I heard of him he left here in a
[2:56:41] huff he turned his back on all of us and
[2:56:44] went off into a Strange Land following
[2:56:47] an unknown God
[2:56:49] a God who is
[2:56:50] invisible the Jews belied that Abraham's
[2:56:53] father was an idol maker and all you had
[2:56:55] to do was go down to his shop and buy
[2:56:57] whatever God you wanted to
[2:56:59] worship now Abraham rejects the religion
[2:57:03] of his father and his family and goes
[2:57:04] off to a Strange Land and he's hearing
[2:57:08] voices I'm not so sure about cousin
[2:57:11] Abraham he's hearing voices you know
[2:57:13] talking to himself and talking out loud
[2:57:15] like there's somebody listening and
[2:57:17] answering a voice that no one else can
[2:57:19] hear but Abraham I want you to know she
[2:57:21] could have said all those
[2:57:23] things and so we understand that Eleazar
[2:57:26] just begin to lay it out God's keeping
[2:57:28] his promise God's doing for Abraham what
[2:57:31] he told him that he was going to do and
[2:57:33] the time has now come that Isaac have a
[2:57:35] bride because it's about to be the time
[2:57:38] that the seed are going to begin to come
[2:57:40] and multiply why she could have said
[2:57:42] wait a minute I don't want but one
[2:57:44] child two is more than enough you said
[2:57:47] his seed's going to be like the Sands of
[2:57:49] the seashore I don't want to be the
[2:57:51] mother of all that
[2:57:55] sand I don't mind to be the mother of a
[2:57:57] few stars but I don't want to be the
[2:57:59] mother of all the stars she could have
[2:58:01] said a lot of things but God Was
[2:58:04] preparing her heart that she would stand
[2:58:07] still long enough and hear what Isaac
[2:58:10] was all
[2:58:11] about she didn't believe the
[2:58:16] gossip good brother
[2:58:20] someone said to me last Sunday after
[2:58:22] being here in the service said I came
[2:58:24] here having heard all kinds of things
[2:58:28] but I didn't find any of that didn't see
[2:58:30] any of that didn't feel any of that all
[2:58:32] I felt was the genuine Holy Spirit in
[2:58:35] the
[2:58:37] house what if Rebecca would have
[2:58:39] listened to All the gossip about crazy
[2:58:41] old
[2:58:42] Abraham and Prejudiced herself against
[2:58:45] this destiny that God was calling her to
[2:58:48] but rather she was prepared by the angel
[2:58:50] of the
[2:58:52] Lord he said that's the measure of the
[2:58:54] last days the evening light first find
[2:58:56] the church where they will believe the
[2:58:58] message hunted can you read what I'm
[2:59:00] talking
[2:59:02] about he said hunt where the church is
[2:59:04] that'll even let you come in won't close
[2:59:06] the door in your faith what do you think
[2:59:09] about Austin Hodes going up there to a
[2:59:11] church a few weeks ago and and preaching
[2:59:13] to a bunch of people that don't believe
[2:59:15] like we believe there's the answer
[2:59:19] if they'll open the door and you've got
[2:59:21] a mind to go
[2:59:22] go tell them what's right and don't cram
[2:59:25] it in their face live it make them

[3:06:16] Lord hath prospered my way send me away
[3:06:19] that I may go to my master it wasn't you
[3:06:21] they was worried about it was Rebecca
[3:06:23] they wanted to hold on to Rebeca well he
[3:06:24] wasn't going to leave without her that's
[3:06:26] right and they said we will call the
[3:06:28] damsel and inquire at her mouth she's
[3:06:31] already agreed to
[3:06:32] go and they called Rebecca and said unto
[3:06:35] her wilt thou go with this man she said
[3:06:37] I will go and they sent away Rebecca
[3:06:40] their sister and her nurse and Abraham's
[3:06:42] servant uh uh and his men and they
[3:06:45] blessed Rebecca she had the final
[3:06:49] say mama said I want you to stay 10 more
[3:06:52] days uncle said I want you to stay 10
[3:06:54] more days but he wasn't up to Uncle and
[3:06:56] it wasn't up to Mama and it wasn't up to
[3:06:59] anybody else it was up to Rebecca had
[3:07:01] the angel of the Lord prepared her heart
[3:07:04] had he placed a love in her heart for
[3:07:07] somebody that you hadn't even
[3:07:12] met on now they called she said I'll go
[3:07:15] they sent her away and they blessed
[3:07:16] Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our
[3:07:18] sister be thou the mother of thousands
[3:07:20] of millions and let thy seed possess the
[3:07:24] gate woo of those who hate them come on
[3:07:27] now this is prophecy and Rebecca arose
[3:07:30] and her damsels and they rode upon the
[3:07:32] camels and followed the man and the
[3:07:35] servant took Rebecca and went his
[3:07:39] way brother brandham says this and then
[3:07:43] there was another great decision that
[3:07:44] had to be made then after she was given
[3:07:47] the parents said well I just let her
[3:07:48] stay around 10 let her hang around the
[3:07:50] Revival to really feel whether she was
[3:07:52] decided to do it or not you know let her
[3:07:54] have a moment she might want to change
[3:07:56] her mind he said I haven't got much
[3:07:59] confidence in a person make a decision
[3:08:01] to wait even until
[3:08:07] tomorrow don't put off what you know
[3:08:10] God's doing but the message stirred
[3:08:12] Rebecca she was satisfied that the
[3:08:14] message was from God so the parents said
[3:08:16] oh let her STI around a while she'll get
[3:08:18] over it it's just a little excitement
[3:08:20] now she was over to that Revival you
[3:08:22] know and blah blah blah come on but he
[3:08:24] said the true servant said don't weary
[3:08:26] us don't hinder us a lot of Servants of
[3:08:28] God has been hindered by put off
[3:08:30] decisions don't hinder me seeing that
[3:08:32] the Lord has sent me seeing that he's
[3:08:34] been good to me don't hinder me then
[3:08:37] they said let her make her own decision
[3:08:41] that's where you stand tonight make your
[3:08:44] own decision every Rebecca
[3:08:48] come
[3:08:48] on I've been a Rebecca somebody said I
[3:08:52] can't even relate to that I've been a
[3:08:54] Rebecca you've been a Rebecca yes sir
[3:08:57] let her make her own decision tonight
[3:09:01] yes sir if she knows that it's right why
[3:09:06] would she hinder linger and T then they
[3:09:10] called Rebecca and said will you go with
[3:09:11] this man or do you want to stay around a
[3:09:13] little while to see whether you really
[3:09:14] want to or not how long does it take
[3:09:17] take my goodness she said I will go and
[3:09:20] she was ready her decision was
[3:09:22] what quickly made she know there's
[3:09:26] something been leading
[3:09:28] her she knowed something had happened to
[3:09:30] her and she knew that it was God and she
[3:09:33] was satisfied that she wanted to go
[3:09:35] quickly that's what happens when God's
[3:09:37] working on both ends of the line so she
[3:09:40] put on her garment and she she got all
[3:09:42] the gifts that was sent to her by the
[3:09:43] father to meet the son oh God if the
[3:09:45] church could only make that decision
[3:09:47] right quick to put on all the gifts all
[3:09:49] of her gifts and climbed on the camel
[3:09:51] and did what took off now I'm closing
[3:09:54] musicians are coming and I'm stopping
[3:09:57] I'm just having to just
[3:10:01] stop but I want you to summarize this in
[3:10:04] your
[3:10:07] mind the best part is is yet to
[3:10:11] come because when we pick this up we're
[3:10:14] going to find that Rebecca is riding on
[3:10:17] the very camel that she
[3:10:21] watered isn't that powerful the very
[3:10:25] thing brother bam said the very thing
[3:10:26] that you've watered the very thing that
[3:10:27] you've poured into is a thing that's
[3:10:30] going to take you to where you're
[3:10:31] supposed to be isn't that amazing so
[3:10:34] when you come in here praising God
[3:10:36] you're
[3:10:37] watering you're pouring water on him
[3:10:39] that's right when you come in here with
[3:10:41] a true genuine Amen to the word you are
[3:10:44] pouring water on the very thing you are
[3:10:46] water in the very thing that's going to
[3:10:49] pack you all the way now look this way
[3:10:52] look this way just a minute hear me just
[3:10:55] a
[3:10:55] second and then we're going to get to
[3:10:58] something even greater than
[3:11:00] that and anybody any real preacher could
[3:11:03] have already gotten there but I'm not
[3:11:05] him so I couldn't make it
[3:11:09] yet when they get
[3:11:14] close Isaac comes out of the tent he's
[3:11:17] been staying in his mother's
[3:11:20] tent he's he's grieving A lot's going
[3:11:25] on and he's been sleeping in his
[3:11:28] mother's
[3:11:29] tent
[3:11:31] and he he leaves the tent and the Bible
[3:11:34] says he goes out in the
[3:11:36] field Rebecca's never seen him and she's
[3:11:40] riding up on that Camel brother I want
[3:11:42] you to know having been one who's rode a
[3:11:46] camel she wasn't looking too
[3:11:49] pretty her hair was dirty her face was
[3:11:52] dirty she smelt like a
[3:11:55] camel whether she had on them gold
[3:11:57] earrings and bracelets and all that she
[3:11:59] must have I mean she must have looked
[3:12:01] like a fancy dirty woman I don't
[3:12:05] know but oh listen the Bible said and
[3:12:08] Isaac lifted his eyes he's standing out
[3:12:10] in the field here comes eleazer riding
[3:12:12] along Here Comes Rebecca riding along On
[3:12:14] a camel and the scripture said and he
[3:12:16] lifted up his eyes
[3:12:20] and he saw
[3:12:23] her brother bam said it was love at
[3:12:25] first
[3:12:26] sight in that moment he loved her and in
[3:12:31] that
[3:12:31] moment she loved
[3:12:35] him there was nobody there to say we
[3:12:37] ought to take another three months and
[3:12:39] discuss
[3:12:42] this there was nobody there to say we we
[3:12:45] better make sure this is right
[3:12:50] the Bible
[3:12:51] said she come down off of that
[3:12:55] Camel and he took
[3:12:59] her where did he take her right back to
[3:13:02] the tent where he'd been sleeping right
[3:13:03] back to his mother's
[3:13:05] tent without a full ceremony without a
[3:13:08] big
[3:13:11] hoopla there was a covenant that was
[3:13:14] made in that
[3:13:15] tent when two people became one
[3:13:20] person she would have never been there
[3:13:23] had it not been for the for the teaching
[3:13:25] for The
[3:13:27] Obedience of
[3:13:30] Eleazar she would have never known that
[3:13:32] it was time for Isaac to have a bride
[3:13:35] she would have never been eligible she
[3:13:37] would have never found herself at the
[3:13:39] right place at the right time had God
[3:13:41] not sent eleazer had Abraham not sent
[3:13:45] eleazer over there to get her I want you
[3:13:48] to hear
[3:13:50] this she wouldn't have known she
[3:13:52] wouldn't have been there it wouldn't
[3:13:54] have
[3:13:54] happened but because God through Abraham
[3:13:57] sent Eleazar over there told her what
[3:14:00] the situation was told her what it was
[3:14:02] like in the household of his master she
[3:14:04] said I'll go family said stay a while no
[3:14:07] I'll go I'm ready to go now I know this
[3:14:09] is what I'm supposed to do so they ride
[3:14:12] that long journey when they get back she
[3:14:14] sees him in the field he sees her on the
[3:14:17] monkey they love one another from the
[3:14:19] moment that they lay eyes on one another
[3:14:21] they know this is right this is it he he
[3:14:25] he takes her helps her off she gets off
[3:14:27] he leads her to his mother's tent and
[3:14:30] they consummate their commitment one to
[3:14:36] another wouldn't have happened without
[3:14:40] eleazer but when we get to that
[3:14:42] scripture on Saturday night and we read
[3:14:45] about it it simply tells us and he took
[3:14:48] her into his mother's
[3:14:50] tent she became his I'd like to ask you
[3:14:53] a question as we close to give you a
[3:14:55] little thought of what will be Saturday
[3:14:58] night where was
[3:15:05] eleazer we're not reading about
[3:15:11] him he had to report to
[3:15:14] Abraham he had to make sure the rest of
[3:15:16] the the servants got back to the house
[3:15:18] he had to make sure the camels were
[3:15:20] brought he had to make sure that the he
[3:15:22] was not finished until he stood before
[3:15:24] his master Abraham and said job is
[3:15:28] finished
[3:15:30] sir what do you mean the job is I found
[3:15:33] her did she hesitate no she didn't
[3:15:36] hesitate well where is she I want to
[3:15:38] meet
[3:15:41] her well
[3:15:44] sir when Isaac saw her
[3:15:48] he loved
[3:15:49] her when she saw him she loved
[3:15:55] him they're in Sarah's
[3:15:58] tent he's taking her for his
[3:16:03] wife I don't have to describe to you
[3:16:06] what that
[3:16:07] means what it looks like everybody in
[3:16:10] this room knows that in that moment once
[3:16:13] you get to the bridegroom
[3:16:17] once you have met the bridegroom to's
[3:16:25] company threes a
[3:16:28] crowd she didn't drag eleazer in the
[3:16:31] tent and say tell me
[3:16:35] more Isaac didn't drag eleazer in the
[3:16:39] tent and say now catch me up on the
[3:16:43] details
[3:16:47] because the work that Eleazar was sent
[3:16:49] to do was
[3:16:51] done and nobody's going to forget
[3:16:54] Eleazar I want you to know he was given
[3:16:57] great
[3:16:59] riches great honor great respect for his
[3:17:04] labor of obedience and for not letting
[3:17:06] anything distract him in the way and
[3:17:08] when we speak of him today yes sir we
[3:17:12] speak of him with honor and respect
[3:17:14] because of the job the loyal y that he
[3:17:17] showed The Obedience that he showed the
[3:17:20] price that he paid to get Rebecca back
[3:17:23] to Isaac amen but the emphasis for
[3:17:27] Rebecca is no longer on
[3:17:30] eleazer yes
[3:17:33] sir if you were to visit uh Rebecca's
[3:17:39] home it wouldn't be every wall a picture
[3:17:44] of
[3:17:45] eleazer Sir on
[3:17:47] come on
[3:17:50] now it wouldn't be that everybody who
[3:17:53] walks in Rebecca's home and Isaac's home
[3:17:56] would have to sit down and hear the
[3:17:57] whole thing on and I need to tell you
[3:18:01] about the cloud and I need to tell you
[3:18:03] about the picture in Houston and I need
[3:18:05] to tell you about the bridge and I need
[3:18:07] to tell you about this and I there's a
[3:18:09] time for that it's right it happened and
[3:18:12] there's a time for that but I want you
[3:18:14] to know there's also a time when who is
[3:18:18] company it's you and Jesus it's you and
[3:18:22] the word it's you and the bridegroom
[3:18:25] you'd better be careful I better be
[3:18:28] careful how I try to drag somebody else
[3:18:31] in to that moment of consummation to
[3:18:34] that moment of the fullness of of the
[3:18:38] relationship stand the relationship
[3:18:40] please the
[3:18:44] relationship he came like Eleazar of old
[3:18:48] he came with a message he came to
[3:18:51] introduce us to our
[3:18:55] Isaac and like John the Baptist the
[3:18:59] messenger of the first
[3:19:01] coming he knew the day would
[3:19:04] come I must
[3:19:07] decrease and he must increase if you
[3:19:10] leave this place visitor or or home folk
[3:19:14] if you leave this place and you go out
[3:19:15] there and you say well he was just
[3:19:16] bringing brother brandham down he was
[3:19:18] just tearing him down he was just
[3:19:19] pulling him down you are so wrong and I
[3:19:22] refuse to accept your characterization
[3:19:25] of what's happened here today because
[3:19:28] lifting up
[3:19:29] Jesus letting him have preeminence is in
[3:19:32] the
[3:19:33] church letting him be the reason why we
[3:19:36] sing and the reason why we preach and
[3:19:37] the reason why we worship and the reason
[3:19:39] why we dance and the reason why we dress
[3:19:41] holy and the reason why we believe that
[3:19:43] God is one and the reason why we're
[3:19:44] baptized in jesus' name and Theon reason
[3:19:47] why we know we have to have the Holy
[3:19:48] Ghost letting Jesus be the
[3:19:50] reason it's not pulling anybody down or
[3:19:54] disrespecting any
[3:19:56] messenger had it not been for elaser
[3:20:00] most of us would have never known who
[3:20:02] Isaac really
[3:20:04] is but the reality comes that when the
[3:20:07] Covenant was sealed yes sir it's not the
[3:20:10] image of a prophet that I want to
[3:20:15] see just let let me see him let me spend
[3:20:19] time in that word let me be
[3:20:22] changed it doesn't mean not listen oh
[3:20:25] my we've got to hear this message has
[3:20:28] been saved for us we've got to hear
[3:20:31] spiritual food in due season we've got
[3:20:33] to show it it's our daily bread it's our
[3:20:35] food it fits the word it's got to be a
[3:20:38] part of our lives but we must listen I I
[3:20:44] hear them singing songs about the cloud
[3:20:46] I I hear them singing songs about Sabino
[3:20:50] Canyon and I hear them singing all these
[3:20:53] songs and putting brother brandom's name
[3:20:55] in and and when I sit there I I know in
[3:20:59] my heart I know in my heart that that
[3:21:02] would be such an embarrassment to
[3:21:06] him he he would be so
[3:21:09] ashamed so embarrassed that the
[3:21:12] attention was on him all of the these
[3:21:16] years since his death he's hanging on
[3:21:20] every wall of the church the pictures
[3:21:22] everywhere it's the reason why some
[3:21:25] people
[3:21:28] gather I feel like he would certainly be
[3:21:32] embarrassed I heard him singing just
[3:21:35] recently that about the message is the
[3:21:37] coming of the lord and there is a truth
[3:21:40] there the message is the coming of the
[3:21:42] Lord but what if some generation comes
[3:21:45] along Our Generation Young Generation
[3:21:47] and hears that and they believe that
[3:21:50] that's the only coming what what if they
[3:21:52] get a hold of that and they think well
[3:21:54] because he came in an appearance and
[3:21:57] because he came in the fullness of his
[3:21:58] word through his bride that he's not
[3:22:00] coming I want you to know he has
[3:22:04] come it's like Jesus said of John the
[3:22:07] Baptist he's coming but he's come
[3:22:11] already I want to say that he's coming
[3:22:15] he's come already in the fullness of his
[3:22:17] word but that doesn't mean that he's not
[3:22:19] coming one day in the Clouds Of Glory to
[3:22:23] receive a bride unto himself we're
[3:22:26] nearer to that than we have ever been
[3:22:28] before it's not your preacher you need
[3:22:30] in the tent with you it's not the
[3:22:32] prophet you need in the tent with you
[3:22:34] it's not some old dusty song you go in
[3:22:36] singing it's you and the lamb it's you
[3:22:41] and Christ the word we are feeding on
[3:22:45] the body word word of Jesus
[3:22:49] Christ we're thankful for the
[3:22:54] voice Hall just bow your head for a
[3:22:57] moment
[3:22:58] father it's you that we really want to
[3:23:03] see you are the same today as when you
[3:23:06] walk the shores of Galilee your form has
[3:23:10] changed but you are still God Almighty
[3:23:14] the Emmanuel
[3:23:16] you have now had the desire of your
[3:23:19] heart fulfilled you are no longer just
[3:23:22] God With Us and God above us as we read
[3:23:26] in the Old Testament but you have now
[3:23:29] become God in us the very
[3:23:33] life of Jesus Christ is living in your
[3:23:36] little bride in this hour and we better
[3:23:40] be careful where we take that life and
[3:23:42] how we live with that life in Us and how
[3:23:46] we name the name of the Lord and
[3:23:48] continue in the things of sin and
[3:23:50] unbelief oh God let a desperation strike
[3:23:54] Us in this meeting this week that we
[3:23:57] would renew our covenant with you and we
[3:24:01] would find a new passion for your word
[3:24:04] and find a new passion to spend time
[3:24:07] with you
[3:24:10] Lord and may we spend more time lifting
[3:24:14] up your name and telling what you have
[3:24:18] done for
[3:24:20] us may we spend our time pointing people
[3:24:25] ahead instead of pointing them
[3:24:29] behind oh God may we take full advantage
[3:24:34] of where your word has placed Us in the
[3:24:36] tent with Christ the
[3:24:39] word and may we hunger more and thirst
[3:24:44] more for you said that hung reth and
[3:24:47] thirsteth after
[3:24:48] righteousness the same shall be filled
[3:24:52] would you Worship the Lord with us this
[3:24:54] morning for a few moments would you lift
[3:24:56] him up if you have to leave I certainly
[3:24:59] can understand that at 2:20 in the
[3:25:02] afternoon but if you could stay just a
[3:25:04] few more more moments and Worship the
[3:25:07] Lord with us today lift up Jesus before

[3:36:42] wife let it be the heartbeat of our life
[3:36:44] let it be the passion let it be what
[3:36:46] gets us up in the morning and what we go
