[0:04] [Music]
[0:07] now truth is chasing after you do you
[0:10] believe that because remember truth is a
[0:12] person it's not a Doctrine it's a person
[0:15] Lord Jesus Christ or you might say
[0:17] Yeshua our Messiah one in the same he's
[0:21] chasing
[0:24] us and why is he pursuing us because
[0:27] before the foundation of the world he
[0:30] knew us the Bible said so in fact the
[0:34] New Testament tells us I you have not
[0:36] chosen
[0:40] me and what that means is before the
[0:43] foundation of the world God knew
[0:46] you before your mother or father ever
[0:49] gave you your name your God already knew
[0:53] you before you were ever born from your
[0:56] mother's womb your God already knew you
[1:00] in fact the scripture tells us that
[1:03] every one of our days was already
[1:07] recorded in his book before we were ever
[1:13] born you know why that's good news to me
[1:17] it means that nothing in my life is ever
[1:20] going to take God by
[1:24] surprise good bad ugly he saw it
[1:30] before it ever came my way and not only
[1:34] church did he see it but he provided
[1:39] Grace he provided a way of
[1:43] Escape he saw my Temptation before I was
[1:47] ever born but with every Temptation he
[1:51] made a way of Escape for me to get out
[1:55] of that mess he saw it and he not only
[1:59] knew what I was going to face but let me
[2:02] remind you he knew my
[2:06] choice he knew that I would one day
[2:08] choose him in my case is an 18-month old
[2:12] baby when I chose the Lord but see that
[2:16] was my will that was my desire that was
[2:19] something stirring on the inside of me
[2:21] and I didn't know way back then that he
[2:24] had already chosen
[2:26] me and then as that little child of
[2:29] about oh four five years old when I
[2:31] prayed that prayer at the Baptist Sunday
[2:33] school sung my prayer come into my heart
[2:37] come into my heart he did imagine that
[2:40] he did changed my life at 5 years old
[2:44] filled me with the Holy Ghost at s years
[2:46] old he knew he knew my life he knew the
[2:51] difficulty of my life he knew the
[2:52] hardships of my life and he provided
[2:56] Grace you might say he deposited Grace
[2:59] in my Grace account for the day that I
[3:01] would need to make some withdrawals has
[3:04] anybody in here ever needed to withdraw
[3:06] some Grace from your grace
[3:09] account Hallelujah unlike your bank
[3:13] account Your Grace account will never be
[3:16] an
[3:17] overdraft but that Grace is already
[3:19] there but I have to participate with
[3:21] that Grace and I have to participate
[3:24] with the father's plan for my life I
[3:27] want to tell you something God's going
[3:28] to win
[3:36] yes
