[6:22] Jesus is here you might be sitting for a
[6:28] few minutes we're not gonna take too
[6:32] long just to give a briefing of where we
[6:38] are and where we are today oblation this
[6:41] morning what Amore's would you adjust
[6:43] this light for me it's a way you can
[6:46] make it brighter it's already max okay
[6:49] no problem
[6:51] everything okay brother Marcus is he
[6:53] working now the camera was waiting on
[6:58] the pastor praise the Lord
[7:02] yeah just like everybody knows we have a
[7:06] pastor now and he's the one standing in
[7:10] front of you talking his name is brother
[7:13] Steven you want to praise the Lord and
[7:22] as we mentioned the pastor is only one
[7:25] man there is no way I can carry this job
[7:29] myself
[7:30] we have brothers and sister here and we
[7:33] have many brothers and sister also that
[7:36] are online so if everything comes back
[7:40] to normal and everybody is here you're
[7:42] gonna see that it's a big church so a
[7:45] big church big Souls good people and we
[7:49] need to make sure we do everything
[7:51] according to the with Hema I have my
[7:54] cpa I have my lawyer I have my mentors I
[7:58] have mentors in the industry and this
[8:00] and this and this I am surrounded with a
[8:03] team that helped me do what I do but
[8:06] this is not my job this is not my
[8:08] business this is the Lord job and this
[8:12] is the Lord's business so I cannot bring
[8:15] my team to work with me here I need to
[8:18] go with the team that the Holy Spirit
[8:20] have provided for his own church brother
[8:24] Branham says this he says that we
[8:27] believe in church government everybody
[8:31] clear
[8:32] so it's not the political policies and
[8:35] government it's a church government he's
[8:38] and the government is ordered of the
[8:41] Holy Spirit in the Bible so our
[8:45] government have a foundation in the
[8:48] scripture he doesn't have a foundation
[8:50] in the Constitution of the United States
[8:52] or any other countries Constitution it
[8:56] is funded in the scripture meaning we
[8:59] have a deacon we have trustees we have
[9:02] song leaders we have treasure we have
[9:06] Sunday School Superintendent all these
[9:09] are the government that have been put in
[9:12] place for God to equip his church in
[9:15] order to move forward in right direction
[9:17] and what a Branham say the government is
[9:20] ordered of the Holy Spirit in the Bible
[9:23] they say the pastor is always the head
[9:27] of the church the pastor is always that
[9:30] God's elder in organization not here
[9:35] Assad in organization you have to come
[9:38] through the bishop we don't have a
[9:40] bishop here we only have a pastor we
[9:44] will have a higher headquarter the
[9:47] higher headquarter is the Holy Spirit
[9:49] Weimar consult with the brother if we
[9:52] have question but every church is
[9:54] sovereign so there is no higher order in
[9:59] the Bible than the elder of the church
[10:01] just tell me where where it is it there
[10:05] is no higher order in the Bible
[10:07] for the church the elder will cheese the
[10:10] pasta the highest order of the bubble so
[10:14] what I'm trying to draw here is there is
[10:16] a government for the church and that
[10:19] government has been established by the
[10:20] Holy Spirit and we have to follow what
[10:23] the Prophet have stated so a second coat
[10:26] here just to get to what I'm about to
[10:28] say brother Branham say look the way we
[10:32] used to do it
[10:33] years ago he says sister Gerty was the
[10:37] pianist when I pastored here so brother
[10:40] Branham was a pastor as well but random
[10:43] saying when I pastored here I had to be
[10:46] pastor deacon trustee everything else at
[10:52] once see but I had to do it but a
[10:56] Branham start a church from scratch but
[11:00] a Branham had to preach people bring the
[11:02] people from the street all the way to
[11:04] the church this is not the way this
[11:07] church started this church we didn't
[11:10] preach anybody here to receive the Lord
[11:12] Jesus Christ and to come here and then
[11:15] to believe the message of the hour this
[11:18] church started with believer who took a
[11:21] standard took a position for the message
[11:24] of the hour so it's just a fragment that
[11:27] have been detached from living word
[11:30] Tabernacle and that took everything
[11:32] together
[11:33] so brother Steven are you going to be
[11:35] the trustee are you going to be the
[11:36] deacon are you going to be doing
[11:38] everything
[11:39] no because I have not started a church
[11:43] from scratch everybody clear so far
[11:45] H but what a Branham say now we don't
[11:49] have to do it that way why he said
[11:52] because you got men to carry this out in
[11:58] other world have to be a pastor a deacon
[12:01] and do everything at once and we have
[12:04] brothers we have sisters here we have
[12:06] men that are already mature in the world
[12:08] we have men die have the Holy Spirit we
[12:11] have men that are already establishing
[12:13] the Word of God that can carry this job
[12:15] there for a
[12:17] to be a pastor deacon pastor trustee
[12:21] pastor decent ease and gesture but we
[12:24] needed men to carry this job now brother
[12:28] Branham when he continued he said but
[12:30] when day I had ashes he didn't say
[12:35] Deacon
[12:36] because Deacon need to be voted him and
[12:38] voted in by the church what about him
[12:41] say that I had asher's brought a c-word
[12:44] and all of them at the door they had
[12:47] books parlor on there at the door
[12:49] setting in the chair or something
[12:51] another and when someone come in you
[12:54] show them a place to hang your coat and
[12:56] help them to their seat give them a
[12:59] songbook and ask them to be in prayer in
[13:03] other word the Asscher is a temporary
[13:05] deacon the Asscher and the job of a
[13:09] deacon is pretty much the same but a
[13:13] deacon is somebody who is voted by the
[13:16] church but an usher is a person that has
[13:20] been a poor Church sanctioned that
[13:22] person then that person will be a deacon
[13:26] everybody clear so far
[13:27] and what random say that and then
[13:30] everybody set in their seat and silently
[13:33] prayed until studying tom so we have a
[13:37] pastor but we need brothers to carry
[13:40] this job so those brothers are going to
[13:43] be Usher's first and then we need to
[13:46] give the church time to move on stay in
[13:49] prayer until we see an usher can be put
[13:52] up today and tomorrow he can be changed
[13:54] there is no problem but a deacon once he
[13:57] is elected if you want to remove a
[14:00] deacon we must give an explanation to
[14:02] the church why the deacon have been
[14:05] removed everybody clear
[14:08] we can now remove a deacon just like
[14:10] that if you remove a deacon you need to
[14:13] come back to the church and give the
[14:15] church explanation why
[14:18] the Deacon was removed and that
[14:21] explanation must be clear in the
[14:23] scripture it's not going to be because
[14:26] the pastor doesn't like the difference
[14:28] because the deacon was not appointed by
[14:31] the pastor the deacon was appointed by
[14:34] the congregation so you must convince
[14:37] the congregation that I'm removing this
[14:40] deacon because of this dis dis dis dis
[14:42] and then we go if the explanation is not
[14:45] valid the Deacon is tear into position
[14:49] everybody clear so far so before we get
[14:52] to deacon
[14:53] there is a step where we're gonna take
[14:55] is Usher
[14:57] so I asked two brothers I know we might
[15:00] have four deacons we might have three
[15:01] deacons we might have two deacons but at
[15:04] this point we need to go with two and
[15:06] those brothers were brother Robert Fabi
[15:09] who is here and I also asked brother
[15:12] Abel who's right here working on a
[15:15] computer so before we go into deep deep
[15:18] into this song leader is not voted and
[15:23] song leader is appointed so basically
[15:27] for his church as a pastor as a felid
[15:30] brother John Porter is our song leader
[15:34] so brother John Porter will be the one
[15:36] leading the song here but brother John
[15:39] Porter had backup just in case he's sick
[15:43] he's not feeling good we have brother
[15:45] Abel who's an usher who has been leading
[15:48] our song on Wednesday those who have
[15:50] been on a youtube you seen him and we
[15:53] also have brother Robert Fabi who also
[15:55] layered our song in Living Word
[15:57] Tabernacle those two Usher's can back
[16:00] brother John Porter as song leader
[16:02] everybody clear
[16:04] so far no so now we transfer pretty much
[16:08] everything and we thank God for the
[16:11] cooperation of brother Maurice helping
[16:14] us through the entire process of
[16:15] transferring and getting everything but
[16:18] to us now brother Stephen D a sure we
[16:21] understand it you're going to have
[16:23] Asher's it's going to be brother Robert
[16:25] and brother Abel what about the money
[16:27] part are you going to be the trustee
[16:30] handling the money
[16:31] or what because we know that they test
[16:34] belong to the pastor so before I get
[16:37] into that I'm going to give you the
[16:40] account of what we receive from the
[16:44] committee what I found into the offering
[16:47] account and what I found into the task
[16:50] on this is your one time report the only
[16:54] report of my goes into the church is the
[16:57] Sunday School offering but as far as the
[16:59] account whoever is going to be trustee
[17:02] whoever is going to be a treasure there
[17:05] will be the one handling the account I
[17:07] believe in that because brother Branham
[17:09] say trustee are the one who is possible
[17:12] for the finances I have caught after
[17:14] coat but later on we might clarify on
[17:17] these things little by little five
[17:19] thousand six hundred sixty five dollars
[17:22] and 22 cents that's what we are starting
[17:26] with clear so far in the task they count
[17:30] what we receive after the transfer was
[17:34] fifty two thousand five hundred forty
[17:38] seven dollars and twenty five cents
[17:40] that's where I am and that's what we're
[17:44] going to be starting with now brother
[17:47] Steven are you going to be using your
[17:48] tot money at this point no because we
[17:53] need a building we need a church it is
[17:56] the truth brother Branham say tat belong
[17:58] to the pastor but God has blessed me
[18:00] with a job that I can take care of
[18:02] myself without touching this money so I
[18:05] would dedicate that money completely
[18:08] entirely to find either a spot or a
[18:11] church and handle that so whatever will
[18:14] be coming into the tithing or this time
[18:18] until we get into the building will be
[18:21] completely dedicated for the building so
[18:24] if you pay your tab today or tomorrow or
[18:26] after tomorrow all of that we will keep
[18:29] it to find a place where we will be
[18:31] fellowshiping because we spending a lot
[18:34] of money here and we need a place where
[18:36] we like we can call our home so that I
[18:40] have been said are you going to take all
[18:42] the time brother Branham is my
[18:44] example you say brother branham your
[18:47] example Paul say follow me as I follow
[18:52] Christ so brother branham follow Christ
[18:58] and I am following brother branham
[19:01] everybody clear
[19:02] so brother branham even though he spoke
[19:05] and he said that the path belonged to
[19:08] the pastor brother branham took a salary
[19:11] and if we reach a point where I need to
[19:14] take a salary I would do it but at this
[19:17] point no all the money goes for the
[19:20] building brother Steven you a pastor you
[19:25] working do you pay tithe brother branham
[19:28] is my example I have a code brother
[19:30] branham was a pastor and vada Branham
[19:33] was working and brother Branham was
[19:35] paying tasks so as a pastor working I
[19:38] will be paying Tata I have to abide with
[19:42] Tata
[19:43] except I stop my work that's when I
[19:45] don't have to pay it out but as long as
[19:47] I'm working my business need to pay
[19:50] tithe and I need to pay Todd and those
[19:53] money will go for the building everybody
[19:57] clear so far now as far as handling the
[20:02] money of the church I'm going to say
[20:04] this brother branham say in the message
[20:07] by faith Moses he says as he brother
[20:11] Egon and many and some of the trustees
[20:15] setting here we just talked about the
[20:18] usher now we want to talk about the
[20:20] money he say I see some of the trustees
[20:23] setting here after we had our trustee
[20:27] meeting the other night it is true I
[20:31] publicly before the church that each of
[20:35] each one of you all are no longer
[20:39] appointed trustees so trustees are also
[20:45] appointed everybody clear they are no
[20:49] longer appointed trustees you are
[20:52] elected trustees and your name
[20:56] on the book all right so at this point
[21:00] we are not electing trustees but we are
[21:04] appointing trustees who sanction those
[21:08] trustees it's going to be you the
[21:11] congregation voting whether you like
[21:13] those men or not but those men have high
[21:16] integrity they are honest men I believe
[21:19] that they are Christian I believe that
[21:21] brother John Potter is a Christian I
[21:23] believe that brother Abel brought a
[21:25] Robert and whoever is going to be
[21:27] handling the money our question at this
[21:29] point they are appointed but as we move
[21:32] on down the road we need to continue to
[21:34] pray until we find out that we are more
[21:37] comfortable the church is stabilized
[21:39] then at that point we will elect and
[21:42] once the elect they're not going to be
[21:44] appointed trustees but they're going to
[21:46] be elected trustees any question so far
[21:50] clear so those brother that I spoke to
[21:54] one of this day so when we transfer our
[21:57] account I took those brother and I'd put
[22:00] them into the account because I don't
[22:03] wanna handle money I wanna be focusing
[22:05] on the preaching of the word the reason
[22:09] why the office of the Deacon was open in
[22:12] the scripture if you go read it in the
[22:14] book of fact the Bible says that they
[22:16] opened the office of the deacon so that
[22:19] they apostle will spend their time in
[22:22] prayer and into the preaching of the
[22:25] word so I want to be spending my time in
[22:28] prayer in preaching of the word and in
[22:31] taking care of God sheep but as far as
[22:34] handling the money those brother have
[22:36] their own online username they know
[22:40] these in the account I'm gonna be there
[22:42] overseeing as a pastor but I'm now going
[22:45] to be there make the transaction when
[22:47] you put your money here the end of that
[22:50] they have the checkbook
[22:51] they have everything I'm completely out
[22:53] of it everybody clear
[22:55] so those brother are only appointed at
[22:58] this time but they need to be elected by
[23:01] the church and we need to give the
[23:03] church the time to pray until which if
[23:06] we need to add one more trustee we're
[23:08] going to Adam if we need to add it
[23:10] we're gonna add them if we need to add a
[23:12] sunday-school superintendent we're gonna
[23:14] have it but at this point is just uh
[23:16] sure to take care of us when you come
[23:19] here or to take care of the problem and
[23:21] we're gonna have trustees to take care
[23:23] of the transaction
[23:24] when I say trustee is appointed we nee
[23:28] we are looking for a building so when
[23:30] you hear something about a building it's
[23:32] not only those two brothers give them a
[23:34] call give me a call if you hear that
[23:36] there is a place there or a land where
[23:38] they are selling there we are all in
[23:40] this together so whatever you hear bring
[23:43] it to us we will work together and we
[23:45] will try to figure it out
[23:47] so those brother are going to be the one
[23:49] responsible at this plant brother
[23:51] Stephen is now using any task your Todd
[23:54] is going to go to the building we are a
[23:57] new church we don't have a credit we
[24:01] need to build more found in order to
[24:03] find our own building so we dedicated
[24:06] all those fund except the offering where
[24:08] we need to pay these bills and
[24:09] everything that is going on by the tight
[24:11] money is going to be solely dedicated to
[24:14] fund a building every church is
[24:17] sovereign that's my way that I felt led
[24:20] at this point if you want to add your
[24:23] money for a building fund that is up to
[24:26] you you can do it but at this point
[24:28] that's the direction we will be going
[24:31] everybody clear so far so for the
[24:34] brothers that I have just called their
[24:37] name here I was trying to call them here
[24:40] but I believe everybody knows brother
[24:41] Abel I believe everybody knows brother
[24:44] John Porter everybody knows brother Jim
[24:46] Kelly but I Robert if you don't mind for
[24:50] one minute let's just stand here so the
[24:52] church sees you we're not going to lay a
[24:55] hand on you we're not going to pray for
[24:56] you yet because we need to go through
[24:59] the process but at least everybody knows
[25:01] who is responsible who do they need to
[25:03] contact what to do and what to go from
[25:05] there brother David is not here he went
[25:08] into a funeral but he's the man one
[25:10] responsible for the computer the sound
[25:14] system and he got help already brother
[25:17] Marcus and the other brothers those are
[25:19] the brother that are fair led to move
[25:22] phone with them and we have brother John
[25:24] Porter
[25:25] we have brother Jim kebaya there we have
[25:27] brother Micah deli we have brother Abel
[25:30] and we have brother Roberts over there
[25:32] so these are the men that are going to
[25:34] be working as a team and there will be
[25:36] the one taking some of the part of the
[25:38] Lord and I'm gonna be focusing more into
[25:41] the word you see them and God bless you
[25:45] thank you God
[25:46] if you have any question you can call me
[25:50] we can talk because sometimes we don't
[25:53] have time to ask question like this but
[25:55] I'm open to question for those brothers
[25:58] that I have just brought here on a
[26:01] pulpit this is what I'm gonna say in
[26:04] front of the church
[26:05] Radha Branham say may every officer of
[26:09] the church fill his post of duty knowing
[26:16] this that God is going to hold you as
[26:20] possible
[26:21] for how you held your office in the
[26:25] church each one will have to give an
[26:29] account so this is my code to the
[26:32] brothers everybody will have to give an
[26:35] account for what they're doing
[26:36] it's not gonna be blame on me everybody
[26:40] will have to give an account on what
[26:42] they are doing so at this point continue
[26:45] to pray for us as we continue to find
[26:47] places and to work on this together and
[26:49] I don't want anybody to feel like they
[26:52] are laid out they are lay back or they
[26:55] feel like they are they're here just
[26:58] doing nothing
[26:59] this is family if you feel like you need
[27:04] to help rudder able or brother David to
[27:08] work or put up the equipment or

[27:26] like you can play an instrument I will
[27:29] strongly encourage you find a place
[27:33] where you can learn it tell us
[27:35] she's gonna cost and the church is gonna
[27:38] take care of it but under one condition
[27:40] if you choose to do it you must be
[27:44] serious with it if you not gonna be
[27:46] serious with it don't do it so if you

[28:17] in the offering now they task the task
[28:18] is for the building and then we can see
[28:20] if we can afford it
[28:21] we put it together if we can we can use
[28:24] our own money
[28:25] put it there so that the church can be
[28:27] built any questions so far so that's
[28:30] what I hate God which we bless you you
[28:33] might be spending as we read the Word of
[28:34] God god bless you if you can get your
[28:44] Bible first King chapter 17 I hope some
[28:51] of you have been listening to the sermon
[28:53] of on Wednesday if you missed it because
[28:56] a lot of people were not here on
[28:58] Wednesday so if you didn't listen to the
[29:01] sermon you need to really really pay
[29:05] attention and I encourage you if you are
[29:09] not here on Wednesday make sure you
[29:11] listen to the sermon and the Holy
[29:14] Spirit's just brought this back to me
[29:16] right now brother Stephen you have been
[29:19] preaching alone do you believe in far
[29:23] for ministry absolutely a hundred
[29:26] percent for some time you must see me
[29:29] pastoring a lot of it but after a while
[29:32] once I feel the signal from the Holy
[29:34] Spirit we're going to open the door and
[29:36] begin to bring brother back and forth
[29:38] because we believe in far for industry
[29:41] so do you believe you wanna be having
[29:43] preachers here yes got some contact I
[29:45] will get
[29:46] more contact and we're going to open the
[29:48] door case somebody had a question so
[29:50] you're not going to have your pastor
[29:51] every day you will have a flavor of
[29:54] other ministry for the edifying the
[29:56] building up of the church everybody
[29:59] clear
[30:00] now first in chapter 17 verse 10 if you
[30:08] dare you can say Amen we are dealing
[30:11] with the two pools the last Sunday we
[30:13] dealt with the widow part and the Holy
[30:16] Spirit already gave me signal to deal
[30:18] with one particular subject
[30:21] I am so nobody's overwhelming or crowded
[30:26] so we started with the pools though
[30:28] first and a second pool and we're going
[30:30] to continue with them until God help us
[30:33] to clear that so you will see because
[30:35] brother Brahim in history it brought the
[30:38] terminology of pools so you might be
[30:41] wondering what is the pool what is the
[30:43] pool what is that in the Bible that's a
[30:45] reason why we want you to understand the
[30:47] ministry the reason why we're preaching
[30:49] this we don't want any more doubt about
[30:51] the message we want you to be grounded
[30:54] in the message and once we begin to soul
[30:56] we don't have to be questioning the
[30:58] message or going back and forth you know
[31:01] where this is coming from so verse 10 so
[31:05] he arose Elijah and went to zurafa and
[31:08] when he came to the city to the gate of
[31:12] the city everybody understand my voice
[31:14] clearly to the gate of the city behold
[31:17] the widow woman we already explained
[31:19] this was their gathering of sticks you
[31:23] might be seated and he called to her and
[31:26] say bring me I pray you a little water
[31:30] in a vessel if you notice here when
[31:34] Elijah approaches the widow woman Elijah
[31:37] asked the older woman to bring him order
[31:41] in a vessel so this water must be in a
[31:47] vessel when Eliezer met Rebecca Rebecca
[31:53] had a vessel he was a preacher and
[31:57] eliazar asked for water
[32:00] but the order must be in a vessel when
[32:03] Jesus met the woman at the well the
[32:07] woman had well had a vessel so when
[32:10] Jesus asked for water water must be in
[32:13] the vessel either the vessel might be
[32:18] apart the vessel might be a pitcher the
[32:21] vessel might be something but water must
[32:23] be in a vessel brother Branham said the
[32:26] reason why Jesus asked that give me a
[32:30] drink he said he was engaging into a
[32:33] conversation he was opening a door to
[32:37] the conversation so asking the water
[32:39] from the pitcher was a way to engage
[32:43] into a conversation
[32:45] everybody clear so far now that I'm a
[32:49] drink verse 11 and as she was going to
[32:52] bring it he called to her and say bring
[32:55] me I pray you a morsel of bread in your
[32:58] hand and she said as the Lord your God
[33:02] lives lives I have not a cake so this
[33:08] woman explained to Elijah
[33:12] that what she has is a cake and we saw
[33:16] the other time that that cake was milk
[33:19] makes you fall and they make a cake so
[33:23] there are two things that Elijah is
[33:25] interacting with this woman number one
[33:28] is the water in a vessel and the first
[33:30] thing Elijah asked for bread and the
[33:33] woman had a cake and very clear a cake
[33:38] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[33:41] leader all in a cruise and behold I am
[33:44] gathering two sticks and we know the two
[33:46] sticks were to make fire so we found
[33:50] that there is a water vessel here there
[33:52] is a cake and they will also fire that
[33:56] is made out of wood everybody clear
[33:59] those three element the to stick that I
[34:03] may go and dress it for me and my son
[34:05] and we may eat it and die verse 13
[34:10] Elijah enter into the terminology of the
[34:12] woman he say and Elijah said to her fear
[34:16] not go and do as you have said I'd make
[34:19] me there of a leader cake everybody
[34:22] clear first and bring it to me and after
[34:27] make for you and photo son we have a
[34:31] water in the vessel we have a cake and
[34:34] we have fire in the wood
[34:36] that's how Elijah interrupted with this
[34:40] little woman let's go to chapter 19 of
[34:43] first king if you dare you can say Amen
[34:51] chapter 19 verse 5 everybody there the
[34:56] Bible says that and as he lay and slept
[34:59] this is Elijah under a juniper tree
[35:04] behold then an angel touched him who is
[35:09] that angel right here we don't know yet
[35:11] an angel touched him and said to him
[35:14] arise and eat verse 6 and he looked and
[35:18] behold the walls al everybody clear
[35:22] everybody here can you look at your
[35:25] board the angel spoke about Earth okay
[35:31] behold there is a cake baked under did
[35:35] you see fire here everybody clear
[35:39] okay there is a cave was a cake baked on
[35:45] the coast who created the cake the angel
[35:52] who created the cause the angel
[35:58] everybody thank you and a cruse of what
[36:04] water water email so when the angel is
[36:10] interacting with Elijah he also brought
[36:14] those three elements together
[36:17] everybody clear water at his head and he
[36:23] did eat and drink and lead
[36:26] done four seven angel of the Lord so the
[36:33] one who was doing this was the angel of
[36:35] the Lord and we know that the angel of
[36:37] the Lord is of the Covenant so we found
[36:40] out that these three elements are the
[36:43] element of the angel of the Lord so
[36:49] whatever was going on between Elijah and
[36:52] this woman the angel of the Lord equip
[36:55] Elijah with those things because the
[36:59] Ministry of Elijah when he's approaching
[37:02] he must approach with the water a vessel
[37:06] not just water in a vessel Elijah when
[37:09] he's approaching there must be a cake
[37:11] what is a cake Elijah when is
[37:16] approaching there must be fire on the
[37:18] wood and those three element of the
[37:22] angel who was found not on the Jews
[37:25] women on ingenta Widow a very clear and
[37:30] the angel of the Lord came again the
[37:33] second time so we found out that Elijah
[37:36] have a first touch our there and then I
[37:41] can touch from the angel of the Lord and
[37:45] the third touch was in Mount Horeb
[37:50] either no problem and the angel of the
[37:56] Lord came again the second time and
[37:58] touch him and say arise and eat because
[38:01] the journey is too great for you and he
[38:04] rose and did eat and drink and went in
[38:07] the strength of the meat forty days and
[38:09] forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God
[38:12] over there he received an experience
[38:15] which was his third touch through
[38:18] touches from the angel of the Lord and
[38:21] the third one is an experience in Mount
[38:23] Horeb which we saw all sunset mantle so
[38:27] let's go to Colossians chapter 3 and
[38:29] we're going to be praying if you dare
[38:34] you can say Amanda
[38:40] Colossians chapter 3 verse 14 pages are
[38:44] still turning coalition is after
[38:50] Philippian and Tessa Union everybody
[38:56] there verse 14 and above all things put
[39:01] on charity we know charity means love
[39:05] which is the capstone are their charity
[39:11] love which is the bond of perfectness so
[39:16] if you want perfection if you want to
[39:20] bond things correctly if you want to
[39:22] bond things in a proper way if you want
[39:26] to bind things correctly in the church
[39:28] you need the capstone you need love are
[39:33] there with the capstone you can put
[39:36] everything that was in disorder in order
[39:39] everything that was loose and throughout
[39:43] the edges can be put back together in
[39:48] perfection with the capstone ministry
[39:53] everybody clear
[39:54] let's pray then Heavenly Father Lord we
[39:58] thank you again for your grace you love
[40:00] your mercy for giving us another
[40:02] opportunity to be gathered together
[40:04] around your world Lord we are committing
[40:07] this service again unto the handle may
[40:09] the Holy Spirit may the asad teacher may
[40:13] you come Lord and teach your word and
[40:15] stabilize this church and pastor it Lord
[40:18] for the glory of your name father we we
[40:20] buek every demonic spirit away from us
[40:23] may all our mind be completely sent
[40:26] focused around the word of command
[40:28] god bless you brother Marcus and brother
[40:30] Abel for working together to help our
[40:32] brother David is out god bless you now
[40:35] we are dealing with this part here the
[40:38] unchanging pattern of God
[40:39] part 14 now we and we began in this
[40:45] particular session we found that Elijah
[40:47] was first fed
[40:49] close by bread and we found old bread
[40:52] means divine healing and by divine
[40:55] healing in Malachi for the Ministry of
[40:58] Elijah was prophesized that there will
[41:00] be a Sun of righteousness that is coming
[41:02] up and that Sun of righteousness will
[41:04] bring healing into his wings so on
[41:08] Wednesday as a quicker recall when we
[41:12] talked about healing how will that will
[41:15] how will the healing or the gift of
[41:19] healing under the Ministry of Elijah be
[41:22] expressed into the gentle and we found
[41:24] out on Wednesday quickly that we there
[41:28] was a man by the name of Moses and Moses
[41:31] was given three sons Moses had a son of
[41:34] miracle where he threw the road and the
[41:38] road was turned into a snake and he
[41:40] pulled the road back and it was back
[41:42] again into a road and we also found out
[41:46] that Moses had the second son in hand
[41:49] where he put the Sun in honor on his
[41:53] heart and when he pulled the son out we
[41:57] found that sin came out leprosy came out
[42:00] and what Branham say leprosy was a tap
[42:03] of sin in other words the second son of
[42:06] Moses was the son that revealed the sin
[42:10] of the heart when the hand went on it
[42:13] was a clean hand when he entered into
[42:16] the people sin he reveal sin he exposed
[42:20] sin and when sin is atoned or dealt with
[42:24] when they put the hand back again the
[42:27] hand came back normal
[42:28] showing that the heart was already clean
[42:31] and the third sign holds that God told
[42:34] him that if they don't follow the first
[42:36] son the voice of the first son the voice
[42:38] of the second son then you want to go be
[42:41] like the third son which is you're gonna
[42:43] take the water from the now and you want
[42:46] to pour that on the ground and that
[42:48] water will be turned into blood and we
[42:51] found out that there is two ways you can
[42:53] pour water you can use a vessel to carry
[42:56] water and you pour that on the ground
[42:58] or you can use the power of the spoken
[43:01] word where you can just speak to this
[43:03] mountain and the mountain will be
[43:05] displaced without an effort so we found
[43:08] out that those three son Moses or the
[43:12] Bible refer to them as sons but we
[43:16] express to you that when God works in or
[43:20] when God is moving on in his kingdom the
[43:24] characteristic of God remained the same
[43:26] their form might change the name might
[43:31] change but the characteristic still the
[43:34] same if you look at John the Baptist
[43:36] you're going to call him John the
[43:37] Baptist but even when Jesus came when
[43:40] Jesus Christ came he look at John the
[43:42] Baptist he called him Elijah so what you
[43:45] call John the Baptist according to the
[43:47] scripture is Elijah if you go back in
[43:50] the Bible you will never find the word
[43:52] John the Baptist in the Old Testament if
[43:55] you go back in the Bible you won't find
[43:57] the word Jesus Christ in the Old
[43:59] Testament yet Jesus was in the Old
[44:02] Testament but his name was just hidden
[44:04] but when he came in he had to work with
[44:08] sons and by the son he was a way to
[44:12] attract the people to make them believe
[44:15] who the messenger is in order to point
[44:18] them into a certain direction so what
[44:22] was called son in the Ministry of Moses
[44:25] we found out that in our ministry he got
[44:28] a different terminology brother Branham
[44:31] said that if they didn't believe the son
[44:34] then the third son really gathered all
[44:37] ministries has three sons well is
[44:41] whatever I'm getting that in the Bible
[44:44] Moses had three sons are you there the
[44:48] brother Branham gives you the scripture
[44:49] no was he lying no idea all right
[44:55] if it is sent from God Jesus had three
[45:00] sons Moses had prisons no ahead prisons
[45:06] Elijah had three son everything comes in
[45:10] three sons so
[45:12] if we expect brother branham to be the
[45:14] elijah of this end time we must have
[45:17] also three sons everybody clear
[45:20] but those son are not called sons they
[45:24] are called in a ministry something
[45:26] different
[45:27] brother branham say word that the son do
[45:31] what is the purpose of asana why
[45:34] everybody here he said the Sun is to
[45:38] attract the attention the Sun is to pull
[45:43] somebody else so we can call it an
[45:47] attraction we can call it a Sun we can
[45:52] call it a pool because the concern of
[45:55] Moses was I am growing there by the
[45:57] people will not believe me
[45:59] so God helped to equip Moses with
[46:02] croissant and by the treason is gonna
[46:05] attract the elect is going to remove the
[46:08] elect from the destruction of the world
[46:11] from the destruction of the denomination
[46:14] from the destruction of the pentecostal
[46:17] to attract the left like what is really
[46:20] going on over there
[46:22] are we there it is to attract the
[46:25] attention and get the elect ready so the
[46:30] Sun is to attract you and to prepare you
[46:34] that you're approaching the woman have
[46:37] to go through these three things to
[46:39] prepare the woman because something was
[46:42] coming and very clear praise the Lord
[46:46] and get there electri D and out of the
[46:50] way before judgment struck that's what
[46:53] Noah did got the elect ready the rest of
[46:57] them and what does he do the Sun and the
[47:01] voice of the Sun condemns the unbeliever
[47:03] and get him ready for judgment he gets
[47:07] the elective ready for the escape
[47:09] because we have three Exodus the first
[47:13] Exodus was Moses the second Exodus was
[47:16] Jesus Christ
[47:17] but the third Exodus is the rapture one
[47:21] was taking Israel from one nation
[47:25] the other one who formed denominational
[47:28] out but this Exodus is what son is
[47:32] that's what son are given for for the
[47:35] coming judgement to the elect deceit let
[47:39] the leader woman with a pure heart a
[47:42] default body and the Pharisee with pure
[47:46] body and a devourer heart it takes the
[47:50] second ministry or the second son to dig
[47:55] into the heart of the Pharisee and to
[47:58] bring back the scene that was under
[48:00] there but if you remember the angel that
[48:04] spoke to Eleazar was the same angel that
[48:08] spoke to Rebecca you know the pillar of
[48:12] fire that follow Moses follow Israel the
[48:15] pillow fire the follow brother branham
[48:17] is also with the blood the woman at the
[48:20] well even though she was a prostitute
[48:22] but she had a representation in glory in
[48:26] other word hell and Jesus Christ was of
[48:29] the same species are you deaf praise God
[48:35] he say a pure heart and a defier body he
[48:39] condemned one and save the other and the
[48:43] very judgment has saved Moses condemned
[48:45] the world he is preaching he gets the
[48:48] elect ready
[48:50] what is the elect level when they see a
[48:54] god-sent son they look back endure
[48:58] that's why the Bible said brother
[49:01] Branham say the Bible say brother
[49:04] Branham say whatever happened in the
[49:06] ministry of brother Branham if you want
[49:08] to challenges to me and I'm going to say
[49:10] it
[49:11] I didn't brother Branham so many people
[49:14] had the picture of Jesus Christ he said
[49:18] Othman had a picture he said Saul's men
[49:21] have the picture brother Branham said
[49:24] they did it by the inspiration that they
[49:27] had but who could say this one is right
[49:31] and this one is wrong
[49:34] are you there when brother branham had a
[49:37] vision of Jesus Christ when brother
[49:41] Branham Luke Edge's trust brother
[49:44] Branham said that between everybody that
[49:48] had the picture of Jesus Christ the one
[49:51] that matches what also is the future of
[49:55] Earth man are you there when brother
[49:59] Branham said that nobody saw it you
[50:03] didn't see didn't see it
[50:05] he was brother Branham himself who saw
[50:08] it but the problem is in 1963 when the
[50:13] cloud came the cloud unveiled the
[50:17] picture of man over there the cloud
[50:24] confirmed that brother Branham was right
[50:28] the cloud was not drawn by brother
[50:31] Branham the cloud was not joined by
[50:34] element he was right there in the sky
[50:37] and the picture of the cloud much as the
[50:40] picture of Earth man so if you want to
[50:44] destroy the picture of the cloud you
[50:47] cannot all the picture of Earthmen
[50:49] [Applause]
[50:51] it's a confusion it's a spirit of
[50:55] confusion either earth man confirm the
[50:59] cloud if you keep earth man in your
[51:02] church you must keep the cloud because
[51:05] the cloud confirm it's a spirit of
[51:19] confusion you are creeping off man and
[51:23] you are rejecting the cloud and the
[51:26] cloud when decay to the Prophet and off
[51:28] man
[51:32] [Music]
[51:35] hallelujah we say the Olay get the elect
[51:40] ready what is they literally fall when
[51:43] they see God's and Sun they look back in
[51:46] the scripture and see if that is
[51:49] supposed to be dead why everything must
[51:53] be proven by the scripture are you there
[51:57] so what was cause son in the ministry of
[52:01] moses it is called pool in the ministry
[52:05] of brother Branham but the pools in the
[52:09] Bible are sons to do what to attract
[52:13] their elect and just like Moses had
[52:16] proposed brother Branham also had word
[52:18] triple and the first pool brother
[52:21] Branham called that healing we saw it on
[52:24] Wednesday the second pool brother
[52:27] Branham called prophecy and sometime
[52:30] brother Branham called that discernment
[52:33] we gave you those two code so the second
[52:36] pool brother Branham code that prophecy
[52:40] and brother Branham called that
[52:43] discernment
[52:45] we did whatever Adam called that there
[52:48] are you there but we know under the
[52:52] second pool is the Sun where the hand is
[52:55] put and he reveal the scene of the heart
[52:59] because sometimes they were praying for
[53:01] people and they don't get here so God
[53:04] have to dig in their life and to find
[53:06] out what is the sin that he have done in
[53:09] their life and once this scene is clear
[53:11] then the man is a pill are you there but
[53:15] brother Branham called that prophecy
[53:18] does prophecy discern the heart brother
[53:22] Branham called discernment does
[53:25] discernment desert the heart said Tech
[53:32] first Corinthians chapter 14 I'm going
[53:36] to go slowly just be patient with me I
[53:38] can now rush with these things
[53:41] we don't want any question around this
[53:44] ministry so if I take part 14 part 15
[53:49] understand me either I can load you in
[53:52] five hours and you are lost or we can go
[53:55] slowly as a pastor and go clearly
[53:58] everybody there like brother Abel says
[54:02] he want to take it a little bit of the
[54:04] time you didn't know God was talking 1st
[54:12] Corinthians chapter 14 you don't know
[54:15] how many times God is talking to me
[54:17] through people in this church they
[54:18] calling me they ask me question they
[54:20] don't know the question mean something I
[54:23] might be talking to a brother he said
[54:25] something he didn't know another brother
[54:27] told me the exact same thing my wife can
[54:29] tell you that over and over all over
[54:32] it's happening somebody just asked a
[54:36] question do we need to do this and
[54:37] that's and it's exactly in line I was
[54:41] talking to a sister yesterday with my
[54:43] wife and while we were talking I said
[54:46] sister if I show you my computer run out
[54:48] what we talk right now is the sermon for
[54:50] tomorrow everybody there first
[54:55] Corinthians chapter 14 verse 24 but if
[54:59] all prophesy everybody clear
[55:04] did you see that I want you to make sure
[55:06] you seen it if our prophesy it's
[55:11] prophecy and they come in one that
[55:14] believe not or one unlearned he is
[55:17] convinced of all he is judged of all
[55:20] verse 25 and that's our the secret of
[55:24] his so that's why because the second
[55:29] pool was unveiling the secret of the
[55:32] heart brother Branham called up who
[55:34] prophesy everybody clear
[55:37] did brother Branham ever give you a
[55:39] scripture when you see brother Branham
[55:44] saying something just believe it and the
[55:47] saddle it
[55:48] are you there let's go to the book of
[55:56] Ephesians chapter 5 chapter 6 if you
[56:05] dare you can say Amen I don't have too
[56:08] many scriptures Ephesians chapter 6
[56:13] verse 17 everybody there and like the
[56:19] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[56:23] so the spirit have a sword everybody in
[56:26] that and the sword of the Spirit which
[56:29] is there so the Word of God is the
[56:32] source we fill the secret of the heart
[56:35] now we undetermined either the sword of
[56:39] the Spirit is the Word of God let's go
[56:42] to Hebrews chapter 4 somebody has
[56:51] already seen that Hebrew chapter 4 verse
[56:54] 2 verse 12 you should be coding that
[56:58] already everybody there for the word of
[57:03] God which is the sword of the Spirit
[57:05] very clear the Word of God is quick and
[57:09] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[57:13] everybody clear piercing even to the
[57:17] dividing asunder of the soul and spirit
[57:19] and of the joints and marrow and a
[57:24] discerner everybody clear off dead and
[57:28] intent
[57:29] after that's why brother Branham called
[57:32] the second pull prophecy and he called
[57:35] that discernment because discernment and
[57:38] prophecy revealed the secret of let's go
[57:43] to Luke chapter 2 for an appetizer
[58:00] everybody there Luke chapter 2 verse 35
[58:04] then we continue Luke chapter 2 verse 35
[58:09] everybody there talking to Mary shall
[58:12] pierce through your own we know that the
[58:17] heart is the occupation of the soul
[58:19] remember that important living word and
[58:22] the sword shall pierce through your own
[58:25] soul also that did thoughts it was a
[58:30] prophecy upon Mary for the Ministry of
[58:32] Jesus Christ and the thoughts of many
[58:35] hearts may be it may be Revere what is
[58:40] revealing a sword going into the are you
[58:45] there
[58:48] I'm going to get ahead of myself let's
[58:52] go to the book of Judges because I felt
[58:55] led by the Holy Spirit to go Dada
[58:58] I kept it later but let's deal with
[59:00] Scripture and then we move on straight
[59:03] everybody there the book of judge judges
[59:07] verse seven now you understand when
[59:10] brother Branham said prophesy
[59:12] discernment is the second poll from
[59:15] today you understand that put the book
[59:18] of Judges chapter 9 chapter 7 everybody
[59:21] there Gideon was going to face an army
[59:26] of Nabila and Gideon was afraid and I
[59:30] want you to go there and you're going to
[59:32] hear something in the camp of the enemy
[59:34] that's going to be comforting or
[59:37] strengthening you because in the camp of
[59:40] the enemy
[59:40] one person was there they had a gift of
[59:43] vision
[59:46] you said the enemy has a gift of vision
[59:49] yes gift and calling out without
[59:53] repentance are you there
[59:56] Judah had a gift Caiaphas prophesy
[1:00:00] brother branham's
[1:00:01] he was of the devil are you there and
[1:00:04] not only was somebody with the gift of
[1:00:07] prophecy over there also with the gift
[1:00:11] of interpretation of dreams 7 verse 9
[1:00:20] everybody there and he came to pass the
[1:00:23] same not that the Lord said to him it
[1:00:25] was get you down to the hosts for I have
[1:00:28] delivered it into your hand but if you
[1:00:31] feel go down if you feel to go you go
[1:00:36] with pora your servant down to host and
[1:00:39] you shall hear what they say and
[1:00:42] afterward you shall after all shall your
[1:00:45] hands be strengthened to go down to the
[1:00:47] host so god instead of giving this
[1:00:50] vision to the prophet of Israel God gave
[1:00:54] the vision to the enemy from the mouth
[1:00:59] of your enemy they will be confessing
[1:01:03] what God is doing in your life either
[1:01:06] God gave the vision to Pharaoh God gave
[1:01:10] the vision to nabuchadnezzar God gave
[1:01:14] the prophecy to Caiaphas and one of this
[1:01:17] day every knee shall bow every tongue
[1:01:20] should confess
[1:01:21] whether they like Jesus or not that
[1:01:23] Jesus is God are you there so God said
[1:01:29] go there everybody following me now let
[1:01:35] me drop down to 13 and when Gideon was
[1:01:39] come he went to the hosts the all the
[1:01:42] world's he meant that Todd a dream to
[1:01:44] his fellow and brother branham say a
[1:01:47] dream when he happened or one it is
[1:01:49] interpreted it's a vision are you there
[1:01:52] that's why I say vision I'm saying that
[1:01:55] because I'm looking with the seals the
[1:01:58] seals are breaking that up you know you
[1:02:01] need you need the seals for this book he
[1:02:05] said there was a man that taught him to
[1:02:08] his fellow and say behold a dream a
[1:02:11] dream and
[1:02:13] no L a what a cake of barley remember
[1:02:20] Elijah met the woman she had what a cake
[1:02:25] the angel of the Lord when he produce
[1:02:29] food for Elijah he brought what we are
[1:02:35] talking about the sword of the Spirit
[1:02:38] but clear okay there is there was a cake
[1:02:43] of barley bread tumble into the host of
[1:02:46] median and came to attend and snorted
[1:02:49] that he fell and overturn it that
[1:02:52] détente lay along what was destroying
[1:02:55] the camp of Midian he was a cake what
[1:02:58] does that cake mean are you then verse
[1:03:06] 14 the other fella is giving the
[1:03:10] interpretation and his fellow answered
[1:03:12] and saying this is nothing else after
[1:03:22] either serve the sword so a cake
[1:03:28] represented a soul and the soul is the
[1:03:32] designer of the intent of the so when
[1:03:36] Elijah mated with the woman she must
[1:03:39] have her cake when the angel of the Lord
[1:03:43] bring the equipment he must be a
[1:03:46] Ministry of the sword to discern
[1:03:54] everybody clear and his fellow said this
[1:03:57] is nothing else says the sword of Gideon
[1:04:00] the son of Jewish a man of Israel for
[1:04:05] into his hand has got the liver media
[1:04:07] and all host so the interpretation was
[1:04:11] the sword of who did job to verse 18
[1:04:17] when I blow with a trumpet I am all data
[1:04:22] with me then blow you the trumpet
[1:04:24] so every sad all of all DCAM and say the
[1:04:29] sword of who I thought he was the sword
[1:04:32] of Gideon they sought after and of who
[1:04:37] the sword of God and His Messenger
[1:04:41] that's why under the third pool when
[1:04:45] brother Branham was praying the sword of
[1:04:48] the king struck his head and brother
[1:04:51] branham said his hand not the sword of
[1:04:55] water problem but it's the sword of the
[1:04:57] Lord and brother branham his feet his
[1:05:00] head are you there the angel of the Lord
[1:05:07] took his and put on somebody's shirt and
[1:05:11] went abroad and random took his own and
[1:05:14] put it there any matches the sword of
[1:05:17] the Lord and Gideon are there why we
[1:05:27] need the second pool first
[1:05:31] there is water that's why brother
[1:05:33] brother have to engage into a discussion
[1:05:36] how do you do sister how are you doing
[1:05:38] he's bringing he's asking for order he's
[1:05:41] asking for order and suddenly he said
[1:05:43] you know there is somebody between me
[1:05:45] and you the angel of the Lord is there
[1:05:48] pulling the sword and before you know it
[1:05:50] what about himself I see you twenty
[1:05:52] years I see you walking over there it is
[1:05:55] the sword that is dividing it is in a
[1:06:00] scripture in the Ministry of Raja and he
[1:06:03] only happened to the widow woman of the
[1:06:06] Delta the first full healing second poor
[1:06:16] prophecy or discernment word and we
[1:06:20] found out that they turn pool with
[1:06:22] healing we have healing by miracle we
[1:06:24] explained that on Wednesday and we also
[1:06:26] have healing by casting out of Devils
[1:06:28] are you there now brother branham say
[1:06:30] take this thick turn it into a snake we
[1:06:34] already seen Bassam they won't listen to
[1:06:36] that then
[1:06:37] your hand in your bosom that's a second
[1:06:39] son pull it out here yourself of leprosy
[1:06:42] then they shall believe it and then if
[1:06:45] they were here then waters out of the
[1:06:48] now down there pour it on the dry land
[1:06:50] and all of the waters who become glad
[1:06:53] there was a National Sun that's why the
[1:06:59] cloud has to be taken by somebody else
[1:07:04] because the cloud must be a national Sun
[1:07:13] the people who believe it when them
[1:07:16] that's ready to receive it David
[1:07:19] when they see the Son of God moving but
[1:07:22] the nation has to have something
[1:07:24] different that life he have to be on the
[1:07:27] newspaper because it is a National Sun
[1:07:31] and we found out that those two sons
[1:07:33] were under the atonement we say we
[1:07:37] explained that always did what about the
[1:07:39] third son is the third son under the
[1:07:42] atonement well that oh I just can't say
[1:07:46] nothing about it for I can't place it in
[1:07:49] the atonement that's all brother branham
[1:07:50] whosoever say it shall come to pass you
[1:07:54] can have what you say what about him say
[1:07:55] I don't see that in the atonement
[1:07:57] because Jesus give that amendment before
[1:07:59] he died are you there and I have stood
[1:08:02] here at the same pulpit and try and run
[1:08:05] on the scripture and we frame through it
[1:08:07] and go back because I was afraid to use
[1:08:09] it
[1:08:09] dan brother branham begin to think about
[1:08:13] that scripture he say and he got after I
[1:08:16] was speaking there for a while inside
[1:08:19] myself just thinking till I became so
[1:08:21] conscious of something near til he was
[1:08:24] talking to said I was talking to someone
[1:08:26] and something said to me that is in the
[1:08:29] atonement the torture for if a man or a
[1:08:35] woman it is so consecrated and
[1:08:39] surrendered to God and that God just
[1:08:41] moving and uses their voice and it is
[1:08:45] not
[1:08:45] men speaking it is God that is in him
[1:08:48] speaking so the third son is also under
[1:08:53] the atonement and the son of speaking to
[1:08:57] it if you go to the book of Matthew
[1:08:59] you'll find that when Jesus entered the
[1:09:02] earth a Roman centurion that came to him
[1:09:05] he was not a Jew and as I say I will go
[1:09:09] and heal your servant and the men say no
[1:09:12] no no no no we Gentile we don't operate
[1:09:15] like that the laying of a lease for the
[1:09:19] Jewish people
[1:09:20] we gentle I am a military man when I say
[1:09:24] go the men go when I say come the men
[1:09:28] come I'm gonna tell you I want you to
[1:09:31] use the power of the spoken word and one
[1:09:38] Jesus Luke Israel I have not found this
[1:09:45] face these Pharisees for the Delta
[1:09:51] either he was in the pool is also in the
[1:09:56] atonement and what the panel said
[1:09:58] everything that is in the atonement is a
[1:10:01] personal property of every leader
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] healing is the children's bread we
[1:10:12] realize that it's in the atonement and
[1:10:15] the atonement first is applied to us oh
[1:10:17] I am the God I forgive you your sins and
[1:10:20] heal you your disease soul and healing
[1:10:23] sin right and healing has always fallen
[1:10:28] every lesson the Sun of righteousness
[1:10:32] arise with healing meaning there is a
[1:10:36] message are there and it's also been a
[1:10:42] meant to get the people together
[1:10:45] that's why brother Branham called that a
[1:10:48] pool are you deaf okay let me drop down
[1:10:52] divine healing and singing and festival
[1:10:56] I've brought a ball for it used to say
[1:10:58] it's their bed on the hook and you
[1:11:02] should officially bid not the hook
[1:11:05] because there is a rainbow trout that
[1:11:09] God is looking but in order to gain the
[1:11:13] attention God hook the first pool when
[1:11:17] you begin to heal people then suddenly
[1:11:19] you turn around you say there's a
[1:11:21] preacher day they have a strong gift of
[1:11:23] healing when you approach him he opened
[1:11:26] the second pool and when you enter you
[1:11:30] say your name is Colima yo did you know
[1:11:34] me before Abraham before before your
[1:11:38] friend caught you when you are playing
[1:11:40] under the fig tree
[1:11:42] I'll show you there oh you are the
[1:11:44] Messiah that was a that was it are you
[1:11:50] there and he says that that is just the
[1:11:53] thing to get the people to listen a
[1:11:56] while till you can really free your so
[1:12:02] to focus your attention
[1:12:04] get your Facebook get you off this get
[1:12:08] you off this until you have really
[1:12:10] focused then he fire one Tom are you
[1:12:15] there and he gets you wantem and your
[1:12:18] salvation is secure
[1:12:20] eternally are you know he said God has
[1:12:26] did that in every age through every age
[1:12:29] there has always been a healing campaign
[1:12:32] and if it's a genuine healing campaign
[1:12:35] behind our campaign always is a message
[1:12:40] there never is a son given just for son
[1:12:43] it is for running a message are you
[1:12:47] there everybody clear so far but random
[1:12:50] continually said divine healing is just
[1:12:53] like going fishing ever sure they fish
[1:12:56] the hook if you notice the bait is a
[1:12:59] food I read they cat is a food
[1:13:11] okay I hope you get that one I hope you
[1:13:15] get that one are you okay when Jesus met
[1:13:20] the be subtle after his conversation
[1:13:22] with the woman at the well the disciple
[1:13:25] brought food from the city they said
[1:13:27] master you must eat you say no I want it
[1:13:30] they say wait a minute who gave you food
[1:13:32] Jesus say I have meat I have food that
[1:13:36] you don't understand my food is not your
[1:13:40] natural it is to do the will of the
[1:13:43] Father the Bible is written in symbols
[1:13:49] you need their prophet to unlock the
[1:13:53] symbols are you there and he grabbed the
[1:13:57] bear you just show him the babe he grabs
[1:14:00] the bait and get the hook that's the way
[1:14:03] it is with divine healing it's
[1:14:05] attractive poo because it demonstrates
[1:14:09] and prove that there is a God that lives
[1:14:12] and is interested in you you know there
[1:14:17] is a healing coming up there is a man
[1:14:20] who's interested in you he begin to give
[1:14:22] you gift he's trying to pull your
[1:14:25] attention are you there
[1:14:26] okay and the believer the unbelievers
[1:14:30] see that quickly his eye catches it and
[1:14:33] knows there is a living God and then
[1:14:36] he's on the land of what salvation now
[1:14:39] he begin to follow after God can go to
[1:14:43] controlling him dead and winding him in
[1:14:46] so that's what divine healing is for
[1:14:50] merely for the sake everybody clear
[1:14:53] so on Matthew 7 we found out that both
[1:14:56] the first and the second pool was
[1:14:59] impersonated because Jesus say many
[1:15:02] shall come in my name this I said have
[1:15:06] we not cast on never have will not
[1:15:09] prophesy this and this so in other word
[1:15:12] the first and the second pool be
[1:15:15] impersonated
[1:15:16] that's what Jesus was saying because
[1:15:19] casting out Devils doing miracle it's
[1:15:22] the first full prophecy is the second
[1:15:25] pool and Jesus say many will come to me
[1:15:28] say have we not prophesy in your name
[1:15:30] second pool
[1:15:31] have we not cast our devil in your name
[1:15:34] first pool
[1:15:35] have we not one miracle in your name
[1:15:37] first pool I said and I will answer them
[1:15:40] I don't know you in other words the
[1:15:42] first and the second pool will be
[1:15:44] impersonated everybody here now what we
[1:15:51] what we call son in the Bible through
[1:15:57] Moses in our prophet ministry it is
[1:16:01] called pools are you there for there
[1:16:05] Brad that is called
[1:16:08] the gifts to the spirit relax
[1:16:13] are you there check first Corinthians
[1:16:16] chapter 12 probably there might be one
[1:16:30] or two or one more scripture and we know
[1:16:33] we're gonna read anymore unless the Lord
[1:16:36] directed are you there
[1:16:37] 1st Corinthians chapter 12 you gonna
[1:16:40] read the Bible and you follow the board
[1:16:42] everybody clear please verse 7 the Bible
[1:16:46] says four to one is given by the spirit
[1:16:49] the word of wisdom there is a gift
[1:16:53] called the word of wisdom it is called
[1:16:56] God gift we going through the non gift
[1:16:59] that gift is under the office of
[1:17:03] prophecy watch your color blue blue are
[1:17:08] you there I'm going slowly verse 7 verse
[1:17:13] 7 let me go by verse 7 I jump into it
[1:17:17] but the manifestation of the Spirit is
[1:17:20] given to every man to profit with us so
[1:17:22] every man have access to this are you
[1:17:25] there some are born but even if you're
[1:17:28] not born for
[1:17:29] for the gift you have the right to the
[1:17:31] gift are you there
[1:17:34] I have a code for that one is given the
[1:17:37] gift of the word of wisdom the add-in
[1:17:41] added the word of what knowledge
[1:17:44] I put the word of knowledge under
[1:17:46] prophesy brother Branham helped me up
[1:17:50] but you are just trying to learn how to
[1:17:54] write the check for your healing well
[1:17:57] now if he might do something that would
[1:17:59] speak to you of something that has been
[1:18:02] that he had to have a have be the spirit
[1:18:07] of prophecy or a gift of the word off
[1:18:12] everybody clear that would go back down
[1:18:16] through your life journey and find
[1:18:18] something down through there and bring
[1:18:21] it back to your memory so a gift of
[1:18:25] knowledge the world of knowledge works
[1:18:28] like prophecy everybody here he could
[1:18:33] take the profit with the gift of what
[1:18:36] everybody here and first show them what
[1:18:40] was going to be and there could speak it
[1:18:42] because it's a word of knowledge that
[1:18:46] God gives to his prophet and he'd
[1:18:48] foretell it before he come to pass
[1:18:50] because God knows all things so that's
[1:18:53] why the word of knowledge is under
[1:18:56] prophecy everybody clear
[1:18:58] let's continue now first heed for one
[1:19:01] the spirit of the word of wisdom another
[1:19:03] the word of knowledge by the same spirit
[1:19:06] to another faith faith to do what
[1:19:10] miracle if I have all the faith to move
[1:19:14] the mountain if I have not charity first
[1:19:17] to do what miracle faith fall under the
[1:19:20] first pool I'm going slowly okay let's
[1:19:25] go now verse 9 first by the same spirit
[1:19:29] to another the gift of word healing
[1:19:32] under the first pool we clear by the
[1:19:37] same spirit it's the same spirit to
[1:19:40] another they're working off
[1:19:42] mirakl under the first pool everybody
[1:19:45] there no problem let's go and to another
[1:19:49] prophecy under the second pool everybody
[1:19:52] clear
[1:19:53] to another discernment of spirit under
[1:19:58] the second pool to another deference
[1:20:02] kind of tongue to another interpretation
[1:20:07] of tongue when you speak in tongue and
[1:20:09] the reason interpret it is prophecy are
[1:20:13] you there
[1:20:14] both of those days everybody there so
[1:20:18] right here you can see that all you're
[1:20:21] not gift are under the first and the
[1:20:26] second pool are we there that's why the
[1:20:31] devil can impersonate all of those gift
[1:20:38] because the first and the second who can
[1:20:41] be impersonated let's go there Delta who
[1:20:45] make us impersonate every gift
[1:20:48] why did brother Branham say that could
[1:20:52] make us go out lay hand on the secret
[1:20:55] Facebook and then would recover could
[1:20:58] make us speak in tongue second pool
[1:21:00] could make us interpret tongue second
[1:21:02] pool could make us have wisdom second
[1:21:05] pool knowledge second pool but that
[1:21:07] doesn't take it Lord you say look how
[1:21:11] brother branham is hooking that with
[1:21:13] matthew seven you say many will come in
[1:21:17] there do you see how brother branham is
[1:21:20] taking the gift of the Spirit and this
[1:21:22] scripture and putting them together
[1:21:26] I didn't fabricate that either many will
[1:21:32] come in that day and say Lord Lord have
[1:21:34] we not done these things in your name
[1:21:35] he said depart for me working often so
[1:21:39] brother branham take this first pool and
[1:21:41] the second pool that Jesus was put and
[1:21:43] combined them with the gift of the
[1:21:45] Spirit and left it alone
[1:21:49] you need the Spirit that work with
[1:21:51] brother Branham to understand the
[1:21:54] message of brother Branham
[1:21:56] are you there why are people toast about
[1:22:00] take all your gift that you have in the
[1:22:03] scripture the devil can impersonate
[1:22:05] every one of them but he can impersonate
[1:22:10] love you remember love is the bond of
[1:22:14] what perfection love is the capstone he
[1:22:18] can play around with those gifts is that
[1:22:21] but not love are we clear now okay
[1:22:26] because love is genuine the devil can
[1:22:32] love are you then that's one thing he
[1:22:37] can do and when you get to a place that
[1:22:40] you love one another and all the world
[1:22:42] is dead I'm going slowly
[1:22:46] I will imply in you of Pentecostal idea
[1:22:50] into the message of the hour are you
[1:22:55] there love is what they turn pool cannot
[1:23:01] be passionate all that I'm going slowly
[1:23:06] now what about you efficient for all
[1:23:11] your form Ministry of Ephesian are under
[1:23:14] the second pool that's what Branham a
[1:23:21] seer a vision seer or a prophet whatever
[1:23:26] you want to call it a prophet is a
[1:23:28] compound word okay
[1:23:31] just like sanctification is a compound
[1:23:33] word means clean and set aside service
[1:23:36] and there is many word and especially in
[1:23:38] our English words are compound but the
[1:23:40] Prophet means to give personal
[1:23:42] experience under inspiration or foresee
[1:23:45] things another code word random say and
[1:23:48] I stood still if people call me prophet
[1:23:50] many time because they prophet in
[1:23:52] English Testament is just a apostle
[1:23:58] preacher evangelist preacher teacher
[1:24:01] preacher pastor preacher and all all the
[1:24:05] faithful ministry preacher therefore
[1:24:07] under
[1:24:08] see second pool a little professor
[1:24:12] foretelling of the world identification
[1:24:17] of crust the English word profit PR o th
[1:24:21] et means earth preacher just anybody
[1:24:26] preaching under the under prophecy so if
[1:24:32] this gift whatever is under the first
[1:24:35] book and the second book can be
[1:24:37] impersonated the faithful ministry also
[1:24:41] can be impersonated let's go to 2nd
[1:24:45] Corinthians chapter 11
[1:24:56] don't be after preacher don't be after
[1:25:00] gift go first to love and then after
[1:25:04] love you go back now to creatures are
[1:25:08] you there verse 11 everybody there that
[1:25:12] happy 11 verse 13 for such are false
[1:25:14] apostles deceitful workers transforming
[1:25:18] themselves into a postal off and no
[1:25:22] Marvel for Satan himself is transformed
[1:25:25] into an angel of light
[1:25:27] verse 15 therefore it is not great
[1:25:30] things if his ministers also be
[1:25:35] transformed as ministers of
[1:25:38] righteousness whose end shall be
[1:25:40] according to the work that's why
[1:25:45] preacher need to be very careful
[1:25:49] preaching the message does not qualify
[1:25:53] you you might be preaching the message
[1:25:57] but your heart is like a devil get into
[1:26:04] the world of preacher and you have a
[1:26:07] stumbling block the people that stand on
[1:26:11] a poopy talking they can tell you one
[1:26:13] thing today tomorrow they say something
[1:26:15] different they
[1:26:16] like here the under pornography they
[1:26:19] under this and this they forget that the
[1:26:21] file for ministry can be personated are
[1:26:30] you there
[1:26:31] what do we need to do brother Steven I
[1:26:34] will rather have a church that knows
[1:26:37] nothing about any spiritual gift so
[1:26:41] brother Steven we don't need non
[1:26:43] spiritual gift hold on let me look this
[1:26:47] and kill the church and I just and just
[1:26:53] be so in love with each other and with
[1:26:56] Christ I rather have that than every
[1:26:59] spiritual gift operating in the church
[1:27:02] whatever Adam doesn't say we don't need
[1:27:04] spiritual gift he's bringing a point and
[1:27:07] I'm gonna let him say I don't want to
[1:27:10] explain it then you will say that's
[1:27:11] brother Steven explanation no let him
[1:27:13] himself explain are you there now that
[1:27:16] might sound hard in a Pentecostal group
[1:27:19] but I would I would rather have it where
[1:27:22] there is gift
[1:27:23] there shall fail right that's why per se
[1:27:28] when that which is perfect to come it
[1:27:31] even come in the day of power you need
[1:27:33] to come in the end time are you deaf
[1:27:38] okay now where there is gift
[1:27:41] there shall bring confusion where there
[1:27:43] is gift they can be questioned but where
[1:27:47] there is love it is perfect and God is
[1:27:51] love that's what the Bible say are you
[1:27:54] there that's right if you have perfect
[1:27:57] love you would have perfect gift in
[1:28:02] other words be united first with your
[1:28:05] husband be united first will crush your
[1:28:09] first husband must die once you are
[1:28:12] united with your correct husband then
[1:28:15] automatically
[1:28:17] your gift bus because love is the bonds
[1:28:24] of perfection that's the capstone to
[1:28:28] correct the gift to put their gift in
[1:28:31] life to put the minister in life to put
[1:28:34] your life in line are you there
[1:28:40] and if you had perfect love you had
[1:28:43] perfect deep that's why so work first
[1:28:45] with love that brings fellowship is love
[1:28:50] between you and God it brings fellowship
[1:28:53] and fellowship brings what when you
[1:28:56] consecrate your life landing your own
[1:29:00] business not being on the telephone
[1:29:03] about people
[1:29:05] consecrating yourself before you know it
[1:29:08] you'll find a vision pop up you'll find
[1:29:12] yourself speaking in tongue at work
[1:29:16] you'll find yourself the angel visiting
[1:29:19] you the problem is we only follow all
[1:29:22] the trauma no love no fellowship no
[1:29:29] consecration and the gift is locked
[1:29:33] because if God opened up with the life
[1:29:36] you are living now it's going to be a
[1:29:39] mess it's going to encourage you to do
[1:29:42] bad things I lied and I pray for the
[1:29:47] sick and he got healed it's not going to
[1:29:49] help you to repent that's a problem with
[1:29:52] preachers they say one thing today
[1:29:55] tomorrow they change they do something
[1:29:57] bad they don't repent and they go pray
[1:29:59] and the anointing fall and they think
[1:30:01] like what they did is right but what you
[1:30:13] see Pentecostal people you are going
[1:30:16] after this in his field of death Giver
[1:30:22] come back to God get the real divine
[1:30:26] love in your heart your fellowship that
[1:30:30] you just love him with all your heart
[1:30:32] brother the gift you will take care of
[1:30:35] itself
[1:30:37] we made the gift but be careful
[1:30:41] it's a dangerous ground so to have your
[1:30:45] gift in order you need perfect bond and
[1:30:49] perfect bond comes from the love of God
[1:30:52] which is the message of the hour that's
[1:30:57] why I would not by God's grace deviate
[1:30:59] from the message I won't give you
[1:31:03] alfalfa here and you go crazy are you
[1:31:07] there
[1:31:08] you just love him with your heart
[1:31:11] brother
[1:31:12] give to a take care of itself just let
[1:31:15] that alone another one consequent mark
[1:31:18] to your husband the more you love your
[1:31:21] husband your husband gets so crazy until
[1:31:25] when he is coming from work he stopped
[1:31:27] we say let me stop a bell let me get
[1:31:30] some chocolate let me get something like
[1:31:32] this and before you know it you open the
[1:31:34] door hear this oh why did you answer me
[1:31:37] because love is flowing and heaps take
[1:31:40] care of themselves since your husband
[1:31:49] being your husband be close to him and
[1:31:53] before you know it you will have to
[1:31:55] serve that check when he gets so drunk
[1:31:59] not with whiskey Belov he's gonna tell
[1:32:03] you that the credit card incorporated
[1:32:07] gives our medical they won't get mad at
[1:32:11] you because you work out with the
[1:32:12] groceries that's a pastoral message this
[1:32:20] is a man
[1:32:24] God will bless in the church the press
[1:32:28] that he sees you after he is adopted you
[1:32:32] in the family
[1:32:33] he will call you someday in a later
[1:32:37] prayer meeting the first thing you know
[1:32:39] and place their robe upon you and say
[1:32:42] now son I have sent you to preach the
[1:32:45] gospel the whole world will know about
[1:32:47] it that's right he will call you out and
[1:32:50] say son I have send you to pray for the
[1:32:52] sick in other words the more you
[1:32:54] consecrated one day God will come
[1:32:57] directly and speak to you and say
[1:32:59] brother LeMond the reason why I put you
[1:33:01] in my kingdom I want you to do this
[1:33:04] clear you don't have to push anything
[1:33:08] but random continually say the people
[1:33:11] that believe in him knows him unless
[1:33:14] they are constantly in the word to know
[1:33:18] what you is if you are not constantly in
[1:33:21] the world how are you gonna know what
[1:33:23] your husband is telling you are you
[1:33:26] there
[1:33:26] now now he shall appear in the last day
[1:33:30] is to bring the people back to the world
[1:33:33] so that Brad so that the bride would
[1:33:36] know her husband know her met the
[1:33:39] reserved world your husband is the
[1:33:45] reveal get in the message and the gift
[1:33:53] will operate automatically every age he
[1:33:58] was the same cry he what he says the
[1:34:02] speech say if you are Christian you will
[1:34:04] get back to what the Spirit is teaching
[1:34:06] that is the word of this age every
[1:34:09] messenger to every edge will preach that
[1:34:11] word every fresh and true revival will
[1:34:17] be because men have gotten back to the
[1:34:20] world of death
[1:34:21] that's why I must keep the message fewer
[1:34:24] because if the message is not pure
[1:34:27] brother branham said the revolver dies
[1:34:30] but if we keep the message pure you want
[1:34:34] to see automatically in your life one
[1:34:36] after the other gives to begin to pop up
[1:34:39] in this church are you there are you
[1:34:42] there from the first book I got you
[1:34:45] brother Maurice the Bible Genesis to the
[1:34:48] last book revelation there is only one
[1:34:50] reason for God displeasure live in the
[1:34:52] world and there is only one remedy to
[1:34:55] began his favor back to the world you
[1:35:00] are the favor of God back to the message
[1:35:03] but woe unto that congregation when an
[1:35:07] anointed man of God tries to bring them
[1:35:10] to the word and they won't line up with
[1:35:12] it
[1:35:12] how is he going to have a church that
[1:35:15] all denali-- gift is operating in and so
[1:35:18] forth day and that and the church won't
[1:35:21] even live decently and morally won't
[1:35:25] learn their ABCs of the gospel then say
[1:35:28] if I had a better preacher it's not the
[1:35:30] preacher why it's your fault we want the
[1:35:34] clean life consecrated with the word and
[1:35:36] automatically the gifting so confused by
[1:35:40] the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so
[1:35:42] forth Saturn can impersonate any kind of
[1:35:44] gift that God has God but he cannot
[1:35:46] bring them word word by word that's
[1:35:51] where he fell in the Garden of Eden that
[1:35:54] is where he always fell your husband is
[1:35:58] the revealed word so the woman of the
[1:36:01] world had water the word a widowed woman
[1:36:04] water and cake and there was two times
[1:36:07] that the angel of the Lord touch Elijah
[1:36:10] by bringing him cake in water which we
[1:36:13] already explained --'tis and those two
[1:36:15] touch are the first and the second two
[1:36:18] are you there and the third one he goes
[1:36:20] from Horeb why there is a rainbow trout
[1:36:24] which have a rainbow a covenant it shad
[1:36:28] any left of God then God need to hook
[1:36:31] you but to hook he used the bait
[1:36:34] to use their bed and then he opened up
[1:36:36] with the second pool to prepare your
[1:36:38] heart husband comes and uh but the
[1:36:42] husband is Bob Oh God richly bless you
[1:36:46] you might say you may be standing as a
[1:37:01] summary brother Steve and what are you
[1:37:03] talking about we're talking about the
[1:37:05] pools the sons in the ministry of the
[1:37:10] entire God the angel of the Lord work
[1:37:13] with brother branham with three sons and
[1:37:17] brother branham say if I die that angels
[1:37:20] stay with the brand but when the Angels
[1:37:23] stay with the Brad do we still have the
[1:37:25] first and the second and the third cool
[1:37:27] yes we have them not do we going to be
[1:37:31] holding people like brother branham no
[1:37:33] but the gift of the Spirit have been
[1:37:36] placed displayed to you for God to
[1:37:38] continue to use you to heal you but
[1:37:41] before you get there make sure you pay
[1:37:45] attention to your husband get connected
[1:37:47] to your husband and the gift would take
[1:37:50] care of itself
[1:37:51] get in love with God pray pray
[1:37:55] consecrate yourself before you know it
