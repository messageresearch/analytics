[18:19] nerve and had been there for at least a
[18:22] month and my arm was going numb
[18:25] and that particular night it was just
[18:26] aching I don't know if you ever have
[18:28] that sort of a achy feeling and I just
[18:31] couldn't shake it and sister Teresa was
[18:34] sitting in the living room and I said
[18:36] something to her about it and she come
[18:38] walking in just really slowly and kind
[18:40] of looked at me she says do you want me
[18:42] to pray for you
[18:44] so I said well yeah
[18:46] and so
[18:48] I'm sitting there at the kitchen table
[18:49] and she just leaned over and she put her
[18:51] hand on my shoulder and she started to
[18:54] pray
[18:55] and brother Robert literally while she
[18:57] was praying the pain lifted
[19:00] [Applause]
[19:08] now I'm going to tell on myself here
[19:11] because it's only righteous that I tell
[19:12] on myself but I lifted up my arms like
[19:15] this and I was I couldn't lift my arm up
[19:18] literally it hurt too much to lift mama
[19:20] and I looked at it straight up like that
[19:22] and I looked at her and I said I don't
[19:24] believe it
[19:31] and she looked at me and said Sam
[19:37] anyways we're still humans so keep me in

[38:39] of my Celestial home let even be strong
[38:46] and be
[38:49] to the
[38:51] Eternal plane
[38:55] amen
[38:56] let's give them a clap of
[38:59] amen
[39:03] glory to God
[39:06] amen that's a wonderful song
[39:09] and it's related to the revelation of
[39:12] what you're getting
[39:13] amen glory to God with what you're
[39:18] getting
[39:19] not only here but what a broad is
[39:22] getting all over the world Amen even
[39:26] when you listen to a song you need you
[39:29] should be able not to start filtering
[39:31] the song
[39:33] through the Revelation that you got amen
[39:36] if a song doesn't match your Revelation
[39:39] you reject it
[39:40] don't sing it
[39:45] can you give me more of the volume by
[39:47] David so I don't have to worry about it
[39:49] who's saying amen amen amen glory to God
[39:53] praise God that's what I'm saying amen
[39:55] amen amen so if you if God unfolded
[40:00] something to you
[40:02] God is calling you to that level
[40:05] and once you reach that level everything
[40:08] that God opened your eyes to that is no
[40:12] longer good to you you gotta let it go
[40:14] amen amen in other words if God opened
[40:18] the message of Wesley you cannot
[40:20] continue to worship God under Luther
[40:23] You're Gonna Miss God God is already
[40:26] moving you gotta move with the pillar of
[40:28] fight you cannot stay on the looter and
[40:30] trying to please God anymore amen so in
[40:33] other words as you grow up like Paul say
[40:36] when I see you might be seated
[40:39] go to First Corinthians chapter 13.
[40:43] glory to God
[40:46] I hope not those not here who will be
[40:49] looking at what I'm trying to say and
[40:52] glean something from there let's go to
[40:54] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[40:57] um
[40:58] amen
[41:01] Hallelujah
[41:04] it's very familiar
[41:06] amen
[41:08] go to verse 11.
[41:10] because first time they have something
[41:12] big
[41:13] that we'll see how we're going to get
[41:15] into that on Sunday amen verse 11 say
[41:19] when I was a child
[41:21] speak as a
[41:23] and I understood as a and I thought as a
[41:28] is there anything wrong
[41:33] there was nothing wrong
[41:35] if Elijah talked like a child there is
[41:38] nothing wrong
[41:39] if you talk like an adult everybody will
[41:42] raise their eyebrow like wait a minute
[41:43] where did you learn this
[41:45] anybody okay so as long as he's a child
[41:47] what he's doing at that level he's good
[41:51] and there is a level of Tolerance
[41:55] because it's a time sometimes we look we
[41:57] say don't worry about it it's a child
[41:59] she doesn't understand we just tell you
[42:01] stop and we keep moving but when you
[42:03] grow up and you continue to do childish
[42:06] thing that when it doesn't match up and
[42:09] we say either something is wrong or
[42:12] somebody is or something is not
[42:16] going correctly I'm not saying that word
[42:18] wrong but I'm just saying blah so you
[42:20] see what I'm trying to say in other
[42:21] words there is something wrong with the
[42:23] growth of that person because a person
[42:26] who's maybe 25 years old will we expect
[42:29] him to behave a certain way everybody
[42:31] okay so it goes the same with the
[42:33] Revelation because as we grow they're
[42:37] understanding the revelation of a child
[42:39] is different than the revelation of an
[42:41] adult so as we grow in the Lord and the
[42:45] Lord continued to open his word to us
[42:47] are your level of revelation of
[42:50] understanding is now growing so God
[42:53] requires you to behave at the level of
[42:58] your understanding
[43:00] so you cannot look at somebody else and
[43:02] say well they are doing this no when you
[43:05] do that you are blocking yourself
[43:06] because you don't know if that person is
[43:09] predestinated or not you don't know if
[43:12] that person will reach your level or not
[43:14] you don't know if that person would not
[43:16] reach that level until a certain fix
[43:19] that God is still working with it so as
[43:22] the Lord open your path this is an
[43:25] individual walk for the Gentile do not
[43:28] wait on anybody
[43:30] everybody okay so you keep moving with
[43:33] the Revelation so if the Lord open up
[43:35] something to you you cannot sit down or
[43:38] sit back and say no I cannot progress
[43:40] with this you're blocking yourself from
[43:42] the blessing of God Abraham walk alone
[43:45] with God God have to create allow
[43:48] something to happen to separate him from
[43:51] lot so that God can deal with him
[43:54] and individually personally because he
[43:57] was taking the faith of Abraham to a
[44:00] certain level because Abraham will be
[44:02] the father of us all so if he's going to
[44:05] be the father of us or what kind of
[44:07] level he need to go to they need to take
[44:09] him higher so you don't know who you're
[44:11] going to be
[44:12] bringing into this gospel you don't know
[44:15] who you're going to be preaching the
[44:16] message so when God unfolds something to
[44:20] you you go to that level if you
[44:22] understand something when you're
[44:23] listening to the word or maybe there is
[44:26] a new song that came up there
[44:27] everybody's singing that in a message
[44:30] it's a popular song among the young
[44:32] people before you sing it push the brick
[44:36] hey everybody okay stop and look and
[44:39] listen to the word forget about the
[44:41] melody because Pentecostal has
[44:43] specialized in feeling
[44:45] forget about the man or just sit down
[44:46] and say what is all about this song is
[44:49] it about Jesus Christ what kind of
[44:51] Christ what kind of Revelation is coming
[44:54] up if he doesn't cope with the
[44:56] revelation of the hour stop it
[44:59] that is not your food
[45:02] amen anybody okay if we line up with the
[45:04] Revelation in other words you got to
[45:06] filter things through the thinking men's
[45:08] filter when you filter it and you look
[45:10] you say okay this is correct with the
[45:12] Revelation then you can sing it and when
[45:15] you sing it you are singing that with
[45:17] understanding maybe more than the one
[45:20] who sang it but if that person is still
[45:22] under the revelation of Father's son
[45:25] Holy Ghost and he's confused about the
[45:27] deity you're not going to be sitting at
[45:29] home with the knowledge that you have
[45:31] singing Holy Father and then Precious
[45:35] Jesus something is wrong with you you
[45:38] are worshiping God wrong
[45:39] and if that anointing comes I want to
[45:42] work on anointing again because you know
[45:44] better not to do that
[45:49] everybody okay in other words whatever
[45:52] you hear you must have a standard a
[45:54] reference that you're filtering
[45:57] everything through it
[45:59] amen amen amen and then you would know
[46:02] what to reject because the enemy at this
[46:04] time is very very very very very slick
[46:08] amen so continue to pray for our sound
[46:10] system we already installed everything
[46:12] pretty much there is few items that are
[46:15] left but you can see how the devil is
[46:17] fighting us not only the sand system if
[46:20] you go back and you live you look at the
[46:22] sermon you will see sometime the the the
[46:24] streaming the sound is going off and
[46:27] something thinks that we never had a
[46:29] little bit before but it's happening I
[46:32] know it's the death that is doing that
[46:34] sometimes he will block the slide and
[46:36] you can get the code unless I send it to
[46:39] you you lucky praise God you can get it

[59:39] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[59:41] sword may the Lord add a blessing to the
[59:44] reading of his word you may be seated
[59:47] it says that his Spirit and the sword
[59:49] and able to pierce him even to the
[59:51] dividing as under the Soul and Spirit
[59:53] and the joints in the marrow and it is a
[59:56] discerner of the thoughts and the
[59:58] intents of the heart
[59:59] you know here everyone tonight we had a
[1:00:02] wonderful time today by the grace of God
[1:00:05] and uh how about six Souls turn their
[1:00:07] life over to the Lord you know
[1:00:12] you know he's doing some great things
[1:00:14] you know so yeah y'all pray with me I
[1:00:16] stay in the middle of the road when it
[1:00:18] started here because of it but this is
[1:00:20] what was on my heart for here tonight
[1:00:23] but we've been having a great time by
[1:00:26] the grace of God you know when you're
[1:00:27] going to those institutions now you
[1:00:29] thank God for the ministry that's here
[1:00:31] and when you thank God for the ministry
[1:00:33] is here for the end time message for
[1:00:36] this hour you can go in anywhere you
[1:00:39] know anytime in any place with boldness
[1:00:41] is that right because you know you've
[1:00:43] seen you we're not worrying about the
[1:00:45] word we're not concerned about the mess
[1:00:47] what we want to know is just make sure
[1:00:49] God is with us wherever we go that's
[1:00:51] what we need to know and if God wants
[1:00:54] God show you that is when the devil's in
[1:00:56] trouble somebody's going to get set free
[1:00:58] somebody's going to be saved somebody's
[1:01:01] going to get delivered somebody's going
[1:01:03] to get healed somebody is going to need
[1:01:05] all they need why because God said the
[1:01:08] word of God is able to discern his
[1:01:11] thoughts and intense of a heart so when
[1:01:13] you go into a place like that and nobody
[1:01:16] really knows you and God's pricking
[1:01:19] their heart because he's the only one
[1:01:20] that's able to go down there and discern
[1:01:23] the thoughts and the attention of the
[1:01:24] heart is that right
[1:01:26] well you want to look at here tonight
[1:01:28] you know I got the inspiration from um
[1:01:30] in the message of the end time
[1:01:33] evangelist
[1:01:34] you know the end time evangelist there
[1:01:36] was so much food in there thought of
[1:01:39] those have listened to that message you
[1:01:40] know there's no way we're going to get
[1:01:42] through all that tonight so you pray
[1:01:44] with me because there's so much that was
[1:01:46] in there but what was pricking my heart
[1:01:49] this is what I want to lean to you know
[1:01:52] I've always when I go in a place I
[1:01:54] recognize by God's grace and mercy that
[1:01:57] our battle is salvation versus religion
[1:02:01] but you know we want to look at tonight
[1:02:03] the True Stone Nation versus the
[1:02:07] religious Stone Mason
[1:02:09] okay when we get friends going through
[1:02:12] the message you'll see what brother
[1:02:13] Brandon was working with in that thought
[1:02:16] it's a true Stone Mason versus the
[1:02:19] religious Stone Mason you know all of
[1:02:21] them is building they're building out
[1:02:23] there but he was saying you know in
[1:02:25] every age when he started off in that
[1:02:28] thought he was talking about the
[1:02:30] messengers for every age and he said
[1:02:33] into his dinner and you know the first
[1:02:35] age was the even age is that right and
[1:02:38] in that age we know God was the
[1:02:40] messenger to Adam and Eve then so God
[1:02:44] being the messenger to Adam and Eve they
[1:02:47] got us straight from the Throne of God
[1:02:49] is that right
[1:02:51] that's why we know what God has given us
[1:02:54] is from the strength from the Throne of
[1:02:56] God
[1:02:57] when you're coming from Straight From
[1:02:59] The Throne of God you come in expecting
[1:03:02] is that right whatever you're needing
[1:03:05] you'll come expecting and you know he
[1:03:07] will meet your need
[1:03:09] so we're here we want to look at it and
[1:03:11] just kind of paraphrase it until we get
[1:03:13] to our point when brother Brandon was
[1:03:15] working that there the end time
[1:03:17] evangelist so we don't have to unusual
[1:03:21] then you'll see why your pastor is being
[1:03:23] anointed by the Holy Spirit to minister
[1:03:26] what he's ministering in this end time
[1:03:29] you know because you were building
[1:03:31] something God's Building something God's
[1:03:33] moving us somewhere we know that time is
[1:03:36] winding up is that right time is closer
[1:03:39] than it's ever been you know the last
[1:03:42] time I was here I was telling you that
[1:03:44] that we know that the pope is running
[1:03:46] the show we know we got seven out of
[1:03:49] nine of our Supreme Court Justices
[1:03:51] Catholics we know that by him is
[1:03:53] Catholic we know the Nancy's Catholic
[1:03:55] now they're over there now and they're
[1:03:58] getting ready to change the Ten
[1:04:00] Commandments the meaning over there in
[1:04:03] Egypt and so you have to understand on
[1:04:07] the same Mountain where Moses was that's
[1:04:10] where they're meeting at and then I
[1:04:12] think the last day is on the 18th so
[1:04:15] what they're bringing in is one world
[1:04:17] religion so that's why we're sharing
[1:04:19] with you that's why you'll see you're
[1:04:21] getting the word don't be complaining
[1:04:23] about you know I heard brother Brandon
[1:04:25] said a person that don't have the Holy
[1:04:27] Ghost they can't sit up in the house of
[1:04:29] the Lord for 15 minutes he said that
[1:04:32] somebody that got the Holy Ghost they
[1:04:34] can sit there for day and night and
[1:04:36] listen to the world
[1:04:38] you say they recognize the presence of
[1:04:41] the of the Lord they recognize the time
[1:04:43] that they're living in they recognize
[1:04:45] that God only divine revelation is here
[1:04:48] this is not now God has given you
[1:04:51] Revelation about what that picture is
[1:04:53] that right God is that right we
[1:04:56] understand it's the man of God but it's
[1:04:58] God that chose him to be in that picture
[1:05:01] that means god is identifying him that
[1:05:05] he's Malachi for Luke 17 30. Revelations
[1:05:09] 10 7 He's My Messenger that I'm sending
[1:05:12] for laodicea
[1:05:16] hello Hallelujah
[1:05:19] it's a war going on
[1:05:21] a religious War
[1:05:22] he said many come in my name when we're
[1:05:25] in that institution you fighting them
[1:05:27] religious demons you better know your
[1:05:29] Bible and the only thing they can't
[1:05:30] touch because they don't have a message
[1:05:31] at the hour and when that religious
[1:05:34] demon you're coming in you let them know
[1:05:36] playing in simple that I didn't come in
[1:05:39] here for that I didn't come in here
[1:05:40] preaching the same gospel I come in here
[1:05:43] with a message from the almighty God I'm
[1:05:46] looking for that last seed I'm ready to
[1:05:48] go home it's a rejoicing time I see the
[1:05:51] time is there some might be in the
[1:05:53] hospital he said when I was sick you
[1:05:56] visited me when I was hungry you fed me
[1:05:59] when I need cold you clothing me when I
[1:06:02] was in jail with prison you visited me
[1:06:04] so I know he's not sending me in there
[1:06:07] his work is not invading them so we
[1:06:09] coming in we bring in the word of God we
[1:06:12] let them know quickly our mission my
[1:06:15] mission is to get you ready to meet him
[1:06:18] in the air
[1:06:24] religion versus salvation
[1:06:27] it's a real war
[1:06:29] the only reason things which you bear
[1:06:31] bear with me I know his son I mean I
[1:06:33] know it's uh Wednesday got a timer but
[1:06:36] just bear with me the next messenger
[1:06:38] the property God was talking about was
[1:06:40] Noah
[1:06:42] and when Noah came on she didn't know I
[1:06:44] had a Time
[1:06:46] he's in a very scientific time yes
[1:06:49] yes but he was the messenger that was
[1:06:51] sent for that age
[1:06:52] and he was the message that was sent for
[1:06:55] that age the messenger always come at
[1:06:57] the end of the day
[1:06:59] and so when you come at that end of the
[1:07:01] age God give him a thus say the Lord
[1:07:04] and it does say to the Lord he had to
[1:07:06] bring you what Minister that Ark his
[1:07:08] message was to do what build that Ark he
[1:07:12] had to build that Ark he preached that
[1:07:14] gospel to him and when he preached that
[1:07:16] gossip he had to be mocked
[1:07:19] was there Same Spirit that was dead
[1:07:23] people die but Spirits don't die
[1:07:26] and when they got over there and they
[1:07:27] come into the Scarface was dead but then
[1:07:30] finally it got to a point it was time
[1:07:32] for another dispensational change and
[1:07:35] when the dispensational change had to
[1:07:37] come nobody wasn't Noah at that time now
[1:07:40] it was time to go into the ark
[1:07:44] if you're going there and read it
[1:07:45] brother Brandon said now Noah had to be
[1:07:48] tried his faith had to be tested he had
[1:07:52] to trust in the same word that he was
[1:07:54] preaching all right
[1:07:56] he had to touch the same thing and so
[1:07:59] now it's coming down to our time but we
[1:08:02] got around in there when Noah got there
[1:08:04] I'm sure he took what a lot of stack for
[1:08:07] maybe his children at the time because
[1:08:10] he said when God told him to go in there

[1:12:42] loved ones under the altar he keep
[1:12:44] bringing you worse situations to you

[1:13:13] waiting to go home the prophecy is being
[1:13:16] fulfilled right in front of our eyes
[1:13:20] go in there pull it up there oh Paul be
[1:13:22] sitting around in there all them
[1:13:24] religious leaders come by the pope go
[1:13:25] pull it up some of you don't have it
[1:13:27] I'll send it to you they're sitting
[1:13:28] there they know what they're doing
[1:13:29] they're trying to tell them it's Global
[1:13:31] uh uh Global uh era or they want
[1:13:34] the global to watch over the global
[1:13:36] atmosphere
[1:13:38] hmm lying out of the pitch of hell now
[1:13:41] they're moving into one world religion
[1:13:45] we know what it's we know what it's
[1:13:47] doing
[1:13:48] let me keep going help me Lord he said
[1:13:51] you think you're still right well that's
[1:13:53] the way the devil does all of us
[1:13:56] but as long as God said so stay with it
[1:14:01] huh
[1:14:02] that don't matter what what they say
[1:14:05] right stay right with it huh
[1:14:10] no we got around near Noah we thank the
[1:14:14] Lord for no but we know Noah message
[1:14:16] can't save us so we get around there
[1:14:18] right who's the next one we got Moses is
[1:14:21] that right he talked about Moses and
[1:14:24] Moses down there Moses he was giving the
[1:14:26] message he had to bring to deliver to
[1:14:28] bring him up out of Egypt but Moses
[1:14:30] mission was to what it was the laws that
[1:14:32] right Moses was given the law when you
[1:14:35] go over there brother Brown said that's
[1:14:37] the worst thing they did they rejected
[1:14:38] the aggression took the law that's what
[1:14:41] held Israel up we got to understand now
[1:14:44] this is not legalistic this is not
[1:14:46] capitalistic why because God showed us
[1:14:48] the way out is that life God's brought a
[1:14:51] word by The Throne of God from divine
[1:14:54] revelation so when you go out there now
[1:14:56] that on these religious demons and they
[1:14:58] try to come with you with that calvinist
[1:15:00] when they come into your wedding
[1:15:01] Luther's time it went too far to the
[1:15:03] left is that right the faith of whether
[1:15:06] the just to live by faith is that right
[1:15:09] yeah but they was making God's face
[1:15:11] God's grace of Faith a disgrace that's
[1:15:14] exactly what they were doing and saying
[1:15:17] they reserve the message of the hour and
[1:15:19] you're living that kind of life is that
[1:15:21] right then they came Wesley when they
[1:15:23] came to Wesley he got away they were
[1:15:25] armenius is that right they went too far
[1:15:27] to the right but God rich in Mercy came
[1:15:31] and brought us a word and showed us how
[1:15:34] to rightfully divide the word of grace
[1:15:36] to the people so those that were
[1:15:38] struggling those with the religious
[1:15:40] demons he even told your parents when
[1:15:43] they sat upon it as certain Ministries
[1:15:45] that they didn't mean no harm they was
[1:15:47] falling away that was all offered to
[1:15:49] them at that time but the hand of Grace
[1:15:52] has now been extended to you why because
[1:15:55] the truth is that right the truth that
[1:15:57] they're made known to us and it's our
[1:15:59] here now only thing that set you freeze
[1:16:02] the truth is that right we got the truth
[1:16:04] we got the True Stone Mason is that
[1:16:07] right
[1:16:09] Moses Moses had to come with the law and
[1:16:12] the law wasn't going to get him out of
[1:16:14] it either is that right and then after
[1:16:16] Moses who came after Moses he's talking
[1:16:19] about John is that right John had to
[1:16:21] introduce John had to come and introduce
[1:16:24] Christ is that right
[1:16:28] you constantly help me Lord
[1:16:30] he said now look
[1:16:36] paragraph 1997 out of the same message
[1:16:39] he says then he says then after Moses
[1:16:42] come John he says and after John the
[1:16:44] dispensation come see the dispensation
[1:16:47] of change
[1:16:55] is that right he said now he says and
[1:17:00] then at the Moses he says then when
[1:17:01] Jesus come to try to bring us Grace
[1:17:04] which was God in the spirit in the line
[1:17:07] of spirit
[1:17:08] manifested his love for God so loved the
[1:17:12] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:17:15] and Jesus was so different and contrary
[1:17:17] to the what law that right but it was a
[1:17:21] different dispensation
[1:17:24] so what do you have to understand in his
[1:17:27] time here now God is bringing us a word
[1:17:30] a word of Grace if you don't see the
[1:17:33] grace in this message you can't you
[1:17:35] can't look at yourself we're going to
[1:17:37] get to those stones in a minute and
[1:17:39] we're going to show you why the holy
[1:17:41] spirit is chipping away is that right
[1:17:43] let's look at what the definition what
[1:17:46] excuse me what that stone is it said a
[1:17:49] stonemason a person who cuts prepares
[1:17:53] and builds with stones okay
[1:17:56] what is he building we'll show you what
[1:17:58] he's building when I keep reading he
[1:18:00] said now you look
[1:18:02] he says in his timing now they've always
[1:18:05] had that religion we're talking about
[1:18:07] God was the first messenger Noah was the
[1:18:10] next messenger Moses was the next
[1:18:12] message John brought the next message
[1:18:14] Jesus came with Grace
[1:18:16] now we turn around here you got to
[1:18:18] understand someone always wants to lean
[1:18:21] to their own understanding right
[1:18:24] is that right at the end of the
[1:18:26] Louisiana time after the flood here come
[1:18:29] who Nimrod is that right Nimrod coming
[1:18:32] in nevermind God has an order they're
[1:18:34] saying that we was going to do what
[1:18:36] build the Tower the Bible is next time
[1:18:39] if the flood come we'll make a way out
[1:18:41] all right God already told me what I'm
[1:18:44] going to do bring a flood next time you
[1:18:46] see how people lean to their own
[1:18:48] understanding excuse me people coming in
[1:18:51] here instead of following the message of
[1:18:53] the hour instead of following the way
[1:18:55] you know they run here they run there
[1:18:57] you know what they try to find a system
[1:19:00] and that fit with the how they want to
[1:19:02] worship they want to live what they want
[1:19:04] to work that's a religious demon you got
[1:19:07] nothing but a religious demon on you and
[1:19:09] you need to ask God to help you because
[1:19:12] when God is bringing you Grace when God
[1:19:14] is bringing you Grace to mold you and
[1:19:16] shape you into into his character what
[1:19:20] we're looking at now after when Jesus
[1:19:22] came when Jesus came to was totally then
[1:19:25] misunderstood why because when he
[1:19:27] preached that Beatitudes is that right
[1:19:29] when he went up there to the mountains
[1:19:31] the Bible said his disciples his
[1:19:33] disciples came and they sat down among
[1:19:36] him and when they sat there with him
[1:19:38] they said he preached he taught them is
[1:19:40] that right he taught them a new
[1:19:42] dispensational change was coming now in
[1:19:45] the dispensational change is coming love
[1:19:47] your enemy he'll go through them that
[1:19:49] that despise you pray for them that
[1:19:52] those that do wrong for you that's what
[1:19:54] he was telling us to do not gossip not
[1:19:57] beat him down not not cut them off he
[1:20:01] said lie he said blessed is the pure at
[1:20:03] heart for they shall what see God now
[1:20:06] come on
[1:20:07] amen dispensational change we're talking
[1:20:11] about the word we're talking about the
[1:20:14] resurrected word we're talking about in
[1:20:16] this hour here now you're being molded
[1:20:18] and you're being shaped and what
[1:20:21] let me keep going help me Lord
[1:20:24] he's saying now look he was giving
[1:20:27] instructions he said now at that time
[1:20:30] after that dispensation of change and
[1:20:33] then brother Brandon was talking about
[1:20:35] it he was saying now let's look at the
[1:20:38] real end time evangelism
[1:20:41] what an evangelism really is doing in
[1:20:43] the end time for his pride for his
[1:20:46] people
[1:20:49] help me Lord
[1:20:52] look
[1:20:57] let's turn the Psalms I tell you first
[1:20:58] psalm 127.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah
[1:21:05] we're looking at here if God if God
[1:21:08] can't do it then it won't be done
[1:21:12] can't do it it won't be done
[1:21:16] see why
[1:21:18] the pastor you see who you'll see why
[1:21:20] something just got
[1:21:22] the knowledge
[1:21:23] of the picture
[1:21:25] some just got the knowledge of the
[1:21:28] picture
[1:21:30] some just had
[1:21:31] the knowledge of the picture
[1:21:34] but we'll see what God is building what
[1:21:36] he's showing us these things
[1:21:40] amen he said now you look Psalms 127 he
[1:21:44] says he said now what he said except who
[1:21:47] the Lord build the house
[1:21:50] he said they laboring what and they that
[1:21:54] build it except the Lord keep the what
[1:21:56] city The Watchman walk is what in vain
[1:21:59] so if God is doing this here it's God
[1:22:03] when he says the boss told me to go this
[1:22:05] way and the boss told me to go that way
[1:22:07] he'd been warning you and telling you
[1:22:09] you're in the war is that right he said
[1:22:12] the plane maneuver this way the flame
[1:22:14] maneuver that way is that right so what
[1:22:16] they're going to do he's going to come
[1:22:18] and he's going to attack in all areas
[1:22:20] now because he's trying to keep up with
[1:22:22] us he's trying to keep up with what the
[1:22:24] holy spirit is leading the head with so
[1:22:27] he's trying to attack the shepherd but
[1:22:29] he can't attack the shepherd because the
[1:22:31] holy spirit is leading them is that
[1:22:32] right he's leading and guiding Us in all
[1:22:35] truth he said the footsteps of the
[1:22:37] righteous is ordered of the Lord so with
[1:22:40] God unless God building that house is
[1:22:42] going to be built in vain they're not
[1:22:44] going to be mountains to anything he
[1:22:46] said who do some say that I am when he
[1:22:49] got there is that right bill building
[1:22:50] the church he said who do men say that I
[1:22:53] am some say you Elijah some say you
[1:22:55] Jeremiah some say you wanted a prophets
[1:22:58] some say you John the Baptist he said
[1:23:00] who did I say that I am thou are what
[1:23:03] the Christ you are the Christ the son of
[1:23:06] the Living God he said Peter Flesh and
[1:23:09] Blood this has not been revealed to you
[1:23:11] if somebody come ask you in that
[1:23:13] religious war and they try to come and
[1:23:15] give you a Trinity there's no such thing
[1:23:18] as a trinity just three offices there's
[1:23:20] the Father the Son the holy spirit is
[1:23:23] three title officers is that right this
[1:23:26] is one of the religious demons you're
[1:23:27] going to face son I face it all the time
[1:23:30] so you got to understand first John
[1:23:32] seven and five you got to bring them to
[1:23:35] that take them to the word is that right
[1:23:37] the word of God is sharper than in a
[1:23:39] two-edged sword when you take them to
[1:23:41] the word of God then in first John 5 and
[1:23:44] 7 he said the word the Father the spirit
[1:23:47] is what one is that right that's why you
[1:23:50] get around in it he said the blood and
[1:23:52] the water and the spirit is what
[1:23:55] agreeing one is that right that's why
[1:23:58] when the Holy Spirit now has given us a
[1:24:01] true Revelation a true Revelation so you
[1:24:04] don't have to to just agree in one the
[1:24:07] Lord told us you could be justified is
[1:24:09] that right and not Sanctified he even
[1:24:12] told the Lord not the fact the Lord told
[1:24:15] you look to examine yourself when he
[1:24:18] said to see if you truly Justified if
[1:24:21] you've got the revelation of
[1:24:23] justification justification get away
[1:24:25] with the law is that right now it came
[1:24:28] with Grace but the justification that
[1:24:31] they the way they were preaching it
[1:24:32] through the message it was nothing
[1:24:34] different than denominations is that
[1:24:37] right now God gave us the Revelation it
[1:24:40] took away all of our offenses in all of
[1:24:43] our officials was taken away that's why
[1:24:45] the prophet that God can say you never
[1:24:47] done it
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:56] what you afraid
[1:24:59] to be afraid God didn't give us the
[1:25:01] spirit of fear but love peace joy and a
[1:25:05] sound mind
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:07] God say you're healed you're healed
[1:25:10] your conditions had nothing to do with
[1:25:12] your feelings stick with the word of God
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:18] justify
[1:25:19] we've been justified by the Justified he
[1:25:23] told us the reason why you don't
[1:25:24] understand him because you never cut the
[1:25:26] revelation of the Brazen altar yeah you
[1:25:30] never caught the Revelation if you catch
[1:25:32] the revelation of the Brazen altar then
[1:25:35] you're recognized and that Brazen altar
[1:25:37] all you see is the cross
[1:25:39] all you see is the sacrifice huh all you
[1:25:42] see is The Blood Brother the blood all
[1:25:46] the blood the blood don't sign my name
[1:25:49] huh at the cross at the cross where I
[1:25:52] first saw the light and the burdens of
[1:25:54] my heart rolled away it was dead by
[1:25:57] faith I received my sight now I'm happy
[1:25:59] all today huh
[1:26:01] [Applause]
[1:26:05] in the Old Testament he got around in
[1:26:08] and light up it says you're you're mean
[1:26:11] what light is that right huh throwing me
[1:26:14] Perfection is that right and urine is
[1:26:17] the first letter of the Hebrew right and
[1:26:20] Thurman is the last letter of the Hebrew
[1:26:22] alphabet Jesus Christ the same the first
[1:26:26] and the last ah
[1:26:31] twice back on the scene again in times
[1:26:35] past God spoke through the prophets of
[1:26:38] God is that right he spoke to them now
[1:26:41] and this times
[1:26:44] all this time God himself now speak
[1:26:49] through Jesus Christ yeah the prophet is
[1:26:53] that right now God himself becomes the
[1:26:57] prophet is that right

[1:39:23] ladder right John 151 tells you that
[1:39:26] that it was Christ coming down opening

[1:39:48] right the Pentecostal but then he had to
[1:39:51] come by to the Covenant angel of
[1:39:53] Revelations 10 1 7. then Revelation 19
[1:39:57] Luke 17 30 that scripture had to be

[1:49:07] talking to the religious man and the
[1:49:10] religious man rejected the way of

[1:53:18] okay you need to get settled in your
[1:53:20] spirit your spirit's not settled that's
[1:53:22] why the Lord was bringing us about that
[1:53:23] Tabernacle every time you've seen me
[1:53:25] flesh that Tabernacle why because that
[1:53:27] was the master plan of the Plan of
[1:53:29] Redemption Moses saw the Plan of
[1:53:31] Redemption the Lord who rich in Mercy he
[1:53:34] showed you the entrance of that door
[1:53:36] that door is Christ son and then after
[1:53:38] you come to Christ so then you go to the
[1:53:40] what the Brazen Altar and then after you
[1:53:42] go to praise and altar how do you go to
[1:53:44] the praise and altar a Godless sorrow
[1:53:46] bring a Godly repentance that you don't
[1:53:49] have to repent to know more and after
[1:53:51] you go to that Brazen altar now why
[1:53:53] because you've seen a word a word LED
[1:53:56] you there where'd it say Brother Sam
[1:53:58] you're being led by what faith is that
[1:54:00] right the faith of God is leading you
[1:54:03] through that then after you leave there
[1:54:04] to tell you once you see it you got to
[1:54:06] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ for every mission of the sins you
[1:54:11] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:13] then you move into what the labor is
[1:54:15] that right you got to go to the labor
[1:54:17] and get a white stuff you've been
[1:54:18] Justified you've been Sanctified and he
[1:54:21] said you're getting the holy place what
[1:54:23] did he type the holy place we type the
[1:54:25] holy place for being free more will is
[1:54:27] that right now one of those Avenues the
[1:54:30] devil will attack you is either a memory
[1:54:32] imagination conscience and affection one
[1:54:35] of those things the devil attack you in
[1:54:37] you got the god that wise that's why so

[1:54:42] because they were taught just receiving
[1:54:44] the word no sensation well you gotta
[1:54:47] understand now and God God has brought
[1:54:49] what the opening of the seals and bring
[1:54:52] us to thunder you can't move into the

[2:06:54] cover thee with my hand while I pass by
[2:06:58] he said now look let's drop down here in
[2:07:00] verse 34 for the sake of time
[2:07:03] he said now verse 5. now he gets his new
[2:07:07] vision from God
[2:07:09] if you go back and read in Moses prayer
[2:07:11] over there in 33 Moses went to God Moses
[2:07:15] got his grace from God Moses knew he was
[2:07:17] he was in the hand of God and when Moses
[2:07:20] got in the hand of God Moses never
[2:07:23] stopped moving in his position Moses
[2:07:26] moved in this position and he stood in
[2:07:27] the gap for who for God's people is that
[2:07:30] right Moses stood in the gas that's what
[2:07:33] your Shepherd did he stands in the gap
[2:07:35] for many days many nights sometimes you
[2:07:38] don't understand it but it'd be
[2:07:39] Supernatural God strengthened his body
[2:07:41] to keep going what he needed to do
[2:07:43] because he realizes God called you if
[2:07:46] God called you God chose you God
[2:07:49] appoints you God will anoint you right
[2:07:52] so we're going in there look what he
[2:07:54] said he said and the Lord descended into
[2:07:56] what
[2:08:01] ah
[2:08:04] I don't have the market but I can move
[2:08:05] the boy
[2:08:08] ah

[2:08:13] look what was under those seals look
[2:08:15] what those Thunders is getting we're
[2:08:17] supposed to produce let me keep going
[2:08:20] he says in the Lord descended in the
[2:08:22] cloud
[2:08:23] and stood with him there and proclaimed
[2:08:25] the what the name of the Lord and the
[2:08:27] Lord passed by before him and proclaimed
[2:08:29] the Lord the Lord God look at this
[2:08:32] characteristic I like
[2:08:35] ignore God merciful yes gracious
[2:08:38] long-suffering
[2:08:40] and abundant in goodness and Truth
[2:08:45] keeping Mercy for thousands for giving
[2:08:48] iniquity transgression and sin and that
[2:08:51] will by no means clear the guilty
[2:08:54] visiting the iniquity of the father upon
[2:08:57] the children upon the children's
[2:08:58] children unto the third and to the
[2:09:01] fourth generation and what do they do
[2:09:03] we're talking about when that cloud came
[2:09:06] down
[2:09:07] when that seals came open

[2:09:12] said what he said Thunders is what a

[2:11:47] versus a religious one
[2:11:51] amen
[2:11:53] Glory Glory Glory to God I'm going to
[2:11:56] finish my scripture again
[2:11:58] the Bible says when I was a child
[2:12:02] I speak as a child
[2:12:04] I understood as a child
[2:12:07] I thought as a child
[2:12:09] but why
[2:12:11] when I became a man
[2:12:14] I put away
[2:12:16] childish things amen
[2:12:19] Deliverance is not a big problem
[2:12:22] the Deliverance of God is usually very
[2:12:25] simple
[2:12:27] but we are brought up with a Pentecostal
[2:12:30] ways where we need to work
[2:12:33] we need to fast 10 days
[2:12:36] we need to watch and we need to do this
[2:12:39] we need to do this and then when you
[2:12:41] come up from there you're feeling like
[2:12:43] you did something to earn
[2:12:46] what you were asking God for
[2:12:49] you like I did this I did this that's
[2:12:52] why I got the result
[2:12:53] amen amen God is not complicated
[2:12:58] no one time Israel sin
[2:13:01] and when Israel sinned they did
[2:13:04] something that was pretty bad
[2:13:06] and Moses intervened before God
[2:13:10] and God told him go ahead and make the
[2:13:12] Brazen
[2:13:14] serpent
[2:13:15] and he put it there did they tell the
[2:13:18] Israel too fast
[2:13:20] they taught Israel to pray
[2:13:23] they told Israel to go to church
[2:13:26] all of these things are good they just
[2:13:29] taught Israel at that time just look
[2:13:33] amen don't do anything else just look
[2:13:37] what is the problem with looking
[2:13:42] amen a mother of life and death
[2:13:47] amen was laying on the look
[2:13:52] if you don't want to look you die
[2:13:54] if you look you are healed and you are
[2:13:57] saved what is complicated
[2:14:01] there is nothing too big for the Lord
[2:14:05] amen when God unfolded nobody knew there
[2:14:09] was a power in the present servant until
[2:14:12] God opened that Revelation he was a new
[2:14:15] revelation that was not there yet God
[2:14:18] opened it and he unfolded and when he
[2:14:22] unfolded there was life right there you
[2:14:25] jump quickly right there you get your
[2:14:27] healing and you keep moving it's like
[2:14:30] the pool of Bethesda when the angel move
[2:14:32] on just jump right there you get your
[2:14:34] healing and you move on when you get
[2:14:36] healed from what was stopping you on the
[2:14:39] pull of Bethesda you're not gonna come
[2:14:41] back again you need now to go back to
[2:14:43] your home and then move on with the Lord
[2:14:45] into different Avenues that's the way we
[2:14:48] grow up into the Lord amen
[2:14:51] amen that's the way we grow up into the
[2:14:52] Lord when they just say love your wife
[2:14:55] husband we spoke about it on Sunday we
[2:14:57] we we explain it down and break it down
[2:15:01] if you just do what God is asking you to
[2:15:04] do
[2:15:05] automatically there is no ground for
[2:15:08] that devil to stay there
[2:15:10] amen he will try to show you like he's
[2:15:13] not going but he's already going because
[2:15:16] you have obeyed God that's as simple as
[2:15:19] it is amen amen if you wife you put
[2:15:22] yourself back in your position
[2:15:24] automatically what is God doing with the
[2:15:27] blessings he have
[2:15:28] do you think God need a chair
[2:15:32] do you think God need a house
[2:15:35] the Bible say everything belongs to him
[2:15:37] you're the one that are looking for
[2:15:39] church amen you're the one that looked
[2:15:41] for your house you're the one looking
[2:15:42] for healing he wanted to give you what
[2:15:44] you want to get amen but he's asking you
[2:15:47] to do something very simple we get just
[2:15:50] taught I mean twisted and and
[2:15:53] complicated just because we don't want
[2:15:56] to give away something that is very
[2:15:58] simple
[2:16:00] amen we have other things that we put
[2:16:03] before
[2:16:07] and you wonder why God is not doing this
[2:16:11] how can God give you a husband in the
[2:16:13] state you are
[2:16:16] you going to torment him
[2:16:21] you wanna you go ahead you do it and you
[2:16:24] fix it in the marriage you see how hard
[2:16:25] it is
[2:16:27] why do you want God to give your wife in
[2:16:30] a statuary
[2:16:32] why do you want God to bless you with
[2:16:35] money in the way you are you can't even
[2:16:37] come to church
[2:16:39] so if they give you more money are you
[2:16:40] going to come to church forget it you're
[2:16:42] gone because your Prosperity is what
[2:16:45] what is attaching you to God yeah I will
[2:16:48] begin to come to church when everything
[2:16:50] begin to work good
[2:16:54] amen amen that's not gonna work
[2:16:57] give him preeminence amen
[2:17:00] and he will let you go through trial and
[2:17:03] as Aston Mason he's cutting whatever
[2:17:05] need to be kind of your life little by
[2:17:08] little little by little when he sees fit
[2:17:12] that this is the time that she reached
[2:17:15] the level that I want her to meet
[2:17:18] you will be surprised what God can do
[2:17:21] and you will regret why you didn't give
[2:17:25] him the preeminence all along in other
[2:17:29] words you were the one blocking God from
[2:17:31] blessing you because of what you're
[2:17:34] trying to achieve
[2:17:36] amen amen amen when we serve the Lord
[2:17:40] sometime he appears like we don't have
[2:17:42] life
[2:17:45] sometimes it's appearing like we don't
[2:17:47] have fun the other people are having fun
[2:17:49] the way they want just being in the
[2:17:51] church all the time being in the
[2:17:53] question and answering all the time we
[2:17:55] don't go out doing something you will
[2:17:57] realize one time that those people are
[2:18:00] more peaceful at home than the one
[2:18:02] you're thinking are having fun
[2:18:04] you don't talk to people I talk to
[2:18:07] people I see the woman on the wheelchair
[2:18:09] the heavy set woman on the wheelchair

[2:18:27] are to even just go home and sleep
[2:18:29] without taking a pill you don't know how
[2:18:32] many people are taking pills just to get
[2:18:35] some sleep
[2:18:37] but they're driving beautiful car more
[2:18:39] than you
[2:18:40] they're running big offices more than
[2:18:42] you and you're looking at them on the
[2:18:45] outside thinking they are good while
[2:18:48] they're struggling they're looking like
[2:18:50] if I can get this
[2:18:51] [Music]

[2:19:16] can do it's in the last stage there is
[2:19:18] nothing money can do with
[2:19:21] all God is asking you is simple God is
[2:19:24] wanting to heal a home
[2:19:27] heal our families heal our life

[2:19:50] years for 35 years and you're still good
[2:19:53] and God want to flip it and change it to
[2:19:55] give you a hope
[2:19:58] the plan that he had for us is to give
[2:20:00] us a hope so that you can go home and
[2:20:03] sit down you say finally I understand
[2:20:05] you see the home peacefully you're not
[2:20:08] under stress
[2:20:11] amen amen that's what God wanted to do

[2:20:26] business get here our whatever we have
[2:20:29] every aspect of our life we wanted to

[2:20:38] prosperity of your soul the Bible say I
[2:20:40] want you to prosper as your soul Prosper
[2:20:43] your soul is not prospering but you want
[2:20:46] to prosper and if you happen it's a
[2:20:49] Dangerous Ground yeah

[2:20:53] Jesus Christ he prospered he ended up in
[2:20:55] hell
[2:20:57] amen
[2:20:59] God is molding us so you can eat your
[2:21:02] food and enjoy the food whether it's a
[2:21:05] restaurant whether it's a McDonald but

[2:21:27] pretending being spiritual some are
[2:21:29] pretending that they move on to a big
[2:21:31] life all of that are pretense you sit
[2:21:34] with them people are depressed
[2:21:37] the world is insane the way people are
[2:21:39] thinking now is insane just to be able
[2:21:42] to think the way you think it's a
[2:21:44] blessing
[2:21:47] amen amen just to be able to think the
[2:21:51] way you're thinking it's a blessing amen
[2:21:53] amen there was somebody that knocked his
[2:21:56] car
[2:21:57] he went to the judge they just said yes
[2:21:59] you can prosecute but I'm telling you if
[2:22:01] you prosecute those people can come back
[2:22:03] after you now if if a judge telling you
[2:22:06] that what are you going to do
[2:22:11] huh
[2:22:12] somebody taking a woman rape her they
[2:22:15] put him in the barn and after the bond
[2:22:17] they take the bond they lower that and
[2:22:19] they put the men back again he's going
[2:22:20] to go back on the street
[2:22:22] and there are many of them like that on
[2:22:24] the street many of them like that
[2:22:27] they were supposed to stay locked up
[2:22:28] they out
[2:22:30] who are you dealing with
[2:22:34] everybody okay God
[2:22:36] simple is trying to mold you whatever he
[2:22:39] tells you is simple look at the brains
[2:22:43] and alter just look
[2:22:46] just look and you'll see if you're not
[2:22:48] gonna get healed
[2:22:50] don't sit down and say no what is
[2:22:53] looking going to do with a wound
[2:22:56] so you think if I'm just looking at that
[2:22:58] thing my wound will go away that's the
[2:23:00] problem
[2:23:01] that's why your men got shot
[2:23:04] because when they brought him the pardon
[2:23:06] he said he said no no the pardon cannot
[2:23:08] come like this
[2:23:10] you must have an official stamp of the
[2:23:12] United States it must be this way it
[2:23:14] must be this way that's why many people
[2:23:16] misses God because they want God to mold
[2:23:20] himself in their program and to come the
[2:23:23] way they want it to come that's why the
[2:23:25] Pharisee missed God and the woman at the
[2:23:27] world will all must Miss God because God
[2:23:31] used a Jewish flesh
[2:23:34] amen
[2:23:36] I must have missed God for that
[2:23:39] because she wanted a Samaritan to bring
[2:23:42] the gospel then he will actually then

[2:23:45] almost Miss God Amen

[2:26:11] I know I know I need to put my life
[2:26:13] right with God and you wonder praise the
[2:26:16] Lord how did you know about here because
[2:26:18] you just position yourself and God take

[2:26:23] don't fight you fought too much it's a
[2:26:26] lot of work
[2:26:27] take your hand off relax
[2:26:31] life is good with Jesus Christ
[2:26:34] even our trial gets sweeter
[2:26:37] because he would not try you above your
[2:26:39] means
[2:26:40] if I tell you what I go through you will
[2:26:42] say no there's no way you can go through
[2:26:44] something like that but he knows my
[2:26:46] level and he put it according to my
[2:26:49] level he knows your because so don't
[2:26:51] think yours is the end of the world no

[2:26:57] let's pray Heavenly Father
[2:26:59] Lord we are
[2:27:01] thanking you again once again
[2:27:03] father for coming tonight and speaking
[2:27:06] to our soul
[2:27:07] and expressing yourself
[2:27:10] to be the Lord
[2:27:12] that is building the house
[2:27:15] and father just to have the thought that
[2:27:18] you are the one building the house
[2:27:21] makes a difference
[2:27:23] it finishes everything
[2:27:25] because we know that when you you are
[2:27:28] building it means that you are the alpha
[2:27:32] and not only are you going to be the
[2:27:33] alpha
[2:27:35] of the building of that building father
[2:27:38] but you're going to be also the Omega
[2:27:41] in other words everything that you do is
[2:27:44] always right
[2:27:46] and if we have been built by you
[2:27:50] what kind of people are the way to be
[2:27:52] father
[2:27:53] and what kind of privilege to have the
[2:27:55] almighty God
[2:27:57] father expressing his interest in our
[2:28:00] own life and the details of our life
[2:28:04] until a minister can stand here and
[2:28:07] speak and we know exactly that that
[2:28:09] Minister didn't know what I was going
[2:28:11] through that must be God
[2:28:13] it is showing to us
[2:28:16] that you are more present with us than
[2:28:19] we can realize
[2:28:22] father may we be caught up into that
[2:28:24] vision
[2:28:25] into the Revelation into that
[2:28:28] understanding
[2:28:29] to no Lord father that you are calling
[2:28:32] people for a different work now
[2:28:35] you want to walk with your brother
[2:28:37] you want to express yourself through
[2:28:40] that bread
[2:28:41] you want to show that Brad that whatever
[2:28:43] you heard all over the year
[2:28:45] now the time has come
[2:28:48] that you will see exactly what I was
[2:28:50] trying to say
[2:28:52] father May nobody misses it
[2:28:55] may we forget about the trial and the
[2:28:57] destruction that the devil is trying to
[2:28:59] bring
[2:29:00] but may we if we focus again our life
[2:29:03] knowing like that you are the author and
[2:29:07] you are the finisher of our faith if you
[2:29:09] started this church
