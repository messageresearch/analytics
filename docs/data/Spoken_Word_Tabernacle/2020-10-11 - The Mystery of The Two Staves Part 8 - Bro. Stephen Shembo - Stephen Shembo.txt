to receive an upper room experience this morning with the cloven tongues of fire and the Russian Mighty Wind amen so let's just ask someone [Music] a pen we we were introducing two new songs on Wednesday night and let's ask that we do it again even as a prophet was saying you know you were saying this morning if you're a dog you can be a human in other words we don't make ourselves what we are we are what we are by God's grace aiming and identifying ourselves in the world is is what we are where we are right now amen that's what our Authority is so we want to sing this song Where Eagles

Hallelujah bless the Lord Hallelujah amen amen this is your position in God's word fly with only Eagles could amen praise God Amen the other song you know as brother the Lord has been really opening up to us so many things in the Book of Esther but um what really stands out to me is um the Jewish enemy Naman or Haman rather um even when he realized that he was defeated he still you know he was still coming and holding on to Esther's couch and um it just goes to show that the enemy with that we are dealing with is is very persistent you know he doesn't just um see the timer it says time for me to go I better go and he's not that kind of person you know he'll want to hold on to the last minute so our last enemy is going to be cast out amen in Book of Revelation chapter 12 we see where that woman that was travailing to bring forth and when she brought for that man child she was a great Wonder in heaven but there was another Wonder in heaven too that was a dragon so what is he doing up there when the man child was born and taken up to the throne that's when he was cast down amen The Last Enemy is death and he is riding right now so we have work to do Believers that's what this song is about we're not going to ask him till if you're going to kick him down amen hallelujah [Music] arise come come let's hold to his unchanging hand praise the Lord praise His name and because at the Devil shake your confidence off in your heart don't you hate your brother that's the root of bitterness we've got to walk away a Holiness of Holiness and we're gonna kick him down kick him down

home I'm not rebuking anybody online if you have a legitimate reason that's fun praise God but if you stay before because of the rain May the Lord help you next time amen even though he ran outside that's not our problem amen [Music] yeah when we will go back to the mystery of three Heaven you will see how it is there were three lights in the Tabernacle amen the Tabernacle have three parts [Music] and those three parts also show the position of the believer in Christ amen the outer Court was exposed to the light of the Sun wheat is the light of the zodiac everybody okay the inner Court have the light of the candlestick are you there and the that was the holy of the Holy place and the holy of the holiest which is actually the in court have the pillar of fire here are you there and if you take the message the inner Veil and all those kind of messages brother Brandon preach brother Branham explained that on the outer court right here if it rain if it's gloomy here you are also grooming are you there if it rained here you also under the influence of the rain everybody clear but a Christian who live here or especially here where there is rain here or not whether it's gloomy on the outside or not that Christian is still in the presence of the Living God so the weather does not influence him amen accept it's an extreme dangerous weather we I understand it but God gives you a special blessing for being here this morning I was on the road I drove as well but you've been here it is a special blessing God richly bless you I spoke to brother Maurice before coming here it is doing a lot better by the Maurice Junior I heard the prayer prayer request here but he's doing a lot better by God's grace I told him I'm gonna check him up again after service sister Jean was in the hospital the doctor was were pushing for transplant she was not really convinced about it because since she got into the hospital she got better her heart good her lungs clear she's breathing okay she was able to walk and finally she decided to go home so she's home but God's grace is doing better amen I was with her yesterday and we were trying to find another doctor just trying to switch things because sometimes you know what happened in the health care but she's doing better I was with her last night we spent some time with her and her husband we prayed and she's doing wonderful and by the grace of God I believe she's online if you dare sister Jean you can say amen and Brother David will tell me let's go to the word of the Lord in Genesis chapter 45. last Sunday we stopped in the Four Keys of the third pool everybody clear that came from Esther if you missed last Sunday and you didn't have a chance to watch it you really really really need to pay attention amen wants the messages delivered here it's not in my hand it is in your hand it's up to you to make up your time and find a way to listen to the message or release and again because when we give it here it's usually loaded so you need to take some time and go slowly until you catch up all the spirit is trying to say to the church we appreciate all the family members that are here we don't have strangers in this church amen we always have family member so brother Pasha you're not a stranger family member our sin sister Melanie this morning I thought your husband was here but he's not there your family amen is preaching praise the name of the Lord so we don't have stranger we don't have visitors here we have family members so feel free be a home I didn't have a chance to shake your hand Lord's willing we'll do that after service amen praise the name of the Lord Genesis chapter 45 verse 4. we are dealing with the Book of Esther we start from The Stave and we keep soaring deeper into the sky amen so we're getting deeper and deeper and deeper but these things need to be understood by the church if you dare you can say Amen we talk about the adoption of Mordecai which was speaking about the adoption of brother Branham because Mordecai was the type of Branham the end time messenger we show you the apparel of Mordecai how Mordecai have master has a big crown and her brother Branham God give him a huge portion of Heaven which was a domain and bigger anointing of the Holy Spirit I'm going to touch that down quickly and then probably we're going to touch two major keys today of the third pool you heard it third pool third pool third pool you got to know what is going on Amen no more guessing we say third poor we leave the church we don't even understand what we're talking about amen we heard that for 30 years Deadpool Deadpool Deadpool the word thankful Deadpool we need to get it amen verse 4. with respect because I felt checked in amen with respect to my brother amen and Joseph said you know brother Branham say go home and study that's the problem we have we don't study the word amen yes okay you okay and Joseph said to his Brethren you know the adoption of Joseph to put him in a position Pharaoh took his wing and give it to Joseph and the difference between Joseph and Pharaoh was the throne in everything it was Joseph but Pharaoh was still above by the throne amen but the authority of Egypt is under the hand of Joseph so just always keep that throne above when we talk about the end time ministry it is the Lord Jesus Christ but Jesus is still above amen amen and Joseph said to his brethren come near to me I pray you you might be seated and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sawed in Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourself you know the story that Joseph was sold by his brother because of jealousy everybody clear and when Joseph had the vision from the Lord Joseph saw that he was a star in the middle and there were 11 star bowing down to him he saw there were 11 12 Chief and his chief was in the middle and the 11th sheep always were bowing to him so he only that Vision or that dream only spoke about the position of Joseph he just spoke about Joseph being elevated in a level higher than his brethren but that Vision have was locking something in itself that was not plainly revealed everybody clear he revealed that Joseph will be a great man he revealed that Joseph will have a great position but he didn't tell us the purpose of that position amen is he going to be a president is he going to be a vice president is he going to be a supervisor he didn't tell us what the position because once you discover the position you need you can know by the position what is the attribute or the potential that goes with that position if somebody is a president you know what a president is supposed to do if somebody is a governor you know what a governor is supposed to do you know their expansion and you know the limitation so the vision only spoke about their position but the vision never revealed the purpose or the intent of that position everybody clear now Joseph is revealing the intent of the purpose of that position verse 5 now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourself that you sold me here for God watch it who sent Joseph to Egypt his brother Naturally Speaking amen but Joseph is saying he was not you even though he appeared like you the one that caused them by jealousy but he was God that did it that's why to the Christian all things work together for good amen he says God not you he take it away from his Brethren God did send me before you to do what to preserve life the vision never spoke about preserving life the vision only revealed the position everybody there now Joseph is saying that position was not only for my brother to be bowing down to me and to make me a great man the position the intent of God position in the life of Joseph was to preserve life everybody clear when God bring you to a higher position you need to be able to discern what God is doing God doesn't put you in a higher position for you to take advantage of your brother for you to dominate your brother for you to disrespect the people the reason why God put you to a certain position is because there is a purpose and that purpose is not your purpose but is God's purpose that he put in your life and that purpose must be to preserve life that you're gonna be tempted amen and God allowed two people to come in the church and act crazy and God told God Ibraham you say what you can say and whatever you want to say to those people is going to happen if they need to be dead they're going to be dead right away but the power of the spoken word when he came putting brother Branham in that position did not cause death to those young people but brother Branham preserve life everybody clear their purpose to preserve life for these two years has the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall be neither hearing nor Harvest watch verse 7. and God send me not you God amen God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great what he didn't know even that himself through the process of time the Lord unfolded that Revelation to him everybody clear that was before the death of his father let's go to chapter 50. Hallelujah because you need to know how to handle the power of the spoken word amen even though a woman disrespected Branham and God killed that woman brother Branham was still running to the hospital trying to pray for that woman until God sovereignly took that woman away amen he was now brother Branham asking God to kill her the purpose preserving life verse 15. if you dare you can say Amen and when Joseph's brother saw that their father was dead they say Joseph will perhaps hate us in other words that is gone he was the one that was the insurance guy so because he's dead We Believe now he's going to deal with us for what we did to him so that they still having that condemnation going on amen that's why you need the scepter the second time amen praise the name of the Lord and will certainly repay us all the evil which we did to him and they send a messenger to Joseph saying your father did command before he die they're using the father now saying so shall you say to Joseph forgive I pray you now the trespass of your breathing and their sin for they did to you evil and now we pray you forgive the trespass of your servant the god of your father and Joseph wept when they spoke to him they didn't understand me in other words Verse 18 and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and say behold we be your servant in other words we are we are there please don't kill her we are your servant we we want it to be slave don't take me again father as your son put me like one of your worker you remember the Prodigal Son amen look what Joseph did verse 19 and Joseph say fear not for a mind the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me amen but God meant it to good all things working together to bring to pass as it is this day to save what many people alive not only the Jews but also the Gentile everybody include the purpose of the position of Joseph the higher position was to save life to preserve life Exodus chapter 14. if not they won't drop the third pull on you you're going to kill people amen wait wait when we get to the fourth one like somebody say if they give me the choices of how to write I would say a Lincoln Navigator we will see that Exodus chapter 14. verse 10. everybody here and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lift up their eyes and behold the Egyptian marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord and they say to Moses because there were no graves in Egypt have you taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore have you dealt that's with us in other words you're a deceiver to carry us forth out of Egypt it is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt saying let us alone the condone with the condition get used to it that we may serve the Egyptian they wanted to serve the Egyptian God say take them away so they can serve me outside of Egypt roof surfing in the land of Judah for he had been better for us to serve the Egyptian can you imagine then that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said to the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptian whom you have seen today amen you shall see them again no more forever everybody clear praise the name of the Lord verse 14 and the Lord shall fat for you put your car in neutral remember and you shall hold your peace put your car in neutral amen verse 15 and the Lord said to Moses this is the problem wherefore in other words why are you to me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward so the situation is desperate it is a troubling situation Moses is going to God and trying to plead to God like Esther remember and instead of God give him a good answer God rebuked Moses in other words why are you crying to me now my question is to whom Moses should go to cry if it's not to the Lord now Moses is going to the only source that he used all this time and the sources rebuking him you see now there is a time he's going to work with you but you must get to a time where you understand his language and you're not a baby anymore but you are an adult mature man and woman amen God didn't say go fast he didn't say God pray he said go back and speak amen the Four Keys of the third pool last one Jeremiah 29. Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen we wear it over and over but we need to keep that one right in our face verse 11 for another thoughts that I think towards you say the Lord proud of peace that's the thought of God and not of evil but why do you permit evil to come to give you an expected end the end result good the Staffing between might be troubling but just know if you are called from God the end will always be good amen no matter what the situation is now the end will always be good guaranteed 100 guarantee they will be good amen verse 12 then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray to me and I will hearken to you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search me for me with all your heart let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again father for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord it's a rainy and uh sort of a gloomy day outside but regardless of that you're giving us opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father when we say the reveal word of the hour because many people are living in this world and father they don't even know what we have as a treasure father they are not even exposed to this message and some has been exposed but rejected it Lord father but you gave us Grace and a receptacle heart that we can receive this word and cherish it in our Heart Lord that's why we are grateful that we are gathering where the carcass is because you told us wherever the caucus is there the ego Shall Gather Lord may you move and serve the devil completely out and may you sell yourself within us in this place father may you speak to us madly and man they open the heaven open up Lord and may the Holy Spirit poor down this morning Lord and touch the life of your children and respond to their need Lord as we commit everything and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you we are on part 8 of The Mystery of the two states we are still dealing with the benefit of the land of Judah because God cannot move you from one place to another just for him to be playing around with you when God take you from one position to another there is always a purpose there is something that God is trying to achieve there was a separation that happened between roof and Oppa forgetting the things that are behind we are separated oppa has gone back let us move forward to the mark of the high calling now with the High Calling we dealt with the benefit of the land of Judah we spoke that the land of Judah have Burnley and wheat which now you know what he means he had the power of the golden scepter to give you an entrance to the Royal lineage we have the royal priesthood of Melchizedek that put you in the presence of the Living God inside the inner Court in the holy of the holiest amen and we have the power of the the Signet the bracelet and the child and we are still dealing with the power of the Signet as we handle the Book of Esther so now we are on part eight but throughout the week the Holy Spirit reminded me something that I needed to talk about it when we spoke about the five manifestation of Elijah in the life of Mordecai everybody clear we found out that when Elijah the spirit of Elijah came the first time God expressed to Elijah that there were people that didn't bow their knee before Bell and we found out that Elijah resisted our Mordecai resisted him and completely and did not want to Bow his knee before him and everybody clear which in the time of Elijah was represented as the devil through the gods or the other Bell everybody clear then we found out that there was a plot that was going on against the king and then in that plot Mordecai revealed the plot to the king amen and that was the appearance of the spirit of Elijah in the life of Elisha the prophet then the third one we found out that the that Hermann wife was revealed and that reveal herodia which was dealing with John the Baptist because she gave an advice to Herman to go ahead and to kill Mordecai just like the wife of Herod was the one after the head of John the Baptist then the fourth Elijah all these three manifestations were in the other court in the Old Testament because in the other court no one was permitted to get into the presence of the king because he had record the people were under the blood of bulls and goats but in the New Testament we under the blood of Jesus Christ and and the connection or the kinship between Esther and Mordecai was not revealed but with the fourth time or the fourth Elijah Ministry we found out that the kinship between Esther and Mordecai was unveiled in other words the Mordecai or the Elijah of the fourth time is also part of the bread but yet he was the one taking care of Esther everybody clear the position are different but they are brothers everybody clear then we found murder that that Spirit begin to write letter to the Jews which is the fifth Elijah that goes to the Jews with Moses and handle the situation with the 144 000. now I will try to draw your attention to the second appearing of Elijah spirit in the life of Mordecai let's take Esther chapter two amen yeah somebody's still putting their luggage you gotta hurry up before we take off amen praise the name of the Lord Esther chapter 2. if you dare you can say Amen verse 21. everybody clear you need your Bible in this church the Bible say brother Branham saying you need your Bible verse 21 in those days sat in the king's gate two of the king's Chamberlain Big Ten and tirish of those which kept the door were angry and sought to lay hand on the king hercuers so there were a plot there was a plot that was made to kill the king everybody clear verse 22 and the thing was known to Mordecai Modica are understood or got the secret of that plot everybody clear who turned into Western Quinn and Esther certify the king thereof in Mordecai's name everybody clear and when Inquisition or investigation was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hang on the tree and it was written in the book of The Chronicle before the king so when Mordecai unveiled the plot that was against the king something happened to this they took whatever happened during that time and they put it as a record in the chronicle of the king everybody clear now let's go to Esther chapter 6. if you dare you can say Amen verse 1. on that night could not the king sleep everybody clear and he commanded to bring the book of records everybody clear it didn't happen by any chance of the chronicle and they were read before the king so many things were given to the king they spoke about what happened in 1994 in 1993 all these years nothing attracted the king attention everybody clear verse 2 and he was found written that Mordecai had told of big tana and tirish two of the king's Chamberlain the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king harassers and the King say what honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this amen among all the action the more the guy done the only one that was recorded was the unveiling of the secret to kill the king everybody clear and then when the action or that attribute was brought back the second time are you there the king did not leave it there the first time it was just an event that happened and that event was only recorded everybody there but the second time the event was retold again are you there to the king but this time when he was he told to The King The King couple this event with honor and dignity the first time there was no honor and dignity the second time there was honor and dignity that was connected to it everybody clear history then say the king's servant that minister to him there is nothing done for him verse 6 chapter 6 so Haman came in and the King said to him what shall be done to the man who is the king Delight to honor we already explained you this now Herman thought in his heart like the devil Lucifer in his heart to whom would the king Delight to do honor more than myself verse 7 and him and answered the king for the man whom the king Delight to honor let the what so the second event that honor has been connected to the Royal what Royal Apparel in other words the king clothes are gonna be involved with this everybody clear amen be brought which the king uses to wear in other words it's not going to be somebody else robe somebody else clone it is exactly the king's dress and if you are acquainted with the King are you there if somebody put his clothes and come out and give you his back not his front I'm going to release brother Kalima are you there if somebody were the king's gloves are you there and give you his back not the front the back like in Genesis 18 the back are you there like when God unveiled himself to Moses the battle if they give you the back you will think it is the king a letter job praise the name of the Lord you need to be really in a message let the Royal appear be brought to the king that which the King used to wear and the water foreign [Applause] horse but he was the horse of the king which was the word are you there if you look you're gonna see somebody if you go by the horse it's the horse of the king if you go by the apparel it's the apparel of the king but the one who is on there is not the king amen and the Quran everybody see that and the Quran Royal this is not Mordecai crown we spoke about Mordecai Quran the last time last one uh last Sunday this is the actual crime of the king the domain the anointing of the king and the anointing of the king is the pillar of fire because what Abraham said the pillar of fire is the attribute of the fullness of God are you there so when you watch the anointing working with Mordecai it is the anointing of the king are you there the robe of the king the anointing of the king the horse of the king but it's not the king it is Mordecai and the king is still higher than Mordecai are we there verse 9 and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of the one of the king's most noble priests with whom the king Delight to honor and bring him on Horseback through what through the street of what in other words this manifestation of the king apparel this manifestation of the king horse this manifestation that is couple with the event of this of disclosing are you there is not going to be an event that's gonna be done in secret it is in the Bible the message of brother Branham is in the Bible everybody there it is gonna be a public manifestation are you there everybody clear and while this is going on to the public on the city everybody following me the king stays in the inner Court are you there no one sees the king physically somebody is leaving the king horse the king crown the king apparel and he is riding publicly but not forever but for a temporary period amen Hallelujah through the street of the city and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king Delight to do what so the second time this event is recorded are you there of unveiling the plot to kill the king everybody clear the second time this come back on the scene it is coming with this event connected to it everybody clear but what does the unveiling of the king plot means what does he mean are you there what does he mean take second king he was given to me and I have to deliver it just like he gave it to me amen let's go to second king chapter six Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen second king chapter 6 verse 8. are you there sir hearing Pages moving everybody there then the king of Syria World against Israel and took Casa with his servant saying in such and such a place shall be my camp so the king were making plans to attack Israel and they say we're gonna Camp right there verse 9. and the man of God everybody know that Manukau don't worry we want to find who he and the man of God sent to the king there was a man of God right there that communicated to the king to unveil unto the king the plot the plan that is made against him just like Mordecai and fell to the king the plot that was made against him everybody following me amen then the king of uh verse 9 and the man of God sent to the king of Israel saying be aware that you pass not such a place for there the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and won him off and served himself there not to us no choice in other words this happened many times are you following me it didn't happen one time every time the king of Syria was planning to kill the king of Israel the man of God tell him don't go over there don't go over there and when he verified he was exactly the truth it didn't happen one time it didn't happen to us it happened multiple times everybody clear let's jump to verse 11. therefore the heart of the king of Syria was so troubled for this thing and he called his servant he thought there is a spy and said to them will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel in other words any time that we make plan somebody is busting our plane up so who is here it seems like there are spies within the army that are telling the king of Israel every single plan and that's the reason why our plan are not working everybody clear watch now verse 12. and one of his servants saying none in other words there is no spice here we are all loyal to you none my Lord O King but who Elisha is the spirit of Elijah that came down upon Him amen so the anointing of Elijah when that anointing Came Upon Elisha he begin to discern are we okay let's go and no one of his servants say known my Lord O King which is the second appearing of who of Elijah and the second appealing of Mordecai action was to unveil the plan of the plot against a king everybody create now let's continue amen and one of his servants say no my Lord now I got to give you now we already left the airport praise God of the King by the Elijah the prophet that is in Israel tells the king of Israel the word that you speak in what in other words the spirit of discernment is in the life of Elisha amen and that is if disclosing the plan to the king speak of discernment are you there it was that discernment that is brought back again the second time but the ministry of discernment the second time does not only stop under discernment it is the son of man Ministry and that Ministry is coupled with the honor and dignity of the king are you there because this end time the discernment that was under Elijah that discernment came back on brother Branham with the spirit of Elijah but when the discernment comes the second time brother pranam is in Royal apparel brother Branham is in the king Ross brother brought them were the king's Quran that's why he could say I take every Spirit here under my control are you there brother Branham is doing that publicly amen and it's a temporary work he looks exactly like Jesus Christ but it is not Jesus Christ it is brother brother wearing the apparel of the king Hallelujah let's go the true Easter seal and if he can reveal to me by his holy spirit then resurrected Christ who come here and give me a word the work right here was temporary he was not permanent the king stayed in the palace but he is revealed to the public temporarily the messages in the Bible are you there give me a temporarily Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away because he need to put the king apparel amen and his Spirit come in are you there oh my God then to let you know whether he's alive or not now I don't know you that's Mordecai that's me me and my spirit we don't know you but he's the king knows you but he want to borrow Mordecai he wants to borrow my body to prove that he is the resurrecter crossed the king stay in the inner chamber but on the outside Mordecai is proving that the king is a love I'm so happy to learn it to him give it to him anything he can get out of it but if you shall accept the spirit that is on me now there could not be enough devil in hell because he is dealing with the king crown make you doubt anymore and you got to be here I am not the Healer amen I am only on a king's horse I am Mordecai temporarily the king is there but it's a public manifestation of the king he is the Healer I can't see Vision he is the one who does what so it's not the word of a man everybody it is just my water that is what amen praise the name of the Lord now what is the brother Branham it is not me and he would not do a thing to me if you didn't do it it is just as much into it as I am it's got to be a faith that does the touching amen so when you touch the king garmenting are you there the one who's gonna talk to you is not the king it is not a child that talks to you are you there when you move you are moving the hand of Mordecai and Mordecai will turn and say who touch me but you didn't touch Mordecai you touched the appearance of the king upon Mordecai amen he will speak through me it's just a gift to yield myself to him just give him my my my my it is just a temporary work but he does know so you touch him then he just used me back Mordecai just turned around and say hey who pulled me up there are you there when you hear the voice it's the voice of Mordecai when you look it's Modica but when you look at the Quran it's the crown of the king it is the gloves of the king it is the horse of the king see it is you and I together as his servant and he made himself known to his people that is right on time in the very day that the son of man is revealed Revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh angel message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man that's Monica but the messenger are you following me is revealing the son of man because the son of man is in the palace the king stay in the palace but he is revealed on the outside on the street of the city are you there is where it seemed to be hard for you can you get it separated now that is where it seems to be hard for you you see not the son of man himself he's in the palace but the servant Angel the seven messenger is referring to the is going on the street mother Kaya is revealing to the public the king not everybody have the privilege to go inside the king Palace but through the ministry of Mordecai he bring the king outside and unveiled the king to the people and you need to be connected to Mordecai because he's revealing the hidden King [Music] is revealing to the public the world Hallelujah I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this step you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just her and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper that was his desire but it's the will of my father that I declared to do and determined to do I was not the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I am not the one that performed these things and foretell these things that happened as perfectly they are I am only that is near when he does I was only a what that he uses to say it he was not what I knew it is what I Just Surrender myself that he spoke through it is not me it was not the seven Angel oh no he was the manifestation of the son of man he was not the angel his message he was the mystery of God unfolded it is not a man it is God this message is God [Applause] son of man that's Mordecai he was the messenger from the son of man he is only revealing the king the son of man is trust he's in heaven he's sitting on the throne the king is in the palace he's sitting on the throne but the one right here is Monica revealing to you the son of man Hallelujah you are not the son of man is trust he is the one that you're feeding on you are not feeding on a man this message is not a man you are feeding on his word but you are feeding on the unfailing by the word of God son of man this message is Jesus Christ [Applause] oh Hallelujah why because the identification of the King has been given to somebody temporarily the identification of God has always been knowing can foresee what he has been and tell what has been how is that and what will be in other words he foretell the future we know that that is how the prophet was known like Elisha that's how Jesus was known as the Messiah and the son of discernment are you there and he is the same Messiah today as he was then only difference I'm reading to you only without her because the king is in the palace are you there the Corporal body of King Harris is in the palace he sent his Spirit back to use your my and you might not be able to do this it's only Mordecai that's gonna ride on the horse not everybody will do that you are not going to reveal the son of man like brother Branham we know in the scripture there is what in the air if somebody grows up and tell you that is the replacement of brother Branham you need to close that TV screen everywhere are you done but see but you but yet you can believe it and you get other things that you can do everybody in other words when it comes to rad on the king's horse not everybody will do that only brother Branham can turn the back and design the people it is only one person we we can heal the sick we can pray for the sick we can speak the word but that public Revelation manifestation discernment of Genesis 18 to turn the back and to begin to discern here there it is only one [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah as we get into Esther now We Gather we're already higher whatever I'm saying yes when Peter James and John was stuck up he's talking about more transfigation and the cloud overshadow the Lord Jesus and God's folks say this is my beloved Son I preach on that here not long ago a little message here he I suppose maybe you have it on tape I'm sure and he said that he went up to the mountain this is Brother holy Roberson the vision that he saw the pickup brother Branham and brother Branham went and he came back on the Lord's table and one of random change this is another version of it brother Brian I'm explaining in that he says and when he did I was standing there in the mountain and the voice came from the cloud was innate brother Roy and said something on this order about brother Branham this is my and I have called him to be a prophet today to lead the people just as Moses did you remember the Simon the Paul's praise the name of the Lord and he's been given the what he could what do you get that that's the adoption of Mordecai now I'm blaming to last Sunday and I'm heading everybody clear or something like that like Moses did like speaking in the Flies and we know about the squirrel and so forth and the things that's already took place leader had it right back there I suppose you know what taking place in a house and he told him that I have done what Moses has done oh brother sister do you realize the day we are living in the most glorious town when God Of Heaven won't put a more to ask anything are you there and he shall give it to you it is too deep for my mind I know that but I hope in my heart intellectually is hard but here in my heart can contain as much of it as I can I have lived on it I have traveled I'm going to Westward on it on the right I am entering meeting on it I'm living on it God's word is I'm not going to speak it in his name I'm going to speak in the revelation of my face what happened in Sabino Canyon the other day I believe that the hour is approaching sister Jean when missing lamps won't be watching and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if I can make if he can make a squirrel up here that is he here is the man or a woman just a part missing in other words if God can create a whole squirrel how about somebody who's just missing a part of an arm are you there just got a part missing and that complete animal in itself God I love him everybody clear so now as we enter here let's go back to Esther chapter eight now where we were and we go Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord you want to trace brother Branham let's go back to the Bible [Music] you have a problem with brother Branham go to the Bible That's A Dangerous Ground amen That's A Dangerous Ground the bubble is a dangerous grand for message believer if a message believer pull you in the Bible you are done because the interpretation of the Bible belongs to them we are splitting under the king Authority thank you verse 4 everybody there and then the king held out the golden scepter you remember that for last Sunday towards them so as there arose and stood before the king you remember that he she stood the second time the second the mysterious part of justification you never done it to begin with then we are standing on his righteousness that condemnation is taken away because if your heart condemn you then you now have faith but they come and remove that condemnation then there is no more condemnation to those that are in Christ everybody clear so and stay standing as Esther stood

ago when I sat down by her Brother David that's true right sycamore tree where Judah hang himself okay but the secretary as I was telling you and begin to act so God didn't come just to brother Branham just like that God didn't come to the King Nebuchadnezzar just like that Nebuchadnezzar was meditated on something are you there brother brother went and saw not every tree by the sycamore tree where Judah was hanged the fourth cross you remember okay and brother Branham sat there and he began to as he's thinking what was he thinking because the meditation of your heart must be acceptable then you break into him are you following me and begin to think he was there for the first time that he and declared the new ministry to me thank God do you see you see the temple is not difficult it's not difficult are you there think on what watch that first draw not thinking on him is like you are you see what I'm talking about have you ever thought about somebody and you see that person coming to your house and you say wait a minute I just thought about you did that happen to you how many people did it happen raise your hand why did it happen why did it happen have you been talking about somebody and suddenly the person knock at the door [Laughter] if these are laws these are laws think on him join now unto me and I shall John now unto you brother John you tell me about the time say the Lord think upon him David spoke that he write his commandment upon the bedpost and do what on them what why is David keep talking about meditation why why do preacher before they preach they want to be quiet why are you there why Hallelujah that is what the church what you see what you see why the destruction is happening in the media the way it's happening so your mind is not stable you are always busy are you there when you go home you are drawn dying to bed boom gone today are you there that's what the church ought to do will keep your what are you there your heart to name with God I'm going slowly because this is very important either we watch and you come up and you begin to ask questions which I don't mind they are hard tuning with God there and what for it is then is when he what so as you Ponder and meditate on God that is when you break into his sovereignty Hallelujah Solomon say as a man what in what meditation so easy begin to think that you are what that he that is and you and he don't just wait till you go to or some convenient hour just keep on your mind all down [Applause] that person that call you on the telephone three hours stop him if he's doing if he's talking about the word encouraging praise God but if it's a battle you know you know you know you know you know stop it wasting your time of blessings brother Branham said those blessings that's why you don't get to those blessings wasting your time amen the trouble today we got so much money and stuff on our mind God can have a place to get in your world we want to go downtown shop for new dresses and you had or something another we got to go see Susie and John follow the final of NBAs we are going to play card tonight play on the Xbox we can't go to church tonight we can swim from home because we love susion or something like that the television program we get everything else on our mind the church has got so many what brother Branham said I cannot do it until I get to what others how are you gonna get to order when you busy you are getting different to others kidding it's an order for you to check who takes you think he is an order for you to check who like you on WhatsApp it's an order for you to stop what you're doing sometimes you read the Bible today you are receiving a different order and tomorrow at six o'clock you take another picture you post and you send it and then click it we got everything else on our minds the church has got so many orders and things to keep us what this is in 1960. we're in 2020. that shows it's the word of God are you there prayer meeting is left out we need to draw what so he will jump his friend that's right but everything else has took the place of prayer meeting every fingers has took the place of a real spiritual worship as you are meditating as you are meditating I love him he loved him he loved me I love him I love him I love him you are breaking are you there oh maybe two or three minutes in the church but it's even preached too long but I just love to lay and breathe before him in his do you see now you see now praise the name of the Lord the same Daniel that taught them of the event say that in the last day the people that know their God shall do export scripture must be fulfilled if we only what and if you notice God only reveals himself to those who search and long to seek him you don't care about him he doesn't care about you matter of fact in his sovereignty he still watches over you are you there he cares save the Lord and sometimes God let things happen that's why your Trouble Comes so that we will do what for God has surely what the destination that certain event must take place and they will afford just as his great time Trump takes it off everybody care oh praise the name of the Lord brother Branham now here is what it is friend so if you get it you are a Christian because you believe that you are a Christian so the way God comes to brother Branham brother Branham went and sit under a sycamore tree if you need that coach you see me and brother random begin to think if you study you go look it up what brother Branham was thinking about was the scripture ask say to this mountain be moved and brother brother begin to think how can Jesus say say to this mountain be more but Jesus was not dead yet it was before the atonement so how can he say that and give such great power to men he was not dead yet as brother Branham was doing that he broke into God's sovereignty you see that then God came and say that scripture is in the atonement body brand I'm asked a question he said do you remember the old prophet because if it's not on the atonement how did Moses spoke and flies came that atonement was the lamb who was slain before the foundation of the world then brother Branham said yeah I see he said when you are on the pulpit Discerning people do you think you're the one who do that whatever them say ah I said when Elisha he was in the Old Testament that's what you did in the New Testament don't you see that ah see now what are you looking for square up do you see now that's why brother brought them say I never ask but it was the thinking the meditation upon God and then God opened up and give him something he was not even thinking about are you there amen and all settled because he is a high priest he is the high priest of your confession what you confess you are word of mammoth right word of Mama won't you confess you are that's what you are any man will never leave any father or any higher than what he believes he's living you take a man that is always that is talking about drinking what the word of Mama he talks about drinking he what meditation of my heart he jumped right into that and become a why because this law when you don't use them good you're gonna attract somebody else you talk about Jesus you speak about Jesus you think about Jesus you attract Jesus you talk about drinking you think about drinking all the time the demon of drinking leave hell and he comes he said you've been calling me all this time now I'm gonna make you a good drinker do you understand me you understand what you keep talking about is pulling somebody out of hell you are also breaking into hell are you there you drop right down in that category becomes a you were not before you get anointed just like brothers got anointed and spoke the square and if the demon of drunkenness come on you he's gonna also make you do what you were thinking about are you there a man that is always thinking about is he pornography you see he looks at you see when you play with pornography Young Folks he think about always picture of naked women he reads those who love stories guess what you're gonna drop in that category and before you know it a husband begin to run outside with women with women he's a brother but he begins to have girlfriend where is his mind are you there how can you be a married woman begin to run away where was your mind what door did you open who did you invite to buy your speaking by your reading by your watching by your talking by your meditation are you there are you there oh my God let's stop here foreign that's why brother Branham said think on that scripture when you are sick think on that scripture when you do this think on that scripture when you do this think on that scripture are you there let the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be what pleasing unto the king once he pleases the king an anointing job are you there an anointing job in your car meditate upon him in your house meditate upon him in your bed keep thinking on him the King was thinking thinking thinking boom a dreamer the Lord comes and give it to him did the king ask no he was just meditating on it did the disciples say as we walking we want Jesus to come now no they were just talking and somebody coming as they say I'm gonna draw near to the king once she get there the King open up himself what do you want brother Branham what are you doing here what are you doing here what do you want you are thinking about what you were thinking about say speak to this mountain so since that was the subject you speak Square because this is what you are looking if brother Barnum was hunting for lion but the bottom would have created the lion because Abraham was looking for a sacrifice God didn't create Square for Abraham the customers Abraham need and give him a rama brother Branham was not looking for a ram he was looking for square he cast Thomas brother Branham need and give him a square because faith is there substance can be anything substances like stem cells you can make them a liver you can make them a heart you just program them you say you become heart and the stem cell become hard you program the stem cell you say you become lungs and the same still become lungs we need to program those stem cells for sister Jane for a new heart let's say foreign the Four Keys of your third pole the first one is the sovereignty of God but there is a key to this Jonah unto him then you're gonna figure it out when we get to these you're gonna see why did this happen to hearty right we always say atira said the right thing how did she say the right thing why did she say the right thing are you there who thought who gave her the word to say what you say how can the Roman Centurion he just came he's a man of order working with military people tell them go go go he took his work situation and explain it to Jesus he didn't say Isaiah say Church the Roman Centurion didn't say Isaiah say you're gonna be healing the government should be upon your shoulder with your strap we are here the whole man Soldier didn't say that he didn't say Daniel saying are you there he used his military stuff but when he gives it to Jesus Jesus said what a faith now what used to be his job is today a scripture okay okay there is no scripture that says that if you touch His Garment he's going to be healed no scripture the woman just say I tried this I trust this I don't have strength let me crawl if I can just touch which Christian did she use which one and when she touched everybody was touching nothing when she touched Jesus stop and say who touch me why did Jesus respond to her are you there she didn't touch the man she touched the clove of Jesus are you there and Jesus turned around and say who you need to find what because God heaven and changing pattern he does not change if you found the key and you go back the same way he's gonna give you the same result all the time [Applause] God is predictable the unchanging pardon of God now when something happened you need to find what did he do because once you find out you go back with the same thing because once God approves something he tells you that is his way that is an Open Door that's why the woman in Tennessee say ah with a woman Elijah I have a baby who's dying I'm a with a woman where is Elijah give me Elijah [Music] God search where's the anointing of Elijah Gabriel where is the anointing of Elijah it is with brother Branham where is he in the airplane where is he going forget about that turn that airplane disturb the wind over there push it over there are you there are you there are you there and then the airplane turn and sat there and he said wait a minute tell that supervisor to make sure they all tell brother Branham is going to sit we'll be closer to that neighborhood and make sure brother Branham there is a post office there yes there is two water no no no that one need to have a post office because what brand of have letters the GPS pick up now go right go left oh I'm a white man I'm a white man a black neighborhood go move forward and the woman is sitting she put her Pearl say how you doing pastor say where do you know me I'm Brad Ibraham I don't care about your name I was looking for Elijah [Applause] do you know that brother Brandon have a God to pray for women in the hospital when they are alone do you know that okay do you know that who which Deacon was with brother Branham in that room huh did he go with his wife that woman had a husband did Elijah they teach bath was with a widow woman without a deacon [Music] are you there do you understand it is the power of the scepter the power it goes above things that you think above and Paul thinks that you think
