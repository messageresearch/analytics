one special tonight I I would want um can you be seated a man we have one more song to sing but I want us to sing a special Fest and then we sing that song amen amen so um we have a special from sister Sharon amen amen and before that um brother Greg has an unspoken request amen and I would invite him to pray amen but I believe we all have unspoken requests the men but we want to thank God for our lives amen I don't have any um praise report but as I always say we coming here we living is a praise report to the Lord amen amen so we're going to invite brother Greg tonight amen to bring to the Lord our prayer request unspoken and then our praise report amen thank you so good um I just like to give a little testimony before we pray and this might encourage somebody along the way and some people might think well this is silly but the message that was playing the Third Exodus brother Branham said it's so simple that most of the time it goes right over us well last week I went to Waffle House to get something to eat and I ordered a Cheesesteak omelet and I'm sitting there thinking well I might order a side of bacon too and I was I was just thinking that and but I didn't so I went ahead and ordered my food and she brought it and a few minutes later she brings over this plate of bacon and I'm thinking to myself did I tell her I wanted that and uh so I went ahead and ate and the waitress there her name is Sue and I said sue did did I tell you I wanted to side of bacon and she said no she said but we just had extra and I just brought it to you you know [Music] [Applause] and the scripture that hit me was before they speak I will answer [Applause] so maybe that will encourage somebody along the way and I know your wife is listening in right and maybe this will encourage her that she just thinks about them new kidneys and they'll they'll they'll be there you know so let us pray father we come before you father what what a word that you have given to us father in this day father just thoughts come to pass Lord and before we speak you're there to answer father how what a privileged people we are to know these things father to hear the word father that you're bringing forth in this day father Lord we can't some it's like the prophet said so we can't even sometimes rap wrap our minds around it father but Lord we know as you brought forth Sunday the only difference is is that seed that's laying inside there that was put there before the foundation of the world that's the only difference without that there's nothing we can do to get it and with it there's nothing we can do to miss it father how simple it is and Lord let us dwell in this simplicity of what you are and who you are and what we are and Who We Are I know Satan will try to knock us down and say well you're not that because of these thoughts that go through your head and things that you do during the day you're not one of them but Lord every time that those thoughts come to us father you'll raise up a standard against it so father as We Gather here this evening father to hear your word Lord we let us as it were to throw open every door and every window of our heart father every little secret place that may be hidden father let us open up that door father that you may come in and speak to us you may drive those things out that not that's not like you and father we we just we don't want to we we want to remember Sister across Lord and Lord let a thought be planted in her in her heart Lord that those kidneys are waiting on her and she's just got to step out there and claim it and Lord the special request request that I have in my heart father you know the situation there father and we just bring that before you Lord for you to work that out according to your will your purpose father and Lord we just rest in the fact that everything is in your control you wrote out this great play before the foundation of the world and father we are actors in that play we don't know what our part is per se but you do we'll follow Regus asks you to guide us to play our part in this great play and follow we just bring everything before you we lay that at the feet of your throne Lord giving you the praise the glory and honor honor for everything break the bread of life to us Lord May our hearts burn within us father as you speak to us along the way and bless the tithes and the offering father multiplied a hundredfold to bless your work Lord whether it's in this church or may whoever it goes to Father magnified a hundredfold father in Jesus name we pray amen amen and

the seed of God everywhere you're going it's speaking about Grace and matter of fact our name is Mrs because the seed is the seed of before you were even born that's when they already declare everything amen the Bible said before the children were even born neither have done anything good or bad so your birth has nothing to do with the election of God amen whether you are born in a nightclub whether you are born wherever you are born even in the manual pile wherever you were born it doesn't matter because the decree the decision of God was done before you were born Romans 9 says that for the children be not yet born need to have done any good or evil that the purpose of God to election my stand that election didn't start when Mom and Daddy got married before the foundation of the world Amen where are you going whatever happened God is in control what he's looking at is not the real you like this but he's looking at the seed on the east side everybody okay amen that's why he told Peter he say eraser and eat a good legalistic he said no way I am under the law we don't eat this he say I am the one telling you to eat he said you remember Pete the word I call clean don't you dare call that unclean amen everybody okay and God told Brother Branham do not even use the word Ricky and ricketta because Dan there those crazy children that you see over there on the street some of them have the seed of God inside everybody okay that's what he's looking at amen yeah it was with brother judge today he greets you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ and I told him to greet the church also in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God Lord's willing on April 19th it's going to be a Wednesday that will be our first Wednesday where we exhort and go to prayer everybody okay so keep it in prayer uh and keep it in your calendar it's April 19th we preach for 30 minutes or so and we go in prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer until we dismiss in prayer April 19th it's going to be a Wednesday so make sure you lay everything is hard and you make sure we're here so let the Holy Spirit come down and speak to us so blesses open up the cannon Quicken the gift speaking tongue interpret all of this word of knowledge so when you come out of here you are refreshed amen and ready to fight the battle amen tonight brother Tim cross is preaching tonight this is his second home I usually call this their second home they got the first home with brother George Bennett so when the outside of Lincoln turn outside of Newton that's when the stop by amen at the cinema place and we have a little place for them that we have prepared so they can refresh and they can continue their Journey amen his wife is not here you know musicians sometimes they have to be on

away from that song oh We Believe oh thanks [Music] we believe all things are possible only now why don't you just lift your head and testify to the Lord Lord I believe Lord [Music] Lord I believe I know all things [Music] Lord I believe the Lord I believe I know all things [Music] amen we could sing that verse Jesus is here because he promised where two or three gathered in my name I'll be there in the midst amen I invite you to turn in your Bibles to first chapter first Samuel chapter 17. just say It's a Wonderful privilege to be with you again this evening every time I see a text or a call from the Stephen my heart rate goes up my blood pressure goes up I get excited because I don't know if I'm one of your favorite evangelists but this is one of my favorite places to come and Minister amen just where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty and always fill a liberty here when among the saints and I I might have said this before but when y'all come to church y'all come to have church and so amen I believe I believe that's the kind of atmosphere where miracles happen where bands are broken amen and where and where God moves so we thank the Lord for that appreciate brother Stephen tonight and each of you that have come this evening to feed upon the word of the Lord we're going to read in first Samuel first Samuel chapter 17 beginning at verse number 24 and um just believe the Lord to bless the reading of his word this evening amen first Samuel chapter 17 you know I find that oftentimes when I come here without having listened or tuned in to the services prior the holy spirit will just set it right in there and it's just a perfect uh continuation or in continuity with what the holy spirit's been ministering so that was going on with the songs tonight even that last song brother Stephen that you requested it was just Paving the laying the groundwork for what was on my heart I said my that's that's very reassuring as a minister so amen first Samuel 17 verse 24 and all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and were so afraid and the men of Israel said have you seen this man that has come up surely to defy Israel as he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel as you read that last sentence make his father's house free How could a man that was a king over the people of God give them any freedom greater than what God had already granted to them but this was a king that was the choice of the people and was premature to God's institution of a real Godly King over Israel so they come under the bondage of a man they chose to be you know their leader Head and Shoulders Above the Rest amen so be careful what you what you when you get ahead of God's timing a lot of times you're putting yourself under bondage is that right and in verse 26 and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the men that killeth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God and the people answered him after this matter saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him and Elia his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab's anger was kindled against David and he said why came as thou down hither and with whom has thou left those few sheep in the wilderness he was mocking him I Know Thy pride in the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down to thou might as see the bow and David said what have I now done is there not a Cause and those five words are what I'd like to title this message tonight as you're seated is there not a Cause amen amen I'm going to share something with you here in just a moment I might have read this before I don't know but um you know the the nice thing about in our battle as Christians you know most most armies and most soldiers they they have a they've gone through boot camp they've gone through training and they're given a war manual so we have a war manual tonight and the nice thing about ours is it's never changed it's never had to be updated or revised our adversary has never developed anything that caught us off guard or put our general back at the drawing table to come up with something better ours has never changed because it's never been defeated but but but the the the adversaries of the peoples and the armies of the Living God have always had to keep you know revising their War manual because they keep getting defeated from the most unseeming or the most unsuspecting in the most you know uh unsuspected ways so I I just I I call this the Philistine War manual because the Philistines were always enemies the Philistine War manual and so it one one section of it may go like this it's not the armies and the great Weaponry of our opponent Israel that has inflicted the greatest toll on our ranks it's not the spears the swords the battering rams the bows and arrows or the catapults that have inflicted the greatest casualties and defeats we have all those weapons and the ability to defend them also instead it's the little Shepherd boy with a slingshot the boy who wasn't tall enough strong enough or smart enough to go and join his brothers in Saul's Army yet when he finally reached him on the battlefield he displayed more courage than all the others and excelled above them all in his victory over the enemy amen it's the long-haired Nazarite boys those guys tie Foxx's Tails together they're not depending on their own strength their size their might or any of those things they're depending on the almighty God those guys somehow seem to always come from the underdog to the overcomer watch out for Farmers with Ox goats [Applause] ha they don't have army training they don't have guns and bows and Spears but they catch a realization of who they are and what they're standing for and with something as simple as an ox code in their hand as many as 600 Philistines have been killed by men like that it's the prophet who refuses to stop praying at the King's Command and the three captives who refuse to bow to the king's image of their prophet who have embarrassed us and brought our evil schemes to nothing be careful because it's not just boys and men that decimate us watch out for the little girls also like Esther who have an identity that is hidden until they've reached the throne and when they reveal their true Heritage those who conspired against them are hanged watch out for things like Scarlet threads hanging from the windows of homes amen they thought those walls could never crumble they thought that was a city that could never be overthrown but a woman with a Scarlet thread hanging from the window amen was the only thing remaining after Joshua and the armies of Israel surrendered that City and the walls came down Rahab was posing as a harlot you know this is how they might have looked at it but was actually hiding Israelite spies in the roof of her home and something as simple as a Scarlet thread hanging from her window resulted in her home being the only thing left standing when the walls and the entire city were being destroyed watch out for those who value a prophet's words to be more powerful than the presidents she'll have thus saith the Lord or shall keep still the only thing that will move her is the unction of the Holy Spirit now I'm reading from a prophet those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen the Philistine War manual again constantly being updated ours has never changed amen so I want to go uh just into the the a little bit of the background of this of the portion of scripture we've read tonight because we know that David unlike his older brothers didn't go in the army didn't join Saul's military was was wasn't deemed fit to do that but here on this day he has been sent by his father Amen to go and visit his brothers on the Battlefront and to take something to his brothers that would help lift their spirits you know when you've been fighting you've been battling and you've been in in the in the duty of military or combat you're you're a long ways from home you you miss your bed your your your family your siblings your mama's good cooking and all those things so you know even though uh militarily speaking you may still have a lot of strength a lot of courage and all the rights of Weaponry still uh your morale is an important component amen of you maintaining the right disposition Amen to enable to fully exercise your potentials as a soldier amen so here David was sent with a provision from the father that would give these men of God his Brethren the Israelites something to boost them on the front lines and I know brother Stephen has a great ministry of teaching but I I see something I see something happening in here where where where their father uh David's father and his brother's father amen realize you know what these what these men have right now uh it's just is a little bit lacking they're they're suffering from a deficiency so he sends David with some bread and with some cheese and with some wine even with some original Mana you know something directly from the father's hand something directly because you know I'm gonna get in trouble brother Stephen I'm gonna get in trouble I I know I am I'm just going to get in trouble right now because you know I I'm you know how it is when you're in the military now I might dad never fought but he lived during the time of the the wrapping up of the Vietnam War so he was in the Army I think he served four years and and that you know I I'm I'm the oldest of seven children and so I have four younger brothers and and dad you know we don't get dressed up we like to be little soldiers we don't have camouflage and our granny would buy us things and and so Dad would go occasionally go to the Army Navy store and we get these things called MREs do you all know what an MRE is a meal ready to eat have you ever had one Brother John you deserve a medal just for having to eat those things if you've ever had one you think how in the world have we ever won a war if this is all our soldiers ever ate because it's dried freeze-dried food you know it's food that can last Almost indefinitely in almost any conditions it's packed in a vacuum tight bag it's it's shrink wrapped and and it's there and you know it's it's it's not a it's it's not a potato it isn't gravy and and steak and chicken and fresh vegetables amen it's something that's freeze dried and you have to open it up and maybe pour some water from your canned seed on top of it and hope you have a microwave or something maybe a magnified glass under the sunlight something to warm that up you know it's just something to get you by what was David's father's name Jesse thank you Jesse knew these boys need a little something in addition to the MREs you know they've been getting these canned meals they've been out on the Battlefront you know they just been getting something that that will get them by and it's important and it's made of good substance amen but I'm gonna give him some fresh food if it's something that that really David you got to make haste to get this down to them before it spoils I mean because this is living substance now I will say it you need to be in the house of God surrounded by a church full of people hearing a Life Ministry feeding you something that's fresh from the Throne of God amen amen because we're not looking just to get along we're looking to take a rapture and I appreciate those scriptures and I appreciate every book and every tape but God has appointed a Ministry to take those nutrients and mix them together and with the water of the Holy Spirit and a fresh source and it's something hot something warm something that'll spoil if you don't partake of it real quickly [Applause] hello Church oh brother Tim we're in 2023. we we just watched the services online you know we're scared of all the diseases all the covet all the flu amen all the things that could go around friend you need a revelation [Music] [Applause] when you get in God's presence in the Shekinah Glory it renders all diseases null and void [Applause] amen they put Aaron's rod in the holiest of holies and overnight a dead dry almond Rod blew forth with original life and if you get in that presence you won't pay attention to your neighbor and somebody coughing or sneezing or something like that you'll be in God's presence which renders all other Spirits all other demon powers glory to God [Applause] Hallelujah forsaking not the assembling of yourself together as a matter of sun is and the much more so as you see that day approaching [Applause] amen you need a fresh cooked meal [Applause] you need something fresh from the father's hand hallelujah amen and I'm not throwing off I am in no way throwing off on tapes books or this Bible but God has appointed a Ministry of vessels that are his agents to be the distribution channels for his word amen to reach the needs amongst the body of Jesus Christ times change conditions change but God don't change his format is just as powerful and just as effective today [Music] as it was [Applause] Hallelujah I want to tell you something David had more than bread he had more than Wine he had more than all he had more than biddles he had a fresh testimony he had a real and living God he had something that could not be extinguished by the rebuke of his older brother some people can't hardly get up to the door of the church for their faith is defeated somebody looks at him sideways somebody makes an offhanded remark or something friends don't you realize that's just a devil trying to block you from your blessing [Applause] just brush that thing aside and come on into the house of God and say I'm here to worship God amen because David you know I imagine as a boy going down here saying man I just can't wait to see a fresh I just just I I'm gonna see a book of Acts being written as the god of Israel gives the armies of Israel more victories so in his mind he was thinking oh my I just can't wait to get there and see what's going on but when he got there he found the picture the scene was very different than what he had imagined but I love David I love David as a character in the Bible because to me he represented even in the Old Testament a Spirit-filled believer he was a man after God's Own Heart so the the power of God was expressing itself through him as both in a prophetic capacity Amen in a Priestly capacity and in a kingly office you see with Friends when the Holy Spirit is moving through the body there's no boundaries there's no limitations because it's God being God through his vessels that he has chosen and appointed to be God so David without even being conscious of it perhaps you know I don't think David went down there understanding The Dilemma David did not have David didn't spend five days there analyzing the problem and going through the self-help section of the Christian library to see what Dr Dobson would have to say no David had a connection to God and as soon as he saw their dilemma as soon as he saw the predicament he put his finger right on the problem in five words is there not a Cause they thought Goliath was their problem but Goliath was not their problem because God had already defeated men far greater than Goliath and kings and kingdoms and armies and all these militaries had come up against Israel and God just squished them God just rolled right over top of them amen so Goliath wasn't the problem the problem was they had lost sight Hallelujah they had forgotten who they were yeah yes sir the Holy Spirit knows amen how to identify the problem [Applause] they forgot who they were they forgot whose they were they forgot what they were fighting for they forgot the history of all that God had done for the people of Israel to even get them to this point hello Church let me say something tonight there is no path back to Egypt [Applause] there is no return to organized religion and denominations for the people of the Living God I know when Israel got out into the Wilderness they said we'll appoint us captains who will take us back to Egypt friend that's a death sentence because you didn't get as far as you got without God's protection and God's provision and you don't have any blessing for going back and all those Nations that you've already marched through and you detour down and burn their cities amen you you just pillaged amen have burnt and ruined and took and took Treasures all those things those people hate you more now than they did when you marched in and you think you're going to March back through there and they're going to patch you on the back and say oh hey oh yeah oh no there's only one way out and that's to go forward the same God the same Pillar of Fire the same prophetic Ministry is going to take us all the way and if any man tells you hey follow me if he's not following that Prophet you don't follow him because he's already dead and what he's looking for amen is sympathy misery loves company and they don't want to die alone [Applause] that spirit amen wants to Rally as many people as it can to follow it and die [Applause] I'm talking about a spirit Hallelujah it is the truth is there not a Cause problem the problem wasn't Goliath problem was they had lost their realization how many sons and daughters of God have become sidelined due to becoming disillusioned caught up in a spiritual fog a lost sense of direction or purpose that finds them going through the motions that describes the armies of Israel when David found them they got up every morning they polished their guns their weapons they probably didn't have guns back then but you know they got up and followed all the regimens that they had learned in the boot camp shine your armor boys tie your boots amen comb your hair the legalism do all these things and you'll be evicted but they were posers they were not real soldiers amen they were hired amen they were paid Mercenaries like some scalawag preachers we got nowadays they're not Shepherds they're harlings they are paid mercenaries who put on the uniform of a Believer but inside they're not actually a believer they're going to the highest bidder yeah hello Church they're preaching for offering they will cancel a small Church to go to a big church they're going to give an account for it someday but the true Servants of God aren't looking at numbers aren't doing it for the income amen they are soldiers through and through they've got a burden for the Lost they've got a burden for Souls they will give you the shirt off their back they will spin themselves into bankruptcy to help their brother and their sister Hallelujah the real Warrior was the shepherd boy [Applause] the real Warrior was the shepherd boy amen who was content to stay in his place [Applause] the place that his father had given him was good enough for him he wasn't trying to be anything you know what eliab was deserting wasn't David's heart it was his own heart [Applause] he was trying to project himself unto David and say this is your motor this is your objective this is why you came down here why don't you shut up and go home David said I'm not going home I'm not going to bow down I'm not gonna bend over I'm not gonna back up I'm not gonna cower and the difference between David and all those others is they were comparing themselves to Goliath [Music] and said we are no match for this Palestine he's taller he's wider he's stronger he's got thicker armor he's got a longer spear but David never compared himself to his problem [Applause] he said it's not even a fair comparison between my God and Goliath that is what distinguished David and separated him from all his brothers as he did not take a last insults personal but he said you're insulting God and I won't stand for it if I die I will die defending the name of the Lord of hosts and the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous Hallelujah they run into it they are safe Hallelujah David never lost sight of the cause Glory Hallelujah David said I'll fight him oh they said you gotta you gotta you got to go through Congressional approval you got to go up to the White House and see King Saul get his Blessing you know David said hey you say whatever you want I'm gonna fight him that's all said now David tell you what I I got this armor I got this nice never been used you know I wear this for the parades and I wear this for the elections and I wear this for the Press events it's never been used David I'm gonna dress you up I'm gonna put my diluted testimony on you that way if you should win the battle I'll get some credit but remember David had the discerner dead on the inside see the problem amen is still being discerned and Saul was very much a part of the problem because Saul's kingship had caused a disillusionment like a fog Amen to be cast over every one of his followers [Applause] [Music] and they were wandering along just following the command of a leader amen who himself was so backslid he wouldn't face that giant and he just he just commissioned a bunch of others to go do his Dirty Work absolutely right David said not me I'm not your agent I'm not your Aaron boy my loyalties and my allegiance go to one foreign I don't need your armor same God that delivered me out of the hand of the bear and out of the hand of the light will deliver this uncircumcised philistine right into my hand this was uh like a form of spiritual amnesia that had polluted the armies of the Living God they were still God's men they were still God's chosen amen God was just as he was he was he desired and he was just as bound to defeat their enemies as he had ever been but when they lost that realization they were neutralized friend Satan cannot change your identity but if he can weaken your understanding of who you are he will sideline you where you just come to church and you go through the motions see and then your objectives change now it's about pleasing the parents please in the pastor oh you know but Tim I'm just doing my duty I've checked off my Christian duties this week oh no no no no no that's a stench in God's nostrils your motivations have to be born out of an actual realization of Who You Are spiritual I'm going to call this brother Stephen you you you're a medicine you're a man of of medical drink spiritual vertigo you know what vertigo is somebody comes in they don't know which way is up they don't know which way is down amen they're just on a collision course when it seems like God himself cannot wrestle the control to place them back on course now the um the illustration I use for this is this okay I um I'm not a pilot but I have taken maybe eight or so hours of of time in the cockpit as a student pilot and I've had Ground School different things like that um and they they talk about this is one of the most deadly conditions that can occur with a pilot is vertigo and this often happens out there there are a couple of different conditions that you can fly in one is called VFR which is visual flight rules it means that it's between the hours of Sun up and sunset so there's plenty of daylight and there's plenty of visibility usually I think it's about five miles there's five miles of clear visibility so you can fly on What's called the visual flight rules and even some planes are only VFR rated they they don't have the instrumentation like the navigation and the uh the altimeter the uh and the uh transponders and things to to do instrument rated flying which is the next level IFR is instrument flight rules and it doesn't matter how dark it is doesn't matter how foggy it is does it matter if it's raining or sleeting or snow or ice none of those things matter because the pilot has the training and the airplane is equipped for those conditions and so they're not relying on their eyes and their ears and how things feel they're trained to rely on those instruments amen which are tuned in to other things like radar towers and and signals homing signals and all these things and those things give them amen the necessary guidance to take them from their origin to their destination safely amen with no without striking any other aircraft so they're trade and then the other is is called instrument meteorological conditions and that's when it otherwise would be visual flight rules but something like fog or a I don't say a low cloud ceiling uh rain different things mean they just can't see well enough to fly visual flight rules and they call it instrument meteorological so again I'm not trying to give flight lessons tonight but I want the natural to type the spiritual because vertigo we We There was a man by the name of John Kennedy who in 1999 flew a perfectly good aircraft right into the Atlantic Ocean because he developed vertigo when you when you when you get when vertigo happens you don't you lose your sense of direction completely and it feels like you're falling so you pull the stick back which can often make the plane go into a stall or it'll feel like you're you're lifting too quickly so you'll push the stick forward and nose dive it right into the ground or right into the ocean amen so they they tell you four things and I'm I'm giving you these four things the natural type and the spiritual number one they tell you if you enter instrument meteorological media meteorological or IFR conditions here are some pointers that even though you may not be raided it can get you through it number one don't rely on your feelings your feelings will lie to you your natural senses will lie to you so that brings me to rule number two trust the instruments they don't lie thank you your feelings will lie but God's word will never lie Hallelujah let me give you one of the unshared readings my God shall supply all of your needs according to his riches in glory [Music] [Applause] oh my see this will get you out of a crisis I I feel it going to Second Chronicles 20 is this okay if I start going too long y'all just start shouting amen real loud I don't know to wind it up oh my second chronicles 20. and it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle then came there some that told Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side Syria and behold they be in uh has has as a container Tamar which is Indira and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and Proclaim to fast throughout all Judah and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven God likes to be reminded of his track record if you want to get in God's good favor remind him of all the good things he has done to even get you where you are right now [Applause] and rule is not thou and rulist not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen whether they know it or not God is still their God is still in control brother Branham said Elijah was Jezebel's prophet whether she realized it or not [Applause] hey I got news for the apostate that are leaving the message William Branham is God's standard and The Voice by which your life will be judged he is your prophet he is your pastor amen he is the standard by which God will judge every man woman boy or girl [Music] [Applause] you don't have to like it but it's I it's a Vindicated message and he's of indicated messenger [Applause] I that's free and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art not thou Our God who just drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave us it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever and they built there in it and they dwelled therein they have built the sanctuary the end for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and crying to the in our Affliction then thou Wilt hear and help and now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount sear whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade oh God had given them a permission slip you know why God will let Satan snap at you Embark at you is to position you exactly where he wants you for for an even greater victory to be realized just a little further down the road so God was sparing Israel's enemies for a greater victory out in the future there I I there may have been things the prophet of God didn't deal with or destroy because God was saving it for later [Applause] amen I'll just I'm just going to leave that right there uh y'all y'all it's it's the way y'all pull I know why the devil don't like you oh my behold I say how they reward us to come and to cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit o Our God will thou not judge them for we have no might oh that's a beautiful recipe when you have expended all of your resources and you feel helpless and hopeless that just paves the way for God to come on the scene and get all the glory we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee and all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children then upon jahaziel the son of Zechariah it came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye habitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jerua ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye steal you don't have to answer the devil's questions you don't have to come up you don't have to go digging amen through the archives of Jeffersonville or Washington D.C and come up with answers just stand still set yourself on the solid rock of God's word and the same God that Vindicated William Branham will vindicate the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] set yourselves stand yeast still and see the salvation of the Lord [Applause] fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground in all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord they worshiped him the night before the victory they knew they were going to see tomorrow that's Faith that's Faith worship Faith verses I'm not gonna wait for the doctor's report I'm not going to wait for the symptoms to lift God is God I am his child I'm praising God tonight for the victory the victory I'm gonna enjoy tomorrow it's a guarantee God has spoken Let the Church Say Amen I am the Lord thy God that healeth a l l oh thy diseases Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah yes God did this oh my [Applause] God oh my I'm I'm lost [Applause] yes I'm not lost now [Applause] you know if you got an airplane you got more than one instrument you got an altitude indicator you got a speed indicator you got a rate of descent and the rate of accent indicator you got a compass you got a magnetic heading you got all these instruments that all say the same thing when you know how to light them all up [Applause] he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust [Applause] surely he will deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou Trust his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler I'm just reading what one instrument says [Applause] I got to come back to that one I'm not done reading second chronicles 20. I'm telling you remember who you are remember how you got here because it's how you're getting home and the Levites and the children of the coethites and of the children of the core Heights stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said Hear Me O Israel and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall ye prosper one of the other things they tell you in your flight training is let go let go of the controls that you think you control just let go most airplanes especially the ones you're learning in like Cessnas and Cirrus and some of the they are built they are designed to be very stable airplanes now I'm not talking about fighter jets and stunt planes I'm talking about the the planes you see most often flying around in the sky because they last the longest they're very stable and even if you put the plane into a maneuver a maneuver that it is not really designed for like a spin or a stall if you will simply take your hands and feet off the controls and reduce the power back to idle the plane will write itself what am I telling you don't go on your feelings [Applause] read what the instruments say they don't lie and Trust the aircraft [Music] [Applause] amen trust the captain trust the prophet that God Vindicated quit trying to figure it all out you're the one putting the plane on a crash course by going by your feelings and trying to fly a plane that will actually fly itself if you just let go let go and let God have his way [Applause] number four call out for help you got a radio there's a control tower and if you place a call out for help the operators in the tower can identify Where You Are yes you may have flown off course you may be low on fuel you may be completely lost but if you could ever get the control tower up on the radio help help mayday mayday when the Tower answers back I have you Hallelujah they'll tell you you got some on that plane called a transponder they say turn the transponder to a certain four-digit reading and when they pick up that signal from the transponder they say we have you we have you on our radar we know exactly where you are we know exactly where you started we know exactly what your destination is we know what your altitude is we know the course you're on [Applause] oh my God hallelujah now I'm back in the flight manual Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted that Noonday we say it tonight A thousand shall follow thy right and ten thousand at thy right side but it shall not come nigh unto thee [Applause] Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee and neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the young lie upon the lion and Adder the young light and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet I love this because he had set his love upon me I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him how with long life will I satisfy him and show him I will show him that's to make manifestly evident Beyond any shadow of a doubt irrefutably undisputedly I will make him I will show him my salvation Hallelujah can I can I just refer to another instrument I I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth remember Paul and Silas in prison that night his praise shall continually be they got God's attention so much so he started ignoring the angels and tapped his foot and you know what happened the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous friend this is better than radar you don't have to dial in a transponder the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and delivereth him out of all all their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save it such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous oh brother I like this one I like this one because the devil loves to work on people if you were God's son and if you were God's daughter why are so many things going wrong in your life you love the Lord you serve the Lord you abstain from things that others appear to be getting by with you're faithful you're devout amen you're consecrated you sacrifice for the Lord and yet all these bad things just keep happening unto you when other people who seem to be hypocrites just sail right through seemingly with no consequence nothing ever go many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all that is the difference however many things the devil throws in my way God has promised me I will overcome a Double L all of those things sickness sadness depression and loss of job loss of family loss of friends whatever it is hallelujah I could be blind dumb deaf and mute and all but dead but I'm gonna rise again Hallelujah because I served a god of the living and of the Dead He's a resurrected savior and he's in full control Hallelujah I'm gonna read that one more time many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken all don't let the devil tell you that just applies to Jesus that's that's a family that's a family benefit that extends to all evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be destined the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate call the control tower call upon the name of the Lord he could identify you you know they've I I will I am wrapping up I'm I'm working my way toward a close but one of the things I was thinking about this evening is they have something on these planes called an elt it's an emergency locator transmitter that if that plane experiences any Sudden Impact or a change of Direction it immediately triggers the signal from the elt and it sends out a homing Beacon that's what is the three Hebrew children that's what happened when they threw him in the fire furnace they were they were impacted by something that should have killed them but it alerted a higher authority and got his attention and he told Gabriel and wormwood and All His chiefest angels I'm going those boys didn't stand for y'all they stood for me and now I'm gonna go down there and he joined his presence to those boys which made them Invincible against the king's devices Hallelujah [Music] amen even if you're off course even if you're off course the tower can say Here's Where You Are that's what this message did for us it showed us where we came from where we're going and if we're off course how to correct they'll often give them they'll say here fly this heading fly that heading amen so the prophet said take off those high-heeled shoes fly that heading boys take off those shorts take off those Fashions amen take off those worldly that fly a new heading if you want to end up safe in the harbor fly The Heading of the word of God amen amen they can actually guide a person with no piloting experience to a safe landing they've done it if you go on YouTube and I don't promote YouTube but you can go and hear exchanges you know there was a man who was flying a plane he had a heart attack and he died midair pilate died killed over dead and his wife got a hold of the control tower she wasn't really a pilot but she got a hold of the control tower and they said oh we got you and they guided her to a safe landing because somebody in the tower knows more than you and if you can trust trust those instructions you could arrive safely at the other side Hallelujah Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight amen oh my God Amen musicians come so they won't think I'm lying amen Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth for Moses Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law those that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this way say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring Christ again from the dead but what saith did the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach back to a prophet's message that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart men believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there's no difference between the Jew and the Greeks see the gospel tears down sectarian barriers National barriers racial barriers cultural barriers the gospel tears that down for the same Lord over all is Rich into all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how so they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent you know what if you've got an issue with me preaching talk to my boss I didn't call I didn't call myself I didn't wake up one morning said God I want to be a preacher I want to suffer reproach and spend time away from my family and take time away from all these other worldly Pursuits and I didn't I didn't I I was sent I was Commissioned I was called of God and I answer to him not to a deacon board or a trustee board or a committee or or headquarters I've got one that I answer to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ how shall they preach except they be sick as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings of good glad tidings are good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the Earth and their words into the ends of the world but I say did not Israel know first Moses saith I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish Nation I will anger you but Isaias is very bored and said I was found of them that sought me not I Was Made manifest unto them that ask not after me but to Israel he saith all day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsang people see Paul's showing them amen he's really shown them the transition of the Gospel from the Jewish race to the Gentiles because Grace came to us now I heard I heard a lot said about Grace tonight and I think I've got just a little more but I'm going to just forego that and just say this a trophy of God's grace how many's ever seen a trophy you're like a hunter or a Fisher you know they they catch a big fish and they say that's a trophy they pay a lot of money they get it stuffed to look like it's alive again and they put it up on the wall and they say that's a trophy but you know something brother brother Robert the the other thing the other they won't just put a caribou or an elk or a a a big buck deer up on they'll put the weapon that they shot it with and brother Brown said your trophies of God's grace was the bullet that got you [Applause] Grace got you God put you on the wall and said I got that one by grace it wasn't his works it was in his righteousness it wasn't his goodness it's not who his daddy was or who his mama was that is a trophy of my grace Satan thought he had him the world thought he had her denominations thought they had him religious systems old churches old husbands old boyfriends thought they had them but I sent an arrow of Grace [Applause] that's a trophy of my grace is there not a Cause by the grace of God there's a bride that's coming out of laodicea that's already been called out by a prophet's message not just to come out of denomination but to come in to Christ the revealed word of the hour you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you are feeding all the unfailing body word of the son of man that is her cause that is who we are that is how we arrived here and that is how we are going into a Rapture not a tribulation yes yes there is a cause yes there is a God yes there is a living Army standing upon the earth and the god that sent a prophet has remained here with the bride [Applause] I have not forgotten I have not forgotten where I was when this message failed me and I will not forget where I came from whose I am and where I'm going by the grace of God I'm going all the way Hallelujah stand to your feet tonight give God the praise that I there is a cause there is a God there is a people and God will defeat everything that stands between you and your inheritance Hallelujah brother Robert David slung that rock I would tell you that wasn't David's aim that was not David Zane that was God's grace directed that rock right into the forehead of that guy and David went up there to that giant pulled his own sword out of his Scabbard sliced his head off and carried him around by the hair I said Look What the Lord Has Done he had a testimony from the thing that once defied him and was determined to defeat him David said I can barely carry this testimony but I ain't going to let nobody take it out of my hands I'm not gonna forget I'm not gonna put it up on the Shelf I'm not going to let somebody defeat my faith cause I know God did this for me this is my Deliverance this is my victory this is my testimony and I'll shout it from the Mountaintop cause I'm gods and I'm standing do you love the Lord tonight ain't God good he gives us so many blesses undeserving that's what we are we ought to thank him love and praise him a little more tonight a whole lot more tomorrow down at the cross where my savior died down where for cleansing from
