I'm going to make him kinged up and I'm going to put a crown up on him and dress him a little different so you all know him. Always follow this fell here because he's cultured. &gt;&gt; Turning loose on the pond, he could honk as much as he wanted to. Every duck could turn his back on him &gt;&gt; cuz he gives an uncertain sound. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But let that little duck has been chosen of God to be the leader. Let him honk and watch them all swore to a revival. &gt;&gt; Where the carcasses, the eagles will be gathered. &gt;&gt; He knows all about it. See, so he uh he has a provided way and the ducks know the provided way. Too bad it man doesn't. &gt;&gt; All right, but that's the way it happens. Now, all right.

So, the lamb had a short week uh this week in school. I don't know what type of vacation they get sometime. So, I had to take the whole crew to go visit auntie who had a baby. So, they all fly.

So the Navy Seal is busy still fighting back. So I'm I'm having a lot to do. So I stay in retreat and you go ahead and do what you got to do. We see them back again on the weekend. Amen. So you pray for them to have a good time. Maybe one day if God's willing, we will do what we got to do. But this time I got to carry a weapon where I'm moving. Amen. A spiritual weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. I'm not preaching tonight. Tonight is brother Tony Allen preaching. Amen. Has been a tremendous help by God's grace singing and deacon and everything. I don't know how he's doing all of them. Amen. But by God's grace, he's doing it right. So, let's go with only believe. You know him. Let's pull on the gift of the Lord and let's hear from heaven tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Keep praying for the construction. Things are moving by faith. &gt;&gt; That's all I can explain you. If I sit down and try to explain you, you will not uh understand what I'm trying to say. Amen. Brother Robert, should I tell the the I don't see probably he went back over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know why I can't keep stuff away from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we we we put uh uh in the construction work of the fellowship hall, we added a shower over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In case the sisters working working. &gt;&gt; So we we thought about you sisters. We thought about all the martas and things. So then we ordered the shower door here. Some of you been there. They saw the shower door over there. So when he came for some reason they took the shower. Brother Michael knows the story very well. They went and delivered that to a neighbor. I don't know if he was on the other side somewhere over there. So, we were looking for the shower door, can't find it, and it rained and the shower door was outside. So, it didn't affect the the door itself, but we call uh the company, we call Amazon, we say, "Hey, the shower door didn't show up here." And the photo they showing where they deliver it looks like in the bush or somewhere. They just drop it. And then, and here we waiting for the shower door over here. So, Brother Micah went all the way there to drag. I don't even know how he got it back here. So, by the time he got there, I already called. They say, "You know what? We're going to send a replacement and everything." So, they send a replacement door. And that's what we, Brother Michael, install over there. So, we got this door and put it back there and sat there. So, we've been calling them. We say, "Okay, now we find the first door. You come and pick it up." They don't come to pick up. Can I stop just here? So, we call the preacher. Amen. And we call again, come and pick it up. We schedule everything. Nobody showed up. Sister UK was here till what was it? 9. Nobody. 900 p.m. Nobody showed up. I call again, come and pick it up. Schedule an appointment. Nobody showed up. I called the third time. They look, they say, "You know what? It's over two month. This is over what is supposed to be done as a regulation. So we going to schedule one more time. If they don't show up, don't call us. &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; They say, "Hold on." They went and talked to the supervisor. They came back. They say, "If they don't show up on first attempt and second attempt, you take it. You stay with it. Uh, now guess what type of prayer changes now? &gt;&gt; Don't come to pick up. And guess what? Nobody showed up. A free door for the fellowship hall. &gt;&gt; It's sitting right there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So you see what seems to be upsetting sometime, &gt;&gt; disappointed sometime, it's a blessing in disguisement. And because of the arrow, we got a free shower door &gt;&gt; in glass. &gt;&gt; God knows how to give you something without you paying a dam. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You remember sister Lily's testimony? If she got everything wiped out &gt;&gt; without paying even a deductible, &gt;&gt; God is able. &gt;&gt; Amen. That anointing is not just on the building. &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's catching up tonight. It's not just on the building. It's also on human being. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he started on human being. The church is really the people. We the one that brought God in this place. If God can do that for a building, &gt;&gt; how much more can God do for you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't deserve it. But by his grace, he's providing everything step by step. This is not the first time. This is a second testimony again. I don't know what is coming out. The way things are moving over there, if I sat there, if I sit down to explain you, you won't even believe how we're moving. It is just God for even the constructor to work with us the way they are working in nothing but God. Amen. So keep praying, keep believing. God is working. Amen. Let's go with only believe.

Oh Lord God, we we lift up our holy hands tonight, Lord Jesus, we just want to say thank you tonight, oh father. Oh Lord God, as we commit this service in your hands, oh father, oh God, we ask that you anoint every scripture. Oh Lord Jesus, every book of the Bible, oh Lord God, you anoint every soul that is in this building tonight. Oh Lord God, anoint everyone that's listening in the visible audience tonight.

Put your hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; You know the song leader wrote the song say victory is mine. &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say joy is mine. &gt;&gt; So that mean if it's mine I don't have to give it up. It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; So when I'm in the valley in my dark spot, I don't have to give that up. &gt;&gt; I don't matter, it don't matter how bad it get, I don't have to give that up &gt;&gt; because it belongs to me. &gt;&gt; It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; If you got your Bibles, let's turn to the book of Psalms. &gt;&gt; As we go to the word, [Music] let's &gt;&gt; go to the book of Psalms. Chapter 82 verse 1. &gt;&gt; If you got it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 82:1 says, "God &gt;&gt; standeth in the congregation of the mighty &gt;&gt; and he judgeth among the gods." I said it. &gt;&gt; And we we going to move on to verse six. &gt;&gt; And it says, I have said &gt;&gt; ye are gods. &gt;&gt; And all of you are children of the most high. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse seven says, "But ye shall die like men &gt;&gt; and fall like one of the princes." &gt;&gt; Let's bless the reading of the word. Lord God, we ask that you bless your word, oh father. Oh Lord God, we that you anoint every scripture. Oh father. Oh God, we commit this service back in your hands. Oh father, I guess you would touch every heart, oh Lord God, that they will receive your word, oh father. Oh God, you say that those that are thirst or hunger for righteousness, oh father, they shall be filled, oh father. Oh God, and we are bringing that petition tonight, oh father, that you will fill our hearts with glad tidings, oh father, tonight. Oh God, we ask that you would bless this service in the name of Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Verse one say God standeth in the congregation of the mighty. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And he judgeth among the gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse six says, I have said ye are gods. &gt;&gt; And all of you are children of the most high. &gt;&gt; Now verse seven to me seems like a reminder. Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you see what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; he he's saying but &gt;&gt; even though I said I have said ye are gods &gt;&gt; and you are children of the most high &gt;&gt; but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes. So that mean he telling to you that you got a corner side &gt;&gt; that you can't get away from that corner side. &gt;&gt; Even though I call you a god but you are subject to that corner side. And we want we want to talk about that tonight. &gt;&gt; Um th those two minds, that spiritual mind and that carnal mind. &gt;&gt; And the name the name of this subject tonight, my subject tonight is come up higher. &gt;&gt; God has already made a way. &gt;&gt; Come up higher. &gt;&gt; God has already made a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we can see, I'm going to try to use this board tonight. &gt;&gt; It fits the purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm going just put verse six. We know what it means. This this is the Psalms verse 6. This is the spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So you know what we dealing with. Then verse seven, this this is your physical. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Or I like to call it corner. And and what I want to draw from this is even though we're Christians tonight and we are God's &gt;&gt; sometimes we'll find ourselves falling in that realm right there &gt;&gt; and that corner mind realm &gt;&gt; and sometimes we get stuck there &gt;&gt; and then we're we're praying and crying out to God and we're trying to get a hold of God but really we have fallen from our position. We are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We don't have no business operating down here. &gt;&gt; Even though we're subject to that, &gt;&gt; but to communicate with God, we got to come up higher. &gt;&gt; We can't stay right here. We got to come up higher into in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; Because in in this mind, in this mind right here in verse 7, it's the physical corner mind. &gt;&gt; This mind tells you that God has to make a way. If you if you see what I'm saying, &gt;&gt; this mind convinces you that you have to wait to that God got to figure out &gt;&gt; how to find an answer to your problem, &gt;&gt; that he got to figure out how to find an answer to your solution. &gt;&gt; And then but and we can come up a little higher &gt;&gt; and we can operate in this mind right here and we can find out that God has already made a way &gt;&gt; and that that's and that's where we want to be at tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think about it sometimes and and sometimes we fall down in that realm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then we we we God will send trouble. &gt;&gt; He He'll send darkness. He'll send all kind of things your way. Why? Because it drives you to pray. &gt;&gt; He sends you to your knees so you can pray. So in that praying &gt;&gt; that you can get that connection back &gt;&gt; and through prayer you can be you can go back higher &gt;&gt; and you can get back in your position that you was at because you want to get back in the congregation of the mighty. &gt;&gt; You want to stay in the congregation of the mighty. That's where your power and your strength come from in the congregation of the mighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. glory to God. &gt;&gt; And that's where the devil sits in that realm and he creates all kind of strongholds. That's why the Bible say you got to cast those thoughts down because they standing in the way between you going higher. So you got to reach up and cast those things down so you can get back to your position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know what? Whole Genesis, we Let's go to First Kings chapter 18. Holy Ghost is sharp. &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Kings. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Help me. Go to First Kings chapter 18. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother &gt;&gt; verse 36. &gt;&gt; I'm going show you how easy it is to be in that realm and then slip down in that corner realm, but it don't change your position. &gt;&gt; It don't change who you are. &gt;&gt; And this is the story of Elijah. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you got First Kings chapter 18, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's see. &gt;&gt; Okay. Wait a minute. First Kings. Okay, there we go. Second Kings. But we got to we got to stay in the spiritual realm tonight. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where we are called to be at. &gt;&gt; And it says, "And it came to pass at the time of the offering &gt;&gt; of the evening sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That Elijah the prophet came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Isaac, and Israel, &gt;&gt; let it be known this day, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. that thou are God in Israel. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word. &gt;&gt; And it goes on and say, "Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God &gt;&gt; and that thou has turned their heart back again." Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and it licked up the water that was in the trench. And verse 39 says, "And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, "The Lord, he is the God." &gt;&gt; He is the God. &gt;&gt; The Lord, he is the God. &gt;&gt; God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 40 says, "And Elijah said unto them, take the prophets of Baal and let not one of them escape." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And they took them, and Elijah brought them down to the brook, Keshan, and slew them there. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, I want you to move I want you to I want you to move over to ver chapter 19, &gt;&gt; verse one. &gt;&gt; Move over. Now he he just called fire down. Just just just threw all the prophets. So So we know that them things can't be done in the physical realm. &gt;&gt; So he was operating in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; But wa watch how fast he slide down. &gt;&gt; Watch how easy it take for him to slide down. In chapter 9 verse one &gt;&gt; it says and Ahab told Jezebel &gt;&gt; all that Elijah had done &gt;&gt; and with the how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. Verse two says, "Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time." &gt;&gt; Then she go a woman. This he go ahead and say in verse three, and when he saw that, he arose and went for his life &gt;&gt; and came to Beeba with belonging to Judith and left his servant there. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about a man of God who just left the presence of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He got he got a he got a word from Jezebel that saying she was going to take his life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, he find himself on the run. Go to verse skip over to verse 17. &gt;&gt; Verse 17 said, "And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of Hazel shall Jahu slay. And him that escapeth the sword of Jahu shall Elisha slay." God was telling Elijah, I have already made a way &gt;&gt; to take care of Jezebel. You don't see Jezebel name in the scripture, but that scripture covered her. God was letting him know that he was already he she already taken care of. So take your mind off of her and what she's doing. You stay focused on what I told you to do. You stay focused on where I sent you. Don't worry about Jezebel. I don't made no way to take care of her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, God provided way for this day, &gt;&gt; 1964, &gt;&gt; paragraph 8, it said, God always has had a way. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Always. &gt;&gt; There is two ways. &gt;&gt; That's our ways or his ways. &gt;&gt; God has a way for today. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. For he's always made a way for everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God at the beginning know the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he has laid out his scripture &gt;&gt; for each age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that age when it comes along Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now don't fail to see this. &gt;&gt; He says that age when it comes along, &gt;&gt; usually the ministry is so mixed up &gt;&gt; in isms and so forth &gt;&gt; and traditions till it's a million miles away from the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. And he says, "And then God always sends someone on the scene, &gt;&gt; a prophet." &gt;&gt; And this prophet, God never changes his system. &gt;&gt; He never changes his ways. &gt;&gt; He always does it the same way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always has. &gt;&gt; He must do it in this time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And through this, God works and vindicates that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I spoke to you last night, he says, God doing his own interpretation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God needs no one to interpret the word to him. &gt;&gt; He interprets it himself. That's right. &gt;&gt; By vindicating it, &gt;&gt; making it real. &gt;&gt; And when God said he that he'll do a certain thing, then he does it. &gt;&gt; There is no more question to it. &gt;&gt; That's the way he does it. &gt;&gt; So God has made a way for us. &gt;&gt; God loves his children. &gt;&gt; He loves his people. &gt;&gt; He wants to help them. &gt;&gt; He wants to help you more than you want help. If you can just get that in your heart &gt;&gt; that God is more willing to help you than you are to help yourself. &gt;&gt; But he has a way &gt;&gt; and that's the only way that he'll work is through his way. &gt;&gt; You must come to his terms, &gt;&gt; not your terms. &gt;&gt; His terms. &gt;&gt; You want it a certain way, but he gives it to you his way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God's provided way tonight. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's let's flip to the book of Genesis, &gt;&gt; chapter one. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Chapter one, verse 26. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why you Why you finding that? You know, the prodical son found himself in the same situation. &gt;&gt; You know, he he had the mind that he had when he was home before he left. He was already in the spiritual realm. &gt;&gt; He was with the father. &gt;&gt; He was with the father. &gt;&gt; But he left the father to go in the world. &gt;&gt; So he slid down to that physical cornal mind. But the bible said when he came back to himself when he came back to himself &gt;&gt; but the only mistake he made he didn't come up higher enough. &gt;&gt; He came up a little higher. He asked his father, "Can he come back as a servant?" But that's not high enough. That's not high enough. He asked his father, "Can I be a servant?" And his father said, "That's not high enough." Sometime the eagle go down in the valley and she'll flap her wings and then she will come up higher. But sometime we don't jump high enough. But the father quickly corrected that thing. He say, "No, you are my son. I'm going to put you back in the position. I'm going to put you back where you belong. &gt;&gt; Don't short change yourself tonight. Don't short change yourself tonight. You belong in the congregation of the mighty. Don't short change yourself tonight. Just because you got a sickness and you can see symptoms, don't short change yourself tonight. I tell you to come a little bit higher. Come a little bit higher. You might be taking medication tonight, but I tell you to come a little bit higher because in that realm, you don't need no medication. Come a little bit higher. You are healed by his stripes tonight. That's what this mind tell you. I am healed by his stripes. Come a little bit higher tonight. Why? Because God has already made a way. &gt;&gt; He's not making a way. He's already made a way. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to deal with tonight because that's what Christians struggle with. &gt;&gt; We struggle with that. &gt;&gt; We we feel like when we approach God, we don't approach him the right way. &gt;&gt; We we approach God like he got to go in the laboratory &gt;&gt; and create a custom &gt;&gt; situation to defeat your situation. &gt;&gt; But I ask you tonight, what more can he do? &gt;&gt; What more can he do? &gt;&gt; What more can he do? He's already made a way. &gt;&gt; So that's the way we got to approach him tonight. Knowing that whatever we need, &gt;&gt; that whatever we ask for that he has already made a way for it. &gt;&gt; All we got to do is wait for that appointed time. &gt;&gt; I think I was talking to a brother a week ago and um I said, "You know what? It's it's funny how we can go to the doctors and we can trust the doctor. &gt;&gt; We we we go on there with our symptoms &gt;&gt; and we already know &gt;&gt; we we know &gt;&gt; that the doctor has a list of medications &gt;&gt; that he going to go through to prescribe you. &gt;&gt; So what I'm trying to tell you, he ain't going to invent nothing new. &gt;&gt; He ain't going to go make no new medicine for you. &gt;&gt; What I'm what I want you to see, he going to give you what he already have. He going to give you what he already have. &gt;&gt; But yeah, we walk in there and we take them at their word. But not one time do we ask the doctor, "Lord, I see what you got, doc. I see the list of medications you got, but can you go make me some new medicine?" We don't do that. We take whatever he give us. &gt;&gt; And that's the way we got to approach God. We got to portion like whatever we need, he already has it. There's nothing special he has to do. [Music] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1, let's go to verse chapter 1 verse 26. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet constantly talks about how everything started in Genesis &gt;&gt; was the beginning of all things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And what I want you to do is u go to verse 26. And it says, &gt;&gt; it says, "And God said, &gt;&gt; uhhuh, &gt;&gt; let us &gt;&gt; make man in our image." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After our likeness, &gt;&gt; "And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And over the fowl of the air, &gt;&gt; and over the cattle, &gt;&gt; and over all the earth, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. So what I what I what I want you to see is that man he created man in his image. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And and the the definition for creating means bringing something new into existence from nothing. &gt;&gt; Taking a thought &gt;&gt; and bringing it into existence. &gt;&gt; And let's move on to chapter two verse 7. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Verse seven says, "And the Lord God formed right &gt;&gt; manhuh &gt;&gt; of the dust of the ground, right, &gt;&gt; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, &gt;&gt; and man became a living soul." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you if you will back up, back up into verse uh five. I want to make it live a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Back up to verse five. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Chapter 2, verse 5. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Verse five says, "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew, for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there was not a man &gt;&gt; to teal the ground. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, this looked like a potential problem. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; God created everything. Everything was good. But when they got to this garden and he said there was no man. Now this looked like a potential problem. &gt;&gt; But verse seven said, "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, &gt;&gt; and man became a living soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, what I want you to draw from this is that potential problem that it looked alike, &gt;&gt; that he didn't have a manh &gt;&gt; to till the groundh, &gt;&gt; he had already made a way for that. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; Even though you couldn't see that man, &gt;&gt; even though you couldn't see that man, &gt;&gt; he was already there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God had already made a way. &gt;&gt; Apply that to your life tonight. &gt;&gt; Just be just because you can't see the solution to your problem. Just because you can't see the answer to your problem tonight don't mean it's not there. God had already made a way for what you need tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; Already done. &gt;&gt; God had created everything &gt;&gt; that he needed, &gt;&gt; right? And then he formed it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; when he needed it. &gt;&gt; Did that make sense? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying, the answer to your problem already exist. &gt;&gt; It already exists. &gt;&gt; He already has it. So he saves it into that appointed time. &gt;&gt; He saves it to that appointed time and then he he forms it and he releases it to you. &gt;&gt; So our job is to just wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. We we're not battling where it coming from or it or do it exist. We already know he made a way. So just wait on it. &gt;&gt; Just wait on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah 55:8 it says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts." &gt;&gt; Neither are your ways my ways, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse 9 say, "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, &gt;&gt; so are my ways higher than yours." &gt;&gt; That's right. and my thoughts than yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Psalms, chapter 23. Turn to Psalms 23. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can rest or not knowing that he already made a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Verse one says, "The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; I shall not want." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He leadeth me beside the still waters. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to look at that. &gt;&gt; He said he leadth me. &gt;&gt; So if anybody is leading you &gt;&gt; that mean wherever you going &gt;&gt; they going to get there first. &gt;&gt; I want you to see that tonight. &gt;&gt; If he is leading you Wherever he's taking you, &gt;&gt; that means he's going to get there first. &gt;&gt; So, so if he leads you to a test, &gt;&gt; if he leads you to a problem, just rest assure and know that he already got there &gt;&gt; because he's in the front &gt;&gt; and then he comes back and he walks in you, &gt;&gt; then he be a defender behind you. &gt;&gt; He already got to your problem. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So why do we worry? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So why do we worry? &gt;&gt; Why do we worry about our circumstances and our situations? God say he lead us to those things. &gt;&gt; He's getting there first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's getting there first. &gt;&gt; Now I can understand the testimony now. It don't matter where I go. As long as you with me, long as you doing the leading, Lord, I know you already got there. And then and with you getting there before me, I know you already made a way. &gt;&gt; Because just his presence makes a way. &gt;&gt; Just his presence makes a way. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at Joel. Let's let's look at the process and and it's it's amazing how you can read the same scriptures, the same stories over and over and you can see different things &gt;&gt; and God God will show you different stuff. &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Job verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm in chapter one verse, we're going to start at verse six. And see, the enemy don't want you to see how these things work. &gt;&gt; Verse six says, you got to say, amen. &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord." &gt;&gt; And Satan came also among them, and the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro &gt;&gt; in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." Verse eight says, "And the Lord said unto Satan, has thou considered my servant Job, &gt;&gt; that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that fearth God &gt;&gt; and escapeth evil." Right? &gt;&gt; Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "Doeth Job fear God for not." &gt;&gt; So basically what he's saying, he only serving you because of the things he got. &gt;&gt; The only the only reason he praising you because of his riches. &gt;&gt; That's basically what he was saying. So that's why his request was he said, "If I can take those things away from him, &gt;&gt; then I can get him to curse you." &gt;&gt; So that that's basically what he was saying, &gt;&gt; right? So what what I want want to draw from this is that Joel wouldn't dare to discuss this. &gt;&gt; It was God and Satan. &gt;&gt; So we talking about a test &gt;&gt; that God is negotiating &gt;&gt; with the devil. &gt;&gt; And Job ain't got no say so. &gt;&gt; Job ain't got nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; But God is negotiating this test. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, so what I want you to see is that it don't matter when this test make it to Job. God had it first. &gt;&gt; God had it first. God negotiated the terms. He sought the conditions. He sought the governor. He sought the limits. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And and then and then God God began to call out what he couldn't do. He said, "You can do this, but you can't do that. You can do this, but you can't do that. It's kind of like when you go to the airport, your bag got to go through customs. &gt;&gt; So, what Satan wanted to do, he had to go through customs. God had to God had to go over it. And he looked at it. He and he he he looked at it. He said, "Well, all of us are made different." &gt;&gt; Throw that in. Everybody can't handle the same thing. &gt;&gt; So, so Satan desires to take your life. He desires to finish the job. But God goes in &gt;&gt; and he and he looks at it. Okay, you want this son right here. You want my son right here? &gt;&gt; Well, let me let me look and see what are the limitations of this son. &gt;&gt; Let me see what the limitations of this son. &gt;&gt; And he looks in there and if Satan got a request, &gt;&gt; if he requesting to do something &gt;&gt; that you can't handle, God takes it out. &gt;&gt; He plucks it out. &gt;&gt; He takes it out in the contract. &gt;&gt; He move it. He say you can do this, but you can't take his life. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I got more work for him to do. So you can't do that. It's a reason. And he he do each and every one of us like that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He analyzes our situation, our condition. He know how much you can handle. That's the reason he said, "I won't put no more on you than you can bear." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, he answered the Lord and said, "Do Joe fear God for not? &gt;&gt; Has not thou made a hedge about him &gt;&gt; and about his house? and about all that he have on every side. &gt;&gt; So, he was letting God know that I wasn't just checking checking Job out, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; But I was checking everything out. &gt;&gt; I was watching his house. &gt;&gt; I was watching his children. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I was watching his wife. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I was watching everything that was connected to him. &gt;&gt; And and God say, "Okay, I I see your request. I'm going allow you to touch those things. I'm allow you to take the children, take the wife, but I can't let you take Jo. &gt;&gt; See, he wanted to wipe Job all the way up. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was watching everything. And that's how he do you tonight. &gt;&gt; He ain't here to just torture you. He'll torture your kids. &gt;&gt; He He'll go anybody in the house, anything that connected to you. That is what he want to do. Steal, kill, and destroy. Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "But thou has made a hedge about him &gt;&gt; and about his house." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And about all that he have on every side. &gt;&gt; Thou has blessed the work of his hands. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And his substance is increased in the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he have, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, &gt;&gt; all that he hath is in thy power. Only upon himself &gt;&gt; put not forth thy hand. &gt;&gt; So Satan went forth from thee. First Corinthians chapter 10:3 says, "There hath no temptation &gt;&gt; taken you, &gt;&gt; but such as is common to man." &gt;&gt; That's right. Say, "But God is faithful, &gt;&gt; who will not suffer you to be tempted. &gt;&gt; Above that you are able." That's right. &gt;&gt; But will with the temptation also make a way to escape &gt;&gt; that you may be able to bear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He already made a way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He already made a way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message of spiritual food in due season, &gt;&gt; my brother &gt;&gt; in 1965, &gt;&gt; paragraph 40, it says, "That's what these people had done in the days of Elijah, gotten away from the word. They thought they had the word, but they didn't have it." He say, so notice during the time that he was going to punish the unbeliever, he made a way for the believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. The same thing he does each time. &gt;&gt; In the days when he was going to destroy the world by water, he made a way of escape for Noah. &gt;&gt; In the days that he was going to drown Egypt, he made a way of escape across the sea for his people. How God makes his way. And and where there is no way, he is that way. &gt;&gt; He is that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can turn to the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Turn to the book of Daniel. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And all scriptures are inspired. &gt;&gt; And we found out that sometimes as Christians, we can have testimonies of of stories that don't be in the Bible. Your your testimony can be the the first testimony. &gt;&gt; Your testimony can be the first testimony. That's why you should always testify because you don't know who need to hear your testimony because later on down the road they might find theel in that same situation and can't go back to the Bible and relate to no scripture of nobody that had that situation. So through your testimony now your testimony becomes a scripture. &gt;&gt; Now they got a tie post to hold on to. Well, if my brother went through that, God can bring me through that. If my sister went through that, God can bring me through that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Daniel chapter 3:15. It says, we know this story real well. Real well. We know this story. He said, "Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, the flute, the heart, the sack, butt, soldery, &gt;&gt; and dustr, and all kinds of music, &gt;&gt; you fall down and worship the image which I have made." Whale on. But if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "Shhatterite, Mach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; we are not careful to answer thee &gt;&gt; in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able &gt;&gt; to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. And he will deliver us out of thine hand, &gt;&gt; O king. &gt;&gt; But if not be, be it known unto thee, O king, that we would not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury &gt;&gt; and the form of his visage were changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So he began to look at them different. &gt;&gt; So he began to see them in a whole different way from what from what he was looking at them because of the stand that they took. &gt;&gt; Because of the stand that they took. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it than it was want to be heated. And he commanded the most mighty men. Look who he called. &gt;&gt; He called his most mighty men &gt;&gt; that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; Now, his his request to to make this furnace hotter &gt;&gt; didn't even affect Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; This request only affected his strongest men. &gt;&gt; And we going we're going to see that in a minute. &gt;&gt; Verse 21, it says, "Then these men were bound in their coats, their hoozing in their hats and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace." &gt;&gt; Therefore, because the king's commandment was urgent. So, this this was nothing he planned. This was something he decided to do at that moment &gt;&gt; because of the stand. He decided to do that right then and there. &gt;&gt; So, so, so when you stand for this word, the the the enemy will come up with something right there on the spot. &gt;&gt; Right there on the spot. He don't need 24 hours to come up with something. He come up with something right there on the spot. &gt;&gt; So, see, we see who we dealing with here. Yes, sir. And then he said, "Because the king's commandment was urgent &gt;&gt; and the furnace is seeding hot, &gt;&gt; the flames of the fire slew, those men that took up Shar, Meshach, and Abednego." &gt;&gt; That was your sign right there that God was already there. &gt;&gt; We talking about the same fire, &gt;&gt; the same flames that the Hebrew boys w got cast through. That's right. &gt;&gt; The mighty gods died. So that tell you about that that God was already there. &gt;&gt; He had already made a way. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and these three men, Shadrach, Meite, and Abednego, they fell down bound in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. They was in the presence of a higher caller. &gt;&gt; The fourth man was already in the fire. &gt;&gt; So what did they do? They fell down. They worshiped the fourth man in the fire. They began to worship him while they was bound. So, so when the king looked in there, no longer were they bound. They was loose and they was worshiping it. Walking in the fire. Walking in the fire. They was walking in the fire. But that was an example to you and me. When you find yourself in the fiery furnace, fall on your knees. Get on your knees and begin to worship God. begin to call on his name. Say, "Lord, I know you here. I know that you able." And begin your praise and worship. Then you begin to loosen your chains and then you'll be free and you can walk. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You begin to walk in the midst of your trials. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be bound just because you in a situation. You don't have to be bound because circumstances come on you. You got power to loose. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not when you get out the furnace. You got power to loose. &gt;&gt; While you in the middle of the battle, while you in the middle of the fire, you got the power to loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No longer will we be bound tonight as Christians. No longer will we be bound. We got power to bind whatever we want to bind on earth. We got power to loose what we want to loose on earth. We got that power tonight. Don't let that balance or that trial get you trapped. Don't let it take your vision off. You got the power. &gt;&gt; You got the power. &gt;&gt; But it's to worship. You got to worship when you in that trial. You got to lift your hands up. You got to give God praise. You got to call on his name. You got to recognize that you are in the presence of a higher calling. You got to realize that there's somebody greater than you and I and that he's already made a way. &gt;&gt; They wasn't worshiping because they didn't know how they was going to get loose. They was worshiping because they know he already made a way. They knew he was in the fire. They went to worship him. They knew they was all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Applause] The Hebrew boys, &gt;&gt; see the See the guards that cast them in the fire. &gt;&gt; The the test wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; The test was for the Hebrew boys. &gt;&gt; That's why the fire slew them. &gt;&gt; It wasn't their test. &gt;&gt; You don't want You don't want to touch nobody else better. You you don't want what God got for somebody else. &gt;&gt; It was the Hebrew boys test. &gt;&gt; It was not their test. &gt;&gt; So they got involved with something that didn't even belong to them. That trial belonged to the Hebrew boys. That test belonged to the Hebrew boys. That fiery furnace belong to the Hebrew boys. stand right there. &gt;&gt; Everything that have ever made it to you, &gt;&gt; every test, every trial &gt;&gt; that has ever made it to you &gt;&gt; and that have ever will make it to you, &gt;&gt; God has already made a way. [Music] There's nothing that's going to make it to you that he has not already paved the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that and that's the mind you want to have. &gt;&gt; Only this realm tells you that he already made a way. &gt;&gt; And when you up there, you can worship in the midst of that trial. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can shout hallelujah in the midst of that trial. Cuz sometime it's going to be sometimes you going to walk in here and you gonna freely &gt;&gt; freely be able to lift your hands &gt;&gt; and shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's going to also be some days &gt;&gt; that when you come in here, &gt;&gt; it's going to take everything you got &gt;&gt; to lift them same hands &gt;&gt; to shout that same hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But just know he already made a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And God God been showing us this all through the scriptures &gt;&gt; from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you worried about? I have already made a way. &gt;&gt; And the enemy always come to reverse &gt;&gt; whatever it is that God does. So he talks you into that God has to find a way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That he got to create a way. No, he already created. He already He just waiting for that for that season. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That he will form your solution to your problem and he will bring it into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in the book of Revelations chapter 4 &gt;&gt; verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; John says &gt;&gt; after this I looked &gt;&gt; and I and behold sir &gt;&gt; he say a door was open in heaven. He's saying, "The first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet sir &gt;&gt; talking with me, &gt;&gt; which says, "Come up hither, &gt;&gt; and I will show thee things which must be hereafter." &gt;&gt; So God was telling John, I can't talk to you down there. &gt;&gt; I can't communicate with you down there, John. &gt;&gt; John, I need you to come up &gt;&gt; in the spirit. I need you to get caught up in the spirit so I can communicate with you. God can't talk to you down here. He needs you to come up, &gt;&gt; get in the spirit &gt;&gt; so he can show you the things that he want to show you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 4, jump to verse 10 for time sake. Jump to verse 10. Revelation 4:10. It says, "The four and 20 elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou are worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory, honor, and power. &gt;&gt; For thou has created all things for thy pleasure they are and were created." The song was sung tonight. My hallelujah belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Your hallelujah don't even belong to you. &gt;&gt; Your worship don't even belong to you. &gt;&gt; All these things belong to God. &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelations, &gt;&gt; let's go to chapter five. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Verse one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch John. God is dealing with John. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book &gt;&gt; written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice &gt;&gt; who is worthy to open the book &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals thereof." &gt;&gt; Looks like a potential problem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here we go again. And it looks like a potential problem. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon." &gt;&gt; And John says, "And I wept much, &gt;&gt; because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, needed to look thereon." &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me, "Weep not &gt;&gt; weep not." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It says, "Behold, &gt;&gt; the lion &gt;&gt; of the tribe of Judah, &gt;&gt; the root of David, &gt;&gt; have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof." So the elder were telling John, "John, why are you weeping for? Why are you weeping for that?" What look like a problem to you? Let me show you. God has already made a way for this. &gt;&gt; He has already made a way for this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse six says, "And I beheld sir, &gt;&gt; and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." That's right. &gt;&gt; And he came and took the book &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sit upon the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 8 says, "And when he had taken the book, sir, &gt;&gt; the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, &gt;&gt; having every one of them harps and golden vows full of orders and which are the prayers of saints." And they sung a new song, saying, Thou are worthy to take the book &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nations, &gt;&gt; and has made us into our God, kings and priests, &gt;&gt; and we shall reign on the earth. God had already made a way for you to be kings and priests before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, that was your position. &gt;&gt; So if you if you not operate for that, come up higher tonight. Come up higher. Increase your prayer life tonight. Come up higher. Increase your prayer life and come up higher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can't leave Revelations 10 out. Revelation chapter 10. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we we see how this thing is working all together. &gt;&gt; Verse um chapter 10 verse one. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And and and he says here, he said, "I saw another mighty angel &gt;&gt; come down from heaven." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head. And his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roar. And when he had cried, seven thundersed their voices. &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders had ordered their voices, I was about to write. John said he was about to write. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "But and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, &gt;&gt; seal up those things &gt;&gt; which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." &gt;&gt; What I want you to see, even though the seven thunders was right there, it wasn't the appointed time yet. &gt;&gt; The seventh angel had not came on the scene yet. &gt;&gt; The prophet had not come on the scene yet. But the seven thunders that the prophet needed, God had already made a way &gt;&gt; before he got there. He had already made a way. He had already made the message before the messenger got there. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Already there. Yes, my brother. In the message Revelations chapter 4 part 1 1960 he says now immediately paragraph 117 he says now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work here he went on up into heaven he said I'll show you what's going to be after this &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; after the church ages he said John I can't talk to you down there no more cuz I left him down here he said I've come up higher Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come out here with me." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll show you what's going to take place hereafter." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Caught up in the vision, caught up into glory. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God was saying, "I can't show you these things &gt;&gt; with a corner mind." &gt;&gt; He can't He can't show you these things with a corner mind. You got to come up higher. &gt;&gt; You got to come up higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn let's turn to the book of St. John chapter 17. &gt;&gt; We're going we're going to try to tie it up. &gt;&gt; We're going to try to tie it up. St. John chapter 17 verse one. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; See the Bible say you have not cuz you ask not. And sometimes, even though it already exists, &gt;&gt; and that God already made a way, &gt;&gt; sometime you still got to ask for it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with asking for it. &gt;&gt; Verse one says, &gt;&gt; "These words spake Jesus." &gt;&gt; And he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, &gt;&gt; the hour is come." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glorify thy son. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; That thy son also may glorify thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then verse two says, he says, "As thou has given him power over all flesh, &gt;&gt; that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him." &gt;&gt; And verse three says, "And this is life eternal, &gt;&gt; that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Verse four say, "I have glorified thee on the earth." &gt;&gt; He says, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And verse five is what what I want you to see. He says, "Now, oh father, glorify thou me &gt;&gt; with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." &gt;&gt; So Jesus began to ask for something &gt;&gt; that already existed. He didn't ask God for a new glory. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask him to create a new glory. He said, "I want that same glory. &gt;&gt; The same glory that we had before the foundation of the world." So when I find myself sick, I don't ask God for a new healing. I ask him for that same healing. &gt;&gt; Lord, give me that same healing that me and you had from the foundation of the world. So whatever you need, you be specific about it. God already made a way. Ask him for the specific thing that you need cuz you came from God and you going back to God. Everything he had before the foundation of the world, he already made a way. &gt;&gt; Already made a way. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm close up with this quote right here. this quote God's provided way in 1953. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 45. It says, "There are some people one time that was worried about Jesus going away." And Jesus said, "Don't worry. I've made a way for you." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; A little while and the world won't see me no more. &gt;&gt; Yet you will see me &gt;&gt; for I'll be with you &gt;&gt; even in you &gt;&gt; to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Well, how you going to be with us &gt;&gt; and not in the world?" I can't understand. Says, "I tell you what you do. You want to get in God's provided way." Sure, you just go up there to that at the Jerusalem and wait there until the Holy Ghost comes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, how's the Holy Ghost going to come?" "I don't know. &gt;&gt; You just go there and wait." &gt;&gt; He said, "How long we going to wait until?" He said, "Well, do you mean two hours?" He said, "No, until." He said, "Maybe just a week." "No, until." Until what? Until you endure with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand of clap for praise. He's already made a way. &gt;&gt; He's already made a way. &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads with a quick word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Dear heavenly father, oh God, we are thankful tonight, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord God, you have took your scriptures, oh God, and your word, oh father, and you have came down and you spoke to your children, oh father. Oh God, you have shown us in your word, oh God, that why should we worry, oh father, oh God, when you have already made a way, oh Lord God, we pray, oh God, in our approaching to you, oh father, that we would go to you, oh God, knowing that you've already made that way or provided that which we need, oh God. Oh Lord God, help us to be specific when we come to you, oh Lord God, that when we ask for something, oh God, knowing, oh God, that it ain't something that's so far-fetched, oh God, that you got to go out and look for it, oh father, but know and trust and believe, oh God, that you have already have what we need, oh Lord God, you say those that couldn't you must believe that you are who you say you are, oh Lord God, and that you are rewarded for those who diligently seek you, oh Lord Jesus. Oh God, we are diligently seeking you tonight, oh father. Oh God, some somebody needs joy tonight. God, we asking for you to restore joy tonight. Oh Lord God, we asking for you to restore happiness tonight. Oh Lord God, Lord God, we put these things before you tonight, oh Lord God, that you would strengthen every feeble body in here tonight, oh Lord God. Oh God, that you would touch and heal every sickness in the building tonight, oh Lord God, that we will walk out of here, oh Lord God, claiming that healing that you had already given us from the foundation of the world. Lord God, we be careful to give you all the praise, honor, and glory if we lift your name up on high. Oh God, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we thank you and we love you. Amen. Put your hands together. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Stephen, &gt;&gt; wonderful. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God in water. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; God already made a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, your solution is before you even get to the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you send the most mighty men of your army to bond normal people? In other word, if you want the uh to make it simple, if they want to catch you to arrest you, they going to call a Navy Seal. &gt;&gt; Why are they calling a Navy Seal &gt;&gt; to to to arrest you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Usually, if you call a national guard, it means that you're dealing with something at the highest level. &gt;&gt; So why do you call the elite &gt;&gt; to come to normal people? So Nebuchadnezzar knew &gt;&gt; that these people are not really normal. They were mighty men. So you need the most mighty man &gt;&gt; to come and handle mighty man. You see the the the the other side knows you even better than yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. demon knew Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and they were recognizing Jesus Christ and they were confessing Jesus Christ and the one that had a problem were religious people &gt;&gt; to recognize Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God already made a way. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It was sung already in the song. Brother Brandham say singing was already preaching the gospel. The gospel was preached. Did you talk to brother Tony about singing you made a way? He didn't even talk to brother Tony. So that is the Holy Spirit confirming to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spend your time right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray it up. Stay under the spirit. Stay consecrating yourself and keep yourself right here. This is where you see things differently. This is where you believe things that a normal human being can never believe. Never never believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. When everybody say it's impossible, that's exactly what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got a problem when we were trapped in this place right here. Amen. And the Holy Spirit is telling you, be aware of this mind right here because the flesh here, this is where your carnal mind is. And the Bible say the corner man is enmity. &gt;&gt; In other words, they don't get along. And God is telling you be aware of that corner man. Amen. Maybe one day the Lord will allow us. I was meditating today. Just meditating. I say one day I need to talk to you about what you call reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. What you call reality. What is reality? Amen. It's a big big trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What you call facts. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what God is challenging tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Either you're going to believe God or you're going to believe the corner mind. But the corner mind is very limited. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no way this one can declare God. This was not meant to declare God. &gt;&gt; It was meant to declare this world, &gt;&gt; not God. &gt;&gt; Go listen to the message the six sense &gt;&gt; and the super sense and you will begin to to grasp what is going on. Amen. &gt;&gt; If they take your eyes away, Amen. I can preach from the morning to the evening and tell you there is a pulpit here. &gt;&gt; You won't see it. The reason why is you don't have a decoder &gt;&gt; to see the pulpit &gt;&gt; until you get the eyes. Then you can tell. But you may use your hand to touch it. &gt;&gt; But you must have a preview of the pulpit before your eyes were taken out. &gt;&gt; Let's stop right there. Amen. Amen. Maybe one day we will get into what you call reality to kind of free you and start believing things that this brand here is so tiny like this to believe it. That's what God is talking to us tonight. Amen. Live in the first realm. You are God. Just know you've been trapped into a body and that body have a corner man. And the corner man will continue to make you think and treat God like a man who who who who is surprised about your your trial. In other words, God didn't know and you you the one explaining to God, you know, you know, you didn't know what is happening to me. God already knew. God already made a way. God knew we going to be in this church right here. We're going to be in this building. He knew the color of the carpet. Even when we were sitting and then going back and forth to decide the carpet, he already knew. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why prophetic people were different because they could see the vision and brother Brandham will sit down until grandma sit on the chair. &gt;&gt; You can pray pray pray pray. Brother Brandham is just sitting waiting for grand. He won't pray until grandma is sitting there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what? because he climb up higher to get the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And when you get the mind of Christ, you are behaving differently. You become an oddball even though you living in the human being. That is what God is telling us tonight. It's it's go back home and then go through the scripture. You can take the life of Gideon. You will see how Gideon was in seven and it took the angel of the Lord to pump Gideon to bring him out like mighty man of a me mighty man of valor. But was God looking at you or was God looking at you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God is telling us tonight. He already made a way for your situation. I know sometime when situation take longer, we get used to it. We cope. We adjust. We rearrange everything to accept it. But God can challenge those situation and show you that he already made a way. It doesn't matter how long it took it takes. It doesn't matter how dark it is. It doesn't matter how odd it is that no one ever came out of a situation like this. You can break that circle and just tell him that there is no way you can tell me that you made a way and there is no way for me. There got to be a way for me to come out of this situation. There got to be a way for me to receive what I'm believing. Amen. There got to be a way. That's the reason why you are talking to me tonight. There must be a way for me to come out of this situation. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to warn you. If I didn't start this church, God started this church. If you ever have an idea of coming to this church &gt;&gt; and get settled, &gt;&gt; you will leave this church. &gt;&gt; This church will never let you settle. &gt;&gt; When you climb, you think that okay, now you there. Tomorrow God pushes you up again and you go back up again and tomorrow God. So in other words, don't never think like, oh, now we have arrived. Now we go to church. We see this is what happened all over the message. People got used to the church. They know their spot. They know where they sit. They left their coffee uh stuff and the church become like a religion. They go on Sunday just sit listen to the sermon. It's like a preacher shouting, shouting, shouting and we come out and then we go back again and it become a religion. This one is different. &gt;&gt; Whenever you feel like okay now I feel like ah I progress in my spiritual walk. Tomorrow he comes and show you again another thing. So you keep climbing right until we will leave. In other word, don't never That's why if you don't keep up with what I'm telling you, you're going to get tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you pray one hour, he will push you to two hours. If you pray two hours, he will push you to three hour. God will never never stop. Amen. That's why the scripture continue to unf for 4 months. Lord came tonight again to show you that again with Psalm 32 I mean 82 let's push it again. So never never think of this church like okay we have arrived we have a fellowship oh now everything is something will come back up if we have the fellowship oh the building full now we need another building ah another project of course have I said something wrong &gt;&gt; have I said something wrong because when you see that oh now everything is good boom another project come up what is going on again no it is God remove spirit of religion out of this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. This will never become common to you that you know okay we sing one song, two song, three song. That's why you get trouble sometime when when when you get here and it's brother John singing more than one song or or who who the set leading song a different way because you want to put God in a box like in a stuff like this. No no no no no no. It won't happen like that. Amen. It won't happen like that. It will continue to change because he's the present God. He is I am &gt;&gt; the God of the present day. In other way, last Sunday was last Sunday. This coming Sunday is another Sunday, a new day, another fresh message from the Lord for you together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So remove the religious spirit &gt;&gt; of getting used to church and getting comfortable. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is squeezing me. It's squeezing the deacon. It's squeezing the trusty squeezing everybody. In other words, you cannot sit to say ah now I feel like no. Every time you nerve, every time you want to preach here, you begin to feel that tension again. You can never get to a point you say, "Ah, now I know how to preach. I can just go there, go sleep." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That pressure, that tension have to continue to be there all the time. Amen. And we going from glory to glory, from glory to glory, from glory to. And then when you look behind, you say, "Oh my God, look where I was." Look, look, look, look. Look at me. Three, four years. You can do that. That's true. &gt;&gt; But remember, you have not reached there yet. &gt;&gt; That's why the rapture have not happened yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay on the spiritual mind. This is what God want you to understand. God already made a way. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you tonight, Father. Lord, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, for such a powerful message, Lord, that you have made a way, Lord. You did it in Genesis. You did it, Lord, Father, for the Hebrew children. You did it, Lord, Father, for Elijah when he was so scared. But you already had a solution for Jezebel, Lord. Father, you did it, Lord. Even when we were looking for a redeemer, Father, you already knew. You had that lamb already prepared, hidden, Lord, Father, in the holiest. And it was just about time for the lamb to come. And John was weeping. And Father, John have to talk to John to tell John not to weep because, oh God, you already made a way, Lord. Father, help us up Lord to remain spiritual, to remain consecrated, Lord, to live in a world different, Lord, Father, than what we are living now, Lord, because this time is a gross darkness, but it's a most glorious time, Lord, that you are requiring your children, Lord, Father, to come up higher so that you can show to us vision, dreams, and things can be more clear in our life until when we wake up in the morning, we know for certainty without Lord guessing left and right what to do and what is the next step to take in our life. Father may you strengthen our brother. Lord may you protect him Lord Jesus. May you give us all travel mercy and remove any attack from the world of darkness. Father I know that when we have started to get deeper into this channel of prayer, the enemy is Lord troubling left and right. But father tonight you spoke to us that you already made a way. And Lord, we are asking for that way that you have made for this time of the season that you may dispatch again heaven, Lord, and remove the enemy completely away from us, Lord, and keep us center into your word, Lord, and protect us. We are committing everything and the remaining of the weak unto the hand. Those that needed travel mercy, Father, may you give it to them. our family, Sister Lily, and Lord Father, remembering again, Lord, Father, Sister Edie, where she is. And there is nothing that is impossible. Whatever she's going through, Lord, Father, we've uh uh uh her mother, Lord, our precious sister, you already made a way, Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you're not a God of near only, but you are also a God of a far away. Father, Lord, may you touch, Lord, Father, and come down over there in a supernatural way. Lord, we thank you for everything. Touch what they said. Lord, Father, we rebuke the enemy that have come against him, Lord. Father, we pray that you lose him completely in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, protect us all under your blood, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead, John. Thank you. You don't have to worry &gt;&gt; and don't you be afraid. Joy comes in the morning. Troubles they don't last always. For there's a friend named Jesus who will wipe your tears away. &gt;&gt; And if your heart is broken, &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say, "Oh, I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. With Jesus, I can take it. With him, I know I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. &gt;&gt; It's already done. It's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. Victory is won cuz it's already done. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's already Y'all can be dismissed this evening. God bless you. [Music] It's already done. The battle is over. The victory won.
