[1:29:37] US stop in the office of the father if
[1:29:42] you want to see God you need to go see

[1:29:48] in the office of the son if you want to
[1:29:50] see God where do you go Jesus you need
[1:29:53] to find this man right here where he is
[1:29:56] that's where go God is because in him
[1:30:00] dwelleth what the fullness in other word
[1:30:03] in Jesus empty
[1:30:05] Heaven of God until when you go to
[1:30:09] heaven God is not there all God was in
[1:30:13] Christ so when Jesus sleep that's where
[1:30:15] God
[1:30:16] is if Jesus is in the word God is in the
[1:30:20] word if you want to see God you need to
[1:30:23] see Jesus

[1:31:18] now man is the third person of what the
[1:31:22] Trinity man is the third person of what
[1:31:26] the Trinity so when we talk about the
[1:31:28] Holy Spirit dispensation it is our
[1:31:34] dispensation Jesus had his own

[2:07:52] food do don't you think Jes Jesus knew
[2:07:56] there was no food he's God he knows
[2:07:58] everything then Jesus is telling his
[2:08:00] disciple give them food in the place
[2:08:03] where he knows there is no food in other
[2:08:05] words Jesus trusted more in the disciple
[2:08:09] than the disciple trusted in
[2:08:13] themselves I don't know if you get me
[2:08:15] Jesus knew that you can do it that's why
[2:08:18] he said the work that I do
[2:08:22] you can do it even
[2:08:27] greater how can you do something greater
[2:08:29] than the Holy Ghost because you are the
[2:08:32] Holy
[2:08:35] Ghost you are the third person of the
[2:08:38] Trinity you can do
[2:08:42] more my friend it is Bible it is Bible

[2:08:55] do in this office in this office it will
[2:08:59] be
[2:09:00] greater so this office will do things
[2:09:04] bigger than this office but this is God
[2:09:06] in human flesh but God in human
[2:09:10] f is more
[2:09:13] poent
[2:09:17] [Applause]
[2:09:18] Hallelujah if God
[2:09:21] in a clean vessel can do certain things
[2:09:25] how about God in an unclean
[2:09:32] vessel the problem it's very easy to
[2:09:36] believe God in a vessel who never
[2:09:42] SE are we together he answered them he
[2:09:45] said them do what give you them to eat
[2:09:48] and they say to him the Beast yes

[2:10:06] we got $5,000 people in a

[2:12:22] Jesus finished there is no
[2:12:25] boat are we together are we together and
[2:12:29] Jesus didn't
[2:12:31] panic because the God in Jesus was
[2:12:35] guiding the
[2:12:38] Beast are we together then Jesus
[2:12:42] suddenly begin to head toward the water
[2:12:45] hey

[2:12:52] and suddenly he enter
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:13:02] water he begin to catch up on his text
[2:13:05] message because he had so many messages
[2:13:08] that came but he's walking on the
[2:13:11] water and when the disciples saw they
[2:13:18] say can I continue can I continue I
[2:13:22] don't think I'm going to preach what I
[2:13:23] wanted to preach can I
[2:13:26] continue verse 49 but when they saw him
[2:13:30] walking where upon the sea they suppos
[2:13:35] he had been what a spirit a ghost and
[2:13:38] they did what and cried out for they all
[2:13:41] saw who him and were how trouble and
[2:13:45] immediately he talk with them and said
[2:13:48] to them what be of good cheer it is who
[2:13:51] it is I what Be not Afraid watch
[2:13:53] carefully my friend and he went up to
[2:13:56] them into the sheep and the wind did
[2:13:59] what ceased and they were so amazed in
[2:14:03] themselves beyond measure and wonder
[2:14:06] verse 52 are you there with me
[2:14:09] for they consider not the miracle of
[2:14:17] what the L
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:21] the miracle of the L God was already
[2:14:24] beginning to remove them from
[2:14:27] Humanity to begin to believe things that
[2:14:30] are bigger God is bringing them back to
[2:14:34] [Music]
[2:14:34] [Applause]
[2:14:37] Adam and God gave them the ball and they
[2:14:41] didn't do it and he demonstrated and dun
[2:14:43] it he said okay now that I D it they
[2:14:46] will understand and God moved to a
[2:14:49] different level but because they didn't
[2:14:51] catch the first level they missed the
[2:14:54] second
[2:14:57] one are we together are we together that
[2:15:00] is Mark 6 let's go to Mark 8 that's
[2:15:05] good God us his man as his partner am
[2:15:09] Mark 8 if you there you can say amen
[2:15:12] amen verse one in those days the
[2:15:16] multitude being how very great a great
[2:15:19] multitude remember multitude what it
[2:15:21] means you remember the definition and
[2:15:24] having nothing to eat I believe it was
[2:15:26] 2,000 or something having nothing to it
[2:15:29] Jesus called his disciple to him and
[2:15:31] said to
[2:15:33] them I have compassion on the multitude
[2:15:37] because they have been they have now
[2:15:40] been with me three days and have nothing
[2:15:43] to
[2:15:44] eat if I send them away fasting to their
[2:15:48] own houses they will fent by the way for
[2:15:52] diverse of them came from far off Jesus
[2:15:57] knew they were hungry but instead of
[2:16:00] Jesus acting he now goes back to his
[2:16:04] partner that's
[2:16:07] right amen and begin to explain his
[2:16:10] partner his
[2:16:12] concern in other word Christ is looking
[2:16:15] for a solution from a human
[2:16:19] being amen
[2:16:21] amen Jesus didn't say I'm God I'm in
[2:16:24] charge when he look at the situation he
[2:16:26] say this is a big situation a disciple
[2:16:29] come here I have a
[2:16:32] problem this great multitude have been
[2:16:34] with me three days I don't know what to
[2:16:37] do and to send them they're living from
[2:16:39] far off some came from Florence some
[2:16:42] came from
[2:16:44] chareston what are we going to
[2:16:47] do and now the opportunity after month
[2:16:51] this is
[2:16:52] Mark and the disciple miss it
[2:16:56] again that's right my friend look at
[2:16:59] verse four and his disciple answer him
[2:17:04] from
[2:17:05] where the Beast again can a man satisfy
[2:17:10] this man with bread here
[2:17:13] where the first miracle happened where
[2:17:17] the second miracle happened where Jesus
[2:17:20] is the same
[2:17:21] y today and if it's a Wilderness A
[2:17:25] wilderness a same problem a same problem
[2:17:28] and the first problem he already showed
[2:17:30] you how to do it and the next one he
[2:17:32] bring you back again and give you again
[2:17:35] past the ball
[2:17:37] again because man is his partner what
[2:17:41] did man
[2:17:42] do he begin to reason again and Jesus
[2:17:45] say you know what give me the
[2:17:48] ball Jesus Took the ball and and dark it
[2:17:52] [Applause]
[2:17:55] again Hallelujah are we together amen
[2:17:58] are we together amen are we together
[2:18:00] amen jump to verse uh uh uh 15 I'm going
[2:18:04] to show you something I don't think I
[2:18:07] can preach what I want to preach let's
[2:18:09] go my friend I'm going to finish I have
[2:18:11] to stop with this one let's go verse 15
[2:18:14] if you thereare you can say amen amen he
[2:18:16] says and he charged them saying take
[2:18:19] heed be aware of the leav as soon as he
[2:18:24] say
[2:18:25] leav in other words somebody say
[2:18:28] tomato automatically somebody's watching
[2:18:31] a hamburger
[2:18:33] moving as soon as he say Le to them
[2:18:37] bread he said and the 11 of the
[2:18:40] Pharisees and of the 11 of who her and
[2:18:44] the reason remember that person doesn't
[2:18:47] reason the one who reason is the Beast
[2:18:50] and the reason among them themselves
[2:18:53] saying it is because we have no
[2:18:57] bread to make it worse go back to verse
[2:19:01] 14 now the disciple has forgotten to
[2:19:04] take
[2:19:06] bread Jesus intentionally allowed them
[2:19:09] to forget
[2:19:11] again amen neither have they in the
[2:19:15] sheep with them more than what one Lo
[2:19:19] twice God multiply bread the third time
[2:19:24] they left bread they begin to murmur
[2:19:27] again we together amen verse 17 and when
[2:19:31] Jesus knew it he say to them why reason
[2:19:35] you because you have no bread perceive
[2:19:38] you not yet neither understand have you
[2:19:43] your heart have you your heart yet
[2:19:45] Harden like I said yesterday God was
[2:19:49] making this miracle to soften their
[2:19:52] heart because they were brought up under
[2:19:56] a
[2:19:57] beast so God need to break down the
[2:20:01] reasoning and begin to bring them toward
[2:20:04] verse
[2:20:06] six amen amen he says Verse 18 having
[2:20:10] eyes see you not and having ears hear
[2:20:13] you not and do you not
[2:20:16] remember now Jesus is remanding them
[2:20:19] when I br the Five Loaves verse 6
[2:20:22] chapter 6 among 5,000 how many basket
[2:20:26] full of fragment took you up they say to
[2:20:29] him 12 second miracle and when the seven
[2:20:33] among
[2:20:34] 4,000 how many basket full of fragment
[2:20:36] took you up and they say seven time he
[2:20:39] reminded them of
[2:20:40] both and he said them and he said to
[2:20:43] them how is it that you do not
[2:20:46] understand so three times the partner of
[2:20:51] God are not understanding follow me my
[2:20:54] friend I'm going to take you to the
[2:20:56] airport I can't preach what I want to

[2:21:04] want to associate them to his
[2:21:12] work amen are we together amen and Jesus
[2:21:15] knew their potential because Jesus said
[2:21:19] all that the father have given
[2:21:21] me he knew all of them were children of
[2:21:24] God he knew all of them came from
[2:21:29] eternity Jesus look he said I got a

[2:25:49] Jews did
[2:25:50] took up stones again to Stone him
[2:25:53] because the Jews could not understand we
[2:25:56] got many Jews in the
[2:25:59] message I know when I'm preaching this
[2:26:01] thing they're going to take this sermon
[2:26:03] and send it continue sending it I got by
[2:26:06] the message and by the
[2:26:08] Bible and if you begin to T Stone to
[2:26:12] shoot no problem they did it for Jesus
[2:26:16] Christ they got upset of the revelation
[2:26:21] of
[2:26:22] God living in a
[2:26:26] man are we together are we together
[2:26:30] don't worry my friend he says verse uh
[2:26:33] 32 Jesus answered
[2:26:36] them many good works because this is
[2:26:39] what you like the miracle the healing
[2:26:43] and then I'm a great preacher many of
[2:26:45] those amen have I showed you from my
[2:26:49] father for for which of those work do
[2:26:52] you Stone

[2:27:17] work we son you not for the first and
[2:27:21] second pool no problem because we are
[2:27:23] benefiting healing we Stone you not but
[2:27:26] for

[2:27:33] because
[2:27:36] you being what a man make yourself
[2:27:41] God the problem that the Jews have with
[2:27:44] Jesus is because Jesus
[2:27:48] claim that he was

[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:55] flesh Jesus claim that he was the second

[2:29:26] why are you praying for them I pray for
[2:29:29] them I pray not for the

[2:30:05] God in other word it belongs to
[2:30:11] who because him and the father they are
[2:30:14] follow me my friend that's why Jesus

[2:30:20] and what I have is my father in other
[2:30:22] word me and my father we are the same
[2:30:25] person are we together he says and I am
[2:30:29] glorified where in them Jesus is

[2:30:35] at the boat Jesus is glorify where in
[2:30:41] them Jesus is not glorifying himself for
[2:30:44] him to be glorified he need to be
[2:30:47] glorified where in when Jesus entered
[2:30:50] somebody then he
[2:30:52] [Applause]
[2:30:53] be can I continue can I continue can I
[2:30:58] continue few amen can I continue amen
[2:31:01] jum to verse 20 my friend we just said
[2:31:03] the airport you there amen that was the
[2:31:06] prayer for the disciple brother Steven
[2:31:09] that was for the disciple why because he

[2:31:17] listen to his prayer verse 20
[2:31:20] neither pray I for this
