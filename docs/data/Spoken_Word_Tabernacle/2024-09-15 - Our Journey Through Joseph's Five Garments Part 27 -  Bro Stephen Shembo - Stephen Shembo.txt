so once we get it and everything is fixed we'll give it to you you will check the chat and then respond quickly so we can uh get a head count uh in addition to the people that are coming in amen I read a quote last Sunday and it seems like we need some clarification on the coat so bear with me as I'm going through this this kind of coat when he comes he shakes message people glory to God Amen in question and answer 1959 in December the 19th brother brandham say now you okay you ready my brother okay he says now my wife she is my correction amen can you say amen amen he said now you Brethren what I'm talking now you Brethren you know Brethren what I'm talking about she said the people in the back last night could not hear me because I was speaking into this thing and now before I get started I'm going to try something so something happened in the church where brother brandham was probably preaching or I don't know or testifying but I'm assuming preaching and the people in the back were not hearing well so sister maida went and talked to brother Bram about and it looks like she talked to brother Bram after service amen amen then brother Bram came back to church are we together and brother brandham said now I wonder if that is better brother Bram is assessing what she taugh him is that better way back in the back or is this better is this better now honey that is one time I got a mark against you so in other word everything was working fine and B I'm turning to a sense of humor right don't worry my friend now they say that is better all right oh my that is a woman that is a what a good one so it's a sense of human because it's been a long time since I had one she is usually what right so by this court I say that as a woman God put you beside a man for a responsibility you cannot condone with your husband when he's doing something wrong you are there to point out to your husband and tell him that that place you were wrong you the one that were wrong you the one that need to apologize in other words you need to help your husband to come back again into line amen so the point I want to clarify here it doesn't mean that when the minister is preaching out out out are we together somebody need to interrupt the preacher and say you wrong the correct order are we together when a minister is preaching and something is wrong you go back to the Deacon amen can you say Amen am and you write whatever you want to write on the Note amen are we together and the Deacon will bring it to the pastor and the pastor will read the Deacon's note and assess it amen if you want to make a correction during service sir are we together so if something is going on somebody's sleeping somebody's disturbing you just go back to the Deacon because they are the police of the police officer of the church amen and they they want to assess it because they can transgress the Sabbath without being guilty are we together Jesus spoke about the the PRI in the Tabernacle the work in the day of Sabbath but before God they are Guiles amen because they are in office are we together so the correct order when I'm preaching something is not working go back to the Deacon talk to the Deon and the Deacon will assess it if something is wrong with the son go back over there talk to the technician and the technician will assess it that is God's order are we together with it but God are we together but God cannot be cornered into one place right that's the truth are we together are we together let me read this brother Bram says this in question and answer after the seals he says but he God was so determined that I would not make that error come on now brother Amen brother Bram was preaching the hills and while he was preaching the Hills Brother Bram was about to make mistake and brother Bram say God was so determined that brother Bram cannot make a mistake the Seven Angels were there when he was preaching the seals all the angels that made the config that made that constellation every single Angel was there so they were watching brother Bram not to make even one mistake that's why brother BR say if there is anything that I ever preach that is inspired it is those seals are we together and brother Bram say God was watching over it so that he doesn't make a mistake but something happened yes sir follow me carefully my friend brother brandham say they call me back to read the rest of that verse yes sir and I just felt like something just rolling over me there and say go back go back so brother Bram was about to read the scripture and then the Holy Spirit came upon brother Bram and told Brother Bram do not continue reading the scripture go back again go back again are we together now brother Bram say I thought go back what stop right now and start praying for the sick but what is it what have I done are we together so when the Holy Ghost came and gave brother Bram the signal brother Bram was confused he didn't know which direction to go whether to stop preaching and then pray for the sick or what does he mean by go back in other words the first alert came straight to the prophet are we together are we together but because the prophet was having a hard time that's right that's right decoding the alert of the Holy Spirit are we together the Holy Spirit didn't go to the Deacon sir did you sleep well did you sleep well the Holy Ghost went on the congregation and anointed somebody else not the deacon amen there is a correct order but you must be flexible despite the order you must be flexible are we together and brother Bram say and I just and and just I started to reach for that somebody in the audience we don't know who it is somebody say what read that verse over again the Holy Spirit touch somebody in the audience and the person spoke [Applause] and say brother Bram read that over and brother Bram said thou was God using that person not the Deacon that person brother Bram say he say read that verse over and I did what read I read it over and there at the bottom of this question there was revelation six see I read the first that sounds like it the first see and they sang a new song but then here see what he was the next coming on down has redeemed us sure he was the Brad the Rapture sent and here certainly the lamb had the book in his hand he had done left the Throne of the meditor grace and you see how the Holy Spirit does what watches that because exactly that is the the same thing I said the other night so the correct order if something happened go see the Deacon but God in his sovereignty sometime there is no time to go check the Deacon God May anoint somebody on the congregation and that person will say Pastor go ahead and read that scripture over it is still the holy spirit in his sovereignty are we together so we got the order and we got the flexibility of the spirit I want you to understand both of them are we clear together any question about this courot no my subject this morning is our journey through Joseph's five garment part 27 let's stand for the reading of the scripture we keep the order but it remain flexible amen if not you will quench the spirit amen amen it's a great lesson for preachers you might have note and the Holy Spirit can take you off your note amen if you rigid you're going to give your mind but the mind that you're trying to give is exactly the word that you had but if you follow the flexibility of the spirit you will now minister to his children according to what he want his people to hear that day are we together so we got the order and remember God is sovereign how can you justify the money of Mary Magdalene go ask God not me go ask God he's the one that sanction it go ask God go tell God why did you take this money this money was bad you know the origin of this money yes Lord the money was used for the burial of Christ you need spoken word I hope I'm stretching you now right because what is coming up is so strong okay I will try to see if we can touch the surface we clear I changed the background so we will help the camera let's go to Psalm 82 have you seen how we stuck in one scripture and we can't go nowhere [Laughter] oh glory to God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given to me as a man but Lord when it comes to your word and to interpret your word you only take the Holy Spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children and father be the one speaking and the one hearing and the one interpreting and bless us may you touch this technology and may every distraction that can move Lord your children from the focus of the word be completely out of this place Lord protect us and bless us and those that are streaming in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah I know we got some private interview I'm trying to squeeze you somewhere so my schedule is over booked so I will try by God's grace to squeeze you somewhere so just be patient with me amen amen yeah if I sleep 4 hours 5 hours it's really really yummy good so you have8 hours praise God for amen amen amen amen it's a life of a seal my friend Psalm 82 verse1 you there God stands in the congregation of the mighty you know what it means now he God Jud J es among the gods to judge these people you got to be a God Amen am you might be seated verse six I have said ye are gods are we together amen ye are Gods let me Rite it to your way cuz you love it that way amen I have said ye are Gods amen and all of you whoever is this whoever is in this group all of them no exception in other words God is talking to a congregation and he say ye are gods and all of you without any exception so nobody can say he was looking this side he was not looking at me because if he say he are God thought somebody will say he didn't look at that side so God made sure that all of you whether I look at you or not right whether I call your name or not all of you we clear now in other word everybody is included all of you amen you are children these Gods you are children of who the most high of the most high amen amen when we say you are Gods he trouble human beings me being a God yes sir he start a problem then God added he say Children of the most high this one human being will say Amen because they are are children of the most high if you say they are Gods but they are children of the most high then the human being say Amen are we together are we together I spoke this many times and I'm going to repeat it again the leader of an elephant is what the leader of a dog is what a dog the leader of a human is what a human say say can I continue let me change my word the child of an elephant is what an elephant the child of a dog is what a dog the child of a human is what a human the child of the most high is what Hallelujah can you say loud use the terminology let me start it again come on man let me start it again the children of an elephant are what an elephant the children of a dog are what dogs the children of human are what human the children of the most high are who high so you are most high [Applause] are we together now are we together now a child of a most high is most high [Music] he's not child of the most high he is most high I know you struggle I know very well my friend the Bible says in Psalm 83:18 that man may know that th whose name alone is who Jehovah remember Jehovah was reflected in Moses Ministry correct God told Moses I'm going to start something that I never uh I mean uh uh demonstrated to Abraham to Isaac none of them the first one I'm going to start with is you you would know me as Jehovah we went through that and Jehovah means god producing Gods we went through that that's why God told Moses the revelation of Jehovah means you Moses you will become a God to Pharaoh are we together and the bible say that whose name alone is Jehovah Kama are the most high over all what the Earth so Jehovah is the most high uhhuh Genesis 14: 19 and he blessed Abraham mized and say Blessed Be Abraham of the most high God who is possessor of Heaven and Earth so the most high is the god that own Heaven and Earth you are his child [Applause] the universe belong to the most high sir this entire Planet belong to the most high and you are the child of that most high brother Bram says in the evidence of the Resurrection he said Lord God most high you put the sun in its orbit you put the moon come on the Stars you measure the Earth in the palm of your hand and blue of star you are God so the most high is a god of creation [Music] he is a Creator [Music] we are getting somewhere my friend in Psalm 57:2 the Bible say I will cry unto God who the most high unto God that perform all things for who for me the most high is the god that will perform everything for you amen everything that you have need of make sure you a child of the most high because if you child of the most high the most high will perform everything for you in other word God will do it for you children of the most high God are most high amen where do you get that my friend in Luke 8: 27 the Bible say and when he went forth to the Land There met him out of the city a certain man this is Legion which had Devil's longterm and wear no clothes neither a board in any house but in the tombs are we together I checked the correct number of Legion Legion means we have 6, 826 demons Amen in one person and if you notice when that person spoke we didn't hear 6,826 voices am we heard one voice in other words somebody can say one thing but whatever they say is coming out of a an assembly of devils we go there could be a devil of pride a devil of hatred a devil of jealousy and those devil can mix together and come up with one speech don't worry my friend that's demonology let me leave it alone amen and when he saw Jesus Legion he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice say what have I to do with the Jesus the son of God who

where I want to go are we together are we together let's go to the Book of Luke to save some time my friend amen Luke 15 hey God Revelation is not complicated ah it's complicated to the unbeliever amen amen amen amen uh Luke 15 if you thereare you can say amen amen verse 17 thank you my friend I'm going to do something okay bear with me okay because I want this to sink well if I can get this first part the second then we drive deep okay yes go uh let's start to verse 14 instead I know there he says 17 let's go by 14 and when he had spent all day there Rose a mighty famine in the land amen go to verse 13 I have to follow the boss my friend he says and not many days after the younger son gather all together this scripture have layers so so you peel there is one okay and the deeper you get the more powerful it is when you on a superficial level you cast out Devils when you dig deep into a certain level you don't cast out devil devil leave you [Music] I don't know if you get me when you are arguing when you are arguing about the Jews pray here and the Samaritan pray here you can cast our devil but when you get deeper that thou a prophet if you notice that woman Jesus never prayed for her in other word the more you recognize yourself you are releasing energy and whatever was connected to you will begin to feel the Heat and the more powerful the heat you will see the the devil getting off of you because the the the energy is coming powerful do you understand what I'm saying get a bunch of frogs put them on the on the road and get that road connected to electricity let electricity pass there you don't teach the Frog how to go out let God awaken you the devil will know because it's a spiritual language the devil are Spirit they will recognize the other Spirit are we together that's why the third pool is a different layer when the word comes he cast out Devils without saying in Jesus name nobody cast The Devil out of the prodal son he just came to himself and when he came to himself there was no more devil to block him they coming back to himself releas him from the devil [Music] [Applause] you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen not the casting of devil their truth when the truth when you know the truth the truth is cutting off all the shackles [Music] how many time have you seen have you heard brother brandham looking at somebody and say your name is Angelo you liveing so and so your name and you suffering for this yeah go home and be happy why is standing he say now come you demon of cancer in the name of Jesus Christ that is Pentecostal [Applause] in other word the more brother Bram is revealing your life at the end he said just go home and be happy amen how can I go home and be happy so being happy remove Devils spoken way Tabernacle let's climb up higher my friend amen are we together are we together where are we at my friend he said verse 13 He said uh verse 12 uh verse 13 I'm sorry he said and not many days after that the youngest son gather all together and and and did what took his journey into a what a far off country let follow me carefully the country is closed no is where far far off country so it's not closer way way way way somewhere amen MH amen he say he went into a far off country amen and there he did what wasted his substance with what righteous living righteous living what does he mean what does he mean it means disorderly it's vague Rus means anything that is bad maybe women maybe smoking may be drinking whatever it is follow me carefully this thing is vague it is not specific it's like a book like a bag of trash there is a bag but in that trash there might be a can of tomato a can of whatever but it's just a bag of trash we don't know what is in it all me carefully are we together amen verse uh 14 and when he had spend he had spend all There Rose a Great Famine in the land and he be to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of the country and he sent him into the field to do what Fe SW so he became a servant he himself became a hired servant an employee he got a job amen am amen so the last state of this young man he was a hired servant we okay now yes sir the Bible says that he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his field to feed Swan and he will F he will gladly have filled his belly with the HK that the swan did eat and no man and gave him so his last state he's an employee they send him he got a job feeding this SW a bad job for a Jew brother say that you need a cat You See Me Now verse 17 where we are and when he came to himself he says how many what hi servants if you notice his last state have already conquered his mind [Music] he himself is a hired servant and the way he begin to think is at the level of a hired servant are we together in other word his father has created a scar in him are we together there is a reason why he said the higher servant because he was already a highed servant make sense now we clear verse uh uh 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my father have breed enough you see he's looking at the servant that's that's the position he's at amen and to spare and I perish with Hunger follow me carefully I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him father I have Sinn against Heaven his sin amen is against Heaven MH and what my friend and against thee and against thee yes amen have sinen against heaven and against the or in another translation say before thee amen I have seen before the amen the country was far off the son is saying I seen before thee yes the father was in another country how was he sinning in the presence of the father amen what does he mean Heaven are we together brother Bram says this in the message the F seal brother Bram say if God speaks or send you he backs up what you say mhm notice if you are an ambassador for from Heaven All Heaven is how behind you and Heaven is consisted of the word are we together amen so as sin against Heaven he broke the word amen are we together amen you need a prophet to interpret the Bible amen a sin against Heaven he broke the word he broke the Commandment amen is a scripture down there for that because brother Bram is perfectly in line with the scripture he said I sin against in other word he broke the word and I seen before the thee who is the father it seems like whatever he was doing the father saw it are we together are we together verse uh 19 and I am no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of your what hired servants because he's already a hired servant amen remember these servant are hired meaning they can get fired but a son is never hired and a son can never be fired so fall am sometime causes reper in our life until we want to put oursel into a treacherous position are we together are we together verse 20 and he arose just like he said and came to his father but when he was where a great way off when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had what compassion you see we read this scripture back and forth back and forth they say the father have compassion what do compassion me come on Brother come on the father have compassion what does he mean oh the father say oo my baby is coming oh my baby child the younger one the Benjamin William Maran Bram now watch hold that in your mind sometime you don't know what compassion means friend the people are so bound they don't understand Heavenly things we don't see compassion is to do the will of God are we together now your Bible is changing so when the father had compassion of him the father wanted to do the will of God the will of God toward the child that came back to himself [Music] glory to God there is a lot difference between what sympathy and what compassion brother Bram say now do you believe he was full of compassion bab said he was but it's different from the kind of compassion we call compassion there is two different type of compassion one of them is what human sympathy the other one is what Godly compassion Godly compassion is to do the will of God human simpathy throws everything into a what a puddle William Marion BR brother Bram say watch his answer and he say I have no one to put me in the water while I'm coming somebody's better somebody's in a better shape than uh than me I R me and get in there getting uh uh ahead of me he could walk he could go but there is some there could not even walk see and we said he had compassion human sympathy is not compassion no the will no more do no the will will of God is what compassion so compassion number one is do the will of God number two is know the will of God so the father knew the will of God brother pram continues here in the message be not afraid he says the Pharisee and the sanen cot the church question him what about all the rest of these the sick people that were there he said verily verily I said unto you the son does nothing in his himself but what he sees the father doing that does the son likewise that is what compassion compassion is follow do know now it's what follow follow the will of God Amen not human sympathy but what it is too different words Al together sympathy and compassion if he was not Jesus you made a rude mistake when he did that in other word there were thousands of people there that were sick somewhere in a bad shape compared to the man that could not that was sick of the prostate brother Bram say but God entered there and bypassed everybody and went to somebody who was suffering prostate and heal one person and get out that is compassion William Mar Bram he said listen what he said verily verily I say unto you the son after the seal do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing there is what the compassion knowing the will of God and then what doing it now brother brother and put the two after the C so to know the will of God and to do the will of God is compassion so when this father is looking at a child that backslid that took his money and destroy everything coming back the father had compassion in another word the father took on the will of God what is the will of God toward such a child now let's read it when he had compassion he made him do what run are we there fell on his neck are we there and kiss him do you see any rebuke there no amen these are stuff that are done for a good child a sinless one amen but for some reason it's done on a criminal let's continue my friend amen am wait when I get where I'm going amen the Bible says and the son said to him remember this we went through this father I have Sinn against heaven in other word I have broken that commandment in your s and I'm not wor no more worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servant the one he was about to say Amen sir amen bring forth the best robe the best Rob is given to the best child that's right are we together in other word there was something about this boy amen amen that was special and the father lost him under his radar come on in other words a big player to the economy of the father and when the father recuperate that player the father said praise God now the team is going to change because the best player the MVP is coming back [Music] I know what stumbles you because he did bad stuff that's all you have in your mind I will get to the bad stuff amen he said give him the best Rob amen we there he said give him the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on him you know what it means and shoes on his feet and bring here the fatted Cal and kill it and let us eat and be how mered for this son was dead this son was dead amen and now he's what alive now he's alive continue my friend and he was what he was lost he was lost and now he's what and is found do you know what lost me dead means dead in sins and trespasses according to Ephesian 2 let's investigate loss are we there go back to verse four same scripture verse four I need to drive this then we can move if you thereare you can say amen amen Jesus say what man of you having aund sheep if he loses what one do you see the word lose okay one of them does not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after that which is what lost we're trying to get the definition of the word lost amen and until he founds it and when he had found it you see found do you see found lost and found do you see those two words when he founded he lays it on his shoulder it's a mystery there rejoicing and when he come home he calls together his friend and what neighbors and neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost so we found lost and found we clear what is the interpretation Jesus verse 7 and I say to you that likewise amen likewise Joy shall be where in heaven of a what one sinner that have what so lost is a s lost and found is a sinner that have repented amen I'm I'm reading the is my Bible different than yours so lost and found means a sinner [Applause] that has what repented amen a sinner that has repented in other words my child was a sinner he already repented and now he was dead and alive what does dead and alive means do you follow me do you follow me I have to go that way my friend he says let's uh keep your finger right there go to Ephesian 2 because we got to drive this correctly don't worry my friend Ephesians chapter 2 if you thereare you can say Amen verse one my friend you there amen and you has he what Quicken Quicken means to make a love that's right who were how dead in what trespasses and what sin so dead you are dead in sin amen and trespasses and a love means the son was quicken in other word what the father is saying here when we go back to Luke 15 the father is saying that my son that you see is a son that was dead in sin and trespasses he has repented he was a sinner that had repented and he has been quickened are we together are we together if you notice there is no description about what the son did follow me carefully Angel come here put robe on him put this on him put this on him what is the reason the reason he was dead and he's alive what does dead mean dead in sin and trespasses what kind of sins follow me carefully sins plural trespasses plural what kind the trespasses what can the sin and he is a sinner that has what repented sinner is vague because you can be in your life never even drunk any beer but you a sinner so sinner means what means a drag addict a church sinner a prostitute because when we say sin we always look at bad stuff but sin is unbelief if you never believe you are a sinner amen are we together are we together together what I'm trying to show you here is when you question the father follow me carefully the father answer is vague amen you say what did he do he was a sinner that repented what did he do he was dead dead yes dead in sin and trespasses in other word he looks like what happened to the child have affected the memory of the father this is where we driving my friend when you ask the father what did he do he was dead and he's alive he was lost and he's found because when people ask what did he do they want detail when the people come in the message they say sister what happened they want a det and if you say no it's just a problem they don't want that what kind of problem because they want a detail they want to Nick peek everything [Applause] what happened between so and so oh H just pray for them something is going on what really happen what what what they actually asking you is tell me the whole story from Genesis to revelation are we together are we together but when they ask the father what happened he said he was dead and he's alive amen he was lost and his father in other words the father is unable to bring out the detail the child sin before heaven and before the father but when he did what he did it looks like the father lost some data yes he don't worry my friend [Applause] promise me promise me you will give me time and let me dig where I'm going are we together are we together am are we together but there is somebody who doesn't lose data let's see that person glory to God when I'm talking about da there is somebody who doesn't lose bad D [Music] are we together brother Glenn this for the prisoner they will begin to be filled with the Holy Ghost [Applause] are we together are we together Hallelujah spoken word your time is always short brother Greg I don't know what to do do you know Moses kill somebody how can you tell a murderer he's going to be God and where is he going to be God in the place that he he he committed the crime in Egypt not in Palestine in Egypt so when you look somebody say the murderer has come someone else have a different news it is not a murderer it is God are we together let's look at somebody who keep data Lord have mercy on me are we together are we together amen jump to verse uh 25 you see one story how it goes it looks like we we are we we are swimming in honey are we there verse 25 now uh-huh uh Luke 15 I'm sorry my friend verse 25 if you do good here so we s quickly are we there verse 25 now his eldest son was in the Feld ah follow me carefully follow me carefully follow me carefully what was what he did what did he do in a far away country rightous living do you know what he means okay let's go to the father father what did he do over there he was dead and what he was lost and what he's found ah Big Brother what did he do over there sir look in your Bible my friend Big Brother verse 25 he says now his eldest son was where in the field and he came and Drew near to the what and he heard what music and what and dancing music and dancing praise God so when somebody's coming back home there is music and dancing let's keep it safe amen let's go now verse 26 and he called one of the what servants and asked him what these things what in other word what is the interpretation of this party what's going on here my friend let he the servant if the servant will say you know uh your younger brother the bad one that destroy everything let's hear the angels amen amen and he said to him your brother is what your father has killed 27 has killed the what the father C because he has received him what safe and sound that was all they can say what is going on they have received him safe and sound ah let's look at the big brother are we there verse 28 and he was how angry ahhh ahhh uhuh so this act angers someone the restoration your restoration to your rightful place won't make everybody happy amen [Music] some people will rejoice some people will be upset keep that in mind he made the big brother how man your brother was lost and your brother is back you should be happy amen but for some reason you are upset why are you upset abset means there is still something in his memory Lord help me brother are we together are we together brother would you promise me you will give me time right Mama okay let's do this okay let's do this brother Charles I'm just picking up an example give me his money and I went and I took his money and I say I won't pay you brother the Char is upset amen amen mhm are we together okay when brother uh when brother Charles sees me what happened to him why is he upset why is he upset work with me my friend why is he upset you owe himy because his memory brings back something that you have done amen do you follow me do you follow me if I manage am to take brother Charles into a into a an operatory room and perform a surgery in his brain and remove the portion follow me I'm going to get there amen and then remain and then return him back again when brother CH sees me what is he going to see is he going to be upset no why because the memory has been what deleted keep that in mind keep that in mind please keep that in mind we getting somewhere are we together so the younger one when he heard the news he absented him he have not he didn't even see the brother yet just the news he upseted him are we together let's go maybe maybe if he was coming into the house and he would have heard news is like I'm sorry Daddy I won't do it again I won't do it again maybe he will be happy he will say yes he got what he's he deserves that boy need to get something go ahead daddy whoop him up slow my friend slow God is going to deliver you are we going Are We There Are We There amen verse 28 and he was how angry and would not go in therefore his father did what came out he came out and intreated him in other word they have to plead with him amen watch his answer daddy lost found Dead Alive watch who knows the detail and he answering say to his father L many years do I serve you neither did what transgress do you see those word transgress so this father is God transgress I at any time your what commandment commandment the Commandment of the father that's why he broke Heaven broke broke the word amen any time uh I at any time your commandment and yet you never give me a what a k okay that I may make what Mary with my friends he worry more about his friends better than his brother let's continue let me leave that alone jump to verse 30 but as soon as this your son look how he's calling him this your son not your son this your son in other words a specific son not just a son this one when he said this he meant something the bad one are we together this your son as soon as this your son was come which has what devour you're living with what harl stop how did he know that come on I'm asking you a question how did he know the Precision that the man he was with harot so somehow the news was coming and he was keeping a curricul a record of everything that he was doing [Music] are you following me you asked the father what happened he was dead and his house alive he was lost and his house you turn to the younger brother happened he say he finish everything and he play with the prostitute that's right and if you notice the young the older brother is reminding the father are we together in other words the oldest son is telling Daddy what you're doing is not logic that's right maybe you missing the the point here this kind of I mean this kind of case are treated a certain way why because look at what he did are we together so the old son the old son remembers all the hots and everything that happen in detail but the father doesn't remember as soon as the son repented the mind of the father was different so one go remember one remember the furtherest the father can go is he was dead and alive he was lost and his F but the other brother goes beyond that no he spend your money with riers living and to be specific he was going to prostitute one remember one don't remember and based on who remember and who don't remember the treatment is different the one who remember want punishment the one who doesn't remember treat you as a best child are we together are we together where are you going with this are we together are we together that's why before even the son come and spoke the father already responded and remember Isaiah say that it shall come to pass that before you call I will do what answer remember Jesus before he pray his prayer is already answered so we get to reach a point where our prayer must be answer like Jesus prayer are we together are we together are we together let's go to John 17 now you doing good praise God if you thereare you can say Amen you there you there I'm going to rush quickly here verse one amen these word spoke Jesus and lift up his eyes to heaven and say father the hour is come do what glor glorify your son that your son may also what glorify thee we clear there as you have given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him and this

glory that was in him not in somebody else in him that Glory become also in you ah he says verse 22 and the glory which you gave me I have given them that they may be how one even as we are one he's giving us the glory Because by the his glory he will make us one with God in other words the glory of God is now in you you are also God don't worry my friend let me continue you will chw this kind of

given me be with me where I am that I may be that they may behold what my glory so Jesus pray also that you might be where he he will be that's why it's the future home of the Heavenly groom and the Earthly briad number one you must be one like him and you must have his glory and if you are one like him and you have his glory guess what you might as well come and live with him are we together are we together he said that they might me they might behold my glory which you have given me for you love me before the foundation of the world world thank you Lord follow me carefully put your seat belt now are we there mhm are we there amen Jesus prayed that we can be one as he was one and that Oneness brother brandham explained this in paragraph 85 he said be one as I and the father are one yeah be

of God means god it's written right here in the Bible in in John 5 the Bible says Son of God means you make equal with God that's right in other word when Jesus is praying for you Jesus is praying for you so that you can become God and Jesus is praying according to the will of the father but when you realize who you are it will upset the devil because when you are moving up the devil need to cry what have we to do with you jerus that's why when brother Bram was casting a devil the devil say I know William Bram [Applause] the son OFA the devil say I know Jesus and I know Paul the devil must

book of memory Jesus brother Bram is linking your body on Earth with the book of memory the book of memory in heaven in other words the book of me have something to do with your body spoken word he says and his attribute was where knowing that because this son of God raised he would also raise what every son that was forain to his what great child he knew he was if you notice in Psalm 139 verse 16 David say then I did see what my substance yet being what unperfect when you were nothing God saw your substance God saw your material and he says and in thy book all my what members were written

yet there was what none of them so before you were born the way you look sister God a picture of you in the book of his memory [Applause] my friend my friend I got to stop because we are launching deeper to come up on the surface it's a problem okay okay okay let me stop by saying this my friend this book of memory is not the Book of Life [Applause] flight attendant prepare for landing are we together this book of memory is not the book of life I know what is puzzling your mind at this time where did Brother Bram say that where the scpt I know I know message believer I'm giving you time and when I'm doing this I'm letting off the pressure because the airplane you know when you begin to go down you know how it does H that's what I'm doing now heading toward the airport this book of memory is not the book of life it took the Holy Spirit to be merciful on me because I wanted this for a long time until he came and showed me what he was and gave gave me the qu amen amen in the exposition of the churches in the sest church brother Bram say to begin with there is no basis for the claim that the lamp's book of life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called what the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ Book of Life or that book of that book of the living what names are written in it so in the Book of Life the only thing you find is what Nam but in another the book is members [Applause] you see that silence because it's going it's like a missile are we together are we together when brother Bram say that book okay when I go go back to Psalm 1239 it says what thy book you will be mistaken for the book of life but when brother Bram said the book in the church ages brother Bram say the scripture that called The Book of Life that book and brother Bram gave Exodus 32 32-33 it was Moses telling God take me off your book and brother and the Bible say yet now if thou will forgive their sin if not do what me me Moses block me I pray thee out of what thy book which is what and brother Bram say that book here is the book of life because he contained the name of Moses follow me carefully my friend he says and the Lord say unto who Moses whatsoever whosoever have sin against me him will I do what blood out of my book Because The Book of Life only contain what names that are but if you look at this book here it contain the members don't worry my friend Hallelujah in Psalm 56 verse 8 David say thou tellest my what wonderings put that my tears in the bottle are they not in what that book The Book of Life don't contain your tears the book of memory in heaven contain your members and he contain your tears when you are crying God God God somebody is riding your tears when you crying the your tears are put in the book of memory [Applause] are we together are we together in the word none of your prayer is forgotten [Applause] [Music] amen am are we together are we together God remember your prayer he remember your crying he remember who you are and what you are made of but there is a certain part of you that God cannot remember in the book of memory [Applause] there are memories of of you that God remember and there are

father don't change he can't go no father he cannot even use the language of the older brother the father cannot say cannot repeat what the old son because the old son want the father to repeat it but
