wonderful God we serve amen amen y'all y'all can be seated for just a minute we do have a excuse me a couple of testimonies I'm going to ask brother Seth to go first amen sister Vivian has one but she's also going to sing a special for us this morning she's up here we just get her to sing to amen go ahead my brother God bless you Saints amen I'm just trying to keep it short uh because of time um we went for an appointment it was supposed to be a la appointment on Wednesday that's past Wednesday and then after the appointment on our way back home we were called to come back to see the doctor but then it was not supposed to be that was not the schedule and U later we found out what what the reising was um so when we went to see the doctor um he he made something very important to us now let me keep that as a piece now before my wife had a kidney um transplant um a couple of brothers were speaking that we are praying for two brand new kidneys that was what we were praying for and then when the transplant came it was one kidney now trying to join this together now when um we went to see the doctor right after the kidney transplant the doctor was like um we are aiming to see a 50 on one of the lab results because he explained that each kidney can produce a 50 so let's say one produces 50 the second produces a 50 and you get a 100 so when you have just one 50 is okay to operate with so the target was to hit a 50 because it was one kidney now so when we went to see the doctor that's on Wednesday when we're called back to see the doctor the doctors showed us that instead of one kidney producing a 50 we have a 100 and three so we have one kidney with a power of two and even more so we just want to thank the Lord for [Music] that amen amen hallelu Hallelujah Glory oh my goodness isn't he good isn't he [Applause] good Hallelujah that is what God can do for them he has done it for me amen I was here when my husband called me to say he want to go to see The Specialist to change his glasses I said that's good he went and he said H you need not to change your glasses but you have C on your both of the eyes how come we don't have to ask God question all that we know he has has to do it so they ask him to come for surgery on both eyes and glory to God they just used two days to operate the two eyes and by his grace now he can see like a baby and is to the glory of God so I just want to sing to glorify his name I do have a I do have a um a prayer request before so if we could stand as I read this and then we'll get somebody to come up and pray amen

other amen everybody okay everybody okay if you have any relationship with a boy you need to talk to your parent first and let the parent know that you are courting or you are in relationship with a boy or a young girl and your parents will guide you sir but we don't believe in young sisters and young men in this message texting each other calling each other and things like that parent if you

lot of emails I realize I am behind emails and everything so you forgive me there is a whole lot going on a lot of emails coming from any national so please be patient with me as soon as I get a chance I will go through them some of them have difficult question that only pastors need to answer so if it's digging marriage and divorce you need to see a local Shepherd to handle those kind of stuff but I will go one by one by God's grace and try to get into it amen the trusty give me an announcement they want to thank every brothers and sister who made it yesterday I believe for the cleanup exercise so whoever was here to clean up and put everything and organize everything into the trailer back there God richly bless you the little bit of sacrifice that you're making it's not even a little it's a big sacrifice may God reward you 100 fold amen I believe I got everything covered up now let's go to our scripture this morning glory to God now I can go to sleep amen am sometime right in the middle of the night and things are shooting and now you got to go get in the coat and this and this I say I need to get some sleep Oh Glory to God let's go to Genesis chapter 1 very very familiar scripture we want you to prosper young people we want you to be happy we want you to be good gentlemen and good ladies married go home sit down when you say hey baby shower we are all excited the pastor is going to get your gift and bring it to you happily because everything is done correctly that's what we want if your friend your coworker your classmate is interested in the word at the beginning you talk to him if they continue don't continue to talk to them because you're not well equipped to handle that send them to me send them to the Deacon or find a minister in the church or send them to your parent you say okay we noticed that you want to know about our word and everything send them to the parent and say Daddy I have a classmate a coworker who's interested in the message let Daddy and Mommy handle that let the Deacon handle that let the pastor handle that but don't play around and try to stay because the majority of the time they will play with your ego you will hear somebody telling you of all the sister you're the one special every time I go through trouble you're the only one that strengthened me every time I talk to you I feel really strong and encouraged now your ego go boost up and and then tomorrow you talk to him and then tomorrow you talk then you find yourself in trouble that's right amen so don't let them tell you that okay every time I talk to you you always comfort me no you need to talk to Pastor you got trouble every season you got trouble you need to find a man of God you need to find a man of God I'm not the one here to be entertaining and doing your old change you need to go to the dealer get your car to the dealer so don't be there entertaining them oh my coworker you the best coworker uhuh uhuh uhuh go see the [Laughter] dealer that's my way of talking buddy and he get me out of trouble I don't want any blood over there in my hand Genesis chapter 1 verse one if you dare you can say amen amen in the beginning God created the Heaven and the water Earth and the Earth was without water form and how void you might be seated who created that Earth God why did he create that bad can you say amen amen don't do me like this please we just started we had the beginning we just had the beginning who created the Earth God how can God created something that is without form and something that is void Gody God God created the Earth and the Earth that God created was not beautiful that's why the Pharisee missed Jesus Christ because they could not understand the creator of Heaven and Earth not having a hospital to be born in and be born in a manger and you look you say this boy the creator of Heaven and Earth in a mess like this God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was how without form without form and how void in the easy way our way the Earth was in a mess chaos amen amen and a PL PL word amen and the Earth was without form and how void and what Darkness was upon the face of the deep is God darkness no sir so how does he create something with darkness in and darkness was upon the face of the deep amen amen and the spirit of God did what moved upon the face of the water water so the spirit of the Lord was in the midst of this mess everybody okay Amen in the midst of this mes right here we find that the good thing is the spirit of the Lord amen was moving was moving glory to God and God said now God spoke as long as the spirit is moving everything is still the same until God speak until the spoken word are we together and God said Let There Be Water light and there was water light so the spoken word in Eden is what brought the change amen amen everybody okay the spoken word is what brought the change the change came by the spoken word the spirit of the Lord can be moving but everything is still the same until God speak when God speak light comes the condition begin to change and if you continue the verses down God spoke God spoke God spoke God spoke and the more spoken word the Earth was receiving the more transformation happened in the earth until this chaos this mess was imorph into a beautiful Garden of Eden amen amen why because of the power of the spoken word everybody clear amen God created the Earth and the Earth was created in a mess in a chaos in a disaster and the spirit of the Lord begin to move upon the disaster but nothing happened after a while God spoke when God spoke things begin to change the disaster begin to get some transformation into something else that becomes beautiful in the sight and life was brought upon the Earth any question so far let's go to uh Ezekiel 37 glory to God hallelujah brother Kelly if you have another one you can hand it to me please thank you Ezekiel 37 very familiar scripture but the David I'm not sure if it's the two microphone fighting each other that's why I'm hearing the sound if you thereare you can say Amen Ezekiel 37 verse1 pages are still turning you dare you can say amen amen the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the water spirit of the Lord thank you my brother and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord amen you see the spirit right amen and set me down in the midst of what the valley so Ezekiel was taken to a place everybody okay everybody good this place is a valley it's not not a mountain it's a valley what kind of Valley is this who took Ezekiel there Spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord took Ezekiel to the valley we clear amen God did it and he set me down in the midst of a valley amen a low place which was how full of Bones is this a good Valley no it is a valley that is speaking of what death everybody okay took Ezekiel into a valley full of bones in other word many bones amen it is speaking of death amen amen a valley of death hallelujah amen when you look at the Bor of an individual can you tell who that individual is no the only way you can tell you need to have a DNA without a DNA we don't know so these bonds lost their identification amen there is no identification about these bonds do you know which Bond belongs to who no so it's a valley of confusion amen everybody okay a value a valley of Chaos everybody good everybody good verse two and caus me to pass by them round about and behold they were very many in the water open Valley so God took Ezekiel and when he put him down on the valley God gave Ezekiel some time that he can go round about the valley in order to observe in order to evaluate the situation in order to examine the situation so Ezekiel was given a time of observation a time of examination a time of diagnosis a time of [Applause] evaluation amen a time of Investigation in other word God put him in a situation and say take a look of the situation and when Ezekiel begin to go around he look bones he look bones he turn around bones he looks bones he turned around bouns he begin to wonder what happened [Music] here why is this a mess amen are we together glory to God the Lord verse two and he callus me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the what open Valley these Bonds were in a valley that was open Valley in other word these bones were not buried are we together did you sleep well these bones were unburied amen amen in other word it's a situation that is open to the public amen out it is a situation that is open to the public anyone can pass by and see that situation everybody okay it is not a hidden situation it is a situation that is obvious everybody okay and these Bonds were in the open Valley meaning they were subject to any kind of weather amen am amen these Bonds were subject to any weather and they were subject to any sabotage in other word anybody can get there and begin to kick on the bones amen the children can get there and begin to play with the bones amen everything is in an open situation everybody knows about it that's it it's on the Internet it's on Facebook it's on Instagram it's in the CNN channel of the message amen it's in the NBC's channel of the message where you click and you're going to know everything that is happening in any churches the situation is open it's an open Valley it is not not buried are we together verse two and caused me to pass by them round about and behold they were very many in the Open Water Valley and L they were H how dry very dry not dry but how very dry these Bonds were very dry in other word it's a situation that took place a long time that's right amen amen it is not a fresh situation because a flesh a fresh situation you will find the corpse there you will find the meat you find the people you can identify the person and say hey a crime happened here and this is how we need to start investigation in here there is no bones there is no muscles there is nothing it's only I mean uh I mean no flesh no muscles there is no sen there is nothing everything that you can see is bones and not not just bone they are very dry so it's a situation that happened a long time ago so it took time already amen am thank you Jesus that's how you read your Bible that's the way you read your Bible then when you start reading like this you begin to see things he says verse three and he says to me after the investigation after the examination as after he look at everything and evaluate everything then God turned to the prophet now ask him a question he says and he says to me son of man you the prophet can this born leave in other word after you evaluate the situation after you seen how serious the situation is and the disaster the destruction and the length of time that this situation has been there plunge into it do you think there is a hope to this can this bone leave if they were fresh you can say okay let's pray over this man he just died two hours ago maybe the Holy Spirit Will revive him oh Lord Jesus Christ revive our brother that can happen if it's 4 days you're going to pull the scripture you say Lord you were with Lazarus after 4 days corruption set you can do this Lazarus can come out this is not Lazarus place this is beyond Lazarus this is even Beyond Jesus [Applause] case so the situation of the of ezekia is beyond Christ because Jesus was within three days this one is more than three days everything is gone except the bone so it's a situation that is beyond any hope even Christ himself it's a situation greater than Jesus Christ when I say those kind of stuff some of you tremble tell tell the one behind you just relax everything is okay I got the scripture you see I got two two two stuff here do you see I got two stuff here there's one here one day so I got the the Bible and the message I got two guns so when I shoot from here I shoot from there okay so everything is okay all right so so he says son of man can this bond in other words is there any hope to this situation this have taken a long time all hope is gone do you think something can come out out of this chaos nothing left but bones can something good come out of here son of man you tell me verse three and I answered oh Lord God you know but Enoch watch the me the camera it's the one that have a tendency to autofocus and darken it amen he say oh Lord you know in other words the answer lays within who only God have the answer they ask the prophet what do you think about this the prophet say mm this type of situation even me myself a son of man I don't know this kind of stuff only they make care [Applause] himself so these are situation that only God can give us the answer yes sir only God can give the answer only God knows the outcome so God need to tell us the outcome that's it what is the outcome verse uh four again he says to me do what prophesy upon these bones prophesy upon these bones amen and say to them a bone on its son it's an inanimate object it's an object without life so God is saying talk to that object you will look crazy my friend amen talk to the [Applause] object so you can talk to inanimate object you can talk to a medication you can talk to a blood pressure medication you can talk to a blood pressure machine you can talk to you can talk to an EKG you say you AKG listen to the word of [Applause] God you can talk to a dialysis machine you say you dialysis machine hear the word of the [Applause] Lord you need to be wired correctly yes he says prophesy in other word talk amen talk to who to an inanimate object no life in it amen he says verse four prophesies upon these bones and say to them not prophesy upon the man upon the bones the bones that you find you talk to them amen prophesies upon the bones amen and say to them all you dry bones do what hear the word of the Lord how can a bon hear the word of the Lord do a born Heaven here everybody okay BS in other word I'm talking to this pit I say pet listen to the word of the Lord in other word the puppet must say yes amen hear the word of the Lord verse 5 thus says the Lord God to these B bones in other word I have a instruction for you I have a message for you behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live how can you live after being dead for a long time who's going to believe you if you have your friends there and your friend begin to see you talking to the born you born you going to leave you must be Abraham's seed amen verse six I will lay sen upon you who will lay sen God through the prophet I will lay senur upon you and I will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so God is able to restore this situation all the way back to the [Applause] beginning so the message of Ezekiel to the Joy Bor it's a message of [Applause] restoration restoration back to the original how by the spoken word everybody okay they brought him in the valley where everything is chaos and they spoke word now is changing everything just like in Eden chaos it takes the spoken word to begin to restore back everything amen amen verse seven so I prophesy as I was commanded amen and as I prophesies there was a noise and behold a what a shaking and the B there is many ways you can take this I can go with Luther West Pentecost but I leave it that way I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm in a compound meeting I'm using a different uh highway now okay he says and there was a noise amen and behold they shaking and the bones came together how bone to bone bone to his bone if you notice this is coming gradually at the beginning the bones are scattered we don't know any identification it a confusion so when the prophet spoke the Bor first begin to go where he belongs in other word we begin to bring some order so before life come it start by bringing you back in [Music] order so we know which B belong to who everybody okay it's removing confusion maybe one bone was taken over there and suddenly the prophet see one bone flying over there and going over there only God knows the proper order only God knows where to put each B in the correct order there is nobody that can handle your life only God can handle your life only God knows where to push everything back in order amen because he's your maker the Holy One of Israel amen everybody okay oh my glory to God verse 8 and when I beheld loow the sen and the what flesh came a what upon them he came after first the bones are put in order because if you bring sen and flesh it's going to be disordered maybe your leg will remain over there and then your body is over here so first you must bring the bonds together so they sen you and the flesh knows which direction they're going to go everybody okay after the bones are back together then they begin to bring the senal connect the liament and the tendon together that's what the word senu means one connected m so to a bond one connect a bond to a bond it's a ligament and a tendon they begin to come together and connect and connect and connect then we know who belongs to who everybody okay and the sen and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in water so we finish the first step everything is back to order now that everything is back to order let's bring them back to life amen verse n then say he to me everybody clear to the prophesies to who the wind you know what the winds mean in the scripture we already went through this the four wings wings Means War so these people were killed by War we already went through this place always remember wind in the Bible we went through this in the hotel I gave you quot and things wind the Bible Means War Winds Means War amen God say speak to the wind in other word it's the word that came and took their life away so you need to speak to the cause of the problem and tell the cause of the problem bring back what you took [Applause] here we need to speak to that devil that came yes yes amen he says and he and I prophesies verse 9 then say he prophesy to the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind that sayi the Lord God come from the Four Winds we went through this you know what it means it's on YouTube oh breath and do what breathe upon the slain this breath is not like uh the wind that's a MOA this is the breath of life amen because the life can ride on the Wind as a chariot me go amen he says th serve the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon the Water slain so these people were killed now we begin to have more clarity yes sir these people were slain somebody killed them amen upon the slain that they may leave verse 10 so I prophesies as com he commanded me and the breath came into them and they leave and stood up upon their feet an exceeding what great Army so these people were a great Army we clear now the valley of a great Army amen if this great Army was slain it means that they were defeated everybody okay so it's a valley of defeat they lost the battle and a disaster happened a destruction happened and Destroy them we clear verse 11 then he says to me son of men this bonds are the whole house of Israel Redemptive name behold they say our bones are what dried and our hope is what lost it's a situation Beyond Beyond there is no hope our hope is what lost our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts so this situation of Ezekiel 38 uh 37 it's a restoration from a situation where there is no hope that's right in other word when all hope is gone completely gone where there is no hope that's when this type of restoration can happen we clear verse 12 therefore prophesy and say to them th sayith the Lord verse 12 behold oh my people I will open your what grave were those bones in grave they were where they were in the open field now God is giving a promise that even those that are buried now God is dealing not with an open situation but even a closed one amen I can restore the open I can also open up your grave even the buried situation God can go down and pull them up everybody okay J amen amen they open and they close all those that are sealed everybody okay therefore prophesy and say to them thus say the Lord behold oh my people I will open your grave and cause you to do what come up out of your Graves so even if they put you down in the grave God will open the grave and pick you from the grave and pull you out as long as there is a grave everybody okay and come out of your grave and bring you into the land of what it's a complete restoration back to life it's a valley of restoration that is speaking about the resurrection or the quickening power am of God everybody okay we clear let's go to Second Corinthian and we pray Genesis Bad Case who created God who can fix it God by what spoken word who took Ezekiel to a bad situation God who created it who who who caused the vision God who restore everything God now 2 Corinthians CH 4: 6 if you there you can say Amen these are very familiar scripture verse four uh verse 6 the Bible say for God who did what commanded the light to do what shine out of Darkness you know what happened in Eden right God who commanded the light to shine out out of Darkness come on has shine where in our hearts so our heart was also in darkness amen it it that's it [Applause] Paul is comparing the situation of our heart as the situation of Genesis in other word our heart also were in chaos our heart were in chaos like in Genesis one everybody okay in other word we also are a ner that's right amen amen if the Earth was created by God and was created without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the Earth and Paul is saying this is the way your heart is in other word we by birth we were also a mess [Applause] amen that's why David say we are born in sin shap how in iniquity coming into this word we're doing what speaking lies that's why God have to shine his light in the heart of the people just as he did in Eden [Applause] amen everybody good everybody good which light is he shining verse six for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shine in our heart to give what the light of the knowledge the light of the knowledge of the glory of who God in the face of who Jesus Christ amen jum to verse 7 but we have this treasure where in Earth in vessels amen Earthly vessel remember in Genesis it was the earth we also are Earthly vessels Amen in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of who God and not who of us am we clear we are troubled on every side yet not what distressed we are how perplexed but not what in despair we are what persecuted but not what forsaken we are what cast down but not what destroyed we clear jump to verse 13 we having the same Spirit of what faith according as it is written I do what believe and therefore have I what spoken we also do what believe and therefore what do we do speak if you believe what do you do speak you cannot believe without [Applause] talking if you believe something you must do what speak we believe that's why we do what [Applause] speak oh afraid if I say something it's not going to happen you don't believe it if you believe it you will speak because when you speak it means that you already believe it [Music] amen let's pray my friend Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto th hand this is the best that I can do father according to the ability you have given me may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children Lord father Lord keep our mind focused on your word and remove every Spirit of distraction and any pressure that is coming from the mind of the people just in order to disturb them and move them away from receiving that which you have for them this morning Father we commit those that are streaming online bless them as well Lord and be the Alpha and the Omega of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen my subject this morning is the four phases of Ru the faith of Phoenix those who are in Arizona that follow us God bless you my friend those in Phoenix God bless youu amen the four phases of Ruth the faith of Phoenix brother Steven where are you coming from with this kind of stuff amen am amen am to begin with what is Phoenix stay put my friend put your seat belt stay focused amen according to the dictionary amen and mythology a phoenix is a bird follow me carefully tell the one behind you relax a phoenix is a bird amen this bird lived for a long time and after a while it was time for its own destruction amen and the bird begin to burn that's right and it begin to burn burn and the bird burn into ashes but what made this bird so notorious is the fact that after the bird was completely destroyed amen completely inhaled amen for some reason this bird resurrected back again from etern ashes everybody okay so this bird was considered an immortal bird amen am meaning a bird that can die and come back again a bird that have the power to rebirth a bird that have the power of Resurrection a bird that can renew itself and some call that the power of transformation everybody okay everybody okay this bird is usually associated with the sun because of the CLE of the sun the sun goes up rise up in the morning and in the evening the sun goes down and in the morning again we see the sun coming back up again it is like a circle of the Sun going up and down up and down so it's a bird you can kill it and tomorrow you see it rise back up again if you burn it tomorrow the bird will come back up again and it continue to renew itself and come back over and over everybody okay Amen brother Stephen you have established in this church that when we preach something in this church he have to come from the Bible and the message of the hour now you coming up with a subject that is pulling stuff from mythology or from books that you read somewhere and try to put it in this church but you already established that in this pullit it's the Bible say and brother Bram say why do we have to learn about this bird sir that's my question brother even why do you bring stuff from other literature to bring it back here in this church let's go to the book of act chapter 17 glory to God everybody okay praise be to the name of the Lord the book of fact chapter 16 uh chapter 17 if you there you can say amen amen the faith of Phoenix act chapter 17 let's go to verse 16 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says now while Paul waited for them at aim in Greeks his Spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city holy or completely given to idolatry so Paul went to the Greece city called a when Paul got into the city he be to observe the city and he found out that the whole city was in chaos everywhere there are adors Aros here altar here alter here alter here and it shocked the Apostle the prophet and when the Apostle look he said my God I never seen something like this this is a completely chaos everywhere I'm going it's only idolatry we clear jop to verse 22 to save time then Paul stood in the midst of Mor Hill they took him there and Paul said and said you men of aen I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious superstitious for as I passed by and beheld your devotions or your worship objects amen I found an altar with the inscription to the unnown God so Paul as he was passing by if he see a deity an ad that ad have a name that's correct this is Mars This is Jupiter this is Venus as he continue every altar have a name but Paul passed through an altar when he look the had so many gods until they ran out of name everybody okay so they came up with a new God that they call the unknown God so the hidden built an altar and they in the altar they put an incription says to the unknown to the unknown God every God have a name one we just call him an unknown God but every morning they are coming and they're worshiping the God if you ask them what is your name of your God he say it's an unknown God they are bringing offering which God unknown God Amen and then Paul used this Altar and begin to introduce Jesus Christ through this altar let's go go slowly my friend you need to have certain things to swallow this kind of stuff for I pass by verse 23 and beheld your devotion I found an altar which with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I what unto you Paul Ed a hidden altar and begin to introduce Jesus Christ through the altar that's right amen I'm going slowly verse 24 God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is the Lord of Heaven and Earth dwells not in Temple made with hands amen neither is worship with man's hand as though he needed anything seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things everybody clear verse 26 and has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and has determined the time before appointed and the bonds of their in of their habitation verse 27 that he should seek the Lord that they should seek the Lord if happily in other words perhaps they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us watch verse 28 for in him God we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets Paul begin to use the litur of the Greek that's right Amen to introduce Jes Jesus Christ not only did Paul use the altar but Paul used also the literature of the poet in order to op to introduce Jesus Christ am amen Paul say of your own poet are you there amen your own poet have said for we are also his what Offspring so Paul a hidden prophet in order to introduce Jesus Christ and only Paul can do things like this only a prophet can do things like this everybody okay because people has been attacking brother Branham and they say that brother Branham spoke about Jonah that he read that Jonah the reason why he had to come up from a fish belly was because the people of nineve worship a fish God in the Bible it is not there but it take a prophet to draw that inspiration and to bring it to us if you have a problem with brother Bram bringing a story from somewhere you need to condemn Paul because Paul CED a poet from Eden do you follow me amen do you follow me amen if people have a problem with brother Bram reading a story and bringing that back in the message and when we quot that story they say this is not the Bible this is a story that came from somewhere you need to condemn the Apostle Paul because Paul CED a poet from the Heathen Amen in order to introduce Jesus Christ everybody okay you cannot fight a Vindicated Prophet everybody okay a Vindicated Prophet knows what to take when and to bring it back to us that's why we have confidence to repeat BR amen because brother Bram would never deviate from the Bible Paul did it and brother Bram did it and he preached like Paul that's why this message is zeroed in with the Bible amen everything everybody okay so far everybody good so far so brother stepen now we understand that pH you can pull it from the literature Paul did it but what does brother Bram say about Phoenix everybody okay Phoenix in the United States is a city in a city in the state of Arizona and it's the very capital of the state of Arizona I understand that brother Steven I read about uh uh uh what Phoenix on internet now I want to know what did Brother Bram say about it what is Phoenix William Maran Bram glory to God brother brandham says this about the City of Phoenix there is just something about Phoenix that I love I don't know it's just something in my heart that goes way down all down all since I was what a little boy said where in school I used to read of what Arizona how I always long to go where to Arizona and when I get here I just get how beside myself brother Bram say there is something about the City of Phoenix that he like something that he love and since he was a little boy when he read about Phoenix he always longed to go to Phoenix and as soon as he get in Phoenix it looks like the GPS of brother Bram get lost what is going on with Phoenix brother Branham in the message forsaking all in paragraph 24 brother Bram say this is a beautiful country everybody okay I don't think there is anything like it am I have ever seen what is that country brother Bram and Trav PR near every nation in the world and I have never seen nothing where in Europe in Europe or where Italy all Asia anywhere in the orient that ever compare with what Phoenix Arizona I'm I'm letting you soak those thing in amen you must say your nor Caroline is good that's fine I'm talking about the prophet he said there is nothing that ever compare with what Phoenix Arizon now that is right it is the most beautiful place I ever saw but oh it look it will look like a what an alley up the side of what he will be in that what great Millennium so brother Bram so Phoenix even in the [Applause] Millennium oh have to be message believer to begin to swallow this kind of food okay brother I'm so even finished that in the Millennium it will be it will look like an Aly don't worry my friend brother Bram say I thought wouldn't this be a wonderful place I have always thought someday I like to live where in Phoenix and looking upon the what the valley I could almost in my heart I feel like what weeping that what beautiful place he will be if he was here without water s so there is something about Phoenix that was connected to brother branam so what is in this Phoenix William Marion branam brother Bram say here Phoenix has been the hardest that I ever had yet the smallest crowd that are ever attended and for and so forth has been where Phoenix it is the city that I love above all cities of the world is what Phoenix I just do what love it and that's I want to be I want this I want this to be my what home someday and that is why Satan fought me so hard way here that's why but but with God's grace I will do what when I shall have what I ask for by what God's grace even the devil doesn't want brother Bram to get to Phoenix what is in Phoenix Shake Yourself bu amen Amen brother Bram says this comparing Phoenix to tuon both of them in Arizona he said we are glad to be here where in Jericho with you Breen this morning and we invite you Monday night up to what Jerusalem which is what at he that's my friend you grown up now you can read you can get hard food so brother Bram say tuon is what Jerusalem Jerusalem and Phoenix is what Jericho what happened to Jericho in the Bible what happened to Jericho in the Bible the walls fell down let's stop right there don't go to the next level can I continue he says Jerusalem and ton to at the banquet down there so Phoenix

amen are we claming up together are we wired together are we wired together can I continue yes sir he said Phoenix is what in the valley like what Jericho to son where I live is what on the mountain

land of the what Sunshine though has people scattered throughout the Earth bearing record of what the light so Phoenix is a city that brother Bram like it's a city that is in the valley a city that is compared to Jericho and a city of the sun and the Sunshine but what is Phoenix We Ready in the message the Harvest Time brother Bram says this now in this city called what Phoenix Phoenix is something that is built that is what bu build up from what ruins so you cannot have a finix without a disaster amen you cannot have a phix without ruin first first you must go down then you can have a

destruction happen it is the time for [Applause] a hallu everybody good are you still struggling I already broke the sand bear so Phoenix is coming out out of a ruin ruin it's coming out of a chaos amen ruin means you have certain things left and you can work with it do you follow me chaos means there is certain things left you can work with it in other word when there is Ru it at least leave you with something and God can use that something to build up something when you have a chaos he left you thank you my brother with something and God can use that something and beat you up to something else so when the valley is low when it's dry Bor completely dried that's when God can use a phoenix he can use a bone and begin to rebuild back from the bone are we together are we together are we together amen have I lost someone no sir oh Father help me up brother Bram says this he says brother sorry brother Bram says this thank you my brother he says here he says it's something that is raised out of a chaos and we pray father that right in this great city that you shall raise up out of what the chaos of this generation a what a marvelous Church of what the Living God how filled with the spirit and what anointing and what great man of God may come from this city proclaiming what the message around the world according to brother Bram Phoenix come out of Ru he comes out of chaos any more definition brother Steven William Maran Branham in the message Paradox remember last Sunday brother Bram says this then my first meeting message I'm to preaching here is a what Phoenix Arizona Phoenix is something that can raise out of what nothing at the beginning it is something that can raise out of a ruin it can raise out of a chaos now it can raise out of what nothing so Phoenix can handle things that exist and that don't [Applause] exist Phoenix when it comes in your life if you have something to work on you it will work with that one if you don't have anything it will work out on nothing [Applause] hallelu father help me up brother I'm say Phoenix is something that can raise out of what nothing thank you my brother that is what God does he takes what nothing raise up something what out of it if you have something God can work with that if you don't have something God can work out of nothing so Phoenix have two gears amen the first gear Phoenix will work if it's a ruin if it's a chaos if there is something left over about the situation Phoenix can work with your ashes and bring you back to where you were Phoenix can also work when there is nothing everybody okay everybody okay when we talk about working out of nothing we need to understand what we saying in the Book of Romans 4:1 17 the Bible say as it is what written I have made the a father of what many nations before him whom he what believe even who God who did what quickeneth the dead and calth those things which be not as though what they were so when nothing existed Abraham call for it [Applause] amen everybody okay the Bible say who against what hope he believe what in Hope who against what hope against hope he believe what in Hope what does against hope means what does against hope means let's listen to brother Bram brother Bram says this if Abraham believed God he never thought of what reasoning he never thought well now theand reason but Faith believes how anyhow against hope he did what believed in hope when there was not even a hope he still what believed anyhow and he was imputed to him for what righteousness and if you have not got that kind of Faith you are not Abraham's seed amen amen Amen to be Abraham's seed You Must Believe when there is no [Applause] hope you must believe Beyond hope when everything is a chaos You Must Believe a phoenix you must believe that something can come out of of chaos that something can come out of Ru something can come out of nothing that is the Seed of Abraham when there is no money in the bank you believe God when there is no food in the table you believe God when there is no gas in the car you believe God to put gas [Applause] there with Mar Bram he says are we Abra you say are we Abraham SE to see from Brother Bram say what yes sir should we believe like Abraham did yes sir why the will Abraham SE the real Seed of Abraham what does you say well he was talking about what Jews oh no the Bible say if we be where in Christ then we take on what Abraham's seed and we are how HS according to the promise listen to brother Bram brother Bram say against hope yet believe what in Hope hop is are gone yet what he believed in it when hope was done what dead to who to him Hope was dead to every scientific search every resource of wisdom Hope was gone but still he believ in it what was it it was what faith in it faith in hope when hope was not there in other word for fith out of nothing huh I like to linger on that a while faith in hope when there was no hope there yet he still believe in what hope in other words there is not even a substance to hope for but Abraham hoped for what kind of faith is that it's not when hope is you can have a born but when there is nothing Abraham still believe when hope is completely gone but Abraham still have faith because God is the god of a phoenix it's a God that can build you up from the ru build you up from a chaos build you up from a Destruction build you up when you are nothing God can make something out of you when you are nobody God can make you [Applause] somebody oh God amen listen to this brother Bram brother Bram say this fine atmosphere of worship and I appreciate so much the attendance of what these churches since we have been in this city and throughout the meropa valley such a wonderful water Fellowship I said the other day that I think the word Phoenix means something that is come out of nothing now that might be the wrong expression but I think that is something on that order that this city was built out of a desert here just right in the middle of a desert so he rose out of chaos amen amen and a few years ago I come into into the city some 10 or 15 years ago and the churches was kind of battling with each other a chaos of churches you could hardly get they say well if this group is going to do the Cor operation we out so but now I found out that there is a phoenix has rose up such a Brotherhood of Fellowship among the Brethren all churches how together so when churches are fighting together God can bring a phoenix out of it God can bring a True Fellowship in unity with sincerity without hypocrisy without politics among the preacher that a genuine Phoenix where brothers and sister can Fellowship together with sincerity amen oh every Church in the message is wrong every church is bad all the brothers in the message are hypocrite we are not all Hypocrites God has a phoenix God has a group of believer genuine believer amen people that are more than your brother more than your parent that will stick with you to the end your Earthly brother can forsake you but a true brother in Christ will never forsake you and God promised to us to give us brother to give us sister to give us mother let this church be a phoenix of Brotherhood amen a phoenix of Fellowship where all the family can get along together as one unit as one Accord and the spirit of the Lord flowing freely because God is a god of a [Applause] phoenix we cannot have a church with a problem a church with a problem a church with a no God will have a church with an example a church that people can come and they can feel the love of God they can feel the fellowship of God they can feel the brother Hood because God is a god of a [Applause] phoenix Oh Glory to God as we moving forward my friend into the Tabernacle the faith of a phoenix even after the Rapture God will still have a phoenix amen what is that Phoenix brother Bram says this he says we are at the end and you see we are at the end there is not no way to build upon that corruption how can we build a city upon the ched ruins of a Sodom and gomorra how can we do it there is only one Phoenix left everybody okay and that is the coming of what the Lord Jesus Oh My a what a purification through the what tribulation period to bring back and restore what oh the to bring back a restoring of the world for a people who are just in the sight of the Lord of God and live by his what word that's why Romans said that even nature is crying nature is looking to be delivered from the bondage of corruption and what brother Bram is saying here that even the Earth will receive a phoenix that's why we have the war in Israel that's why we have the war in Russia everything is preparing toward Armageddon because in Armageddon everything will be Ash but God will have a phoenix in the Millennium God will resurrect everything back up again and bring a new world order under a new Phoenix where the children of God will be jubilating in here and Satan will be bned for a thousand years and we're going to rule and reign with Christ on this Earth to fulfill the one day of Adam everybody okay everybody clear so we found out that when we read our scripture this morning in Genesis 1 God created the mess he created the Earth without form he created the Earth void he created the Earth with Darkness amen and we found that when God created the Earth the spirit of the Lord came spoke and changed the situation of the world Amen everybody okay and Paul pick up that scripture and bring us to that scripture in second Corin saying that the way the same way God spoke to the Earth is the same way God is dealing with our life because on our birth we were also born in a mess and God come by the spoken word and he speak to our heart and when God speak to our heart he brings a transformation what is the meaning of that transformation William Marion Branham brother Bram says this follow me brother Bram say the greatest Miracle ever perform when God can take something and do what convert it and bring it back to itself again brother the Bram say the greatest miracle that God can do is when God take something and convert it and bring it back again to itself again follow me carefully brother Bram say just the same as you could take it Animal by science and drop a little drop of water on top of that hug and make it what a lamb now that is the miracle of it he changed his whole what nature he changed what appetite it changed What attitude it changed what everything that is what God does when he save a man from what sin he change his entire what makeup so greater a miracle than any part of what Divine Healing I know where we heading that is that I ever seen and I by the grace of God I have seen pretty near everything that I could ever of or hear of done by our Lord who Jesus even to raising up the dead after they were what gone and still I think that salvation is what the greatest miracle brother pram says that the greatest Miracle the top miracle of God is when God can change you and brother Bram said that Miracle is greater than Divine Healing brother saying I seen all kind of stuff that God did but despite everything raising the dead healing the leopard doing this this opening the eyes of the blond there is nothing that can be compared to salvation Hall I'm saying this to change our mind because if they tell you that somebody have a lamp here on and then they pray for him and the lamp came down and fell on the ground and I ask you a question I say look at a sinner from the street he came there we pray for the sinner The Sinner changed and now he become a Believer if we ask you a question between those two which one is the great miracle you will say it's the one that the cancer dropped from the head it's a Pentecost of thinking everybody okay if they ask you which Miracle is great you will say m the greatest Miracle is this one not that one I'm going to go higher again if I speak something right now and then a squirrel come here do you follow me come on and then we bring a sinner from the street and The Sinner give his light to the Lord if I ask you a question between the square and The Sinner which one is greater do you know what you're going to tell me the creation of the square you going to say the creation of the square today I'm helping you I'm recalibrating your gun the little simple thing that God did for you is greater than [Applause] anything why why why are you saying that why are you brother without this message we could be a chaos it takes a prophet to bring us back to the word amen Amen brother Brown I'm saying despite everything nothing is compared to Salvation where are you going pastor we talking about the faith of Phoenix hang tight my friend it's a different ship today I'm using a military airplane not a commercial today it's a military one so you need to hang tight glory to God because the military airplane can flip not a commercial one so hang tight my friend brother Bram says this Hallelujah he says you can be certain you can know uh and you can know it to be if he never perform any more Miracle on you but the what great miracle in other word if God doesn't give you anything in your life nothing else in your life but God does only one thing what is that one thing and that one thing brother brandham is calling that the greatest miracle what is the greatest Miracle brother Bram say if God if he never perform any more Miracle on you but what the great miracle which is the greatest Miracle of doing what forgives your sin that is the greatest miracle that God ever what perform was to forgive a what human [Applause] being [Applause] but the Bram is saying if God never done anything to you but he does only one thing to forgive your sin God did the greatest Miracle what are you trying to say with this brother brandham says this in the message persevering God has done something for you he did what saved you that is the what greatest Miracle there is isn't that wonderful what happened that is the what greatest miracle that ever performed when God come to the heart and do what speaks when God comes in your heart and he speak to your heart and he forgive your sin brother Bram say God fulfilled the greatest Miracle ever I know your thought you want me to say the creation is the greatest Miracles but you don't understand God yet he's hidden in Simplicity and watch what is next coming brother brandham says this my God he said how do you take a sinner like me and like you and make a Christian out of us I can't understand it that is the what greatest miracle that that God have a what performed is when he took a what a sinner and made a what a Christian out of us this is your problem this is your problem what your problem brother Bram say if you can look here you believe that God can save anybody from sin because you have been taught that that's the reason why it's more common to you hallu but you don't understand the power within it what God did to your life is what he did in Genesis the transformation of this world is what God to you did to you as an [Applause] individual if they tell you that God enter the word and say let there be light and he turned around he said let there be trees Let There Be Mountain you say my God that's a powerful God and Paul say the same power he used to to to to transform the Earth is the same thing he has to use to transform you but the problem is you beling in yourself and you looking at the one in Genesis to be greater let's continue my friend brother Bram say well that is as a far more what of a miracle then a man was who was what dead in trespasses and see that man is how dead and he had to believe or remain how dead then after you are born again you become a what a Son of God how much more ought you to believe for a what lesser [Applause] Miracle I'm going to go slowly did you catch that did you catch that andless a miracle for what Divine Healing if I live ought to be if aive man ought

there sitting in the back of the building with her heart off the things of the world she was what believing she said brother Bram that is nothing but what the truth she didn't say it from here God spoke out of her heart everybody okay everybody okay because the first thing God need to bring in your life is [Applause] salvation the greatest Miracle he need to start first is [Applause] salvation oh my God Lord help me up he says when a question is brought up Jehovah jar she said that is nothing but what the truth and it come from a poor widow woman's heart God know KN she asked the what greatest thing could be done as long as there is a heaven when the star is gone when there is no more moon no more Earth no more sea them both shall live on through what eternity with the same who Jehovah Gyra who gave the immortal what promise he his promises cannot fail listen to this my friend why are you saying this could you see the wisdom how many believe that that woman asked the what greatest thing that could be asked because the greatest thing God can give you is what salvation amen could you imagine a woman with an Afflicted sister Divine Healing could have asked for her healing a woman that is poor and Her Mother and Daddy poor and all of them poor could have asked for money and gathered she could have asked for years added to her life and G but she asked for the greatest thing that could be asked the what salvation of her unsaved what family and she did what got it amen that is what the main thing got by the same God that gives the what promise he is God oh how I what love him what are you trying to bring through this he that spare not his own what son but deliver him for us what all how shall he not with him also freely give you what all things in other word amen am when God come to your life he will first bring you the greatest thing it's a message God is giving you that there is nothing else that I cannot provide for you in other word if I can give you the greatest gift ever every L everything else you have need of this life is lesser is lower that's why the money is in the [Applause] temple brother Bram say when the anointing struck brother Bram brother Bram say even a million dollar right now if it's healing right now in other words the third pool could have given her money could have given her healing could have given her anything but first of all salvation must be established once you got salvation you have a right to go through every other [Applause] things in other word if God save you and give you the Holy Ghost it's finished there is nothing in your life that God is unable to give [Applause] you God by giving you the Holy Ghost is giving you a message that everything you need of I can give it to you I already give you a million dollar if what you need is 50 I will give you if I can give you a million how can I give you $50 if I give you a million what is $100 what is $500 I already give you the highest price I can give you Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Christ let me wind up I don't know if I can get there brother Bram say brother brothers and sisters do you realize the day we are living in the most glorious time when God of heaven will put among human being to ask anything you will and he will give it to you it is too deep for my mind amen I know but I hope in my heart can contain as much of it as I can amen listen to brother Bram back he said we know his word is a paradox amen when it's prom is something so unreal to the word something they cannot prescribe to it is something beyond their knowledge and understanding but when a simple heart will take that word and sink into the depth of its own being then that word will produce the life fact of that promise the faith of Phoenix Hallelujah listen to this William Mar Bram he says what makes a paradox is when something when somebody believe God and take him at what his word God's word spoke the world into existence that is the same thing you have to believe tonight it's God what promised word listen to this brother brandham say Jeri let me drop here but watch the Gentile he was not so I am not worthy that you comeand my roof speak the word and my servant will heal will leave and he turn around and say I have never seen Faith like that in Israel there it is we are supposed to be on that higher level on the no no we are supposed to be on a higher level than that was amen we are living on a closer of the world's end then we were then the Gentile way is to believe believe the word that is exactly right recognize look at the Gentile back up I'm going to the airport listen to this brother Bram said leprosy there was no cure for leprosy they have not found it yet only God can Kure leprosy they have not found even nothing for it to helpen but it's a type of sin he sets in her so gradual it's penless just move right in you don't know it until you are dying Big W white wordss come all over and lamps jop off and everything itat you right into it just eat you up leprosy Jesus was the only one who could heal this leprosy he is the only one today that can heal this what leprosy what I want you to notice here is leprosy takes the lamps off it will cut a part of your body and remove it and you lose it completely but brother Bram says this that I'm going to speak in his name I'm going to speak it in the revelation of my faith what happened in Sabino the other day I believe that the hour is approaching when what missing limbs will be restored missing lamps will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if he can make SW to appear that has nowhere here is the man or a woman just got a missing part and that is a complete animal it's self he is God I love him in other word even if something is missing something has been cut off we have a phic a faith that can bring something out of nothing Lord help me out brother uh HEI says this he says the glory of this L house shall be greater than the former says the Lord of hosts and in this place I will give peace say the Lord of host there is two houses here let me say with that there is a first house and the last house and he gu is saying that the glory of the last house is going to be greater than the glory of the first house and we know that God has many Temple that has been built to him Solomon built the temple he was destroyed built by zerubabel and then nemiah then that Temple was destroyed amen he built again and they will be another temple in the Millennium but God has a temple that was not built by human beings and the Temple of the Lord was the Lord Jesus Christ which was the house of the Lord so Jesus himself as the alpha amen Jesus as the alpha he was God's house all he was God's Temple amen because Jesus said destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will do what it up again because he was the temple that God himself dwelt and haga is saying that the glory not of the first temple but the glory of the last Temple is going to be greater than the first temple can I continue can I continue God also have another Temple and his Temple is his Brad can I continue amen the brde of Jesus Christ is the temple the brde is the temple the brde Omega is the Temple of the Lord because Paul say ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost everybody okay he gu is saying that the glory of the last Temple [Applause] I know it's hard for you to swallow it's going to be greater than the glory of the first [Applause] temp Hallelujah in other word what God will do in the bread will be greater than Jesus [Applause] Christ I know you I know you're going to have a hard time I know you're going to have a time I'm just giving you time to swallow are you ready are you ready let me drop this and we go home brother Bram says this those in the BR do only what his will no one can make them do otheres they have what thus sayith the Lord oh they do what keep still they shut up they know that he has to be God in them doing the work fulfilling his own what word he did not complete all his work Jesus didn't complete all his work while his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the what right she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that must be that he must do when now but he will now fulfill where through the bride that work which he left for what this specific time everybody okay everybody okay remember the glory of the last must be greater than what the glory of the first house in other words this anointing will do things greater than the ministry of Jesus Christ father help me up brother Bram say I'm a jobson No Stranger among us tonight in other word no new people who don't know about the message of the hour brother BR want to make sure they're not around because he's going to drop an atomic bomb he says I suppose so in this prayer meeting but let me say something now this is for thinking not probably rather notice just for thinking Jesus said in St John what 1412 he that believe on what me the work that I do shall he do what also and how greater than what this shall he do greater than who Jesus so it's possible to do something greater than Jesus do you believe the Bible do you believe the Bible amen he said greater then this shall he do for I go to my what father did you notice that notice now that was the son of God promising to the believer that greater things than he did am in these last day that the believer will do greater things than he did is that right do you believe Jesus said it amen everybody okay remember Phoenix have two part Phoenix can work from the ruin or the chaos all Phoenix can work out of what nothing William Maran Bram notice when Jesus created what bread he took a piece and created a bread that had already been what bre when he created a fish he took a fish that was first what created what a fish and put another what fish out of it is that right he took what water which potentially would become what wine and made it what wine out of it is that right yes but we have seen him in our midst when in this last days created things right out without what standing there is that right uh-huh to create a squirrel when there was what no squirrel he remains God he's just much what deity today as he was then and ever was all ever will be he still what God I do what and challenging Hearts to believe it greater things than this without anything to hold and what break off what speak it and it shall be what so amen hallelujah just what I have seen in my own Ministry seen him done you could you couldn't pile the volume on on uh the volume on this platform here if I wrote it in details what I seen him do just in my own Ministry seen him do do it he had more what success in my Ministry than he did in his own this is right this is recording now remember he had more success now not me he had Glory Hallelujah he had more what success where in Jeffersonville then he did where in Nazareth can you SW that amen he did it in that Wicked City in this wicked City amen glory because he could perform no Miracle there but he did it here here he finally broke through here he got it done here he might have had to get people somewhere but he got it done anyhow when Jesus could reach a point if the people didn't believe he don't do he he didn't do the miracle he goes away but with brother brandham Ministry your unbelief cannot stop the third po that's why even the children of haty right when they were making fun of the Prophet God bypassed their repentance and struck their heart and brought them back to [Applause] Salvation oh my God he says so he had more what success success right here than he did in Capernaum oh Nazareth he done more Miracle right here in this Tabernacle than he did in the entire Ministry on Earth that's right he did it now what about the rest of the world God is a god of a phoenix where there is chaos where there is no hope where everything is gone to ruin amen where there is distraction everywhere something that is open a reputation destroyed everything damage open to the public you become a a I mean a by word in the message people everybody talk about you there is still a phoenix you can Rise Up from those ashes you can Rise Up from that destruction you can Rise Up from that situation God is able to renew everything back again and restore you back out of nothing why because he saved you if he saves you there is nothing in your life that God cannot give you the salvation of God is a signal to show you that I can give you the toughest things that I can everything else in your life it depends on your faith it depends on what you think I am for you if you think I can provide there is nothing that I cannot provide if your salvation is fixed then you can get the remaining of the things if your salvation is not fixed yet first get the Salvation once the Salvation question is over then you will have the right to begin to ask God anything that you want in your life because you already reached the top level you have to believe for the Lesser Faith let's stop here and we will pick up again the faith of pH God bless you let's stand hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah I don't know what is in ruin in your life I don't know what is down I don't know what is not functioning I don't know what is not working I don't know where you stuck I don't know that situation that have lingered for so long until everything is dry and gone God is the god of Phoenix out of that chaos God can raise you up out of that ruin God can raise you up out of that situation that you have examined you have walked around it in your night thinking over it going over it pondering over it looking at this aspect and this aspect to figure it out which way can I come out of it amen God is telling you today he's a god of Phoenix against hope God can bring something out of it God Can Transform God can restore God can bring life God can touch that Stu born child that have been sassing at you and giving you the hardest fit that you ever have the third pool haveen answer for that let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this afternoon father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for your mercy and we thank you for the faith of Phoenix Lord because you the god that against hope you can bring something you show to us Lord that you coming in our life in the way of Salvation it was the greatest expression of your love every that you can display in our life it is something that is eternal that throughout eternity we hold in our Earthly vessel eternal life that would never been taken away because we are sealed until the day of redemption and father your Prophet explained to us that if you can give us the greatest gift ever how much more about the Lesser thing should we have even Faith Lord but father the tradition and the Creeds and theology have taken salvation and put it down like something that is nothing no wonder the sincerity by salvation has been lost completely until people comes to the altar chewing them people comes to the altar not even having their mind set up and go back again into the mark of sin Lord but if a genuine salvation have happened and you have spoken to the heart of someone father and bring Salvation and eternal life that is the greatest thing that you can do and it's a signal to that person that you have approved their faith and whatever they need in their life Journey you are Jehovah jarra you will supply it Lord because you are there to be with us to be in us and to lead us and to guide us in all truth thank Father many of your children are here and some are streaming online you know where they are you know where they have defeat where they fail where they messed up you know what kind of mess the devil put them maybe they found thems in the messes of depth that they don't know how to come out of it maybe they found thems into a depth of credit cards they don't even know how to pay them and come out maybe there is a situation that the record is destroyed the credit score is destroyed the family is completely wiped out it looks like everything that they have attempted is not working they are locked their mind is stuck they don't know anything father you the god of phelix may you come Lord and bring that hope and open the way and bring them Lord father back again and restore them so we can continue to receive Lord more testimony in this place just like you did for sister Aros father that doctor learned something that he never learned he seen and experienced something that he never seen that one kidney can function more than two kidneys because you're the god of Fe Lord you what you done in a few month is greater than all the years that the sister have suffered with a kidne trouble Lord father I pray that your power the Holy Spirit move through every single category every aspect of our life may you touch Lord may you bring life Lord may you restore father may you bring a phix lord may you bring a change Lord may you resuscitate Lord and bring your children back again to good health and bring them that which they deserve Lord
