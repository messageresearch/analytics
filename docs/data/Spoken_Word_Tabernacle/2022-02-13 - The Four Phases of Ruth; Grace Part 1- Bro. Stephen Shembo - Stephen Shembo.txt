was spoke of joy in our heart the joy i've got another song it's a kids song we won't sing it today because i got to find the words to it but it sings about joy in your heart amen if y'all can stand with me just a minute i don't know i've got two testimonies are they praiseworthy are they praising tests i guess so right let's do that first and then we'll do the prayer request come on up brother charles and then we'll get you up sister lorell and then we'll pray over these things and then um we have one song special this morning do you okay i'm gonna get you sign up first i was asking him about i kind of felt i said i know what this is about after last week okay i said but don't tell me i don't want to know yet you tell us tell everybody so here he comes and we'll try to keep everything short this morning as we can so we don't take away from brother stephen we'll give him his time amen god bless you but i want to first say thank you for all your prayers and all the supplication and i came to a decision that i'll be going to chapel hill and the reason why is because so chapel hill was the first college i applied to but it was the last college during my decision but then it was the first college to giving my financial aid offer and my financial aid offer was a full ride to chocolate hill so all expenses paid i'll say nothing that's awesome that's awesome you want to give yours right there sis just you know and then we are told that you know when we are fought very very hard that the lord has a blessing waiting on us amen and my daughter has been being fought very very very hard every way she turns she gets up at five in the morning she has her time with the lord she prays she reads a bible and she is only 11 in the sixth grade but what an 11 year old has to deal with in this time oh my god it will keep a parent on their knees she was in she had a situation this week it actually started two weeks ago and a little girl for whatever reason just had an issue with her was turning the whole sixth grade against her and she was really it was really tough on her i said well you keep it before the lord then the situation came to our little girl put her hands on her back to back school officials still were dragging their feet i said lord i don't know what to do as a mom you know the bear claws come out i said oh father sarah you know self-defense kicks in that's the mother's recourse but i'm still praying and so she she handled it the day i went to the school to talk to the school official she came home and she said mom she said the lord told me how to handle it like this she said i didn't hit her i didn't jump on her i didn't do this and she just followed the leadership of the lord so she before she gave me the testimony the school officials had called me and teachers had called me within hours telling me how her little light at eleven was shining so as a mother that is the or parent that is the greatest testimony that we can get how kind she is she's sweet she puts others knees before hers so y'all just keep our children in your prayers but that is a testimony tell it's working amen god bless scenes um john just bear with me just about two to three minutes but i have to go in a little detail amen um yesterday brother robert and i we went to get some mattresses from one of the properties and we bought with three box springs and did three mattresses they brought it out we loaded up on the wagon he tied it up and you know tied it up really good and we left so as we were leaving he says um law i think the top need to strap down also so we stopped by food liar not far from here and i went in and get something to eat because we were hungry and he said okay we're ready let's go so we kept looking in the review mirror and looking at the green ties that's that are on it to make sure that it's on and we just looked and i took out a piece of meat give it to him and as we took the bite and we're eating somebody at the side of us flag him down and he pointed to the back when we look there was no mattresses on the back of the wagon so we couldn't reverse we had just passed the exit we couldn't reverse so we had to go all the way down but we have to drive three miles to get to the next exit turn and come back up and we're coming back up there's this guy with a red truck loading the mattresses on it we had to go another two miles turn on another oh a mile get back up and we're coming i said oh robert look there's two in the woods but how the lord had it they were behind the trees so we say thank the lord i said he wanted to stop i said well let's go see if we could meet the guy but time we got there the guy was gone so we had to turn around again we came back we loaded the other two mattresses and as we come in i said robert look there's another one on the other side of the road so he had to run across the 85 to get the mattresses and he called me and he said come along with the truck and the wagon and says i cannot maneuver the wagon in the back so he i said you have your knife and just make a hole in the box spring and put your finger through it and when the road is clear we just pray and run across the road with it so he ran across 85 with the matchers we put it up we load it up so i told him i think i saw another one in the woods back there here he says we sat in the car getting ready to drive off so he said you know what let me go back and just for your piece and see if it's in the woods so he's walking at the side of the highway and i'm standing at the side and he called me he said is it by the sign i said go a little further he went a little further he said he's not seeing anything so he's coming back he's coming back and i'm looking in this direction to see him but i nothing passed so when i turned this way there was a rare truck and a man but while i was going we were praying lord jesus how in the world this man is going to find us with this mattresses or i said may he report it to the police or take it back to the store because the sticker is on it or everything to do something for us and robert and i we were just praying but i said how are you feeling you said praise the lord so we would just praise the lord and say okay so there comes the man and he walks on the highway side and he came around he said excuse me um are those mattresses yours i said yes sir he said there were two in the woods i said we got the two in the woods we got the one across the highway and he's just walking back to see he said man i'm a christian not just a christian but a true christian this man is 70 something years old he said he saw the mattresses in the road and he stopped and he picked it up and put it in his truck he said it was hard getting it up but i did he said i took it home and i'm praying and saying lord how am i gonna get these mattresses to these people i don't know who it is and he said when he was doing that the lord said to him go back to the spot where you get those mattresses those people are right there waiting he's coming back but he's thinking to go back between exit eight and five maybe some more came off and we're picking it up but he said when he was coming he saw the truck with the wagon and he saw me standing there so he reversed under 85 on the ramp he said i did something illegal but if i had gone around i would have missed you so he reversed and he came he says you know what i have them at home follow me i'm just four miles from here we followed him home he said you know what load it up on my truck and i will follow you guys home and i'll bring it to your home we said well when before all of this we needed gas so we were just going to get the gas when all of this happened so um my daughter is going to bring the gas for me he said call her and cancel it you said i have gas and i will put the gas in he gave us five gallons of gas he followed us home and saints of god we have the six mattresses and i want to thank god glory that's awesome amen and amen the lord oh my gosh i was feeling the frustration that's got to be bless your hearts yes that's great that's awesome screaming and praising the

he's already in england he went to comfort his uh sister so continue to keep the family in prayer so the lord will really really comfort his sister we extended our condolences to the family and the lord can give them safe travel good time over there until they come back amen how many are up to date with the sermon please please please okay blessed be the name of the lord y'all need to catch up if you don't if not that's between you and the lord amen how many read the book of ruth okay blessed be the name of still i have people who didn't read the book of my god amen that's okay how many are reading their cod book okay how many have started with the seven church ages okay so somebody's moving blessed be the name of the lord let's give the lord a hand the book of ruth because of the opening of the seals it's a book that is really loaded amen the feast of the trumpet is in it the seven church ages are in it brother branham is also there the sails are there so don't get those avenues stay somewhere because if not you're going to get lost somewhere and you don't know where we are so keep everything in line amen just as simple as you can get it amen how many listen to the sermon on wednesday praise god how many heard will happen on wednesday how many review that okay blessed be the name of the lord that was a wonderful anointing on wednesday if you miss it you should be there because everything was wonderful the presence of the lord was so great amen blessed be the name of the lord if you think you're tired i'm more tired than you amen you don't know how the devil fight me amen so you should be stronger than me brother branham says this that this there is one thing to this meeting it's hot and we are accustomed to that through the years do you get hurt here your chair hurts sometime amen but someone might think that i believe that when we enter into this building brother david reached the bazooka level that i believe that when we enter into this building that we seize time maybe and partly partially in eternity looks like it's taking so long the way how long i hold the people somebody gave me this quote i won't tell you his name amen i don't mean it to be that way but i believe that we are living at so close to the coming of jesus christ that i have to take advantage of every minute that i have the people together again we don't have two services we only have one service and we're trying to pack everything in one service so be patient because we got to travel there is a lot to cover amen there's a lot to cover that you need i mentioned about the 70 weeks of daniel and somebody was already listening to the 70 weeks of daniel daniel and they asked me a question i say if i try to get into that that's a teaching a deep one amen so we have a lot to study we have a lot to hear amen so let's take advantage of every minute that we get and pack everything amen your playing time is already over when the lord took you out that was it that was the time you had to play church there is no more plane church you got to get ready so we can go into the rapture amen so don't think this is a continuation this is not a continuation god already cut everything amen in other words get serious with god i am not going to back up i will keep shooting amen on wednesday we heard somebody speaking in tongues the anointing was so great and somebody picked it up and spoke in tongues and after a while we heard somebody also speaking i believe it was uh psalm 118 and they gave like this is the day that the lord have known my people you need to rejoice in it you can go back and listen to it amen so since the church is moving up and growing up and growing up i thought this is a great opportunity to bring some education because down the road as we're moving is going to be greater and greater amen so i'm going to let it go and until it goes it goes then we have to bring all those gifted people together they need to come hours before church and they need to pray pray pray and i'm gonna sit with them either sit with them or sit with the whole church and i have to teach on the gift of the holy spirit how they operate amen but since it happened let's give you a breathing buckle up and we're going to take off amen human sitting let's go to the book of first corinthian chapter 14. don't get nervous relax let the spirit do what he want to do amen so don't get nervous if your blood pressure is going up you let me know amen and do the best to minimize movement during the church i told you i have a lot to do amen do the best if you don't train a child how to get into church go to the bathroom and sit all the way to the end when they grow up they keep those same habits they will go into the bathroom ten times and they can watch a movie for three hours they're not going to the bathroom amen so i have a lot to do don't worry my friend i'm a pastor it's like a father who will teach you when you go to a restaurant how you need to eat don't worry don't worry i will get there i'll get there when somebody give you a menu don't get the highest price do you hear me i will go down to those area don't worry you will love me amen when they say go ahead and eat whatever you want to eat be careful some of you will jump in 50 menu and the one who offer you the menu is taking five dollars something is wrong you see now parent you need to help me you gotta help me you got to help me amen when they give you the big menu even though they say go ahead and get it be careful go to the least one oh it was so good they won't call you again they won't give you that opportunity again they know if you give it to him i'm gonna have an overdraft [Music] i'm your pastor you will love me we will train you in everything in the seals in the thunders in your marriage in your working in your talking when you are in the midst of the people until you are well well well done when jesus looked at you and said that's my bride amen amen maybe you miss it down the road we're gonna catch you up and try to help you up amen oh my my my getting into somebody's house and jumping in the couch i will get there let me go to what i'm trying to do okay it's a difference if you're in grandpa's house [Music] if you're in grandpa's house grandpa wants you to jump on it but if you're not in grandpa's house you need to push the brake [Music] do you hear me do you hear me do you hear me and we will get into all those areas until when somebody see you they say which species are you how did you educate your children i want my children to be like your children that's where i want you to be [Music] oh lord have mercy have mercy have mercy you think that boyfriend is giving you an offering or what order everything and you jump on them they're testing you let's go to first corinthians 14. [Laughter] you get there and you're the one doing the talking they talking slow down listen don't get before people and you just carry on your voice is the one highest slow down slow down young sister slow down we will help you up i love you sometimes you tell somebody to embarrass and say i love my children they're good people god gave me the best you can say all you want but god gave me the best there is none like my children no matter what you can say outside i still love them i will stand for them even if i'm whooping it's hurting because it's my children don't touch them give me a call tell me what's wrong let me handle them not you because if i give it to you you're going to whip them without mercy you see now let's go to first corinthians chapter 14. brother robert if it's going over time you know what is happening they're pulling not me so uh first corinthians chapter 14. if you didn't hear it you can go back you can play it before sister zadi sung the service was not there the preacher was not preaching yet he was after the song service before the preaching so it's good but we gotta talk verse one if you notice i give you a scripture then i put the three dots there it means this is the first part i'm not going to give you the second part because people need to grow if i give you the second part you will not understand it and you think i'm doing something else so i have to stop there your boss want me to stop there okay so baby will jump all right 14 follow after charity and do water did i say it why we don't desire them what was preached across the pulpit against a gift how are you going to desire something you don't know you don't even like because they say pentecost to pentecost it's true but you got to be very careful [Music] follow after charity that's the top one the capstone and desire spiritual gift you don't go in the capstone and reject the other one but rather that you may want him paul paul the top love brother i don't know the top is love that's charity amen paul say look at the top but also remember their spiritual gift amen how many are they nine he says among the nine i want you to prophesy why why prophecy he continues he says why prophecy he said for he that speaks in an unknown tongue speak not to men but to who if somebody somebody's speaking here i'm just taking an illustration blah blah blah blah blah blah you're not going to use anything he's talking to god not you amen for no man understand him anybody here however in the spirit he speaks water because nobody understand him they didn't say he has a devil it's the holy ghost it's speaking but the problem is we don't understand anybody here but branham continued he said the bible continued he said but he that prophesies speak to who so when somebody speaking in tongue you don't hear it it's a secret communication between the person and god but if i'm prophesying i'm speaking in a language that you can hear anybody here and that prophecy is to edification or to build somebody up to edify anybody here karma and exhortation it's to exhort somebody so when somebody prophesy they can bring something to edify you or when somebody prophesy they can bring something that will exhaust you everybody okay i want you to listen to this because we're moving somewhere down the road amen or to comfort am i reading a different bible make sure you look at your bible young people you look at your bible okay so prophecy can either edify somebody it can either exhort somebody or he can either comfort somebody the lord can speak something to comfort you the lord can speak something to edify you the lord can speak something to exalt you and brother branham even said the word prophecy means to foreter something that is happening the lord can warn you into something that is happening in the future or the lord can unfold something in your life that is blocking you everybody okay that's come with prophecy i don't want you to be children anymore that's right to grow up amen he continued verse 4 he does speak in an unknown tongue eddie fire for himself there is none spiritual gift but it seems like paul is more talking about the tongue and prophecy did you see that praise god he said he that speak in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he the prophesy he defies the church that's why i want you to prophesy so the people in the church can get some comfort some will know what is wrong in their life some will know what is the direction to take some will get some exhortation somebody will get some comfort that's why i want you to do that but i want you to desire a spiritual gift amen everybody okay verse five i would that you all spoke with tongues i thought paul didn't want the tongue paul say i want everybody in this church to speak in tongues [Music] and when i'm gonna teach you in tongues you're gonna see that if you really receive the holy ghost somehow you're going to speak in tongues if you have spoken in tongues yet it's not the evidence of the holy ghost but you have been seven years slow down you need to check yourself all right anybody okay i would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesied everybody okay then he that does water he's greater because what he's speaking is edifying the church the other one is in communication with god anybody okay we okay so far amen except everybody okay the one who prophesied is greater than the one who speak in tongues in the accept this is the exception when he is not greater do you hear me what is that exception except he does what so when the one who speaks in tongues interpret then him and the prophets the one who have the gift of a prophecy not a prophet him and a prophet is something different i will teach you on that anybody okay that's why i put okay if he interpret the one who speak in tongues and the prophet now uh and the one who have the gift of prophecy both of them are the same now if not the other one is higher because he's bringing something into the church to help the church except he interpret that the church may receive water because when a tongue is interpreted the message now is given to the church then it's exactly like somebody who's prophesying in other words a one who professor speak directly to the language the people can hear any question the one who speaks in tongues speak in a language that the people do not hear everybody okay or a language that that nationality doesn't know yet that language existed somewhere else and he needs somebody to interpret did that look somebody job to verse 12. you there even so for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gift seek that you may excel to the edifying of the so whatever you do with the gift the lord put in your heart in your life remember give that gift so that he can edify and build the church up anybody okay when you're home no problem anybody okay verse 13 wherefore let him that speak in an unknown tongue pray that he may water because if he interpret the church knows what he's talking about i stop there if i continue we're gonna preach about the gift and i won't even get to what i'm trying to preach this is where you need to hear as far as today and later on when the lord continued to open up this one this one this one this one when i see you 10 people then now we're going to sit and then unfold the whole thing everybody here brother branham say god about god he will send his gut gift in the church there is none spiritual gift to set into the local each local body anybody okay you need a scripture for the nine you let me know should be in full operation you see where we gotta go do you see where we got a clam in full operation in everybody every water go ahead and travel around the churches [Music] travel around the churches i'm not boasting i'm just boasting in the lord and go see how many times you're going to see that this is what brother branham said amen why did we kill it so something is wrong somewhere around the churches something is wrong hallelujah and in that is gift of tongue and interpretation of time brother branham starts with the nine and he narrows down just like paul narrows down what's wrong with this gift and now that it is just not repeating something or making a van repetition it is saying something directly to be interpreted for a certain person in that congregation or something to make a way tongue by interpretation is what that's why paul say accept because strong when it's interpreted it's in the same level as prophecy anybody clear it's just using different channels prophecy goes straight tongue goes to one and the second interpret then it goes to you everybody okay let's continue i know you tense like where is he going relax amen tongue by interpretation is prophecy and it's prophetic utterance given to the people to tell them what to do or something to correct either it's going to edify exhort comfort or foretell something anybody okay blessed be the name of the lord where are you going pastor brother branham to speak in tongues is a gift of god to edification as paul said in the scripture that it's to edify the church you got the scripture you can read the whole the whole chapter so it had to be some direct message my question to you if somebody is speaking in tongues how do you know it's a direct message you don't understand it how do you know it's a direct message for you to know that it's a direct message the one who interpret must give the message when he give the message then we're gonna gage the message by the interpreter relax everybody okay brother branham say so he had to be a direct message from god to the church outside of what is wrote in the bible if you could ask me brother branham how must i be baptized i can tell you right quick you don't have to speak in tongues and to tell me that it's wrote right here in the bible what to do about that i don't have you don't have to ask no question on that and have somebody speak in tongues and tell you if that is already water relax we're talking about tongues being interpreted it must be a direct message sometimes the lord wants to edify somebody sometimes the lord won't exalt somebody sometimes the lord want to comfort somebody sometimes they go lord want to tell you something that is happening in the future but you gotta have an interpreter brother branham continue when you go in a meeting the first thing you do you go in there and they have a bunch of tongues and interpretation tongue and interpretation and somebody raise up and keep coding the scripture that is colonel everybody okay absolutely god said for us not to use then repetition what about him if he wrote it once you believe it you don't have to say it again tongue and interpretation is right but it's god it's it is to be a direct message to the church and to somebody not just carnal and things like that and then you get ahead in all these other things brother stephen where are you going with me the bible says the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet god is no author of confusion when i'm standing here or a minister here under the anointing of god no matter how much you want to speak in tongues with tongues you urge your peace until god is finished here everybody okay the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet what it means is the one who have the gift can have an ability to block it [Music] i'm going on the surface when i'm gonna teach you on the gift i'm gonna get deeper and you will understand that better anybody okay anybody okay so when the tongue is coming and the preacher is preaching brother branham say you push your break because the holy ghost cannot speak there and speak here at the same time and bring confusion everybody okay you gotta push your break until the sermon is finished then you open up everybody care question on wednesday was it during the service when the preacher was speaking was he during the song service did he interrupt anybody chill out everybody okay when i'm standing here or a minister under our editor then if you speak with tongues it can be some repeating of scripture because god don't use then repetition but it's a message directly to somebody ask me one time put your finger on one time that the holy spirit ever under the discernment taught somebody repeated the scripture over and over he told them something that was wrong with them and something that they have done and something that they must do or something that had happened and something like that amen after the service so speaking in tongues can happen before i have a quote or it can happen after it's in order anybody okay what we don't want he cannot interrupt the service then you go to the confusion of pentecost after the service if the person just raise up and give a message the pastor if you want to stop just a minute and go ahead very well that's up to the pastor but then immediately brother kelly let the deacon before that person gets out of the building take them to one side and talk to them about it so when you speak in tongues in this church except brother robert or brother kelly to talk to you not to rebuke you but they just want to gain more information before we bring it to the church everybody okay so don't get frustrated the deacon are not calling you to condemn you they're calling you to ask you some questions then they'll gain some detail and from there on we go everybody okay now the problem is brother stephen somebody speak in tongues we don't understand what they are saying another one professor anybody here brother branham said normally there must be a judge to judge that message it is in the book right here it is in the bible i'm not going to get there because i told you i don't want to touch it anybody okay i don't want to touch it now amen there must be somebody to judge anybody okay to tell us whether it's god or not because the tongue and the prophecy have a mystery in the midst of it because there is something in the supernatural that we don't really get it's different than if a ghetto say brother angelo the lord say stand up that's directly but if i speak in tongues we don't know what the tongue is everybody okay brother branham say so my question is who knows what is real who understood the language to know what was spoken how are you going to judge somebody speaking in tongues you don't even know what they were talking about how do you know it's real you didn't hear what it's talking about anybody okay who has the gift of discernment to know now when you get those answers we will have something to go on but until then we have to wonder about the source of the tongue in other words if you are not sure whether that tongue you understood it or not if you are not sure and you don't have the gift of discernment to discern that tongue hold your peace because you don't have those elements that's why the deacon have to call you and then talk to you everybody okay because if you don't have those elements you cannot make a correct judgment if you judge wrong and it was god you get in trouble did you hear me did you hear me oh my god don't worry my friend now buckle up pretty good okay i'm gonna get you to the airport on the tongues okay question brother branham if a person or person speaking in unknown tongues in the same tone of voice each time so every time we hear that person it's like they're repeating the same speaking in tongues anybody okay the same thing but the interpretation is different by the interpreter each time could that be the holy ghost by the pronoun now let me read that again if a person or person speaking in unknown tongues in the same tone of voice in other words just saying the same thing like certain words over and over and over each time and the same thing each time but the interpretation by the interpreter is different each time could this be the holy ghost in other words we have a sister or we have a brother every time they stand and speak in tongues they keep saying the same thing but if somebody translate today they spoke something the translation is giving a message tomorrow they repeat the same thing until you can memorize how they speak in tongues but every time the interpretation is different can that be the holy ghost your seat is good mind is more harder than yours okay so you relax everybody okay now let me say this in this case remember god be my judge i this is william marion branham this is paul it is i i already told you about it i couldn't say it but in experiences that i have witnessed while under the anointing of such a meeting in other words humanly speaking me brother branham i cannot tell but by my experience i paul everybody okay that's where the ipod goes sorry i believe that the person that is saying the same thing over each time the same tone of voice is really speaking in tongues can you say man this message don't worry my brother you're gonna be turned into real people amen you're already people but i know what i'm talking about amen the same tone is really speaking in tongues i do i believe by the spirit they are speaking in tongues if they are if you're not christian then we begin to question you you understand that's how you judge gifts slowly you don't go quick go slowly everybody okay they are speaking with tongues no doubt but i believe that you get the wrong strength of water but branham is saying that as far as strong is concerned for that person i put a check mark it's okay brother branham said the problem that you get in confusion is with the interpreter tongue plus interpreted equal prophecy that's your equation anybody okay anybody okay is it complicated when somebody speaks in tongue and somebody interpret it's the same as prophecy that's the equation amen now brother branham is saying that this one is from god as far as this question where you get confused it's this guy here the interpreter what is going on brother branham hallelujah amen brother branham continued he said now but i'm not trying to flood him or to shake down i'm only trying to make a truth now someone speaking in tongues and another one get up to interpret tongue now listen close in the in interpretation of tongue now i'm going to have to get down in some doctrine now with this listen close now in the interpretation of tongue many people interpret tongues by an extraordinary expression of them feeling to say such a thing that is not interpretation i'm going slowly do you hear me you hear me if something come over you anybody here after somebody spoke in tongues everybody and you interpreted without understanding the language of the one speaking in tongues you are not interpreting can i repeat myself again in other words if somebody spoke in tongue blah blah blah blah blah blah anybody okay the one who interpret must not understand blah blah blah do you hear me the ear of an interpreter understand different they remember of the church understand blah blah blah but if you see somebody speaking in tongues and another one interpret and if you call the interpreter and you speak to the interpreter the first question you you ask the interpreter did you hear that person speaking in tongues yes or no did you hear me now if they say yes anybody care then that is interpretation then we gotta judge that we need to call the person and say you said sister samantha did this she said samantha come here do you recognize doing this this this this if she said no we got to pray for you you got a wrong spirit and we need to cast it out anybody okay anybody okay if you are right and the sister lie you will know how god whoop people because you made the holy ghost lying then ananias and sapphira in other words when they call you in this church and they ask you always speak the truth i don't want to bury you i want to bury you in christ so you can meet him in the air do you hear me do you hear me but if the person genuinely say that is not me we catch the interpreter everybody okay hallelujah let me continue he says interpretation is when they are speaking in an unknown tongue you are hearing them in water and just repeating over what their water so if you speak english if somebody is speaking in tongues you will hear them in english if you speak spanish and somebody is speaking in tongues you must hear them in your mother tongue [Music] on the day of pentecost when peter was preaching the bible said they were hearing them in their mother's tongue [Music] hallelujah what are we going to do brother branham use the question was if somebody's speaking tongues and repeating the same thing everybody and the interpreter giving something different easy correct is he the holy ghost now brother branham comes back he already checked they're speaking in tongues we're now dealing with the interpreter i believe in this statement that is made here same thing over i believe in that statement that they are both what so somebody can be speaking the same thing and the interpreter is giving something different it is correct if it's under the correct spirit anybody okay but i do not believe that the interpreter is interpreting the language of the person brother problem is saying somebody speak in tongues this message is true anybody okay anybody okay and they keep repeating the same thing you hear me and they interpret they're prophesying something different it is the holy ghost but brother branham said i want you to understand something here ever here even though the interpreter is interpreting something i don't think that interpreter is understanding the language did you hear me in other words the holy ghost is anointing the one with the tongue and he's speaking or she's speaking in tongues checkmark amen but it seems like this one also get up and does something and brother branham said both of them are correct but i don't think this interpreter understand this one in other words the interpreter this is doing a and this one is doing b but they are happening at the same time do you want me to repeat again do you want me to repeat again in other words somebody is speaking remember brother branham said the slant is at the interpreter anybody care it could be that somebody speak in tongues and the interpreter hears them and go but if you see something going on after a while brother branham said it is a signal that the one you thinking is interpreting is not really understanding in other words that interpreter also is hearing tongue did you hear me in other words when the anointing comes the whole church heard tongues yet they interpreted rose and spock something but she didn't heal the interpretation of the language did you hear me i'm almost done i believe that the spirit is present and the interpreter is water somebody is truly speaking in tongues but there is no interpreter did you get it and the interpreter that you think is interpreting because the interpreter followed the tongue because usually somebody speaking tongue the interpreted follow and by default you assume that the one that follow is interpreting brother branham says sometimes the one that follow does not understand the language and if they don't understand the language they are not interpreting they are actually prophesying if it's the holy ghost you okay now so somebody can speak in tongues the first question somebody follows and interpret pull the interpreter ask the question did you hear the tongue if they say yes both of them are together in one accord anybody okay but if the interpreters say i didn't hear the tongue then the interpreter was not interpreting the interpreter was prophesying and if you prophesy either you edify either you exhort either you comfort either you foretell anybody okay all right brother robert you put me on this seat anybody okay i believe he is prophesying instead of interpreting if he does not hear the voice in his own water and brother branham give the scripture how he we every man in our own language where when we were in the day of pentecost so you got to hear the same thing you got to hear it in english if you speak in english and if you are speaking in an unknown tongue and interpreting you are hearing in the language that you were born in because that is the only way you can interpret what they are saying because the holy spirit has interpreted to you and you are just speaking for the holy ghost you become a month that the holy ghost is speaking to tell the church what he's speaking in another tongue anybody okay almost brother branham saying i certainly i say certainly it's of god certainly i believe it's of god but he was speaking in tongues but could not say what he was saying because i don't know but and the presence of the spirit was there so when something happened first check the anointing in the room do you hear me if it's the holy spirit genuine everybody here if it's a wrong spirit then your red flag goes up but if it's nothing genuine be careful now you need to go in the detail everybody okay so if the presence of the spirit is there and this person just saying one word over and over and over speaking in tongues and this one just jump up this other one jump up and try to give try to give interpretation yet they don't know what he's saying in other words they didn't hear the language in interpretation if this man is not giving the interpretation he is what the spirit of prophecy is upon him and he's prophesying not giving a water what is the conclusion brother branham so therefore dear christian you who asked the question to you who said could that be the holy ghost are you sleeping already it could be the holy ghost using water don't be quick to judge it could be the holy ghost using two offices why because the anointing drop down and somebody gets so happy until they don't know how to express themselves and they pick up in tongues and automatically because of the way we were trained we are waiting for an interpreter anybody care because the tongue went there but we don't know if it's the holy ghost wanting to give a message or it's somebody who's caught up into the holy ghost rejoicing themselves anybody okay everybody okay then sometimes an interpreter follow but we gotta make sure did that interpreter here or no if they heard prophecy it cannot be the repetition of the scripture if they didn't hear then it's two separate offices because the anointing dropped down it is quickening the spirit the gift here the gift here the gift here and they can't control themselves and this one let loose and the other one let's lose it's like they have a gun they are not in hate them and they just shoot because they cannot control it could be the holy spirit using two offices one blessing a soul in speaking in tongues and another one prophesying not have to be interpreting what he's saying but yet he said the holy spirit came upon him in prophecy just the same time that this one was speaking in tongues and he thought it was an interpretation what a difference does it make it's the spirit of god giving a message to the water by the interpretation it's got to understand in water and repeat back exactly what the person say that is the gift of water last one many times in our churches we permit people just to rise up even when you are preaching and speaking tongues and making an altar call somebody speaking in tongues and somebody to give an interpretation merely one of them i believe i believe the person is genuinely speaking in tongues but i believe the other one more or less is water because some will speak in tongues maybe for five minutes another decoder and the other one give four words of interpretation it has to be the same the same and so when somebody is speaking in trunks the deacon need to take that help if they are in the room they need to click their cell phone and put their amen here and when the interpreter comes the deal can put the time if it's five and five it is prophecy it gotta be charged if it's two minutes and here it's five minutes you're dealing with an operation of two spirits i called the sister that spoke that gave the interpretation and i asked the sister a question i say sister tell me what happened did you hear what were you hearing she told me i was hearing somebody speaking in tongues i said did you hear what they were saying she said no i was just hearing somebody speaking in tongues and suddenly something took over me and i tried to block it and i let it loose so it was not interpretation if the anointing is genuine it is the holy spirit using two offices one just got caught up under the joy of the lord and begin to speak in tongues and the other one just caught up and the lord is maybe comforting somebody who was going through something let's stand if i need to teach you on gift how long will it take how long how long oh my god what do you do brother stephen brother stephen for the present time let them speak if he goes out of hand then ian you have to watch that sometimes it could be god and those leader fellow just like little kids trying to walk if he falls down four or five times i have seen this i have been in the church just leave it like that when billy paul back back there first started to walk he was up and down and down more he was up but he didn't know how to walk but i believe he had the gift of walking and let him walk a little while and then when he got to stumble his big feet i tell him about it so if the holy spirit comes on you don't be afraid brother stephen is going to stay on sunday let him loose let the holy spirit use you when it comes more frequently then we sit and put everything in order because we got certain situation that we need an answer direct from god to decode the situation it doesn't need the scripture he doesn't need the quote we need to hear from god directly then you can take advantage of those gifts and we can call them and sit down and they can pray pray pray until god comes down and say sister brother so and so what is blocking you you stole somebody's stuff over there two years ago go repent that thing will go everybody okay so we need that lord help me i don't know where my time is let's go to genesis 24. it's a hard thing if the people don't understand how we operate brother branham spoke it all over the message if you don't sit to study you will kill a gift in churches you're going to hammer on people and then you don't know you are choking the holy spirit that is opening channel to help you up and that's all over the message because somebody didn't understand how the spirit worked all they said no no no no no no no brother branham say wait a minute did you really have the detail that you're dealing with that's why brother branham said put them in the room because over there by the bottom is watching and then we look and then we judge we bring it and we give it to the church if it's wrong we call the person we got to pray and cast that devil hey but here let's go to genesis 24. i will stop where i have to stop to let you go home because time is moving quickly for me but i cannot let this go i don't like question and murmuring in church i don't like churches that murmur churches that go home and sit like politician i don't like that they go home and sit what do you think about what happened to church today don't do that give me a call call the deacon say brother stephen i saw something like this i'm just curious what do you think it is i will tell you i'll spoke to the deacon don't go call somebody and say what did you think about what happened to change today did you see see and so have she fought her sister so and so how she fell down on the floor don't do that we are family we are family amen uphold one another you have a question either go to that person if not come to a man more spiritual come to me talk to me i'm gonna tell you okay that's fine let me question let me ask and i will come back to you and then i'll get back to you not disclosing your name because i don't want sister sorry something dog she's the one looking at me every time i follow so a pastor gotta go this way go this way okay genesis 24 54 and they did it this is elias he and the man that were with him and terry all not and they ro and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away to my master you know the background of this and her brother and her mother did you see the father there the father was there but the father was not the problem her brother and her mother say let the dems abide with us a few days at least you know number 10 right from the brother and from the mother you might be seated amen after that she shall go why did they choose only ten days one not eleven days one not five days one at three weeks and he said to them hinder me not that this is a eliezer seeing the lord has prospered my way send me a way that i may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth we want her to speak we want to hear from the horse's mouth and they call rebecca and said to her will you go with this man the man that you don't know the man you just met you don't even know whether his story is true or not you don't even know whether everything he told you was right or wrong you want to go with this man and she said i will wait [Music] i will let's go to second king chapter 2. if you're there you can say amen somebody the message there tried to hinder rebecca everybody okay and they tried to hinder rebecca moving toward isaac everybody okay and they want to hinder her for 10 days rebecca refused to be hindered she wanted to move forward right away brother robert that's your first key second one verse one and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind there was a rapture coming up that elijah went with elisha from water that was our first one our second we see elijah and elisha and they go and they're going through a journey their journey started from gilga everybody okay verse two and elijah said to elijah terry here with rebecca he was the brother and the mother anybody okay but with elijah it is elijah himself blocking elisha say terry here i pray you for the lord has sent me to bethel from gilga to bethel i cannot get in the detail because it's a lot of messages locked there but i'm going to stay on the main line and elisha said to him as the lord lives and as your soul lives i will not leave you he could have said oh this is my master he told me to stay so okay i'll wait why did you stay oh you must no he told me to stay that's why i'm staying here did i ever done anything wrong but this man said no he's looking at the prophet of god he said no [Music] anybody care so they went down to battle and the songs of the prophet in bethel we found that there was sons of prophets there and brother branham says that they were a school anybody care okay theology and the sons of the prophet that were in better come forth to elijah and say to him no you that your lord will know you that the lord will take away your master from your head so it was not something he then they knew also but they knew what elijah knew what were they doing about what they knew elijah was clinging to elijah they knew but they didn't care about it everybody okay and he said yeah i know it hold your peace and elisha elijah said to elisha tell me here i pray you for the lord has sent me to water jericho in other words somebody is trying to push somebody out and the other one is still like uh uh-huh and elisha elijah said to him elisha terry here i pray you for the lord has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord leave if that's verse 4 and as your soul leaveth i will not leave you so they came to jericho verse 5 and the sons of the prophet so there is another school of prophet here sons of prophet there is another school of prophet that is similar to bethel amen and the sons of the prophet that were at jericho came to elisha and said to him know you that the lord will take away your master from your head today everybody okay and he answered yeah i know hold your peace they knew the same thing and elijah said to him terry i pray you hear for the lord has sent me to water fourth one is jordan everybody okay so gilga to bethel bethel to jericho jericho to jordan number one number two number three number four four stages everybody okay and elijah say terry i pray you verse six here for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as the lord leaves and as your soul leaves i will not leave you and they too went on and verse 7 and water we found that in here in jericho they got 50 men there is a number 50 here which speak of pentecost everybody okay now you already understand numerology okay we got yoga number one number two number three got pentecost then number four everybody okay and then he said and fifty men of the son of the prophet went and stood to view a far off they never follow close they move with them the pentecostal move with them up to a certain point and they stood back did you get it did you get it because the seed shall not be here with the shack you will get that don't worry you will get that everybody okay and the two went by jordan there is a key here that is powerful and elijah took his mentor brother mike daley asked me this question and he opened up a message but one of this day we will speak about the mystery of the 24 stones of jordan that you will see while this opened and elijah took his mantle and wrap it together and smote the waters and they divided here and there jordan means death so they too went over on dry ground and he come to pass when they were gone over that elijah said to elisha ask what i shall do for you before i be taken away from you they never ask elijah elijah that here they didn't ask him here they didn't ask him here he have to cross jordan over jordan that's when something opened up [Music] everybody okay and elisha said i pray you let what a double portion of water so the spirit was over jordan anybody care everybody here the coming of the spirit in the life of elisha cannot happen here are we okay remember it's the same revelation unfolding it cannot happen here it cannot even happen here even both of them have prophetic utterances but they cannot give the spirit you have to go to jordan and cross death because that snake was still there you remember that snake when that snake is taken off then the holy ghost is ready to come [Music] everybody okay so far my god that's why i tell you keep up with the sermon everybody okay a double portion of your spirit be upon me and he said you have asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me the word see if you see me when i am taken from you it shall be so to you but if not it shall not be so anybody care you gotta see me being taken out for you to receive the spirit so if you cross over here and you don't see me you lost it it's like the other road that enter into the holy authorities and that came out without burden [Music] ever here you got to be a special road that when you cross jordan because the veil also was death everybody here you gotta cross that veil and over there we're gonna check whether you see him taken up or not whether you have a revelation or not hallelujah let's go to john chapter 6 oh my god i'm sorry i wish i didn't have to deal with that but i have to deal with it john chapter 6 verse 65 then we saw i will be watching tom and help you up okay somebody said thank you jesus oh lord verse 65 and he said therefore we will get to this maybe down the road therefore say that to you that no man can come to me except he were given to him of my father from that time few of his disciple how many stayed how many really will make it many of his disciples went back jesus said something to cause them to go back and walk no more with him john 6 66 6 6 6 the mark of the beast anybody okay dan said jesus to the twelve you will think he finish his business then who thank you jesus we continue jesus turned to the disciple like elijah he's trying to push them out amen then say jesus to the twelve will you also go away he's rude he's chasing people away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life and we believe and assure that you are that crust the son of the water in other words you cannot pull me away i will go with you aren't here everybody here you see why the devil was seeking for peter and when jesus resurrected he said go tell peter i remember him tell peter i'm gonna meet him in the upper room and who preached in the upper room do you see why the devil was chasing peter let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father there is no glory that can be given to any man whatever was spoken is nothing but the wisdom of the spirit may all the glory be given back to you father you have given us an opportunity to gather together this morning again around the revealed word of the hour lord may you announce your word father and may you guide us may you be the beginning and the ending of this service may you move me completely out of the way and may every spirit that is contrary to your divine nature father made those spirits stay away from this place and may only the holy spirit and the elect angel stay in this building speak to our souls and help your children father in the name of jesus christ amen last sunday we spoke about this examine yourself whether you be in the faith prove your own self knowing not your own self how that jesus is in you except you be reprobate my subject this morning brother david you might have to correct this is the four phases of roof speaking of grace everybody okay all right for those who read the book of ruth we know that elimelech and his wife naomi left israel when they left israel elimelech and naomi was from bethlehem bethlehem water somebody ready judah we found the word bethlehem and the word judah put together everybody okay then when they were living they have two children with them the word naomi means pleasant the word elimelech means worship and the two children that they have one of them was called marlon and the other one was kalyan anybody care or killian anybody clear the meaning of those children marlons means sickness and killian means weary gloomy sadness brother branham now this story started something on that manner as a lovable sweet woman her name was naomi and roof naomi means present eliminate was her husband means worship pleasant worship was her family they had a son marlon one that means sickness and killian the other meant to weary gloomy sadness there was the family brother remember to make your screen bigger for reference everybody okay so when these two get married together they form a pleasant worship everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord so why didn't anybody from another tribe leave israel why he was not from the tribe of den why he was not from the tribe of issachar why he was not coming from the tribe of ruben he only came from the tribe of judah and specifically from bethlehem they had to leave bethlehem they have to cross the sea they have to cross the river to go over to the land of moab brother branham said the word bethlehem let's break it down b-e-t-h means house e-l means god e-l-h-m means bread so the house of god's bread so this family comes from the house of god's bread out from the tribe of judah what abraham continued he said half feeding he was then for the bread of life to come out of water house of water because when jesus christ came jesus said i am the living bread that came down from heaven and jesus also was born in bethlehem so bethlehem spoke about christ who was the living bread that came down from heaven he said your father did eat manna and they are dead but i am the bread that came down from heaven and the house of god's bread was in bethlehem and if jesus is the living bread so jesus must be born where the bread naturally was because what happened in the nature was a foretelling of christ that is coming in the future that's why jesus was born in bethlehem because jesus was the bread the living bread of god that came down from heaven oh it's a beautiful story if you notice how bethlehem was formed don't want to get on that subject actually rehab the harlot her son was the one her son was the one who founded bethlehem he was a wheat center and a lot of fine water day and he founded the little city and he was the smallest city of all the cities because the prophet said out of bethlehem of judea aren't you the least among the princes of judah but out of this shall come the water that governor was jesus christ which means the priest the governor hey that shall rule my people out of that little one so now we begin to understand that out of this bethlehem everybody here of judah because judah spoke about the royal seed the scepter shall never leave judah until who shallow comes and shallow was jesus christ but shallow cannot be born any place in judah he must be in the place where the bread center is that's why shallow entered judah but specifically in bethlehem because he was god's bread that came down from heaven everybody here so far so why are we using judah why it was a family from judah that have to depart from israel and go into the land of moab when we come back to the tabernacle that we are still in if you notice under the uh the at that circle right there the way the tabernacle was built if i can put it up here to make it easy on somebody you remember it now there are three places we have the other court we have the holy place and the holiest everybody and the gate was on the east side this was east this was north this was south and this was west if you need scripture on everything here you see me everybody okay now if you look here this tab and our call is placed this way but they kept the same direction to show you that there is side is coming this way because that's where the gate is here and if you remember when we talked about the inner veil of the tabernacle we found out that this veil that jesus right here everybody here was the same [Music] color the same material as this door here you remember that and it was the same as the gate anybody here the only difference between this one and this one was that there was no caribbean anybody here in other words there was no blockage everybody care about here so if that is the case where are you taking me in the book of number chapter 2 verse 1 the bible say and the lord spoken to moses and unto aaron saying every man of the children of israel shall pitch by his own standard so when the tabernacle was placed like this israel was around the tabernacle anybody care but israel was not around the tabernacle any kind of way they were around the tub and now caught by order anybody here there were three tribes that pitched on the north three tribe that pitch on the east west three tribes here and three tribe there three six nine twelve which brings worship anybody okay anybody everybody okay now among those three tribes one of the tree was the top of the traps everybody okay and that top of the tree had a standard or a flag anybody okay so when they were camping that tribe will put up its flag and this one among the three one of them will put up the flag and this one over here the one that is greater put up the flag and the one that is greater put up the flag so there were four flags around the tabernacle anybody okay i'm not gonna get in detail i'm trying to stay on the highway he said pitch by his own standing with the inside of their father's house so the flag was not just a blank flag it was a flag that have a figure or an image and the image was talking about the patriarch in other words if right here they choose reuben but here the image of rubrik was a man so this flag will have a man ready anybody okay on the west side it was ephraim and the flag of ephraim was a knox so you're gonna see a knock showing over there everybody okay if you need scripture see me on the north side they picked them and then was an eagle anybody here so now you can see that they kerry beams were actually camping on top of the traps everybody here so these three tribes were controlled by a caribbean and these three tribes were controlled by the caribbeans and this one caribbean and this one caribbean therefore the throne of god must be in the midst of them because in heaven the caribbeans are around the full throne that's why god was dwelling in the tabernacle and the kerry beams were around him everybody okay now who was on the east side on the inside to all the water the sun rises on the east but the sunset is on the waist on the east side to all the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of who so judah when do you want to enter the tabernacle do you follow me there was only one gate everybody okay that gate was on the inside did you get it and that gate the one who was chief that was protecting that gate towards judah amen anybody okay so for you to get into the tabernacle did you fail do you follow me you must pass by judah [Music] are you okay if you go by ruben you're not gonna see the gate if you go by ephraim you're not going to see the gate if you go by them you're not going to see the gate the gate was only one gate and they get must come out of judah because the savior must come out of judah everybody okay because jesus said i am the door everybody here when the veil of the tabernacle was ripped the bible said they ripped his own veil and jesus said straight is the gate jesus was the gate so this guilt is crushed this door is crushed this veil is christ and the tabernacle is christ that's why brother branham said when you read the bible and you don't see jesus christ in every passage yes you are reading the bible wrong if you want to enter the gate you must enter by judah ever here hallelujah but uh uh the number 338 bad dose take number 10 i cannot go under pressure i'm going to go straight if we stop we stop where we're going to start let's go in number chapter 10 the gate is judah you want to enter the tabernacle judah must give you the permission if not judah will kill you everybody here so when you entering the tabernacle you passing judah then you see the gate anybody okay number chapter 10 and the lord spoke to moses saying make you two trumpets of silva i'm not going to touch that i'm trying to stay on the main line of all pieces shall you make them that you may use them for the calling of assembly and for the journey of the camp are you okay so this trumpet if god want to speak to the people when they blow the trumpet he gathered the people or if they blow the trumpet he tells you everybody need to move so now you need to know which sound is it a sound to gather you up or is it a sound to tell you everybody stand up we need to start moving verse three and when they blow with them all assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the door now you begin to understand the door they didn't say the gate the door the door of the tabernacle of the congregation verse 4 and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are the head of the thousand of israel shall gather themselves to you i'm trying to stay away verse five when you block an alarm an alarm is telling you now it is not to gather the people because god is trying to speak an alarm means everybody need to stand because we need to move the whole camp israel needs to move he said when you blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the water who was the camp that was on the east side part shall go water so when you want to move israel and you want to move the tabernacle the first camp that begin to show the direction in other words they want to have the gps everybody here they want to move first the one that is ahead is judah so not only is judah protecting the interest but judah is the first one to move if you go home and you and you read this entire chapter you will see that the first one was judah and then the second one was ruben and then the third one was ephraim and the last one was then they were moving like a clock because the clock goes this way that's why brother branham said if you want to know the time of god look at the movement of the jew they will tell you the time of god because the way israel does things it is a clock to us if you see the jews doing something they are giving you a clock and the first one that moved was judah and the gate was judah everybody okay we have not finished yet number chapter 3 verse 38 it's on the board but those that guarding camp before the tabernacle to all the water we already know in the east who was camping there judah even before the tabernacle of the congregation his word shall be who and who and who let me push your tabernacle here okay your tabernacle is right here are the robert don't betray me everybody okay are you there we have the heart the other coat we have the holy place we have the holy of holies we got three tribes here three here three here here we got the gate and there is a tribe here that is chief and that tribe is judah and this tribe was the tribe from where the king were coming out that's why when everything moved judah must be there because he's the king everybody okay and not only that now in number chapter 3 we found out that on the same angle on the east side was a place here for moses a prophet [Music] are we okay are we okay and there was a place for aaron plus his sons the high priest and his son anybody here judah spoke about the king anybody here everybody okay so when you trying to get in the tabernacle you are actually passing the king and the priest anybody here ever here because what happened in the old testament was only an image of what is happening on the future telling you that the door to the true tabernacle of heaven must be through a priest who is king. [Music] everybody okay and we found also in hebrews 7 that there was a man called melchizedek [Music] and mckinsey that was king and water he was speaking about melchizedek right here because melchizedek was jesus christ everybody okay so if you want to enter the tabernacle you will pass a man that is both king and priest and he's also a prophet [Music] do you hear me son of man prophet priest son of god king son of david all three were gathered up here ever here and this image of melchizedek is an image that opened the door to the gentler because melchizedek when he died who was jesus christ he ripped the tail and we found last sunday that he broke the the wall of partition he broke the enmity that was between us and the jewish people now god can get his children from the jews and from the water everybody here because the levitical priesthood was restricted to the jewish people now melchizedek have to do it ever here so god has a daughter who was not you but she was jew she was not jew by birth because paul told us they choose you you remember the true israel ever here so that's why when god wanted to rescue his children he could not get this levitical here because the levitical priesthood was restricted to the jewish people but we found that out of judah come david everybody okay and david begin to behave differently everybody okay david even went and took gentile and brought them into the tabernacle and god never killed him everybody care about here so the tribe of judah had the scepter and according to the uh to esther acceptor have a power to override the law [Music] everybody okay so in order to redeem a child of god that is not born in israel the door must leave israel judah must go ever here somebody out of judah must move out to take the door and to bring the door into agenda [Applause] because if you enter by judah nobody will touch you in israel if you enter by any other tribe you're gonna get in trouble so somebody from bethlehem judah must leave israel and go to the gentile [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and the emblem of judah was water the lion of the tribe of water have prevailed everybody okay everybody okay what are we going with brother stephen brother branham said we are building a house you must put your right upright and everything else brother wood and some of this carpenter and contractor here could tell us how to build your house but i'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house because the tabernacle was a house according to exodus 25 god told moses build me a house i want to dwell among you everybody but i'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where god can dwell he wants you to dwell in he want to make you like himself he wants you to be he wants you to be reflected reflecting rather his being just like god live in the tabernacle just like god live in jesus christ god now want to live in you and use you as a tabernacle or a dwelling place where he can reflect himself [Music] blessed be the name of the lord now brother branham say we want to give one more illustration little illustration in the fifth verse here and then we shall start over get our sixth verse and start off now i want you to notice in the plan of redemption because remember whatever happened in the tabernacle was only showing us the step of god how to save men you remember that and now we are in the book of ruth brother branham say i want you to notice in the plan of redemption how god foreshadowed it he worked it out perfectly in who and who so just as we saw the steps in the tabernacle the life of roof also is showing you steps why do we need this to unfold you more something hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord now we found out that on the process of time elimelech died you read it in the bible then the two sons of elimelech got married to two women the door moved and out of all moab the door pulled two people and hooked them and pull them up but remember they are not in israel they are still outside the door must take them to pull them back into the promised land everybody okay they are not in israel anybody okay so when the two nuts went and hooked the hook to oppa and they also uh uh hooked to roof now if you notice this entire story it's only four chapters none of them got pregnant anybody okay when they were married in more album no life anybody here how much how much intimate relationship happen for some reason there is no children so the first marriage of roof i don't know what happened to this they keep going in the first marriage of rufus have no children the first marriage of oprah no children the marriage is there but no children and does these two women enter into this family by marriage what is going on anybody care the interest in the family is very important amen when you enter by marriage outside the promised land he got it i'm waiting for it when you enter by marriage outside the promised land anybody care you are in the family you are in the environment everybody you are gracious to be part of the family all part of an environment anybody here anybody here but you silly moab okay anybody okay the door left israel and went into the gentile because the door is trying to rescue the children of god that were born into gender and pulled them back again to israel everybody when they don't went there with the religion of israel because israel even them if they move to another nation they always keep their religion that's why esther and mordecai got in trouble because they were keeping their religion wherever they were ever so the religion of israel went with the tribe of judah america so when you enter there you are at the first interest of roof was an interest by marriage and an interest by filial marriage everybody okay some of us enter in this message by marriage your father believed the message your mother believed the message so by default when you are born you are born in marriage in the message because of marriage you found yourself go into the message church because of your parent do you remember i'm going to rob you do you remember how did you enter in the message how amen some enter in the message because the wife was in the message here and the wife was calling somebody in the world and by marriage they married together and they came into the message by marriage somebody else he was the husband that was in the message and went marry a woman in the world and the woman came into the message because of a relationship the first entrance of roof it was by marriage outside the promised land everybody here either you are born by marriage either you marry somebody that is in the message or you were calling somebody in the message and that person brought you to church but he was your boyfriend or your girlfriend you enter by relationship but you are still outside the promised land [Music] to the book of nehemiah hallelujah examine yourself whether you be in the faith hallelujah hallelujah if you know the book of esther it's close to nehemiah because some will go into the new testament [Music] everybody okay let's go to nehemiah chapter 13. i'm gonna stop somewhere because of time let's go to nehemiah chapter 13. are you there verse one if you dare you can say amen few people we are in the message we are in the message how did you enter in a message i'm a message believer i'm a message believer investigate how did you believe the message [Music] oh you were just born in a message and grew up in a message that's why you believe the message how did you believe the message oh you were looking for a good looking woman that is more a good woman because you tired of the women in the world that's why you wanted her and you find yourself in the message because the shaking is coming and the shaking already happened and it's gonna check you to see if you really believe the message ask the people that stay there go ask some of them how did they believe the message you want to hear them know my friend who took me to church and then we just ended up going to church and after 20 years somebody come and take them off the message and you wonder how can this man this man really which man really the problem is go ask him how did he enter in the message you will see something that will tell you the reason why they left the message either they came because their parents were there some came because money some came because of a lot of stuff that will determine why they stay there don't be afraid ask them how did your family come in the message you're going to understand who preached to you the message did you really met the message did you really talk to the message did you really make a contact with the message everybody here ever here do you have a date that you can say the message came to me now i know the message [Music] oh this is what i grew with this is what we believe and i'm happy with it i don't see anything wrong i told you i'm gonna rock your boat anybody okay hallelujah brother kelly watch this verse 1 nehemiah 13 i'm gonna stop somewhere on that day they read in the book of moses the prophet in the audience of the people and darwin was found written that the ammonite and should water not come into their [Music] is god contradicting himself you need a prophet hallelujah forever in other words there is no way out sister roof how did you come in hallelujah verse 2 because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but higher bellum against them that they should curse them however our god turned the curse into the blessing israel was going back to the promised land after they were taken to captivity as they were going back to the promised land brother kelly a big church they all were coming up we believed the message we believed the message we believed the message we stood for the message when they got to a spot the priest said stop pulled the prophet they took the word they opened moses they said the number is too big hello we need to read you the word when they write the word they say they say by the prophet by the word no more about nominee should enter into this congregation forever so that means when israel was going there's notice that some women didn't look like israelites everybody here everybody here when they look at them they heal us so high you don't know really what the texture is on first book they have fair skin if you meet them they're black what is going on this doesn't look like israel here this is not like israel ever here the priest says stop maybe we are dealing with something here verse 3 now we come to pass when they had heard the law that they did water from israel all the white brother kelly when israel left egypt a mixed multitude follow them when israel went to captivity they began to go to the promised land they found that there were some that were carrying they look they say this nose is not a jewish nose jump to verse 23 and i'm going to stop someone here you there verse 23 in those days also so are jews from the people of judah okay da had married wife of who ashdog of who and of who contrary to what god said everybody okay and their children spoke half in the speech of the ashdog and could not speak in the water so when they begin to talk to their children they don't sound like message believer children those children knows everything about 50 cents they know all the rap music they know all the night club if you go to their school they are as popular as all the other children there is no difference how did you get in this message were you born oh dude did the lord touch you and you believe the message oh you were born in the message oh you came because your friend is in the message oh you came because you were looking for a wife or you were looking for a husband how did you come in this message let's talk let me see your language do you know the church i just know do you know they say no did you listen to ten messages no how about five no two no one i'm not sure you are 20 years old you are 16 years old you need to watch yourself you are in the family but you are not in judah anybody okay they spoke they could not speak in the jewish language but according to the language of each people pagan worldly children if you sit with them you say do you know in the message in the message the rising of the sun everybody quiet everybody here if you turn around you say do you know uh there is an actor in hollywood that actor and you see all of them open up like canon everybody want to say something yes i know him he was married to so and so they went to england oh his dress was 90 million dollars they have a car all of them open up their guns it is telling you where they are they came by marriage but they are in the outside talk to them about politicians talk to them about who is saying so do you know this one do you know this oh he's a wealthy man is this this they know ever they're gonna describe you in detail and when you sit you just watch them you just you say how do you know all of this how do you know everything like this everybody here how do you know other oh do you know no no no we know him he's on tick tock he's the talking to talking so how do you know everything like this just open up the canon they don't like spiritual atmosphere [Music] the people that speak about the word of god it burns them they don't like in an environment brother problem said the bible says it shocked them they want to have some time they want to be free not all the time brother branham brothers take me out take me out they want us some free time it's too much of this stuff all the time how did you enter in the message you were born in the message you were married to somebody the showdown is coming anybody okay let me handle this and then i got to stop somewhere here hallelujah and i contended verse 25 with them and cursed them am i reading a different bible i curse them and smooth certain of them so when the priest sees that something rose a righteous indignation on the priest say this is this is what you have what is going on like this am i reading a different bible hey mary please go go back to your bible i'm not going to slap anybody in this church go back in the bible i must slap you with a scripture though go up in the bible let's go let's i want everybody to see because some of you are ah no open your bible and i contended with them and did what come out and did work and let's continue indeed what and made them do what saying you shall not give your daughters to their son not take their daughter to your son or to your wife did not solomon king of israel seen by this ever here yet among many nations there were no king like him who was beloved of gifted of his god and god made him king of israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women crossed water job to verse 30 thus cleansing them from all water and appointed the words of the priest and liver everyone into his water they took all of those children and they kicked them out all of you go back where you came from getting married into the family you are still vulnerable to be kicked out you're not there yet and let me stop here because i'm gonna go go to first king chapter 11 the gift took time first king chapter 11 and then i'll let you go home and you chew on this look how you get into the message if you're staying in that marriage because you just need a husband something is wrong you need to go now beyond your marriage everybody care because sometimes some of the marriage because you are a lot of trouble verse 11 11 verse 1 but king solomon loved many strange women let me ask you a question was solomon from the land of judah from which trouble because he was the son of david right how can judah marry a woman and god is striking by roof garden and nobody say nothing yet both of them are judah this message this message let's go and king solomon love many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of moabites ammonite edomite zardonian and high tax of the nations concerning which the lord said to the children of israel you shall not go into them neither shall they come into you for surely they will turn away your heart after the what we already talked about this in a hotel so solomon clung to this in what your filio he's just so cute he's better than some of the message believer you know i just sit with them we've been working together she's good i didn't see anything wrong with her because our women have high temper you money the zipporah sometimes if you need a coach you see me everybody here everybody oh no no no they're good that's why i married her and she said she has nothing with coming to our church and he had 700 wives it takes two years or something for him to come back to the first one princess and three because there's 365 days so [Music] that's why stay away from polygamy stay away the men can the man can demand can one you already have blood pressure you wanna handle too i'm going to bury you and 300 concubines stay with your wife and 300 concubine and his wife turn away his heart look at the wisdom of solomon but he could not control them anybody care i'm almost done for he came to pass when solomon was old when his strength began to decrease do you know why they were there till he was old do you know how solomon was do you remember when solomon was taken out of the throne when his son got into the throne israel came to solomon and said please your father yoke upon us was too strong please decrease what your father did solomon was a strong disciplined man he makes israel work harder and the economy of israel went higher but under legalistic because he went outside of the word of god he tried to control things by law they waited till he get tired then when they see his gun don't shoot good no more they say we got him now now he's not as strong he can't yell anymore anybody care and he's that his wife verse 4 turn away his heart after the water and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father for solomon went after asterisk the goddess of the sardonia and after malcolm the abomination of the ammonite and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father then did solomon built a high place can you imagine for chemos the abomination of the moabite of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for moloch is the abomination of the children of water question and then i close here and we're going to pick it up these women came married to judah brother stephen you said judah was the door why are these children god even remind the children of israel in nehemiah telling them you remember what solomon did that was bad i thought if you married through judah you're okay and matter of fact brother stephen you say that roof was married outside the promised land but if you look at this they were they were married in the promised land so why are they bad i'm helping you with your question before you ask me i'm just asking myself okay why why why before you reason don't go home reasoning let me handle it why you ready then i close here you ready these women got married when they were younger and solomon was tough and solomon could control the home solomon could control the wife and for advantage of a wealthy man like solomon for advantage of a wealthy of having a husband because i stood so long nobody's coding me for advantage of trying to find a wife because i like her the way her shape looks like for advantage that woman hold off because she want to get a husband that men hold off because she just want to get a good wife those children hold off because if you don't do what daddy say in the message my daddy will kick us out of home so we gotta stay in our home and do what daddy do by law so that we can stay with our home and daddy will pay my school fee and he will buy me my car but one day when i will go i will get 18 years old when i can go to my home i will do what i want to do everybody okay what i'm trying to say is no matter the years these women live in israel they never were converted [Music] they were in israel condoning to the religion of israel but they were still hiding their gods waiting for an opportunity to show up the color as soon as they are independent they can come to church no more and daddy cannot tell them anymore because daddy doesn't pay my bill i live in my own apartment i can choose what i want i don't have to be in your church anymore [Music] i was just waiting to transfer to transfer to another university then i'm off if i transfer to another university i'm going to move away from my parents then i can live my own life [Music] but ruth was different ruth said naomi where you go i will go with you when you die i will die your god your god will be my god in other words i'm rejecting the other god i'm clinging to a new god that is the difference let's stand which step are you in with the lord the tabernacle help you see whether you are in the other court in the holy place or the holiest i gave you description of somebody who lived in the other code i gave you description of somebody who lived in a holy place if you miss this sermon you need to go back and listen to it and if you're a young man go back and review it two three times so you understand the language of god i don't care if my now roof is unfolding as more and giving us more clue how to really enter the tabernacle how did you come into judah how did you come in the message you came in the message because you were born into it and that's why you come to church you need now to leave that state if you're coming to this church because mommy and daddy are brought in here brought you here they bro they are bringing you to this church you need to move from there and see the god that we're talking about you need to meet the lord jesus christ yourself and make sure that if my daddy backs leading i am here if my daddy leave the message me and not the message i am not going to leave the message all we seen is if daddy leave the message they're all families there is nobody who can push the break where was that family at where are the children that can stand they say daddy you preach to us this message i met the god of this message if you choose to leave the message not me [Music] if daddy doesn't want to come to church i can drive i will get in the car we will go to church you stay at home if my husband doesn't want to come to church i will drop to church i am not going to hell because of you if my wife doesn't want to come to church i would drive if you are late at church every day we got two cars i love you honey you drop your car i'm going to drop the other one i don't want to be late in church that's where you want to be how did you enter in the message did you enter by meeting the door did you meet judah or you enter by relationship or you enter because you are looking for a wife or you enter because you are looking for a husband or you enter because you were friend to the people in the message and the more you want to hang out with them you suddenly find yourself believing what they believe in but you truly don't understand why you believe in what they're believing you just found yourself doing everything they want to do [Music] this is why you see the carnality in the message why you see the prejudice in the message why you see people acting the way they acting why you see preacher acting the way that they're acting why you see people forming clicks people that don't like other or if that pastor is white i'm not going to be his pastor you see that if that pastor is black no my pastor have to be black or my pastor have to be white or my person have to be hispanic or he must be canadian or he must be this all other carnality go check them how did they believe the message how did they enter in the message because your first husband must die marion must die killian must die that relationship must be ended i am not saying divorce your husband but what but but but the hook you are holding to you must cut that off you need something more sure you need an anchor that if my husband goes to hell not me a bigger husband god kill him but they have about every girl move on she didn't say i love my husband if you kill my husband kill me too no you're going to the grave yourself i'm telling you why you wearing tight dresses because my husband loved it why are you wearing a splitter my husband didn't say something is wrong [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly this morning again father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father i don't want to hold the people too long i have to stop where i stop but lord at least one point was taken across that they need to examine their self whether they are in the faith no there is a lot of shaking that is happening there is a lot of things that are coming because the coming of the lord is imminent and we can see clearly prophecy we can see how the pressure are building up for another third world war but we know we're not going to be here because lord before any atomic bomb drop will be outlawed but we don't want to say that because it's just a coat because it thinks that the preachers say but father we want to examine ourself whether we truly believe whether we really met you whether we had a personal experience that we can say that it's true i was born in this message but i remember one day i had an experience with god it's true something happened to me i was brought by a son i was brought by a friend i was brought to the message by a neighbor because i saw them living good but one of this day i met a god of this message and today the one who brought me the message is already backslidden but i am still there because i met the god that's what we want to see that's where i want the young men to see that's where i want the order to see whether they were born in the mercy whether they were 20 years in the message whether 40 years in a message father bring them a searching in their life that this can live from the religious send point of going to sunday in the morning versus it becomes a relationship a life that you are speaking to them when they are cooking you are speaking to them when they are driving you are speaking to them when they're sitting at home you are speaking to them all the life began to get wrapped up around you lord may you help everybody in this church may they don't miss this opportunity to examine their life lord and to make sure that they're standing in the faith and if there is somebody lord father this morning that is not where they are supposed to be father may you touch the heart the altar is if you know your life that you were born in this message and if you know in your heart that you are not where you supposed to be doing because the life that you live is telling you exactly that you are just wearing those dresses because that's how you grow up but truly your heart is pulling for things of the world your heart your desire your appetite is to project yourself in some kind of a world because the message world is too boring for you may you wake up may you fix and make your life correct with the lord the soldier is open if you need to pray you need to come and pray if you have to pray where you standing you need to stay right there because the true altar is in your heart where you
