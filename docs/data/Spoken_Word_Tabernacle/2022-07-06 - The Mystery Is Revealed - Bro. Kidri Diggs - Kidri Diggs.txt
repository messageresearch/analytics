is it a praise report where'd he go where's brother angela okay my bad i forgot he was singing tonight sorry i had my eyes closed you want to do it right there they praise reports okay go ahead i just want to give a few testimonies um first one a few couple months ago my voice just started hurting out of nowhere it wasn't really hurting it really just started off as a ringing sound and it just kept on getting worse and worse and worse and we're not saying like if that's when it started hurting then it'll crack like i was like just randomly i'm pretty sure y'all heard it when i was singing the last couple of times um there was a line here when i forgot the preacher's name but um i came here on the line to pray for my voice because it was like it's been already it's already been a month and it was just hurting and i prayed about it um the pastor prayed about it um now like i don't know i like i just stopped thinking about it and now i just realized that it stopped hurting no more my voice isn't hurting anymore everything's good the second testimony was saturday when i was driving back home my check engine light came on i was like god i'm not trying to pay like go to the auto shop or do none of this so i just prayed about it and i believed on the spoken word sunday when i was uh i came here my check engine light was still on i was i still prayed about i still believe i was like lazarus rose like after like three days so i'm like well i started the same god um and monday when i was going to the gym i turned on my car i wasn't even thinking about it i just seen the check edge line was off i was like praise god he did exactly what i expected him to do and the last testimony was i think i've been trying to get my passport for now like two years but they can't we kept on going back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth and the last time i applied was in january usually it takes at most two months to get your passport first time we were going back and forth for like a year we just stopped they sent our paper back the money went to waste second time we just started going back and forth the expert dna test proof of residency proof of that i live with my mom proof that my mom is my mom this night and the third um then what last time then like the last letter they sent my mom uh she didn't want to open it i didn't want to open it because like what are they going to ask now because we've sent nearly everything we could think of even the stuff like we couldn't even think of we sent it because we just didn't want to go back and forth with them um so the last step they said was like um just send your pictures because everything you have is already um is already in line so we sent that two weeks later i finally got my password after two years of trying so i just want to praise the lord about that amen be careful now because you put it in the drawer and it'll expire mine always did just right there laying in the drawer it'll go i got one prayer request this evening um this old gout devil just won't leave brother daley alone it's back on his feet again and uh i i don't know that i've ever experienced it have you brother greg or brother michael anybody brother samus yeah don't ask yeah so we just want to pray that that thing just gets off of him and he can wear normal shoes and walk without pain or i've heard if the sheet touches your foot it'll hurt you know so i just um i'm sympathizing with my brother we're the same age so that scares me and i just want to um you want to come well brother greg come on up and pray for our brother come on up yes ma'am sister um diamond a what an eye surgery okay okay and i want to i want to remember my daughter too her her wisdom teeth are coming through and she's very uncomfortable and nauseous yes sir oh yeah my bad i'm sorry okay this is uh pray for um i might mess this up regender death is that right um he is suffering from severe stomach pain he is on the stream that's right

heads father once again lord as we gather here father to we only come for one purpose father that's to hear from you lord and we ask you lord we we invite you here lord and your word says wherever

privilege to be here again and man we thank god for your pastor amen amen hallelujah it's good to see everybody if you have your bibles let's turn to um ephesians ephesians chapter 3 ephesians 3 by the grace of god amen you know sometimes you have to laugh at the devil because it comes with he comes with those wild attacks wild attacks like we don't know who we are you know i i i i go to the gym i go to a gym uh of a of a boxing trainer and one thing about a professional boxer his skill set is a little different because he can throw and defend himself and if you come wildly at him he'll remind you keep your hands up and sometimes i believe god allows the enemy to come wildly at us so we can keep our guards up you know this is not a time to fret or to be afraid but to know god give he he's given us something hallelujah that we can stand and fight with and it's truth amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn to ephesians chapter 3 hallelujah ephesians chapter 3 verse 1. the bible says for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ see listen to paul paul is saying you're going to understand the mystery the mystery is no longer hidden it's going to be revealed by my ministry amen hallelujah he says which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power amen let's go to revelations chapter 10 verse 7 hallelujah revelations 10 and 7. familiar verse of scripture but the bible says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished that's why it's very important to know this voice because this voice is finishing a mystery he said as he have declared to his servants the prophets amen may the lord have blessed you reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know by by the grace of god uh i want to use for a subject the mystery is revealed the mystery is revealed hallelujah you know if we would think of the hour we in the mystery of god and we know our prophet he came and preached a message the mystery of christ revealed but one thing we got to understand that anything that is a mystery is hidden hallelujah anything that is a mystery i'm i'm about to say something that is going to kind of catch you off guard but anything that you receive as a mystery is still in darkness hallelujah so if you believe this message to be a mystery you're living in darkness so that's why hallelujah god sent a prophet to bring us into the marvelous light because paul said these things have been hidden from all ages but paul said i've come to reveal a mystery i've come to bring you into the light hallelujah and i love how the prophet of god our prophet malachi 4 when it came down to it he said i preached what paul preached hallelujah and paul said i'm no longer preaching a mystery but i'm preaching the revealing of god he said i'll show you a mystery hallelujah if you show me something it's no longer hidden it's revealed hallelujah but churchill we look and we we understand hallelujah the times we're in the bible says in the days of the voice the mystery of god shall be finished that's why we are not looking for another voice if you're looking for another voice you're still in darkness because you're living under a mystery and if anything is a mystery to you that mean it's hidden we are in the last days and if we are proclaiming to be abraham's seed hallelujah god said unto abraham under the spirit under the spirit of obedience i will not hide anything from abraham so faith is not a mystery faith is a revealing [Music] but as we look church and we read the scripture god hallelujah he talked in parables and we go to mark the fourth chapter and he began to talk about a soul without the soul and he began to sow on certain kinds of ground and he said some fell by the wayside holly some fell among thorns and and some were choked out and and on and on he said but some fell on good ground hungaria and that that fell on good ground hallelujah it came forth and if it came forth that means the life inside the sea was no longer hidden that means the life inside the seed was no longer a mystery because it fell on good ground now holy we know that the seed was the word of god hallelujah but the word of god fell among thorns and it was choked up now people are presenting that there was something wrong with the word no it's the ground it's the ground that couldn't contain it's the ground that couldn't let loose the [Music] mystery there's nothing wrong with the word holly but look look when jesus began to talk to them he he preached and he began to speak in in mystery form and then the disciples they came and they said lord why do you speak to them like that why do you talk to them in parables and jesus said it's very plain because it ain't for them so for those who don't understand this message jesus said it very plainly it's not for them they'll hear it but they won't understand it they'll see it but they still don't know what they're looking at why because they are in darkness [Applause] don't get mad at us because he gave us ears to hear [Applause] see this message to a true believer is not in mystery format it's a revealing it's an open book it's a manifestation of something what is it is christ being revealed [Music] and for those who can't see that they're looking for something else proving they are only in darkness [Music] listen let's catch it let's catch a church he said why are you preaching them in parables he says not giving it to them to understand holy and it looks like you look at what's going on now people are trying to take the message and twist it around honey when we can hear plainly what he was saying plainly why because it's not a mystery to us god gave us ears to hear hallelujah he gave us eyes to see what are we seeing the revealing of god because whenever a prophet came he came to reveal god's mind samuel god's mind hallelujah came to reveal god's mind every prophet hallelujah that ever came they had what god thoughts were what were they doing they were unreal revealing the mystery of god oh my look look he said it's given unto you to understand these things to understand he said whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ but then hallelujah the prophet comes and he says i'll show you a greater mystery christ in you the hope of glory see that's what everybody's missing they're trying to put it on brother branham but no put it on me put it on you because the mystery is not in one man the revealing of god is in a body the revealing of god is in the people i'll show you a mystery hallelujah when you lay hands on somebody hallelujah it's the revelation of jehovah rapha living in you when you bless somebody let's just say financially it's the revelation of jehovah jireh inside of you [Music] the mystery is no longer just a book the mystery is the revealing of a person that's why the holy ghost can't be a tone holly it can't be just a gift holly it's a person [Music] that's where denominations get twisted up holly they try to make it a gift or a dust or that no it's a person [Music] that's why the prophet came to reveal the person of christ because billy graham couldn't do that all robbers couldn't do that and all the other reformers before them couldn't do that hollywood that's why beyond the curtain of time brother brother was saying real problems could be here he said yeah paul's gonna be here he said well i preached what he preached and everybody that heard him say that everybody that understood what the prophet preached up in heaven they said we're resting on that [Applause] somebody ought to say tonight i see it i see it i see what god was talking about i see it it's been revealed god is in me he's in you i see it listen listen church see the whole purpose of god was to reveal himself god wanted to have relations so he had to reveal himself there was so much in god god was so mysterious you know what he did he allowed the fall why so he could reveal himself [Music] he allowed sisters to get sick why so he could show the power healing that prayer hadn't left with the prophet with prayers now hallelujah and many members pride i'll show you a mystery hello the message didn't leave with the prophet the message is still behind skin that's why i'm not looking for another voice the voice is inside of us [Music] because he said in the days of the voice when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god will be finished there's nothing else coming after this voice but an unveiling of god [Music] [Applause] [Music] and you're sitting if you're sitting on the ministry who's always preaching in mystery format that means he's preaching darkness [Music] why would you want to sit on the ministry you can't understand hebrews hebrews says hollywood he's a reward of those that diligently seek him and to get anything from god you must first believe and know that he is see it's a revealing he is he is what a healer he is he is what a savior he is what a mighty conqueror he is a lord he is the one that triumphs he is never defeated you must first in real life he is that's why this brother could say satan i know it's just a wild attack but i know my god is greater that's why you can look at the doctrine and say i will not receive this death until satan get off my wife honey rise up he is the resurrection [Applause] mother and mary was speaking in mystery for me but jesus said i'ma make this thing clear holy the mystery of christ is standing with the mystery of god standing right before you she said lord if you was here my brother wouldn't die jesus said let me make this thing clear to you your brother ain't dead he sleeps but this she said lord even now whatever you ask the father god will do it holy she said but i know he'll rise again in the day of the resurrection she said he god said let me reveal something to you you waiting on a resurrection let me show you the opening of the word he looks at her and he says i am the resurrection i am the mystery of christ revealed i am god almighty revealed and it is finished there is no other art of me [Applause] she always came to open the words he always came to give the people a closer understanding of who he is and now for preachers and different people to try to take that away from us and look for another they put us back in darkness because what is a mystery i ain't gonna be too much longer i hope you all ain't looking for no punch lines i ain't got no punch lines or some special quote they're gonna make you say oh ah no find your place in what i'm preaching pull and rejoice and become the word and see if god will visit this church tonight [Music] what is a mystery this is why it's very important for us to understand what god brought in our day this is way beyond skin color [Applause] [Music] people stuck on the surface it's something deeper god used a man that couldn't mess it up who was simple enough just to preach what god put in his heart and not try to make it all mysterious because god never wanted to be mysterious he wanted to be revealed god was tired of being in hiding god was tired of being all by himself so he let satan do what he do hallelujah and satan said i'm gonna mess with eve i'm gonna do this i'mma get in creation and god say dummy what you about to do you're about to start the powers of redemption satan thought he was smarter than god but god used his own enemy to unlock his mystery the devil is a tool in god's hands and if he's messing with you all he's doing is unlocking the mystery in your life all he's doing is unlocking a mystery you ought to tell the devil i'm tired of being in hiding it's time for me to be unlocked sorry say you say well i'm gonna mess with eve i'm gonna mess with his wife and god is saying all you're gonna do is unlock my attributes dumb devil dumb devil all he's doing is giving us a testimony [Applause] [Music] look i'm one who preached on trials and tribulations to let you know that that's your strengthening that's your power i just got back from south africa last week and we had a camp meeting hallelujah and the youth leader hallelujah the youth leader got caught checked he was going to the store that night and he wanted to leave his son with his wife but his son two years old matthew he was very persistent like no daddy i won't go with you i want to go with you so he said no stay with your mama he's like i want to go to you i want to go to he never does that so this time his daddy takes him he goes up to the corner store and as he's coming out the store hold your three guys got him at gunpoint holly he says let my son go and y'all take me he said no they said no we taking both of you hallelujah we're taking both of you church he didn't have an expensive car he didn't have a mercedes anything like that he is just a simple corolla holiday and they took him hallelujah when they got him they locked him in it was pushed crapping them in everybody was getting in the car they looked at his son matthew two years old matthew look at all three robbers and he said [Music] [Applause] [Music] the power of a godly raised child with no fear in his heart look at those evil men as just regular men and he gave them a thumbs up and that thumbs up melted their hearts in the devil can you don't bring your child to church bring that child to church that child might be your protection one day matthew gave all of them a thumbs up and smiled at them rob us they talked to daddy hallelujah put them in the trunk roll he about six two six one rolled around with him for three hours in the trunk matthew inside never cried never kicked never screamed that was a nightmare on that boy but then church hallelujah they got to a place to where the car wasn't moving because they was watching it to see if the police were coming home and he was uh his name was uh uh jerome tyrone was stuck in the trunk hallelujah now he's in the trunk hey man can't can't get his hands on this boy holly but you know what holy living right living right your life can't be a mystery you got to live this gospel openly devil has to know who you are and these robbers saw the bible in his car and they got convicted and one of them popped the trunk came back to him he says hey we're not gonna harm you we're not gonna harm your son because we got children just sit here be still be patient with us and everything gonna be all right and they left them back they bought two more hours but one guy he kept coming back to the trunk telling him everything's gonna be all right don't worry we're not gonna harm your son time move on you come back again everything's gonna be all right don't worry we're not gonna harm you it's gonna be all right just continue to pray [Applause] your life has to unlock a mystery church in the miss holly in the midst when it looked like he should be losing his mind because the robbers were riding around with his son and he in the trunk god gave him peace [Music] then finally last time they popped the truck they told him get out he says look we're not going to do anything to you now let's make this real clear when the militants catch you hardly when they carjack you it's usually not a good ending they'll take you to the field put a bullet in your head and it's done but because matthew was persistent because he had his son with him hallelujah it was a different story hallelujah and now holly he tells him he says get out the car here's your money back here's your cards back here's your wallet back now what we want you to do we want you to go in that field and pray for 10 minutes when was the last time the devil told you to go pray while i escaped he knew who he was dealing with [Applause] he said you go pray you're a man of god you go on that field and pray for 10 minutes and after you finish praying go up there to the corner store and call you a ride while we leave so he went in the field he prayed called his wife came back to the camp meeting and told his testimony all the devil is doing is giving us a testimony [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't let your life be locked up under mystery but there's a revealing god is trying to get out of here let's take mystery for a second now this this is the youth leader because he was the one orchestrating everything and the devil said i can stop him i can stop the whole meeting but when the young people heard about what god did for him it was one girl hallelujah she was she lost her eyesight hallelujah and they said well she got diabetes and she needed more insulin and all these things that wasn't the case her body had too much insulin what it was is at the age of 15 she had cataracts so the doctor said okay it's going to take two weeks for us to operate she said no i can't miss the camp meeting so she started praying then all of a sudden a opening came up a week early and they operated hallelujah a week early and she was in a camp meeting with one eye one eye praising god what i worshipping god thanking god for opening the door why did the devil attack her eyes because she starts seeing salvation you watch how the enemy attacks your life he's trying to strip you from your power [Music] you watch how he attacks oh wow attacks and from there a young man heard about he he fell down the stairs he took all the ligaments in his knee he was on crutches and he had a cast on but he heard about this girl's testimony receiving her sight he ripped the cast off threw the keg that came down and he started walking back up those same stairs all of it started with the youth leader getting contact [Applause] so maybe the first miracle this week started in your house and god's getting the whole church preparing for something special hallelujah because he said holy without a shepherd the sheep was scattered so a lot of times god will take the shepherd through it first to give you an example to give you a testimony and by his testimony we all will overcome because if god did in the shepherd's life i got a right to experience the same grace so you get ready for your testimony i don't get envious when god do things in my pastor's life i pay attention i say lord you do you bless them like that praise god [Applause] that's the ministry i set up under praise god their blessings on blessings every time i turn around see blessings blessings every time i turn around i say blessings or blessings come on somebody we are the bride of christ we're not living under the mystery we are the revealing of this message [Music] listen let's make it clear what is a mystery i want to show you why it's very important not to be oh my that was deep i didn't understand it no that ain't what we want that ain't what we want that ain't what we want i don't want to sit up under somebody so deep i don't know what he talking about because god didn't use the messenger like that he used somebody playing hallelujah or kentucky hillbilly eating beans and onions and cornbread somebody who couldn't mess it up but nowadays these eight angels and eight and a half angels and seven seven and a half angels and all these people that are not even in the scripture but we got scripture in the days of the voice of the seventh angel not the eighth angel not the eighth and a half listen if they not following the seventh angel who they following [Music] the bible don't speak of another [Music] if they looking for another angel they're in darkness because he said when he began to sound the mystery of god will be finished [Applause] i ain't got time to argue whether the message is true or not i judge about my life i judge about what i used to be and what i am now what this message made me to be honest i don't even judge about brother branham's testimony i judge about my testimony what god did for me hallelujah i don't have to go to a demon i don't have to go to a mountain hallelujah i go to my old experience listen he says he says look mystery that's why it's very important for us to understand when you come to church you're not listening hallelujah to be under a mystery no you're looking for the revealing you're looking for the unfolding of god because he got tired of being a mystery listen a mystery anything that is kept secret and the message is no longer secret god took it all the way around the world seven times holiday look it says something uh anything that is kept secret or remains unexplained now look what god did through brother branham hallelujah god came and he began to break down the godheads stuff that they knew nothing about for years god used a man to put it together holly say it's not regards her father son the holy ghost is the manifestation of one person [Music] what was he doing he was stripping the secret away hallelujah look what did his ministry do his ministry showed us how to get healing in our lives his ministry showed us how to make it to heaven [Music] hallelujah if you take that away from us you put us back in darkness and i refuse to go back in darkness god has shown us the way and the things that were hidden for years god use a profit hug to strip the seals and open them up we got all the seals revealed that the white horse rider is no longer a mystery we know it's the antichrist he's been revealed holly and that gift was so precise he showed us harley the one that was riding the white horse was riding the red horse and the same one was riding the black horse and the sailor was riding the pear horse what was he he uncovered the whole mystery and you got these preachers come and try to make the seals mysterious no it's been revealed very simply [Music] they say oh the seventh seal ain't open i beg your pardon i beg your pardon because if it ain't open we have to be listening for another voice because he says in the days of the voice when he begin to sound the mission got to be finished so is the seventh seal open how do we know it's open okay let's make it plain the first four seals deal with the antichrist i'm not in there that has nothing to do with me that has nothing to do with you we not in there the fifth seal deals with the souls under the altar we're not in there hallelujah six seal deals with the jews i'm so not at you so where am i where are you then where are you church if you're not in a four if you're not in a five if you're not in the six where are you you must be in that seventh and if you're in that seventh that means you're no longer a mystery you've been revealed hallelujah because the prophet of god said the seventh seal deals with christ and his coming and his relationship with his pride and the opening of the word [Music] so where are you for those of you who still didn't catch it let's recap it let's recap it the first four seals deals with the antichrist hallelujah the pope paulie riding the devil holly riding changing masks we're not in there we're not in those first four horse riders fifth seal deals with the souls on the altar those that didn't get a chance to repent we're not in there six seal deals with the jews we're not jews so where am i where are you you must be in that coming of the lord and the seventh seal deals with the coming of the lord [Music] because remember malachi 4's ministry came to reveal two things earlier one here was restored the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers holy let the church be led by the holy ghost not a man we're not sitting on the moses's ministry we're sitting on the joshua [Music] the holy ghost is leading the church and he said the other thing his ministry came to do was to reveal those unknown seven thunders in the opening of the seals and we know that every time it thundered it was a voice of god [Music] and as he funded he uncovered a seal hallelujah he uncovered the first seal second seal first fourth seal holly fifth seal six seal and then he said hey i'm not gonna say anything about the seventh seal but we still caught it he didn't say anything about it on tape but we still caught it why because we are that seven sin [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we are the opening of the word [Applause] [Music] remember jesus said for those who it wasn't for they can't hear it they can't see it so how can we see it and hear it if he never said anything about it we must be the revealing of it we must be the revealing of that seven seed you are the opening of the word [Music] because remember when a word was spoken someone was already there to proclaim what's been said that's why john the baptist can say i'm the voice [Music] of one crying in the wilderness see he knew his place hallelujah hallelujah he knew his place when he wasn't even there when it was spoken i wasn't there when he preached the sales hallelujah but i was there that word came and found us and what did it say it said you are the manifestation of what the prophet preached see the thing is everybody knows who the groom is but nobody knows who the bride is [Music] see the bride she's specially elected by the groom it's all kind of women that's worthy but he has his own choice oh my i gotta come to a close [Music] and what god has used this voice to do to uncover every mystery so we're no longer living in darkness and listen he says any affair thing or person that proceeds feature that presents features or qualities so obscure as to arouse curiosity and that's what god has done has come holy and sent the word that the whole world couldn't receive but what did it do when you heard it it aroused your curiosity it made you say hey he said come and see her what the spirit is saying and you said i'm coming i'm coming but then you say like isaiah here i am lord use me remember the prophet god said he said calvary gave us the devil's answer [Music] you got the devil's answer [Music] oh my god he says any truth that is unknowable except by divine revelation that's what a mystery is any truth that's unknowable except by divine revelation now you give me another preacher that broke down the book of revelations besides malachi 4 everybody else was running from it nobody else knew nothing about it remember before god got him he said the white horse rider was christ but then god came and checked them god said you ain't gonna mess this up [Music] listen oh my god listen let's tell the truth about god for a second let's tell the truth about god look the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery is scripture that's why everybody can live this because it has to be revealed [Music] you know the bible says great is the mystery of godliness that's why they look at you sisters and say i just can't see how you weigh them long dresses because it's not revealed to them great is the mystery of godliness i just can't see why you ain't got no tattoo everybody doing it great is the mystery of godliness he said the mystery of scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation so even though we have the revelation there still is a supernatural element that remains what is that element let's make it real simple faith faith is that supernatural element because without faith it is impossible to please the lord remember he says when i return will i find a mystery will i find a book will i find a tape no he said well i find faith when i return but before before we get out of here hallelujah look let's tell the truth about god let's look at how god really was thinking look this is the prophecy the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to his people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it was too mysterious so what did god do god the prophet god said holy is that he said he was so high he couldn't go no higher so you know what he did he started to come down god said i'ma get on a level i'm gonna take away the mystery [Music] the prophet said he was just eternal he wasn't even god but as he started to come down brother simbo hallelujah he went from eternity to self-existing amen hallelujah that's him coming down from eternity to self-existing but you know when he became self-existing as elohim he still brought eternity with him wow boy my god is a bad boy [Applause] my god is a bad boy when he start condescending he didn't leave none of his self behind he brought everything that he was to the next stage [Applause] what was he doing he was bringing the mystery closer so he went from eternity to elohim now he's self-existing and then he stepped out of self-existence and became the logos did he start to create and he started to say let there be let there be what was creating eternity what was creating elohim all of us wrapped up in the logos all that god was he started to bring it down and he started let there be light and the scripture says that it was what was he doing he was uncovering the mystery of the earth because the earth was in darkness so god said let there be light and it was then he created the sun the moon stars animals and the last thing he created he created angels and the last thing he created he created a man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] i'll show you a mystery eternity came to elohim eternity elohim came to the logos the logos elohim eternity came to a man and he put all of that mystery in a man but before he got there he spoke into the mystery form to confuse everybody he says hey let us make man in our image let us make man in our image and i some people say well who was he talking to people talking to angels he was talking to that no he was talking to himself [Applause] [Music] because the only thing that could match up to who he was was eternity was the logos was elohim so he said let us make man in our image eternity was the only thing that could match up to his stature ello hill was the only thing that could match up to his statue creative power was the only thing that could match up to his stature you say come on brother these god talking to himself well let me ask you a question don't you talk to yourself don't you talk to yourself don't you talk to yourself don't you i don't know about you but sometimes i wake up and i might be feeling a little bad and i tell the devil oh no it ain't going down like that today god gave me power over unclean spirits i'm the head and not the town don't you talk to yourself [Applause] let us create man in our image and then god takes all eternity all self-existing power all created power and puts it in a man and you know what church god was so satisfied after he uncovered that mystery he never did anything else the bible said he rested [Music] brothers what are you saying there's no more revealing out of us after he got to us there's nothing else to be revealed [Applause] after he got to us the bible said god when he took a rest [Music] and just to show you that it's true just to show you that it's true as god condescended the rose now is in on us so we begin to us and we are seeing first with what creative power third pool ministry then we are seeing hallelujah with the logos then we are seeing harley back in heaven with god living for eternity the mystery has been revealed in you [Music] [Music] somebody say me somebody say me after god got to me he stopped after god got to meet somebody say me somebody say me after god got to me there was no more revealing that the god got to me there was no more unfolding after god got to me there was no more mystery [Applause] [Music] [Music] that's why the profit you be careful don't listen to these scoffers trying to take you away from this message if you let them take you away from this message they'll put you back in darkness because this message is the only thing that can tell you who you are because look let's make it real plain why the voice of the seven major because it's real plain and simple holly amen i was born after 65. so i wasn't here when the literal body of the prophet was here i wasn't here but you know when i was born billy graham was still here why didn't i connect with his message all rivals were still here why didn't i connect with his prosperity gospel because those messengers couldn't unlock who i was [Applause] it took the voice of the seventh angel and when he began to sound the mystery of god was finished [Applause] that's why we could come alive by just a voice but just a magnetic tape reading a book why because we're connected to a voice not a person [Music] [Applause] born after 1965 but then one day i heard something say good evening friends i heard something say good evening friends and some started to say i started to come alive and the more i had it the stronger i got it then i began to realize who i was i know who i am church the mystery of god is finishing you before i close it's very important for us to be hearing unleavened bread [Music] because the word we're hearing is in seed form so i got c's in my hand oh we finna strip the devil boy we shouldn't give him a black eye we shouldn't give him a fat black guy look here what i have in my hand is seed form but you don't know what it is and see for it ain't no good and seed i can take these seeds put them on a pulpit and preach and preach and preach they'll never come to life they'll never come to life just sitting in church that seed needs something because satan sailor he tried to make you feel bad about all your mistakes and all this stuff sis hallelujah the only way these seeds can come forward hallelujah what's the element to bring forth this life dirt every seat needs dirt all your mistakes made you who you are all your shortcomings all your failures is a part of your revealing these elbows i made mistakes you needed that dirt to come forward [Music] without that dirt you'd never come out of your shell so god uses the dirt hallelujah to compact the seed hallelujah to come pack the shell and did it get so dry hallelujah to the real life's beginning to break out and dirt causes the activation of the mystery to come forward that's why we all got testimonies of where we came from has a promise in it [Music] every seed has a promise and if it's planted in the right ground that promise has to come forward and if you have to see the god in you you're full of promises you're full of promises and you know what there'll come a time in everybody's life holly what a mystery can no longer be contained the dirt can no longer hold it it starts to feel the presence of the sun and it starts to moving it starts to shaking it starts to rump in its head out and the next day you know ah i'm out of here i'm revealed i'm in his presence [Applause] see me for who i am i'm no longer a mystery [Music] what happened it feels the presence of the sun and the sun begins to pull that secret out of it until it pushes out fruit don't be satisfied with just sitting in a message church i want your fruit and until i can eat off your life you are indebted to me because i'm hungry i want what god gave you [Music] and look the power of having fruit is the reproduction of the seed because the seed is now in the fruit and then you plant the testimony all over again come on musicians i'm closing come on come on musician see god never wanted to be mysterious so be careful for these people who try to take you away from the message and say that there's something else there's this this that what else is there to be revealed he said when he began to sound the mystery of god it's finished holiday the greatest mystery is understanding calvary because calvary ties in with revelation 10 7. because they both are saying the same thing because when jesus gave up the ghost what was his last words it is finished so this message should bring you to calvary showing you that it's finished and there's nothing that the devil can do once god is revealed to you [Music] so let's not fear let them say what they want to say let them take down pictures let them do whatever look my salvation is not in a picture i'm wrapped up tied up in the blood and knowledge of christ and as long as i got jesus i'd be all right church from now on let this be your testimony it ain't about brother branner it's about me it's about you so when they try to show you brother graham did this brother ram did that he did it he said you say so what's that got to do with me i i'm gonna get real country right now i'm home i'm just i'm in carolina right i'm gonna get real country what that got to do with me i don't met the lord i don't met my god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they need to go back and read their bible we rebecca met isaac she didn't even get ali's a thank you call [Music] [Applause] it was over you never heard anything else about elisa [Music] we thank god but too many people trying to get rid of eliza no he did his part we can't get rid of them you know why because eliezer was the only one who knew the way back to abraham's house [Music] so stay with this message if you stay with this message i guarantee you you will get back to god the father you will get back home [Music] [Applause] i guarantee you [Music] let's give god some praise come on let's give him some praise [Music] let's give him some praise [Music] come on let's give him a prayer let's give god [Music] come on church let's lift him up [Music] hallelujah give him some praise hallelujah [Music] my god what else do you want me what else should i tell you he was not here when we were preaching and he summarizes all back left and right and put it up together what else do you want me to tell you this is god this is god hallelujah i always say this message cannot be complicated we cannot leave the church and spinning around like we don't understand no the ministry was sent to make the message so plain because what branham said when god had the information he had the information with the purpose to make the promise so plain that the seed can receive it the mystery is revealed what else can i say amen the trial are you going through it's not a trial it's not an opportunity for him to unfold himself more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more look every time you go to a trial after the trial what happened to you you are even stronger than before amen he's going to bring you through a bear then he increase the power a little bit and bring a lion and then guess what there is another one that is coming up goliath and guess what then you can use the bear and the lion to defeat goliath anybody here so the trial you're going today is going to be a stepping stone a seed for you to use tomorrow to attack the next trial if the devil understood this thing the bible says heaven they know they would not have crucified the prince of peace if they knew all of this if they have seen this church they should have left jesus alive and back here because we are not in the first seal we are not in the second city we are not in the third seal we are not under the ministry of the antichrist we are not under the souls on the altar and the sick sill is even tribulation the bread can never go to tribulation remember boaz that's why he opened the first the second the sec the third the fourth the sixth measure of barley and he stopped like rebecca the seven it's me amen the seven it's me ruth the seven is me but that seven is not me alone i cannot share it myself i must have a bread [Music] amen do you know the woman at the well which husband jesus finally met which number why did jesus find him when he had the six not the first not the second not the third only when he reached six then jesus come he said you already have six now number seven belongs to me [Applause] amen number seven is the sabbath it's the resting that belongs to me and that seven turn that woman upside down and the whole city was on fire from a woman that was a prostitute to somebody who's speaking about the son of man ministry all the dirt that was collected all the husband that were collected was to manifest christ the pharisee didn't have that only that woman could manifest it he said sir i perceive that you are uh at the beginning he heard christ as a prophet did you hear that did you hear that the first time he heard the voice of christ he heard it as a prophet he recognized it as a prophet and jesus pulled him beyond the prophet he said it's okay i am a prophet but look behind the prophet i am the messiah so when this message pull you out you look behind the message you're gonna find the very person of jesus christ because he's number seven [Music] and we got all seven lines up seven seals seven churches seven messengers set every seven line that what else do go go in the world to see what number seven seven in lottery means i don't play lottery they know what it means anybody here but we have the original the seven finish everything when he created man then god because game is over because that man is responsible to do exactly what i was supposed to do in the earth i created the earth i'm too busy with the universe i was looking for somebody that looks like me exactly like me when i look i look in him i look at myself i say we the same dna this is your property it's called earth management anybody here back here so when god brings you into the knowledge of yourself because god wanted to rest so you manage this earth anybody okay you have the power brad you have the power the brother was rightly in line and anointed he doesn't even know what i have at home to preach everybody later on as we move on you will understand them better and better amen this is god blessing this church brother kadri god richly bless you thank you for submitting yourself always a pleasure and always a a tremendous blessing to this church amen our hearts are mind clear you feel strong now ready to go back amen remember when you wake up in the morning he stayed here tell the devil ah the day ain't going down like this we're not going like this if you started i'm going to end up with a testimony he started attacking me i ended up with a testimony and when he was preaching here he said the youth leader the youth leader and i say my god i hope the church can catch it he's telling them if he started with the top with the head it's coming down and suddenly he turned around and he spoke it brother god richly bless you i don't know what to say stay blessed continue to be blessed don't fear nothing [Music] you're moving by your right you know who you are there is nothing adequate amen there's nothing god can put on you that you cannot handle that one scripture can knock every devil down somebody told me he said buddy stephen i don't want to crush you with a lot of stuff you already you always busy already i said no i was trained to take care of diseases i was not trained for people to come i said what do you want i'm doing fine my teeth are fine i just want to see you that was not what i was trained i was trained when somebody come what is going on my tooth hurt then i'm already in a job that's why jesus said i was not saying for the people that are here [Music] anybody here i was send for the people that got trouble so when you start having trouble in the church oh my god that's when i'm fine pastor i want to see you as a praise the name of the lord now it's time for me to start pulling. you see me sweating it's the anointing here let's pray heavenly father lord what a tremendous blessing tonight that you have given to us the showers of blessing coming down from heaven [Music] and giving us victory in every single aspect of our lives by just one night into your praises father we thank you for your servant that you use how you help him yield himself completely completely out of the way
