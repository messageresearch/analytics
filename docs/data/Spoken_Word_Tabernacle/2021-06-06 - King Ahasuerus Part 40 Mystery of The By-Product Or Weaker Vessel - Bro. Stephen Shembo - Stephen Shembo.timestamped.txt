[30:01] this morning there was a scripture
[30:05] that came
[30:10] from the bible app excuse me i'm sorry
[30:14] and it just spoke to me
[30:20] um
[30:22] and it just reminded me i know brother
[30:24] stephen was talking about
[30:26] you know giving god praise
[30:29] and i don't think we give him enough
[30:31] glory
[30:35] i'm sorry i was going to read the
[30:36] scripture but you'll understand it by
[30:38] the song
[30:39] um basically the scripture was talking
[30:40] about um giving thanks onto god
[30:42] and just giving him the praises that he
[30:44] deserves um and it just
[30:46] for some reason had a profound um
[30:49] effect on me this morning i was like you
[30:51] know a lot of times i go to church
[30:54] and you know you rush you come to
[30:56] worship god but yet he gets just a
[30:58] little bit just a little clap just a
[31:00] little song
[31:01] just a little you know emotion and then
[31:04] after that you go back to your normal
[31:06] life like as if he doesn't exist
[31:08] and so this morning um i want to sing
[31:10] this song as a testimony but also as a
[31:12] praise unto god just for what he's doing
[31:15] and my life and not only my life but a
[31:17] lot of people's life
[31:19] and that i just want to let know that
[31:21] he's that we're thankful for
[31:23] for everything he's doing but just to
[31:24] encourage anyone who is struggling
[31:29] he's able as a song
[31:34] exceedingly
[31:38] abundantly
[31:41] above all
[31:46] can't ask him for

[32:21] he's going to fulfill
[32:25] every point

[40:28] yesterday i was talking to brother kelly
[40:30] and i started to share a little bit of
[40:32] my testimony with him
[40:34] and when i look back on where god
[40:36] brought me from a lot of you don't know
[40:37] my testimony and
[40:39] if you come and ask me i'll share it
[40:40] with you but there was one point in my
[40:42] life when i was 17 years old
[40:45] that that i got too far from god i
[40:48] started straying and i started becoming
[40:50] a hindrance in the church
[40:52] and it resulted in my pastor kicking me
[40:54] out of the church
[40:55] i was in a message church but that's the
[40:57] way the pastor felt led
[40:58] he felt led to kick me out because i was
[41:00] such a hindrance
[41:02] but that's what it took for my life to
[41:04] get sincere with god
[41:06] that's what it took and he knew that and
[41:08] god knew that and he had a lot of
[41:10] persecution for that oh you kicked a 17
[41:12] year old out of church
[41:13] no one understood but god knew what i
[41:16] needed
[41:17] and that's what it caused for me to dig
[41:19] in dig into the word
[41:21] dig into the message and get sincere
[41:23] with god
[41:24] and it gives it gave me a heart now for
[41:27] young people
[41:28] because i struggled and you really got
[41:30] to get in and know god for yourself
[41:32] because if you don't know god for
[41:33] yourself you'll grow comfortable
[41:35] being raised in the message so you gotta
[41:37] dig in
[41:38] and know god for yourself have a
[41:40] personal experience
[41:42] and don't let your life go through the
[41:43] muck and mire like mine did
[41:45] grab a hold of god early that's what our
[41:47] pastor's been teaching
[41:49] before the black dog can be released
[41:51] grab a hold
[41:52] know where you stand know what you
[41:54] believe give it to god
[41:56] so that you can move forward and not
[41:57] have the scars that i had to have
[42:00] but in the end of the day he made a way
[42:03] he made a way for me to be
[42:04] here he made a way for me to be part of
[42:06] the bride
[42:07] he called me to this just being in
[42:09] church just being a member of the bride
[42:11] that's what he called me to
[42:12] and i'm grateful i'm grateful so when i
[42:15] sing this song
[42:16] and i say i look back on what he brought
[42:18] me from and i'm grateful
[42:19] i don't know why but i'm grateful it's
[42:22] personal to me
[42:23] because i saw my life in the past and i
[42:25] saw what god brought me to
[42:26] and i'm grateful church
[42:30] made a way
[42:34] and you moved in stupid

[50:56] probably when we get in
[50:57] a building it's not really that it's

[51:04] here then get into the building and

[53:12] last sunday and remember you need this
[53:15] to understand
[53:16] why the gospel seems to be tough
[53:20] to the women and why
[53:23] when you get into the way we should
[53:26] dress
[53:27] and the kind of shoes we need to wear
[53:29] it's not going to be a legalistic
[53:31] approach you're going to understand
[53:33] exactly why it is not appropriate for a
[53:35] woman to wear
[53:36] such a dress or for a woman to wear such
[53:40] shoes or for a man to wear such a paint
[53:43] and things like that amen
[53:45] if i just give it to you like brother
[53:46] brandon say don't do this don't do this
[53:48] don't do this so
[53:49] we go back again to the legalistic and
[53:51] then it's gonna be like why are you
[53:52] doing this it's because we are in a
[53:54] message
[53:57] not that way amen why are you doing this

[55:23] porter
[55:25] brothers verse 7 and the lord god for
[55:29] men of the dust of the ground i'm going
[55:32] back and forth because this scripture
[55:34] keeps
[55:34] popping up sister zadie
[55:38] it's not in there it's not a hazard you
[55:40] didn't know why
[55:41] you have to sing that song even able
[55:44] well someday you're going to begin to
[55:46] learn how the holy spirit to work
[55:48] and you will just begin to just relax

[55:57] i was looking for the third scripture
[55:58] the third scripture the third scripture
[56:00] and i got one and as soon as you sang
[56:02] that song
[56:02] the scripture came this is the scripture
[56:04] so i just pull it and change it on my
[56:06] slide right there
[56:07] so you don't know amen
[56:11] god will never give up on you
[56:18] amen he is able even if your back is to
[56:22] the wall brother about oh my god
[56:30] you see now now you understand okay
[56:35] get in contact with that man you will
[56:37] understand how he flows
[56:38] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[56:41] of the ground
[56:43] this dust is not the dust of eden
[56:46] you might be seated
[56:54] this is the earth this is eden
[56:59] remember and this
[57:02] is the garden of eden somehow
[57:05] on the east side everybody clear
[57:08] the north the south
[57:12] the east and there
[57:16] ever here no the north
[57:20] the south the west and there
[57:24] and there
[57:28] and the what eating on the east
[57:38] okay
[57:40] that's why you have to be on the east
[57:44] jesus
[57:51] hallelujah the garden of eden
[57:56] everybody cleared so far so god was
[57:58] somewhere here
[58:01] amen and he took the dust
[58:04] somewhere there and created adam spoke
[58:07] and adam pop-up
[58:10] everybody so far amen
[58:14] then and the lord god formed man of the
[58:17] dust of the ground
[58:19] and breathed into his nostril the breath
[58:21] of life
[58:22] and man became a living water and the
[58:25] lord god planted a garden eastward you
[58:29] see now
[58:30] you were the god that was made after man
[58:32] is already created
[58:34] it makes sense now so when they create
[58:36] man
[58:37] then the planted the garden
[58:40] we clear now then they took man and put
[58:43] him
[58:44] in the garden so
[58:47] man was not supposed to leave here
[58:51] what kelly he was not supposed to live
[58:54] on the other court
[58:59] make sense he was not supposed to live
[59:02] on the holy place
[59:05] anybody clear and he was supposed to
[59:08] live on the holy
[59:10] of the holiest anybody clear
[59:13] he was not supposed to live on the body
[59:19] he was not supposed to be led by his
[59:21] spirit
[59:24] anybody clear he was supposed to be led
[59:27] by his waters
[59:39] and he breathed the breath of life and
[59:41] man became a living water
[59:44] that's the first time the soul is
[59:45] mentioned in the scripture
[59:47] then they got to prepare a place for the
[59:49] soul anybody clear
[59:51] verse 8 and the lord god planted a
[59:54] garden eastward
[59:56] in eden and there he put man whom he had
[59:59] water
[1:00:00] you see where he put mans after he
[1:00:02] already created him
[1:00:04] clear jump to verse 16 and the lord god
[1:00:08] commanded the man
[1:00:09] saying of every tree of the garden you
[1:00:13] may freely
[1:00:14] eat but of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:00:17] good and evil
[1:00:18] you shall not eat of it for in the day
[1:00:21] that you eat thereof you shall surely
[1:00:23] water
[1:00:24] is that word complicated so the
[1:00:27] commandment that was given
[1:00:30] on the girl on eden that commandment was
[1:00:33] simple
[1:00:36] it was not complicated it was very easy
[1:00:39] this is the entire world you need to
[1:00:41] live with it
[1:00:42] do everything you want to do in eden
[1:00:44] just live by this
[1:00:45] that's it they didn't have to go through
[1:00:48] the seal through the trumpet
[1:00:50] through the val all of them very simple
[1:00:53] word
[1:00:54] so the spoken word of adam was a spoken
[1:00:58] word given in
[1:00:59] simplicity
[1:01:03] anybody clear so far job 2
[1:01:06] chapter 3 hallelujah
[1:01:10] you there that's a quite reading here
[1:01:15] now the serpent was more subtle now you
[1:01:18] know what saddle mean he knows your
[1:01:19] biology
[1:01:20] everything more than you do he knows
[1:01:22] biology very well
[1:01:24] so he knows the woman more than a woman
[1:01:27] i mean
[1:01:28] i mean herself he was the one teaching
[1:01:30] the woman
[1:01:31] everybody which the lord god has made
[1:01:35] and he said to the woman here has god
[1:01:39] say you shall not eat of every tree of
[1:01:42] the water
[1:01:43] number one he came bringing question
[1:01:48] against the spoken word of the hour
[1:01:53] everybody clear number one the therefore
[1:01:56] the way he brings you he attacks you
[1:01:59] when he attacks a church a woman he's
[1:02:02] going to bring
[1:02:02] question to the spoken word given by god
[1:02:06] through simplicity
[1:02:09] anybody clear so far so when somebody
[1:02:11] begin to
[1:02:12] question you about the message of the
[1:02:15] hour
[1:02:15] you need to raise your flag
[1:02:23] anybody clear brother brother
[1:02:27] even say a christian never ask a
[1:02:29] question to cause controversy
[1:02:32] if you need that scripture you see me
[1:02:34] that code brother branham says that amen
[1:02:37] amen you can ask a question what is the
[1:02:40] motive behind that question
[1:02:44] if you're trying to bring doubt to god
[1:02:47] original spoken word
[1:02:50] that is the devil anybody clear
[1:02:54] okay verse two and the lord and the
[1:02:57] woman
[1:02:58] said to the serpent if you notice here
[1:03:01] this serpent talk
[1:03:03] yes anybody here
[1:03:07] if you bring the elephant the elephant
[1:03:09] cannot communicate with a human
[1:03:12] amen everybody clear there is no bird
[1:03:15] that can communicate with humans
[1:03:19] here the parrot only repeat
[1:03:22] what human is saying without
[1:03:25] intelligence
[1:03:26] if you say to the parent how are you
[1:03:28] doing he said how are you doing
[1:03:30] are you okay are you okay it's
[1:03:32] echolastic it's just going
[1:03:34] back it's like you're bouncing against
[1:03:36] the wall but the
[1:03:38] only creature that was able
[1:03:41] to speak with men everybody clear
[1:03:44] and to reason with man and to give man
[1:03:47] an answer adequately was the serpent
[1:03:53] the snake does not talk
[1:03:56] everybody here that ability was removed
[1:04:00] in the garden of eden when god changed
[1:04:03] the form of it
[1:04:06] anybody clear and the woman said to the
[1:04:08] serpent we may eat of the tree of hell
[1:04:11] of the gardens
[1:04:12] but of the tree which is maybe in the
[1:04:14] midst of the garden
[1:04:16] god has said you shall not eat of it
[1:04:18] neither you shall not eat of it
[1:04:20] neither shall you touch it unless you
[1:04:22] water
[1:04:24] and the serpent said to the woman you
[1:04:26] shall not
[1:04:27] surely water the second thing
[1:04:30] the devil attack is to deny god spoken
[1:04:34] word of the hour
[1:04:36] number one is to bring you question
[1:04:39] when you begin to discuss with him in a
[1:04:41] question
[1:04:42] then he's going to tell you that it is
[1:04:44] not that
[1:04:48] if you miss the second the first
[1:04:50] approach once you get to the second one
[1:04:52] you need to wake up
[1:04:55] anybody clear for god
[1:04:58] does know the third thing once he denies
[1:05:02] to you
[1:05:03] the spoken word of god number three he's
[1:05:06] gonna open
[1:05:07] his own gospel

[1:05:37] eyes shall be opened
[1:05:38] and you shall be as god knowing good and
[1:05:41] what
[1:05:42] so in other words adam and eve did not
[1:05:45] know
[1:05:46] what was good and evil
[1:05:51] anybody clear good and evil was there
[1:05:53] but they didn't know
[1:05:56] job two verse uh

[1:06:52] that vocabulary
[1:06:54] happened to come out in the mouth of
[1:06:56] adam
[1:06:58] adam never uses that vocabulary before
[1:07:02] but the teaching of the serpent through
[1:07:05] the woman
[1:07:06] brought a new vocabulary through the son
[1:07:09] of god
[1:07:10] anybody clear because adam was the son
[1:07:12] of god
[1:07:14] and he said who told you that you were
[1:07:17] naked in other words that vocabulary
[1:07:19] is connected to one thing who told you
[1:07:22] that you were naked
[1:07:24] have you eaten of the tree whereof i
[1:07:26] commanded you that you should not eat
[1:07:30] watch very carefully and the men say
[1:07:34] the woman whom you gave to be with me
[1:07:38] she did water in other words i didn't
[1:07:41] know
[1:07:42] anything about this i was blind
[1:07:45] the one who opened my eyes and who
[1:07:48] taught me
[1:07:49] what to do is the one that you gave it
[1:07:52] to me
[1:07:53] anybody clear keep chasing and the lord
[1:07:56] god said to the woman
[1:07:58] what is this that you have water
[1:08:01] so the woman did something
[1:08:05] here what is this that you have done
[1:08:09] and the woman said the serpent did water
[1:08:15] brother branham says this
[1:08:20] he says that the serpent begot me
[1:08:24] do you know what big girls mean it means
[1:08:28] water

[1:08:55] friendship between the serpent and the
[1:08:57] woman
[1:09:00] you cannot put enmity where there was no
[1:09:04] friendship
[1:09:07] amen we okay now there was friendship
[1:09:11] before between the woman and the serpent
[1:09:14] no wonder he would
[1:09:15] call himself and come here sit down here
[1:09:18] there were
[1:09:19] close bodies
[1:09:24] [Laughter]
[1:09:27] hallelujah and i will put enmity between
[1:09:30] you and the water
[1:09:32] woman and between your seed and her
[1:09:36] seed the serpent seed it's right in the
[1:09:38] bible
[1:09:40] it shall bruise your head and you shall
[1:09:43] bruise his water
[1:09:45] jump to verse 17. and adam he said
[1:09:49] because you have
[1:09:49] hearkened to water remember there is a
[1:09:52] voice of evil
[1:09:54] the voice of the woman and have eaten of
[1:09:56] the tree of which i command you saying
[1:09:58] you shall not eat
[1:10:00] curses the ground for your sake in
[1:10:02] sorrow
[1:10:03] shall you eat of it all the days of your
[1:10:07] life job to verse 22
[1:10:10] and the lord god say behold the
[1:10:13] man is become as one of us to know
[1:10:17] good and evil and now lest he put forth
[1:10:20] his hand
[1:10:21] and take also of the tree of water
[1:10:24] god never taught them not to eat of the
[1:10:27] tree of life
[1:10:29] so the tree of life has been there all
[1:10:31] this time
[1:10:32] they never were interested to eat that
[1:10:34] tree
[1:10:39] only the forbidden one

[1:10:47] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:10:50] eat
[1:10:51] everybody clear and live forever
[1:10:54] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:10:59] from the water the garden of eden
[1:11:04] to till the water from where he was
[1:11:08] water
[1:11:09] not to till the ground of eden
[1:11:15] are you clear god took man and put him
[1:11:18] in the garden of eden and told him to
[1:11:22] till
[1:11:23] the ground of eden the grand of eden had
[1:11:28] no sorrow
[1:11:31] it was not painful he was
[1:11:34] a leisure of label but the ground that
[1:11:38] was
[1:11:38] outside of eden was a different
[1:11:42] ground
[1:11:45] anybody clear now let me go back again
[1:11:48] therefore the lord
[1:11:49] sent him forth from the god and in other
[1:11:52] words
[1:11:52] get out from this place now go
[1:11:56] into water into eden
[1:11:59] eden which represent the holy place
[1:12:03] all which represent the water the spirit
[1:12:06] which is the
[1:12:07] intelligence the intelligence
[1:12:11] or the understanding anybody clear
[1:12:15] in other words because you bite on the
[1:12:18] wrong tree
[1:12:19] you're gonna be leaning upon your own
[1:12:23] and when you lean upon your own
[1:12:25] understanding
[1:12:26] you're going to be suffering
[1:12:30] are you are you are you with me remove
[1:12:33] you're not going to be living in your
[1:12:35] soul anymore
[1:12:36] you're going to be depending on your
[1:12:38] spirit
[1:12:39] you're going to be depending on your
[1:12:41] intelligence
[1:12:42] you're going to be depending on your
[1:12:44] understanding
[1:12:45] and when you depend on your
[1:12:47] understanding you're going to have
[1:12:48] headaches are you there
[1:12:52] that's why when solomon came solomon
[1:12:55] said
[1:12:55] lean not unto their own water in other
[1:12:59] words go
[1:12:59] back again to live with the heart
[1:13:02] in your understanding you're gonna work
[1:13:05] all night like
[1:13:06] peter and you will catch nothing
[1:13:10] everybody clear but when you go back to
[1:13:13] the world

[1:13:22] net won't
[1:13:23] feel and they don't know even how to
[1:13:25] retrieve it
[1:13:26] the labor is easy
[1:13:31] it doesn't depend on your effort anymore
[1:13:34] it is god telling you god do such and
[1:13:38] such
[1:13:38] business and when you do the business
[1:13:41] you are automatically
[1:13:42] blessed because it is not your
[1:13:46] intelligence
[1:13:47] that sends you to the business but it is
[1:13:50] god who sends you to that business
[1:13:53] that's why the business work
[1:13:58] if something happened to that business
[1:14:00] you go back to god
[1:14:02] you don't have to even suffer you don't
[1:14:05] have to try to figure it out
[1:14:07] you say you the one that gives me the
[1:14:09] business
[1:14:10] take this mountain away from my business
[1:14:19] hallelujah you don't want to work in
[1:14:22] eden
[1:14:22] you want to work in the garden of eden
[1:14:31] hallelujah therefore the lord god sent
[1:14:35] him forth
[1:14:36] from the garden of eden to till the
[1:14:39] ground
[1:14:40] from where he was water now you can see
[1:14:43] he was not taken from eden
[1:14:45] he was taken outside of eden
[1:14:48] clear now verse 24
[1:14:51] and so so i'm sorry he drove out to the
[1:14:55] men
[1:14:56] and he placed at the water
[1:14:59] east of the garden of water right there
[1:15:04] caribbeans remember the caribbeans were
[1:15:07] in the holy of the holy
[1:15:11] you understand now carribeans and a
[1:15:14] flaming sword

[1:15:18] water
[1:15:20] the way to water in the hebrew
[1:15:24] non-process
[1:15:25] that but into the second
[1:15:28] went the high priest alone
[1:15:32] in the holy of holies once every year
[1:15:36] not without blood because it's a flaming
[1:15:38] sword
[1:15:39] judgment is turning around there
[1:15:42] which he offered for himself and for the
[1:15:45] error of the people
[1:15:47] the holy ghost this signifying
[1:15:51] signifying that the way into the water
[1:15:54] of all yes was not yet made water
[1:15:58] you see now because it was blocked
[1:16:01] that's why when jesus
[1:16:02] died at the cross veil
[1:16:06] of the temple was ripped in the middle
[1:16:10] telling you now you can come back to
[1:16:12] eden

[1:16:17] christ is
[1:16:17] offered one time for all and he make a
[1:16:21] way

[1:25:55] because he said go back to eden look
[1:25:59] what happened to eden
[1:26:02] look what the serpent did how he began
[1:26:05] eve how did he be garlic by bringing
[1:26:09] question to the spoken word
[1:26:11] by denying the spoken word then he's
[1:26:14] gonna bring his
[1:26:15] own gospel now paul is telling you
[1:26:18] he's bringing another
[1:26:23] you see now for if he
[1:26:26] that comes preaches that serpent
[1:26:29] another who whom we have not
[1:26:33] worked so there was an original gospel
[1:26:37] that was already preached
[1:26:38] but this is a second gospel another
[1:26:42] gospel which we have not preached
[1:26:44] watch or if you receive another water
[1:26:49] god spill goes with spirit because the
[1:26:53] spirit and the world are water
[1:26:56] so when you receive a different gospel
[1:26:59] you're gonna be anointed with a demonic
[1:27:01] spirit
[1:27:02] that goes with the gospel
[1:27:07] are you there which you have not
[1:27:09] received
[1:27:10] or another gospel which you have not
[1:27:13] accepted
[1:27:14] you might well bear with who
[1:27:19] jump to verse 13 for
[1:27:22] such a who
[1:27:25] deceitful worker transforming themselves
[1:27:29] into the apostle of water
[1:27:32] to seduce about here and
[1:27:35] no mother for satan himself
[1:27:40] you see now trump is transformed
[1:27:44] into an angel of water
[1:27:48] therefore it is no great things
[1:27:51] if his minister also so he also had
[1:27:54] preachers
[1:27:55] be transformed as the minister of water
[1:28:00] whose end shall be according to the
[1:28:02] earth
[1:28:03] let's go to ephesians then we pray
[1:28:07] hallelujah ephesians chapter 5
[1:28:12] amen these are channels we open so when
[1:28:16] you go throughout the week the holy
[1:28:18] spirit keeps talking to you
[1:28:20] keep bringing stuff up amen before you
[1:28:22] know it it's friday
[1:28:24] but your mind is filled with revelation
[1:28:26] and river you know i was reading in the
[1:28:28] scripture i never saw this before now
[1:28:29] you begin to get into good grounds
[1:28:32] amen ephesians 5
[1:28:35] 25 husband loves your wife
[1:28:39] even our christ also love the church and
[1:28:41] gave himself for it
[1:28:43] that he might do water and clean said
[1:28:48] if you want to sanctify something
[1:28:53] you cannot sanctify something that is
[1:28:55] already holy
[1:28:57] so something fair fallen
[1:29:01] back here something must be dirty for
[1:29:04] you to clean it
[1:29:05] make sense that he must sanctify and
[1:29:09] cleanse it
[1:29:10] so he was dirty with the washing of the
[1:29:13] water by the
[1:29:15] word that he might present it to himself
[1:29:18] not to somebody else
[1:29:20] anybody clear so that weakness that
[1:29:24] you found you clean it up
[1:29:27] for yourself
[1:29:30] amen not having spot
[1:29:34] or water so
[1:29:38] this bride had weak spot
[1:29:43] and head wrinkle now when christ
[1:29:47] comes he's gonna remove that weakness
[1:29:50] out make sense now
[1:29:55] because if she was perfect what are you
[1:29:57] going to correct
[1:29:58] so something was wrong so when
[1:30:01] redemption comes
[1:30:02] he's going to correct forever that which
[1:30:06] was wrong
[1:30:08] hallelujah with that spot
[1:30:11] or wrinkle we already explained you this
[1:30:14] one is the change of the body
[1:30:15] and the spirit glorified or any such
[1:30:18] thing
[1:30:19] but that it shall be holy and without
[1:30:22] water
[1:30:23] so ought men to love the wives as their
[1:30:26] own
[1:30:27] body he that loves his wife love himself
[1:30:30] everybody clear
[1:30:32] now let's pray heavenly father lord we
[1:30:35] thank you again for this afternoon for
[1:30:36] your grace your love your mercy
[1:30:38] and giving us another opportunity
[1:30:41] regardless of the schedule
[1:30:43] that we can gather together around the
[1:30:45] reveal world of the hour
[1:30:47] lord may you move me completely out of
[1:30:49] the way and my old father may you come
[1:30:51] and minister unto us
[1:30:53] speak to our soul touch our body father
[1:30:56] respond to our need lord father
[1:30:58] may everything else be sealed completely
[1:31:00] out of this place
[1:31:02] may only the holy spirit and the angel
[1:31:04] of the lord
[1:31:05] be lord welcome in this place to bless
[1:31:08] and fill your children
[1:31:09] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:31:13] god bless you let's go it's on part 40
[1:31:19] we were dealing with adam
[1:31:22] and eve and the creation of the woman
[1:31:25] or the creation of eve last week
[1:31:29] the first point that we we saw was that
[1:31:32] the woman
[1:31:34] was the man door that the devil uses
[1:31:37] anybody clear to number one to carry his
[1:31:41] seed
[1:31:42] you remember he used eve to carry his
[1:31:45] seed
[1:31:46] and when god was about to destroy the
[1:31:48] entire world by water
[1:31:50] the devil took his seed and planted in
[1:31:53] the woman
[1:31:54] and the wife of him carried that seed
[1:31:56] over
[1:31:57] and reproduce the serpentine everybody
[1:32:00] clear
[1:32:00] so it's the main door that the devil
[1:32:03] uses to carry the seed
[1:32:05] and also to propagate his gospel
[1:32:09] hey but here the second main point that
[1:32:12] we found last week was
[1:32:14] that the woman was created by god
[1:32:18] and not by the devil everybody cares so
[1:32:20] far
[1:32:21] brother branham says this again in
[1:32:23] perseverance
[1:32:25] he says and such a conception my
[1:32:28] eve looked like some kind of pre
[1:32:31] prehistoric
[1:32:32] animal so somebody painted that let me
[1:32:34] go back i was in rome
[1:32:37] and i was done in and looking at where
[1:32:40] a greek artist has painted the
[1:32:42] conception of adam and eve
[1:32:44] in the garden of eden and such a
[1:32:47] conception
[1:32:48] my eve look like a kind of prehistoric
[1:32:52] animal and adam had never seen
[1:32:56] such a thing in my life in other words
[1:32:58] it looks horrible
[1:32:59] it just goes to show what the
[1:33:02] carnal mind can draw up
[1:33:06] when it's not converted to the glory of
[1:33:09] god in other words they cannot catch the
[1:33:10] man of god
[1:33:12] i believe eve was the water
[1:33:16] the prettiest woman that ever lived
[1:33:19] on the earth that's right
[1:33:23] because she was water
[1:33:26] freshly made by the hands of who
[1:33:30] by the hands of god without
[1:33:33] any water to do what
[1:33:36] sin originated in heaven
[1:33:40] so sin was already with the devil
[1:33:43] when the devil came in the garden of
[1:33:46] eden
[1:33:47] he was already a sinful devil
[1:33:50] but brother branham is telling you that
[1:33:52] the one who created
[1:33:54] eve was god without sin in other words
[1:33:58] without an intervention of the devil
[1:34:02] a woman was created by god
[1:34:07] ever clear made by the hands of god
[1:34:11] without
[1:34:11] any sin to touch adam the most
[1:34:14] perfect man that could ever live outside
[1:34:18] of who
[1:34:19] because he was the second water the most
[1:34:23] perfect
[1:34:24] man in other words a woman was created
[1:34:27] by
[1:34:27] god but they designed that brother
[1:34:31] branham spoke
[1:34:32] was the design not by creation
[1:34:36] by the design by water by perversion
[1:34:39] everybody cleared so far
[1:34:41] that was the main second point that we
[1:34:43] seen the third one that we seen
[1:34:46] was that when god created this woman
[1:34:49] god loaded this woman with three
[1:34:52] sacred virtues anybody clear
[1:34:56] the first one is virginity the second
[1:35:00] one is womanhood the third one
[1:35:03] is motherhood everybody clear and when
[1:35:06] the devil
[1:35:07] defiles eve the devil in one shot
[1:35:11] destroyed all three everybody
[1:35:15] he destroyed the virginity of evil he
[1:35:18] polluted the womb of
[1:35:19] evil but in order to destroy
[1:35:23] virginity and motherhood
[1:35:26] the first thing that they therefore work
[1:35:29] on
[1:35:30] is womanhood anybody clear
[1:35:34] womanhood is the behavior of a woman
[1:35:39] ever clear womanhood is the outer
[1:35:42] appearance of a woman anybody clear
[1:35:48] everybody clear the devil have to work
[1:35:52] on your behavior first
[1:35:54] the devil have to work on your clothing
[1:35:58] the weather i mean the devil have to
[1:36:01] work on your life
[1:36:02] first everybody
[1:36:05] when he gets you there then
[1:36:08] you're going to find yourself in the
[1:36:10] hotel
[1:36:12] ever here in the hotel it is no more to
[1:36:16] work on your clothing
[1:36:18] that is to destroy your virginity
[1:36:21] and then later on you're going to go in
[1:36:24] social service because you are a single
[1:36:26] mother
[1:36:27] amen amen here
[1:36:30] ever clear now the first point we want
[1:36:34] to introduce today
[1:36:36] is that through this relationship
[1:36:40] between eve and the devil this
[1:36:43] relationship
[1:36:44] introduced and hybridization
[1:36:49] of animal sexual driver
[1:36:56] anybody here when god created
[1:36:59] every species every species have to
[1:37:02] reproduce
[1:37:03] according to their category ever clear
[1:37:07] and the highest category was men
[1:37:10] so the way men had to reproduce was
[1:37:14] different than animals everybody here
[1:37:17] the animal could not mingle with the
[1:37:20] bird
[1:37:21] ever clear the bird could not mingle
[1:37:24] with the fishes
[1:37:26] ever clear and the fishes could not
[1:37:29] mingle with human beings
[1:37:32] but the relationship between the serpent
[1:37:35] and the and eve brought the animal
[1:37:38] sex drive into the human
[1:37:42] race now human begin to have feelings
[1:37:46] that animals were supposed to fear
[1:37:55] hallelujah leviticus
[1:37:59] chapter 18 verse 23
[1:38:02] neither shall that lie with any water
[1:38:07] why do you attack brother branham on the
[1:38:09] serpent sea
[1:38:13] where did it start
[1:38:16] neither shall they lie with any beast to
[1:38:20] do what
[1:38:22] remember the suffering began me to defer
[1:38:25] their self there with neither shall
[1:38:28] any water stand before
[1:38:31] a beast to lie down therein
[1:38:35] there too it is a water it is a
[1:38:38] confusion
[1:38:40] where did moses learn this
[1:38:46] where was that door open because animal
[1:38:49] supposed to stay with animals
[1:38:51] fishes stay with fishes bird stay with
[1:38:54] bird
[1:38:54] human stay with women who opened the
[1:38:57] door between
[1:38:58] the beast and the woman
[1:39:01] and the human being leviticus 20
[1:39:05] verse 15 and if a man lie
[1:39:09] with a beast an introduction of
[1:39:12] a animal sexualized into humanity
[1:39:18] if any man lie with a beast he shall
[1:39:22] surely be put to death
[1:39:24] and he shall slay the beast and if any
[1:39:27] woman
[1:39:28] approaches unto any beast and lie
[1:39:31] down there too that shall kill the woman
[1:39:35] and the water
[1:39:38] what savvy if was adam that was safe
[1:39:42] sarah for lying before god
[1:39:45] deuteronomy 27 verse 21
[1:39:48] curse be he that lie with any manner of
[1:39:52] water
[1:39:53] and all the people shall say water
[1:39:57] in other words when man when god stopped
[1:40:02] took the serpent and destroyed the
[1:40:05] serpent completely
[1:40:06] he was a man he was an animal that could
[1:40:09] talk
[1:40:11] he was an animal that can reason with
[1:40:13] man he was an animal that can sit down
[1:40:15] with you
[1:40:16] and you can talk to him about politics
[1:40:19] you cannot talk to the elephant
[1:40:21] you cannot talk to the lion you cannot
[1:40:23] talk to the tiger
[1:40:24] but you can communicate with the serpent
[1:40:27] because that was the
[1:40:28] link between the two species
[1:40:32] so god took that animal and
[1:40:35] it completely you follow me
[1:40:38] and brought that animal into a snake
[1:40:42] but it was too late the feelings
[1:40:46] that the serpent gave to even
[1:40:50] if transfer those feelings to adam
[1:40:54] and even though god closed the door
[1:40:57] the human beings continued to do the
[1:41:00] same thing
[1:41:01] that's why when god spoke to moses he
[1:41:04] said tell them
[1:41:05] i don't want those kind of behavior
[1:41:07] where did it start because at the
[1:41:09] beginning
[1:41:10] it was not there the human the animal
[1:41:14] sex lust was introduced into the human
[1:41:17] being everybody clear so far
[1:41:19] brother branham hallelujah
[1:41:23] their unconscious thoughts
[1:41:27] keep them staring at snakes that lure
[1:41:33] of snakes is unconsciously water
[1:41:37] if you look even at the way the snake is
[1:41:39] moving
[1:41:42] something is wrong automatically
[1:41:45] there is like a natural repulsion with
[1:41:48] the snake
[1:41:50] if you love snake i need to sit down
[1:41:52] with you
[1:41:54] everybody here that he has been through
[1:41:58] the edges
[1:41:59] is seen by the people in generation
[1:42:03] after generation going through the same
[1:42:06] thing
[1:42:08] snakes have always been
[1:42:12] and always won't be water repulsively
[1:42:16] water
[1:42:17] it looks beautiful but yet you don't
[1:42:20] want to get around it
[1:42:24] everybody the snake
[1:42:27] has always stood for that which is water
[1:42:32] and water it can bite you
[1:42:35] ever clear it has been a water
[1:42:41] you know what it means i'll let you
[1:42:43] google that
[1:42:45] are you there it has been a
[1:42:48] phallic symbol through the water
[1:42:54] let me try to maneuver here pretty good
[1:42:57] the snake was a beast
[1:43:01] not a reptile the serpent he was a beast
[1:43:05] he was a beast that could talk he was a
[1:43:08] beast that could communicate with humans
[1:43:10] ever clear when god destroyed the snake
[1:43:15] god destroyed the snake with two things
[1:43:19] are you following me number one god
[1:43:22] destroyed the snake so that science
[1:43:25] could never
[1:43:27] find the missing link between
[1:43:30] the human and the animal that's why they
[1:43:33] took the chimpanzee
[1:43:35] they teach him in school he's still dumb
[1:43:37] as a monkey
[1:43:39] they took the dog they teach everything
[1:43:42] nobody
[1:43:43] but where is the species that is between
[1:43:46] the human
[1:43:47] and between the animal the closest one
[1:43:49] that was the chimpanzee
[1:43:50] what one of them said they found out big
[1:43:52] bones in africa and things like that
[1:43:55] and they keep looking at the bone but
[1:43:56] where is the species they can't find him
[1:43:59] ever here
[1:44:00] god destroy it number one so that
[1:44:03] science cannot find it
[1:44:07] because science comes from the tree of
[1:44:09] the knowledge of good and evil
[1:44:12] number two the way god destroyed
[1:44:16] the serpent ever clear
[1:44:19] he destroyed him and
[1:44:22] gave him a form
[1:44:27] you okay gave the serpent
[1:44:30] a form that looked like
[1:44:34] the very thing that he did
[1:44:42] are you catching me are you reading
[1:44:45] between the line
[1:44:47] that's what brother branham said it was
[1:44:50] a
[1:44:50] symbol a phallic symbol
[1:44:53] are you there a phallic symbol is
[1:44:56] that the serpent has the form
[1:45:00] of the very thing that introduces
[1:45:03] sin in the human life
[1:45:08] are you following me and not only that
[1:45:11] the male jesus
[1:45:15] look like the serpent
[1:45:21] are we getting better are you getting
[1:45:24] that in other words
[1:45:25] if you have questions on the edges
[1:45:29] look at him look at his thumb
[1:45:33] look at the way he is that is what
[1:45:36] causes the
[1:45:37] fall in eden the very form of a snake
[1:45:42] testify of the serpent seed doctrine
[1:45:50] if you didn't catch it you see me
[1:45:53] are you there it has been a phallic
[1:45:57] symbol
[1:45:58] through the edges just exactly as the
[1:46:01] guardian of hidden description
[1:46:03] we find the serpent
[1:46:06] the personification of a passionate
[1:46:09] evil it is almost universal
[1:46:13] amongst the various uncultured tribes
[1:46:16] that the snake
[1:46:17] is associated with water and often
[1:46:21] worship
[1:46:21] in conjunction with it the study of
[1:46:25] sexology
[1:46:27] brings that out in many instances
[1:46:31] now i would like to know where these
[1:46:33] people got that from
[1:46:36] seeing they are uneducated
[1:46:39] and never read the bible but even as the
[1:46:43] story
[1:46:43] of the flood is known throughout the
[1:46:46] world
[1:46:47] so is this truth of the fall of men do
[1:46:51] whatever
[1:46:52] they knew what happened there in water
[1:46:55] because remember the entire world lived
[1:46:59] to live in one place
[1:47:00] they already knew everything that
[1:47:03] happened in eden
[1:47:04] but through the babylonian empire of
[1:47:08] nimrod god brought the tower of babel
[1:47:10] down
[1:47:11] and separated them by language but not
[1:47:15] by
[1:47:15] knowledge
[1:47:19] are you with me the knowledge remain
[1:47:22] universal
[1:47:23] the language changes so they went
[1:47:27] too many different places carrying the
[1:47:30] same knowledge
[1:47:31] but under a different language that's
[1:47:35] why you see the deity of the egyptian
[1:47:38] matching the roman matching the greek
[1:47:40] because that knowledge was going
[1:47:42] throughout
[1:47:43] all even in asia they knew what happened
[1:47:47] but the confusion came by language
[1:47:50] and that confusion is restored in the
[1:47:53] day of pentecost
[1:47:55] where the holy ghost came down if you
[1:47:58] speak hebrew
[1:48:00] somebody is understanding you in his own
[1:48:03] language
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:09] glory to god everybody created so far
[1:48:14] brother branham says this i could prove
[1:48:17] by the bible that you are not in your
[1:48:20] right mind
[1:48:21] till you have found christ
[1:48:25] that's right that is pretty strong
[1:48:28] but i can prove that by the water
[1:48:31] did he give you the scripture
[1:48:35] go home and study that's right
[1:48:39] you become water and whatever
[1:48:43] and what you become beastly
[1:48:46] lustfully and everything until you find
[1:48:49] who why because the animal
[1:48:53] sex draft was introducing human you're
[1:48:56] going to behave like an
[1:48:57] animal that's why you'd have been in a
[1:49:00] nightclub
[1:49:02] sometimes you look at what you did you
[1:49:04] are even ashamed to tell somebody
[1:49:06] because you are reacting like an animal
[1:49:10] are you there how can a woman go to bed
[1:49:12] with three mans
[1:49:14] how can one man go to bed with ten women
[1:49:17] it's animal
[1:49:20] yet they do it
[1:49:25] hallelujah and you take the holy spirit
[1:49:29] off of a man
[1:49:30] he is water lower than what
[1:49:34] he is even worse than the animal
[1:49:38] why is he washed because the animal
[1:49:41] never sinned
[1:49:43] either the animal remain under
[1:49:46] the leadership of god god leads the
[1:49:49] animal
[1:49:50] by emotion and instinct that's why when
[1:49:53] the earthquake
[1:49:54] comes the beast don't die they run away
[1:49:58] and
[1:49:58] man is the one that died
[1:50:02] are you there so when man stoop down
[1:50:05] he goes below the animal
[1:50:12] hallelujah that is a hard thing to say
[1:50:15] but you take a man that is unregenerated
[1:50:19] in his mind
[1:50:20] without the holy spirit brother kelly to
[1:50:23] direct his thought
[1:50:25] and things like that he would throw a
[1:50:28] baby out of a mother's
[1:50:30] arm and ravish her for water
[1:50:34] he won't even remember that this is a
[1:50:36] mother with a children he would just
[1:50:38] rape him
[1:50:39] yeah rapper why is he that
[1:50:42] because the animal draft was
[1:50:45] introduced into a human it caused
[1:50:48] perversion
[1:50:49] everybody cleared so far the fourth
[1:50:52] point we're going to get into it
[1:50:53] [Applause]

[1:51:00] that the woman number five
[1:51:03] i'm gonna stop at seven if i can
[1:51:07] the woman was a by-product
[1:51:12] and that byproduct when we explained to
[1:51:15] you
[1:51:15] she was a weaker water
[1:51:19] because she was a product of the product
[1:51:22] amen the original were strong when they
[1:51:26] took the original
[1:51:27] and work it up again it becomes weak
[1:51:30] everybody follow me

[1:51:47] when you get to
[1:51:49] as you work on the working product you
[1:51:52] are decreasing lowering the product
[1:51:56] anybody clear body problem
[1:52:01] not is but a byproduct and not
[1:52:04] is the only one of our god's creation of
[1:52:07] every animal
[1:52:08] anything else he was the only one
[1:52:10] designed this way
[1:52:12] not created this way anybody clear every
[1:52:16] other female
[1:52:17] was in the original water this creation
[1:52:20] brother branham is talking
[1:52:22] is in genesis 2. not genesis 1 genesis 1
[1:52:27] man was created male and female
[1:52:30] in the image of god which is spirit
[1:52:33] but in genesis 2 it was the human body
[1:52:37] that's what brother branham is talking
[1:52:38] about people don't study and they make
[1:52:41] brother branham say things he didn't say
[1:52:44] are you there every other female was in
[1:52:48] the original creation
[1:52:50] but if was not in the original creation
[1:52:53] see that he had to be made that way
[1:52:57] well we get it we get to it after a
[1:52:59] while
[1:53:00] notice in this creation that she was in
[1:53:03] not in the original but a water
[1:53:07] okay there is nothing designed
[1:53:10] to be so what
[1:53:13] as a worker
[1:53:18] ah thank you the brother in the message
[1:53:21] will stop at the woman
[1:53:25] there is nothing designed to be so
[1:53:28] deceitful
[1:53:29] as a woman say amen that is not what
[1:53:33] brother branham said
[1:53:36] because the woman was created by god
[1:53:40] you need to read the prophet carefully
[1:53:45] not just put a tape to go to sleep you
[1:53:48] are asleep
[1:53:49] you are sleepy turn the tape off sleep

[1:54:32] you fast and you hungry do what
[1:54:37] i cannot eat i cannot eat that steak
[1:54:39] looks so good you're not fasting anymore
[1:54:41] you fall
[1:54:42] you are killing yourself god god is
[1:54:45] simple
[1:54:49] be not like the pharisee who thinks
[1:54:52] by the multiplication of the word
[1:54:56] and the long prayer i'm gonna heal them
[1:55:03] go back to the garden of eden
[1:55:08] amen go back to the garden of eden
[1:55:12] you wake up in the morning you fresh put
[1:55:14] the tape
[1:55:19] hallelujah there is nothing designed
[1:55:23] to be so deceitful as a what
[1:55:26] a woman that is water a woman
[1:55:29] that is deceitful not a woman
[1:55:36] there cannot be nothing else there is
[1:55:39] nothing meant to be that way
[1:55:42] there is nothing that can be so easily
[1:55:45] deceived
[1:55:46] as a water because it was
[1:55:49] deceived easily now the fall
[1:55:52] proved this statement to be true the
[1:55:55] fall
[1:55:56] is before in the beginning she was not
[1:55:59] in the original beginning creation
[1:56:01] she was in what but not in there
[1:56:05] you see her brother branham is clear
[1:56:08] nothing
[1:56:09] in other words not in a woman body are
[1:56:11] you there
[1:56:12] herself at the beginning she was the
[1:56:15] by product doing what made
[1:56:19] where are you going body stephen
[1:56:21] hallelujah
[1:56:22] now you may ask me now
[1:56:26] why did he permit her to be designed
[1:56:30] thus anybody follow me
[1:56:34] in other words why is god
[1:56:37] instead of creating a woman directly
[1:56:40] why did he took a product and make
[1:56:43] another
[1:56:44] product we're clear
[1:56:48] we're on point five point five
[1:56:51] a brother branham
[1:56:55] i don't want to take too much time
[1:56:58] because i got a lot more to say here
[1:57:00] why the question may arise then why did
[1:57:04] god
[1:57:04] make this woman like this in other words
[1:57:06] a byproduct
[1:57:08] why did he permit her to be like that
[1:57:11] he was for his own water good and water
[1:57:17] this weakness was for god's
[1:57:21] own water
[1:57:25] relax everybody clear so far
[1:57:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:57:33] number two so he had to put man out
[1:57:37] there
[1:57:38] and make him on a free moral agency so
[1:57:40] he would knowing
[1:57:42] would fall and the man in his own image
[1:57:45] how could he fall now you're seeing
[1:57:47] daylight
[1:57:48] so he had to make a water a by-product
[1:57:52] something out of the water
[1:57:55] the river creation now you see it
[1:57:59] back here there you come then that is
[1:58:02] what fell
[1:58:03] what fell was not adam it was if that
[1:58:06] fell
[1:58:07] he made it knowing it would do water
[1:58:11] and it's put over in the hands of who
[1:58:16] for a while of water
[1:58:21] the woman was not a vessel
[1:58:24] of dishonor
[1:58:28] because she was created by god she was
[1:58:31] the perfect woman
[1:58:32] of the entire world she was god's own
[1:58:36] perfect thoughts of beauty everybody
[1:58:38] here
[1:58:40] that's but what brother branham is
[1:58:41] saying here
[1:58:43] that the devil treated the eve
[1:58:46] as a worker
[1:58:52] are we clear now are we clear now
[1:58:55] number b a vessel of water
[1:59:01] everybody here god
[1:59:04] did not created hell to be treated that
[1:59:06] way
[1:59:08] are you following me are you following
[1:59:10] me
[1:59:11] but when the devil came down in the
[1:59:13] garden of eden
[1:59:15] he looked at the lion man beautiful
[1:59:19] he looked at the female not beautiful
[1:59:22] he looked at the giraffe he looks at the
[1:59:25] male
[1:59:25] beautiful pretty you look at the woman
[1:59:28] not pretty
[1:59:29] everything the man prayed woman not
[1:59:31] prayed
[1:59:32] the man prayed it woman not prayed when
[1:59:34] he looked at the human
[1:59:36] he found adam not pretty
[1:59:39] but if beautiful he said why is this one
[1:59:44] different than any other creature
[1:59:49] you follow me now you follow me now
[1:59:52] this is the different one of all the
[1:59:55] species
[1:59:56] in eden everybody i look at the lion you
[1:59:59] can see the
[2:00:00] man lion he look royal you look at the
[2:00:02] woman nothing
[2:00:03] if you look at oh the bird you see the
[2:00:06] male is the one
[2:00:07] beautiful the female not but in the
[2:00:09] human it looks like something is
[2:00:12] opposite why is he opposite
[2:00:15] this is a door for me to begin to work
[2:00:19] you understand brother stephen
[2:00:22] where are we going hallelujah
[2:00:26] romans 9 verse 19
[2:00:29] thou will say then unto me
[2:00:32] why did he find fault
[2:00:36] for who has resisted his what in other
[2:00:39] words why is god condemning them
[2:00:42] because if we are made what we are by
[2:00:45] the will of god
[2:00:46] who can resist the will of god i have to
[2:00:49] be what god wants me to be
[2:00:50] so if god made me what he want me to be
[2:00:53] why is he condemning his name
[2:00:57] that's what paul is saying nay
[2:01:00] but all men who are there
[2:01:03] that replies against who shall they
[2:01:06] think
[2:01:07] form are you following me
[2:01:11] say to him that from him
[2:01:14] why has that made me death
[2:01:19] in other words i'm the boss i do what i
[2:01:22] want to do
[2:01:23] and i'm doing things for my own
[2:01:26] are we okay i'm now i gave you brother
[2:01:29] branham i am granting you back in the
[2:01:31] scripture
[2:01:34] okay okay
[2:01:37] have not the who
[2:01:40] the power they have what you remember
[2:01:42] the woman have to wear
[2:01:44] hair for what power have not power over
[2:01:48] the water
[2:01:49] over the clay of the same lamp
[2:01:53] he makes one a vessel onto water
[2:01:57] and another unto what everybody cares so
[2:02:01] far
[2:02:01] now i'm going back to the scripture what
[2:02:04] if god
[2:02:07] willing to show his wrath
[2:02:10] and make his power known endure with
[2:02:14] much suffering the vessel of water
[2:02:17] so when god makes a vessel he have a
[2:02:20] purpose
[2:02:22] if he makes a vessel of wrath
[2:02:26] you follow me it is for god to destroy
[2:02:29] that vest so powerfully so that
[2:02:32] when you see that you say oh
[2:02:36] he's a god that can revenge my enemy
[2:02:40] do you understand that
[2:02:44] do you understand that he has a power
[2:02:47] to destroy your enemy you don't know
[2:02:50] that
[2:02:51] so to help you understand that he's
[2:02:54] creating certain individual
[2:02:57] to demonstrate his power so you can
[2:03:00] learn
[2:03:01] what he is to you
[2:03:05] are we okay let me navigate again
[2:03:11] what endure with much suffering the
[2:03:14] vessel of rough
[2:03:15] fitted to water they were predestinated
[2:03:19] to be destroyed
[2:03:20] everybody care that's why he was
[2:03:22] hardening pharaoh
[2:03:24] as he wanted he could have gone
[2:03:27] take israel out of egypt and put him in
[2:03:31] the promised land
[2:03:32] we would not have learned his power he
[2:03:34] took pharaoh
[2:03:35] and designed him to object everything
[2:03:38] moses is saying
[2:03:39] how can you have this destroy this
[2:03:42] destroyed
[2:03:42] this destroy this picture and you still
[2:03:44] don't understand
[2:03:46] are you all that is something
[2:03:48] supernatural
[2:03:50] god wanted to show his power that if my
[2:03:54] kids are in difficulty are you there
[2:03:57] i can destroy even a kingdom all the way
[2:04:01] and pick them up and pull them out
[2:04:07] hallelujah if the man lion is roaring
[2:04:11] it's not for the younger to be afraid
[2:04:14] he's
[2:04:14] giving fear to the jungle not his own
[2:04:18] children
[2:04:21] and then when he turned to the children
[2:04:23] he said what are you wearing attack
[2:04:29] are you there you see me roaring i'm
[2:04:32] rolling so they can tremble
[2:04:34] when they are already fever you just go
[2:04:37] and slay them
[2:04:38] and he did that for israel the bible
[2:04:40] said god was sending his fear
[2:04:42] before are you there so when israel come
[2:04:46] even defeat the one in israel he sees
[2:04:49] you you are trembling he said oh i'm
[2:04:51] feeble
[2:04:51] let me do the just a new day oh i killed
[2:04:54] someone and he keep going
[2:04:55] it's god who make you powerless
[2:05:02] hallelujah and that he may make known
[2:05:05] the water of his glory
[2:05:08] on the vessel of water
[2:05:12] he done this he done this he need to be
[2:05:14] cast out in the church
[2:05:17] it depends on which vessel he is
[2:05:24] are you there it depends on which vessel
[2:05:26] he is
[2:05:28] if he is a vessel of mercy adam will
[2:05:32] commit something wrong
[2:05:36] to rescue him
[2:05:47] let me go if it's vessel of mercy
[2:05:50] which he had therefore prepared for

[2:13:46] heard that the who had also received the
[2:13:50] water
[2:13:52] so when peter came and preached and came
[2:13:55] back
[2:13:56] the brother got upset where are you
[2:13:59] coming from
[2:14:00] you went and preached to those gentiles
[2:14:01] you know we cannot go to the gentle
[2:14:04] fine and peter verse 2
[2:14:07] was come up to jerusalem day
[2:14:10] that way of circumcision did water
[2:14:14] they begin to argue with peter
[2:14:17] can you imagine somebody received the
[2:14:19] holy ghost
[2:14:20] and the people begin to get upset
[2:14:22] because someone received the holy ghost
[2:14:25] on the basis
[2:14:27] that because they are gentle
[2:14:31] in other words the holy ghost was only
[2:14:32] for us
[2:14:34] let's see first three saying
[2:14:38] you went into man wow
[2:14:41] and circumcised and did eat with them
[2:14:45] but peter he raised the mother from the
[2:14:47] beginning
[2:14:48] and expanded by order to them saying
[2:14:51] i was in the city of joppa praying and
[2:14:54] in a trance i saw a vision
[2:14:56] a certain vessel descending as he had
[2:14:59] been a great sheet
[2:15:00] let down from heaven by four corners and
[2:15:03] he came even to me
[2:15:04] upon the witch when i had fasted my eyes
[2:15:07] i consider and so four-footed beasts of
[2:15:09] the earth and wild beasts and creeping
[2:15:11] things and fall of the earth
[2:15:13] and i heard the voice saying to me arise
[2:15:16] peter slay and eat
[2:15:17] but i say not so who peter is answering
[2:15:21] god
[2:15:22] god is telling peter eat peter say no
[2:15:26] why is peter i'm answering that to god
[2:15:29] name a lord everybody care for nothing
[2:15:32] water
[2:15:34] all water unclean has
[2:15:37] at any time enter into my water
[2:15:40] that was the conception of peter by the
[2:15:44] law
[2:15:44] but the voice answered me again from
[2:15:48] heaven
[2:15:49] what god has what cleans
[2:15:52] that corn not you water
[2:15:56] in other words peter what you calling
[2:15:58] unclean
[2:15:59] in that vessel it is clean to me
[2:16:03] everybody clear so far jump to verse 15
[2:16:09] and as i begin to speak in the house of
[2:16:11] cornelius
[2:16:13] the holy ghost fell on them as on who at
[2:16:18] the world
[2:16:19] in other words when i begin to preach to
[2:16:21] these unclean people
[2:16:24] the way they receive the holy ghost is
[2:16:27] no
[2:16:27] different than the way we receive the
[2:16:31] holy ghost
[2:16:32] you follow me you follow me verse 16
[2:16:36] then remember i the word of the lord
[2:16:40] how he said john indeed baptized with
[2:16:43] water
[2:16:44] but you shall be baptized with the holy
[2:16:46] ghost for as
[2:16:48] much then as god gave
[2:16:51] them everybody give
[2:16:54] like gift as he did to us
[2:16:58] who believe on the lord jesus christ
[2:17:02] what was i that i could
[2:17:06] do what in other words god
[2:17:09] who is the boss declare
[2:17:12] these people to be cleansing
[2:17:15] and the way he gave them eternal life
[2:17:19] is exactly the same way
[2:17:22] he gave it to us making no distinction
[2:17:26] between the jews and the gentiles
[2:17:30] who am i peter to make
[2:17:33] distinction do you understand me
[2:17:37] who am i to categorize
[2:17:41] somebody that crossed this elevating
[2:17:44] putting him down why
[2:17:48] you follow me now peter is saying here
[2:17:51] now
[2:17:52] unto the wicked vessel as
[2:17:56] being what together of what
[2:18:02] you got it now in other words
[2:18:05] treat the woman not
[2:18:09] like the serpent amen you follow me
[2:18:13] but treat her as someone
[2:18:17] who received the holy ghost just like
[2:18:22] you
[2:18:25] you understand now if god took the holy
[2:18:28] ghost and put on a woman
[2:18:30] you need to change your way of treating
[2:18:34] him
[2:18:35] if god took the holy ghost and put on
[2:18:38] the gentile
[2:18:40] you need to change your thinking against
[2:18:43] the gentile
[2:18:48] that your prayer will be not water
[2:18:52] that's why your prayers are hindered
[2:18:54] because you are
[2:18:55] mistreating vessels that have the holy
[2:18:58] ghost
[2:18:59] you don't understand you are mistreating
[2:19:02] a child of god
[2:19:03] and god gets upset because you treating
[2:19:06] her
[2:19:07] like the serpent
[2:19:11] if the serpent feared god he would never
[2:19:13] have done that
[2:19:15] anybody clear in him
[2:19:19] was what
[2:19:22] a vessel of dishonor
[2:19:26] why did god allow this
[2:19:31] number three attribute
[2:19:34] maybe i'm going to stop here anybody
[2:19:37] clear
[2:19:39] let's get this and we're going to stop
[2:19:42] here don't want to go over
[2:19:44] in him was what who
[2:19:48] god what is an attribute
[2:19:52] a thought now you shall get something
[2:19:55] that will bother
[2:19:56] on the lesson for tonight notice he
[2:20:00] was his attribute that was in him

[2:20:17] be
[2:20:18] he was in him to be healed and all these
[2:20:22] things
[2:20:22] here are just displaying his water
[2:20:26] there is nothing out of order
[2:20:30] you think god didn't see the end from
[2:20:32] the beginning
[2:20:33] certainly he did there is nothing out of
[2:20:36] order
[2:20:37] it's just displaying his water now
[2:20:40] he could not be just and make a man to
[2:20:44] fall
[2:20:45] he had to put him on equal basis
[2:20:48] of free moral agency to make his own
[2:20:51] choice
[2:20:52] but knowing he would fall listen clearly
[2:20:56] now he can be a savior
