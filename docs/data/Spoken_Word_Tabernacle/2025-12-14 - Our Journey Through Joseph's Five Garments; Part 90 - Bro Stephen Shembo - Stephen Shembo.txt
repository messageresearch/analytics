[applause] As we prepare to take up our tithes and offerings, um, Brother Charles, you won't mind come blessing the tithes and offerings and you can give a testimony. you have a testimony while before you. &gt;&gt; Hey, God bless you everyone. &gt;&gt; Um, this past few weeks uh know we had our director of safety move on. So, a lot of that burden has been pressed upon me and uh I actually had I had a class this week and um during the class I was uh doing work for the company but you know also doing my, you know, trying to do my exams, trying to listen to what the instructor saying, you know, it was kind of all over the place. But, um, as the instructor was giving the class, the Lord was, you know, kept bringing things to me, you know, and I was hearing, you know, I would respond and I'll be right, sometimes I'd be wrong. Uh but if you're not familiar to understand the testimony um there was a point in my time where I had a photographic memory and I could just remember everything. If you forgot if you forgot I I'll make you remember. I'll tell you what you were wearing. I'll tell you what you were doing. But I got in a real bad accident and I've been fighting with that ever since. So those things have never been difficult for me to remember information. And um in safety you have to understand everything because you're like the lawyer in a sense. You have to understand the practices, the methods, the manufacturers, what they want, what they say, you know, because if something is wrong, you have to know what is wrong to a certain degree. So it's it's very complex. So, as I'm in the I'm I'm I'm in the uh the first day because this is very important for you to understand because I'm I'm this testimony is based upon what what he's saying and the the uh the as as the instructor was giving the class, you know, I'm receiving information. I'm forgetting information. Make a long story short, when there came time for me to take the exam, there was a a gentleman and everybody was baffled at this. He was a scientist. His family wanted to start some type of business building houses, remodeling houses, and because he was the smartest one, they wanted him to take the course. Um, we took the exam. I didn't pray. I wasn't concerned with this. I wasn't concerned with that. And the day before the exam, I'm trying to remember it as it comes to me at the day before the exam, the uh we left here on Wednesday night. And when I got home, I had a message on my phone from the uh the risk management director and he said we had an amputation on a project in in in Indiana. So now all hands are on deck. I'm trying to figure this out. Send this information and information. So it was a lot of pressure is what I'm saying. Um I told the instructor, listen, I may have to cut out for a meeting so on and so forth. I have to take the class again. So I take the exam. It was a 4-hour exam, right? And when it was time for the exam, I went straight down the list. D. Got everyone right except for one. Right. I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't paying attention what he was saying. It was an automatic straight down the line. And I wasn't paying attention the whole time in the class. The scientist next to me got more questions wrong than I did. Now, what I'm saying is even if you don't believe, just do it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Just put the burden on him &gt;&gt; because it's not it's it's it's not whoever's behind the desk. Who could care less? &gt;&gt; And I'll leave off by saying this. The Lord had brother Stephen meet me and my wife at a house. I I try not to give testimonies a lot and I'm probably wrong for that. But he said he had a conversation. He said, "Make five payments." Five payments here. He said, "Watch what God will do." Called the gentleman, talked to him, started making the five payments. I want to say around third payment, second payment. I said, "Yeah." We had a nice conversation because he was a Pentecostal brother. I said, "Yeah." I told him the conversation I had with my pastor and he said he said he he said what he almost he started crying on the phone. I told him he said make five payments. I made the five payments he said you do what God keeps you. Once I made the five payments I never heard again from the brother. On top of that, when the fifth payment was made, about an hour and a half later, I received a check for over $1,200. So, please, and there's many more testimonies. I don't want to take up time. Just do what he says. &gt;&gt; Especially you youth, don't get caught up in your mind. Okay, he said it. Lord, it's your fault. It's your fault because you had him say it. Don't look at no man. Just believe what God is saying because that's God's responsibility. Don't ever get in a position to where, well, that was brother Steve and that was God. You already in trouble. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. Just listen and do it. And I promise you, you won't be able to give the testimonies. You won't because nobody's going to believe it. &gt;&gt; All right. [applause] All right. Let us Amen. Praise God. Praise the Lord. All right. Let us let us pray. Father, heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for the word that you have given us in this hour, Lord God. It's changing our lives, Lord God. out of every fiber of our beings, Lord God. Lord, we're becoming more and more like you each and every day, Father. Lord, as your word is transforming us, heavenly father, as you have selected us in this hour, Lord God, to be put on display for thy name's sake, Lord Jesus, we give you thanks, Heavenly Father, for all that you're doing, Lord God. Father, we thank you, Lord God, for the couple's meeting yesterday, heavenly father. Lord, we understand, Lord God, that there's things that need to be put back in line, Lord God. And we thank you for your word, Father, laying a foundation, Lord God. you truly being the guide, leading us and guiding us on what we ought to do, Father, for these promises to be fulfilled, Father. Lord, if there's any, Lord, uh, stubbornness, Lord, in in in any one of us, Lord God, that don't want to move into what you would have us to do, Father, we ask for your mercy. We ask for your grace, heavenly father, because your word is like a hammer, Lord Jesus Christ. Your word says and you promised us, Lord God, that the things that you have for us today, Lord God, they will they will all come to pass, Lord God, and they will not be hindered, Father, for your word will not return to you void, Father. Lord, continue to bless the building project, Lord God, and every addition and every vision you have given, Lord, Brother Steven, Father, I pray that you touch I pray, Lord God, that you help us, Lord, to pray more one for another and more for the work that's being done, Father. Lord, your prophet said that the the the the man that's carrying the ball, we don't ought to take the ball from him, but we ought to pray and we ought to block for him, heavenly father. So, anytime we see spirits lingering, Lord God, attacking the pastor, attacking the youth, Father, Lord, strike a seed, Lord, deep down within us, Father, to remember these things, Father, to help the pastor, Lord God, as he's taken on these battles, Lord God, as you have led the shepherd to do so, Father. Lord, we thank you, Lord God. And we pray, Father, for the tithes and offerings, Lord God. And we pray that you use them for the furtherance of your kingdom, Lord God. Touch hearts, Lord God, to do the supernatural, heavenly father. Lord God, we pray, heavenly father, that you take the remainder of this service in your hands, Father. And we wait for your appearing, heavenly father. We know you're here, Father, but there's another gear. There's another level, Heavenly Father, that we're in expectation for, Father. And we have never come in this place, Lord God, and left the same, Father. You've always met our expectations, Lord God. So help us to hear from you, Lord God, and change us as you promised to do. For we ask you this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we going we got a couple of specials. Um um yeah, but Sister Gif, Sister Yok, we're going to let brother Michael testify real quick before she come up. So sister G get ready. &gt;&gt; Um this testimony is burning. I should have it Wednesday, but um last Monday um I delivered my two loads for the morning and then the load for the next day. They wanted us to pick it up the Monday where they say it's going to be ice and so on. So, all you truckers who know about the fifth wheel on the on your truck, you know, it's that round disc in the back of the um semi that locks onto the trailer. Uh I did my two loads locked onto the new trailer that I'm pulling the new load. And I'm pulling out of the yard. And as I'm pulling out, I heard a big bang, you know, and it shook the whole truck. And I put it in park and I come out to see what it was. I looked. I thought it was the the antilock brakes cuz I was having a little problem with it showing the light. So I thought it was just a brake release and I looked everywhere. Everything seems fine. So I came out of there, took a left, took another left, took a right, took a Uturn, took a right, another right to where I stopped and I got there to where I parked the truck and um I thought it was the ABS light. So I looking at the ABS. I don't see nothing wrong with it. And I looked at the back of the truck and I said, "How is it my trailer is almost at the at the end of the wheel, the last wheel?" And when I looked, the the the fifth wheel slid out and was just hanging on. And I had 21 tons of steel on that truck and my heart just leapt. Then I started to rejoice because God say he'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll never forsake you. He'll be with you. So when it doesn't seem like he's there, he's there. He's a hedge.

I depend completely upon the Holy Spirit and we all depend from thee because it's an it's a work of the spirit. May you come and move us completely out of the way. May you come and speak to us, seal the devil and every demon away from this place and Lord come down in the power of resurrection and bless us like you did yesterday and even more than yesterday in the name of Jesus Christ.

So usually I go to bed around 2:00 a.m. 3:00 a.m. on Saturday and for some reason I went to bed around 1:00. So your prayer work &gt;&gt; [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine somebody's praying for me? &gt;&gt; God is alive. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 34. If Lord's willing, my subject is what we didn't preach last time and we tried to preach. It's a mysterious season. Mysterious season. mysterious season in the parable. I hope somebody already read this parable to make your life easy. If you didn't, be my guest. In the parable of the 10 pound, the 10 pound it is also called in another translation 10 manners which is a salary for three month one pound. We clear? &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh my subject matter this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part &gt;&gt; nandi &gt;&gt; we are still in the second garment we on part nandi so I don't know when we will get to the fifth one and the theme is a mysterious season in the parable of the 10 pound Exodus 34 if you there? You can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Please keep your seat belt. &gt;&gt; Stay alert &gt;&gt; because this could be a road that you have not traveled before. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose anyone. I will walk you up slowly, &gt;&gt; but stay alert. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Verse one. And the Lord said to Moses, you may be seated. Your prayer has been answered. [laughter] The Lord said to Moses, we understand clearly who Moses is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this church, you know who Moses is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses is not an ordinary prophet. &gt;&gt; You got your whistle, brother Polyar. Yeah. Thank you. Uhhuh. Thank you. So now we can preach very well. Moses is not an ordinary prophet. Moses was a prophet that spoke with God face to face. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Exodus 33:1, we will continue our reading. I have not started preaching yet. So keep your 45 minutes. I will tell you when you start counting that. In Exodus 33:11, the Bible say, "And the Lord spake unto who?" &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; Face to face. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "No one have seen God &gt;&gt; at any time." But Moses was talking to God face to face. Which face was Moses seeing? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. Come on now, brother. Because God appeared to Moses in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; I hope you can swallow this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, when God was talking to Moses, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was not just using a voice. &gt;&gt; God will appear to Moses. &gt;&gt; And Moses and God will look at each other. Come on. &gt;&gt; You are slow, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will look. He will speak to Moses. How? &gt;&gt; Face to face. &gt;&gt; As a man speaketh unto who? &gt;&gt; His friend. &gt;&gt; You know how you talk to your friend? &gt;&gt; To your body. Body. You know how you talk to your friend? &gt;&gt; That's the way God was talking to Moses. &gt;&gt; How far do you talk to your friend? &gt;&gt; How closer do you talk to your friend? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can come even to your friend and you say listen listen listen because it's your friend. That's the way God &gt;&gt; was talking to Moses. &gt;&gt; So Moses have an idea of how God look like. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know there is a scripture troubling you. When he says, "Can I see your glory?" &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Can I see your face?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says the glory And God show him the back. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why they have to show him the back. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Elohim have to show Sarah the back. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why brother Brham have to show you the back. [cheering] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why the seven still have to be sealed in the back. &gt;&gt; That's why I told you stay awake. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But we're not talking about the back. We're talking about the face of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, somebody who can at least describe you, God, &gt;&gt; is Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God was talking to Moses face to face. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he turned again into the camp. And his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the water &gt;&gt; tabernacle. In number 12 verse8 the Bible say with him Moses will I speak how? &gt;&gt; Mouth to mouth. &gt;&gt; Now it's no more face to face. &gt;&gt; It is mouthto mouth even how &gt;&gt; apparently &gt;&gt; and not in what &gt;&gt; in dark speeches. &gt;&gt; In other word God was not using parable. &gt;&gt; Apparently that's correct. He was not using I mean uh I mean speech figure or whatever to talk to Moses. God was talking to Moses direct &gt;&gt; plan. &gt;&gt; In other words, WHEN GOD TALKED TO MOSES, Moses cannot sit and say I wonder what did God want to tell me when he was saying that Moses didn't have a time to read between the lines. &gt;&gt; He was clear to Moses. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what God is saying here. And the Bible say, "And the similitude, &gt;&gt; this is the form." &gt;&gt; The similitude of who? &gt;&gt; The Lord &gt;&gt; shall he what? &gt;&gt; Behold. &gt;&gt; SO MOSES SAW HOW GOD LOOK LIKE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. You can verify your Bible. I just put it here to save you time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To flip the pages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses was a prophet that knew God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That saw the form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We saw the form of God in the man Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Moses saw God before he was in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses saw God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW THE GOD that was hidden in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW GOD WITHOUT a clo. &gt;&gt; That's too strong. Let me help you. Moses saw God without a veil. Now he will help you. Amen. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, MOSES SAW CHRIST. &gt;&gt; MOSES, why are you studying like this? MOSES DID NOT SEE JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SAW CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got the name Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you swallow this stuff? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the one that was born from Mary. You shall have a child and you shall call his name what? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's the man that you see there. &gt;&gt; And he took the name of the father. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT THE FATHER CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Was inside Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY JESUS COULD CRY AND SAY, "MY FATHER, &gt;&gt; MY FATHER, why have you forsaken me?" IN OTHER WORDS, CHRIST CROSS YOU GOING AWAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY NEVER KILL CHRIST AT THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST FOREVER, &gt;&gt; THEY ONLY KILLED JESUS CHRIST. YES. &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE CHRIST AND JESUS WAS ONE, &gt;&gt; when you kill Jesus, IT IS COUNTED LIKE YOU KILL GOD. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T KILL GOD. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO MOSES NEVER SAW JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; MOSES SAW CHRIST &gt;&gt; AND HE SAW THE FORM OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because Christ can change form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how you taking longer to move from one scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHEREFORE then were ye not afraid to speak against who?" &gt;&gt; My servant Moses. &gt;&gt; In other words, God was saying, "Don't play with Moses." &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Moses is another caliber. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Moses is a prophet that me and him, we deal differently than any other prophet. And when God deal with somebody at that level, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU HANDLING HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE A MAN THAT CAN SEE GOD, &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; A MAN THAT CAN TALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; A MAN THAT CAN TAKE his hand on the wheel and God begin to drive the car. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me keep those bullet. You don't you don't you not ready for them yet. Amen. WHEN YOU SEE A MAN LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T PLAY WITH A MAN LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T BLABBER AGAINST A MAN LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T PUT UP ALL TYPE OF VIDEO on YouTube against a man like that. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WILL PAY FOR IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT MAN SOMETIME WILL GIVE YOU CONFUSION. YOU MUST THINK IT'S HIM WHEN IT'S NOT HIM. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM, YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM &gt;&gt; AND YOU HEARING HIS VOICE, &gt;&gt; BUT TRULY IT'S NOT HIM. &gt;&gt; SOMETIME HE'S NOT EVEN IN HIS BODY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SOMETIME DUMB MAN HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIS OWN TAPE like this. [cheering] Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to come off from the airport. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; We play around this truth. Let I mean in the message left and right. There is no time for playing. &gt;&gt; We need to open the word clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't reject ANY QUOTE. WE TAKE EVERY SINGLE QUOTE. AND WE PUT IT TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brana. Uh in the book of Deuteronomy 34:10, the Bible say there arose not who &gt;&gt; a prophet. &gt;&gt; Since in Israel like unto who? &gt;&gt; Moses &gt;&gt; whom the LORD KNEW HOW &gt;&gt; FACE to face. &gt;&gt; SO NO ONE WAS IN THE CALIBER OF MOSES. YES. &gt;&gt; Moses even say that the Lord your God &gt;&gt; will send a prophet &gt;&gt; like unto who? &gt;&gt; So you need to understand Moses before you understand Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I see my mother there. God bless you mama. God bless you. [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Amen. Listen to what brother BRHAM SAID. BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "THIS is Moses and God talking how?" &gt;&gt; Face to face. &gt;&gt; NOW, THERE WAS NEVER a man in all the earth. &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF WHO? &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THAT EVER TALK FACE TO FACE WITH GOD BUT MOSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, if there were people that talk face to face, it's only Moses and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. The Bible say if there be one who spiritual or a prophet brother Brandham say and the Lord will make myself known unto him in what? &gt;&gt; In visions &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; in dreams. &gt;&gt; But as for my servant WHO? &gt;&gt; MOSES. &gt;&gt; I TALKED TO HIM HOW &gt;&gt; face to face. &gt;&gt; SEE OF COURSE HE WAS A TYPE OF WHO? &gt;&gt; CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. That's why Jesus say if you would have believed Moses &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you would not have a problem with me &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER EVEN UNDERSTOOD Moses &gt;&gt; we clear so far &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; is it too strong &gt;&gt; no sir &gt;&gt; let's continue our reading &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID TO MOSES NOW you understand Moses &gt;&gt; you put Moses we talking about his face and his mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got God here. You talking about the face of God and the face of Moses. The mouth of God and the mouth of Moses. &gt;&gt; But the main thing the face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you two tables of stone. You understand this now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the first one was destroyed. And the first one was not yun by go uh by Moses. &gt;&gt; God did both of them. &gt;&gt; No problem. In Exodus 31st verse 18 the Bible say and he gave unto Moses God when he made an end of communing of talking with him upon mansana he gave Moses what? Two tables of testimony. &gt;&gt; Two table of testimony. Tables of what? &gt;&gt; Stone &gt;&gt; written with what? &gt;&gt; The finger of God. &gt;&gt; When we say finger of God, you're looking at this. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE TABLE of the commandment, the table of the commandment, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. were written by the finger of God. &gt;&gt; You know when Moses was working in Israel, I mean in Egypt &gt;&gt; and uh and Pharaoh magician try try and after a while they saym [clears throat] this is the finger of God. Did they see a a finger with a nail or things like that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; THE THE TABLE was written by the finger of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh chapter 32 verse uh we on 34. This is before. This is the first table. &gt;&gt; The chapter 34 is the second table. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? This is 31 and 32. It's before 34. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses turned and went down from what? &gt;&gt; The mount. &gt;&gt; And the two table of the testimony were where? &gt;&gt; In his hand. &gt;&gt; This is tough. So Moses was coming down the mountain with two table of the testimony open. a prophet in a mountain with an open testimony. &gt;&gt; Some of them I I will continue to hide since you you can't swallow them. No problem. Amen. AND THE TWO TABLE OF THE testimony were in his hand. The table were written how? &gt;&gt; On both their sides. &gt;&gt; So the table were written within and without. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The table were not just written like this. &gt;&gt; That's your movie. &gt;&gt; That's the movie of Moses. &gt;&gt; That's what you saw on the movie and in cartoons. &gt;&gt; The tables were were written on the front and on the back &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION, YOU WILL SEE A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN WITHIN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; And they were written on both side. On the one side and on the other hand were they what? Written. &gt;&gt; And we know they were written by the finger of God. And the TABLE WERE THE WORK OF WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; SO WHO CHOPPED THE &gt;&gt; the the stone? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So these table were written by God and they were also the work of God. &gt;&gt; So they were yuned by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God went into A ROCK AND CHOPPED the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God himself wrote on the rock. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And took it and gave it to Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND MOSES TOOK THAT AND DESTROY IT. &gt;&gt; YES, he did. [laughter] &gt;&gt; The table WERE THE WORK OF WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; And the riding was the riding of who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Graven upon water. the tables. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE FIRST TABLE THAT WAS DESTROYED. NOW IN Exodus 34, God is telling Moses, "Now you come, &gt;&gt; you go ahead." Not God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; IT IS NOW THE TURN of Moses to do some work. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why I tell you read the message. You're giving me double work. &gt;&gt; You remember the the vision of Junior Jackson. &gt;&gt; I send you quote. All of you in the group chat, I send you quote. You remember that? &gt;&gt; The vision have two part. You remember that? &gt;&gt; The first part was written &gt;&gt; by an unknown hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he get to the top, he chopped the part. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took something sharp. and chop the mountain. &gt;&gt; The prophet begin to chop the rock. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham opened this, there was nothing written. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham took that and went to the west &gt;&gt; to meet God in the mountain &gt;&gt; so God can tell him what is written in what seems to be not written. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now God BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THIS ONE he interpreted without any problem. &gt;&gt; He got in here. This is where brother Brandham was unable to interpret. WE FOUND OUT THAT THE FIRST TABLE OF THE testimony was written by God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; CHOPPED BY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SECOND ONE, GOD IS TELLING MOSES, you &gt;&gt; no more me. &gt;&gt; You who broke the table. &gt;&gt; You go get some tools and go chop the mountain. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CHOP THE MOUNTAIN, DON'T WRITE ANYTHING THERE. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. SO MOSES CUT the table and pick UP THE TABLE WITHOUT any writing. &gt;&gt; And Moses went to &gt;&gt; Mona. &gt;&gt; He went to the mountain &gt;&gt; with a rock without riding &gt;&gt; it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? A ROCK THAT MOSES IS THE ONE THAT CUT IT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he went with that rock, he went all the way to the mountain for God to write on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE CHOPPING PART IS MOSES. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; But the writing ON THE ROCK MUST COME from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when God write, God always write with his finger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONE DAY WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT IN ADULTERY, GOD IN HUMAN FLESH DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE. HE WENT ON the ground and he BEGIN TO WRITE &gt;&gt; WHATEVER WAS WRITTEN THERE. ME AND YOU, WE DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN EVERYBODY SAW THAT THEY TURN AROUND &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WAS RIDING AGAIN &gt;&gt; ON THE IN BABYLON WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING WITH THE STAFF OF THE TEMPLE. THE BIBLE SAY A HAND CAME OUT &gt;&gt; AND BEGIN TO WRITE OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN [screaming] WRITE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAY in Deuteronomy 10:1, "And that time the Lord say unto Moses, do what? &gt;&gt; You the two tables of &gt;&gt; the same story in Deuteronomy, like unto THE FIRST, AND COME UP UNTO me where? &gt;&gt; Into the mount, &gt;&gt; and make thee what? &gt;&gt; An ark of wood." &gt;&gt; And I will write on the table the word that were in the first table, which thou breakest, and thou shalt put them where? in the ark. &gt;&gt; And I made a knock of shield wood and you two table of stone like unto the first and went up where &gt;&gt; into the mount &gt;&gt; having the two table where &gt;&gt; in mine hand &gt;&gt; and he GOD WROTE ON THE TABLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE FIRST writing the ten commandment which the Lord spake unto you in the mount of the midst of the fire in the day of water &gt;&gt; these &gt;&gt; and the Lord gave them unto who? &gt;&gt; Me. When we say riding with the finger of God, what does the finger of God means? &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF Luke 11:20, BUT IF I Jesus &gt;&gt; Jesus is talking, if I with what? &gt;&gt; The finger of God &gt;&gt; do what? &gt;&gt; Cast out devils. &gt;&gt; NOT THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD is come upon who? &gt;&gt; YOU. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAS CASTING out devil with what? &gt;&gt; The finger of God. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DOES FINGER OF GOD MEANS? ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER MATTHEW GIVE US MORE clarity in Matthew 12:28. The same scripture.

BUT HE HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MOSES CAN CUT THE STONE, BUT MOSES CANNOT WRITE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WRITING NEED TO COME FROM THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEIR WRITTEN WORD MUST BE INTERPRETED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE ARE LISTENING TO THE TAPE, WE ARE NOT LISTENING TO BROTHER BRAN.

Then Moses rose up early in the morning and went to the mount to Mount Sana as the Lord has commanded him. And he took in his hand what &gt;&gt; the mount the two tables of stone &gt;&gt; without anything written on there. AND THE LORD DESCENDED HOW &gt;&gt; IN THE CLOUD. &gt;&gt; So is it A PROBLEM TO SEE A MOUNTAIN WITH A CLOUD? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DONE IN THE BIBLE. THE &gt;&gt; IN TRANSFIGURATION, GOD CAME IN THE CLOUD. &gt;&gt; GOD LOVED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; GOD CAME ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A WHAT? &gt;&gt; CLOUD. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE DESCENDED IN THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN with a cloud.

THE SECOND GROUP, &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY THERE [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND GROUP SAY SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; THEY SAY WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL SPAKE TO HIM. &gt;&gt; SO THE VOICE OF GOD WHEN GOD SPEAK [cheering] &gt;&gt; IT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THUNDER OR AN ANGEL? &gt;&gt; A THUNDER OR WHAT? AN ANGEL. &gt;&gt; IT IS A THUNDER OR WHAT? &gt;&gt; AN ANGEL. &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION 10, &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY ANGEL CAME &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SPOKE, THE VOICE CAME UP LIKE A THUNDER.

WE GOT A MIGHTY ANGEL WITH A COVENANT. &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW AN ANGEL WITH A COVENANT IS CHRIST. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU NOTICE, THE BIBLE SAY HE CAME WITH A CLOUD &gt;&gt; IN REVELATION 10. &gt;&gt; WITH A CLOUD.

In verse 27, AND THE LORD SAID to who? &gt;&gt; Moses, &gt;&gt; write you this word. &gt;&gt; For I have for after the water, &gt;&gt; the tenor of these words &gt;&gt; I have made it what? &gt;&gt; A covenant with thee and &gt;&gt; and with water &gt;&gt; and with Israel. &gt;&gt; So certain things Moses was riding. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Certain things God was riding. &gt;&gt; I have to refocus and correct that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 28. AND HE WAS THERE WITH WHO? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; His friend. How many days? 40 days &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and 40 nights. &gt;&gt; And he did neither eat &gt;&gt; bread nor water. &gt;&gt; Drink water. &gt;&gt; How many days? &gt;&gt; 40 days. &gt;&gt; And how many nights? &gt;&gt; 40 nights. &gt;&gt; Whoever done that in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; So you understand who Moses was. &gt;&gt; The one who reproduced that &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we clear now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 40 days and 40 now he did need a what? Eat bread no water &gt;&gt; drink water. &gt;&gt; And he your God wrote upon the table the word of water &gt;&gt; the covenant &gt;&gt; the water &gt;&gt; the ten commandments. &gt;&gt; This is where we getting my friend. And it came to pass when Moses came down from the mountain with the two table of the testimony uhh in Moses hand. when he came down from the mountain that Moses knew not THAT THE SKIN OF WHERE &gt;&gt; his face &gt;&gt; my friend &gt;&gt; stay up &gt;&gt; the skin of what &gt;&gt; his face &gt;&gt; the face of Moses &gt;&gt; Moses was there &gt;&gt; he was talking to God but his hand never uh give light &gt;&gt; his body never give light. &gt;&gt; The light was only going to the face. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And his face was looking at the face of God. &gt;&gt; So he looked at God so much. &gt;&gt; He looked at the similitude of God so much. &gt;&gt; HE STAYED TOO LONG BEFORE THE MAGNET. HE RUB AGAINST THE MAGNET SO much &gt;&gt; that when he came off, &gt;&gt; HE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BEGIN TO ATTRACT &gt;&gt; ADAM. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The way you looking at some of you are looking at me, it looks like I'm saying something that is not written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Boys, we were playing with magnet before. If you get a metal &gt;&gt; and you rub it in the magnet, you rub, you rub, you rub FOR SO LONG, &gt;&gt; THE CAPACITY OF THE magnet will be transferred to THE METAL &gt;&gt; AND THAT medal itself can go AND BEGIN TO ATTRACT OTHER MEDAL. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE MEDAL ATTRACTING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BEFORE THE MEDAL DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS THE MAGNET IN THE MIDDLE. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOW BROTHER BRAND PULLING YOU. IT IS THE MAGNET INSIDE BROTHER BRANA. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HIS GRAMMAR WAS NOT GOOD. &gt;&gt; WE WENT TO SCHOOL MORE THAN BROTHER. &gt;&gt; HOW DO WE LISTEN TO A SERMON OF SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T GO TO OUR level of SCHOOL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS A MAGNET THERE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS THE SKIN OF HIS FACE DID water &gt;&gt; shown while he talked WITH HIM &gt;&gt; WHILE HE TALKED WATER &gt;&gt; WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MAGNET ALREADY AFFECTED HIM. &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT KIND OF element was in Moses body &gt;&gt; THAT HIS BODY BEGIN to shine &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BODIES THAT SH are angelic BODIES &gt;&gt; BUT THIS HUMAN BODY BEGIN to shine. IN OTHER WORDS, SOME ELEMENT from the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; begin to enter &gt;&gt; into the &gt;&gt; Amen. AND MOSES BEGIN TO REFLECT THE pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, MOSES BECAME A LIGHT. WHEN IT'S NIGHT, MOSES DOESN'T NEED YOUR LIGHT. &gt;&gt; He's shining. &gt;&gt; MOSES DOESN'T NEED YOUR LIGHT IN DARK. HIS WHOLE FACE IS IS ILLUMINATING THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF IF YOU CAN'T SWALLOW THIS, WE SKIP. WE wait till you grow up again. &gt;&gt; But I know you grown up already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND VERSE 30. AND WHEN AARON AND ALL Israel saw Moses, behold the skin did what? &gt;&gt; His face shone. &gt;&gt; And they were what? &gt;&gt; AFRAID TO COME. &gt;&gt; EVEN AARON BECOME AFRAID. HE SAID, "HEY, &gt;&gt; BROTHER BEGIN TO SHINE." Back up. What happened to you? &gt;&gt; IS IT A GHOST OR A HUMAN BEING? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. verse uh uh uh 32 uh 31. AND MOSES CALLED THEM and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation return to him. In other words, be not afraid. &gt;&gt; And Moses talked with them. AND AFTERWARD ALL THE CHILDREN of Israel did what? &gt;&gt; Came. &gt;&gt; Ah. When the clergy stood up, they say, "Okay, nobody died." Ah, so let's get closer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. They came near and he gave them what? &gt;&gt; In commandment &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Uh that the Lord has spoken where &gt;&gt; with him on Mount Si. &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL MOSES HAS DONE SPEAKING WITH THEM, he did what? &gt;&gt; He put a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; We understand this clearly. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES WANT TO TALK, &gt;&gt; he removed the veil &gt;&gt; and you see his face &gt;&gt; and he talked to you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? AFTER MOSES FINISHED TALKING, &gt;&gt; Moses take the veil and put back up. &gt;&gt; So when you see a man without a head &gt;&gt; or a man that HAVE A HEAD THAT is veil, &gt;&gt; it's Moses. &gt;&gt; The head or the face of Moses, his head was veil. &gt;&gt; His head was wrapped up. &gt;&gt; We clear? Amen. We clear? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; VERSE 33. UNTIL MOSES done speaking with them, he put water, &gt;&gt; a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MOSES went in before the Lord to speak with him, he did what? &gt;&gt; He took the veil off &gt;&gt; until he did what? &gt;&gt; He came out &gt;&gt; and and he CAME OUT AND SPOKE TO THE CHILDREN of Israel that which was what &gt;&gt; commanded. &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of who? Moses &gt;&gt; did what shown &gt;&gt; and Moses put the veil upon his face until he went to speak with who? &gt;&gt; WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; SO GOD AND MOSES SPOKE FACE TO FACE. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS TALKING TO MOSES, GOD REVEAL God remove his veil &gt;&gt; and Moses also remove his veil &gt;&gt; and both OF THEM ARE TALKING AND ONE IS CHARGING THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; You tired? &gt;&gt; No. I preached yesterday so you should be more in strength than me. And one is charging the other. WHEN THE CHARGING IS FULL, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; God unplug the charging. &gt;&gt; NOW MOSES HAVE NOW THE CAPACITY OF GOD IN HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD ALREADY TRANSFER HIMSELF &gt;&gt; INTO MOSES. SO WHEN MOSES IS COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN, &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; IT IS NO LONGER MOSES. BECAUSE NOW GOD [screaming] IN MOSES, &gt;&gt; please let's stay refocused. &gt;&gt; Forget about the moving. FOCUS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; WHENEVER GOD PUT THE CHARGING ON MOSES, I'm reading the Bible. If you finish the reading, we move on. &gt;&gt; WHENEVER WHENEVER GOD PUT the charging, &gt;&gt; God take his energy, &gt;&gt; his word &gt;&gt; and transfer that to Moses &gt;&gt; because Israel say WE DON'T WANT TO TALK TO THE GENERATOR. We can't stand THE GENERATOR. THE GENERATOR is boom boom boomh. We can't stand the boom boom. You You can stand the boom boom. You go over there. &gt;&gt; So Moses was a MEDIATOR &gt;&gt; BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; IS HE TOO STRONG? MOSES WAS THE MAN IN BETWEEN. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE PEOPLE TALKED TO MOSES AND MOSES GO TALK TO GOD AND GOD TALKED TO MOSES AND MOSES GO TALK TO PEOPLE. HE BECAME A GOING BETWEEN MAN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN MOSES COME TO GOD, GOD SAY WHY AM I WASTING TIME? YOU GET ME in you &gt;&gt; and you go. Are we together? SO WHEN MOSES IS COMING FROM THE MOUNTAIN, IT IS NO LONGER MOSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS MOSES WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; UNTIL MOSES DELIVERED THE MESSAGE, THEN HE BECOME MOSES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER BROWN SAY MOSES WAS THE VEIL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE LIVING WORD OF GOD VEILED WHERE? &gt;&gt; BEHIND HUMAN FLESH. &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE [screaming] WAS IN MOSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM SWALLOWING THIS, WHAT IS COMING UP WILL choke you. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THE PILL OF FIRE WAS WHERE? &gt;&gt; IN MOSES. IN GOD IS OF COURSE SPEAKING OF WHAT WAS TO BE THERE WHEN &gt;&gt; later behind skin. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD MOSES WAS A PREFUGER OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

THE HOLY GHOST COME through the preaching of the WORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS SAY MY word &gt;&gt; are spirit &gt;&gt; and they ARE WHAT &gt;&gt; THEY ARE LIFE. SO WHEN THE WORD IS COMING &gt;&gt; THE LIFE OF GOD IS COMING &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS COMING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT ARE ONE &gt;&gt; MESSAGE BELIEVER NEED TO GROW UP FROM THE PRAYER LINE. IT IS TAKING TOO LONG. &gt;&gt; HE WEARY THE PREACHER. &gt;&gt; THE PREACHER IS ALREADY WORN OUT BY THE PREACHING OF THE WORD AND HE'S GOING TO STAY ONE HOUR TO PRAY FOR EVERYBODY IN THE CONGREGATION.

IN OTHER WORDS, GOD PICKED you &gt;&gt; and God wired you &gt;&gt; to bring FORTH FRUIT. &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE BEEN chosen &gt;&gt; and ordained &gt;&gt; PREDESTINATED &gt;&gt; CONDEMN &gt;&gt; FORCE &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.

[cheering] WHAT YOU NEED IS JUST THE SEASON [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FRUIT &gt;&gt; YES LORD &gt;&gt; COMES IN SEASON. &gt;&gt; WHENEVER THE SEASON COME, YOU DON'T HELP THE TREE. &gt;&gt; NO SIR, &gt;&gt; THE TREE WILL BRING ITSELF FRUIT &gt;&gt; ABUNDANTLY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ABUNDANTLY, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CHIEF, ARE WE TOGETHER OVER THERE? &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. CHIEF SAY HE'S DOING OKAY. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE SAY ORDAIN, you should be even screaming. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS TWO WAYS TO BE ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; IN THE BOOK OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; ACTS &gt;&gt; verse what? &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; CHAPTER 13:48. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY? AND WHEN THE JEWS, &gt;&gt; GENTILES, &gt;&gt; when the who? &gt;&gt; Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Who's a Jew here? &gt;&gt; Spiritually? Yes. &gt;&gt; SPIRITUALLY? YES. &gt;&gt; You are a Jew spiritually? &gt;&gt; AH. WHENEVER THE GENTILE HEARD THIS, &gt;&gt; THEY WERE HOW? &gt;&gt; GLAD &gt;&gt; AND DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE GENTILE. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING, THE WORD IS REJOICING THEM. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD WAS COMING TO THEM, &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; THE ONE WHO CAME HOME UPSET SUDDENLY GOES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. IT'S AN &gt;&gt; INDICATOR. &gt;&gt; HE INDICATES SOMETHING IS IN YOU. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU EVEN FORGET THAT YOU WERE TIRED. &gt;&gt; YOU EVEN FORGET YOU DIDN'T SLEEP RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE ALL THE SLEEPNESS IS GOING AWAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I see it. I SEE IT NOW. AH, [screaming] GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE GENTILE WHO RECEIVED THE WORD HOW? &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY A DEAD CHURCH IS A PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE GENTILE RECEIVED IT. HOW? &gt;&gt; GLAD. &gt;&gt; AND THEY DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN THE GENTILE WERE COMING, THEY SAID, "DID YOU HEAR THAT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; DID YOU HEAR TODAY? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SISTER, YOU HEARD IT, &gt;&gt; BROTHER ANGELO. I NEVER SEEN THAT. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU THE SERMON WE GOT. OH, GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S AN INDICATOR THAT YOU ARE SOMEBODY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THEY DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; GLORIFIED THE word of THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AND AS MANY AS WAS WHAT? ORDAINED TO ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; THEY DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; SO TO BE ORDAINED, IN OTHER WORDS, ETERNAL LIFE IS SEARCHING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE? OPEN UP. &gt;&gt; ORDAINED TO [screaming] ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; HOW DO I KNOW I'M ORDAINED? WHEN THE WORD COME, WATCH YOUR REACTION. &gt;&gt; WATCH YOUR REACTION TO THE WORD. IF THE WORD IS CHANGING YOU, &gt;&gt; MOLDING YOU, &gt;&gt; MAKING YOU FEEL WARM, SIR, &gt;&gt; HAPPY, JOYFUL, YOU SAY AH, [screaming] [cheering] ETERNAL LIFE IS HERE. ETERNAL LIFE IS PULLING ETERNAL LIFE. ETERNAL LIFE IS COMING TO ETERNAL LIFE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE BIBLE SAY I HAVE ordained you &gt;&gt; to bring forth fruit, &gt;&gt; we can go to sleep. &gt;&gt; You can tell the devil, listen, my friend, &gt;&gt; keep wasting your time. &gt;&gt; But I will prove you. I say, look at this. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; You remember how many time I was upset? Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen since 6 months, do you ever seen me getting upset? &gt;&gt; I told you &gt;&gt; I was ordained &gt;&gt; to produce temperance, &gt;&gt; to produce patience, to produce longsuffering. &gt;&gt; And as a MATTER OF FACT, YOUR TRIAL HELP ME PUSH QUICKLY. [cheering] YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ORDAINED LIKE YOU. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF JUDE, FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN MEN THAT DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Prepped and unawares. &gt;&gt; Who were BEFORE WHAT? &gt;&gt; OF OLD. &gt;&gt; WHERE? &gt;&gt; Ordained to THIS CONDEMNATION. &gt;&gt; OR ORDAINED TO THIS CONDEMNATION. WHAT MAN? &gt;&gt; UNGODLINESS. &gt;&gt; SO SOME PEOPLE ARE ORDAINED TO GO TO HELL. SO IF I SEE YOU WRESTLING WITH THE MESSAGE TOO MUCH, &gt;&gt; it's normal. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you ordain, &gt;&gt; but I won't go to hell with you. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND JESUS SAID, I HAVE ORDAINED YOU &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE ALSO CHOSEN YOU. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN THEY SAY CHOSEN YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE IS CHOSEN AND CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at THIS MY FRIEND. THE BIBLE SAYS IN JOHN 6 VERSE WHAT? &gt;&gt; 70 AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; 71. &gt;&gt; JESUS ANSWERED THEM, "HAVE I NOT CHOSE YOU?" HOW MANY? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF YOU IS A DEVIL. SO THEY CHOSE 11 GOOD AND ONE A DEVIL &gt;&gt; BUT CHOSEN BY GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE IT'S IN JOHN 6. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS WAS TALKING TO THE DISCIPLE IN JOHN 15. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN JOHN 6 AND 15 SOMETHING HAPPENED. AH &gt;&gt; IN JOHN 6 HE SAY I CHOSEN ALL OF YOU &gt;&gt; but one of you is a devil &gt;&gt; and THE DEVIL THE BIBLE SAY HE SPAKE OF WHO? &gt;&gt; Judas the scariot &gt;&gt; the son of what? &gt;&gt; Simon &gt;&gt; for he WAS THAT SHOULD DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Betray him &gt;&gt; being one of what? &gt;&gt; The 12. &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN JOHN 6. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; IN JOHN 13 &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN 15. Jesus says Jesus answered here it IS &gt;&gt; TO WHOM I SHALL GIVE WHAT &gt;&gt; A soap &gt;&gt; when I have dipped it. AND WHEN HE HAD DIPPED THE SOAP HE GAVE IT TO WHO? &gt;&gt; JUDAS A SCARIOT. &gt;&gt; THE SON OF WHOM? &gt;&gt; SIMON. &gt;&gt; AND AFTER THE SUMP &gt;&gt; SATAN DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; ENTERED INTO HIM. &gt;&gt; SO SATAN ENTERED JUDAH IN JOHN 13 &gt;&gt; BEFORE JOHN 14. BEFORE JOHN 15, &gt;&gt; SATAN ENTER HIM. THEN SAY JESUS UNTO HIM, THAT THAT DOEST DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GO ahead and do it quickly. You are anointed now. &gt;&gt; YOU RECEIVE YOUR BAPTISM. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND DO IT QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He then having received the water, &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; did what? &gt;&gt; Went immediately out. &gt;&gt; And he WAS WHAT? &gt;&gt; NINE. &gt;&gt; SO JUDAH LEFT. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DISCIPLE WAS REMAINING? &gt;&gt; 11. 11 REMAINING. WHEN JUDAH [screaming] LEFT, &gt;&gt; JESUS CHANGED THE LANGUAGE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN JUDAH LEFT, WE ARE NOW IN JOHN 15. THIS IS WHEN JESUS SAY, "I LOVE [screaming] YOU." &gt;&gt; IT'S A DIFFERENT CHOOSING. I HAVE CHOSEN YOU. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUDAH IS ALREADY GONE &gt;&gt; TO BRING FAR FRUIT. &gt;&gt; JUDAH COULD NOT BRING THAT FRUIT. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WAITED &gt;&gt; AND CREATED A SCENARIO TO PULL JUDAH OUT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; PUT YOUR SEAT BELT. I'M GOING TO DROP SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO DROP A ROCKET. &gt;&gt; JUDAH WAS PART OF THE MINISTRY OF JESUS. HE WAS PREACHING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE WAS PREACHING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE ALL OF YOU. &gt;&gt; All of you are my preacher. &gt;&gt; There's no problem." &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS KNEW THAT SOME OF THEM WILL LEAVE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; SO THERE WERE CERTAIN MESSAGES JESUS COULD NOT DELIVER AS LONG AS JUDAH IS STILL AROUND. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JUDAH LEFT, &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN JUDAH LEAVE THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS CHANGED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT ALL OF THEM THAT REMAIN &gt;&gt; ARE THE TRUE SEED. &gt;&gt; THEN JUDAH THEN JESUS OPEN UP AND SAY, "HEY, I HAVE A MYSTERY. ALL OF YOU, YOU WERE CHOSEN &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED. TO BRING FORTH FRUIT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE, ALL OF THEM MADE IT TO PENTECOST &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JUDAH. &gt;&gt; SO THIS CHOOSING WAS NOT FOR JUDAH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE CHOOSING OF THE ELECT. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. AMEN. AND JESUS SAY, I HAVE CHOSEN YOU TO BRING FORTH WHAT? FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT YOUR FRUIT WILL DO WHAT? REMAIN. &gt;&gt; SO YOUR FRUIT DOESN'T GET DAMAGED. &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT THAT YOU WILL BRING &gt;&gt; IS ETERNAL. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD PLANTED IN YOU, &gt;&gt; WHENEVER IT'S GOING TO COME OUT, it will never be destroyed. &gt;&gt; You will TAKE IT THROUGH ETERNITY. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD WILL REVEAL THE TRUE YOU &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUE YOU THAT WILL BE REVEALED IS THE ONE THAT WILL LIVE ETERNALLY. &gt;&gt; I hope we are togetherh &gt;&gt; and YOU WILL AND AND THE BIBLE SAYS HERE HE SAID YOU SHOULD BRING FRUIT THAT YOUR FRUIT SINGULAR &gt;&gt; SHOULD DO WHAT REMAIN &gt;&gt; AND THAT WHATSOEVER [screaming] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO JUDAH. HE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO JUDAH &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUDAH WILL BEGIN TO CREATE. &gt;&gt; He can't GIVE IT TO JUDAH. &gt;&gt; ONLY A CERTAIN TYPE OF PEOPLE &gt;&gt; THAT WHATSOEVER THEY ASK. &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER THEY ASK WHAT? &gt;&gt; MY FATHER &gt;&gt; in what? &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME, &gt;&gt; HE MAY DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; GIVE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU NOTICE THAT FRUIT IS SINGULAR. &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN THE ANOINTED ONE AND THE END TIME HE SAY WHAT IS THE FRUIT? &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; The word. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You cannot leave this message &gt;&gt; if the message was not in you. The reason why you leaving the message, the message was already new. What came to you came only to open the package. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST THAT come to you is coming to crank THE CAR. &gt;&gt; THE CAR IS in you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said FRUIT FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF FRUIT. THE FRUIT of the season. WHAT IS IT? THE WHAT? &gt;&gt; TEACHING. &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT? THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; WHAT TIME IT IS? MEN'S DOCTRINE, DENOMINATIONAL or what? &gt;&gt; God's word for the season. &gt;&gt; IN EPHESIANS 2:10, THE BIBLE SAY, "FOR WE ARE WHAT?" &gt;&gt; HIS WORKMANSHIP &gt;&gt; CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS UNTO WHAT? &gt;&gt; GOOD WORKS. &gt;&gt; SO THEY created you for what? &gt;&gt; Good works. &gt;&gt; What do you have to fabricate? Because works is the expression of faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is [laughter] works is faith expressed. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I HAVE PREDESTINATED YOU UNTO GOOD WORK WHICH GOD [screaming] HAS WHAT &gt;&gt; before ordained." &gt;&gt; SO EVEN YOUR GOOD WORK WERE ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. A robot cannot produce anything else but the program that was put in a robot. &gt;&gt; You won't produce anything else but what God put in you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T HELP IT BUT TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T HELP IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE IN THE MESSAGE. NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING, YOU FEEL LIKE WHERE SHOULD I GO? I CAN JUST I CAN'T GO. NO, I HAVE TO JUST REMAIN IN THE MESSAGE BECAUSE YOU WERE PROGRAMMED MANUFACTURED FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. [applause and cheering] [screaming] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY TIME IS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want to begin the parable. &gt;&gt; So you want to do it next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You needed to understand this part &gt;&gt; before we get in the parable. &gt;&gt; The parable of the 10 pound. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I have a friend. I have a friend. &gt;&gt; Why do you do me like this? Just come up with one answer. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm already past 9 minute. So if I start right now 2:00 because we need to understand why is that face of Moses block &gt;&gt; and what does he have to do with this parable. &gt;&gt; Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Now the amen are going. [laughter] Are we together? If I spill right now, if I open up right now, you will feel, you will spill the food &gt;&gt; because what is coming up is a different category. But God wanted you to understand that you a special type of people. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why he say of all the father has given me, &gt;&gt; I have lost what? &gt;&gt; Except except Judas. &gt;&gt; Because in the parable you will see one of them is wicked. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; One of them will be a wicked. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT strange to have wicked in the message. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I have to close because you pulling again. Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT STRANGE BECAUSE WE GOT TO GROW UP NOW &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A DISASTER. OH, did you know, brother? UHHUH. [screaming] A TRUE MESSAGE OF GOD HAS TWO GROUPS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY REVIVAL BRINGS TWINS. BUT WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO THE HARVEST, &gt;&gt; WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO THE TIME OF THE GOING, &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY MUST SHOW THEIR COLOR. &gt;&gt; THE WHEAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT &gt;&gt; SO THE CHILDREN OF GOD CAN BEGIN TO GROW CORRECTLY. &gt;&gt; Are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE LIVING THE MESSAGE, YOU NEED TO EVEN PRAISE GOD. YOU SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD. WE ARE IN THE TRUTH." [cheering] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT STRONG. &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT STRONG. &gt;&gt; WHO OF THE DISCIPLE was praying for Judah? &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord Jesus Christ, we pray, please restore Judah, our brother." &gt;&gt; Oh, are we together? We will pray for our loved one. I know that because some of you are shaking already. I know that. BUT IF A MAN BEGIN TO BLASPHE AGAINST THIS MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT SEED IS IT. &gt;&gt; AN ELECT BLASPHEM THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STRUGGLE AND BACKSLID, BUT IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, YOUR MOUTH WILL BE SHUT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? SO THE PROBLEM IS KNOWING WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ORDAINED [screaming] BY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO PRODUCE FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WON'T VINDICATE BROTHER BRANAM THAT HE IS A TRUE PROPHET. YOU ARE THE ONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM CAME FOR YOU.

So for God to talk to you, &gt;&gt; he chose the greatest of all the prophets &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; FROM ENOCH [screaming] ALL THE WAY. HE CHOSE THE GREATEST ONE TO TALK TO YOU. IF A GREATER ONE IS NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU, WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU? [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A SON OF THE KING. AMEN.
