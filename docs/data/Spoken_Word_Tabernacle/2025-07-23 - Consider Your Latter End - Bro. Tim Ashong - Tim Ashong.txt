And uh last weekend uh I was in DC uh brother Mike was and uh they also sent greetings and uh so we are happy to be here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's read a portion of the scriptures and uh just to encourage ourselves. &gt;&gt; So we read from first from Genesis. &gt;&gt; Let's read from Genesis and just to encourage ourselves 26 I think. Genesis 26. Read some few lines from Genesis 26. Um, let's read from verse 27. Genesis 26. Sorry, 25. Genesis 25 verse 27. And the boys grew. And Esau was a canning hunter, &gt;&gt; a man of the field, &gt;&gt; and Jacob was a plain man, &gt;&gt; dwelling in tents. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison. But Rebecca loved Jacob. And Jacob sowed pottage. And Esau came from the field, and he was faint. And said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray thee with that same bread pottage, for I am faint." Therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy birthright." And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the point of death. And what prophet shall this birthright do to me? &gt;&gt; Okay, just wait. And Jacob said, &gt;&gt; swear to me this day, and they swear unto him, and he sold his birthight unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and porridge of lintters and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. Thou Isel despised birth right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read another scripture from the book of Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews 12, let's read from verse 14. Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. &gt;&gt; Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled, &gt;&gt; lest there be any fornicator or profane person as is who for one mush of meat sold his birthight. For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessings, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. &gt;&gt; Let's read the last scripture from Deuteronomy 32. I know we love to read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Deuteronomy 32, read a verse from there. Praise the Lord. Let's read verse 29. Oh, that they were wise. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That they understood this. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That they would consider their latter end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Shall we please be seated? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about it. God speaking through the prophet. Oh, that they would have considered that they would consider the latter end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 8, it said, "Better is the end &gt;&gt; of a thing." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Than the beginning thereof. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Better is the end of a thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, my God. &gt;&gt; Than the beginning thereof. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible tells us again that if they were wise, oh that they were wise, &gt;&gt; they would consider their latter end. &gt;&gt; So this evening we pray God to help us &gt;&gt; to be wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the wise will consider the latter end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; For the end of a thing is better &gt;&gt; than the beginning. That's it. That's why the scripture tells us &gt;&gt; those that will endure to the end, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; they shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to start, but what good will it do if you don't end it? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the Bible tells us the end of a thing is better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have started, let's ask grace to end it. and end it where? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are in a race. &gt;&gt; We are in a race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many start the race, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But not many, not all comes to the end of it. No. &gt;&gt; So, Apostle Paul spoke and he said, "But we &gt;&gt; we are not of them that turn back." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are of them that believe &gt;&gt; to the end &gt;&gt; to the saving of the soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise, &gt;&gt; they would consider the latter end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I pray tonight that all of us will be wise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that whatever you are doing today &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; think about the end. &gt;&gt; That's amen. &gt;&gt; Consider the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the end is better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever we are doing &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we are being admonished again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus gave a parable. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he told us in a parable, this is how I will put these people. He said, he gave the parable of the builders, two people that build a house. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; He said, those that will hear my word, I will liken them. &gt;&gt; Those that will hear my word, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; And they will do what I say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Will be likened unto a wise man. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Oh, that they were wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; To consider the end. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So, he also told us in another parable. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You must count the cost. &gt;&gt; If you are even going to war, &gt;&gt; if you are going to fight, &gt;&gt; whatever you are going to do, if you are going to build a house &gt;&gt; is whatever you are doing, say you have to count the cost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're going to meet an army, say kind of that this army that I'm going to fight, if you're going to fight Israel, you must think way. &gt;&gt; If you start war with Israel, make sure you'll be able to finish it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, listen. The God of Israel is alive today. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel is fighting today. &gt;&gt; Listen. Do you know that this recent war they fought 12 days what? You know what the Iranians are saying? They said Israel use oultic power. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not a is the power of God. &gt;&gt; So they knew there was something supernatural, &gt;&gt; something beyond man, &gt;&gt; something beyond human. &gt;&gt; And today it is aotic. &gt;&gt; But to us it is the power of God. It is the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; It is the God of Abraham that is fighting, that is standing behind the word. &gt;&gt; Because ever since they've been in Palestine, the God of Abraham has been fighting. &gt;&gt; But the people are blinded. &gt;&gt; So they cannot see it. They can't see that this is the small people. But oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. God is alive. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is alive. &gt;&gt; The God we are serving today. &gt;&gt; Is the God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Is the God of Abraham &gt;&gt; is the God of Moses. &gt;&gt; Is the God of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Is the God of Will and Branham. &gt;&gt; He is our God today. is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So don't fear, &gt;&gt; fear no little frog. &gt;&gt; It is our father's good will &gt;&gt; to give us a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Our God will fight for us. &gt;&gt; Our God will protect us. &gt;&gt; Our God will defend us. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Somebody give a clap of it to Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory, Lord. &gt;&gt; I will like him unto a wise man. &gt;&gt; The one that hears my word &gt;&gt; and does the thing that I say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not what you feel. &gt;&gt; Not what you think. Not what anybody says, not anybody ideas, but the thing that I say. &gt;&gt; Amen. The thing that is say might not be know nice to your ears. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

And the only way that you must get the revelation &gt;&gt; to know who is speaking &gt;&gt; to know who he is &gt;&gt; for he that cometh to God must believe &gt;&gt; that he is and the rewarder of those that diligently seek him &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May God help us church of the living God. &gt;&gt; So that we will not just hear God's word &gt;&gt; but hear it and do it. &gt;&gt; Apply it into your life.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get annoyed with me. &gt;&gt; For even if you get annoyed with me, &gt;&gt; I will do what he wants me to do before I leave here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I will like him." &gt;&gt; That's right. or her &gt;&gt; like a wise man &gt;&gt; that built his house upon the rock. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And the flood came &gt;&gt; and the wind blow &gt;&gt; and there was storm and there was this and that." He said, "But that house stood firm &gt;&gt; because it was built upon the rock." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that hears my word &gt;&gt; and does not do what I say, &gt;&gt; I I I Jesus I the Lord &gt;&gt; will liken that fellow to a foolish man. &gt;&gt; So as we are here, we are all builders. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; We are all builders. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; While we are we all builders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are building. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. How are you building? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my word, and that was the thing that I say, I will liken him &gt;&gt; unto a wise man &gt;&gt; who build his house. So as we hear the word of God here this evening, as we have been coming hearing the word, we are liking &gt;&gt; unto builders. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. So you have to be one of them. One of the wise or one of the foolish. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's nice to come to church to hear wonderful sermon. &gt;&gt; Oh, good preaching. Yeah, praise the Lord. But what do you do with a wonderful sermon? &gt;&gt; But what do you do with a good preaching? &gt;&gt; Oh, the service was wonderful. Praise the Lord. What did you do with a wonderful service? [Music] Because there are many sympathizers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That sympathize with the message. Oh, it's wonderful. Is this and that and that and that. Wonderful. But what are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you a wise? Are you liking to a wise builder &gt;&gt; or a foolish builder? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are told by William Brana, the prophet of God for the age, the foundation of everything is very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your building is going to stand, it depends on your foundation. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said one build upon the sand and one build upon the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the problem was the foundation. &gt;&gt; One built upon the rock, one built upon the sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; So how are you building? &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; because you cannot stop the rains, &gt;&gt; the storm, the wind, the trials, the difficulties in life. You cannot stop it. They will come. They came upon the wise building, &gt;&gt; the wise man's building, and the foolish man's building. &gt;&gt; Both of them. &gt;&gt; Both of them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Both of them. &gt;&gt; Both of them. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; But what made one to stand was foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody didn't want to pay the price. Somebody didn't want to pay the price &gt;&gt; to dig and lay this good foundation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You You got to dig. &gt;&gt; You got to dig, &gt;&gt; dig and get to the rock, &gt;&gt; that rock of revelation &gt;&gt; to know who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; We are not asked to understand. We asked to believe it. [Applause] That's why he said to the disciples, "Will you also go?" Because he said something that somebody didn't understand it or didn't understood. He said, "If you eat a sec, you eat my friends and drink my blood, you have no pardon me." &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say he didn't explain it. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he didn't explain it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was it a wrong statement? &gt;&gt; Was it a false statement? &gt;&gt; He knew what he was saying. Thank God brother said I know where I'm standing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said when I say I'm the voice of God to you. He said there is some resentment. &gt;&gt; He said but I am. &gt;&gt; I know where I am standing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody want some explanation said note. We are not asked to be explained anything explained to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't explain to Isaiah when he say a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; He did prophesy. &gt;&gt; The prophet if they've as if the people they if they had Isaiah question what do you mean? He said what did I say? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; How do you explain it? I don't know. &gt;&gt; No explanation. &gt;&gt; That's what the spirit said. &gt;&gt; Let him hear what the spirit is saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hey, which of the builders are you today? &gt;&gt; Glory Lord. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; May help you help us to be wise &gt;&gt; builders. Amen. &gt;&gt; Once again, we have heard it many times, but we are being reminded &gt;&gt; that listen the importance of revelation &gt;&gt; to the true believer. &gt;&gt; The importance of revelation by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; To the true believer can never be overemphasized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can never be overemphasized. So we cannot stop talking about revelation here. &gt;&gt; No sir. The importance of it. &gt;&gt; It makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he made a difference in the garden of Eden &gt;&gt; between Cain and Abe. &gt;&gt; There was a difference. &gt;&gt; A by revelation &gt;&gt; offered unto God. A more excellent sacrifice, &gt;&gt; a more excellent. So somebody had excellent. &gt;&gt; And when you go to school, you have excellent, but somebody have more excellent. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So you can worship beautifully but it must be by revelation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; I went somewhere and they were sharing say some people even went to church and there was sisters say amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody said we cannot sit down for them to say amen. We cannot say amen. So there was even competition in saying amen. &gt;&gt; When he says amen, I cannot just sit down. Why? &gt;&gt; That's kind of revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation. They just competing say amen. &gt;&gt; This amen. &gt;&gt; Because somebody say amen. Oh no. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not against your amen. But why are you saying amen? &gt;&gt; What prompt your amen? &gt;&gt; What makes you shout? &gt;&gt; What makes you sing? &gt;&gt; What makes you dance? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It might be by revelation. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; May God help us church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that heareth my word and that was in that I say, I will liken him. Jesus said, I will liken to a wise man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That build his house upon the rock. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the wind came &gt;&gt; and the storm came and the rain came and beat upon it &gt;&gt; and it stood still. &gt;&gt; Listen. Life has a lot of challenges. &gt;&gt; Christians has a lot of challenges. &gt;&gt; What in the Bible tells many are the afflictions &gt;&gt; of the righteous &gt;&gt; but the Lord delivers him from all. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says sometimes when we become Christians we have more troubles &gt;&gt; that when we were not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So somebody say if you're a Christian why all these troubles &gt;&gt; why this trials &gt;&gt; yes because I I am a Christian &gt;&gt; and because you a Christian &gt;&gt; and God allows you to be tested [Applause] &gt;&gt; listen the father we believe the truth we have the truth we have the word of God does not exempt us from trials &gt;&gt; because Jesus said the winds will blow the water will come the rains the flood We come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And beat upon the house. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The storms will come. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes listening. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Do you know that storms sometime when they come is not only to destroy things. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it clears your path for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sometime the storm come to clear the &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look. Hey. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean in one of the wars of Israel, &gt;&gt; their enemies laid a lot of land mines. &gt;&gt; And so when they got to that spot, &gt;&gt; man, what are we going to do? So they thought of destroy the captain said, "No, we got to remove them." But there were thousands. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And you know what? the supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Right at that time, &gt;&gt; there came a mighty wind storm &gt;&gt; and blew heavy wind, heavy storms. You know what they did? It exposed all the land minds. &gt;&gt; And the Israelite they just walk over it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So sometimes storm comes on your way, &gt;&gt; trials comes on your way, &gt;&gt; challenges come on your way. to clear your part of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, have faith in God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Listen, have faith in God. Tomorrow I told pastor, I'm going to see the doctor to review. I said, but it is way. &gt;&gt; I don't care what anything we say. It is where. Amen. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing is moving me because I've seen the hand of Jehovah God. So nothing will move me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like I always say here you see me standing here is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pastor was there and some of you were there when I was coming with &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; which here I coming with a walker. &gt;&gt; Yes.

Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Sometime I was talking to somebody I said listen &gt;&gt; you know I said brother do you know your trial &gt;&gt; when you have to try &gt;&gt; your trial is your testimony oh &gt;&gt; your trial is your testimony &gt;&gt; without trial you don't have a testimony [Applause] When you read Job, when you read Abraham, what is is a trial? &gt;&gt; But that is their testimonies. &gt;&gt; All the Bible that we read about is the testimonies of our brothers. &gt;&gt; They are testim they stood on the word. They had trials. They have challenges. They have disappointments. But that is their testimonies. And your own trial is your testimony. &gt;&gt; Oh, my child did this. My son did this. My daughter did this. My neighbors don't like me. They did. That's your testimony. &gt;&gt; The trials. When you go through your trials, it becomes your testimony. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And the prophet of God said, "The more loyal you are, the more the test." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; People don't want to hear the prophecy, but &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that said, &gt;&gt; "I will tell you the prophet said." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you have a trial, you find favor with God." He said if you have a trial &gt;&gt; that mean God has confidence in you. &gt;&gt; And he said God knows &gt;&gt; God knows that you will stand a trial. &gt;&gt; God believe in you. &gt;&gt; That's why he bring trial. &gt;&gt; He has confidence in you &gt;&gt; as he had confidence in Job. &gt;&gt; So God has confidence in me &gt;&gt; and God has confidence in you. And God has confidence in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hey, you can call me crazy. I don't mind. &gt;&gt; That is you calling me crazy. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know that &gt;&gt; the way people call heresy, &gt;&gt; that is the way we worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, we are not giving letters here.

Whatever you sow is what you reap. &gt;&gt; Oh, if they were wise, &gt;&gt; oh that they were wise, &gt;&gt; you will consider your latter end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, &gt;&gt; don't play church. &gt;&gt; Brother, don't play church. &gt;&gt; Don't just come and go. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Make a choice. &gt;&gt; Lord, [Applause] &gt;&gt; make a choice.

Make up your mind &gt;&gt; since you have been coming. Have you not seen what we are doing here? &gt;&gt; Have you not seen it? &gt;&gt; Have you not seen you want to see what we are? Yes, this is what we are doing. We come here to preach. &gt;&gt; We preach the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; We are messages of followers of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That brings us back to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; So since you have been coming, &gt;&gt; some of you were born in this message. &gt;&gt; Your mama and papa they born you here. &gt;&gt; When are you going to make up your mind? When are you going to decide? When are you going to make a choice? What are you waiting for? What do you want to see? What do you want to hear? When the Bible says today, when you hear his voice, harden not your heart. What you can do today, don't push it to tomorrow. [Music] [Applause] All that they were wise, &gt;&gt; they would have considered a later end. &gt;&gt; Think about the end. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will do it tomorrow. Say it's not tomorrow. It's now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I will get the Holy Ghost on time. No, no, no, no. It's now.

Oh my goodness, sometimes sad &gt;&gt; for husbands and wife to be having challenges and fighting and force when this pastor here teaches so much on Ruth on this and that and that and Jennis here and there and you are still in this condition. &gt;&gt; You are still in this condition. After hearing all these preachings, &gt;&gt; all these teachings, &gt;&gt; you are in this condition. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us church. &gt;&gt; Hey God, &gt;&gt; which of the two beers are you? &gt;&gt; Or you want an angel to come and stand here? &gt;&gt; If an angel come, will you be able to stand? If an angel of God come and stand here, can you sit down? &gt;&gt; Will you be able to hear anything? If an angel come down, &gt;&gt; God uses man. &gt;&gt; Men are God's agent. &gt;&gt; God choose to use man. Brother say he could have choose the sun. He could have choose the moon. He could have choose the wind. But he choose man. &gt;&gt; Man is God's agent. So if you want an angel to come and preach, you will not get an angel to come. God's angel. We are the angels. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are wise, you will consider that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I will not try to take much of your time.

Very good boy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he didn't get the revelation of the birthright. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; You talk about good works. My my my &gt;&gt; you talk about good ways. &gt;&gt; Who was Jacob? Nowhere. &gt;&gt; Jacob was nowhere. &gt;&gt; Follow my mind everywhere. Listen. But there was something he was looking for. &gt;&gt; Right from birth. &gt;&gt; Right from the mother's womb. &gt;&gt; He got the revelation of that birth.

[Music] &gt;&gt; When I get it, I will get everything. &gt;&gt; And when you get the birthright, you get everything. When you get the Holy Ghost, you get everything. [Applause] &gt;&gt; For if the spirit of him that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, he that raised Christ from the dead will quicken your mortal bodies and sin and corruption and adultery and lying and cheating and unbelief.

Why are you suffering? &gt;&gt; If you are the son of God, command the stones &gt;&gt; to become bread. He was hungry. The Bible said he was hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he did not just speak &gt;&gt; or just do it. No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; He said, "Man shall not live by bread alone. But by every word I proceed out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; And Satan said, "Look, if you follow, you worship me, I'll give all things to you." &gt;&gt; Get it behind me. &gt;&gt; What shall he profit a man if he get the whole word loses? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; What will it profit us? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Be careful of what you say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Said, "Hey, let it be on me." Why? She knew what God said. &gt;&gt; The elder shall serve the younger. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because when she was pregnant, she was praying. She was praying. God said, "There are two nations &gt;&gt; in your womb." &gt;&gt; And the elder shall save the younger. &gt;&gt; God told her that &gt;&gt; that revelation has been with her. That's right. &gt;&gt; She kept it in her heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And she knew where the blessing is. &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, listen.

No. The people that did that and that were converted to Christ, if you ask them, they would tell you, "We don't want to go back to them. We don't want to go back to them." There is a reason why they telling you, "We don't want to go back to them." &gt;&gt; And the devil keep telling you, "No, you missing something." Watch the definition of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the definition of pleasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Consider the end. &gt;&gt; Consider where you heading. Amen. And you would know what the Lord want you to do. This quote has been held for a while and suddenly he popped it up. Whatever you do the decision you are here the decision you made. I have all those things and it keep hell. So I found out the signal came tonight like okay now it's time to dive into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever you do right now watch your tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be impossible for somebody to see you doing wrong and they don't want to tell you. &gt;&gt; If you find out, &gt;&gt; stay away from that person. &gt;&gt; Get away from that person. That's a person that will kill you. &gt;&gt; If you find somebody who is unable to tell you the truth and want to compromise to please you, that's not a friend. &gt;&gt; That's a killer rad. &gt;&gt; That's not a friend. The way the world is describing, he say, "Okay, this is my body. I got your back." No, the one that really got your back is the one that would look at you straight to the face and say, "We can part, we can separate, we can end our fellowship, but I'm going to tell you what you're trying to do is wrong. &gt;&gt; That is the true friend. &gt;&gt; That is a true husband. &gt;&gt; That is a true wife. That is a true mother and father. &gt;&gt; That is a true a true a true body. That's the one that you want to stick with. Amen. But somebody who let you do everything. [Applause] If you come to me, I'm going to let you go home and you look at and you say, "I'm coming to a dentist and I look at your teeth and I see infection and to please you." I say, "No, I went to Dr. So and so and they say this, this, this." and I say okay everything looking good and you say well are you the best doctor ever it's just a matter of time after five or 6 month if your face begin to swell &gt;&gt; what are you going to call me you call me a witch or a crook or whatever whatever you going to come up and and you ready to put a bad review quickly why because I failed to tell you the truth truth, but we were trained to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; So regardless of whether it's going to please you or not, I must make sure when I go home, even if you go, I have somebody 10 years left. 10 years if I'm not mistaken, and went away. Just told the person, you need to do this, this, this, this, this, this, and say it's going to cost you, I don't know if it was at that time. It was like $5,000. The person said no. Ran away, disappeared. No problem. The person came after seven or 10 years. Total loss to my friend after spending the maybe the double of what I was trying to do. They went they did. I was not even trying to do they did and she paid for it and she came back and I look I said look what I told you look where you are and she have to pay again more than even what I said. And she was ready to pay for it now. How much money did she spend over there and coming back and spending back? I have her picture before and after. She said, "Now I look at she said never." She she saw no more. How much damage? Why? I didn't know that person will come back. But because I said what was right after years comes right back again with a lot of damage. Amen. We have to tell you what the message say and what the Bible says regardless because at the end this message has been vindicated. &gt;&gt; The Bible is always been vindicated. Make your choice based on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Stick with the word no matter how hard it is. &gt;&gt; That is the way life is. At the end, God will back you up. God will be there for you. God will stand for you. And God will give you the best and you will be an example to other young people all over this world here to say the children the young people we saw there we saw them when we were laughing at them when we were telling them you guys are all the way in the word the word every time we want to talk it's just brother Brandham say brother Brandham say but truly they are watching you when they begin to see things begin to go differently they say you know what we've been criticizing them too much but they got the real Amen. &gt;&gt; Stick with the word. God will vindicate you. I told brother set I say it's a matter of time and you will see what God will do to his people in this church right here. &gt;&gt; There's a time for everything. &gt;&gt; There's a time for training the time to go and there will be a time for blessing. And when God bless, don't tell him to stop [Laughter] &gt;&gt; because his cup when he pour the cup must overflow &gt;&gt; because that is the God of Abraham. But stand ready. God will meet you at the appointed time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tim. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, we thank you for your grace, for your love and your mercy, and for speaking to our soul tonight, Lord. Father, certainly there must be somebody struggling that have not taken decision or make a decision yet to where they are standing, Father. And the devil has been taking advantage of that ify position for years to trouble their life, Lord. But Lord, tonight you are speaking to us about the choices. And you want your children to make the right choice so that they can build their house on a solid foundation because one of this day trial will come, trouble will come, temptation will come and everything that we have been labor on will be tried where the world we were here and doers or we were just here and not doers of the word. But Lord Father, I pray Lord Father that a special grace be granted because your word came tonight Lord. He came to convict, to change and to bring grace to the one that is struggling, the one that is just about to stray away so that they can recover and come back in line. Lord, Father, may that grace touch and prick the heart of your children and bring them back again, Lord. Father to the point that they will consider the birthright which is everything Lord Father that we need in this life journey. Lord I pray that you strengthen brother Tim and you protect the church Lord. Father we are committing the building project unto our hand Lord. Father, we know that everything is under your provision and every single step of the way. We see you every single day working in a miraculous way and moving with us beyond even what we thought and the way we planned. But Lord, Father, at the end of the day, we consider the latter hand and we know that it's going to be good. Father, we pray Lord that you give us travel mercy as we going back to our respective place. May you keep us centered and consecrated around the revealed word of the hour. So that if Tom Terry and Lord Father before you come may we meet again and fellowship around the things of the kingdom. Bless your children Lord Father. Touch those that need a special touch tonight. Lord may you grant it unto them and bless us in Jesus precious name. Amen. Go ahead. I want God's will to be my way as a journey below for the resto. Though the highway that a child should go through the road is steep and rough. If he leads me enough, I want God's way to be my way every day. Oh, I want God's way to be my way as a journey below. For there is no highway that I shall [Music] go. Though the road is deep and rough, if it leads me, it's enough. I want God's way to be my way every day.
