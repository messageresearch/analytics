[1:01:02] Joseph and after Joseph you can tell the
[1:01:06] difference amen you can tell that no no
[1:01:09] no no no since Joseph came uh-huh since

[1:02:02] 1 verse
[1:02:05] 6 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:02:09] am you need to keep your Bible the Bible
[1:02:13] says and Joseph
[1:02:16] died and all his Brethren and all that
[1:02:20] generation
[1:02:22] died first they went to Egypt when they
[1:02:26] went to Egypt they were placed in a
[1:02:29] place called
[1:02:30] Goan right amen Amen brother Bram say he
[1:02:35] was the fruit of the
[1:02:39] land amen and brother Bram say it was
[1:02:43] the best place of Egypt and remember not
[1:02:48] even the plague were getting there
[1:02:51] that's right secure protected when Egypt
[1:02:55] is in darkness over there there is light
[1:02:57] amen right amen so Israel going to Egypt
[1:03:02] started at Goan with all
[1:03:07] privileges amen privileged people high
[1:03:11] class
[1:03:12] people amen everybody fear them because
[1:03:16] of Joseph we

[1:03:23] died amen amen and all Brethren and all
[1:03:27] that generation died amen amen and the
[1:03:31] children of Israel were
[1:03:35] fruitful and increased how
[1:03:38] abundantly and did what multiplied and
[1:03:42] works exceedingly what Mighty and the
[1:03:45] land was what filled with

[1:04:15] they had what possessions therein and
[1:04:17] they grew and they what multiplied
[1:04:19] exceedingly so if they give you
[1:04:22] something good

[1:04:30] give you advantages we need to see some
[1:04:33] result

[1:05:25] fruitful
[1:05:26] and increase abundantly and multiply and
[1:05:30] works exceeding Mighty and the land was

[1:41:48] Egypt what was their
[1:41:51] secret now when they say Israel was

[1:42:09] of all the

[1:42:15] blessing came and then he woke up in the
[1:42:17] morning and he found gold laying there
[1:42:20] and Solomon woke up he say ah the Lord

[1:42:25] sleeping overnight I woke up look at
[1:42:27] this gold now I'm the richest person how
[1:42:29] did Solomon with the blessing of the
[1:42:32] Lord how did he get where he
[1:42:36] got I'm still reading my Bible my friend
[1:42:39] amen am brother Bram says this glory to
[1:42:42] God when a gift is what given to the
[1:42:45] church and the church do what refuses to
[1:42:48] hear that gift then the gift will become
[1:42:51] of what of none effect but when the gift
[1:42:54] is given to what the church and the
[1:42:56] church do What receives it then it's a
[1:42:59] what a golden age for that
[1:43:05] church let me leave it alone you do you
[1:43:09] do the M yourself it become a golden age
[1:43:12] for what that church Israel was living
[1:43:16] in it what Golden Age under who Solomon
[1:43:23] and Solomon brother Robert isah was in
[1:43:27] the Golden
[1:43:29] Age
[1:43:30] amen what does he mean so you go outside
[1:43:34] you see Gold Everywhere Solomon gold the
[1:43:37] trees are in gold cars are in gold
[1:43:41] everything is in gold the Golden Age
[1:43:43] amen what El the Golden Age
[1:43:47] means glory to God brother Bram all
[1:43:50] Israel did what glorified God because of
[1:43:53] this marvelous what he was what
[1:43:56] perfectly operated and they could see
[1:43:58] the what results that he was not
[1:44:01] something that was just what a put on
[1:44:04] but it was what a real gift from God
[1:44:06] remember remember Joseph they got to see
[1:44:09] the result yes let me go with Solomon a
[1:44:12] little bit more brother Bram saying the
[1:44:14] queen of the South we come to who
[1:44:17] Solomon in the days of who Solomon and
[1:44:19] Bible reader knows that that was what
[1:44:22] the gold age of Israel that was the best
[1:44:26] days they ever
[1:44:31] had Solomon
[1:44:33] Reign Solomon Reign my friend was a
[1:44:37] golden age the best days of
[1:44:41] Israel
[1:44:43] amen H everybody want to look at this
[1:44:47] what are we seeing brother Bram say that
[1:44:50] was the what amateur millennial
[1:44:56] can you say Amen can you say Amen
[1:44:59] Solomon was
[1:45:02] am Millennium so when you get into
[1:45:05] Solomon way you almost like in a
[1:45:09] millennium what makes that
[1:45:13] Millennium how did they become a
[1:45:17] millennium God because David was not a
[1:45:20] millennium how did Solomon turn the
[1:45:23] Kingdom from David to an amature
[1:45:27] Millennium what was the secret of
[1:45:31] Solomon the Lord bless him
[1:45:37] how are we together are we
[1:45:43] together brother brandham say
[1:45:48] everything not
[1:45:50] something everything did what prospered
[1:45:54] under Solomon
[1:45:58] why when God does what gives a gift to a
[1:46:01] people or what a nation or what a people
[1:46:05] and those people will do what recognize
[1:46:08] that gift it is what a golden age for
[1:46:11] them in other word God gave Solomon the
[1:46:14] vision that's
[1:46:16] right and Solomon has to deliver the
[1:46:20] vision to the people and the people that
[1:46:25] respect
[1:46:27] listen pay attention receive and act
[1:46:32] upon the vision that Solomon delivered
[1:46:37] those people will see the result of
[1:46:40] Solomon because the anointing all when
[1:46:44] he comes upon the head of
[1:46:47] Aon he doesn't stop on the head the
[1:46:51] Bible say he goes where down to the
[1:46:53] beard down to the beard down to what all
[1:46:56] the way to the H of the
[1:46:58] Garment if you can receive that
[1:47:03] oil don't worry my friend brother Bram
[1:47:07] say if they turn it down it's a what
[1:47:10] chaos for them so when a gift come it's
[1:47:13] a trouble you don't receive it you're in
[1:47:16] trouble you receive it you bless amen
[1:47:19] that is the reason he kept saying a what
[1:47:23] greater than Solomon is here and they
[1:47:25] were turning it how down in other words
[1:47:27] Jesus was telling you do you know
[1:47:29] Solomon I am bigger than Solomon but
[1:47:32] they didn't understand what he was
[1:47:34] talking about they rejected he came to
[1:47:36] his own and his own receive him he goes
[1:47:40] to the Gentile now we got the seals
[1:47:43] open now the Gentile become the pride
[1:47:47] not the Jews the Jews remain
[1:47:50] servant Israel is servant but the church
[1:47:53] is the bride the 144,000 won't be the
[1:47:58] bride they will be your
[1:48:04] servant are we together are we together
[1:48:07] am are we together am look at Solomon my
[1:48:10] friend brother Bram he says in the days
[1:48:13] of Solomon Solomon's Reign any Minister
[1:48:16] knows that was what a golden age for
[1:48:19] Israel the what the greatest age
[1:48:24] the Golden Age the best days of Israel
[1:48:27] in amateur Millennium the greatest
[1:48:31] age amen what made the age greatest they
[1:48:35] built what the temple they had no war to
[1:48:40] a mon to anything and they
[1:48:42] had let me leave it alone am am do you
[1:48:46] see what war does to the
[1:48:49] economy let me leave it alone amen
[1:48:53] and they had the power of God among them
[1:48:56] and that gift was how so great till all
[1:48:59] the nation around about did What Fear
[1:49:01] them now we find out that when we come
[1:49:04] down to the next character which is who
[1:49:06] Solomon now all Bible readers know that
[1:49:09] the days of Solomon was what the Golden
[1:49:12] Age of Israel they Prosper more under
[1:49:15] who Solomon because they have there was
[1:49:18] hardly what any war and they built what
[1:49:21] the temple and he was a great golden
[1:49:24] time for Israel amen let's refocus our
[1:49:27] lenses a little bit and get into Solomon
[1:49:31] era we ready don't worry my friend glory
[1:49:36] to God in First Kings chapter 10 verse
[1:49:39] 21 and
[1:49:41] all King how many all King Solomon what
[1:49:46] drinking vessels where of what
[1:49:51] gold can iue
[1:49:53] and all the vessels of the House of the
[1:49:57] forest of Lebanon were what of pure
[1:50:02] gold all of them none were what
[1:50:07] silver you see the golden age he was
[1:50:11] nothing a counted in the days of what
[1:50:14] Solomon this man prospered so much until
[1:50:18] silver was nothing
[1:50:22] thing is
[1:50:24] go how did you get there Solomon what
[1:50:27] did you do to get
[1:50:30] there glory to God 2 Chronicle 1 ver1 15
[1:50:35] and the King made what silver and gold
[1:50:39] silver and gold and Jerusalem as ples as
[1:50:44] what
[1:50:46] Stones why did David didn't do
[1:50:51] it huh huh after Solomon anybody did
[1:50:55] this so we need to learn the secret of
[1:50:59] Solomon that when he Prosper silver and
[1:51:02] gold are like
[1:51:06] Stone what they left for my friend Oh
[1:51:10] Glory to God and the what cedar trees
[1:51:13] the expensive trees made he as a what
[1:51:16] the sycamore tree that are what in the
[1:51:19] veil for what abundance so whatever was
[1:51:21] big in the eyes of the people all over
[1:51:24] the world when you get to Israel it's
[1:51:29] common let me put it this way to make a
[1:51:32] sense okay in other words when you get
[1:51:34] to Israel everybody's driving a
[1:51:36] Mercedes that's so you don't know who's
[1:51:41] poor you don't know who's rich because V

[2:20:14] ruler no police officer but they know
[2:20:18] how to get you disciplined
[2:20:21] am when they say the anend you don't eat
[2:20:25] you thought they are structure the Bible
[2:20:27] say there is no ruler no overseer no
[2:20:31] supervisor so how do they leave they
[2:20:33] manage to live by
[2:20:36] discipline am amen amen am amen amen
[2:20:42] because if you don't know how to manage
[2:20:44] the little one even God himself won't
[2:20:47] promote
[2:20:48] you this is what brother I'm saying then
[2:20:52] when you go to doing something what good
[2:20:56] just like you was working for a bus
[2:20:59] Piper and you start out on the first of
[2:21:03] your job and you are what willing to
[2:21:06] take
[2:21:08] orders
[2:21:10] amen amen you are willing to do what
[2:21:13] take orders so giving a job is not
[2:21:16] enough the problem is willing to do what
[2:21:19] take orders then bus py has what
[2:21:23] confidence in you and he will keep what
[2:21:26] raising you up to a what a higher office
[2:21:29] all the
[2:21:31] time why you don't get a salary
[2:21:34] raiser
[2:21:36] on what happened knowing too much
[2:21:40] answering back to the
[2:21:43] supervisor
[2:21:44] am Amen brother brother this is the
[2:21:48] message of the hour this is the solution
[2:21:50] to our problem this is what God wants
[2:21:53] you to do so you can prosper so you can
[2:21:56] move from that house to a different
[2:22:00] house willing to follow
[2:22:04] orders and when the boss sees that they
[2:22:07] promote you to a higher position brother
[2:22:10] brandham say I believe that time has
[2:22:14] struck the brandham Tabernacle to know
[2:22:17] what to take the gift that God give us
[2:22:21] that God can trust us with something
[2:22:24] even what greater than what we have got
[2:22:27] you want God to give you something more
[2:22:29] than you got you want to move to the
[2:22:31] other learn how to manage what you have
[2:22:34] first then God will increase it because
[2:22:37] God hate
[2:22:39] wasting but we cannot go along and see a
[2:22:43] man that is always have to be tell have
[2:22:47] to be tell him and everything they have
[2:22:49] to talk to him everything every day and
[2:22:51] remember the spirit of what the prophet
[2:22:55] is subject to what the prophet what does
[2:22:57] he
[2:22:59] mean when you see a man that you have to
[2:23:03] do what correct or a what a woman and
[2:23:06] that person gets out of H and then you
[2:23:09] are telling him there what scriptural
[2:23:12] truth then it shows that the spirit that
[2:23:15] is on them is what isn't of
[2:23:19] God can I continue yes because the Bible
[2:23:23] say the spirit of what the prophets of
[2:23:26] prophesying that is testifying preaching
[2:23:29] speaking in tongues or whatever it is
[2:23:32] because tongues interpreted is what
[2:23:34] prophecy the spirit is so it is subject
[2:23:37] to what the prophet and the word is the
[2:23:40] prophet
[2:23:41] amen so when they say the spirit is
[2:23:44] subject to the prophet that Prophet
[2:23:46] means the word amen so your spirit must
[2:23:49] be under the word
[2:23:52] hallelujah so when they tell you
[2:23:54] something from the scripture you must
[2:23:56] humble yourself if you're the one
[2:23:59] spending money push the break get back
[2:24:01] in
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:06] line ambition is okay how do you handle
[2:24:09] your
[2:24:12] ambition amen the Bible say learn from
[2:24:16] an ant which have no guide overseer or
[2:24:21] but he provide her meat when in the
[2:24:23] summer and gather her food in the what
[2:24:29] Harvest let's go to
[2:24:33] Genesis I can't even
[2:24:35] move I'm still in the reading of the
[2:24:38] Bible let's go to Genesis
[2:24:40] 41 let me drop
[2:24:43] this and let me see if I can let you go
[2:24:48] home my time is almost gone
[2:24:51] I'm in a second scripture so help
[2:24:54] me amen amen amen amen Genesis 41 verse

[2:25:02] Amen this is a cleansing that's
[2:25:07] right so tomorrow when you prosper you
[2:25:10] will be the one

[2:25:31] years of famine you know this already
[2:25:33] and all the Plenty will be how forgotten
[2:25:36] in the land of Egypt and famine and the
[2:25:40] famine shall do what consume the land so
[2:25:42] what is coming is dangerous and it's
[2:25:45] going to destroy everything the vision
[2:25:48] is open so what do we
[2:25:52] do what do we do start
[2:25:56] panicking we got to find a
[2:26:00] solution God open up something he have
[2:26:03] to give us a
[2:26:05] solution he's just not a God to open the
[2:26:08] seals and then we stop there and we
[2:26:10] don't know what to do that's why we
[2:26:11] going through all of this we got to know
[2:26:13] what to do now now that the seals are
[2:26:16] open how do we invest our money yes
[2:26:18] siren how do we protect our money how do
[2:26:22] we spend our
[2:26:24] money until the Rapture comes amen amen
[2:26:29] now we know it's going to be danger it's
[2:26:31] going to be bad so
[2:26:35] what verse 31 and the Plenty shall not
[2:26:39] be known in the land by reason of famine
[2:26:42] following for it shall be how very
[2:26:45] Grievious everybody oh oh God so what
[2:26:49] are we going to do

[2:27:03] because the think is what established by
[2:27:06] God and God will shortly bring it to
[2:27:09] pass now
[2:27:12] solution therefore let
[2:27:15] Pharaoh look out a man how discreet no
[2:27:20] not any
[2:27:23] cand to hander this the solution against
[2:27:28] Bad
[2:27:30] circumstances in the
[2:27:34] future the solution against
[2:27:38] Calamity against trouble amen amen what
[2:27:43] is the solution against Calamity against
[2:27:46] trouble number one you must find
[2:27:49] somebody who's how
[2:27:52] discreet somebody who knows how to
[2:27:56] discern somebody who's
[2:27:59] prudent somebody who's
[2:28:03] careful that's what discret mean not
[2:28:07] anybody can solve this situation you
[2:28:10] must be prudent
[2:28:13] careful
[2:28:15] amen find somebody who is discret
[2:28:18] discreet come on and and what wise it
[2:28:21] require
[2:28:23] wisdom it require the
[2:28:27] Capstone it will car the
[2:28:30] cloud amen amen amen amen which is the
[2:28:34] opening of the word verse uh uh uh 33
[2:28:39] somebody who's discreet and how wise and
[2:28:42] set him over the land of what Egypt if
[2:28:46] you don't have somebody who's discreet
[2:28:49] and why you in
[2:28:51] trouble amen what is that person going
[2:28:55] to
[2:28:55] do God gave us all the principles in the
[2:28:58] Bible to know how to live in our homes
[2:29:01] brother pram says uh uh uh uh the Bible
[2:29:04] says let Pharaoh do this after you found
[2:29:07] that
[2:29:08] man let him appoint what officers over
[2:29:12] the land so the
[2:29:15] solution to the Grievous famine is the
[2:29:19] same solution Solomon used
[2:29:24] am you got to find people who are
[2:29:26] willing to
[2:29:28] work that's right am oh
[2:29:34] my found one the director two verse 34
[2:29:40] let Pharaoh do this let him appoint what
[2:29:43] officers over the land plural and take
[2:29:46] them what take up the fifth part of the
[2:29:48] land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
[2:29:51] years so there will be a l a
[2:29:54] levy of people that will be there in the
[2:29:58] land and that Levy is responsible to be
[2:30:01] pulling
[2:30:04] 20% amen so every that is coming up 20%
[2:30:10] goes to the saving how many percentage
[2:30:13] goes to your
[2:30:14] [Music]
[2:30:16] saving we in
[2:30:18] trouble amen we're in trouble how many
[2:30:20] percentage go to the saving negative
[2:30:26] saving that $5 they left it there so the
[2:30:29] bank don't charge you $5
[2:30:31] fee you know what I'm talking
[2:30:38] about amen amen verse 35 and let them
[2:30:42] gather what all the food of those good
[2:30:45] years that come and lay the corn under
[2:30:47] the hand of who of pharaoh and let them
[2:30:50] the food where in the city in other word
[2:30:52] when some people are enjoying the Plenty
[2:30:55] somebody his eyes is not on
[2:30:58] enjoyment somebody is his eyes his focus
[2:31:03] is not on enjoying yet it's about how
[2:31:06] can I glean and put things away because
[2:31:10] of the future and when Joseph begin to
[2:31:14] glean that money God stepping and begin
[2:31:18] to take the 20%
[2:31:20] and begin to multiply the
[2:31:23] 20% when Solomon begin to put people to
[2:31:26] work God step in and begin to take
[2:31:30] whatever you doing and begin to multiply
[2:31:34] it when Joseph begin to work God step in
[2:31:38] that work and begin to get that work and
[2:31:41] multiply it and py could tell that what
[2:31:44] is coming from Joseph is different than
[2:31:46] anybody who work it looks like there is
[2:31:49] something magical about this boy when I
[2:31:52] put him when he goes he comes with five
[2:31:55] this one goes he comes with two Joseph
[2:31:57] is always or above because God stepp in
[2:32:00] his work that's
[2:32:02] right are we together we almost I'm
[2:32:05] going to let you go my friend verse uh
[2:32:07] 36 and the
[2:32:09] food and that food shall be
[2:32:12] stored shall shall be foro to the land
[2:32:16] against what the seven years of family
[2:32:19] so somebody is working against something
[2:32:22] in other words there is a
[2:32:26] project and the project is set we know
[2:32:29] it's a project of seven years there is a
[2:32:32] goal and we working toward the goal so
[2:32:36] when the income is coming I'm teaching
[2:32:38] you all this principle my friend from
[2:32:40] the Bible and the message of the hour
[2:32:42] when the man is coming we not play this
[2:32:45] is not the time of playing it is the
[2:32:47] time to prepare to reach a goal young
[2:32:50] man you are in college you must have a
[2:32:54] goal if not you will sit in college 10
[2:32:57] years and you can't graduate when
[2:33:00] somebody goes 3 years and they graduate
[2:33:02] why are you staying longer because no
[2:33:04] goal no Focus they give you 40 classes
[2:33:08] you taking one class a semester one
[2:33:10] class a semester something is
[2:33:14] wrong can you say amen amen something is
[2:33:18] wrong but if you let go and you sit down
[2:33:21] and you say 40 I can divide it maybe six
[2:33:24] classes and then you take maybe 40
[2:33:27] divided by five he give you six you say
[2:33:29] you know what in two years I'll be done
[2:33:30] from this one then you are progressing
[2:33:33] with
[2:33:34] goals am that's
[2:33:38] true amen amen I'm entering even your
[2:33:42] schools everything my friend amen it's
[2:33:45] the message of the hour the Bible says
[2:33:48] against the seven years of Fe
[2:33:50] which shall be in the land that the land
[2:33:52] perish not through what the famine and
[2:33:54] the thing was good in the eyes of who
[2:33:57] pharaoh and in the in the eyes of who
[2:33:59] all his servant and Pharaoh said to his
[2:34:01] servant can we find such a one as this
[2:34:05] is a man in whom what the spirit of God
[2:34:08] is and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as
[2:34:12] much as what God has showed thee all
[2:34:14] this come on there is none so what
[2:34:17] discreet and what and wise as who thou
[2:34:20] are drop to verse 47 and in the seven
[2:34:24] plous
[2:34:26] year the Earth brought forth what by
[2:34:31] handfuls everybody is enjoying a good
[2:34:34] time economy is
[2:34:38] high amen amen everybody's buying houses
[2:34:43] Joseph is buying
[2:34:47] something remember at the end Joseph
[2:34:49] bought the
[2:34:50] people do you remember that he bought
[2:34:53] their Beast he even bought the land and
[2:34:56] bought everything so the one who was
[2:34:58] busy
[2:34:59] working and investing is the one who's
[2:35:02] going to dominate all of
[2:35:07] you so when you enjoying somebody's

[2:36:12] what without
