people whose attention has been called lord by a message that you have sent to us in this hour lord and your servants told us lord that the angel of the lord liked that song father god lord what it means to us father to realize lord things are constantly changing the times are changing the pressures the world the situations are changing but you are the unchanging god lord and we believe that the faith lord that we have lord in you tonight is not even our own but it's a faith you have given to us lord that is an unchanging faith lord lord and we'll remain anchored father god regardless of what changes around us lord i think when that song is sung how it must put the demons on alert how it must take the attention of satan to realize yet one more time he's going to be defeated he's going to be overcome lord he's going to be overthrown oh god because you have supplied your children with something lord that is invincible lord and you have given us a faith father god that cannot be defeated

present lord and those that are watching father god i pray that your faith our faith tonight would be quick and lord god to believe you lord to denounce every lying vanity every circumstance every symptom father god no matter lord how impossible the situation may look lord we realize with you all things are possible and we're looking to you tonight father god i pray that you'll take this vessel into your complete control lord may you guide every word that spoken lord jesus and may you minister to the hearts and to the souls lord god of your believing children we give you the thanks and the honor and the praise and we ask that you're granted in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you this evening i'll invite you to turn with me in your bibles to the book of micah chapter five and we just like to say it's a real privilege to be in service with you tonight and our brother called and just asked if we were able to come and minister and we agreed to and just really counted an honor to be here and just feeling in my heart the lord has something special tonight for each of us and we thank the lord for that we are so thankful for this work that god has ordained for your stand for the truth and our prayers have been with you uh knowing uh what a what an ordeal it has been but god is faithful amen i believe you're standing for the truth and i believe where god's children are standing on the truth he's standing with him amen so we thank the lord for that tonight and just counted an honor to be numbered with you i'll find our scripture reading tonight in micah chapter 5 verse number 2 but thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting amen i want to speak tonight on a chosen destination you can be seated tonight if you'd like to take your seats as we read these as we read this verse of scripture tonight we realize that bethlehem was a chosen place a place that god chose to make his entrance into the world amen it was an insignificant place it was a little place it was a place that otherwise would never uh capture the attention of the world or the uh be an attraction to the world but because it was a chosen place amen it has a great meaning to the world today amen it it was a little place it was an insignificant place until god made it the place of his choosing and the place his destination where where he chose to make his entrance into the world amen down through time we realized that god has used places to meet his children and to change the courses of their lives amen the bible says that god met jacob one night in a place where he journeyed and had laid his head to rest on a stone and there you know jacob just thought you know perhaps like so many people he was just wandering through life and wandering through this world and you know maybe felt like he was he was just being uh controlled by the circumstances that were around him by the strife by the pressures by the family situation by the economic situation and all the things you know maybe jacob just felt like you know i'm just drifting along with wherever the wind or wherever the currents take me but as he laid his head down that night to rest he had a dream and in the dream he saw angels ascending and descending upon a ladder and the lord god spoke to him and we we read this in genesis chapter 28 beginning at verse 10 the bible says and jacob went out from beer sheba and went toward haran and he lighted upon a certain place amen and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest oh my you're not just in any place you're not there by chance or by happenstance amen nothing random happens to a child of god amen everything that happens the bible says the steps of a good man are ordered of the lord amen the place where on the elias to thee will i give it and to thy seed amen in other words the promise that i gave to your father abraham is going to be realized in your life amen it wasn't just something for someone in the past amen god was wonderful to abraham god was wonderful to isaac but now he's coming to deal with jacob personally and to position him amen and to stimulate his faith to recognize his place in the great plan of god and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in my seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee oh my you're not wondering and you're not journeying alone amen you're not just a victim of the circumstances around you oh my but i am with thee and will keep thee amen it's no more possible for you to fail than it is for god to fail amen because god has joined himself to his children amen and he is taking personal responsibility for your welfare i will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to the of oh my i feel like running around this place tonight i will not leave thee until i have done all of that which i have spoken to the of i want to tell you brother sister we are part of a bride amen the bride of jesus christ amen we are like rebecca with an eleazar there are things that are spoken of you amen there are things that are prophesied of you there is a word that pertains to you tonight and i will not leave thee the lord god is speaking i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken of thee oh my friends we might as well realize tonight we might as well let our doubts dissolve we might as well let our fears and our anxieties be washed away tonight amen amen god doesn't start something to give up to give it up god doesn't begin something to abandon it along the way the bible says he that hath begun a good work in you will be faithful to perform it until the day of jesus christ amen we are as much a part of this as william branham was we are as much a part of this as the apostle paul was we are as much a part of this as every disciple as john the baptist amen as every character we read them in the scripture amen you too are an overcomer by the foreordination of the almighty god hallelujah amen i will not leave thee until i have done it's not even you doing it tonight it's god doing it until i have done hallelujah he's still working on me to make me what i ought to be amen until i have done that which i have spoken to the of and jacob awakened out of his sleep and said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not amen i just thought this was another stopover i thought this was just another pile of rocks i thought this was just another place amen another circumstance another child amen he says surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven amen so this place tonight it became hallowed because it marked the spot where god met jacob and began to reveal his promise to him and his will for jacob's life there were other places that were special there was a place called manoham spoken of in genesis 32 where the angels of god met him there was a place where he wrestled with the angel all night and received a blessing and a name change but bethel was a place and god said i'm going to bring you back to this place amen it doesn't have to be a one-time experience you can be brought back to that original experience you can be brought back to that original visitation amen you might say in your mind tonight oh you might remember how wonderful your fellowship with the lord and the communion with the lord used to be well i want to tell you that doesn't just have to be a memory but we're serving a god tonight who can bring you right back to that same place hallelujah where your youth can be renewed as the eagles and everything that god ever was he can be to you again in an even newer and greater and more powerful way hallelujah amen i want to tell you the christian journey doesn't start on the mountaintop and gradually diminish over the over the course of your journey amen it's not all mountaintops there are mountains and valleys and mountains and valleys and mountaintops amen but i want to tell you amen you don't go through a valley to stay in the valley when you're in the valley you're just changing mountaintops [Applause] you're just headed for another climax you're headed for another height amen and your relationship with the lord will be growing stronger amen will you get on that next mountaintop you might say i'm just as high now in altitude as i was on that mountaintop but because of the things i experienced in that valley and because god revealed himself to me the way he did in that valley my faith now hallelujah hallelujah i have muscles now i have strength now i trust god in a way now where i knitted in hallelujah when i was on that mountaintop i didn't know god the way i'm known now when i was on that mountaintop i still had some immaturity i still had some selfishness i still had a lack of trust or lack of confidence but now amen i'm stronger because of that valley amen there were other places but bethel was a place where he would one day return he would build an altar again and he would renew his dedication and his devotion to god sometimes i think it's good for us to revisit the places where god first met us i don't think you should ever forget that first great experience you had with the lord amen don't ever let that sit from your memory amen because it might be good for you to go back and visit that place and be renewed amen it's good to to remember where god first met us and we we laid aside our burdens and our weight of sin we started a new journey and enjoyed the newness of fellowship with him even sometimes we need to revisit the places where god's promise was revealed to us and we knew his will for our lives we tend to drift we tend to lose sight of what we once held true and we need to be taken back and reminded of his unchanging will i know that's something that encourages me you know you go through things and you think lord why am i here and why have i been here for all of this time amen but then you can go back a little farther and you realize how you even got there was the hand of the lord and i began to think lord how you provide it and lord how you open the door and lord how you just at the right moment just at the right time exactly what i needed and say lord i'm sorry i'm sorry i question i know i'm exactly where you would have me to be and this is only a stepping stone to another place amen a place where you are taking me oh my brother benham and we know in the scriptures the word of god talks about the outer court the holy place and the holiest of holies the prophet of god says into this holy place aaron went once a year the congregation watched him he was dressed right he had to be anointed right he had to walk right blessed be the lord dressed right walked right anointed right he had a bell and a pomegranate on his garment and as he walked they played holy holy holy and to the lord he taken before him a charge of blood the blood of the lamb the blood of the atonement and he was anointed with the rose of sharon an anointing run off his beard plum to the hymns of his skirt and he was walking into the inner veil into the presence of god amen it was a place it was an anointed place it was a divine place amen where once a year aaron would go to present the atonement and brother brown says and when he went behind there the veil fell behind him and he was shut out he was hid from the outer world oh my he was hid from the outer world in the old testament there was a yearly entrance by the high priest and to the holiest of holies where he would enter the veil leave the world behind to stand in the shekinah glory of god in the life giving presence of jehovah amen this was once an exclusive privilege to a sanctified high priest but calvary opened the way opened the way for every true believer washed in the blood of the lamb to enter into that same place you can now experience the same blessing that the high priest once experienced amen you don't have to read about what aaron experienced and say i wonder what that could be like oh no friend amen that privilege amen is not prohibited from the overcomer or from the true believer now but paul picks it up in hebrews chapter 10 and he says in verse 15 whereof the holy ghost it also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to save his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water amen this is for every son and daughter of god we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen oh if the devil is battling your mind tonight battling your body he's battling your conscience you've got this on your record you've got this in your past you've got this hanging on you amen you have a high priest which can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities amen take whatever that is amen and present it to the high priest lord i'm in need of healing lord i'm in need of deliverance lord i'm in need of a re-feeling and lord i'm in need of joy of peace amen whatever you need is confess it to your high priest amen and then go into the holiest of holies he said let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering don't give up now brother sister don't back up now hold fast the profession of your faith amen i believe god is coming back for people that are convinced god is coming back for people that are certain what he has done in this day in this hour amen and they're not wavering they're not wondering they're not questioning they're not backing up they're not apologizing they're not putting anything on the shelf amen hallelujah but they're standing on it let us hold past the profession of our faith without wavering for he has faithful that promise he is faithful that promise you didn't make the promise you're just standing on the promise and the reason you can be faithful is because you know he cannot be unfaithful he cannot say something and then retract he cannot retract his statement god doesn't change his mind about his word so we're standing amen on an unwavering word amen it's uncompromising it's unrelenting and it's unchanging amen he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to provoke and to love into good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching the prophet of god says this there is a hiding place abiding place that we can walk in the presence of god and be hid from the things of this world you don't hear them no more it's sound proof hallelujah sound proof the world is on the outside gasping and looking but you're on the inside in the presence of the eternal everlasting god eating from this manna eating from this manna that will last for spans of years hundreds of years it never contaminated neither did it give out i remember years ago being uh in in a certain church and under a ministry and they were making fun of the holy ghost they were blaspheming the holy ghost and they were saying the holy ghost is is like the manna that fell in israel and it grew still and grew wiggle tails overnight so it had to fall fresh every day and they said the holy ghost is something from an age gone by and it's grown stella and has wiggletales in it and i said but wait a minute that manna that was in the holiest of holies was different it was preserved for years for decades and for centuries why because it was in the holiest of holies and every high priest had the privilege of going in there every year and partaking of the same manner that moses and aaron and the grandfather and the father and this one and this one and this one hallelujah so if you think the man has grown still you're just eating it in the wrong place because when you get into the holiest of holies brother amen it's the same manner amen hallelujah hallelujah amen it doesn't get old it doesn't get old it doesn't lose its strength it doesn't lose its value but this is the same manner that peter and paul this is the same matter that the old uh the the original church this is the same manner that the martyrs ate this is the same manner that the prophet protocol amen the manna won't grow stale if you'll stay in the holiest divorce oh my it cannot grow still unless you leave the holiest of holiness amen and if you leave that presence all of a sudden the message won't be enough for you the bible won't be enough for you you'll be going for this man's idea and this man's interpretation and we're going out searching and we're going out searching why because you're not satisfied but as long as you stay in the holiest of holy everything you have need of and the true believer will be satisfied amen there's no criticism in the holiest of holies there's no internet in the holiest of holies there's no man's opinion and the holiest of holies there is god in god alone amen eating from this manner that will last for spans of years hundreds of years it never contaminated neither did it give out and man that walks into god and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of god eating the manna no wonder 12 o'clock nine o'clock late or anything he is living in the presence of the king amen no matter no wonder every day is fine for him he knows where he is at he has found the secret place he has went behind the veil the doors is closed behind him he don't see nothing of the world them doors was made soundproof by sheepskin and goatskin and this is made soundproof by the baptism of the holy spirit that hides a man in christ there he becomes a new creature and he walks daily before him in this manner what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of god all things are his dead oh my brother sister when the high priest went behind the holiest of holies he did not have to ask permission everything was available for his consumption for his protection he even put an old dead dried almond rod there that had been cut down stripped and for years had bore nothing but when that almond rod came into that presence of the shekinah glory it did the things it once did it branched forth and butted forth with the same life that it once did brother that's the difference amen when you get into god's presence amen you will experience the things you once did amen the life will come forth again amen there won't be some grafted affair it won't be something taped on or glued on or stuck on but it'll be something birthed forth from the inside amen because the life-giving presence of the shekinah glory amen has brought you back to original manifestation of the original life that was in you all the time that presence did not make that almond rod into some other nut or some other fruit but that presence vindicated what the original life was man you could have painted anything you could have put anything you could have put any identification on that almond rod you wanted to but when it got back in that presence it proved what it was by the life that it bore forth [Music] oh my friend that's what we need tonight that's what we need tonight church theology won't do that man's personality won't do that church systems won't do that but the shekinah glory can amen what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of god all things are his dead amen my friend when you when your faith is so stimulated you won't have to beg god for your healing you won't have to plead with god for your promises you recognize that's my promise that's my healing that's my inheritance amen joshua and caleb weren't fussing about what their portion in the promised land was they knew what their portion was amen and they were there to tell the canaanites you never owned this in the first place this was mine all along amen you've been a temporary inhabitant of something that i've got a deed to amend because god gave this to my father abraham i'm not here taking something from the devil that whatever was his i'm taking back what was mine all along [Laughter] this was mine all along how will you have faith for a glorified body because a prophet came to say a theophany was what you bypassed but it was yours all along amen the faith of the promise has come in this hour even to tell the sons and daughters of abraham what has been ours all along so we walk into it by faith claim it put your stand right there amen i'm not moving i'm not budging this is mine because god gave it to me amen i'm not backing up amen all things are his then all things was given to christ all that god was he poured into christ all christ was poured into the church that day you'll know that i am in the father and the father in me and i in you all the privilege that the believer has if they can only accept it i was some months ago i was flying on an airplane and in these uh commercial airlines they have in the seat back pocket a magazine that the the carrier whether it's delta or american or united they all have their own magazine and so i i pulled this magazine out and i was looking through it and i saw an article there that caught my attention it was written by one of the executives of the airline and the the the title of his of his uh editorial there the the article that he had written was from adot to a destination from a dot to a destination and he began to describe that his role as an executive for that airline was to go into a city or a town that they currently did not offer flights into or service into that area but he would begin looking around that city he looked at the you know the economy and and the maybe the restaurants and the hotels and the entertainment and and all of these of these different factors he would be taking these things into consideration and if everything looked like that would be a good future destination he would take his report back and eventually this little town that was once just a dot would become a destination of that airline and they would begin flying their customers into this city and those customers go and they stay in their hotels and they eat in their restaurants and they begin meeting business owners and they begin growing and developing the economy of that city why because one person saw worth and sold value in this little city oh my and i saw that in my mind begin thinking from a dot to a destination i was thinking about a little dot a little 16 year old girl by the name of mary who was walking to the well one day and she was just another little girl like every other teenager in her city amen just trying to serve the lord and be faithful amen hold true to god's word but god spoke to that little dot and said mary thou art highly favored among women you're not just any virgin you're not just any young girl amen you're not just here drifting along and floating along but you are the object of a promise there is a prophecy that is pertaining to your life and the purpose of the angel was there to connect her as an individual with god's promise oh my was there amen to to to begin to minister to her faith you've heard it preached you've heard it read you've heard it quoted you've heard it pondered you've heard it debated you've heard it argued but now you are going to experience and now it's not going to be just a story now it's not going to be just a mystery now it's not going to be just the words of a man or the words of a prophet but the angel came to connect her with that promise and say mary this is you you hallelujah you are the destination that god is going to kindly send from glory and wrap himself in a blood cell and an embryo and god is going to deposit a part of himself in you and the fullness of god will be burst forth from your womb oh my from a dot to a destination the prophet of god says this in the church ages books his outstanding statement he said he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her amen he manifesting his life his glory think about it every miracle every healing every dead child that was raised every great thing that he performed on this earth was possible because she accepted amen his word to her be it unto me according to thy word behold the headmate of the lord she didn't understand it any more than any other girl she didn't understand it any more than the priest or any other a religious leader but she became the recipient of it and she received the promise by faith and it birthed itself forth from her god made bethlehem a dot god made that little insignificant city a dot oh bethlehem though thou be little that's what qualifies you oh my because you've been overlooked because you've been passed over and then because others considered you to be ineligible or unworthy or incapable you were little oh among thousands amen there were many more deserving there was many more worthy there was many more capable and more qualified but there was only one that was chosen because you are chosen amen you will be given an age amen you will be given a reputation you will be given a standing immovable uh unforgettable amen god made that little city a dot amen oh if we if we just uh just bear with me for a moment as i go that and go over that again in the scripture in genesis uh chapter 10 there is jacob continued pardon me just a moment i have to find it amen i appreciate this wonderful pull tonight praise the lord oh my jacob rose up early in the morning verse 18 and took the stone that he put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it amen he said i'm going to make a memorial here i'm not going to let this slip i'm not going to let this pass these aren't ordinary stones any longer amen something happened here he took those stones and he he made an altar he set it up for a pillar and poured all upon the top of it verse 19 and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luds at the first but it got a new name it got a new identification you know who ever heard of luz who if i hadn't read that who would have ever heard of lust but we've all heard of bethel and we've all heard of bethlehem when god visits you it erases the old identity it erases the past that old man that a woman who ever heard of them who ever heard of him who ever heard of her amen i've got a new identity because of an experience that god gave to me amen and everyone has heard of the glory that took place in a place called bethel oh my he gave it a new name he gave it a new identification because he said the old one doesn't fit the old one doesn't worry amen that's going to be revealed through this one amen hallelujah jerusalem has the glory but it's not like bethlehem amen these other cities these other places have a glory but not like bethlehem because bethlehem is where it began at bethlehem is where there was a little stable and a manger and an innkeeper that couldn't make room in a regular room but there in a cave amongst the animals in a manger of hay bethlehem bethlehem was where god took his first breath as a human being glory to god hallelujah bethlehem is where the lamb slain before the foundation of the world made his entrance to buy back the earth and the sons and daughters of god that have been lost in the garden of eden eden will always be known for the fall that took place there but bethlehem glory to god [Music] amen hallelujah eden will be known for the sin that was committed there but bethlehem will be known as the place where the solution was born where the atonement was born where for the first time god jehovah took a breath and his voice cried forth like a little baby oh my i wonder if satan trembled when the little lord jesus cried his first cry i wonder if satan realized every time he opens his mouth is trouble every time he opens his mouth it's victory it's power it's resurrection it's healing it's life amen every breath he breathes every drop of blood that comes forth from his body every step he takes every direction he looks even when the sick touch the hem of his garments there will be a change there will be a transformation and bethlehem was the place that he chose and jacob bowed about saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house [Music] and of all that thou shalt give me will i surely give the tenth unto thee this vision this experience at bethlehem turned jacob into a permanent tithe fair and he said i'm not i'm not giving god what's mine i'm giving god back what was his all the time that's right you see brother sister when you have met god face to face serving god won't be a chore it won't be a drag it won't be a burden when you have really met god out of a willing heart amen with no coercion with no pulling with no persuasion amen he says i will surely give the tips unto thee rocks became a stone which became a pillar which he said will become god's house and i'm just thinking about another another disciple whose name was peter and he could not read he could not write he had he did not come from a family of wealth he did not come from some great illustrious uh you know dignitary or royalty or some blue blood pedigreed man he was a fisherman that was illiterate oh he was a dot oh my but one day jesus asked his disciples whom do men say that i am well jesus some say you're this some say you're john the baptist some say you're elias some say you're one of the prophets but then jesus brought the question more personal because jesus really is not interested in what everybody else he said who do you say that i am and a man that could never say anything right almost every time he spoke jesus had to apologize or correct him or come back and clear up the question amen but this time it wasn't peter speaking it was a stone speaking amen this time it wasn't a man speaking it was a deposit that jehovah god had placed there before the foundation of the world hey amen hallelujah and when that representation begins to speak it won't put god off in some other day it won't deny the present day manifestation of the revealed word of the hour amen peter wasn't caring about what the newspaper said what the internet said what the scribe said or what the pharisee said when the rock spoke when the stones spake amen he said thou art the christ the son of the living god amen oh my and when revelation spoke revelation answered he said and thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church you're going to become my house you're going to become my destination amen oh my i'm not only going to make you a destination i'm going to make you the spokesperson of the church i'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth abind in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven amen jesus knew there's something there peter went on and said other things he said i don't know him i deny him but it didn't dislodge the stone peter cursed but it did not dislodge the deposit oh my all that the father has given me will come to me and no man amen hallelujah jesus never disowned peter he never stripped away his disciple qualities he never removed them from his administration he just said tarry ye in jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high because when i come back in the form of the holy ghost i will be in you i'm going to enter into that temple i'm going to enter into the holiest of holies and my shekinah glory is going to begin to radiate forth where peter will not even speak his own thoughts any longer [Music] amen hallelujah i feel good tonight brother sister amen you're not gonna dislodge you're not gonna dislodge that stone your mistakes won't dislodge it you're backsliding on this logic what somebody else says won't dislodge it it's gonna stay there because he put it there and when peter stepped out of the upper room they asked the question what i mean at this these you act like drunk men amen and you know something peter did not deny that they were drunk he just said they're not drunk as you suppose [Applause] amen there was no disputing they were drunk there was no question they were drunk but peter was there to point them to the source of the drunkenness and he said these men aren't drunk as you suppose see and it's but the third hour of the day but this is that amen amen it didn't take an angel speaking to him now the holy spirit is dwelling on the inside of him to connect peter to the promise [Applause] to make peter one with the prophecy and he said when joel spoke this i was the one he was talking about when this prophecy was given i'm the one i'm the one it was intended for that word is describing me amen friends when you see your identity in the word you won't have to apologize you won't be ashamed you won't be backing up you won't be stepping to the side you stand right there this is exactly what the word of god said i am what i would be and what i would do and everything you're seeing is because that word amen [Applause] oh my the lord said simon simon behold satan has desire to have you satan hath desired to have you well you know if satan desires to have you it can only mean that he knows he doesn't [Applause] if satan's after you just shows that he hasn't gotten you amen if satan wants you it just shows that he doesn't own you satan hath desire to have you that he may sift you as leaked but i have prayed for thee that thy faith not amen i have prayed for you that your faith be pure and original if it is pure and it is original it is also invincible [Music] i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when when thou art converted it's not an if it's not a maybe oh my it's not peter if you can just hold on peter if you can just hold on peter oh if you can just avoid doing more stupid things or saying stupid things if you can just hope nope when thou art converted it's a divine appointment when thou art converted strengthened my breath amen so in closing tonight i just want to ask you tonight has he made you one of his dots [Music] has your heart become a manger amen i'm thinking about another dot that wanted to drink like his father and his brothers they wanted to smoke like his girlfriend they wanted to be like the others but god spoke to that god and said don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body in any way because i have a work for you to do in your order amen i'm gonna make you a destination has your heart become a manger where he can be birthed and place a place where his life can grow and express itself the bible says in matthew 13 44 again the kingdom of heaven is likened to treasure hid in the field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and bias that field when he saw that field every other possession every other piece of property no matter how valuable they were before now they're nothing it's sell sell sell sell he's liquidating all of those other assets because he found the dresser oh my have you found the treasure tonight when you find the treasure you'll liquidate all the others you will abandon all of the others amen but i i want to say this tonight you are that treasure and when he saw that deposit in you when he saw that stone in you amen he was willing to forsake all others and cleave only unto thee amen the man saw something of infinite value in the field so he sold everything else of value to redeem the earth that contained the treasure and your body is the earth that is wrapped around the treasure so you don't have to wonder if it's god's will to heal you or if it's god's will to save your god's will to deliver you your body is part of the inheritance because it's wrapped around the treasure amen so healing and salvation are into combined atonement tonight when god makes you his destination he transforms everything around you and everything about you so that he can express his life through you and god marks his destination amen the token was given to mark the destinations amen where the death angel could not enter amen the death angel could not strike the place because it had been marked as a destination amen rahab's home became a marked destination it was a special place she hung the token there proudly on display and she and her house all that were gathered under that token amen we're spared from the destruction of the city oh my i'm closing tonight but let your heart become his manger amen brother branham says this and i'm coming to a close if the the musicians would like to come and now father grant tonight that in each heart there will be a manger made or a roommate that jesus of nazareth might come in with all the fullness of divine faith that he might stand in each heart tonight and take the initiative side and take away all doubt throw away everything that's unlike him lord all the unbelief and skeptic ideas and just take over the heart and oh what our eyes will see then what a night this could be

going on what a place and what a time just now for him to come tonight just at the eve of the closing of this meeting and sway every heart to him with full assurance that he's here present tense now

remember one thing from a dot to a destination don't ever forget that he was not even here on sunday and he went through the high priest over and over on the high priest and he even confirmed to me to the end the message coming this sunday lord's willing so it has been a tremendous blessing and god has spoken to this church directly i was thinking about bethel when he said bethel was an a it was a place where the angels were ascending and descending and he brought to me back on john chapter 1 verse 51 when jesus said that and he say unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see the heaven open and the angels of god descending ascending and descending upon the son of man and we are feasting upon the unfailing body word of the son of men amen many men from a dart a small city we saw last sunday that the city is a church from these small dots we change our identity we are called now spoken word tabernacle from this dot is going to be a destination where the angel of god will be ascending and descending upon this church this is a direct message we thank the holy spirit for coming encouraging and strengthening us and speaking to us directly that the heavens are open and be more consecrated because in this place it's a special place brother branham say bethlehem was a spot where god was moving mysteriously i didn't know the brother will be preaching on monday it
