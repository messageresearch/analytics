time his uncle had a daughter and it's down during the times of the reigns of the median persian it's a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day he had a great feast and he called the queen to come set by but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so uh humiliated didn't know what to do that his own life wouldn't come i think that's a whole lot like christ today christ has invited us to sit in heavenly places with him and we're ashamed of us many people are ashamed to say they forgot the baptism of the holy ghost pentecostal people they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed of him and so the queen wouldn't come she refused to come it humiliated him his face turned red everybody noticed i wonder if jesus's face don't turn a little red to when he calls on us for a work calls on the pentecostal movement for fellowship and brotherhood and we're so tightly organized little groups that we won't bend for the other we're so getting so worldly and things like that we're getting ashamed of the name of pentecost some people is afraid to say say well i belonged i'm a christian but i'm glad i got a pentecostal experience amen i'm glad to bear the name of jesus christ it's the greatest privilege i ever had will say i'm part of him now we find out then he got some consultants to ask what must he do and they

brother caillou ministering this morning next time you tell me ahead that brother kelly is on town amen matter of fact he need to tell me when he need to come back to minister to us he only did it once so one i will talk to you later so we figured out how to get it amen we appreciate all the family member with us this morning we don't have visitors in this church we only have family member so if it's your first time second time you're not a visitor you're a family member so welcome to spoken word tabernacle body elijah if you can turn on this in the book of matthew we have a baby dedication this morning brother john porter grandson and it's an honor for us to have the beautiful baby being dedicated this morning brother jeffrey is here with his lovely wife god bless you sister good to see you this morning and the family in the book of matthew the bible says that they brought leader children to jesus in the book of mark the bible say they brought leader children to jesus and brother branham used that scripture several times saying that he uses that scripture to bless babies so somebody must say they say little children they didn't say babies so how is he using that scripture to bless the babies let's go to the book of luke chapter 15. same version of that scripture the prophet is always lined up with the scripture amen luke chapter 18 verse 15. matthew say little children we know a baby is a child but we want to help those that are still struggling with intellectual amen luke chapter 18 verse 15 and they brought to him also water we clear now if you look at another translation it speaks of babies amen so brother branham was right all right praise the name of the lord and they brought unto him also infants or babies that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but jesus called them to him and said permit allow little children to come to me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god there is an old saying that they say that when a child is a little boy or a little girl she's going to be trampling on your feet and when they grow up they trample on your heart and people always believe that and i heard it among the message believer when they go to trouble with their children brother branham say that if a child is a little baby or a little infant they're going to trample on your feet and when they grow up they're going to trample on your heart let me read this quote a little bit to help you up you know when i see this old fellow like that and he always take me back when i was a little bully and now the old saying is you know they on your feet now because the babies the little kids and your heart later in other words we are built to expect trouble but this is what right now but i don't believe it will be so when we dedicate them to the lord so from now on if somebody tells you that tell them brother branham say if you dedicate your baby i don't believe it they're going to stay in line with the word of god amen so let's sing bring them in as we're going to dedicate the baby this morning amen we're going to call brother jeffrey your wife the baby and the grandparent sorry brother john but welcome to the clip of grandfathers amen bring them in bring them me bring them in from the field of sin bring them in bring them in somebody's taking pictures this is a memorial amen god bless you brother jeffrey good to see you this morning god bless you sister thank you welcome what's the name of the baby gabriel alexander porter gabriel alexander porter praise the name of the lord let's go to prayer praise the name of the lord amen oh my god thank you let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly this morning father thanking you for this great gift of love lord the source of life always come from the lord and we thank you for the baby being in good health and mama as well lord father you the one that gave us this baby and you are here this morning in

lord under the admonition of the holy spirit father thank you for this bundle of love lord father we commit a man to the hand and i'm rebuking every spirit that will try lord father to buffet this

lord made the pillar of fire lord stepping between him lord and the work of darkness lord may the same pillar of fire always lead this child lord and lord father watch over him lord for the rest of his life lord until we're going to go together with him in the rapture father we thank you for everything and committed man to the hand lord thank you for this family and this wonderful brothers and sisters as we ambly ask it lord in the name of jesus christ in jesus christ's name amen this baby is anointed amen god bless you brother jeffrey thank you very much you're right awake now he's wide awake thank you congratulations congratulations amen i felt the anointing striking me amen this is a child of god amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord sister tesha i believe we can pray for you after service right at the end praise the name of the lord don't forget uh don't forget please we have a house meeting coming up on the first week of december on a saturday if you have your question young people question and answer bring them up you can't stand in front of jesus and say we were not given opportunity you got opportunity no excuse amen praise the name of the lord brother pauline i believe brother john already announced it as a baby baby omix that's a whole mystery in the european mental maybe one day we're going to teach on the stone of the human mentality and then you will see what is going on so blessed be the name of the lord let's turn to our scripture reading this morning we appreciate each one of you this morning i believe i got everything here if brother kelly you can remind me to pray for sister tasha it's her birthday she wanted prayer and we can do that at the end of the service let's stand for the reading of the bible ezra chapter 1. everybody receive a text for the reading few people amen unless you didn't subscribe if we got your number you receive a text ezra chapter one if you dare you can say amen praise the name of the lord now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled you might be seated if you watch the scripture this morning jeremiah prophesied and it took a while it seems like the prophecy of jeremiah would not come to pass israel was taken out in captivity but when the time of the prophecy according to god john 9 something happened amen that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia so the spirit of saras was trouble was stirred because there was a prophecy and the prophecy must come to pass and for some reason god enter into a political world and stir the spirit of this king this king was living normally living peacefully in his kingdom and suddenly something struck him when that happened it didn't happen by any chance it happened because it was time for the prophecy to be fulfilled amen and he made that he made the proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying that says cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has charged me to build him a house at jerusalem which is in judah so whatever is happening it's not happening by any chance modern events are made clear by prophecy amen let's go to psalm chapter 83 somebody will say we don't know what happened to this king he begin to make such a declaration such a proclamation it doesn't happen by any chance all is controlled by prophecy everything controlled by god amen psalm chapter 83 verse 1 a song or psalm of azer keep not your sound your silence o god hold not your peace and be not still o god follow your enemies make it tunneled david doesn't call them his enemies he's calling them the enemies of god amen your enemies make a tumult and they die hate you they are heading god not david it seems like they're heading you they don't hate you they are having the god that you serve amen and they that hate you have lift up the head they have taken crafty console against your people by taking crafty council against the people of god you are attacking god because god spoke to soul soul soul why are they persecuting me he was not persecuting the man jesus christ but saul was persecuting the church everybody clear they have taken crafty council against your people and consulted against your hidden ones they are hidden somewhere they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation so somebody is against the people of god somebody is against israel somebody is against the nation of god and they're trying to wipe completely the nation of god amen that the name of israel might be no more in remembrance so they want to destroy not only the nation but erase the name of israel but we know that israel is god's redemptive name for his church amen for they have consulted together with one consent and they are confederate it's a union a confederation of churches they are confederate against you where is that god amen the tabernacles of edom and an ishmaelite of moab and the hagarins verse seven kiba and emon and amalek amen the philistine with the inhabitant of tara so amalek we are dealing with amalek here but we found out that amalek is not alone now amalek is going into the confederation of churches the confederation of tabernacle he's pulling edom esau he's pulling moab the nomination they are bringing them together even the ishmaelites in other words the confederation of churches god even muslim insider amen but they are all confederate against the people of god amen and david is crying unto the lord to intervene because there is a confederation of tabernacles a confederation of churches that is rising up against his nation we know david is a prophet let's go to acts chapter 7 then we will pray amen act chapter 7 verse 6. if you dare you can say amen act chapter 7 verse 6 and god spoke on this was that his seed should adjourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil 400 years that was a prophecy given to abraham israel will go into egypt everything will be calm everything will be nice because joseph will be there joseph will be the prophet bringing a great message but suddenly something will happen there will be a flip amen verse 7 and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge say god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place job to verse 17 amen this is the key for this sermon this morning but when the time of the promise drew now so everything is controlled by prophecy amen everything was fine then trouble comes when trouble comes there is a significance to your trouble it means that there is something that god is trying to accomplish there is something that god is trying to fulfill amen so when the time of the promise erav trouble started so when you see trouble don't be discouraged there is a message to it amen but when the time of the promised juvenile which god had sown to abraham we just read the promise on verse six the people grew and multiplied in egypt till another king arose another pharaoh which knew not who we already preached about this one joseph was a mighty prophet the first pharaoh loved joseph the first pharaoh believed the message of joseph but another pharaoh came another spirit came that spirit rejects the prophet of the hour amen when he's rejecting the prophet of the hour it's bringing persecution to the church but that persecution does not happen by any chance the rejection and the persecution is only telling you that the time of the exodus has come the time of the promise of god has come the time to leave this earth has come the time has joined now that's why the spirit of saras is turned that's why the pharaoh changed that's why pharaoh is rejecting the message of joseph that's why the prophet is clearly rejected publicly because the rapture has come amen verse 19 the same death suddenly with our kindred an evil entreated our father so that they cast out their young children to the end that they might not live there is a rising of a power pharaoh ramses was not there but pharaoh says enter into the throne his entrance into the throne is god controlling everything god knows he needed a ramses there because ram says is needful for the exodus you can't have the exodus without ramses amen the reason why god is permitting ramses to arise in power is because there was a promise given to abraham but that promise is connected to ramses amen and ramses must be there for the promise to be fulfilled that's why god said that i raised pharaoh i already predestinated pharaoh i knew what pharaoh is gonna do i am the one that is allowing this pharaoh to rise because through this pharaoh i'm gonna show my power are we clear i'm just bringing pharaoh on the scene don't be discouraged but the reason why i'm putting pharaoh because i'm gonna demonstrate my power but to demonstrate my power i need a pharaoh that's going to reject the message of the hour amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for your presence this morning thank you for everything you're doing for us and thank you for the message of the hour and father to help us stand for this message in spite of everything that has happened lord we are committing this service unto the hand be the alpha and the omega speak to your children move me completely out of the way lord father may heaven be opened up and may hell be shut up father we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you good to see everybody this morning we had a wonderful thanksgiving message on wednesday on tuesday if you miss it you better go back on youtube and look into it we are on part six of the king of king ahazary's three fists and esther to banquet amen let's go to esther chapter 3 now praise the name of the lord hallelujah esther chapter 3 verse 1 after these things did king a hazaris promote heaven we know who herman is heaven was not in this position before anybody clear we already went and we saw the background between this war the war between mordecai and haman it is not a war of men it is not a battle of flesh it is a war of god and amalek because there was a promise made way before that god will fight with amalek amen we went through esther chapter one esther chapter two everything went fine esther has been chosen to be queen and she has replaced queen faster everything was calm in the kingdom suddenly stirred the king suddenly something happened to the king the king picked heaven he never picked any of the other princes he picked emman and when we look at him and we found out that heaven was from the seed of amalek amen and he picked emman and rose emman elevate emman into a higher position than any other priestess in the kingdom amen why verse one after these things did king hazards promote heaven the son of hamadeta the agar guide an amalekite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bow and reverence heaven we saw that for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai by not nor did him reference then the king's servant which were in the king's gate said to mordecai why transgressors you the king's commandment now he came to pass when they spoke daily to him and he hearkened not to them that they told him and to see whether mordecai's mother would stand for he told them that he was a jew we know a jew in the new testament speak of a christian that is baptized with the holy spirit so the problem between him and and the problem between mordecai is not a man problem it is a problem of faith it is a problem of religion one is a seed of amalek and the other one is the seed of israel which is god's people amen now as a reminder we know in exodus chapter 17 the bible says that and the lord said to moses write this for a memorial the battle with amalek in a book and he use it to the ears of joshua who's going to take over after moses for i will orderly pull out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven so we found out that when the opportunity was given to seoul to destroy or to fulfill this prophecy so never fulfill that prophecy amalek is kept and amalek continued to go by the beauty of it god spoke again on the following verse he says that because the lord has sown there is enough that the lord not israel the lord will have wall with amalek from generation to generation so god knew that amalek will continue to escape that's why god said there will be a war from generation to generation so there will be a first generation that will kill a certain number of americans but amalek will escape there will be a second generation that will come that will kill a certain number amalek will still escape but no matter how much amalek will escape one of this day amalek will be completely wiped out from the earth because god already spoke that i will wipe i will remove the remembrance of amalek from under heaven when we talk about war in this church we already seen that war spoke of a trumpet amen so when god says that there will be war from generation to generation god is speaking that they will be trumpet blowing from generation to generation and every trumpet that will blow will be a war to destroy amalek amen until amalek is completely destroyed let's go to john chapter 8 verse 44 hallelujah if you dare you can say amen amen blessed be the name of the lord john chapter 8 verse 44 jesus speaking to the pharisee he says you are of your father the devil and the last of your father you will do what is that last what is that desire he was a murderer a man from the beginning did satan kill somebody at the beginning no who killed someone came so it's clear the serpent seed right here right here because satan never key label he was carrying that key label right here a murderer that's why ken was off there wicked because he was displaying the attribute of satan amen he was a murderer from the beginning and the blood not in the truth a child of the devil cannot remain on the truth amen he will try like the pharisee but he cannot remain there because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own that lie is within him there is no truth in him either you have twofold you have lie amen for he is a liar and the father of it so when he gives birth he give birth to lies amen and he's going to be a murderer and we will find out that haman had a murdering spirit upon him as all the children of god which is an attribute of satan hallelujah let's go to first john chapter 3 amen first john chapter 3 verse 8 hallelujah he that commits sin is of the devil for the devil's sin from the beginning amalekite has sinners you remember last sunday for the devil's sin from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested or revealed that he might do what destroyed the work of the devil so when hell open up heaven also open up amen when the devil unfolds himself god unfolds also himself but the purpose of the revelation of god the manifestation of god the unfolding of god the purpose is to destroy the work of the devil amen praise the name of the lord we are still claiming let's go to psalm chapter 18 amen blessed be the name of the lord if the devil is fighting and he is using cain to destroy the seed of god what is god doing also to his children because the one who killed evil was king amen the anointing came upon ken and can kill abel but let's see also what god does amen because when jesus died judah also died when jesus sent his spirit on the day of pentecost judah sent his spirit back one was a child of god one was a child of hell or perdition psalm chapter 18 verse 32 if you dare you can say amen it is god that girls me with strength that's david so the strength of devi doesn't come by human strength everybody clear makes my way perfect he makes my feet like han's feet so if you look at david running it seems like david is gifted to run but it is not death that is running it is god in the flesh of david rhyming everybody clear praise the name of the lord and set me upon my high place verse 34 he teaches my hand to wall you see now so when death is warring it is not dead it is god warring with you in the flesh of david are we clear so that a bow of steel is broken by man how can a man broke a bow of steel it takes another power it takes a supernatural power for samsung to break into the host of the philistine so it is not your battle that's why the scriptures say when they're gonna bring you in front of the governor take no thought of what you're gonna do just relax and let god dwell in you the god that dwell in you do the fighting you want to give somebody an answer and you wonder where did i get the answer from it is not you giving the answer it is god answering himself take psalm 144. there is a battle yes but that battle is not yours there is a battle coming up yes you don't have to fight it amen somebody is going to fight that battle through you amen you're going to do things that you won't even imagine you can do because it's not you doing it amen psalm 144 verse 1 a song of david blessed be the lord my strength that's the strength of david which teaches my to do what and my finger to do what so the hand and the finger of david are maneuvering by the power of the holy ghost no wonder david could kill like he was killing he was not dead killing he was god through david that was destroying the enemy because the son of man when he is revealed is revealed to destroy the work of the devil everybody clear but the problem is if god have a war with amalek when is that war end now everything that had the beginning has an end so there is no prophecy that can continue from generation to generation the purpose was i'm going to war with amalek from generation to generation but at a certain time i must come to an end and finish that war amen everything that has a beginning has an end there is nothing that ever began but what has an end but something that had no beginning has no end god alone is the only one that had never beginning he had no beginning of days no ending of years and therefore we have to become a part of god by birth to live have an eternal existence sin and suffering and everything must come to a place where he has no existence because he had a beginning there was a time when there was no sickness we're going back there no sin no sorrow no death and then he come by a provision so all provision must end back and all that was had a beginning has to end so that the eternal can ever exist do you see what i mean so every battle that is coming every trial that you have in in your life if it starts it's gonna have a dead end amen there is a time you have a pregnancy there is a time no matter what's going to happen you must go to the delivery home if the baby don't want to come out we're going to go with c-section and we're going to pull that baby out because the pregnancy must go to an end amen praise the name of the lord when we look at the first battle between israel and amalek before the battle started we found out that moses went into the mountain and the condition of the hill or the mountain was determining the war with amalek if the hand of moses are up israel is winning if the hands are down amalek is whooping amen so he got to a point when the hand of moses were already tired so moses needed two nails amen to keep his hand up so the two nails that god used at that time and aaron so let's get into that a little bit as we're moving a moses brother branham say a perfect type of christ was moses is that right all those patriarchs were jesus christ living pre-life in other words they were projecting the life of jesus moses born under persecution just as there was killing all the babies in the time of moses jesus when he came there was killing all the babies to get him is that right the devil tried to catch moses the devil trying to catch jesus let's call another man by the name of moses a very outstanding character of the bible the greatest of all the prophet he was a type of the lord jesus christ the priest and the king and the lord giver a very perfect fable never a man talked to god outside of christ himself like who moses amen we preach to you a prophet like unto moses that's why moses said the lord your god will send a prophet in my caliber a prophet like unto me so when moses was on that hill there was a battle that was going down there but the hand of moses must be up and must be fastened to two nails and the nerves god used in the old testament was the nerve called aaron and the nail car what is going on with those now take exodus chapter 24 amen blessed be the name of the lord in the new testament we saw a man up on the hill but god hook nails them but in the old testament instead of using nails god used two people amen exodus 24 verse 14. if you're there you can say amen moses going to the table uh to the uh to the mountain and he said to the elder terry you here for us until we come again to you and behold who aaron and er are with you if any man have any matter to do let him come to them so aaron and er were not picked by chance are you there aaron and earl were the people that when moses went to the mountain he left the congregation into the hand of aaron and earl and when amalek come and attack his hair we saw again aaron and her growing up and holding the hand of moses but if you remember aaron came from the tribe of liver everybody clear aaron was delivered but let's go to exodus 31 let's see where air is from amen exodus 31 verse 2 are you there and the lord verse 1 spoke to moses saying see i have called by name bezalel the son of yura the son of who of the tribe of what everybody clear so we found out that on the mountain the two hand of moses were held by two tribes there was the tribe of the levant and they also have the tribe of the jew of judah now let's see first the responsibility of delivered let's go to exodus 32. when we move here then i'm going to drop to esther amen exodus 32 verse 1 and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together to whom they never went to earth they went to the levitical priesthood amen to put pressure on that priesthood they gathered together to aaron and say to him up make us god which shall go before us for us for this moses the man that brought us out of the land of egypt we know not what is become to him everybody clear let's jump to verse 21. amen and moses said to aaron what did this people do to you in other words aaron made the golden calf and moses come down from the mountain upset completely and moses looked at aaron he said i gave you the responsibility of this trouble moses never questioned her he only questioned aaron because through the old testament israel was under the levitical priesthood so the levitical priesthood was responsible for israel and moses went straight to the levitical priesthood and say we give you charge of the people of god what happened are you following me levitical priesthood answer that's why another priesthood must come amen moses said to aaron what did these people do to you that you have brought so great sin upon who brought so great sin aaron amen verse 22 and aaron said let not the anger of my lord works hard you know the people that they are set on mischief he's blaming the congregation amen for they say to me make us god we shall go before us for us for this moses the men that brought us out of the land of egypt we know not what has become of him and i said to them whatsoever has any gold let them break it off so they gave it to me then i cast it aaron casting i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf in other words they just bring it to me i put it in a fire and suddenly the calf came out no it was aaron that was making the calf amen it was aaron that taught them to bring him gold instead of aaron refusing aaron condon with the people and brought sin showing that the levitical priesthood could not hold sin or resolve sin in the camp of the lord anybody clear let's go to hebrews 7. the congregation was given into the hand of aaron and er and the levitical priesthood was disqualified amen and moses took the first table and broke them down and brother branham said it was showing that the levitical priesthood will be destroyed because it is unable to contain and to keep the people in line that's why the law was unable to bring people into perfection but they never questioned the tribe of judah exodus chapter 7 verse 11 if therefore are you reading with me perfection whereby the levitical priesthood erando for under it the people receive the law what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of who melchizedek and not to be called after the order of who eren failed god gave a promise that i'm gonna bring another priesthood under the order of mayor kizzadek and paul is explaining that if perfection was under aaron why did god give another promise to bring another priesthood are we clear verse 12 for the priesthood being what there is a changing of the priesthood from the tribe of liver to witch trouble we okay now it's dropping now right it's jumping now right praise the name of the lord everybody okay okay for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pretend to another what of which no man gave attendance to what in other words nobody outside of liver could have a no uh a permission to enter into the altar but we found out that there is a promise of another priesthood as that priesthood coming up from aaron or it's going to come from another trouble but which tribe is bringing that person amen verse 14 for it is what that hour spun out of what everybody clear everybody clear sprung out of judah of which tribe moses spoke nothing concerning what in other words when aaron and earl went to hold the hand of moses he was speaking that one day there will come somebody down the road and it's going to be a transfer of priesthood from the priesthood of liver all the way to the priesthood of judah and that will happen upon the hill and upon that hill his hand will be lifted up and that person will be the priesthood under melchizedek are we there because aaron handled the bread but if you go to genesis 49 you'll find that judah handled the wine you want to see it let's go to genesis 49 you know that the shoe bread was handled by aaron let's see 49 because when joseph was in prison he has the butler and the baker are you there the becker was handling bread and rebecca have to be killed everybody there the levitical priesthood have to be killed amen are you there and the battler who handle wine is the one that's going to take over because the feast of king a hazares is a feast of wine let's go to genesis 49 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord genesis 49 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen the scepter we already talked about this shall not depart from who you see her you see why moses gave him the responsibility amen and no er what lord give a king from between his feet until shallow which is jesus come and to him shall the gathering of the people be watch verse 11 binding his fault to the that's that's judah and his ass called to the choice he washes his garment in what that's judah and his clothes in the blood of the wine everybody clear verse 12 his eyes shall be read with what and he's stiff with what so judah is a tribe that is completely embedded in wine so when joseph went to prisoner he found the battle and the baker they killed the baker showing that the levitical priesthood the hand of the shoe bread will come off but the melchizedek piece would that handle the wine will continue because the feast of pentecost takes the wine everybody there now after the battle after this earth of moses being on the mountain which is a type of jesus christ being on calvary and the problem was if the hand of moses are up amalek is destroyed if the hand of moses are down america is taking over but god made sure that the hand of jesus christ are fastened to the to the cross so that no matter what happened whether he ran whether it's not raining whether something is going good or bad the hand of jesus stayed there until he spoke he said feed his famous amen jesus was fastened to the wall until he make sure the last of malachite is finished amen so the battle with malik in the old testament is a battle that started with the cross for us everybody following me praise the name of the lord if you look to the scripture for the destruction of amalek it took seven battles i let that soak down very greg gathered already amen god said that i would destroy amalek from generation to generation how many generations we don't know how many better we don't know but today it took seven people to destroy amalek completely anybody clear the first one was joshua [Music] joshua start with moses amen and the first battle of moses of joshua have to be put in the book as a memorial for generations to refer back to the battle of joshua everybody clear are you following me the second one that fought america was barack everybody clear amalek survived then gillian you need scripture you see me i'm alex then so i'm alex survived then david amalek survived then hezekiah used the simulink amalek survive you want to know the last one the last one was esther and nordica amen god gives a promise i'm going to destroy amalek from all the faces of the earth he uses joshua he blew the trumpet fought with amalek barak picked it up gideon picked it up saul picked it up david picked it up hezekiah picked it up the last one was mordecai and esther are we there but the first battle of joshua have to be put in the book brother branham says i believe that all of the old things was a tap of the new to come what israel was in the nature we are in the god leading israel naturally was what he's doing for us spiritually today just like after covering he took seven battle all the way to western to destroy amalek after calvary after the death the resurrection of jesus christ he also took seven churches with seven messengers to destroy the work of satan are we following me and the first one that fought his brother was put under the book of the law and the first messenger was paul and paul's scripture was put in the bible are you there they never put the scripture of arenas they never put the scripture of columba they only put paul because he was the first after calvary they only put joshua because he was the first after the old testament cavalry to use paul as a reference that's why paul said if a messenger comes if an angel comes and does not preach like me call him a christ because paul is going to be a reference joshua is going to be a reference are we clear together did i lose anybody praise the name of the lord amen brother bonham said in order to refresh your mind i want to point out how we arrive at the funding of the name of the messenger to various ages god in his servant will has seen to it that the history of the new testament church was not lost that's why they have to keep joshua that's why they have to keep paul amen even as he saw it that the history of israel would not be lost by placing it in there and the core bearing corroborating it today from multitude of scroll earthen vessels and other artifacts that archaeologists have discovered and interpreted we actually have a running command commentary of bible history from the first page up to now thus by reading history we can find out what men are men in various ages where the closest to god's original pattern at the apostle that's why paul have to be put in the bible that's why joshua have to be put in the bible are we clear the one that god used to bring his people back to the world of truth will be the one to examine then out of those there will be one for every age who will stand out the clearest as the closest in world pardon and power that one will be there so a reference has to be put on amen for the people and what i'm saying in this message is this the sign of the end time he said the book written when this angel finishes all the losing mysteries that through the battle they fought luther fought are you there wesley they were battles of amalekites are we clear now luther fought westlake thought the pentecost fought but there is coming says the bible that in the days of his sounding mordecai all the mysteries must be what revealed god of adam continues here when he is sending forth now that is that save the lord we have that clear when he sends off his message declare war like paul did on the orthodox like the rest of them did like luther wesley against the organization when he declared war and tell them they are lying the father of line it is not the truth and they are deceiving men when his son fought for that you can fail it won't fail because it shall be vindicated by the word of god you shall know exactly what it is and when he does he sent forth to call from babylon come out of here my people that you may not partake of her sin so we found out that just like amalek had war with israel the church today have woven all the way through the messengers everybody clear but the last one will be a prophet and a bride [Applause] the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistle known rarely known of all men for their generation when the mentor is failed god raised up others and so he has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger mordechai will be the final voice to the final the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he won't confront her through them mordecai and for the voice of god will be evil that's why the last to destroy amalek is esther plus mordecai not estee lauder esther plus monica the prophet and the brother everybody created so far our thanksgiving you may say what this all got to do with thanksgiving what abandonment was preaching the invisible union what you talking about brother branham here it is quoted tonight you didn't say nothing about thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim father were very thankful for their newfound way of life being separated from the aerial english denominations and creed they could marry to the new anointed world for their age that is right the anointed word for their age for their day so can we be thankful also why are we thankful as pilgrims like abraham old testament separated ourselves from the things of the world all of us associated abraham was a pilgrim god has separated us from the dead religion i'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeks to what separated us and opened to us a new land and you what message for this that is our thanksgiving we are thankful for god for the message of the hour amen then then he's got a different idea from what really the bible says that he believe it this way anyhow he shall start an influence and draw other away from it the thing to do is to protect this the way it's going stay right with it and knock everything away from it if you ever going to cross the goal line if you want to make it to heaven stay with the world amen the only one that's gonna overcome america will be a bride that will be connected with a prophet everybody clear as we move forward let's go back to esther chapter 3 now amen the brother with malek now we understand who is there is we understand who mordechai is we understand that there is a battle but the battle of esther is the last one this is the last stage amen let's go to esther chapter 3 now verse 5 if you dare you can say amen a few people amen and when heaven saw that mordecai bow not nor did heavens that was heaven full of wrath verse six a murderer and he taught scorn he disdain to lay hands on mordechai alone for they had show him the the what why do they call the people of who i thought they were jews amen i thought they were jews right they were jews from israel but right here they are called there why are they called the people of monica amen they show him for they had show him the people of moderate where for him and sought to destroy what i thought the problem was between him and heaven he could have killed him and be done with it but for some reason he could have killed mordechai and be done with it but for some reason when they show him the people of mordecai are you there heyman they call him they say get on youtube look at spoken word tabernacle look at brother josh bennett's church look at brother sean martin church look at brother child's church look at so and so church amen when heaven begin to look at the jews and their way of behaving and their lifestyle monica him and say ah i'm not gonna deal with one i'm gonna destroy all of them you see that american spirit you see that american spirit the problem is not with mordecai the problem is amalek the blood of that thirsty blood amen the roman blood that revelation 17 blood that is always drunk with the blood of the set that is testing the father from the beginning who was a murderer he can do it with one amen wait for him and sought to destroy what all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom after hazards even the people of what they're calling the jews the people of mordecai [Music] the people of mordecai brother burnham and then that voice that was speaking from above say you know it is written in the bible that the prophet will gather with them are we okay brother brother went to the sixth dimension are we there he saw a bunch of people coming to him and serving my precious brother my precious brother my precious brother now the angel is explaining to brother branham he's saying that you remember in the old testament when someone died he was gathered with his people and i said yes i remember that in the scripture say well this is when you will gather with you that's why they call the jews the people of the people for the age of monaco the people under the messenger called mordechai they are the people of modern children i said them that be real i can feel them oh yes i say but there are there is million there is not that many problems and that voice says they are not venom them is you they are still jews they are your comfort but they are your people because you are the messenger amen are we there that is the one that you have led to them and then therefore said you have been gathered to you all like jacob was gathered to his all these my people are all these branham no they are your convert to what but the reason why they are called the people of modica because they are under the message of mordecai everybody clear so far [Music] praise the name of the lord job two verse seven and the first month that is the mouth of nasa in the twelve years of king ahazard the cass what prayer that is the so they were casting a lot they cast a lot have a dual meaning it was used with israel it was he also used with pagan amen when they have to choose matthias the the apostle cast lot amen but the casting of lord of heaven was a religious casting lord by the religious combined with satanic in order to find a death that he can kill the children of god but if you cast a lot eamon thought everything is under his government he's the one ruling the world he's the one controlling the politics he's the one the head behind the king so i'm gonna choose a date and i'm gonna do this i'm gonna cast a lot keep your finger on esther chapter three go to proverbs chapter 16 let's see the casting of lord who's going to determine the casting of lord proverbs 16 verse 33 if you dare you can say amen keep esta uh 3 with your finger proverb 16 33 everybody there the lot is cast into the by the whole disposing thereof is after in other words no matter what project the devil have the one who have the final word is god no matter what the devil is trying to do to your family to your life to your job he can make all kinds of scheme he can make all kind of plans he can make all kind of projects but the one that have the father word to approve or to disapprove is god everybody there don't give the devil too much credit amen let's go to verse six to verse seven again of esther in the first month that is the mouth of nassan in the 12 years of king of hazaris the casper that is lot before heaven from day to day and from month to month to the 12th month that is the month of aber verse eight and evan said to king a hazardous everybody there now emma leaves his home he already got the date he already got the plan he doesn't want to kill one person he want to destroy everybody amen because of their religion because of their faith their faith is against what haman want women want everybody to bow down but the jewish faith is combating that we don't bow down only to god alone he says okay i'm gonna wipe them all he got the plan he got the dead he's going to the king amen when he goes to the king he's going to accuse the jew brother branham in revelation 12 7 and 9 when satan is cast out do you what it's written in the bible you want to put that down because i want you to read it we have not got time it's closed 20 or 15 till 10 see but in revelation 12 7 to 9 certain the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of the it's written in your bible amen the church is taken up and satan is cast down when the church goes up satan comes down then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and he's called the beast in other words as long as the bride is here satan still have access to accuse you to god he is called the accuser of the brethren when we grow up into the rupture then the devil comes down clear praise the name of the lord so he goes to the king and he begin to accuse the jews just like he was talking about job with god amen because nothing that heaven can do without the permission of the king there is nothing the devil can do in your life without god first giving permission are you there that's why he was looking at job he could not do anything until god granted permission because the devil said you put a hedge a one job you are protecting job that's the reason why i cannot do anything if you will allow me give me permission then i'll do it so he's going to the king he's going to god to ask permission let's see that verse 8. and heaven said to the king a hazardous there is a certain people he doesn't call their name there is a certain people scatter abroad everywhere all over the world and disperse among the people in all the prophecies of your kingdom and what so the problem with a man is the law of the jews is against him the word that was given to the jews because the law was the word of god and the law came with a mighty angel do you know that take deuteronomy 33 keep esta chapter three take detroit number 33 i spoke about it but probably some of you forgot deuteronomy 33 if you're there you can say amen deuteronomy 33 verse 2 and he says the lord came from sana and was up from sir to them he shunned forth from mount perem and he came with what ten thousand of cents you go to the book of acts he will tell you angels from his right hand went uh so when the lord descended on sana in his right hand he heard the law in revelation 10 we found also the lord descending in his right hand he has a book open you see now he has a fairy law from them verse 3 and he he loves the people all the saints are in your hand and they sat at your feet everyone shall receive of your moses command as uh it's a prophet that gave them the law even the what of the congregation of who so the law was the inheritance that god gave to the children of israel amen and heaven had a problem with the law he had a problem with the inheritance that was given to the children of god amen amen there is a problem now and i'm going to explain you something let's go to romans 7. amen the law have a mystery and we're going to see that right now amen romans 7 verse 7. we're gonna see what is the law amen never understood that the law was meant to kill him are you there the law was the one that gave the commandment not to bow down before someone amen but the law has a deeper mystery than that the law was the catch that god used to expose satan if there is no law satan is quiet you will not detect satan the first way to detect satan you need to put a law are you following me are you following me if i if you buy a cake you okay and you put it at home on your table and the children ask you who belongs who that cake belongs to you say it's for everybody everybody will go pick up the cake eat there's no problem amen every child is a good child every child is obedient every child is perfect amen but says that that cake is only for mommy [Music] let nobody else touch amen you will know which child obey you and which child does not obey you will know who can creep in the night trying to catch that cake the reason why you expose that because you put the law let's go to roman amen romans 7 verse 7 what shall we say then is the lost sin god forbid nay i have not known what but by the way when the child goes and creep and pick it up you get upset i told you don't touch it that is stealing you expose satan by the demon of stealing that demon was there amen you didn't know it until you put the law the law exposes the devil let's go back that's why paul is saying i did not sin until the law we were leaving without any problem until they say don't cross the red light when you cross the red light it's sin it was not seen before because the law was not there amen praise the name of the lord now i had not known sin but by though for i had not known lust except the law has said you shall not you see now now you begin to give him a list when somebody say hey you must say hey you begin to give him the list of the sin don't ever spit on someone it's a list of sin so the child is growing up knowing what is wrong amen are you there eight but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrote in me all can do all kind of what in other words when you put the cake i was not tempted when you said the cake is for everybody i didn't feel any problem to go get the cake that's why i just ate one time it was not a problem but when you put the law the scene in me begin to say are you gonna leave that cake alone like that wait till mommy goes to sleep it is sin that is talking amen to make to activate sin you need to put the law to expose heaven you need to bring the law are we okay let's continue for without the law sin is what everybody clear verse eight without the law sin is what for there was a love without the law was but when the commandment came sin what revive and now everybody clear and the commandment which or was ordained to life are found to be true for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceive me and by it slow me wherefore the law is and the commandment and justin was them that which is good made death to me it seems like because i believe the message now i got all this trouble because i'm a jew i am suffering now because i am a jew we are targeted by him and now i thought the jewish religion was to do me good it seems like the religion of the jew is causing me trouble it is not causing you trouble it is god who's exposing people amen praise the name of the lord god forbid but sin that he might appear what in other words that sin can truly come out and then god can slay sin away a man was living under this kingdom nobody knew him nobody was interested about him being an amalekite amen there was a seed that was laying there that is a murdering spirit but to expose heaven amen a law must challenge him you following me everything is controlled by god amen god the king was the one that put the law you follow me that everybody must bow down to him amen but there was another law that was contradicting that law and the reason why buffalo happen is to expose the true nature of heaven so that a man can come out and god can fulfill his commandment to destroy amalek are you following me now you see how god works our thoughts are not the thought of god what you think is in your life is trouble it's causing you trouble god is working out everything for his perfect will that's why the scriptures say all things work together for good amen verse 13 but sin that he may appear sin working what death in me but that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly what so we can have a right reason to kill him amen you understand now as long as heaven is still quiet you're not going to touch him he didn't do anything wrong you must give him a higher position and you must put a law and somebody must challenge him and he's going to bring the true nature of a man out so that a man might be condemned and killed everybody clear for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal so the underworld praise the name of the lord so now we understand the mystery of the law and then the law was an inheritance what is our inheritance we have a sacred trust you know what a trust is and we have an inheritance a heritage that we where that we inherit as believing children it is a sacred trust and that circuits trust and our sacred heritage is what that has been given to us the what which is the message of the hour that's your inheritance just like the law came with a mighty angel our message also came with a mighty angel that have the book that has been opened and that book has been given to us as our inheritance but somebody has a trouble with your message somebody don't like your message because your message is exposing him because your message doesn't allow him to dominate the entire world so he has a people that follow the message of william brian branham he has a problem with them amen god is a good husband man he pruned the tree that was all cut off the dead limbs what he's going to do burn them up there exactly god is the husbandman of the tree he takes care of it he watches over his what is his heritage his on he watches over his word to confirm it to watch it see where he gets he's going to do what so just like the jews has given the law god also gave us the word of god but there is somebody that is there and the problem is the kingdom the law of these people these people have a certain way of living that is troubling him in jeffersonville thousands of what not spoken voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity and defy lives walking around in the earth today without what these are people yes sir real christian that is the thunder against the enemy when you are living a true christian life you are automatically troubling heaven are we there the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and move right on oh my dad throw him away that's the thunder that shake the devil it is what a word of god that is leave by a christian like mordecai it will always trouble heaven are we there now let's go back to esther chapter 3 [Music] verse 8 and heaven said to king of hazaris i'm watching my time there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom and uh lord we understand the mystery of the law now amen our diverse from all the people neither keep the the kings law now emen is accusing the jews that they don't follow the commandment of god if you notice in the book of daniel first of all the first kingdom was babylon everybody remember then babylon was taken over by the middle pigeon everybody there and when a kingdom was taken by the middles that's when daniel appeared on the scene amen so daniel appeared before esther everybody clear now now if you go to daniel 7 verse 25 and 27 you'll find out that a law was given by the middle prison that everybody must respect the god of the jew amen and the law of the middle and prison does not change once they put it there they don't remove it amen but mordecai was correct according to that law but the accuser is trying to show him that hey these people don't follow that law that's the reason why they acting the way they acting amen the accuser of the brethren job to verse nine i'm trying to save you time there neither keep dead that king's law therefore it is not for the king's prophet to allow them if he pleases the king watch now let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay what these are billions in america money amen billions if you if you converted billions this man was wealthy roma wealthy amen and i'll give ten thousand talent of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king's what i'm gonna give it for the kingdom amen verse 10 and the king took his ring the permission must come from the king you okay now the king took off his wing from his head and gave it to him and the son of hamadatta the aggar god the what do you see the enemy of who the jews verse 11 and the king said to him and the silver is given to you in other words i don't need your money keep your money amen i don't need your money keep your mind the people also to do with them as it seems good to what it seems like god is giving permission to the devil to do something that is wrong amen him and goes and talked to the king the king remove the ring and give the ring to him and and tell him you go ahead and do what you got to do amen i give you the people take your money i don't need it why does god do something like this take john chapter 13. amen john chapter 13. i'm gonna hit two points and then we're gonna go to the end john chapter 13 if you dare you can say amen john 13 let's go to verse 21. amen when jesus has thus said he was troubled in spirit and testify and say verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall what jesus knew who's going to betray him betray jesus to be killed amen jump to verse 25 he then john lying on jesus christ said to him lord who is it everybody there jesus answered here it is to whom i shall give a soap or a muscle when i have dip it and when he had dipped the soap he gave it to who the son of who verse 27 and after the soap satan entered into him so the giving of the soap to judah open a door for the anointing of the devil to enter judah amen god is giving permission to the devil are you there at the beginning nobody can kill jesus one time they took him all the way to the cliff and the scripture said jesus passed among them nobody could touch him amen now it is time for the prophecy to be fulfilled when it is time god has to give permission are you there he said i'm gonna be betrayed but it's not gonna happen if i don't give permission i'm gonna give permission and i'm going to show you judah take the bread when judah picked up the bread his soul opened up and the fullness of the devil fullness of the devil entered into judah judah was anointed amen he needed permission watch what jesus said to him and when he gave verse 7 27 and after the soap enter and then after the soap set and enter into him then say jesus to him that you do do it what in other words go ahead and do it are you there let's go back to western amen amen came with the plan he came with the plan to kill the jew everybody will pray that god please we don't want this to happen and for some reason god take the ring and say just like i give to judah go and do it but remember on calvary that's where judah is finished amen remember judah was hanged that's right are you there and remember him and it was hanged amen you remember now just like judah was giving permission the king removed the ring and said i'm going to give you permission go ahead and tempt job go ahead and do whatever you want to do to job but i'm going to prove to you that that religion that you are attacking job is able to fight you all the way to the end amen and matter of fact when you're gonna put job to trial that's when job is gonna have a vision and job will say that i know that my redeemer leaveth he takes that trial to bring job out are you there this the ring is given but what is the mystery with this ring go to esther chapter eight if you remember some of you remember you're gonna get it esther chapter eight verse two are you there remember this ring again everybody there and the king took off his the bible is very specific because you must say the king have five rings the bible is going to explain us which ring okay over there they took the ring and gave it to him now it's very specific we want to know which ring amen the king took off his wing which he had taken from who you see now you see now everybody clear and give it to who let's go back to verse chapter three amen so the ring that was given to modic to heaven to give him permission to bring trouble to the jews was the same ring that was given to moderate to reverse the trouble of heaven and we know that a ring is a signet and a signet was also called a seal so the same seal that opened the door to the devil is the same seal that gives you power to destroy the devil brother stephen this seal that was given to him and they are the same ring what are you talking about in the message the seven it's a seal okay okay it's a seal okay what is the seven seal you heard it so much in the message you notice now for the end time what this what which seal so the seventh seal is what any question any question so the seventh seal is the message of the end time we're clear after all he's revealed all the six but don't say nothing about the seven and the anthem which is which seal so the seventh seal is the end time seal ever clear when the seven seal comes what do you have the opening of the word come and is given to you brother branham help me notice the losing of this ecclesiastical what everybody's following me no 20 years later this is 1920 1964 minus 20 it's 44 during the second world war 20 years later after that the second world war everybody can understand now we see the losing of the ecclesiastical what under there the same seal that is bringing your message is the same seal that is losing the devil you okay now the same sill that is losing airman to give him permission is the same seal that is given to mordechai to destroy amen everything is under control don't worry about it amen there's seven seals there's seven trumpet to the jews look at the moon which is the church darkening out the nominal church is gone completely the devil is taking over the churches where under sit down out the son of man being drove from there that's the reason why they are rejecting the message out amen because when the seventh seal opened that same seal not only does he bring crush to you it is also a lose he's also losing the devil everybody following me let's go back to esther chapter three then we're gonna head yeah a few minutes amen then the king took his ring verse 10 from his hand and gave it to him the son of ahmadita the agagod the jewish enemy and the king said to him the silver has given you the people to also to do with them as it seems good to you in other words take permission and show me exactly who you are amen when you are accusing people to me you are gentle but i don't know your intent i want to know your intent i want to know your plan i want to know what is in your heart toward my people go get permission and demonstrate yourself show off to the world show them who you are allow gay marriage hello everything pull everything you want to pull but just don't under remember the same seal is giving also to mordecai to destroy heaven what am i talking about there is a challenge coming up amen there is a challenge between the sin of god and the seed of the devil it is not your challenge it is not up to you to fight it there is wow that is spiritual war you just need to correct your relationship with god make sure that you and god are one and god will fight your battle make sure your relationship is okay once you are in close relationship with god once you are in talking term with god amen whatever is happening in the world god is allowing that because the third pool must be manifested it will take the pressure off the enclosure to bring the blood pool i cannot bring the third pool if there is no pressure i am the one that released the pressure i am the one that is allowing what is in the message happening i am the one that is proving the people in the message i am the one shaking the people in the message i am the one moving whoever is not supposed to be there must go i need my group of people stand still and see the salvation of the lord let's stand five minutes before time amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for love and for your mercy father just a blank of your revelation take all the worries away take all the pressure off it takes the frustration the anxiety off because many

your word that you shall never leave us nor forsake us you will be with us all the way to the end father you are folding what the devil is doing lord father behind bars now he's coming up slowly and he's against the messenger he's against this revealed precious word the inheritance that you have given us lord father to hold dear to our life lord you have shown us that whatever is happening in
