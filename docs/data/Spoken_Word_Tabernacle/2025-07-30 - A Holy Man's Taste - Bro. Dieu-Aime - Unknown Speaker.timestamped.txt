[0:00] got a lot of noise and that's all there
[0:01] is. And I thought he was barking at me,
[0:04] but I happened to find out down in the
[0:07] storm coming through, a great big eagle
[0:09] had been forced down and he was uh down
[0:12] under this uh blow down here and I seen
[0:15] he coming out. I thought, well now here,
[0:16] Lord, what'd you place that before me
[0:18] for? Right when I'm shouting and having
[0:19] a great time here, I thought, what
[0:20] what's this eagle doing here? What? If
[0:23] you look anywhere, you can see God. You
[0:26] can just see him anywhere. And I I
[0:28] thought now what's godly about that
[0:29] eagle because he's a scavenger and oh
[0:31] he's a bad guy. And I thought what what
[0:34] godly would be about that thing? And the
[0:36] first thing you know he moved out jumped
[0:38] up on the limb like that. He looked over
[0:40] that little squirrel sitting there just
[0:41] like he go tearing to pieces. He looked
[0:43] back over to me and I thought well now
[0:46] this is a position now Lord. Where are
[0:48] you at in that that scene? Everywhere
[0:50] you look you can see God. I thought
[0:52] there's a little old pine squirrel that
[0:53] runs all the game out of the woods and
[0:55] he's no good. And here sets a little old
[0:57] a big old eagle here who if you kill a
[1:00] deer and leave him lay there, the eagle
[1:01] eat him up overnight if he could. And
[1:03] what he's just as mean as he can be. I
[1:04] thought, where could you be in this
[1:05] scene? I said, you're everywhere, old
[1:08] now. Where could I see why God put that
[1:09] scene before me? And I looked again and
[1:13] I happened to notice that eagle had
[1:15] bravery. It wasn't scared. No matter
[1:18] what I do or what anything, it was
[1:20] brave. And I thought, that's it, God.
[1:22] You don't want cowards. God wants men
[1:25] and women who's got a backbone instead
[1:27] of a wishbone.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; When God says anything, we believe it.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; That's all that settles it. If God said
[1:33] so, that makes it true. Is that right?
[1:36] &gt;&gt; That makes it true.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, said there you are,
[1:39] Lord. You want somebody that'll really
[1:42] know what they're talking about, is
[1:43] ready to stand for what's truth. A lot
[1:46] of people say, "I accept my healing. I
[1:48] believe Jesus heals." All right. And the
[1:49] first little cramp hits you, you're
[1:51] ready to give up. Oh my. And you go and
[1:54] say, "I believe in the baptism of the
[1:55] Holy Ghost." And shout and dance in the
[1:57] church. And when you come to meet some
[1:58] critic out there on the street, you're
[1:59] as silent as a church mouse. That's
[2:02] right. Oh, brother, don't hold your
[2:04] peace. Scream out.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then take your head, be like John
[2:08] the Baptist. That's right. Stand for
[2:10] what's truth.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; And there I looked at that old eagle. I
[2:13] thought, "What makes you so brave?" I
[2:15] said, "Do you know I could shoot you if
[2:17] I wanted to?" And he great big gray
[2:19] looking eyes looked over at me. He
[2:21] wasn't scared of me.
[2:22] I thought, "I'm sure you're not scared
[2:23] of that squirrel." And uh I thought,
[2:25] "Well, I said I grabbed my rifle. I
[2:27] said, "I can shoot you." I noticed him.
[2:29] He jumped, looked at me again. But I
[2:31] thought, "Well, what makes him so brave?
[2:33] How is that fellow so brave? I don't
[2:35] understand that." But I happened to
[2:37] notice here's what was making him brave.
[2:39] I seen him moving his wings like this,
[2:42] feeling his wings as if his wings was in
[2:44] good condition. I said, "Thank you,
[2:46] Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:50] Amen.
[2:52] Someone said not long ago, "Brother
[2:53] Bram, aren't you afraid on that platform
[2:55] that you'll make a mistake and tell
[2:56] somebody the wrong thing?" Oh, no. Not
[2:58] as long as I can feel him with me.
[3:00] That's right. As long as he's there,
[3:01] everything's okay. That's That's all
[3:03] right. As long as he's there, the boat's
[3:06] in control. And I watch him moving his
[3:08] wings. I thought, "Well, say he he'd
[3:11] look up all time, look and see how far
[3:13] that timber line was up there in that
[3:14] timber." He knew if he ever got in that
[3:16] timber, I'd never seen him under the
[3:17] sights of that rifle. So he's sitting
[3:19] there looking at me just having a big
[3:20] time. He looked at me and then he looked
[3:22] over at that squirrel. He looked at me
[3:24] like that. I said I said, "Well, if this
[3:26] isn't amazing." After a while, he got
[3:28] tired of that little old chur of the
[3:29] pine squirrel. So he just give one big
[3:31] bounce like that. Flopped his wings
[3:33] about twice and he was pumped through
[3:34] that timber. He never flopped his wings
[3:37] one more time. He just set his wings and
[3:40] he knowed how to ride them air waves
[3:42] that was coming down. Boy, he just went
[3:45] up every time. He didn't flop flop flop
[3:48] trying to get up. He just set his wings
[3:50] right and rode right on all those waves
[3:51] and went on on
[3:54] till I couldn't even see a spot of him
[3:56] no more. He went plum out of sight
[3:58] leaving this little earthbound chatter
[4:00] chatter chatter chatter that I thought
[4:02] hallelujah. I dropped my rifle around
[4:04] around a tree. again. That's it, Lord.
[4:07] That's it. Let me know how to set my
[4:11] way.

[36:08] us a testimony tonight. Amen.
[36:12] God bless you.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Um I was working last week um and my
[36:18] wrist started hurting. I have an
[36:19] occasional pain that I get on my right
[36:21] wrist kind of towards the pinky side and
[36:24] usually it goes away within a few hours
[36:26] so I never worry about it. But when I
[36:28] was working last week, I don't know if I
[36:30] just bent my wrist weird or something,
[36:31] lifted something too heavy. Um, but it
[36:34] was really hurting and it wasn't going
[36:36] away after a few days. And I wasn't
[36:39] worried about it. I was also dealing
[36:41] with some pain in my jaw that was
[36:42] causing me headaches and things. So that
[36:44] felt kind of like the bigger issue to
[36:46] worry about than my wrist. Um, but as
[36:48] the days went by, it started getting
[36:49] worse. And on Sunday when I came in and
[36:52] was playing up here, I it was so bad
[36:54] that I could not like twist my wrist
[36:56] left to right. Like when I was playing,
[36:58] I was having to move my whole arm just
[37:00] to use my right hand. And I started
[37:02] getting real frustrated after like four
[37:04] days of that. And um with like with my
[37:07] jaw pain, too. I was like, "All right."
[37:09] So after brother Steven preached on
[37:12] Sunday um I just sat here praying and I
[37:15] was like Lord I can't even play the
[37:17] piano for you right now. I can't I can't
[37:20] glorify my you know use my gift to
[37:22] glorify you if my wrist hurts so bad I
[37:24] can't even use my hand. So I just
[37:26] started praying. I'm like Lord any body
[37:29] aches have to leave in Jesus name. You
[37:32] know so I started praying about my wrist
[37:33] and my jaw. And like I told you I could
[37:37] not bend my wrist left or right hardly.
[37:38] I had to keep it stick straight because
[37:40] it was like a searing pain. And by the
[37:43] end of the prayer, I was able to just
[37:45] fully rotate my wrist like this with
[37:47] very minimal pain, but there was still a
[37:49] little pain there. But I was like, you
[37:50] know what? It's a miracle enough that
[37:51] right now that I could even roll my
[37:53] wrist and play the piano. So, it's three
[37:56] days later. I have no pain in my wrist
[37:58] whatsoever. It just completely left. I
[38:00] can move my hand. I can play the piano
[38:01] with no issues whatsoever.
[38:03] [Applause]
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Amen. We thank the Lord
[38:10] for the life of our sister. Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we have a special tonight.
[38:17] Amen. Before that, we going to invite
[38:19] brother John to thank the Lord for our
[38:22] lives. Amen. And thank the Lord for this
[38:25] wonderful testimony of Sister Lily.
[38:27] Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; And and bring before the Lord any
[38:31] unspoken request tonight. Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] We've got something on our hearts. Let's
[38:52] hold that before the Lord as we go to
[38:53] him.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, what a privilege, Lord, and an
[38:57] honor just to step into this atmosphere,
[38:59] Lord, in your presence, Lord, to bring
[39:01] our prayers and supplications before
[39:03] you, Lord God. There's been none uh
[39:06] verbally spoken, Lord. So, we're just
[39:09] counting, Lord, that you know our hearts
[39:10] this evening. And you know the burdens
[39:13] in our hearts, Lord. The the desires,
[39:16] the needs, Lord, whether it's whatever
[39:18] it is, Lord. You know, we thank you for
[39:21] what you did for my daughter, Lord. Uh
[39:24] it's it's a gift, Lord, and and you
[39:26] honored it, Lord, so that she could
[39:29] worship you back with it, Lord God. And
[39:31] we just thank you for that, Lord. As
[39:33] we've gathered tonight in your precious
[39:35] name, Lord, we ask that you just come
[39:37] and meet every need, Lord God. Bless the
[39:39] tithes and the offerings, Lord. We thank
[39:42] you for some of the rain, Lord, as we
[39:44] mentioned Sunday, that you have sent in
[39:46] various places, Lord God. And we just,
[39:49] Lord, we haven't gotten enough yet. We
[39:51] just call it the latter rain, Lord. We
[39:53] need it. There's a lot of things that
[39:56] are happening in the world, Lord.
[39:58] Lord, we know you're in control and we
[40:01] don't worry about it, Lord. We get
[40:04] excited, Lord God, when we see these
[40:06] things that are coming to pass, Lord,
[40:09] because your prophet spoke it, Lord, and
[40:11] it's in the Bible, Lord, and we thank
[40:13] you for it.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Please continue to do your work in our
[40:17] lives, Lord God. Bring us closer to you,
[40:20] Lord. If it requires more sacrifice or
[40:23] obedience, Lord, let the stubbornness
[40:25] leave us, Lord, and let us just make the
[40:28] sacrifice needed, Lord, as you call on
[40:30] us.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father. We ask that you
[40:33] bless every family present that's here
[40:35] this evening, Lord, and on on the
[40:38] stream, Lord. Bless our pastor, Lord, as
[40:41] well, Lord, and his family and the
[40:44] sacrifice that he makes for us, Lord,
[40:46] for our benefits in your word, Lord. We
[40:49] thank you. It is good to see the Kimodos
[40:52] back this evening as well, Lord God.
[40:54] It's not the same without brother Kalema
[40:56] here, Lord. And we just thank you,
[40:58] Father. We're going to pull on your
[41:00] servant this evening, Lord. So, give him
[41:02] strength. Keep him focused in your word
[41:04] and what you've spoken to him, Lord. And
[41:06] may we just have a good time and enjoy
[41:08] ourselves in your presence, Lord. We ask
[41:10] all these things, Lord, in the precious
[41:13] name of our savior, Jesus Christ and
[41:15] Lord. Amen.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. An amen. Amen.
[41:22] So, it's more um I wouldn't say it's a
[41:25] special amen. It's a congregational.
[41:27] Amen. So, we a special congregational.
[41:30] Amen. So, we we're going to join into
[41:33] sing. Amen. We all know the song, right?
[41:36] I'm going to let the glory roll. Amen.
[41:38] So, Amen. So, we can be upstanding.
[41:41] Amen. Even as we ask our sister Amen to
[41:46] take the song when I get carried away.
[41:49] Amen.
[41:54] [Music]
[42:10] I'm going to let the glory roll and the
[42:13] roll is for glory.
[42:15] I'm going to get the pride of myself and
[42:18] I get the side.
[42:21] I'm going to have the time of my life
[42:22] when the time of my life is over.
[42:26] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[42:29] carried away.
[42:30] Oh, I'm going to let the glory roll when
[42:33] the roll is rolling for me. I'm going to
[42:37] get beside myself and I get beside.
[42:41] I'm going to have the time of my life
[42:43] when the time of my life is over.
[42:46] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[42:49] get carried away,
[42:52] well, I don't know why I become a little
[42:54] shy when I get around a whole lot of
[42:56] people. And I can't figure out why I
[42:59] never can shout about the love that
[43:01] floods my soul. I must confess. I can't
[43:04] express the feelings deep inside me. But
[43:07] the things I know and cannot show. One
[43:10] day will allow.
[43:13] I'm going to let the glory go. When the
[43:15] road is rolling.
[43:17] Oh yeah. I'm going to get beside myself.
[43:23] I'm going to have the time of my life.
[43:25] When the time of my life is over,
[43:28] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[43:31] get carried away,
[43:34] I'll pass the clouds and I'll shout so
[43:36] loud. Ray, sunlight, thunder, my tearful
[43:40] eyes fill the skies until it looks like
[43:43] rain. When I leave this world, the gates
[43:46] of pearl and stand before my savior. I
[43:50] left my soul. Let the glory rolling from
[43:52] the roll he calls my name. I'm going to
[43:56] let the glory roll when the roll is
[43:58] rolling glory.
[44:00] I'm going to get beside myself and I get
[44:03] inside
[44:04] that day. I'm going to have the time of
[44:06] my life when the time of my life is
[44:09] over.
[44:10] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[44:14] I'm going to
[44:16] the rope and the road is holy glory. Oh,
[44:20] I'm going to get beside myself when I
[44:23] get beside the Jesus day. I'm going to
[44:26] have the time of my life where the time
[44:28] of my life is over.
[44:30] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[44:34] sing. I'm going to let the glory go.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get myself.
[44:45] I'm going to have time of my life when
[44:47] the time is over.
[44:50] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[44:53] here. Worship the Lord.
[45:11] [Music]
[45:14] Oh, I'm going to let the glory go with
[45:17] the rolling rolling.
[45:19] Oh, I'm going to let the time.
[45:25] I'm going to have the time of my life
[45:26] where the time of my life is over. I'm
[45:30] going to get carried away. When I get
[45:32] carried, I'm going to get carried away.
[45:35] I'm going to get carried away. Carried
[45:37] away. Carried away.
[45:41] I get carried away.
[45:51] I'm going to get myself.
[45:56] I'm going to have the time of my life.
[45:58] When the time of my life is over,
[46:01] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[46:03] get carried away,
[46:06] I'm going to let the glory roll.
[46:11] I'm going to get by myself when I get
[46:16] I'm going to have
[46:21] I'm going to get carried away when I get
[46:24] carried away.
[46:28] Amen.
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[46:36] Sometime I still I stay at home and I
[46:38] play this over myself and just going
[46:41] around and listening to those sermon.
[46:43] Maybe one of these day we will put them
[46:44] on a CD.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, we will put them
[46:51] on a CD.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; So when the devil bothers you, you just
[46:55] get carried away.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we will see who who who really
[47:01] will get carried away.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory to God. Wonderful.
[47:06] Wonderful. Do we have a special on
[47:07] Sunday? Because this type of song remove
[47:10] devils away.
[47:14] When I say devil, that devil of coming
[47:17] sleep slowly
[47:20] being bothered by the devil waiting for
[47:22] the song leader to pump you up and then
[47:25] start the CPR. He takes the first song,
[47:28] the second song, the third and you start
[47:31] reviving. This one comes just that's it.
[47:37] It's like a glucose boost. That's it.
[47:39] You back up. So if we don't have one,
[47:42] brothers,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; okay, we will make room for that one.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Full of energy.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. If you don't want to
[47:51] dance, that's your problem. We will be
[47:52] carrying away. Amen. After the Holy
[47:55] Spirit showing us everything that is
[47:57] going on in our lives. Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Did you see me even preaching what I was
[48:03] supposed to preach?
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So you understand who came down.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem, remember when the
[48:13] when the water begin to get trouble.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Then you jump.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; The water was already troubled by a
[48:20] testimony.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; It happened on Sunday.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; So if it happened for one, check your
[48:24] life. You will find out that certain
[48:26] habit have been gone.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Note will go they already been gone.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Because the devil when he goes he will
[48:35] come back to resist again to try. The
[48:37] scripture say he will come back to try
[48:39] to make you understand that you know
[48:41] whatever you think is happening to you
[48:44] never happened. You tell him you say you
[48:46] know what the reason why you're talking
[48:47] to me like that is because it really
[48:49] happened and you already outside the
[48:51] house. So you're trying to bark so loud
[48:54] over there to come back in. You ain't
[48:56] coming back again.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; That man
[49:03] the scripture say the man suffer for 38
[49:07] years. So I don't know how long you
[49:09] suffer with your habit. Maybe some of
[49:12] you 38, some of you 20, some of you 10,
[49:15] some of you 15, whatever. In other
[49:18] words, somebody have been suffering by
[49:20] something for a long time. And these
[49:23] things are embedded by our culture, our
[49:27] the way the home we grew up in and all
[49:30] this stuff. We picked up spirit and we
[49:32] just don't know how to control oursel
[49:34] and we keep moving up with it. And
[49:36] brother now come and say habits are
[49:39] spirit. Not a big one. A little bit, a
[49:41] little living, a little folding, a
[49:43] little folding of the head and
[49:44] everything. If you just stay focused
[49:47] with the work of Calvary and everything
[49:50] should go away from you. People need to
[49:53] be free.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; We cannot be in this message and then
[49:57] still battling the way people are
[50:00] dragging like we are waiting for the
[50:03] coming of the Lord because we just about
[50:04] to die. Uh-uh. That's not the message of
[50:07] the hour.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; The message came to give you strength in
[50:11] the midst of hell. That's why David
[50:13] said, "Though I walk in the valley of
[50:15] the shadow, I fear no evil." In other
[50:17] words, the valley is not good, but David
[50:20] is fine.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; That's the way Christian should walk in
[50:23] this world.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, no matter what is going
[50:26] on on the street, no matter what is
[50:27] going on on the uh I mean internet,
[50:30] whatever is going on on the news, we are
[50:32] still walking unconscious of what is
[50:35] going on and just minding the coming of
[50:37] the Lord and focusing on the cross
[50:39] because we know that sooner we will
[50:41] leave this earth. Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; So whichever habit is happening, just
[50:47] tell him shake, shake, get it off.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Take that habit away. And God, I don't
[50:54] know, for some reason. I tried the first
[50:56] time, it didn't work out. I tried the
[50:58] second time,
[51:00] another sermon popped up. So I don't
[51:02] know why the Holy Spirit keep pushing
[51:05] pushing it like that. But this was
[51:07] necessary. We need it. We went back. You
[51:10] sit down, you look at the ant life and
[51:12] your mind is completely blown by the
[51:15] scripture like such a little tiny
[51:17] creature but exceeding wise. And I never
[51:21] knew these things until I begin to get
[51:23] into it on Sunday night. Then I begin to
[51:26] see it clearly that Jesus always look at
[51:29] one season ahead.
[51:33] When he's in a season, his eyes are
[51:35] already there.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And that's truly the mind of God.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; The world say leave the very moment but
[51:43] the Christian is looking there. That's
[51:44] why we even living with the rapture.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; So we are looking for the season of the
[51:52] immortal.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; But we are in the season of the mortal.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; So when you looking at the unseen you
[51:58] get caught up.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; All right. We will get into that on
[52:03] Sunday. Lord's willing. You pray for me.
[52:05] All is well by God's grace. She said
[52:07] Sharon had to take a quick trip. Uh
[52:12] all right. I will explain everything on
[52:13] Sunday. But all is well by God's grace.
[52:15] And uh we are doing great. It was just
[52:18] the devil left and right and two days up
[52:21] and down up and down. But she made it
[52:23] safe and then by God's grace she'll be
[52:25] back next week. So you pray for her.
[52:27] Everything is good. But she had to see
[52:29] her father. Now he's doing a little bit
[52:31] better by God's grace. Amen. But I
[52:34] explain the detail if you want the
[52:35] detail.
[52:37] Do you want the detail?
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God spoken word
[52:42] tabernacle. Okay. We greet you all in
[52:44] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[52:46] Jesus Christ both visible and invisible
[52:49] audience. Any family member here? God
[52:52] richly bless you and welcome to our
[52:54] convention on Wednesday. I know you we
[52:57] all are excited to go check the
[52:59] building, but just refrain for a little
[53:01] bit
[53:02] because we don't want you step on stuff
[53:04] there that the and uh uh the T guy will
[53:10] be upset with you in the morning. So
[53:13] wait till Sunday if you can and then you
[53:16] can go there because he he places his
[53:18] stuff a certain way. If you step on it,
[53:20] you move it, then he won't like it. So
[53:23] if you just suffer, it's only
[53:26] three days and on Sunday you can come in
[53:29] by God's grace. He should be pretty
[53:31] close to the end so you can see it.
[53:34] Unless and if you want to go, you still
[53:36] want to go there, you need uh maybe
[53:38] brother Robert or somebody or the
[53:40] trustee, somebody to stand with you and
[53:42] tell you where to stop because we don't
[53:44] want you to step on his stuff and cause
[53:46] trouble. Yes, sister something. Okay.
[53:48] Praise God. So, brother, brother Albert,
[53:52] brother JM is preaching tonight. So,
[53:55] let's pull on the gift of the Lord. You
[53:57] know him. He been one part of us. So,
[53:59] let's hear what the Lord want to speak
[54:01] to us tonight. Amen. Let's go. We only
[54:04] believe. Good to see you, brother
[54:06] Khalmer. Good to see you, Sister D. I
[54:08] knew you were online somehow. I say I'm
[54:10] not going to mention his name because
[54:12] people would know
[54:15] my the some of the secret of the church
[54:17] said you just come back in.
[54:21] I have to protect you. Brother Brandham
[54:24] say when the devil cannot attack the
[54:25] work of God then he begin to find the
[54:28] vessel from where fires are coming from.
[54:30] So some of the struggle you go through
[54:32] or the fight you get through you
[54:33] fighting because of the ministry.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; You got your own life and you got the
[54:38] because of your ministry. Especially
[54:39] musician and he and everybody sometime
[54:41] they get bullet flying because the devil
[54:43] is just trying to disrupt something but
[54:46] through it all everything sir
[54:48] &gt;&gt; zero it doesn't work if he bring it it's
[54:50] a testimony he bring it turn to a
[54:52] testimony he bring it he turn to a
[54:54] testimony before you know it the wall is
[54:56] up outside God bless you have to be here
[54:59] to know what I'm talking
[55:01] Oh,
[55:04] believe
[55:06] this one.
[55:09] Oh,
[55:11] we believe
[55:17] All things

[55:50] All things
[55:53] are mercile. Oh,
[56:02] [Music]

[56:13] [Music]
[56:18] I believe
[56:20] [Music]

[56:26] [Music]
[56:40] Oh,
[56:43] I believe.
[56:47] [Music]
[56:51] I believe
[56:57] all things
[56:59] are bless you.
[57:08] [Music]
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Good evening church. God bless you all.
[57:14] Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much musicians and
[57:17] technicians also.
[57:19] And I also thank the pastor for this
[57:22] privilege to stand here before the bride
[57:24] of Christ.
[57:26] And if I could take just a moment
[57:28] because I remember several s Wednesdays
[57:31] ago, brother Richard had preached about
[57:34] tithing and he said there was many
[57:36] different type of tithing. I'm not going
[57:39] to preach on tithing, but I just wanted
[57:40] to touch something.
[57:43] You know that every day God gives you a
[57:45] paycheck. He gives you a paycheck of 24
[57:48] hours, you know, and some people within
[57:50] that 24 hours, they don't even give 10%
[57:52] of that to God. And that's something
[57:54] even little kids can do. Now over the
[57:58] I'm not going to take the uh what's it
[58:00] called calculating the whole year, but
[58:01] if you were to calculate your time for
[58:04] the vacation only because there's like
[58:05] 70 days, that's about 1,680
[58:10] hours. Now, if you were to take the
[58:13] amount of time that you gave to God and
[58:15] the amount of time that you didn't give
[58:16] to God, it would be the amount of time
[58:19] that you owe God would be a lot. Now, if
[58:21] I were to tell for those of us that do
[58:23] work, if I were to tell you to take the
[58:25] amount of time you get paid per hours
[58:27] and have to multiply by the amount of
[58:29] time you owe God and pay that as
[58:30] tithing, most of y'all will go
[58:32] overdraft. So,
[58:34] so tonight I come here as your brother,
[58:37] but I also come here as a tax collector
[58:39] to collect some of God's tithing. So by
[58:42] God's grace,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; spiritual tithing, if we could go to our
[58:49] scripture reading,
[58:55] John chapter 4
[59:03] verse 31. If you're there, can you say
[59:04] amen?
[59:11] Amen. Now the scripture says
[59:14] first let's go to God in prayer. Lord
[59:17] heavenly father I come before you first
[59:20] to thank you Lord Jesus Christ for this
[59:21] opportunity this privilege to be here
[59:23] before your bride. Lord God I come to
[59:26] you so you may use me. Lord God use me
[59:28] to speak to your people. Use me to speak
[59:30] to not just your people but me also.
[59:32] Lord God I pray that you may remove me
[59:34] out of the way. remove the congregation
[59:36] out of the way, both visible and
[59:37] invisible audience. Lord God, may you
[59:39] touch those that need to be touched and
[59:41] may Lord Jesus Christ heal those that
[59:42] need healing. Lord God, I pray that you
[59:44] may give us new revelation and for those
[59:46] of us may remind us things that maybe we
[59:49] knew but we forgot. Lord God, I pray
[59:51] that this may be a blessing to your
[59:52] bride and I bend the remaining of the
[59:54] service onto you. In Jesus Christ's name
[59:56] I pray. Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now John chapter 4 verse
[1:00:01] 31-34 says this.
[1:00:04] In the meanwhile in the meanwhile his
[1:00:07] disciples prayed him saying master eat.
[1:00:11] This was after uh the woman at well. But
[1:00:15] he said unto them, I have meat to eat
[1:00:18] that ye know not of. Therefore
[1:00:23] therefore said the disciples one to
[1:00:25] another. Have any man brought him out to
[1:00:28] eat? Jesus said unto them, "My meat is
[1:00:30] to do the will of him that sent me and
[1:00:34] to finish his work." May the Lord God
[1:00:36] bless the reading of his word. And my
[1:00:39] subject tonight is a holy man's taste.
[1:00:41] You may be seated. Is a holy man's
[1:00:44] taste.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And if the pastor will allow me, I would
[1:00:50] like to talk to I would like to talk to
[1:00:52] uh what's it called? Preach for the
[1:00:53] youth a little bit. And
[1:00:57] of course I'm praying to everyone but I
[1:00:59] want to talk to the youth a little bit
[1:01:00] also. And the thing about
[1:01:06] first let me go to the quote of tonight
[1:01:13] it's in uh 1965 leadership. Brother
[1:01:17] Brand says this, "Now you take the
[1:01:19] thinking man's filter, Jesus Christ, the
[1:01:22] word,
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; and you'll desire a holy person's
[1:01:26] taste." That's right.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Because it'll satisfy that. If you got
[1:01:30] the Holy Spirit in you, this satisfies
[1:01:33] that.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; And me, when I like when I read, I like
[1:01:36] to pay attention to the linguistics of
[1:01:38] what is written. And sometime my friends
[1:01:41] get annoyed at that, but I like to pay
[1:01:43] attention to those words because they're
[1:01:44] very important. over here it says
[1:01:48] um if the thinking man's filter brother
[1:01:51] Brand says the thinking man's filter if
[1:01:53] you notice the filter is capital
[1:01:55] speaking of God himself and he proceed
[1:01:57] to say that that thinking man filter is
[1:01:59] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ the word
[1:02:01] the word of God
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; and then he proceed to say that a holy
[1:02:05] person's taste is the is uh what's it
[1:02:08] called is the thinking man's filter and
[1:02:10] he says that it'll satisfy it will
[1:02:13] satisfy a holy person's taste that If
[1:02:15] you're a holy person, you will desire
[1:02:18] this which the prophet of God says this
[1:02:21] satisfies that the Holy Spirit in in
[1:02:24] you. This satisfies that and this is the
[1:02:27] message. As you can see, this is the
[1:02:29] message. And if you have the message,
[1:02:31] the message is the one that's going to
[1:02:32] satisfy a holy person's hunger or a holy
[1:02:35] person's desire. It's nothing else
[1:02:37] besides that.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And without the thing about this
[1:02:42] also he also speaks about I wanted to
[1:02:45] talk about humility a little bit because
[1:02:48] we find out u through the word through
[1:02:50] the preaching that humility is when you
[1:02:53] take your own thought and reject it and
[1:02:55] throw it away and you take what the
[1:02:56] prophet has said and you take it upon
[1:02:58] yourself. That mean whatever you thought
[1:03:00] could have been true you take it and you
[1:03:02] cast it out and you take whatever God
[1:03:05] said to be true and you take it and you
[1:03:07] pick it up. It doesn't matter how you
[1:03:09] feel about it. It doesn't matter what
[1:03:10] you think about it or any way that you
[1:03:12] feel about it. And a Christian is
[1:03:15] supposed to be one that humility should
[1:03:18] is supposed to be like a second nature
[1:03:19] to a Christian because you constantly
[1:03:21] have you're forced to be humble whether
[1:03:24] you want to or not. And I'm just going
[1:03:26] to use an example.
[1:03:28] For example, me sometime when I
[1:03:30] translate the thing is when the word
[1:03:33] comes forth let's say I'm translating
[1:03:35] for a minister and the word is coming
[1:03:38] forth as hard as it may be sometime you
[1:03:41] feel like you want to run away sometime
[1:03:42] you feel like you want to get up and go
[1:03:44] away but as a Christian you have to be
[1:03:45] humble you have to stay there and
[1:03:47] continue to interpret because someone
[1:03:48] else needs it just as if you're a
[1:03:50] believer you're standing in the pew and
[1:03:52] after the word of God is coming forth
[1:03:54] and it hurts and sometime you're like
[1:03:56] well it hurts sometimes Sometimes you're
[1:03:58] like, "Well, that's not me." Or your own
[1:04:00] thoughts will come in to try to fight
[1:04:03] the word of God. And because as human,
[1:04:07] we have our own filters that we like to
[1:04:09] process every word that comes forth
[1:04:11] instead of processing it with the word.
[1:04:12] The word of God comes in to help us
[1:04:15] understand God. Help us live our life
[1:04:18] rightfully. And and if I could use this,
[1:04:23] imagine let's say your parent they went
[1:04:27] they bought groceries and after they
[1:04:29] told you to organize the grocery you
[1:04:31] will have your own way to organize the
[1:04:33] grocery. But let's say you were working
[1:04:34] at a factory, you worked somewhere where
[1:04:36] they were teaching you how to organize
[1:04:38] certain things. Now they will teach you
[1:04:40] how to organize a certain things. But
[1:04:41] now when you go back home and your
[1:04:43] parents call you and say, "Well, I need
[1:04:45] you to organize the grocery. Put it up."
[1:04:47] Not the way you will be organizing the
[1:04:49] grocery is not going to be the way you
[1:04:51] want to organize it. But it will be
[1:04:53] filtered through the way you were taught
[1:04:55] at the factory. It will be filtered
[1:04:57] through that way. Or if usually our
[1:05:00] parents tell us go wash the car, go wash
[1:05:02] the car. But if you had someone else
[1:05:04] that was professional washing cars and
[1:05:06] showed you a procedure how to wash the
[1:05:08] cars, where to check for the dirt and
[1:05:10] everything and how to remove them. Now,
[1:05:13] when your parent would tell you to go
[1:05:14] wash something, you're not just simply
[1:05:16] going to wash it, but you're washing it
[1:05:18] while filtering your way of thinking,
[1:05:20] the way that you used to wash it through
[1:05:23] the person that taught you that. And
[1:05:25] that's the same thing a believer needs
[1:05:26] to do with the word of God. Because the
[1:05:28] prophet came, the prophet broke down
[1:05:31] everything for us. He gave us a a
[1:05:34] stature to look at, a standard to look
[1:05:36] at, and a standard to go by. And every
[1:05:38] single time you're listening to that
[1:05:40] standard, every single time you're
[1:05:41] reading it, you're feeding on it. It's
[1:05:43] supposed to help you meditate that
[1:05:46] whenever you're acting upon something,
[1:05:48] you're not just acting upon it, but
[1:05:50] you're filtering it through the word of
[1:05:51] God. You're filtering it to what the
[1:05:53] prophet says.
[1:05:56] And I just want to take um a moment
[1:06:00] because in um
[1:06:05] if
[1:06:06] because there's another scripture here.
[1:06:08] I didn't put it up there, but it's
[1:06:10] Philippians chapter 2
[1:06:14] verse 5.
[1:06:17] I'll try to jump a little. It says, "Let
[1:06:19] let nothing I mean verse five. Let this
[1:06:22] mind be in you,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; which was also in Christ Jesus, who
[1:06:27] being in who being in the form of God,
[1:06:31] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:06:34] God, but made himself of no reputation,
[1:06:37] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[1:06:40] and was made in likeness of men. And
[1:06:43] being found in fashion as a man, he
[1:06:45] humbled himself, and became obedient
[1:06:48] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[1:06:51] Wherefore God also have highly exalted
[1:06:54] him and given him a name which is above
[1:06:56] every name.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to just drop a little bit in
[1:07:00] verse 12. He says, "Wherefore, my
[1:07:03] beloved, as you have always obeyed, not
[1:07:06] as in my presence only, but now much
[1:07:10] more in my absence." This is speaking
[1:07:12] about integrity. Because integrity is
[1:07:14] doing the right thing even when nobody
[1:07:16] else is watching. And many believers,
[1:07:18] that's where they fail. They fail at
[1:07:20] using the thinking man's filter when
[1:07:22] nobody else is watching. That's where
[1:07:23] they end up backsliding because nobody
[1:07:25] else is looking at them. They're like,
[1:07:27] "Well, I guess I could slack off a
[1:07:28] little bit." And stuff like that. But
[1:07:31] when the scripture says, "But now much
[1:07:34] more that it's even more important for
[1:07:36] you to stick with the word to do the
[1:07:38] right thing when nobody else is
[1:07:40] watching."
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Work out your own salvation with fear
[1:07:44] and trembling.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] Now we Now back to humility.
[1:07:50] Um,
[1:07:53] back to humili humility.
[1:07:57] If I could read a a quote from the
[1:08:01] prophet
[1:08:06] back with humility because one part,
[1:08:09] brother Brandon was talking to um was
[1:08:11] talking about Samsung.
[1:08:14] He was because Samson at some point they
[1:08:17] had they had told Samson not to do
[1:08:19] certain things and they told Samson he
[1:08:21] had a role rule of things of what not to
[1:08:23] do and even his parents told him to stay
[1:08:25] away from certain type of uh woman
[1:08:27] specifically Delilah but he didn't
[1:08:29] listen then he found himself in trouble
[1:08:32] and brother Brandham now is talking this
[1:08:33] was after he was in prison after Samson
[1:08:35] was in p in prison in 1963 just one more
[1:08:39] lord brother Brandham says in paragraph
[1:08:42] 118 but he began to think God is still
[1:08:46] God. I know he is. I've tried him. I've
[1:08:49] got him to the test. I know he still
[1:08:52] remains God. It's me that's wrong. I'm
[1:08:55] the one that sinned. They didn't notice
[1:08:58] the tear running out of them blind
[1:09:00] socket dripping down of his chin. They
[1:09:04] didn't notice his lip moving. Lord, I've
[1:09:07] done wrong. Let me die with the
[1:09:09] Philistines.
[1:09:11] He wanted God's word manifested before
[1:09:14] the before that Jezebel more than he
[1:09:17] wanted his own life. See, at this point,
[1:09:21] um Samson had learned that he can't rely
[1:09:23] on his own proper desires. He can't rely
[1:09:26] on his own proper way of thinking. He
[1:09:27] humbled himself to the word to the point
[1:09:29] where he wanted the word to be
[1:09:31] manifested in his life. He didn't want
[1:09:33] his own life to be manifested, his own
[1:09:35] desire, but he wanted the word to be
[1:09:36] manifested in his life. Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says if that
[1:09:41] desire could could come to the church
[1:09:44] again. He wasn't praying for a new
[1:09:47] order, new denomination, but that the
[1:09:49] word of God might be made known again.
[1:09:52] The promise that he once had might come
[1:09:55] back to him again. He was aware of what
[1:09:59] would happen if this if his prayer was
[1:10:02] answered, but he was ready in in dead
[1:10:06] earnest in that earnest. Oh, if the
[1:10:09] church could only get like that, then he
[1:10:12] could cry out.
[1:10:15] And in investment
[1:10:17] 1962,
[1:10:18] in investment of um February 24th B,
[1:10:22] paragraph 64, that's what I say today.
[1:10:26] They say you can't have a Pentecost like
[1:10:30] they had then. People won't believe that
[1:10:33] stuff. You can't do it. We got to have
[1:10:36] the church. We've we got to have the
[1:10:38] organization. We got to have the
[1:10:40] education injected into it and so forth.
[1:10:43] If he worked back there to the
[1:10:46] illiterate fish fisherman who could take
[1:10:49] God at his word, if he hit the target,
[1:10:52] then if he healed the sick, if he raised
[1:10:56] the dead, he'll do the same thing today.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; If the right vibration pull on the gun,
[1:11:03] she will zero right in. If you don't go
[1:11:08] back and check up, you're gone.
[1:11:11] So, so go back, pick up the
[1:11:15] prescription, and find out where we're
[1:11:17] wrong at. That's the only way I know to
[1:11:20] do. But it'll do it cuz it cuz it hit
[1:11:24] before. Cuz it hit before. It'll hit
[1:11:26] again. If it worked for the apostles
[1:11:29] without denomination, without uh creeds,
[1:11:32] without Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian
[1:11:35] or what more? It worked for them on the
[1:11:38] word of God. It worked for me on the
[1:11:40] word of God. It'll work for you by the
[1:11:43] word of God. Over here, the prophet is
[1:11:45] talking about how you need to cast out
[1:11:47] your own reasoning. Cast out your own
[1:11:49] way of thinking and just rely on the
[1:11:51] word. Because some people will bring out
[1:11:52] their own way of thinking. Tell you,
[1:11:54] well uh it didn't work for them or in
[1:11:57] this day it's different. We live in a
[1:11:59] different age. But the same spirit, the
[1:12:01] Lord God does not change. The Lord God
[1:12:02] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:03] forever. And his way is absolute. And as
[1:12:06] a Christian, you're supposed to stick
[1:12:08] with the word of God. You're supposed to
[1:12:09] stick with every letter. Brother
[1:12:10] Brandham even spoke and gave um an
[1:12:14] analogy of a dove, saying that a dove
[1:12:16] does not eat dead meat, dead food. um
[1:12:20] not like old food. He's not uh like a
[1:12:24] raven or a vulture rather. He eats fresh
[1:12:28] food. He said a dove eats fresh food. If
[1:12:30] he tries to eat anything else but fresh
[1:12:32] food, he would vomit. The same thing
[1:12:34] with a Christian, a believer, you're
[1:12:36] supposed to eat fresh food of your day,
[1:12:38] the fresh food of your time, which is
[1:12:39] the word of which is the word that was
[1:12:41] sent through brother Brandham. That's
[1:12:43] the word. That's the fresh food of your
[1:12:45] day. And that's what you're supposed to
[1:12:47] rely on. If you eat any other thing, you
[1:12:50] will you're slowly killing yourself.
[1:12:52] You're killing yourself. Plain and
[1:12:53] simple.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And in fact, brother Brandham said that
[1:12:58] a holy person's taste is this. That mean
[1:13:01] if you're taking something else, you
[1:13:04] will not be satisfied. If you're
[1:13:05] watching other preachers, you will not
[1:13:07] be satisfied. You will always feel a
[1:13:09] need to search for something more. And
[1:13:11] you will not find more if you go to
[1:13:13] something else if it's not fresh a fresh
[1:13:15] meal.
[1:13:17] Now, brother Brennham says in continues
[1:13:21] still in investment he says I was
[1:13:24] reading the life of Martin Luther or the
[1:13:27] history and it said it wasn't such a
[1:13:29] phenomenon that Luther could protest the
[1:13:32] Catholic church and get by with it but
[1:13:35] the phenomenon was that the man could
[1:13:39] hold his head above all the um
[1:13:42] fanaticism that followed that followed
[1:13:45] his revival. That's right.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennan continues this time
[1:13:49] focusing on us today. That's the same it
[1:13:52] is today. It isn't much of a phenomenal
[1:13:55] to see people out of the organization
[1:13:58] and things but a man that can stay with
[1:14:01] the word and hold his head above all the
[1:14:04] finessism that try to follow such a move
[1:14:08] upon which the upon which is absolute
[1:14:11] fleshly as our previous brother quoted
[1:14:14] to us about creek about creek. So about
[1:14:19] Greek they go out the same thing flesh
[1:14:22] flesh denomination so forth but somebody
[1:14:25] can hold their head above above that and
[1:14:28] stay with thus says the lord it is true
[1:14:32] brother Brandham is talking about how a
[1:14:33] believer should always stick with the
[1:14:34] word of god he said that all the thing
[1:14:37] that's amazing is not that oh you can
[1:14:40] dress nice or or that you can
[1:14:44] that you're a part of an organization or
[1:14:46] something like that but the thing that
[1:14:48] makes that's amazing is when you stick
[1:14:50] with the word of God even throughout
[1:14:52] this whole entire age
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; and the thinking men's filter the thing
[1:14:58] that I like about it is you can apply to
[1:15:00] every aspect of your life everywhere
[1:15:02] that you go and I want to take this uh
[1:15:05] aspect when it comes to finance and
[1:15:07] investment you know when it comes to
[1:15:09] investment I like when the word um a
[1:15:13] couple a lot a while back when the word
[1:15:15] came forth and said that some of Some
[1:15:17] people would apply for lotteryies and
[1:15:19] stuff like that when they succeed and
[1:15:21] that they say praise the Lord God but
[1:15:22] they don't try to find out how they
[1:15:24] succeeded you see. But a thinking man's
[1:15:26] filter brother Brandham gave an analogy
[1:15:28] of um the rich young ruler. The rich
[1:15:32] young ruler the reason why he approached
[1:15:34] Jesus Christ is because he saw something
[1:15:36] in Jesus Christ that he could invest
[1:15:37] himself in. He saw that Jesus Christ has
[1:15:40] something that he did not. And he
[1:15:41] approached him to try to invest in him.
[1:15:43] But when he approached him, he couldn't
[1:15:45] invest because it was something that he
[1:15:47] wasn't he had one foot in, one foot out.
[1:15:50] He wasn't fully invested into it. And
[1:15:53] the thing is, brother Brandon was asking
[1:15:54] himself, how could a a young man as this
[1:15:57] reject something like that just like
[1:15:59] this in this modern day? How could the
[1:16:01] church, the Laudian church, rebuke God?
[1:16:04] Because you could have invested yourself
[1:16:06] in that. He had he had the opportunity
[1:16:08] to invest himself in something that's
[1:16:09] greater. But the only thing is he had to
[1:16:12] put in everything that he had.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham also speaks and
[1:16:18] talks in investment. He says, "And did
[1:16:22] you ever think, brethren, did you
[1:16:26] did you ever come to you in the
[1:16:28] scripture that they're very
[1:16:30] um pardon me
[1:16:35] in investment of 1962, the same one,
[1:16:39] paragraph 17, he says, "So this young
[1:16:41] man was like this great rich laudia age.
[1:16:45] Men was like this great rich like DCA
[1:16:48] age that we live in. They seen great
[1:16:50] opportunity to invest in something but
[1:16:54] it's not popular. Jesus was not the
[1:16:57] popular man in his day only among the
[1:17:00] poor and illiterate. The church of his
[1:17:03] day, the denomination of his day and the
[1:17:06] sect sectarian religions
[1:17:10] had nothing to do with him. But there
[1:17:13] must have been something about him that
[1:17:16] this rich young fellow seen in Jesus
[1:17:20] that he did not see in others
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and did have the common brother say he
[1:17:27] had at least at least he had common
[1:17:29] sense to approach him did have the
[1:17:31] common good sense to come and ask what
[1:17:34] he might do because he had seen in Jesus
[1:17:37] that there was a a quality that he
[1:17:40] didn't see in anyone else But you see he
[1:17:44] was very rich. The thing the things of
[1:17:47] the world we have lovely pictures of
[1:17:50] this and the leisia age in revelation
[1:17:54] because you say you are rich and have
[1:17:57] need of nothing yet knowest thou not
[1:18:00] that thou are wretched poor blind
[1:18:04] miserable naked and don't know it.
[1:18:06] Brother Brandham even talks um if you
[1:18:09] read investment both uh all five parts
[1:18:12] he even says that there were two young
[1:18:14] uh rich fellows and the other one was
[1:18:16] Paul when he saw the opportunity he
[1:18:19] invested he went in but the rich young
[1:18:20] ruler did not he did not invest in it
[1:18:23] and brother Brandon when he speaks about
[1:18:25] investment he says that most people look
[1:18:28] for the big events Jesus Christ was not
[1:18:30] a big event most people when they're
[1:18:31] trying to invest in something they see
[1:18:33] well they um everybody's going to this.
[1:18:36] Everybody's going to this, so I will
[1:18:38] join just because everybody's going to
[1:18:39] this. But you're supposed to study.
[1:18:41] You're supposed to study and know what
[1:18:43] you're going to invest in. Brother
[1:18:45] Brandham talks about a sound
[1:18:47] businessman. He doesn't just gamble. He
[1:18:49] doesn't just go in something and gamble.
[1:18:51] When you don't know what you're
[1:18:53] investing in and you're just applying
[1:18:55] and hoping you will get something, that
[1:18:57] is gambling. Whether you whether other
[1:19:00] people are succeeding or not, but you
[1:19:02] are you yourself are gambling. That's
[1:19:03] right.
[1:19:04] And the thing about um
[1:19:08] the other thing about investment,
[1:19:11] brother Brandham says,
[1:19:15] brother Brand says that we find this
[1:19:17] young fellow given the opportunity
[1:19:20] given the opportunity to do this to
[1:19:23] invest in Jesus Christ to invest in
[1:19:25] eternal life
[1:19:27] to invest. He turned it away because
[1:19:30] there was too much of a price of it. I
[1:19:32] think that's the same thing today. We
[1:19:34] don't want We don't want to. We don't
[1:19:37] want to admit it. We don't want to say
[1:19:39] that we don't, but our lives are proving
[1:19:42] it. That's proving it. That's exactly
[1:19:44] right. The Laudian pull him out of the
[1:19:47] church and he was not he was knocking.
[1:19:50] See, trying to get back in Laudia pull
[1:19:53] him out because they were rich. They
[1:19:56] need nothing.
[1:19:58] And brother Brand said, "If the
[1:20:01] Pentecost group wants more, as in if if
[1:20:06] you want more riches, you want more." If
[1:20:09] the Pentecost group wants more, you live
[1:20:12] right, you do right.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; See, if you want more, if you want to
[1:20:15] succeed, you live right and you do
[1:20:17] right.
[1:20:19] And he says, "God has got plenty to pay
[1:20:22] off with and bank open day and night,
[1:20:26] but you'll have you'll have to not say,
[1:20:29] "Well, I guess I'll go
[1:20:32] well, I guess I'll go up there once."
[1:20:35] And brother Brennan is talking about if
[1:20:36] you want to gain more, if you want to be
[1:20:38] rich and stuff like that, you have to
[1:20:40] live your life right and you have to be
[1:20:42] right. And the only way to live your
[1:20:43] life right and to be right is to use the
[1:20:45] thinking man's filter. the only way to
[1:20:48] be to live right and to live a godly
[1:20:51] life because brother Brennham in other
[1:20:52] places uh he was talking about how
[1:20:56] if you want to be rich in fact in Joseph
[1:21:00] if you look at the story of Joseph when
[1:21:02] Joseph gave the interpretation of the
[1:21:04] dream and at that pharaoh was asking him
[1:21:06] who can we put in charge of this and
[1:21:10] when it came to choosing Joseph Pharaoh
[1:21:12] has said that who is the person that's
[1:21:15] with God that you're going to need God
[1:21:17] because to live right you need God to
[1:21:19] begin with because God is right. So
[1:21:21] Pharaoh had told had asked who's the
[1:21:23] person that we could put in this that
[1:21:25] has that that has God with him that God
[1:21:28] is with him. So in investment when
[1:21:31] you're trying to invest even in real
[1:21:34] life when you're trying to invest always
[1:21:36] bring it back to the word of God check
[1:21:38] with the word of God see what does God
[1:21:39] say about it what does the prophet say
[1:21:41] about it and then you proceed based on
[1:21:43] that. You look at you look at what uh
[1:21:46] what's it called? What people are doing.
[1:21:49] You look you do research because brother
[1:21:51] Brand said when it comes to investment,
[1:21:53] you can't just keep your money in the
[1:21:55] bank or someone else will steal it.
[1:21:57] That's right.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Because if you think about it, if you
[1:22:00] leave your money in your savings and you
[1:22:02] do not move it, the other thing about it
[1:22:04] is that
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; The other thing about it is
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The other thing about it is
[1:22:13] that uh what's it called? When you leave
[1:22:14] your money in the bank, as the year goes
[1:22:16] on, the value of that money that you
[1:22:18] have put in the bank that you keeping
[1:22:20] save that you're not making a move and
[1:22:21] circulating around the value of that
[1:22:23] money is being decreased is is being
[1:22:26] decreased as the year goes along because
[1:22:28] back then 70 like a few cents was a lot
[1:22:31] of money. But now today, a few cents is
[1:22:34] not a lot. That mean if you're keeping
[1:22:35] your money in your savings, you're not
[1:22:37] going to advance. You're just your your
[1:22:40] value goes down. And brother Brandon
[1:22:41] talks about all that. And he also talks
[1:22:44] about when you're investing into
[1:22:45] something, you need to watch what you're
[1:22:47] investing in because when a lot of
[1:22:49] people start jumping in what you're
[1:22:50] investing in, that's when you should
[1:22:52] pull probably pull back because brother
[1:22:54] Brennham gives um gives an example of
[1:22:58] the the um the wise um virgins and the
[1:23:03] foolish the sleeping virgin rather. He
[1:23:06] says this in paragraph 64 in investment
[1:23:08] 1962 February 24 B. He says and you and
[1:23:13] did you ever think my brethren did you
[1:23:17] it ever come to you in the scripture
[1:23:19] that the day the very day that the
[1:23:21] sleeping virgin come to buy oil that was
[1:23:25] the day he come. Right.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; When when you see Greek Orthodox,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; especielians,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Methodists, Baptist, and Presbyterian
[1:23:41] coming in hungering for this as in this
[1:23:45] message, hungering for this. Where can
[1:23:48] where can we get this oil? Remember, it
[1:23:51] was that hour that the bridegroom came.
[1:23:53] Let's watch the investment where where
[1:23:55] where they pay off. Brother Brandon said
[1:23:59] when you're seeing a lot of people
[1:24:00] gathering when you're see first when
[1:24:02] you're investing maybe you might look
[1:24:03] little because Jesus Christ brother
[1:24:04] Brand said that Jesus Christ was not a
[1:24:06] popular person and the rich young ruler
[1:24:08] spotted it when Jesus Christ was not a
[1:24:09] popular person and then when a lot of
[1:24:11] people start gathering in that's when
[1:24:13] that's when uh the bridegroom came
[1:24:15] that's when Jesus Christ was also lifted
[1:24:16] when a lot of miracles started happening
[1:24:18] and people started getting a lot of
[1:24:20] people's attention and that's the same
[1:24:21] thing with this one here when the
[1:24:23] message is being forth a lot of people
[1:24:24] are rejecting a lot of people don't want
[1:24:26] it but when the rapture will You'll see
[1:24:28] a lot of people desire and try to seek
[1:24:30] for it.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And the same thing when you're investing
[1:24:33] in certain investment, you're seeing a
[1:24:35] lot of people are gathering to those
[1:24:36] investment because it works. It works.
[1:24:37] It works. And before you know it, when
[1:24:39] they that when that investment app or
[1:24:42] that investment application, whatever or
[1:24:44] organization goes down, they exit it and
[1:24:47] they turn it down. You're like, well, I
[1:24:49] invested this, I invested that, I lost
[1:24:50] in this that. You can start blaming it
[1:24:52] on brothers and sisters and whoever got
[1:24:55] you in them. But but the thing about
[1:24:57] investment is you had to watch what's
[1:25:00] happening. You had to watch the the
[1:25:02] things that are happening around you.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And you can't just invest to invest, but
[1:25:06] you have to invest with a with an
[1:25:10] intention with a thought a thoroughly
[1:25:12] thought out, filtered to to invent a
[1:25:15] diligent man.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[1:25:22] and the thing
[1:25:27] the other thing is in investment 1963,
[1:25:31] brother Brand says this. I'm not a
[1:25:32] writer.
[1:25:34] I'm not I'm not the writer
[1:25:38] that you fellow that you fellows are.
[1:25:40] But he was given a knowledge of a kid
[1:25:43] that I believe it was the unicycle. they
[1:25:45] had uh a competition
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and many other people were better
[1:25:48] writers than him.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; But everybody else thought he wasn't
[1:25:52] going to do it. He wasn't going to make
[1:25:53] it. He wasn't going to win. But when he
[1:25:55] got on it, he kept his eyes on the prize
[1:25:57] and he went in. He wasn't looking left
[1:25:59] or right. In fact, before he went in,
[1:26:01] when they asked him, "How did you do
[1:26:03] it?" He told him, "I've watched y'all
[1:26:04] how y'all did it. And the way y'all were
[1:26:07] doing, y'all would keep looking down and
[1:26:09] y'all were looking left and right. And
[1:26:10] when each time y'all look, y'all
[1:26:12] failed."
[1:26:13] So what before he got up there he
[1:26:15] analyzed he had he watched the way they
[1:26:18] did and after he filtered the way they
[1:26:20] did and when he got on it he invested he
[1:26:22] went straight forward keeping his eyes
[1:26:24] on the prize and brother Brandham
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and brother Brennham talks about when
[1:26:30] brother Brandon talks about that he says
[1:26:31] in paragraph 223 he says now businessmen
[1:26:36] don't look here your business may fail
[1:26:39] fail tomorrow
[1:26:42] might fail some other day but watch the
[1:26:45] end of the road and there is where your
[1:26:48] policy is going to pay off.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; This young fellow increased in goods but
[1:26:55] we find out his family pay off payoff
[1:26:58] they come
[1:27:00] his family payoff they come. He his
[1:27:03] greed goods so increased till till he
[1:27:07] found till he found till he found that
[1:27:10] he had to build new newborns. Oh, his
[1:27:13] business kept increasing. He stayed
[1:27:15] member of the church. You say yes. Yes,
[1:27:18] brother. That's right. He stayed a
[1:27:20] member of the church and one and one
[1:27:22] night he got so big till there was a man
[1:27:26] that was poor in spirit.
[1:27:29] You know, we don't have to be so poor in
[1:27:32] money. We'll have to get poor in spirit.
[1:27:35] Jesus said in Matthew 5, "Blessed are
[1:27:38] the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
[1:27:42] not organization
[1:27:44] the kingdom,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; and the poor in spirit laid at his gate,
[1:27:49] and he gave
[1:27:52] and he gave him a few crumbs." in or in
[1:27:55] other words when they passed by he might
[1:27:58] have g something in in the in the
[1:28:01] collection box or something or he might
[1:28:04] have said you know they're nice people I
[1:28:08] have nothing against them I will go to
[1:28:11] their breakfast once in a while you will
[1:28:14] furnish a few crumbs that might that
[1:28:16] might be so oh my wife belongs down
[1:28:21] there but me
[1:28:23] I admire
[1:28:24] my position with the business colleague.
[1:28:27] See, and he swept the crumbs off. In
[1:28:30] another place, brother Brandon talks
[1:28:31] about that the rich young ruler,
[1:28:33] although he was in in he although he
[1:28:36] didn't invest in God, he still
[1:28:37] prospered. He still prospered and then
[1:28:39] he ended up at hell. So when you're
[1:28:42] investing in something, you need to
[1:28:44] watch what you're investing. And I'm
[1:28:45] talking about the spiritual investment,
[1:28:47] not just investing in carnal things, but
[1:28:49] the spiritual investment. You need to
[1:28:50] watch what you're investing. And you
[1:28:51] need to invest yourself in the word. And
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says that when you
[1:28:58] invest yourself in the word, if you have
[1:29:01] a doubt in you, you might as well not
[1:29:04] invest until you're certain to invest.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Until you're certain to invest. That's
[1:29:10] when you should invest. You shouldn't
[1:29:11] invest when you have a doubt.
[1:29:15] And
[1:29:19] you have to be 100% sure that what
[1:29:21] you're doing, what you're investing is
[1:29:23] something good. It's something that's
[1:29:25] not just you investing.
[1:29:28] They're just you investing just because
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham has said in investment
[1:29:33] he said that I do not believe that
[1:29:35] anybody who loves Christ could set a
[1:29:38] meeting as take place in real
[1:29:41] spiritfilled Pentecost outpouring this
[1:29:44] day and see the very presence of Jesus
[1:29:46] Christ strike down upon the people and
[1:29:50] perform and perform and perform
[1:29:54] excuse me and perform and do the things
[1:29:56] that he promised. would be done in this
[1:29:59] day. The only way that you can is turn
[1:30:04] away that was in parenthesis. Turn away
[1:30:06] the opportunity that God gave you to
[1:30:09] become. What a rash thing the young
[1:30:12] fella did to turn away that opportunity.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And the thing is denomination are doing
[1:30:17] that today. Instead of accepting and
[1:30:19] embracing the Holy Spirit and forgetting
[1:30:23] their difference, they're they're
[1:30:26] separate,
[1:30:28] they separate their brotherhood and try
[1:30:30] to draw away little groups after their
[1:30:32] own following. And the other thing that
[1:30:35] I want to mention a little is concerning
[1:30:40] humility and investment.
[1:30:43] when you're not humble to the word of
[1:30:45] God
[1:30:46] because you're supposed to invest
[1:30:48] yourself completely to God because a
[1:30:49] Christian is 100% for the word because
[1:30:51] the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is 100%
[1:30:54] word and he only agrees with the word of
[1:30:56] God. And if you're a Christian, you're
[1:30:57] also supposed to agree with the word of
[1:30:58] God 100%. And when you're investing,
[1:31:00] you're supposed to invest in the word of
[1:31:02] God 100%. So when you're not being
[1:31:04] humble to the word when the word of God
[1:31:05] comes in and that the prophet says one
[1:31:07] thing and that that you choose to say
[1:31:09] well the prophet says that but I you
[1:31:11] have your own filter um thinking man's
[1:31:13] filter that you're applying to it when
[1:31:15] you're think when you have your own
[1:31:17] thoughts that you're applying to it and
[1:31:18] say well yes the prophet said that but
[1:31:20] you then you're adding a butt or you're
[1:31:21] adding a contradiction. That's you
[1:31:23] having one foot in one foot out. That's
[1:31:25] not you fully inside the message. That's
[1:31:26] not you putting yourself completely in
[1:31:28] there. You're supposed to put yourself
[1:31:30] completely in the word and let the word
[1:31:32] be the person who guide you. Let the
[1:31:34] spirit be the person to lead you in all
[1:31:36] righteousness and in all truth because
[1:31:38] the spirit of God that knows what's in
[1:31:41] the mind of God. And that spirit is the
[1:31:43] one that's going to help you, that's
[1:31:44] going to filter all your thoughts,
[1:31:46] that's going to filter who you are to
[1:31:48] resemble more like God.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the thing about the quote
[1:31:54] where it says that this satisfies that.
[1:31:57] I remember brother Brener also said when
[1:31:59] a baby is crying it cries till it's
[1:32:01] satisfied.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And it says this satisfies that. If
[1:32:04] you're not satisfied if you're reading
[1:32:05] and after you feel like you're not
[1:32:07] satisfied keep reading. At some point
[1:32:08] you will get satisfied. Keep asking God.
[1:32:10] Keep asking for the word the the flesh
[1:32:12] word and you will be satisfied at some
[1:32:14] point. If you if you have a need
[1:32:16] somewhere you have to keep asking.
[1:32:18] You'll be satisfied. Hallelujah.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And a think a man's filter
[1:32:24] um a thinking man's filter another way
[1:32:27] because like I said it could touch many
[1:32:29] um aspect of your life. The other way
[1:32:31] that it could touch it is the way you
[1:32:33] dress because a thinking man's filter if
[1:32:36] you which is this which is the word of
[1:32:38] God.
[1:32:39] If you use the word of God to filter the
[1:32:42] way you think the way you dress it will
[1:32:45] help you choose what to wear. Because we
[1:32:47] found out that Christians are also high
[1:32:49] priests and high priest dress a certain
[1:32:51] manner. They have a certain manner that
[1:32:53] they dress. They can't just wear
[1:32:54] whatever they want. They can't just put
[1:32:57] on whatever they want. They can't just
[1:32:58] step out however they want. They have to
[1:33:00] wear a certain garment and a certain
[1:33:04] level. Brother Brandham talks about how
[1:33:07] um when it's above the knees and stuff
[1:33:10] like that, it's be it's a naked it shows
[1:33:12] nakedness before God. It's showing
[1:33:14] nakedness before God. And a a Christian
[1:33:17] is not supposed to be naked before
[1:33:19] before God. Brother
[1:33:22] Brandham talks in
[1:33:27] Brother Brandham talks when he was um in
[1:33:31] the uncertain sound of 1955
[1:33:35] paragraph 83. Brother Brand says this.
[1:33:39] Now ladies, I want you to forgive to
[1:33:42] forgive me. I don't want to hurt your
[1:33:44] feelings.
[1:33:45] I'm not here to hurt your feelings. God
[1:33:48] knows it's not. But I'm here as a gospel
[1:33:51] preacher to let you know what's truth.
[1:33:54] Then you do you do with it whatever you
[1:33:57] wish.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:34:00] then when you go to then when you go to
[1:34:03] doing those things, you'll begin to
[1:34:05] reason
[1:34:07] this. If this woman can do if this woman
[1:34:10] can do it, she is well thought of. She
[1:34:13] goes to she goes to church. She lives in
[1:34:16] a rank of society. Why can't I do it?
[1:34:19] That's reasoning.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; When your when your soul tells you it's
[1:34:23] wrong. Bri Brandom says that it's
[1:34:25] reasoning when your soul is telling you
[1:34:27] is wrong.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Because the real you is in your soul.
[1:34:30] Your the real you knows what's right.
[1:34:32] Your soul knows what's right.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon continues to says
[1:34:36] that God covered women and men up. God
[1:34:41] covered women up and men up in the
[1:34:44] Garden of Eden. Never stripped them off.
[1:34:46] Never stripped them. In other words,
[1:34:50] when you're not dressed in a certain man
[1:34:52] and you're showing off your nakedness,
[1:34:54] that mean you're doing the opposite of
[1:34:55] what God instructed Adam and Eve. You're
[1:34:58] doing the opposite of what God's own law
[1:35:00] says because God said to cover up all
[1:35:03] the way. And if you listen to the word
[1:35:04] of God when the prophet comes in and
[1:35:06] that they telling you the way to dress
[1:35:08] and the scriptures is telling you the
[1:35:09] way to dress and how long or how short
[1:35:12] or even the painted face and everything
[1:35:14] like that when you listen to the word
[1:35:17] now whenever you're going to go do
[1:35:19] something you will be filtering whatever
[1:35:21] your action with what the prophet had
[1:35:23] told you
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; because even when it comes to preference
[1:35:26] because you you know we all have our own
[1:35:28] preference and when it comes to our
[1:35:30] preference the place where a lot of
[1:35:32] people fails a felt a lot is because
[1:35:35] it's our preference.
[1:35:38] Because it's our preference, we tend to
[1:35:41] go easier on the word. When it comes to
[1:35:43] preference, when it comes to when it
[1:35:46] comes to someone else's preference, you
[1:35:47] see that someone else is going against
[1:35:49] the word. You're ready to tell them that
[1:35:51] you're going against the word. You're
[1:35:53] ready to tell them that what you're
[1:35:55] doing is wrong. You're ready to judge
[1:35:58] them. You're ready to because the
[1:36:00] scriptures say iron sharpens iron. So
[1:36:02] you're ready to, you know, help them and
[1:36:04] say, "Well, you know, the scripture says
[1:36:05] iron sharpens iron, so I come here to
[1:36:07] help you." Because it's their preference
[1:36:09] and their preference goes against the
[1:36:10] word. But when it comes to your own
[1:36:12] preference, that's when you do not want
[1:36:14] to filter it. That's when you have you
[1:36:16] have after uh the word of God already
[1:36:19] came forth and instead of filtering it
[1:36:21] to the word of God, sometime you might
[1:36:22] even filter it through the word of God,
[1:36:24] then you then you make it go through
[1:36:26] your own filter. again right after
[1:36:28] getting um God's filter you make it go
[1:36:30] to your own filter that you decide to do
[1:36:31] it anyways and if you go by the word of
[1:36:34] the word of God brother Brennan even u
[1:36:37] was giving description
[1:36:39] I might um
[1:36:42] I'm just touching on this a little bit
[1:36:44] while brother Brennan was talking and he
[1:36:46] was giving um advices because I was I
[1:36:49] was doing research on it just looking at
[1:36:51] it brother Brandon said when it comes to
[1:36:54] choosing a wife and certain things you
[1:36:57] have to look for character not beauty
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; and when you listen to the word of God
[1:37:02] listen to the prophet when he says
[1:37:03] concerning those things that mean when
[1:37:04] it's your turn to look for one you will
[1:37:06] filter your desire you'll filter your
[1:37:09] preference with what the prophet said
[1:37:11] because if you're not filtering it with
[1:37:13] what the prophet said and that you might
[1:37:14] go to someone you might find a Jezebel
[1:37:17] person and that's your preference and
[1:37:18] that you might go to it and you didn't
[1:37:19] fil you didn't filter it brother
[1:37:21] Brennham said that Jezebel a woman
[1:37:24] that's dressed like that is basically
[1:37:26] dog food because Jezebel was fed to the
[1:37:28] dog. That mean if your desire, if your
[1:37:31] taste or woman that resemble to Jezebel,
[1:37:33] that mean your taste is equivalent to
[1:37:35] that of a dog. So whenever you're
[1:37:37] whenever you're doing something, you
[1:37:39] need to watch everything that you're
[1:37:40] doing. Even when it comes to choosing a
[1:37:42] bride, even when it comes to choosing a
[1:37:44] wife or even comes to choosing a
[1:37:46] husband, you need to watch in everything
[1:37:48] that you're doing
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; because
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; because some may say that, well, my
[1:37:54] parents prayed a lot. Well, did she
[1:37:56] pray? You need to check if her life is
[1:37:58] correct. You need to check if her
[1:38:00] character is correct. You also need to
[1:38:01] check if his life is correct or if his
[1:38:03] character is correct. You need to look
[1:38:04] for the character because the Holy
[1:38:06] Spirit checks for the character, not not
[1:38:08] the beauty. Because the scripture says
[1:38:10] that the beauty is decipherful. The
[1:38:12] beauty will deceive you in every way. So
[1:38:14] you need to look for the character
[1:38:15] because the character is the one. Bram
[1:38:17] says that
[1:38:19] the person that a husband chooses, a man
[1:38:23] chooses, she will be a reflection of
[1:38:25] you.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; She will be a reflection of everything
[1:38:27] that you do. That mean if you went after
[1:38:29] beauty and then her character is bad,
[1:38:32] that mean your character is bad. That
[1:38:34] mean the person that you are is bad.
[1:38:36] That's why you need to filter everything
[1:38:38] that you do. In fact, if you want a
[1:38:40] peaceful life, you need to filter every
[1:38:42] decision that you do through the word of
[1:38:43] God
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; because you know a lot of people when it
[1:38:48] comes to um choosing of bride and this
[1:38:52] for the sisters you would hear sometime
[1:38:53] a young man will come up and be like
[1:38:55] well you know I had a dream you know I
[1:38:57] had a dream and I saw in a dream. Well,
[1:38:59] the thing about dream, the things about
[1:39:01] dream, well, dreams has three um
[1:39:04] categories that I uh found out. Well,
[1:39:07] dreams it could either talk about your
[1:39:08] past,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; your present state or the future.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And the past maybe you passed through a
[1:39:14] trauma or something like that, so you're
[1:39:16] getting a dream about it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; The future maybe a blessing is coming.
[1:39:20] So, you get a dream about it. And the
[1:39:22] present maybe the circumstance that
[1:39:24] you're living in, God is giving you a
[1:39:26] warning or what you're doing. And the
[1:39:28] thing about dreams is maybe someone
[1:39:32] let's say a young man seen you and I
[1:39:34] think he has a desire for you. You see,
[1:39:36] since he already longs you, long for you
[1:39:39] for a long time, he will start
[1:39:41] fantasizing about you to the point where
[1:39:43] when he's going to go to go to sleep,
[1:39:45] the last thing that he thought about was
[1:39:47] you to the point that he's going to
[1:39:48] dream about you. Then when he's going to
[1:39:50] come to you and be like, well, you know,
[1:39:52] I had a dream about you. Was that dream,
[1:39:55] did it come from God or was it something
[1:39:56] you fabricated by your own desire? You
[1:39:59] see, that's the thing about it because
[1:40:02] the other thing I remember this is like
[1:40:06] a personal thing that uh I noticed one
[1:40:09] time I was um listening to the tape. I
[1:40:12] was listening to um the word of God. I
[1:40:14] was listening to the services preach and
[1:40:16] and the tape brother. So I went to sleep
[1:40:19] while leaving my phone playing. So as I
[1:40:21] was sleeping in the dream, it was me
[1:40:24] with like two other beloved and we were
[1:40:26] talking and we were talking about
[1:40:27] brother Brandham and in my dream I could
[1:40:30] hear the voice of brother Brandham in my
[1:40:32] dream
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; and I was playing that in my dream.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Then after a little while
[1:40:38] uh the scene changed a little and when
[1:40:40] the scene changed a little I started
[1:40:43] hearing a familiar but yet unfamiliar
[1:40:46] sound and I was like what is this? Then
[1:40:49] I started hearing the voice of Billy
[1:40:50] Graham when I was sleeping in a dream.
[1:40:52] And after that in my dream I turned it
[1:40:54] off. Then it came back on. I turned it
[1:40:56] off and I turned back the message. Then
[1:40:57] it came back on. Then later on I woke
[1:40:59] up. When I woke up I checked my phone
[1:41:01] and after I saw that my phone was
[1:41:02] playing Billy Graham. That's to show you
[1:41:04] that in your dreams your dreams is not
[1:41:07] just something that that happens. It
[1:41:10] happens because of the circumstance that
[1:41:11] you're living in. That mean if someone
[1:41:13] comes to you and say I have a dream and
[1:41:15] certain things like that you have to ask
[1:41:17] them did it come from God did it come
[1:41:20] from God and certain people will tell
[1:41:22] you I have a dream but they will not
[1:41:23] invest in you they will just say it but
[1:41:26] when it comes time to invest 100% in you
[1:41:28] they will back away they will back away
[1:41:31] so
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; you
[1:41:35] will back away and they would want
[1:41:36] nothing to do with it
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; and
[1:41:42] And brother Brennham when he gives uh
[1:41:44] what's it called? When brother Brennham
[1:41:46] is talking about choosing of a bride
[1:41:49] he's he's very specific and he talks he
[1:41:54] talks a lot about he emphasize about
[1:41:56] character a lot. He emphasized about you
[1:41:59] choosing the right person because it
[1:42:01] really reflects you and
[1:42:04] and he says the choosing is the man's
[1:42:06] role and the accepting is the is the
[1:42:07] woman's role. They're the one who's
[1:42:08] supposed to accept. And when you're
[1:42:12] accepting, you're supposed to filter
[1:42:13] whatever they're saying with the word of
[1:42:15] God. That's right.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture says that you're
[1:42:18] supposed to follow uh
[1:42:22] the husband supposed to be under Christ
[1:42:24] and you under the husband. That mean
[1:42:26] when you're following that husband, his
[1:42:28] head should be Christ.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; That mean you have the word of God. You
[1:42:32] have the message of the hour. That mean
[1:42:34] you already have Christ in your hand. So
[1:42:36] when someone else comes and they're
[1:42:38] giving you, they're presenting
[1:42:40] themselves to you, filter what they're
[1:42:42] presenting to you to the word of God.
[1:42:45] Filter it with the word of God because
[1:42:47] Christ is already there. So filter it
[1:42:49] through the through the thinking man's
[1:42:51] filter through the holy person's taste.
[1:42:54] Filter it through there. And by you
[1:42:55] filtering it through it through there,
[1:42:57] you will find out either it's a croak or
[1:42:58] it's not. It will tell you what you
[1:43:00] need.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; It will tell you what you need. In fact,
[1:43:04] that's where also um Samson failed
[1:43:06] because Samson, he went based on his own
[1:43:08] preference. He didn't go, they even
[1:43:10] warned him, they told him he did not
[1:43:11] filter his thought. He went based on his
[1:43:13] own preference. Like I said earlier,
[1:43:14] when it comes to your own preference,
[1:43:16] that's when people tend to backslid. But
[1:43:17] when it comes to someone else's
[1:43:18] preference, that's when you're quick to
[1:43:19] pull the trigger and and judge. Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; like I said, this subject touches many
[1:43:34] ground. And a thinking man, a thinking
[1:43:37] man's filter is supposed to also help
[1:43:39] you how to communicate, how to how to
[1:43:41] the word of God supposed to help you out
[1:43:43] to communicate, how to be a better
[1:43:45] person, a better Christian. Because the
[1:43:48] other day I was even reading the
[1:43:49] scripture. I was looking how Jethro was
[1:43:51] talking to Moses, how he was giving
[1:43:52] Moses advice because certain people when
[1:43:55] you're giving advice, they're quick to
[1:43:56] give advice. When you see someone is
[1:43:58] kind of deviating or something like
[1:43:59] that, you're quick to tell them, "Well,
[1:44:01] that's wrong, that's wrong, that's
[1:44:01] wrong." When I was watching Jeff talking
[1:44:04] to Moses, he was patient. He, in fact,
[1:44:06] he waited for Moses and he let Moses do
[1:44:09] it. After a certain period, that's when
[1:44:11] he came and he spoke to Moses. And after
[1:44:13] Mo, after he spoke to Moses, he first he
[1:44:15] let Moses speak, then he spoke and Moses
[1:44:17] let him speak. Then they they were
[1:44:19] having a perfect normal conversation.
[1:44:21] And when I was thinking about that, I
[1:44:22] was like, "Wow, that is very good.
[1:44:24] That's a perfect example of how to talk
[1:44:27] to people, how a father could talk to a
[1:44:29] son, and how a Christian should talk to
[1:44:30] another believer." Because the thing
[1:44:32] when the word of God come when you're
[1:44:34] reading every single word is supposed to
[1:44:36] help you be more like God. It's supposed
[1:44:38] to help you have a holy person's taste.
[1:44:40] That's why even um Esther when she was
[1:44:43] going and choosing the garment, she
[1:44:45] didn't choose it herself. She relied on
[1:44:47] he the the chamberlain. She relied on
[1:44:50] him. In fact, Hegar was her thinking
[1:44:52] man's filter. She did not rely on her
[1:44:54] own thought. She relied on Hega. She was
[1:44:57] she said, "You choose it for me." Even
[1:44:59] in Ruth when they were when um Naomi was
[1:45:02] talking to Ruth and on their way when
[1:45:04] they were going to when they were going
[1:45:06] back on their way, Naomi was instructing
[1:45:09] to Ruth. Now when they arrived at the
[1:45:12] land, Ruth everything that she did, she
[1:45:15] was filtering it to what Naomi had told
[1:45:17] her.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Even if you check in um in Ruth chapter
[1:45:20] 3, even when it came to choosing or
[1:45:24] choosing or even obtaining Boaz,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Naomi had instructed Ruth how to obtain
[1:45:29] him. And Ruth did not rely on her own
[1:45:32] way of thinking or the way u people from
[1:45:36] her land uh what's it called? Attract
[1:45:38] men. She relied on what Naomi had taught
[1:45:42] her and she went and after she obtained
[1:45:44] Boas through what Naomi had taught her
[1:45:46] and Naomi was Ruth's thinking man's
[1:45:48] filter. And in this hour in this day we
[1:45:51] have the message of the hour which is
[1:45:52] our thinking man's filter. The message
[1:45:54] of the hour is brought forth to help us
[1:45:57] process every our daytoday life.
[1:45:59] Everything that we're doing in our day
[1:46:01] it helps us use it. It helps us use it
[1:46:05] so we can come closer to God. So we can
[1:46:06] reflect God in all ways, in every way,
[1:46:09] in all path, in every path in our life,
[1:46:11] in everything that we do. Maybe um
[1:46:13] parenting, maybe marriage, maybe um
[1:46:17] fellowship, maybe friendship, maybe
[1:46:19] anything, even investment, maybe all of
[1:46:21] those, it help it comes to help us
[1:46:23] filter everything that we do.
[1:46:26] Everything. Even a pastor when he comes
[1:46:27] over here and says, "You always say, you
[1:46:29] always ask the pastor, you have a quote
[1:46:30] for everything." Of course, he needs to
[1:46:32] because that's the that's how a a man
[1:46:34] with a holy taste supposed to. He's
[1:46:36] supposed to rely on the word and
[1:46:38] supposed to filter on the word. And
[1:46:39] that's something not not only the pastor
[1:46:41] or preachers or minister are supposed to
[1:46:43] do, but everybody in the congregation.
[1:46:46] That's something everybody's supposed to
[1:46:47] do. Especially the youth, the youth tend
[1:46:50] to find it um they tend to find it a lot
[1:46:53] or annoying to
[1:46:56] to to always rely on the scripture, to
[1:46:59] always verify the scripture, to always
[1:47:00] filter things through the scripture. And
[1:47:05] and I'm just here to tell you, although
[1:47:06] it may seem annoying, it's good for you.
[1:47:08] It's supposed to help you. It's supposed
[1:47:10] to make you resemble Christ. is supposed
[1:47:14] to help you make a better investment
[1:47:16] when you're investing in Christ because
[1:47:17] that's what the thinking man's filter
[1:47:19] is.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; It's your protection. It's something
[1:47:24] that covers you
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; because the thinking man's filter like
[1:47:26] God, like brother Brandon said, God
[1:47:28] cover them up. And when the word of God
[1:47:30] comes, it comes in when the enemy comes
[1:47:33] like a flood, the word of God, the Lord
[1:47:35] God lift up his word as a standard
[1:47:37] because his word is the standard. As you
[1:47:39] see, each age is going forth. You see
[1:47:43] television and all those things, they're
[1:47:46] programmed as every single time you're
[1:47:48] watching them, every single time you're
[1:47:50] looking at them, every single time you
[1:47:52] see certain things on them, it's
[1:47:56] changing the way you think.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; And to the to the point where wherever
[1:47:59] you're doing, you're filtering it to
[1:48:01] whatever you watched,
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; to whatever you seen. Even little kids,
[1:48:05] little kids, they're like sponges that
[1:48:06] soak in everything. So when you show
[1:48:09] them certain things, they will replicate
[1:48:11] it. And when they're doing something,
[1:48:13] they will be thinking, well, this person
[1:48:15] did it this way, so I will do it this
[1:48:17] way. Because the way they saw, that's
[1:48:20] their filter. And the way television is
[1:48:23] programmed is to desensitize you. Is to
[1:48:25] remove God's filter and pull the the
[1:48:29] human's filter. The way you're thinking
[1:48:31] about it. The thinking filter that
[1:48:32] you'll be using now is no longer God's
[1:48:35] filter. But it's now the organization's
[1:48:38] filter is the social media's filter.
[1:48:41] It's what other people say. Like I had
[1:48:44] um a beloved once Tom send me because a
[1:48:47] lot of youth that I noticed in this
[1:48:49] generation, they tend to watch other
[1:48:52] people online instead of relying on the
[1:48:55] word of God,
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; especially for relationship advices
[1:48:58] instead of going to the word of God.
[1:49:00] Some people go to um Dr. Umar or
[1:49:03] whatever his name is. I don't know his
[1:49:05] name. They're so
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you could listen to
[1:49:09] that while having while being in the
[1:49:11] message. Honestly, I don't know how
[1:49:13] someone could listen to it while being
[1:49:14] in the message because what they're
[1:49:15] doing is completely wrong. And the way
[1:49:18] they're promote the way they're the way
[1:49:20] they speak even the the way um social
[1:49:23] media is promoting how to enter into
[1:49:25] relationship or how to find someone is
[1:49:27] completely wrong because now the youth
[1:49:30] when they come up they based on what
[1:49:32] they see now they're choosing based on
[1:49:35] um what they see on social media.
[1:49:37] They're filtering their choices and
[1:49:39] their desire based on that. Even trends
[1:49:42] nowadays people are going on trends
[1:49:44] instead of going based on their own
[1:49:46] desire. what fits them, their
[1:49:47] characteristic. They're relying on the
[1:49:49] trends. They're filtering their stuff by
[1:49:51] the trends. There are some people that
[1:49:53] cannot be themsel at all. They only want
[1:49:55] to be what the trends are. They they
[1:49:58] can't be an individual person. So,
[1:50:00] whenever a trend happens and after you
[1:50:02] tell them, well, brother, you shouldn't
[1:50:03] do that. You should be on this. They're
[1:50:05] like, well, so and so is doing this.
[1:50:06] Well, that's the trend. Well, you're not
[1:50:08] the trend. You're not supposed to filter
[1:50:09] it by the trend. You're a Christian.
[1:50:11] You're supposed to filter it by the word
[1:50:12] of God.
[1:50:14] And the other thing is
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; the other thing that is even um that I
[1:50:21] also want to mention because when it
[1:50:24] comes to
[1:50:26] trans preferences and all those even
[1:50:29] when it comes to choosing someone
[1:50:32] a lot of you even someone seem like he
[1:50:35] may be quiet or something you should
[1:50:36] always test him. you should always check
[1:50:39] their character because recently
[1:50:41] recently um not so recently but I
[1:50:45] remember a coworker of mine that I was
[1:50:47] speaking to I was he didn't even know
[1:50:49] what I was going to minister but I was
[1:50:51] talking to him and he was talking to me
[1:50:52] how
[1:50:54] for those who know the scripture you
[1:50:56] would know what what it means but he was
[1:50:57] talking about how he was going to meet
[1:50:59] uh another girl and I think he was going
[1:51:01] to know her that's what he was talking
[1:51:03] about and the way he was breaking it
[1:51:05] down the way he was he had a whole plan
[1:51:06] of manipulation
[1:51:08] And when I saw that I was like his
[1:51:10] filter is completely wrong. It is
[1:51:12] completely wrong because what I seen
[1:51:14] what he was saying because I remember
[1:51:15] when we were in the youth meeting the
[1:51:17] word had came forth and that they was
[1:51:19] talking and that they were not seeing
[1:51:20] what the word has said. I was like that
[1:51:22] is so lovely. Then another thought came
[1:51:24] in. I was like if he felt on the wrong
[1:51:25] person's ear they would use it so bad.
[1:51:28] And here I am seeing the person who had
[1:51:30] the wrong interpretation of of those
[1:51:32] thing. I don't know where he got it
[1:51:33] from, but the way he was describing how
[1:51:35] he was going to make the person fall was
[1:51:39] completely bad to the point where he
[1:51:41] said something that was unsettling. He
[1:51:44] said that I will make her reject her
[1:51:46] belief, her religion, and everything. I
[1:51:48] was like, by the way, he was going to
[1:51:49] manipulate. So whenever you're choosing
[1:51:52] someone, just because he's speaking
[1:51:53] nice, just because he's telling you,
[1:51:54] well, you look good, you should filter
[1:51:56] it through the word because that's why
[1:51:59] the parents and your brethren and your
[1:52:00] beloved, that's why your parents are
[1:52:02] there to tell you you look good. Yeah,
[1:52:03] you're supposed to rely on that. But
[1:52:05] some people when their parents tell them
[1:52:06] you look good, you're like, well, that's
[1:52:08] my dad. But when the random person comes
[1:52:09] in and tell you you look good, that's
[1:52:10] when you're happy. You're you're saying
[1:52:12] that it's so sweet. Oh, well that's
[1:52:14] different. That's my dad, but that's is
[1:52:15] different. This the person and stuff
[1:52:17] like that. you're so quick to attach
[1:52:19] yourself to someone. And I'm telling
[1:52:20] you, don't be quick to attach yourself
[1:52:22] to someone because that person could be
[1:52:24] manipulating you just to make you fall
[1:52:26] because you don't know who who the
[1:52:28] person that you're dealing with. So
[1:52:30] whenever someone comes to you maybe
[1:52:32] about anything or any aspect in your
[1:52:34] life, I want you to take it and filter
[1:52:36] it through the thinking man's filter,
[1:52:38] which is this, which is this word, which
[1:52:41] is the message of the hour, which is
[1:52:42] that that satisfies it. Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Which is that that satisfying just make
[1:52:47] it go through that filter.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to read one quote. I
[1:52:53] want to read a quote. So just to wrap
[1:52:56] up. I know it's a Wednesday service.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said if the musician
[1:53:06] could come up. Brother Brennham said um
[1:53:09] in just one more time
[1:53:12] 1963 December the 1st in the evening
[1:53:15] paragraph 120 he says slowly he was
[1:53:19] praying it's possible Lord
[1:53:22] it's possible Lord it's possible I stand
[1:53:25] here all my big frame is still together
[1:53:28] I'm here my hair has grown out but I
[1:53:31] couldn't see how to whip them no more
[1:53:34] see Samsung's own thinking man filter
[1:53:38] couldn't help him. He completely failed
[1:53:40] him. His eyes was his thinking man's
[1:53:42] filter cuz he relied on it. And that
[1:53:44] completely failed him. One, it brought
[1:53:46] him to prison. And now when they took
[1:53:48] off his eyes, he didn't have his eyes.
[1:53:50] He couldn't rely on it at all.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And God removed what what
[1:53:57] caused him the trouble. That's why God
[1:53:58] said if a hand is causing you a
[1:54:00] hindrance, you need to cut it off. You
[1:54:01] need to cut it completely off.
[1:54:04] And brother Brennan continues and he
[1:54:07] says,
[1:54:09] "His hair growled out, but I couldn't
[1:54:10] see how to whip them no more because my
[1:54:13] eyes is blind. I couldn't see where I
[1:54:16] was going. But it's possible that you
[1:54:18] would let it happen again, Lord, to slow
[1:54:21] your power to to show your power." He
[1:54:25] screamed out once more, Lord. Just once
[1:54:28] more. Oh, if the church could only cry
[1:54:31] once more, Lord, let us see your power.
[1:54:34] If we could just return back to the
[1:54:36] original. If we could just return back
[1:54:37] to the thinking man's filter once more.
[1:54:40] And he cried out, asked God. I can see I
[1:54:44] can see that muscle begin to swell.
[1:54:46] After he asked God, that's when he
[1:54:47] started seeing the muscles begin to
[1:54:49] swell. And he wasn't seeing it by his
[1:54:51] own filter. He started seeing it because
[1:54:53] he said his eye socket was bleeding out.
[1:54:55] So, he clearly couldn't see it. Then he
[1:54:58] said he started seeing his uh muscles
[1:55:01] began to swell. Every fiber in his body
[1:55:05] being begin to twist. See at this point
[1:55:08] Samson had taken everything that he had
[1:55:10] and invested it in God.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; He had invested it in God.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; And now he's he's seeing the result of
[1:55:17] it. Now the Holy Ghost was coming up was
[1:55:22] coming upon him. Then he stretched forth
[1:55:24] his hand again with the power of the
[1:55:26] Holy Ghost upon him. Down went the
[1:55:29] building. The Bible said he killed more
[1:55:32] that day than he did all the rest of the
[1:55:35] of his days. He filled the commission
[1:55:38] God gave him then once more. See, by him
[1:55:42] being humble, humbling himself to the
[1:55:45] word of God and investing completely to
[1:55:47] the because if you're humble, you're
[1:55:48] supposed to put everything, which is a
[1:55:50] type of investment. You're putting
[1:55:51] everything to receive the word of God
[1:55:53] and to do the the works of God, to do
[1:55:56] what God had ordained you to do. And by
[1:55:58] him doing that, God used him to to do
[1:56:01] the greatest thing that he's ever done
[1:56:03] in his whole career.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And this the last quote in 1961,
[1:56:11] sir, we would see Jesus. Paragraph 46,
[1:56:13] brother Brandon says, "Grant it, Lord,
[1:56:15] that this may be vital things to the
[1:56:18] people that they might grasp these
[1:56:21] little truth and hold on to them and
[1:56:24] remember that someday that each of us
[1:56:27] will have to stand in your August
[1:56:30] presence and give an account for every
[1:56:33] thought that goes through our minds.
[1:56:36] So give me and my people and your
[1:56:41] children upon the earth clean, holy,
[1:56:45] faithful thoughts
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; that we might not disassociate ourselves
[1:56:51] from words knowing that thy word is
[1:56:55] truth and that you are the infinite,
[1:56:57] infallible, omnipresent, omnisient God
[1:57:00] and omnipotent.
[1:57:02] The prophet of God is saying that we
[1:57:04] need to rely on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:06] that he is the filter that we need to um
[1:57:09] to rely on. He's the filter. We need to
[1:57:11] rely on his mind because he gives us a
[1:57:14] clean and holy faithful thoughts. He say
[1:57:16] that we need to rely on him because
[1:57:17] that's that's a holy person state holy
[1:57:20] person's taste. If you want to have a
[1:57:21] holy person's taste because brother
[1:57:23] Brandon says that there is no man that's
[1:57:25] holy beside God.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that's holy beside God
[1:57:28] himself. God is the only person that's
[1:57:29] holy. So if you want to have a holy
[1:57:31] person's taste that mean if you want to
[1:57:32] have God's taste you need to use the
[1:57:34] thinking man's filter which is Jesus
[1:57:36] Christ which is is which is his word and
[1:57:40] and you need to also invest yourself as
[1:57:42] you're using it you have to not when
[1:57:44] you're using that thinking man's filter
[1:57:47] the word of God comes and he tells you
[1:57:48] what to do don't just stop at listening
[1:57:51] the word but you need to do it also you
[1:57:52] need to invest yourself completely in it
[1:57:55] you need to put yourself into it
[1:57:57] completely and you know a lot of people
[1:57:59] are investing in, you know, crypto,
[1:58:02] different type of crypto and stuff like
[1:58:03] that. You know, Bitcoin is everything,
[1:58:04] right? And I'm here to tell you the best
[1:58:07] investment that you can invest in, the
[1:58:09] best type of crypto you can invest in is
[1:58:11] I call it the bit seed, which is the
[1:58:14] mustard seed. It's very small, but when
[1:58:16] it grows, it grows very big. You see,
[1:58:19] you will reap a lot more. So, may the
[1:58:22] Lord God bless the sermon.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; If we could all stand and go to the Lord
[1:58:26] in prayer.
[1:58:36] Lord heavenly father, we come before
[1:58:38] you, Lord Jesus Christ. We come before
[1:58:40] you to thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for
[1:58:42] your word, for your word that was
[1:58:43] brought forth, Lord God. I thank you,
[1:58:45] Lord God, for the message that you sent
[1:58:48] forth, Lord God, to help us understand
[1:58:50] the Bible, Lord Jesus Christ. Because
[1:58:52] the message is our filter, Lord Jesus
[1:58:54] Christ. The Bible is our filter, Lord
[1:58:55] Jesus Christ. And I pray that you may
[1:58:57] help us be humble enough, Lord Jesus
[1:58:59] Christ, and to invest in it completely.
[1:59:01] And when we invest, help us be patient,
[1:59:03] Lord Jesus Christ, that to wait upon
[1:59:05] your word, Lord God, and to do only what
[1:59:08] your word say, Lord heavenly father, not
[1:59:09] to rely on what we think or what we say
[1:59:12] or what our desires, our own feelings
[1:59:14] says, Lord Jesus Christ. And sometimes,
[1:59:16] Lord, heavenly father, the word for the
[1:59:17] word may come forth and he may hurt us,
[1:59:19] Lord Jesus Christ. He may hurt us down
[1:59:21] deep down in our soul, Lord God. and
[1:59:23] sometime when he hurts us Lord God just
[1:59:25] to show to the people especially if
[1:59:27] we're if for those of us that are known
[1:59:29] especially if you're known Lord Jesus
[1:59:31] Christ if they're in a high position
[1:59:33] Lord God and the word of God comes in
[1:59:35] that is trying to correct you but
[1:59:37] because you're hurt because you have
[1:59:41] your own pro um preference because you
[1:59:44] have your own ego because you have your
[1:59:47] own pride instead of being humble to the
[1:59:49] word you start trying to compromise you
[1:59:51] start to even reject the word without
[1:59:53] even realizing you're rejecting the
[1:59:54] word. So I pray to I pray Lord heavenly
[1:59:56] father that you may come in and remove

[2:02:44] If the pastor could come forward,
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; A thinking man's filter. Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] There's a whole message on that.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; A whole message. And by God's grace, if
[2:03:10] you had a chance, just go play that
[2:03:12] message and you will glean more more
[2:03:14] more more out of it. Amen.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh
[2:03:20] it's a shame thinks that uh
[2:03:25] message believer are getting into it.
[2:03:27] And I know it's the the age and the and
[2:03:31] the pressure and the survival mode and
[2:03:34] the Holy Spirit come down on Sunday and
[2:03:36] begin to correct and to tell us that
[2:03:39] your trouble is not in what you're
[2:03:41] looking for. That's why we try many
[2:03:43] times and it's not working. Our trouble
[2:03:46] is in our habit. It's the habit that put
[2:03:49] us into a trouble mode. Amen. And once
[2:03:53] you're in that mode, you begin to suck
[2:03:55] everything. There is a pyramid scam that
[2:03:58] was going on
[2:04:00] and the people got stuck into it. A lot
[2:04:03] of message believer got stuck into it
[2:04:07] and finally they closed.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; So people are crying. It's all over the
[2:04:13] news.
[2:04:14] uh the message WhatsApp chat you see
[2:04:17] people somehow making fun of other that
[2:04:19] they were that were stubborn because
[2:04:21] what they do is they tell you bring
[2:04:23] somebody in and then bring somebody in
[2:04:25] and bring somebody in and and before you
[2:04:27] know it you see people really happy
[2:04:30] prosperity have come now they invest
[2:04:32] they invest and they came with a with a
[2:04:34] catch and then they brought more money
[2:04:36] as soon as a lot of people came the
[2:04:39] whole thing disappeared boom
[2:04:44] So when we see you not clapping hand, I
[2:04:46] wonder where were you at online.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; If I if I don't say something now and I
[2:04:57] will begin to say on Sunday, you will
[2:04:59] cut my time and then I have to stop and
[2:05:02] then move on to the next sermon. So can
[2:05:04] I say something?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Stay away from crypto
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; if you don't know what you're doing.
[2:05:12] Do you understand me?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Whoever is on the camera, make sure you
[2:05:16] focus on me. I don't want people in this
[2:05:19] church,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; young people, especially young people,
[2:05:23] because it's striking young people. I
[2:05:25] don't want you in crypto.
[2:05:29] I know it's going to go all over the
[2:05:30] internet. Brother Steven say, "Oh, he
[2:05:32] doesn't want people in cryp." I have I
[2:05:34] have a whole uh what do you call a
[2:05:37] document that I have quote that I
[2:05:39] already laid out. So if you come you you
[2:05:41] you want to fight you come then I will
[2:05:44] just turn the the machine gun on and
[2:05:47] then and then and then handle you. Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Do you know what crypto means?
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Who own crypto?
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not just you guys talk about crypto
[2:05:59] crypto crypto. I'm asking you now a
[2:06:00] question. Who own crypto? Who is the
[2:06:03] owner of? You see you don't even know
[2:06:05] the owner of crypto.
[2:06:07] But when they tell you, you know, I'm
[2:06:10] doing crypto, I'm doing crypto. Boom,
[2:06:11] boom, boom. And the me I I know what I'm
[2:06:14] talking about. People are crying all
[2:06:15] over the message. The people that got
[2:06:17] into it's a pyramid. They suck people
[2:06:19] into it.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And I even got a video
[2:06:24] where they went where the place was in
[2:06:27] Texas and the and and the FBI is
[2:06:29] involved on it and things like that
[2:06:31] because of getting into this type of
[2:06:34] stuff among young people. So God knew if
[2:06:36] I come down on it, I would take the
[2:06:38] whole building down. So God took a young
[2:06:40] people, a young man to to handle you
[2:06:43] very good. So you know what he's talking
[2:06:45] about. So I have to say this
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; so that no one in this church, young
[2:06:51] people, you who have friend in other
[2:06:53] churches who who bring you crypto, we
[2:06:56] can make money in stock market. Uh
[2:06:58] you're going to go down.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I know people who lost money in the
[2:07:03] stock market. I also lost money in the
[2:07:06] stock market. So I know what it is.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; I was the one who told my broker buy
[2:07:13] this thing and the broker is telling me
[2:07:15] something and it's not making money and
[2:07:16] I told him I said look at this and mine
[2:07:18] was working. So I begin to learn a lot
[2:07:21] of stuff into this type of if you don't
[2:07:24] and and it's a thin line in the stock
[2:07:26] market between really investing and
[2:07:29] gambling.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; You play around you in gamble. Amen.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; You're not investing. You play around
[2:07:34] just a thin line. If you play around in
[2:07:37] a stock market, you find yourself
[2:07:38] gambling
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; instead of in. There is investment.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; But there is gambling. And gambling is
[2:07:44] more popular than investment.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, this one say get in our program,
[2:07:51] start paying $200, and then we going to
[2:07:53] buy stock. Hey my friend, your pastor.
[2:07:57] That's why I say to be a pastor,
[2:08:00] it's a full coverage.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not throwing that. I'm talking to my
[2:08:05] church. Okay. Uh to be a pastor, it's
[2:08:08] not just preach the word, preach the
[2:08:11] marriage, financial, you you you got to
[2:08:13] because the devil is shooting
[2:08:15] everywhere.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; What does crypto why why is your bank
[2:08:19] not dealing with crypto? Mhm. Go ahead.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Why is Bank of America not dealing with
[2:08:24] crypto?
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Why do you have to be on Kraken?
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Why do you have to be in Coinbase? Some
[2:08:30] of you are going ding ding because I'm
[2:08:33] catching you.
[2:08:35] Why do if you don't want I close. I let
[2:08:38] you. You continue on your stuff. If you
[2:08:40] don't want, I close. Hey me, I'm fine. I
[2:08:43] already know how to stay away from it.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Coinbase.
[2:08:54] Where are my stuff?
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Spirit spoke. So it
[2:09:01] means somebody is either on the verge or
[2:09:04] somebody's sucking to this thing and
[2:09:05] they lost money
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; or somebody's trying to do it
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; or somebody his wife is mad.
[2:09:14] I'm I know what I'm talking about
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; because his wife said no and the person
[2:09:18] insisted and now the family is on fire.
[2:09:22] I have a brother I I I I know a brother
[2:09:24] in the message came to me say brother
[2:09:27] Steven there is this investment
[2:09:29] investment I call him I say come sit
[2:09:31] down he started my I say are you sure
[2:09:33] about this investment he say yes I say
[2:09:35] go ahead and sign me a paper here I
[2:09:37] still have the paper I can sue him
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; but I won't do it because before you cut
[2:09:42] it amen I say me the paper
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I took the money I gave it to him sir
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; it didn't take two months the whole
[2:09:50] thing boom down. He's coming with
[2:09:52] explanation, sending me a text. Oh, we
[2:09:54] know what I say. You see, I can even sue
[2:09:56] you.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Give me money.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not I know what I'm talking about.
[2:10:06] Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; This is Which bank do you want me to
[2:10:12] take?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; We in America.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; This is Bank of America.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:21] Bank of America. Bank of America have a
[2:10:24] lot of high protection.
[2:10:27] You will understand what I'm saying.
[2:10:29] Plus FDIC.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; You see that on your car? You don't even
[2:10:33] know what it means, right? It is FDIC.
[2:10:36] So, in other words, if somebody stole
[2:10:38] your money, you can call the bank and
[2:10:40] the bank can return money back to your
[2:10:41] credit card. Even though they don't they
[2:10:43] they have not uh I mean caught the the
[2:10:46] the robber yet but you still have some
[2:10:49] security and everything. So your Bank of
[2:10:52] America is right here. Your your crypto
[2:10:56] doesn't want to deal with Bank of
[2:10:57] America
[2:10:59] because if he get through Bank of
[2:11:01] America the whole FBI system the whole
[2:11:05] bank system is watching crypto.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And Bank of America belongs to the
[2:11:10] United States. So this is what they do.
[2:11:12] They tell you move from here.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; This is your home.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; This is your house.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; I I believe you begin to understand.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Then they say we can't deal with you in
[2:11:25] your house.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Because mama is watching.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Because daddy's watching.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; You too you too tight.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Your pastor is too difficult.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Your pastor uh can you sit down because
[2:11:42] Uh hey let me let me nail the devil a
[2:11:45] little bit. Okay.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; I am not taking away what he preach
[2:11:49] because sometime I make comment and
[2:11:50] somebody say no you took the your
[2:11:52] comment took now the people are there so
[2:11:55] I have to kill that thing down I suffer
[2:11:57] a lot with certain things. Okay so in
[2:12:00] your home that is too much
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; brother Steven is too much
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; there is a lot of regulation about
[2:12:07] courtship a lot of this. So it's too
[2:12:10] much to get you in your church.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:12:15] We can't deal with you.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; We have to go through your daddy to your
[2:12:20] mommy. We have to go through Bank of
[2:12:22] America. We got to go through the
[2:12:23] clearing house.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; So the crypto people say, "Come out from
[2:12:30] your house.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Leave Brother Steven Church a little
[2:12:34] bit. Come out.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Leave your parent home a little bit. Let
[2:12:38] me meet you at the park.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Not in your home. In your home, daddy
[2:12:42] put a ring. So if I ring, they already
[2:12:45] recorded me. And on the backyard, there
[2:12:47] is a camera. All around spoken way,
[2:12:50] there are camera everywhere. If we go
[2:12:52] talk over there, there is a camera.
[2:12:53] Brother Robert is watching you. Brother
[2:12:55] Set is watching you. Everybody's
[2:12:57] recording you. So come out. Let's go a
[2:12:59] little bit out.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Uh, you want me to close it?
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then they say, "Come out from your
[2:13:08] house." Sorry, Sister Lily. I forgot
[2:13:10] about you. All right. They say come out
[2:13:12] from your house.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; So how do you come out? They say no no
[2:13:16] you come out because what they doing
[2:13:19] they have crypto.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; This is like an electronic money.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? This is your US dollar.
[2:13:28] It's paper. You see this? This is
[2:13:30] virtual.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; This one is like an ocean.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; It can go to any country. No problem.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; For you to move dollar to the euro, you
[2:13:42] got to go through a process.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; But crypto is easy. Cryp crypto can
[2:13:47] immorate to anything.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understanding.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; If you got crypto, crypto can become US
[2:13:54] dollar, Canadian dollar,
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Congo money, uh European money. Crypto
[2:14:00] can go everywhere.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; So they say come out from your house.
[2:14:07] How do you come out? They say no, no,
[2:14:08] no, no. We sell crypto. We are trading
[2:14:12] on crypto. Your dollar cannot come out
[2:14:15] over here quickly. We don't want to deal
[2:14:16] with your parent. So you move from here
[2:14:19] to what they call Coinbase
[2:14:22] or Kraken or your whatever bank you have
[2:14:26] like it's a bank that deal with uh uh
[2:14:31] trading.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when you begin to
[2:14:34] move here, America begin to ask more
[2:14:37] security.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; They say this bank say you know what we
[2:14:40] need to be protected by the United
[2:14:42] States. Give your ID,
[2:14:45] scan your driver license
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and scan your address. Give your social
[2:14:49] security
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; because now you already outside the
[2:14:52] house.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because they don't want
[2:14:56] the FBI to come back on them and they
[2:14:58] say, "Hey, you guys are dealing with
[2:14:59] crooks over there." They say, "No, no,
[2:15:01] no. We ask so and so." The ID we confirm
[2:15:04] we confirm the address we confirm it in
[2:15:06] United States they American citizen but
[2:15:08] they just want to go into international
[2:15:11] trading
[2:15:13] right
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; your money move from here $1,000
[2:15:18] the $1,000 is here when you get here
[2:15:22] they say no no no we not going to deal
[2:15:23] with you here because America still have
[2:15:26] restriction with Kraken here are we
[2:15:28] together they say now take your money
[2:15:31] and buy crypto.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Once your money leave Kraken or Coinbase
[2:15:41] or whichever bank you have, once you get
[2:15:44] into crypto,
[2:15:46] that's it.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Now, even America,
[2:15:51] even the United States doesn't get here.
[2:15:57] So, here they gave you a fake portal.
[2:16:01] They tell you you have $1,000
[2:16:04] and you have so and so share
[2:16:08] or you enter into a business where
[2:16:10] people are riding bikes
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; in China and you are here in the US. You
[2:16:15] own a business in China in Hong Kong
[2:16:19] and they will start giving you money
[2:16:21] every week.
[2:16:24] This happened. I'm not telling you
[2:16:26] story. It just happened. They just
[2:16:28] closed the whole thing. Are we together?
[2:16:30] Over here there is no country, no United
[2:16:33] State, no nothing. You need the FBI to a
[2:16:36] high level to start getting into this.
[2:16:38] Once your money is right here in crypto
[2:16:43] for you to recuperate your money, do you
[2:16:46] follow me?
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; You got to sell this first and come back
[2:16:49] again here.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Then you move from here and you come
[2:16:53] back again here. And when you get here,
[2:16:56] Coinbase say, "Hey, you got a lot of
[2:16:58] money. Let me give you seven days to
[2:17:00] verify where did this money comes. So to
[2:17:03] leave here quick boom you're here
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; very quick
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; up here quick but to come back here it's
[2:17:10] another problem. So once you are right
[2:17:12] here completely outside of your home
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; are we together? This is when you go buy
[2:17:24] your cryptocurrency.
[2:17:26] And what they did, they would do, they
[2:17:28] will open up a website over here. And
[2:17:31] this website have nothing to do with
[2:17:34] this bank. It has nothing to do with
[2:17:36] your portal bank right here.
[2:17:40] So all your money is right here. The day
[2:17:42] they close the website, you don't even
[2:17:45] know which country they are.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; You don't even know where they came
[2:17:49] from. You don't even have a C. Even if
[2:17:51] they put a customer service, they can
[2:17:53] close the customer service and you don't
[2:17:55] know and before you know it, you are
[2:17:56] dealing with somebody maybe in China,
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; maybe in Russia, maybe somewhere else
[2:18:03] that you have even no clue.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; And once it's gone here, nobody can even
[2:18:10] trace it.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; So what they do, they get your money in
[2:18:14] crypto. If they in China, they take the
[2:18:16] crypto, they transfer it to Chinese
[2:18:19] and they get the money in China and you
[2:18:21] are here in the United States.
[2:18:26] If you look at this thing right here, it
[2:18:28] shows you the devil.
[2:18:32] Leave your parent home. Move up a little
[2:18:35] bit. No, no, no, no, no. Here there is
[2:18:36] too much security. We still right here.
[2:18:39] Move away from security. When you are
[2:18:41] completely isolated, then all hell will
[2:18:46] break loose on you and before you know
[2:18:48] it, every money is completely gone. And
[2:18:51] people are crying in the messes. Some
[2:18:54] put $10,000, some more than $10,000.
[2:18:57] It's all over the state. They're crying.
[2:18:59] The guys that were right here, they just
[2:19:01] shut this whole thing down. Boom. And
[2:19:03] they disappear. So you were all coming
[2:19:06] up from Bank of America, Well Fargo,
[2:19:08] Fifth Third, and you all jump right here
[2:19:10] and they just killed this thing right
[2:19:12] here. So if you ask Crack and crack and
[2:19:14] say, "I don't know anything about it."
[2:19:16] You the one that went into the ocean. I
[2:19:18] didn't tell you to go over there. You
[2:19:20] took the money yourself. You went there.
[2:19:21] I warned you. I told you to sandpaper.
[2:19:23] You were too quick to sandpaper. That's
[2:19:25] your problem over there. That company
[2:19:28] never existed.
[2:19:34] And because message believer brother
[2:19:36] Brandham say you need to investigate and
[2:19:38] to make sure where you are you investing
[2:19:41] is legitimate. So now they begin to come
[2:19:43] up with scheme that they attach it to a
[2:19:46] business. So they tell you no no no no
[2:19:48] they are I mean the bike in Europe
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; uh that you are you are owning a bike.
[2:19:54] So in the morning you sign in you clock
[2:19:56] in and you hear message believe I just
[2:19:59] clock in $200 a day.
[2:20:04] You oweing a bank, you owing a bike in
[2:20:07] in Hong Kong.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; You living in America.
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; So when they close, go to Hong Kong. Go
[2:20:17] ask the people in Hong Kong, where is
[2:20:19] your bike?
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; You see, a normal thinking is not even
[2:20:24] there. That's why the word of God is
[2:20:26] coming
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; to stop all this type of stuff here.
[2:20:31] Please in this church you who have
[2:20:33] friend who know too much we invest in
[2:20:35] stock market and stuff stay away from
[2:20:38] this type of stuff. I know what I'm
[2:20:40] talking about. Some of you already heard
[2:20:42] that people are crying all over the
[2:20:44] state because of this thing here. And
[2:20:46] they will give you three month or four
[2:20:48] month they give you money. They give you
[2:20:50] money and you become a preacher.
[2:20:55] So if somebody get in this church,
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; you young people, you understanding me?
[2:20:59] If somebody get in this church among you
[2:21:02] and begin to go in a nicolent spirit
[2:21:04] right here
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; and begin to tell you about trading,
[2:21:07] trading, there is a young man in the
[2:21:09] church in America right here that enter
[2:21:11] and was going around young men and
[2:21:14] getting the money for trading until the
[2:21:16] thing was brought to the pastor and he
[2:21:18] suck money from the young people telling
[2:21:20] them he knows how to trade. And I know
[2:21:22] the young man. I saw him myself
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; and he's still in the message church.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; So if you come here with all your online
[2:21:33] virtual begin to pull young people here,
[2:21:36] I will come to you with the deacon in
[2:21:38] this church and I will talk to you
[2:21:40] straight because this thing are coming
[2:21:42] from hell. Because what happened once
[2:21:45] you begin to do it for one month every
[2:21:47] day 200 200 200 200 and you see them
[2:21:51] going out say wow $1,000 a week doing
[2:21:55] nothing with a bike in Hong Kong
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; and then you come and they say if you
[2:22:00] bring somebody in they will pay you
[2:22:02] $200. Guess what? outside. Brother
[2:22:04] Charles, brother Charles behind. Brother
[2:22:07] so and so, sister so and so. Before you
[2:22:10] know it, I'm sleeping at home reading
[2:22:12] brother. Now I have to deal with the
[2:22:13] whole church and to know who started
[2:22:16] this, who brought this because
[2:22:17] somebody's mad against somebody else. It
[2:22:19] didn't happen here. I don't want it to
[2:22:21] happen.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stay away from this.
[2:22:28] Brother Brandham say don't do this type
[2:22:30] of stuff.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; It is gambling.
[2:22:33] you're going to lose your money.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Don't be too quick to make money.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; If somebody's pulling you somewhere to
[2:22:41] make money quickly, brother Brown, I'm
[2:22:43] saying stay away from thing that make
[2:22:45] money overnight.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Money come slowly and gradually.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; God is your money.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Correct the habit. The money will be
[2:22:59] there.
[2:23:01] But don't get into this gimmick.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Overnight,
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; overnight money. Overnight money. And
[2:23:07] they are I mean incentive. If you put
[2:23:10] $300, if you put $3,000, you're going to
[2:23:13] have 300 a day. If you put $7,000, you
[2:23:17] get 500 a day. If you put $50,000, you
[2:23:21] get 1,000 a day. And somebody who have
[2:23:23] 50,000, guess what?
[2:23:25] They say in three months, we reach.
[2:23:29] In three months you put, they give you
[2:23:31] a,000, they give you a,000, they give
[2:23:32] you a,000. Before you know it, when they
[2:23:34] lock
[2:23:36] out of your 50, you only receive 9,000
[2:23:39] back.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; A down payment for a whole house is
[2:23:44] gone.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; The root, the love of money,
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; that's it,
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; is the root of all evil.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together, young people? If
[2:23:54] somebody calls you, call me. I will go
[2:23:57] talk to him. Very good. I would even
[2:23:59] drive my car straight to their home and
[2:24:01] go talk to them. I don't want anybody to
[2:24:03] be caught here
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; because there is nothing to trace. This
[2:24:06] is done internationally. I know a second
[2:24:09] brother who came to me. He said, "But
[2:24:11] Stephen, this is working. This is
[2:24:12] working. This is working." I said, "Take
[2:24:14] the money, girl." Before you know it, he
[2:24:16] came with explanation with his wife.
[2:24:19] I say, "He's explaining me. Give me my
[2:24:21] money back.
[2:24:25] Amen.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; So your pastor went through a lot of
[2:24:30] stuff.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? God help me learn all
[2:24:33] this stuff. Stay away from this type of
[2:24:36] environment. Go back to the message of
[2:24:38] the whatever you want to do. If you're
[2:24:41] not sure of what you're doing, I am your
[2:24:43] pastor. Give me a call and say, "Brother
[2:24:45] Steven, have brotherham ever say
[2:24:48] something about this type of stuff? What
[2:24:50] do you think about it? We can search for
[2:24:52] you and give you, but don't be clicking
[2:24:55] and before you know it, it's meeting.
[2:24:56] Some became manager, super manager. And
[2:24:59] they told me one was in the church with
[2:25:01] a tambourine.
[2:25:02] Glory to God. When they shut down, the
[2:25:04] boy could not play the tambourine no
[2:25:06] more in the church. Everybody was gone.
[2:25:10] It's not you. You didn't do anything.
[2:25:12] It's It is coming from another church.
[2:25:19] Meeting meeting. Young people, young
[2:25:22] people, please. You don't know what
[2:25:23] you're venturing into. Stay away from
[2:25:26] that. Watch the person. Watch the person
[2:25:30] that is talking to you. Watch the young
[2:25:31] man that is talking to you. Watch the
[2:25:34] young sister that is talking to you. If
[2:25:36] everything they're doing, it's not
[2:25:38] filter by the word of God. Stay away.
[2:25:41] The difficulty in marriages are very
[2:25:44] difficult to handle. You will suffer. If
[2:25:47] you marry a crow, good luck. You got to
[2:25:49] wait till the rapture come.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; He won't die quickly. You can put a life
[2:25:55] insurance on him. He won't die quickly.
[2:25:58] Are we together?
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; So young men come. Don't follow what
[2:26:02] they telling you. Filter by the word of
[2:26:04] God.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Some people say I'm too tough on boys or
[2:26:08] or anything. I'm I'm a boy.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; So they talking to me like I'm I'm I'm
[2:26:13] not I'm not a man. I'm I was a boy.
[2:26:17] Yes sir.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven is too. Yes, I was a boy.
[2:26:19] I know.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; From my youth when I was growing up, I
[2:26:23] always spend time watching and observing
[2:26:26] and learning and I saw wicked stuff
[2:26:29] among men.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; An ungenerated boy
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; is very dangerous.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat it again. A boy that is
[2:26:39] not born again in this message.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Leave the Pentecostal alone is very
[2:26:45] dangerous.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; That's why if you're not born again,
[2:26:50] stay under your parent
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; and let your parent help you up and your
[2:26:55] pastor help you out because it's
[2:26:57] dangerous.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; The scheme boys do.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was sitting there they you look
[2:27:04] at them they worse than we I mean voodoo
[2:27:07] doctor what they were doing
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish with this my friend
[2:27:12] that's why you see me tough
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; that's why you can say God bless you and
[2:27:17] my eyes are looking at different things
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; because I don't care what you say God
[2:27:21] bless you I'm trying to see who is this
[2:27:23] young man because once he get you
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; once you say I do right here
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; now you come to tell me Go back and undo
[2:27:33] again. You will do it yourself. Not me.
[2:27:35] Don't come because I usually ask you
[2:27:38] question right here before the whole
[2:27:39] congregation.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm want to finish with
[2:27:46] this.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; There was a man, a boy
[2:27:51] that was coding dating a girl
[2:27:55] in a city.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; And I want to finish with this so you
[2:27:58] have time to go think young sister and
[2:28:00] ponder about this.
[2:28:02] And then he traveled to another city. A
[2:28:05] very good player. I know him very well.
[2:28:07] I know the man very well. A very good
[2:28:10] player. Unbelievable. He can he can he
[2:28:12] can memorize a book
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; and tell you about Parish. But he never
[2:28:16] been in Paris.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; And if you go to Parish, he can tell you
[2:28:20] even the avenue of Paris.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; But he never been there. And if you've
[2:28:25] been there, you will say the boy is
[2:28:26] right. The boy. So he can impress you.
[2:28:28] Unbelievable. I've seen that. This is
[2:28:30] not I'm not telling you story. So he
[2:28:33] left that city and went to another city
[2:28:37] and the girl was so infatuated with love
[2:28:41] rolling on the bed falling. He got a
[2:28:43] boyfriend who love him and everything
[2:28:46] and uh the boy was too busy and he wrote
[2:28:50] if I'm not mistaken seven or 10 letters.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? I'm saying this for a
[2:28:57] purpose so you understand why I'm strict
[2:28:59] the way I am. He wrote 10 or seven
[2:29:01] letters to the young lady and he
[2:29:05] attached the letter to gift.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Should I stop?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; You need to go home. It's Wednesday.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; It's Wednesday. He took He took seven.
[2:29:21] Okay, let's go by seven. He took seven
[2:29:24] gift he attached to the letter.
[2:29:27] And when he finished to attach to the
[2:29:29] letter, every letter have a different
[2:29:31] date.
[2:29:33] And I'm going to give you an
[2:29:34] explanation. Letter number one. Say, "I
[2:29:38] love you, honey. I just came to the
[2:29:40] city. I'm missing you. You're the best.
[2:29:42] You the babble or my Pepsi. You you this
[2:29:45] and all of this." And they tell you
[2:29:48] everything, all of this that they say,
[2:29:52] you know, I miss you. This, this, this,
[2:29:54] this is the gift I sent you.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; The letter, that's that's letter number
[2:30:02] one.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Letter number two says, I receive your
[2:30:06] letter.
[2:30:09] I receive your letter, and I'm glad to
[2:30:13] to receive something from you. Thank you
[2:30:15] for riding me back.
[2:30:18] Thank you very much and I love you. I
[2:30:20] appreciate your letter. And in other
[2:30:22] words, he anticipated
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; the response.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? And later three goes
[2:30:32] like that. Okay, since it says been
[2:30:35] three month,
[2:30:36] thank you. I receive your letter. And he
[2:30:38] lended all of them and he put into a big
[2:30:42] case and he sent it to his brother.
[2:30:46] So his brother got a letter in the city
[2:30:49] sitting in the room. So after two three
[2:30:52] weeks they pick letter one with uh
[2:30:55] instruction and they bring it to you.
[2:30:57] They say sister so and so this is your
[2:30:59] letter from your husband and you there
[2:31:01] jumping
[2:31:02] all the all your letter home.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Why did God let me see those stuff?
[2:31:16] Why did God let me sit? I can sit with
[2:31:19] you and tell you story about boy. That's
[2:31:21] why when I sit down I and you see my
[2:31:23] eyes narrowing down. I don't play game
[2:31:28] because I take you like my children
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; because I seen pastor loose. Anybody can
[2:31:35] come and play run play. Uhuh. If I see
[2:31:37] you going around going around going
[2:31:39] around, I will catch you. If not, we
[2:31:41] deliver you to the devil or you find
[2:31:42] another pastor quickly. No problem about
[2:31:44] it. Are we together?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; So the the young lady was there. After
[2:31:49] two or three weeks, they take letter
[2:31:50] number two and she bring another letter.
[2:31:52] Thank you. This is the letter. You take
[2:31:54] it to the city. And they gave her letter
[2:31:56] number two. All the letter was sitting
[2:31:58] at home.
[2:32:00] And the crazy man was there whooping his
[2:32:03] life with other women in another city.
[2:32:06] And the woman staying here thinking the
[2:32:08] husband is responding to her letter and
[2:32:11] sending back. Can you see the level of
[2:32:14] deception?
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Do you see that when I told you your
[2:32:18] mind are now wide open?
[2:32:22] You need a filter.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; A thinking man filter.
[2:32:28] You need the word of God.
[2:32:31] This is not a story somebody told me.
[2:32:34] This is something I witness. I saw it
[2:32:36] and I look at the woman blind,
[2:32:39] completely blind, thinking the letters
[2:32:42] are coming with the airplane.
[2:32:50] This is how that's why brother say a man
[2:32:53] without the Holy Ghost
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; is a beast.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; It's an animal.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; It's an animal, my friend.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go back to the
[2:33:04] thinking man filter.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; It might seems like it's too tough but
[2:33:10] at the end it will bless you.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; It will remove a lot of headache from
[2:33:15] your life. If you get a good mate, you
[2:33:18] will be soaring like an eagle.
[2:33:20] Even if a problem is there, you will be
[2:33:22] so all your problem will be o over I
[2:33:25] mean overtaken by love and resolve
[2:33:28] quickly and you would never even you
[2:33:30] will even sit in your in in your
[2:33:32] marriage and ask yourself a question. I
[2:33:34] heard so much so many wrong thing about
[2:33:36] marriage but I never of course because
[2:33:38] you made a right choice you would never
[2:33:41] experience that one. This is why we
[2:33:44] coming. I can preach marriage and
[2:33:46] divorce but I don't want you to get
[2:33:47] divorced. I'm not going to preach to you
[2:33:49] and divorcing in this church. No,
[2:33:51] marriage and divorce is there for the
[2:33:53] people who already in trouble but not
[2:33:55] you getting again into a marriage and
[2:33:57] getting divorced because the the the
[2:33:59] previous generation in the message a lot
[2:34:01] of divorce were happened. Why? Because
[2:34:04] it was uh like real estate marriages and
[2:34:07] u uh putting people together. I mean
[2:34:10] real estate marriage I mean brokers
[2:34:12] marriages. That was the word I was
[2:34:14] looking for. I mean this one putting
[2:34:16] this one together, this one putting the
[2:34:18] and all of them busted, busted, busted,
[2:34:20] busted. It was good. Hey, so and so got
[2:34:22] married because of me. So and so look,
[2:34:24] look after five years. Look, look, it's
[2:34:26] the children that are suffering in the
[2:34:29] middle. Why? Real estate brokers
[2:34:31] marriages
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; and now you got another broker.
[2:34:34] Facebook, you got another broker.
[2:34:35] Twitter, another broker. Instagram, he's
[2:34:38] putting you together. This one is
[2:34:39] putting you together. This one is
[2:34:41] putting you together. This one is
[2:34:42] putting you together. Before you know
[2:34:44] it, man, those picture you see online,
[2:34:47] wait till you see the real Ben.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; Wait till you see the real deal.
[2:34:53] You will be like, "He doesn't look like
[2:34:55] it."
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to finish with this one.
[2:34:58] There was a one that has a nice picture,
[2:35:01] a lady in this in this America here. Put
[2:35:03] it on Facebook and the young man say, "I
[2:35:05] want this one." The young man took a
[2:35:07] ticket and went there and dropped there.
[2:35:09] The lady came with her sister at the
[2:35:12] airport to come and pick it up. When the
[2:35:14] young man dropped at the airport, he
[2:35:16] looked, he said, "Who are you?"
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? The young
[2:35:22] man begin to talk to the young sister of
[2:35:24] the lady. And the lady got upset. Did
[2:35:26] you come for my sister or for me?
[2:35:29] Who are you?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, my friend. Let me let you
[2:35:41] go home.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Stay with the message. Stay with the
[2:35:47] word.
[2:35:49] Instagram is not our filter.
[2:35:53] Kirk Franklin is not our filter.
[2:35:57] Mavericks is not our filter.
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; Those rock and roll boys that fly with a
[2:36:06] guitar like this, that's not our filter.
[2:36:13] All the sacredness in Christian worship
[2:36:16] has been removed.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; They are dressing any kind of way. They
[2:36:21] are preaching any kind of way.
[2:36:24] We preaching with a suit. We became like
[2:36:26] the old guys. Now preachers have to go
[2:36:29] with a with a shirt and button and you
[2:36:33] preaching the gospel. The gospel with a
[2:36:35] shirt and button
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; and before you know it, it's a pant that
[2:36:39] is uh torn down and then we singing for
[2:36:42] the Lord and the anointing. Of course,
[2:36:44] the voice will make you vibrate. The
[2:36:46] instrument will make you vibrate. That's
[2:36:48] the anointing of Balum.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; But it's not the anointing of Israel.
[2:36:58] You think I'm too hard, one of this day
[2:37:00] you will understand.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; All we want, you want to get married,
[2:37:04] follow the correct channel. You want to
[2:37:06] get married, follow the correct channel.
[2:37:08] You want to do something, watch what
[2:37:10] does the word says about this. If you're
[2:37:12] not sure, stay away. If you need money,
[2:37:14] ask God. God will give you money.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; But don't get into gimmicks.
[2:37:21] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:37:24] are approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:37:27] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[2:37:29] your love, your mercy, and for
[2:37:31] everything that you've been doing for
[2:37:32] your children. Father, you're the one
[2:37:35] that opened up this channel. And as a
[2:37:37] shepherd, I just felt led to express and
[2:37:40] to share these things with the local
[2:37:42] flock both here and internationally,
[2:37:45] those that are streaming so that Lord,
[2:37:47] Father, we can understand because your
[2:37:49] prophet told us that to overcome is to
[2:37:52] recognize the devil in all his tactics,
[2:37:54] Lord. Father, I pray that you protect
[2:37:57] the church. Protect the young men in
[2:37:59] this church. Protect the young sister in
[2:38:02] this church. Protect the family all over
[2:38:05] the world, Lord. Father, may you be
[2:38:07] merciful to us, Lord. And may your
[2:38:09] spirit come and clean all these things
[2:38:12] away from our home, Lord, so that we can
[2:38:15] understand that we need to depend
[2:38:17] completely upon thee because you prove
[2:38:19] it in the scripture that man shall not
[2:38:21] live by bread alone but by every word
[2:38:24] that proceedth out of the mouth of God
[2:38:27] and that word is the thinking man
[2:38:29] filter. Lord, help this church and give
[2:38:31] us travel mercy as we go into our
[2:38:34] respective place. And whoever is
[2:38:36] struggling with what we spoke, Lord,
[2:38:38] Father, may your grace come and open up
[2:38:40] their eyes, Lord, so that they can
[2:38:42] realize the latest of the hour and the
[2:38:44] trap of the enemy because he only come
[2:38:47] to steal, to destroy, and to kill, Lord.
[2:38:50] In other words, there is nothing good
[2:38:52] that is coming out of Satan. Father, may
[2:38:54] you protect us under your blood and may
[2:38:57] you bless us. Strengthen your men's
[2:38:58] servant, Lord, Father, and take the
[2:39:00] remaining of the weak unto thy hand in
[2:39:03] Jesus precious name. Amen. I'll bless
[2:39:06] you, brother Satan.
