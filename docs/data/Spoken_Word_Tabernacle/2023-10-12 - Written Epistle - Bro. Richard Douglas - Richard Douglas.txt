weather a little bit last week but hey God brings us out of the weather into the sun amen I'm glad of that amen I like how Paul starts this he says starting at cor 2 Corinthians chapter 3 start at verse one through three he said Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of Commendation to you from you he said ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men amen for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not on not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart yes sir and such Trust we have through Christ to godward Father Lord oh Lord Jesus father I Just Surrender myself right now father I

humanity god father and minister to our hearts this night Lord father I pray father you Lord you just come in such a way father Lord You' do something like you did on the road to EMAs tonight Lord father something that they would recognize God it's not a man it's God speaking father I pray oh Lord God as you begin to break the bread father that the eyes of the children would come open and say Jesus is here father I believe you'll do this because I've asked you with a sincere heart father I ask that you would do these things for the glory of God and God Alone in Jesus Christ name name we pray amen and amen amen I'd like to take you may be seated I'd like to take a little topic tonight by God's grace I'd like to talk about written Epistles written Epistles I want to kind of lay a little groundwork here just for a few minutes if you'll be patient with me and we see here that as apostle Paul was talking to this he was really when he starts in verse one he's he's asking him the question do I do I do I need your approval have I do you not know me you know remember they asked Jesus show us the father and they'll satisfy us and Jesus gave the answer have I been with you so long you don't know who I am that's right and see sometimes that's the way it is man wants approval of man but we must have the approval of God God's the one that approved us we've received a message that's been Vindicated by God that God has sent us a prophet to receive a message this is what Paul was he was the prophet to the Ephesians God show he was saying look do and I come back now here in the Corinthians Church do I need Commendation of you do I need your approval do I need your handshake is God not already showed you who I am I'm not here to commend myself I'm here to represent Jesus Christ amen he said ye are our epistle yes sir written in our hearts known and read of all men he said for as much as you are manifestly declared to be by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart he's showing out he's saying look I have received a message from God a message of God not to capture your mind but to give a revelation in your heart to know who you are to get you in a position to where you can take a Rapture that's what we've received we've not come here to with enticing words of wisdom of men we've come here with a message that is get dressing a bride to get her ready to manifest the word of God for this hour yesall glory be to God in the message brother BR preaches in the hidden life yes sir he said God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone he put you here as a testimony yes a written epistle read of all men Amen to live a honorable and a decent life that's right and a head consecrated with God so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and Reigns am we are here to prove that God is still alive yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah glory be to God amen amen Christians are letters of recommendation that's exactly right that's ex that's what God has called us to do we're here as letters of recommendation to this Dying World that there is a God and he's living in his children GL to God yes brother living Epistles for Jesus Christ Hallelujah we should be so much like Jesus Christ that's right we was coming to the Bride of Jesus Christ yes we was coming to be such a place to where we become him in Bride form amen that's what Paul's saying you're my letters of recommendation you are my written Epistles that's right this message that I have given you is going to bring you to the place that you're going to be commended by God to do the works of God Amen thanks my brother glory to God Amen we're living biography of our father you can't deny him even when Peter in his position he could he tried to deny him but his words betrayed him right because it had already been written in his heart what he was not in this but in the hearts It Was Written Hallelujah glory be to God we are not just professors of this message we are possessors of this message glory be to God turn with me to the Book of Proverbs will you Proverbs Chapter 7 amen hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah I'm so thankful for the truth ain't you it ain't nothing else going to set you free right Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Proverbs chapter 7 verses 1 through3 this is one of the wisest men one of the wisest men that God gave only one other man was Christ was had greater understanding yes sir than Solomon because he's cre he's the one that created Sol he's the all Fountain of wisdom he's the Fountain of Knowledge he's the Fountain of Life he's the Fountain of Love he's Everything Jesus Christ but I like howy how he says this right here it says my son keep my words and lay up my Commandments with thee that's right he said keep my Commandments and live that's the only way you live is keep the Commandments and live you got to have it in your heart not in your mind you cannot keep the Commandments unless you've been born of the spirit of God the keeper is the spirit of God we are led by the spirit of God we are taught by the spirit of God the word is revealed to us by the spirit of God we are Sons and Daughters by birth he said keep my Commandments and live yes sir and my law as an apple of thine eye right he said bind them upon thy fingers and write them upon the table of thine heart am am am it's got to be here yes not here this will do you no good this is the Devil's Playground the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen am Hallelujah we are here to represent Jesus Christ he has brought us to bring forth the manifestation of what he has written of us amen when he said there was going to be a bride we're it we're the very proof of the written word being alive amen when he said he would send when he would send a prophet and turn the faith of the children back to the fathers we're it you're looking at it we're it we're the ones that was turned back to the faith of the father we're the an epistle that's been written about it come to manifest his life in me and you we are keepers of the word because we've been born of the word we are Sons and Daughters of God because we're born of the spirit of God we are blood blood bought children of God Amen an epistle is the letters adopted as books of the New Testament right distinct characteristics he wrote he left us what kind of characteristics we would manifest we don't have to wonder we don't have to guess God has given it to us he's BR it to us in such a way that we know how we're supposed to live how what we're supposed to produce and if we're not doing it's because we've not receive the spirit of God because the spirit of God is the only one that can manifest these things Hallelujah glory be to God the Christian yes sir has to be in this place am because it's been written of him amen amen it's manifested you are the Manifest oh glory be to God brother you're the manifestation of this [Applause] message you're the fruits of this message if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will that's the only way you have the commission to ask what you will is you must be abiding in him and it will produce his characteristics the vine the branch produces the characteristics of the vine because it is written what the vine is that it would the fruit would come out of the vine when you see a Vine if it's a Musky dime Vine a grape vine or this Vine you know if it's a Musky DIY Vine it's going to produce musket if it's a grape vine it's going to produce grapes if it produces anything else it's not feeding off the vine it's either been grafted into the vine there a lot of people been grafted in but there's only one brother when that L when that that final Branch comes it'll produce the same life it'll bring the same fruit it'll bring the same thing that Pentecost brought it'll bring the same life that the the apostles had Hallelujah glory be to God ain't you thankful for the truth I like what the prophet says in the message behold greater than Solomon is here he said you're God's Written Letter you're his letter to this world yes sir yes are we got to realize what we are we are God's letter to this world we've been stamped by the token the the token message BR a token life we've been stamped approved by God to produce a life in this [Applause] age he said a written epistle he said God is in you manifesting himself you're not here manifesting I'm not here manifesting Richard Douglas you're not here brother Steve is not here manifesting step shanger he's here manifesting Jesus Christ a written epistle manifest the life of Jesus Christ glory be to God the message Shalom yes sir he said in and the outside world will only know God as they see God in you that's it he said that's the only way that they'll know God is when we are written Epistles yes sir Epistles of the scripture amen this message did not change the Scripture it BR light on the Scripture it BR understanding of the scriptures God said he'd reveal nothing till he reveals it to his servants the prophets first that's God's order that's God's written order he cannot go against his written order it has to come through that manifestation glory be to God he said in the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us that's ex Not only was it written that Moses would be used of God to be a deliverer but it was also written that Pharaoh would reject it's also written of the vessels of Dishonor as much as it is of the vessels of Honor right so this has been written of both there's only two here two spirits and they bring forth what they're written about oh Hallelujah glory be to God thank you Jesus what a message what a word we've received not just any word not just any word but a real word he said a man is identified by The Works that he does if you're not producing works you don't have no identification that's why a lot of people had their identity stole because they don't know what kind of work they're supposed to be [Applause] [Music] doing there's a lot of stolen identity that's why they don't know their because they don't know their written Epistles the Bible's not written of this not of this it's written of this is producing a life that's going to change this in the moment in the twinkling of an eye when the Trump of God shall sound and we shall be changed we shall give mortality to immortality corruptible shall take on incorruptible amen so our works should be good I thought we just done any way we want to if we was predestinated to see we just live any other way we wanted to do any no it ain't written like that don't rewrite the script be careful because he said if you add to it take away don't add to it don't take away just do what it says stay in [Music] prayer he said always good because we are representing our Lord Jesus Christ I think people would act better if they realize who he representing they're not just representing this church or brother Steven we're representing Jesus Christ am that'll make you want to live better amen walk better act better do right am be right am amen glory be to God what a truth we've received he said the deity of Jesus Christ he said he made Moses a God to Pharaoh once what a strong words for a lot of people to understand God make a man God yeah he was his God you better believe he was his God yes sir he was a represent he was a written Epistle of God God WR that he was going to be the deliverer he I'm going to use Moses why you think he told him to take his shoes off he say my turn to walk Moses now you can walk because I'm taking over I'm taking over your body what you say will be what I'm saying that's right what you call for I'll back up that's a written epistle see Hallelujah he said and he made he said and he made you a God to the people he said that's right and you this morning are written Epistles of God right your lives are of God and even carries that Holy Ghost amen amen deity living in flesh what a beautiful thing written epist WR of all men oh my I like what the prophet said he said don't Don't Preach me a sermon live me one amen amen oh I just love this don't you we are his written Epistles he has called us predes predestinated us give us the ability the spirit of his his very own Spirit living in us to produce what he said he was amen what a what a Commendation by a prophet you're my letters that's what the prophet told us we are the letters of God for this age we're the Bride of Jesus Christ he said I don't no longer call you church I call you [Applause] bride I'm going to give you a distinction yes sir I'm going to show you that it's written of you yes sir in the Bible so you'll realize what you're producing so you'll have the understanding the redeemed are God's world Jesus Christ is still alive am and he lives forever more amen amen you are God's billboard all right your God's billboard in and he's the one that's wrote it all on the billboard what you're doing you're just a board that's been wrote on Hallelujah prise God glory be to God hallelujah upon which he writes his love and his mercy and his grace upon mine and your heart didn't brother Brown said the only Mercy will be found in the bride that's written of you that's written of you be careful judge no thing quickly only judge it by the word judge it by the message Hallelujah no artist paints a painting to hide it in a closet Hallelujah you are in his canvas that he is displaying his magnificent life in woo glory be to God no sculpture fashion it just to hide it away in an unseen Place Hallelujah he is chipping us away he had a vision when he took me and you that what we was going to be it was already in his mind and he read it on his in his word what is a thought expressed can we say we are his thoughts expressed and he's chipping away but he's fixing to strike speak little bride speak little bride now you are my written epistle I can trust you now you're manifesting what I said you you are obeying like I expected you to obey you're living like I told you to live Hallelujah glory be to God am no writer that pins a literary work keeps it hid from the eyes of others he didn't keep it hid from us sister glory be to God he said behold when the seventh angel shall come all Mysteries shall be finished he said I give you a open book I have unveiled myself to you just what you've read about I have unveiled myself I I am manifesting myself to you not only did he unveil himself but he unveiled Satan that's right he totally stripped him down from everything showed just exactly where he started from and where he's going to end I always like telling Satan just like Jesus said it's also written Satan it's also written Satan that was pretty good but Satan it's also written the Lake of Fire was created for you and your angel it's written of you Satan you have an end I'm just [Applause] beginning God didn't save me and you just to set us on the pews of a church God did not make us tro of his grace just to set us on a shelf we are his testimonies of his Saving Grace to save a dying world oh my can I say it like this let your light shine me you are a reflection of your father we are God's Heavenly poetry echoed out through our lives glory be to God what a savior we serve what a mighty God we the plain letter that God has sent us in this hour he sent us a simple he sent us a prophet that wasn't educated and adulterated with all those things he sent us a prophet with a seven Great education that he would speak the common land's language and me and you'd understand the Bible said Jesus spoke the common man's language and they received him gladly those who were supposed to receive see his written word spoken that's what we are we are his written word spoken manifested for this hour hallelujah what a mighty God we serve the Paul is telling them you are the lives that has produced through the message God has given yes sir you are the LI you are the written lives of the message ain't we glad we had a prophet go behind the curtain at time and said will Paul be Jud for what he preached he said good because I preached just what he preached he had to preach what he preached that's that's all it was Paul said any angel or anybody had to be preached I don't care what nobody says it has to be preached brother steeve preached so that it might be preached and it be received in hearts and then be written in your heart amen yes Hallelujah God is say he said you're not just you're not just my letters but your letters of Christ of the message I have that God has given me to bring to this age that's right you're the manifestation of this message do you realize that you're manifesting one message or the other the message of Satan of the message of God that's the only one you can manifest there only two Spirits you'll only produce what you've been written of it's been written of you you cannot be nothing but what you've been written of Amen oh my inscribed in our hearts oh Hallelujah a't you thankful for that David said I've hid Thy word in my heart that i' sin on against you he has inscribed this in me he has took his anger of love and wrote mercy and Grace in my heart that's exactly what it is what does the word inscribe means it means of a surface or an object to write engrave or print a lasting [Music] record thank the life you live preaches louder than the words you speak Jesus said you speak well of me with your mouth but your heart's far from me can we say it like this right here we are God's identified Masterpiece his bride as Jesus was God's identified Masterpiece we are Jesus's identified Masterpiece in Bride form it's been written of us he said the spirit and the brid said come they're saying the same thing not two different things the same thing said we'll do the same Works am he said think the same thoughts live the same type of life if the spirit of God is in you it makes you live like Christ it makes you Christlike then you become a written epistle read of all men in you reflects his is light out of you if you didn't have that reflecting board in you you'd never reflect God that's right that Seed Life in there shows you exactly what you are amen hallelujah what a what a truth what a message we've received I'm thankful for the truth he couldn't couldn't receive nothing greater couldn't receive nothing greater than what he's give us I read a few I want to hold you long so don't get scared we'll let you go it says in the Mighty God unveil he said it's those who believe the word and the promises of this day that God is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh and that is written Epistles M Harvest time he says if you are written epistle you reflect only the word can I read you that again if you are written epistle you reflect only the word not a Creed not a Dogma not some strange interpretation you reflect the word hallelujah see the discrepancy Satan hates that hates that but that's because that's what he is but hey we hate him too so he said he was the interpretation of the word and every born again son and daughter of God God of this age is the interpretation of the word you are written Epistles read of all men yes what a word we received we didn't just receive any word we received his word he said we're written Epistles that's right that means there's something being pinned in mind in your heart to manifest in this hour the life of Jesus Christ God's chosen of worship he said and his promised word will be interpreted In You by him well I love that don't you brother St can I read that again he said and his promised word will be interpreted In You by him not by you by him he'll interpret his word in you glory be to God am he said did you get that that amen we got that I felt the shock off of that didn't it was like a charge to the soul yes I got that father I receive that I'm part of that what you just said I'm written it's written to me glory be to God he said the word that he promised to fulfill in the last day that you're living in you will be written Epistle of God read of all men yes God said there'd be a bride there's going to be a bride no matter what brother Mike in spite of this this ain't going this is fading away Amen in the Leo seeing church gaug he said then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word of his day he was it was no other voice with the word for his day but him he says the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation then if we do the same thing right then we'll produce the same thing that was written of us if we receive our message will produce just what it said he said and a man that's got the spirit of God in him or woman that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the Lord comes to them amen and they are the word to the people right written Epistles read of all men do you realize that you're the word to this generation in Bri form you're the word to this generation let that sink down in and what you are we got to realize who we are that's our problem we don't recognize who we are that's why we live so far below our privileges we don't know what we don't we don't we're not grasping it we're catching it here but we're not letting it we're not letting it engrave in our heart to realize that we are Paul said you're not going to be you are our sons and daughters of God now go waake Jesus he said back in the Bible back to the message back to his message that Christ Among Us the Bible living Bibles your written Epistles living Bibles the word of God living through you yes sir that's what you need you need to live in God living through you that word manifesting itself through mine and your life that's the only thing he's coming back to get yes sir is his written Epistles and the others are they've got their written they've got their part too they've got their part R they've done just what they they said there' be written now B said there' be a great falling away and there is and it ain't through we really need to recognize who we are that's that's why we live so far below our privilege we don't recognize who we are we're a privileged people we have Authority thirsting for life he said and the life that's in you makes you a written epistle read of all men so it has to be the Life of Christ that makes you a written epistle no other life can make you a written epistle but him behold I S the door knock he said if you're the salt of the earth then you've got to live such a life a written epistle till all men will know what you are all men will know what you are oh that's one of them oh yeah I am I'm one of them I'm glad to say I'm one of them I'm one of them crazy people that believes God send a prophet thank you Lord I'm one of them people that you call insane go ahead I'm glad cuz it's already written what I written down what I am I'm just you're just testifying what I am I can't help what I am God made me what I am just like he made you what you are we're what he made us brother said once you see this yes sir you can't see nothing else that's what happened to me I seen it and I can't see nothing else all I see is Jesus Christ the son of God manifested in [Music] desire I seen a son of man revealing the son of man glory be to God he said Jezebel religion another one of them is Satan hates but that's all right we always like to get him with those says you want to live just what you talk about right hey we've heard a lot of people talk for a long time it's more than talking it's living amen written Epistles are living attributes of Jesus Christ am written Epistles amen you are the manifestation of the message and the message of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he don't ever change listen to this he warns us if you don't live it yourself how could you expect anybody how could you expect somebody else to live it that's strong ain't it amen but you know what a lot of people want to want you to live the message they they they their interpretation of it huh God said you live you live what I wrote like Brother s said sag es and Pharisees let you do like me and do this and do that no you do what God tells you to do you produce what he said you'd produce he's written of you what you're supposed to do he said see you are written Epistles R of all men so always be honest just true tell the truth no matter how bad it hurts [Applause] something that's what's wrong with preachers they're afraid to tell the truth because they're afraid they'll hurt somebody but the prophet told me that you can't hurt a real plan of God we're not hot bed plans we want the vitamins I say Jesus if it hurts me then cut the hide off of me if I need some hide trimming then trim some hide am he said he said tell the truth anyhow because you can always tell it the same way each [Music] time I love it like that don't you brother you don't have to change it you don't have to dope it up you don't have to powder it up you just say it the way it said and you say it that way every time hallelujah amen he said unveiling of God he said have you have I not sent that he said you are written Epistles what kind of an epistle an Epistle of God Amen listen to this he said God bearing record that he sent you it's God bearing record that he sent you you don't have to prove yourself God's already proved it's god-bearing record that he sent you don't be intimidated by the scoffers or the Walkers scarecrows always gather where the wheat fills at and the crows always are scared of the scare of the scarecrows but a scarecrow is not designed for an eagle cuz the eagle is a high flying he just flies right over him and lands in our knes we're not fading off the man of a message of a man we're feeling off the unfailing by the word of the son of man amen God he said identified Christ of all ages TOA he said we are living Epistles or otherwise we are Epistles that's living I like that we're Epistles living living oracles Lively Stones a new creation we are Epistles that's living that's been written and now living out the word of God yes as he has promised it am in the in in the hour manifested word Epistles written that's been living out that's what theist Apostles are that's what we are that's what we're producing we're producing that oh hallelujah what a mighty God God has written out a drama I'm try to speed up a little bit God has written out of drama in this age that me and you are fulfilling out Peter said in First Peter 122 he said ye have see ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth the spirit unto unfringed love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart F I believe that's what it's lacking around the message he's loving one another with a pure heart Bible said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God we're looking at the flesh too much we're not looking at the purity of the word and the seed that lives in it hallelujah what a mighty God we serve listen what brother Brown said about this in the drama that he see brother said we're just part that he's wrote right when when an actor's given a part he has to re he has to act out what is written of him he can't act out another part amen I can't act out brother Steven's part brother Steven can't act out my part I can't act out your part you can't act out my part let's just get in our position and act out the part that God has given us in the deity of Jesus Christ brother talking about the drama he said I believe that we are facing yes sir he said are you listening he said to me congregation says amen he said all right we are facing now looking at the greatest drama that's ever been said in human history working out right here before us the great field of the world here and the drama that God is going to act out right now that it's starting to look around over the world and see how the thing is moving together oh how it's something fixing to happen friend he said this is what we've talked about and I said about it is right here now yes it's already starting everywhere breaking out this is the breaking out of the season it's the coming of the lord it's the bringing forth it's the third pull as I begin to look at this at this this drama do you know a drama forms a pyramid that don't happen just for any reason as I got to looking at that it it just I said my goodness no wonder brother St that's what is [Music] building coming to that Capstone of love there's five stages of it of this drama that we are fulfilling right that's being fulfilled right now brother Robert before mine and your eyes the first part of the drama is called the exposition the story starting point there had to be a prophet to start this thing there had to be a message to be preached that was the starting point it's the starting point is the setting of characters that's why I probably had to come and set every character and his possession to be placed as a son to receive adoption it's the extent of the story starts with the story's conflict God is safe Glory it ain't a flesh and blood Warfare Hallelujah the second part is the rising action it explores the is conflict up until the climax often things get worse because of wrong decisions that's what makes things worse be careful what decision you make you either decide to make a decision to follow Jesus or follow your emotions oh Hallelujah the third part of it is the climax every part of the drama is important but the climax is the landing spot or the turning point of the structure something had to turn us back to the faith of the father there had to be a message to bring a turning point come out from among them be not partakers of her to how can two walk together unless they agree can light and darkness have Fellowship the fourth part of it brother is the falling action is the aftermath of the climax it's the place where the director ties up the loose hands woo glory be to God we needed God to send us a prophet to tie up the loose end oh hallelujah what a message to time the loose to take us back to the unadulterated word of God back to the original faith and the fifth part is the resolution is how the story ends the final conclusion the enemy dies amen and the hero with the pride amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah huh in Hebrews 11 yes sir was the director's cut of the drama that David and Samuel and all them played out through there it cut out not the this it cut out this part and wrote about what happened here it said that Abraham stagger not at the promise of God it wrote what faith did it didn't write the failures of the flesh oh my oh you know what the director's Cut Is it's the director's original thought my sister What a Mighty God oh my that's why I can say who can lay any charge to God's elect for it's God that justifies it's God that makes it it's God that cleansed you it's God that WR you as [Applause] perfect hallelujah what a mighty God am about he just wrote that in mind your heart yes BR we are in the final stage of the drama the manifesting time of the Bride the opening of the word the third pull in manifestation oh Hallelujah written Epistles read of all men come St come now oh my what a what a message ain't you glad God wrote a director's cut on you he didn't write your sins he didn't
