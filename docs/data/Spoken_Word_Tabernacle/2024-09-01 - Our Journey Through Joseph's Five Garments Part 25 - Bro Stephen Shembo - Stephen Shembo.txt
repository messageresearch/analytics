some good quality family time by God's grace amen so we greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen I I tell you you got a big invisible audience you got a big church more than and what we have here and when you travel you find invisible audience people the brother St I don't even know them all I know his brother they are and and they just look at you they five Garment of J so they [Laughter] ride so it seems like everywhere I'm traveling I meet invisible audience I was in Kentucky and I meet the young men they came I didn't even know them they say can we take a picture I say Lord I don't even know where my picture is going they say we follow you I say oh God so you got a big church brothers and sisters somewhere amen people of like Precious Faith amen you know brother Abraham told me something he said brother Steven you won't know some of them until you get to heaven and he said because what happened some of them don't really subscribe but they just download the link I mean uh the the link and then they keep sharing the link right so he Tau me what the Holy Spirit brother Abraham is very very have a strong prophetic inside he say what the Lord does he uses your local church to stir the gift so when the gift is stirred the children of God worldwide are receiving what they needed so you've been so the credit to this ministry that doesn't come from me alone so it come from me and you because you're the one that make the gift operate so if somebody is blessed over there because you're saying amen because somebody's pulling somebody's thirsty that's the reason why God is doing what he's doing amen so all the family members here we do not have visitor every family members here God richly bless you and we welcome you and every new family members on line our invisible audience welcome to the channel of spoken word Tabernacle God richly bless you wherever you are amen there was a a brother he's in Canada and uh another brother call him and contact him to get my number so he asked me permission I said because this happen all the time I said you know what just go ahead and give it to him so when they give it to him he was calling from South Africa so I soon as I spoke to him he said pastor you don't know how we are so happy his wife was so on fire brother St we are listening I say my goodness this church is bigger so remember you got brothers and sisters somewhere amen so when we preach we want to be mindful of them and make sure everybody is Happy amen I believe you up to date with the sermon and each one of you are reading your Bible twice a day if you don't I tell brother Mickey to deal with you and we got a Cod Church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour amen Lord's willing stay in prayer this coming Saturday is our first couple meeting when I say first because I'm not going to stop now we get to go from month to month and then deal with this because these are very intense material so one day it's not going to finish it all so we're going to go part one part two part we finish we pick up another one so we make sure everybody is on the same page amen that has been said and since it's a banquet amen make sure you're there on time and we start at 2:00 sharp because you'll see everything laid out I already sent you the preview of the banquet and there are people far away they want to even get to this meeting they're asking for the link far away not even in the United States far away so you are most privileged if you there because you are there by God's grace so be there on time and we start sharp and we eat and fellowship a and then after that we break the seals amen and the expectation you are even fine I'm the one who will be talking over there you will be sitting enjoying so you should even say Amen am I wish I was also sitting there and then I was listening to somebody amen so this Saturday it's 2: p.m. be there on time by God's grace and after that on September the 21st it's going to be the young Sisters Meeting and September the 28th is question and answer so invisible audience you can see how my schedule is already booked so the 21st young sister the 28 is uh question and answer young Brothers I'm still waiting on brother Enoch to to tell me uh the date and probably seems like it's going to go toward October because everything is almost like booked in uh uh September amen everything went well in Boston God richly bless you you know this brother is part of the invisible audience I never met him before I don't even know him so he keep pulling he keep pulling and for some reason he can't get a hold of me so he called the dentist office he said brother stepen I was determined if you don't pick up the phone I would seek for an appointment and then I get there as a patient and as soon as I see you I say God bless you so I was going to see a brother I never met I don't even know his wife look at me he said this is really I don't understand this I even ask my husband do you know him say no we just chat and uh he keep pulling and pulling and pulling uh he he must have strong faith because I told him I say I can't make it but if I say I cannot he will feel bad I said at least I'm going to do one day I'm going to drop on Friday preach on on Friday and Saturday in the morning I 6:00 or 5:00 I have to wake up get in the airport and I'm back again in North Carolina so everything went well it's brother Joe he's a pastor and his wife his sister Sarah they were so excited and that's where I got in the car and I met somebody from in at church he said brother stepen I'm so good to ride with you in the same car I listen to you all the time I'm like visible audence so you got more V invisible audience over there already because they didn't want me to come back I thought the it's it's Labor Day weekend I thought the brother I have more excited stuff coming up I told the brother say there was even a sister saying that you better come back so I must come back because they it's not going to work amen amen Oh Glory gory to God and the Holy Spirit was there I preach a message I never preached before so I'm sorry I told uh brother Enoch go ahead and download the whole sermon and put on the title uh the holy spirit in all aspect foundation and put it in the church group chat so the church can have it because I had to preach to people who don't know the message I have to lay the prophet and then uh the holy ghost coming together and as I was talking I begin to learn things myself I don't even know I never even seen that Moses was a shadow of Pentecost he just hit me right there and those things were coming right there I was like my God this is something deep and I never seen the two Elijah dealing with the heart on Redemption like that so I learned myself I have to sit down and begin to listen to the sermon myself I say my goodness so the Holy Spirit was gracious to open more than that so I thought the pastor you take over from here he said brother Steven thank you so much I said you take over from here so you continue to see it's a Boston area it's a a lot of intellectual people over there and uh and it's crazy I know what he told me what's going on over there it's it's really you are fine here in North Carolina the pressure that is there you have no clue what is going on there it is more pressurized than anything and he's there trying to out I mean doing Outreach Ministry and trying to pull people into the message so God has been gracious so that's why we have to travel that way but if you know the message very well even if I didn't say brother Bram safe if you listen very good you will know where it's coming [Applause] from you don't learn those things from theology but brother brandham said the problem means we present the message wrong so when you're talking to the people outside the message you need to go through the scripture until the Holy Spirit tells you what to do then you bring the big cannon you say God send as a prophet amen for Jesus Christ to explain himself Jesus explained himself through the prophet he used the prophet to explain himself in other word no Prophet you won't understand Christ Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory to God Amen I'm so happy because the church is alive amen so you stay put because we got some uh big material today so even if you're in the bathroom because we put speaker there even if you are in the in the nursery make sure you don't shop here uh once you enter the building it's uh it's sacred wherever you are stay in tuned am amen even in the nursery make sure you stay under the holy spirit amen that's why I made that place a little bit smaller I told the Deacon so he can be uncomfortable so they can come back in church quickly because we need to train our children to stay in church amen yeah your child cannot go to the bathroom 10 times we need to lay hand on them if they sick brother brandham say when you bring a child to the church make sure they drink their water before service I have a coat amen anyway even if

your wife God bless you you can go sit [Applause] together amen you might be [Applause] [Laughter] seated so sister jera so you broke the seal you broke the seals of the the the the Seal of spoke word Tabernacle now it's an open passage she's not the only one so get line up and then uh everybody else [Applause] quickly amen amen Oh Glory to God do you see I told you I got some good excited stuff do you know what it means to be engaged I have not started preaching yet it's a Labor Day weekend I had a quote about it so I wanted to share but I kept the quot I say I'm going to share on under courtship with the younger sister because that's where we started and uh I will share the quot but I'm just going to read this the Bible says in the Book of Matthew chap 1 verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was what exp spous means engaged or fiance exped to Joseph before they came how so engagement is not coming together amen you are first engaged then you come together amen and you are Eng engage before you come together you don't come together and then you engaged and the Bible is in order right here you are engaged first then you come together and she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to do what to put somebody away means to divorce amen Amen in other word once you are engaged in the eyes of God you are married are we together are we together and the Bible say Joseph was a justment amen he didn't want to put her away publicly in other word whatever happened during engagement you need to learn how to protect one another even if you upset you learn how to protect one another nothing publicly are we together glory to God the Bible say but while he Tau on these things behold the angel of the Lord do you know who the angel of the Lord is the Angel of the Lord is the Lord himself the angel of the Lord appear unto him in the dream saying Joseph that son of David fear not to take unto the marry the wife so God recogniz Mary as a [Applause] wife are we together so when you are engaged and you give that promise right there you are sealed any trouble from there you are considered a divorce William Marion Bram after the seals my brother the brother the brother Bram say yes it was wrong for you to do that he was talking about getting married at the law before the church he said marriage belongs to who of God brother Angelo let's go ahead and crank that thing to the house of God but being that you are married here is when you are really married you are married when you vow one to the other when you promise one another D that you shall take one another so as soon as sister jha say [Applause] yes any brother in spoken word Tabernacle and any brother outside of spoken word Tabernacle she said jusia is taken am amen if you come with a dream and you say the Lord show me that sister je is your wife it's a wrong dream and any young woman in this church or outside the church no one has a right to go to brother blessing brother blessing is sealed [Applause] are we together are we together because the promises B you and brother Bram continue down in 183 he said but as far as mared when you do what promise her not when the preacher preach I mean come and blesses you right here when you promise her she takes your word and you take her word and who else God takes both your word that say see but just don't all promise unless Dash you feeling it amen I ask brother's blessing I say are you sure I said did you look at her very good I said because I'm a I'm a father to those kids and I don't want a headache because when I shoot I will shoot until until I take the job down so make sure you are okay make sure you investigate everything make sure you have your good background check because once it's seal that's it all I'm waiting for is the big day so we can bless and then from there we move on to baby [Applause] shower amen amen amen so officially married but not come together yet it means there are some limitations amen you can talk together but you cannot touch one another I see craziness in this message and they even post them and they put them on the church uh website I say what is wrong what is wrong people who are engaged and then the they are the one carry the woman like this and put the woman on something is wrong brother brandham say if you a normal man and when a woman touches you if you don't feel something then you are abnormal amen amen so stay respect one another and let's pray for you quickly so God will provide everything and then you can get married as soon as possible but welcome to the married CLE uh you got really fortunate and we're going to open your brain over there will open your mind amen so once again brother blessing and sister jerusa congratulations let's give the Lord a big [Applause] CL amen now you can turn your time clock on

service unto thy hand bless us oh God and seal the de out of this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen Psalm 82 do you see how long we can linger in one scripture and every time we read it it's like a new scripture amen it's the power of the seals can you hear me okay amen blessed be the name of the Lord verse one the Bible says God you stay really put because I'm trying to get this message really deep so you can get free I already got testimony of how God is already losing up people I even got a minister send me a text he said but Stephen I when he listen they he he listened to every ceremony almost he say but Stephen I find myself in a prodal son amen so you will not progress in this life freely if you don't understand these things if you don't understand Romans 7 and the way God look at you you will be miserable in Christianity and Christianity will appear like something that is not fun that you feel always like you are condemned and and and then it seems like you're not free because you don't understand this kind of stuff amen so I go slowly and I dig deep so you can be free once for all amen the Bible says God stands in the congregation of the M you might be seated you already understand who is the m amen come or what the Bible says he judges among the gods who judges among the gods so gods amen amen sorry sister that we try be here amen God's amen judges amen among Gods amen it looks like these Gods cannot be judged by anyone amen are we together these gods are only judged by [Applause] God if you're not God you cannot judge them for you to say something to this God for you to condemn this God you must be God Amen in other word whatever everyone speak will never affect this [Music] God only what God speak affect these [Applause] Creature if you tell this creature this God this speci right here if you tell tell them you will die it won't happen no sir if God say you will die it will happen right so to judge the gods you must be God Only God judges the God I know we claming my friend job says this in job if if you understand this it's powerful job says this in job 21:22 the Bible say shall any teach God knowledge seeing he judges those that are where high God judges those that are high so these gods are not lower creatur you will catch up later my friend in First Corinthians chapter 2:15 the the Bible say but he that is how spiritual judges what all things yet he himself is Judge of no [Applause] man if somebody is spiritual which these gods are because they are spiritual amen this God can judge anything amen but no man can judge those God Only God can judge the gods are we together in other words there is no one that can judge anybody who is God in other word there is no human being that can judge a god even if a God is in error [Applause] for you to judge him are we together you must be a god Israel sin one time and they did something bad are we together and BAC look he say oh I see fault in Israel ah now this is the best time I'm going to curse them and he called a prophet amen and he gave the prophet money he said come and curse these people because I found fault on them amen the prophet went and called God on the scene and baac was standing beside the prophet and when the prophet open up his mouth with the intention of cursing suddenly his speech changed people will fult but when the the prophet begin to speak under the anointing he said I see no iniquity in [Applause] Jacob and Bam say wait a minute you don't see what they did over there and BAC said I mean baac said you don't see what they did there and Bam say I don't see anything because you don't J man cannot judge these Gods Only God can judge the Gods man who say this God did something wrong but God says there is no iniquity in them and the Bible say let everybody's word be a lie only God's word be the truth so who do you listen to because no one can judge you only God what is God telling you what is your neighbor telling you what are are the young people telling you what is God telling [Music] you these Gods nobody can judge them no human being can judge them you must be God if you God you can talk to God Amen are we together don't worry my friend let me look at another scripture you will clam up with me Revelation 12:10 the Bible say and I heard a loud voice saying where in heaven now is come salvation and what strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is what cast down which accuse them when for our God how day and night so the devil cannot be your judge the Bible call the devil an accuser because to be a judge you must be [Applause] God Only God can judge the gods Lord help me the devil according to the scripture he is called an accuser right an accuser doesn't [Music] judge the devil is an accuser amen an accuser doesn't judge an accuser only bring fact amen but the one who judge is God Amen so no matter what the devil accuses you [Applause] of doing all have done in the past the last verdict will never come from the devil in other words when Satan talk to you just remember whatever he's telling you is not def F of judgment it's only accusation amen amen amen the judge is God let me continue further in 1 John Chapter 2 verse1 the Bible say my little children John these things right I unto you that you do what John don't want you to sin but and if any man what s we have what Advocate an advocate with the father who is The Advocate Jesus Christ the what so your God who is the judge is also your Advocate are we together so when the devil accuses you God defend you God plead for you in other word the devil cannot have answer toward your life until he deal with God two ways he must deal with God as a lawyer first but God is not the lawyer of the devil he is your lawyer and when he finish talking to God as a lawyer God change and become a [Applause] judge how can your lawyer condemn you in other word there is no case that the devil can bring before God about you and succeed [Applause] because the devil to begin with cannot judge you you can only judge by God and to defend you it takes only God to defend you are we together remember the devil is not a Creator only people who create hand the staff of people who creat only God Hand the God if you don't create yet you already in a different category in other don't worry my friend let's continue the Bible says this in Roman 8:31 he said what shall we then say to these things if God be for what us if God is your judge and your lawyer and he is for you now you begin to understand the Bible say who can be how against us amen Roman 8:33 who shall lay what anything to the charge of what God's elect it is God that do what judges because it's God who is the judge justify brother Bram say you never done it so regardless of how much the devil talk you need to know who you listening to are you listening to God or are you listening to the devil the judge is not the devil the judge is God and whatever God say is correct but it looks like the accuser have more success than the judge praise God amen who is he that do what commend condemneth it is Christ that did what die where he paid the price that is what risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh what intercessions for us amen he's the one that judges he's the one that is your lawyer he's the one that make intercession for you and no one can judge you only God but you can judge everybody the Bible said the saint will judge the Earth why are you going to sit on the throne of God to do what to judge who amen you can judge all things amen but no one can judge you that no one means no human being can judge you your friend cannot judge you there is no preacher in this message that can tell you you are not brother there is no one in this message that can tell you you are off the mercy of God hallelujah only God can do [Applause] that don't worry my friend we are claming together let's go to verse seven God judges among the gods only God judges this creature the Bible say in verse six I have said ye are Gods we found out that there is amnesia there amen verse six there is amnesia amen the children of God don't know that they are God so God is reminding them that ye are God are we together amen he says that I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high amen am but you shall die like men amen these Gods amen these children of the most high God Amen oh glory to God have a problem with death because they mortal amen but what I'm trying to highlight here they have a problem with death are we together there but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes so they got a problem with death and fall amen when you look at these two words death and fall amen he reminders of Eden are we there because the fall happen in Eden that's why God said the day you eat there of that day you will die are we together so this Gods here are affected with something that started in Eden amen why Eden because in Eden there was no death in Eden there was no fa in Eden everything was perfect in Eden Man was created in the image and the likeness of God in man was God remember we already went there Adam in Eden was a God so God is saying that this creature has been affected with something that happened in Eden it looks like whatever started in Eden is keep going on and on and on and on and on until the gods lost the [Music] identity are we together then God comes back and say ye are Gods I know in other word ye are Gods but I know that you are affected with what happened in Eden are we together are we together jum to verse eight the Bible say we have not read verse eight yet arise oh God and do what judge the Earth so God verse seven verse six amen it's about these are Gods identity we clear verse seven it's about what happened in Eden what happened in Eden affect us amen then on verse eight the Bible say AAS amen if AAS then arise who arise who who's going to arise God Arise oh God if you tell God to arise so God will SE it put your seat belt my friend are we together if you say arise oh God so God will seated are we together so God will move from his seat to do what judge judge so God will as to be a judge so these scriptures speak of the second [Applause] [Music] coming of Jesus Christ because Jesus on the second coming he's not coming as a lamb he's coming as a lion the lion of the tribe of Judah he's coming as a judge are we together are we together are we together the Bible says arise oh God to do what judge he's Rising as the judge of the earth it's a second coming of Christ amen a rise oh judge judge oh God judge the Earth for you shall inherit all what nations before God inherit All Nation follow me carefully he must judge the Earth are we together but the inheritance of All Nation amen speak of the Millennium amen so let me quien you your nerve a little bit because uh I don't want somebody to get uh lost the Bible say says in Roman 8 there is therefore now no what condemnation to them which are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of what sin and death so there is a law of sin and death the law of sin and death and this is what brother Bram says so you get this clearly brother Bram said law of sin and death I was set free from it you once you were once bound there you see but now you are free from that as I said this morning death only abids in Sin Sin and death is what the same because the death is the wages of sin but when you are away from sin you are away from death but while you are in sin you are in death see and therefore when you are free from the law of sin and death you are a new creature in Christ Jesus and then you are free now coming back to inherit All Nation brother Bram says this in the message Elijah he says over in the Book of Revelation when John the Revelator saw that Christ was falling air to it he said rejoice in ye heaven and all ye Earth for the kingdom of this world has what become has become some somebody's inheriting has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Crist and he will rule and Reign How many years a thousand years which is the Millennium on the earth now we are looking for that great what millennium day the time when all the trouble and Dr and everything will be how settled brother Bram says here Jesus knowed he will fall head to them where in the millennium because the devil call him and show him everything and say I'm going to give you all this Kingdom if you can Bow Down and Worship and Christ refused brother Bram said the reason why Jesus refused is because he knew that somehow he's going to inherit all of them inherit all of them where in the millennium are we together brother Bram say because Jesus know he fall air to them when in the Millennium so he said get the hands what he knew that God will give him all of the kingdom and they will be his and they shall all be one Kingdom so coming back to deep Psalm in verse six we are Gods because of a problem with identity in verse seven something started in Eden that is still has been perpetuated in verse 8 then God will arise to judge the Earth which which is speaking about the second coming and then he will also inherit all nation which talk about the Millennium because after the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ then we go through the tribulation and then the Millennium come in other words this prophecy of Psalm 82 is a prophecy of the end [Applause] time are we together it's a prophecy that will happen before the second coming of Jesus Christ are we together are we together before Jesus Christ come and judge this Earth and bring us into the Millennium sons of God that have been affected by their fall of Adam must be free from death and the fall and must come to their own identity as Gods as long as we are not Gods we cannot go and rule in a millennium amen that's why eus was never promis a throne SM was never promis a throne only the last age of the Gentile the Bible say in the last stage which is the age of laia to to whom that will overcome there I will make him sit on the throne because the one who sit on the throne must be God to rule and reign in the Millennium so this prophecy here belong to this time are we together are we together Paul could not fulfill this prophecy am the only one who spoke about it is Jesus Christ after Jesus cross everybody hash because it's for the end time because after this prophecy is fulfilled that the that the children of God recognize that they are Gods what follow is God will rise as the lion and come in the second coming to come and go ahead and judge the Earth are we together and after that we go into the Millennium it's a prophecy that concern the seveny because the seven seal is what bring chist down on earth and the Seven seal areer in the Millennium you cannot have Christ without the seven SE and you won't have the Millennium without the seven and the God won't be God without the seven because when the that's why in Revelation 10 the book of redemption that was taken by God he sent back again because Adam is back gods are back we are restored Back to Eden you can receive the book of redemption and begin to do what Adam did and when you do that then Jesus will come as a church and then from there we go into the millennium are we together are we together keep your seat belt we on a bumy road my friend as we keep climbing let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 15 the scripture hold more than what you see with your eyes and if you look always between the scripture there is a a a white uh a white color there is a white color between the scripture amen if you dare you can say amen and those white color between the scripture it's stuff between the lines I can't hear you honey I can't hear you Second Coming second coming I say second coming it's [Laughter] there amen glory to God you know in the vision of Junior Jackson that's right do you know everything the the mountain was written and when the mountain was written on the top when they cut the rock they open it there was a rock there and nothing was written there but there were stuff written there that's why the Bible have a stuff I mean a space that is notar written and a space that is written because brother Bram say that Mountain was the Bible so when you open the Bible you will see scripture but in between scripture there is a white space the white space is the message of brother BR the white space that you see in the Bible it's the message of brother BR that's why this scripture when we continue to peel him off we see things laying under you didn't know that AO God means the second coming he was right there but he was already closed but because the seal was broken and the Seven Seal The Rock was open now we can see what is in the Rock and bring the interpretation of the unwritten word but if you open it it will never contradict the Bible because it's coming from the space of the Bible that's why you heard brother Bram say reading between the when you look in your Bible between the landine it's white that's right there are stuff written there [Laughter] let's go to Luke chap 15: 10 if you thereare you can say amen amen don't pull me toward the seven seal my friend ver the Bible say likewise I say unto you there is joy in the what the presence of of what of the angels of the angels of God over one what sinner that do what repent so if a sinner repent there is a feast among the angel one sinner sh one sinner repenting shake the Angels sh and you want to be like a servant you want to be like an angel remember Solomon do you remember Solomon you remember this in ecclesiast Solomon say I have seen who upon horses and prin doing what walking a servant upon what the Earth he didn't say that the princes were servant they are working as servant so when they work you look at them they work is like a walk of a servant but they are princes if you ask them you look he's a prince but his mentality his morale is the mentality of a servant and that mentality so strong on him until he begin to work behave like a servant while he's a prince but when one of those repent servant begin to Rejoice job to verse2 my friend and the younger one of them say to his father Lord help me move through the scripture father give me the portion of goods that fall to me was those things belonging to him yes why did he ask the father for it belong to did he work for it no it was everything belonged to the father he asked it by inheritance that's right it was not for him everything belong to the Father the father gave him those that Portion by inheritance knowing that he will fall are we together it is the father that gave him the inheritance but he knew that whatever I'm going to give it to him he's going to fall but he never stopped from giving to him God gave us this Earth and gave adam this Earth but brother Bram say God knew that man will fall [Applause] if your if your brother if your son come to you and he doesn't know how to drive follow me carefully because I'm I'm um um I have to use some different tools like so I can open up the way some bulldozer to break some stuff if your son come to you and he doesn't know how to drive and then he said Daddy I can drive I can dve are you going to give him the car you will never do it right amen this boy came and said divide my inheritance brother Bram say the father already knew that the boy has already a problem amen how why do you give a child that you already know have a problem and you still give him a car this is what God did this is what this father knew the father knew that the boy have a problem no normally the father should say no I cannot give you my inheritance because you're going to spoil it but this father took it and give it to him knowing he's going to fall are we together are we together I know it's hard my friend but let's continue knowing he's going to fall and the younger verse uh 13 and not many days after that after the younger son gathered all together and took two and and took his journey into a far country and there he wasted his substance the substance the father gave it to him with riotous living amen and when he had span all destroy all the inheritance There Rose a mighty femin in that land and he began to be in want Follow Me Now carefully amen jum to verse 17 and when he came to himself you know what he means here amen he said how many hired servant of my fathers have breed enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger you with me yes let's go brother Angel I will arise and go to my father thank you Lord and I will say to him what father okay number one father go ahead my friend I have sinned against heaven I have sin against heaven and before Thee I have Sinn against Heaven amen and before thee we clear continue and what else and am no more worthy to be I am not worthy Amen to be called thy son thy son and what else make me as one of thy hard servants make me as one of the hired servant so the there is three things here number one it's a repentance amen number two is his opinion are we together number three is again his uh judgment are we together so when the son is going home he have three things in mind number one when I meet Daddy I Repent number two I'm going to give him my opinion about the circumstances of what happened and number three I'm going to give him the verdict are we together my sentence amen I I'm reading is my Bible different than your Bible I need to free you my friend I know why the devil is troubling you are you going to be free amen number one I'm going back to my father and I'm going to repent everybody love that and when I Repent to my father number two what I would do I give him my opinion about the situation I say based on my assessment based on everything that I look up and remembering myself because I'm my own witness I know what I did myself nobody can tell me I know I have my own camera I recorded everything in my memory and my memory can remind me what I did at what time at what place and which year I remember all of that so based on based on my analysis this is my verdict amen amen my opinion and my verdict or my sentence everything is finished follow me carefully amen jump to verse uh where are we at verse uh uh 20 20 20 you there uhhuh and the Bible say and he arose and came to his father but when he saw the father when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and his father did what he R there is a difference between waiting for somebody that's true and running towards [Applause] somebody I don't know if you I don't know that devil will go the devil that is troubling you but you going to get it amen Amen brother Charles if you told Brother polycarp Jr you say brother polycarp at 6:00 you need to go back in the house and brother polyp is coming at 11:00 p.m. amen amen brother Charles will be standing there right waiting for him yeah and probably by the time he he begin to park on the parking lot he's already under the anointing the anointing of yelling and whooping and and everything he's he's already even shaking he's already trembling why because he's waiting for a criminal are we together are we together are we together sister Ed if your sister who is in Panama amen tell you that she's coming and it has been 20 years and you have not seen that sister and then suddenly brother Jeffrey goes to the airport and pick up auntie and When Auntie is coming as soon as they open the door are you going to wait for your sister and begin to clap hand what are you going to do you will run quickly and and hug her and kiss her because you are welcoming somebody that you miss for a long time are we together are we together so when the prodigal son is coming with all his fault being a bad boy having wreck the record of his father instead of daddy waiting for him and say now finally the day have come daddy is running to him welcoming him as a good person that is coming to [Applause] home are we together are we together the Bible say in verse 20 that he saw him far and had compassion and run and did what on fell on his neck and did what kissed him did you see daddy saying anything amen he spoke by his action that's right amen the running have a message I have just explained to you the hugging has a message they kissing have a message which brother brh said that kiss took the sin away are we together so the father responded with a set of action are we together then when he stop the tape begin to play yes follow me carefully remember our recording tape is father I have sin against heaven and against thee repentance the second one I am not worthy to be called that son my opinion and the third one make me as one of your highest servant which is my sentence let's listen to the tape together we read this together but you're going to see something different amen amen you there verse 21 and the son said to him yes Father I have Sinn against heaven and in your sight in in your sight so the first part of the tape played amen are we together did you see the father interrupting him follow me carefully amen then he continue with the tape yes re can I continue and the son said to him father I have Sinn against heaven and in your sight come and I am no more worthy to be called your son he rehearsed the second part yes amen yes now we are waiting for the third part father follow me carefully the third part is make me as what one of your higher servant as soon as he spoke the second part with together we together verse 22 but in other way the contradiction Rose exactly right the father never let him Express the last sentence verify in your Bible my friend verify your Bible amen the the the the prodal son never had a chance yes sir to express his judgment hallu Hall he expressed his repentance and then when he begin to speak about his opinion daddy could not stand that opinion his father interrupted him in other word the first part you were right by the second part you begin to speak rubbish you begin to talk garbage I can't give you no more time because if I let you continue you going to tell me to hire you as a servant the voice of God interrupted him are we together are we together are we together are we together so the third part is about being make me as one of your what servants he concerned servant follow me carefully this boy never spoke it he spoke it in a far away country when he was himself but when he got there The Following part was about servant now look what is Daddy talking when he pushed the break look what Daddy's telling are we there verse 22 but the father say to his what servant ah the part that he was about to introduce the father sto him first and then before he say make me like the servant the father turned to the servant in other word daddy caught the unspoken [Music] part are you following me are you following me he CAU the outspoken part because the child already put himself as a servant so Daddy went straight where the problem is and [Applause] busted and busted that judgment because he's the one to judge it is not you that make the Judgment Only God can judge [Applause] God hallah [Music] we together we got one God and gods amen only the big God judge gods do you follow me in other word you cannot even judge yourself because sometime you call yourself stupid sometime you beat yourself you say I'm make so make mistake sometime you look at yourself like dumb is that a correct [Applause] [Music] judgment are we together are we together so the first one Ur repentance as soon as he begin to deviate God interrupted him like on more Transfiguration when Peter begin to deviate brother Bram said the voice interrupted him and say hey Peter he him in other word you going to introduce something bad you are introducing denomination again son you started very good you already repented for your sin now why are you building up a complex I can't let you talk anymore I'm going to go where the problem is you servant take care of him in other word what you were thinking about me I'm reminding you you still on top of [Applause] them are we together your seeming never change your position it is not because you SE Angel are your companion No Angel go ahead and serve him are we together are we together let's go to verse 22 and but and contradiction the father say to him he says what bring forth the what hallu somebody called it the father didn't say bring the Rob and the father never say bring the best of the robes so in that house there was one Rob I'm reading the Bible my friend I have not even stopped preaching in that house there was only one robe that everybody knew that he was the best robe because for you to send angelu for you to send servant to go pick up the best robe the servant must know which one is the best oh spoken word maybe when that robe was purchase people were asking Master is this for you he said no say h such a good suit like this such an expensive suit for who no maybe the son came and said Daddy is that suit for me no am are we together are we together I don't know how many years he left the father home before he come maybe a d time he was smaller than the robe so so he need to take some time and grow up so by the time he's coming the Rob will fit [Applause] him are we together are we together and not only bring the RO but bring the best Ro amen the best Rob is only given to the best [Applause] person follow me carefully sister jerusa have made a wedding in Sister jerusha's wedding you will when you will get to the wedding you will see they are table and they are also table amen when you come they will tell you sit here when you come they will tell you sit here but when somebody else come they will say uh you don't sit here you follow me and they ask follow me they want to see they say not keep moving forward and they're going to put him in a certain place so the place depend on who that person is if the son have to be given the best rob it means that son was the best so the best for God doesn't mean you never make mistake [Applause] [Music] I hope you understanding [Music] me brother Bram say you see I have not even brother Bram say from Enoch to this day there is no one like him I have the qu the only only one above brother Bram is Jesus Christ I have the he said from Enoch to him there is nobody in other word Abraham is below brother [Applause] Bram do you have teeth do you have teeth I can give you denture spiritual denture so you can chew this meat do you follow me brother I'm saying from Enoch to him no one like him are we together but that person that is above even Abraham wanted to kill somebody thought lie to the Jew he want even to smoke if he was not the angel of the Lord in other word a sinner like that so so to be best doesn't mean you won't have problem [Applause] because before the foundation of the world brother Bram say God has an [Music] album K I wish I was in the prison and brother Bram said before you come in this world you were existing somewhere the one that was existing somewhere is this God here and God took your picture Hallelujah over here amen so when you came down you had a tattoo by your tattoo will never enter here that's why when God look at you he doesn't look at this flesh right here he's calling you best by his own album brother was a SE sa by grace brother Bram had a bad temper and yet he's the [Applause] best are we together are we together so bring the best robe and give it to this child H the best robe which child father do you mean the one who stays here and say ah I know that one he has his own part but this one why he wanted to put himself as a highed servant Hallelujah and God turned around he say servant give him the best do you know that robe that is over there the one you always ask me who he belongs to now it's the time for him together and don't stop on the robe and put on him what put a ring on him he didn't get that ring when he was leaving home and put a shoe on his feet do you follow me verse 23 and bring here the what the fatted C and do what kill it and let us what eat push the break my friend if we bring a cow here and we cut the cow we kill him do we kill the cow and put it and start eating it what do we do cook it meaning there was a time a preparation time amen hallelujah between the dressing and the preparation of the feast hallelujah hallelujah do you think the servant will look at the son with all the beard going on and just take the white robe and put on him there was a time before the feast amen there was a preparation time when they took the boy and clean him up and shave him very good and on the same time they are making preparation of the boy at the same time they are also making a preparation for the wedding [Applause] serent on the same time God is preparing you with his word in spoken word Tabernacle God is also preparing event once you are finished with this and you are ready now and you are well dressed and shoes on your feet then your supper is also ready so you leaving from a preparation to the wedding [Applause] supper hallu are we together are we together amen question did you see the father coming back again and saying thank you for repenting absolutely not did you see the father doing anything extra to show the child that you know I already forgive you yeah don't be like this what the father did once the hugging the running and the kissing is enough it's up to you child to be updated are we together so when if somebody come and say you a bad child do you kiss a bad child you remind that person that if I was that bad why do I get the B why did daddy kiss me why did have you ever heard daddy condemning me so you must have an answer to whoever will accuse you because their purpose is to bring you down because they cannot stop the father doing things for you now they will come to make your M your mentor depressed so you don't enjoy the things that God give [Applause] you I don't know if you understand what I'm saying I don't know if you understand what I'm saying yes sir if I invite somebody I invite brother set I say come to my home we cook very well are you are you following me and brother said I said brother said don't eat because here everything is pack and brother said he coming say ah I'm going to eat today brother St and I take a picture and I say brother said look at what is happening to you so he put him on the expectation that oh my God this is what I like I'm coming there amen if brother said enter into my house follow me carefully and go and sit down and eat he will enjoy his meal do you follow me but if I ordered the meal from somebody do you follow me and that person is still around when brother set come amen and when brother set sat on the table and the person say hm I was expecting somebody bigger than you to eat such a meal do you follow me brother set still have the meal but that word can torment him until he cannot enjoy the meal with the same enthusiasm as he was coming that's what the devil do to you the person knows that it is already f the child has been restored everything belong

happening over there they say you know what your brother came back all we know is your brother came back are we together let's go to our third reading amen amen oh God if you fool we stop amen amen because Paul also built this complex the best remember doesn't mean he never made mistake are we there God have 12 disciple that walk with him eight with him did everything one of them was knocked out amen and the one that was knocked out was Judah amen and Judah had to be replaced sir amen and the disciple made a vote and they replac him by Maas and nothing happened in the scripture with Matias and brother Bram said the choice of God was not Matias the choice of God was Paul are we together if you notice Paul never preached with Jesus so the best of the disciple was kept outside so everything disle can even brag me I slept with Jesus Christ we ate with Jesus Christ we did with it doesn't mean you the [Applause] best I'm trying to free you if you ate with brother Bram that's [Applause] fine if you hunted with brother Bram that's fine it doesn't mean you the best the best might be out of season [Applause] so I'm not complex with what you did around brother because I know who I [Applause] am are we together are we together and look at Paul when he comes in because everybody knew that Paul damaged the church and did this and did this and God let the best make mistake [Music] is my Bible different than you God let the best make mistakes and when he made so much Havoc it damaged so much then God came down and call him by the name [Music] s hallu [Applause] disciple saw Jesus Christ in the flesh but Paul saw him in the original [Music] form the only one who could match Paul was Moses because the pillar of fire that was with Moses came back with Paul Hallelujah galatian chapter 1 verse 13 for ye have heard of what my conversation in what this conversation means my life in the past in the what in Jewish religion my covering how that beyond what meure I did what I persecuted the Church of God and did what all of you have that some of you have Rec some of you have video some of you have letter with my signature all of you know about some of you were there witness we saw you you're the one that was holding the clo to Steven are we together Paul say and last of all he was sin of who as of one born where who thought you he was out of du time he start building complex he said for I am the what least of the apostles who told you you were the least of the Apostles he begin to build complexes amen I was the list of the apostle that I am not me to be called a what I am not me to be called your son because of what Paul did Paul himself brought his verdict his opinion himself based on the way I destroyed the church I am not me to be called an apostle how many times do you read in the Bible Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of [Applause] God how many times did you read that in the Bible and Paul say I am not me to be called what because I did what persecuted the Church of God who told you when you persecute the Church of God you're not an apostle does Apostle is Apostle qualified by how good you treat the church Apostle is predestinated before the foundation of the world Amen and Paul say bad contradiction in other word there is two PS here there is two PA here there is Paul and Paul there is Paul and Paul the first Paul when he talk you will recognize him by the guiltiness you will recognize him by the complex that's Paul the human being Paul the human being will always be complex when he saw Peter he will be complex because he did something wrong to the church that's one Paul but and another Paul [Music] [Applause] Rose you don't understand when The Prodigal Son spoke the first thing the father was quiet when he spoke the second thing and begin to go out of line the father interrupted me when the first Paul begin to talk and he begin to get out of life yes sir the Paul God that was in Paul begin to speak interrupted [Applause] him are we together are we together and that Paul say but by what I am what I am [Music] amen hallah you got to encourage yourself in the Lord he says I am what I am and his grace which was what bestowed upon me was what not in vain but I did what labor more abund labor I labor more abundantly than what they all this is a different Paul talking in other word if I stay on my complex I cannot progress with the kingdom matter of fact my grace is greater than them because the best always come the ministry of the Gentile was not given to any Apostle but Paul and Paul called himself a master builder he said I have laid the foundation you don't understand me Paul say listen to me if anyone that's right come even in n from Heaven any disciple preaches contrary to me who persecuted the church call them an aema call them [Music] [Applause] curse Church you got to rise up more in the worst age the bad age the age of laia that's the age God chose to bring the best [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Glory GL time gone he says but I labor more abundantly than what they are yet not to who I but what the grace of God which was what with me it was not me working there was a God in [Applause] Me Hallelujah are we together are we together remember Romans 7 in you as according to the outer men sin but according to the inward man you want to serve the Lord you got to differentiate between you and you amen amen the only one who can judge a God is God you cannot judge yourself you cannot turn around and say if if God would have listened to Paul saying I'm not an apostle in other word when God look in the book he said Paul is an apostle and Paul over there say I'm not worthy to be called an apostle so who taugh you that to be an Apostle you got to be [Applause] sinless what about Peter who lied three times and who even Cur and after he did all of them ah I'm going to stop here my friend because my time is up Jesus said Peter I pray for you I'm talking to Children Of God if you take this in the wrong way you were a wrong seed why didn't Jesus pray for him not to curse not to deny Jesus only prayed for him to preserve his faith but he let him make a mess then after he make the mess Jesus come and say Peter have you repented to me no do you love me that's all I want do you love me do you love me do you love me you love me I know your mistake I know your complex but you feed my sheep and on the day of Pentecost the first Apostle that preach the gospel it is Peter yes sir and Peter put the prescription repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the promise is unto you who are you pet to establish the church can I shock you again when they want to give the Holy Ghost to the gentle only Peter only Peter can go to the Gent not anybody else Peter do you see why the devil was fighting you because you are the best [Applause] yes the devil don't fight you for nothing he fight you because you are the best the more loyal the more the test the more your qualiity bigger the more the challenge spoken word the more the Ministries the more I'm expecting the devil and when he comes it is written it is written it is written

once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you the one guiding and leading this church I am just an instrument and I have to obey and follow follow you because you are the bus you're the one that know what you want to speak to your children and today you saw it fit that you can talk to them about what we just went through father may you help each one of us not to be bitten down by the devil may we understand what you did on Calvary may we understand the power of the blood may we understand who we are May Lord father you break every complexes in the life of your children because this Tormentor have been bringing our life miserable troubling us on every side every day when we wake up he's right there trying to remind us about something try to tell us about something try to point us about a failure try to point us about a weakness try to point us about a situation that we have been praying for years and we have not gotten an answer yet not that you won't answer it but the pressure will be on the time because he want us to see you as a bad father but we know who you are you are our father you are the good father Lord you're the one that care for us you're the one Lord father that redeem us you're the one that send your angel to turn us around so that we can come back in a correct path Lord may you help your
