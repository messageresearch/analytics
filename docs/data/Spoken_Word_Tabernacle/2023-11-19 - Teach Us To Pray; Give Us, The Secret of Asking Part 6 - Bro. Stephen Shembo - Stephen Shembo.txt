========================================

oh when man sinned he crossed a great Chasm but put between him and God leaving his way back none and then God took a substitute offered a substitute and accepted it then if man would accept this substitute for his place then he could cross back into fellowship with God as it said at the beginning and then man for years went about through the blood of goats and sheep and animals they could never take away sin it only covered sin but then what happened what happened one day there comes something that could remit sin the blood of his own son and he remitted sin now here not long ago I won't know there may be scientists that here I'm going to make a remark and I'm just going to call it something it doesn't mean that at all but I'm going to say we used to we get like one little

message of the hour amen amen remember your pastor reminds you all the time you need to be in the word amen Lord's willing the next question and answer is on December the 23rd someone ask a question yesterday about the the building fund and the progression of the building and uh I was trying to give a report but we want to do it uh in a confidential because it belongs to the people of the church so Lord's willing on December the 23rd we will take 10 or 15 minutes just to tell you where we are with the building project and what we have and what we planning and how we trying to execute the project and everything so make sure you are there if you have any question you come on December the 23rd because we cannot put it up on YouTube right here it have to be on the private meeting so we kind of give you a briefing on where we are what we're trying to accomplish because I don't want to say something here and everybody else is the Lord put in their heart and I know the Lord is dealing with people in this church and changing lives in a tremendous way you probably don't know it but I know it because I'm a pastor amen so at the end of the service brother Robert please if you would remind me we will have a service award of baptism service and we go ahead and handle it Lord's willing again on December the second that will be our young sisters meeting and then the it looks like there was a conflict so it's impossible for me to announce the young men's meeting I'll have to communicate back and forth again with brother uh abble so we make sure the data are not conflicting one another any question so far everybody clear amen let's go ahead and climb into the word believe I got everything covered you need your Bible because we need to dig into certain things let's go to Deuteronomy 8 again it's hard to move away from certain scripture how can you preach the entire Bible now if one scripture is keep coming up coming up coming up coming up so by the time we get to the second scripture the third the fourth we already in the [Laughter] Rapture amen and scripture have layers Deuteronomy chapter 8:2 again when we're reading this you should have now a clear background of what's going on if you there you can say Amen my you there yes sir ready amen okay I love him he's on fire I can't wait to see him preaching one [Applause] day he engages me and him okay it's me and him and the Lord so don't get in between he's under training am any problem it will be a pleasure for me to be sitting here and see young men preaching here on fire and I just take two two or three weeks vacation and then I just sit and then let them go ahead and and preach amen we have a new musician brother Joshua was here that's a new additive to the musician so we need to have also new preacher we have new singers and [Music] everything don't worry unbelief will not hinder God whether you believe it or not you won't hinder god let's go my friend amen amen and you shall remember you remember this now it's important for you to understand and to remember we clear and you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God LED you these 40 years in the wilderness bad experience but you want to you need to understand and to remember this to Humble you you understand this now and to prove you and to know what was in your heart whether you would keep his Commandments or no and he humbled you and allow you to hunger God is doing this and fed you with Mana because his testing is not he's not the author of frustration that's right which you knew not neither did your fathers knows you understand this now that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only or bread alone you might be seated but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord does Man live so how many food do we have two we have a natural food which we call bread amen amen sometime the scripture call that meat amen amen and we have a spiritual food which is what the word of God amen verse four your Remnant what not old upon you neither did your foot swell these 40 years we clear jum to verse 15 please who led you to through that great and terrible Wilderness so he was not a pleasant Wilderness it was a bad one amen amen through that great and terrible uh uh wilderness wherein were what fiery serpent how can God lead you where there is fiery serpent hey is my Bible different than yours no sir no sir so don't start please okay okay so we in were fiery serpents and what scorpions God leading you in a place he knows that there is fiery Serpent and there is Scorpion you need need to understand who God is amen amen and drought where there was what no water so he brought them in the place where there is no bread amen and also there is no water how can you take children into a journey into a place where there is no bread there is no uh water and there is all kind of Scorpion and fiery serpent all kind of danger who is doing this God who's leading Israel the pillar of fire so the pillar of fire is bringing you in the midst of trouble to kill you for you to learn something amen amen where there was no water who brought you forth water out of what the rock of Flint do you know what Flint means it's it's a it's a it's a hard surface in other word brother Bram say the hardest surface in the wilderness is a rock and and God brought water from the hardest surface not the softest one you're going to believe that quickly he brought surface he brought water in a surface that you cannot believe water can come out so water came there was water but water was in a rock Flint Rock very hard surface amen verse 16 who fed you in the wilderness with Mana which your father knew not that he might humble you and that he might prove you come what is the purpose to what to do ye good at thy latter End Amen so after the Wilderness what comes next the Promised Land after trial after test something good must come it's a principle that's right that's it that's it amen amen all of this for a purpose to do you good amen you must go through that then at the end I'm going to do you good we clear but remember the Wilderness what happened in the wilderness God created man what happened in the wilderness God brought water out of a hard surface the hardest surface what happened also in the wilderness what else happened amen let's go to Matthew chapter 6 glory to God we are capping the state of the Brad before the Rapture and then once we go go back to roof we get the change of the body and we s it we clear Matthew 6: 7 if you dare you can say amen amen but when you pray use not vain repetitions you understand this now amen as the Heathen do for they thing that they shall be heard for they're much what speaking so talking too much doesn't give you the answer amen we clear amen verse 7 8 uh verse 8 be not you therefore like them this is the problem for your father knows what thing you have need of Amen how does God know because you taught him no when does God God know before you ask him if he knows before we ask him why do we need to ask please if you if you already know what to do why do you want me to ask you just do it God knows he knows before he knows before you ask amen he already knows what you're coming for before you pray God already knows if God already know why do we need to pray why do we need to ask why do we need to ask why do we need to pray why can we just sit down and then the Lord who knows everything we have just an order automatic deposit oh because they already know what to do he knows your address he knows who you are he knows what you need so automatic deposit When It's Time Boom the Lord put it when it's time Boom the Lord put it because God already knows remember this verse okay the Bible says be not like them because your father not your God your father amen not your God he is your God but your father amen remember our father your father knows amen amen your father knows what things you have need of amen amen before you ask him so there is a need and you are asking for that need but the Bible say God already know am amen verse 9 after this manner therefore pray you why do we you do you teach us again how to pray you already know what we need Paradox amen amen Our Father which is in heaven you understand this now Hallowed be your name you understand this now your kingdom come you know what it means your will be done in earth as it is in heaven you know that amen give us this day our daily bread that's where we are we clear jum to verse 25 please if you dare you can say amen amen therefore I say to you take no thoughts in other word do not worry or do not be anxious amen take no thought about your life amen don't worry about your life don't be anxious about your life come what you shall what eat or what you shall what drink so God doesn't want you to worry about your life in general and then food remember this you see the bread and there was no what water food what you shall eat and what you shall what drink amen don't worry about this why amen nor what you shall drink nor yet your body what you shall put on in other words your garment remember in the wilderness what did he do to the Garment preserve the Garment what did he do when they needed bread Mana water from The Rock when they were sick he took care of them don't worry about those stuff remember the Wilderness am remember the Wilderness remember the Wilderness in other word god display all of this in the wilderness he took care of the eating the drinking the Garment and the entire life when they got sick God healed them don't worry about it we clear amen amen the Bible says nor shall you drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat or food and the body than what rment God is comparing your life with the meat amen who gave you life to begin with God if God gave you life why do you worry about meat are we together if God gave you already life why do you worry about meat meat you can go to DSS they can give you a food stamp that's right that's right nobody can give you life amen no doctor can give you life amen but meat you can come to my house I can give you meat but I cannot give you life but God already gave you life we clear amen what do you worry about meat God gave you a body who can give you a body God nobody who else can give you a body nobody else what do you worry about a garment that man is making what man cannot do God already gave it to you what man can do you worry about in other words you have more faith here than over here if they tell you they're going to give you a repent tomorrow or skirt tomorrow you're going to believe it if they tell you that come tomorrow you're going to have a body change then you begin to search court in the morning all the time to make sure where is this coming from amen amen it's human being amen amen verse 26 the Bible say behold the fou of the for they do what s not neither do they what reap nor what gather into B have a bank account yet your heavenly father do what Feth them are you not much better than they because they don't have a soul they are not even created in the image of God but you are created in the image and the likeness of God why you wored foul don't have blood pressure that's right Bird don't have blood pressure because they don't worry they learn to just depend on God amen amen verse uh 27 which of You by taking thoughts or worry can add one cubit to his statue since you worry how many inches did you gain how many trouble did you bring to yourself how many weight did you lose since you start worrying so it doesn't do you no good amen amen you don't understand what I go through brother Steven and why take you thought for Remnant consider the lies of the field how they grow they to not neither do they spin and yet I say to you that even Solomon artificial in all his glory men M Glory was not a ray like one of these in other word their clothing is original we clear wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more cloth you oh you of what little faith we went through this amen therefore what is the lesson take take no thoughts go ahead my brother saying what shall we eat clear or what shall we drink or or wherewith shall we be clothed for after all these things do the who gentille seek so when you start worrying about this thing you begin to act like a heathen like somebody who doesn't have faith you know different than a heathen amen amen for your heavenly father father knows that you have need of what all these things so God again knows that we need all of these thing how can God say give us this day our daily bread when he already knows he say do not worry about it I know you have need of then the same God comes and say when you talk to me ask me give me bread why do we need to ask if he knows if we don't have to worry about it let's go to Luke chapter 11 if not we will repeat these uh these things like Catholic amen Our Father which is in heaven Our Father which is in heaven brother Bram did it with a guny trying to kill himself Our Father which is in heaven hallow be thy name and the gun won't go I have a quote he was trying to kill himself amen Luke 11 verse1 if you dare you can say amen amen and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he seized one of his disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciple we clear and he said to them when you pray say Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name Your Kingdom Come your will be done as in Earth so in heaven give us day by day this is more clear in that word every day not just one day every single day day by day you have to ask every day amen but why should we ask when you already know what we need and we have to ask not once day by day you already know what we're looking for so why should we ask every day amen what a task P stepen you know you need to give me food so today brother Steven can I get my food tomorrow brother Steven can I get my aren't you tired what is God really talking about why do we have to ask God every day amen day by day amen why every day isn't God tired are we not bothering God too much all the time give him a break every day I need food I need food I need give him a break every day every day every single day [Laughter] Hallelujah let's go to verse 9 and I say to you what ask amen come and what it shall be given you so there is a principle you must ask [Applause] amen if you don't ask nothing Hallelujah amen you okay ask and what it shall be given you then you get it amen amen and do what seek and you shall what find why did Kelly gave you the secret on Wednesday seek and you shall do what fine and what knock and what happened it shall be opened unto you amen you got it on Wednesday right ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you verse 10 for what everyone that ask receiveth stop how many people ask and receive do we have any exception no brother Elijah you can ask amen you don't need to be 18 years old you can ask a even a another person can ask amen it's a principle everyone that ask what happened receiveth and he that seeketh what happen find it and to him that knock it shall be what opened so even though God knows what you need amen you have a responsibility on your part amen though he knows you know we have to ask why let's pray Heavenly Father father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning Lord thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for this great opportunity again that we have to fellowship with the sent

First Peter 5:7 go ahead my friend asking all your care upon him why for he carth for you if he cares for me why should I cast my care to him why should I tell him all the time I have a headache if he car for me why my subject this morning is Teachers to pray give us the secret of asking amen let me go again my subject this morning is teach us to pray give us God say ask him give us amen what is

verse 8 and the Lord planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground we clear made the Lord grow made the Lord God to grow every tree that is how pleasant to the sight and what good for food because men need food we clear so God as a provider begin to provide for the food of his child quickly because the baby is born he's born on the Earth Adam

amen are we together amen are we together amen so the elephant begin to come and Adam look he said this is elephant an elephant god say elephant goes there can he say zebra God says this and Adam begin to get used because all his answer are always yes until Adam begin to even change position he said next one eego next one eag when he [Applause] finished do you follow me when he finished next verse you there amen and you there amen verse 20 and Adam gave name to what all cattle and what to the foul of the air and to what every Beast of but for who Adam was not found a what help me for him God was giving Adam a [Music] message God knew Adam need a wife but God didn't want just supplier so he put Adam in the test to see if Adam would decode that everything is pair except [Applause] me but Adam was taken to the game of naming everybody okay in other word God wanted Adam to decode a message God want want Adam to be conscious that he was missing something before he supplier amen [Applause] amen so he put Adam in the test normally Adam should say wait a minute everything is double double everything is male female male female male female wait a minute why am I this way but Adam was caught up in the game of just elephant Eagle Dove parrot monkey next one next one and when he finish God look he say this boy don't understand I'm trying to make him relax I'm trying to make him talk [Music] amen I already have Eve Eve is in the theophany I'm trying to deliver if but I want him to [Applause] talk The Secret of what God want Adam to ask amen but he but the test is over Adam is not asking when Adam finish he said father that's finished he said yes it's finished say thank you let me go watch the word follow over there God look he say I'm going to give him the anesthetic this boy don't understand do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me God took the anesthetic and give it and Adam went to sleep and God created Eve and put there when Adam woke up when he saw Eve he start the name your name is a [Applause] woman am I reading a different Bible no let's read it together let's read it together let's read let's go to verse 22 go my friend go my friend and the rib which the Lord God had taken from manh made he a woman and did what and brought her unto the land Adam said what this is now bone he never even say this is what I was missing because God is supplying everything he never said this is what I was missing no as soon hey and another spee this is a woman you came from me yes you know the mystery but do you get the point are we together he said this is now what bone of my bone and what Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called what woman so he's very good and naming she shall be call a what woman because she was what taken out of man that's say so it looks like it was God who was worrying for Adam but Adam never seen the the the part he was missing he never seen what he was missing that's the reason why in chapter 3 when God said Adam Adam where are you do you know the answer of Adam let's read let's read my friend you there are we together are we together let's go to verse uh where is that at uh verse uh chapter 3 verse 9 amen amen amen amen and the Lord God called for Adam to Adam and said to him where are you and he said I heard what thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because what I was naked and I did what hid myself and he said what who told thee that thou was naked have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you not uh that you should not eat watch Adam and the man said the what woman whom thou gave to be with stop the woman whom that what gave it so you the one that gave it to me for I didn't ask for it you the one that gave it to me the woman you remember the woman that you gave me can I continue can I continue amen can I continue Amen in other word everything for Adam is taken for granted [Applause] listen to brother Bram here brother Bram say he was born in this great we wheat belt which when whe comes for it is what the basic principles of life and he was the bread of what life I am the bread of life he that eats my flesh and drink my blood has what eternal life and shall never die or come into what condemnation but has passed from Death unto what life bread is the basic principles of life amen God Supply it watch again brother Bram says this oh don't you see the connection between the man he promised our what bread and water is sure we clear amen our bread our food and our what water is what sure and God will do it just as certain as we are setting the and every Divine promise he has made his is obligated to what do it so God supplied the food and the water and once he did it Adam got come he became comfortable because there is no worry amen listen to this in 1 Corinthians chapter 10:3 when Israel was going out of Egypt Paul says and did all and and did all and did all eat the same what spiritual meat and did all drink the same water spiritual drink so God provided the meat and the drink and they drunk of the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was who Christ so God gave the food and the drink together amen because it's the basic principle of life we clear listen to this that is why he was born in Bethlehem of Judea he credle him and my brother the place he want to be created today is in your own being your own water heart that he might display from you the water Waters of life to a perishing people and the water bread of life to a starving people he is the water bread and water of life which is the two what essential things to a man's living the two essential thing to a man living is what bread and water and it's promised how for sure so God provided the water and the bread for Adam for sure and Adam got complacent and he didn't realize that he needed something else and when God brought him what he needed for what he lacked because Adam was incomplete without Eve when they created him in Genesis 1 he was man and female when they put him in Genesis 2 he lacked something but he didn't realize that he was missing something and God brought him the missing part and when trouble come he say hey you know the missing part that you brought me you know the woman that you gave it to me she's the one that caused this thing in other word it was God Waring but not Adam are we together are we together are we together there is a principle that I'm going to say here Paul says John says this John answered and said a man can receive what nothing come out except except what except he be given him from what heaven so anything that you have must come from where Heaven everything that you have comes from Heaven 1 Corinthians chap 4:7 the Bible says this for who made the to to die from another and was and what has that that that did not receive in other word everything that we have we receive it now if that did receive why do you glory as if you had not received in other word everything that we have God Supply it if you understand that it's coming from God you should not be proud because what do you have that you did not receive the call you have God Gave You amen they have you have God Gave You amen the shoes you have God Gave You am this church came from God Amen this pit come from God Amen so he bring us to humility to realize that we depend from everything from God in other word if you see somebody that is proud they don't understand proud because they think they did it but if you realize that I didn't do it it is God that did it he bring humility in your life [Applause] amen everybody together everybody together listen to this my friend we are on the chapter three watch chapter 3 here and watch uh job to verse uh uh s we were on verse seven job to verse 12 where we were and the man said the woman whom you gave to be

God was worrying too much Adam was already okay everybody okay I want you to see the attitude of Adam amen and she gave me the tree and I did it and the Lord said to the woman you know the story what is this that you have done let's jum here and jum down to verse 16 the curses started you there are you there amen verse 16 the Bible says this Hallelujah and to the woman he said I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception in your sorrow shall you bring forth children and your desire shall be to the to your husband and he shall rule over you did you see Eve saying something no Eve was quiet then God turned to Adam follow me and Adam and to Adam he says because you have listened to the voice of who thy wife God is calling Eve his wife but Adam said the woman that you gave me he forgot at the beginning he was my wife when trouble come he say the woman that you gave me and God turned around he said your wife because I marry you I'm the one who marry you can I continue at the beginning she was born of my B Flesh of My Flesh this is really me but now the woman that you gave me because trouble happened can I continue amen I keep the married uh uh CLE meeting and another time amen listen to what he say he said you because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree which I command you saying that you shall not eat it it of it curse is the

besought him that he would not command them to go where out into the deep do you know that de deep means what water right uh-uh that deep means abys it's a name for abys it's a name for hell amen so

they are in their position don't fight them over there it is their god-given position now the devil are telling God please don't don't send us to hell don't send us to the house that you God created

we'll begin to SAR maybe one more let's go to John chapter 4 what is the secret of asking hallelujah amen because God for the first time in prayer he said give us this day in other word ask me but he says before you ask I already know amen so why do we need to ask if you already know right what is the key in asking let's go to John chapter 4 a very familiar scripture that you know if you dare you can say Amen you know Jesus came the woman everywhere follow me carefully let's see what asking does to your life everybody okay everybody okay therefore verse six now Jacob well was there Jesus therefore being how weary he was tired from what with his journey Journey say d on Sat D on the well and it was about which there the sixth hour there come a woman of Samaria to do what draw water Jesus said to her what give me to drink Who start asking God Jesus if God needed drink don't you think he would have gotten his own drink how did he fasted 40 days in the wilderness amen we clear Jesus is asking give me a drink follow me carefully please you there verse 8 for his disciple were gone away to the city to buy what meat then says the woman of Samaria to him how is it that you being what a Jew do what ask drink of me a what which am a woman of Samaria prud this isue for the Jew have what no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said to her you clear you clear you ready amen if you knew the problem that you play with me because you don't know who you are Who I Am the devil knows who I am K knows his father but he knows that I'm above his father and he can put his petition and get what he want the devil knows what happened in heaven they knew what how I whoop them in heaven they knew my power they know exactly who I am when they see me coming they know they don't wait for me to question them they first start exactly right now I came and Avail myself in human flesh and I use a Jewish garment and I'm asking me you are I'm asking you are now you begin to quarrel with me that's right amen and the reason why you do that because you don't know who is telling you to ask it can I continue amen if you knew the what gift of God the gift of God and who it is that say to you what give me to drink you would have what asked of him and he would have given you water living water in other word you are the one that is supposed to ask help because you in bad shape let me rephrase it clearly you are living in an unclean living you need help but when I'm presenting to you you try to show me that you're more righteous you even preach to me you telling me about the well and Jacob your father and everything are you greater than Jacob our father if this world was everything for you why are you in the condition that you are you are the one that was supposed to ask me first and if you ask me I'm not going to give you this one in other word God is telling the woman when you see me you should have asked me the secret of asking why don't you just give her why she need to ask you and he said if you ask me I'm going to give you another word if you get the word it's finished but for me to give you the word you must ask I know you need it I cannot give it to you because there is a principle you must ask the potential is there I have that word I am the fullness of the godhead badly I am the living bread himself I am the Water of Life myself but I don't give the water just like that I only give water to those who ask they asking based of understanding who I am are we together amen watch the story my friend he says if you would have asked of him and he would have given you the water Living Water the woman said to him sir you have nothing to draw if you notice she's not even interested she should have stopped there and say okay give me the order she doesn't do that she still have more to argue she still have more to reason she still have more to figure it out wait a minute you giving me water you don't have anything to begin with how are you going to get water but the word that God G told him he said the word of Living Water how can the water leave what can the water is living He says the woman says sir you have nothing to draw with and the well is what deep from where then have you that living water in other word the woman is more questioning wait a minute you don't have nothing to to Jo here I don't see any big container like those that carry uh gasoline you don't have one you're not a truck driver here with a gasoline truck where are you going to get that one Amen in other word we trying to figure it out for God you asking God but you step you say the situation is so difficult how is God going to do this really because technically speaking according to the bank I fail come on now somebody with this credit Will Never qualify for home but they say pray I'm going to pray but how is God going to change them how is God going to change this is is God going to change the score or how is God going to do that everybody okay everybody okay amen he said are you greater than our father look the problem Jacob which gave us the well and drank their well himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said to her whosoever drink of this water that you bragging shall thirst again but whosoever drink the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the word that shall give him shall be in him a well of what water a word of water springing up into water everlasting life in other words let me clarify to you really what I'm talking about I see you still carnal amen amen amen watch verse 15 the woman says to him what sir what give me this water that I thir not when the woman was arguing with Jesus Christ did you see Jesus Discerning her no did you see Jesus opening her and telling her the problem of her life no because she have not asked yet wow everybody okay Jesus is standing there waiting for her to ask as soon as the woman say okay now give him give me this word then the gift of God [Applause] kicking I don't know if you get what I'm saying they gift of God was available he was waiting for somebody to open the pipe but the opening of the pipe is asking if you don't ask the

potential but he will only unlock those potential to those that are interested amen if you are complacent like Adam God will leave you [Music] alone one day Jesus saw two disciple going to and Jesus stop in between them and begin to explain to them the Bible when the evening come the Bible say he did purposely like he's going to leave them because Jesus want them to pull him sir and they begin to say no no no no no don't go come up and say that's what I was looking now I'm going to show you that I'm not just nobody amen I was the Savior that was Rising amen when you invite him when you ask for him then he open up amen and the eyes were open and they said that was Jesus amen only when they ask for [Applause] him verse 16 my friend he said go call your husband and do what come hither the woman say he says and say I have no husband Jesus said to her what th because now the gift is operating when she asked for it God open now that okay now you ask it shall be given to you you want the Living Water do you want it fine we need to clean up your life this is what is going on in your life your life have this this this this this and the woman life got clean up completely when Jesus clean up the life completely he says I am even Christ why because the woman ask your asking makes God feel important amen your asking makes God feel that he's needed amen it makes God feel like he's God when you begin to ask God stuff God wake up and say that is what I was looking [Applause] for let me help somebody again Jesus was in the boat and he went to sleep sleep and and and the storm was all over did you see Jesus waking up no matter how the boat was moving Jesus was s asleep do you think that Jesus was sleeping but Jesus was not sleeping can I say something Jesus was sleeping but Jesus was not sleeping amen because there was two Jesus there was the man Jesus and the garden Jesus amen God doesn't sleep no Slumber he knew what was going on and then he said this boy they don't need me let them get tired let them solve their situation themselves until they recognize they need me when they got tired one of them remember he said wait a minute the master is over there he said Master wake up and said that's what I was waiting for move out of the picture now let me have my show what what is the problem what is going on here PE see peace be still quiet look say what kind of man of this why were you wasting this time with the master over there if you have known that he was in the boat and you just go ask you will not waste so much stuff that you wasted you wasted so much energy trying to figure it out your marriage trying to figure it out your life try to solve this and this and this and God is just sitting and watching you because you don't understand you think you're going to worry him he wants you to ask when you ask them God say that's what I was looking for that's what I want that's what I was expecting when you ask me it is my daughter they asking it is not a demon it is not Cain it is not Satan this is my own blood this is my own Bor if I can do for devil this one I can do even exceedingly amen and abundantly above all that you can ask for above all that you can ask that's why ask and it shall be what given unto you there is a power in asking [Applause] amen God want to be B amen God want to be B he said remember they just judge keep knocking you not troubling me when I look I say that's say that's what I want to show the devil you see you see how they pers now I'm going to give them beyond what they asking because they understand who I am when you go to God asking you are telling him that you are the solution to my problem amen no one else can do that but you when God hears that he say I got M he said now I can do what I want make him feel God make him feel what he is because he car for you amen he's there for you but my children are perishing because they don't know the secret of asking asking Bove my [Applause] bowels many of you are fathers here if your son come and ask you for for a toy and you don't have the money do you know how painful that is do you know how painful that is it will drive you to work he will drive you to work ask those that are parent he will drive you to you will work over time just to qualify that that's why when when the fall happen God say let me teach Adam the desire of your wife now you going to be it's going to go to you they desire of Eve now he goes to you when Adam goes I need a skirt I'm going to get a second job he said that's what I was looking for that's what I was looking for because he put him to work he remind him his responsibility you remanding him that hey I'm for you I depend on you you need to take care of me you took me from my mother [Applause] house my daddy was taking good care of me you came and took me and you say I'm your sweetheart I'm going to baby you I will be with you I'm going to give you a bath now I'm here I cannot stay like this you need to take care of me remember your promises remind God his promises he will never leave you nor forsake you he will be with you all the way to the end ask and it shall be [Applause] given father help me I am a 40% my friend let me try to see if I can move Amen brother stepen I ask but nothing happened I ask nothing happened what happened James say this if any of you lack what wisdom what does he have to do ask of God is that complicated no ask of God that do what and that giveth to all men liberally if he give to all men liberally why do we have to ask him ask him ask him that give to all men what liberally and do what upth now we already explained you this and it shall be what given him forget about the word in the green let's go to the word in pink let him ask of God and he shall be what given him do you see that in other words if you lack something do never hesitate go straight to God ask for him God already knows that you lack wisdom but he wants you to ask verse six go ahead my friend but let him ask in faith nothing wavering how do you ask in faith the problem is ask how in faith ask in faith not what wavering not wavering for he that what waver is like a what a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss for let that man think that he shall receive what anything of the Lord in other word the problem is when you approaching him you don't trust him that's why it doesn't work you trying to figure it out how he's going to do God don't want you to figure it out remember Satan remember the devil remember C they didn't stop and think twice they knew who God was you go straight with faith because he's the rewarder of those that diligently seek after him amen listen from uh verse James 4 from where cometh War and what fighting among you cometh not H even to your own what lust that was in what your members ye lust and ye have not you kill you desire to have and you what can cannot you cannot obtain you fight and War you have what not why because he ask not so the majority of your trouble you the one that cause it because you never ask for help everybody okay he says ye ask and do what receive not why because he ask a miss that you may what consume it upon your lust so when you asking make sure you cross two things make sure you asking with faith and make sure you don't ask for your last in other words you got to check your motive and your objective amen if your motive and your objective is right God is under obligation to give you what you want am I'm going to skip some of them listen to this my friend in the book of first king verse three uh chapter 3:4 the Bible said the king went to gibon Solomon to sacrifice there for there was the water great high place the great high place a thousand burn offering did who Solomon offer unto who the altar in gibon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a what dream a dream by night and God say what ask what I shall give thee God never came and gave it to Solomon when he came in the dream he just positioned he say ask why I'm right here I'm available you tell me what you want and what you say will unlock me that's why when the third pull happened come on for hat right the first time for the human being when the anointing struck God never gave hat right what you want God told the prophet tell right to ask God knew what at right will ask but God won't give it until at right [Music] ask brother Bram say God knew what right will ask but even though God knew when God came on the scene God kept quiet he said tell her to speak in other word I'm available what she need for is right here I already have the two portion of the holy spirit for her two children I'm just waiting for atat to open her mouth and say what she want as soon as atat say the salvation of my children God took the Holy Spirit and baptized the two children because you need to ask asking unlock God Amen Lord help me glory to God the Bible say in first king Chapter 19 Verse 15 and the Lord say unto him to Elijah go return On th way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when that come anoint Hazel to be king of syyria and jiu the son of nimi shall that anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of shaffat of Abel Mah shall thou anoint to be prophet in the Rome so God gave Elijah the commission he say I want you to anoint three people you anoint hezel you anoint jiu and you anoint who El Elisha so Elisha has already a promise to be anointed by God that is on first king we clear now when he comes the time to anoint Elijah Elijah keep following stay here as the Lord liveth I'm not going to leave you good as the Lord liveth I'm not going to give you good as the Lord live I'm not going to give you good Elijah got tired he turned around it came to pass verse n that when they were gone over Jordan that Elijah said to Elish shall do what ask Hallelujah all your following is good elah turn he said boy I don't know if you will I'm about to go you don't talk ask before I go give me a few minutes my friend ask what I shall do for what and before I be what taken away from and El say I pray the let what a double portion of thy spirit Spirit be upon me and he said th have asked a what a hard thing whatever Elisha say must be given because they give him the right to ask amen Elijah Elijah never say ask only ABC he say ask what you want ah what I want not a one portion double portion amen I want your spirit double huh you asking something hard but because I told you to ask he amen you going to get it just focus on me and watch me until you get it so the are the anointing of Elijah of Elisha will not come upon Elisha until Elisha ask even though God already promis but God was waiting for Elisha to ask God was waiting for Solomon to ask God was waiting for right to ask father help me amen again again I say unto you that if what two of you shall do what agree on Earth as touching what anything and they shall do what ask it shall be what done for them it shall be done for them of the Father which is where in heaven for where two or three are what gathered together in my name there I am where in the midst of God wants you to ask amen when you come to church never leave the church without asking amen because God is in the midst of us it's an opportunity to ask oh my God Lord help me he says in Psalm 2 David he said I will declare the decree the Lord has say unto me thou are my what son this day have I what begotten so God is talking to his son ask of me or instead of God taking care of him like Adam say no more like Adam I'm not going to play that game anymore now I have begotten you you ask of me and I shall give the what the heathen for what inheritance and the other most part of the what for the what in other word ask what you want Jesus even stood he said father I know that you always answer me but I'm doing this just because of them amen father help me up let me see if I can look here brother Bram say do you know that there are something that we have to do that God cannot do until we do it we Okay we okay now I'm pushing Malachi for because you cannot go say the Bible say now the Bible say brother say everybody okay can I continue can you give me a few minutes let's read it again my friend do you know that there are something that we have to what do that God cannot do until we do it did you know that amen hallelujah in other way God won't do it until you do it am if you don't do God is just watching you no more like Adam God is just quiet until you do it he said we are what the branches he's what the vine but the vine can bear fruit it is the branches that do what bear fruit is that right now he furnishes the what the energy but we got to do what do the job you get what I mean the holy spirit is here tonight as you see him each night he knows you but the only way he speak is what through us is the right we our hand are what his hands our eyes are what his eyes and now we notice that he give us what things there Jesus was standing one day looking upon what the Harvest do you believe he was the lord of the Harvest and he look upon the Harvest and say you do what pray the Lord of the Harvest that he will send what laborers into his Harvest because the Harvest is what right and what laborers are few in other word you ask me to do what I know that is got to be done amen God knows what to do he said before I do it you tell me what to do I already know what to do but I won't do it until you say God I want you to do this then I do it the power The Secret of asking he said they could not do it until they do what asked him to do it amen glory to God isn't strange that God wants the people to have part into it when Jesus look upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is how right and the LI house you pray the Lord of the what Harvest that was who him you pray to me that I shall send labor in my Harvest is some part you have to do amen God is waiting for what his church to do what call on him he's always what did it God is waiting today for the
