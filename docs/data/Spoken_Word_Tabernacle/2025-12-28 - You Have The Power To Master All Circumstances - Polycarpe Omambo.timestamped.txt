[0:20] Amen.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; The fig tree provided the clothing when
[0:24] it was not time for the clothing.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; And God asked the fig tree to provide
[0:28] fruit when it was not time for the
[0:30] fruit.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Time or not, you need to provide it
[0:34] &gt;&gt; because he was the season. Amen.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:38] When you do everything and you can't
[0:40] catch anything, he's still that season.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; That season that can create the fishes.
[0:45] Amen.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. When man fell, nature fell. Amen.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; But the trees were still trees.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; There were still trees. There was still
[0:54] alive. But it was a chaos that enter
[0:57] into he. But what you want to
[0:59] understand, God rebuked the wind.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; He rebuked the water. And he also
[1:04] rebuked his disciples. And the reason
[1:07] why he rebuked them because he already
[1:08] gave them power before.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; To master all circumstances. So while he
[1:15] was resting, they should have taken
[1:17] things in charge.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; They should be in charge and say, you
[1:20] know what, he's sleeping. Let leave the
[1:22] Lord sleep. Let's handle this storm
[1:24] ourselves.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [applause] Amen. [cheering]
[1:29] And do you know the good thing about
[1:31] God?
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know the good thing about God? He
[1:34] knows us very well.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; He knows that when I'm around, they will
[1:38] come and poke me
[1:40] &gt;&gt; and they will come and wake me up.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham is around,
[1:44] everybody will travel to Jeffersonville.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that one.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; If Brother Brham remain alive. Every day
[1:54] we will have a prayer line in
[1:56] Jeffersonville. Everybody trying to even
[1:59] touch him. People will come all over the
[2:02] world trying to see brother Branam. God
[2:04] say I know what to do. He takes brother
[2:06] Brham out. He takes Jesus Christ out. So
[2:10] now you can be in charge. [cheering] Now
[2:12] you can look within yourself and look AT
[2:15] THE SOURCE THAT IS IN YOU [cheering] AND

[2:36] to drive yourself.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; And guess what? The more you drive
[2:40] yourself,

[2:47] begin to teach you. And it won't be

[3:12] while, you begin to relax. After a
[3:14] while, you begin to relax. AFTER A
[3:16] WHILE, YOU BEGIN TO DO THIS. Some will
[3:18] BEGIN TO DO THIS. THAT'S WHAT GOD IS
[3:20] EXPECTING FROM YOU. AT THE BEGINNING YOU
