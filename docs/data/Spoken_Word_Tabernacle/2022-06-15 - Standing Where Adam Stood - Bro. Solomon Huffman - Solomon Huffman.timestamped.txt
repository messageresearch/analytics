[37:36] on church on sunday
[37:38] i want to go through the scripture

[37:43] understand why do we worship on sunday
[37:45] all of them are connected line up like
[37:48] this it's like
[37:49] like a chain like a casket one
[37:51] revelation after the other i say my god
[37:54] this is so beautiful amen
[37:56] blessed be the name of the lord tonight
[37:59] we have brother solomon hoffman
[38:02] who's preaching for us he's one of the
[38:03] minister with brother josh bennett he'd

[38:13] wonderful minister a wonderful young man

[38:33] going to preach like home and we will
[38:35] pull like home amen so i hope you gave
[38:38] him a good meal
[38:40] because it's coming out amen so blessed
[38:43] be the name of the lord we will call
[38:44] brother solomon and take he need to take
[38:47] his liberty and preach and minister the
[38:50] word of god tonight amen let's sing only
[38:52] believe
[38:54] only
[38:57] believe
[39:08] all things are possible
[39:14] only
[39:17] believe
[39:18] [Music]
[39:21] all
[39:23] the beliefs
[39:25] [Music]
[39:30] believes
[39:44] we sing jesus here
[39:46] jesus
[39:49] [Music]
[40:12] jesus
[40:15] [Music]
[40:36] amen can you give him a hand clapping
[40:38] praise tonight
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] i mean what a paradox that is to realize
[40:46] that in this
[40:48] church building tonight that we can be
[40:50] in the very presence
[40:51] of the same jesus that walked on this
[40:53] earth thousands of years ago
[40:55] amen and to know that that's a reality
[40:57] tonight that he's walking in our midst
[40:59] and
[41:00] i wonder maybe before we would uh look
[41:02] at the word of god if we could just our
[41:04] heads and hearts and have a word of
[41:06] prayer and and just invite the lord to
[41:09] have preeminence in this service tonight
[41:11] and
[41:11] maybe if you have a need upon your heart
[41:13] if you'd like to lift your hand and ask
[41:15] god to remember you
[41:16] amen i think of what a prophet would
[41:18] teach us he said that prayer
[41:20] isn't so much as bringing god down to
[41:22] man but it lifts us up where he is so so
[41:25] let's just invite him to come lord we
[41:27] we stand here before your sweet presence
[41:30] tonight lord and
[41:31] lord we know now that we're in the
[41:33] presence of more than just one another
[41:35] but lord
[41:36] we know that we're in the presence of
[41:38] the
[41:38] the very god of this bible and lord
[41:40] tonight i pray
[41:42] lord may you just lift us up to where
[41:44] you are lord and may the things of this
[41:47] world just grow dim to us tonight lord
[41:49] as we look to your word
[41:51] lord no doubt any man could stand here
[41:53] and could read words off of a page but
[41:54] lord we know that you're so much more
[41:57] than just a letter on a page but father
[42:00] lord you're a living reality tonight
[42:01] lord and i pray lord may you just have
[42:04] the preeminence to move in this service
[42:06] lord to
[42:07] to speak words of power and deliverance
[42:09] lord words have changed lord and lord uh
[42:12] your words do so much more than words of
[42:15] a man lord they they go down to the very
[42:17] heart of a man and change what he is and
[42:19] i pray lord may your word just go forth
[42:22] in power and demonstration
[42:24] of the spirit of almighty god lord and
[42:27] lord i pray that you just anoint the
[42:28] little gift of god in our lives to get
[42:30] ourselves out of your way lord and may
[42:32] you anoint your children that they could
[42:34] hear and receive what they have need of
[42:36] lord and i pray that you just be a
[42:38] participator in this service lord we're
[42:40] we're not here just to let you be an
[42:42] onlooker lord or to let you be a
[42:44] spectator but lord we want you to
[42:46] participate tonight
[42:48] lord and we just give this service to
[42:50] you tonight lord i invite you to this
[42:52] pulpit lord we give the furtherness of
[42:54] it to you lord and we pray when we leave
[42:56] this building may we have a testimony
[42:59] that did not our hearts burn within us
[43:01] as you spoke to us along the way we'll
[43:03] leave giving you praise we pray these
[43:04] things humbly and sincerely in your name
[43:07] the name of jesus christ we pray
[43:09] and the church said tonight amen and
[43:12] amen may god bless you bless you if you
[43:15] have your bibles i invite you to turn
[43:17] with us straight to the scriptures in
[43:18] the book of genesis
[43:20] and the first chapter
[43:22] and i'd like to say uh we certainly
[43:23] appreciate brother stephen the
[43:25] invitation to come and we we count on
[43:27] the great honor to stand behind this
[43:28] pulpit and you know i thought about what
[43:31] it would be like to be a pastor
[43:32] sometimes and you know they said and
[43:34] they gave up their pulpit and they set
[43:36] in a pew so
[43:38] we certainly counted the honor to be
[43:39] here with you and we just bring
[43:40] greetings from brother josh bennett our
[43:42] pastor back home he said to breathe sure
[43:44] and greet the church so
[43:46] we send you greetings amen we're all
[43:47] part of one body
[43:49] amen and
[43:50] the foot is just as important as the
[43:52] hand
[43:53] amen where we're thankful that god has
[43:55] let us be in his great body tonight at
[43:58] the book of genesis the first chapter
[43:59] will read the 26th verse
[44:01] down to the 28th we'll also read in
[44:03] psalms 82 and we'll turn one more place
[44:06] after that and genesis 1 26 the bible
[44:09] says the yes and god said
[44:11] let us make man in our image
[44:13] and after our likeness and let them have
[44:16] dominion
[44:17] over the fish of the sea and over the
[44:19] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[44:21] over all the earth and over every
[44:23] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[44:25] earth
[44:26] and so god created man in his own image
[44:29] i want you to notice that scripture amen
[44:32] when god created mankind he did it in
[44:35] his own image and man he wasn't a wasn't
[44:38] a byproduct amen in other words we could
[44:40] say it this way he copied himself
[44:42] amen he made man in his own image and
[44:45] the image of god created he him male and
[44:48] female
[44:49] created he them and god bless them and
[44:51] god said unto them be fruitful and
[44:53] multiply replenish the earth and subdue
[44:55] it and i love this part in the scripture
[44:57] and have dominion
[44:58] over the fish of the sea
[45:00] over the fowl of the air and over every
[45:02] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[45:05] now now i want to pull something out of
[45:07] that notice how when god started
[45:09] creation he started it aiming with the
[45:12] dominion ship and and that that's what
[45:14] god put in mankind and that
[45:16] we'll get to that in just a bit and in
[45:18] psalms 82
[45:19] and the sixth verse the bible says this
[45:22] and then jesus actually quotes the
[45:24] scripture uh in the new testament uh
[45:26] talking about how the bible said your
[45:28] gods in psalm 82 and 6 the bible says
[45:30] and i have said ye are gods and all of
[45:34] you are children of the most high and
[45:37] also one more scripture we appreciate
[45:39] you standing the book of romans in the
[45:41] eighth chapter we'll read one verse in
[45:43] the 15th verse there a familiar
[45:45] scripture in the bible would read this
[45:47] for ye have not received a spirit of
[45:49] bondage again to fear
[45:52] amen don't you don't you love that we've
[45:54] not received the spirit of bondage so we
[45:56] we can say with all the surety god does
[45:58] not give us a spirit of bondage but ye
[46:01] have received the spirit of adoption
[46:05] whereby we cry abba father now we just
[46:08] want to ask god to bless his word as you
[46:09] can be seated tonight and
[46:11] for a couple of minutes i want to be
[46:13] mindful of the time knowing this and
[46:14] wednesday night but i'd like to speak to
[46:16] you by the help and grace of god on the
[46:18] subject of standing where adam stood a
[46:21] man standing
[46:22] where adam stood and and i believe we
[46:25] have the ability to do that tonight amen
[46:27] by by the shed blood of almighty god and
[46:30] then and just to build a foundation in
[46:32] this we understand that the age that
[46:33] we're living in uh the prophet to our
[46:36] generation would call this an adoption
[46:38] age he would he call it a rapture age he
[46:40] called it a bride age an eagle age a
[46:42] harvest age and brother branham would
[46:44] use many terminologies to describe
[46:47] the age that we're living in he called
[46:49] it a capstone age and and to me when you
[46:52] study in the message of the hour you'll
[46:54] find amen the brother adam is saying
[46:56] that for a reason he's he's calling this
[46:59] age amen the bride age the adoption age
[47:01] the rapture rage he's calling those many
[47:04] different names to teach you something
[47:06] to let you know that the age that we're
[47:08] living in it is a manifestation age it
[47:12] says this is the capstone age this is
[47:14] the age of completion and and i'm
[47:16] thankful for a prophet that would give
[47:18] us a direct word i mean we didn't have
[47:20] to wonder if this is the manifesting age
[47:22] if this is the rapture age but but god's
[47:25] given us a message to let us know
[47:28] amen the time and the age that we're
[47:30] living in you pray you pray for my voice
[47:33] tonight like this past week and seem to
[47:35] lose it but we're just going to give the
[47:36] devil a black eye amen but you'd find
[47:39] how a prophet in our generation is
[47:41] declaring the age that we're living in
[47:43] how that this is a manifesting time i
[47:46] mean this is adoption time and i i love
[47:48] what he says here in the message the
[47:50] queen of the south he speaks on what
[47:52] amen what satan wants to do he says now
[47:54] i might say this just now because the
[47:56] holy spirit seems to be putting it on my
[47:58] heart he says now be careful because
[48:01] satan will try to tell you or something
[48:03] that's great off in another age to come
[48:06] he says there's something coming along
[48:08] in another revival so he's saying here
[48:10] it's the characteristics of satan to
[48:13] always put something off that that will
[48:15] that we're looking at something else
[48:17] we're looking for something else to come
[48:18] he says no that's what satan does he
[48:21] tries to put it off for another age now
[48:23] satan will try to tell you something
[48:26] some great move coming into another age
[48:28] he says or another coming along of
[48:30] another revival he says and it's always
[48:33] been that way but he says now now i
[48:35] believe that we're at the end i don't
[48:37] look for nothing else to come but the
[48:39] coming of the lord so so he's saying
[48:42] directly that we're in the end time amen
[48:45] but see satan always wants to put it off
[48:47] to a later age and say well we're going
[48:49] to come to something eventually
[48:50] eventually we're going to manifest being
[48:53] the son of god eventually we're going to
[48:55] be this but i just want to say tonight
[48:57] amen i'm not waiting to be able to stand
[48:59] where adam stood i'm not waiting tonight
[49:02] to be able to have even the same
[49:04] authority that adam had in the beginning
[49:06] i'm in church let me just say the wait
[49:08] is over you're living in the age where a
[49:11] son will manifest what he is and a donor
[49:14] will manifest what they are the devil's
[49:17] manifesting what he is but i say this i
[49:19] mean there's all the evil that's out
[49:21] there today it's manifesting what they
[49:24] are if you keep your eyes on it you're
[49:26] going to get discouraged as can be but
[49:28] but how about just one minute tonight
[49:30] let's look in the church of the living
[49:32] god and realize that there's some sons
[49:34] tonight there's some daughters tonight i
[49:37] know what the prophet said they're born
[49:39] signs they're field signs and they're
[49:41] speaking the word of almighty god
[49:44] amen manifesting exactly what we are
[49:48] hallelujah
[49:49] amen now you spare with me as we build a
[49:51] foundation in this but but i want to
[49:53] show you something very powerful in the
[49:55] message one that's brother brown would
[49:56] say this he says now it's god's purpose
[49:59] it's his purpose as a father supreme was
[50:02] to have a family now an earthly family
[50:04] he says an adam and eve and the only way
[50:07] that he could be a family with him or
[50:09] with that god could be a family with him
[50:11] he says was because god's nature was in
[50:14] them
[50:15] so the only reason that adam and eve
[50:17] were able to be family with god is
[50:20] because god's very own nature
[50:23] was inside of them i want you to keep
[50:25] that in mind
[50:26] so that made within with god's nature in
[50:29] them and then each other with god he
[50:32] says and they become all one isn't that
[50:34] a beautiful picture god in his family
[50:38] father over all supreme amen no death no
[50:42] sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy
[50:45] unspeakable amen never to be sick never
[50:48] have a heartache just one with god
[50:51] what a picture that's the very nature of
[50:53] god
[50:54] his very nature was in these people now
[50:57] now as god has created mankind i want
[51:00] you to notice god was determined to have
[51:02] a family is that right amen god was
[51:05] determined to have a i'm thankful
[51:07] tonight amen that he's let me be in his
[51:09] family amen as his very own son but but
[51:12] i want you to notice how that god was
[51:14] determined to do this and there was not
[51:17] any force there was not anything that
[51:20] could stop god's determination
[51:23] from having a family amen there's not
[51:25] anything that can stop god's
[51:27] determination i mean i just want to give
[51:29] you this amen god is more determined i
[51:32] mean than even you are tonight to have a
[51:34] family and i'll just say this amen god's
[51:37] determination will override anything you
[51:40] may go through
[51:41] because god is determined to have a
[51:43] family and he will have a family out of
[51:46] this age that we're living in
[51:49] amen i notice in this the book of
[51:50] genesis as god is creating mankind i
[51:53] want you to notice amen how god creates
[51:56] mankind in the beginning god god says in
[51:59] the bible let us make man in our image
[52:02] now now you ever study that out it's
[52:03] very beautiful because as god makes
[52:06] humanity god is making something in the
[52:09] fashion of him amen so you say what's
[52:12] that mean it's what it means i mean he
[52:14] made man in the fashion of him it's a
[52:17] being with supreme authority he's a
[52:19] being with dominion over everything
[52:22] i mean i'll just say this he was the
[52:24] most powerful the powerful being to walk
[52:27] the face of the earth was the first amen
[52:29] outside of adam he was the most powerful
[52:31] being that walked on this earth that we
[52:34] walk on today amen full power full
[52:36] dominion over everything that he's seen
[52:39] and known
[52:40] amen now i want you to notice in this
[52:42] the reason that god made mankind that
[52:45] way
[52:46] i mean it's because for god to have a
[52:49] true fellowship he i mean he must have a
[52:52] being that is that is like him
[52:54] i mean if god's gonna have true
[52:56] communion and true fellowship he can't
[52:59] have it was just a sinner he can't have
[53:02] it with just anybody but if god's going
[53:04] to have a true fellowship it's going to
[53:07] be with a being
[53:08] that is just like him amen now a prophet
[53:12] would teach us he covered it in the
[53:13] message meanness man i know he said well
[53:16] if you take a little girl and she wants
[53:18] to hang out with her grandma all the
[53:19] time he said well you would wonder
[53:21] something's wrong there maybe she's
[53:23] grandma's pet he said see the fellowship
[53:25] is not there because there's no
[53:27] similarity
[53:29] amen the fellowship's not there because
[53:32] there's no similarity in other words a
[53:34] ground to fellowship so you see a true
[53:38] fellowship that starts on common ground
[53:42] a true fellowship starts on common
[53:45] ground you say why are you saying that's
[53:47] what i'm saying i mean for god to have
[53:49] true fellowship and with a human they're
[53:53] going to have to be on the same ground
[53:56] that almighty god is on
[53:59] and when god created adam he was on the
[54:02] same ground as god he was all-powerful
[54:05] he was god over the earth and god can
[54:08] come down in the cool of the evening and
[54:11] battleship wisdom and adam understood
[54:14] god and god understood at him because he
[54:17] was like god i'm going to get ahead of
[54:19] myself and go ahead and say
[54:21] in this generation god is finally able
[54:24] again
[54:25] to come down in the cold of the evening
[54:28] just like he did with adam and eve and
[54:31] we're a bride with the eden fellowship
[54:34] just like it was in the beginning
[54:39] god used to couldn't do this but now he
[54:41] can
[54:42] i mean listen church and you should not
[54:45] be able to do this but after we've been
[54:47] restored to everything that was lost in
[54:51] the beginning the heart of god can now
[54:54] be satisfied
[54:56] once again like it was in the beginning
[55:02] hallelujah
[55:03] amen true fellowship starts on common
[55:06] ground now i want you to notice
[55:07] something in this i mean because there
[55:09] was a difference from adam being a
[55:12] created being
[55:13] and then when god breathed the breath of
[55:15] life into adam now there's a quote here
[55:18] in questions and answers very very
[55:20] amazing i see a lot of beautiful types
[55:22] in this
[55:23] but but says this now i can see adam he
[55:26] says let's take this away i see him
[55:28] standing like a tree
[55:30] now god made him notice this he was dead
[55:33] as he could be
[55:35] his toes were like roots in the ground
[55:37] and god said let there be or he breathed
[55:41] the breath of life into him and then
[55:44] adam jumped he came to himself see he
[55:47] breathed the breath of life into him and
[55:50] he became a living soul so i want you to
[55:53] notice this god created him and a
[55:55] prophet is saying he's dead as dead can
[55:58] be
[55:58] without the breath of almighty god in
[56:01] him so you see fellowship
[56:05] fellowship could not come
[56:07] while adam was dead
[56:09] but see when god breathed his life
[56:12] into adam he could be in fellowship with
[56:15] god or church you see the importance of
[56:19] the holy ghost you want to fellowship
[56:21] with god tonight then get the holy ghost
[56:25] amen you want to commune with the king
[56:26] tonight then get the holy ghost there's
[56:30] not a way around it
[56:33] hallelujah
[56:34] amen there was no fellowship
[56:37] until adam had god's breath in him
[56:40] i mean how could god have amen how could
[56:42] god have true fellowship with something
[56:44] dead
[56:45] god can't god can't have true fellowship
[56:48] with something that the only way that he
[56:50] can have true fellowship is with
[56:53] something that has his life on the
[56:56] inside of it hallelujah
[57:00] that's the same for the believer in the
[57:01] message what is the holy ghost the
[57:02] prophet would teach it he was saying now
[57:04] the first place is a christian that
[57:06] professed to be a christian but if that
[57:09] christian has not yet been filled with
[57:11] the holy ghost he's only in process of
[57:14] being a christian
[57:16] he ain't doing away with it but he says
[57:18] you're only in the process until you
[57:20] receive the holy ghost he says see he's
[57:23] professed to believe it he's working to
[57:25] it but god has not yet given him amen
[57:28] the holy ghost
[57:31] so you see you must receive the holy
[57:33] ghost if you're going to stand where
[57:35] adam stood i want to say this god made a
[57:38] way that we can stand where adam stood
[57:41] came him by the gift of the holy ghost
[57:43] amen god especially upon adam he
[57:45] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[57:48] then he became an eternal person with
[57:50] god and blasphemous names but amen say
[57:52] this now a church born of the breath of
[57:55] god he says now when that statue has
[57:58] molded itself up there in condition
[58:00] god's breath breathes upon them the
[58:03] prophet would say this receive the holy
[58:05] ghost he says a man you're a son of god
[58:08] now you can join anything you want to
[58:10] you've been born in the church he said
[58:12] but you must be born by the breath of
[58:14] god and god weeped upon them and said
[58:17] receive ye
[58:18] the holy ghost oh my there you are so a
[58:22] prophet's directly saying there ain't no
[58:23] way around it we must receive the breath
[58:27] of god and the thing i love about god he
[58:30] don't deal with the believer one way and
[58:32] do it's another a totally different way
[58:35] amen i just want to say this i'm in the
[58:37] very same breath
[58:39] that god breathed in adam is the same
[58:43] breath that is going through this
[58:45] building tonight
[58:46] it's the same breath of almighty god
[58:50] that can feel an earthen vessel just
[58:52] like it did adam in the beginning i want
[58:55] to say you may be as dead as adam was
[58:58] but all you need tonight is the breath
[59:01] of god aiming to bring life into you
[59:07] in order to have the breath of god
[59:10] i mean you desire it tonight
[59:12] i mean i believe it's for you
[59:14] i mean i i want you to notice something
[59:16] in this amen i want you to know it's the
[59:19] life that adam lived after receiving the
[59:22] breath of god now now continuing on
[59:24] their blasphemous things the prophet
[59:26] would say this now he had power like god
[59:28] he was an amateur god he was god of the
[59:31] earth not god of heaven now but he was
[59:34] god of the earth and someday the sons of
[59:37] god will become gods jesus said so this
[59:41] is not written in your law your gods
[59:46] amen someday the sons of god
[59:49] will become gods now he says here now
[59:51] we're going to get into something deep
[59:54] just watch this when we drive it down
[59:56] amen he's saying we're going to get into
[59:58] something deep i mean to show the
[1:00:00] believer's position as being a son of
[1:00:03] almighty god as being a daughter of
[1:00:06] almighty god now now it's amazing to
[1:00:08] realize that the same life that god was
[1:00:11] in the beginning he didn't get a
[1:00:13] different life when he put in an atom he
[1:00:16] didn't get a different breath he didn't
[1:00:17] get a different spirit but god put his
[1:00:20] own life
[1:00:21] into adam he didn't use something else
[1:00:24] he used his very own life when he was
[1:00:27] gonna go put it now now it's amazing to
[1:00:29] realize that amen because god puts
[1:00:32] everything out of money i mean god god
[1:00:34] puts his own faith in adam he puts his
[1:00:36] own power in adam amen everything god is
[1:00:40] he's putting inside his son
[1:00:43] by the gift of the holy ghost now now
[1:00:45] here's what's powerful i mean because
[1:00:48] the same god that used his very own
[1:00:51] faith to speak adam into existence he
[1:00:54] now takes that same faith and he puts it
[1:00:57] in adam adam i'm not giving you a
[1:01:00] different faith i'm giving you my faith
[1:01:03] and my power and every believer in here
[1:01:06] tonight
[1:01:07] god has given you the faith of almighty
[1:01:10] god it's not a different faith tonight
[1:01:13] but the same thing i spoke and said let
[1:01:16] there be is the same faith that is in
[1:01:18] the church of the living god
[1:01:22] hallelujah he didn't put a different
[1:01:24] life and adam and put a different spirit
[1:01:26] he put his very own spirit
[1:01:29] because he wanted fellowship he wanted
[1:01:31] communion and the only way to do that
[1:01:34] was to have somebody just like him
[1:01:37] hallelujah the only way to do that was
[1:01:39] to have somebody
[1:01:41] just like him
[1:01:43] i mean i noticed that state that adam is
[1:01:45] in as the bible says that you'll have
[1:01:47] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[1:01:50] the fowl of the air and over everything
[1:01:52] that moveth upon the earth so as god is
[1:01:55] positioning his firstborn son adam
[1:01:59] i i just love how god does things don't
[1:02:01] you
[1:02:02] amen god god puts him as the highest
[1:02:05] power upon the face of the earth i mean
[1:02:08] adam go out there brother kelly with
[1:02:11] supreme dominion there was not anything
[1:02:14] that was above adam there wasn't a beast
[1:02:17] of the field a fish of the sea mountain
[1:02:20] was above
[1:02:22] that son of god
[1:02:24] i mean nothing was above him
[1:02:27] nothing was about him tell your neighbor
[1:02:30] nothing was above him
[1:02:32] you say why does that make you happy
[1:02:34] because god almighty put that same
[1:02:37] breath in these lungs and nothing
[1:02:40] tonight is about the church of the
[1:02:44] living god there's not a spirit in hell
[1:02:47] that is above you tonight
[1:02:51] amen god has given you the same dominion
[1:02:54] as adam had in the beginning
[1:02:57] glory to god
[1:03:00] now that word dominion there means
[1:03:01] having dominion over
[1:03:03] exercising worship to be lord to be lord
[1:03:06] or rule have dominion over a supreme
[1:03:09] ruler and king
[1:03:12] i mean to have power i mean that's the
[1:03:14] way that god started it and how many
[1:03:17] knows that the prophet would teach us
[1:03:18] we're going back to the beginning
[1:03:21] we're going back to the beginning
[1:03:23] i mean just as god had it perfected in
[1:03:26] the beginning we are going back to where
[1:03:30] adam stood
[1:03:31] i remember you go with me tonight and
[1:03:34] let's go stand where adam stood
[1:03:37] as sons and daughters of god you say can
[1:03:40] we do it bro solomon amen can we stand
[1:03:43] where adam stood
[1:03:45] god has made a way for you tonight
[1:03:48] amen the youngest person in here god has
[1:03:50] made it possible for you to stand where
[1:03:54] adam stood
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:03:58] the most powerful being by the kelly the
[1:04:01] most powerful being to walk the earth
[1:04:03] and i want to say this
[1:04:05] i'm going to go out on a limb and i'm
[1:04:07] going to say it you are the most
[1:04:08] powerful beings that walk the face of
[1:04:11] this green planet
[1:04:15] you're the most powerful being now the
[1:04:17] devil hates this but i'm going to keep
[1:04:19] on going with the most powerful being to
[1:04:22] walk the face of this earth
[1:04:24] there ain't nothing above you there
[1:04:26] ain't nothing more powerful i just saw
[1:04:29] the teaching of the prophet what he
[1:04:31] would say he said who has more power an
[1:04:34] angel in heaven
[1:04:36] or a son of god on the earth
[1:04:40] the angels are jealous of your position
[1:04:43] the angels are jealous of your authority
[1:04:47] as a son of god
[1:04:51] you've got a position brother that out
[1:04:53] does the angels
[1:04:55] you've got a position that out does the
[1:04:57] angels in heaven
[1:04:59] oh god
[1:05:01] it's a god-given position
[1:05:03] and the beautiful thing about it is as
[1:05:05] we didn't put ourselves here
[1:05:08] i didn't position myself
[1:05:11] come on
[1:05:12] you didn't position yourself
[1:05:14] but god positioned you
[1:05:17] i say let's stand where god has
[1:05:20] positioned us as sons and daughters of
[1:05:23] god
[1:05:26] yes sir
[1:05:27] they might tell you i love looking at
[1:05:29] the life of adam
[1:05:31] i mean i want you to know it's the way
[1:05:33] he lived do you think adam didn't have
[1:05:35] freedom
[1:05:37] do you think adam didn't have liberty
[1:05:40] to go into the garden of eden
[1:05:42] in the core of the evening and come
[1:05:44] fellowship with god
[1:05:46] do you think adam didn't have liberty to
[1:05:48] worship liberty to praise
[1:05:51] do you think adam didn't have freedom
[1:05:55] you think adam could not exercise his
[1:05:58] right as a son of god
[1:06:00] i says whenever adam wanted to he could
[1:06:03] go and exercise his wife as a son of god
[1:06:07] and say mountain i don't like where
[1:06:09] you're at be moved
[1:06:13] heal i don't like where you're at be
[1:06:15] moved
[1:06:17] and he didn't doubt it was a shimbo he
[1:06:19] knew his position
[1:06:22] he didn't have to go take a note pill
[1:06:24] and then go speak the word that he knew
[1:06:27] his god-given position
[1:06:29] and when the need was there when the
[1:06:32] need was there he spoke to it it's time
[1:06:36] the sons of god
[1:06:38] speak into your mountain
[1:06:40] speak under your storm
[1:06:42] speak under your battle
[1:06:44] hallelujah
[1:06:46] speak the word
[1:06:48] god will perform it it's just covering
[1:06:51] it with you
[1:06:52] and it can never fail
[1:06:59] hallelujah
[1:07:01] i'll say this
[1:07:03] if you trust god on your position you're
[1:07:05] not going to fail
[1:07:08] you're not going to fail
[1:07:10] let's stand in our position tonight
[1:07:13] as sons and daughters of god listen
[1:07:15] let me give you a word you're not going
[1:07:17] to fail
[1:07:18] you're placed on a rock
[1:07:21] a solid rock and you're not going to
[1:07:24] fail
[1:07:25] i'll say this right first eve in the
[1:07:28] beginning she was able to fail and she
[1:07:31] failed but this church
[1:07:34] there ain't no fail in you and you're
[1:07:36] not able to fail because god has
[1:07:39] positioned you
[1:07:43] hallelujah
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:49] adam adam didn't stand there with no
[1:07:51] condemnation
[1:07:53] he never stood there with no guilt he
[1:07:56] never stood there as a slave to sin
[1:07:58] he never stood there as a slave to
[1:08:00] pornography
[1:08:01] come on
[1:08:02] he never stood there as a slave to
[1:08:04] anxiety he never stood there as a slave
[1:08:06] to nervousness a slave to fear he never
[1:08:10] stayed in that position
[1:08:13] because he knew he was and he knew he
[1:08:16] didn't have to put up with it
[1:08:19] you don't have to put up with it tonight
[1:08:22] hallelujah you'll have to put up with it
[1:08:25] tonight let's stand like adam stood
[1:08:29] and receive your god-given heritage
[1:08:34] i mean the beautiful thing about this
[1:08:36] is adam conducted himself like a son
[1:08:39] i i love the story of a prophet don't
[1:08:41] you
[1:08:43] he he tell us some stories for a reason
[1:08:45] you know
[1:08:46] but he told that story of that slave boy
[1:08:50] beautiful story
[1:08:52] he was a slave
[1:08:54] and a man came by to go by slaves and so
[1:08:56] he said how come this one acts a little
[1:08:58] bit different

[1:09:01] you you feed them different you treat
[1:09:03] them different no we don't

[1:10:22] hallelujah
[1:10:27] knew who he
[1:10:28] was the message adoption the prophet
[1:10:31] would say this way
[1:10:32] he said now this may choke you to death
[1:10:35] but did you know that men that are sons
[1:10:37] of god they are
[1:10:38] amateur gods

[1:13:17] dominion over you
[1:13:21] say it with me
[1:13:22] sin

[1:13:27] record another scripture the scriptures
[1:13:29] of god i mean the word i can't quantify
[1:13:32] my mind it's what it says amen that the
[1:13:34] scripture cannot be broken
[1:13:37] that correct
[1:13:39] scripture cannot be broken he said why
[1:13:42] are you tying those two together this is
[1:13:43] why because if god told me
[1:13:47] that god told me
[1:13:48] that there ain't no sin
[1:13:50] that will have dominion
[1:13:53] over my life
[1:13:55] and he also said that my scriptures
[1:13:58] cannot be broken
[1:14:01] for sin to have dominion over this boy
[1:14:04] out here
[1:14:05] god will have to break his own word
[1:14:09] but scriptures cannot be broken tonight

[1:17:58] you to do
[1:17:59] i'm going to line up all the animals
[1:18:01] animals before you i want you to name
[1:18:03] them
[1:18:05] so i did what god said

[1:18:10] elephant
[1:18:11] giraffe
[1:18:12] rabbit

[1:18:16] and god would say son that's exactly
[1:18:18] what i would have painted
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] that's exactly what i was thinking
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:26] you see the reason why
[1:18:28] and because the very life of that
[1:18:30] creator
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:33] i'm just going to go a little step in
[1:18:34] this
[1:18:35] why did god come to our prophets
[1:18:38] when them two young people was there in
[1:18:40] a meeting acting all indecent i can
[1:18:43] sinful in a meeting and god said son
[1:18:47] whatever you speak
[1:18:50] what you say
[1:18:51] is what will happen
[1:18:53] and so i said i forgive you
[1:18:57] why did he do it
[1:18:59] why could he forgive
[1:19:01] when there shouldn't have been none
[1:19:03] because the very life the very
[1:19:06] forgiveness that was in that creator
[1:19:09] stepped into a man
[1:19:13] and he exercised his authority as a son
[1:19:18] of god
[1:19:20] why could he stand on colorado hill
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:26] how could he stand on colorado hill
[1:19:28] here comes a
[1:19:30] here comes a sign and a storm coming by
[1:19:33] he stands there in the age that you and
[1:19:36] i are living in
[1:19:38] he's a flesh man like you and me
[1:19:43] is that okay
[1:19:45] flesh man like you and me
[1:19:47] i i just won't quote what he's saying he
[1:19:50] said this about preachers and about men
[1:19:52] he said a lot of people think that
[1:19:54] you're some kind of payment spectacular
[1:19:56] peculiar holy person he said men of god
[1:20:00] are just like anybody else
[1:20:03] they're not some odd really strange
[1:20:05] person they're just like you and i
[1:20:08] and a man just like you and i
[1:20:11] stood up on that hill and one of the
[1:20:13] greatest storms that's getting ready to
[1:20:16] blow by
[1:20:17] and he stands there as a son of god
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:21] exercising his rights
[1:20:23] as a son of god and he says storm
[1:20:27] amen go back that way for what was it
[1:20:29] three days
[1:20:30] and would you believe it
[1:20:32] this storm had to obey
[1:20:35] the voice of a son of god
[1:20:39] glory to god
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:42] and the storms of your life they have to
[1:20:46] obey
[1:20:47] the voice of a son
[1:20:50] and the voice of a daughter he said
[1:20:52] preacher will happen it's gotta happen
[1:20:58] because you are a son you are a daughter
[1:21:01] and in the age we live in
[1:21:04] god would use a man as a banner maker
[1:21:06] said okay
[1:21:08] he'd bring a man to a standard
[1:21:10] and when waving before the people
[1:21:13] this is what is possible
[1:21:16] this is what is possible
[1:21:18] if you stand in your position
[1:21:22] you can speak to the cancer
[1:21:28] can speak to the cancers
[1:21:30] you can speak to the tv
[1:21:32] you can speak to the blinded eyes
[1:21:35] the same power
[1:21:37] the same authority the same dominion is
[1:21:41] in the bride of jesus christ
[1:21:46] it's not a different life it's not a
[1:21:49] different spirit it's the same breath of
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:53] that breathed in the beginning
[1:21:58] same lines
[1:22:00] same authority
[1:22:01] same dominion
[1:22:04] hallelujah
[1:22:07] i want you to notice something in this
[1:22:10] in the book of isaiah 14
[1:22:12] the prophet isaiah gives us some insight
[1:22:14] on our adversary the devil
[1:22:17] hey speak something about him
[1:22:18] because satan has always desired
[1:22:22] to be exalted above the son of god
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] you're right
[1:22:29] satan has always desired to be above you
[1:22:33] now y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:22:35] you'll start your day tomorrow morning
[1:22:37] and he'll be right there getting ready
[1:22:38] to battle you
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:40] amen he desires your position
[1:22:44] and in isaiah 14 the prophet would say
[1:22:46] this now isaiah 14 and 13 for that has
[1:22:49] said in thy heart notice i even noticed
[1:22:52] the corruption in this being thou has
[1:22:54] said in thy heart i
[1:22:57] will ascend into the heaven i
[1:22:59] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[1:23:02] god
[1:23:03] a prophet would teach us a star god's a
[1:23:05] son of god
[1:23:08] i'll exalt myself above the sons of god
[1:23:11] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:23:13] congregation in the sights of the north
[1:23:16] here we go again and i
[1:23:18] will ascend above the heights of the
[1:23:20] clouds i will be like the most high
[1:23:25] listening devil yet thou shall be
[1:23:27] brought down to hell
[1:23:29] to the sides of the pit
[1:23:32] notice something in this satan says i
[1:23:35] will i'll be lifted up i'll be exalted
[1:23:38] i'll be this god never did that
[1:23:42] god never did that
[1:23:44] amen he never exalted him he never hey
[1:23:47] he never had a position that he wanted
[1:23:49] to have
[1:23:50] i want you to notice amen he wanted to
[1:23:53] put himself in that position
[1:23:56] and it never did happen
[1:23:58] amen he never got in the position to be
[1:24:02] above the star of god
[1:24:04] he never got in the position to be just
[1:24:07] like the most high
[1:24:08] he never did do it
[1:24:11] he said it himself i will do it
[1:24:13] but see when god when god positions you
[1:24:18] you don't do it
[1:24:24] you don't position yourself
[1:24:26] i'll say this church
[1:24:28] amen god has positioned you
[1:24:31] above every devil in hell
[1:24:34] he's positioned you
[1:24:36] higher
[1:24:37] higher than every demon out of the pits
[1:24:40] of hell
[1:24:42] i have not done this
[1:24:44] he has knowledge
[1:24:46] he has positioned you tonight
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:54] that's your power
[1:24:56] power is your what position
[1:25:00] how's the governor of our state in north
[1:25:02] carolina how does he have any power
[1:25:05] his position
[1:25:07] how does the president in the white
[1:25:09] house have any power
[1:25:11] his position
[1:25:14] how does a judge have any power in a
[1:25:16] courtroom
[1:25:17] his position
[1:25:18] but see the president can't just say

[1:25:21] president
[1:25:22] governor can't just say bless scotland
[1:25:24] be a governor but there's a power
[1:25:28] there's a higher power
[1:25:30] that places them
[1:25:33] in a position of power
[1:25:37] amen there's somebody above them that
[1:25:40] places them
[1:25:41] in that position of power
[1:25:44] and i just want to go on record and say
[1:25:45] this the king of kings and the lord of
[1:25:49] lords has positioned you
[1:25:51] in a seat of power a seat of authority a
[1:25:55] seed of dominion a seed of anointing
[1:25:58] he has positioned you
[1:26:02] and that's where your power is
[1:26:06] god has put you in position
[1:26:08] to receive everything
[1:26:11] that adam forfeited in the beginning

[1:31:27] if you don't practice it
[1:31:31] let's practice our position
[1:31:35] your position means nothing if you're
[1:31:37] not using it
[1:31:39] i said your position means nothing
[1:31:42] if you're not using it
[1:31:45] i believe we live underneath our
[1:31:47] privileges
[1:31:48] as sons of god
[1:31:50] there should not be any devil
[1:31:53] that torments you and you let it stay
[1:31:55] there
[1:31:57] sin shall not
[1:31:59] have dominion over you
[1:32:02] sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:32:07] sin shall not
[1:32:09] have dominion over you
[1:32:11] god said so
[1:32:13] that settles it and we believe it
[1:32:17] let's march in the victory
[1:32:20] let's march in revival
[1:32:22] let's take our stand
[1:32:26] run around the walls joshua
[1:32:29] you're a son of god
[1:32:31] the walls were compiling
[1:32:34] as being a son and daughter of god
[1:32:41] hallelujah
[1:32:42] hallelujah
[1:32:44] everything god was
[1:32:46] he poured it into christ
[1:32:48] everything christ was
[1:32:51] he has poured it into you
[1:32:53] in this age that we're living in
[1:32:56] and we receive it
[1:32:59] musicians come
[1:33:02] we receive it
[1:33:06] we receive it you see what a prophet
[1:33:08] would say
[1:33:09] he said the desire of god
[1:33:12] is to take empty vessels
[1:33:16] and shake the world with them
[1:33:20] the desire of god is to take empty
[1:33:22] vessels
[1:33:24] and fill them with
[1:33:25] somebody else's spirit
[1:33:27] somebody else's life
[1:33:29] he wants
[1:33:31] hey man you see god's desire and
[1:33:32] fellowship
[1:33:34] is that right
[1:33:36] god's desire i mean the whole the whole
[1:33:38] reason we're even here today
[1:33:40] because god wants a family
[1:33:45] he wants a family
[1:33:47] let's not lose sight of that he wants a
[1:33:49] family
[1:33:52] and we must stand where adam stood
[1:33:56] had the communion that he had
[1:33:58] i want to say this the only way this
[1:34:00] will be possible

[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:04] amen
[1:44:06] glory to god
[1:44:09] what a powerful message
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:13] and it looks like you cut it short
[1:44:15] brother solomon
[1:44:17] amen
[1:44:19] i was expecting more
[1:44:21] and look it's till nine o'clock
[1:44:23] and you cut it short
[1:44:25] praise god my god
[1:44:28] and he cut it in a specific point
[1:44:31] and i know it's not him
[1:44:34] where he stopped that's where you're
[1:44:35] going to get on sunday
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:42] did you see him touching the tattlet
[1:44:45] have you thought about it
[1:44:47] the holy spirit just hold it
[1:44:50] for a certain reason
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] what a powerful message
[1:44:55] you must be on common ground
[1:44:58] for you to have fellowship
[1:45:02] this applied to church he applied to
[1:45:04] your friendship it applies to everything
[1:45:07] you want to have a friend make sure
[1:45:09] you're in common ground
[1:45:12] hallelujah
[1:45:13] that's why brother branham said you
[1:45:15] should have a friend that believe like
[1:45:17] you
[1:45:19] don't tell me you know more than the
[1:45:20] prophet
[1:45:22] because you will always find that
[1:45:24] brother branham is always right
[1:45:28] you can bypass him after a while you
[1:45:30] found out that brother branham was right
[1:45:33] amen because when you believe your
[1:45:35] prophet you're going to prosper
[1:45:38] even if it doesn't make sense
[1:45:42] what are you going to do if you were
[1:45:43] following moses in front of the red sea
[1:45:48] he cut it he cut it short so we still
[1:45:51] have some minute
[1:45:53] what are you gonna do if you are
[1:45:55] following moses and you are right in
[1:45:57] front of the red sea
[1:45:59] and you look behind pharaoh and the army
[1:46:01] you look over here the mountain you look
[1:46:04] over there you have the wilderness you
[1:46:06] look right straight through the red sea
[1:46:08] what are you going to
[1:46:10] say looks like god put you in a trap
[1:46:14] what you really think it's a corner in
[1:46:16] your life
[1:46:18] it is not really a corner
[1:46:22] hallelujah where you feel like the devil
[1:46:24] corner you like you can't go this way
[1:46:26] you can go this way you can go this way
[1:46:28] there is always always
[1:46:31] a provided way riding
[1:46:37] and that provided way sometimes is
[1:46:39] beyond your thinking
[1:46:41] because nobody could have thought
[1:46:44] that there was an 85 in the red sea
[1:46:49] there was an 85 right there one was
[1:46:51] going south one north and he was just
[1:46:54] covered by water
[1:46:58] you see how god does things
[1:47:01] you see how god
[1:47:06] who would have thought a crow can feed a
[1:47:08] human
[1:47:12] who would have thought then
[1:47:14] amen
[1:47:15] believe on the prophet
[1:47:17] and you will prosper amen
[1:47:20] you must have that eternal breath
[1:47:22] which is you must get into the holiest
[1:47:24] amen because god needs the same faith
[1:47:27] the same person just like him you
[1:47:30] remember on sunday when he created man
[1:47:32] he took off his gloves
[1:47:34] because what i can do that man can do
[1:47:37] exactly the same thing
[1:47:38] that's why paul said the faith that i
[1:47:41] live with
[1:47:42] it is not my faith but i live by the
[1:47:45] faith of the son of god
[1:47:48] god just gave you his faith so that you
[1:47:51] and him
[1:47:52] can fellowship
[1:47:53] there is another mystery of the holy
[1:47:55] spirit where the it's a china tab
[1:47:59] where you take a paper and you tear it
[1:48:01] down in two
[1:48:02] and you get a portion and the other one
[1:48:04] got a portion
[1:48:07] oh my god blessed be the name of the
[1:48:10] lord god wants somebody that is like him
[1:48:13] that's why we are gods amen you need to
[1:48:16] practice your position
[1:48:18] you must take it and do it and the more
[1:48:21] you do it you are engaging god amen
[1:48:24] you know in philippians chapter 2 verse
[1:48:26] 5 the bible say let this mind
[1:48:33] being you
[1:48:34] which was also in
[1:48:36] in christ jesus so you need to find what
[1:48:39] was the mind in christ jesus
[1:48:43] if that mind need to be in you you need
[1:48:45] to find what was the mind in christ
[1:48:48] that is supposed to be coming into you
[1:48:51] i love paul paul say who this is the
[1:48:53] mind that was in christ
[1:48:55] who
[1:48:56] being in the
[1:48:59] form of what
[1:49:01] who is here who is not created in the
[1:49:03] image of god show me your hand
[1:49:07] show me anybody here that is not created
[1:49:10] in the image of god
[1:49:13] genesis 1 26 the brother just preached
[1:49:15] that we were created in the image and in
[1:49:18] the likeness of god so all of you look
[1:49:20] like god
[1:49:22] and all of you are in the form of god so
[1:49:25] if you are in the form of god just like
[1:49:28] jesus was in the form of god
[1:49:30] let's see what mind do we need to have
[1:49:32] then
[1:49:34] is the scripture complicated
[1:49:36] hallelujah let this mind be in you which
[1:49:40] was also in christ jesus
[1:49:42] who jesus being in the form of god comma
[1:49:47] thought it not robbery
[1:49:50] to be
[1:49:51] equal with
[1:49:55] do you know what it means
[1:49:58] do you know what it means
[1:50:00] do you know why they crucified jesus
[1:50:02] right
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:05] there was two reasons right
[1:50:07] i gave you the quote i already have the
[1:50:09] scripture to give it to you on sunday
[1:50:12] anybody care do you know why in other
[1:50:14] words when jesus was saying i am god
[1:50:18] in his mind he never even dared
[1:50:21] he never
[1:50:23] thinking not rubbing robbery to rob you
[1:50:26] meaning you're picking up you you're
[1:50:27] robbing somebody
[1:50:29] everybody here so when jesus is saying
[1:50:31] that i am god he is not robbing god
[1:50:35] if he is robbing god then jesus and god
[1:50:38] are two different person
[1:50:40] but me and my father we are
[1:50:42] so when i say i am god
[1:50:45] i am really god
[1:50:47] that jehovah of the old testament that's
[1:50:49] me
[1:50:52] anybody care so the bible say let that
[1:50:55] mind be also in you
[1:50:58] so where is god now
[1:51:03] you see you're still thinking twice you
[1:51:04] don't want to say this
[1:51:06] do you remember on sunday
[1:51:09] the disciples never say look on jesus
[1:51:13] you remember on sunday
[1:51:16] do you remember on sunday they say look
[1:51:18] on who
[1:51:20] why us
[1:51:23] because the mind that was in christ
[1:51:25] was now in the disciple and the
[1:51:28] disciples say look at us
[1:51:32] everybody here that's why when they were
[1:51:34] persecuting the disciple jesus never
[1:51:37] told so you are persecuting peter
[1:51:42] he never said so so why do you persecute
[1:51:45] brother robert
[1:51:47] said why do you persecute
[1:51:50] did paul meet jesus one day
[1:51:53] so where was paul touching jesus
[1:51:57] because jesus was in the
[1:52:01] can you believe that
[1:52:04] that's why the scriptures say ye are god
[1:52:07] you are the children of god the children
[1:52:10] of god means god
[1:52:15] the son of god means god
[1:52:18] i already gave you that scripture
[1:52:21] why do you think the devil was looking
[1:52:23] at jesus and say if you are
[1:52:26] the water
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:31] do what
[1:52:33] take this stone and turn it to what
[1:52:36] he knew a son of god can do that
[1:52:40] everybody here he knew a son of god can
[1:52:43] do that
[1:52:44] but he want to put a doubt in jesus
[1:52:48] so if jesus doubt he's going to try to
[1:52:50] prove the devil
[1:52:53] anybody here
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:56] if you do it you are doubting yourself
[1:52:58] because the devil said if
[1:53:01] if the devil would have said you the son
[1:53:03] of god change it then jesus can change
[1:53:06] it but he said if in other words i'm
[1:53:09] questioning you i want you to be trouble
[1:53:12] between you and who you are
[1:53:16] everybody okay when you got confusion
[1:53:18] between you and the real you that is god
[1:53:22] then the devil got you
[1:53:24] then you will begin to do things to
[1:53:26] prove people
[1:53:29] have you seen a homosexual
[1:53:31] they do stuff more than the one who is
[1:53:33] born naturally
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:36] because they are doubting themselves
[1:53:39] their bodies telling them they're not
[1:53:41] what they are
[1:53:43] but a true woman doesn't care whether
[1:53:45] she walk like a man or whether she walk
[1:53:47] like a woman she doesn't care because
[1:53:49] she knows she's a woman
[1:53:51] if you're a true god
[1:53:55] you don't care what somebody else is
[1:53:57] saying
[1:54:02] do you get what i'm saying you don't
[1:54:04] have to worry about what people are
[1:54:06] saying
[1:54:08] anybody here they told jesus christ if
[1:54:10] you the messiah come down at the cross
[1:54:12] so we will believe you did you see him
[1:54:14] doing that because they're trying to
[1:54:16] make him prove why should i prove you me
[1:54:18] dying at the cross that's exactly what
[1:54:20] the is saying matter of fact waiting few
[1:54:23] hours i will be saying what david said
[1:54:27] i'm repeating david and they're still
[1:54:28] blind
[1:54:30] the devil will always try to bring you
[1:54:32] question
[1:54:34] between what you are here and what you
[1:54:37] really are in there
[1:54:40] if you get the two people together
[1:54:44] then you can change your world
[1:54:46] if there is a discrepancy between the
[1:54:49] two that's when you up and down you up
[1:54:52] and down you up and down but when you
[1:54:55] get there when you understand that who
[1:54:57] told you jesus didn't suffer
[1:55:00] did the suffering of jesus christ remove
[1:55:02] his deity
[1:55:04] jesus hunger
[1:55:06] did he move his deity
[1:55:08] so why when you go through trouble you
[1:55:10] begin to doubt your deity
[1:55:12] you begin to question whether you're a
[1:55:14] son of god or not
[1:55:16] because of a lot of trouble you say ah
[1:55:18] because i'm going through this headache
[1:55:20] so maybe i don't have what i'm supposed
[1:55:22] to jesus have a different way to operate
[1:55:25] he says i do nothing except that
[1:55:29] except the father shows me that's the
[1:55:32] way we operate i don't have to prove to
[1:55:34] you
[1:55:35] that i'm a son of god i am a son of god
[1:55:38] i operate when my maker tell me what to
[1:55:41] do i'm not here to prove it to you i'm
[1:55:43] just living my life
[1:55:46] when you go to walmart do you go prove
[1:55:48] something to somebody you're going for
[1:55:50] admission you're going to get your
[1:55:51] groceries and goes out
[1:55:53] you don't have to be there proving the
[1:55:55] people who you are that's exactly how
[1:55:57] you walk in this world
[1:56:00] everybody okay
[1:56:03] one quote and we go home
[1:56:06] i left today
[1:56:07] but i have it in my own my phone brother
[1:56:09] branham say whatever god does with the
[1:56:12] messenger
[1:56:14] do you know that code
[1:56:16] can you hand me my phone
[1:56:18] i don't want you to say brother stephen
[1:56:20] say
[1:56:22] brother branham say the bible says
[1:56:24] everybody here
[1:56:26] let me get it for you and then you go
[1:56:28] home amen
[1:56:29] what a powerful message
[1:56:32] brother branham said this and discomfort
[1:56:35] is not for the servant church age
[1:56:38] messenger only
[1:56:40] every true believer
[1:56:43] is in the hand of god
[1:56:47] and can draw from his love
[1:56:50] and power
[1:56:51] and receive the full benefit
[1:56:54] of all that god
[1:56:56] is to the believer
[1:56:58] everybody okay
[1:56:59] he say what god gives the messenger
[1:57:04] karma
[1:57:05] and how he blesses
[1:57:08] and uses the messenger
[1:57:11] is an example
[1:57:13] to all believers
[1:57:16] of his goodness
[1:57:18] and care to all members of his body
[1:57:22] my messenger is not looter
[1:57:26] my messenger is not wesley my messenger
[1:57:30] is not seymour
[1:57:32] my messenger is william marion branham
[1:57:36] so whatever god did to brother branham
[1:57:41] is an example to me
[1:57:47] anybody here
[1:57:48] whatever god was doing in elijah
[1:57:53] was only an example for elisha matter of
[1:57:57] fact elijah b double

[1:58:08] branham
[1:58:09] simple as it is
[1:58:12] remember who you are
[1:58:14] you must act on your position
[1:58:16] and begin to behave like a son of king
[1:58:19] like a child of the king talk like a
[1:58:21] king by the solomon god richly bless you
[1:58:24] that's a machine gun
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:28] let's pray heavenly father
[1:58:31] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:58:33] tonight
[1:58:34] father thanking you for this powerful
[1:58:37] message
[1:58:38] that have uplifted your children
[1:58:41] giving them strength
[1:58:43] removing all the smokes that the devil
[1:58:46] was trying to bring in their life
[1:58:48] to question their mind to bring
[1:58:50] confusion and uncertainty
[1:58:53] because of the little trial they're
[1:58:55] going through lord
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:57] father you went to the greatest trial
[1:58:59] that anybody here can go through
[1:59:02] you took the sick seal completely
[1:59:05] it struck you
[1:59:08] on the cross
[1:59:10] so that we can never experience
[1:59:13] the tribulation period
[1:59:15] we can never experience calvary
[1:59:18] in a literal way you took all of it upon
[1:59:22] you
[1:59:22] and you made a way
[1:59:24] so that today further we can go back
[1:59:26] lord to where adam stood father adam
[1:59:31] left the garden of eden
[1:59:33] with a flaming sword
[1:59:35] turning everywhere
[1:59:37] and the caribbean blocking the way
[1:59:40] even the law was not able to open the
[1:59:42] way
[1:59:43] but father
[1:59:44] you came down in the flesh
[1:59:46] [Music]
[1:59:47] and through your flesh you open a new
[1:59:49] way
[1:59:50] and you split that veil completely
[1:59:53] and now the caribbean that we're
[1:59:56] guarding blocking the way to the tree of
[1:59:58] life
[1:59:59] these caribbean are working towards the
[2:00:02] edges
[2:00:02] to bring your children
[2:00:05] your children back again to the tree of
[2:00:07] life and no wonder in the church ages
[2:00:10] we have a reward for a tree of life
[2:00:13] because you say that blessed is he that
[2:00:16] do your commandment for they will have a
[2:00:18] right to the tree of life
[2:00:20] father we thank you for restoring us
[2:00:23] back to this
[2:00:24] father throughout the years minister has
[2:00:27] preached on these things
[2:00:29] we heard it left and right
[2:00:32] we are back to what adam lost
[2:00:34] but lord let this be a reality
[2:00:37] because there is absolutely no way that
[2:00:40] the world can manifest their position
[2:00:43] and your children cannot manifest their
[2:00:46] position
[2:00:47] if the chief the world is climbing so
[2:00:49] high in sin
[2:00:51] father it's a sign that on the other way
[2:00:54] on the other side father your children
[2:00:56] are climbing higher to their position
[2:00:59] father may you remove every spirit of
[2:01:01] fear
[2:01:02] every doubt that the devil is trying to
[2:01:04] bring to the mind of your children to
[2:01:07] know who they are to accept who they are
[2:01:10] regardless of the situation just like
[2:01:13] gideon may they don't look at her
[2:01:15] complex at their height at their size
[2:01:18] because it's not really the size of the
[2:01:21] dog in the fight but it's the size of
[2:01:23] the fight in the dog and father you told
[2:01:26] us in your word that greater is it is he
[2:01:29] that is in you father and you are the
[2:01:31] one in us
[2:01:33] lord
[2:01:34] may we release that faith and let it
[2:01:37] operate the way it's supposed to be and
[2:01:40] may you protect and touch your children
[2:01:43] father i pray for the hamilton family
[2:01:46] lord i know they have been placed in
[2:01:48] quarantine but lord i pray that that
[2:01:51] demon called kovid
[2:01:53] leave their home completely and make
[2:01:56] that demon go back to hell in the name
[2:01:59] of jesus christ and may no one
[2:02:02] experience any symptom but may they take
[2:02:04] the time
[2:02:05] for a consecration lord and a closer
[2:02:08] walk with you lord i commit this church
[2:02:10] unto the hand may you strengthen your
[2:02:13] manservant that you use brother solomon
[2:02:15] lord give him more strength lord and
[2:02:18] continue to use him in a powerful way
[2:02:20] and continue to bless this church lord
[2:02:23] and to free us completely so that in
[2:02:25] this church there won't be anybody where
[2:02:28] sin is having dominion upon him
[2:02:31] father we commit everything and tonight
[2:02:34] unto the hand in the name of jesus
[2:02:36] christ
[2:02:38] hallelujah
