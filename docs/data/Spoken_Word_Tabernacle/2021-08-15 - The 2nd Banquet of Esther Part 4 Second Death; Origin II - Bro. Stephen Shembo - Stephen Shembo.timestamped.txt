[21:29] mine
[21:34] hallelujah hallelujah
[21:39] hallelujah
[21:44] i want to sing a portion of one more you
[21:47] know um
[21:49] and i want to i want to
[21:52] i want to say something
[21:54] before we sing it
[21:56] i know
[21:57] sometimes it seems the span of my songs
[22:00] are limited
[22:01] and they're repeats
[22:02] i sing i try to sing what you know it
[22:05] kind of makes me happy that i'll fly
[22:07] away just
[22:08] makes me want to soar
[22:10] and not s-o-r-e but s-o-a-r you know
[22:13] what i'm saying it's like an eagle
[22:15] um these songs this morning you know
[22:19] we've been through a lot in the past
[22:21] year and a half with uh
[22:23] you know what we felt from leaving the
[22:25] other church
[22:26] and the pandemic
[22:28] and you know
[22:30] so i said well
[22:32] we'll understand it
[22:34] better by and by
[22:35] it's not our place to have to try to
[22:37] worry about it
[22:38] we just worship god
[22:41] and then
[22:43] we have victory this morning
[22:46] okay
[22:48] [Applause]
[22:50] so there is a little bit of a method to
[22:53] my you know selection occasionally
[22:56] um it's not just let's see this so i
[22:58] don't have to think about what we're
[22:59] gonna see i do try to get quiet and
[23:04] i'm gonna work on some new ones though
[23:05] okay i got one my wife has been
[23:06] suggesting
[23:08] but the next song
[23:11] is also kind of a place to where i feel
[23:13] like we've been led too
[23:15] because
[23:16] we
[23:18] we don't have grudges we don't hold
[23:20] grudges for what has
[23:22] happened
[23:23] because god has shown us and he's led us
[23:26] as overcomers
[23:28] victorious
[23:31] to be here today
[23:33] and
[23:36] i love looking at the faces that i see
[23:38] when i'm sitting here
[23:41] so i want to sing a portion of it is
[23:43] well with my soul
[23:45] because i'm at peace

[23:52] the church is not the building
[23:54] y'all are the church
[23:56] god has honored that
[23:59] so
[24:01] the only way to go from here is up

[24:06] don't preach
[24:08] but i had to say okay
[24:11] so let's sing this i'm not going to sing

[53:30] late
[53:31] [Music]
[53:32] well let me introduce you to
[53:36] amazing grace
[53:40] no matter the bumps
[53:43] no matter the rules it is no matter the
[53:47] scars
[53:49] still the truth is the cross as me
[53:54] the cross
[53:55] [Music]
[54:07] says no matter
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:23] could it possibly be
[54:26] that we simply can't believe
[54:29] that this
[54:30] unconditional
[54:32] kind of love would be enough to
[54:36] take a
[54:37] like this
[54:38] and wrap it probably righteousness
[54:41] but exactly what it is
[54:47] [Music]
[54:55] still the truth is the cross says
[55:00] [Music]
[55:10] [Music]
[55:14] no matter the pain
[55:17] still the truth
[55:28] [Music]
[55:32] take a breath and smile and stay right
[55:34] here right now i'm okay
[55:37] because
[55:37] [Music]
[55:40] the cross was enough
[55:46] [Music]
[55:49] then like a hero takes the stage when
[55:54] we're
[55:55] on the edge of our seats
[56:14] no matter
[56:25] the cross says
[56:30] [Laughter]
[56:40] no matter the pain
[56:43] still the truth is across
[56:48] the cross
[57:08] hallelujah

[1:04:31] fellowship
[1:04:32] so
[1:04:34] we want the families to come
[1:04:36] we're going to have um
[1:04:40] things for activities for the young
[1:04:43] and for the little ones as well as for
[1:04:44] the adults with mothers fathers children
[1:04:47] you come you bring a picnic lunch so the
[1:04:50] church would not be for providing uh
[1:04:52] lunch at this time you bring your own
[1:04:53] and maybe something to share
[1:04:55] so we can just spend some time together
[1:04:58] things like about from
[1:05:02] from 10 o'clock in the morning to four
[1:05:04] in the afternoon
[1:05:05] and um
[1:05:06] we are timing it to prepare the children
[1:05:10] to go back to school on the 25th
[1:05:12] so we're going to have prayer
[1:05:14] with the children at the end of the day
[1:05:17] um so we want to come prepared for that
[1:05:18] as we
[1:05:20] commit them into the hands of the lord
[1:05:22] in this time
[1:05:24] but um
[1:05:25] as we focus on where we are now what god
[1:05:27] has done for us
[1:05:29] we want to remember that this sanctuary
[1:05:31] that we sit in here
[1:05:33] it is
[1:05:35] prepared for worship and communion with
[1:05:38] our lord jesus
[1:05:40] we want to remember that
[1:05:42] we don't want to have talking
[1:05:44] among each other we can talk on the
[1:05:46] outside but when we come in here our
[1:05:49] focus is our lord
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:52] we want to also
[1:05:55] at the end of the series when the holy
[1:05:57] spirit is moving we want to give time
[1:06:00] for the lord to deal with the heart he's
[1:06:02] dealing with
[1:06:03] if someone is here praying
[1:06:06] whatever we have to do we need to
[1:06:09] let that be the priority let the holy
[1:06:11] spirit working be the priority
[1:06:14] we're in our own place we don't have to
[1:06:15] be rushed out nobody is waiting to come
[1:06:18] to use the room
[1:06:20] and god has given this to us we're gonna
[1:06:21] give it a hundred percent back to him
[1:06:25] everything else
[1:06:26] must take second place if you have any
[1:06:28] movement to do any fixing to do
[1:06:31] if the holy spirit is working with a
[1:06:32] heart just stand back and stay quiet and
[1:06:35] let the lord look work
[1:06:38] we want to teach our children
[1:06:41] to respect the property god has given us
[1:06:44] we must not have don't allow anyone to
[1:06:46] run through the building
[1:06:48] no frolicking
[1:06:51] we want to remember that the sound room
[1:06:55] is only for authorized people it's not
[1:06:58] you don't want to be going back and
[1:06:59] forth and the sound room in the office
[1:07:02] that's in the front on the as you're
[1:07:03] going out to the left
[1:07:06] you want to just respect the spaces
[1:07:10] the cry room
[1:07:12] is still under construction we apologize
[1:07:14] to
[1:07:15] precious mothers and babies
[1:07:17] but um in a couple of weeks time it will
[1:07:19] be ready
[1:07:20] um we have provided
[1:07:22] just a temporary setup there
[1:07:24] but we will have it um completed in a
[1:07:26] couple of weeks
[1:07:31] and this thought has been in my heart
[1:07:33] as we have been working and getting this
[1:07:35] space ready
[1:07:36] we wanted to make it nice for the people
[1:07:38] of god
[1:07:39] and god has provided us with a very
[1:07:41] beautiful place of worship
[1:07:48] but it reminds me of
[1:07:52] we don't want to consume the beauty of
[1:07:55] this place
[1:07:56] on ourselves
[1:07:58] and an example of that was
[1:08:00] when king david was out fighting and he
[1:08:03] wanted
[1:08:04] some water from the well in bethlehem
[1:08:08] and three men expended their lives to go
[1:08:10] and bring it for him
[1:08:12] he didn't consume that water he poured
[1:08:14] it out to the lord
[1:08:17] we also remember the prophet telling us
[1:08:19] about
[1:08:21] when the the lord gives us his word
[1:08:24] particularly for the young woman or all
[1:08:27] women
[1:08:28] that are here the here is given for the
[1:08:30] covering
[1:08:31] and the devil will try to make you cut
[1:08:33] you here and break your vow
[1:08:35] well if he can't get you that way
[1:08:38] then you'll be growing in here nice and
[1:08:40] long and looks beautiful
[1:08:43] then they will try to make you think
[1:08:44] well
[1:08:45] i'm so beautiful
[1:08:47] and you start using that beauty for
[1:08:49] yourself
[1:08:50] we don't want to be caught on either
[1:08:52] side
[1:08:53] and the point i'm making is
[1:08:55] now god has given us a place
[1:08:58] let us not
[1:08:59] be out publishing
[1:09:01] photographs and
[1:09:03] look at this place we have and
[1:09:04] let us not go that route
[1:09:07] there are traps
[1:09:09] on that road
[1:09:10] there was a king called hezekiah one
[1:09:12] time
[1:09:13] and he was so
[1:09:15] backslid
[1:09:17] he invited the king of babylon to see
[1:09:20] all the beautiful things that he had all
[1:09:21] the treasures
[1:09:23] and that was his that was his
[1:09:25] his demise because the king of babylon
[1:09:28] came and took everything away what god
[1:09:30] has given us we praise him for it
[1:09:32] it's beautiful we want to keep it for
[1:09:34] him
[1:09:35] but we don't want to be going out
[1:09:37] showing off
[1:09:38] that is the idea we're trying to convey
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:43] as the prophet said the beauty of the
[1:09:45] church
[1:09:47] is the character of the people
[1:09:50] what we want to have by god's grace
[1:09:54] is a people so in harmony
[1:09:57] and love as the prophet was speaking in
[1:09:59] a message humble thyself he said in the
[1:10:02] old church
[1:10:03] there was the people loved one another
[1:10:05] so much
[1:10:07] they even cried
[1:10:08] to part
[1:10:10] they just cared and we don't want to
[1:10:12] have
[1:10:13] this self coming in the way the beauty
[1:10:16] of the church is not the paint and the
[1:10:18] carpet
[1:10:20] and all the electronics is the character
[1:10:22] of the people
[1:10:24] we want the beauty of jesus christ to be
[1:10:26] seen in us i just want to read from that
[1:10:29] um just a reminder here
[1:10:36] in the message on
[1:10:43] god hiding himself in simplicity when
[1:10:45] the prophet was
[1:10:46] before he pushed the seals
[1:10:48] and they had just done redone the
[1:10:50] tabernacle
[1:10:52] he said now i think it's our duty to
[1:10:54] make
[1:10:56] the inside right by the grace of god
[1:10:59] to be so grateful to our god that
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] will just be
[1:11:06] one beautiful building that will come to
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:10] but may everyone who comes in
[1:11:14] see the beautiful characteristic of
[1:11:16] jesus christ in every person that comes
[1:11:20] may it be a consecrated place
[1:11:23] to our lord a consecrated people
[1:11:26] for no matter how beautiful the
[1:11:28] structure is
[1:11:31] that we certainly do appreciate
[1:11:34] the beauty of the church
[1:11:36] is the character of the people
[1:11:39] trust it will always be
[1:11:41] a house of god of beauty
[1:11:44] amen praise the lord bless you all
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:56] i don't know if anybody just spent more
[1:11:57] time working over here than brother
[1:11:59] robert

[1:12:02] or he wouldn't have said it

[1:12:11] him his time

[1:21:02] blessed be the name of the lord in the
[1:21:04] message what here is that elijah
[1:21:07] brother branham say that i usually think
[1:21:10] this
[1:21:11] and i hope that
[1:21:13] if i'm wrong the lord will forgive me
[1:21:16] but i feel like you can have a better
[1:21:19] meeting
[1:21:20] in a church
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:27] because in these big auditoriums
[1:21:30] and things they are all right to see the
[1:21:33] people
[1:21:34] but i hope it's not a superstition but
[1:21:37] it always seems to be
[1:21:39] to me there is so much wickedness going
[1:21:42] on in them places
[1:21:44] fight and gamble and whiskey and it just
[1:21:48] became a place where evil spirit hang
[1:21:51] out
[1:21:52] and it's amazing how we could be in a
[1:21:54] hotel with that kind of anointing
[1:22:00] amen
[1:22:01] around the church the holy spirit kind
[1:22:04] of sticks around
[1:22:06] i like to get around where the holy
[1:22:08] spirit is
[1:22:09] i feel more at home you know to be
[1:22:12] around where the holy spirit is
[1:22:15] and especially wherever the church is of
[1:22:19] course they bring the holy spirit with
[1:22:21] them we are grateful for that
[1:22:24] amen so if we have what we have there in
[1:22:27] the hotel
[1:22:29] our expectation should be
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:35] i told you you have four of them you
[1:22:38] know i think some of the best meeting we
[1:22:40] ever have is in water
[1:22:45] sometime the meeting you know get to a
[1:22:47] place where crowds are great we can't
[1:22:50] get into a lot of churches and so forth
[1:22:52] or big churches but there is something
[1:22:54] about a church house
[1:22:57] i hope you won't think that i went off
[1:23:00] in on some tantrum since i've seen you
[1:23:03] last but you know i believe that a place
[1:23:05] a church is where god stays
[1:23:09] angels dwell among the churches
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:16] it's a place that is dedicated to the
[1:23:18] service of god
[1:23:20] out in this auditorium and things hotel
[1:23:24] we found i'm just putting things i can
[1:23:27] slide the hotel there we found they have
[1:23:30] parties
[1:23:31] dances drinking and everything you feel
[1:23:34] the spirit that don't seem that don't
[1:23:36] seem right it just seems like it is uh
[1:23:39] otherwise the holy spirit always seems
[1:23:42] to work so much different
[1:23:45] when you are in a church
[1:23:47] you know somewhere especially in a good
[1:23:51] spirit-filled church
[1:23:54] where the people are filled with the
[1:23:56] holy spirit and great signs and wonders
[1:23:59] takes place
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] i'm putting you on to this so your
[1:24:04] expectation goes up
[1:24:06] there is something about a church that
[1:24:08] is sacred
[1:24:10] i like a church don't you
[1:24:12] you know you go to this auditorium we
[1:24:15] appreciate them now they are nice and
[1:24:18] the people that let us have them the
[1:24:20] trustees and so forth trustees
[1:24:23] but look what
[1:24:26] they're the one responsible for it but
[1:24:28] look what you have there you have all
[1:24:31] kind of vulgarity
[1:24:33] brother chimp keep reminding this all
[1:24:35] the time he said brother stephen this is
[1:24:36] the hotel this is the hotel this is the
[1:24:39] water you have all kind of vulgarity
[1:24:42] entertainment or falcon of the world and
[1:24:46] demon spirit hang around there and it's
[1:24:48] just brought in by demon you get to a
[1:24:52] church the holy spirit is there you see
[1:24:56] it's just something different about
[1:24:59] the coming to our
[1:25:01] church anybody clear
[1:25:03] last one i didn't pray i didn't make it
[1:25:06] he gave me four i felt really honored
[1:25:09] tonight to come into a church like this
[1:25:12] i always feel better in a church than i
[1:25:16] do in those auditorium there is nothing
[1:25:19] against the auditorium but you know it
[1:25:22] may be a superstition seems
[1:25:24] to me like a truth you go into this
[1:25:28] into those auditorium where there is
[1:25:30] fight to wrestle burlesque everything
[1:25:32] else going on evil spirit seems to hang
[1:25:36] around them places
[1:25:38] now you may immed that may seem a
[1:25:40] superstition but it's not so but when
[1:25:42] you come into a church usually certainly
[1:25:46] a spiritual congregation it seems like
[1:25:49] you feel more at liberty like there is
[1:25:52] something the presence of god is there
[1:25:55] you know it seems to be different i
[1:25:57] don't know what effect the building has
[1:26:00] but it's where the people are
[1:26:02] congregated of course the same people
[1:26:05] are at the other places but on those
[1:26:08] evil ground amen so there is something
[1:26:11] special about church
[1:26:13] that makes the service of god go a
[1:26:15] little bit different and the lord has
[1:26:18] been gracious to us because we were in
[1:26:20] the transition place
[1:26:22] like the ark of the covenant was in the
[1:26:24] house of habitab
[1:26:26] and yet the lord blessed the house but
[1:26:28] he was not god's chosen place of worship
[1:26:31] so if the house of abinadab can be
[1:26:33] blessed how much more the temple of
[1:26:36] solomon
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:38] in the temple of solomon the cloud came
[1:26:41] down
[1:26:42] so we want to thank god for giving us a
[1:26:44] building
[1:26:45] and now we are at home
[1:26:48] amen let's give him a praise offering
[1:26:50] again
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:55] hallelujah
[1:26:57] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:27:00] let's stand for our reading
[1:27:04] welcome to spoken word tabernacle
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:18] you bear with me
[1:27:21] the work with the other
[1:27:24] microphone this is kinda new
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:34] better
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:38] luke chapter 16 verse 19.
[1:27:43] we read this
[1:27:44] the last time
[1:27:48] if you're there you can say amen
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:52] there was a certain rich man
[1:27:55] which was clothed in purple you might be
[1:27:58] seated brother do you have a sharpie
[1:28:01] it's right there
[1:28:03] in this
[1:28:04] scripture here
[1:28:06] there is
[1:28:10] if i put it here you won't be able to
[1:28:11] see it
[1:28:12] amen there was
[1:28:15] a certain rich man which was clothed in
[1:28:17] purple
[1:28:18] and fine linen
[1:28:20] this man is clothed in purple and fine
[1:28:23] linen and we know the end of this man he
[1:28:26] went into fire if he went into hell that
[1:28:29] means that his origin
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:32] was not from god
[1:28:34] because the lord will lose none of this
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:38] and we found him his clothes here in
[1:28:41] purple number one
[1:28:43] and in fine linen
[1:28:45] and fair sumptuously every day he was
[1:28:48] living lavishly
[1:28:50] clothes in purple fine linen and living
[1:28:53] lavishly amen the bible says in
[1:28:57] revelation 18 verse 7
[1:29:00] how much she has glorified herself
[1:29:02] speaking about babylon and leave hell
[1:29:06] deliciously lavishly amen
[1:29:09] so much torment
[1:29:11] and sorrow gave her
[1:29:13] for she said in her heart
[1:29:16] i see a queen and i am no widow and
[1:29:19] shall see no sorrow she was living
[1:29:22] lavishly deliciously and by living that
[1:29:26] the lord said give her more torment
[1:29:30] more sorrow
[1:29:32] verse 16 and saying alas
[1:29:35] that great city we know a city this a
[1:29:37] woman that was clothed in water
[1:29:40] and in water
[1:29:42] so you can see the characteristic of the
[1:29:44] rich young man holder
[1:29:46] he's a child of babylon
[1:29:50] even though he knew the word of god
[1:29:52] because babylon has a religious spirit
[1:29:56] yet there are clothes in purple fine
[1:29:59] linen and leave her deliciously that's
[1:30:02] what happened to this young man
[1:30:04] now you can see if you have this kind of
[1:30:07] characteristic you go into torment
[1:30:10] and where do you expect this young man
[1:30:12] to go
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:14] let's go back now there was a certain
[1:30:16] rich man
[1:30:18] that was close in purple and fine lenin
[1:30:21] and first sumptuously every day now you
[1:30:24] understand his origin
[1:30:25] where he's coming from brother david if
[1:30:28] this is making a lot of noise you want
[1:30:29] me to use the other one that's fine
[1:30:33] you tell me what to do
[1:30:35] we good you want me switch
[1:30:37] praise the name of the lord
[1:30:56] yes
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:11] give me a little bit more so i blow him
[1:31:13] up amen
[1:31:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:17] hallelujah and there was a certain
[1:31:20] beggar named lazarus which was led at
[1:31:23] his gate
[1:31:24] full of soul and desiring to be fed with
[1:31:27] the crimes which fell from the rich
[1:31:30] man's table
[1:31:31] moreover the dogs came and licks his
[1:31:34] sword
[1:31:35] and he came to pass that the beggar died
[1:31:38] if you notice they never say about
[1:31:40] burying him
[1:31:42] he's a beggar they can cast him anyway
[1:31:44] he didn't have that luxurious burial
[1:31:48] amen
[1:31:49] and it come to pass that the beggar died
[1:31:52] and was carried by angel that's the most
[1:31:54] important thing
[1:31:56] into abraham's bosom
[1:31:59] the rich man also died and was water
[1:32:02] because the burial was so big sumptuous
[1:32:05] everybody the entire city the mayor of
[1:32:07] the city the governor everybody was
[1:32:09] there
[1:32:10] but the other one was carried by angel
[1:32:13] didn't look big amen
[1:32:15] and in hell
[1:32:17] he lift up his eyes
[1:32:19] being in turman
[1:32:21] what i want you to understand is the
[1:32:23] story of this young man is the story of
[1:32:27] this rich man is the story of the rich
[1:32:30] young ruler
[1:32:37] okay
[1:32:39] you okay
[1:32:40] the rich young ruler when he came to
[1:32:43] jesus christ
[1:32:44] he proved to jesus that he followed the
[1:32:47] law
[1:32:48] everything right in line ever clear
[1:32:51] and jesus looked at him and loved him
[1:32:54] because he presented the law
[1:32:57] there's nothing wrong with the law i am
[1:32:58] the one who worried who who who created
[1:33:01] the law
[1:33:02] but
[1:33:03] when jesus put his microscope on
[1:33:07] ebay and begin to go down his life and
[1:33:11] look at the life
[1:33:12] he found what was wrong with that boy
[1:33:16] that prohibited him from receiving
[1:33:19] eternal life
[1:33:20] and his problem was what
[1:33:23] get your money and give it to who
[1:33:26] he had a problem with poor people
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:32] brother branham put those two stories
[1:33:35] together and brother branham never
[1:33:37] explained you why those two story goes
[1:33:40] together
[1:33:43] if you don't understand this message
[1:33:45] relax
[1:33:46] anybody here
[1:33:47] so the problem with the rich young ruler
[1:33:50] was the problem with poor people
[1:33:54] and if you look at this rich man here
[1:33:57] his problem is there is a poor right
[1:33:59] there and still he doesn't want to share
[1:34:02] his money that's why jesus told him get
[1:34:05] the money
[1:34:06] share it together then follow me i'm
[1:34:08] gonna give you eternal life
[1:34:10] but if you remember last sunday for you
[1:34:13] to receive eternal life
[1:34:15] there must be something in you
[1:34:18] that's going to attract eternal life you
[1:34:21] must have eternal life in you
[1:34:24] for eternal life to come through you if
[1:34:26] you didn't have eternal life in you even
[1:34:29] though you facing eternal life eternal
[1:34:32] life will deviate
[1:34:37] because of where you come from
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:42] and in hell
[1:34:44] he lift up his eyes being in torment and
[1:34:47] sees abraham and pharaoh
[1:34:49] and lazarus in his bosom
[1:34:52] that's another thing and he cry and say
[1:34:55] father abraham
[1:34:56] he also knew abraham in hell
[1:34:59] who taught him that was abraham
[1:35:01] he was in a different eophony
[1:35:05] okay we will get it down the road
[1:35:07] have mercy on me
[1:35:09] and send lazarus that he may deep
[1:35:13] tip of his finger in water and cool my
[1:35:16] tongue for i am tormented in water
[1:35:20] he was given opportunity
[1:35:23] to meet eternal life
[1:35:26] he met eternal life
[1:35:28] he entertained with eternal life
[1:35:31] and then he turned his back on eternal
[1:35:34] life what caused him to reject eternal
[1:35:38] life
[1:35:39] at the beginning it seems like he wanted
[1:35:43] but when they presented to him he went
[1:35:45] back again
[1:35:47] and there are some people that seems
[1:35:49] like they don't want it
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:53] but when they're gonna face eternal life
[1:35:57] you're gonna see their reaction
[1:36:00] what makes one behave one way
[1:36:03] and the other behave a different way
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:07] the god who is rich in mercy
[1:36:10] let's go to hebrew chapter 6
[1:36:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:36:16] hallelujah
[1:36:18] for you to get this kind of stuff
[1:36:21] you need a prophet
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:32] i used to wonder i say why did brother
[1:36:34] branham put this story together why did
[1:36:36] brother branham put this story together
[1:36:38] and one day
[1:36:40] poverty poverty that's the connection
[1:36:46] you see
[1:36:47] the message is always
[1:36:50] perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:36:53] hebrew chapter 6 verse 7 for the earth
[1:36:56] which drinks in the rain
[1:36:59] that come often upon it
[1:37:01] and brings forth herbs
[1:37:03] meat for them
[1:37:05] by whom it is dressed receiving
[1:37:07] blessings from god
[1:37:10] what paul is saying here is
[1:37:12] people cultivate
[1:37:14] they have a field
[1:37:15] and they are
[1:37:17] sowing a certain seed because they are
[1:37:19] looking to receive something from that
[1:37:21] seed either for their meat or something
[1:37:24] that they want to use it so when the
[1:37:26] sauce seed remember last sunday we
[1:37:28] talked about the parable in matthew 13.
[1:37:31] there were two seed to sower everybody
[1:37:33] clear so when they sow they will receive
[1:37:36] that which they like if they sow wheat
[1:37:38] they're going to receive wheat if they
[1:37:40] sow corn they're going to receive corn
[1:37:42] and when they receive corn they bless
[1:37:44] the lord because that's what they were
[1:37:46] expecting but verse 9
[1:37:49] verse 8 but that which bare thorns
[1:37:53] and briar is water
[1:37:55] so there is two seed here there is a
[1:37:57] good seed that is useful but there is
[1:38:00] another one that comes out
[1:38:02] we don't know who put it there but
[1:38:04] matthew 13 told us it's the enemy
[1:38:06] everybody clear and those thorn and
[1:38:09] briar are rejected
[1:38:11] and is near to cursing whose end is to
[1:38:14] through water
[1:38:16] there is one seed that needs to be used
[1:38:20] one seed to be used
[1:38:25] everybody
[1:38:26] the other seed
[1:38:28] is to be cursed
[1:38:31] and it doesn't stop at the cursing it
[1:38:34] need to be burned
[1:38:36] why do you want to burn this one
[1:38:39] let's go to revelation chapter one
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:55] these are stuff hidden
[1:38:58] it's the book of esther that is bringing
[1:39:00] those stuff
[1:39:03] revelation 1
[1:39:05] verse 13.
[1:39:08] brother
[1:39:09] can you put this board here
[1:39:12] because i can't go there
[1:39:14] just a little bit here
[1:39:17] you can face this way
[1:39:21] we need it in certain things you're
[1:39:23] going to understand the omniscient of
[1:39:25] god yes sir can you see up there
[1:39:27] just tilt it a little bit
[1:39:30] before i get in trouble you go back
[1:39:32] toward the pack
[1:39:33] push it toward the back yes sir yep
[1:39:36] everybody clear there
[1:39:37] thank you
[1:39:38] jesus
[1:39:40] revelation chapter 1 verse 13 if you
[1:39:43] dare you can say amen
[1:39:44] and in the midst of the seven
[1:39:47] candlestick
[1:39:48] one like the son of man clothed with a
[1:39:51] garment down to the foot
[1:39:53] and gird about the breast with a gordon
[1:39:57] girdle
[1:39:58] he's a judge
[1:40:00] anybody clear
[1:40:02] if you don't know it you read the seven
[1:40:03] church ages
[1:40:05] his head and his hair were white like
[1:40:09] wall
[1:40:14] oh my god
[1:40:17] the hair of this judge
[1:40:19] there is a judge
[1:40:22] he have hair
[1:40:24] his hair
[1:40:25] is white
[1:40:27] like wall
[1:40:30] when you take a picture you're going to
[1:40:31] see it white
[1:40:34] amen as white as snow
[1:40:38] and his eyes were as flame of fire
[1:40:44] like snow
[1:40:45] but his eyes
[1:40:47] are like flame of fire
[1:40:52] so he's not friendly really
[1:40:55] he's in anger
[1:40:58] he's a judge
[1:41:00] in anger
[1:41:02] anybody clear
[1:41:03] and his feet
[1:41:05] like to find brass
[1:41:07] judgment
[1:41:09] anybody clear
[1:41:11] brass represents judgment
[1:41:16] so this man this man is completely a
[1:41:19] judge
[1:41:20] he's not coming here for mercy
[1:41:24] and he's fit to find brass
[1:41:27] as
[1:41:28] if they were burned in a furnace
[1:41:31] he was in a furnace one time with the
[1:41:33] hebrew
[1:41:34] and his voice as the sound of many
[1:41:37] waters everybody clear
[1:41:41] let's go to revelation chapter 19.
[1:41:46] if you dare you can say amen
[1:41:48] then we will pray
[1:41:50] hallelujah
[1:41:53] revelation chapter 19
[1:41:59] verse 11.
[1:42:07] we know in verse 8 we're talking about
[1:42:09] the bride
[1:42:11] the marriage of the lamb is in verse 7
[1:42:13] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:42:16] everybody clear
[1:42:18] verse 9 is talking about being blessed
[1:42:20] which are called to the marriage supper
[1:42:21] of the lamb
[1:42:23] now in verse 11 the bible say i saw
[1:42:25] heaven open
[1:42:27] and behold a white horse
[1:42:29] and he that sat upon him was called
[1:42:33] faithful and true
[1:42:35] we know that person
[1:42:37] and in righteousness he does what
[1:42:41] and make water
[1:42:43] this man when he comes discharged
[1:42:46] he is coming not only to judge
[1:42:49] but for war
[1:42:54] everybody clear
[1:42:57] verse 12 his eyes were as water
[1:43:03] so you understand now by the scripture
[1:43:05] who he is
[1:43:07] here
[1:43:08] if his eyes turn like flame of fire
[1:43:11] then he's coming to judge and to make
[1:43:14] war
[1:43:15] if his eyes are natural and they are
[1:43:17] crying
[1:43:18] in front of lazarus
[1:43:20] grave
[1:43:21] then it's still
[1:43:23] mercy
[1:43:25] it is the same person
[1:43:27] but he can flip
[1:43:29] he can be a lion
[1:43:31] and he can also be a lamb
[1:43:33] it is the same throne
[1:43:37] the throne of mercy and the throne of
[1:43:39] judgment are the same throne
[1:43:42] it depends whether there is blood or not
[1:43:46] if there is blood it's the throne of
[1:43:48] mercy
[1:43:49] if the blood is taken off then it's the
[1:43:51] turn of judgment behold the lion of the
[1:43:55] tribe of judah here prevailed when john
[1:43:57] turned around he saw a lamb
[1:44:00] yet he was coming like a lion
[1:44:07] the announcement is a lion
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:13] the coming
[1:44:15] the coming
[1:44:16] is a coming of leo
[1:44:19] it's the lion we already touched the
[1:44:21] zodiac
[1:44:22] everybody clear
[1:44:24] back to john
[1:44:30] to john who's john
[1:44:33] who's john
[1:44:36] so to john
[1:44:38] to the bride
[1:44:39] that lion is not lying
[1:44:44] everybody clear
[1:44:46] when john look at the lion
[1:44:48] that lion have to immorphy
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:53] if you take john out of the way then
[1:44:55] he's a lion
[1:44:56] if you just present john the lion have
[1:44:59] to immortal quickly into a lambo
[1:45:02] and not only a lamb a bleeding lamb
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:12] anybody clear
[1:45:15] that judge
[1:45:16] [Laughter]
[1:45:19] verse 12 his eyes were as a flame of
[1:45:22] fire
[1:45:24] and on his head were many clowns
[1:45:27] and he's and had a name written that no
[1:45:30] man knew but himself he himself
[1:45:33] and he was clothed with a vesture
[1:45:36] deep in blood
[1:45:38] he still have blood
[1:45:40] and his name is called the water
[1:45:43] in the beginning was though
[1:45:45] and the word was with
[1:45:47] and the word was
[1:45:49] and the word was made flesh
[1:45:51] and dwell on us in the person of who
[1:45:55] the father judges no man
[1:45:58] but he committed all the judgment to him
[1:46:03] anybody clear
[1:46:05] hallelujah and the army which were in
[1:46:08] heaven follow him upon white horses
[1:46:11] clothed in what
[1:46:13] fine linen white and clean we already
[1:46:15] know that's the righteousness of the
[1:46:17] sand so this man coming here is a judge
[1:46:21] he's coming to judge and to make war but
[1:46:25] even though he's coming to judge
[1:46:28] i mean
[1:46:28] to do judgment it depends on who he sees
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:37] anybody clear
[1:46:38] it depends on who he is seeing
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] let's pray
[1:46:47] heavenly father
[1:46:49] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:46:51] for your love for your mercy and for
[1:46:53] giving us an opportunity to be able to
[1:46:57] worship you in this temple this
[1:46:59] tabernacle lord father that you have
[1:47:02] provided for your children

[1:47:07] years
[1:47:08] and father you reserve it for your
[1:47:10] children because you knew the hidden
[1:47:13] plan of redemption that you had to
[1:47:16] unfold for your children at the
[1:47:18] appropriate time
[1:47:20] and when time came there was no devil in
[1:47:23] hell that could close or block or lord
[1:47:26] father block or inhibit your children to
[1:47:29] be able to gather here today and father
[1:47:32] to worship you
[1:47:33] lord if there is anything that we did
[1:47:35] that we grieve the holy spirit father
[1:47:38] you know the desire of our heart it is
[1:47:41] nothing but to serve you lord may you
[1:47:43] forgive us and may you move us
[1:47:45] completely away may the holy spirit come
[1:47:48] and speak to your children may the devil
[1:47:50] be completely sealed out but may only
[1:47:53] the holy spirit can come and minister to
[1:47:56] your children with the holy angels of
[1:47:59] god father we commit all unto the hand
[1:48:01] even those that are streaming in the
[1:48:04] name of jesus christ
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:07] god richly bless you amen
[1:48:11] last sunday we were in part three on the
[1:48:14] second death we were dealing with the
[1:48:16] origin
[1:48:17] we finished the origin of the vessels of
[1:48:19] mercy
[1:48:20] and there were also vessels of water
[1:48:23] of wrath
[1:48:25] origin part two you can call the other
[1:48:27] one part one
[1:48:29] we found out that when man
[1:48:31] is created men have three parts
[1:48:34] men have the spirit and the soul which
[1:48:36] makes the spiritual part of man
[1:48:39] and the body which make the natural part
[1:48:41] of man everybody clear
[1:48:43] then we were dealing with death in the
[1:48:46] natural
[1:48:47] in the natural we spoke that death
[1:48:49] effect as the first death or the second
[1:48:52] death and we explain to you that the
[1:48:54] first death deal with the body is the
[1:48:56] destruction of the body that activate
[1:48:59] the skin worm everybody clear
[1:49:01] but death in the spiritual is something
[1:49:04] else
[1:49:04] it deals with the spiritual aspect of a
[1:49:07] human being brother branham says that
[1:49:10] just refreshing he said if there is one
[1:49:12] death we know about it then there's got
[1:49:15] to be another death somewhere because
[1:49:18] one death we died here in the flesh
[1:49:20] that's the first death
[1:49:22] the second death we die it in the spirit
[1:49:25] and the soul and we explained to you on
[1:49:28] sunday last week that for you to destroy
[1:49:31] somebody completely
[1:49:33] you must give him the first death and
[1:49:35] the second death anybody
[1:49:38] but the only one that can give both
[1:49:40] those death is the lord jesus christ
[1:49:43] satan can give you the first death and
[1:49:46] he stopped there because he's your his
[1:49:48] kingdom or his power and it's right
[1:49:50] there but the lord goes beyond that
[1:49:52] everybody clear
[1:49:54] so the second death that affected the
[1:49:56] spiritual man
[1:49:58] in isaiah chapter 33 verse 22 the bible
[1:50:02] said for the lord is our judge
[1:50:05] america
[1:50:07] the lord is our law giver
[1:50:10] so this judge is not only a judge but
[1:50:13] he's also a lawgiver he's the one that
[1:50:16] give his own law
[1:50:18] ever clear that's why when he needed a
[1:50:20] propitiation for sin he have to fulfill
[1:50:23] his own law
[1:50:24] everybody here
[1:50:26] the lord is our lord give our lord giver
[1:50:30] the lord is our king amen so to us god
[1:50:34] is the judge
[1:50:36] to us god is a lord giver and to us god
[1:50:40] is also our king
[1:50:43] but
[1:50:44] he will save us
[1:50:46] so even though he is a judge
[1:50:49] even though he is a law giver even
[1:50:52] though he's a king our his purpose
[1:50:55] toward us
[1:50:57] is salvation
[1:50:59] ever clear
[1:51:02] in james chapter 4 verse 12 the bible
[1:51:05] says there is how many law givers
[1:51:08] one who is there
[1:51:10] the lord
[1:51:12] there is one lord giver who is able to
[1:51:15] save
[1:51:17] and to do
[1:51:18] whatever so this law giver have the
[1:51:22] power of life
[1:51:25] and the power of death
[1:51:28] ever here
[1:51:29] but when it comes to us
[1:51:31] he only have one option
[1:51:39] everybody clear
[1:51:40] why does he want to destroy
[1:51:43] why and how does he destroy
[1:51:46] in deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 24 the
[1:51:49] bible says for the lord that god is a
[1:51:52] consuming water
[1:51:55] so somebody will be born
[1:51:59] anybody
[1:52:00] even a jealous god
[1:52:03] hallelujah
[1:52:06] first king chapter 18 verse 38 then the
[1:52:10] fire of the lord fell
[1:52:13] let's see that consumption
[1:52:15] and consume consume what the burn
[1:52:18] sacrifice
[1:52:20] which is flesh
[1:52:22] and the wood
[1:52:23] which is burning the trees
[1:52:26] and the stone
[1:52:28] everybody and the dust that's why peter
[1:52:32] said the element of the earth will melt
[1:52:35] here and lick up the water
[1:52:38] that's why in the new jerusalem we won't
[1:52:41] have water
[1:52:44] here
[1:52:45] so this fire of god
[1:52:47] is a powerful fire
[1:52:50] it's a fire that can destroy the flesh
[1:52:53] and consume it
[1:52:55] it's a fire that can destroy the wood
[1:52:58] and consume completely
[1:53:00] make everything vanish
[1:53:02] it's a fire that can destroy even the
[1:53:05] stone
[1:53:06] and the dust
[1:53:07] and it can also leak water
[1:53:10] because normally if you put water in the
[1:53:12] fire
[1:53:13] the water will kill the fire but this
[1:53:16] one if you bring water it suck the water
[1:53:19] out
[1:53:20] and the water disappear
[1:53:22] anybody clear it is like the road of
[1:53:25] moses
[1:53:26] when moses throws his road down ever
[1:53:29] clear the road of moses have the ability
[1:53:32] to swallow the other two serpent
[1:53:36] and the other two serpents disappear and
[1:53:39] the only one remain was there
[1:53:42] ever here in other words another way the
[1:53:45] broad of moses seems to be the one that
[1:53:49] can generate the two roads
[1:53:54] do you follow me
[1:53:56] do you follow me
[1:53:57] if you are taking a camera and you are
[1:54:00] recording moses before pharaoh you're
[1:54:03] gonna see the two snake of janice and
[1:54:06] chambers being swallowed up
[1:54:09] do you follow me
[1:54:10] if you reward your tape you're going to
[1:54:13] see those two snakes coming out of one
[1:54:16] snake
[1:54:17] everybody
[1:54:18] so the snake of moses has a power to
[1:54:21] swallow up
[1:54:23] and yet it remain itself
[1:54:25] and if you search the other snake you
[1:54:27] don't see them anymore
[1:54:29] that's why moses have the power of
[1:54:32] creation
[1:54:36] everybody here
[1:54:37] the god of moses could bring a plague
[1:54:41] and he was also able to remove the
[1:54:44] plague
[1:54:45] and but here he can generate something
[1:54:49] and he can suck it out and make it
[1:54:50] disappear
[1:54:54] everybody clear
[1:54:56] this is meat
[1:54:57] amen
[1:54:58] matthew 10 say and feel not them which
[1:55:01] can kill the body but i'm not able to
[1:55:04] kill the soul we know them
[1:55:07] but rather feel him which is able to
[1:55:10] destroy
[1:55:11] both the soul and the
[1:55:14] body
[1:55:15] so if the soul the spiritual part of man
[1:55:20] everybody
[1:55:21] which is the soul combined with the
[1:55:24] spirit
[1:55:25] and the natural part of man
[1:55:28] which is the flesh or the body
[1:55:30] why does god want to destroy the flesh
[1:55:35] and the ba and the soul
[1:55:38] why
[1:55:39] what is the purpose
[1:55:40] amen
[1:55:41] because there are certain people where
[1:55:44] god can allow their body to be destroyed
[1:55:48] everybody here
[1:55:50] but the destruction of the soul goes
[1:55:53] after the destruction of the body
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:57] but instead of those people to be
[1:55:59] destroyed
[1:56:00] on the spiritual part god said no i'm
[1:56:03] going to raise them back up
[1:56:08] everybody
[1:56:10] in john chapter 3 verse 16 for god so
[1:56:13] loved the world
[1:56:15] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:56:18] that whosoever believes in him should
[1:56:21] not work
[1:56:23] but have eternal water can you destroy
[1:56:26] somebody that have eternal life
[1:56:28] so there is somebody that wants to
[1:56:31] contact god you they can never perish
[1:56:36] everybody
[1:56:37] they can have their first death
[1:56:40] but the devil will never push it to the
[1:56:42] next one
[1:56:44] hallelujah
[1:56:46] in john chapter 6 verse 34 and this is
[1:56:50] the father will what is the father world
[1:56:53] which has sent me that of all which he
[1:56:56] has given me
[1:56:57] i should lose water
[1:57:00] but you do what
[1:57:03] again in the
[1:57:04] last
[1:57:05] so instead of destroying somebody they
[1:57:08] are a certain group of people that god
[1:57:11] cannot destroy them
[1:57:16] amen god can allow them to be put to
[1:57:19] sleep under death
[1:57:21] but god is obligated to raise them back
[1:57:25] up again
[1:57:27] about here
[1:57:28] blessed be the name of the lord this is
[1:57:31] the will of him that sent me that
[1:57:33] everyone which sees the son
[1:57:36] and believe on him may have eternal life
[1:57:40] ever here and i will raise him up at the
[1:57:44] last day
[1:57:45] no man can come to me except the father
[1:57:48] which sent me joseph and i will raise
[1:57:51] him up at the water so there is a
[1:57:54] category even though you die
[1:57:57] you will never receive the destruction
[1:57:59] of the soul god will raise you back up
[1:58:02] but why does god want to destroy
[1:58:04] somebody else and want to keep the other
[1:58:06] one up
[1:58:08] anybody clear
[1:58:09] john chapter 11 verse 25 jesus said unto
[1:58:13] her i am the resurrection
[1:58:16] and the life
[1:58:18] he that believes in me
[1:58:20] though he will work
[1:58:22] yet shall do what i am the one who
[1:58:25] decide who to raise up
[1:58:28] i am the boss
[1:58:30] everybody here and whosoever liveth and
[1:58:33] believe in me shall never work
[1:58:36] believe that peace
[1:58:39] so if somebody believe on the lord jesus
[1:58:42] christ and receive eternal life that man
[1:58:45] will never die
[1:58:49] that's why christians don't die
[1:58:52] christians sleep
[1:58:58] here the resurrection to a christian is
[1:59:01] an awakening from sleep
[1:59:04] ever here
[1:59:06] that's why christians die
[1:59:09] easily
[1:59:10] because they are sleeping
[1:59:15] you don't sleep
[1:59:17] jumping out
[1:59:18] and you go to sleep no no no no no a
[1:59:21] christian goes to sleep peaceful
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:26] everybody
[1:59:28] so whosoever liveth and believe if it
[1:59:31] means shall never die so there are
[1:59:33] certain people that will never die
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:39] why do you want to destroy the soul
[1:59:41] revelation 2 11. now baccala pretty good
[1:59:45] he that has a knee
[1:59:47] let him hear what the spirit say unto
[1:59:49] the churches
[1:59:50] he that of the cometh
[1:59:53] shall not be heard of the water
[1:59:56] so there is a category of people in this
[2:00:00] planet earth
[2:00:01] that will never experience the second
[2:00:04] death
[2:00:05] and the one that will not experience the
[2:00:07] second death is the one that overcometh
[2:00:13] hallelujah
[2:00:14] [Music]
[2:00:15] blessed and holy is he that part in the
[2:00:20] first water
[2:00:21] remember i told you to understand the
[2:00:23] second death you need to understand
[2:00:25] resurrection and the origin anybody
[2:00:27] clear who who wears up in the first
[2:00:30] resurrection
[2:00:32] hallelujah
[2:00:33] on such
[2:00:35] the second death has no power
[2:00:39] but there shall be what
[2:00:41] of god and
[2:00:43] and shall reign with him and what
[2:00:46] who's going to reign a thousand year
[2:00:48] with the lord we already explain it to
[2:00:50] you it is the bride of jesus christ
[2:00:53] they are priests because he made us
[2:00:55] priests and what
[2:00:57] under the order of melchizedek
[2:01:00] ever here so whoever is part of the
[2:01:04] blood will never face the second death
[2:01:09] in other words your soul and your spirit
[2:01:12] cannot be destroyed
[2:01:14] god himself cannot destroy you
[2:01:20] because you came from god
[2:01:22] if god destroyed you he's destroying
[2:01:24] himself
[2:01:26] ever clear we were in the mind of god
[2:01:30] the reason why he has mercy on you
[2:01:32] because you are his son
[2:01:34] you have a representation in god
[2:01:38] and if god destroys you he destroys
[2:01:40] himself
[2:01:41] but god is eternal and you also you are
[2:01:45] eternal
[2:01:46] and eternal cannot be destroyed because
[2:01:50] you belong to god
[2:01:52] you shall never see the second death
[2:01:57] ever clear
[2:01:58] you don't have to worry about the second
[2:02:00] death
[2:02:02] because you are in christ
[2:02:07] in other words your soul that's why he
[2:02:09] said fear knows the one who can destroy
[2:02:12] your body
[2:02:13] but cannot touch this one
[2:02:16] ever here not the soul ever clear
[2:02:19] hallelujah
[2:02:21] revelation 21 and he said unto me it is
[2:02:25] done
[2:02:27] i am alpha and omega
[2:02:29] the beginning and the end
[2:02:31] i will give him i will give unto him
[2:02:35] that is a thirst of the fountain of the
[2:02:38] water of life howe
[2:02:44] put your car in neutral he that
[2:02:46] overcometh
[2:02:48] shall inherit how
[2:02:50] and i will be his
[2:02:53] and he shall be mine
[2:02:57] watch verse 8 but the fearful
[2:03:01] we cannot be afraid that's why brother
[2:03:03] branham said god cannot use coward
[2:03:06] they're fearful
[2:03:08] and the unbelieving
[2:03:10] and the abominable
[2:03:12] and the murderers like kane
[2:03:15] and the whole mongers
[2:03:18] and their sorcery
[2:03:19] and idolater and all water
[2:03:23] shall have their part in the lake which
[2:03:26] burneth with
[2:03:28] and brimstone which is the second
[2:03:31] so the category of people that are
[2:03:34] destroyed by the second death are those
[2:03:37] that are bad
[2:03:39] yet we also did things that were bad
[2:03:42] we also were in the world we were
[2:03:45] drinking smoking doing all kinds of
[2:03:48] stuff why is that one destroying you not
[2:03:51] destroyed
[2:04:00] in revelation 20 verse 11
[2:04:02] it is the great white throne buckle up
[2:04:05] and i saw a great one through white
[2:04:08] throne which is the throne of judgment
[2:04:12] all right and him that sat on him from
[2:04:15] whose face the earth and the heaven did
[2:04:18] what
[2:04:20] so his face went to heaven look at him
[2:04:23] they run away
[2:04:25] everybody here because he's coming
[2:04:29] as a church
[2:04:30] he's not playing game
[2:04:32] ever here and there was found no place
[2:04:35] for them
[2:04:36] and i saw the dead
[2:04:38] small and water
[2:04:40] if you notice at the white throne
[2:04:42] judgment
[2:04:44] the dead had different edges
[2:04:50] everybody clear at the rapture everybody
[2:04:54] have the same age
[2:04:57] when brother branham went to hell
[2:04:59] brother branham saw young people and old
[2:05:02] people but if you die in christ
[2:05:05] automatically you remain younger
[2:05:08] ever clear so this white throne judgment
[2:05:12] is not for you
[2:05:16] because he that believes on me
[2:05:21] you have passed from what death and to
[2:05:23] life you will never be charged again
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:30] everybody
[2:05:33] clear because your judgment he took it
[2:05:36] at the cross
[2:05:37] when he went at the cross he was judging
[2:05:40] your place
[2:05:42] here the punishment of you fell upon him
[2:05:45] and by his trap we are wiper
[2:05:48] you can never be judged again
[2:05:54] [Applause]
[2:05:56] hallelujah
[2:05:57] hallelujah
[2:05:59] do you know what you're going to do
[2:06:00] there
[2:06:05] do you know what you're gonna be doing
[2:06:07] there
[2:06:09] if god is eternal
[2:06:12] you are eternal
[2:06:14] everybody
[2:06:16] if god is god
[2:06:18] you are a child of god you are god
[2:06:21] everybody
[2:06:22] if god is a judge
[2:06:25] who are you going to be there
[2:06:35] the bible says there is only one judge
[2:06:38] but you gonna judge yourself
[2:06:43] going to be judges at the white throne
[2:06:46] judgment
[2:06:48] because the scripture says the saint
[2:06:50] will do what
[2:06:51] judge the earth
[2:06:54] you're not going to be judged but you're
[2:06:56] going to be the one doing the water
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:05] you don't know who you are
[2:07:07] you are the possessor of heaven and
[2:07:10] nothing
[2:07:10] you are gods
[2:07:13] you are deity
[2:07:18] you can send somebody to hell
[2:07:25] and you can also tell god not this one
[2:07:41] hallelujah
[2:07:43] hallelujah
[2:07:44] abraham wrestle with god
[2:07:47] and say not lord
[2:07:49] and the bible say god remember abraham
[2:07:55] not a lot
[2:08:00] hallelujah
[2:08:01] when the three
[2:08:03] when the three friend of job sinned
[2:08:06] god never told them ask me forgiveness
[2:08:10] he said go to job
[2:08:13] and let job pray for you and i'm gonna
[2:08:16] heal job
[2:08:21] if job don't pray for you i am going to
[2:08:24] destroy you
[2:08:25] i'll be malek when abraham lied
[2:08:30] [Applause]
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] abraham was in error
[2:08:36] god he said you know my integrity
[2:08:39] god said i know but go to that liar
[2:08:46] if he doesn't pray for you
[2:08:48] you are demon abraham have to pray to
[2:08:52] remove the wrath of god
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:58] hallelujah
[2:08:59] you don't know who you are
[2:09:03] you underestimate yourself too much

[2:09:09] look at the inside man
[2:09:12] it is god
[2:09:16] in blessing

[2:10:03] i don't know what time is it
[2:10:07] i'm even in i'm just in a quarter
[2:10:12] i saw the dead
[2:10:14] small and great
[2:10:16] stand before who
[2:10:18] so they were alive
[2:10:22] and the books were open
[2:10:24] and another book was open they want you
[2:10:28] to know particularly
[2:10:30] is a certain book
[2:10:32] which is the book of water
[2:10:35] and the dead were judged
[2:10:38] out of those things which were written
[2:10:40] in the water
[2:10:41] according to the water
[2:10:44] they were judged according to the works
[2:10:53] but the bible says
[2:10:56] god save you by grace
[2:10:58] so that it should not be by work
[2:11:02] so that nobody will do what
[2:11:05] so why is god judging by works now
[2:11:15] he said abraham not by works
[2:11:20] i am the one i saw by myself
[2:11:24] not you but in the white stone judgment
[2:11:27] he's looking at the work
[2:11:30] the work toward who
[2:11:35] [Applause]
[2:11:39] what they did to god
[2:11:42] what they were doing toward god
[2:11:46] which work
[2:11:47] is god looking at them
[2:11:50] [Music]
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:11:59] can i jump ahead

[2:12:32] but jesus said you are persecuting me
[2:12:38] when did you see paul whipping jesus
[2:12:41] christ
[2:12:42] paul was
[2:12:44] paul was persecuting somebody
[2:12:47] but when he touched that person he
[2:12:50] touched jesus christ
[2:12:56] in other words that person was jesus
[2:13:07] when paul was arresting believers
[2:13:10] he was arresting jesus christ
[2:13:22] they are judged by their works which
[2:13:24] works
[2:13:27] and the sea gave up the dead so some
[2:13:30] people died in the sea
[2:13:33] which were in there and the dead and
[2:13:35] death and hell
[2:13:37] the grave

[2:13:45] this is what i have
[2:13:47] everybody

[2:13:50] and they will judge every man according
[2:13:53] to the water
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:14:05] they were not judged
[2:14:08] like you were judged
[2:14:10] they were judged according to their
[2:14:13] works their words toward who
[2:14:18] because everybody goes to church
[2:14:20] this morning a lot of people are in
[2:14:22] churches
[2:14:24] everybody
[2:14:25] and being in churches they're going to
[2:14:27] go in hell
[2:14:29] the rich young ruler have all the law he
[2:14:32] was doing everything perfectly and he
[2:14:35] went to hell
[2:14:37] [Music]
[2:14:42] because when god was immortal in flesh
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:48] when he contacted god in flesh
[2:14:52] he gave god in flesh the back
[2:14:58] [Music]
[2:15:01] matthew 25
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:04] anybody clear
[2:15:07] what a place to worship god
[2:15:11] if you dare you can say amen
[2:15:13] verse 31 they were judged by water
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:22] why christian is faith
[2:15:26] you ready
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:30] verse
[2:15:32] 31.
[2:15:36] thank god i was looking at 24. amen
[2:15:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:15:43] when the son of man the word
[2:15:47] shall come in his glory and all all the
[2:15:50] holy angel with him
[2:15:52] then shall he sit upon though
[2:15:56] of his water
[2:15:57] which throne is it
[2:16:04] he's sitting there
[2:16:05] as a judge
[2:16:07] and before him
[2:16:09] shall we gather all nations
[2:16:12] everybody why because they see gave up
[2:16:16] the hell and death gave up because
[2:16:18] everything will be destroyed
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:21] everybody here everything will be
[2:16:23] destroyed in armageddon
[2:16:25] it will be only the ashes of the weekend
[2:16:28] now they're going to resurrect
[2:16:29] everything back all the nation before
[2:16:32] him before the white throne
[2:16:34] so how are you going to judge them
[2:16:38] amen
[2:16:40] hallelujah and their all nations gather
[2:16:44] and he shall separate them one from
[2:16:47] another
[2:16:48] as a shepherd which he is
[2:16:51] divide his sheep from the water
[2:16:54] so in this right judgment there will be
[2:16:58] two categories
[2:17:00] god will take the nation and split them
[2:17:04] who's gonna go to the right who's gonna
[2:17:06] go to the left
[2:17:09] everybody
[2:17:10] verse 33 and he shall say the sheep on
[2:17:15] his water
[2:17:17] and but they got underwater
[2:17:21] so you can see the two end of the zodiac
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:28] here
[2:17:29] it's it's a judge
[2:17:31] but the same judge
[2:17:35] the same problem
[2:17:40] can be the throne of judgment
[2:17:43] and the throne of water
[2:17:45] so on the right hand is mercy
[2:17:49] on the left hand is what
[2:17:51] on the right lame lamb over here liona
[2:17:57] [Music]
[2:18:00] anybody here
[2:18:03] why is he lamb on the right hand
[2:18:06] because he islam to jonah
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:13] when john look at him i'm lame
[2:18:17] john disappear i'm a lion but when he's
[2:18:20] on the white throne judgment john the
[2:18:22] bride is sitting with him
[2:18:25] when he look over there he turned his
[2:18:27] right hand
[2:18:29] into a lambo
[2:18:31] and hear a liona
[2:18:33] why is he turning into a lamb
[2:18:36] towards somebody who's not the bride
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:42] are you ready
[2:18:43] are you ready
[2:18:44] is everybody there
[2:18:46] okay
[2:18:47] 34 then shot the water
[2:18:50] remember our judge is our lord he is our
[2:18:54] king
[2:18:55] remember
[2:18:56] now the king said to them on his right
[2:18:59] hand
[2:19:01] come you
[2:19:02] blessed of my father
[2:19:04] inherit the kingdom prepare from you
[2:19:07] from the foundation of the water
[2:19:12] so the people in the right hand
[2:19:16] that are not part of the bride they also
[2:19:21] had a place before the foundation of the
[2:19:24] world brother kelly
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:30] it is just a different category
[2:19:32] [Music]
[2:19:34] make sense
[2:19:35] [Music]
[2:19:38] the bread has a place before the
[2:19:40] foundation of the world these people
[2:19:43] also have a place before the foundation
[2:19:45] of the world but they are not the bread
[2:19:47] because the bread is judging them
[2:19:57] when jesus went into heaven he sat at
[2:20:01] the right hand on left hand
[2:20:04] because the right hand symbolized the
[2:20:06] power
[2:20:07] and on the right hand is what
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:20] everybody
[2:20:21] then the king 34 say to them on his
[2:20:24] right hand come you blessed of my father
[2:20:27] inherit the kingdom prepare from you
[2:20:29] from be from the foundation of the world
[2:20:32] for hours water

[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:06] you say me and you met
[2:21:09] jesus said yes me and you men

[2:24:16] then shall the righteous answer him
[2:24:20] he's a righteous
[2:24:23] why did he miss the brother
[2:24:27] if he was watched why didn't he get into
[2:24:30] the blood
[2:24:34] what makes him righteous
[2:24:39] who declared him to be righteous
[2:24:44] why is god calling him righteous
[2:24:48] he is standing in judgment
[2:24:51] but he is not part of the brother
[2:24:54] who gave him that righteousness
[2:24:57] because if he took the righteousness of
[2:24:59] christ paul said the righteousness of
[2:25:02] christ in romans 1 is revealing the
[2:25:05] gospel
[2:25:08] but he is in the judgment
[2:25:11] who makes him righteous
[2:25:15] anybody clear
[2:25:18] lord
[2:25:20] then shall the righteous answer him
[2:25:22] saying lord when so were you hungry and
[2:25:27] fed you
[2:25:28] so they don't remember
[2:25:30] they don't have any face of off man
[2:25:33] ahead
[2:25:34] feeding them
[2:25:39] and you're thirsty and gave you drink
[2:25:42] when so were you a stranger and you took
[2:25:45] you and took you in
[2:25:46] or naked and clothed you
[2:25:49] and one saw you so when you seek and in
[2:25:53] prison and came to you verse 14 and the
[2:25:56] king shall answer and say to them
[2:25:58] verily i say unto you in as much as you
[2:26:02] have done it
[2:26:05] to run off the water
[2:26:08] of my home
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:30] keep your finger right there open
[2:26:32] everyone
[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:26:42] and i had more than this
[2:26:45] hebrew chapter one
[2:26:51] verse 8 you there
[2:26:54] and to the who
[2:26:56] to the son who's the son
[2:26:59] he says your true no god so that son is
[2:27:03] a god
[2:27:06] am i
[2:27:07] me and my father we are
[2:27:11] is forever and heaven a scepter of
[2:27:14] righteousness is the scepter of your
[2:27:16] kingdom
[2:27:18] you
[2:27:19] have loved righteousness
[2:27:21] and hated iniquity
[2:27:23] therefore god even your
[2:27:27] how many god do we have
[2:27:31] o
[2:27:33] has announced you
[2:27:36] with the oil of water
[2:27:39] above your water
[2:27:44] so jesus is not the only one
[2:27:47] he has brothers
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:52] i'm reading your scripture
[2:27:54] but jesus is just the top brother
[2:27:58] the big brother
[2:28:02] because we are joined here
[2:28:05] with him
[2:28:06] everybody here now let's go back to
[2:28:08] matthew 24
[2:28:10] 25 verse 40 and the king shall answer
[2:28:13] and say to them verily i say unto you in
[2:28:17] as much as you have done it to one of
[2:28:19] the least of these marijuana
[2:28:24] you know who the brethren is now
[2:28:26] [Music]
[2:28:29] so
[2:28:30] there is a difference
[2:28:34] when you say
[2:28:35] you have done in my brethren who live in
[2:28:38] charlotte
[2:28:42] everybody
[2:28:44] but if brother kalim is sitting with me
[2:28:46] right here
[2:28:47] when i'm talking to brother kalima and
[2:28:49] i'm talking to brother greg i'm saying
[2:28:51] brother greg i thank you so much for
[2:28:53] helping brother kalima
[2:28:56] amen

[2:29:04] so in this white room
[2:29:07] brother's wedding
[2:29:13] the bread is there
[2:29:15] and jesus is telling me what you did to
[2:29:19] this
[2:29:22] what you did to my wife
[2:29:27] you are doing that to who
[2:29:30] the way you treated my wife
[2:29:34] the way you treated my child
[2:29:37] the way you treated my brother and my
[2:29:40] little sister
[2:29:41] you were actually treating me
[2:29:47] and because you treat them right
[2:29:51] when i was discussing with you
[2:29:54] they were whispering in my
[2:29:59] [Applause]
[2:30:02] ear are you there when i saw you
[2:30:06] she went to my ear
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:15] are you there
[2:30:29] [Applause]
[2:30:30] when i went to that department everybody
[2:30:33] treated me bad that day
[2:30:35] and this woman came up and said what is
[2:30:38] wrong come here let me help you sit down
[2:30:41] what can i do for you ma'am next time
[2:30:43] when you come call me i will help you
[2:30:46] this is health
[2:30:52] are you there they never receive the
[2:30:55] gospel
[2:31:02] they never received the message of the
[2:31:04] hour
[2:31:06] everybody
[2:31:07] but they respected the message in flesh
[2:31:15] and when they were respecting the
[2:31:17] message in flesh
[2:31:20] the message began to talk back to god
[2:31:23] like this one man
[2:31:26] was nice to me
[2:31:31] when they wanna fire me that supervisor
[2:31:34] say no
[2:31:36] she said i notice you a good young
[2:31:39] sister
[2:31:40] there's something special about you
[2:31:42] they're not gonna fire you i'm gonna
[2:31:43] talk to the boss
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:48] so the way somebody treats you in this
[2:31:51] life
[2:31:53] it will determine it is showing up their
[2:31:56] origin
[2:31:58] [Applause]
[2:32:05] here
[2:32:08] doesn't persecute elect
[2:32:13] somebody who came from god
[2:32:15] even though he's not part of the brother
[2:32:19] he will behave differently
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:31] hallelujah
[2:32:33] and one of the male factors
[2:32:38] one of the good church member
[2:32:42] one of the preacher
[2:32:47] one of the holy sisters in our
[2:32:49] neighborhood
[2:32:53] a thief
[2:32:55] a manufacturer which were water
[2:33:00] that's why brother branham say judah
[2:33:02] hanging himself is a cross
[2:33:10] and saying if that be christ saved us
[2:33:13] helping us
[2:33:14] mocking him
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:17] but
[2:33:18] on the other
[2:33:20] answering rebuke him
[2:33:24] saying does not that feel who
[2:33:28] he was talking to who
[2:33:34] he didn't know god was ready
[2:33:44] sitting down in the same condemnation
[2:33:48] there is something
[2:33:50] about a child or a seed that came from
[2:33:55] god
[2:33:56] that recognized error
[2:33:59] even though they are in arrow something
[2:34:02] is still just to them
[2:34:09] hallelujah
[2:34:11] and we indeed justly
[2:34:14] for we have received the do what
[2:34:17] of our water
[2:34:18] so what work did they have
[2:34:23] bad works
[2:34:24] everything they done was bad
[2:34:29] how can somebody 100 bad
[2:34:32] sleep to heaven
[2:34:35] [Music]
[2:34:40] but this who
[2:34:42] has done what
[2:34:47] all he said is we did good i don't even
[2:34:51] know this man but this man done what
[2:34:55] but the pharisees were crucifying him
[2:34:59] but this fifth had enough says to sit
[2:35:03] down and watch and say the way they're
[2:35:06] treating this man is now right
[2:35:09] even though the pharisees are saying
[2:35:11] he's a bad man but this man did what
[2:35:17] just saying that
[2:35:19] in his sin
[2:35:22] [Applause]
[2:35:25] and he said unto him
[2:35:28] lord
[2:35:29] who told him he was lord
