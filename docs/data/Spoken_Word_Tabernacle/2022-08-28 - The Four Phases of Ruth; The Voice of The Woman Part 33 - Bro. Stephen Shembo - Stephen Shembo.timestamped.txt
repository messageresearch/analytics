[51:08] we want to be one we want to be united
[51:11] and this is the way we're going to be in
[51:12] heaven amen so this church is not an
[51:15] african church or an american church or
[51:18] a european church this is the church of
[51:20] the living god
[51:21] amen so when we have baby shower we do
[51:24] it for everybody
[51:26] amen whether you're not gonna get
[51:28] married again remember you need to
[51:30] support one another and especially the
[51:32] young folks remember to be there because
[51:35] i don't want you to complain
[51:37] on your time when somebody doesn't show

[51:51] musician in this church
[51:54] i want you to stay for a few minutes
[51:56] after service i wanted to talk to you
[51:58] whether you play the organ the drum
[52:01] whatever you do in this church if you're
[52:03] a church worker you work on a computer
[52:05] or something i want you i want you to
[52:07] stay in here if you biking the song or
[52:10] whatever you do in a translation or on a
[52:12] computer you stay here i want to talk to
[52:14] you probably like 10 minutes or less to
[52:17] the most amen i want you i want
[52:20] everybody to be on the same page
[52:22] amen
[52:24] this is not something i'm not separated
[52:26] from the music
[52:28] the music is working together with me i
[52:30] am not separating from the computer the
[52:33] man on the computer is projecting slides
[52:35] so we gotta stay on the same spirit on
[52:37] the computer same spirit at the beacon
[52:40] same spirit in the trustee same spirit
[52:42] over there on the keyboard and backing
[52:44] up in other words we are in the very big
[52:48] battlefield
[52:50] amen if you think this is just something
[52:52] you come and play and you go home this
[52:55] is not the case you don't understand you
[52:57] can get
[52:59] you can get hurt quickly
[53:01] amen you don't know what i go through i
[53:04] have more fight than probably what you
[53:06] have
[53:07] for me to be standing here you don't
[53:09] know how many battle i'm going through
[53:11] amen i don't have time to disclose that
[53:13] to let you know because some of you can
[53:15] handle it but i know who called me and
[53:17] placed me here so that's why i'm moving
[53:20] amen but i want everybody to be on the
[53:23] same page we are under the same
[53:25] expectation and we know what we're doing
[53:28] so the next time i'm coming to you
[53:31] don't think it's something personal
[53:33] between me and you
[53:35] it is something that i'm trying to show
[53:37] you that you're not operating the way we
[53:39] are supposed to be amen and if you feel
[53:42] like you are struggling or something is
[53:44] going on
[53:45] something is going on in your life i
[53:47] would rather you sit down
[53:49] because you can get hurt
[53:51] and i'm trying the best to protect you

[53:57] i know what i'm talking about
[53:59] amen there is no way we can unfold the
[54:02] devil like this and the devil being calm
[54:04] so don't think i'm the only one
[54:06] receiving the attack everybody that is
[54:08] participating in the service to make the
[54:11] service better
[54:13] just be on your guard because the devil
[54:16] either he's going to try me if he
[54:17] doesn't charge me he's going to search
[54:19] for someone else or go back and forth
[54:21] trying to see where he can disturb amen
[54:24] so we want you to stay spiritual
[54:26] amen if you're not spiritual you're not
[54:29] where you're supposed to be stay where
[54:31] you are don't get hurt here

[55:02] question come and ask me
[55:05] that's the way i want to operate in this
[55:07] church i really appreciate a brother who

[55:11] question about this this this i know to

[59:04] genesis chapter 2 verse 15
[59:08] glory to god
[59:09] if you're there you can say amen
[59:17] sometimes the things we are we are
[59:19] holding on is very unnecessary
[59:23] and it keeps causing you trouble
[59:26] are you just stubborn about something
[59:28] that is unnecessary
[59:30] stop doing this you know listen stop
[59:31] doing this you're doing this and we keep
[59:32] talking about stop doing this
[59:34] it's nothing
[59:36] get it off and then we get off you
[59:41] it's okay
[59:42] [Music]
[59:45] and the lord god took the man
[59:49] and put him into the garden of eden
[59:52] to dress it and to keep it you might be
[59:55] seated
[59:56] i will see how far we can go
[59:59] you're there
[1:00:01] and the lord god commanded the man he
[1:00:04] didn't command the woman
[1:00:07] i want you to stay alert
[1:00:09] he didn't command a woman god is talking
[1:00:12] to adam he's not talking to eve
[1:00:15] anybody okay when i say the woman here
[1:00:17] i'm talking about eve but here she's not
[1:00:19] eve yet eve came later
[1:00:22] and he commanded the man saying
[1:00:25] of every tree
[1:00:27] of the garden you may freely eat amen
[1:00:31] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:00:34] and evil you shall not eat
[1:00:37] he didn't say touch there you remember
[1:00:39] you shall not eat of it for in the day
[1:00:42] that you eat thereof you shall surely
[1:00:46] die
[1:00:46] everybody okay
[1:00:48] so god
[1:00:50] gave his commandment to adam
[1:00:54] everybody okay this commandment was with
[1:00:57] god
[1:00:59] god open up
[1:01:01] and unfold that commandment and deliver
[1:01:04] it to adam
[1:01:05] now that commandment is no longer with
[1:01:07] god
[1:01:09] everybody okay it belongs to adam
[1:01:12] because what is now revealed belongs to
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:15] you know that deuteronomy 29 29 wants it
[1:01:18] to reveal he doesn't belong to god
[1:01:20] anymore
[1:01:21] amen it belongs to her it belongs to you
[1:01:24] that's the reason why when the book was
[1:01:26] open when the seal were broken god could
[1:01:29] not hold the book anymore because it
[1:01:31] doesn't belong to him anymore he already
[1:01:34] opened the book
[1:01:35] he doesn't belong to him he need now to
[1:01:37] return the book back to man
[1:01:40] are we okay
[1:01:42] are we okay
[1:01:44] are you still thinking about your
[1:01:45] meeting after service put the meeting
[1:01:49] put it outside
[1:01:50] okay stop thinking about what is the
[1:01:52] pastor about after service forget about
[1:01:54] it let's focus on this yes sir
[1:01:58] okay
[1:01:59] leave that meeting alone
[1:02:04] everybody okay
[1:02:08] so the word of god
[1:02:12] or the voice of god
[1:02:15] was given to adam
[1:02:18] and adam only everybody okay verse 18
[1:02:22] and the lord god say
[1:02:24] it is not good
[1:02:26] that the man should be water
[1:02:28] you remember on wednesday i will make
[1:02:30] him a water a help meet for him
[1:02:34] in other words eve was not there
[1:02:36] that's what i want to point out he was
[1:02:38] giving only to adam not eve
[1:02:42] everybody okay
[1:02:43] so the word of god moved from god
[1:02:46] the word from christ
[1:02:48] amen into adam
[1:02:51] number one or zero it was god and number
[1:02:54] two the word move now it's an one who is
[1:02:57] adam
[1:02:58] we okay
[1:03:00] go to genesis chapter 3.
[1:03:15] you there you can say amen
[1:03:18] verse 1 and the serpent was more subtle
[1:03:22] than any beast of the field which the
[1:03:24] lord god had made
[1:03:27] and he said to the woman not to eve
[1:03:30] everybody okay now the woman is already
[1:03:32] created she's pulled out from adam
[1:03:35] everybody okay
[1:03:36] he spoke to the woman he said to the
[1:03:38] woman
[1:03:39] yeah has god say you shall not eat of
[1:03:42] every tree of the garden amen
[1:03:46] and the woman said to the serpent
[1:03:49] we may eat of the fruit
[1:03:52] of the trees
[1:03:54] of of the garden trees plural but of the
[1:03:59] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:04:01] of the garden you remember that
[1:04:04] god has said
[1:04:05] you shall not eat
[1:04:08] who said
[1:04:09] did god speak to eve
[1:04:12] where did she learn it
[1:04:14] everybody okay
[1:04:16] god say
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:19] if he's speaking like god told her
[1:04:23] [Music]
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:35] i'm still reading the same bible if
[1:04:37] never say adam told me that god say
[1:04:41] no no no no no when adam speak
[1:04:45] it is god speaking
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:54] are you okay
[1:04:56] when adam spoke he was god
[1:05:01] god told moses i'm gonna make you god
[1:05:14] did you see anybody worshiping moses
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:27] god has said
[1:05:30] you shall not eat of it
[1:05:33] neither shall you what
[1:05:35] lest you do water
[1:05:37] did god speak to eve
[1:05:39] so the word somehow
[1:05:42] left adam
[1:05:45] everybody okay
[1:05:46] and went into the woman
[1:05:51] everybody care
[1:05:52] in the beginning adam was the voice of
[1:05:56] god
[1:06:01] are we okay
[1:06:02] are we okay in the beginning if you want
[1:06:05] to know what did god say
[1:06:08] you need to go to adam
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:12] in other words adam at the beginning was
[1:06:14] god's mouth peace
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:19] to his wife
[1:06:21] to the church
[1:06:23] because a woman is a church so adam was
[1:06:26] the most piece of god
[1:06:28] anybody care
[1:06:30] everybody okay but once adam delivered
[1:06:34] the word to evil
[1:06:37] everybody here
[1:06:38] if you become the mouthpiece of god
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:48] everybody okay
[1:06:50] eve now is the peace of god
[1:06:53] amen eve is talking to the serpent like
[1:06:56] she was talking to god
[1:07:00] everybody okay so the voice was no
[1:07:02] longer with god
[1:07:05] he was now with eve
[1:07:08] so the voice moved from god to adam and
[1:07:11] from adam to eve
[1:07:16] everybody okay
[1:07:19] it's the order of god
[1:07:23] amen
[1:07:24] order of god
[1:07:25] easy
[1:07:26] amen you can take adam off
[1:07:30] it's no problem
[1:07:32] because adam already delivered the void
[1:07:37] anybody okay
[1:07:39] you can take brother branham off
[1:07:43] it's too late
[1:07:45] the message has been delivered
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:55] all that you need to do is hold on to
[1:07:58] the message
[1:08:00] hold on to the word
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:10] the message say eat everything
[1:08:14] except
[1:08:15] one tree
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:17] so the message has one warning
[1:08:20] it was warning against the only bad
[1:08:23] thing that was in eden
[1:08:26] everybody okay
[1:08:28] everybody okay god didn't he give no
[1:08:30] more detail that's enough
[1:08:32] as long as you hold on to that message
[1:08:35] amen the evil that is in need and won't
[1:08:38] do anything
[1:08:40] if you just keep the word
[1:08:43] amen you will never touch off the tree
[1:08:45] of evil good and evil
[1:08:49] [Music]
[1:08:51] everybody okay
[1:08:53] god never told eve to worry about job
[1:08:57] or to worry about david
[1:09:03] amen god gave her a message for the
[1:09:06] present time for the evil of the present
[1:09:10] time
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:12] for the present day evil
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:20] message was not concerning cain
[1:09:23] he was concerning the tree because the
[1:09:26] devil became the truth
[1:09:28] of good and evil
[1:09:30] so god gave a specific message
[1:09:34] for the specific time
[1:09:36] to handle the devil in his specific
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:46] aspect did job have to deal with the
[1:09:49] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:09:52] so job message won't work there
[1:09:57] the message of david won't work there
[1:10:01] amen so in other words when god give a
[1:10:04] message
[1:10:05] god give a message
[1:10:07] related to the evil of the day
[1:10:14] it's a prescription
[1:10:16] that is specific
[1:10:18] for a certain german or a certain
[1:10:21] disease
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:26] amen if it's a zitro
[1:10:30] you cannot use a multi-ceilin
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:40] glory to god
[1:10:41] where am i at
[1:10:45] let's jump to verse 4
[1:10:46] hallelujah amen
[1:10:49] and the serpent say to the woman
[1:10:52] you shall not surely die you remember
[1:10:55] this in question and answer and
[1:10:56] everything amen
[1:10:58] for god
[1:10:59] does know
[1:11:01] that in the day you eat thereof
[1:11:04] then your eyes
[1:11:06] shall be opened last of the eyes
[1:11:09] and you shall be as god knowing good and
[1:11:12] evil
[1:11:13] and when the woman saw the last of the
[1:11:16] eyes
[1:11:17] that the tree was good for food
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] who made her see that he was good for
[1:11:22] food
[1:11:24] the serpent
[1:11:25] amen
[1:11:26] in other words the eve begin to leave
[1:11:28] the voice of god
[1:11:32] and she took another voice
[1:11:34] [Music]
[1:11:37] here so after the conversation
[1:11:40] between even the serpent
[1:11:43] if swap voices
[1:11:48] if swap messages
[1:11:54] anybody okay
[1:11:55] praise god
[1:11:58] that he was pleasant to the eyes
[1:12:00] and a tree to be desired
[1:12:03] to make one wise proud
[1:12:06] she took off the fruit thereof and she
[1:12:08] did what
[1:12:09] and gave also to
[1:12:12] stop
[1:12:13] who gave the word of god
[1:12:15] unto adam
[1:12:18] and who gave eve the word of god
[1:12:21] okay now we have two person here we have
[1:12:25] a man called the devil
[1:12:28] all of this i didn't plan on that they

[1:12:49] he gave his word to the serpent
[1:12:53] anybody care
[1:12:54] now zero to one
[1:12:57] so the serpent becomes the mouthpiece
[1:13:03] of satan
[1:13:04] because the one who was speaking in the
[1:13:06] serpent
[1:13:08] was not the serpent he was the devil in
[1:13:10] the serpent that's why the bible said
[1:13:13] the old serpent which is the devil
[1:13:16] everybody okay
[1:13:18] everybody okay
[1:13:20] praise god now the devil into the
[1:13:24] serpent
[1:13:25] and the serpent took the voice of the
[1:13:28] devil
[1:13:30] and delivered to her
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:38] so the woman become the mouthpiece
[1:13:43] of the devil
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:50] here
[1:13:51] adam gave the woman
[1:13:53] the word of god
[1:13:55] or the voice of god
[1:13:57] but the woman gave adam the voice of the
[1:14:00] serpent
[1:14:05] everybody okay
[1:14:06] praise god let's go to verse 8 so she
[1:14:10] took it is eve

[1:14:40] the angel knows what to do
[1:14:43] god never told adam when you will have a
[1:14:46] wife teacher

[1:14:53] anybody okay
[1:14:55] anybody okay the devil also took his
[1:14:57] word and gave to his agent

[1:15:34] to adam
[1:15:35] the devil
[1:15:37] didn't give adam the tree of life
[1:15:40] the tree of death
[1:15:41] [Music]

[1:18:26] coming from the devil so normally adam
[1:18:29] should say the devil gave it to me let's
[1:18:31] see how adam is answering
[1:18:34] it's the same scripture over it's a
[1:18:35] layer we just peel the first with now i
[1:18:38] don't know which layer we are done amen
[1:18:41] verse 11 and he say who told you that
[1:18:44] you were naked have you eaten off the

[1:34:19] for uh

[1:34:23] let's pray heavenly father
[1:34:25] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:34:28] this morning father thanking you for
[1:34:30] your grace for your love your mercy and
[1:34:33] for everything you have been doing for

[1:34:37] unto the hand we thank you for your
[1:34:39] presence lord father may you move me
[1:34:41] completely out of the way may you come
[1:34:44] and speak to your children father be the
[1:34:46] alpha and the omega the beginning and
[1:34:48] the end of this service lord we commit
[1:34:50] everything unto the hand we seal the
[1:34:52] devil and his army away from this place
[1:34:56] in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:58] amen
[1:34:59] my subject this morning is the four
[1:35:03] phases of ruth
[1:35:04] the voice of the woman
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:10] everybody okay
[1:35:11] the voice of the woman we touch this on
[1:35:15] surface in a hotel
[1:35:17] but let's see how deep we can get here
[1:35:21] in our subject with roof we are still in
[1:35:23] the trashing floor
[1:35:25] because roof is no longer under the
[1:35:27] candlestick
[1:35:28] she is now in the trashing floor where
[1:35:30] she got the word reveal with her with
[1:35:33] six measure of barley amen
[1:35:35] the light of the candlestick could not
[1:35:38] give her the sixth measure of barley it
[1:35:40] takes another oil
[1:35:42] into the threshing floor to unfold the
[1:35:45] six seals
[1:35:46] everybody okay and from there we
[1:35:48] connected with the with the parable of
[1:35:52] the 10th virgin where we are dealing not
[1:35:54] with the first oil of the candlestick of
[1:35:57] the lamp but we're dealing with the
[1:35:59] second oil that has been reserved over
[1:36:01] there
[1:36:02] in our tabernacle teaching we are very
[1:36:05] very very deep
[1:36:08] into the holiest how
[1:36:11] can the holiest
[1:36:13] be connected with the trail of the
[1:36:15] serpent
[1:36:18] because we were dealing with roof and we
[1:36:20] say in the holiest this is where you
[1:36:23] receive the holy ghost
[1:36:24] and we left that path and it seems like
[1:36:27] we went to the virgin we talk about the
[1:36:29] oil which is the holy spirit but we left
[1:36:31] that virgin and now we find ourselves
[1:36:33] talking about the beast
[1:36:36] amen what is the connection between the
[1:36:39] holiest
[1:36:40] and the beasts that we're talking about
[1:36:43] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[1:36:45] at the end
[1:36:46] amen when if was created when the woman
[1:36:50] was created in the garden of eden the
[1:36:53] woman was virgin
[1:36:56] anybody okay
[1:36:58] the woman was pure
[1:37:00] both adam and eve could look at each
[1:37:03] other
[1:37:05] and they were not ashamed
[1:37:08] in other words they never realized that
[1:37:10] they were naked
[1:37:13] anybody here in other words the
[1:37:15] conscience of sin
[1:37:17] i have the quote the conscience of
[1:37:20] nakedness was locked by god
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:26] and the one who unlocked
[1:37:29] the conscience of sin to human being
[1:37:33] is
[1:37:34] evil
[1:37:36] amen
[1:37:38] amen
[1:37:39] everybody okay
[1:37:41] if by eating
[1:37:43] the fruit
[1:37:45] anybody care
[1:37:47] unlock
[1:37:49] the corner nature
[1:37:53] you can check that one amen
[1:37:55] that corner nature was not working at
[1:37:58] all
[1:38:00] he was there but he was locked
[1:38:03] by the holy veil of god amen so eve
[1:38:07] going and eating the fruit if actually
[1:38:11] unlock the sinful nature because what if
[1:38:15] did is did it by sex
[1:38:21] anybody okay
[1:38:22] that's why the bible says we were born
[1:38:26] and shared in iniquity
[1:38:29] amen coming into the world speaking
[1:38:31] water the reason why you are shaping
[1:38:34] iniquity because the way you came you
[1:38:36] came by sex
[1:38:38] it is the sex act that loads you with
[1:38:42] the carnal nature
[1:38:46] everybody here sin didn't start here
[1:38:53] everybody okay
[1:38:54] everybody okay that's why job say a man
[1:38:57] that is born of a woman
[1:39:00] is of water
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] because the man is born of a woman
[1:39:08] it's a trouble
[1:39:09] about here
[1:39:11] and god is coming into the holiest
[1:39:14] to purge that karma nature
[1:39:18] to purge the snake
[1:39:22] to purge the snake
[1:39:25] to purge the serpent
[1:39:27] from your soul
[1:39:29] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:39:35] when the fire of god come he purges in
[1:39:38] removing the snake from both of you
[1:39:42] that's why for you to understand the
[1:39:44] baptism of the holy ghost why you need
[1:39:47] it you need to understand where sin
[1:39:49] started
[1:39:51] everybody okay so far
[1:39:54] as we move on into our subject this
[1:39:58] morning we were in the parable of the
[1:40:01] 10th virgin
[1:40:03] we found out that the women that left
[1:40:06] going to the uh uh to the husband or the
[1:40:09] bridegroom all of them were virgin
[1:40:13] everybody okay
[1:40:14] and five of them
[1:40:16] lost
[1:40:18] and five entered
[1:40:19] and the five the entire were also virgin
[1:40:23] anybody here so in the beginning we're
[1:40:26] dealing with virgin
[1:40:28] everybody okay at the end we're dealing
[1:40:31] with virgin
[1:40:33] the problem is what happened in between
[1:40:37] everybody okay because paul was afraid
[1:40:41] and paul was afraid because paul did
[1:40:44] everything that he can
[1:40:46] he said i am jealous over you
[1:40:49] with godly jealousy for why i have
[1:40:52] inspired you
[1:40:54] to one husband
[1:40:55] so paul was not the husband
[1:41:00] amen
[1:41:01] paul was the messenger of the husband
[1:41:06] everybody okay
[1:41:08] and paul say the reason why i'm jealous
[1:41:11] i want to present you
[1:41:13] as a chest water
[1:41:15] to christ who is the husband but paul
[1:41:18] said i feel
[1:41:20] less by any means as the
[1:41:24] not the snake
[1:41:28] anybody okay
[1:41:29] not the snake as the serpent began eve
[1:41:33] through water
[1:41:34] so the fear of power was deceptivity of
[1:41:38] the serpent
[1:41:42] anybody okay
[1:41:43] because we found out that the subunity
[1:41:48] is the software
[1:41:54] we okay
[1:41:55] it is the mind
[1:41:58] anybody okay
[1:41:59] it is the perverted wisdom
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:06] that satan uses
[1:42:08] to destroy a virgin
[1:42:13] everybody okay
[1:42:14] the serpent use it to destroy eve
[1:42:19] jonathan used it to destroy temer
[1:42:23] everybody okay and the harlot in
[1:42:25] proverbs 7
[1:42:27] use it to destroy the young man and the
[1:42:30] young man was also void of understanding
[1:42:33] he was a naive young man
[1:42:36] so subtlety is the software that the
[1:42:40] devil uses to destroy someone
[1:42:45] everybody okay
[1:42:46] once that
[1:42:48] that
[1:42:49] software is turned on
[1:42:54] everybody okay
[1:42:55] that software opened three gates
[1:43:02] are we okay
[1:43:03] the last of the eyes
[1:43:06] we okay the last of the flesh everybody
[1:43:10] care
[1:43:11] and the water
[1:43:13] brother branham say all of this were
[1:43:15] given in eden
[1:43:16] everybody here and we found out that
[1:43:18] when jesus came
[1:43:20] when the devil attacked jesus he opened
[1:43:24] the same software
[1:43:28] but you remember the quote brother
[1:43:30] branham said he uses three major assault
[1:43:33] on jesus christ the same as he did for
[1:43:36] israel
[1:43:38] because he told jesus if you be the son
[1:43:40] of god
[1:43:41] turn this what stone into a water
[1:43:44] because jesus was hungry the last of the
[1:43:47] flesh
[1:43:49] everybody okay
[1:43:50] he told jesus i'm going to show you all
[1:43:53] the kingdom
[1:43:54] everybody here if you look at all this
[1:43:56] kingdom if you worship me i'm going to
[1:43:59] give you all of them and he showed jesus
[1:44:01] every kingdom
[1:44:03] the last of the
[1:44:05] anybody okay
[1:44:06] he took jesus at the temple and told him
[1:44:09] you go there jump brother branham said
[1:44:11] he did it so everybody can see jesus
[1:44:14] jumping and not dying
[1:44:16] he took him by the pride of the life
[1:44:18] amen and the way jesus overcome
[1:44:23] everybody okay he never use any gift
[1:44:29] anybody okay
[1:44:30] jesus didn't use any kind of thing jesus
[1:44:33] just used the word
[1:44:37] and the word alone it is written
[1:44:40] it is written it is written showing that
[1:44:44] if you get if you stick with the word
[1:44:49] anybody okay
[1:44:50] there is nothing that the devil will do
[1:44:52] to you
[1:44:53] if eve would have stuck with the world
[1:44:58] nothing would have happened to eve
[1:45:01] everybody okay so far
[1:45:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:45:05] now brother branham says this
[1:45:09] that we have the beast at the beginning
[1:45:12] everybody okay clear here
[1:45:14] we have the beast at the beginning
[1:45:17] and we also have the beast at the end
[1:45:22] if you miss it i'm just catching you up
[1:45:25] at the beginning
[1:45:26] brother bottom say it's a serpent
[1:45:30] in the garden of eden
[1:45:32] amen
[1:45:33] as we follow his track
[1:45:35] his trail at the end
[1:45:38] brother branham said it is two things
[1:45:41] it is a religious
[1:45:43] man
[1:45:44] and also
[1:45:45] it is a
[1:45:47] denomination which is a woman
[1:45:51] a denomination which is a woman
[1:45:53] and this denomination
[1:45:56] makes also denomination
[1:46:01] israel
[1:46:03] everybody okay brother branham said the
[1:46:06] beast from the beginning he was the best
[1:46:09] at the garden of eden
[1:46:10] he's the beast at the end he shows that
[1:46:13] he is a religious person and a
[1:46:16] denomination that made their
[1:46:18] denomination and come right through the
[1:46:21] trail of it and the reason why we were
[1:46:23] going in the beginning we showed you on
[1:46:25] wednesday that god declared the end from
[1:46:29] the beginning
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:33] amen so when god is talking at the
[1:46:36] beginning he's already telling you over
[1:46:38] there amen and for you to understand the
[1:46:42] end better
[1:46:44] you need to go back to the beginning
[1:46:47] and once you understand the beginning
[1:46:49] everything in the end will match up
[1:46:51] perfectly
[1:46:52] everybody okay why because god from
[1:46:55] ancient time the things that are not yet
[1:46:58] done
[1:46:59] my cancer shall stand and i will do my
[1:47:01] pleasure you go to marriage and divorce
[1:47:03] everything he does is for his pleasure
[1:47:06] everybody okay so far blessed be the
[1:47:08] name of your lord
[1:47:10] brother branham say that this great
[1:47:13] first battle that was ever thought
[1:47:16] begin in heaven
[1:47:23] everybody okay
[1:47:24] he began in heaven when michael and his
[1:47:28] angel fought
[1:47:29] against lucifer and his angel
[1:47:32] he first started the first battle was in
[1:47:36] heaven
[1:47:37] so sin
[1:47:39] did not originate on earth
[1:47:43] anybody care that's why when god created
[1:47:46] adam god came and gave him a protection
[1:47:49] because sin already started from heaven
[1:47:51] anybody okay
[1:47:53] sin originated not in heaven but sin did
[1:47:57] not originate on the earth it originated
[1:48:00] i'm sorry in heaven
[1:48:01] and then he was thrown down from heaven
[1:48:05] cast out of heaven to the water
[1:48:08] so whatever happened in heaven here
[1:48:12] between the bus
[1:48:14] between the president
[1:48:16] and the first president
[1:48:18] was transferred to the earth
[1:48:21] amen
[1:48:22] and in fair in the garden of eden that's
[1:48:25] the reason why
[1:48:27] ezekiel say that the devil was in the
[1:48:30] garden of eden
[1:48:31] you remember ezekiel 28
[1:48:34] brother branham say when he was cast
[1:48:36] down he fell on human beings
[1:48:39] then the batter from angel
[1:48:42] became water
[1:48:44] and satan came to destroy god's creation
[1:48:47] what god has created to him to to be for
[1:48:50] himself
[1:48:52] he had set and come to destroy this
[1:48:54] that is what his purpose was was to
[1:48:57] destroy them then the battle begin here
[1:49:00] on earth and begin in us and has been
[1:49:03] raging ever since
[1:49:05] so when the brother left heaven
[1:49:08] he came on the earth
[1:49:10] god used adam the president of the earth
[1:49:14] and the devil is also the vice president
[1:49:16] of the earth you remember
[1:49:18] the devil so the battle began to rage
[1:49:21] right here
[1:49:23] everybody okay but we know that adam was
[1:49:26] locked
[1:49:28] everybody here the devil didn't have any
[1:49:31] soul and the only person that had sold
[1:49:34] was a woman
[1:49:35] ever here and the devil went through the
[1:49:38] woman
[1:49:39] and made her swap veil
[1:49:44] because the veil that is head that she
[1:49:47] can look through adam and doesn't see
[1:49:49] anything that veil was a holy veil
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] eve could look at adam and doesn't have
[1:49:57] any lust
[1:49:58] and adam could look at eve and doesn't
[1:50:01] have any lust
[1:50:03] everybody okay so far but that veil was
[1:50:06] changed from a holy veil
[1:50:09] into a last veil
[1:50:12] amen
[1:50:13] he was changed from something holy into
[1:50:17] something that is filthy
[1:50:27] we noticed that
[1:50:28] the soul that the devil was looking is
[1:50:31] something that is very precious
[1:50:34] yes
[1:50:36] the bible says what is the man
[1:50:39] prophetic if he shall gain the water
[1:50:43] and lose his water
[1:50:44] so there is a possibility for you to
[1:50:48] gain everything
[1:50:50] and lose your soul
[1:50:55] you can even gain the whole world
[1:50:57] it's a possibility
[1:50:59] but you're gonna lose your soul
[1:51:03] that's why brother branham say just
[1:51:06] because they prosper
[1:51:09] that is where we make a mistake
[1:51:12] prosperity
[1:51:14] is no sign
[1:51:16] of spiritual blessing
[1:51:20] everybody okay
[1:51:21] that's right not a bit it is it
[1:51:24] prosperity sometimes is water
[1:51:28] if your prosperity is blocking you from
[1:51:31] defense of god your prosperity is not a
[1:51:35] blessing it's a curse
[1:51:42] you hear people i'm not going to church
[1:51:45] but i'm doing better in business i'm not
[1:51:48] going to church but i'm prospering
[1:51:50] everything is good the lord gave me a
[1:51:52] new job the lord gave me a new position
[1:51:55] but look at your position what is your
[1:51:58] politician in relationship to your
[1:52:00] spirituality
[1:52:02] if you are growing into the world but
[1:52:05] you are decreasing into your church your
[1:52:07] christian life you're going the wrong
[1:52:09] route
[1:52:12] amen i don't care how much you are
[1:52:14] accumulating i don't care how much you
[1:52:17] are buying i don't care how much you are
[1:52:19] prospering if your prosperity is keeping
[1:52:23] you aware from god away from the church
[1:52:26] away from the service away from question
[1:52:29] and answer away from a prayer life your
[1:52:32] prosperity is a hinduism
[1:52:34] [Music]
[1:52:40] everybody okay
[1:52:43] if you sleeping stand back there
[1:52:45] the bible said keep your heart
[1:52:48] with all water
[1:52:50] because out of it come the water
[1:52:53] in other words the course of your life
[1:52:55] is starting from your heart that's why
[1:52:57] your soul is purchased
[1:52:59] if you open your soul to anything you
[1:53:02] can get yourself in trouble
[1:53:04] amen the bible says in in uh
[1:53:08] john 3 john's chapter 1 beloved i wish
[1:53:13] above all things that you may do
[1:53:15] whatever
[1:53:17] everybody want to prosper
[1:53:19] anybody okay
[1:53:21] and be in water
[1:53:23] we want to prosper
[1:53:25] and we want to be in good health in
[1:53:26] other words i don't want to get sick but
[1:53:29] i want to make more money
[1:53:32] anybody care
[1:53:33] john say i wish that happened to you
[1:53:37] but how do i wish
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:41] everybody okay
[1:53:42] anybody okay he said even as the soul do
[1:53:47] what
[1:53:48] so your prosperity naturally
[1:53:52] must be going with your spiritual life
[1:53:57] if you climbing naturally
[1:53:59] spiritually and your prosperity is
[1:54:02] climbing that is the correct prosperity
[1:54:06] but if your prosperity is bringing god
[1:54:08] down
[1:54:09] is making you miss service
[1:54:12] making you don't go to church stopping
[1:54:14] your prayer life attacking your prayer
[1:54:17] life your prosperity is wrong
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] [Laughter]
[1:54:25] what do you try to accomplish in this
[1:54:27] world
[1:54:28] you want to be a big businessman you
[1:54:30] want to own all this big apartment there
[1:54:33] is nothing wrong with it climb up in
[1:54:35] your spiritual life
[1:54:37] and own as many apartments as you want
[1:54:40] own as many houses as you want own as
[1:54:43] many businesses as you want but make
[1:54:46] sure you can be higher
[1:54:48] if you're not climbing higher you
[1:54:50] actually selling your soul
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:56] because i have people that don't come to
[1:54:58] church but they are prospering
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] but the pentecostal understanding is
[1:55:05] prosperity means that god is with us
[1:55:08] if god doesn't bless me then i will
[1:55:11] understand i'm doing something wrong so
[1:55:14] if god is still blessing me i don't go
[1:55:16] to church so i don't need to go to
[1:55:18] church because i'm getting blessed
[1:55:20] because i'm getting my bill paid because
[1:55:22] i'm making more money you're going to
[1:55:24] find out what you're doing one day
[1:55:27] amen all it takes is one shot they can
[1:55:29] bring you down
[1:55:31] everybody
[1:55:32] everybody here in other words you don't
[1:55:35] look for god only when you get trouble
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:42] anybody here when you are sick that's
[1:55:45] the day we're gonna see you in church
[1:55:47] when things begin to collapse down
[1:55:49] that's when you come to church but as
[1:55:51] long as everything is going well you
[1:55:54] cannot go to church you are under curse
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] you are selling your soul
[1:56:02] you are not valuing your soul
[1:56:05] you can gain everything and you want to
[1:56:07] find yourself in hell
[1:56:09] there are many rich people in hell the
[1:56:12] rich people that rejected jesus christ
[1:56:14] went to hell
[1:56:19] and when he rejected jesus he continued
[1:56:22] to prosper
[1:56:24] because prosperity is not a sign that
[1:56:27] god is with us
[1:56:28] [Music]
[1:56:29] anybody here everybody here you might
[1:56:32] find out that i have many trouble that's
[1:56:34] the reason why god is not with you no
[1:56:37] no sir watch your soul
[1:56:40] if your soul is still prospering know
[1:56:43] that your trial is just a test
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:49] everybody okay
[1:56:50] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:56:56] glory to god
[1:56:57] brother branham said that she pulled off
[1:57:00] the holy veil
[1:57:03] to see what sexy really was
[1:57:06] compare that
[1:57:07] what last really will do
[1:57:09] she pulled the veil from both her eyes
[1:57:12] we are right here
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:14] the holy things that god the holy thing
[1:57:18] that god has put over her eyes
[1:57:20] she wanted knowledge
[1:57:22] to know what it was all about so she
[1:57:25] pulled the veil off to see what it was
[1:57:28] all about she listened to the devil
[1:57:31] and noticed what a place he put her in
[1:57:34] now notice
[1:57:36] he perverted
[1:57:38] from innocency from a pure woman
[1:57:41] don't miss this now
[1:57:43] the church has been with this last veil
[1:57:46] on
[1:57:47] notice
[1:57:48] what is done
[1:57:50] to her it's perverted her from a
[1:57:53] nonsense to knowledge
[1:57:57] he moved if
[1:57:59] from innocency to knowledge
[1:58:02] everybody okay
[1:58:04] praise god she knows it's present
[1:58:10] see the holy veil she was innocent with
[1:58:14] the last veil she is knowledge over here
[1:58:17] she doesn't know anything over here now
[1:58:19] she's a phd
[1:58:21] everybody here she knows it's pleasant
[1:58:25] she knows what he does
[1:58:27] it's a fruit a tree to be desired making
[1:58:30] one wise
[1:58:32] she is perverted from the innocent to
[1:58:36] knowledge
[1:58:37] from holiness to fifth and last and from
[1:58:41] life to water
[1:58:42] brother branham is saying when eve moved
[1:58:45] from here
[1:58:46] into this one she's moving from holiness
[1:58:50] from innocency to knowledge not godly
[1:58:53] knowledge she's moving from holy to a
[1:58:56] filthy woman she's moving from life and
[1:58:59] to death
[1:59:00] everybody here so the woman that brought
[1:59:04] adam
[1:59:05] was a filthy woman
[1:59:08] a woman of knowledge
[1:59:10] a woman that become deaf
[1:59:15] because if when she ate the fruit death
[1:59:19] entered the eve
[1:59:20] but death was not inadequate
[1:59:23] death entered adam truism
[1:59:26] so if become a distributor of death
[1:59:31] a man born of a woman is offered
[1:59:34] everybody okay so far
[1:59:36] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:38] brother branham says this
[1:59:40] glory to god
[1:59:43] brother branham says this
[1:59:44] satan
[1:59:46] did it by the woman's lust for knowledge
[1:59:50] for sex
[1:59:51] which she chose by her own
[1:59:54] female agency now notice
[1:59:57] it was eve
[1:59:58] that led adam to the wrong
[2:00:03] i already showed you right here
[2:00:05] and it was the woman that took off her
[2:00:08] clothes
[2:00:11] before her adam took off his
[2:00:15] anybody care
[2:00:17] it is the older woman
[2:00:20] it's always been and still the water
[2:00:27] because we know that adam was locked
[2:00:30] wednesday
[2:00:32] the serpent was destroyed
[2:00:34] and changed completely so that satan
[2:00:37] cannot use him anymore
[2:00:39] locked but the woman is still available
[2:00:43] anybody care
[2:00:44] everybody here so the one who taught
[2:00:47] adam was a filthy woman she became an
[2:00:50] immoral woman she became an adulterous
[2:00:53] woman she become a woman filled with the
[2:00:56] knowledge of sex
[2:00:57] that is the weapon of the devil
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:02] always been
[2:01:03] always will remain
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:07] everybody okay
[2:01:08] everybody good so far
[2:01:10] everybody good so far so what are we
[2:01:12] talking about the mechanism here
[2:01:17] glory to god
[2:01:19] amen
[2:01:20] now let's put a chart here
[2:01:23] and let's see what happened in our chart
[2:01:25] let's start back again
[2:01:27] now
[2:01:28] number one
[2:01:30] we have satan
[2:01:33] everybody okay
[2:01:34] we call him the devil
[2:01:37] amen
[2:01:38] satan
[2:01:39] started that's the first thing everybody
[2:01:42] okay
[2:01:43] satan move
[2:01:44] into a creature
[2:01:46] i'm going slowly
[2:01:48] that creature is number two he's a beast
[2:01:54] everybody okay
[2:01:55] we call that beast the serpent
[2:01:59] anybody okay
[2:02:01] and from the serpent
[2:02:03] the beast will move into the third
[2:02:05] category
[2:02:07] which is a woman
[2:02:11] everybody okay
[2:02:12] now this woman is not just a woman
[2:02:16] it's an immoral woman
[2:02:20] anybody here
[2:02:21] and then from the woman
[2:02:24] we do it okay
[2:02:25] the woman eve
[2:02:27] produce
[2:02:28] two things
[2:02:30] everybody here
[2:02:31] number one
[2:02:33] this woman produces cane

[2:03:10] everybody here
[2:03:11] and cain is also a liar
[2:03:17] anybody care
[2:03:19] and can
[2:03:20] at the beginning can start good
[2:03:24] but later on he will be rejected from
[2:03:26] the presence of god and he will have a
[2:03:29] mark put on him

[2:27:57] the bible says and sarah look how it's
[2:28:00] written
[2:28:01] verify in your bible
[2:28:03] where is the icon
[2:28:05] where
[2:28:08] now we're talking about sarah
[2:28:14] is this the i
[2:28:16] it's the same person
[2:28:20] let me continue
[2:28:22] sarah
[2:28:23] saw the son of who
[2:28:26] ishmael the egyptian
[2:28:28] which he had born unto
[2:28:32] mocking
[2:28:35] ishmael was not born from abraham
[2:28:38] he was born from abram
[2:28:40] wherefore she said unto who
[2:28:44] there is also a changed name in abraham
[2:28:49] if you look at abraham
[2:28:52] abraham
[2:28:55] this remains five
[2:28:58] but the letter changed
[2:29:00] but this one moved from five to seven
[2:29:04] are we okay
[2:29:05] they added h
[2:29:07] and a
[2:29:08] this one they added h
[2:29:11] and they removed the i
[2:29:13] they swap here but this they didn't swap
[2:29:16] anything
[2:29:17] because abraham did not
[2:29:22] did not doubt
[2:29:25] the problem was coming from sarah
[2:29:27] not abraham
[2:29:30] anybody okay
[2:29:31] now abraham
[2:29:34] and she said to abraham who's speaking
[2:29:36] to abraham
[2:29:38] so now it's not the voice of cereal
[2:29:43] it is the voice of sarah
[2:29:46] the voice of the woman
[2:29:48] now we found out that sarah have also a
[2:29:51] voice yes
[2:29:55] sarah had a voice
[2:29:57] which was contrary to the word
[2:30:01] but sarah have a voice let's see the
[2:30:04] voice of sarah
[2:30:08] can i continue
[2:30:10] the bible says he says to abraham cast
[2:30:13] out this bond woman
[2:30:16] take the tree off
[2:30:20] [Music]
[2:30:21] and not only the tree even the fruit
[2:30:24] that came from the tree
[2:30:27] sarah
[2:30:29] use the celery use the tree and produces
[2:30:32] ismael but sarah cannot tolerate
[2:30:37] neither the mother nor the child
[2:30:40] why because
[2:30:42] isaac the promised son is in trouble
[2:30:46] can i continue
[2:30:48] and sarah sarah
[2:30:50] said to abraham cast out this bond woman
[2:30:53] and her son
[2:30:54] for the disney for the son of this bond
[2:30:57] woman
[2:30:59] i thought i thought she was a handmaid
[2:31:02] i thought she looked cute to be with
[2:31:03] abraham
[2:31:05] now she's no longer cute she's a bound
[2:31:07] woman
[2:31:11] anybody here
[2:31:12] shall not be what
[2:31:15] with my son even with who
[2:31:18] right isaac
[2:31:19] okay and the thing was very grievous in
[2:31:23] abraham's side
[2:31:24] that called him off guard
[2:31:26] because of his water
[2:31:28] and god said unto whom
[2:31:31] let it not be grievous in that sight
[2:31:34] because of the lord or because of the
[2:31:37] woman or of that bondwoman in all that
[2:31:41] who
[2:31:43] has said do what
[2:31:45] unto what
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:47] so sarah had a voice
[2:31:52] can i continue
[2:31:54] god never backed the voice of cere
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:00] god never supported devils
[2:32:02] but when sarah spoke
[2:32:05] god came
[2:32:07] and backed that voice and say abraham i
[2:32:10] am behind this voice
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:14] everybody here
[2:32:15] everybody here in other words i have
[2:32:17] anointed sarah
[2:32:20] to say what you
[2:32:22] say everybody here
[2:32:25] because what sarah is saying will both
[2:32:28] remove heger
[2:32:31] and remove ishmael
[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:49] it's a different gift buddy
[2:32:53] you go home you sit
[2:32:55] and go meditate upon this
[2:32:59] everybody here
[2:33:00] galatians chapter 4 job to verse 22.
[2:33:04] let's look at the words of sarah
[2:33:07] the apostle paul comes and pick up sarah
[2:33:12] what is apostle paul saying verse 22
[2:33:15] where am i at god help me let me hurry
[2:33:18] i can't get where i'm trying to let me
[2:33:20] hurry everybody okay
[2:33:23] for it is written
[2:33:25] that abraham had two sons
[2:33:28] the one by a bond made
[2:33:31] and the other by a water
[2:33:35] so sarah is a free woman
[2:33:38] we okay now
[2:33:41] but he who was of the bond woman
[2:33:45] ishmael was born after the water
[2:33:50] the desire of the flesh it was wrong
[2:33:54] but he of the through women three women
[2:33:57] was born by water
[2:33:59] so
[2:34:00] sarah her voice is fleshly
[2:34:06] anybody here but sarah her voice is a
[2:34:10] voice of promise
[2:34:14] everybody here because god reminded that
[2:34:16] for inaudible
[2:34:19] sarah is correct what she's saying is
[2:34:22] line up with my word
[2:34:24] that's why you must listen to her voice
[2:34:27] so it was not the voice of sarah he was
[2:34:30] the voice of god
[2:34:32] in sarah
[2:34:33] [Music]
[2:34:35] everybody okay
[2:34:37] praise god
[2:34:38] job two verse 24
[2:34:41] which things are an allegory a type
[2:34:44] for these are two water
[2:34:50] a double covenant you remember marriage
[2:34:51] and verse
[2:34:52] there are two covenants
[2:34:54] the one from monsanto the law which

[2:38:51] a problem
[2:38:52] we found that the name of sarah was
[2:38:54] changed to sarah
[2:38:56] we found out that the name of abram was
[2:38:58] changed to abraham
[2:39:01] everybody okay
[2:39:03] and this sarah is a woman with a
[2:39:06] prophetic voice
[2:39:08] serene introduced ishmael
[2:39:12] and introduced hagar
[2:39:14] but serra is kicking ismail and his
[2:39:18] kicking is removing the destruction
[2:39:21] is removing sin from the home of abraham
[2:39:26] everybody okay
[2:39:28] verse 5
[2:39:29] neither shall your name anymore be
[2:39:31] called who
[2:39:33] but your name shall be called water
[2:39:36] for a father of water
[2:39:39] shall
[2:39:40] my father of many nations have a water
[2:39:43] so abraham means water
[2:39:45] [Music]
[2:39:46] everybody here job to verse
[2:39:49] 15
[2:39:51] and god said to abraham as for cere
[2:39:55] your wife you shall not call her name
[2:39:58] siree but
[2:40:00] shall her name be and i will bless her
[2:40:03] and give you a son also of her yea i
[2:40:07] will bless her and she shall be the
[2:40:09] water
[2:40:10] mother of water
[2:40:13] mother of water
[2:40:14] abraham was the father of water
[2:40:17] and i and aaron and sarah is mother of
[2:40:20] water
[2:40:21] sarah is mother of water
[2:40:27] so when they change abraham to a father
[2:40:30] of nation

[2:41:18] mother of nation they have one name
[2:41:21] compared to nation one is a male version

[2:46:49] cere
[2:46:50] produces ishmael a word chad but he take
[2:46:55] a prophetic anointing
[2:46:58] of this era where eternity has been
[2:47:02] logging to both of them
[2:47:04] and they became one mother of nation and
[2:47:08] father of nation carrying the same name
[2:47:11] in order to destroy hagar and ishmael
[2:47:18] that's why you need the baptism of the
[2:47:20] holy ghost
[2:47:21] if you want to get your ishmael off your
[2:47:24] life
[2:47:25] you want to take ahead of your life you
[2:47:28] need the connection to number eight
[2:47:31] you need the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:47:34] to remove ishmael to remove the carnal
[2:47:37] nature the wild nature from your home
[2:47:42] [Music]
[2:47:43] everybody okay
[2:47:44] everybody okay
[2:47:48] brother branham said the son of the
[2:47:50] bound woman will distress the son of the
[2:47:53] free woman until the son of the bond
[2:47:55] woman will be water
[2:47:57] that let us know that they they hatred
[2:48:01] and the blasphemy of satan against the
[2:48:03] true christian will be vented through a
[2:48:06] group who are nominal false christian
[2:48:09] can and this will increase until god
[2:48:12] uproot the false vine at the end of
[2:48:15] water
[2:48:16] because abraham becomes seven
[2:48:19] church natural and church water
[2:48:22] and the bible say cast out the water
[2:48:24] and her
[2:48:26] hagar for she will not be here with the
[2:48:29] free woman and her
[2:48:31] the natural church that is going to
[2:48:33] inherit what the binding of the shift
[2:48:37] the banding of the band to be burned
[2:48:40] and she will not inherit with the we be
[2:48:44] here with the free woman if the bond
[2:48:47] woman is in bondage
[2:48:49] with her water
[2:48:51] children she would not be here with the
[2:48:54] free woman because the free woman's
[2:48:57] children is going in there
[2:49:00] and the bones woman children is gonna
[2:49:02] stand in there
[2:49:04] that's why they need to do water by the
[2:49:06] spiritual awata we are off the spiritual
[2:49:09] women
[2:49:10] and because we are of the spiritual
[2:49:12] woman now we have a voice and we know
[2:49:16] that the voice of sarah is the voice of
[2:49:19] the bride
[2:49:20] that's why brother branham said that
[2:49:23] when methodists fail god raised up other
[2:49:26] and so he has gone through the age
[2:49:28] through the years until in this water
[2:49:31] there is again another
[2:49:34] in the water who under the water
[2:49:37] will be the farmer
[2:49:39] tell the farmer
[2:49:41] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[2:49:43] of god
[2:49:44] it is his own water
[2:49:46] so god is turning to sarah
[2:49:50] he will confront her through the prophet
[2:49:53] abraham
[2:49:54] h i have
[2:49:56] seven letters
[2:49:58] when the water
[2:50:00] our abraham is brahma
[2:50:03] with seven letters with h.a inside with
[2:50:07] the blood for the voice will be in water
[2:50:11] why because he says the spirit and the
[2:50:14] blood say water
[2:50:16] and we are the final forces
[2:50:19] to the families
[2:50:20] and under our final messenger to take
[2:50:23] care of ishmael and to take care of
[2:50:26] hedger let's stand my friend glory to
[2:50:29] god
[2:50:37] the voice of the woman
[2:50:40] the voice of the woman
[2:50:43] we got perverted voices
[2:50:45] perverted voices but there is a true bad
[2:50:48] at the end time that's going to bring
[2:50:50] the true voice of god
[2:50:52] because she will be the founder voice
[2:50:55] everybody okay so far
[2:50:57] the voice of a woman
[2:50:59] the voice of the woman
[2:51:01] everybody okay
[2:51:02] so keep in mind
[2:51:04] if you need to take a screenshot
[2:51:06] remember satan
[2:51:08] is moving from satan
[2:51:10] to the beast from the beast to the woman
[2:51:13] from the woman to can from cain to a
[2:51:16] daughter this is at the beginning
[2:51:19] later on we will go in the end and see
[2:51:22] how this works
[2:51:23] everybody okay
[2:51:25] we are the final voice
[2:51:28] that's why h.a.m have to come at the end
[2:51:32] amen
[2:51:33] amen 8 a.m at the end time
[2:51:36] on the 7th
[2:51:38] ever here because the ham coming at the
[2:51:41] 7 has a meaning it is telling you that
[2:51:44] we are dealing with a different letter
[2:51:46] now
[2:51:47] god has come down
[2:51:49] he's going to take care of that carnal
[2:51:51] child
[2:51:52] that cannot charge and a woman
[2:51:58] everybody here everybody here that's why
[2:52:00] the second oil take care of hagar
[2:52:03] and take care of ishmael
[2:52:07] everybody okay
[2:52:09] let's pray
[2:52:10] heavenly father
[2:52:12] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:52:14] this morning
[2:52:16] father thanking you for your grace
[2:52:18] for your love and your mercy
[2:52:20] and for everything you have been doing
[2:52:22] for us
[2:52:23] father
[2:52:24] the more we are progressing the clear
[2:52:27] now we can see
[2:52:29] that even in numerology
[2:52:31] in a letter in the alphabet
[2:52:34] everything was pointing to this age
[2:52:37] all the perversion that started in eden
[2:52:40] father are going to be done away in this
[2:52:43] age
[2:52:44] no on the paul could look and say that
[2:52:47] you could not come
[2:52:49] until a falling away
[2:52:51] come down
[2:52:52] and the man of sin
[2:52:54] be revealed at the end
[2:52:57] he knew that the revelation of the man
[2:52:59] of sin
[2:53:00] will unfold a different anointing father
[2:53:03] that would take care of our carnal
[2:53:06] nature and remove completely their
[2:53:08] beastly nature until one of this day
[2:53:12] our body will be changing our molecule
[2:53:15] will be changing and death that is still
[2:53:18] raining in our body will no longer have
[2:53:21] a grip in our life
[2:53:22] because by the baptism of the holy
[2:53:24] spirit you are approaching the inward
[2:53:27] man but by the rapture father you are
[2:53:30] taking care of the body to bring lord
[2:53:32] father to with the complete redemption
[2:53:35] of the body and now we're gonna be like
[2:53:37] you and never to fall again father may
[2:53:40] you help the church
[2:53:42] grasp what you're trying to say may you
[2:53:44] help lord father your children
[2:53:46] understand that it's a different level
[2:53:49] it's a different church of the holy
[2:53:51] spirit you are coming to finish the plan
[2:53:54] of redemption to finish everything to
[2:53:57] rescue men completely back again in eden
[2:54:00] so that we can enter into the millennium
[2:54:03] and be able to perform that which adam
[2:54:06] was not able to perform because since
[2:54:09] adam till now no man have ever lived for
[2:54:12] a thousand years old now you are
[2:54:14] rebuilding adam father you took
[2:54:16] preeminence in christ and you are taking
[2:54:19] preeminence into abroad because the
[2:54:21] blood will be the final voice so that
[2:54:23] you are restoring back eden and we can
[2:54:26] go back into the millennium to get into
[2:54:29] the rest of the day
[2:54:30] father we thank you and we're committing
[2:54:32] your children unto their hand lord may
[2:54:34] you strengthen them and may as they go
[2:54:36] throughout the weak lord may you give
[2:54:38] them more clear revelation and
[2:54:41] understanding of the word that will suck
[2:54:43] them into their prayer into their
[2:54:45] presence and further that they can see
[2:54:47] lord that they're so worth more than
[2:54:50] anything what profit of a man that he
[2:54:53] can gain anything
[2:54:55] and lose his own soul
[2:54:57] father what profited us in this world
[2:54:59] where everything is going to chaos and
[2:55:02] the rapture is imminent lord father may
[2:55:04] your children understand the value of
[2:55:06] the soul may they invest in the soul
[2:55:09] because you spoke in your word that seek
[2:55:11] refers the kingdom of god and everything
[2:55:14] shall be given unto thee may we sit
[2:55:16] first that kingdom may we worry first
[2:55:19] about the soul and father you will take
[2:55:21] care of the rest because those things
[2:55:23] will be added unto us father we
[2:55:25] committed and ask it in the name of
