[44:31] from South Africa and I was listening to
[44:34] it today at work so it said No Deal and
[44:37] now
[44:39] it's a family that was living a little
[44:42] bit comfortable
[44:43] and they have a small car
[44:45] and as they were driving on the road
[44:47] they saw a big beautiful car
[44:51] and the voice spoke
[44:53] to the sister
[44:55] and say you can drive any car
[44:58] that you want to

[51:19] the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:20] how many are happy to be in the house of
[51:22] the Lord
[51:23] David said I was glad when they said
[51:25] unto me let us go into the house of the
[51:28] Lord
[51:29] let us open our Bibles to
[51:32] Esther chapter number four
[51:37] we're gonna start from verse 9.
[51:42] today is going to be more of a Bible
[51:43] study
[51:48] Esther chapter number four
[51:52] verses nine we're gonna
[51:55] start from there we're ready
[51:58] and our touch came and told us to these
[52:01] words of Mordecai
[52:03] I get Esther speak unto her touch and
[52:07] gave him commandment unto Mordecai
[52:10] all the king servants and all the people
[52:13] of the king's provinces do nor
[52:16] that whatsoever were there man or woman
[52:19] shall come into the king into the inner
[52:21] Court who is not called
[52:24] there is one law of his to put him to
[52:27] death except such to whom the king shall
[52:31] hold out the golden scepter that he may
[52:35] live
[52:36] but I have not been called to come in
[52:39] unto the king these 30 days
[52:41] and they told to Mordecai Esther's words
[52:45] then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther
[52:49] think not with ice with thyself that
[52:52] thou shall Escape in the King's house
[52:55] more than all the Jews
[52:57] for if thou all together hold his thy
[53:00] peace at this time then shall their
[53:03] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[53:07] Jews from another place
[53:09] but thou in thy father's house shall be
[53:12] destroyed and who knoweth whether at
[53:15] come
[53:16] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[53:19] please mark this for such a time as this
[53:26] answer go gather together all the Jews
[53:29] that are present in shushan and faster
[53:33] for me and neither drink
[53:37] neither eat nor drink the three days
[53:40] night or day I also in my maidens will
[53:44] Fast likewise
[53:45] and so will I go in unto the King which
[53:49] is not according to the law and if I
[53:52] perish let me perish
[53:55] so Mordecai went his way and and did
[53:57] according to all that Esther had
[53:59] commanded may God bless the reading of
[54:03] the word shall we pray dear heavenly
[54:05] father want to thank you for this

[55:23] my brother Caleb I didn't put this court
[55:26] I just put it in the office if you can
[55:28] go in the message
[55:31] 570302 in the message and then Jesus
[55:34] came
[55:36] brother Stephen is
[55:38] an epitome of knowledge I was telling
[55:41] him in the office that it's very
[55:42] difficult to preach it's like I've been
[55:45] invited to a physics lecture when Albert
[55:50] Einstein is sitting down
[55:53] it's very difficult amen and when I was
[55:56] cutting the devil was soft was fighting
[55:58] me I was so busy the past week and it's
[56:00] about one two I'll try to prepare
[56:03] something would come up my wife got very
[56:05] sick and all kinds of things coming up
[56:07] and then when I was coming I was late to
[56:11] the airport and I forgot my my notes I
[56:14] forgot my my Bible in the car and I only
[56:18] realized that I was about to catch the
[56:20] flight but I mean we'll see what the
[56:22] Lord will do tonight
[56:25] let's go to and then Jesus came are you
[56:27] there Brothers
[56:30] 570302 paragraph E20
[56:34] you know when I was in the plane of
[56:35] course we left so early like 3 A.M and
[56:38] the AC was so bad
[56:40] and I caught it like fever and I said
[56:43] the devil is a liar
[56:45] so is his mother-in-law
[56:49] and oh his step children let's go to and
[56:52] then Jesus came are you there brother
[56:58] 570302
[57:00] [Music]
[57:03] and then Jesus came
[57:06] paragraph E20
[57:08] are you there
[57:11] maybe while I'm while they are searching
[57:13] for it can you just greet your brother
[57:15] next to you and say good to see you
[57:16] brother good to see you
[57:25] 57 now she could not go to Jesus
[57:30] and then then Jesus came yeah
[57:37] I wanted the part which says did you
[57:40] ever notice
[57:43] did you ever notice okay did you ever
[57:46] notice that devil like to
[57:49] you want me to read it yeah go ahead did
[57:53] you ever notice the devil like to dwell
[57:56] in tombs
[57:59] they therefore stays around an old dead
[58:02] place
[58:04] and that don't exclude churches either
[58:06] that don't exclude spoken word either
[58:09] when they get colder
[58:12] it is a devil's hangout did you hear
[58:15] that amen
[58:17] did you ever notice the devil likes to
[58:21] dwell in tombs
[58:24] and the devil stays around an old dead
[58:27] place
[58:28] and that don't exceed spoken word
[58:31] Tabernacle either
[58:33] when they get colder it's the Devils
[58:36] hang out thank God
[58:39] so you want to hang out with the devil
[58:41] just get cold
[58:44] if Jesus is in this place this church
[58:47] must have life amen if Jesus is in this
[58:51] place this church must be a lively
[58:54] church amen it cannot be a church of
[58:56] dead people
[58:58] I know there is people who say I get
[59:02] Disturbed when others say Amen let me
[59:06] tell you you're in the wrong place
[59:08] if you want to hear you go to the tombs
[59:12] in church we say Amen to the world
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] in Psalm 81 verse 10 the Bible says open
[59:21] your mouth wide and I'll feel it
[59:23] so the circumference of your mouth when
[59:25] you say hallelujah determines what God
[59:27] is going to put inside
[59:29] the bigger the Hallelujah the bigger the
[59:31] blessings God is gonna
[59:34] let's give God a shout out praise
[59:40] I like the testimony the pastor gave
[59:43] he said he was teaching on the blessing
[59:46] right
[59:47] and someone in South Africa tapped into
[59:50] the anointing
[59:51] rather I refuse to be in this church and
[59:55] allow somebody who is Miles Away
[59:58] and catch our blessing
[1:00:01] the Bible says
[1:00:03] blessed be the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:00:10] spiritual blessings
[1:00:12] Hallelujah so right where you are you
[1:00:15] are blessed
[1:00:16] Hallelujah it might not look like you
[1:00:19] are blessed but you are blessed
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:23] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:00:26] it's not by the looks but it's by what
[1:00:30] God has declared he has blessed us with
[1:00:34] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:00:37] places our God is rich in love he is
[1:00:41] rich in Grace he is rich in Mercy he has
[1:00:45] blessed me he has blessed you he has
[1:00:48] bless the bride so therefore I say we
[1:00:52] are blessed Hallelujah if the Bible says
[1:00:55] you are blessed then you are blessed
[1:00:57] Hallelujah I am blessed I'm blessed sure
[1:01:01] I am blessed whether the devil doesn't
[1:01:03] like it I am blessed I am blessed
[1:01:05] whether my neighbor doesn't like it I am
[1:01:07] blessed
[1:01:08] Hallelujah we are blessed the church is
[1:01:12] blessed amen the pride is blessed amen
[1:01:15] so you must wear a smile on your face
[1:01:17] and Shout that I am blessed lift up your
[1:01:21] sword Hallelujah God is shining upon you
[1:01:25] Hallelujah I don't care how sick you are
[1:01:28] but you are blessed Hallelujah
[1:01:32] I don't care what you're going through
[1:01:35] but you are blessed I don't care what
[1:01:37] problems that you have but you are
[1:01:40] blessed if you are blessed receive your
[1:01:43] blessing I want my blessing I want my
[1:01:47] healing I want my Holy Ghost baptism
[1:01:51] you know what I smell fire in this place
[1:01:54] I believe that somebody today will be
[1:01:59] healed
[1:02:00] I believe that somebody today who
[1:02:04] receive overcoming power
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:11] you may take your seats Brothers
[1:02:13] [Applause]
[1:02:16] so tonight
[1:02:18] we are going to speak on a very simple
[1:02:20] subject
[1:02:22] a heroic Ministry in such a time as this
[1:02:27] and with a little text
[1:02:30] that you should have killed the
[1:02:32] amalekites
[1:02:34] tell your name but you should have
[1:02:36] killed all the amalekites
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:43] man of God this is a beautiful pulpit
[1:02:46] this is a very beautiful pulpit
[1:02:48] a Pulpit is not a stage it's called a
[1:02:51] Pulpit because everyone who stands there
[1:02:54] was pulled out of a pit
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:03:06] so for such a time as this
[1:03:10] I'll try to teach a little bit today
[1:03:13] so for such a time as this you've got to
[1:03:16] be victorious
[1:03:18] I know that one of these days somebody
[1:03:21] will provoke victory for the Bride of
[1:03:23] Jesus Christ
[1:03:25] brother pranam says in the message Look
[1:03:27] Away to Jesus he says we are in a
[1:03:30] spiritual race allow me to put my own
[1:03:33] words so you can understand this he says
[1:03:36] it's like two vehicles running side by
[1:03:38] side and you wonder which vehicle is
[1:03:41] running faster but it says in this
[1:03:44] spiritual race the vehicle of the
[1:03:46] message of the hour had run far ahead of
[1:03:50] that of the Antichrist
[1:03:52] he says what we are doing Now is slowing
[1:03:55] down that's why it looks like things are
[1:03:58] slow in the economy of the Bride it's
[1:04:01] not it's all God's program
[1:04:03] after a mighty Revival Jesus took time
[1:04:06] to rest in the boat and the disciples
[1:04:09] were saddled with giving testimonies of
[1:04:12] what had taken place
[1:04:14] but something happened the storm came
[1:04:16] and it provoked Jesus to be called back
[1:04:19] on the scene
[1:04:21] that's why it looks like things are not
[1:04:23] going the way you want but it's all
[1:04:26] God's program
[1:04:28] we are giving great testimonies of the
[1:04:30] visitation of God in these last days but
[1:04:33] one of these days
[1:04:35] we are
[1:04:38] waiting for the Antichrist automobile to
[1:04:41] catch up and when it catches up then he
[1:04:45] says to watch the third pool
[1:04:47] he says what you see temporarily
[1:04:50] manifested will come into its fullness
[1:04:53] Hallelujah so nothing is out of Keta
[1:04:57] friends
[1:04:58] so that the root of this hour will know
[1:05:01] that the bridegroom is still in our
[1:05:03] midst
[1:05:04] and full of purpose like Boaz was given
[1:05:08] he gave a commandment to the young men
[1:05:10] he said for this lady she had served so
[1:05:13] well
[1:05:14] so every once in a while give a bonus
[1:05:18] are we together so these bonuses will be
[1:05:21] going on all the time
[1:05:23] healings Deliverance is great signs and
[1:05:26] wonders
[1:05:27] everything will be taking place
[1:05:29] Allelujah it might not be in the
[1:05:31] quantity of expectation but the Lord
[1:05:35] will prove that is still amongst his
[1:05:37] bride all the time
[1:05:40] so we see in the regime of the
[1:05:42] Antichrist things tightening up and to
[1:05:44] wind up to such a Time Hallelujah
[1:05:48] that will that will know that our God is
[1:05:51] Raising some heroes in some champions
[1:05:54] for such a time as this
[1:05:57] tonight you are not gonna live here
[1:05:59] without some sort of display
[1:06:02] did you hear that
[1:06:04] you aren't gonna live here without some
[1:06:07] sort of display
[1:06:09] this is the seventh Age We Are Back To
[1:06:12] The Feast of isras
[1:06:15] was one of the richest kings ever known
[1:06:19] he had control over
[1:06:21] 127 provinces
[1:06:24] I don't know if any any other country
[1:06:26] that has got 127 States yet I think
[1:06:29] America has got 100 about 51 or 52.
[1:06:34] but after and and for six months the
[1:06:37] Bible says he was displaying his wealth
[1:06:41] nobody saw the same thing twice
[1:06:44] are we together then after the six
[1:06:47] months display he decided to have a fist
[1:06:50] time for seven days
[1:06:53] so each fifth day he will tell his guys
[1:06:56] that you haven't seen nothing yet
[1:07:00] because this King had in his mind that
[1:07:03] on the seventh day I'm gonna show the
[1:07:06] people my greatest treasure
[1:07:08] so the greatest Treasure of ayesaras was
[1:07:11] that his Bentley
[1:07:13] the greatest Treasure of ayeseras was in
[1:07:17] his private jet
[1:07:19] the greatest treasure over here was in
[1:07:22] this Palace
[1:07:26] was his bride
[1:07:31] so vashti a type of a Pentecostal Church
[1:07:36] refuse is display that is what
[1:07:39] introduced Esther
[1:07:42] somebody who looks like a stranger to
[1:07:44] the economy
[1:07:47] blessings of the Jews getting the
[1:07:49] blessings of the Gentiles
[1:07:51] I haven't started preaching yet
[1:07:54] so anyhow Esther in God's Providence
[1:07:57] because she must show us a type
[1:08:00] was selected Among The Virgins that will
[1:08:03] appear for consideration
[1:08:06] at each of the virgins when they came
[1:08:08] near haggai
[1:08:09] haggai was a king's Chamberlain who is
[1:08:12] the preparer of virgins
[1:08:15] are we together and he was made a eunuch
[1:08:18] so that he cannot interact with these
[1:08:21] ladies in that manner
[1:08:23] are we together
[1:08:25] if we have a hot guy in this day he
[1:08:28] never gave us his seed
[1:08:29] he never gave us his thoughts he never
[1:08:32] gave us his ideas
[1:08:34] he never gave us his opinions
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:39] that which I received from the Lord like
[1:08:41] Paul says the same I delivered
[1:08:45] that's what this haggai did
[1:08:47] Hallelujah
[1:08:51] that guy doesn't fuse with no man he
[1:08:54] gives you what you want
[1:08:57] so each of these ones they were came
[1:08:59] they were they were coming with opinion
[1:09:01] of what they thought was acceptable
[1:09:03] before the king and hakai was giving it
[1:09:06] because it only represents the only
[1:09:08] light left it's going to shine upon the
[1:09:11] real wheat and the real tears are we
[1:09:14] together they are not two sons there's
[1:09:16] only one son s-u-n
[1:09:19] it doesn't change the seed that you are
[1:09:22] but it only transformed that same seed
[1:09:25] to come through different maturity
[1:09:27] whether good or bad that's why you need
[1:09:30] sunlight
[1:09:32] that is why Judas Iscariot yet to come
[1:09:35] and be with Christ
[1:09:37] I think it would be wrong for us to
[1:09:39] suggest that Jesus never knew who Judas
[1:09:42] was from day one
[1:09:44] he knew him
[1:09:47] his induction into apostleship was not
[1:09:50] by accident
[1:09:51] halleluia because his role is to fulfill
[1:09:55] Peter cannot do it and it is necessary
[1:09:58] for you and me to Rejoice at Salvation
[1:10:02] so Christ knew him and he put him there
[1:10:05] this guy needed Jesus so that the seed
[1:10:09] in him can go through different
[1:10:12] developmental stages of his life
[1:10:15] so that it could fulfill the purpose
[1:10:17] just like Peter needed him we all need
[1:10:20] him tonight
[1:10:22] that's why the Dynamics of Peter Judas
[1:10:24] and everyone was not it was in this
[1:10:27] hands of the same person
[1:10:30] so when Judas Iscariot became right
[1:10:32] ripened by Jesus's assessment Jesus gave
[1:10:36] him an inspiration
[1:10:38] he says that which thou doeth too
[1:10:41] quickly
[1:10:43] when when he gave that message only
[1:10:46] Judas understood it in the context in
[1:10:49] which it was given
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] can I preach it like a black man
[1:11:00] so these ladies maybe 1 000 they were
[1:11:04] they gathered together and they were
[1:11:06] asking for this in that and hug I was
[1:11:10] dishing it out but the Bible says when
[1:11:13] it came the time of Esther it says
[1:11:16] Esther required nothing except that guy
[1:11:20] in his own wisdom
[1:11:26] she had dropped her personal belief she
[1:11:29] wasn't living by her own opinion
[1:11:31] she had a testimony like Paul he says I
[1:11:35] live by the faith of the son of God
[1:11:38] Hallelujah said to look like a guy you
[1:11:42] know the king better
[1:11:43] you are the one who's closest to the
[1:11:45] king so whatever you think you give it
[1:11:48] to me brothers and sisters there was
[1:11:50] only one man in this age Hallelujah who
[1:11:53] was closest to God they call him William
[1:11:56] Marion Branham he said I was not the one
[1:11:59] who appeared at Ohio River but I was the
[1:12:02] one nearest when he appeared he says a
[1:12:05] man is what we feel he says you are not
[1:12:08] feeding on me but you are feeding on the
[1:12:10] unfailing body weight of this son of man
[1:12:15] Hallelujah
[1:12:19] so one day God was so happy with this
[1:12:22] man and he gave him an offer and he said
[1:12:25] would you like who to walk with me and
[1:12:27] the hand in hand in the wilderness they
[1:12:30] were working together so he qualifies to
[1:12:33] be by every standard to be the haga of
[1:12:36] this hour he knows what king I said as
[1:12:39] King Jesus of this hour what he likes
[1:12:43] so when Esther prepared herself by her
[1:12:45] guy's teaching
[1:12:47] she appeared before I hesaras and she
[1:12:50] became the Delight of ayeseras because
[1:12:52] ayeseras could see his reflection in her
[1:12:56] what was still lost Esther gained and
[1:13:00] she became the final display
[1:13:02] you know what I've been doing I've been
[1:13:04] telling the story of your life
[1:13:07] so don't worry the full Vindication of
[1:13:10] God of Heroes in this hour will come
[1:13:12] into full manifestation I congratulate
[1:13:15] you all
[1:13:22] so we are here
[1:13:23] [Applause]
[1:13:24] for another battle
[1:13:26] brother Branham says he says you can't
[1:13:29] have a victory unless there is a battle
[1:13:32] so a hero is someone who is a powerful
[1:13:36] word it's someone who he speaks of
[1:13:38] someone who is courageous someone who's
[1:13:41] adventurous someone who is fearless or
[1:13:45] someone who can break the norm
[1:13:47] so this world has used this word hero to
[1:13:50] talk about Batman
[1:13:52] and all the superheroes or the Superman
[1:13:56] up until we have so much in our young
[1:13:58] people who know more about Batman than
[1:14:01] the Heroes of Faith
[1:14:03] but these Heroes of Faith in the Bible
[1:14:06] they cannot be compared to the heroes of
[1:14:08] this world
[1:14:10] but we are called to be true Pride
[1:14:12] Heroes
[1:14:13] for such a time as this
[1:14:16] so every biblical character we read in
[1:14:18] the scripture had a unique place
[1:14:21] at the unique role in the purpose
[1:14:24] for some we read about their lifespan
[1:14:27] for decades
[1:14:28] for others we only read about them for a
[1:14:31] few hours
[1:14:32] but with our limited ability with our
[1:14:35] mind's ability it is difficult to
[1:14:38] comprehend every aspect of the scripture
[1:14:41] to place a value of one hero in the
[1:14:44] Bible above another
[1:14:46] because everyone in the Bible they're
[1:14:49] the very single uh role to play
[1:14:53] how do you convey Abraham with Noah how
[1:14:56] do you convey Noah with Jeremiah
[1:14:59] how do you convey Elijah with sermon of
[1:15:01] Cyrene
[1:15:02] we all know about Elijah Elijah shut the
[1:15:05] heaven he was a hero
[1:15:08] Elijah called for fire from heaven
[1:15:11] Elijah dropped the mantle of Elisha
[1:15:15] are we together the impact of Elijah's
[1:15:19] Ministry was so measurable that King
[1:15:22] Ahab called Elijah a man who had
[1:15:25] troubled Israel
[1:15:26] so heroes are destructive
[1:15:29] heroes are known for causing a problem
[1:15:32] heroes are known for causing trouble to
[1:15:35] the waters
[1:15:36] do we have heroes in Charlotte this
[1:15:38] evening
[1:15:40] Hallelujah I said to the young people if
[1:15:43] the devil doesn't know your name it's a
[1:15:45] problem
[1:15:45] he's supposed to know your name
[1:15:48] Paul I know Caleb I know Peter I know
[1:15:52] you've got to be heroes to cause
[1:15:54] destructive to the enemy
[1:15:57] Hallelujah
[1:15:58] the devil has to know your name
[1:16:01] are we together somebody preached back
[1:16:03] to me
[1:16:04] Hallelujah so when you read the
[1:16:07] scripture about the Heroes of Faith
[1:16:09] Elijah is the man that traveled Israel
[1:16:12] but his role covers many years
[1:16:15] more than that the spirit of Elijah
[1:16:18] brother God is so good
[1:16:20] that he could use the same spirit and
[1:16:23] use it more than once because the spirit
[1:16:26] speaks of something so we see the spirit
[1:16:29] of Elijah was found on Elisha
[1:16:32] and that same Spirit was found on John
[1:16:34] the Baptist and that same Spirit was
[1:16:37] found on William Branham and that same
[1:16:40] spirit will come back to the Jews so
[1:16:43] don't tell me that we cannot have Heroes
[1:16:45] because God promised a visitation he
[1:16:47] said the spirit of Elijah who come upon
[1:16:50] Elisha
[1:16:51] Hallelujah so brother says everyone is a
[1:16:55] Ministry everyone has a road to play
[1:16:57] right
[1:16:59] and everyone is the road to being a hero
[1:17:03] but Elijah is one of the bigger names
[1:17:05] what about Simon of Cyrene
[1:17:07] sermon of Cyrene was not a prophet
[1:17:10] there were no books written about him
[1:17:13] his name was not found in Hebrews 11
[1:17:16] when Paul was recounting The Heroes of
[1:17:18] Faith
[1:17:19] but in God's Great drama in which we all
[1:17:23] have a place
[1:17:24] sermon of Cyrene finds himself
[1:17:27] in a uni at a unique place
[1:17:30] at the right time
[1:17:32] Simon of Cyrene was not a Roman he was
[1:17:36] not a Jew he was from Cyrene but he
[1:17:39] finds himself in Jerusalem in the
[1:17:42] closing days of Jesus's Ministry amen
[1:17:45] I'm here to tell somebody today that
[1:17:48] everyone whose code is a hero
[1:17:51] Hallelujah everyone is a part to play I
[1:17:54] don't care the part the size of the part
[1:17:56] but it's important for us to Allah to
[1:17:59] play our part and if we find our place
[1:18:02] then the devil is finished brother
[1:18:04] pranam says perfect faith is based on
[1:18:06] your position and when you are in a
[1:18:09] position you can tell the devil you get
[1:18:11] out of here
[1:18:12] this is mine this is my house this is my
[1:18:16] children this is my body Hallelujah you
[1:18:19] can tell the devil that sickness you
[1:18:21] don't have a right to be in this body
[1:18:23] because I know my place I know my
[1:18:27] position I know what I'm called to do
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] glory to God
[1:18:34] so the entire Old Testament was pointing
[1:18:38] to the coming of Messiah amen the New
[1:18:40] Testament talks about the Messiah what
[1:18:43] he did how how he lived and how do you
[1:18:47] would forever change the world
[1:18:49] but sermon of Cyrene the unlikely hero
[1:18:53] finds himself
[1:18:55] in the days after the Feast of the
[1:18:57] Passover amen and with this history
[1:19:00] people were carrying crosses on their
[1:19:03] way to be crucified
[1:19:05] crucifixions were common in Jerusalem
[1:19:08] but this day was different
[1:19:11] Hallelujah among the men to be crucified
[1:19:14] was a man called Jesus
[1:19:17] a man who did nothing to deserve it amen
[1:19:20] a man without sin and he was being
[1:19:23] laughed out at and being spit upon and
[1:19:26] he was bruised he was weary and he
[1:19:29] couldn't Carry the Cross
[1:19:31] how precious it is to carry the cross of
[1:19:35] Jesus Amen Simon of Cyrene was commanded
[1:19:39] to carry the cross
[1:19:41] so every biblical character stepped
[1:19:43] forward playing their roles in God's
[1:19:45] Great drama
[1:19:47] but there's another man that I want to
[1:19:49] talk about in a few minutes who was a
[1:19:51] man after God's Own Heart
[1:19:54] you know him
[1:19:56] yet in God's Great drama
[1:20:00] like this man he had a unique
[1:20:04] distinction right
[1:20:05] he is described by God in both the Old
[1:20:08] and the New Testament as a man after my
[1:20:11] own heart that's exactly what
[1:20:13] a man who shall fulfill my will amen
[1:20:16] this man is called David yes I just want
[1:20:20] to talk about David a little bit a
[1:20:21] little bit before we strike our text
[1:20:24] this evening go ahead so when the
[1:20:26] children of Israel looked around to look
[1:20:28] for a king
[1:20:29] they looked they checked and found a man
[1:20:33] the popular vote was so right
[1:20:37] this man was tall he was a good family
[1:20:40] man he was very powerful man
[1:20:43] a lot of people loved this man that was
[1:20:45] man's choice but David was God's choice
[1:20:48] amen are we together so what makes David
[1:20:52] unique is he was a little Shepherd
[1:20:55] he was a musician
[1:20:57] you think of him being anointed by his
[1:20:59] soul by Samuel
[1:21:01] as you read the book of Psalms
[1:21:04] in the life of David you see every
[1:21:07] possible emotion a man could ever
[1:21:10] possess
[1:21:12] so David passed through he was a man of
[1:21:14] Faith he was a man of Joy he passed
[1:21:17] through a lot of pain you had so much
[1:21:21] grief in his spirit and so much desire
[1:21:24] but so much sadness and every emotion
[1:21:28] that a man could ever possess but he
[1:21:31] grows up in our very eyes
[1:21:34] and we see he was a man after God's Own
[1:21:38] Heart are we together so throughout the
[1:21:41] scripture you see the clips of people's
[1:21:44] lives you see here and there and you
[1:21:46] don't know much about people's lives but
[1:21:48] David was different right
[1:21:50] so we see David was a Shepherd right
[1:21:54] David was a hunter
[1:21:56] we see him as a warrior right we see him
[1:21:59] as a general right we see him as a king
[1:22:01] we see him as a poet we see him as a
[1:22:05] champion we see him as an outlaw we see
[1:22:08] him as a ladies man we see David as a
[1:22:11] musician we see him as a prophet right
[1:22:14] we see him as a worship leader we see
[1:22:17] him as an adulterer we see him as a
[1:22:19] murderer we see him as a brother we see
[1:22:22] him as a husband we see him as a son
[1:22:24] right we see him as a parent right we
[1:22:26] see him as a leader but he was an
[1:22:29] ancestor of the lineage of Christ he was
[1:22:32] a man after God's Own Heart amen despite
[1:22:35] his ups and doubts he was still numbered
[1:22:37] in Hebrews 11 and I'm here to tell you
[1:22:40] that despite your absent outs you will
[1:22:43] be in that number
[1:22:45] amen
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] glory to God
[1:22:50] so whenever you feel low
[1:22:52] you always want to go to the Book of
[1:22:54] Psalms right Caleb let's go to Psalm 1
[1:22:56] Psalm 23 we all know it that's right
[1:22:59] the Lord is my shepherd right this is a
[1:23:02] hero speaking right are we together the
[1:23:05] Lord is my shepherd
[1:23:07] I shall not want he makes me lie down in
[1:23:10] Green Pastures
[1:23:12] he lead at me beside the Still Waters He
[1:23:15] restored my soul he leaded me in the
[1:23:18] path of righteousness for his namesake
[1:23:21] this is how Heroes speak he says yeah
[1:23:24] yeah though I walk
[1:23:26] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:23:29] death amen I will fear no evil for thou
[1:23:32] art with me thyroid and thy stuff
[1:23:35] comfort me he says Thou prepare us that
[1:23:38] table for me in the presence of my
[1:23:41] enemies don't tell me that you don't
[1:23:44] have enemies because he wants to prepare
[1:23:46] a table in the presence of your enemies
[1:23:49] somebody preach back to me amen
[1:23:52] so give God an opportunity to prepare a
[1:23:56] table in the presence of your enemies
[1:24:00] Hallelujah yes sir let's go to the next
[1:24:03] verse he says Thou prepare us a table he
[1:24:06] says surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:24:10] follow me Hallelujah he says surely
[1:24:14] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:24:19] the days of my life Hallelujah and I
[1:24:22] will shall dwell in the house of the
[1:24:23] Lord forever that's how Heroes speak
[1:24:26] speak like a hero amen hallelujah

[1:24:31] house goodness and mercy shall follow me
[1:24:34] amen when I go to school goodness and
[1:24:37] mercy shall follow me when I'm at my job
[1:24:40] goodness and mercy shall follow me when
[1:24:44] I come to church goodness and mercy
[1:24:47] shall follow me Hallelujah that's how
[1:24:50] Heroes speak speak like a hero amen talk
[1:24:53] like a hero live like a hero Hallelujah

[1:25:01] Panther in there Batman or something but

[1:25:40] when the spirit comes my God I feel like
[1:25:43] preaching us can I preach to you you are
[1:25:46] a hero waits for such a time as this
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:50] next slide listen to David

[1:25:57] increase that trouble me go ahead many a
[1:26:00] day that Rise Against Me many they wish
[1:26:03] say of my soul there is no help for him
[1:26:06] in God that's how Heroes speak he says
[1:26:10] but thou art oh Lord at my shield for me
[1:26:13] my glory and the lifter of mine had I
[1:26:17] Cried unto the Lord with my voice and
[1:26:20] they hate me out of his Holy Hill
[1:26:23] he had the words of the hero this
[1:26:25] evening I will not be afraid of it 10
[1:26:28] 000 people that have set themselves
[1:26:30] against me
[1:26:31] you want one more
[1:26:33] he says I'll lift up my eyes unto the
[1:26:35] heels from whence cometh my help my help
[1:26:38] coming from the Lord which made Heaven
[1:26:40] and Earth and he will not suffer that
[1:26:42] food to be moved
[1:26:44] if David was here he was going to say I
[1:26:47] was glad when they said unto me let us
[1:26:50] go into the house of the Lord give God a
[1:26:53] shout out praise
[1:26:58] let me give you a small testimony
[1:27:01] there is a pastor in Africa South Africa
[1:27:04] to uh Zimbabwe to be specific but he
[1:27:06] went to South Africa for Revival
[1:27:09] meetings
[1:27:10] his name is brother pastor gumiso
[1:27:13] so they went to Cape Town
[1:27:15] and in the midst of the services you
[1:27:18] know the atmosphere was already charged
[1:27:20] like the way it's charged here
[1:27:24] do you believe that we are creatures of
[1:27:25] atmosphere the reason why you are here
[1:27:29] tonight
[1:27:30] anything
[1:27:31] Hallelujah read my lips tonight anything
[1:27:35] yes sir
[1:27:37] can happen tonight amen hallelujah it's
[1:27:40] not because brother Stephen is here but
[1:27:43] because we are creatures of atmosphere
[1:27:46] you are the one who create the
[1:27:48] atmosphere
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:51] are we together amen so this sister was
[1:27:53] in a wheelchair
[1:27:55] and because
[1:27:57] she had an accident
[1:27:59] and she couldn't walk the doctors had
[1:28:02] written her off says she'll never walk
[1:28:04] again
[1:28:05] all her legs the bones were broken
[1:28:08] she was in the wheelchair
[1:28:10] but she purposed in her heart that when
[1:28:12] I got to these meetings I'm gonna go
[1:28:15] home walking again amen
[1:28:18] those are the kind of Heroes that I like
[1:28:20] talking about amen
[1:28:22] so she came in a wheelchair as the word
[1:28:25] was being preached the sister would move
[1:28:27] a wheelchair from the aisle and she
[1:28:29] would go forward and you say hallelujah
[1:28:32] and she would raise her hands like yes
[1:28:34] my brother are we together amen the
[1:28:37] doctors had said she'll never walk again
[1:28:41] but God said

[1:35:09] this message is the shout
[1:35:12] the Lord himself shall descend with a
[1:35:16] shout that's the message of the hour
[1:35:19] shout is the Gathering of the Eagles
[1:35:21] together in preparation for the rapture
[1:35:25] the message of the hour Allelujah is the
[1:35:28] Capstone Ministry
[1:35:31] the message of the hour is The Rock
[1:35:34] the stone that Daniel saw
[1:35:37] the message of the hour did not come
[1:35:40] from a seminar College
[1:35:43] the message of the hour did not come
[1:35:45] from Rome
[1:35:47] it did not come from America but it came
[1:35:50] from above
[1:35:52] so this message is the quickening power
[1:35:55] this message of the hour is the power of
[1:35:58] Resurrection
[1:35:59] this message of the hour is the healing
[1:36:02] of your body that's right
[1:36:05] and it's the healing of the bright body
[1:36:07] amen I'm getting excited now
[1:36:11] what does the Bible say the Bible says
[1:36:14] in the Book of Malachi before the
[1:36:16] promise of the of Elijah it says the son
[1:36:19] of righteousness shall rise with healing
[1:36:23] in his
[1:36:24] come on with his wings
[1:36:28] let me tell you something
[1:36:30] what was the Vindication of William
[1:36:33] Branham
[1:36:34] when he when he when he already got that
[1:36:38] gift because the son of righteousness is
[1:36:41] already risen
[1:36:43] what was the Vindication or the sign of
[1:36:46] the commission
[1:36:48] what sign of gift was given in his hand
[1:36:52] to dictate the diseases of the people
[1:36:56] that was the vindication
[1:36:58] that it was the end time prophet
[1:37:01] the gift of healing was a vindication
[1:37:04] what that he was to forerun the second
[1:37:07] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:09] do you know why God gave him that gift
[1:37:12] you know why because he was the
[1:37:15] messenger of the Resurrection
[1:37:18] he was the messenger of the rapture are
[1:37:22] we together
[1:37:23] he was the messenger of the change of
[1:37:25] the body
[1:37:27] so what did he do God gave him that gift
[1:37:30] to dictate every disease
[1:37:34] why was it so because Divine Healing is
[1:37:38] the down payment of the body change
[1:37:42] did you hear that Divine Healing
[1:37:46] is a down payment
[1:37:48] of the change of the body if God can
[1:37:51] heal your cancer
[1:37:53] that's just a fortest
[1:37:55] of what will happen to you one day
[1:37:59] not only cancer in your stomach but the
[1:38:02] whole body will be changed Hallelujah
[1:38:05] that's why we don't measure on healings
[1:38:08] because to add that Elementary level
[1:38:11] we focus on the body change
[1:38:14] Hallelujah when you hear faith comes by
[1:38:18] hearing so hearing by the word of God
[1:38:21] and that's your healing
[1:38:23] are we together
[1:38:24] rupturing Faith lays in the message
[1:38:28] how many believe they are going to be
[1:38:29] raptured
[1:38:30] Hallelujah so what you are saying you
[1:38:33] are saying already you are healed
[1:38:34] because that's that's your down payment
[1:38:38] halleluia
[1:38:40] that's why we're giving the mantle of
[1:38:42] Elijah not the mantle of Oral Roberts
[1:38:45] not the matter of Billy Graham amongst
[1:38:48] us healing is not a thing
[1:38:50] the same God who restored the brother's
[1:38:54] car in the days of the Prophet is the
[1:38:57] same God who restored my wallet last
[1:38:59] week that I lost
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:01] the same God who healed
[1:39:04] sister middle
[1:39:06] is the same God
[1:39:08] who healed my mother
[1:39:10] of a cancerous breast lamp
[1:39:15] are we together
[1:39:17] and when the you see the Deadpool
[1:39:20] brother
[1:39:21] it's already
[1:39:24] are we together
[1:39:26] be like the Centurion speak the word
[1:39:29] only
[1:39:31] and I know my servant will be healed
[1:39:32] what does the Bible say about your
[1:39:35] condition

[1:39:38] requests
[1:39:40] speak the word only the Bible says and
[1:39:44] by my stripes you are you are we
[1:39:47] together so every sick person here must
[1:39:51] receive their healing upon that
[1:39:52] scripture
[1:39:54] are we together why would you go out
[1:39:56] sick tonight when the Bible says by my
[1:39:59] stripes you are healed
[1:40:01] if I were you if I was sick I would take

[1:40:56] and in Judea but I want to tell you
[1:40:59] something tonight as the word became

[1:44:41] his word by the same actions the same
[1:44:44] things that he did making the word
[1:44:46] manifest or if the church only knew its

[1:48:57] so does in Exodus 17.
[1:49:01] verse 16.
[1:49:03] let's read together
[1:49:05] for he said
[1:49:07] let's read together because the Lord has
[1:49:09] sworn
[1:49:11] that the Lord will have war with amalek
[1:49:14] from generation to generation
[1:49:18] oh for he said the Lord is sworn that
[1:49:22] you have war with amalek from generation
[1:49:26] to generation
[1:49:28] now it's of Paramount importance for us
[1:49:31] to know who amalek is and what the
[1:49:34] spirit of amalek before we control it
[1:49:36] when it comes up
[1:49:38] now amalek was a son of elephants and
[1:49:42] elephants was a Duke of Edom
[1:49:45] those were one of the sons of ADA
[1:49:48] if you read the book of Genesis 36 and
[1:49:51] Ada was one of the wives of Esau
[1:49:54] so when amalek was was actually from the
[1:49:58] generation of Esau
[1:50:00] are we together
[1:50:01] but there's something about amalek that
[1:50:04] God said he says anywhere you see this
[1:50:07] nation
[1:50:08] anywhere you see this seed he says I
[1:50:11] have war against them
[1:50:14] are we together if you watch in the
[1:50:17] Bible akan was one of the great great
[1:50:20] grandsons of amalek
[1:50:23] are we together
[1:50:25] that is why when God came up when this
[1:50:28] Spirit came up it went to Mordecai and
[1:50:30] God was angry
[1:50:31] the spirit of amalek is that spirit that
[1:50:35] comes to take control of a man and
[1:50:38] pushes him into major mistakes in his
[1:50:42] weak state
[1:50:44] foreign
[1:50:47] is that spirit
[1:50:50] that waits for that day yes sir when we
[1:50:53] are weak right and takes over you pushes
[1:50:57] you to do dangerous errors
[1:51:01] the spirit of amalek is that spirit that
[1:51:05] takes advantage of your vulnerability
[1:51:08] that's exactly right of your weakness
[1:51:11] that's exactly right in Genesis 17 when
[1:51:15] the sorry
[1:51:18] yes yes yes yes in Genesis 17 when the
[1:51:22] people were tested for water
[1:51:25] and they wanted to drink water
[1:51:27] amalek rose up in that weak State and he
[1:51:31] knew they were too weak to fight
[1:51:34] when he knew that they were too weak to
[1:51:36] lift up their heads that's when amalek
[1:51:38] came up in that journey and God was
[1:51:41] provoked and God was angry
[1:51:43] the spirit of amalek is that spirit that
[1:51:47] pushes many believers
[1:51:49] to error
[1:51:52] the spirit of amalek is that Spirit That
[1:51:55] Came Upon David when all his friends had
[1:51:59] gone to war to the battle
[1:52:01] and he knew David's weakness
[1:52:05] Kings have gone to war Kings have gone
[1:52:08] to fight that is one when David stayed
[1:52:11] back
[1:52:12] and when he stayed back the spirit of
[1:52:14] amalek entered him and he saw a woman
[1:52:17] called Bathsheba
[1:52:19] Alleluia and he saw her and the Bible
[1:52:22] says he desired her
[1:52:25] when the spirit of amalek enters a
[1:52:27] person it suspends your senses
[1:52:32] and that is why God was angry
[1:52:35] are we together and God said to David
[1:52:38] upon this sin that you have sinned I
[1:52:41] have become angry with you
[1:52:44] at that weakness of his life
[1:52:48] are we together that's when the spirit
[1:52:50] of amalek came into his life have you
[1:52:53] ever seen when when when when the lion
[1:52:57] wants to get a deer or an animal
[1:53:00] it looks for an animal or a deer that
[1:53:04] has got a crippled leg
[1:53:06] the one which is weak that believer who
[1:53:09] doesn't come to church on Wednesdays
[1:53:12] that believer who doesn't come to church
[1:53:15] regularly
[1:53:17] that believer who stopped coming to
[1:53:19] church when covet hit
[1:53:21] that believer who wants to come who just
[1:53:23] like live streaming
[1:53:26] rather if you are not careful if you use
[1:53:28] of live streaming you can live stream
[1:53:30] heaven
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:33] [Laughter]
[1:53:36] the spirit of amalek
[1:53:38] preach are we together
[1:53:42] it comes to take you over in a weak
[1:53:45] state
[1:53:47] there are some Believers today who have
[1:53:50] done so many things that they shouldn't
[1:53:51] have done
[1:53:52] they look at their lives there are
[1:53:54] certain mistakes that they should have
[1:53:56] you know that they shouldn't have made
[1:53:58] so amalek waited and attacked them when
[1:54:01] they were their weakest
[1:54:03] the period they were down in prayer the
[1:54:06] will period they were not sensitive the
[1:54:08] period they were not fasting
[1:54:11] are we together
[1:54:13] the spirit of amalek is that spirit that
[1:54:16] entered Samson
[1:54:20] are we together
[1:54:21] when he wanted to do great things that
[1:54:23] when it came to him but we came to raise
[1:54:26] war against amalek whatever has entered
[1:54:29] you today we will correct it
[1:54:33] in Deuteronomy 25
[1:54:36] we're about to close verse 17.
[1:54:40] the Bible says remember what amalek did
[1:54:44] unto thee by the way
[1:54:46] when when they came forth unto Egypt he
[1:54:49] says how he met thee by the way and
[1:54:52] smart the Hindi the hidden most part
[1:54:55] of the
[1:54:57] and all those who were feeble behind
[1:55:00] and thou was faint and weary and feared
[1:55:05] not God so in Israel when they were weak
[1:55:09] they they would put strong men in front
[1:55:12] are we together and they would put with
[1:55:15] people at the back
[1:55:17] halleluia so when amalek wanted to Smite
[1:55:20] them the Bible says he came from behind
[1:55:23] and began to Smite every one of them and
[1:55:26] God was angry God said how could you
[1:55:29] attack a man in his weak state
[1:55:32] are we together
[1:55:33] how can you fight a man when he's not
[1:55:37] strong why didn't that Temptation come
[1:55:40] when you were from your three days of
[1:55:42] fasting and prayer
[1:55:43] why didn't that prayer the why didn't
[1:55:46] that Spirit come
[1:55:47] Hallelujah why did it wait for you when
[1:55:51] you were not praying
[1:55:53] why didn't amalek attack you
[1:55:56] when we were coming from an all night
[1:55:58] prayer
[1:56:00] why did it wait for a season that were
[1:56:02] weak God said I am angry with amalek
[1:56:05] that's right that is taking advantage of
[1:56:08] the people
[1:56:09] Hallelujah so the Bible says amalek came
[1:56:12] from behind
[1:56:13] and always from the back I'm sorry to
[1:56:16] people who stay at the back
[1:56:18] he came from the back and he started
[1:56:21] attacking everybody
[1:56:24] by the time they risked we reached in
[1:56:26] front that's when he turned his back and
[1:56:28] went away and God was angry
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:32] and God says amalek halleluia
[1:56:40] and he says anywhere you see this seed I
[1:56:43] will have raised war from generation to
[1:56:46] generation
[1:56:48] so we see in the Bible
[1:56:50] there was a man called Haman
[1:56:52] and Haman was is interesting because
[1:56:55] Haman shouldn't have existed
[1:56:58] Hamman was the from the descendants of
[1:57:00] the amalekites
[1:57:02] at that time the amalekites shouldn't
[1:57:05] have existed
[1:57:07] Hallelujah because the instruction was
[1:57:09] given many years ago to wipe out all the
[1:57:12] amalekites
[1:57:14] if the amalekites were wiped out how
[1:57:16] much shouldn't have been born that's
[1:57:18] right
[1:57:20] but the Bible says when the children of
[1:57:22] Israel left Egypt
[1:57:24] they they had you know they've been
[1:57:27] slaves and you know they were amalekites
[1:57:30] they were Hittites and and so forth and
[1:57:33] they didn't even know how to fight
[1:57:36] but the Bible says amalek attacked them
[1:57:38] when they were their weakest
[1:57:40] the Philistines are the people who are
[1:57:42] strong they sent Goliath give us a a man
[1:57:46] who can fight
[1:57:49] let me tell you something before I
[1:57:50] forget in second Samuel 2.
[1:57:54] we see they saw
[1:57:57] God loved us all right David laughed so
[1:58:00] right now David they were coming from
[1:58:03] the war and then
[1:58:04] men of God there is a brother who just
[1:58:07] came from Norway
[1:58:08] people were rejoicing and they said oh I
[1:58:12] saw so
[1:58:13] was about to die
[1:58:16] and they said was about to die so what
[1:58:18] happened I want you to watch this
[1:58:20] brother who just came from nowhere go
[1:58:22] ahead my brother he just so so I he said
[1:58:25] no I saw so and he was about to die
[1:58:28] and David was seated with his servants
[1:58:30] and he said but why then what happened
[1:58:33] he said I took a knife and I slaughtered
[1:58:37] him
[1:58:38] and Dave says who is this brother
[1:58:40] he said I'm an amalekistan really
[1:58:43] he waited for so to be in his weakness
[1:58:47] and then he attacked him preached my
[1:58:50] brother and he says what did you one
[1:58:51] says I wanted the crown of his head
[1:58:55] amalek wants the crown of your head pray
[1:58:57] to my brother
[1:58:59] he wanted to take Prestige of someone
[1:59:01] who is about to die right you know what
[1:59:04] David said he said gentlemen what are
[1:59:07] you waiting for
[1:59:08] yo this man
[1:59:10] killed those amalekites
[1:59:14] and the Bible says they smote him into
[1:59:17] pieces
[1:59:19] what are those amalekites in your life
[1:59:21] those things that causes you to sin
[1:59:26] is that a magazine is that movies is
[1:59:29] that pornography those things that
[1:59:31] attack you when you're at your weakest
[1:59:33] wait my brother

[1:59:39] I can't preach about this
[1:59:44] let us stand on our feet
[1:59:48] the third pool
[1:59:51] he says you can ask for sister Edith to
[1:59:54] come out of the wheelchair but there is
[1:59:57] a promise of a body change
[1:59:59] he says your parents can actually be
[2:00:02] young
[2:00:03] I mean there's a body change so meaning
[2:00:05] that even the parents could have been
[2:00:07] tanned

[2:00:29] Hallelujah we shall all be changed in a
[2:00:33] twinkling of an eye
[2:00:35] we are not dying brother we are not
[2:00:37] preaching the message from ashes to
[2:00:39] ashes
[2:00:40] but we know we have a promise
[2:00:43] brother Branham says there's going to be
[2:00:44] a bomb for America
[2:00:46] there's going to be a bomb for Russia
[2:00:48] but before they bump my flesh there is
[2:00:51] an exodus

[2:00:58] mystery Babylon Hallelujah and we are
[2:01:01] going into the New Jerusalem and your
[2:01:04] flesh is the mystery Babylon
[2:01:06] are we together
[2:01:08] those amalekites we are raised for such
[2:01:12] a time as this to destroy them
[2:01:17] when you go home read the book of Esther
[2:01:19] uh
[2:01:22] uh
[2:01:24] when you read this the whole story
[2:01:27] you hear that Haman wanted worship
[2:01:30] he said there's people
[2:01:33] who don't want to come who want don't
[2:01:35] want to come to our concerts
[2:01:37] of all the 127 provinces you find here
[2:01:41] and there they are all around here
[2:01:44] and he wanted people to bow down and
[2:01:47] Mordecai said I'm not gonna Bow Down
[2:01:49] I'm not an amalekite
[2:01:51] I'm a true pride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:54] and Haman wanted worship
[2:01:56] and you know the story when they went to
[2:01:58] the king and the King said what should
[2:02:01] we do
[2:02:02] for the king for the person who do this
[2:02:04] and that and because Haman liked worship
[2:02:06] he said give him a horse give him a
[2:02:09] garment and all that
[2:02:11] he is the king and and he said that you
[2:02:14] know give all this
[2:02:16] to Mordecai
[2:02:19] are we together
[2:02:21] when you go home read the book of Esther
[2:02:25] yes and Haman because he wanted to cause
[2:02:28] the children of God
[2:02:31] not to do the right thing
[2:02:33] and he said go and hang him right there
[2:02:36] up up there so that people can see
[2:02:39] Hallelujah
[2:02:41] because Esther had hidden himself
[2:02:45] because she didn't want to expose her
[2:02:47] identity
[2:02:48] sometimes we don't want to expose our
[2:02:50] identity in schools at work that we are
[2:02:52] believers when they say can you drink
[2:02:55] you drink because you are scared but the
[2:02:58] spirit of amalek right attacks you when

[2:08:39] America amen when you see it don't give

[2:08:45] you like he did so wipe him completely
[2:08:48] off
[2:08:49] amen do you know that God gave Soul the
[2:08:52] commission to destroy amalek one time
[2:08:56] forever
[2:08:58] amen God even told him that I remember
[2:09:01] what I saw
[2:09:03] that me and amalek we will finish
[2:09:05] together and I'm giving you this
[2:09:07] commission go ahead and fulfill that
[2:09:09] commission and Saul took
[2:09:13] and spare the king
[2:09:15] and do you know the name of that King
[2:09:18] agat and do you know the Bible say hey
[2:09:20] man was the agar guide
[2:09:24] so the very thing that Soul left going
[2:09:27] out that thing keep bothering up and
[2:09:30] attacking the Jews on the other side but
[2:09:32] thank God you were being raised for such
[2:09:35] a time as this one Amen in other words
[2:09:39] you're not here by accident
[2:09:42] the Bible said we were predestined that
[2:09:44] we were ordained for good work so there
[2:09:47] is a Ministry God already locked into
[2:09:49] you and when the Holy Spirit is coming
[2:09:52] he's Awakening you remember the seed got
[2:09:54] potential
[2:09:56] now the seed need to open whatever
[2:09:58] potential God put on you to fulfill
[2:10:00] before we leave here amen we got a
[2:10:03] mission and that mission will be
[2:10:05] fulfilled amen even this Pulpit had a
[2:10:08] mission because there was a Pulpit here
[2:10:10] but the first pope uh completed its
[2:10:15] course
[2:10:15] then there's the next moment so if
[2:10:18] another bullet again so there is a
[2:10:20] purpose for this puppet did you see
[2:10:23] setting the record straight do you see
[2:10:24] how it's climbing higher because it's
[2:10:27] going somewhere amen it is not me it is
[2:10:30] the holy spirit that is shooting the
[2:10:33] devil everywhere even if he hides
[2:10:36] somewhere the spirit of the Lord is
[2:10:38] coming and shooting him amen that's why
[2:10:41] when you come to this church you will
[2:10:43] notice most of the time things that you
[2:10:45] done at home
[2:10:47] or discussion that you were having at
[2:10:49] home or maybe you were talking to
[2:10:51] somebody you come to this church it
[2:10:53] looks like the preacher was sitting with
[2:10:55] you or he was overhearing you and things
[2:10:58] like that because there is a radar that
