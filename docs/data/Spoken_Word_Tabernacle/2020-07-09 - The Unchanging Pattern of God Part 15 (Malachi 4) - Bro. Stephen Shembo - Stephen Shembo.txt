virtual services I definitely enjoy enjoyable full church but um we know some people are on the streaming and we still have some people here with us this evening so we're happy to be here I'll share a quick testimony um I was on my way to pick up my wife I work in Charlotte she works in Stanley and on Wednesdays I drop her off in the morning and I pick her up so we can ride the gara to church and it's pretty tight it's a it's a tight squeeze to get here on time but uh I was on my way to the house to pick her up and I felt my car was acting up I didn't know what was going on but I was like a bear just hold fast because I pull over and something's wrong I'm gonna have to I'm like it stuck so let me just hold fast and normally I'd pull over and look but I was like let me just get to the house so so I get to the house and I check my tires and one of them is flat and I'm like oh lord I knew that if it caused if I had to jack my top car up and replace the tire and put a spare on it might have made it a squeeze to get here on time and uh so I called called our boss my wife babysits for them and asked if he had a patch kit and he did so I was able to get a plug in it and get it pumped up and and get here on time so I was thankful for that that was God just keeping his eye on us and keeping us under his hand of protection and helping things to work out well so I'm thankful for that but we'll just start the service with a word of Prayer and as always I invite each one to pray with me and we'll just pray together and just open the service and we know God has something store for us today because whether two or three are gathered you know in his name he'll be in their midst and you know we we have more than two here tonight so I know he's in our Miss tonight and I'm expecting great things so let's just bow our heads and pray Lord we love you and thank you we appreciate each opportunity we have to gather one another together Lord just to to worship You Lord and to learn around your word Lord and and to receive a greater revelation of your word so we just ask at this time Lord that you just take everything and put it under your control Lord just may each person get themselves out of the way Lord and prepare themselves for the word Lord may we get the things of the cares of the world and put them aside Lord our jobs or or our families or family matters or house home matters or financial matters or whatever it may be Lord may we just put those things aside so we can focus on you this evening and we can hear something from you Lord Lord we know what this

when I was a younger kid and I used to listen this song I used to say well I am a Christian I am a Christian but then when I learned what the word Christian means it means to be christ-like I realized that the song is saying Lord I want to be christ-like in my life and I know that even though we are Christians we could always be more christ-like and and I now it has a whole new being than me because I'm like Lord I want to be christ-like I want to be more like you I want to have your mind your heart so let's just say it again and remember that we're Christian we know we're Christians here

[Music] Lord I believe all things are possible lord I feel ease Assisi Jesus easy [Music] Jesus oh [Music] [Music] don't waste your tonight good to be back in the house of the Lord as brother David is working on these let's go to Isaiah chapter 40 we dealt with the three sons in brother branham's ministry we put those three signs under the first the second and the third pole was the highest octave because Paul in the book of Corinthians say that let me show you a more excellent way he gave the gift of the Spirit than before chapter 13 he say an excellent way not a way a little bit more higher the top so we want to go through the top once we are connected with the top then automatically the gift takes place everybody clear Isaiah 40 chapter 3 if you dare you can say Amen but David you want this to be here okay no problem give me a minute let's switch this slowly so everybody can get it hopefully that'll be clear can everybody see this good or you or me sweep it up everybody good okay praise the Lord okay Isaiah 40 verse 3 the voice of him the choirs in the wilderness you might be seated so now you know more horrible you know the triples you know the cloud you know all of that by the scripture this is one of the major problem Pentecostal and some people in a message here we're going to be dealing with John the Baptist because in Malachi 4 we got John the Baptist over there and usually it's easily confused between Boojum the Baptist and brother Branham so we want to take John the Baptist and clear him up completely so when we come with brother Branham it's gonna be easier everybody clear ok the voice of him that cries in the wilderness so that voice we know it's not speaking about just a voice it's a person there's a person that is going to be crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord so this person or this voice this person which is refer as a voice his mission is to prepare the way of the Lord it's a Ministry of preparation prepare you the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God everybody clear let's go to Malachi chapter 3 we're dealing mainly with John the Baptist I wish the whole church was there and I hope they're going to be watching this after because it's very important for young people yeah very important denomination this is where they got a trouble with the ministry of brother Branham Malachi 3 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible say be Lord I will send my messenger in Isaiah 40 he was the voice which was referred to a person in Malachi 3 that person is referred to as a messenger how do you know brother Steven that this messenger of Malachi 3 is the same person as as they are 40 remember the one in Isaiah 40 had to prepare the way of the Lord everybody clear you need your Bible you say I will send my messenger and he shall do what prepare what the way you can see the same thing here so this one also have a mission to prepare the way the way of who the way of the Lord that's the reason why this person of Isaiah 40 is the same person as a Malachi 3 you will wreak on us or you detect them by the ministry or their characteristic are you there in Isaiah 40 he is called a voice but in Malachi 3 he is called a messenger remember don't be caught up by the name don't be caught up by the form remember to look at the characteristic or the works or the ministry the same person is preparing the way of the Lord he said he shall prepare the way before me and their Lord so the way is for the Lord so the most important things is the Lord who is the Lord the Lord whom you seek so somebody will be seeking this load and the scripture say seek and you shall find so if somebody is gonna seek him somebody must find him are we there clear so the Lord whom you seek we know that the Jews and the Samaritan were waiting for the Messiah so right here this scripture is telling you that he belongs to the Jews and he belongs to the Samaritan so this should be the first coming of the Lord because Gentile we are outside of the Commonwealth of Israel we didn't know no God are you there but the Jewish who are waiting for the Messiah based on what Moses told them according to the trona meet up to a team that the Lord your God will send you a prophet like unto me and Samaritan being in connection with the Jews also we're waiting if you go to John chapter 4 you're going to remember the woman at the world also was waiting for the Messiah so the Jews and the Messiah and the Samaritan were the ones seeking for the Messiah so the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come this is something that I want you to keep shall suddenly come so the coming of the Lord is something that is sudden it is quick and then when he comes it's quick they were all together in the upper room and suddenly you see that okay the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple so the interest of the Lord in the temple is going to be suddenly it's going to be quick so who is this Lord and who is this temple that the Lord will get into it everybody dear even the messenger of the Covenant so this Lord is also referred as the messenger of the Covenant so we know that the message of the Covenant was nothing else but the pillar of fire are you there that follow the children of Israel I have quotes on these so this Lord this messenger when he entered in the temple is going to be sudden but before he enter into the temple there is somebody preparing this in other word the prophecy of this man is coupled or connected or hooked with the event that the Lord getting into his temple suddenly this man is not only responsible to prepare the way for the Lord but this man his ministry is connected to the entrance of the Lord in his temple suddenly everybody clear even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come so we're talking about the coming of the Lord behold he shall come say the Lord of hosts let's go to John chapter 1 verse 40 and then we will be praying strongly encourage if you may support go back and look it up we are building one step at a time John chapter 1 verse 40 everybody there one of the two which heard John speak and followed him water Robert is going to be nine and nine give me signal yes sir thank you one of the two which heard John speak followed him was Andrew simon Peters brother he first found his own brother Simon and say to him we have what found is it clear the Lord whom he said write sick Anusha so we have found somebody was sitting him we have found the Messiah that's the Lord which is being interpreted the crust and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said you are Simon the son of Jonah you shall be called Cephas which is interpreted as stone the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and find Philip and say to him follow me now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter Philip finds Nathaniel and said to him we have found everybody clear twice again we have found the Lord whom you seek now it's now they are seeking but they are funding the Lord we have found him of whom Moses in the law the tirana me chapter 18 and profit not only did Moses was the one that prophesied by the prophet remember in Luke chapter 24 when Jesus met the disciple on the road to make Myles the Bible say he started by Moses and prophet are we clear who Moses and the Prophet did write who is that person Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph was his name in the Old Testament no but because they were seeking the Lord seek and you shall find everybody clear now let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you again for your grace your love and your mercy father you have given us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed Word of the our Lord you spoke in your word that's where the carcass is Lord dare the ego gather father we don't want anything else but the fresh carcass of the unfailing body Word of the son of man Lord your children were at work some has been going through many things and many obstacles some are tired in the body somehow battling or having many or have many problem Lord father but despite all that the devil was trying to throw in their way Lord father you opened a way for them to be able to be in service to night Lord whether here or on the streamline Lord Father I pray that's the anointing of the holy spirit come to night Lord and may you minister to each one Lord father Lord Jesus Christ may you touch those that are sick and may you heal them Lord may you strengthen those that are having trouble Lord father may be freed those dire problem in their home Lord father may you give solution to your children because our only source of solution is you you are the answer to all our problems all before we were even born into this world father you die the ED across Lord you pay Lord the penalty for the atonement which contain all the blessings of your children Lord and you gave such precious word Lord coming out of your lips you say it is finished father we accepted that atonement and we are believing that you're the same yesterday today and forever you the unchanging God because your words spoke to us that you don't change may the Holy Spirit may the inside the teacher may he comes and clarify enlighten and teach your word to your children Lord may you stabilize this church Lord may you bring us more and more in unity not with one another but more than so with your father we will buek every demonic spirit lured away from this place may your word be free and may your children be fed to night Lord father as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you once again we are continuing with the unchanging pattern of God Malachi for now we are dealing with the person of John the Baptist before we drop into brother Branham if we go straight with brother Branham we're not going to be able to see exactly what's going on when we deal with John the Baptist John the Baptist is completely connected to the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham say in the discernment of the Spirit I gave this quote before I'm just going to give it now to kind of refresh our memory that if you if we will notice the motives and objective of the Old Testament prophet there man had one objective and that was Jesus Christ amen and they had one thing that the whole team of the Old Testament walls build around the coming Messiah that why when Jesus met the disciple in the road to Emmaus he could point to them starting for Moses all the way through all the Prophet that all of them spoke about the first coming of Jesus Christ they did not go out and do things just for money or for fame in other word their motive was not for fame for popularity or he was not to make money the gospel is not a money scheme the gospel is not a platform to build their popularity the gospel is to point the people to Jesus Christ they had one thing they were anointed with the Spirit of God so if we think we are not dead with the spirit God we must be doing the same thing that I did and they predicted the coming Messiah and those men were so anointed with the spirit until day sometime acted like the spirit that was within them they spoke seemingly of themselves watch how the Spirit of God made them man out in other word they were so in tune with the spirit until when David begin to say my God my God why has thou forsaken me if you look at their that you think David is speaking about himself but David was so inclined with the anointing of God until he begin to act like the Lord Jesus Christ and if we have the Holy Spirit and we are so connected with our husband that's what we will be acting just like our husband first chapter paragraph 68 he say now we notice that all those prophet and all they say about him everything come to true because he was the theme of the Old Testament Jesus the Messiah coming Messiah was what every prophet looked from Adam that's why he started for Moses because Moses have the father first book of the Bible so Adam also Moses in other word Genesis in Moses Exodus in Moses Leviticus in Moses numbers in Moses Deuteronomy in Moses that's why brother Branham say Adam if you read the scripture didn't say Adam they say Moses Adam was in Moses because Moses was the one that clam higher and so Adam from Adam to Malachi every prophet spoke of the coming of the Lord each one put his pardon because he was anointed of God that is all he could speak of nothing else but Jesus Christ everybody clear now if you recall when we establish the platform between Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah and we in that pardon going back and forth because we are dealing with the unchanging God God does not change so at the end of every dispensation there is always a resurrection and coming of the Lord a resurrection and a rapture so when the Old Testament started he started in a Garden of Eden but at the end of the dispensation of the law Jesus Christ came as a baby through the virgin and then after Jesus died he rose again there was a resurrection of the Old Testament sin and there was also a rupture that took place so at the end of the dispensation there is always a coming of the Lord a resurrection and a rupture so the first coming had its resurrection and it's rapture and the second coming also at the end of the dispensation of the grace which is the Gentile dispensation we found out that there going to be another resurrection and they're also going to be another rapture which we call the second coming of the Lord and when the Spirit of God goes back to the Jewish people there will be another coming of Jesus Christ or in the first coming he came to redeem his brother in the second coming he came to take his blood and on the third coming he's coming on a white horse rather with his broad but still a dark coming also there is a resurrection and there is also a rupture of Moses and Elijah and 144,000 everybody clear so now when we establish this we found out that Jesus Christ started with Moses all the way to the Prophet and then unto himself now let's take Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 we are loading the scripture just like a vaccine we don't want anybody to have a problem in this church again with the Ministry of brother Branham Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 if you dare you can say a man where is the Lord for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before your face which shall prepare your way before you is referring to as eya 40 that was our scripture everybody clear this voice here right okay and verse 11 verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist I will come back to the scripture notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he are you there when Jesus look at John he said among all that are born of a woman nobody is greater than him and John was the messenger to the first coming of Jesus Christ now but the least in the kingdom is greater than John what about the second John died have to come for the second coming everybody clear verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force for all the profit this is where I'm going to quench it Moses also included for all the prophets and the law Moses write prophesied until John so now Jesus is giving us the beginning of the law all the way to the end of the law because when Jesus Christ died at the cross the law the Levitical priesthood was completely destroyed mother are you there if you study the Old Testament you found out that he was not accepted for the high priest to tear his clothes down you know that was a high priest his clothes he is completely disqualified so the Levitical priesthood was running all the way to Caiaphas but when they brought Jesus Christ to Caiaphas and Caiaphas asked Jesus class he said we heard so many people talk about you we want to hear from yourself who do you say you are and when Jesus was declared to Caiaphas who he was Caiaphas could not contain himself by prophesy by the anointing of God Caiaphas took his clothes and rent them completely he was assemble showing that the Levitical priesthood was completely disqualified and the Melchizedek Priesthood was now introduced that's why brother Branham saying when Jesus Christ was crucified the Levitical priesthood died completely so Jesus now is telling us that the Levitical priesthood started with the law by Moses but it ended some way and the one that put a stop to the priesthood is John the Baptist everybody clear so far he said that for all the profit and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it so this is not for everybody if somebody rejected you or no problem are there if you will receive it this is a larger which was to come everybody clear so now Jesus not only is he referring to John as the stop or the last step of the Old Testament but Jesus Christ is calling John Elijah so now we have Moses at the beginning of the dispensation of the law but the law ended with our new larger this Elijah here was our reference so we know how the spirit of Elijah operate and under this reference when you have been studying we found out that Elijah interact with the Jews and he also interacted with the Jetta by John the Baptist was a Jew but yet he was the one that completes or that closed the door to the Old Testament dispensation everybody clear so far praise the Lord then when we drop down to the church edges we found out that brother Branham explained to us that Paul was our modern Moses our there then when we went back to our type over there we found out that there was an interaction of Elijah with the Gentile through the crow and through the woman Sarepta the widow woman showing that the spirit of Elijah will also go to the gentle and through the sills we found out that that spirit anointed Elijah to go to the Gentile when the widow was already under the anointing of death which was the pale horse rather which was showing that Elijah going to the genta will be Elijah in the last edge of the jente which is the age of loud ISA where the pale horse rather is riding on the land are you there so we have another Elijah over there but Elijah is not a Jew that Elijah is a Gentile everybody clear then we find down there that there is Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah again and back and forth we have Moses and Elijah going to the Jewish people everybody clear so far praise the Lord now if you notice you find that Moses was a Jew we explained that Elijah himself a Jew with splendor John the Baptist a Jew we explained that Paul a Jew we explained that there the to Moses and Elijah over there are Jews and when they coming over there after before if then we go over there the one handling here is the gentle but we want to deal first with John the Baptist but the pattern I want you to understand here is the beginning of a dispensation start with Moses and he ends with Elijah start with Moses and that with John the Baptist then the Messiah is coming then there is a resurrection and there is a rupture and this year started with Paul our modern Moses but at the end there is a Gentile Elijah after that Elijah there is an introduction of the Messiah and then there is a resurrection and a rupture and then when we go back to the Jewish people we found again Moses and Elijah and at their end there is also a coming of the Lord and there is a resurrection and our rapture this is where we explain to you that the name of Billy power has something going on Billy which was talking about brother Branham and Paul which was talking about the Apostle Paul and that name was not given by brother Branham he was the angel of the Lord that taught brother Branham call your son Billy Paul brother Branham say Billy from his name Billy but don't be caught up with the name don't be caught up with the form and Paul he was Moses and Elijah hooked together and if you notice you found out that the name of brother Branham came first are you there the name of when you go with Billy Paul you find out that brother Branham said this Paul was referring to the Apostle Paul which we know Apostle Paul on our dispensation was our Moses and brother Branham said Billy was referring to himself are you there which was speaking about the spirit of a larger but when the angel of the Lord gave the name he put brother Branham first and he put Paul last but when their fulfillment of that happened in a normal life we found out that the one that came first was Moses and the one that came last was brother branham why is that you can look at your scripture in the book of Genesis when tomorrow you clear when Tamar got pregnant it with Judah everybody clear do you know that story Tamar got pregnant with Judah and Tamar have twins are you there and when when it was the time that Tamar have to give birth the first one him push his hand up are you then coming out from the womb and when he was coming out from the womb the wise woman that was there put a scarlet thread upon the hand knowing that this is the firstborn but for some reason instead of the firstborn to come out here we treat his hand back again and the younger one came out are you there and brother branham say the reason why that happened is because this first one had the right to intention he doesn't come out first he only claim his right and he goes back up again then he led the second one coming then he is going to come up later so that's why the angel recognized that the one connected with redemption in the end time by the opening of the seals is brother Branham so his lamb must be first but when he comes to birth Paul must come first then at the end time they wonder have this collar trade brother Branham will be coming later and bringing redemption further driver everybody here for his the Lord now we started for Moses ending up by Elijah Moses Elijah Moses Elijah because God does not change clear now let's dig with John the Baptist his name is John the Baptist let's go on John chapter one you if you dare you can say man on chapter one verse 19 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites for we get into this I'm going to ask you a question Jesus Christ told us that John the Baptist was who Elijah who say that let every word of a man be a lie but only God's Word is the truth does Jesus like everything that comes from the mouth of Jesus is true so John the Baptist is Elijah everybody here I want to you to get that pretty good now let's go back to the scripture and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to ask him who are you it doesn't mean they didn't know his name they knew his father and everything they just asking him who are you according to the scripture I and he confessed and deny not but confess I am NOT the Christ in other words when they approached him they thought he was the Messiah because they were sitting the Messiah so every time they see a move going on the elect are watching they're like hey what is going on is this the Messiah or not are you there and John tell them no no no no no I am NOT the Messiah the brother branham say he's not the Messiah yes let's drop down and they asked him what then are you Elijah direct question and he said I am my brother John the Baptist or the lie we need to close the Bible and throw the Bible away how many times did I ask a brother branham are you a prophet and he say I am NOT ah if you reject brother branham you need to reject the Bible I did the spirit of Elijah when he came on Elijah when they asked him by the people who are you he say I am NOT Elijah it was Jesus dubs indicated him that you are Elijah the Prophet John said no brother anima your prophet no you see now and he say I'm not are you the Prophet the Messiah insisting again and he answered no how many believe Amos was a prophet how many believe that the Prophet Amos he was a true prophet rod random say Amos was a true prophet you believe that now keep your fingers here take Emma's chapter 7 we are clearing the smoke we are clearing the smoke Amos chapter 7 are you there so young people when they come they say hey brother Branham say he was not a prophet himself just take this Bible you say hey John the Baptist say he was not Elijah and Jesus called him Elijah what are we going to do to this are you there let's go to mmo's chapter 7 verse 14 are you there brother Branham say Amos was a true prophet and we all know that the word of the Lord came to ammos because the Lord the word of the Lord always comes to the Prophet I am also who are you verse 14 everybody there then answered who Amos and say to Amasya I was no how can a prophet say he is not a prophet you see now I was no prophet neither was i as prophet son but I was a herdsmen and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit and was a true prophet of God telling the people that he is not a prophet and when brother Branham say I am NOT a prophet you got a problem with that you see now let's go back to John chapter 1 that's a vaccine John chapter 1 verse 21 where we were if you dare you can say man and they asked him what then are you Elijah and he say I'm not are you the Prophet and he answered no then say dead to him who are you are you there that we may give an answer to them that send us what say you of your self now John is going to be answering everybody clear now back to the scripture as they are 40 he said he said I am the voice so this person this voice is John the Baptist I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord say the prophet Isaiah everybody clear and then which were said where of the Pharisee and they asked him and said to him why baptize you then if you be not Christ nor Elijah needed a prophet do you see who was asking him they of what the Pharisee denomination he planted them to Isaiah 40 so by the scripture today you see that Isaiah 40 verse 3 is John the Baptist we clear on that all right let's take Matthew 11 verse 7 where we where again but now we want to start from verse 7 we started from 10 now we're gonna start a little bit up if you dare you can say Amen this is the first scripture that we read and we identify that it's John the Baptist now we are on the second one now and as they departed verse 7 Jesus begins to say to the multitude concerning who John so this is Jesus talking what went you out into the wilderness to see so John was in the wilderness it reads shaken with the wind but what went you out to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold a that were soft gray trim clothing are in King's houses but what went you out to see a prophet so Jesus identified John as a prophet everybody clear we going by the Bible not in the zodiac not in the pyramid in the Bible okay yeah I say to you and more than a prophet so John was not just a prophet but more than a prophet why was John more than a prophet you need a prophet to know why John was more than a prophet brother Branham in a true sign that is overlooked he said but what one I you to see what Branham is reading the same scripture a prophet listen yeah and I say unto you and more than a prophet yes sir what was he say he's more than a prophet he was a prophet plus he was the messenger of that we got that clear second coat God hiding himself in simplicity I can give you more I just choose to so we can move on so when you listen to your tape yourself when you cut when you say I remember are you there now why was he more than a prophet he was the messenger of the Covenant remember the lesson of the Covenant is God and the messenger of the Covenant is also John if you go to Revelation then you find out that there is a messenger down and there is a messenger coming up one is coming ganas de Maria angel and one is on the earth it is a son of man a son of men but one son of men reveal this son of man are we clear okay now he was the messenger of the Covenant sure he was to bridge the way between law and grace he was the key stone brother branham say every single prophet spoke or prophesy about Jesus Christ Moses spoke he never seen him maybe in vision as a a spoke in vision Abraham spoke all of them in vision but what one I'm saying when John the Baptist came he was not only prophesying by John went to the people that this is he behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he was not just prophesy but he actually identified the lamb by pointing him straight ahead and he was the Keystone that bridges in other word he was the yellow light you know there is a green there is a red and a yellow before green goes to red he passes through yellow is the yellow yard that is combining the two dispossession are you there when the light is yellow you can still pass and you don't have any trouble when he turned red then the dispensation of the law is finished but John was that's what they call an overlapping are you there the Keystone getting low English who came together and where the past under event Gentile either even the Centurion Roman could come and get healing even the sorrowful Eastern woman she tried in a Jewish way son of David son of David son of David then a resonation struck is a son of God he was not the dispensation of son of God yet but because the light was yellow so are you there when the light turned completely red eek aboard to Israel the glory of the Lord left there and went to the gentle everybody clear so far so John was more than a prophet let's continue now for this is he we already read this that is called we already read this already this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before your face which shall prepare the way before you so now we found out that Jesus is identifying to us that Malachi 3 is rule John the Baptist and we explained to you on the teaching of the web shift that a person may have multiple scripture Isaiah 40 Malachi 3 all of that and Malachi 4 you look at the scripture it's still talking about John the Baptist that's why jesus also have this prophet this prophet this prophet this prophet and you put it together and brother Branham also have revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Zechariah 14 John 2:12 all of that you put together you Fonda it's a wave shift are you there everybody clear so he was greater than all his name is Elijah the Prophet we already read that now let's go to mark chapter 1 we are dealing with John the Baptist we want to clear him completely so when we drop with brother Branham is clear mark chapter 1 now we found out that in John chapter 1 under Baptist say he was as a ax folding we found out the malla in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus say he was not only as their 40 he was also Malachi 3 okay now let's take these two and put them together are you there mark chapter 1 verse 1 the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God as it is written in the prophet behold I send my messenger before your face which shall prepare your way before you who's that one Malachi 3 everybody clear we clear there look at the second verse you find them together look at the second verse the voice of the one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his paths straight so they put Malachi 3 and they put Isaiah 40 the combined mark a pastor in Knox of the team put them together for you are you there then the next verse he said John you see did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for remission of what sin so we have three scripture 1 John's am Isaiah 40 the second one Jesus say he's Malachi 3 but mark say this and this let me make your life easy I put him together each one person everybody clear now alright now let's go when John the Baptist come he's introducing who the Lord that's what we saw here they say the Lord whom you seek and we found out every time the find him they go that we have found them we have found are you there even the woman at the world went ahead and say hey there is somebody who told me is not this the Messiah in other words I have found the Messiah because they were seeking the Messiah everybody clear so far but they say the Lord whom you seek now who is the Lord take second Corinthians chapter 3 the Bible interpreting the Bible and don't say brother Steven say or our pastor say no the Bible say brother Branham say everybody second Corinthians chapter three are you there verse 17 everybody clear now though can you say it aloud now their Lord is the spirit so right here when they refer to the Lord they're talking about the Spirit of God entering into a temple is it clear but the interest of the Spirit of the Lord must be in the Ministry of John because we know journeys Isaiah 40 and Malachi 3 everybody clear okay now the Lord is the spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty freedom everybody there we don't want denominational everybody there now if the Lord is the spirit enter the temple so we know that at the dedication of the temple of Salomon in the Old Testament the pillar of fire came enter that temple but when John the Baptist came the temple will already have the anointing of the Spirit through Solomon and the tabernacle have the anointing of the Spirit under Moses but John is coming and the Bible said that the Spirit of the Lord will enter a temple is he going to enter the tabernacle which he always the anointed is he gonna enter the Temple of Solomon which temple is the spirit entering him are we clear now let's take at chapter 7 you should be able to sit with somebody and begin to show them 1 2 3 4 and you bring them to church and we baptize them and we pray for them and they get the Holy Ghost are you there up to chapter 7 if you dare you can say Amen verse 44 our Father had the tabernacle number 1 there was a tabernacle and we know that the tabernacle was dedicated under Moses when they put the Ark of the Covenant the anointing of God came our Father had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking to Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen he was made according to the fashion of heaven which also our Father that came after brought in with Joshua that Jesus is Joshua Joshua into the possession of the Gentile whom God drove out before the face of our Father to the days of David in other words they left Egypt they went to the desert now they in the promised land are you there who found the favor David before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob but Solomon built him a house so we are moving from a tabernacle to a temple the Temple of Solomon but we know this was anointed the pillar of fire came this also was anointed the pillar of fire came but which temple is the Lord which temple is the Spirit of God which temple is the anointing of God going to enter suddenly verse 47 but Solomon built him a house verse verse 48 however habit the Messiah do are not in temple made with oh my god in other word they time for this and the time for this is already finished there should be another temple they have built the most high to have not in temple made with hand as he said I says the prophet verse 49 heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what has with you built me say the Lord or what is the place of my rest God had the tabernacle he moved from the tabernacle to the temple now God is still looking for a house he said which house are you going to build me you bring me the tabernacle are not satisfied I was not in peace I was not arrested you built me the temple are not satisfied what house will you build me so that I can have rest but the house must not be built again by man hand because the first one trouble the second one trouble I don't want any man hands house I want a house that is made by God himself where is the house Hebrew chapter 10 please don't cut me on my time let me finish John the Baptist everybody there we will preach preach preach like Peter and suddenly the Holy Spirit would drop him there were a hundred and twenty people in the upper room did anybody miss the Holy Ghost so there is a possibility for an entire trade to be filled with the Holy Spirit are you there in the hands of Cornelius Cornelius call his entire house and call his friend the Bible said when the Holy Ghost kept all of them did anybody miss it so this time let's pray for all of us to receive the Holy Ghost Hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 if you dare you can say Amen we're for when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and offering you would not but our body Oh a body have you prepared me this was a tabernacle this is a temple now we are talking about a body brother Steven is a body a temple in burnt offering and sacrifice for sin you have no pleasure in other word God doesn't like again what is going on in the temple he's tired of it are you there job 2 verse 10 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all so now we move from Tabernacle to temple but God still say I need the rest I need to ask some boy but they prepare God a body and we trying to find whether the body is the temple or not clear ceases Adi let's go to John chapter 2 what we do on Chapter two if you dare you can say Amen verse 19 I want you all to see this yourself are you there Jesus answering and say to them Jesus came out from the temple he say here they were looking at the temple which temple the Temple of Solomon you see the transition Jesus is here he's not talking about this is he now Jesus is fed the temple they say Lord look at this it's so great it's so beautiful it's this and this and when Jesus came out he said destroy this temple the temple so everybody said oh he's talking about the Temple of Solomon sacrifice and offering I don't have any more pleasure day because you become denomination destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up also a temple will be destroyed and raised up in three days what is that temple the Lord whom you seek will enter into the temple suddenly okay verse 20 then say the Jews forty and six years in other words Solomon took forty and six years was this temple built they still looking at the Temple of Solomon they say huh you they took 46 years and you say three days you want to erect this temple forty and six years was this temple in a building and you will hear it up in three days watch verse 21 but he spoke of the temple of his oh my god so the body of the Lord is a and according to the Ministry of John the Baptist the Lord which is the spirit will enter suddenly into he already entered in the tabernacle he already entered in the temple of Salomon but now the Spirit of the Lord will enter into the body and John the Baptist must be there at the river of Jordan let's go with this a little father I wish we could get on this lesson a little further down there he said this Tabernacle he said brother Branham Solomon built him a tabernacle but the most high the scripture gave you do LF not in the house made both hand but L do you see how brother Branham Poole description put the scripture and put he's taking Ebru and that I gave you and he took out and he who come together I know that's how I make my slide so he doesn't come from my head are you there by the body has that prepared me when Solomon built their temple oh brother Branham say Tabernacle Solomon never built the tabernacle you got your correction here so no worry when Solomon built the temple Jehovah he is a good one here is a good one hallelujah what is wrong with brother Branham whatever Ana begin to scream hallelujah what's wrong that caught just right in exploration structure at random he said thank you thank the Lord for that here is a revelation just fresh right now when brother Branham took the scripture this scripture put him together God struck a revelation and what I want to begin to scribble he say you are going together brother Branham we are all so excited tell us what is the revelation now brother Branham is going to tell us he says when Solomon built the temple and he was dedicated God came into the temple into a we already explained that is that right and when Jesus class was dedicated to God on the river of Jordan God the spirit John chapter 4 do Jesus thought the woman at the well God is a spirit right whether God came down and dwell in Jesus Christ he is Jehovah Emin confession of sin always had to look to Al the temple confession of sin have to look to Christ in other word we're now confessing to a temple in Jerusalem but our temple now is in heaven are you there there is the temple of God God you are in Christ there it is now you believe he's your don't you never thought of that before it's an inspiration that struck him are you there alright now let's take mark chapter 1 I hope I'm not it's not tired to read those scripture but men shall not believe by bread alone mark chapter 1 verse 10 are you there we're talking about the Lord the Spirit God entering into the temple now we understand that the Spirit of God will enter into a body but it's going to be sudden quick are you there mark chapter 10 chapter 1 verse 10 and immediately this is John taking Jesus Christ are you there and put him in order right and when he pulled Jesus Christ immediately not slowly immediately the Lord gets there suddenly immediately coming out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit here back again the Spirit is the idea he saw the spirit like a dove that's the form the spirit took because God is amorphous he can change form but the spirit in that particular event took the doves the Dove and the lamb are joining together heaven an Elfa kissing either they spirit like a dove descending upon him how immediately who's doing this John the Baptist before the messenger preparing the way he is preparing the way of the Lord but when he prepared the way under his ministry the Lord the Spirit of the Lord will enter into a body the body of Jesus Christ quickly we clear now let's go to Luke chapter three Luke chapter three verse 21 if you dare you can say Amen now when all the people were baptized so they were taking people baptized out that does out everybody there he came to pass that Jesus also be baptized and pray so when they were baptizing Jesus he was praying you see keys in the scripture are you there and playing the heaven was opened and the Holy Ghost which is the Lord the Spirit of the Lord descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said you are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased God was looking for a temple God was looking for a tabernacle but under the ministry of john he's going to present the Messiah but the Lord the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost in the form of a dog will enter the body of Jesus Christ suddenly are you there that's why John is Malachi 3 John is as a ax Ferdie brother branham the positions the believers position across what did he speak of the Lord Jesus Christ for God then came to his temple in a pillar of fire we know it said our form when the temple was made a worship place for all Israel to come together the pillar of fire came in over the great 70 foot wings of the angels that's the Temple of Solomon went back over along the angels on the wall in other word he travel going there into the Holy of Holies went back to the mercy seat which was the throne where the two great 14-foot brass Caribbeans set with their wings pitched to one another and set up rested a God coming to his temple to be worshipped from the temple where the blood outside made an atonement then when crust came on earth when he was baptized in Jordan as the washing of the lamb and the Brazile ever noticed then John bear record seeing the Spirit of God like a dove coming from above and he said on him and went into him God coming to his never over here ah now you are men and women most of you and you are God's children not all over look it remember that we are supposed to have these things they are supposed to happen in this day in this hour that we are living in this is the hour just before the coming of the Messiah that we supposed to be an announcement come forth from God let me drop behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord now you understand what it means whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple you know now what it means even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight in the Lord he shall come say the Lord vertebra damn explain this messenger he said that was John and nothing the coming of Jesus and he came to the temple exactly what he said the messenger of the Covenant the angel you see that was in the wilderness with the disciple of will with Israel do you believe he was the messenger so brother branham is again confirming to you that the Lord God enter into his temple how quickly the Lord enter to his temple and when you get both of this in John chapter 1 31 and 24 you wanna put those together and the next time part 16 God richly bless you [Applause] let's then we should be able to preach or to exhort somebody about John the Baptist let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love and again your mercy father we can never enforce eyes on those word Lord you moved from the tabernacle and you went into the temple and from the tempo you didn't stop there because the temple only provided a substitute for seen the Old Testament seen were just covered Lord that's why they were held in paradise but father you move further because you are completed in three Lord Tabernacle temple and then the body of Jesus Christ always completed in three and the third is always perfection and you are our perfection and the Father you're coming down provided the perfect lamb for our sacrifice Lord father and now we don't have to look through a tabernacle or through a temple Lord but we have Lord Father another temple of God that is living Lord that was raised up in three days and that is sitting on the throne of God as a memorial Lord interceding for us father Lord we thank you for opening our eyes laws and stabilizing us Lord Father we know that your work did not stop there because your prophet told us that the first
