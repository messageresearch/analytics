you continue to remember him in prayer he lost his uncle so remember the family in prayer he could be in florida but by the grace of god he's here so there is something pulling amen you know where he comes from right you were there on sunday you know where you're coming if you don't know yet that's a problem amen how many are behind okay who else everybody on board only couple people okay praise be the name of the lord hallelujah let's go to our scripture tonight lord's willing i believe this coming sunday is the building fund right by my offering so don't get tired we still got stuff to do we're already home got a lot to do if you're there you can say a man wow somebody's tired if you're there you can say a man okay finally [Laughter] wow thank you sister would be hard like what are we reading psalm 125. can everybody see this board brother email what did you can you put it where it's supposed to be please you will need your bible and you need the board sometime i make it easy on you so i put scriptures and code there so we keep moving moving moving sometime old version amen some 125 few people turning their pages we already left the earth with somewhere in eternity amen so this will prepare you better because once we get into the angelic being you're gonna see where you fought the devil you didn't fight him here the origin it's a problem 125 verse 3. we already spoke about this for the road of the wicked shall not rest upon the lord of the righteous you already know that because god doesn't want the righteous to touch things that are they're not supposed to touch you might be seated lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity so at the beginning god tolerated a little bit but after a while god cannot tolerate anymore there got to be a separation the wheat and the tares have to separate amen because god can't tolerate anymore that mixed multitude causes the true seed to disgust man through influence amen we say do good o lord to those that be good and to them that are upright in their heart david you remember his prayer last sunday what a prayer now watch verse five as for such as turn aside to the crooked way you see that the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity so in that mix in that mixture there are some people that would turn assad and go into their crooked way at the beginning they were part of you but after a while they're gonna turn aside and go to the crooked way and as they go into the crooked way the lord will put them in other words bind them together with the workers of iniquity amen he say as for such as turn aside to the crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity god will combine them together you you you put them in one plate why do you combine them remember they are bound to be burned amen it depends on where you came from hallelujah but peace shall be upon israel and we know that israel to the bride is god's redemptive name everybody clear let's go to john chapter 8. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord john chapter 8. you will need your bible today if you're there you can say amen john chapter 8 verse 31 we navigate this over and over then jesus then said jesus to the jews not the gentile remember he's talking to the jews everybody is jew it's not it's no more an egyptian among the amalekites it is israel within israel amen but not all israel is israel then say jesus to those jews which believe on him if you continue in my word then you are my disciple indeed let me repeat it again so somebody get it then say jesus to those jews plural which believe on him so many people believe on him many people several people many people many people believe on him on him all of them were jews many people so when jesus looked at him according to the way we see salvation if everybody that believes on the lord jesus christ shall be saved so if everybody believed on him guess what they all are saved but jesus didn't stop there jesus now unfold something that is connected to the origin everybody clear now jesus said that to everybody that believe on him come on if you continue in my word so there are certain people that will believe but they're not going to be able to continue in the world believing it's not a problem but remaining in the world that is the problem believe the message everybody a lot of people all over the world in africa and europe in united states a lot of people believe the message no problem amen but jesus is saying that if you continue in my word so there is two things here there is a believing and continuing in the word in other words continuing in what you believe that's the key because we say everybody that believe on jesus christ they are sons and daughters of god they are disciples of jesus christ jesus said uh-uh that's not the way it is if you believe that's the first step amen but if you continue in the world everybody then are you my disciple indeed so the true disciple of jesus christ church this is a different type of preaching my brother we're gonna take those laws further out amen i'm reading the same bible you are reading i know some of them when he comes across the prophet you wonder like is this true or not we're reading the same message on the board and the same bible it's just strong meat anybody so the true disciple of jesus christ is somebody who believes but does not stop on believing it's somebody who believes and who will continue in the message that he believe on qualification for true disciple is somebody who believes not only i believe the message but you must continue in the world not continue among the message believer because everybody can continue to hang out but continue in the world in other words the more time takes the deeper you getting into your relationship with jesus christ if yesterday you were 10 today it's 20 tomorrow 30 until one of this day is gonna reach a hundred percent and before you know it we're leaving to meet the lord into the air amen blessed be the name of the lord let's jump to verse 37 hallelujah i know that you are abraham's seeds remember all of them jews but not israel not all israelis it's those israel by faith everybody and know that you are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in water so when you look at them there is no receiver for the world they are in the world they are jews they believe the lord jesus christ they're following him amen but not everybody have that absorbent to remember on sunday not everybody have that absorbent of the holy ghost blessed be the name of the lord job to verse 44. i'm skipping because you already know this back and forth 44 you are of your father who remember on sunday we got the children of god and the children of the devil two kingdom you are offering of the father of your father the devil diabolos and the last of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and and what the devil used to be a believer satan was the original angel of light remember on sunday but satan cannot continue but here he cannot abide there is something on him that cannot make him grounded in the world amen he cannot remain and abide not in water jesus said my word or what so the word here is a truth and jesus is telling them that you are of your father who the devil and the characteristic of the devil is that the devil cannot continue in the truth the devil cannot remain in the truth so who's the true disciple amen and abode not in the truth because there is water no truth in water so for you to abide in truth what do you have to have is he complicated is he complicated let me go to the end and i'm going to come back amen so if today you are in this church you are in this church because you took a stand for something so if you took a stand for something what is in you okay let's read it back again you shall know and the truth sir and abide not in the truth because there is what no truth in him for you to abide in a truth you must have you must have a magnet for the other magnet too have you seen when you put to magnet if you move one this way what does the other one do you see the moving you see moving and the more you approach them at a certain time before you even the rapture amen one leaves its position and the other one leaves position and in the middle of the road the magnet and they buy not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of its own it's not somebody told him he generates that he birthed that amen for he is uh and the father of it that's why he can give birth to it what do you think his children will do let's go to john 15. many people believed jesus said believing it's not only the problem i want you to continue in the world that will tell me whether you are my disciple or not we found the devil when he started he could not abide in the word because there is nothing in the in the devil that is looking like the word amen blessed be the name of the lord in other words there is no true marriage john chapter 15. if you dare you can say amen verse one i am the truvine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me not outside of me in me remember on sunday every branch in me that bears not fruit he does water you see the mixture again so the sep is there right there the branch is ready amen the true van is there but there are many branches but there are certain branches even though they are connected to him yet they are unable to bear fruit amen you can produce another cane here make sense ken was a beast and a human here if it's a beast and a human there is no pregnancy because the link was already destroyed in them either you produce or you don't produce if you produce we know where you come from if you don't produce we also know where you came from because you are not compatible anybody clear every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away and every branch that bear fruit he does what he purges that he may bring forth more water why is one keep prospering and the other not amen i will touch this later on now you are clean i will touch on what has cleaned me now you are clean through the word which i have spoken to you oh so it's finished we are in him god spoke the word the word is a washing so when the word comes we already washed everybody's washed everybody believe so it's finished verse 4 abide in water why does jesus have to require you to abide in him because he already cleaned you up why so somebody is not going to be able to abide abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except a badge in the vine no more can you accept yeah bad in me everybody clear verse five i am devon you are the branches he that abides in me and i in him do you see that okay you in the word but that word is in you anybody clear the same bring forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abides not in me he is cast off as a branch and he's withered and men gather them and cast them into the you know who goes into the lake of fire and they are burn if you abide in me and my any question and my word abides in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done too why you don't ask because you believe not because you don't understand who you are amen if you abide in me and my words about in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done to you everybody clear job to verse 16 then we're going to pray you have not chosen me remember where we came from we're eternity ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you that's the bottom line this finish everything this take our responsibility away from you this tells you put your car in ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you indeed what do you know what that means i have brother i have predestinated i have programmed you i have manufactured you a certain way and put a program a software in you to do what and upon you that you should go and do water and bring forth water so who will produce the fruit you or the software that was put in you all you have to do is turn the computer on put on automatic pilot do you tell gps what to do once you put the address you activate gps do you tell him where to gps you need to go to the right you need to relax and listen to him because he's already ordained to take you to your destination sometimes he said go this way and maybe you never enter that avenue before but he said there is traffic over there do you want a detour go this way and that's your first time to enter that neighborhood but before you know it you back on track and you go back again to your destination oh my god you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and no then you predestinated you appointed you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should do what if it remain what kind of fruit is that it must be eternal and remain that whatsoever you ask of the father in my name he may sometimes give it to you amen that the father may give it to you any question many people believe on him amen but not only believing must continue or remain in the world the devil cannot abide in the truth or in the world amen jesus insisted that you must abide in me i clean you up but you must stay in the word amen but remember one thing i have chosen you you didn't choose me i am the one who chose you and i just want you to understand that even though i'm telling you about in the world just remember there is a software built up in you that should take care of that abiding you don't have to force yourself to abide in the world let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity tonight to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done whatever man that you give an ability can do and this is as far as i can go father may you move me again completely out of the way may you come and speak and minister to all of us lord bless us and make the devil his army his demons coved whatever it is delta or whichever strand it is father we cast them away from this place to the dry places in the name of jesus christ if any of your son or your daughter could be exposed unconsciously did not even know father may you heal them because in your house there is power angels are abiding there there is healing and father all things are possible to them that believe lord we are committing ourself unto the hand and this service in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as we continue we on part eight second death but origin six you don't understand origin you won't understand the second death amen on sunday we were already in the immortal reigns we were at the beginning way way way down in eternity and we found out that in eternity god created his children and god also created the devil and his children came out of god they have the very genes of god by the kingdom of the devil jesus spoke we saw it on sunday that the priests of this world have nothing in me there is no relationship no genetic code of the devil inside god amen he's a being that have a beginning and if he has a beginning you know he must have an end but the being on the other side have no beginning they are like melchizedek that's why you are preached under the order of melchizedek everybody clear so far now we are we understand here that our our existence started way in the immortal realms brother branham said in spiritual amnesia he said notice then every christian that is a real genuine christian was with him when the morning stars remember on sunday you know who are the morning stars anybody clear not the sun of the morning when the morning stars sung together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal realms so before you were born in mama and daddy here before even god created the world we already existed somewhere we just forgotten that we existed somewhere anybody clear we were identified in the immortal realms with god your true identification is back there 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him we saw it on sunday how we were playing eternity and father was sitting watching us climbing shouting screaming going left and right everybody clear if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy so our existence started way way way way way way back there into the mind of god anybody clear so far now the bible says here in matthew 10 verse 22 ye shall be headed of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be water so to get into the kingdom of god into the realm of the christian is not all you can enter but the problem is can you remain can you continue can you abide can you endure all the way to the end so the beginning is not really a problem but where are we going to the end that's what's going to determine what was really in you hallelujah jesus didn't say that the one who begins shall be saved he said the one who endure until the end shall be saved matthew 24 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall was called but he shall he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be what so how can you endure how can you remain how can you continue what keep you in hallelujah oh my god brother branham and you can mimic any of these things you can contact you can copy anything like a christian or you could cast out devils like a christian but the inside control tower come on the water the beginning come out the water the origin is not of god it shall never return to god so no matter how much religious you are what determines the outcome is your origin that's why we are insisting on the origin amen understanding your origin take all doubt away from you understanding your origin give you strength for the journey understanding your origin give you confidence and faith on who you are understanding your origin unleash a different kind of lifestyle that tells you that no matter what's going to happen you will never deviate from the word of god brother burnham says you understand it did not judas cast out devils did not care for us the one who condemned him and put him to death ever prophesy but he could not stay with the water amen caiaphas was a high priest judah was a minister among the minister of jesus christ they could not stay in the world and brother branham is saying that what keep you in the world it is really not you it is your origin take your bible let's go to first samuel chapter 2 hallelujah you need to understand these things then the second death have no power on you remember the scripture said the second death have no power on you why why he doesn't have power on you there got to be something that when the second death look at you he said not this one and then he deviated amen second samuel chapter two if you're there you can say amen verse 27 are you there let me build this slowly because it's wednesday then on sunday we're soaring verse 27 and there came a man of god you know the story about elah not elijah but ila the priest amen he was older he had children that were working in the temple and the children were misbehaving in the temple the bible says they were sleeping with the women that were coming into the congregation and the bible also said they were given to the offering when the people came to offer they were so greedy with the offering amen so right there there were three keys that brother branham says they have a problem with women they have a problem with money and they have a problem with popularity because they were all known anybody okay now a prophet come to speak to ila the father because he cannot discipline his children and there came a man of god to elah and said to him that says the lord did that plainly appear to the house of your father if you're a priest you come from liver remember on sunday did i plainly appear to the house of your father when they were in egypt in pharaoh's house and did i choose him out of all the tribe of israel to be my water we're talking about liver amen and truly preached you coming from aaron aaron was a child who was a leaver so we're talking about liver was chosen out of all the tribes and god pick up the house of aaron from liver to be priest about clear you need scripture you can see me later amen verse 28 and i did chose i i did choose him out of all the tribe of israel to be my priest to offer upon my altar to burn anses to wear an effort before me and did i give to the house of your father all the offering made by fire of the children of israel in other words i gave the priesthood to liver liver was the one that i have chosen to come and minister unto me and you are a descendant of liver now i'm talking to you ela verse 28 wherefore kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honor your sons above me to make yourself fat with the cheapest of all the offering of israel for my people in other words you took the love that you have for your children above my word because your children are misbehaving and you can correct them amen verse 30 wherefore the lord god of israel says i say indeed that your house we're starting now the house of who i'm gonna keep here and call this man he's called eli the priest god is talking to this priest who is a lineage of levad who was responsible for the tabernacle amen tabernacle i said indeed that your household and the house of your father should walk before me forever that's what i gave you for promise but now because of your behavior that's between the line but now the lord says be it far from me for them that honor me i will honor and they that inspires me shall be lightly esteemed behold the days come that i will cut off your arm ela and the arm of your father's house that they shall be there shall not be an old man in your house god is bringing judgment and you shall see an enemy in my habitation and in all the wealth which god shall give israel and they shall not be an old man in your house forever look at the curse not even for his generation but forever in other words god is coming to destroy completely the house of elah yet a house of a leaver yet a house of a jew yet a house of the one born among the children of jacob why god can destroy somebody who's coming out out of israel amen verse 33 and the man of yours whom i shall not cut off from my altar in other words i'm going to remove everybody that can preach the word i'm going to remove them completely no more from the house of ilah nobody anybody clear shall be to consume your eyes and to the and to grieve your heart and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of the age and this shall be a sun to you that shall come upon your two sons on ofn finesse in one day they shall die both of them so ela have two children we clear now one is off me and the other one is who they're going to be killed their father is going to be killed and i'm going to wipe the house anybody clear blessed be the name of the lord verse 35 and i will raise me up a faithful water in other words i'm gonna destroy you i'm gonna erase you completely and i'm gonna bring a different priesthood amen i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before my anointed for what i'm gonna remove your priesthood and i'm bringing an eternal priesthood that shall never be destroyed how can the children just did something wrong the daddy didn't correct them instead of striking daddy they are removing daddy completely out wiping daddy completely out no more what's going on with this house go to chapter three verse nine you there amen therefore ela say to samuel go lie down you know the story and it shall be if he calls you that you shall say speak lord for your servant hears you know it's a third time so samuel went and laid down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as the other time samuel samuel then send me an answer speak for your servant hears and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel and which buff the ears of everyone that hears it chatting in that day i will perform against who second time against elah all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end for i have told him that i would judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows he knew better he didn't want to correct them because his sons made themselves vow and he he strained them not parent 14 and therefore i have sown to the house of healer what is wrong with healer god why such a punishment i have sown to the house of ela that the iniquity of ela's house shall not be what in other words there is no atonement that can forgive this sin why he was a priest born delivered israelite from the house of jacob where are you coming from you there ila's house shall not be purged with sacrifice no offering for what so we see here that the house of elah is put completely under judgment we're talking about abiding in the word continuing in the word enduring in the word based on your origin about here let's go to chapter 22 of first samuel you have a point then we start gliding chapter 22 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen david was running away from saul and david run he was hungry stopped by the priest to get some bread and they gave him a sword and then he continues you know the background already anybody clear let's go to verse eight first samuel 22 verse eight that all of you this is so now speaking to the benjamin he say i'm seeking for defeat i can't find him so there must be spies here that cannot tell me where david is amen soul is talking that all of you has conspired against me and there is none that showed me that my son has made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or show me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day then answered the or the water do you know edom is what he saw how did they need almighty his lineage of israel enter into israel they left them there on marseille how did they using then answered dubbed the idol which was set over the servant of soul he even has a position can you see and say i saw the son of jesse david coming to knob to who ahimalek the son of who we found a man here called ahimalik ahima like is here are he malek his father is who i hate him okay i saw the son of jesus coming to knob to ahimalek the son of ahita and he inquired of the lord for him and gave him victim and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine if you read this at home you can understand it then the king sent and called him like the priest he's a priest you see now the son of ahitab and all his father house the priest that were in nob and there came all of them to the king so when the king summoned the priest everybody that was priest in the village of nob in the city of nab came to the king why everybody have to come why not only himself why anybody clear verse 12 and so say here now you son of a hater and he answered he am i my lord and soul said to him why have you conspired against me you and the son of jesse in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquire of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as it is this day then ahemalek answered the king and say and who is so faithful among all your servants as david which is the king's son-in-law and goes about goes goes goes at your beating and he's honorable in your house in other words wait a minute who are you talking to you're talking about your son-in-law you're the one that sent him left and right he's a mind that we know he's honorable a good man what are you talking about verse 15 did that begin to inquire of god for him is this the first time he came to the temple looking for prayer amina i mean seeking for prayer how many times he comes here for prayer because before he goes to the battle so why it's a problem today amen be it far from me let not the king impute anything to his servant no to all the house of my water not himself but his entire house for your servant knew nothing of this of all this less or more and the king said you shall surely die a himalay you and what who gave the bread why is the house suffering and all your house and all your father's house and the king said to the foot man the soldier the guard that stood about him turn and slay the priest of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me but the servant of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priest of the they were true jew they understood the law watch who is first to kill and remember his origin and the king said to who not a jew turn you and fall upon the priest and direct the water from the lineage of esau the edomite turned and he fell upon the priest no fear at all anybody clear and slew on that day four score and five eighty-five person that did where the lion and a lion and effort killed 85 priests one person what a hatred and death and he didn't stop there verse 19 and knob the city of water so that was a city of the priest and knob the city of the priest smote he with the edge of the water he destroyed the entire city he's wiping the entire house off ahitab of hajimelech why are you wiping this house where is god to protect them amen both men and women children and cycling and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the water he destroy everything wipe everything their ox their women their children in other words even the future priests were completely wiped out in other words no priest can stay here wipe it out completely why is god allowing a whole house of priests to be destroyed do you see any connection between this and this do you see it here we know that ela was the father of of knee and finesse did eli give birth to a hitub there is no connection so far are we there verse 20 and one of the son of ahimalik the son of ahitam name who so we have a hitab gave birth to our himalayak and our himalaya gave birth to a beater we're going down the line one escape praise god we save the seed amen name a beater escape and fled after david and abiero showed david that soul has slain the lord's priest and david said to abiera i knew it that day when dog the edomat was there that he would surely tell so i have occasioned the death of all the person of your father's house david is feeling himself guilty right david really are you guilty verse 23 a bad you with me fear not for he that seeks my life seeks your your life but with you with me you shall be in safeguard in other words david made a covenant with this man to protect his life this man was supposed to be killed by saul he escaped soul and he entered into the army of david he's a jew he's a priest a marquis even though he's a priest he's a jew david put his life the life of david he put it upon him to protect him you there blessed be the name of the lord let's go to verse to chapter 23. i'm going to draw something then we're going to soul verse six you there and it came to pass when abieta the son of ahimalik fled to david tequila that he came down with her and he fought in his hand do you know what an effort means amen do you know one of this day if the lord terry we're going to dig into it when they were making the yurimimentam amen brother brother said the human mental means the word it is the it is the the breastplate that was upon the high priest with 12 stone so if you say a dream in the old testament to validate your dream they got to bring you to the priest and you need to speak in front of the human term if you speak and your dream is true what's going to happen is a light will begin to flash around the stone and it's telling you validating or confirming that what you are speaking is the truth and when they were making the human mentality they put the eu mental with the effort they connect them together when god say nobody should separate the effort from the human term so if somebody carried the eu momentum they automatically carry the effort or if somebody carried the effort they automatically carry the real memento so you need to read between the line so when they say that he fled with the ephod god heeded that they are telling you that he fled with the urum and tamim but you need the seventh seal to be open in order to unfold all those mysteries in matthew mark chapter 2 verse 25 the bible said jesus say and he says unto them have he never read what david did when he had a need and was a hungry and he and dead that were with him how he went into the house of who the house of god in the days of who i beat her the water how did jesus know he was a high priest i read where the theologians are arguing why did jesus call him a beatle but it is not to them because the seventh seal was locked now that the seals are broken we understand that the e fold was connected with the euromen tamim and the one who was wearing the yurumi mental was the high priest that's why jesus called a piedra a high priest [Music] you okay now what i'm showing you about was a high priest a vietnam carried the euromen tamim abiera carried the effort abiera consulted god abeda work with david everybody here so far you clear so far go to second samuel chapter 15. why i told you you need your bible the origin is important second samuel chapter 15 if you dare you can say amen second samuel chapter 15 verse 29 you there few people you there in the reign of david zedoc another priest therefore and who a beard carry the water the ark of god again to jerusalem and they terry there we found two priests here one is zedoc and one is ebiada but we know that ebieda was the high priest he was the high priest he carried the ark of the covenant he stood with david he consulted god for david and god even answered through him if you go back to first samuel 23 you're gonna see how they consulted god and god spoke i'm just moving to save some time amen now this man who flee death and david took his life and connected to his life to protect him he began to work for david he began to inquire god for david he was the high priest he even carried the ark of the covenant so this man should remain faithful unto david until the death of david let's go to first king chapter one first king just started after second samuel let's go to first king chapter one a beard a priest a good man a high priest david put his covenant with him david's parent he has a high position in the church he's paid by david the path and the offering belongs to him he should love david until death what makes you abide what makes you endure more makes you to continue what makes you to grow into the world you there you there few people are you there okay let's go to verse five you there then adonaija the son of david the son of her gig he said he's davidson exalted himself he rebelled saying i will be what his father was not dead david was on the bed he took opportunity he exalted himself like absalom he said i'm gonna be king okay you're gonna be king against who against david okay and he prepared him chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him exactly like absalom and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why have you done so and he also was a very goodly man a handsome man and his mother bore him after absalom you there now in his conspiracy in his rebellion usually when somebody rebelled they must have subject that follow them anybody clear if somebody want to start trouble in the church they have to talk to this one talk to this one talk to this one and cause a click to rise everybody now he also made his own clique like lucifer now let's see who is in the clique you there verse seven and he confer with who job this violent general of david falling against david what is wrong the son of zeruya amen kama and with who you okay now i beat her they preached and they follow adonaija help him he was spared from death everybody clear stood with david abide with david consulted god carry the ark of the covenant carried the human men tell them what's in the service of the lord but for some reason at a certain time in his life he also took part a guest in the rebellion against david what's wrong with this man the origin anybody clear what's wrong with this man you want to know where go to face samuel 14 now now let's see what's going on you ready my god praise god we good on time first samuel chapter 14 we're navigating like a sunday school now so on sunday we're soaring everybody clear lord's waiting first samuel chapter 14 if you dare you can say amen verse 3. everybody there everybody there and who verse 3 first samuel chapter 14 verse 3 and who i hear kama the son of who thank you ahitab is here so the scripture is telling us that he also have another son his name was who but we know that he was not only the father of ahir he was also the father of who ahi malek and a grandfather to who i buy at all you clear now okay let's go and i hear or hire the son of a hitub camera you follow me you okay now are we okay am i reading a different bible than you he was the brother to who so him was a brother to who to ika border let's stop there let's continue karma ichabod the son of who do you see here can i connect the dot now now this one goes here are you there are you there if ahitab was a brother to ichabod so his father must be who we okay now ever clear now let's go back again now ahaya the son of ahitab kama ahitab ichabod's brother kama the son of who finayas kama the son of who everybody clear now we understand now do you understand why those priests have to be killed we okay now we okay now because god spoke to elah i'm gonna do what i'm gonna wipe your entire house when god wiped the entire house one escape and enter into david and try to be good to church try to be a believer did the best that he can to stay believing god yet his origin would determine his outcome you okay now you okay now he didn't leave david because he was a bad man you okay now he didn't leave david just because he wanted to leave there was something more greater and powerful than him that no matter how much he want to hang on he gotta go you okay are you okay now your own regime is what determine if you gonna abide or not we okay now if you are sons of god and daughters of god and god baptize you with the holy ghost amen you are still until the day of your redemption we need to stop up and down up and down up and down now it's grounded okay okay the son of ela the lord priest in shalom wearing the effort and the people knew not that jonathan was gone brother stephen this is your deduction this is you going one two three two three like school that's how you did the math are you sure let's see where it came from go to first king then we saw and then we get home first king chapter two at the opening of the seven seals the bible become a new you there that's why you need a prophet you there first king chapter 2 verse 22 are you there everybody there after this we're soaring anybody there verse 22 and king solomon answered and said to his mother and why do you ask abhishak the shunamat for adonaija as for him the kingdom also and he is my elder brother even for him and for who a buyer the priest a biatar the priest and for job the son of zeruya those that rebelled then king solomon saw by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonai have not spoken this word against his own life why solomon have to kill his brother amen now therefore as the lord leaveth which has established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who has made me a house as he promised adulterers shall be put to death this day and king solomon sent by the hand of benaya the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died you there verse 26 and to whom abaya tell the priest say the king get you to another thought to your own field for you are worthy of what death but i would not at this time the millennium not at this time but i'm saying salomon is the top of the millennium i'm going to hold on to you there is a lake of fire i will not at this time put you to death because you did what you bore the ark of the lord before david my father and because you have been afflicted in all wearing my father was afflicted you ready verse 27 so solomon thrust out abiatar from being preached to the lord that he might fulfill the word of the lord that he spoke concerning the house of water is it a deduction abiatar escaped death was afflicted with david stood with david hang on with david did everything but the boy was victim of his origin hallelujah brother branham said god told samuel that he was going to judge the house of ela forever and that they would offer no more sacrifice forever as his priest in 1st king 2 27 solomon thrust out the last descendant of elah from the priesthood that was fourth generation or so later where did you learn fourth generation or so later one two three then the bias sage and the bible are water [Music] the message in the bible are what perfectly in line did brother branham give you all the scripture you don't understand something chill out amen amen didn't kfs prophesies he was a devil we found out that them priests them great man was supposed to be great leaders in them days with humility and everything else but fail to see the word of god itself made manifest before them so your origin will determine whether you're going to stay in the world or not your origin gives you power to endure your origin gives you power to remain your origin gives you power to abide your origin give you power to stay and be granted in the world regardless of the circumstances are you there some of you stood for the message why you didn't understand many things why did you stay in something you don't understand because it passed your understanding there is something else that is holding you to the message of the hour it is not you it is god [Applause] by you abiding now god begin to unfold to you what was going on in a message and you begin to understand it more better and better but you stood when you didn't have all this ammunition now that you have the ammunition let the devil come again everybody clear ever here to be the disciple you must believe and you must what continue to continue you must know your origin [Music] hallelujah the power of the origin that's why the devil hates the revelation of origin in this revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire he revealed the end of the wicked one who follows satan and satan hates that have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all of all others through liberal theologian and pseudoscientists he is always attacking the book of water origin and the book of what the end in both of these books we found set and what that's why satan hates your origin because your origin tells your destination [Applause] he's awful ways of destruction that is why he had touched them he had to be water and in those books he's exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about satan he has no part in me no connection and i have no party water no connection the therefore would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy water in the water but when the church disbelief satan and believe the spirit's revelation of the world the gates of hell cannot and against her if you believe the revelation of the world there is nothing the devil can do to you the devil and hell are powerless we are more than conquering we know where we come from and we know where we are going i come from god i'm going back to god nothing shall separate me from the love of god no height no death no principalities no trouble nothing [Music] like i usually say brother robert a quarter of what i need to deliver amen this set here this group here we show you on sunday that they were eternal you remember now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit because there is an absorbent of it for the holy spirit comes to claim its own it's about who you belong father all that you gave to me i have lost none except the son of perdition he doesn't belong to me now this is what this is what don't preach deep thing in the message don't preach the deep thing in the message oh they're always different deep things this is deep now and be sure to catch this good catch the deep things good as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around water not everybody will be quickened even though david put claims life on a buyata later on a buyer have to go that's why brother branham said you can have the holy spirit on your flesh and go to hell i feel disappeared this i feel this what is inside what is inside judas cast the devils hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord this part is eternal the other part is water is not eternal he doesn't like him because he knows he's going to be wiped amen satan is not eternal no he becomes certain hell is not eternal hell was created it's not eternal and this body are not eternal that's why god will give you a glorified body that is going to be eternal hallelujah but the spirit of god is eternal he never had a beginning or he never has an end and the only way we can have eternal life from the greek word zoe which means god's own life we have we become a part of god when we become sons and daughters of god and we have a annoyance life so the part that so the part that lives us that recognizes the world from here to there that recognizes his ayanno's life life without end it's god's own life in what you have to abide in the truth you must have the truth the part that recognized the word is the word itself [Music] hallelujah that believeth that there is one god that do it well the devil also believes in what their faith don't remove fear from them but perfect faith cast out water so perfect faith will belong to the children of god when they have that faith we have confidence to approach the children of grace bodily and to ask whatever we need but to the devil they believe but they tremble they believe one god the devil believes the deity more than trinitarian hallelujah why did we create the devil then god has an expectation god knows what is going to happen because he's infinite and there is nothing going wrong nothing nothing it depends on your origin it's all going just exactly right because he's infinite and he can foretell the end from the beginning because he's god don't think satan is putting anything on for him oh coronavirus this is going on delta delta god have everything under control hallelujah oh no oh no it's just all working out to display his weapon it's all how could a great definite god who knows everything and let everything it's just the attribute of god being displayed and you are displaying your life they want sad or d other depending on your origin hallelujah well you say then why did god the infinite god ever permit sin you know there is attribute in god and if god would never have permitted satan when he created lucifer that he was to be the one to corrupt the world oh our god is not something leader push off in one corner but he is the infinite god who never had a beginning or never will have an end and in him he is in his attribute he is a savior and how could he ever be known as a savior if there had not been something to save so the devil was created to display the attribute of god everybody clear amen but even in his creation he first stood with god he was the angel of light just like a baater stood with david was afflicted with david but nevertheless he can hold on because of his origin satan also cannot abide in the truth because of his origina how are that fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning how that cut down to the ground which did weakest the nation for that has said in the heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my so he had a position he had a throne amen above the stars of god we explain you this on sunday i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the side of the north i will ascend above the height of the cloud i will be like the most high certain headed throne satan had a position but satan could not keep his position because of his origin hallelujah i will therefore put you in remembrance you remember this now though he wants to know this how the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt after all destroyed them that believe brother branham explain this serve them first brought them out of egypt and then to destroy them why because they didn't work continue with them what keep you in your message let me touch this we stop here and we pick up on sunday let's take detroit 32. hallelujah deuteronomy 32 the origin the origin that's why jesus said i came from my father why you don't understand my speech i saw moses why you don't understand i am i am the i am i know i was there i was in the pillar of fire i know who i am the problem is you don't know who you are your father is the devil that's why you don't understand my word detroit number 32 let's run this and then we go home then we're going to pick up on sunday it's 30. deuteronomy 32 verse 16. they provoke him to jealousy with strange god you there with abomination provoked they him to anger their sacrifice to devil not to god to gods whom they knew not new gods that came newly up whom your father feared not of the rock that father you you are unmindful how can you be a mindful to one who will father you amen and have forgotten god that form you how do you turn against god he formed you and when the lord saw it he abort them because of provoking because of the provoking of his sons and his daughter and he said i will hide my face from them i will see that their end shall be what the end shall be and for they are a very forward generation children in whom is no water those of faith are there sons of god remember on sunday but this one no faith that's why they keep falling from the word you there with me let's get this first corinthians chapter 10 [Music] first corinthians chapter 10 and then we're going to finish with this scripture hallelujah first corinthians 10. if you're there you can say amen we're talking about the left egypt but god killed them yet god came to save them you there first corinthians 10 verse 1 moreover brethren i will not that you should be ignorant how that how many all believe in jesus christ had that all our father were under the cloud everybody karma and all everybody pass through the sea all of them experience that and where all everybody baptized to moses the messenger in the cloud and in the sea everybody indeed all eat the same spiritual meat all of them at the manor [Music] for indeed all drink everybody the same spiritual drink for the drunk of the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was who bad with many not few with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness please without faith it is impossible to do whatever you understand now children in whom there is no you okay now go to hebrew then i'm going to the airport hebrew chapter 3. i'm glad it's wednesday so we took it as a sunday school hebrew chapter 3 amen go to verse 6 hallelujah you there but christ as a son of his own house whose house are we so we are the house of god so everybody is the house of god let's see who is the house of god you okay if you're there we hold fast you see now who shall endure who shall continue who shall abide who will remain that's the seed make sense who is making it to the promised land it's joshua and caleb you there if we hold fast the confidence faith and the rejoicing restore unto me the joy of my salvation you see that and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the water to the end you there jump to verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief come on in water in departing to depart you must be there in departing from the living god you were there but something caused you to move out like lucifer like a baiter in departing from the living god but exalt one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitful of sin for we are made partaker of christ comma watch again if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast study you must remain in the truth anybody why it is said today if you will hear his voice hiding not your heart as in the provocation for some when they have heard did provoke however not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was he not with them that had seen whose carcasses fell in the wilderness 18 and to whom saw he that he should not enter into his head but to them that believe what children in whom there is no verse 19 so we see that they could not enter in because of what job to chapter 4 job to chapter four verse one you there let as therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for to us was the gospel preached as well as to them but the word preached did not profit them they preached the word but it doesn't help them make sense profit them not not being mixed with what in them there so when the word come faith must be there to receive the word and unlock the word to you but in the children where there is no faith there is nothing to decode it is filling their mind it is filling their brain but there is no changes anybody clear my god let me close by this i'm gonna get this later let me go here okay all right let me get these two paul say but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god has from the water from the beginning chosen you to through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the water you were predestinated to believe the truth based on your origin ever here where until he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand what and hold the tradition which you have been whether by word tape or by books everybody clear and you that was sometimes alienated an enemy in your mind by wicked word yet now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you do what if you continue in the faith grounded and what and be not move away from the hope of the gospel which he have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where i pour and made water closing truly predestinated believers stay with the world truly predestinated believer stay with the world and they won't prevent it the one that preferred the children of the devil it can be perverted all sons and daughters of god why can we have this great fellowship that we ought to have we found the sons and daughters of god we should have it but they just won't do it that's all because they are not truly sons and daughters from there that leader inside of the inside that is where you start which is your then come from that you are a spirit and then you become a living being but the inside of the inside the control tower it either oh hallelujah those with him are on the white horse and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen and they are faithful to the amen i like that call chosen before the foundation of the world and them faithful to the by their word they know that thunder will issue the thing for us pretty soon to be kept in the world you must know where you come from it doesn't depend on your effort it doesn't depend on you it doesn't depend on your family it doesn't depend on your country all depends where you came from if you come from god no matter what happened in your life you will go back to god because god will lose none of his children amen and satan also will lose none of his children it depends on where you come from to be a true disciple believing but abiding to abide you must be from the source of the things from the source of the message for you to abide in the message so if you are here it is not because of you if you are here it is not because you want it to be if you come that way you're going to fall if you follow somebody you're going to fall you you are here because something supernatural took cover of you you didn't understand many things you didn't understand the message clearly you didn't understand many mysteries you didn't understand this or that but something there is an anchor keep holding on it is not you holding to god it is god holding to his own seed [Music] your origin will determine your reaction your origin will determine whether you're going to hang out or not your origin will determine your life you can copy you can do everything you can go upside and down if you're not from there you're not going to be there but if god ever unveil his life to you and declare to you that you are his it is time to serve him it is time to stand fast on the message that have been delivered to you by books and by tips it is time to be serious with god it is time to put your life in order it is time to move forward amen check like the scriptures say examine yourself whether you are in the faith if not you're going to be trusted out like a biatar he was victim of his origin and if he was victim of his origin we also are victim of our origin because we were ordained predestinated by god to bear fruit we can't help it we can push it there's nothing else that i can do paul prisoner of jesus christ we become prisoner of him and the devil also has prisoners in his prison his prison is hell but we are prisoners of love because there is no height no death there is no principalities no power no life no death nothing can separate you from the love of god which is in christ jesus christ let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace father for your love for your choosing for the election for predestination because you foreknow us before the foundation of the world lord jesus even in this election we could be the foolish virgin and yet be saved we could be the righteous that's gonna be good to the brother and yet be saved we could be the jews the 144 thousand and yet be saved but father even within your own rank you chose us to be the best to be the elite to be the bride that's gonna sit with you and reign with you sit on the throne father the devil have been tormenting your children so much especially with the thought whether they child of god or not because they struggle this because they have this because they say this because this one says this because of many theology many preaching that were done throughout the years and that brought confusion and father lord jesus christ lack of assurance to the heart of your children but father you are unfolding these things that lord you have chosen us you have predestinated us you have dropped into us a predestinated seed that will take care of this journey from a start until the finish father you are unfolding unto us who we are and lord father no doubt paul who says that all things work together for good to them that i love god those that are called for your purpose now we understand lord father that because we were called father there is nothing that can come in our life that's gonna be able to separate us if there is anything any trial any trouble that is coming along father you told us that you shall never put something that is gonna be greater than our strength lord father before even the devil can bring a test you are looking at us you're looking at the potential you place us and you matching that lord to make sure we beat the devil at the end to make sure we come out with an expected end to make sure we are victorious at the end and we are always the winner and never to be loser father we thank you lord father that you started this way back in your mind lord and father you are unfolding this mystery grounding us to the two floor to know lord that we should not be wavering left and right but it's time lord father to get into the father's business and to prepare ourselves for the coming of the lord lord we thank you we're committing your children unto the hand bless them lord father and remember lord father the desire of their heart that you help them in this journey and those that are still unsure may the holy spirit unfold and decode lord father yourself in a personal revelation that no devil can come any relief or can come and push away but lord father they can stay lord father fast until the end till we meet you in the air lord we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ
