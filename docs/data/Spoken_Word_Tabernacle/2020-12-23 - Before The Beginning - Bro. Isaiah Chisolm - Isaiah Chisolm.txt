whatever's bothering you in life just say so all your sickness all your diseases whatever it may be say goodbye to my pain and my sorrow for so long so long bye bye one whatever the enemy throws at you to say amen amen that's my testimony this evening is so long bye bye whatever satan throws at me you know we can try to fight him or we can just step aside and watch it go brother branham said when you walk up to that rattlesnake in the road don't try to fight it don't try to deal with it just move around it and that's what i want to do whatever the enemy throws at me i'm just going to step aside just step aside my wife was almost here wasn't almost able to make it this evening but god made a way and we had some issues with some of the words which we didn't have for these first two songs but we should have for the rest no matter what the enemy throws it your way you just step aside you know he doesn't have no power no dominion over this bride over god's people so whatever whatever sickness or struggle or whatever the symptoms are of your life you just ignore it and you just look to the promise in the word we're going to open this service in prayer let's all bow our heads thank you lord for this time that we can come together again lord that i can gather with this group of believers lord lord i believe each person in this building is bride lord and it's such a pleasure to be able to gather with this group lord lord and just for the calling that you've given us to be this bride lord and and to be in this age lord because you had confidence that we would overcome and withstand so we ask that you just give us a strength lord because we know without you it would not be possible lord we just ask you to take this service lord the song service whatever is said and done lord when your minister comes forth you move him aside and you speak to our hearts you know what we have need of lord so we just ask that you come now lord and just minister to our hearts we pray we love you and thank you for all you do lord in jesus name amen amen [Music] thank you lord i tell you what i was going to do this next song in honor of brother kelly because i know in two separate services he he sang the chorus of this song so i was going to do it in honor of brother kelly but i don't see him here this evening so i hope he's on live stream because brother kelly this is for you but i really enjoy this song and every time he's saying it i just felt it on my heart to to do with the church and teach the church and i'm sure you've heard it before so we're going to try it this [Music] evening when there was no one around god came and spoke these words to me praise will confuse [Music] times when there was no one around god came and spoke these words to me praise will confuse the enemy so i started singing i started clapping i started dancing people were laughing they knew my problems they knew my pain but i knew god would take them away so i've had my share of ups and downs it's times when there was no one around god came and spoke these words to me he said praise praise will confuse [Music] they knew my problems they knew my pain but i knew god would take them away and that's why i praised he's given me a second chance so come on let's [Music] when things are right and when they're wrong he's given me a second chance so come on if we're gonna do this i started clapping i started dancing people were laughing and they knew my problems and they knew my pain but i knew that's why [Music] amen thank you lord i've been there before i've started clapping i started singing i started dancing and people were looking at me and they might think well he's a pentecostal or he's crazy or whatever they want to think but what it is is when you can tap in and see what god has done for you in your life and what he's called you to and who you are and get a revelation of that i tell you what it's easy to lose control i've always described the holy ghost is described as a fire and when that fire comes over you i like to think that if i was on fire that i'm going to react in a way that's going to be running and dancing and rolling and acting crazy because i'm trying to you know i'm on fire well i think of the holy ghost when it comes over us it should be a fire it should be something that excites you you know it's not based on emotion but that doesn't mean it doesn't come with emotion you know when that holy ghost you hit your thumb you have emotion it hurts but when you get touched with this holy spirit i tell you what it'll do something to you so it's don't be scared to clap don't be scared to to run the aisles to dance i mean brother shane go correct me if i'm wrong but i believe that that's still in church order that you can dance you can run i believe brother branham taught that so don't be scared this evening amen thank you lord thank you lord at this time i think we'll just uh we'll take any testimonies has anybody had a testimony on their heart [Music] no testimony he's brother robert um uh amen amen we have a we have a request for um it's actually my my wife's uncle is in the hospital with i guess they say covid and i i think some other things um and i don't think he's doing very well but we know god no matter how where the situation can go we know god can handle it and turn it around so we just look to him we'll bring that request before the lord i don't know if anybody else has a spoken request on their heart brother kelly amen amen he's still our healer he'll still do it if anybody has an unspoken request on their heart if they could just make it known by the uplifting of the hand and brother caleb it's good to have you back good to see our brother brother caleb let's give him a hand [Applause] i mean god bless your sins amen i'm just happy to be back in the household again um i know a lot of you guys have been praying for me um so i just want you guys to appreciate that and uh god bless you for that and i love you for it i just have a little testimony i was gone boot camp for marine everything was going smooth and then they have to do their own tests on everybody else so when they did a test on me um they found out that i had latent tuberculosis and it's just been laying there and i didn't know it don't know how i got it when i got it but apparently it was somebody else that had it and i've been around with them for too long and so so i had to get pulled off of the training and so it's been a month since they were doing whatever they have to do to try to get me better and back on track but they couldn't figure out do i have what they say i have but it's unusual because i was not showing any symptoms and so uh it took longer because they still wanted to know uh why that's the case because every person that they had does have symptoms why are you different than everybody else and so um in me i was just you know one they pulled me out they told me the news you know i was a little uh disappointed because i wanted to you know keep on going in the training but i just sit there and i knew it could you know it could have been worse or um you know so i'm just thankful that god exposed that demon that's been laying there you know who knows why it could have been in the future but guy in his time he you know just exposed it out to me and i was sitting there getting traded treated differently because of the disease or whatever they want to call it and they had me say on the far bench you know so i kind of away from everybody else you know i felt like an outcast and you know i am an outcast amen so i was sitting there and you know i just kind of remember what happened to brother brennam's wife when she got the cancer because of what she did um and remember but when i'm praying and saying you know lord before the doctor even put put her hands on her may you remove that cancer amen and i just lord if you did it for that sister you're the same you can do it for me man they did a bronchoscopy they put something on my lungs get the sample of whatever they saw and they took it out they did all those tests and they tested it for every possible disease they can think of and it was also all of it came back negative [Applause] and so i just kept calm and from there i just knew that my time there was done and they came back and they said everything is coming back negative you're making progress and i was like i was never sick in the first place amen so it's not and i told them it's not what chica i appreciate you guys have to do your job but it's not what you do or in your minds or whatever you study in school it's greater his they live in me that he is in the world amen and i just knew lord my body belongs to you i'm a temple of the holy ghost there's no disease no sickness that can take over and from there i just knew that it was god showing his mighty works to me and i knew my time was done that i had to come home and keep worshiping and saving my god amen what i can just say is that god is not respected of a person a man he'll work in elders in the youth even to the little ones amen we always children amen we're just gonna go before the

l-a-t-e-n-t so before you start getting on your telephone and begin to google [Music] and to get on the drama where we need to take the whole church and go test everybody because he has been here for quite a while a lantern tb is a dormant tv it's a small amount of bacteria of tb that are in your body and the immune system your immune system is controlling that so a latent tb is not a disease tb a disease tb is contagious that one we need to get everybody tested by the latent tb means you have a little bit of bacteria they are dormant they're not doing anything but one of this day they can wake up and cause sickness as long as it's latent you won't have any symptoms you're not gonna get sick and you're not going to contaminate it's not contagious you don't need to get tested to clear it up or find out who has it or not so i kind of give it up as a little lecture to make sure everybody's in peace by god's grace god used the army for him to go and get a free treatment amen [Music] all

water called he see and god saw that it was good let us just buy heads again father we thank you lord jesus for the reading of your word now sanctify it to our soul this reacts in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated praise the lord amen i just want to for a little moment tonight i'm just going to take my watch off and uh and uh just put what the lord lay on my heart tonight and we just appreciate the presence of the lord that is here tonight i just want to speak on a little thought before the beginning before the beginning question before the beginning or before there were a world or before he was known as god god had a plan or a purpose god had a plan or a purpose the prophet of god said in the message hear his voice he said and see how god in his great plan just knowing how to make everything every person just exactly to be a certain things because he's going to use them for that purpose can the church say man god is going to use you for a purpose amen now we've seen that the bible let us know that moses wrote uh in genesis moses wrote he says in the beginning god create the heaven and the earth now we realize that it should be all right i just walk around a little bit you know when god uh moses said that god create the heaven and the earth now a bible tells us in the book of john that god is a spirit that's right and and we that worship him must worship him how in spirit and in truth so the only way you can get something tonight you're gonna have to get in the spirit when john was on the isle of patmos 1895-96 for the word of the lord john was caught up in the spirit and sometimes we come to church you know you might have talked through the day of whatever you have went through and sometimes you have to enter into amen into the spirit so moses begin to write a man in the beginning god create the heaven and the earth that's right and moses is going to say that uh the earth was look was without shake form of lord another word when moses wrote that but when john uh the gospel john 1 1 john wrote in the beginning was the word [Applause] and the word was with god and the word was made flesh listen john put an emphasis on that word he want you to notice something now and the word was made flesh and the word dwell among us somebody say man and we see now when paul come along paul talked about ephesians one i think four uh paul talk about in ephesians he talked about uh before the foundation of the world now we was blessed in this generation to have a prophet that went before the beginning before there was a world before he was known as god my how many of you love to just go there tonight before he was known as god now the prophet of god said something here if i could just read this tonight to you amen how the prophet of god he was talking about his daughter now this what he said here he said here he said in the message uh [Music] let's read what he said here he said faith can take it resting place see you've got to have something somewhere that faith can take it resting place and to me i don't know how you feel tonight about it but to me the bible is the infallible the bible this bible this word what you got in your lap on the floor it's infallible if that's right glory to god it is the infallible word of god and i believe that god has watched over his word that there is not one punctuation out of place [Applause] not one common is out of place not one quotation is out of place every period god is allowed it to be there you say wait a minute brother children somebody said where the man did man wrote the bible yes he wrote the bible but according to apostle peter peter said holy mans was inspired and they wrote the word of god so it wasn't man that's right it was the spirit of god that was writing the word of god glory to god in the beginning in the beginning before now right here we see the universe now before there was a galaxy before there was a star before there was anything it was elohim that's right i know you all know that that word elohim is the self-existent one in other words he dwelled all along now a lot of things i'm going to say i can't go back to my nose because it slowed me down i'm just going to preach so elohim the bible the prophet of god said elohim was this great big fountain seven rainbow color somebody say man amen that rainbow color of red and orange and purple and violet it was there for a purpose but that was elohim the self-existent one now elohim amen he dwelled all along now i'm thinking and now i'm thinking before there was a star before there was dust before there was anything before there was air he dwelt all along you know you ought to be happy tonight and elohim amen in his mind he had you yeah sometimes you may feel real bad and down amen but ain't going by how you feel elohim had you in his mind not not only in his mind but you was in the back part of his mind he was in the back part of his mind before there was a star and now let me help you out i want you to tell the devil that elohim had you in his mind before he thought of the devil [Applause] glory to god before he even made the devil you was in his mind now now i know sometimes the devil gives you a hard time and you don't know you coming of going but let me tell you what if elohim had you in his mind back then he got you today you are still in his mind he can't lose you so elohim wanted a man to express himself glory to god how many y'all can't remember now see we was there i know you can't remember with these minds that we have now amen amen because of amnesia amen you can't remember but by the grace of god i believe with all of my heart i was with him before there was a world before there was a star why why you think you are overcoming tonight because you come from god and you're going back to god [Applause] it's impossible it's impossible for you to be deceived you can't be deceit there's no preacher that can deceive you matter of fact we're not falling man we are following the spirit of god the bible said they that are led by the spirit they are what the sons of god [Applause] so i don't let man be my absolute no no no no man it's not my absolute word of god is my absolute tonight the word of god is perfect within itself it's unlimited in his power so i don't have my faith our confidence in a man i got my confidence in the word of god because the prophet of god said when the man leaves the word you do what lincoln god i'm not hearing you now when the man lead the world what do you do then you leave the man you're not falling man but you fall into god [Applause] see the devil is so upset because you come from god you come from god we was out there we was in his mind think about it before there was dust before it was a galaxy we was in his mind and he could never he could never ever take you out of his mind glory to god i know we look at our mistakes and our failure but that don't change what god did now let me tell you what elohim did because he's he's he's i'm not present because he have these attribute in him now what he did uh uh brother brown said the word predestination it's a bad word to use before an untrained audience but i'm feeling capable of using that word tonight so predestination amen it's the full knowledge of god let me tell you what elohim did he saw you and he already know all about you you know why because you were a thought in his mind now tonight last night you know i will think about your pastor brother steve i couldn't imagine brother still i was kind of my mind kind of mad you know his stature and everything but you know i was thinking about him but we was miles and miles away i was in greenville last night i i could i don't think i could talk to him on the phone i just was a thought i was thinking about brother steve but when you was in god's mind you was a thought and god thought were tangible that means god could touch his thoughts y'all hear me god could touch his thoughts that's how real his dogs was so what god did he went ahead of you now a lot of people say you know uh uh let me first of all do you know that god sought every one of us up on a freemore agent do you know that do you know he shot before you life and death now let me tell you what he did now god knew what you was going to accept god knew you was going to come to this you didn't know that but he knew that he went ahead of you and he saw your whole life and you know what he did he saw your whole life and he went and wrote your name on the lamb book of life are you hear me he wrote your name brother gray on the lounge book of life when did he do it somebody said before i don't know why he let the devil beat you up so much amen i've learned now amen because the holy ghost has taught me i don't care if i'm laying down in the mud i'm still a son of god i don't care if i land down on my back i'm still adopted son of god i don't care if i'm broke i'm still rich in christ why because i come from god and i go back to god hallelujah now this is what the prophet of god uh daughter made a statement to him praise god it's in the message spoken word the original seed praise god now he's saying right here he said my daughter back there rebecca was saying dad in school we can prove that there are millions and millions of years this world is old isn't that contrary to the bible he said no sir i said it isn't well said if there's different studies of rocks and formation and stacklets and so on and so forth doesn't that prove the the dripping of millions of years and god said he made the heaven and the earth in one 24 hour doesn't that misprove the bible he said i said no he said if you notice god tell moses about the bible he said in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period that's how long that period how long it took that's none of our business then he goes on ahead and began to bring in his time of putting seeds in the earth but in the beginning might have been hundreds of billions of years of time but he created the heaven and the earth period that sells that that's the first step see he make no mistake how many thank god see there's one thing about man about scientists science could say one thing and down the road science could prove fiction and dissonance but down the road scientists could say well i'm sorry i made a mistake but god's word once you're saved you're saved you have been redeemed you have been redeemed well the prophet of god said some years ago he said he said what if we took 40 different scientists from 1600 years apart and see what we come up with a friend a french scientist 300 years ago proved by science by rolling the ball at a terrific speed uh was uh obtained uh 30 miles an hour the object would leave the earth and fall oh do you think scientists will ever refer back to that you see see scientists will change that why because we got cars out there that can go 100 miles per hour we don't leave off the earth but see how science say one thing and they have to change but when god's saying there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a rapture when when the word of god says that you all overcome us you are i tell you how many take god's word tonight i take god's word tonight and i'm standing on god's word tonight tonight church of the living god i'd rather be standing on god's word than to be in heaven because heaven and earth gonna pass away but the word of god is gonna stand forever the word of god is our absolute how many you thank god for that tonight my my when i think about the goodness of god my i was with them well elohim wanted to be a savior i know we all know that but it just i just love talking about it elohim wanted to be a savior elohim wanted to be a healer elohim amen wanted to be a father but there was no children there was nobody sick there was nobody lost so elohim had a plan in his mind oh glory to god you know sometimes brother steve we make plans but our plans fell

knew that one day i was going to come to the message of the hour [Applause] you know i i i could see why i i let me look right into the camera i could see why people that's not born of god i could see why they reject the message of the hour they thinking that they're rejecting a man you ain't rejecting william you're rejecting christ [Applause] he is the word hallelujah this is the best thing that ever happened to me when god brought a message in this hour to give the bride raptured faith man i never i'm the most happiest man on this side of heaven anybody happy like me man i am so happy you

great fountain that great fountain i come from god and what was i come from god now i'm going to demonstrate something tonight a picture is a thousand words i want i want you to catch this revelation tonight everybody in here how many you say i come from god not now do you really believe that now the devil is going to try you on that but when you're going through you still looked the devil right square in the eye and said i come from god [Applause] well god is the object of worship so what god did if you look in genesis 1 if he would go back there with me genesis 1 and one and it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth appeared and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now look at verse three now notice verse three and the bible said and what and god said let there be light and there was light brother brother saying that was the first beginning of the creation of god the light they came for was that logos can you go with me on that son you're getting real quiet on me that time but that's all right in how amen brother brandon said that logos went forth amen he said that light went forth oh my goodness what did i said wrong tonight amen somebody help me lift jesus amen i'm just saying what the prophet said he said that with that first light that struck hey man maybe i need to read it maybe i need to read that can i read that [Music] sound like if some breaks was falling let me let me let me go back oh my if i could just find that oh my oh my you love him oh my god mine my mind just can't pull it up but i got it in here i just thought that went over real good but it's all right in huh amen amen brother brown said that first light that struck the earth he said it was a spoken word and that's what it say and that's what john picks it up in john 1 1. it says in the beginning was the word in other words in the beginning was the logos are you hearing me and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen so we thank god amen for his word his word never change so tonight i believe by god's grace i believe that i am a spoken word seed of god i believe that i came from god as a thought a thought is a word what express [Applause] yeah he was thinking about me are you hearing me when he was on the cross he was thinking about me hallelujah and i thank god he put my name on the lamb book of life before the foundation of the world now you see in genesis 1 and verse 3 he's saying let there be light then he goes on in genesis 16 and he's talking about two lights right there with how many likes out there huh how many likes are there amen oh i'll just leave that right there amen amen so you got to know amen when he said let there be light i was with him and all that was in god all that was in god brother brown said he polled what now do you believe that see we got to get you a play we just can't be good quotas we we got we got to believe when that prophet spoke that you got to take the word to back that up so i believe that all that was in god i believe uh brother that he polled at what and all that was in what he did what did christ do with it he pulled it where let me tell you what you got just as much god in you than he had from the beginning but you got to know how to operate that law [Applause] can i just demonstrate this tonight now we know that god is a spirit very simple and they that worship him what must worship him in spirit and in truth and all that was in god the father he did what he pulled it into christ now now you're looking at this right here so in your mind you're looking at something pouring now i know steve i'm tall on that now come on you're looking at you pulling something no it wasn't that way god brother brown said it's not like someone is vomiting something is going out of you uh on my leg he said no god he knows he acted himself into christ are you hearing me brother oh all of god see if if you ain't careful with that revelation you think that god told his son to go out their son and do the redemption plan and you think god's standing there with his unfolding looking at his son no it wasn't that way god created a body and god stepped in that body oh you hear me god all of god stepped inside of that body in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead body [Applause] somebody tell the devil you are in trouble no wonder the prophet god said when the church when the church recognize who she is then there's the rapture now i'm going to get loose here i found out i'm pretty tall message believe us i'm preaching to believers tonight so i'm just going to go ahead and preach if y'all don't like it i'm sorry amen to tell your pastor don't call me no more but i'm going to tell the devil we caught from god and we are going back to god hallelujah god king knows god yapped it himself see that's the way that's the way the nomination got it they thank god up here he poured he pulled himself so it's god over here it's his son over here now ain't such a thing are you hearing me so that oh that was in god are you hearing me oh i feel like preaching now all that was in god he emptied himself all of god all of god was in christ oh no one of jesus said when you see me you see the father [Applause] can i say it can i say it so when i look at you who am i looking at do you know who you are you are missing jesus you are the lamb's wife you just ain't his bride [Applause] you've been married to royalty you got on the ring which is the revelation because you're a man you could go behind the curtain and you could take c's i got drunk off of that hallelujah man he must have loved that i got you know i never drank before i don't know what it tastes like but just while ago i just got good and drunk i got good and high tonight hey man somebody say man i don't know about you you might gotta drink a red bull before you come to church but let me tell you what i'm drinking of his spirit right now [Applause] so all of god is where all of god is in christ so what god did he just changed his mask he and morphy he changed himself whoa look look church this message justin i don't know why oh my god you got to be ordained for this right here this message got enough power to change your ted do you know that amen i'm talking about we had to count down we count ten nine eight seven six five four three two one it's gonna be a blast out yes sir we getting ready to leave here [Applause] man you know what i've been doing i've been checking my goodness you know the prophet of god said in the message is your life worthy of god a lot of men love that mess because they love to say is your wife worth i ain't talking about that he said it's your life not as your wife well when i say that those men be looking they like that that get it get it boy let me tell you what i told my wife i said look honey we both are mad to him i said are you hearing me i said we are my team we are amen we are mad to christ the revealed word so when i admire to him that making him is my head so that makes me submissive to my husband how many wives are here tonight come on man i just come on with me man i'm talking spiritual now you still looking that tree man how many you ain't here that's mad to christ amen so i mean you're obeying your head huh are you obeying your head when your head tells you to pray do you pray when your heart when your husband tells you to forgive your enemy do you forgive them i told a young sister i said this is a god all against you but don't you have nothing against them they may talk about you but you love them in a house you say why i got to do that because you come from god [Applause] brother but steve i'm trying to say something i might be wrong on there but let me tell you what do you know uh do you know when jesus in matthew 24 chat and i'm going off a little bit i'm coming back okay somebody pulled me over here do you know in matthew
