coworkers and i was challenged but i had the flag and i can keep my flag flying high and i know that no matter what grounds i stand on if i'm standing on this word i have a strong foundation i have to be wavered or shaken because i know that this word is my foundation and it's always going to remain true so i'm grateful for it so i just want to keep my flag flying high i want to keep it relevant in my life i want to stay in it i want to learn it i want to be revelated by his word amen i'm glad to be here this evening i'm looking forward to the word i don't know if anyone has a prayer request on their heart this evening does anybody have a testimony i have on here that a sister has a testimony she want to go ahead and make it known god bless you all the testimonies regarding my daughter abigail it has been three years that i went to the doctor for her physical and your checkup when i went there you know normally they would tell them to cover their eye and say out the letters and i noticed myself that she was having a hard time saying those letters out and then i talked to her when the daughter came in i say i noticed that she's having her issue i mean difficulty is saying the letters out and the daughter said that since she's just six we can just observe and see if she will maybe improve because some of the people will improve later on i said okay that's fine and we checked it we'll see it at the next checkup a year after i went to the doctor's office again i noticed again she was having a hard time saying those letters out again and then the doctors say it is truth is having a hard time but the teacher in school have not said anything yet but he said that's good to go ahead and refer her to the eye doctor for preventive measure i took her to the eye doctor they did a test again and again she had an issue again to say the letters out and they prescribed to her eyeglasses and then i was like at this age wearing eyeglasses it's not really easy and she's small she has to wear this for the whole her entire life i took her to another eye doctor to have a second opinion and it was something and even the second doctor prescott behind those of the eyeglasses and i told her okay they said you have to wear eyeglasses you have to choose the firm that you want so they can put whatever they have to put in the eyeglasses she chose the eyeglasses and i said the doctor said you have to wear this all the time and she said she went for a few days and after she said mama i don't want to wear eyeglasses because i don't want to look like a scientist or a teacher i said but you have to wear this because they say you have to wait and i was it on that 2019 i remember it was in november i had an accident i didn't go to church on that sunday and we met we went to a wedding on that sunday evening and brother stephen was called to pray just to spread before the wedding started and when he was praying i can feel the anointing coming out of him where i was sitting i was like oh my god does he really feel that he had that strong anointing on him and that was it and then my husband and i were left with her home and it happened at the same sunday evening they came to my house to say hi to my mother-in-law as we were talking most of the time we talked about the word of god and i say how was the church you preaching the church tell me what was happening in the church he preached to me he told me what happened in the church as he was talking to me i can feel again that strong anointing and in my heart i felt like to ask him to pray for my daughter because i was really sure that if he prayed my daughter would be here but for some reason i got distracted i didn't ask him and then when he left like oh my god i should ask him to pray for my daughter what happened i said lord if you give me another opportunity i'll ask him to to pray for my daughter a year after again i went to the doctor i office again he had the same issue they referred me again to the doctor to the eye doctor i said i don't want to go there because she doesn't know what she doesn't want to wear the eyeglasses they said you still have to go because you have to encourage her otherwise she might have trouble seeing i said okay that's fine i took her the same issue this time they gave a higher dose of eyeglasses i took her to the eyeglasses to buy eyeglasses that said now you have to choose the best one that you would like because you have to wear this i'm spending a lot of money on these glasses and you're not wearing them she chose she said mom at this time i'm going to wear eyeglasses i said okay that's fine and then she wore the eyeglasses for a few days again she said mama i don't want to wear eyeglasses i said okay you say don't want to wear eggless see the lord see able to hear to hear you because he's a healer we pray and everything was fine and then it happened that last year i was around my brother's wedding but stephen was at my house and they asked him to dismiss because he they was ready to leave and i told him please whenever you prayed for this message just remember my daughter abigail in prayer because she has an eye issue and she doesn't want to wear eyeglasses and he prayed at that time after he prayed for my daughter i believe on august the 28th i don't know where i was i just had a strong conviction in my heart like a voice telling me that abigail is here from her eye issue i was like oh lord you told me but i'm not really sure the doctor said they have to confirm that and then yesterday i took her to the doctor office again they told her to cover her eyes and this time she was much better myself i noticed that she only said instead of saying he she said f instead of saying f she said eat and they told us to wait for the doctor and sooner the doctor came in the office he said oh abigail you're doing just fine you don't need to wear eyeglasses anymore or go to the doctor's office and i was like praise the lord we pray for this issue the lord has healed us began i'm so happy i called my husband i told him about the issue we're all happy in the evening time my husband was eating i told him since you're eating i'm just gonna go and get the girl ready for night because they have to wake up in the morning to go to school i went up i started to my kid and i remember the lord told me that on this day abigail was here i said i pray with them i said oh i remember writing this down let me just go and check my red on my notebook and see when was the date i went on my notebook and i saw was exactly on august 28 2008 or 2020 where the lord has told me abigail was here so i'm just happy that the lord has really honored her faith because she defeated my faith i was encouraging her to wear eye glasses but she was like mama i don't want to wear eyeglasses so i just want to thank the lord for giving her that strong faith and for honoring our faith solomon could you come forward and pray for us [Applause] if anybody has an unspoken request on their heart they can make it known by the uplifting of the hand let's just bow our heads this evening our dear and gracious father and lord we come before your throne of grace and mercy one more time the lord we gathered ourselves together in this building tonight lord not to see one another not to hear from one another or not to be seen and

revelation that unfolded the plan of redemption so this message brings you exactly to the point where you must know you gotta know who you are amen it's a life blessed be the name of the lord everybody happy tonight you ready for the word praise the name of the lord how many are behind on the sermon on sunday [Music] did you listen you caught up [Laughter] if you are not make sure you guided because we're going to get into more territory of the black dog amen don't run from the church stay in the church we're going to get in the nail get in the hair we already touched the painted eyes not that you're doing it because the fight has been where is he written in the bible where is he written in the bible this is only brother branham who says that not even having the knowledge that the message is perfectly lined up with the scripture so now if you're not doing it that's fine if you're doing it it's god grace that is coming to unfold it to you that it's not about a religion it is a life amen so now you're going to see in the scripture why does brother branham says this and never give you a scripture you're going to see it in the scripture that okay this is the reason why we don't put makeup this is the reason why we don't keep nails this is the reason why we don't have high heels all of them we're going to pull them up from the scripture one by one so when you talk to somebody and they say you message believer you're wearing shoes like this you say it's not me it's the word amen not my pastor remember only the bible says brother branham say the bible say brother branham said when you are there ministering then you pull the sword you say it is written it is written it is written it is written that's the way you're going to defeat him everywhere anytime anywhere under any circumstances amen so make sure you are caught up because on sunday we're gonna pull up a little bit and go deeper amen you already know the principle of the god of variety the god of big mountain little mountain tall people short people but all of us we are wonderful christian amen wonderful creature wonderfully made marvelous work amen so you must be proud of what god made you if he made you tall you're proud of it remember sunday he made you short like zacchaeus you're proud of it whatever god puts you in you're proud of it god gives you a black tone be proud of it cherish it a white one be proud of it a nation be proud and stay under your category if you understand that principle you won't have a trouble with brother branham amen people missed the prophet and they thought brother branham was a racist he was not a racist go back to the scripture lay the principle of the god of variety you're gonna see that he's a god that have his bread like a bouquet amen out of every kindred every nation every tongue he's pulling his bread and that's the way we're gonna be in the resurrection and that's the way we're going to stay for eternity amen and brother branham even say when he created you the way you are he's actually expressing himself by the way he's creating you amen so if god created you tall you must be proud to be told you must be happy to be told and you must cherish that height if god created you to be a little bit shorter stay that way don't put on high heel because actually going the right of michael jackson you are insulting the maker because he's the one that made your nose the way it is amen i have another scripture for sunday where you're gonna see god did it for not only on last sunday we seen that it's only it's for his pleasure but on sunday i'm gonna give you a scripture where the bible say he did it for his own glory amen he did it for his own glory so you there is a way you must cherish the glory of god amen and keep it just the way god did it i'm not talking about if you sick because if you sick that's not correct amen in john chapter 9 there was a man that was born how blind and they asked jesus the question who did committed sin was it him or his parent jesus said this one i am the one who look at the manufacturing i am the one who say omit this when i'm gonna come up i'm gonna heal him for the glory of god amen that's why when you seek you need to strive to go back to health amen anything if you're born with a club foot or whatever it is that's the reason why he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your what infirmities amen because he wants you to look exactly like the picture he had in the mind that sometimes the sins of the parent the sins that happen the smoking of cigarette can affect a child and then destroy the eyes now you need to go back to the original funding creation that's why the third pool when it's coming up missing lamps will pop up why does the power of the third part bring missing lamps because you must go back to the original creation where you're going to be perfectly fine perfectly here perfectly uh happy just the way god created you amen so stay deep in prayer it is the holy spirit working amen some of you if you caught it on sunday a gift even manifested here but i'm going to explain it on sunday and i'm going to pull the court and pull the scripture so you understand what is going on everybody clear so far we are behind our house meeting brother mike daley is online brother robert brother mike daly you know what to do on that one i'm

father may you just come and put it all together tonight lord may we not hear lord the ideas or words of a man but lord may your voice speak to each heart tonight father god and meet every need we ask we thank you for it we're thanking you for the victory lord for this service in advance and we ask that you're granted in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen matthew chapter 16 verse 13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church he's going to have a church and he's going to be the builder of it and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this evening i want to speak for the next the next little while we'll try to be conscious of the time but we want the lord to have his way tonight and we always feel a welcome spirit to the word of god when we come here and we thank the lord for that we want to speak tonight on the prevailing power of revelation amen the prevailing power of revelation jesus said the gates of hell shall not prevail against it they're going to try they're going to fight and they're going to battle and they're going to do everything they can to stop it but jesus said the gates of hell shall not prevail against it jesus was establishing the basis or the foundation that his church would be built on now there's going to be all kinds of people there's going to be all kinds of churches there's going to be all kinds of ideas and all kinds of religions there's going to be all kinds of religious leaders rise up and and attract a following and a religion be formed as a result of that but there's going to be one that's his amen he's going to have one jesus said i'm going to have a church and i'm going to be i'm going to build it and this is what it's going to be built upon and it cannot be defeated amen it would be the revelation of himself that would give the church the power to be invincible amen not just to defend the attack of satan amen not not just to come away with a few wounds or a few casualties but the the power of the revelation of jesus christ to the individual to the church amen would be an invincible power against every attack of satan no matter what weapon he employs amen no matter what he tries amen no matter how powerful the attack he puts against the church we have already been given the assurance amen that the power of revelation will make us invincible against every attack of satan amen and the prophet of god says here in the revelation of jesus christ he says it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil amen it is the revelation of god that will give you amen every every man every woman every child amen every husband every housewife amen you may not have an education you may not have a dime in the bank account but if you've got this revelation you have authority over the devil tonight amen and you can see why they who would add or take away from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word amen now i'm not going to turn to it tonight but you can read this in daniel chapter 10 if you would like to to to look at it later daniel kneels by the riverside one day the river is the river high decal and he begins praying for revelation he has seen uh he in chapter 9 he realized by books that he was in the time of the fulfillment of jeremiah's prophecy and so he he he he didn't just want a general idea of where he was in the unfolding he wanted to know exactly where he was so he began praying and in chapter 9 this takes place and then in chapter 10 it happens again i think some years later so that this time daniel begins praying for revelation and the bible says that for 21 days daniel prayed and he fasted he stayed right there on his knees praying for revelation for 21 days and when the angel finally reached daniel he said daniel i'm come to give you wisdom and understanding for this is great he said this is actually something that's going to take place in the latter days but i'm going to reveal it to you now but he said and he said daniel i i hadn't been waiting 21 days to to start my journey here he said i started here on day one he said from the moment you begin praying for revelation i started my way to come and bring it to you but he said daniel something happened that's never happened before in all the history of the bible we don't have a recorded instance where it took 21 days for something one of his children was praying for to be answered and to be heard so why would satan fight this so hard i wonder why and you might have a good idea tonight of why but i want us just to take this for a moment and maybe imagine a little dramatization what may have begun taking place in other realms when daniel knelt by the riverside and began praying for revelation now we know the devil is roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour he's got evil spirits spread all over the earth amen to steal to kill and to destroy amen to entice to tempt amen to destroy the lives of men and women boys and girls he's working around the clock 24 hours a day in all the regions of the earth anywhere souls are present satan is fighting and he's got his demons on missions amen these demons they grow in rank and they grow in uh they gain a victory record they they become skilled at their craft of deception amen of enticement of destroying souls and destroying lives and so they ascend and rank amen they they they they are working all throughout the earth to achieve the devil's purpose and the devil is in headquarters lucifer is at the central command station and he's there giving the assignments and he's watching the effects of these demons and he's he's hearing the reports come back and he knows who the who the uh active demons are and the successful demons and he knows who the juniors are and the the slackers and and the ones who are just getting started you know and the devil's got a big red button on the control panel of hell and this button the purpose of it is to send out a message or a page i guess in today's terms we would say a text to every demon they've got a a device on their side and when this signal goes out the signal is to return to base immediately there is an emergency that requires the attention of every demon and so when daniel knelt by the riverside to begin to pray satan saw what was happening and he goes over and for the first time in history he smashes the red button and so the demons begin streaming in from their their assignments throughout the earth you know some of the slackers they was just right outside the gate it didn't take him any time to get in there and find a seat but some of these senior demons and and the real skill in the ones that had the the top i mean most critical assignments it took them some time to get back because they'd been tempting believers i mean they'd been attempting a new converts and and they've been veteran believers they've been enticing and working against and fighting against mothers and fathers and children pastors and evangelists and they were out here you know in all sorts of missions and this had never happened before so they were wondering what could be so important that for the first time ever this alert is going forth and calling us back to the home base and so they gather in and they're they're all they're all excited they're all you know kind of this has never happened before so they're all wondering in their mind what has prompted this what has caused you know what what is going on and and and they're bumping one another do you know what it is no do you know what it is no and so finally finally the lucifer clears his throat and gets all the demon's attention and he says now you're all wondering why i've gathered you here at such short notice but i want to tell you why i've done this and that is the prophet daniel is kneeling by the river high decal and he's praying for revelation and and some of those demons were disgusted they said did did i hear him correctly uh did the only reason we're here is because one man by the name of daniel is praying for revelation could that be so important that i had to drop everything i was doing and travel all this distance and come back here to headquarters just to hear that daniel the prophet is praying for revelation they began to get upset they begin to you know they get they get angry real easy and so they begin to wonder and so they begin to speak up and said listen here i'll i'll have you to know i was i was tempting a minister to commit adultery and it was just on the verge of him giving in i just felt like i was just right at the threshold of succeeding and then this this beeper went off and i dropped my assignment and came back here and no one spoke up said yeah said i had a young person on the verge of suicide i've been working with them for days and for weeks and for months discouraging and depressing and turning them you're turning their friends against them and turning the church against them and all these different things i've been split up the parents had unbroken home i was brought them through a church split and all these different things and they finally got a bad report card and oh my they're beginning to feel these pressures and was just on the verge of suicide and i dropped the assignment to come back here and then they all had their story and satan finally said i don't need to hear no more this he said this is why you are all junior devils and i'm the chief devil because here's what you don't understand all your efforts to make people commit adultery all your efforts to make people stop going to church all your efforts to split people's homes and marriages and commit suicide and all the other things that you're attempting what you don't realize is that that revelation ever reaches that profit and there's people ever catch that revelation your your suicide your adultery your temptation all your other things your depression your discouragement your church spin and church quinn will all be in vain [Applause] because if that revelation ever strikes those people they will become invincible hallelujah and i will become powerless we don't have enough guns we don't have enough bombs we don't have enough viruses we don't have enough enticements we don't have enough temptations we don't have anything in the playbook for revelation [Applause] so every one of them began fighting every one of them joined swords and went out there to try to stop that revelation but daniel just kept praying he kept praying he wasn't like some believers they'd give up after five minutes he didn't give up after seven days he didn't give up after 14 days he didn't give up after 21 days and he was still praying for the carlos he was still seeking it because the bible says knock and the door shall be opened to you seek and ye shall find amen he just kept on praying kept on pressing amen i'm not asking too much of god i'm asking for what's rightfully mine i'm asking for my inheritance you're not asking too much when you ask for your children you're not asking too much when you ask for your husband you're not asking too much when you ask for your wife you're not asking too much when you ask for your healing amen god just wants to know are you really convinced that it's yours because if you are you won't stop praying you can't be defeated you can't be discouraged you know where your help comes from amen hallelujah hallelujah hey man amen god's gonna move here tonight amen somebody's been praying somebody's been believing somebody's been holding on god i don't see nothing changing but i'm gonna keep praying i'm gonna keep believing i don't see the circumstance i don't see them out there moving but you said speak to the mountain hallelujah hallelujah that's the determination of a son and daughter of god amen oh my satan knows if god sends a prophet there's a people who are ordained to hear and believe that message [Applause] satan did not even know who all the people were but he knew if god had a prophet on the scene there must be somebody on that earth that was gonna hear that prophet and believe every word that god spoke through his lips amen because when god sends a prophet he's already got a predestinated people you know elijah got to the place one time he said lord i'm the only one lord it's just me and you i'm the only one all my preaching all my prophets sign all the judgments all the wrath of god all the drought and all the red it's just me and you god said elijah it ain't just me and you i got seven thousand i got seven thousand that you don't even know about they may not even be born till you go off the scene but there's seven thousand that is not about the need to bail they're ordained to hear that message god's got a people on the earth tonight amen that's ordained to hear the message daniel kept praying and the revelation prevailed the message reached daniel you know the message was so great over it took daniel two chapters to describe it but over over in the beginning of chapter 12 the the the the the the bible says that it was such a great vision it was for the end times when there would be a time of trouble such as never was since but it also said your people will be delivered the ones whose names were written in the book my amen it's going to be terrible times there's never been a time like it and never be a time after it like it but there's a people who will be deliberate and their names are written on the book amen it would have to be sealed up again by daniel amen it was so wonderful that satan fought his hardest to keep it from reaching daniel and then when it reached him and it was explained then he said seal it up again but it ain't going to stay sealed forever oh my god this was a jewish prophet god said seal it up but i'm gonna bring a gentile prophet and it's gonna be unsealed again amen let me just share some things with you now remember this brother branham says remember this don't let this slip from your memory christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts [Applause] but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless any or all of those traits coming upon a church are an indication that the antichrist spirit is attempting to defile it it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand it oh my you say brother tim i can see what's happening well that's discerning that's discernment thank god you can see what's happening but now the next thing is can you withstand what's happening oh brother tim it's just oh brother tim i'm not a preacher i'm not even a choir leader i'm not a sunday school teacher i just warmed the pew well let me give you a little insight to when the antichrist spirit tries to creep into the church and how you can discern and withstand it this probably never happens at this assembly but let's just say hypothetically speaking coming to church on sunday morning and it's cold outside and the car wouldn't hardly start and the kids forgot their shoes and somebody spilled a coffee all over your suit or your brand new dress and then you come into the church just a little bit late and your least favorite song leader is up at this pulpit and your least favorite musicians are playing the music and nothing is going your way and the service is feeling a little sticky and a little cold and a little tight the antichrist spirit wants to make it lukewarm formal and powerless so to just blend in it would be the natural tendency to try to slip in find your seat and make as little disturbance as possible and just hope by the time the pastor makes it up to the pulpit he can salvage this service but that is not discerning and withstanding when you walk into church and you realize the devil has been fighting me from the time i woke up this morning he fought through the spouse he fought through the children he fought through the car he fought through everything he could to defeat me in this service not only that that is my least favorite song they're singing and the least favorite they're playing but i'm gonna withstand i'm gonna clap my hands i'm gonna stomp my feet i'm gonna lift my heads i'm going to lift my voice i'm not going to blend in i'm going to create a disturbance in this service i'm going to let the devil know whose side i'm off i'm going to withstand that spirit that wants to kill me down cool me off and make me powerless and formal you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a sunday school teacher all you got to do is have hands and a voice amen a lot of us could cast out devils just by clapping our hands and lifting our voice amen and say i'm going to praise god whether i feel like it or not and any devil that's brave enough to stay on my back will just have to tolerate me while i get on and praise god hallelujah i didn't come here to be given something i come here to get something i come here to lay hold on what's mine god can take that pasture off his sermon off his notes and speak just what i need amen i'll take it from the devil if i have to amen if they discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it hallelujah amen he says with true revelation and he doesn't say in our minds or in our heads he says with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so so jesus asked this question in matthew 16 whom do men say that i the son of man and and it just it's interesting to me that everything they said spoke of former characters some say you're elias some say you're jeremiah's some say you're one of the prophets they all mention a historical person whose life had made a significant impact on the earth but yet they were dead they had fallen subject to the curse of sin that adam brought into the earth oh my and all they could say was maybe you are a a relapse or a resurrection or a revisiting you know maybe you're the sequel to some previous act or display oh my but i want to tell you he's not the i was he's the i am [Applause] amen and you know jesus jesus didn't call the world to be his disciples and he wasn't so interested in the public polls so we made the question more direct and he said but who do you say that i am because this would really be the vindication that his disciples that he had chosen were actually his attributes and had the ability amen to become microphones for the same voice that was speaking through him he said i do nothing till the father shows me amen so he was he was really he was wanting to hear something more than their mind he was wanting to hear something more than their emotions or how they were feeling just at the moment so when he asked the question the second time and he made it personal something spoke through peter that was obviously from a different source than most everything that peter had ever said before [Applause] because when this voice spoke through peter's lips he said thou art the christ exclusive he wasn't ashamed to say it you're the only one thou art the christ the son of the living god amen in so many words he was saying you are jehovah of the old testament you are that god in spirit form amen to reveal itself in all matter of expressions but now you have become flesh now you have become humanity now you have become a kinsmen thou art the christ the son of the living god amen you know in order for you to know who you are you first have to recognize who he is and after peter recognized who christ was christ immediately responds and says and thou art peter [Applause] thou art peter amen now that he has had established who christ was christ was going to establish who he was thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against him and he went on to say i'll give you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven so the voice that spoke from peter wasn't his mind it wasn't his thinking but it came from something god had deposited there eternal representation gained a voice amen the same thing that made him leave his nets and follow christ peter this doesn't happen to just anybody some call them blc bob some call them illegitimate but here peter calls him the christ peter this doesn't happen to just anybody but you have recognized the manifested word in your hour you are blessed amen now you know only a few verses later jesus begins to tell them how he's going to become their sacrifice how he's going to be taken and tried and crucified and buried and peter says oh no lord peter's uh you know peter's own ideas of what jesus ministry would mean and do in his his own involvement with that begin to try to block the very purpose and the very key that would enable peter to become a recipient of the holy spirit indwelling not just an anointing but in a feeling amen so when peter begins to speak oh no lord they'll never they'll ever take you they'll never they'll never take you captive they'll never crucify you jesus said get behind me satan so peter made misstatements but jesus did not excommunicate him he knew the revelation would prevail and when peter was filled with the holy spirit on the day of pentecost amen and when he come out into the streets and the world said what mean is this when peter began speaking jesus never had to retract his statement jesus never had to apologize anymore jesus never had to cover up peter's mistake because now the same voice that spoke to jesus was now speaking through peter as his mouthpiece amen and he said these men aren't drunk as you suppose [Applause] and now peter was able to identify his behaviors as having a scriptural origin and that a prophecy hundreds of years old was no longer a potential waiting to be fulfilled but peter was saying i am the potential of that prophecy this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel what you are seeing display now is the continuation amen is the written word becoming living word amen i always like to say peter never denied they were drunk he didn't deny they were drunk he just said we're not drunk as you suppose he was quite drunk but he wasn't drunk with natural wine he was drunk with the stimulation of revelation amen and it made him appear intoxicated because you know when a person is intoxicated they lose some of their feeling things that would once hurt them don't hurt as much oh my friend i think if we get good and drunk in the holy spirit [Applause] maybe things that bother us right now would not bother us so much if we were just good and intoxicated by the holy ghost and you could just forgive your brother forgive your sister you can just brush off those little things amen that bother you right now and say oh it's no problem i'm still a son of god i'm still a daughter of god nothing's going to change that i'm not worried about it i'm going in the rapture amen hallelujah i believe in spiritual drunkenness i believe in drinking of the new wine man and maybe it's gonna bust some old bottles but i want some and say man new skins to put that wine in oh my i've got to move along but do you believe the prophet of god said that john the revelator was a type of the true overcomer in each or every age you believe that i believe he was also and so here we move over into revelation chapter five this is one of my favorite chapters of the bible and here we see a scene taking place now we know the story john was banished to patmos for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and we know that patmos was an island for criminals to be sent to die because they were unfit to dwell with regular society all hope was gone or lost that they would ever become productive citizens so they were all banished to patmos to die as the worst criminals and a holy ghost pastor was classified as one of the worst criminals they they grouped him right in with the worst death row they just sent him to death row you say well i want a pastor i can be proud of i want to i want a pastor amen that that gets big headlines in the paper and and it's a relationship with the mayor of the city and and the governor of the state and and the pastor that when the president comes to charlotte he wants to shake his head friend if that's the kind of pastor you're looking for about the only affiliation i ever see a holy ghost minister having with a king or a leader is a trial where he's being tried for what he preached he's been falsely accused for what he believed amen and so the preachers standing there trying to convince felix trying to convince agrippa trying to convince herod and even hey you need to believe this too you need to be saved too amen paul was still evangelizing and he said almost now persuades me to be a christian paul that's about the only association with the world leader a holy ghost field minister is ever going to have the rest of the time they're going to be in prison they're going to be in jail they're going to be in stocks and bonds but the angel of the lord will be there to deliver them out amen so we understand the circumstances of the isle of patmos and here is john placed in these conditions but he said i was in the spirit on the lord's day that just shows you no matter what's going on around you you can still be in the spirit and in chapter 5 of revelation he says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on now catch what to me is a key and i'm not a teacher your pastor is a real teacher but what i see in this is the same worthiness that it took to open the book was equivalent to the worthiness that was required to look upon the book now that's a key because at this point no man was worthy no man was found worthy and so in verse 4 we find john's emotional condition it was not the circumstances of patmos that made him this way it was not the rejection of his peers or his community or the jewish religion that made him this way there was one thing that placed john in this condition and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look there on [Music] not as some people has taught it i was hearing a man teach this one time said john wept because that he found himself not worthy oh any man under the holy spirit would know different from that see under the inspiration of god would no different from that but john wept here's what i think he wept for now i'm interested in what a prophet thinks here's what i think he wept for because if no one was worthy and could open this book of redemption the whole creation was lost everything from adam on was lost now remember this is the man who stood at the foot of the cross he did not forsake jesus at calvary he was still there he saw the blood dripping down he's he heard jesus last words he was there at the tomb the morning it was discovered that he was not there he was not as they had left him but he was risen and john had met the resurrected christ had witnessed the glorified body amen had dined amen of fishes and they were uh baked over rolled over the fire amen and had seen the ascension of jesus christ into glory and had been at pentecost when the holy ghost fell and fielded and yet when he realized if nobody is worthy to take this book everything is lost he begins weeping [Music] of course john wept everything was lost but you know what sometimes it's good to have a brother or it's good to have a sister it's good to have somebody standing close to remind you john was looking at the present situation he was looking at the present circumstances and he forgot this isn't the conclusion this is an unfolding of something oh my that is so precious and so wonderful that god has kept it a secret for thousands and thousands of years and thank god there was an elder there thank god there was a brother there there was a sister that who kind of grabbed john and said don't weep john don't weep don't be discouraged don't be defeated remember who you are remember why you were sit here remember you were sent to watch and to write now john get your eyes off your surroundings get your eyes off a situation get your eyes off the circumstance and look up john moore is developing more is happening there's more going on in the world than coven there's more going on in the world than meeting in a hotel room there's more going in the world than your past and your trials and your battles and all the things that's going on in your life there's more happening because you're still alive and god's still on the tone and there's something more that god wants to make known to you [Applause] god couldn't reveal himself as a healer if he was never sick he couldn't reveal himself as a redeemer if he was never lost he could reveal himself as salvation if he was never in prison so sometimes god allows things in your life so he can reveal another characteristic of his power to you personally to produce a higher worship than before to produce a greater appreciation to produce a greater bond a greater connection john lead on jesus prison at the last supper john was on his prism but god was fixing to show john something that would give him a greater love for jesus christ than anything he had ever experienced before oh now would not be a good time to be a devil because i feel the liberty of the holy spirit right here in this place tonight there's some sons and daughters of god amen hallelujah praise god [Applause] one of the others saith unto me weep not behold lift your eyes john look up your redemption draweth nigh weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david [Applause] prevailed this is a prevailing revelation the lion of the tribe of judah for the man said prevail means to wrestle with and overcome there might have been a lot of wrestling and then there was wrestling in gethsemane oh father if it beat i will let this cup pass for me his sweat became his blood and then wrestling wrestling oh power but not my will but time be done he was overcoming his own will his own desires as a mortal man he overcame them hallelujah why to give birth he had to overcome that that mortal man's desires because there was a bride waiting to be born there was a bride waiting to be released from his side glory to god thank you jesus when he stood on the mountain in the temptation in the wilderness satan said if you'll fall down and worship me i'll give you all these kingdoms you can bypass calvary you can bypass gethsemane you can bypass the scourging you can bypass the rejection the misunderstanding oh i'll give it all to you right now but he wrestled and he wrestled and he wrestled with that idea of the easy way versus the predestinated way and he wrestled and he wrestled and he contemplated in his mind and then he remembered some attributes he remembered something on the inside could only be birthed when a roman spear would be thrust into his side and he would say into thy hands i come in my spirit hallelujah i want to tell you when he was wrestling he wasn't just wrestling his own trials he wasn't just wrestling his own battles he was wrestling for every son of god every daughter of god every man hallelujah every woman every boy and every girl that would ever believe on his name he was wrestling on their behalf and when he overcame he did not overcome only for himself but he overcame for you and for you and for you and for you every one of you tonight amen and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony hallelujah hallelujah a prevailing revelation a revelation that would make satan powerless against you hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] what looked like the greatest defeat what appeared to be the most humiliating death was the most glorious life and the most glorious victory that could have ever been fought and hallelujah hallelujah and i be held in low in the midst of the throne in one of the and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts the 420 elders the mode of everything was transformed when they saw him take that book because they saw their identification in him and they saw their worthiness in him and if you have been made worthy to look upon the book and to see the mysteries and for it to be revealed it is understood that he has imparted to you his all worthiness [Music] no sin no guile no shame no stain and when he took the book he was claiming the names or the identities of every son and daughter of god in that book and he said i wrote them in my blood and i've washed them in my blood and i redeemed them in my blood and there is no difference between who i am and between who they are we are one and the same as i am worthy they are worthy as i have been accepted they have been accepted as i have overcome they have overcome [Applause] hallelujah what a mighty god we serve tonight no wonder we shout no wonder we sing no wonder we praise him no wonder we love him no matter we come to church no wonder how can you be silent when you see what the lamb has done [Applause] if these hold their peace the rocks are going to cry out but they're not going to hold their peace hallelujah oh my god [Applause] they all fell down they took their harps their vials and they sung a new song if if you watch in chapter 4 they sang a song they sang a song and they said thou hast created us for thy pleasure all things for your pleasure that has created us [Music] well he created a lot of things he created lucifer he created angels which fell and became demons he gave life in the womb to reprobate and unregenerate so to know him as creator is one thing but open book worship like we see in chapter five brought their relationship with the lamb up to another level [Music] now they see him as creator and redeemer for thou hast redeemed us by thy blood and it broke all national barriers all cultural barriers all racial barriers amen all statuses out of every kindred every people every tongue and every nation [Applause] those were all temporary conditions that became a result of things like babylon the tower of babylon in the fall of adam in the garden but to be redeemed means that you were somewhere and you had a certain value in the first place so when they said thou hast redeemed us what they were saying was we have been restored back to everything that we were before any of this happened before adam fell before he fell before abraham lied before david committed adultery before moses grew angry and smote the rock [Applause] thou hast redeemed us by thy blood and has made us unto our god kings and priests [Applause] and you know what all those created angels all those created angels begin to realize we're about to get a break we're about to get a break from our worship because those people can worship god in a way that we cannot [Applause] they know god in a way we know not and when they begin to worship god our worship will settle amen our worship amen will subside to make room for the worship of the redeemed oh my praise the lord john said i heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and of the beasts and the elders remember those beasts were represented by men those elders are represented by men the patriarchs the 12 disciples matthew mark luke and john and they were all saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and john said in the midst of all of them worshiping god with a loud voice yet every creature every creature which is in heaven and in earth and under the earth and those that are in the sea you know it's kind of hard for sound to travel through water but john said he did everything in the sea he said it god thought enough of it to put it in his bible it must be the truth see this prevailing revelation gave john a voice that could drown out every other voice oh it took preeminence over every other voice brother solomon the voice of the redeemed overcomer took preeminence over the websites over the critics over the doubters i mean if it could take preeminence over the other worshipers you know there was no doubters there were no skeptics there were no websites there was nothing john's voice took preeminence over every other sound and every other voice in all the creation hallelujah you know something they say there's two things you can't talk and listen at the same time so if you're praising god you can't be listening to the devil if you're praising god you can't be listening to what the doctor or your unsaved husband or your unsaved wife or your lost boss or whatever if you're praising god surely you can't be hearing those other voices [Applause] every creature heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever oh my is it okay just to take a few more minutes notice he is not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne who was it the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand remember brother bannon said satan's filthy hands couldn't hold on to it he thought he would take it from adam and then he found out even his hands couldn't even hold on to it i like that satan has no control over you or me he couldn't even hold the book for a split second when adam forfeited it it went right back into the hands of god amen and no angel could take the place this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen god's law is required he's the one that holds it god's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out holding it i am their kinsmen [Music] you don't have to worry about claiming to be sons and daughters of god he claimed you he said i am their kinsmen i am blood relation to them amen it's not so much a matter of whether or not you feel worthy to be identified with him he identified himself with you he said i am their kinsmen amen i am their kinsmen i've made intercession for them and now i've come to claim their rights for them amen there's the only one i've come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and i've paid the price oh brother don't that make you feel religious inside not by good works which we have done but by his mercy you know the next time we see this book it's in revelation chapter 10. i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the left his left foot punchy or see and lead i may have those crossed but you see the book is here again and if you read down a little further there's another prophet and all the devil can try to do is stop that revelation from reaching that prophet the same way he tried to stop that revelation from reaching daniel so what does he do when this prophet is on the earth and it's coming up to time to begin laying in the teaching and the foundation and the preaching he throws a tax case he throws every distraction every obstacle every smear every state shuts down the campaigns sends them back to jeffersonville i'm not even sure he could travel overseas because of having to deal with this court case it was like a brother branham was being charged as a criminal he's being charged as a criminal that's the same thing they booked al capone for was tax evasion and here the gods profit amen which would take a hundred dollar a week salary after no doubt thousands and thousands in offerings amen and turn the rest of it over to to the missions and the ministry expenses here comes the federal government of the united states the irs and charges him with tax evasion i guess the devil didn't learn with daniel he didn't learn with john and he didn't learn with god's prophet either and i'll just read to you here from the breach you say is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that redemption come the lamb that had been slain be from the foundation of the world and he took the book opened the book and tore off the seals now notice this is this is christ doing all of these he took the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people the devil failed again all that in hell failed again once again the revelation has made it to the prophet and as of making it to the prophet there's also an ordained people on the face of the earth amen [Music] i'm going to read that again just because i like it so much it wasn't the prophet that did this it wasn't brother breton that did this it was jesus christ that did this he took the book opened the book tore off the seals and set it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people oh my god and you know what they wrote right here you know what they wrote right here after that you know what they put congregation greatly rejoices they did the same thing in jeffersonville that they did on patmos what john saw on patmos say man is again happening in jeffersonville when these people amen begin to realize they are included in that great work of redemption hallelujah congregation rejoices he says there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation and old john who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in the earth and everything in the sea heard me holler amen amen blessings honor and might and power be to him that lives forever and ever amen i'm closing tonight musicians can come back but i want to say this there is an ordained channel for god to reveal himself satan couldn't prevent the revelation from reaching the prophet now all he can do is try to keep you from receiving it and if he can occupy your time he can occupy your attention if he can weaken your confidence if he can make you ashamed if he could make you doubtful if he can do anything to hinder that channel he's got you but there's some people that's got the same level of determination that daniel had i know it's for me and all the devils in hell ain't gonna stop me from receiving what god has sent for me you know in in daniel's day when he couldn't stop it from reaching daniel the next thing he tried to do was make them worship daniel the same thing's happening again the revelation has already reached the prophet and he holds the scriptural position and we shouldn't take anything away from that or fail to give respects to that amen but to try to worship him doesn't do away with what god did in him amen and that's just a smoke screen that the devil has put there to try to weaken people's confidence in the vessel that god used amen he tried to make an idol out of him but the three hebrew children did not lose confidence in what god had done in daniel and they did not worship him they stood for the truth and god fought enough of their stand god had such high esteem for the three hebrew children stand for what daniel pointed them to that when they went in the fiery furnace god would not let a substitute angel go down there god said they stood for me on earth and now i am going to earth to identify myself with them and i believe in the fiery furnace of 2021 if you will stand for the truth god will come from glory and appear in the skies to identify himself with you and to call you up to glory amen amen in a glorified body to identify you as the bride of jesus christ amen if you can be a proud enough tonight if you can have enough understanding to stand for this revelation if you can see it was not god revealing a man it was god revealing himself if you can see christ in the message if you can see christ in those seals if you can see the revealing of the son of man and you can realize it's the invisible union of the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom then god god has already i mean he's already on his way i just believe that tonight i believe the rapture is in motion amen i believe we're still praying we're still pressing we're still believing amen but the rapture is already in motion soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side all the saints of glory will assembled be would you like to stand this

redemption but after his resurrection he made a little fire there on the on the shore by the sea and he said come and nine you might have deserted me you might have fled you might have forsaken me you might have cursed swore and denied any association whatsoever with me but in so many words jesus was telling them my choice stands even when your choices fail that's the kind of love that's the redemption lord jesus oh god i believe tonight you've made a little fire on the shore of the sea and you have prepared just what you know our souls are in need of and no matter what little ship we may

oh lord we worship you [Music] give him a praise offering tonight amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah somebody's delivered tonight somebody else is filled tonight hallelujah somebody we see the mark of christ tonight something that's going to change your life something that's going to be a memorial for you amen the devil is turned completely out he has taken his hands off your life amen stay consecrated hallelujah what a deliverance what a message tonight hallelujah [Music] he was not even with me at work i can show you scripture that i was writing and it's going to amaze you the deacon knows exactly where i'm coming from church we have been tremendously blessed by almighty god people's life are changing people are getting filled people are receiving deliveries and to see a message in this manifold this is nothing but the grace of god amen even when we are disclosing the black dog there is a key to that and brother robert even whispered to me tonight and the brother read the message here why do we go to those details why do we have to expose the devil like that you don't know what kind of fight we are putting up with just by opening those avenues amen brother tim cross read the quote tonight and i'm going to read it again he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church you know we demonstrated here that god lived in the tabernacle then from the tabernacle he went to the temple of solomon amen then the promise says that the lord will come and enter his temple and when jesus look at the building he says destroy this temple and in three days i'm going to rebuild it they thought god was still pointing to the temple of solomon god already changed to a human temple and that first temple was jesus christ amen that was actually the archetype that was the main thing all at the temple were only taps and shadow but he was the temple of god amen then on the day of pentecost he said i think it's pigeon for me to go and to send the same holy spirit now not on that temple but on many others temple and paul came and unfold the revelation and paul said that we are the temple of the living god amen so when we refer to church sometime we have a tendency to look at a building we have a tendency to look at a gathering which is true we also have a tendency to look at the church age as a whole as the church of laodicea which we are specifically called the blood of jesus christ today but i want you to look at the church as yourself as you as an individual brother branham said the same way god deal with the age that's the same way he's dealing with a local church and that's the same way he's dealing with you as an individual so when i'm gonna read this quote put yourself as the church don't look at spoken word tabernacle look at yourself as the church and listen to what he says amen hallelujah he says when he knows that if the people if you get the true revelation of the true church of who truly you are amen and what she is esther esther we are still on 24. esther are you there she stand for on sunday we showed you that you were made for a purpose remember that you were made specifically wonderfully marvelously for god pleasure and for a purpose amen he said what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army now watch this if they get a true revelation of the true spirit you follow me within the framework of the christian church which church am i talking about who if you understand that within you there is two dogs you understand now if you get the revelation of the black dog that is in your flesh that paul spoke in romans 7 that whenever i want to do good there is the spirit if you understand the revelation of the two spirit the two dogs working inside of you in your framework church if you understand that that's why we are opening the black dog because once you catch that revelation once esther unfold amen watch again blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah if she get the true revelation of the two spirit within not outside that's why paul said i see a law within me within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit which is the white dog if you let the white dog dominate you let joshua handle that a malachite are you there hallelujah within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit that black dog satan will be powerless before her all we are folding is just to show you give preeminence to christ let the black dog rule let the white dog rule and he's gonna tame the black dog amen he's just gonna be there like in the millennium he will be there but he will be powerless until redemption until the full redemption comes when our bodies are changed they're gonna kick him out and he goes back to hell but that takes the second feast of esther to kick aim and completely out amen when we get to that you're gonna see even the the even the place that the the the second fist the second banquet was organized and you see exactly that place is telling you it is no longer in laodicea he was in the bright age church we have been tremendously blessed this brother moved completely out of the way he doesn't know what's going on you don't know how many people are getting delivered some of those stuff i cannot say them here because it's people private life it's one after the other one after the other one after the other one after the other why because you stirred the devil right where he said amen we need the power of resurrection if not we will be housing demon for years and we're going to be called formal just be message believer and no fire we need a fire that can disturb the devil amen amen so don't run come on sunday let's disclose couple sunday ago we disclosed that even men are not supposed to wear bracelet we showed you by the scripture now nobody can say i don't know it we're gonna show you everything by the scripture and back it up by the message of the hour and you will see why and it's only tricks that the devil is trying to give you a different identity than what god already gave you amen and lord willing you're gonna see how can satan comes and tell eve that if you partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you're gonna be like god what was eve to begin with what was eve what was adam the bible says in luke 3 2 3 38 adam the son of who and the son of god is whole so what kind of god was lucifer trying to give them you see what i'm saying if was already god i'm going to show you in the scripture on sunday and satan said you're going to be like god amen you are already beautiful the way god made you [Applause] you are already wonderful the way god made you but certain want to put something else in you to destroy your identity you see what i'm saying you see what the devil is trying to do because according to ezekiel 16 that we have been digging deep on it god came and was worrying about failing that woman at puberty why is the clothing important when the woman turned to puberty we disclosed all of this in ezekiel 16. why was god worrying about failing adam and eve after they ate their eyes become open if you don't understand that trial in teenager that trial will come back in menopause exactly the same thing because teenager was turned on by hormone we demonstrated to you by the prophet and by the word of god by ezekiel 16. it was the hormone that opened the black dog amen and then when you get to menopause your hormones are shut off and that same temptation you have as a teenager is coming back again to meet you you got to be prepared for it we thank god for his deliverance it's good to be in church it's very good to be in church brother tim thank you very much that's why i love people who knows how to handle the sword amen that was a tremendous blessing amen you know what happened to peter you know what happened to peter because he got the revelation jesus said peter i pray for you and not only did he pray when he resurrected he said god tell my disciple and that peter i don't want him to build a complex then he goes again he said peter do you love me why he didn't ask anybody else only peter why only peter why in the day of pentecost only peter why peter do you love me three times do you love me do you love me why do you keep insisting on peter he was the one that got that revelation of christ peter say christ the son of god do you know what the son of god means do you know what the son of god means take john chapter 5 and we go home usually people when they say son of god they're looking at the father and a son that's what we look usually i'm sorry it's not me it's brother tim cross who preached so he's the one that kept bringing this stuff to me you there go to john chapter 5 verse 18. oh my god i'm already sweating under the anointing amen i thought to keep it even on sunday but i'm going to say it when brother john began to pray for me on sunday here i felt an anointing coming back straight and hit me on my right side my heart my right shoulder i was sick sitting there and preparing to preach and suddenly i was delivered i could bend move nobody knew anything except myself do you know what happened know what happened go watch the tape on sunday sister lorell came here with her daughters and they begin to sing and the theme of the song she sang was exactly the trial the devil put me on because of what i'm preaching amen and she say they're gonna call your name something like that you hear the name today you heard the name today and she said stephen you are healed this morning go listen to it go listen to it go back again when prophecy come to the church we need to go back seat and play the tape over to make sure everything is lined up she says stephen you are healed this morning and she started jumping under the anointing how did she know i was healed there while nobody else knew it is called the gift of the word of knowledge if you need the code see me i will send you that quote but what i'm saying a gift of a word of knowledge is a gift that can tell what happened already or what is in the future amen it was not sister royal it was god who did it then i came after her and testify [Music] god is in this church are you there [Music] let's go to john chapter 5 verse 18 then i'll let you go home if you dare you can say amen therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that who god was who if you stop right there there is a father there is a child that's a gentile understanding that's why you need a prophet amen watch now god was his father karma making himself what we thought in other words when jesus was saying i am the son of god the jews understood clearly that jesus was telling them i am god this is a deity without a court i can sit with you an hour and give you code scripture scripture scripture about the deity of jesus christ the message is perfectly in line with the scripture amen so the revelation when jesus said when peter say i am you are the son of god just like brother explained to man jesus peter was telling jesus that you are christ the son of the living god in other words you are crust you are amen that's why when satan was tempting jesus jesus said you shall not tempt who the lord your who who was straight and tempting so jesus is whole when thomas uh darted jesus came he said thomas come here go ahead and stick your finger here thomas say my lord and my i have a whole list of scriptures i can go with you from the old testament show you that the jehovah of the old testament is who jesus of the new testament church take your hands off your life put your car in neutral brother evo let your redeemer the one who pay your price let him handle your life and everything will go even if you go through fire he's going to be there if you get in a fiery furnace he's there don't we we we work a lot the holy ghost is a sabbath the holy ghost is a rest rest meaning you leave you sit down like a roof go rest get six measure of valley go eat let me handle the work of redemption amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for this wonderful message tonight a pure word of deliverance that was sent to your children because your word stated that when you send the word it shall never return to your void father we thank you for the brother yielding himself making himself available lord father and his family and brother solomon coming together lord to be a blessing to this portion of the bread father may you bless him may you strengthen him may you give him the desire of his heart because nothing is impossible to you father nothing is impossible to you father nothing is impossible to you [Music] no matter how long he took [Music] no matter how it seems like we got comfortable with the situation lord you can break that completely loose not for my glory but for your glory father gave it unto him lord touch this church father bless them protect them on the road and protect those that are online and those that will be streaming back further to catch up because they were a work or for certain circumstances father claimed the blood upon your children father keepers again centered deep into the revelation of your word we ambly ask it and commit it all thank you for this message thank you for your healing thank you for your deliverance thank you for coming again tonight father and stressing again the worthiness that has been granted unto us by the lamb no wonder father you brought a message of justification in a higher level stating that we never done it to begin with because you took our place lord you wiped that old ordinance that was condemning us father you narrated the cross and by the power of the scepter you open the door to the gentile father now we are called not the servant like the jews but the very brother bonds of your bones fresh off your flesh father thank you for such a great great privilege that you have given us father we commit all and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen whatever if you can lead us with one song then you can dismiss please hallelujah you have won the victory [Music] you have wanted all for me that could not hold you down you are the reason king seated in majesty you are the reason king one more time church say [Music] of hallelujah any situation in your life he's won the victory all for me death could not hold you down you are the reason king seated in majesty you are the reason and as they keep playing that softly i looked up in our definition of the word prevail after brother tim said what he said and it said prove more powerful than the opposing forces be victorious and i thought that was incredible i thought that was incredible i found the definition he said as well in the service but i'm going to read that one more time prove more powerful than the opposing forces be victorious so church i'm going to leave you with that thought as you're dismissed be victorious going to work tomorrow be victorious and if you don't feel victorious sing these words you have won the victory it's not by anything we have to do god's done it he's won the victory we just look to him we claim our promises y'all are dismissed we'll do this one more time [Music] you have won the victory amen hallelujah you have wanted all for me and that could not hold you down you are the reason king
