[57:08] it Joshua had to take over the city of
[57:11] Jero amen
[57:15] amen but Jer had might Warriors that
[57:19] were living there amen
[57:23] amen and nobody was was able to take the
[57:27] city and God gave them the
[57:32] city and God gave them
[57:35] instructions that they have to follow

[57:46] Jero they never took any
[57:50] weapon they never carry something they
[57:52] never take took a
[57:56] amen they only follow God's instructions
[57:59] amen
[58:01] amen and they were just going around the
[58:04] city as God instructed
[58:07] them and at the seventh day at the
[58:11] seventh
[58:12] time God
[58:17] spoke he told them that the priest will
[58:19] blow the
[58:21] trumpet and after the blowing of the
[58:23] trumpet you will shout amen
[58:27] amen and you will just
[58:31] shout you don't have to say anything

[59:15] testifying just by thanking
[59:18] him because we are remembering his good
[59:21] feed amen
[59:23] amen
[59:25] and Joshua applied the
[59:27] word he did it and they were praising
[59:31] the Lord they were
[59:33] singing and they
[59:35] shouted and the walls of Jericho went
[59:38] flat

[1:00:22] your sickness then he will take care of
[1:00:25] your
[1:00:27] finances then he will take care of your
[1:00:30] situation that's why you
[1:00:34] saw when we went to Zechariah Chapter
[1:00:38] 4 where God is asking a question who are
[1:00:41] that great
[1:00:42] Mountain you will come
[1:00:46] down because he will
[1:00:49] bring with

[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] the the the the food that God
[1:00:59] eat it's
[1:01:02] worship when you
[1:01:05] look in Revelation chapter
[1:01:08] 5 when John was
[1:01:11] there when he was before the
[1:01:14] L and there was a book that no one was
[1:01:17] able to
[1:01:18] take and when you continue with the

[1:01:58] will
[1:02:00] notice every time you worship
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:04] God God always does
[1:02:08] something no matter your
[1:02:11] condition no matter your
[1:02:14] situation but God is able to do
[1:02:17] something about it amen
[1:02:21] amen I'm going to read something
[1:02:29] the identification of Christ in all
[1:02:33] ages in paragraph
[1:02:37] five 1964 April
[1:02:41] 9th brother Bram says
[1:02:44] this we pray for the
[1:02:52] sick and we don't claim to be a Healer
[1:02:55] or somebody can heal
[1:02:59] someone we believe that there is only
[1:03:02] one
[1:03:03] Healer that is
[1:03:11] God but we believe that he ordained man
[1:03:14] to pray for the
[1:03:15] sick and we do
[1:03:18] that we pray for the
[1:03:22] sick and the Lord has been gracious to
[1:03:26] us to answer our
[1:03:28] prayers so many
[1:03:31] times and we around the
[1:03:34] world we have seen
[1:03:41] well just multiply thousand time
[1:03:44] thousand of people cre
[1:03:47] Afflicted
[1:03:49] blind
[1:03:53] lame
[1:03:55] blind and then
[1:03:58] the and we just believe that
[1:04:03] us the Bible say he was wounded for our
[1:04:07] transgression with his
[1:04:10] trap we were
[1:04:12] healed and we
[1:04:15] believe that is the
[1:04:19] benefit that is the
[1:04:22] privilege of two given to the Believers
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:33] amen let me go to paragraph
[1:04:39] seven
[1:04:43] amen it doesn't make us to be a
[1:04:48] Healer no more than the preaching of
[1:04:51] Salvation it doesn't make us Sav
[1:04:57] we know that there is only one
[1:04:59] Healer and we know that there is only
[1:05:03] one and it's the only person the same
[1:05:06] the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[1:05:10] here to glorify
[1:05:12] him in the midst of the people amen
[1:05:20] Amen brother Bram is showing that we we
[1:05:23] PR
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:26] we are not the one healing the
[1:05:31] people but we are only fulfilling our
[1:05:33] duty to pray for the
[1:05:37] sick even if you go to the hospital you
[1:05:39] meet a
[1:05:41] doctor it's the same thing they can only
[1:05:44] take care of
[1:05:45] you so that God can take over amen with
[1:05:49] healing
[1:05:51] amen because healing only belongs to
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:56] God uh give me some time let me take off
[1:05:59] my
[1:06:01] suit
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:05] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:06:13] Lord that's why you would notice in the
[1:06:15] sermon Jehovah in
[1:06:19] 1959 Ro brother Bram was speaking about
[1:06:22] John Ryan
[1:06:24] he was a blind
[1:06:27] man and brother Bram prayed for
[1:06:33] him and after a while the man was still
[1:06:35] blond he said I cannot
[1:06:38] see and brother Bram told
[1:06:41] him there is one thing you need to do
[1:06:44] just go ahead and continue to testify
[1:06:46] that I can
[1:06:48] see and one
[1:06:50] day so he was at the barber shop
[1:06:56] and if you notice
[1:06:58] John when he went to the bar
[1:07:02] shop the his b begin to mock
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] him and he told him you went to that
[1:07:11] Divine
[1:07:13] healer and they told me that you were
[1:07:16] healed can you
[1:07:19] see John
[1:07:22] Ryan
[1:07:24] he never compromised with his
[1:07:29] faith he didn't play with the
[1:07:33] word he say whatever God declare about
[1:07:38] me and he took a hold of what God told
[1:07:42] him if only tonight you can also take a
[1:07:46] hold of what God told
[1:07:48] you and he says yes I can
[1:07:52] see he say praise the Lord I can
[1:07:56] see and
[1:07:58] suddenly his eyes popped up open amen
[1:08:03] amen the problem
[1:08:05] today we Christian is
[1:08:09] that Christian don't know where they're
[1:08:13] standing no matter their
[1:08:17] situation when Jesus faced the
[1:08:20] devil when the devil was tempting him
[1:08:24] Jesus always reply it is
[1:08:28] written because the devil knew a portion
[1:08:31] of the
[1:08:33] word and Jesus said it is also
[1:08:38] written he never went away from the
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:44] word one day he was uh
[1:08:48] at he was in the synagogue and then he
[1:08:51] read the
[1:08:52] book Jesus said today this day this
[1:08:55] scripture has been
[1:08:58] fulfilled and that scripture belong to
[1:09:00] Christ amen
[1:09:02] amen it was a scripture that pertained
[1:09:06] to and Jesus was the
[1:09:09] hair and we are joint with
[1:09:14] him if there is a scripture that belong
[1:09:16] to the group my brother my
[1:09:20] sister that same scripture
[1:09:22] that they also spoke about
[1:09:26] you God also spoke about you in the
[1:09:30] word why don't you take the promises of

[1:09:41] problem when You Face
[1:09:43] sickness just use the
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:48] scripture for
[1:09:51] instance I'm sick
[1:09:54] what did he declare about
[1:09:58] me am the Lord that healed thee from all
[1:10:02] that there is no exception about the
[1:10:05] sickness so when you repeat
[1:10:08] that God T about
[1:10:13] it and the prophet
[1:10:16] spoke the responsibility is to you to
[1:10:19] confess
[1:10:22] it knows what is in your
[1:10:26] heart but God won't do it if you don't
[1:10:30] confess God already
[1:10:32] taught his
[1:10:34] servant his servant already spoke now
[1:10:38] the responsibility is up to you to take
[1:10:41] and then to speak it back amen
