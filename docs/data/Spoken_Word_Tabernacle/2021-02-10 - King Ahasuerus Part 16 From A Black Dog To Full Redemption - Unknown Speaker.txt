living clean and undefiled you keep that message flying high because you can quote the prophet all you want if your life is not shunning the message then the message is powerless to those that lives with you amen we thank god for everything for his grace his mercy and giving us another opportunity to be here tonight to fellowship around the revealed word of the hour we concluded the vote on sunday there were few people that say no we respect that and everybody have a freedom and a liberty to say to vote as the fair led by the holy spirit but the majority win except if for those people that says no if you have a strong legitimate reason that is based on the scripture strong one you need to contact me before next sunday if by next sunday nobody says anything it is sealed until next year when we redo the vote so if you have a reason or you see somebody drunk and you have a picture or something like that you need to bring it to me then regardless of what the majority say we need to look that over amen but if i don't hear anything and you just say no because you felt led by the holy ghost to say no so the majority wins everybody clear so by next sunday if i don't hear anything it is still till next year if the lord tarries everybody clear so far on sunday lords willing we will have brother blue from south carolina preaching for us amen so keep the service in prayer and continue to stay tight in prayer because we don't need to leave our hand going down we need to keep it up so that amalek will not win let's go to the sermon tonight let's go to our scriptures if you have your bible you need to have one in this church and you need your bible tonight we're still continuing on where we left off on sunday so you really really need your bible amen genesis chapter 6 hallelujah some amen corners are not here because they're working and they might be streaming so when they stream online amen i won't hear them i need that fuel so if you hear holler amen okay okay in this church we're free to say amen genesis chapter 6 if you dare you can say amen we're still continuing on the same subject verse 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them amen that the sons of god not the sons of devils amen not the one that are drunk over there we are talking about the sons of god how many believes the son of god tonight and daughters of god tonight yes so the bible is talking about the sons of god amen the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair so there is an attraction to beauty here toward the daughter of men when they say beauty fair it's beautiful you might be seated so something happened to the sons of god they begin to get attracted to the women amen and if you study this these women these daughters that were fair were daughters of cain amen so something happened to the sons of god that they became they they start getting some kind of feeling toward the women from canada or the k-9 women verse two that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives brother branham said the correct translation there is they took women women we believe the message amen and they took them wives of all which they chose so they get on the internet they just look look look look at picture and peek amen praise the name of the lord verse 3 and the lord say the lord didn't say anything until this happened until the children of god begin to court or to date the people of the world when they did that then god reacted amen and the lord say my spirit the holy ghost shall not always strive in other words i can't put up with this don't expect the the spirit of god or the anointing of god to put up with you when you begin to look on the outside it won't happen he grieves the holy spirit amen we are preparing you to the sacred banquet my spirit shall not always strive or put up or contain with men for that he also is flesh carnal and to be carnally minded is death we already preached to you that yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years because of this because of the interest of the sons of god toward the women of the world amen the spirit of the lord was grieved and god even put a limitation on the life of someone instead of going 600 years 900 years like adam god shorten the time amen in other words you're going to a premature grave amen because of daring the outside verse four they were giant in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came into the daughters of men amen they started getting into the physical amen at the beginning they saw the beginning it was just a sight they saw he was in the mind he was all spiritual amen that's number one once the spiritual is consumed then the second thing that started they get into the physical amen that's why jesus said if a man looketh unto a woman and last after her so there was the last that happened here hallelujah there was the last that happened here in a spiritual you have already committed what adultery so what happened on a physical is nothing else but an expression a manifestation of what happened in the spiritual amen if you are born again in the spirit it will all the way before we get into that place once the lord jesus christ come what happened on the inside of you will be manifested outside that's the cry of david amen so when they begin to come into the daughters of men and they bore children to them amen the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown they begin to have stars american adults verse 5 and god saw the wickedness of man so this is not a marriage because if it's marriage marriage is honorable by god but this is not marriage when god saw those sin taking care taking places where the children of god begin to have affair or begin to have sexual affairs with the children outside god call it wicked when god saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every water it started from the mind right here every imagination right here everybody clear every imagination the birth of it every imagination of the what the thoughts of water that's why jesus said if you look at a woman and you last after her you have already committed adultery where you see the imagination in the amen every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil water in other words all the time you always thinking about something that is bad continually all the time constantly you are under something that is wrong i wish this was a sunday where everybody is there but hope parents will let their kids catch up on this let's go on genesis chapter 34. amen verse 1 if you dare you can say amen over there in genesis 6 we talked about the sons of god anybody clear so the sister will say we are not there because that's the sons i'm not a boy amen let's see part two here who's there brother david do we have some other sharpies first one if you dare you can say amen and dinah the daughter of leah this is not a worldly word this is donna she's the daughter of jacob jacob which is called israel in other words a child of god a daughter of god anybody clear and donna the daughter of leah which she brought to jacob went out to see who the daughters of the land she was living somewhere secluded that looks like they are in a certain camp where they don't fellowship with the outside but for some reason donna left the camp and went outside not to fellowship with the men but she was going to fellowship with the daughters of the land the daughters that are not in the family of jacob just like the sons of god begin to look at the daughter that are not part of the family of god anybody here she opened a door friendship with the world i believe i can have friends outside that are even better than some of the message believers oh my god this is better amen thank you and when she came the son of hemor dehydrated a gentile prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and did water do you know what that means if you look at another translation it means she was raped she was never raped when she stayed in her father's home amen when she exposed herself outside a boy saw her and from there she was completely raped defiled they didn't say she was married anybody clear verse four verse three and he's so clung to donna how can you love a woman after raping her the daughter of jacob and he loved the demsel and spoke kindly to the damsel and she came spoke to his father amor saying get me this themselves as a wife they should have started there first amen they should have started to speak to the parent first before you get into the physical they went into the physical and tried to correct after the black dog the black dog amen and jacob heard that he had married donna okay somebody is awake okay and jacob heard that he had defiled donna his daughter now his sons were with this cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come and emma the father of chicken went out to jacob to commune with him now it's involving the parent it should start there first amen verse 7 and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it they were so happy if it's a good relationship why are they grieved they were grieved and they were very angry because he sheikham had wrote folly in israel in lying with jacob's daughter which thing not to be done lying with jacob's daughter without the proper approach of marriage it's something that is not acceptable amen job to verse 31 and they said should he deal with her sister as with a water not like with a wife a housewife like a harlot she left the camper and she was treated low like a prostitute when you leave the camp when you're trying to go outside this is the way they're going to treat you let's go to second timothy chapter 2 amen second timothy chapter 2 take verse 4 first if you dare you can say amen hallelujah no man that was if you are in war entangles himself with the affairs of this life amen if you know that you're in the stage of battle of war you need to be careful the way you handle your life amen that he may please him who has done what chosen by predestination who has chosen him to be a water so it's a predestination but you need to be careful because you're in a war zone job to verse 19 nevertheless the foundation of god stand what it is firm having this hill the lord knows them that are water and let everyone that names the name of christ depart from what you know better but you still doing it verse 20 but in a great house they are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of what and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor verse 21 if a man therefore purge himself from this he shall be a vessel to honor sanctify and meet for the master's use and prepare to every good work a sanctified vessel is ready to be used by the master verse 22 flee also what the last of your youth amen there is three categories i will see how the holy spirit leads when you are born you are completely turned off at your breath you are turned off completely you are almost like dead everybody clear that's why a child a little girl or a little boy have nothing to do with lust amen they are turned off when you reach puberty adolescence then you are turned on are you following me i'm going to preach this as clear as i can amen from adolescence if you miss the step you normally need to go straight to marriage anybody there if you miss the step you begin to live an unclean promiscuous life are you following me then in the marriage you're gonna go all the way to a certain age which for the sister it's called menopause you need coach for menopause me for the boys the man sometimes they call it like a late puberty amen and after that you are turned back off and you become dead like abraham and sarah their body was good as what dead that's why when god was giving the promise say i say how shall i have what pleasure with my husband she reached the edge where she's turned off the opening of the seven seals let's go to verse 22 flee also the youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity in other words don't entertain the black dog what you need to focus on is everything that follows righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of water a pure heart that is the association that you stay with if you come out of that association you put yourself in trouble anybody clear let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for this church and for us individually in our life so father you have given us another opportunity tonight that we can be gathered together around the reveal word of the hour lord i'm committing myself and this congregation even those that are streaming and those that will be streaming down the road lord into the hand may you move us completely out of the way but may the holy spirit come and speak and minister to your children lord father your children have been at work in school and some are tired in the body lord father but i pray by the name of jesus christ that you let nobody fall asleep because of tiredness lord but may you give them strength and energy lord father to endure so that we can lord feast together around your word and get more strength for the journey as lord the time is approaching for our departure into the rapture lord we committed all be the alpha and the omega may the devil and every pharisees any problem any circumstances be completely sealed out of this place and may only the holy spirit be sealed in heaven open lord pour in your shower tonight lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you last on sunday we were on part 15 we stopped somewhere and we are picking up on part 16. when we get into this sport we express about the cry of david and we found out that the cry of david have a twofold mystery david was crying out of his soul for the redemption of the soul and david also was crying for the redemption of his body or the redemption of his flesh and to simplify the thing we went straight again instead of using body soul spirit we went with romans 7 where we use the inner man and the other man everybody clear and when we use the inner man and the other man on sunday we gave you three scenarios the first scenario which is one is when we are born by birth when we are born david spoke in psalm 51 if i'm not mistaken that we are burning sin shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking lies in other words from our inside i all the way to the uh to the outside we were completely dark and dominated by a nature of sin in other words on the east side you have a black dog and on the outside you also have a black dog and because those two nature are the same when a kingdom have a nature that are on the same christ taught us that that kingdom will never be defiled because there is no way that satan can cast out satan jesus said that if satan cast her satan it means that his own kingdom is divided so once you are as long as you still walking in sin walking in darkness shaping iniquity doing everything that you can here you are completely manifesting the kingdom of the devil everybody clear so far then we went to the second scenario where in the second scenario it is with the coming of the gospel and the holy spirit on the other man or the outside the black dog is still there dominating your body but the work of redemption approaches you from the inner man which is your soul amen so to move from the first scenario all the way to the second scenario it came it comes with the uh the the oncoming of the holy spirit in your life so when the holy ghost comes into your life he approaches your soul and take the nature of sin out of your soul so now you reach a scenario where the outside is still black with the black dog but the inside is now white because god came in your life by the baptism of the holy spirit because if you're a child of god and you were chosen before the foundation of the world on the inside of you there is a predestinated seed then brother branham said the predestinated seed is an absorbent of the holy spirit it is something that when the holy spirit comes he has the power to attract and to lock the holy spirit in your life that's why you are sealed until the day of redemption it is not an anointing that get in and come out but once you are still the work of the inner man is completely done and you are completely redeemed if you die right there you're going straight into the presence of the living god so when the holy spirit comes the predestinated seed will attract it and sell it in your life everybody clear let's take out to chapter 26 as we're moving praise the name of the lord act chapter 26 so when you leave from part one to two you are actually changing kingdom you are living the kingdom of darkness when it was black dog on the inside black dog on the outside and you go into a kingdom of light but that light is not on your body that light is within your soul anybody clear acts chapter 26 if you there you can say amen i will go slowly with this sermon until we get that devil out amen when i say young people if you are not in the same family don't drive together it doesn't mean that i don't trust the young people i trust the young people but i don't trust the black dog amen i trust you but i don't trust the black dog on your flesh amen acts 26 verse 15. if you there you can say amen this is apostle paul and i said who are you lord paul is talking about his experience and he say i am jesus whom you persecute but to rise and stand up on your feet for i have appeared to you for this purpose to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen and of those things in which i will appear to you continuity of the ministry verse 17 delivering you from the people and from the gentile to whom and to whom now i send you verse 18 to do what to open their eyes everybody clear remember when the eyes of paul were open physically the bible says that the holy spirit entered into him and he was filled with the holy spirit he said to open their eyes and to turn them from water from darkness from one everybody where it's black dark black dog to turn them from darkness to what to light and from the power of satan to water so right here you are completely and totally under the power of satan but on the outside now you are changing kingdom but even though you are changing kingdom you are still in the world that's why jesus said you are in the world but you are no more of the world you are still living on the planet earth under the politics under the cosmos of this world but your inside is no longer of the world you are longing like abraham for a city whose builder and maker is god this world become uncomfortable for you because you don't fit in the reason why you don't feel it because the inside man is a regenerated man again everybody clear praise the name of the lord and from the power of satan to god that they may receive water forgiveness of sin and what inheritance among them which are water sanctified by what faith which is a gift of god remember sanctified by faith which is a gift of god not only are you are your sin remitted or forgiven but you also receive an inheritance among the believer everybody clear sanctified by faith that is in who that faith is in god that's why paul said it is a gift of god you cannot receive that faith except god give it to you that's why he said peter it is not flesh it is not blood it is who my father we need to learn to ask god for faith let's go to collection chapter one if you dare you can say amen praise the name of the lord we don't want you to linger trouble about the new birth as we're moving along if you find that what we are describing you by the word is not your scenario before the door of mercy closed you need to seek the holy ghost amen colossians 1 verse 12 if you dare you can say amen giving thanks to who the father which has made us what meat meat to be what partaker damn meat means that he have qualified us amen by predestination you are qualified to be saved amen who made us meet to be partaker of the inheritance remember we just read the inheritance over there of the inheritance of the water in the water those scents are not in darkness they are in the light everybody clear verse 13 who has delivered us from the power of water you see what i'm going on remember the soul is your automation whatever is in the soul automatically put up that's why god getting the salt to remove the root of evil anybody clear who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has done what translated god is moving you from one all the way to two you are not the same amen translated us into the kingdom of his dear water is if he of his dear son verse 14 in whom we have what do you see that through the blood even the water forgiveness of sin ever clear when you are translated into what a kingdom for redemption anybody clear so far so once you move from stage one all the way to stage two then the white dog which is the holy spirit get into your soul as soon as the white dog get in your soul a fight is operated because you drank water from refuge then amalek start a fight with you anybody clear no problem so when this fight start like we spoke on sunday the white uh the black dog purpose is to bring you back again to where you're going so if you feel a pull of trying to pull you toward the world everybody clear it is not a curse anybody clear it is normal for the life of a christian amen the devil needed no effort to pull you in the world because you are part of the world the reason why he's trying to pull you it is a signal that you don't belong to his kingdom anymore that's why the temptation comes to take you back from where you came from amen what you think is a trouble what you think is a difficulty in your christian life you need to interpret that the right way amen that's why paul said it is not me that do it it is sin that dwell in me everybody here then in romans 8 he said there is therefore no word i cannot believe in condemning myself for those who are in water who walk not after that but after the water my desire lord is to please you i don't have a desire to do what is wrong so if i stumble i'm not lost it is the black dog trying to pull me back why is it hard for christian to leave a victorious life amen everybody clear so the black dog pulled this way but the white dog is pulling you forward because the first work here is a down payment you have not paid the house off yet amen it gives you access to the house but you got to make a full price everybody clear and the third stage over there the white dog not only stay here everybody clear but the white dog take over completely the entire body there was a stone there was an image i'm going to give you an example so you get it there was an image in daniel that image had four have four i can call it this way one two three four everybody remember that and that image represented the kingdom of the world everybody clear but there was a stone that came out of the mountain and the stone hit the kingdom here and destroyed the entire image but that stone never stopped there that storm begin to do what to grow to grow to grow until that stone filled the entire earth amen so when god comes in your life he's gonna destroy the kingdom of satan in your soul but the work of god don't stop there leader by leader as you die the holy spirit continues to push out to grow more to grammar to grammar to grammar until one day the gravitational forces of the earth do you want me to explain you because when moses was praying the hand of moses were up the reason why the hand of moses were going down it was because of the force of gravitation the force of gravitation is an opposite of accession amen so as the holy spirit grows more and more one of this day like enoch the forces of gravitation will lose up and you find yourself going up into the air [Applause] everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord let's take first peter chapter one it is time for adoption can be sitting here in warrick worldwide 20 years in the message i'm worrying whether i'm safe or not if you're worrying let's go back to point zero make sure it's all right and let's deal with it first peter chapter one wednesday have something about time that i don't know first peter chapter one verse eight if you dare you can say amen few people first peter chapter 1 verse 8. everybody here whom having not sinned you love that is jesus you have not seen him yet you're already in love with him in whom don't now you see him not yet do what you already believing in him you rejoice with joy water unspeakable and full of water it's coming from the holy spirit verse 9 receiving the water that end means your outcome you following me receiving the outcome of the end of your work faith even the salvation of your in other words by loving god and believing god the result or the outcome of that it will bring salvation to your soul everybody clear by loving believing god the outcome the end result of that accepting the word believing the word it will kick the black dog out of your soul it will bring salvation out of your uh salvation into your soul which brings you to part two anybody clear so far because your soul is saved now job to verse 13. you don't stop there you there now yeah brother mike you got it wherefore do what gird up the lawns of your mind why do you have to gird up the loans of your man why you see now there is a battleground amen don't sit quiet great up the lawns of your mind you already saved cut up the lungs of your man be what you see now be sober and hope to what why do you have to up hope for something else if you already done that means you are not done yet make sense and hope to the end for the water now wait thank you very much i got it on part two here we know that you are saved everybody clear on the inside you have the white dog on the outside you have the black dog amen but this servicing you are saved by what grace do you follow me through what faith which is the gift of god so this work of salvation here is done by water by grace that's what paul told us but here peter is saying that you already have the salvation of your soul but continue to hope for another grace let's go back again verse 13 wherefore gird up the launch of your man be sober and hope to the end further that is to be what so there is another grace that's gonna come to you everybody following me the bible says brother branham says that's the ground i can put you in everybody here i cannot put you on my ground you need to be founded on the scripture anybody clear so peter is saying you already saved but there is another a second grace a second banquet that will come to you are you following me you follow me there is not one banquet there is couple of them anybody because on the first banquet emman is still present are you following me but you need the second banquet where the king comes again and say what do you want queen esther you're following me so peter is saying that there is another grace that is coming about here so there is a grace and there is another grace i hope you caught that let's go back wherefore cut up the laws of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you it's in the future brought to you when at the what of what so this grace that need that will come to you will be brought to you at the revelation of who the revelation of jesus christ my god on sunday brother stephen you say that the new birth is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen verse 8 and verse 9 peter is talking to the people that are already saved they already have a personal revelation of jesus christ but peter said there is another revelation of jesus christ another grace that is coming are we reading the same bible are we reading the same bible what is that revelation hallelujah take revelation 1 1. revelation 1 1. revelation chapter 1 verse 1 if you're there you can say amen you're there yeah brother dale is wired pretty good everybody there let's read with me now the what of what i thought jesus christ was already revealed i thought he was revealed but there is another word of who wait for the grace that will come at the revelation of who when the book of revelation will be unfold do you follow me do you follow me the revelation of what which god gave unto who so even though jesus came and unfolded god there was still a revelation hidden and god gave that revelation to jesus christ after he was resurrected let's go slowly i'm greeting you the bible which god gave unto him to show unto what his servant the things which master surely come to pass and he send it and signify it by what unto his servant who so that revelation will come with a signifying angel you following me and and that angel we already explained to you that he was the seventh engine with the seventh vowel he was the one that unfolded the entire book of revelation until john fell down to worship him then he said don't worship me because i'm one of your fellow servants the word prophet we don't believe in prophet the prophet well until john do you know that jesus was a prophet why do you believe in jesus why do you believe in jesus amen moses said the lord your god shall send a prophet like unto me jesus was the son of man which is a prophet why do you believe jesus if you don't believe the prophet paul said king agrippa do you believe the prophet you see now amen so this revelation will come with a prophetic ministry to unfold that revelation it is another grace we okay now the first grace save your soul by the second grace brother branham preached the message of grace the second grace comes with the revelation of jesus christ everybody there that's why there is a grace here and there is another grace that's why when the capstone is coming down are you following me the capstone is crying water are you there when the capstone come down the capstone is crying what grace grace why didn't the capstone cry grace are you with me the capstone must cry for how many graces because the message of brother branham have the power to take care of your soul and to take care of your body it's a whole package it's a complete revelation of jesus christ rejecting the message is rejecting the grace of god that will save that will kick the black dog out of your flesh amen gp they say remember there is a grace that is coming wait for that grace that will come at the revelation at the opening of the book of revelation there will be another faith another grace but that grace that faith is a faith of rapture to kick the black dog out it is the second banquet that kicked a man out hallelujah it is the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those hills who opened those hills crust he is those seals christ is what this heals and the message is what christ are you there for the whole word of god is what and christ is the seal that was what what is the opening of the seal then revealing what wait until the opening of the seven seal that's what peter was saying that continue to wait until the grace that will come and that grace will open the entire world and in the message of grace that's where the solution for the black dog on your body will be that's why the capstone said grace grace i have restored the holy ghost and i also have the solution for your body the message is the entire bone bomb that you need the message take care not only of the soul but it takes care of the body did that fabricated show me the scripture did you see the scripture at the opening of the seventh hill the bible become a new book are you following me let's go to 1st thessalonians 4. hallelujah parent if your child is working make sure they follow this there is a responsibility that we have we don't want anybody lagging byron no more religious church come to church to get friends are you there first thessalonians chapter four if you dare you can say amen verse one hallelujah furthermore then we beseech you everybody clear in other words we are begging you we beseech you brethren and exalt you by the lord jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please god so you all are born more and what so since you learn how to receive god how to walk and how to please god pleasing god by faith everybody there now here paul is saying that you should abort more and more in other words you should continue to grow more and more letting the white dog push out that black dog out in other words the space is already contained you are the space and there is a fight within you there is a white dog and a black dog a man let the white dog continue to take control the more if you are a hundred percent hallelujah you are a hundred percent can i erase this you are a hundred percent amen 100 amen 100 percent black 100 black here 50 50. the holy ghost comes he takes over 50 amen the black dog is still there as the holy ghost continue to grow amen if the holy ghost gets 60 the black don't get 40 if the holy ghost gets 70 the black dog get petty let the holy ghost squeeze the black dog in you let the black dog become so fin until because when he eat he gets bigger now you need to starve him so he can get feeling and the more thin he gets the more uncomfortable he becomes are you there when you are a young christian when they bring a movie like harry potter you could watch that movie and be a little bit uncomfortable have you noticed that you could get on walmart when there is halloween and you can get and come out the more you consecrate your life you will find out that when you get on walmart just the sight of halloween bothers you in other words you don't tolerate even the things you were tolerating before are you there you become more sensitive to spirit you can look at something just a movie and you say i don't even want to look at that because the appearance is already evil because the holy ghost doesn't tolerate sin anymore how can you sit an hour watching pornography come to the altar come to the altar don't fool yourself don't fool yourself amen don't fool yourself hallelujah let's go oh my god verse 2 for you know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus for this is the word the will of god so paul is going to tell us what is the will of god you are saved i want you to continue to grow more and more and continue to let the white dog get more ground more grand more ground you go spiritually everybody clear until god look and he said he reached the point i want him to reach amen jesus learned obedient by the things that he suffered god never put adoption in jesus when he went to jordan jesus had to preach preach preach after three years he went on the mountain then god put adoption are you there when god looked at you he said now he is where i want him to be amen then your word become deadly amen when you say something you found out it happened amen let's go hallelujah for this verse 3 for this is the word the will of god everybody awake the will of god what is the will of god that you're talking about paul the will of god even your word so sanctification is the will of god [Music] holiness are you there why paul talking to christian he's insisting on sanctification because the black dog is still there you understand hallelujah even your sanctification that you should obtain from water you understand fornication in a clear blank explanation is sometimes the bible used that word back and forth but fornication by pure definition is having sexual relationship before marriage are you following me paulie said don't do that why because by going down out you are actually feeding the black dog are you following me you say i don't commit fornication but your pornography that you watching are you there he's already defiling your mind because jesus said if you look at a woman and you left after hell you are already committed adultery even though you are not there yet but you in the eyes of god you're in adultery i thought he preaches mysteries the mystery of sanctification verse 4. are you there that every one of you should know how to what process what do you know what that vessel means body are you there everybody in this church should know how to control their body why paul do you want us to control our body because the black dog is there are you following you are not fully redeemed yet learn that you know how to possess his vessel in water pure and water not in there lust of conceptions last of passion everybody clear even as the what the hidden which no not work in other words you cannot be a christian and behave like a pagan are you there a christian need to bring his body under subjection you need to control the black dog hallelujah job to verse 7 for god has not called us to what do you see your song brother you see that god has not called us to work but what paul is reminding you that you have a fight in your body that fight that you have with the blood dog will try to pull you back to your old life he will try to pull you back to do the things that you left but remember you are dead to sin you need to control your body because god called you for sanctification and not uncleanness it is not a right to do things that is wrong because i'm sealed i'm gonna go in heaven no matter what we need to check that ceiling amen hebrew chapter 12 verse 14 hallelujah hebrew 12 verse 14 i got it here for you on the board so we can save some time follow up with who and what sanctification without water no man shall see who without that sanctification you won't see god scripture that save the lord everybody clear praise the name of the lord on this stage where you are pulled this way and you are pulled the other way that's where the indian chief is he told brother branham they thought brother branham explained that sisa got born there is what a fight going on we told you that fight need to be handled by who joshua romans 6 22 but now being made what free from sin you're on part two the sin is removed from your soul and become servant to god you have your fruit unto what your life now goes to sanctification and the end everlasting life for the wage of sin is what the salary of sin will kill you but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ hour first corinthians 15 the sting of death is and the strength of death is what the law but thank be to god which gave us the victory through who jesus the lord jesus christ romans 6 knowing this that our old man the first nature remember him is what crucified with who that's why you don't go to the tribulation period are you there because the sixth seal hit jesus at the cross so when you identify with christ automatically your tribulation goes to the cross everybody cares that's why paul said i am crucified by identification just like because of adam you are going to trouble because of christ you also go to righteousness you don't have to be there in the garden of eden you are just undergoing what adam did so the same way if what adam did without you being physically present applied to you what christ did without you being physically present also applied to you [Music] it is a scripture if you need that scripture you give it you ask me the old man is crucified with who that the body of water might be destroyed the destroyer that henceforth we should not serve what in other words since you are redeemed you cannot be again a servant of sin you cannot be again living a sinful life hallelujah who is this melchizedek praise god but look when this body receives the water the spirit of god is somebody sleeping the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you he does what he throw this body into what because the white dog begin to control fight with the black dog you get it hallelujah he that is what on part two follow me he that is born of god do not work because inside of you there is no more sin you trap you trample into it but the desire of sin is no longer in you you don't sit down and say i'm gonna do something wrong no it is the black dog pushing you sometime and you find yourself angry and you say something that you were not supposed to say but down on this side you didn't want to say it because you are born of god you don't commit sin it is not your nature therefore he cannot sin romans 8 1. you see now therefore there is work you've been killing yourself you've been killing yourself it is time to change and just begin to give god more room in your life and he began to take care of your child he began to take care of your husband he began to take care of your business he began to take care of your hand he began to take care of your parents just give him more room there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus they walk not after the walking they're not servant to sin but after the water there you are see that throws your body what you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking hallelujah just do what bring him to god and let god slay him [Applause] are you there that's why when esther was preparing her banquet she cannot have a banquet without airmen she need to bring a man to the banquet and to tell the king this is the one that troubled me you understand your banquet hallelujah just get in christ and it's water in other words give quest the preeminence give the white dog preeminence read your bible pray listen to the message go to church when the door are open if you miss catch up you will find out some of the weakness you have are gone and you don't even know when they are gone and it will happen that god will send a test to you are you there and somebody curse your mother and you're gonna turn around and say you know what i forgive you then you're gonna realize that that anger that could not let nobody talk against my mama is already killed we're trying to do our own work so we can boast we try to do our own work you don't have power to overcome this is the victory that overcome the world which is your faith that faith that brings the white dog it is that faith that is overcoming are you there so just getting crushed and it's all gone see because your body is what subject to the spirit it is no more subject to the things of the world they are what they are dead your sins are what inner soul in baptism and you are a new what creation in class and your body become what to the white dog try to leave a right kind of water it is the white dog pressing amen he's the one that make you uncomfortable in certain places go to colossians 3. we don't fight like paul say we don't fight like we're beating the air amen that's a pentecost of fighting anybody clear do you remember that scripture on sunday paul said that we don't fight like we are beating the air in other words you just go there in jesus name in jesus name in jesus name he's gone he's gone tomorrow you fall again am i really safe or not in the name of jesus move move you begin to move even somebody you see the pentecostal right move move move until they go with somebody like this and then he fall down then the person runs up he say now i got it go home fell again until the christian life become frustration you are confused yeah i do everything they say to do but it seems like yeah i try i try i try i want to quit you want to quit because you were trying the wrong way colossians chapter 3. you were trying the wrong way you don't have to half and pass listen to brother brahman in the table god bless you sister how are you doing that's your name you from so and so go the lord heal you amen you go to the pentecostal here he says it raise it and they go down with you you come out nothing tomorrow you're still struggling with that demon and because you took so long in the church the people believe because you're in church for so long you are christian now you are afraid to open up to somebody and to tell him your weakness because they will look at you like all this time that he beat in the message he's still struggling this you don't want to talk to the pastor you don't want to talk to the deacon you don't want to talk to your brother you don't want to commit your sister you don't want to call a sister and say sister bridget i'm going through this this this because you're afraid sister bridger that came in the message after me if she knows that i'm struggling like this he's going to see me here you were going the wrong way i don't know who got that but whoever he killed it's shooting the devil colossian three verse one if you beat then what reason with christ die the reason with christ you are number two anybody clear seek what do you see paul why do you seek those things which are above because the kingdom that you are now is not the kingdom of the world amen in other words focus to the things that are above because your focus to the things that are above will automatically feed the white dog because joshua need the sword and the sword of the spirit is the word of god focus on the things of god automatically the holy ghost begin to grow into you because what brahman said when the holy ghost get in your life it gets like a button so that batter need to grow but you don't go to church how do you expect to grow all you worry about is job job job there are people for two years three years never been on on wednesday in church now that we have streaming it's even worse and coronavirus is there even worse amen worst five years never been on wednesday in church they are fine they come on wednesday on sunday that say if they miss sunday or snow comes two more weeks they get sick three more weeks when you are home have you followed the sermon no they're busy and those bills keep moving moving and the bills never stop even if you pay your house off you're going to pay the property taxes you don't pay the water bill off it won't continue until the rapture you won't pay yourself on offer that cell phone will continue you won't pay the insurance card off you will continue to pay you continue the renew you continue the renew you continue the renew you continue until the rapture those bills will never finish but you're going to find in hell with no business amen i have a car i need to work you're going to find yourself with that car driving in hell let's go why christ sits sick those things which are far above yeah i have to stop somewhere wednesday seek those things which are above where who sits on the right hand of god in the power of god watch verse 2 set your water set your affection on what on things of above not on things off the water do what you gotta do build your house go to school go to a job pay your car pay whatever you want to do but make sure your love is not set on those things because brother branham said that in the next civilization we will not use this kingdom you will be traveling like a thought why do you let your car keep you out of the next civilization why why they make a 2014 tomorrow is 2020. you look at 2014 it's now it doesn't look as pretty as he was before and this is the car that kept you at the church that you work for check your life this is not a continuation of where we came from i keep telling you verse 3 for you are what paul reminds you here you want to are you there you are dead to sin i want to remind you focus on the above feed the white dog because you already dead to sin three for you are dead and your life is what hidden with who in who you are secure for your salvation by the death of your first nature automatically you are hidden with christ amen verse 4 one cross who is our life shall what appear here you see appear the rapture you understand paul starts with you then he goes to the rapture peter starts and he goes to the rapture all of them are pushing for the rapture all of them are crying for the same thing amen and even creation is groaning for are you there verse 5 do what do you know what it does it means put to death let me start for when christ who is our life shall appear then you shall also appear with him in water how are you going to appear with christ christ have a glorified body who's going to give you a glorified body you see now verse 5 mortified put to death therefore your water which are upon there paul is saying again mortify put to death your body because your body is still on the earth and your body came from the earth when you die we put you into the grave because your body is part of this ground it is subject to the gravitational force it is subject to this world put that body to death why the black dog are you there multiply therefore your your member which are upon the earth modify what can you read with me fornication sexual relationship before marriage i'm saying plainly i'm not gonna hide no no no it's a mix i'm gonna tell you straight in the country when a man stands and giving a post and he's calling a another man and saying my husband come publicly and you want me to watch my word why don't you tell those people to watch what they do they take a woman they put another woman and they kiss and they put it on television it's not a problem and you want me to watch my work like you don't know what i'm talking about modify therefore your members which are upon the earth modify what fornication sexual relationship before marriage uncleanness everybody there if you wake up please if you sleep and wake up inordinate what inordinate means affection that are not in order the order the proper order of god is for a man and a woman to meet together that is the proper order of god you want to see that on the scripture do you want to see that on the scripture yes or no you want to see it keep your finger right here let's go to genesis go to genesis chapter 19 are you there we're going to go back to colossians keep genesis chapter 19. are you there genesis chapter 19 verse 30. you there they destroy sodom and gomorrah lord came out verse 30 and lot went out of zora and dwell in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feel to dwell in zore and he dwell in a cave he and his two water daughters verse 31 and the firstborn said to the younger our father is old and there is not a what those women came from a city of homosexual but when they grew up they were not longing for women they were longing for a man you follow me continue our father is old and there is not a word a man in the earth to come into after the manner of what all the what so universally speaking the normal way of meeting is a man with a woman by the bible this is the order of god because when god created adam he created him male and female which is the image of god because god is male and female are you there the affection should be between male and female let's go back to collusion the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new book let's go to verse five inordinate what in other words unnatural affection even in the beast male female in the ark of noah male female bring the animal male female male female always correct order when it's inordinate it's when men begin to met with men or women with women paul is saying get that out of the church inordinate affection if or what concupisces passions and covetousness which is what idolatry let's drop down for which things seek because of these things the what came unto the children of water the graph of god will come on you because of fornication the wrath of god will come on you for having sexual relationship before marriage the wife of god will come from you for uncleanness for inordinate affection for all these things that's why the wrath of god came in genesis 6 the wrath of god came upon the sons of god because the sons of god begin to look at the worldly women god say i'm not going to put up with that that is what paul is saying in colossae let me zero in to the report in this and we will catch up again brother branham he formulated a plane wherein god will be forced to deal with israel in death this is available just as satan knew that he could begin leave cause her to do what to fall in water the black dog you follow because here i told you there are you you come from birth from puberty there is a trouble here in puberty that comes here because you are turned on and the black dog because it's passion which is an avenue of your spirit the black dog claims that and begin to trouble you that's when you are curious young people that's why you want to read stuff you want to get on the internet it is the black dog troubling you that's why you sleep you begin to see unclean stuff in your dreams are you there puberty we're trying to guard you so that you can get in marriage when you begin to god displace menopause come it's another trouble let me leave that let's go here god has heard to fall in fleshly sin that's causing god to pass his pronounced sentence of death against him in other words make them sin so that god can whip them that's the case here so bellam knew that if he could get israel to sin god would have to deal with them in water you see what the devil does so he planned a way to get them to come over and join in what sends out the invitation dinah begin to leave the camper and begin to talk to other sister not sister to other girls on facebook facebook make friend make friends make friends make friends make friends make friends make friends you don't see that you going out of the camp send out invitation to come to the feast of bapeo come over and worship with us now israel no doubt has seen the feast of the egyptian worldly thing you were there before remember israel came out of egypt but the black dog was still there and the black dog was trying to pull them back to egypt amen now brother pronoun is saying that a religious people came and brought a feast but that feast looks like the feast that you were in the world they bring you a music and people are dancing and you look at the clip of the christian music you cannot even dance in front of your father women moving their hips and guess what you dancing and your father record you and put it on whatsapp that's why brother branham said it is parent delinquency now israel no doubt has seen the feast of the egyptian okay i'm gonna drop it if you in this church and they want to take you for a flower girl or a flower boy you watch what you're gonna do okay if they send me a movie and you dare on a party playing all kind of music because they took you as a flower girl or a flower girl or a what groom or whatever you call them i will have to deal with you i'm just warning you so the egyptian there did not feel it was too strong to go and just look on and perhaps eat with the people what is wrong with fellowship anyway we are supposed to love them brother stephen aren't we and how can we win them israel thought he's going to win the more about he didn't know that the more about put a trap to force god to whip them being friendly never hurt anyone donna got raped by being friendly and so they thought but one does what sexy more british women begin to do what and undress what they were whirling around moving their hips doing their hawk and roll and twist the water they begin to do things that feed the black dog in israel you see now the black dog the last rose up in the israelite and they were drawn into what by just one sin israel forget about the israeli women they went for the more british woman and what did god do and god in wrath through what 42 000 of them never forgive them i'm going to stop here bellamy had come down and taught the people his doctrine and they say now look we are all believers we are all christian we are not the same brother branham said there is a difference between the bride and the church he's just a christian he prayed the baptist he prayed over there if in the message we got in trouble how much more over there now look we are all believers we are lost children daughters children moab up there and say we are all the what we are not the same and he mixed them up cause what intermarriage marriage with the people that are not of your faith that don't believe like you the day they get in marriage and you begin to have children if that person shows his color you won't do anything they will put you on the custody and you're going to pay child support oh god okay okay he calls them pretty women praying more about women the sons of god fell for water all doored up and come down here and told the son of god that they were they were all the same after all god is god of all races and everything is all right he married them together and god and god drawed the separation line and made them leave their home and everything what was it see that thing just exactly what took place back there before the genesis 6. when the sons of god saw the daughters of men they were fair to look upon and they did what lasted for them and took them on to what internet did you notice he never said nothing about marriage because god said he was wickedness the sons of god came unto the daughters of men nothing about marriage if you take in the original greek there the word meaning says i've got it wrote down here somewhere a wife taken them wives in third verse taking them wife in the greek i looked it up this afternoon he didn't say take to them wife he said took to them what not wives take unto them what not wife they took them just as they were free what boyfriend girlfriend like we have today in other words they were lovers in that day just as they are now they went in any way they want to and they took any woman that they could who was doing that the young people in the church women of that day in the days of noah must have been the talk of the day the sons of god set sets on the correct lineage saw the daughter of who that they were what why they were wicked and they were daughters of cain when the sons of god saw the daughters of men they were fair they took unto them what then the sons of god fell from the what you lost your position and became what women chasers the sons of god fell because of what beautiful what form and what that's what they put to you that's why the women wear tight dresses to reveal the coca-cola border shape are you there of the daughters of men are you there let no man want his what the bible didn't say tested when they test it god that tests you but they are talking about tempted and we're going to close you i am tempted of what for god cannot be tempted with what that's why jesus said to satan you shall not tempt the lord your god are you there because god cannot be tempted with evil need attempted he any man he just put you to test but god don't tempt you to do something about every man is what when he is drawn away of his own it is your own weakness that is troubling you what troubles you is your own weakness don't blame it on someone else it is your own fault it is your own weaknesses you know that you don't have self-control wait when i'm gonna get to first corinthians chapter seven if the lord allows me you're gonna see and entice then when lust is what we are still in the mind brother when lust is conceived it brings forth what now it bring birth to sin and when sin is what when you consume youth you consume it in a hotel it brings forth what do not air my beloved brethren you playing games too much the black dog is not somebody that you play games with you don't play game and run away you don't play game and run away the bible says when you cast the devil that therefore goes out and when he comes back he's gonna bring seven more and the state that you wear that you're gonna get into it is gonna be worse than before and that's what drives people insane which door did you open which dog are you entertaining what are you doing on your cell phone what are you doing on your internet what are you doing who are you talking to are they message believer are they message believer are there people outside who is that girl you talking to who is that boy you talking to who's that co-worker that gets closer to you until you begin to get uncomfortable because you open so much uh joke with her until she can talk to you and say you know are you there who is that person who is that person it's the black dog that's why don't drive a car together because i don't trust the black dog you're gonna find yourself kissing a woman you didn't understand pastor i didn't know how i did it i would tell you it's the black dog you didn't look at your own weakness you lasted yourself you went opening doors knowing that you need coverage and you didn't do it and once sin is conceived it's going to get you to death and you're going to run away from church you're going to run away from people you're going to run away from your husband you're going to run away from your wife and you're going to go to that plan to be girlfriend that you left that if something don't work in a marriage i'm gonna go out how can you married and you talk to a woman two hours on a telephone how can you be married and you talk to a man two hours on a telephone young people you are not coding why are you talking two hours with a man on the telephone no he's just the brother we just we just talk amen if you are coding you're trying to know one another what are you talking about are you talking about sex you are feeding the wrong dog there is a time where if you decide that you're going to get married the permissive will of god will open the door and i will explain you that in first corinthians 7 i need to teach that the progressive will of god will open it let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you're doing father we started this banquet i myself didn't know what was hidden in but lord you are pulling the church into a state of complete redemption because the time is a hand we cater too much with heaven we play too much with him we give him too much space in our life until when we begin to move in this channel he is completely uncomfortable father it is just an expression of mercy because you're trying to deliver your people this is not to kill someone it is a mercy disguise in a sermon strong as this just to help us realize the state that we are in to examine ourselves whether we are in the faith to examine our life to examine where we lay down the bars where we open the doors where we are what have we done are we really grounded in the faithful or are we where we're just presuming do we really have that birth where the inner man is completely changed and translated to a new kingdom or are we still under the desire of sin because your word stated that the worshipper was purged have no more desire or conscience for sin what is the desire in our life what is the desire of our heart where is our motives and our objective father if there is somebody here that is struggling that have not met you that have been in the message under the umbrella of religion under the umbrella of being born in a message under the umbrella of having friend in the message may lord father they put down their religion down may they realize that they need them living god because that soul has been thirsted for a living god a god that can slay the old nature because you say the soul that sinner that soul will die we want the death of that also that all men must be crucified with christ father this is not the hour to play where time is already closing lord you are long suffering opening the door to tell your people that it's time to move from the first banquet onto the second banquet where that airmen will be killed but how can you get in the second banquet if you're not even in the first banquet how can you expect the rapture if you don't even have the redemption of the inner man and you that are already have their redemption but fall back because of your job because of entertainment because of politics because of this whatsapp crazy stuff that is going on with social media until we don't deserve what is good for our children what is good for our husband what is good for our wife but we open any kind of doors continuing to feed the black dog and we wonder why are we struggling why are we in the situation we are father may you be merciful to bring this church under desperation to bring your people to realize if they need to consecrate they need to consecrate more if they need to fast to seek you they need to do it if they need to correct their life they need to go repent correct their life stop our foolishness close doors account because you say that if your eye is a trouble to you it is better to go with one eye into heaven than have both eyes and find yourself in hell father i preach and i deliver the message as you gave it to me lord i'm committing this church unto the hand may the grace of god digress that give faith because it's a gift be given and granted to these young people be granted to your children so that father they can be born again and don't have to fight anybody but lord you take over from there and begin to grow in their life father be merciful to them as i'm pleading i'm asking as a shepherd lord father for those that you gave me responsibility that you be merciful father may you open it all where they can get that faith because it's not something that we manufacture it's a gift of god may you give them that faith that give us the victory that faith that will overcome that faith that will bring our bodies subject that faith that will control and stop the black dog father we commit the oncoming service onto the hand with brother blue lord take everything under control we committed and lord father asking that you give travel mercy to your children continue to consecrate them if i want to offer a little bit father you know it's not that we want to go over but the hour is late that we have to lay this thing because you say that you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free father we committed and asked in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen whatever you can take over god bless you church we fall off i enjoyed that this evening just make make a quick comment here um a lot of times parents that that come out of the world and come into the message and then they raise their kids in the message sometimes they don't have an understanding of the struggles that that kid is struggling with because you know you're raising them up in the right way but that that young person that you have i'm not a parent yet so hear me out but i was a young person that my parents came out of the world into the message and they raised me in the message and they just couldn't see the struggles they think it's an easy road sometimes it's not an easy road it's never an easy road so it's hard for the parents to understand so young people i'll encourage you you can't you can't think you're safe or secure just because your parents raised you in the message you got to find god for yourself and i i have a lengthy testimony i won't give it this evening but maybe if god permits some time i will to the young people about my journey how god made me find myself because i was living under my parents experience for a while and then satan took my dad out my mom was there and i was living under my mom's experience but god had to get me to a place where i found him for myself you have to have a personal relationship a personal walk with the lord for yourself this is directly directly to the young people but just make sure you have that personal relationship with god or else these things that creep in from the world they're gonna they're gonna make you stumble they're gonna make you fall they're gonna you're gonna look at the world and wonder what it's like because you never got to experience it but let me tell you you're not missing nothing you are not missing nothing it's uh there's nothing out there that's worth your time or anything and your parents can tell you that but yet they still don't know what it's like to be born and raised in the message and have that struggle of finding yourself so i just encourage you stay away from those things stay in the word as brother shane goes preaching all all this evening feed the correct dog feed that white dog you know stay away from worldly things and the more you desire put the phone away put the put the movie away whatever it may be and pull out your bible play the message and i'm speaking to myself i need to do more of that we all do i believe but just feed the correct dog sorry for keeping you longer [Music] o grace god's grace grace that will pardon and within [Music] [Music] grace [Music] grace that is greater
