both visible and invisible audience if there is any family member here we do not have visitors God richly bless you I'm going to go quickly on my announcement I believe that everybody's up to dat with the sermon everybody's reading the Bible two chapters a day a message believer true message believer is a Bible believer the message brought us back to the Bible if your message take you out of the

clearance on everybody if February the 10th is wor working and we will meet there and continue with what we started let's go straight to our scripture this morning believe we talking to Supernatural genetics bride of Jesus Christ amen glory to God good to see everybody that was there in the baby shower supporting one another God richly bless you no few folks under the weather May the Holy Spirit heal you is a bag that has been going around troubling people left and right but through it all we are here listening to the good song of Zion beautiful singing God richly bless you brother poly family sister sister Lily brother Michael and everybody that was singing together amen God richly bless you we can do it without you Genesis chapter 21 if you dare you can say amen yeah this is a scripture that slipped me off completely and uh sister Angela sent me the scripture I don't see her this morning she sent me that she's in the back okay okay Wherever You Are amen she sent me the scripture and I was like my God how did I miss this and she was like brother Stephen look at this and this and this and this I say you don't know what you're doing actually the holy spirit is using you to remind me of something that I forgot amen and I really like it because I can see the working of the spirit through the church how it's working left and right that's wonderful we not in nicolan Era where the spirit work with the the preachers and not the congregation that's wrong that's right the spirit in this church work with everybody amen Genesis 21 verse uh 12 you there you can say amen and the Bible says you know the background about this and God said to Abraham let it not be Grievous in your sight because of the Lord you know the story Sarah told Abraham kick ishma out amen and because of your bond woman and all that Sarah has said to you hearken to her voice amen amen for in Isaac shall your seed be C in other word the promise is not connected to Ishmael amen everything will come through Isaac so take is take him off from the home amen and also of the son of the Bor woman will I make a nation because he is your what SE you might be seated so we found out that Ishmael is not the son of the promise according to the scripture are we together but he's still the Seed of Abraham according to the promise of God if you look at the economy of God Ishmael is not there but Ishmael carries the Blood of Abraham so if you go get the DNA of ishma you check the DNA you find out that he came from Abraham but in the God's DNA according to the promise it's Isaac but it's not actually connected to Ishmael at all so the child have to leave and to be kicked out completely but look at this this is where I'm getting you verse 14 and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he took what bread we okay now he took bread because he doesn't want somebody to get hungry right right for Hunger but Rober can I get a new one please he took bread amen you know there is two essential things for living right it is bread and water water so Abraham must water right let's see the scripture the Bible says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took what bread and a bottle of what water a true father bread and for thirst Abraham take H2O water a bottle of water and give it to hegar putting it on her shoulder there could be messages laying here but let me stay focused cuz if you trying to peel off this thing and we going Sid track amen and gave it to Hagar put it on her shoulder and the child and sent her way and she departed and wandered where in the wilderness why all these things happen only in the wilderness thank you amen she got water and she wander where in the wilderness in the wilderness in the desert so they both are covered because there is no food there is no water in the wilderness so they're covered amen let's see what happened in that Wilderness the Wilderness of Barba verse 15 and the water was spent in the bottle in other word the water is finished yeah amen amen and she cast the child under one of the shrub so something begin to happen to the child there is no more water brother Bram say that the tongue of Ishmael began to swell I have the quat if you want me I can give it to you no water the child begin to cry but remember this is not the child of a promise this is not a child of the promise God say do what Sarah did kick the child out but nevertheless in that child there is a Blood of Abraham we okay now the mother look at the baby the baby the child is crying the child is crying the child is about to die the mother say you know what I'm going to take him and find a little shra there and went and put the child there and live the child there to die because his tongue was already swelling brother Bram say something begin to happen with uh his lips and things because of thirst amen verse 16 and she went and sat her down opposite him a good way of as he were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of what the child because Ismael was dying was dying because of thirst lack of water and mother say I'm not going to sit to watch my baby die ding let me drop him somewhere and run far away so when he dies there I do not keep the memory of this thing amen and uh verse 16 and she sat opposite him and lifted up her voice and did what we so Hagar was weeping Hagar was weeping when you look at this scripture like this you need a prophet amen actually she was crying she was not just weeping like that actually brother Bram say she was speaking certain things Hagar amen the bond Woman verse uh 17 and God heard the voice of Hagar no we okay now yes God heard the voice not the voice of Hagar God was not listening to the prayer of Hagar amen amen God heard the voice of who is is so the crying of Ishmael of thirst affected God Amen The Thirst of Ishmael pull God down yes amen amen not the thirst of hear Ishmael why only Ishmael and not Hagar God didn't say I'm looking at your weeping uh I'm hearing the lad over there so when that boy was crying over there something was in that boy that was reaching out heaven and God answered not Hagar brother Bram say before God mind Hagar he need to First respond to Ishmael we clear verse 17 and God heard the voice of the lad the voice of Ishmael amen when I say Ishmael we need to understand really who Ishmael is who is this God this child that God is attending to okay let's go slowly this way just keep your Bible right there let's go to Genesis 16 so we really get the picture Genesis 16 if you dare you can say amen amen let's see who is ishel verse 17 if you dare you can say Amen Hagar was pregnant with ishma and uh 16 let me see Genesis 16 verse 7 I'm sorry not 17 verse 7 m Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael she run away because Sarah was mistreating her and the Bible says in verse 7 and the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the what Wilderness this is Hagar by the way by the fountain in the way to Shore and he said the angel of the Lord hegar Sarah has made your position where you can where where came you and where will you go in other word where you going and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarah and the angel of the Lord said to her return to your mistress and do what submit thyself submit in other word obey submit yourself under her hand and the angel of the Lord say to her I will multiply your seed this is Ishmael exceedingly that he shall not be numbered for multitude we clear amen and the angel of the Lord said to her behold you are with with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name what Ismael because the Lord has heard your Affliction but verse 12 he will be a what a wild man he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him it's a troublemaker exactly right so that's why when he goes through trouble his system work fine his system always work with trouble wow I hope you're reading between the line and he shall dwell in the presence of all his what Brethren so let's go back now to our scripture on Genesis 21 so we talking about a wild man a wild child who's not connected to the promise but when he's thirsting because he had the Blood of Abraham right God came down exct right thirst bringing God down God didn't come down until Ishmael begin to thirst and cry out for thirst amen amen amen jum to verse uh 17 and God heard the voice of the Lord and the angel of God this is God himself yes called to Hagar out of heaven and say to her what H you Hagar fear not for God has heard the voice of the L not the voice of Hagar where he is Aras lift up the Lord and hold him in your your hand for I will make him a what a great nation and God opened her eyes and she s a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the Lord to drink brother Bram says that Hagar searched through this place and she didn't see any water in other word there was no water in that spot thank you my brother and brother Bram say what happened to this well God actually sprung the well up that's right in other word God created this [Applause] well in the wilderness in the desert in the tight place where there is no water a child that is not connected to the problem am when he cry his thirst bring the creative power of God to bring a well that did not exist there everybody okay everybody okay amen the brother Bram say this in Jehovah J but remember the Bible says that the Lord heard the child sir why he is a seed of what let's pray then we clim Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy for your healing and being able to be able to stand before the purchase of the blood Lord father despite everything the devil was fighting Lord father open the windows of Heaven please and bless us this morning Lord may you remove every demonic spirit and every spirit of destruction may all all of us be Lord father Center to your word as Lord we expecting great blessing from thee be the Alpha and the Omega father in Jesus precious name Amen brother brandham say but remember the Bible says that the Lord heard the child why he is a Seed of Abraham God hears the Cry of the children of Abraham that's and if you are in Christ tonight yes sir this morning you are Abraham's seed he never heard [Applause] Hagar let me do this so we can read it together he never heard Hagar the woman the mother she is very religious but he never heard her the Covenant was not with that that's right it was with Abraham what see oh if I could get that drill into you God is [Applause] how God doesn't have a choice God must amen God is under obligation God is Du the bound amen God is obligated he s by himself and made the Covenant how unconditionally between who Abraham and his seed forever you are what Abraham SE if you are where Christ and if you are dead in Christ you are what Abraham SE and I hair according to the what promise and the same promise that he made Abraham is how yours oh that ought to make everybody get how well to think that if you are Abra you are the seed of who Abraham so being in Christ we we are automatically Abraham's seed amen and we are more Abraham's seed than Ishmael because Ishmael is fighting Abraham's seed but we are praying for the Peace of Jerusalem we are not against the Jews we are for the Jews so if God can heal the enemy of the Jews and create a well for them when they are in trouble how much more the Royal Seed of Abraham [Applause] you need to know who you are the thir of the enemy of the Jews because of a natural blood brought the creative power of Jehovah how much more the Royal Blood of Jesus Christ amen The Thirst of Ishmael brought him a blessing are we together amen are we together let's go to Matthew 12 we read this last timeall so what happened to be a tragedy what happened to be like something bad that was happening to Israel was what was actually the key to bring the angel of the Lord down am so thirst in Ishmael amen brought God down amen and when God broke came down God created third four amen amen came by thirst remember we started thirst and hunger last week Matthew 12 just a refresh if you dare you can say Amen at that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day you understand this now yes through the corn you understand the laws now and his disciple were how The Hunger of the disciple on the Sabbath day the hunger of the disciple the followers of Jesus Christ amen and began to plug the ears of corn according to the law and to eat but when the Pharisees saw it they said to him behold your disciple do that which is not lawful to do upon the Water Sab day in other word they can go get the food but not on the Sabbath day but hunger doesn't look whether it's the Sabbath day or not the Sabbath day when you're hungry on the Sabbath day you hungry amen amen but he says to them have you not read what David did in other word what David did if Jesus is pulling this like this it means David did not sin that's right that's why brother Bram said Jonah was not outside of the will of God because Jesus would not have refer back to him and say the miracle of Jonah Amen in other words David what did was inspired because Jesus is using that to defend himself in other word if David never have done that the Pharisee would have cornered Jesus Christ and found him with a fault amen have you not heard what David did when he was hungry and they that were with him had he enter into the house of who God Y and did eat the what the showbread which was not lawful for him to do what eat this is Christ himself the hunger of David give him a right to eat something that doesn't belong to him amen no one has tasted that bread beside delived the first one from an another tribe that touched that bread is David and nothing happened to him and God doesn't kill him amen the hunger of David open him to the showbread without the hunger no showbread without the hunger not the sword of Goliath back amen hunger to David amen guide him the showbread and the sword amen it happened by hunger remember last week thirst and hunger are painful that's right painful what desire painful desire open up stuff amen that is not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him so not only David he opened the door for somebody else but only for the what hunger open this door not only to David but even to those that were following David and Jesus Christ entering the field because he's the master the lord of the Sabbath his disciple also become Lords of the Sabbath amen they can transgress the Sabbath and nothing happen amen what gave them their power it's hunger we clear let's go to Luke 15 and then we CL Luke 15 very familiar scripture if you dare you can say amen amen Luke 15 verse 11 so we're going to pick up where we stop and see if we you can wind this up amen amen Luke 15:1 the Bible says a certain man has two son you know this there is a lot of type in this story there is Jews and 144 Ty all of them he didn't hear amen and the younger of them say to his father father give me the portion of good that THS to me and he divided them he's living and not many days after the young son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with righteous living amen and when he had spent all there arose a what a mighty famine not just a famine but it was a severe one a mighty famine in that land and he begin to be in water water so famine brought want famine brought want this want is called need amen the need that was generated from the famine and he begin to be in want and he went to join himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his field to do what feed swine and he would Fain in other word he would Glide L have filled his belly with the HK that the son that the swan did eat and no man gave to him and when he came to himself he didn't come to himself just like that no because all this time he was not coming back to himself when the famine started he didn't come to himself amen when he got the job he didn't come to himself when he was feeding the swan he didn't come to himself something happened to him that trigger a revelation we clear and when when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have what bread enough enough to spare and I perish with what hunger so what brought him that Revelation hunger fine brought need it brought hunger amen and hunger brought a revelation in other word hunger brought the mind of this boy back because the Bible say he came to himself so he was not himself the mind that he had first was lost so what brought him back to the man what Resto back theand is hunger and when he came back to himself he begin to think about his fathers and the potential that his father have he never thought about that when everything else was going on so hunger is a blessing to this boy just like hunger was a blessing to David just like thirst was a blessing to Ishmael amen that's right amen but we look at hunger in a different perspective amen the Bible says on verse uh uh 18 I will arise and go to my father so this hunger is bringing him back to the father because he he he cut off the relationship and he left his father he was separated from his father but this hunger is bringing him to a revelation that is restoring him back back to his father remember it took the famine to restore is uh I mean uh Egypt back to Pharaoh that's right you got it and I will arise and go back to my father and I will say to him who's teaching him this did you see a preacher here no did you see a prophet here no did you see the angel of the Lord here no who is teaching him this hunger what kind of hunger teaches you amen it says I will say to him father I have sinned against what and before thee this hunger is teaching him repentance wow Jesus verse 19 and I am no more worthy to be called your son make me as one of your highed water servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said to him father he's repeating the Revelation he got through hunger he's repeating the Revelation he got through hunger he said father amen I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and I am no more worthy to call to be called your son but the father said to his servant bring forth the what the best road all these things were connected to the re revelation of The Hunger the best robe was already there right all this time the best robe was there he was never given that best robe until he hunger amen amen amen hunger produces repentance hunger produces not just a robe the best one amen amen amen bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a what a ring on his hand the first day when he was leaving did they give him a ring no no ring brother brand I'm explain all of this symbols unmerited Grace and wedding brand and all this kind of stuff amen he say and put a ring on his hand and chew on his water feet and bring here the water the fatted Cal not just any Cal make sure the big one the large one amen amen amen bring here the FED C and kill it and let us eat and be how Mar for this my son was how dead Hallelujah and he's what alive again what brought him back [Applause] alive So Hunger did what resurrected him amen amen let's go again and he was back again and uh he was dead and he's alive again he was how lost and he's what found who found him how did the angel of the Lord find ishel amen you already got a message right there and he was found verse uh 24 for this my son was dead and he's alive again he was lost and his F and they began to be how married if you continue the story this situation unfolded even the weakness of the older boy because he had the problem when another one repented but let's leave that one all I want you to show to see his hunger brought a revelation to this boy brought his mind back amen amen and when his mind was back all these doors begin to open up why because of hunger quick one Luke verse 4 I'm just going to read this quickly Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit where Into the Wilderness again the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those day he did itat what nothing and when they were and when they were ended he after all did what hungry and the devil said to him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that he be made to what pray this power was available only after Jesus hungered we clear last one in Mark 11 the Bible say and on the mor when they were come to Bethany he was how hungry so the third pull the power of the spoken word Came Upon Jesus Christ when he was hungry amen The Thirst of Ishmael brought the creative power The Thirst the hunger of David gave him access to the showbread and to the sword the feminine this boy did all this kind of stuff and even Jesus Christ himself only when he hungered that's when things happened what is is going on what are we talking about today my subject this morning is teach us to pray blessing through thirst and hunger amen when you begin to thirst about something am when you begin to really hunger amen am amen amen it is not a curse amen there is something that is coming up amen am am every body okay remember man is natural and man is also spiritual and we found out that man naturally hunger and thirst using the brain you remember that the hypot from last Sunday but spiritually speaking man when he hunger and thirst he does it by the soul amen that's what brother brandham say brother Bram say there is a thirst on the nature and there is a thirst on the the soul because man shall not live by bread alone but by every what word the word of God doesn't go to your belly amen the word of God doesn't go to your stomach the word of God goes into your soul amen it is the inside men that get fed by the word of God Amen everybody okay amen and we find out that we are still in the Lord's Prayer where the Bible says give us this day our daily bread or give us day by day our daily bread before you ask for bread you must be in need oh you must be in want amen you don't ask if you have it you ask because you don't have it amen so when we are going to the father and say give us this day our daily bread we don't want to fall in other words it is hunger that is pushing us back to the father amen everybody clear so far according to the Book of James verse one chapter 1 verse 17 the Bible says that every good gift and every perfect gift is from who above and cometh down from the who father of light the father of light he's the father of light he's a father of light if he is a father that generate light he himself must be a light amen amen the Bible says in 1 John 1:5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is what light that's why he's the father of light and the in the Book of Revelation 21 the Bible says the city has no need of the son neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the L L is the what so the lamb is the light God is light and he is the father of light amen he's the father of your theophany amen because he himself is a theophany he is the Loos he is the pillar of fire am that's why on the day of Pentecost when the disciple wanted to get the new birth the pillar of fire separated himself into 120 light he was the father of light he was the one giving birth to new lights everybody clear but my point I want you to keep here is every good gift every perfect gift come from who from God we clear amen now we went through this in Matthew 7: 7 the bible say ask uhhuh and it shall be what given you before you ask you must be in need amen amen are we together amen seek and you shall find what do you seek if you already found something so when you seeking it means you don't have it amen are we together yes sir knock and it shall be open to you why do you knock because you are looking for something amen everybody okay amen for everyone that do what ask it he does what receive it so your asking is only an expression of the need that you have amen you already have a need that's the reason why you ask are we together you are after something that's the reason why you seeking you want something that's the reason why you knocking everybody okay everyone that ask receiveth and he that seeketh do what find it and to him that knth it shall be how open and Jesus say or what man is there of you whom if his son ask for what pray he will give him what a stone continue my brother or if he ask a fish he will give him what a serpent continue again if ye then being evil know how to give what good gifts not know how to give bread and fish at the beginning it was bread then Jesus flipped it to fish now it's no longer bread and fish is what good gifts amen good what gifts because every perfect gift amen and good gift come from who God Amen every and how to give good gift unto your children how much more your what Your Father which is where in heaven give you what good things no more good thing good gift by what good things Hallelujah so in God we can get bread Amen in our God we can get fish Amen in our God we can can get good gifts amen meaning you don't work for it amen and you can get also good things amen amen not bad things good things Amen Let me push it this way not refurbish one Hallelujah if you want to limit your faith to that that's up to you I just stretch a little bit okay just a little bit okay glory to God he says good things to them that do what ask so when you ask God he will give you good things amen amen glory to God Luke 11 verse 11 the Bible say if a son shall ask what it's already there of any of you that is a father will he give him a what stone continue my friend oh if he ask a fish uh-huh will he for a fish give him a serpent it's already there or if he ask what an egg continue my friend will he offer him a scorpion and if ye then being how evil know how to give what good gifts it's already there unto your children how much more shall your what Heavenly Father give what the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is a gift amen repent and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit so now we begin to understand that our bread comes from our father amen our fish come from our father amen our good gift come from our father am our good things come from our father in other word if I receive something that is not good I need to ask God Amen that's right amen amen don't worry my friend our head come from God and our Holy Spirit Come From God in other word our natural [Music] things and our spiritual things amen both of them come from God Amen we clear so far am according to the tonomy 8 the Bible say thou shall remember all the way which the Lord th God LED thee 40 years in the wilderness to do what humble thee and to do what prove thee to know what was in that heart whether that was uh thatou would keep his commandment or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to do what hunger and fed thee with what man which th knowest not you understand this neither did that father know that he might make thee make thee know that man do not leave by what bread only come on but by what every word the reason why God caused Israel to hunger and create man was to tell Israel that do not look at the natural things alone amen look at the word amen if you get the word the word will create bread amen because when Jesus was in the world they brought him two fishes and bread and Jesus never went into the kitchen no sir have you ever thought that he was right there he never went to the chef store he stopped right there he took bread the way he was and Jesus reproduce again bread the same bread that he gave it to him and he even take a seasoned fish and produce another fish that is seasoned and that is [Applause] cooked in other word whether you need something that is r or cook the word can produce it am the word of God can produce a squirrel and you can go cook it yes but the word of God can also produce a cook squirrel that you don't have to do anything with it the word produce WI amen yes everybody okay amen so all these things can be produced by the word of God yes sir amen that's what God wanted to do amen where are we heading with this my friend B uh uh uh the Bible says in the Book of Matthew blessed are they which do what hunger and do what thirst after what righteousness for they shall be what now follow me carefully put your seat belt amen blessed are they that do what hunger and what thirst after what righteousness which is Christ for they shall be what filed in other word your hunger and your thirst pull what you need amen hallelujah amen let's go slowly hunger and thirst for what right for Christ amen if you hunger and you thirst Christ will come to you amen amen amen blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after what righteous in other word your hunger will pull what you are hungering for in other word hunger and thirst have a power that's right to pull whatever they have toward them yes let's go slowly somebody need to get this in the message show us the father and he sesses brother Bram says this in paragraph 24 but notice when a man is what hunger and thirsting for who God God will do what draw nigh to the man always not sometime amen amen so when you begin to hunger for God and to thirst for God automatically you are pulling God towards you in other words power hunger and thirst have a power of Attraction amen are you following me amen are you following me am if you hunger for God and it's pulling God toward you this hunger for God is not a natural hunger amen it is the hunger that is coming from the soul or from the heart amen so your soul when it begin to hunger it's a dangerous thing amen are we together when your soul begin to hunger and to thirst that Soul has the power to pull whatever it's hungering towards you amen that's right amen amen Lord help me brother Bram say when a man is hungering and thirsting for God God will draw n to that man how many times always see give up and do what Surrender Your Will to god let's continue brother bam the Bible says this and it came to pass as the people were doing what pressed upon him to do what hear the word of God Jesus did what he stood the people were putting pressure upon him to do what to hear the word of God in other word the people were hungering that's what brother Bram explain I'm going to read it brother Bram said this that they said they press upon him to do what hear the word of God my that show they were what hungry in other words your hunger and thirst put pressure on God [Applause] Amen oh help me amen amen he said don't they you can't interest people for food until they get how hungry amen that's it so if you're not hungry we can't talk to you about it but when they get hungry then they can really what talk about food so when you begin to talk about something what does it mean you're hungry for it and if you hungry for it what will happen to that thing are we together are we together verse uh seven and that's the way it is if you are not interested in God you can't talk god to people amen but whenever they get hungering and thirsting after what righteousness God say they shall be fil but first there has to be a what a hunger and a what a thirst you really you have to do what really want it you must really want it you must desire it for it to pull toward you am Amen brother Bram says this in the message testimony hungering and thirsting you can't interest people until they get thirsty for some water unless they are hungry you can't tell them about nothing to eat amen we clear praise be to the name of the Lord Divine Healing today is not for the unbeliever it is for those who believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit today is not for unbeliever it is for those who believe Jesus di for who Believers not for the unbeliever it is for those who do what believe the supernatural follow who is what Supernatural minded if you are Supernatural minded the supernatural will come toward you whatever you are thirsting and hungering you actually are pulling that thing toward you that's why Abraham could call things that existed not as though they existed Abraham was not just calling them like that amen because out of the abundance of the does the mouth do what and when you speaking from your heart you actually pulling something toward you are we together brother bham continue he says when when they're hungering and thirsting when you get a what an expectancy expectation when you read God's word and expect to see God perform what he say he will do God will do what do it your hunger is cou with an expectation am when you say give me this day my daily bread you are expecting to receive something from the one you asking [Music] am everybody okay because whoever approaches God must believe that he is and he is the what reward he's going to reward the one who does what Dent the one who's hungering for him amen the one who's thirsting for him God will respond according to your hunger let's go to the book of act act chapter 10 the blessing through thirst and through hunger amen amen praise be to the name of the Lord act chapter 10 very familiar story if you there you can say amen amen verse 9 on the tomorrow as they went on their Journey God met the angel of the Lord came and talked to Cornelius and say your prayer are answer and everything go send and go get Peter and bring Peter to your home amen verse 9 on the tomorrow as they went on their journey and Drew near the city they were going to get Peter Peter went up where upon the Housetop to do what pray to pray about the what the sixth hour we clear verse 10 and he became how very hungry is my Bible different than yours sir why are this thing happen when people are hungry I'm reading the Bible when David was hungry something happened when Jesus was hungry something happened when Jesus was hungry in the wilderness something was happened when Ismael is thirsty something is happened now Peter is very hungry very hry amen and he became how very hungry verse 10 and would have what e but while they make ready he did what he fell into a the vision never came to Peter until he begin to hunger I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying that's why fasting sometime open up [Applause] doors right there everybody okay everybody okay because when God took opportunity not when Peter was F only when Peter begin to hunger that's when the Holy Spirit came to give him a message only when he was hungry amen verse 11 if you thereare you can say amen amen and so how Heaven open he saw heaven open when he was hungry For the First Time Peter is seeing Heaven open through hunger Hallelujah he see Heaven open and a certain water vessel descending to him as he had been a great sheet knit at the Four Corners and let down to the Earth wherein were what all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and what vows of the air and there came a voice to him rise Peter and do what kill and eat but Peter said not so Lord for I have never eaten anything that is what common or what and the voice spoke to him again the second time what God has cleansed th call not what Thou come God used the hunger of Peter to break a tradition from Peter because the Commandment of Jesus Christ was nobody can preach to the Gentile but Peter was given the keys amen because Jesus told him that he gave him the key and on the day of Pentecost he was the first one to preach the gospel now who's going to bring the gospel to the Gentile he must be Peter but Jesus Christ locked the door Lo but to open the door to the Gentile P must be hungry and God used his hunger to break to give him a revelation about you and me so that the Holy G ghost can come to you and me without the laying on [Applause] hand huah are you following me yes are we together jump to verse 24 glory to God the Bible says and the tomorrow after they enter what into cesaria they they already got Peter they went with Peter to the house of Cornelius and Cornelius was doing what waited for them Cornelius was already already waiting for them and had called what together his what his Kinsmen and what near friends so what was happening to the heart of those people they were under what expectation they were already expecting and to show you that they were under expectation watch what he does Amen verse 25 and as Peter was coming in cornelus met him and did what fell down at his feet and did what and worship do you see what kind of expectation he had he was already waiting he said this is Peter that's the man that they Tau me he begin to worship Peter Peter say no no no no no no no no don't do that come on we clear we clear amen jump to verse uh uh 26 but Peter took him up saying stand up I myself also I am what amen and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together and he said to them you know how that it is unlawful thing for a man that is what a Jew to keep what company or come to one that is what another Nation but God has shown me when I was hungry that I should not call any man how coming or what clean therefore came out to you without again saying as soon as I was sent for I asked therefore For What in 10 you have sent me in other word why did you send me why why did you call for me watch verse 30 and Cornelius say 4 days ago I was doing what all right now so the angel of the Lord came to P to to Cornelius after what after what after FAS thing the angel of the Lord drop down are we do you follow me I'm going slowly so we can get this together amen and fasting until the what hour and at the 9 hour I pray in my house and behold the water amen so when did the angel come after he finish his fasting we clear and brother Bram told us when you finish your fasting what happened how do you know you finish your fasting when you begin to do what hry that's when the angel came amen and the choice the vision came to Peter when he was hungry hungry hunger in these two cases is creating expectation that's right praise God amen amen let's go quickly to verse uh uh let me go to verse 33 for time immediately therefore I send to you and you have well done that you are come now therefore are we all here what present before who God to hear what all things everything that are commanded you of what God in other word we are sitting right here we are waiting we want you to speak we are already under expect we are hungry we want you to speak we are already expecting and because of that hunger the Holy Spirit never waited for Peter to finish the sermon Glory Glory brother say because they were already ready ready how hungering for God and the Holy Spirit automatically came down what are you trying to say brother Steven brother Bram say that's right no what waiting no what teing the apostolic way God has no what set R when the heart is H hungry he shall give you what what hungering for if you want the Holy Ghost he can fall on you when right now so the key to receive the Holy Spirit you must hunger amen you must thirst after it and if you really me it it will pull the Holy Spirit toward you amen are we together am praise be to the name of the Lord the brother brandham says this you know when real faith strick into a heart they begin to do what hunger am amen let's read it again you know when real faith strick into their heart they begin to do what hunger so when you hungering by the soul it is an expression of Faith [Applause] amen there is a big trouble in this message that we don't understand what really faith is we have been taught so much about faith but we really don't understand faith is but what I'm trying to make you understand is Faith is different than what you think the hunger that you feel toward something all the thirst that you feel towards something it is actually Faith that's the reason why he have the potential to pull that thing towards you it is not your desire it is Faith pulling what Belong To You toward you am amen I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying I'm going to show you what brother brandham says but we know when real Faith struck Into the Heart they begin to do what hunger and they want to see let's continue brother brandham say brother I tell you when a man is really what getting Hunger and what thirsting for God he shall receive it amen amen the trouble of it is that the church is now what hungry enough hungry enough to what for who God is the reason the holy spirit is now moving into the church tonight that's the reason the son of the Apostle they sometimes say brother Bram how does this healing and the miracle and son and water it shall work if you believe it if you take God at his word he w produce God let me live to prove that around the world that that is true so will he work tonight in a Dr or anything else so will he work tonight in a Dr or anything else if you shall meet God condition God will meet you on those ground but you got to come to his what condition so brother Bram is saying that the trouble the reason why you don't see things happening in the church is for lack of hunger am because hunger is what pull God down blessed be the name of the Lord in the mess in question and answer brother Bram says this but if I had have it I put that first because if you got that the other will take place listen to this if you got that if you just get so what hungry for God what will happen shouting will take place amen come on brother amen come on brother amen your hunger bring God without anybody praying for [Applause] [Music] you your hunger bring God toward you without anyone preaching God to you nobody preach Ishmael God no preacher was there his thirst brought God down and brother Bram say as you hungering shouting will happen to you without anybody laying hand on you yes sir Amen brother Bram say if you got that if you just get so hungry for God what will happen speaking in tongues will take place amen am amen if you want to speak in tongue do you need me to lay hand on you what do you have to do H if you hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place if you got so hungry for God and you just keep on what hungering keep this up God seeing yourself get getting what just remember look out there is another Spirit trying to work itself in there stay right with who before God and do what humble and do what Trav of Soul as long as you keep hungering for God your hunger is what pull God step by step into your life amen every blessing of God can be rich when you thirst and hunger for it are we together blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Bram says this he says see before there can be a creation there has to be what a Creator to create what the creation and as long as you are is thirsting as long as in you is thirsting for what somewhere to touch there is surely a what a fountain open where somewhere that you can do what touch because it has to be amen something created that in you amen that's it Lord am the hungering I'm talking about is something that was created in you but you usually think it's you thinking it come on Lord come on come on Lord break that the Lord Jesus Christ was in the womb of Mary but Mary had nothing to do with Jesus Christ everybody okay he was a child that look like the child of Mary but he was actually a child that was dropping to [Applause] Mary The Thirst that you hungering for even though it's in you it didn't come from you it is God thinking in [Applause] you nothing can create anything except God if it t create something it is God creating [Applause] something are we together did you sleep well change me the battery here my friend change me the battery here my friend let me read it again praise be to the name of God he said before they can be a creation there has to be what Creator to create what creation the creation and as long as you in you is thirsting for somewhere to touch in other word inside of you something is pushing and thirsting to get something there is surely a fountain open open somewhere that you can touch because he has to be something created that in you in other words it didn't just come like that the desire the painful desire that you feeling in you it didn't just come like that why are you the only one thinking that why is everybody around you okay and you the only one that is not okay brother Bram say it's something that created that brother BR say if there is if there was no Bible to tell us so still it would have to be a what a reality because there is something in you that a what a creator has what has created amen and before they can be a what that's what I was getting to you they there has to be something to do what to fulfill that desire did you ever have something you were hungering for and you just could not get the taste of it after a while you got iten I want you to read can you read it over my friend um from did you ever go ahead uhhuh did you ever have something you were hungering for did you ever had something you were hungering for and you just couldn't get the taste of it and you just could not get the taste of it and after what what you got it in other words you were Desiring something and you knew it was impossible for you to reach it and even sometime you even try you say you know what I I will never reach your I will never get something like this and after a few years you begin to have what you thought you cannot qualify sir [Applause] let me explain to you this have you ever look at something and you look you say I cannot afford it can you check somebody else [Applause] hand Hallelujah come on Jesus so we can drop this thing very good amen amen amen have you ever watched few years in your [Music] life amen let me just take an example okay I'm taking an example you look at the house and you and you look and you ask the price and they say this is the price you say no we cannot afford it and after 2 years you found out you are are living in the house how did you get in the house because at the beginning you say you cannot afford it at the beginning when you are looking you say no this is something I cannot reach this is for so and so but not for me I don't qualify for it only takes it few years and you begin to justess like brother Steven and at the beginning you thought brother Steven was higher have you ever thought about it what was pushing you to touch for [Applause] that I took myself as an example so I don't get anybody in trouble amen amen have you ever thought that when you get to the store you go to certain section and you avoiding those section you say we cannot go to that section we need to go to this section and after a few years you don't even realize that you already getting into those section and you don't know how it happened this is what brother Bram is saying here he says that did you ever have something you were hungering for and you just could not get the what the taste of it and after a while you do what you got it it seems like something happened out of somewhere you got it how did you got it because the one that was creating that was not true am it was God creating that in you amen and because he was God God must bring it to pass uh hallelujah hallelujah because he was faith in disgust in other word your desire was only a faith Amen in other word that hunger was only an indication that God is telling you what you qualify but your cor of thinking was fighting over it like I do not qualify when God is telling you this is what I'm showing [Applause] you father help me up listen to this expectation verse uh uh 54 42 now how many in here believe in Divine Healing let's see your hand am this is Brother BR I'm asking not me the power of w God thank you look before they can be a creation there has to be a Creator to create what that creation is that right well as long as you are hungering for what Divine Healing and the what power of God there's got to be a what a fountain open somewhere is that right if there is not Divine Healing you will not have that in your heart amen hallelujah in other word what you hungering is telling you it's existed if it was not existed you will not have hunger for it spoken word what is your message do not be Leed your hungering amen do not beler your cting amen whatever your heart is bringing up you need to embrace it because it's God indicating you [Applause] something yes sir yes sir let me let me go I'm going with simple things am okay because when we go this right people would say he's talking about material things all the time but I have to go that way so you understand amen am amen amen have you ever thought about buying an airplane he won't come to your mind right he won't come to your mind right right it won't come to your mind but if you go to somebody else they have that in their mind that's and when they talk to you you will see them crazy you will see them like the pride no it's the way God built them you can talk to somebody that I want you to live in the city they say no we don't want to live in the city I love to live in the country over there that's the way they were built and their heart will begin to pull something toward the country and you will find out then we end up buying a house in the country in other words that t will create that house and that t will Evacuate the the the the tenant that is there for some reason that tenant will sell that home because somebody's looking for that home amen because the reason why I ask you airplane is to show you that there are many thing that never cross your mind because they don't probably belong to you or maybe it's not your time yet but when the time begin to draw near then they begin to come don't be little it because if there was none of them there you would not have thirst for it the reason why you thirsting for it is because it's [Applause] there the reason why you are going to the father it's because food is to the [Music] father we okay my friend I'm good in time okay listen to brother Bram if there is not Divine Healing you what you won't not have that in your what the Creator God has to create that let me go this way if there is not Divine Healing you will not have that in your what heart so if you have it it means it's there the Creator God has to do what create in your heart before you can even what think of such a thing so when you thinking of [Applause] something let this mind yes be in you the man that was in Christ be in you you remember this you remember this right this is water this is water this is what and this is what amen this is is God yes sir amen amen this and this are together when this one is thinking this one hears it when God is thinking you just hearing what God is thinking and you say are you thinking what I'm thinking everybody together

Hunger are you ready verse three and they were how many LEP four LEP men and the entering of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we what all this time this lepers were fine and they were hungry and nothing happened but as soon as Elijah spoke Hallelujah when Elijah spoke the Le were not there were not present they didn't hear Elisha speaking for some reason it looks like something came to this Le like wait a minute why are we sitting like this why all this time they didn't have that thinking sir all the time that the city was besieged they didn't have that thinking only at this time amen God didn't choose a King amen he didn't choose a capit he didn't choose a banker he choose a lepos man in the city outside the gate they were sitting and they were hungry just like anybody else was hungry but that day something came upon the lepers and it looks like they were dreaming okay yeah we all struggling we all struggling wait a minute where did that Wai minute came from can I continue can I continue verse three and when there were four lepers men at the entering of the gate and they said to one another why sit we here until what they were already sitting there

here over there nothing in here nothing over there there is food you know what let's just go die over there amen amen if those lepers would have neglected this they would have blocked the salvation of the entire nation it looks like they are thinking among themselves amen but I'm going to show you that they were not thinking that thought came from somewhere because all this time they were sitting there they never thought about it those sudden thoughts hallu that come in your life sometime you sit in the situation for so long and you got used to it and suddenly it looks like you woke up like why is this going on in this house that thought is a Deliverance yes sir have you ever work in a job you work you work and you find and suddenly you say why am I suffering like this it is your deliverance if you neglect that you will stay in that job but if you wake up the blessing through hunger and thirst it took hunger for these people to wake up Hunger hit them in a different level they were hungry all this time but this hunger was a different one right let's see what happen amen question did God talk to them no please I'm trying to help you to the elementary to the kindergarten okay did God talk to them no no did they have that save the Lord did they see the angel of the Lord do they have a vision no upon which authority upon which authority so sometime we block ourself we want

that put that in you but we wait we say no no no no no no I must see a vision I'm going to pray for 3 month and then after 3 month I will see an angel coming back that's why brother Bram say work on that possession that's what he that's what he you need to understand that the holy spirit in your life have created a mixture of world sometime you are doing things sometime the holy spirit is doing things and it's like confusing you need to wake up to know when it's you and when it's not [Applause] you can I continue listen where are we at my friend where are we at verse 5 and he says and they arose up in water the Twilight to go up to the water the camp of the syrians do you know which Camp they were going to the camp of the enemy who gave them the courage everybody shut the city nobody

a weapon do they pick up any weapon no do they pick up any in for war just in case if they begin to fight they know how to defend no you don't need none of that you just need that thought that Dro in that thought that brought Bram say and then something came over [Applause] me and brother Bram who was looking for the gun forget the gun and he look at the ball he said listen I'm a servant of the Lord can a ball understand human language we were back in Eden amen God gave the ball an interpretation of the tongue to understand brother Bram and to go back and do exactly what brother Bram say [Applause] hallelujah listen my friend he says there was no man there verse six for the Lord has what made the host of the syan to hear what a noise of Chariots I'm asking you a question did the did these four lepers did God talk to them did God appear to them did God give them that save the Lord and say I'm going to deliver Israel by you which authority did they go through God was waiting for them to do the mov yes to do the move based on the thought that came in their mind in other word god deliver you the package and he's waiting for you to open the package and to begin to act upon the package hallelu question who guarantee these people that there is Deliverance there they say if we die we die so even though they were moving along and maybe talking okay when we get there you'll be the first one dealing huh you'll be the first one talking because you talk better than me okay you'll be there we say sir we come here as they're talking over there it is uh it is a a force everybody okay let's see what the Lord verse six for the Lord had made the what the host of the syri to do what hear a noise of Chariot and a noise of what horses even the noise of a what of a great and they say one to another Lord the king of what Israel has done what hired against us the king of what the Hittites and the king of the what Egyptian to come upon us was that the truth look what God is doing through a simple thought the thought that came in your mind like I'm tired of this situation I need to move forward that thought came from God listen to this verse seven wherefore they arose and did what in the what in the Twilight and left their what their tents and their what their horses and the what their asses even what the camp and for what their life stop do you give me time do you give me time Hallelujah when the four lepers were going to the camp they were looking for what they were looking for what food food yes sir period period big period food in other word if they get food the problem is what now what was the deposit over there read for me uh verse seven again when they get there they find what um the tents and what else horses and what else asses wow and what else even the camp as it was the whole Camp was left there as it was Jesus they were looking for what but look what was behind the [Music] hunger H if they didn't have a place to dwell they found a tent there if they didn't have a car to drive they found a horse there a horse is a car they found a NES there for free amen just because of that hunger am are you following me are you following me are you following me remember the prodal son was going to ask to be a servant but there was the best robe there was the fatted C everything that hunger was holding all those blessings father help me we on verse seven my friend verse uh 8 and when they LEP came to the water the uttermost part of the can they went into what one t and they did what eat and what and drink stop so the problem is finished right they were looking for what they did eat and did what so normally they should stop and do what and go back because their problem is finished look what God gave them because the one who fought the B was not them it was God who chased the enemy in other word when the enemy heard that sound if he has a cell phone before he run he leave the cell phone first then he run he can't run with the cell [Music] phone in other word whatever the enemy had did not belong to them the ownership change everybody okay everybody okay because God will give you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can above the thought that came in your heart there is more to it so when you don't Embrace that thought you are losing the combo it's a hamburger with a drink and french fries ah so take the hamburger the drink and the french fries come together they drunk and they ate Hallelujah that's what they were looking for so they need to depart and leave the camp let's see what happened my friend do you want to read with me or you want me to stop Mama we stop or move on okay mama say move on so you done amen listen to this he says verse 8 Hallelujah verse eight it says and when the this leper came to the ad most part of the what they went into the water one and they did what eat and what and drink come and did what and then silver silver and gold they carry what silver and what gold was that part of the package were they looking for that but when they move with the thought that came out the blessing through hunger and through thirst when they move with that thought they find out that God has more than what they were thinking Hallelujah now they were not just satisfied with food God begin to bless them financially Elisha say tomorrow you will find a fine flower Elisha was prophesying about food yes he was but not money not silver and gold So when you say give us this day our daily bread food that food doesn't come just food h hallah he will come up without the things oh my God When you pray in the morning you say God today I woke up give me this day my daily bread you are asking more stuff your man you are thinking it's food but Jesus says a father give what all what F or what good

Jordan and lo all the way was full of what garment and what vessel which The Who syan Cast Away in what in their H and the messenger returned and told the what even vessels were left on the road and they took and the whole city came and got food why somebody got took heed Amen to the simple thought that came into the listen to what brother Bram says now look there was some water Le where set at the gate continue my friend of Samaria uhhuh when the syrians had had it besieged do you remember the story in the Bible they say why do we sit here until we die if we go in the city then what we die they are what starving hunger if we sit here we do what die if we go down to the camp of the Syrian if they kill us we just what die because we are going to do what die anyhow well they if they save us we what we live isn't that right you ready by that man leader shadow shadow of what so what moved them was what that thought that you think is just a thinking that is faith that little man shadow of what they moved toward the camp of what the enemy and God did what rewarded them now when he saved them that save the whole what all Israel isn't that right now you are not ask tonight to go to the camp of what the enemy you are asked to come to the house of what father where he is expecting you to come for your what your healing well why do you set healing until you what let's do what something about it let's do what believe God let's go what out and face it with God's What Spirit upon [Applause] us what a chance was that to an enemy and them lepers so you are not in that position tonight but perhaps you are sitting in this chair you are got cancer you are eat up with cancer TB and so forth there is not a thing on the you can do about it your doctor has done all he can do medical science everything has done all they can do if you are sitting there you are bound to do what die in that condition so let's what do something about it we got a chance tonight and that's not go down to the enemy's camp but to do what come to your lovely heavenly father who's what promise to heal you you are going to die what anyhow so let's come and do what believe his word he may what not he may he will he he just only what wanting you to believe it and to what exercise a little faith can you do that amen can you believe tonight for anything oh my brother sister if you could only take hold Y and say Yes Lord what if you believe dwell deep enough in what your heart there is no thought not enough devil in this country to do what keep [Music] you Hall h blessings of God through thirst and hunger The Thirst and hungering of your soul has a secret it is not just a thirst it is not just a hungering that does even give you power over your enemy yes sir yes sir yes sir amen hallelujah can you read it my friend if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink stop when do you knock the enemy when he's how and when he's whatst Jesus when he's hungry you take opportunity of that hunger do him good that's it I'm reading to you the scripture if that enemy be hungry give him what bread to eat if he be thirsty give him what water to drink for that shall Heap Water Co of fire upon his head and the Lord shall do what reward thee blessing through thirst and hunger even the tast of your enemy that's what you overcome him with when he's in need you give him something you overcome with that's why when the Syrian got caught and Elisha took them and put them in a trap and the King came he said you know what let's kill all of them Elisha said don't kill them it's in the Bible am he said give them bread and water amen and let them go and the world was finished they never came back again the blessing through thirst and hunger when that enemy the one who's doing you harm when you see him in a difficulty help him you lock him his hunger is your blessing because it's your opportunity to overcome his thirst is your blessing it's your opportunity to overcome it your blessing through thirst and hunger let me see where I am my friend I have to stop it's 43 I went 13 minutes over amen blessing through thirst and through hunger amen the third pool of Jesus Christ through hunger Peter through hunger David through hunger Jesus in the wilderness through hunger Israel through hunger the four lepers through hunger Egypt and Pharaoh through hunger your enemy through hunger and thirst Ishmael through hunger blessed are they that hunger and thirst your hunger pulls than Lord if you're hungry it's already there if he was not there you would not have hunger you would not have thirsted so wake up to what to the way God is dealing with your heart we are not just a church we are the BR of Jesus Christ and God is whispering things to his brother don't look at who in your family is the first one who is the last one don't look at who have accomplished this in church first that's not your problem don't look at who did this in the message that's not your problem look at yourself and God God will do something with you that he can do with you only there is one Moses to deliver Israel it's Moses and it's going to be Moses period if it's David it's David period he had big brother God left the big brother and went straight to him use what God is telling you if David would have stopped and say huh if I do something here they would say that I'm trying to show up let me just leave it alone he would have missed his opportunity amen amen David thought he was going to the battle to give food that's what he thought he was bringing food he didn't know he's going into something amen wake up my friend it is not just a simple thought before that thought was there God created let's [Applause] stand [Applause] Hallelujah I don't know what the Lord put in your heart I don't know what has been troubling you that's why it's important to stay away from distraction that's because the enemy put all the social media on you so that your mind is constantly bombarded with something else and you don't listen to the thoughts of God when they are pading your mind amen get some quiet time and meditate on him and you will begin to see things than because it's God language you go through a situation tight and suddenly it's like an nidea spark Clap That doesn't come like that it is God whispering but we got used to the movie where we think God is a big voice that say Abraham Abraham that's what we are waiting for and we miss God God is very simple those four lepers would have blocked the entire change of their life they could have stayed leper the entire life right but that opportunity changed their life they were not just leper normal leper they were Leopard with silver and gold with Remnant and all this kind of stuff and they become hero until they put them in the Bible and we begin to read them and they become part of the word of God am they didn't look at their condition and say we are leopard we don't qualify in Israel we already reject said according to the Lord that's why we stand outside of the city amen if God want to use somebody he would have used somebody in the city not us they didn't look at that break your complexes no matter situation that you went through or where you were or what happened to your life that you got into a certain situation that are stuck with you break that away it doesn't stop God from working with you it would not block God from accessing you amen if RAB did not move with the possession of her heart she would have died with her entire family she Follow by faith and she saved her entire family and she saved herself because Rahab operated with what came up it was a risk for her yes he almost cost her life but he saved her and put her here and before she goes she said give me a true token that's right in other way you're not going like this who told her when they give you the Scarlet tra they're going to save you why didn't the coming down of the wall bring down her house can a Scarlet thread protect the building what kind of protection is that one who was protecting the building just a little thread that was hanging on like this can protect the building so the little act that you're doing it's pulling almighty God there let's pray heavenly father thank you Lord Lord we approaching you humbly this afternoon father once again we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for revealing yourself in Simplicity father I've been in this message for a while and I heard the talk of the people before even I became a pastor we heard many sermon until we got so confused about the operation of the gift about the way you deal with your children and this is what was the cause of so much confusion about the evidence of the holy spirit because some testify that they roll on the floor some testify that they spoke in tongue some testify that A Light Came Upon them some felt this and that and other don't feel nothing until they don't know whether they got the holy ho Spirit or not they're not even sure whether you deal with them or not because ad have testified to see a vision or to see an angel but they have never received any encounter in their life but father you brought us back to the common denominator which is the word of God that heaven and earth may pass away but your word is will never pass away and now you are bringing your children to the very Simplicity of the gospel of a Christian Life and walk so that they can be aware that you are always there and you even mind the very little thing in their life father may you give us this alertness of the spirit so that we can seize Our Moment so that we can seize our possession so that we can seize our opportunity that little SP of moment that you send an information to take us from a bad situation into a complete and total Deliverance Lord we spoke here and there but you the great teacher may you take what was spoken Lord and put them together and continue to unfold your word to your children so that they can realize that all this time you have been working in their life and they were not just being aware of it and now that you brought this to light Lord may we become more aware and more sensitive of the spirit so that we can see your glory in this year 2024 and be delivered completely from all our trouble we thank you and commit everything unto the hand may you continue to bless and protect them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you church we love you brother John fill it up and make me whole feel my cup Lord I Lift It Up
