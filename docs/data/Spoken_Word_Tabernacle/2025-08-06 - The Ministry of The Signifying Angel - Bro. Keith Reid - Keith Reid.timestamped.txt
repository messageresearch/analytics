[0:02] grow together. Notice
[0:04] as the beast went out, uh the antichrist
[0:08] went out on a beast, his power.
[0:12] Oh, I love this. I just beginning to

[0:21] Oh, see them them revelations and the
[0:24] presence of that ball of fire hanging
[0:27] there in a room. Oh, brother.
[0:30] Although I've seen it since a child,

[0:35] me. It almost puts in unconscious
[0:37] condition.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; You never get used to it. You can't.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; It's too sacred. Notice as the

[0:54] it.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:57] See, now watch. Then every time the

[44:03] call, I say, "You're still working. Did
[44:05] you get something?" They say, "Yes,
[44:06] sister. You did eat some good
[44:08] sandwiches. They taste so good. They
[44:10] were good." So, I'm the one who missed
[44:13] the sandwiches. But it's okay.
[44:17] I was about to drive after work to come.
[44:19] They say no, no, brother Robert say
[44:21] everything is okay. You don't have to
[44:22] come here. All is well by God's grace.
[44:24] Amen. So you keep praying over there.
[44:27] The door are already locked. We're
[44:28] working on the lock. So probably you
[44:31] won't have your um
[44:34] special visit
[44:37] because we are locking the building
[44:39] there. Things the AC is working
[44:41] everything is almost there. So we will
[44:44] be packing stuff there. So uh you might
[44:46] need brother set or me to go inside. So
[44:50] just or you might have to wait till the
[44:52] place is uh well furnished and
[44:56] everything. Amen. I'm sorry. I know you
[44:59] got used to going there and looking but
[45:01] we got to we got to a point where we
[45:03] have to lock everything now. So just
[45:06] give us some little bit of time and we
[45:08] see what to do. You heard the trustee
[45:09] saying amen there. So I can't I can't I
[45:12] can't jump over the trustee. He's he's
[45:14] blocking it. So you negotiate with him
[45:17] and be nice to him and uh
[45:21] he will work you through. Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; So keep praying because God is working.
[45:26] He's moving with us in a miraculous way
[45:29] by his grace. Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; We doing this thing with faith.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; We don't have the money for the
[45:36] foundation, but we we we just went and
[45:38] the place
[45:40] &gt;&gt; the money will come.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] You know, if you don't have faith, the
[45:48] contractor have more faith than probably
[45:50] some of you.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; The contractor I'm working with, they
[45:54] they have more faith than more. I called
[45:56] the contractor. I said, "Listen, man.
[45:58] This is a small church and we don't have
[46:00] the money for the foundation yet." So,
[46:02] he said, "Pastor, don't worry about it.
[46:04] We will work things up. We will make it
[46:06] happen."
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And do you know what
[46:13] And do you know what he did? I'm trying
[46:15] to slow him down. He says, "No, I'm
[46:16] going to order the rebar that goes
[46:18] there."
[46:21] &gt;&gt; I say, "Okay, he's ordering the rebar.
[46:23] We need money." I I let it go because
[46:25] I'm not the one driving everything. God
[46:28] is the one building this church.
[46:33] Amen.
[46:34] Amen. You know, I was uh uh talking to
[46:39] my children last night. We were going
[46:41] through Ephesians, too. And I was trying
[46:44] to explain them faith. And then in their
[46:46] school, we usually pay for food.
[46:49] So, you pay for food and then you have
[46:51] to pay every month. If not, you got to
[46:53] pack food. So, you got to pay for it.
[46:55] And then they have to go there and they
[46:56] call your name and you go get food
[46:58] because they're using outside vendors.
[47:00] So, you got to pay actually me and it's
[47:02] uh it's expensive and things. So, uh, I
[47:06] told them, I say, "When you go to
[47:08] school, when I told you I paid for your
[47:10] school, uh, meal," I say, "When you go
[47:12] to school, how do you know you're going
[47:14] to get the food?"
[47:18] &gt;&gt; They say, "Because you pay for it."
[47:21] &gt;&gt; I say, "How do you know?" I say, "Do you
[47:23] have a proof that I pay for it?"
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Your word.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; They took my word. Yeah.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see how simple they go? When
[47:33] I'm trying to avoid preaching because
[47:36] when I begin to talk to them, Ephesians
[47:38] 2 open up to me. I begin to see things
[47:41] differently. I say, "Oh my god, this is
[47:42] a whole sermon here." And I told them, I
[47:45] say, "What about if you go, I say, when
[47:47] you go there to go get your food, what
[47:49] happened?"
[47:50] &gt;&gt; They say, "They call you by name."
[47:53] [Applause]
[47:55] &gt;&gt; I said, "So your name was written
[47:57] where?"
[47:58] And then my daughter say before the
[48:00] foundation of the world.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; I said, "What about if your friend tells
[48:09] you that you know what they're not going
[48:11] to give you food?" I said, "Would you
[48:13] believe it?" They say, "No." I said, "If
[48:16] you believe it, what happened?" He say,
[48:17] "You are denying what daddy say."
[48:19] [Music]
[48:21] &gt;&gt; I I said, "So basically, when you go
[48:23] grab food, do you know if the teacher
[48:26] will say yes or no?" They don't even
[48:28] care about it.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; I said that is what faith is.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; I said that's the same thing when Jesus
[48:35] paid the price on Calvary.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Everything was already paid there
[48:40] &gt;&gt; and whatever Jesus say by his word. We
[48:43] just believe it and we minding what he
[48:47] says and we are acting moving by faith
[48:51] &gt;&gt; and knowing that God will honor his word
[48:54] and we have trust. And I read the
[48:56] scripture. The Bible say if you wicked,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; you know how to give good gift to your
[49:03] children.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; How much more your heavenly father
[49:07] &gt;&gt; will give the Holy Spirit to those who
[49:09] ask him.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Brother, the gospel is very simple.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Very simple. I'm going to refrain myself
[49:17] from uh preaching because you are now
[49:20] understand the relationship of an ant
[49:23] and the creator. God want to lead you
[49:25] yourself.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know God is digging into avenues
[49:30] we never even thought. But all of that
[49:32] he sent his word so that his word will
[49:35] heal us. It's a word for healing our
[49:38] finances, healing our marriages, healing
[49:40] our job, healing our everything that we
[49:43] have, our school, everything. God is
[49:45] coming down and bringing healing
[49:47] everywhere. Amen. I am not preaching
[49:49] tonight. The one who's preaching is
[49:51] brother Keith Reed from Jamaica.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:55] Ah,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; this is a surprise in the middle of the
[50:01] week. Amen. Amen. So, Brother Keef, it's
[50:05] almost 30 years now. He's going to have
[50:07] 30 years of being a pastor.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, I told him, I said,
[50:11] "Brother Keith, people know you. You
[50:12] preach like home
[50:14] &gt;&gt; and we will pull like home."
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. One thing I forgot to tell him is
[50:18] Wednesday is our convention. And also
[50:20] whenever you get a chance, don't forget
[50:21] brother Joe Green have a meeting there.
[50:24] So whenever you can, let's support the
[50:26] meeting. It will end up actually on
[50:27] Friday. Amen. So let's pull on the gift
[50:30] of the Lord and good to see everybody.
[50:32] If I forgot someone, God richly bless
[50:34] you. Let's go with only believe forever.
[50:39] Oh
[50:42] believe.
[50:47] Oh,
[50:49] they believe
[50:54] all of him are impossible.
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] All he
[51:04] believe
[51:13] [Music]
[51:26] was you.
[51:30] Oh,

[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; How many love him tonight?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[52:44] We certainly
[52:46] just thank God for his care and his
[52:48] mercies towards us.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanking us for thanking him for
[52:53] foring us this privilege
[52:55] &gt;&gt; of being in his house. One more time.
[52:57] Praise the Lord.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Um I was thinking as I was coming that
[53:01] Gastonia means so much to me.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You know this was my first place in the
[53:07] US that I I came I preach
[53:10] &gt;&gt; and uh that is many many years ago. Um,
[53:14] I was just a young evangelist. And then
[53:17] to think that this year I was I I came
[53:20] back from Africa in Easter and they had
[53:24] uh planned behind me, you know, the
[53:26] celebration of my 30th year of pastoring
[53:29] and it seems just like yesterday.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But we I'm glad to see
[53:35] the faces. um the dear friends and
[53:38] family to us really you know brother
[53:40] Daly and the family sister um
[53:43] Bridgetette
[53:45] um you know and so brother Falby and
[53:48] just the different ones really that we
[53:50] go back so far.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But we thank God
[53:55] &gt;&gt; for what he has been doing. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And what he will continue to do
[54:01] &gt;&gt; we we thank God for your pastor.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I was telling him that um I I
[54:07] was in Camos um Kenya and um when when
[54:12] they tell me of the place that I was
[54:13] supposed to go, I I found it on Google
[54:16] and I realized that I'm actually going
[54:17] into the forest. And so here I was in
[54:21] the forest and I I I get there, I didn't
[54:23] know anybody, but somebody came to me
[54:25] and said, "I I know you because when you
[54:28] preach for brother Shimbo, I I heard you
[54:31] preach.
[54:34] So I I I tell him now you you got to be
[54:37] careful
[54:38] &gt;&gt; because uh you you know sometimes you
[54:41] think that you're just conducting things
[54:42] in your own little local church,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; but there's somebody way off in the
[54:46] forest somewhere
[54:48] &gt;&gt; that is taking instructions from you.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But but we thank God.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And while I was there, you know,
[54:56] from our home church in Jamaica, there
[54:59] was a group from Kissy, Kenya, which
[55:02] they said they were 8 hours from Kamosi.
[55:06] And um when I get to Campala, I sent the
[55:09] funds to invite them up to the
[55:11] convention and they were there and they
[55:13] were not even yet message believers.
[55:16] They were just listening to the message
[55:18] from, you know, our church really. And
[55:21] and so we packed them with the food.
[55:23] Uh-huh.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You know, you know, and and put them on
[55:26] the bus and send them back, you know,
[55:28] there. I I'm I'm constantly in touch
[55:30] with them. The brothers have gone down
[55:32] to them really and one by one.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Because you you you know how long we're
[55:38] going to be here until the last one.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Receive the revelation.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[55:47] And one thing I find that uh you know
[55:49] sometimes there's many who had believed
[55:52] they've come out they've believed that
[55:54] God has sent a prophet but that's not
[55:57] all that we believe.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; You you know we believe that the lamb
[56:01] had take the book.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And when he took the book the book was
[56:06] closed but he opened the book.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And he released the seals.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. A and the seals were on the
[56:15] outside, but there was something inside.
[56:18] Seven thunders giving the bride
[56:20] rapturing faith.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Because until we catch all of that
[56:27] revelation, we are still going to be on
[56:29] this side.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; But but we got to leave out of here.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. In a mount Zion rapture showdown.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we'd like to go to the
[56:38] word. I'd like to Amen. You know, Lord,
[56:40] give me just this inspiration. something
[56:42] I was uh speaking back at home and it
[56:45] hit me so hard. Yes, sir.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; You know, and this week I I you know, as
[56:49] I was at the meetings there in Ruth,
[56:52] North Carolina and you ought to visit
[56:54] sometimes.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Um this is the 52nd year of the
[56:59] missionary convention in Ruth, North
[57:01] Carolina.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And that's a meeting like no other
[57:04] because the focus of that meeting is to
[57:07] um you know build churches all over the
[57:11] world. And so last year I was in um
[57:15] Uganda and in the eastern region there
[57:17] was 10 churches that we were being built
[57:20] and um you know I had a chance to go and
[57:23] to see the structure see what the
[57:25] brothers are doing with you know the
[57:26] funds that was sent to them and so
[57:28] because it's all right to bring people
[57:29] to the message but to find somewhere for
[57:32] them to you know gather together and to
[57:34] feel that sense you know like you're now
[57:37] building a church and um you know you
[57:39] you bought a church but now you're
[57:41] adding to it and there's going to be
[57:43] things that you do yourself and you feel
[57:45] a part of it really that that's a part
[57:47] of the experience you know I remember
[57:49] back home in Jamaica we were building a
[57:51] church and you know we had the they
[57:54] laugh at us because there was one time
[57:56] there was nine sisters that was pregnant
[57:58] you know and they were passing the
[57:59] bucket with the martr and all of that
[58:01] really but you know we thank God for
[58:03] those experience really you know to
[58:06] today we can reach out to others and we
[58:08] understand the experience amen praise
[58:10] Praise God. So we we thank God we're a
[58:13] family together.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let us just bow our
[58:17] heads before we go to the scriptures.
[58:20] Oh heavenly father and oh God. Father we
[58:23] thank you God for this privilege of
[58:25] being in your house Lord God. And to
[58:28] Lord see people of like precious faith
[58:30] uh that speak oh God an eternal language
[58:34] oh God by the angel of the covenant for
[58:37] this day. Father, we thank you, Lord
[58:40] God, that Lord, we're no longer grouping
[58:42] in darkness, but Lord God, you've sent a
[58:45] light in the healing time. And Lord God,
[58:48] we have come to that light, God, and
[58:51] realize that this is a special moment
[58:53] when Lord God, though, the world is
[58:56] going into another direction, but Lord,
[58:58] we are gathering rapturing faith for a
[59:01] rapture to get out of here. Oh God,
[59:04] Father, we pray that you give us
[59:05] strength. Help us to move us out of the
[59:07] way that you might be glorified behind
[59:10] skin.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Have thine own way with us. Remember the
[59:13] sick and the afflicted and the downcast.
[59:16] Lord God, Lord, may we say like Jude,
[59:19] let the weak say that I'm strong in the
[59:21] Lord. Have thy way as we look to you and
[59:23] believe you.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And amen. I'd like to read first from uh
[59:31] Revelation chapter one. Yes, sir.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And uh I read verse one. You can keep
[59:36] your Bibles open as we go through the
[59:38] scriptures. And I'm going to read from
[59:39] Joel chapter 2 as we go on.
[59:43] Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; The I want us to just examine the
[59:48] scriptures carefully as we read it, not
[59:50] just to, you know, go over it quickly.
[59:53] It says, "The revelation of Jesus
[59:56] Christ." That's right. which God gave
[59:58] unto him
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; to show unto his servants things which
[1:00:03] must shortly come to pass.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And he sent and signify it by his angel.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Singular unto his servant John.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God. May the Lord add his
[1:00:19] blessing to the reading of the word.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] I
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to speak on the sign the the
[1:00:27] ministry of the signifying angel.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; You know this is not the revelation of
[1:00:35] John.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; It is a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice the way that it
[1:00:43] came to John
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham said that John
[1:00:47] represent the bride.
[1:00:50] And I want to bring you into the period
[1:00:53] of time
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; that this revelation came forth. Is that
[1:00:57] right?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; The the Bible said it's a revelation of
[1:01:00] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus is a morpher of God.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Is a word made flesh.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Is the image of the invisible God. So we
[1:01:18] say clearly that Jesus Christ is God.
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God was making himself
[1:01:26] plain. Hallelujah. And he's going to
[1:01:29] bring it to his servant John. But God
[1:01:32] selected an angel
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; to signify it really. And that is very
[1:01:38] important.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] Because uh there in verse 70, the Bible
[1:01:45] says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his
[1:01:48] feet as dead.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And he laid his right hand upon me,
[1:01:53] saying unto me, fear not.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; I am the first
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; and the last."
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:02:08] and behold I'm alive forever more.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as a key of hell and
[1:02:15] death.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now the book of revelation we find that
[1:02:19] sometimes the lamb himself speak
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; but sometimes the signifying angel was
[1:02:27] speaking.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:31] Now, before we go any further, I'd like
[1:02:33] to show you in position exactly where he
[1:02:37] was.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Now, look at verse 10. He said, "And I
[1:02:41] was in the spirit
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; on the Lord's day."
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; It was a thousand years.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; John was actually in the vision.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I heard behind me
[1:03:01] Not in front of me.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I heard behind me.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Very important. Amen. A great voice as
[1:03:10] of a trumpet.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to show you that where John
[1:03:14] was, he said, the voice of the trumpet
[1:03:17] was behind me.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And it says, I am alpha and omega.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the first and the last.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Now verse 12 says, "And I turn to see."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if John was like this,
[1:03:39] uh, I heard a voice where? Not beside
[1:03:43] me, not in front of me, but behind me.
[1:03:47] And so John said, "I turn to see the
[1:03:50] voice."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. you you've got to get it
[1:03:58] in position
[1:04:00] is right or else you miss the picture.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So I turned to see the voice behind me.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Glory and being and I turned to see the
[1:04:12] voice be hallelujah that spake with me
[1:04:15] and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:04:19] candlestick.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:22] Now the Bible go on to tell us what the
[1:04:24] seven golden candlestick is. It's a
[1:04:27] seven church
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; and there were seven stars.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; But where was it?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; It was behind him.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; So it mean that John had gone before.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Then let us turn to Revelation 4 and
[1:04:42] verse one.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody. Oh, you just pray
[1:04:47] for me this tonight.
[1:04:50] He said, "And after this."
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Now, you know that the church ages was
[1:04:55] Revelation 2
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and Revelation 3.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But in Revelation chapter 4 and one.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; And and after this I look after what?
[1:05:10] After the ages.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; After the church age. After let us
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; after it passed through Leosia,
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; after I was called up out of Leosia.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "And behold, a door was open in
[1:05:31] heaven."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Now, a door is a revelation.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And Christ is that revelation.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was open in heaven. So he
[1:05:45] had passed through the age and he heard
[1:05:48] a voice and the voice said, "Come up
[1:05:50] either
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and I will show thee things uh which
[1:05:54] must be ear after the ages."
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Now we've got to know where the bride
[1:06:01] is.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; The bride is not in the age, but the
[1:06:06] bride has been called out of let us see
[1:06:09] her. Come up higher.
[1:06:13] Hallelujah.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The message to the bride is when the
[1:06:18] seals were open
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; is a rat.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Come up higher. Let me show you things
[1:06:25] uh that must be hereafter.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; The bride is not in the age. You are
[1:06:31] called out of the age. We're not the
[1:06:34] church of Leosia. We are called out of
[1:06:37] Leosia into the bright age.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 19 and verse 10,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You find
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. And I fell at his feet
[1:07:04] to worship him. Whose feet? The
[1:07:07] signifying angel. The angel that was
[1:07:10] talking to me that was showing me these
[1:07:13] things. I fell down at his feet. You
[1:07:16] know why? Because he had made Christ so
[1:07:20] plain before me.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:07:24] Amen. That his words uh his words uh
[1:07:28] were the very revelation of Jesus
[1:07:30] Christ.
[1:07:31] Amen. So I fell down at his feet. But
[1:07:34] watch it now. Hallelujah. He said, "See
[1:07:37] thou do it not.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; For I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:07:42] brethren which have the testimony of
[1:07:45] who?"
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Worship who?
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the testimony of Jesus is a
[1:07:52] spirit of what?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Prophecy.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you notice in Revelation
[1:08:01] chapter one when he said I'm alpha and
[1:08:03] omega.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John said I fell down at his
[1:08:06] feet. He put his hand upon me is a rot.
[1:08:10] He is the one. Not the nail car hands.
[1:08:14] No. But the one that had come down.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Now we've got to put the word in
[1:08:21] perspective and know exactly where we
[1:08:24] are.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? You know
[1:08:27] sometimes we said ah I believe the
[1:08:29] message I believe the message. Amen. But
[1:08:32] how do you see the message? Uh the
[1:08:34] message to the bride. Uh it begins with
[1:08:37] the opening of the seals.
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:44] The prophet of God said not in the years
[1:08:47] of preparation
[1:08:48] but when he begins to declare his
[1:08:51] message.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? Hallelujah.
[1:08:54] That's where we are. You got to be
[1:08:56] caught up in the revelation of the words
[1:09:00] of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Glory. Are you still with me?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Are you still there?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we find that the signifying
[1:09:11] angel, Amen, to John was not to be
[1:09:14] worshiped.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Are you there? Hallelujah. But in
[1:09:18] Revelation 22 and verse 8, uh,
[1:09:21] hallelujah. Amen. Let me read from verse
[1:09:23] 6. He said, "And he said unto me, these
[1:09:26] things are true and are faithful and
[1:09:28] true. And the Lord God of the holy
[1:09:31] prophets sent his angel to show unto his
[1:09:34] servants the things which must be surely
[1:09:37] done, which must be shortly be done.
[1:09:40] Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he
[1:09:43] that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; of what?
[1:09:50] this book.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation is not for
[1:09:55] everybody.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; That is why some churches don't read it
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; because they don't understand it.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? But the book of
[1:10:04] Revelation is our inheritance. Uh
[1:10:07] because it tell us exactly who we are.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? It show us in
[1:10:13] perspective.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I, John, verse 8. And I,
[1:10:21] John, saw these things, and I heard
[1:10:24] them. And when I heard and seen, I fell
[1:10:27] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:10:30] what? Angel, which show me these things.
[1:10:33] And he said, and said he unto me, See,
[1:10:36] thou do it not,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy
[1:10:42] brethren that have the prophecy.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And of them that keep the
[1:10:47] sayings of this book,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; worship God.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Can I quickly say to you,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; John becomes the bride.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; You're going to find yourself in the
[1:11:07] scripture.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we talk about Revelation 10:1.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Who was that Christ? Revelation 10:7.
[1:11:15] Who was that?
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; The signifying angel.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; But what about you?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 8 to 11. Is that right?
[1:11:28] For I take the book.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I take the book. I heed the
[1:11:34] book.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And I become what's in the book.
[1:11:40] Hey, your name is written in those
[1:11:44] seals. Your name is sealed up.
[1:11:51] Glory.
[1:11:53] That's your real name.
[1:11:55] Your your parents give you a name is a
[1:11:58] rat. That that's your name for this
[1:12:00] side. But there's another name that
[1:12:03] speak of you is a rat which your parents
[1:12:07] didn't know. Your mom and daddy didn't
[1:12:09] know that name. Uh, but you found your
[1:12:12] name. Uh, for your name is written uh in
[1:12:15] the revelation of who you are. Glory.
[1:12:20] Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Do you notice
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 5?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; When the cry went out, who is worthy?
[1:12:37] who made the cry, the signifying angel
[1:12:39] to John
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; to take the book.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And John said, "When there was none to
[1:12:45] to take the book and to release the
[1:12:47] seals, I cried."
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; You know why John cried? Because his
[1:12:51] name was sealed in.
[1:12:53] [Applause]
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; And if there was none worthy to open the
[1:12:58] book, then John would be lost. You and I
[1:13:01] would be lost. Hallelujah. But thank God
[1:13:05] for the elders.
[1:13:07] Thank God for the elders uh that kept
[1:13:10] the saying of the book. The elder
[1:13:13] touched me and said, "Weep not John, for
[1:13:16] behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:13:20] has prevailed."
[1:13:23] Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] Glory.
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:29] The lion has prevailed.
[1:13:32] But when John looked, he didn't see a
[1:13:35] lion
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; because the plan of redemption, the
[1:13:39] mediatory work was not over. So what
[1:13:43] John saw was a lamb.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] He saw a lamb. He saw a lamb. And that
[1:13:51] lamb was killed. That lamb was bloody.
[1:13:54] And that lamb was worthy.
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:14:02] And the lamb went and take the book
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the abstract owner
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; that take it when Adam fell and lost the
[1:14:12] book.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; So he was worthy to take the book and
[1:14:16] when he take the book hallelujah the
[1:14:19] focus move. Amen. To the worthiness of
[1:14:22] the lamb because the lamb is worthy. And
[1:14:25] John said, "All of heaven and all of
[1:14:28] earth would have heard me when I cried,
[1:14:32] blessing and honor and power and glory
[1:14:35] to the lamb.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Now an angel
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; is a messenger."
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And so you notice to all the seven ages,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; there was an angel
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; to the church is
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; there was a signifying angel to Ephesus.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; There's an angel to Smyrna.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; There's an angel to to Tyia.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And there's an angel to Leos here.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Isarat
[1:15:15] overcomers,
[1:15:16] you've got an angel.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; But the angel
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; to the age has got a ministry.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a ministry to the
[1:15:34] angel for that age.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't catch the
[1:15:38] revelation of the mystery
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; that the angel of the age break,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; then you miss the whole redemption plan.
[1:15:50] And God will do nothing but he reveal
[1:15:52] his secret unto his servant the
[1:15:56] prophets.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; So if John had an angel,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; then the bride must got an angel.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; John had a signifying angel. The bride
[1:16:15] got a signifying angel. Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And the words of that angel is going to
[1:16:21] be so clear
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; that many will try to worship
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; the angel.
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Pray for them. Pray for them for they
[1:16:35] missed the revelation by just that.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Just that John when his angel come, John
[1:16:43] fell down to worship him. But the angel
[1:16:46] tell him, "See thou do it not, for I am
[1:16:50] your fellow servant and of the Oh, glory
[1:16:53] to God." In other words, I am just
[1:16:56] Eleazar.
[1:16:58] I was charged to bring a bride for Isaac
[1:17:02] and I'm just carrying out my duty.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:09] Glory.
[1:17:11] But brother, it's so close. It's so
[1:17:14] close because the word he present will
[1:17:18] change my body.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; The word he present brings a birth.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Well, we got to get to the ministry
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; of the signifying angel for your day.
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:44] in Joel chapter 2
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; and verse 23 to 26.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; I will restore it.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Be glad then
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; it children of Zion.

[1:18:32] and oil,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; stimulation
[1:18:36] of revelation.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Don't give me theology. Give me
[1:18:41] revelation.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:24:58] place.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:02] There's no doctrine that's going to be
[1:25:03] left off.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; No, sir. God set his church the way he
[1:25:08] wants it.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; And he wants his church the way he said
[1:25:11] it.

[1:25:37] angel, God bring it to us by three
[1:25:40] pulls.
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Now notice Jesus's ministry
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; was in three stages.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And the marriage in Canaan of Galilee
[1:25:50] turned the water into wine. They said,
[1:25:53] "Ah, you left the best wine for the
[1:25:54] last." That was good.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. that when he met the woman
[1:26:00] of Samaria, he discerned the very
[1:26:02] thoughts and intents of her heart. Is
[1:26:05] that right? Oh, that was glorious.
[1:26:09] Is that right? But in St. John 6,
[1:26:13] Amen. But he said, "You got to eat my
[1:26:16] flesh and drink my blood or else you
[1:26:19] have no life in you. You got to feed on
[1:26:22] this word. This word has got to be your
[1:26:25] life.

[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; All in the third pull.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to break the third pull
[1:26:50] down in three.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And the first is a opening of the word.
[1:26:57] Are you with me?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Before I go there, may I clarify
[1:27:01] something?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; You see in page 3:27
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; of the church age bookh
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; it says the prophet comes to do two
[1:27:10] things
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; to turn the heart of the children back
[1:27:17] to the fathers.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And secondly,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; number two.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Number two.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Number two, very
[1:27:28] important
[1:27:30] because they're trying to establish
[1:27:32] number one and they're projecting number
[1:27:35] two
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries to reveal the
[1:27:39] mysteries to reveal the mysteries
[1:27:43] of the seven seals. Hold on a little
[1:27:46] bit. Hold on. P your mule. Hold your
[1:27:49] mule a little bit. Hold on. Hold on.
[1:27:52] Number two,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries of the seventh
[1:27:55] seal.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But watch what he said. It is these
[1:27:59] mystery reveal truth that will turn your
[1:28:02] hearts back.
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, it is the mystery revealed truth
[1:28:16] that will turn your hearts back.
[1:28:20] So if the mystery is not revealed, your
[1:28:22] heart's not turned back.
[1:28:29] [Applause]
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You can preach a closline doctrine all
[1:28:35] you want.
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You can preach the way you live, you
[1:28:42] live, you live. That's your business.
[1:28:45] But without the mystery of the seventh
[1:28:47] seal, your heart will not be turned
[1:28:50] back.
[1:28:52] This word is a covenant of the bride.
[1:28:58] That's why he said the bride must have a
[1:29:01] birth according to Malachi 4.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; What is going to bring the birth? The
[1:29:07] mysteries revealed.
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:20] Hallelujah.

[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; when you could preach one God,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; no problem.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Baptism in Jesus name, no problem.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You could preach a closline doctrine, no
[1:29:36] problem. Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; But if you preach the seven thunders,
[1:29:41] the third pull, the seventh seal open,
[1:29:44] there is a problem.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because quarters were up
[1:29:49] on our land. But in the name of Jesus,
[1:29:53] there's a people that is rising up.
[1:30:01] The old fighters uh are going off the
[1:30:04] scene and another generation uh is
[1:30:07] rising up with the word of God that
[1:30:11] said, "Give me the book. Give me the
[1:30:13] book. Give me the book."
[1:30:16] [Applause]
[1:30:19] Don't tell me what he meant. Just tell
[1:30:22] me what he said.
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:37] Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; The third pull.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word is the secret
[1:30:47] to the rapture.
[1:30:49] [Applause]

[1:31:13] behind him.
[1:31:20] It was behind him that when he heard the
[1:31:23] voice, he turned around to look back.
[1:31:26] But thanks be to God, having been called
[1:31:29] up, come up higher. Come up higher into
[1:31:34] the opening of the word.

[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; He's a great I am. And he stepped down.
[1:39:29] Revelation 10:1 come on the scene. Is a
[1:39:33] rot.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Well, what's going to happen? Woo.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Do Do you realize that? Brother Bam said
[1:39:41] Revelation 8:1 just give the scenery.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; The scenery.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And when he'd opened the seventh seal,
[1:39:50] there was silence in heaven.
[1:39:53] about half an hour.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; But but you know in Revelation five when
[1:39:57] he take the book there was a rejoicing
[1:39:59] [Applause]
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; But in Revelation 8:1 when he break the
[1:40:05] seventh seal
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; there was silence
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; because all redemption plan was now
[1:40:12] revealed.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you now.
[1:40:21] And when it's fully open, what did he
[1:40:23] do? He stepped down. I I'm going to take
[1:40:26] charge of what I've redeemed.
[1:40:30] Oh, glory. And so when he stepped down
[1:40:33] from heaven, there was silence.
[1:40:37] Because the lamb left, oh glory, the
[1:40:40] mercy seat. Oh go the the revelation was
[1:40:44] loose. Uhhuh. So he's come down now to
[1:40:46] claim every subject.
[1:40:49] None that the heavenly father give me
[1:40:52] shall be lost. Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] Nothing can stop you now. Every
[1:40:58] redemptive promise it's mine. Your
[1:41:02] healing is yours. Your redemption is
[1:41:05] yours. Your peace is yours.
[1:41:10] Tell them you can take my civil liberty,
[1:41:14] but you can't take my redemptive
[1:41:16] promise.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah. It's mine.
[1:41:22] God give it to me. Hallelujah.
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; So, Revelation 8:1, he step out from the
[1:41:35] throne
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and oh, silence. For wherever he is,
[1:41:40] there's a noise.
[1:41:44] And so when he stepped down the silence,
[1:41:46] but then there's going to be another
[1:41:48] shout.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 when he stepped down
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; and when he speak it was like a lion
[1:41:56] roar when this revelation hit you and
[1:41:59] seven and thundered their voice.
[1:42:08] And John said, "I was going to write it
[1:42:10] out."
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; But said, "No, John, don't write it.
[1:42:14] Seal it up. Seal it up until the time of
[1:42:18] the end."
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Then he put one foot on the sea, one
[1:42:23] foot on the hurt.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All authority is under your
[1:42:28] feet.
[1:42:31] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Don't
[1:42:35] worry because in the days of the voice
[1:42:38] of the seventh angel of the signifying
[1:42:42] angel to the bride all those mysteries
[1:42:46] will be finished as he has declared unto
[1:42:49] his servant the prophets
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; when he begin to declare his message
[1:42:59] it's a ministry of the signifying angel
[1:43:02] the first pull healing
[1:43:04] The second pull prophesying. The third
[1:43:08] pull the opening of the word and the
[1:43:11] mysteries reveal.
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; You see Kane
[1:43:18] Kane taught it was works.
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; He thought it was works.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Cain taught that it was works. But when
[1:43:30] he saw Abel
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; take a stone
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and try to cut
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; that lamb cuz it had to die.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And he hacked it and he hacked it. Woo!
[1:43:46] Blood splattered everywhere. What a mess
[1:43:49] that was. And Cain looked at it and
[1:43:51] said, "Uh-uh.
[1:43:53] It can't be." Oh, Jesus.
[1:43:57] Hallelujah. But I tell you what, a blood
[1:44:01] revelation.
[1:44:03] Woo! Jesus, that is going to take blood.
[1:44:07] Cuz I was looking at mom and daddy and I
[1:44:10] saw blood spot running down their feet
[1:44:13] and I saw the horn of skin and it
[1:44:16] revealed something. Uh, it moves
[1:44:18] something within me. Uh, it's got to be
[1:44:21] blood. Hallelujah. And now the bloody
[1:44:25] word speak on your behalf.
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You still with me?
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; So he said
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; no more
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; there is no more higher order to reveal
[1:44:47] the word than a prophet.
[1:44:53] So the signifying angel is a prophet.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; But the only way the prophet can be a
[1:45:00] vindicated is by the word.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And remember the third pull was the
[1:45:07] opening of the word.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; So if the third pull is the opening of
[1:45:13] the word,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; why why don't you want me to say it?
[1:45:19] What? What's your problem?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; What is your problem?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; What's your problem?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to hide something from
[1:45:27] me?
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Are you trying to take my redemptive
[1:45:30] blessing?
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; If the third pull is a opening of the
[1:45:34] word
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; and if the word's not open, then all
[1:45:37] creation go is lost.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; The reveal hidden truth
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; that being sealed
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; in the word.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; So the third pull
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; one the opening of the word.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Secondly,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; ministering to the eternally lost.

[1:46:31] prophet.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Then what did the prophet say?

[1:46:46] open.

[1:47:46] must set in.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So what is holding back the tribulation?
[1:47:50] You.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; And God is waiting on some of you that
[1:47:56] are lazy and slotful and refuse to pray.

[1:49:11] sir.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; We're not just comfortable in our
[1:49:14] church.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; But I tell you,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I I travel some distance by myself.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Flight to New York.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; 14 and 1/2 hours to Dubai. Where you
[1:49:26] going? I'm going down into East Africa.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Prophesy.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; To prophesy.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I left Kala drive 9 hours into Kamasi,
[1:49:40] Kenya, way into the jungle. And when we
[1:49:42] drove up, the brother come to the door
[1:49:44] and said, "They are singing the song.
[1:49:46] They're ready for you to preach
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; sacrifice."
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an urge in this
[1:49:53] hour.
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:56] Not just that they hear the voice of the
[1:50:00] seventh angel, but that the revelation
[1:50:03] of the word
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; comes to the bride.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And we're going from country to country.
[1:50:13] going back to our people to make sure
[1:50:17] because you remember down in Egypt
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; when they had to put the blood and the
[1:50:21] lintil on the doorpost
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Daddy, are you sure
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; that you're preaching the opening of the
[1:50:30] word?
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] You see, when the lost soul received the
[1:50:42] message, the door of salvation will be
[1:50:44] closed.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; The bride will still be here for a
[1:50:50] little while.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; You know why you're going to be here for
[1:50:54] a little while?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Because those saints that has gone on in
[1:50:58] the regions
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; of the dead,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; you got to wait on them
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; because they've got to gather with their
[1:51:06] people.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Because when a brother or sister from
[1:51:12] the assemblers pass,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; you have not lost a member,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; you've gained a witness
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; on the other side.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; And in that dimension, they're seeing
[1:51:24] clearer than you are seeing here. And
[1:51:26] from the porters, they're crying out to
[1:51:28] you. Just hold on a little bit more. A
[1:51:31] little bit more.
[1:51:37] Amen.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And they're waiting on us to bring that
[1:51:42] revelation.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; To material.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; What What do you mean by that? You you
[1:51:52] you remember Eleaza coming with Rebecca
[1:51:54] on the way.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And she never see Isaac.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; She didn't know what he looks like. But
[1:52:02] as Eleaza tell her about him, the words
[1:52:06] of Eleaza was materializing in her body.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; When she come out on the plane and she
[1:52:14] look out and you see that man standing
[1:52:16] at the door of the tent, Eleaza never
[1:52:18] had to say anything more because the
[1:52:21] words of Eleaza have materialized in her
[1:52:24] body. Hallelujah. And she lighted from
[1:52:27] the camel. That's what the message is
[1:52:30] doing to you and I today. It's bringing
[1:52:32] the revelation of Jesus Christ back to
[1:52:34] material.
[1:52:36] Hallelujah.
[1:52:38] That you are sick. You don't come to
[1:52:40] church crying, pastor, pray for me.
[1:52:43] Because he that is preaching to you is
[1:52:45] in you.
[1:52:52] If the word be preached to you not
[1:52:56] materializing in the body of Jesus
[1:52:58] Christ, you're wasting your time.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; It's preaching your position. It's
[1:53:07] telling you authority. It letting you
[1:53:09] know where you stand. It's putting you
[1:53:11] in position.
[1:53:13] It's giving you your purpose. And nobody
[1:53:17] can take your place. And you can't take
[1:53:20] nobody place.
[1:53:22] Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] Glory to God. My my my
[1:53:30] glory.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; They can't take your place. You can't
[1:53:42] take their place. He's a w. But nobody
[1:53:45] can shut you out of it.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; It's a rat.
[1:53:51] [Applause]
[1:53:53] Hallelujah.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; He said they will reject the third pull.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Then Revelation 22:11, he that is
[1:54:01] Hallelujah unjust, let him be unjust
[1:54:03] still.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; He which is filthy, let him be filthy
[1:54:07] still. He that is righteous, let him be
[1:54:10] righteous still. And he that is holy,
[1:54:13] let him be holy still.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Things that are to be. And I believe
[1:54:20] that the same thing we live in today,
[1:54:24] God bearing record of his word by
[1:54:27] vindicating what he said to do,
[1:54:29] hallelujah, he would do. Now we know
[1:54:32] that this is a day of salvation where
[1:54:34] God is calling men, amen, from the
[1:54:37] world, amen, from a life of sin unto a
[1:54:40] life of service. And in the day that God
[1:54:43] has poured out his his spirit from on
[1:54:46] high, great signs and wonders are
[1:54:48] accompanying the ministry of this day.
[1:54:52] This is when the former and the latter
[1:54:54] rain falling together.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that there is supposed to
[1:54:59] be a great sign and wonder which in many
[1:55:02] great denomination it is turn down.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. that they're turning it down.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; But we thank God for revelation.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; It may be almost past feeling time
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; because there will come a time like when
[1:55:24] the spirit of God will be withdrawn from
[1:55:26] the earth. There will be no more. The
[1:55:30] church will remain a while. And that's
[1:55:32] right. Preaching. Amen. because it has
[1:55:34] to preach uh to the eternally lost. Uh
[1:55:37] just as every ministry did coming down
[1:55:40] through the age. The last part of every
[1:55:42] ministry preach to the eternally lost.
[1:55:46] And there will be a ministry now that
[1:55:48] will preach to the eternal lost after
[1:55:50] they have refused to receive it to
[1:55:53] receive what? The revelation of Jesus
[1:55:55] Christ.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Then it look at Noah's message.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he locked the heart the
[1:56:04] door of the ark, it stayed for a little
[1:56:06] while. Is that where we are today?
[1:56:10] Hallelujah. Amen. Could it be that the
[1:56:13] days are over? Amen. And those that are
[1:56:16] in are in Sodom and Gomorrah. Jesus
[1:56:18] refer to both of them coming before the
[1:56:21] coming of the son of man. So shall it be
[1:56:23] like in Noah's day. So shall it be like
[1:56:25] hallelujah. In the days of Sodom, Noah
[1:56:28] had three pulls.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it third was the last. Amen.
[1:56:33] After the door was shut, for God let it
[1:56:36] sit there. Right there. Amen. Where
[1:56:39] nobody could enter or go out. Amen. They
[1:56:42] were inside. For Amen. On the seventh
[1:56:45] mountain. Amen. The highest mountain.
[1:56:47] Amen. That's where he settled the ark.
[1:56:50] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first pull was h the righteous
[1:56:59] Lot. Amen. Sin of Sodom vex his
[1:57:03] righteous soul. Hallelujah. Now then the
[1:57:06] woman acted. Hallelujah. And done. You
[1:57:08] remember as it was in the days of Noah.
[1:57:11] Amen. What was they doing? Heating,
[1:57:14] drinking, marrying, giving in marriage.
[1:57:16] Women see women. Amen. That was it in
[1:57:18] that day. Sodom. The first message was
[1:57:22] Lot. Hallelujah. Then laugh him to
[1:57:24] scorn. Amen. They sent another
[1:57:26] messenger. Two of them. Amen. And they
[1:57:29] went down. And it was his second pull.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; But look at the one that went last.
[1:57:36] Hallelujah. There was more and more
[1:57:38] mercy.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was all over then. All
[1:57:42] over at that time, the third messenger
[1:57:45] that went down there. Amen. The third
[1:57:47] pull. Amen. What was he? Amen. What kind
[1:57:50] of ministry did he have? He sent with

[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. What time is it? Hallelujah.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "What if it is?" Look at
[1:58:32] the scripture Paul in here. Could it be
[1:58:35] his third pull to preach to the
[1:58:38] eternally doomed that's rejected the
[1:58:40] message of salvation?
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And brethren, may I say this?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; The land of demarcation is so close.
[1:58:54] Right.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Look at the last pope
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; and and I was listening to his message,
[1:59:02] his opening message that he preached
[1:59:03] when Hallelujah. when he when he
[1:59:06] accepted that position
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and he was talking about the wise and
[1:59:11] the foolish virgins.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; He was talking about harvest time.
[1:59:17] And if I didn't know this message, I
[1:59:20] could not reject the things that he
[1:59:23] said.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Then it started to come to me. It said
[1:59:27] the two will be so close together.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; How could you reject that message?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; It is so close.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Mama, and I was saying to myself, I I
[1:59:43] wonder if he's reading brother
[1:59:45] Brandham's message. Could
[1:59:51] it be that he's reading the message?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. And he knows exactly the
[1:59:58] words to say.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; But I thank God the elect cannot be
[2:00:02] deceived.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Because she is the word.

[2:00:38] now with political Israel and the
[2:00:41] Orthodox Israel. Because if you're not

[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; you can't pray for Israel because of the
[2:00:48] atrocities
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; that is going on.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? But you look, not
[2:00:55] all Israel is Israel. There's a

[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, the politics of
[2:01:20] the day take you over. But our prophet
[2:01:24] says, Hallelujah. The politics of every
[2:01:27] nation is of the devil.
[2:01:33] Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Not some nation. Every nation. I don't
[2:01:38] care whether you're Republican or

[2:02:08] he went towards Shinoi. But you know the
[2:02:11] the Hallelujah the boundaries of Sodom
[2:02:14] has expanded and Lot was drawn into it.

[2:03:42] not right.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We stand for the cross of Jesus
[2:03:46] Christ.

[2:03:55] spoken word,
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; the demonstration and exercising of the
[2:04:00] power of the word.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I update your experience. God's not
[2:04:08] dead.
[2:04:09] [Applause]
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "If you ain't got
[2:04:14] faith for divine healing, oh, you're
[2:04:15] going to have faith for the change of
[2:04:17] the body."
[2:04:19] [Applause]
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; When the word is restored to you, the
[2:04:24] power is also restored.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Why you crying? Speak and move on
[2:04:32] forward.

[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; And anything in his plan, he will do.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You see, it's a time, the same
[2:04:58] time that the door was closed that the
[2:05:02] fullness of the third pull would be go
[2:05:05] in full effect.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is just laying dormant for and
[2:05:10] waiting for the squeeze to come in.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; And brethren, I tell you what,
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; if what we're seeing today is not
[2:05:18] bringing on a squeeze,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; nations are breaking,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Israel awaking,
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; the signs that the prophet foretold,
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; the whole nation is nervous.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; The whole world
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; is in turmoil.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:36] But there's something happening within
[2:05:38] the bride.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I said there's something happening
[2:05:40] within the bride.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; This is the third pull.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and he said, "Amen." He
[2:05:48] said, "This is the third pull used in a
[2:05:52] greater way in the time of persecution,
[2:05:54] the squeeze, the hour of temptation of
[2:05:57] the bride."
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The antichrist, brother, the
[2:06:02] the the pontiff, the pope
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; of Rome. the the the pap say Iraqi who
[2:06:08] at this time has gone take control now
[2:06:12] hallelujah amen and is in the seat it's
[2:06:15] a monopoly brother I was driving with
[2:06:18] the brother he was praying the tape he
[2:06:20] didn't know why I was going to preach
[2:06:21] and I hear brother screaming he said
[2:06:23] listen communism will never rule the
[2:06:25] worldism
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; government politics one world government
[2:06:33] religion one world religion, the
[2:06:36] commerce, and when the pope come on the
[2:06:38] scene, he was calling all the religion
[2:06:42] together.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; And brother, he had such a charm
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; when he did it.
[2:06:48] I
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; if listen, if I didn't know this
[2:06:51] message, I'd want to be a Catholic
[2:06:53] today.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; But he said the two will be so close
[2:06:56] together.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; For you know what they miss? The
[2:07:00] revelation of Jesus Christ. That
[2:07:03] doctrine of the Trinity
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; is alive from the pit of hell.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; And and you know the mark how they judge
[2:07:11] a church whether or not it's a cult.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; They judge if you stand with the
[2:07:14] Trinity.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't believe in the Holy
[2:07:19] Trinity,
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; you're a cult.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's what they use.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; That very lie that they've made
[2:07:27] themselves. But hear me, O Israel, the
[2:07:31] Lord your God
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; is one Lord.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 4, he said, "And I
[2:07:40] see one sat on the throne." That's
[2:07:42] right.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And he that was to look upon as a Sardis
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; and Jasper Stone, it was Reuben and
[2:07:51] Benjamin,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; the first and the last. And the covenant
[2:07:56] of the rainbow
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; was round about the throne.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; You know, after the flood, the rainbow
[2:08:02] was halfway.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when it was caught up in
[2:08:06] Revelation 4:1, the rainbow was around
[2:08:09] the throne, showing that the covenant
[2:08:11] was complete.
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And he said in the sight like an
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; emerald.
[2:08:22] Emerald,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Judah,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Judah,
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; for out of Judah shall rise.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Christ.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. These symbols in the
[2:08:35] book.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Now, at this time, he's in charge
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; to actualize his new world order.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; And that's what they're setting out to
[2:08:46] do.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Which he is right now with cunning and
[2:08:50] deceit. Amen. Like a serpent is kissing
[2:08:55] the feet of the mos, accepting every
[2:08:58] road as the access to heaven to gain
[2:09:02] control of government, religion,
[2:09:04] commerce.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible say you won't be able to
[2:09:07] buy or sell. Hallelujah. Amen. That you
[2:09:10] can't buy or sell unless hallelujah. You
[2:09:12] are part of the league.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That beast, a satanic organization
[2:09:18] under Rome. That's right. Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; The Pope, this guy, Amen, is a con man.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; He take the very words of the bride.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; The very words that listen, if they come
[2:09:31] with Pentecost again, the Pentecost
[2:09:34] today, they'll never catch us. We we
[2:09:36] long past that.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; But he's speaking the very language.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; There it is, my dear.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what the serpent did to
[2:09:45] Heave.
[2:09:48] He begin to speak the same language.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Did not God said.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; It took the very quote.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; It took the very quote
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; did not God said amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; But then he come to a conclusion. You
[2:10:11] will not surely die.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. You You got to be careful
[2:10:16] now.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; You catch the true revelation of it.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. I'm coming down.
[2:10:27] He said, "Hallelujah. Amen. Stop the
[2:10:30] bride,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; the true church, the elect lady, the
[2:10:33] wise virgin. They're trying, they're
[2:10:36] going to try to stop you from
[2:10:37] fellowshipping around the world and
[2:10:39] denying her of her form." Hallelujah.
[2:10:42] Amen. Yeah.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; A great hour of problem indeed
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; for the elected bride.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; It is the hour of temptation.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, maybe there
[2:10:53] comes a day when you can't meet here
[2:10:54] like this.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; But when the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:10:57] is in your heart,
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter if we come together
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; because wherever you are,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; God is.
[2:11:09] That's why we take pleasure in the time
[2:11:11] that we have now to come together
[2:11:14] because a time is coming when we might
[2:11:16] not be able to come together
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; but let them bring it on.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Let them bring it on because there are
[2:11:22] some people almost everywhere whose
[2:11:25] lives are all a flame
[2:11:27] [Applause]
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; with the fire
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; that fell at Pentecost.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's some preacher over
[2:11:37] the land. There's some young men that
[2:11:39] are rising up with a fire of God.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; And defying all odds with the revelation
[2:11:44] of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; We will not back down.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; We will not give up.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will declare it
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; no matter what they do because we know
[2:11:57] who we have believed in. And we're
[2:11:59] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[2:12:03] which we have committed unto him against
[2:12:05] that day.
[2:12:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; There is a bride in the land.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; The sons of God
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; are manifesting on the face of the
[2:12:21] earth.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The baptism of the Holy
[2:12:24] Ghost, the adoption, the placing of the
[2:12:26] son. Amen. By the message, hallelujah.
[2:12:29] of the seventh star that we've had in
[2:12:31] our day.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 3 and 4, the seven
[2:12:35] thunders are being declared.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The mysteries contained
[2:12:40] under the seventh seal.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Then listen now. There has been five
[2:12:45] witnesses of the spoken word third pull.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; In the signifying angels ministry.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; So that we've got vindication.
[2:12:58] Question and answer. 1964, brother
[2:12:59] Brandham said,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; We've got Amen. Vindication.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a true vindication in
[2:13:11] this hour.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; We've got revelation.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Now, so hallelujah. Five straight signs
[2:13:21] without failure.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; In the life of the signifying angel.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; That the third pull brings salvation.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; At Wright, two boys.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the first time it
[2:13:37] operate upon a human being.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; When at right hear the word of God,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; she cried out. That's nothing but the
[2:13:44] truth.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Salvation is in the third pull.
[2:13:56] and and you've got some unsaved
[2:13:57] children.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, salvation is in the
[2:14:00] third pull.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Why you giving up on your children?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; He said he'll save you with your
[2:14:08] children.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Salvation is in it.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; The the boys were unsaved. But attempt
[2:14:17] [Applause]
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:28] pull is manifested in healing. That's
[2:14:30] right.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; When sister media had that tumor.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; And the word speak before the doctor's
[2:14:37] knife touch you.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; The tumor will be gone. Do you believe?
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe?
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; At Easter, I was there in Kala and I was
[2:14:52] going to preach the second message and
[2:14:54] they sent me a note and and I remember
[2:14:56] the brother's name. I will always
[2:14:57] remember it because at the bottom he
[2:14:59] signed his name, Isaac Newton. I can't
[2:15:03] forget that name. I'm an engineer, you
[2:15:06] know, so I I remember that name. But he
[2:15:08] he said he was in a motor vehicle
[2:15:10] accident and he was like in the back and
[2:15:13] he he flew through the front windscreen.
[2:15:16] Break it and he fall on his head and he
[2:15:19] has a brain concussion and um he just
[2:15:22] can't function anymore.
[2:15:24] But he said something tell him that when
[2:15:27] I come to Uganda to have me pray for him
[2:15:29] and everything would be all right.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; That that's what he said. Amen.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Took the note and I put it in my pocket
[2:15:36] and when I went I I tell him I said
[2:15:38] after you know I've got this note after
[2:15:40] I'm through preaching I'm going to pray
[2:15:41] for this young man Isaac Newton. So when
[2:15:44] I was through I gave brother Gideon and
[2:15:46] he read it and the young man came
[2:15:48] forward and and I went listen I believe
[2:15:51] God my God is a healer.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; and I held him by the head and I prayed
[2:15:59] for him.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; That was Friday afternoon. Saturday
[2:16:02] morning I left at six o'clock and I went
[2:16:04] over to Kenya to the other convention
[2:16:06] and while I was there they sent me the
[2:16:08] video. The brother came the following
[2:16:10] day in the meeting and was testifying.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; He said in that dream that he had the
[2:16:16] same place that I placed my hand I put
[2:16:18] my hand exactly there and he said all
[2:16:20] the concussion and everything that he
[2:16:22] had it's gone.
[2:16:30] My God is a healer.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; And and I tell you, sometimes we are
[2:16:38] afraid to speak God's word.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; But but that's our inheritance.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; When the word is restored, everything is
[2:16:50] restored.
[2:16:51] Yes sir.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; The turpple speaks of resurrection.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; You you remember the little fish.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; And if God care about the little fish,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; The little fish was brought back to
[2:17:09] life.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; For in the third pull is resurrection.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; In the third pull is dominion.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brand was caught in
[2:17:17] that storm and he speak to the storm.
[2:17:20] That's right.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; And you know why? Because the storms of
[2:17:22] your life tonight,
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; you can speak to your storm.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what your storm is.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; It's a family problem.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; It's your job. You You've got problems
[2:17:37] on the job.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; You've got problem with your finances.

[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; speak to your storm.
[2:17:47] the the economy is going bad and the job
[2:17:50] is drying up. Speak to your storm
[2:17:54] because God give you the authority to do
[2:17:56] it. Hallelujah.
[2:17:59] Do you believe? Do you believe? Do you
[2:18:02] believe? Seven Thunder give you faith
[2:18:05] that it's God's will for your life.
[2:18:08] [Music]
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] [Applause]
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in the third pull there
[2:18:17] was creation.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon Monting there was no
[2:18:21] game.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; He speak the scrolls into existence.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; That is just for the seventh angel
[2:18:31] messenger.
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; It is for the bride.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Listen. God is going to do things in
[2:18:46] your life
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; that is going to be difficult for you to
[2:18:50] come to church and to talk about it
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; because who is going to believe your
[2:18:55] report
[2:18:57] [Applause]
[2:18:59] [Music]
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; who is going to believe your report
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; but it's a sacred between you and God
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; he said the third pull will not be a
[2:19:13] public
[2:19:14] But that which you stand in need of, God
[2:19:18] sovereignly provided it.
[2:19:21] Yes, sir.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Brother, I want a message.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; That put me into it.
[2:19:32] [Applause]
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; If it's all on the seventh angel
[2:19:35] messenger, then what about me?
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; He was not the object of this message.
[2:19:41] No,
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; John had to take the book.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; and when he take the book, he had to
[2:19:49] heed the book.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; And you are the final voice.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; For the final age.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; In the message shalom, as I finish, he
[2:20:04] said, "And we all know
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; that's the identification." Yes, sir.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; We know what the third pull is.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; We all We all understand that now.
[2:20:15] You've got you'll you'll have the tape.
[2:20:18] See, and I think it'll just lay dormant
[2:20:21] for a little while
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; until the great hour of persecution
[2:20:25] comes on.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; That's when it will be.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will speak.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; It will be manifested just like the five
[2:20:35] straight signs without failure.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. perfectly.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; And now I think just wait. See?
[2:20:41] Hallelujah. To see what it's done. Now
[2:20:44] I'm going back
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; the same again.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Through and through to find out.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is the musicians come now?
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to say something to you
[2:20:58] now.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; That I haven't said all along.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is that the thing
[2:21:05] that we've looked forward to for a long
[2:21:07] for so long
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; for at least many years, four or five
[2:21:11] years or maybe longer, the third pull
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; now was being vindicated. And I'm sure
[2:21:17] you all know what it is.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now remember, remember this
[2:21:23] now. You'll never be there. It will
[2:21:26] never be impersonated of that cuz it
[2:21:29] can't be.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Mm- No. I am I I was warned of this
[2:21:35] right at the time now. It's just
[2:21:37] happened. So it could identify its
[2:21:40] presence among you, but it will not be
[2:21:43] used in a great way until the council
[2:21:46] begin to tighten up. And when it does,
[2:21:49] hallelujah,
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[2:21:52] impersonate anything that we've that's
[2:21:55] been done. But when that time comes,
[2:21:57] when the squeeze comes down, then you'll
[2:22:00] see what you're seeing temporarily being
[2:22:03] manifested in the fullness of its power.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; And so, as I close in the Philadelphia
[2:22:16] age, he says, I also will keep thee from
[2:22:19] the hour of temptation. That's right.
[2:22:22] which shall come upon all the world to
[2:22:24] try them that dwell upon the earth.
[2:22:26] That's right.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Revelation 3:10.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. This verse is not to a declaration
[2:22:32] that the church will go in or through
[2:22:35] tribulation.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it meant that, it would
[2:22:39] have said that.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; It will keep thee from the hour of
[2:22:42] temptation. This temptation is exactly
[2:22:45] like the temptation in Eden.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It will be a very inviting
[2:22:51] proposition held up in direct opposition
[2:22:55] to God's commanded word.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Watch it, church.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; And yet from the standpoint of human
[2:23:02] reasoning, it will be so very right.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; From human reasoning,
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; in other words, if you ask your
[2:23:14] neighbor, it's a right thing.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Correct? If you ask those beside, it's a
[2:23:18] right thing
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; from human reasoning, it looks so very
[2:23:22] right.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; So enlightening and lifegiving as to
[2:23:30] fool the world. Only the very elect will
[2:23:34] not be fooled.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; The temptation will come as follow. The
[2:23:39] ecumenical move that has started on what
[2:23:42] seems such a beautiful and blessed
[2:23:45] principle fulfilling Christ that we all
[2:23:48] might be one
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; become so strong politically
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; that she bears pressure upon the
[2:23:57] government to cause all to join with her
[2:24:01] either directly or through adherance to
[2:24:04] the principle enacted into law.
[2:24:09] So that no people will be recognized as
[2:24:12] actual churches unless under
[2:24:17] direct or indirect dominion
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; of this council.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Little group
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Little groups will lose their charter.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Privileges.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Etc.
[2:24:34] until they lose all property and
[2:24:36] spiritual rights with the people. For
[2:24:39] example, the right now unless a local
[2:24:41] ministeral association approved in many
[2:24:44] if not most cities, one cannot rent a
[2:24:47] building for religious services to
[2:24:49] become a chaplain in the armed forces,
[2:24:51] hospital etc. It is now almost mandatory
[2:24:55] to be recognized as ac as accepted to
[2:25:00] the trinitarian ecumenical group. As
[2:25:03] this pressure increase, and it will
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; it will be harder to resist,
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; for to resist is to lose privilege.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; And so many will be tempted to go along.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; So many,
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; so many,
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; let's just accept it and have church.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; That's what they'll say.
[2:25:28] For they will feel it is better to serve
[2:25:30] God publicly in the framework of this
[2:25:34] organization than not to serve God at
[2:25:36] all publicly.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; But they hear
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; they here
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; to believe the devil's lie is to serve
[2:25:46] Satan.
[2:25:47] [Applause]
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Even though you might want to call him
[2:25:52] Jehovah,
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; but the elect will not be deceived.
[2:25:58] [Applause]
[2:26:03] Hallelujah.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; The ministry of the signifying angel.
[2:26:06] Listen. Furthermore, the elect will not
[2:26:09] only be kept,
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; but as this move becomes the image
[2:26:14] erected to the beast, the saints will be
[2:26:17] gone in the rapture.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Bye-bye.
[2:26:26] Bye-bye. Let the squeeze come.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going home.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; And this little delightful,
[2:26:34] winsome movement that started out in
[2:26:36] fellowship as Ephesus will become the
[2:26:40] monstr of Satan that defy and deceive
[2:26:43] the whole world. For the church system
[2:26:46] of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant
[2:26:49] is coming together will control the
[2:26:51] whole wealth of the world system and
[2:26:54] force the whole earth into its religious
[2:26:57] trap
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; or will kill them
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; by refusing them the privilege of buying
[2:27:02] or selling whereby they would make a
[2:27:05] living.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; This will be accomplished simply for the
[2:27:08] harlot's daughter are all but gone
[2:27:13] back to her. That's right.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; In the meantime, Rome has acquired
[2:27:17] nearly all the supplies of gold. The
[2:27:21] Jews have the bonds and all the paper.
[2:27:24] At the right time, the harlot will
[2:27:26] destroy the present day money system by
[2:27:29] calling in all the paper and demanding
[2:27:32] gold.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; With no gold, the system will fail.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; The Jews will be trapped and come into
[2:27:39] an alliance and the Harlot church will
[2:27:42] take over the whole world.
[2:27:44] It's coming brethren.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; And everyone know that for as certain as
[2:27:51] the first was identified,
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; so as the second being identified.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; And if you will think real closely, you
[2:27:59] will you who are spiritual, as the Bible
[2:28:02] said, here is the him that has wisdom,
[2:28:05] the third is properly identified.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; We know where it is. So the third pull
[2:28:12] is here.
[2:28:14] Glory to God.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; It is so sacred that I must stay so much
[2:28:23] say so much about it.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; As he told me in the beginning said
[2:28:29] this, say nothing of it.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; You remember that years ago?
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; It speaks for itself.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I've tried to explain the others and
[2:28:40] I've made mistake. This will be the
[2:28:42] thing that in my opinion I don't say the
[2:28:45] Lord tell me this. This will be a thing
[2:28:49] that will start the rapturing fate for
[2:28:51] the going away.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; This will be the thing.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here.
[2:29:13] [Applause]
[2:29:19] Hallelujah.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; I must lay quiet for a little while.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Now remember, and who is listening to
[2:29:29] this tape,
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; you might see much a ch a change in my
[2:29:34] ministry right away. Dropping back. Not
[2:29:36] going up, dropping back. We are right at
[2:29:39] the age now
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; and it can't be can't go any further.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; We have to wait
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; just a minute until this happen over
[2:29:49] here
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; to catch up.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Then the time comes.
[2:29:54] If we never meet again
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; on this earth, my precious friend,
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; if to God you have been true
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; and have lived above all sin,
[2:30:10] then for us there'll be a meeting. They
[2:30:14] can't take us from that. God bless you.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[2:30:20] God bless you.
[2:30:25] [Applause]
[2:30:27] The ministry of the signifying angel is
[2:30:30] complete
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; and all we've got to do is to believe.
[2:30:36] Everything that we need to the rapture
[2:30:38] is here. God bless you. God bless you,
[2:30:40] my brother.
[2:30:42] [Applause]
[2:30:42] [Music]
[2:30:52] Wonderful. Praise God.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, brother Ke.
[2:31:00] Praise God. Praise God. What a message.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Ke, Wednesday is our convention.

[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; my brother. This was loaded,
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; my sister. This is loaded. Go home and
[2:31:23] review this again.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; God spoke to you. Amen.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; You in the right.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; You are where the opening of the seals
[2:31:33] are.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; The momentum is changing. The season is
[2:31:37] changing. Everything is changing. And
[2:31:40] God is bringing a new energy
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; that is pushing for last time
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; so we can go into the rapture.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; The only thing that make a difference
[2:31:52] between us and denomination is the
[2:31:53] seals.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Because when the seals open up, then the
[2:31:57] Bible changes.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; The way we read the Bible,
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; the way we look at the Bible, the think
[2:32:03] we see in the Bible is completely
[2:32:05] different than denomination.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; Until you sit down, you talk to somebody
[2:32:09] and they look at you, they say, "Where
[2:32:11] did you learn theology?"
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; I didn't learn theology. It is the
[2:32:16] message of the hour.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said to my
[2:32:20] opinion it is not the lord telling me
[2:32:22] you remember Paul saying this is not the
[2:32:24] lord this is me and it's written in the
[2:32:26] bible
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; and the bible say every scripture is
[2:32:29] inspired
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; so even the opinion of Paul was inspired
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; and brotherham say I preach like Paul
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:32:39] you need to read between the lines
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; it is not an opinion it is god's word
[2:32:47] for us
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; Speak to your storm.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Speak to your trouble.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; God is bringing everything back in
[2:33:00] order.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; And I praise God for elders like this
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; that are standing for the word and that
[2:33:07] are pushing. This is not going to be
[2:33:09] easy, but you got to stand for it
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; because God will hold you accountable of
[2:33:15] what he open up or revealed to you.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; The other person didn't understand that
[2:33:22] didn't see it. It's a different story.
[2:33:23] But you saw it.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; But if you saw it, you walk away from
[2:33:26] it.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Once you see it, you are doomed.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; You must stay with it
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; because God actually showing you mercy
[2:33:35] and grace to move on. Amen.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; There is nothing difficult for this
[2:33:40] brother. God have given us the devil's
[2:33:44] answer. This sermon is prophetic.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; The third pool is here.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; The third pool is here.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, it's
[2:33:59] here.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; But if you can believe like a simple
[2:34:02] child,
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; when God declared that it's here,
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; go to school. When they calling for
[2:34:08] food, go straight to the food table.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Go get your food because it's been paid
[2:34:14] for.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; It's been spoken.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; The third pool is here.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
