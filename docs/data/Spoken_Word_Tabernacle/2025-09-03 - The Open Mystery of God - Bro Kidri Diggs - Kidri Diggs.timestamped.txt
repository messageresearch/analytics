[0:00] What if the doctor comes to your house
[0:02] before daylight?
[0:03] &gt;&gt; He takes your pulse,
[0:08] moves back, said, "No, he'll never come
[0:10] out of that one. He's done." Oh, how you
[0:13] wish you'd have put that hand up. It
[0:16] might have meant something.
[0:18] Then pray for me, brother. I don't know
[0:21] who you are unless you let me know.
[0:23] Church don't know who you are. Or if you
[0:25] raise up your hand, God will recognize
[0:27] that. That won't save you. No, but it'll
[0:30] give you that much of a start.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; It'll give you that much start. Then
[0:34] maybe before the revival's over, you'll
[0:36] give your heart to Christ.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Now, this has been rough tonight. We'll
[0:40] try to get down and more into solid down
[0:42] into the word in the beginning. I mean,
[0:45] as we go on, is there one more? It's
[0:46] been five. Raise your hand. Somebody
[0:48] else could have had just six or seven. I
[0:50] I want you to be honest. God bless you,
[0:52] young lady. Now, I know there's one more
[0:55] person in here that should have your
[0:56] hand up. Now, just put your hand up.
[0:58] Say, "Brother Bill, pray for me. I'm not
[1:01] coming back to where you are. I'm going
[1:02] to pray for you right here." And then
[1:04] just say, "Remember me now." And I am
[1:07] not a Christian, but I've always felt
[1:09] that I should be. And I I know I'm not a
[1:12] Christian. Is there another one now? Put
[1:14] your hand up. I'm fixing to close. Get
[1:16] to the piano, Teddy, if you will.
[1:18] Someone say, "Brother Bill, remember me
[1:21] that my life will be closer to God. I I
[1:24] don't want to be live this halfway life,
[1:26] this lukewarm condition. I want to
[1:28] really my heart be burning on fire. Pray
[1:31] for me. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:34] Heal you. That's fine. That's good. God
[1:37] bless you. I see your hands going up.
[1:39] Look, if God will hear my prayer to open
[1:42] the eyes of the blind,
[1:45] unstopp the ears of the deaf.
[1:48] Make those who are crippled,
[1:50] congressman, kings, potent takes,
[1:52] monarchs, cripples, just straighten out.
[1:55] Look around the world.
[1:57] Millions.
[1:59] Millions. I'd visually say this with
[2:02] true from my heart.

[8:14] Father, may you take my side, Lord. May
[8:16] you speak your word, Lord Jesus, to your
[8:18] bride, oh God, this evening. Those on
[8:20] your way coming, Lord, and your hands,
[8:22] Lord, we ask for a protection, Lord, on
[8:24] the road, Lord. And those who couldn't
[8:27] make it tonight are in your hands, oh
[8:28] God. Those not feeling well, oh God. We
[8:30] ask, Father, for a touch in their
[8:32] bodies, Lord Jesus. Oh God, those who've
[8:34] traveled, Lord Jesus, we ask for
[8:36] traveling mercies, Lord. May take
[8:37] absolute control, God. We thank you,
[8:40] Lord, and we bless your name. We give
[8:42] you all the glory. In Jesus Christ's

[50:14] God's grace, we are there.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; It's just a season.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; The flu has a season.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; It's just a season. It will pass by and
[50:25] before you know it, we're still riding.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; But one of this day will be the last day
[50:32] &gt;&gt; any sickness will have to deal with this
[50:34] body. Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Why? We we we will be transformed and
[50:38] changed.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; In a moment,
[50:41] &gt;&gt; in a twinkling of an eye,
[50:43] &gt;&gt; never to be sick again.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say it's like a mist
[50:48] that will come up out of us and going
[50:50] back to hell.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; We will get to the the one day. Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We greet you all in the precious
[50:59] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[51:02] both visible and invisible audience.
[51:05] Amen. Any family member here, God bless
[51:08] you and new subscriber online, God
[51:10] richly bless you and welcome to Spoken
[51:13] Word Tabernacle and on Wednesday when we
[51:16] have our convention. Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Now we begin to understand taking
[51:20] advantage of the season.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't God wonderful to us?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew these things years ago.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; It would have saved us a whole lot. But
[51:33] there is a season for everything.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the season have come. So God
[51:38] can open up all those things for us to
[51:41] free because you shall know the truth.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; And when you know the truth, you cannot
[51:46] stay like that.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; The truth has a power to set you free.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; How can the creator go out of season to
[51:55] look for fruit?
[51:58] When David already said the fruit coming
[52:00] season,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; what is the what is going on behind
[52:03] that?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; It's a powerful thought.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And if we all can catch it by God's
[52:10] grace will transform our life.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Let's be wise like wise virgin. Not
[52:17] looking at today but look a little bit
[52:19] further away. You will see God far away
[52:22] somewhere there. Amen.
[52:24] So you are preparing for something that
[52:26] is way up there. And guess what? God
[52:29] came exactly at midnight.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; How did they know God come? That is the
[52:34] expression of wisdom to them.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; So wisdom
[52:39] was not determined because they were
[52:41] virgin.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Because all of them were virgin.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; If you look at both of them were virgin.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Both of them have lamp.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Both side have oil in the lamp
[52:56] that didn't determine wisdom. What made
[52:58] the other wise is the ability to foresee
[53:04] &gt;&gt; far away and prepare
[53:08] &gt;&gt; for the oncoming sen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And probably at that time they were not
[53:15] called really wise.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; All right, we talk about it on Sunday.
[53:21] Amen. Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Wisdom was called when actually the the
[53:27] the event happened
[53:31] &gt;&gt; then somebody will begin to call you a
[53:33] wise man
[53:34] &gt;&gt; or a wise woman
[53:36] &gt;&gt; when you were working they didn't see
[53:37] the wisdom
[53:39] &gt;&gt; but when wisdom begin to work then
[53:41] somebody turn again and say how did you
[53:44] know this
[53:47] &gt;&gt; that's where wisdom is declared amen
[53:50] &gt;&gt; amen Both of them have the same
[53:53] opportunity. And as a matter of fact,
[53:55] both of them slumber.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Both of them slumber and slept.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; In other word, everything
[54:11] happened to everybody.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; But there is a difference.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; All right, we take that on. I'm not
[54:21] preaching tonight.
[54:23] Tonight is a convention. By God's grace,
[54:26] you pray for Sister Sharon. She's
[54:28] already in a flight. She's taking flight
[54:32] by herself. By God's grace, one of this
[54:34] day there will come a season.
[54:38] Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Anyway,
[54:42] they call me they they invited me to a
[54:45] wedding and the wedding is on a Friday
[54:48] in the middle of everything that I'm
[54:50] going through right now. And it's a it's
[54:52] a young lady. I knew her. She's a
[54:54] dentist now. She graduated. She's a
[54:56] dentist. She's a she's a message
[54:57] believer, a dentist. She even came all
[54:59] over to the United States and came and
[55:01] shadow me. So, by God's grace, she's
[55:04] getting married. So the parent insisted
[55:06] but I could not with everything that I'm
[55:08] going through right now I can't move. So
[55:10] sister Sharon have to take a flight. So
[55:12] there is a season
[55:15] &gt;&gt; that sister Sharon is traveling alone
[55:19] and there will come a season. Amen. So
[55:22] you be yes sir. Amen. So you bear with
[55:26] me. It's just a season. It's a zone.
[55:29] Amen. Do you know when uh I'm sorry but
[55:33] I have to explain this because church is
[55:36] a family to me. This is my family. The
[55:38] people God's gave me the precious people
[55:41] and I need to really uh uh take care of
[55:45] you. Very good. Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; You know when uh you are in a war
[55:50] military people soldier understand this
[55:53] and if there is a building there and you
[55:55] are in the building here you cannot just
[55:57] cross if the enemy is over there.
[56:00] because you don't know where the enemy
[56:01] is as you crossing in between the two
[56:04] building you can get shot.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; So what they usually do the one that
[56:08] stays behind cover for you.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; So he keep the the machine gun
[56:13] &gt;&gt; going on
[56:15] &gt;&gt; because as long as they shoot the enemy
[56:17] will still duck.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; If they stop shooting then the enemy
[56:21] comes and see who is crossing and shoot
[56:22] you. So one need to stay there and keep
[56:25] shooting and firing to keep the enemy
[56:28] busy and then while the other one is
[56:30] crossing.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So sometime I have to stay here
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and I have to stay there with a machine
[56:36] gun
[56:37] &gt;&gt; while everybody else is crossing.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And when you cross you will
[56:44] see me coming ahead and following and
[56:47] joining you on the other side. But at
[56:49] this time I have to stay with a machine
[56:51] gun left and right because uh the devil
[56:54] is upset
[56:56] &gt;&gt; for everything that people are getting
[56:58] delivered without
[57:00] laying hand.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; So you cannot say brother Steven lay
[57:03] hand on me. No no no the word is laying
[57:05] hand on you. The word
[57:09] brother Brandham say one of this day it
[57:11] won't be the laying on hand of the
[57:13] presitter
[57:14] &gt;&gt; or or an elder. It will be the Holy
[57:16] Ghost himself
[57:18] &gt;&gt; laying hand on you.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I send my word so that the word can heal
[57:22] you.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the Saraphene
[57:25] Phoenician woman.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; What did she say? She spoke the right
[57:29] thing.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And that's it. Nobody lay hand. Her
[57:32] daughter was way far away somewhere.
[57:35] Just like the Roman centurion, the
[57:36] servant was way far away. Say you don't
[57:39] have to come over here.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to trespass again
[57:43] &gt;&gt; and speak the word.
[57:45] Amen. And brother Greg sent me something
[57:47] I didn't know. I spoke it here under
[57:49] inspiration. Brother Greg sent me
[57:51] something that shows that the only time
[57:53] in the ministry of Jesus Christ that he
[57:55] went outside of the border was in that
[57:58] time.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I just spoke what came to me and I
[58:02] didn't know it was written in the Bible.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody put a note there and brother
[58:06] Greg took a screenshot and send it to
[58:08] me.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; There's a season. There's a time.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all is well. Brother Steven
[58:15] love to travel but at this time I have
[58:18] to stay on the machine gun
[58:20] &gt;&gt; and keep the enemy busy when all of you
[58:22] are getting married and uh all the stuff
[58:26] coming in and I'm still shooting over
[58:28] there. And you say but Stephen, you
[58:30] don't move. No, I'm I'm shooting over
[58:31] there. My life is prayer in a car,
[58:33] prayer, cleaning teeth, prayer, pulling
[58:36] teeth, prayer. So constantly meditating
[58:39] because I want to see somebody blessed
[58:41] and delivered. So tonight I'm not
[58:43] preaching. It's brother Dicks who's
[58:45] preaching tonight.
[58:47] [Applause]
[58:50] I told him we love him. He's home and
[58:53] he's going to preach like home and we're
[58:55] going to pull like home and get
[58:57] something from the word of the Lord
[58:59] tonight. Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Only believe.

[1:01:04] Lord tonight?

[1:01:22] Let's just have a word of prayer and

[1:01:34] you for the goodness, Lord. The grace
[1:01:35] that you've given us, Father. And we say
[1:01:38] it so often, Lord. But Lord, if it
[1:01:40] wasn't for your grace, where would we
[1:01:42] be, Lord? What would happen to us, Lord?
[1:01:46] But it's the grace of God that we're
[1:01:48] here, Lord. And father, we just want to
[1:01:50] take full advantage of that grace, Lord
[1:01:53] God. Living in your presence, Lord. And

[1:01:58] your voice, Lord, and knowing that the
[1:02:00] hands of the pot are on our lives, Lord,
[1:02:02] and you're controlling every move. And
[1:02:05] Lord, we pray, Father, you would just be
[1:02:08] with us through the through the rest of

[1:02:50] to the dispensation of God, which is
[1:02:53] given to me for you."
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the word of God.

[1:04:15] open.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Notice the book is not closed.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; The book is open.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; So when he gave the book, it wasn't a
[1:04:23] closed book.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; It was an open book.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; So anything that our prophet preached,
[1:04:30] it was already open.
[1:04:34] So you can't say he left the scene with
[1:04:37] a mystery clothes.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; He said he had in his hand a little book
[1:04:48] open.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the seat.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And his left foot upon the earth.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord a bless reading of
[1:04:58] his word. You can have your seats.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. By the grace of God, today I want
[1:05:05] to use for a subject
[1:05:08] the open mystery of God.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; The open mystery of God.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, church, we ought to feel
[1:05:16] privileged tonight.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Because when it comes because we're the
[1:05:21] seed of Abraham.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; It all started with with with Abraham.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. you know, and what God has
[1:05:28] been dealing with me. He's been I've
[1:05:30] been looking into the seventh seal,
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; you know, and and many people say
[1:05:35] nothing is is is in there.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; That's because they don't know God.
[1:05:39] Hallelujah.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And they don't understand the voice.
[1:05:43] Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Of the one that came. Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; But I'm not the judge. I'm just I'm just
[1:05:48] going by what God has revealed to me.
[1:05:50] But you know, even the prophet of God
[1:05:52] will say that the seals were revealed
[1:05:56] back in Genesis.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now church, you look and and
[1:06:01] you you think about who we are.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; God told Are we Abraham's seed?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; God told Abraham, Hallelujah. After his
[1:06:09] trial, he said, Abraham, there will be
[1:06:12] nothing that I'll hide from you.
[1:06:15] meaning that everything that needed to
[1:06:17] be revealed, it was revealed in
[1:06:20] Abraham's walk.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And as he walked with God, every door
[1:06:26] that was closed be to open. Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] Because he had stood the test of time.
[1:06:32] He showed that God was more important
[1:06:34] than anything else. So God said, "You
[1:06:37] know what, Abraham? I'm not going to
[1:06:38] hide anything from you
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; or your seed.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah. But you know you when we
[1:06:48] when we think about the mystery of God,
[1:06:50] you know the open mystery of God. I
[1:06:52] ain't going to be long by the grace of
[1:06:53] God, but the open mystery of God, we
[1:06:56] just take those two words.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Before we go to open, let's deal with
[1:07:01] mystery.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Now, what is a mystery? A mystery is
[1:07:04] something that's hidden.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; It's a secret. Hallelujah. You know,
[1:07:08] it's it's it's something when you think
[1:07:10] about the Bible, it's something that has
[1:07:12] to be divinely revealed.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Your education ain't going to open the
[1:07:17] mystery. Hallelujah. What family you
[1:07:20] come out of ain't going to open the
[1:07:22] mystery. This has to come from God and
[1:07:25] God alone. But let me say something to
[1:07:28] you. Hallelujah. If the seed of God is
[1:07:30] in you as the mystery is being spoken to
[1:07:33] you because you are a seed of God,
[1:07:36] something will begin to unlock
[1:07:43] the word will unlock who God is unto his
[1:07:49] bride. But but but the thing of the
[1:07:51] mystery, hallelujah, he said,
[1:07:53] hallelujah, that when the seventh angel
[1:07:56] begin to sound,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God will be finished.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; That means it's no longer locked up.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That means it's no longer closed. We
[1:08:08] should be able to see exactly what the
[1:08:11] mystery is.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you think about
[1:08:15] something that's open. Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Take your mind.
[1:08:19] Glory.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; If you say hallelujah.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; The open mystery of God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Let's just say that.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Spoken word tabernacle was a
[1:08:30] mystery. Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And you Hallelujah. Let's just say
[1:08:35] somebody say, I want to I want to go to
[1:08:37] spoken word tabernacle. They come to the
[1:08:39] church,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; but the doors ain't open.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; So what's on the inside is still a
[1:08:44] mystery.
[1:08:47] They looking at the building. They in
[1:08:50] the right place, but they don't know
[1:08:52] what's on the inside because the doors
[1:08:54] are closed. But once they get in the
[1:08:58] inside, the mystery of everything that
[1:09:01] goes with this church begins to be open.
[1:09:04] Hal, it begins to be unveiled. You can
[1:09:07] see with your natural eyes. There are
[1:09:09] some things inside the church because
[1:09:11] the doors are open. You can touch it.
[1:09:14] That's right.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can possess it.
[1:09:17] Hallelujah. You can sit down with it.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. And it can be more than just
[1:09:22] one person. Hallelujah. Because it's not
[1:09:24] just open to one. It wasn't just open to
[1:09:26] William Brandham, but it was open to a
[1:09:28] bride.
[1:09:33] Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] But church, as I begin to think about,
[1:09:37] hallelujah,
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; the opening of the seals, as God be to
[1:09:42] come and and the the first horse rider,
[1:09:45] we know these things, the first horse
[1:09:47] rider started to ride and you know,
[1:09:49] hallelujah, the prophet said that before
[1:09:53] God spoke to him, he was going to say
[1:09:56] that that was God
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; because he was thinking thinking as a
[1:10:04] man.
[1:10:06] If you're thinking as a man, you'll
[1:10:09] never be able to see God for who he is.
[1:10:12] But then he said he prayed. He sat
[1:10:14] still. And then God came. Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] And God unlocked the mystery of the
[1:10:21] first seal. Hallelujah.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But what I want you to see, church,
[1:10:24] hallelujah, the first seal was a mystery
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; and the prophet didn't unlock it. Who
[1:10:30] unlocked it in?
[1:10:34] who unlocked the mystery of it.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; It's very clear in the Bible.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; the Bible says in in Revelation 10:1,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; it says, hallelujah.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; come down from heaven clothed.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with with a cloud
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; and his face was as the sun and his feet
[1:11:01] as the pillar of fire
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; and in his hand he in and and he had in
[1:11:06] his hand a little book open.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And he sat Hallelujah. one foot upon the
[1:11:12] sea.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; One foot upon the earth.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the prophet of God
[1:11:17] said that that was God.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; That was the covenant angel.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But as we read church on
[1:11:25] down a little bit more, verse three said
[1:11:28] uh uh let's go to verse verse uh four.
[1:11:33] Verse four, it says, "And
[1:11:36] with seven thunders he uttered his
[1:11:38] voice." No, I want to back up. I want to
[1:11:40] back up. Let's go to verse three.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It says that he cried with a loud voice
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; as when a lion rose.
[1:11:52] So we look at this mighty angel
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; when he came down. Yes, sir.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't speak like a regular man.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he roar
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; like a lion.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Now we know that the covenant angel,
[1:12:06] hallelujah, is the complete angel.
[1:12:09] Hallelujah. He is the seventh angel.
[1:12:12] Hallelujah. So the seventh angel came to
[1:12:15] open the first seal. Hallelujah. cuz he
[1:12:18] roared just like a lion. And what met
[1:12:21] that white horse rider? It was a lion
[1:12:24] anointing. Hallelujah. So church, it was
[1:12:28] Christ. Hallelujah. Opening the first
[1:12:30] seal, the second seal, third seal,
[1:12:33] fourth seal. So how could the Sabbath
[1:12:36] ever be closed if the first Hudson seal
[1:12:38] was open by the Sabbath? Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] If nobody can open it but Christ.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my church. Church look when he came.
[1:12:55] He came with the roar of a lion.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And we know Hallelujah. through a
[1:12:59] vindication of a prophet. He said that.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. That was God sending an
[1:13:04] anointing to combat false teaching.
[1:13:09] Yes, sir.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He sent an anointing. Hallelujah. He set
[1:13:13] the book open
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; that we will be taught right
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; in this end time with so much going on.
[1:13:20] We needed a word that has sustaining
[1:13:23] power
[1:13:25] cuz there will be a lot of things taking
[1:13:27] place. And you see church, hallelujah.
[1:13:30] Listen what he said. He said the first
[1:13:33] beast of God that he went out to meet
[1:13:37] the antichrist the the antichrist spirit
[1:13:40] when it just his teaching. Now remember
[1:13:44] when the antichrist first rose he was in
[1:13:47] teaching ministry
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and the antichrist rode first in a
[1:13:51] teaching ministry. Now watch the one
[1:13:55] that went to meet him. Hallelujah. the
[1:13:58] lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:14:02] which is the word.
[1:14:04] Now, we look at this covenant angel
[1:14:06] right here in Revelations 10. What is he
[1:14:09] coming down with?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; The word. He has a book open.
[1:14:14] Hallelujah. A word book. Hallelujah.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, my church. And as he comes down, he
[1:14:22] gives the book to the seventh angel.
[1:14:25] Open.
[1:14:29] So the mystery of God lies within the
[1:14:32] teachings of that prophet.
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's why people can't find their place
[1:14:42] cuz they want to put a prophet on the
[1:14:44] shelf. Hallelujah. But God sent a
[1:14:47] prophet with an open book. Hallelujah.
[1:14:49] So that we wouldn't be Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] tossed to and fro. Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] But church,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; look,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; we can see clearly. Hallelujah. Well,
[1:15:05] some people say, "Well, the service
[1:15:07] still ain't open because the prophet
[1:15:09] didn't say anything."
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:15:14] remember it is an open mystery.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; They were looking for a beast to speak,
[1:15:21] but the seven seal is a person.
[1:15:25] is not a beast.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the prophet
[1:15:32] of God said when Jesus Christ came down,
[1:15:35] he restored everything that Adam was.
[1:15:38] Why? Because it was person to person. So
[1:15:41] God had to use a person for a person.
[1:15:44] Hallelujah. So God came down in Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ opening up everything that was
[1:15:49] closed. And what did he do? He gave it
[1:15:51] to the people.
[1:15:53] So the mystery of God, hallelujah, now
[1:15:56] revealed in Jesus Christ is where? In
[1:15:59] the people.
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my lovely church.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Listen. Hope y'all don't mind me reading
[1:16:10] a little bit.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Listen. He says, "But God's great
[1:16:15] mystery."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. What the eternal God had as a
[1:16:20] mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus
[1:16:23] Christ.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Has anybody got the Holy Ghost?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, about about four people raised their
[1:16:32] hand.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is very important.
[1:16:44] Because the Holy Spirit, hallelujah, is
[1:16:47] the unfolding of Christ in your life.
[1:16:51] Christ taking away the mystery of who
[1:16:55] you are. See, this is the key. Nobody
[1:16:58] knows who bride is. The only thing that
[1:17:02] reveals her is her life.
[1:17:07] It ain't her church. Hallelujah. It
[1:17:10] ain't where she come from. is the life
[1:17:12] inside reveals the mystery of the seed.
[1:17:17] Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; "You know what?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Let me go back a little bit."
[1:17:30] He said, "And he had in his hand a
[1:17:32] little book open,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; and he set his he set his right foot
[1:17:36] upon the sea, and his left foot upon the
[1:17:38] earth, and he cried with a loud voice as
[1:17:41] when a lion roared. And when he had
[1:17:44] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[1:17:46] voices." The seven thunders have already
[1:17:49] sounded when this angel came down.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I ain't waiting on eighth thunder.
[1:18:00] I ain't waiting on the eighth angel.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Everything was manifested between the
[1:18:05] mighty angel and the seventh angel on
[1:18:08] earth. Not in heaven, on earth. It took
[1:18:13] place on earth because there had to be a
[1:18:16] transforming of the book. Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] The book came from God to the prophet
[1:18:22] and then the prophet handed it to
[1:18:24] somebody.
[1:18:30] everything. The book was what? A book of
[1:18:33] life.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; The last book of life. Hurry. So the
[1:18:37] mighty angel gave her the prophet Hurah
[1:18:41] a book of his life.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the then the
[1:18:50] seventh angel took this very same book
[1:18:52] that was open
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; and gave it to a people.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Not a closed book,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; but an open book.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; And this book, hallelujah, testifies and
[1:19:03] demonstrates the life of the mighty
[1:19:05] angel.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet would say, "My
[1:19:10] Bible has become a new book."
[1:19:15] What was it? It was the revelation.
[1:19:18] Hallelujah. It was the revealing of
[1:19:20] Christ. Hallelujah. That had nothing to
[1:19:22] do with a beast sounding. It had to do
[1:19:24] with a stepping into
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; listen church.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I heard a voice from
[1:19:37] heaven saying unto me, seal up those
[1:19:39] things which the seven thunders uttered
[1:19:41] and write them not. And the angel,
[1:19:44] hallelujah, which I saw stand upon the
[1:19:46] sea and upon the earth, lifted up his
[1:19:48] hands to heaven and swear by,
[1:19:50] hallelujah, and swear by him that
[1:19:52] liveth, hallelujah, forever and ever.
[1:19:55] There we go again. Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Where was the uh the the the first place
[1:19:59] you hear God swear by himself
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; back with Abraham?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham couldn't do it on his own.
[1:20:12] Abraham couldn't live the life on his
[1:20:14] own. Abraham couldn't produce the life.
[1:20:17] So God said, Abraham, because I could
[1:20:20] swear by no mother, I'm going to swear
[1:20:22] by myself that you are and will forever
[1:20:26] be the father of faith.
[1:20:31] And you possess the game of your enemy
[1:20:34] and your seed after you.
[1:20:40] We still in Genesis.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; I thought he didn't say nothing in
[1:20:44] Revelation.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; I thought he didn't say nothing about
[1:20:50] the seal in Revelation.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my church. What I love about
[1:21:00] this, the prophet would always say,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; "You can't add nothing to it.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; It has to already be in there.
[1:21:10] It has to already be in there. You can't
[1:21:12] add nothing to it. You can't take
[1:21:13] nothing away. It has to already be in
[1:21:15] there.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; But what's but what's catching people?
[1:21:22] Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; What's stopping them when it comes to
[1:21:24] the revealing of the seventh?
[1:21:26] Hallelujah. Well, they say the Bible
[1:21:28] says it was silence in heaven
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; for the space of a half hour.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] And people look at the silence and say,
[1:21:39] "Well, God never said anything."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet will come back and
[1:21:45] say, "Hey, it's not a public show."
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Then he come back and he say, God told
[1:21:51] him, "Meet me in there."
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; In a quiet place,
[1:22:01] Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh my church. Church,
[1:22:06] let me keep going. Yes, sir.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Listen. See, it's all in the Bible. The
[1:22:10] mystery of God has been finished.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing of it is is, see,
[1:22:16] I'm to a place, brother Shimbo, I'm not
[1:22:19] looking for little things anymore.
[1:22:21] Uh-huh.
[1:22:23] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I'm stepping out there at the prank.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Looking at the sharks saying, "I'll walk
[1:22:31] on top of you
[1:22:33] cuz I wasn't created to sinkh.
[1:22:36] I was created to walk on water." So,
[1:22:39] church, brother, think of it is.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah. We look at circumstances and
[1:22:43] we put God, hallelujah, below our
[1:22:46] circumstance.
[1:22:49] We go to prayer. Hallelujah. And we
[1:22:51] spend 15 minutes talking about how the
[1:22:53] devil is fighting.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, the devil this. Oh Lord, the
[1:23:03] devil in my children. Oh Lord, the devil
[1:23:07] on my job. Oh Lord, give me strength to
[1:23:10] fight the devil.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Who you praying to?
[1:23:17] Are you praying to the mighty one? Are
[1:23:20] you praying to the mighty angel?
[1:23:24] If you praying to God, you ought to
[1:23:26] acknowledge him first.
[1:23:34] If I can help it, I don't even mention
[1:23:37] the devil when I'm praying.
[1:23:41] I don't even call his name. I don't even
[1:23:44] talk about him. The prophet of God said
[1:23:48] prayer, hallelujah, is a relationship.
[1:23:51] He said prayer is you talking to God and
[1:23:54] God talking back. So you tell me what
[1:23:57] place does the devil have in your
[1:24:00] conversation with God?
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] What place does the devil have in your
[1:24:07] conversation with God in your prayer
[1:24:10] room?
[1:24:18] He said, "The Lord want to do it.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; The Lord want to do even more than we
[1:24:22] want." Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; But we go into prayer with, "Oh, Lord,
[1:24:26] the devil does, the devil that." Don't
[1:24:28] you realize God created the devil.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And all he is is a tool in God's hands.
[1:24:36] God tell him, listen to us now. God
[1:24:39] tells the devil
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; how to test you.
[1:24:47] He don't have his own trials for you.
[1:24:50] Those trials are ordained by God.
[1:24:56] Satan before he does anything, he has to
[1:24:59] go to God and say, "Can I do this?
[1:25:05] Can I do this?"
[1:25:07] And if he try to conspire something for
[1:25:09] your downfall, God won't give him
[1:25:12] permission.
[1:25:13] Cuz you know why? His word says he'll
[1:25:16] put no more on you than you can bear.
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:20] So let me say right now, if you going
[1:25:22] through is for your good.
[1:25:26] If you're going through E, it's just to
[1:25:28] make you stronger.
[1:25:31] If you're going through E, it's just to
[1:25:33] show the devil who you are.
[1:25:51] See, the mystery
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; behind you and I
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; is Satan don't know what's in our heart.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; He'll see you make mistakes. He'll see
[1:26:01] you say the wrong thing.
[1:26:04] But he'll know if there's repentance in
[1:26:06] there.
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; See, it's like David. I love David.
[1:26:14] David fought battles. David had
[1:26:17] mistakes, but David always repented.
[1:26:20] Why? Because the mystery behind David
[1:26:23] was he was a man after God's very own
[1:26:25] heart.
[1:26:28] He told a lie man out of God's very own
[1:26:30] heart. We can't meditate and murder
[1:26:34] God's very own heart. Adultery never.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; What was it? See, the way to please God,
[1:26:50] the mystery was open to David. See, it
[1:26:53] wasn't something that was closed. David
[1:26:56] knew all he had to do was repent.
[1:27:07] Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; God has a mystery has now been unfolded
[1:27:15] in Jesus Christ. Then given right down
[1:27:19] to his church.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I got it."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] What was once in God's mind is now in
[1:27:30] the body of Christ. Think about that,
[1:27:32] church. He say what was in God's mind is
[1:27:37] now in the body of Christ. So that means
[1:27:40] there are no more secrets.
[1:27:43] [Applause]
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; That mean the way to heaven has been
[1:27:48] revealed.
[1:27:50] That means healing is revealed. That
[1:27:54] means, hallelujah, joy is revealed.
[1:27:57] Every attribute of God is now revealed
[1:28:00] in the body of Christ because we're not
[1:28:03] living in mystery form anymore.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Oh my.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Why did God
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; reveal himself to you?
[1:28:22] Why did God hallelujah took away the
[1:28:25] blinders?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Took the barricades off the
[1:28:29] door
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and then stepped inside.
[1:28:34] Lord,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet says Jesus making love to
[1:28:39] the church.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; His bride whispering secrets to her.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah. See church was being
[1:28:52] revealed to us the Baptist know nothing
[1:28:55] about.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; What was it? God making love.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; What was it? See, everybody can't come
[1:29:04] in that chamber.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Only him and his wife.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And you know if the devil is fighting
[1:29:10] you, hurry. If you made it in that
[1:29:12] chamber, he got to take you with all
[1:29:14] your flaws.
[1:29:19] If you make it to that table, he can't
[1:29:21] give you back.
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Well, let's go back to Genesis.
[1:29:28] Hallelujah. Let's go back to Genesis.
[1:29:31] Remember, Jacob worked seven years for a
[1:29:34] woman. He worked seven years for a I
[1:29:37] believe it was Rachel. Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] Rachel. The first one he wanted was
[1:29:41] Rachel. He worked seven years for a
[1:29:43] heart. It was no secret. Layman knew
[1:29:46] exactly who he wanted
[1:29:53] and he worked and he worked seven years.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Then they walked down the aisle.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah. Changed vows, did everything
[1:30:00] in their customs. Hallelujah. Jacob
[1:30:03] thought it was her. Then they got in the
[1:30:05] chamber. Hallelujah. and they start
[1:30:07] revealing themselves and she took off
[1:30:10] the veil and he said,
[1:30:14] "Why didn't he give her back?
[1:30:20] Why didn't he give her back?
[1:30:23] He couldn't because she hadn't already
[1:30:27] saw his secrets.
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:32] She had to saw the parts of him that no
[1:30:35] other woman had seen. Only a wife can
[1:30:38] see. If you understand what I'm talking
[1:30:40] about, they were in the bad chamber.
[1:30:43] Hallelujah. And she couldn't move out of
[1:30:45] there saying, "Hey, he don't want me,
[1:30:47] but I know all the secrets."
[1:30:52] That's why when you were grafted in, God
[1:30:54] couldn't give you back.
[1:30:57] No matter what happened, no matter what
[1:31:00] they say, we already saw a secret
[1:31:04] already. I don't know about you, but he
[1:31:07] injected the seed inside me.
[1:31:14] I got the seed inside me. He can't give
[1:31:17] me back. I'm with
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:21] Yes, sir.
[1:31:23] And God is not one to deny his own.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; So what did So what did God do? What did
[1:31:37] Jacob do? He worked seven more years.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And what you fail to realize,
[1:31:41] hallelujah, Leah was a part of Jacob's
[1:31:45] secret
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; because he had children of promise
[1:31:51] inside of her. Hallelujah. So what
[1:31:54] looked like was out of order was really
[1:31:56] an open door.
[1:32:09] No, it was God over Satan. It was God's
[1:32:13] secret being revealed. There was a
[1:32:16] Simeon. Hallelujah. There was a Levi.
[1:32:19] Hallelujah.
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:29] They were inside a real Rachel. So God
[1:32:33] hallelujah had to let the mystery be
[1:32:36] unveiled.
[1:32:40] What was it? It was an open mystery.
[1:32:45] This wasn't done in secret.
[1:32:50] You know why it had to be done in the
[1:32:53] open? So those kids couldn't be denied
[1:32:56] to their inheritance.
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:07] That's why God called us in a world like
[1:33:10] this today in front of everybody
[1:33:14] so our inheritance
[1:33:16] cannot be denied
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Jacob wonderful
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Jacob say you know what I'm going to
[1:33:32] I'mma keep working.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Rachel said, "You know what? He really
[1:33:36] loves me."
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to give him my hands made
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; another open mistress.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Another child came out of the hands
[1:33:44] made.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Say you want to fight like that. I'm
[1:33:48] going to give him my hands made.
[1:33:51] What looked like it was completely out
[1:33:53] of order was God straightening things up
[1:33:56] for the promise to come to pass. Because
[1:33:59] God, hallelujah, one thing he cannot do,
[1:34:02] God cannot tell a lie. He said your seed
[1:34:05] will be like the stars.
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And you look at it, church. Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; It looked like to everybody else that
[1:34:21] Leah should have kept silent.
[1:34:24] Yes, sir.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; She should have kept silent. Hallelujah.
[1:34:29] But it was the mighty one himself
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; doing that work in her life.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; So really church, I'm jumping ahead cuz
[1:34:36] I ain't going to be long. So really
[1:34:38] church, the breaking of the seventh seal
[1:34:40] is God stripping the silence off of your
[1:34:43] life.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The reason why it's still
[1:34:52] silent to some people because they're
[1:34:54] still bound in sin. But you give me
[1:34:57] anybody who knows they're redeemed.
[1:35:00] Yes, sir.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You give me anybody that knows they're
[1:35:04] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:35:11] [Applause]
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[1:35:19] Yes, sir.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; See what looks like.
[1:35:25] See, we have to be careful
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; that we don't make the message a
[1:35:30] doctrine.
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And you just can't live the dos and
[1:35:46] don'ts. Hallelujah. And be unhappy and
[1:35:48] all this stuff. No.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That's not the revelation.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; The revelation is a lifestyle.
[1:35:55] Hallelujah. Remember when David messed
[1:35:57] up and did all he what was the mystery?
[1:35:59] Hallelujah. David in his greatest trial
[1:36:02] of his life. Hallelujah. He wasn't
[1:36:04] questioning whether God was real.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It was in his walk.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, restore unto me
[1:36:14] the joy of my salvation."
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what catches people.
[1:36:20] Hallelujah. Well, sometimes you want to
[1:36:22] know why you are not where you're
[1:36:24] supposed to be. Well, let's unlock that
[1:36:26] mystery. It's because you don't have the
[1:36:28] joy you're supposed to have.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; If you're going through something, if
[1:36:38] there's no joy, Dad, it's easy for the
[1:36:41] devil to sweep you by the wayside.
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] Even
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Christ's joy was questioned
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; when he was going
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; to be crucified.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord,
[1:36:59] oh Lord, take this thing from me, Lord."
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; See, it was heavy.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; But what overpowered that?
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; It was the mystery of his will.
[1:37:11] Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And when you catch the mystery of his
[1:37:15] will for your life, it'll restore the
[1:37:18] joy that you can go through what you're
[1:37:21] supposed to go through.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Look.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look, church. He gave his life.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; See, that that's how the enemy fights.
[1:37:36] The enemy wants you to be coming to
[1:37:38] church with no joy.
[1:37:41] sitting by your husband mad
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; cuz y'all had a fight before you got to
[1:37:46] church.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And you going to come in here and not
[1:37:49] clap, don't do nothing. Stay at him.
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; You think God don't know what you going
[1:38:06] through?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; You know that sound. Hallelujah. When
[1:38:10] there used to be something on the
[1:38:11] television. Hallelujah. And then
[1:38:17] this is only a test.
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:23] It's coming back clear again. Right now
[1:38:26] it's just a little bit of blood li. But
[1:38:28] it ain't going to last forever. That
[1:38:31] picture going to come back clear again.
[1:38:33] Hallelujah. You just got to sit still.
[1:38:35] Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] Because when it comes back clear, it
[1:38:40] picks back up exactly where it left off.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, they they try they trying to act
[1:38:48] like they don't know what I'm talking
[1:38:49] about on the TV.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; let me let me let me encourage you a
[1:39:01] little bit. Honey, remember when it
[1:39:04] comes to trials and tribulations,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Satan was minding his own business.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; But he but he wanted to go to church.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That's his thing. He want to be where
[1:39:16] the people of God are.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; That's the only place he can be used.
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; He ain't worried about the ones he got.
[1:39:28] He want the ones that's resisting him
[1:39:30] cuz that's when he feel good about
[1:39:32] himself.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But church, what he does is he watch
[1:39:35] you, he study you, he come to church.
[1:39:37] Hallelujah. He follow you down 85 doing
[1:39:39] a rush hour.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; It's too much traffic. You might as well
[1:39:46] turn around, go back home, stream the
[1:39:48] service tonight.
[1:39:54] That's for those of you who stayed home.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You know you was on your way, but then
[1:39:58] the enemy gave you some reason.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is open.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; But church, what did he do? He went
[1:40:11] there. He said, "Hey,
[1:40:13] God said, "Hey, Satan, what you doing?"
[1:40:16] The look look, let me say this. God is
[1:40:21] never on defense.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; If you if if if he's on defense, that
[1:40:31] mean he doesn't know Satan's move.
[1:40:34] [Applause]
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; But God knows all things.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; For Satan to get by God, God lets him go
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; because who he is. But in the spirit,
[1:40:48] every time he moved, God was like,
[1:40:54] "Where you think you going?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; You can only go where I tell you to go."
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And church, God is never on the defense.
[1:41:04] He's always on the offense. Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] And Satan is always on the defense. You
[1:41:10] know why? Because he has to see
[1:41:12] something to pervert it. Right.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; God is the creator. Hallelujah. So
[1:41:17] there's nothing that Satan can do that
[1:41:19] gets God's attention.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he calls. He say, "Hey,
[1:41:26] what you doing in church?" He said, "I'm
[1:41:28] just walking to and fro trying to get
[1:41:29] somebody to mess up somebody life."
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Hey, have you considered
[1:41:35] my servant Job?" Amen.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; he begins to have a I love to say this,
[1:41:42] a testimony service about Job.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; He said there's nothing like him in all
[1:41:48] the earth.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; He's a righteous man.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; He obscured from evil.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He never even looked at a young maiden
[1:41:56] wrong.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Have you considered him
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; perfect?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Now listen to Satan.
[1:42:04] Even he knows
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; there's an open mystery.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; He looks at Job.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And the God says that to him, "Have you
[1:42:16] considered my servant Job?"
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Satan says,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; "Yes,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; but you protect everything about him.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; His house is blessed. His kids are
[1:42:27] blessed. His cattle is blessed.
[1:42:29] Everything about him is blessed." Listen
[1:42:32] to the devil testify about Job just like
[1:42:34] God did.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; So, Satan knew he was untouchable.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And God's children are still the same
[1:42:43] tonight.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Still untouchable.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Look church, listen what he says.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit always speaks the
[1:42:58] word. I've got many things to tell you.
[1:43:01] You cannot understand it now. But when
[1:43:04] he comes, he'll guide you to it.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the coming of those
[1:43:10] seals.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; At the finishing of the seventh seal,
[1:43:19] the mystery of God should be finished to
[1:43:22] know. Hallelujah. What is it all about?
[1:43:26] to know
[1:43:28] who God is.
[1:43:33] Now, I'm going to say it again. Are the
[1:43:34] seals open?
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; If they're open, we should know who God
[1:43:37] is.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Without faith, it is
[1:43:43] impossible to please him. And God is a
[1:43:46] rewarder of those that diligently
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; listen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He saidh
[1:43:57] it should be finished to know who God
[1:43:59] is,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; what he is,
[1:44:02] how he lives,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; his nature, his being. You're supposed
[1:44:09] to be all the way up here by the time
[1:44:13] they're revealed.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; No more mysteries.
[1:44:22] We're supposed to know his nature,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; his being, who God is, what he is, how
[1:44:28] he lives. He said, "Hallelujah." See,
[1:44:31] bring us into the full statue, sons and
[1:44:34] daughters of God, a church that's washed
[1:44:37] in the blood of Christ. That's brought
[1:44:39] with that's that's brought without money
[1:44:42] is paid for by the blood of Jesus
[1:44:44] Christ.
[1:44:46] So church, when we think about the open
[1:44:48] mystery of God, it means that nothing
[1:44:51] about God is hid from us.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; I heard I heard the pastor say tonight
[1:45:00] that the flu is going around.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; We got the answer for the flu.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:07] That's right. That's right. Amen. That's
[1:45:10] right.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:45:14] We got the answer for the food. What is
[1:45:15] it? It's revealed in the mystery.
[1:45:19] Knowing who God is. Who is he? He's a
[1:45:21] healer.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; We got the answer.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; But the thing about it, church, we
[1:45:28] shouldn't be speaking to our sickness
[1:45:30] when we get it.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; You have the power to stop the enemy in
[1:45:38] his tracks
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; before he can even plant.
[1:45:43] Church, as soon as you feel a little
[1:45:45] scratched, hallelujah,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; you ought to say, "Fool, I bind you
[1:45:49] right now in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:45:52] Hallelujah. That's what's been revealed
[1:45:55] to us.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; It means, church, that when the prophet
[1:46:08] came, and I'm about to close, and get
[1:46:09] nervous. When the prophet came, he came
[1:46:12] with a book of food.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you a testimony of a
[1:46:19] sister in our church.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; She uh uh something wrong with her car
[1:46:24] and her car she'd go out and it and it
[1:46:26] wouldn't crank. She'd go out and it
[1:46:28] wouldn't crank. Go out, it wouldn't
[1:46:29] crank. She'd pray about it every time it
[1:46:31] crank up. Hallelujah.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And then one time she went out and it
[1:46:35] didn't crank. She said, "That's enough."
[1:46:37] So she called her husband said, "Hey,
[1:46:38] I'm going to AutoZone, wherever it was."
[1:46:40] She went there and they tested and say,
[1:46:43] "You need a new battery." Said, "Okay."
[1:46:45] So she called, she said, "I think I just
[1:46:47] bought a new battery. You know, my
[1:46:49] battery should be under warranty." So
[1:46:51] she called the people she bought the car
[1:46:52] from, the dealership, wherever. And she
[1:46:54] said, "Hey, I need another battery."
[1:46:56] They said, "Said, yeah, it's under
[1:46:58] warranty. Come on in and get it." So she
[1:47:00] gets there and the guy she was talking
[1:47:03] to on the phone, let's just say his name
[1:47:05] was Jack.
[1:47:06] Yeah,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; I can't remember his name. So, Jack
[1:47:10] sounds like a good name.
[1:47:12] So, let's just say his name was Jack.
[1:47:14] And she's standing at the counter with
[1:47:16] Jack and she says, "Hey, Jack, I'm the
[1:47:18] person who just talked to you." He says,
[1:47:20] "Okay, give me your invoice." She said,
[1:47:23] "You didn't say anything about an
[1:47:24] invoice. You told me it was on the
[1:47:27] warranty. Come on in." He said, "Well, I
[1:47:28] can't do nothing unless you got an
[1:47:29] invoice." She said, "You didn't tell me
[1:47:32] about no invoice.
[1:47:37] He says, "Well, I can't do nothing about
[1:47:39] it unless you show me an invoice." Man,
[1:47:42] you didn't tell me nothing about no
[1:47:44] invoice. Now she getting agitated.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Y'all know if the Holy Ghost don't help
[1:47:50] us, we'll show out.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Y'all know we'll show out bad
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; if the Holy Ghost ain't present.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And she start feeling it. See him and
[1:48:03] her going back and forth. He said,
[1:48:04] "Well, ma'am, I can't do nothing. All I
[1:48:05] can do is give you the warranty
[1:48:06] department." She said, "Give me the
[1:48:08] warranty department cuz you going to hit
[1:48:09] by me." So, she get the she get the
[1:48:11] warranty. She say she go in her car. She
[1:48:13] riding around in the parking lot.
[1:48:15] Stupid.
[1:48:18] Y'all know how we get sometime.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; She said she riding around on the phone
[1:48:24] waiting
[1:48:26] cuz they going to hear me waiting.
[1:48:29] Riding around in the parking lot
[1:48:30] waiting. She said, "God said, you prayed
[1:48:32] about it."
[1:48:34] She said, "Yeah, Lord, I done prayed
[1:48:35] about it." Said, "God said, pray again."
[1:48:38] So she prayed again. Still waiting. So
[1:48:41] she waiting. He said, the man told her,
[1:48:45] "Jack, before she went in the car, she
[1:48:48] said, "Hey," he said, "Check your glove
[1:48:49] compartment. It's probably in your glove
[1:48:50] compartment." She said, "Man, ain't
[1:48:51] nothing in my glove compartment." Said,
[1:48:53] "I don't put nothing in my glove." And
[1:48:55] if it's in my gug apartment, it probably
[1:48:57] got oil, all kind, it's probably tore
[1:48:59] all up, ragged it, all kind of stuff on
[1:49:01] it. But it ain't in there. She look
[1:49:03] nothing in there. So now she outside
[1:49:05] waiting on the people. God say he prayed
[1:49:07] about it. I said, so she prayed about
[1:49:09] it.
[1:49:11] Nothing.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all should have said amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes you pray and it's
[1:49:23] nothing.
[1:49:24] [Applause]
[1:49:28] God be want to see what you made of.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe, hallelujah, that the
[1:49:37] mystery is open, the mystery of the
[1:49:39] prayer?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; So now, hallelujah, God told her,
[1:49:44] hallelujah, and this may not be
[1:49:45] verbatim, but I'm giving you the gist of
[1:49:47] it. God told her the second time he say,
[1:49:50] "Pray about it and pray where you want
[1:49:52] it to be.
[1:50:02] [Applause]
[1:50:06] The mystery of God is finished. We ought
[1:50:10] not to be praying prayers all out in
[1:50:12] space.
[1:50:14] We need to say, "Lord, if you need
[1:50:16] $5,000, don't go to God talking about
[1:50:18] whatever your will is."
[1:50:22] That mean you don't believe
[1:50:25] before you pray you don't believe.
[1:50:28] You can't sight God out. E believe or
[1:50:32] you don't. It's either a fraud or a
[1:50:35] duke.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's either faith or doubt.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what we do, we try to be
[1:50:44] all spiritually correct with God. Lord,
[1:50:47] if it's your will, I need to be blessed
[1:50:50] with five times. Amen.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I don't pray like that.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; God got to tell me no.
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; He got to tell me no.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; I'm like Paul. I'm going keep coming
[1:51:11] back. I'mma keep coming back. He rather
[1:51:13] tell me go sit down. My grace is
[1:51:15] sufficient. Cuz I'm going to keep coming
[1:51:17] in prayer.
[1:51:19] Hallelujah. If I got to fast two times,
[1:51:21] three times, three weeks, four weeks,
[1:51:24] I'm going to do it until he until I hear
[1:51:26] yes or no. We're not in the day of
[1:51:30] assuming.
[1:51:37] I got something big right now I'm
[1:51:38] praying about.
[1:51:42] And I didn't spoke it.
[1:51:44] I didn't put it out. I done put it out
[1:51:46] there in church.
[1:51:48] I said, "Lord, I want a house with no
[1:51:51] payments."
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:52:00] Some of you will say stuff like that cuz
[1:52:02] you don't believe he can do it.
[1:52:05] Let me tell you something. I see him do
[1:52:08] it.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Amen.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God just want you to get in
[1:52:21] position.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He already got the blessing waiting on
[1:52:24] you.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Devil said, "Ah, y'all was selling that
[1:52:28] ministry all that time and look what
[1:52:30] happened. God had this blessing waiting
[1:52:32] on you.
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:35] God had the building waiting on you."
[1:52:39] Hallelujah. Church, I said, "Lord, I
[1:52:43] want a house with no payments.
[1:52:48] And let me tell you something.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about no sack.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about no tiny house.
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:53:07] Is it is it is it open or closed?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Has the mystery to God be revealed or
[1:53:13] not
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; But we won't step out there and put
[1:53:22] hallelujah our God on a pastor.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; But we sing that song. We serve a mighty
[1:53:28] big God.
[1:53:32] A very big God. Oh.
[1:53:40] But when it come to him doing big
[1:53:41] things, we try to act all super
[1:53:44] spiritual.
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And then we put this false humility.
[1:53:51] Lord, I don't need it. But if you want
[1:53:54] to bless me,
[1:53:56] you already told him you don't need it.
[1:53:58] So how you going to bless you?
[1:54:10] church.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:54:12] she said she prayed again
[1:54:15] and she said she felt the spirit of the
[1:54:17] Lord move in that car.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Lord, I want it in the
[1:54:23] glove compartment where she
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; where she looked before and it wasn't
[1:54:27] there."
[1:54:29] church.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; after she prayed,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; she opened up the the glove box.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Church, it was an invoice in there so
[1:54:39] spanking new
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; that thing was so white, so crispy, it
[1:54:45] looked like it just came out of a
[1:54:47] printer.
[1:54:55] And she told the testimony. I said, "God
[1:54:57] got ovens in hell in heaven forever. And
[1:55:01] God got brilli in
[1:55:07] church." She grabbed the invoice at the
[1:55:10] drug compartment. She went back in there
[1:55:12] say, "Where at?
[1:55:15] Where Jack at? I got my in.
[1:55:19] You can't tell me my God ain't great.
[1:55:22] You can't tell me my God ain't great.
[1:55:25] Take your ear voice
[1:55:27] as you testify to all the people about
[1:55:31] God creating ear voices.
[1:55:39] Church,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; we ought to know how to get something
[1:55:43] out of God.
[1:55:44] [Applause]
[1:55:47] He's open.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; This ain't a closed book.
[1:55:51] Hallelujah.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; There's a lot more I can say without
[1:55:57] feeling led.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; another sister in our church.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; They went down to Florida on vacation
[1:56:04] with the whole family and they've been
[1:56:05] itching to go with the family. So they
[1:56:07] finally went.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And they was doing something in the
[1:56:10] house playing a game or doing something
[1:56:12] and she ran into the wall and fell.
[1:56:15] Broke her arm in half.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Snapped the broke the bone in half. She
[1:56:20] went to the doctor down there. They
[1:56:22] said, "Oh, you got to have surgery.
[1:56:24] Emergency surgery." Said, "No, I ain't
[1:56:26] got no surgery down here. If I'm going
[1:56:27] to have surgery, I'm going to do when I
[1:56:28] get back home." They said, "Well, we
[1:56:30] going to wrap it up right now, but you
[1:56:32] need to go see a specialist or
[1:56:33] whatever." Before she left Florida, she
[1:56:36] said, "Lord,
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; let it be healed before I get back
[1:56:40] home."
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:48] See, some of us don't pray like that
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; cuz we got good insurance.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; So your faith don't step out. You're not
[1:57:03] willing to step out there. You got good
[1:57:05] Medicaid. You got good this, good that.
[1:57:08] All of it. Yes, sir. So you don't step
[1:57:10] out there. But what if you ain't got no
[1:57:12] insurance?
[1:57:15] What if you ain't got no bomb care?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Sister, they got home.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; She went back to the doctor. They did
[1:57:29] the X-ray. Doctor looked at her arm.
[1:57:33] He's like, "Whoa."
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; It was broke in two places when she
[1:57:38] left.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. When she got examined back in
[1:57:40] Columbus, doctor said, "Whoa,
[1:57:43] looks like somebody already worked on
[1:57:45] your arm.
[1:57:53] The book is open. The revelation to
[1:57:57] healing is in the
[1:58:01] church. All the doctor could do a soft
[1:58:04] gas on it.
[1:58:09] No operation, no nothing. Hallelujah,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; church. Hallelujah.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; See, we need to we need to step before
[1:58:16] God like there's nothing that he hasn't
[1:58:19] revealed to us.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Everything is open unto us. The mystery
[1:58:23] of God has been revealed. Amen. See, I I
[1:58:27] think about this before I close.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; "When you receive this word as eagle
[1:58:35] food,
[1:58:38] Amen.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; You have heard from your theophony.
[1:58:43] [Applause]
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all, but I'm eating
[1:58:47] egoful.
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to catch what has been
[1:58:53] taking place with us.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Our theophony, hallelujah,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; has come down to where we are.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; And before we know it, church, right
[1:59:03] now, what's happening? There's a
[1:59:05] blending taking place, a supernatural
[1:59:08] blending. And it's going to come a time
[1:59:11] when that theophony can no longer leave
[1:59:13] you.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet of God says.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now." Oh my. Oh my. I need
[1:59:31] to I got to Oh my. He said, "Look.
[1:59:35] Then after you recognize that every word
[1:59:37] of God
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; was eaglefooled, then you left the other
[1:59:42] things. You have then been formed into
[1:59:44] the living image of the living God.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; So do we understand what God has been
[1:59:52] doing through a message in our day?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Just like he came down with a book open,
[1:59:56] he gave it to a prophet. What was he
[1:59:58] doing? Now that we have the book, he's
[2:00:00] been forming us into the living image of
[2:00:04] the living God.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; You heard from your the
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; if this earthly body be dissolved, we
[2:00:17] have one waiting. You say, "Is that
[2:00:19] right, brother Brandon?" All right. He
[2:00:21] says, "All right, let's take a couple
[2:00:23] eagles and look at them." But let's drop
[2:00:25] down to this church. He says, "And now
[2:00:27] the logos that went out of God, which
[2:00:29] was the logos, hallelujah, all this be
[2:00:32] to form into a body shape."
[2:00:36] And this body shape was called,
[2:00:38] hallelujah, in the scholars teaching
[2:00:40] logos. The logos, hallelujah, went out
[2:00:42] to God. In other words, a better word
[2:00:45] for it was what we called a theophony.
[2:00:53] church. He says, "Oh my, not exactly
[2:00:57] with flesh,
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; but
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, not without flesh and blood
[2:01:03] like it will be it a glorified stage."
[2:01:08] Amen.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; So
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; if we have a theophony
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; and we've heard
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; from our theophony
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and we perceive this message
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; as eagle food.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Talk to me church.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; That means
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; you are already glorified.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the theophony is representation
[2:01:39] for heaven
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; and you've heard of your theophony,
[2:01:41] you're connected with your theophony,
[2:01:43] that means you've already been there.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; That means you have representation
[2:01:48] there.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; That means that you have a glorified
[2:01:52] body waiting to connect with you.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's what's been open unto us.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; We're not just church people.
[2:02:07] of God.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I look
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; I done told this testimony over and over
[2:02:14] again. I just can't stop it.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, mama.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; About my friend who ran out of gas.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Ran out of gas
[2:02:28] in the middle of nowhere.
[2:02:32] wife home sleep about 2 3:00 in the
[2:02:35] morning. He said, "What am I going to
[2:02:38] do?" Say he ain't want to call and wake
[2:02:40] up. He had just got off from work. What
[2:02:42] I'm going to do, church, sometimes all
[2:02:45] we got to do is sit still.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Because all you got to do is sit still
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; and the mystery
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; of what you should do next
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; will open up to you.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is sit there a little
[2:03:03] bit and think on God.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; He said he was on the side of the He
[2:03:07] said he was on the side of the car. He
[2:03:09] went to the trunk. He said, "I didn't
[2:03:11] even have a gas cap. I mean a gas jug."
[2:03:14] Like, man, what I'm going to do? Say,
[2:03:16] "Look in there. Ain't nothing back there
[2:03:17] but water.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Gallon of water. Yeah.
[2:03:24] Hallelujah.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; A thought came
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; was a scripture
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; where God turn water
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; into wine.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was opening up
[2:03:41] something.
[2:03:45] He said, "Lord,
[2:03:47] if you turn water into wine,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; you can turn water into gas."
[2:03:57] Church, he prayed a simple prayer. He
[2:04:00] didn't wait till the water changed
[2:04:02] colors. He didn't wait till the smell
[2:04:05] changed. He opened up the tank, pulled
[2:04:07] it in there, jumped in the car, drove
[2:04:09] all the way home.
[2:04:12] didn't need to stop at the gas station.
[2:04:20] Church, it's revealed to us. We ought to
[2:04:23] be able to bring God.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; It's too often
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We're testifying about what
[2:04:43] God did in Paul and Peter and John.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; We testify what he did in brother
[2:04:48] Brandham.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; He's still the same God.
[2:04:52] [Applause]
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; He still move the same way.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Church, my daughter, I was in Canada
[2:05:04] last week about two weeks. She called me
[2:05:08] at first I got there uh first Saturday I
[2:05:11] was there. She called me and said, "Dad,

[2:05:20] and rim
[2:05:22] airbag came out like what? What in the
[2:05:24] world were you?"
[2:05:28] She said, "I was on the phone with mama
[2:05:30] and this and that blah blah blah
[2:05:32] whatever." So they calling me I say what
[2:05:35] y'all want me to do? I know.

[2:06:01] the house.

[2:06:06] I'm feeling bad cuz I'm going to be the
[2:06:08] one who have to put out the most money.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Two rims, two tires.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Church.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; You never know what God is up to.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; That was a Saturday.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; She caught a ride to church.
[2:06:28] Some people say, "Well, my car told her
[2:06:29] I ain't going. I'm going stay on. I'mma
[2:06:31] stream.
[2:06:33] I lost somebody
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; church.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew what happened but our
[2:06:40] family.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Me, mama, uh uh my other daughter was
[2:06:44] out of town. That was it. Look, he said
[2:06:49] she got to church Sunday morning.
[2:06:53] This why you ought to be bouncing from
[2:06:55] place to place cuz your shepherd has a
[2:06:56] voice for you.
[2:07:04] Brother so and so said, "Brother S, go
[2:07:06] to that church. Please, please go
[2:07:08] there."
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Your shepherd has a voice for you if you
[2:07:14] if you if you pay attention.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; She was in church. Pastor ain't know
[2:07:19] what take place. Pastor say, "God is so
[2:07:22] far ahead of us." This not his exact
[2:07:24] word. He said he's so far ahead of us.
[2:07:26] God will bust your tires
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; cuz he know you about to go down the
[2:07:31] road and get in a fatal accident.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what that did to my
[2:07:40] daughter?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; It turned her sadness into a worship.
[2:07:55] She sent me cuz today I got to see your
[2:07:57] clas preach. He said, "Yo, you just got
[2:07:59] you just got here. You just got here,

[2:08:08] good."
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, musicians. I'm closing.
[2:08:17] church. When it look like it's falling
[2:08:19] apart, it's exactly where God wants it.
[2:08:23] When it look like the enemy is raging
[2:08:25] and raging, God is still in control.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; He's on top of it all.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; He just wants you to understand to him,
[2:08:37] your life is not a secret.

[2:18:03] Brother Charles want to speak a
[2:18:05] testimony.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say anything, but you
[2:18:09] know what? Uh this morning or later on
[2:18:12] this afternoon before I came in, I said,
[2:18:13] "Well, but if you want me to say
[2:18:15] something, then you know, you'll you'll
[2:18:17] uh you'll do something." And brother
[2:18:19] Digg's testimony is what, you know, told
[2:18:21] me I needed to go ahead and say it. But
[2:18:23] um
[2:18:25] there was a situation at my house with
[2:18:27] my toilet. That was the Lord saying that
[2:18:29] to me about fixing my toilet.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it was a longer testimony
[2:18:33] because the Lord led Brother Steven a
[2:18:35] few weeks ago, you know. He says, "Speak
[2:18:38] to the air conditioner,"
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; you know. So, normally I pick things up
[2:18:44] really quickly, but I didn't pick it up.
[2:18:46] It didn't didn't come at me right. But I
[2:18:48] said, "Okay, Lord, I'm not going to take
[2:18:50] no thought. I'm just going to receive
[2:18:51] it." Test. We testified and talked about
[2:18:54] on the way home. And while we were
[2:18:57] talking about on the way home, I said,
[2:18:58] "I'm going to cut it on anyway, you
[2:19:00] know." And then I stood. So I went home,
[2:19:02] cut it on, the suction line still froze
[2:19:05] over, but something the entire time was
[2:19:09] like way in the back and I couldn't
[2:19:11] barely pick it up, but it's like
[2:19:13] somebody's going to come take care of
[2:19:15] it. And
[2:19:18] brother Jojo end up coming out and he
[2:19:21] said it was nothing wrong with it at
[2:19:22] all. But as I was meditating upon it,
[2:19:26] the Lord had to remind me of what he
[2:19:28] gave brother Kelly. when brother Kelly
[2:19:30] said the uh
[2:19:33] that time the when brother Brandon was
[2:19:35] out there with the squirrels he said he
[2:19:37] his voice changed brother Brandon didn't
[2:19:39] pick it up quite cuz it was a change or
[2:19:41] something and when he brought that back
[2:19:43] to my mind I said okay but that's what
[2:19:45] happened and I just wanted to testify
[2:19:47] because you know the Lord is speaking
[2:19:49] through our pastor
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; and the ministry
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I just have to testify because
[2:19:59] I was praying and asking the Lord to
[2:20:00] make a way for me to testify. So,
[2:20:02] Brother Charles, thank you. God used
[2:20:04] you. So, I want to say I came to church,
[2:20:09] no energy.
[2:20:12] My head was feeling like it was going to
[2:20:14] explode and I'm like, Lord, I have to go
[2:20:16] on backup and sing. I can't do it, but
[2:20:18] I'm coming. And as I sat there and the
[2:20:21] word was coming forth, the strength that
[2:20:24] I received, the energy he restored unto
[2:20:27] me, I claim my healing.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Flu, no flu, no cold, nothing. Thank
[2:20:32] you, Lord. I am healed.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:40] I was thinking about her because I say,
[2:20:42] you know what? I'm going to tell her, go
[2:20:44] ahead the way you feel and just sing it
[2:20:46] and before you know it, everything will
[2:20:48] be going. and here happened. Praise God.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's another testimony here
[2:20:55] um brother uh from brother Tony and
[2:20:58] sister Katrina. And he said I was
[2:21:01] supposed to read it but I forgot but
[2:21:03] brother Charles brought it up. Amen. So
[2:21:06] this from brother Tony and sister
[2:21:08] Katrina said, "God bless you saints. A
[2:21:11] son was having problems in his body. So
[2:21:14] he was taken to the ER and they found a
[2:21:17] lesion on his thyroid. Today they had
[2:21:21] done an ultrasound on him to make sure
[2:21:24] it isn't considerious. We put him in
[2:21:27] prayer and trusting and believing all is
[2:21:29] well. We just want to thank God in
[2:21:32] advance for good test results. Amen. So
[2:21:37] Amen. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen.
