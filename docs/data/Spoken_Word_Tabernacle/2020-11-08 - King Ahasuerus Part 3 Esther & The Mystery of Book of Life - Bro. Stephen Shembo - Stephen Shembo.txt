you [Music] god bless you [Music] god bless your church i'll try to try to be brief and i've been putting it off but um about a month a month and a half ago i came up and gave a testimony about being involved in an accident and i don't know if y'all remember but a car ran me off through when i came back on i didn't have control of my vehicle and i saw headlights coming into my driver door but god brought me out just far enough to where they hit my back end spun me out and landed in the ditch after that accident occurred the couple days later i went to the police department to get the report of the accident and i was leaving the police department and i was trying to merge into a lane no one would let me in but finally a lady stopped and honked and thought she was waving me in so i come in and then she hit the back end of my wife's suv i'm like lord i don't know what you're doing but mercy so i i got to the red light and i parked my car and i got out um i knew it was her fault but i was like i just don't want no more damages to a vehicle i don't want to go through another accident have it on my insurance so i got out and i went around the back of the car and there was nothing on my car i was like praise the lord and i looked at her car and there was nothing on her car i was like praise the lord so i went over to her window to knock on her window to talk to her at the red light and she wouldn't roll her window down she looked at me she wouldn't talk to me then she picked up her phone and took a picture of my license plate i'm like what's going on here i was like mercy um so i went around the back of her car took a picture of her license plate and i tried not talking to her again the light turned green i was parked at the lights i jumped in my suv started to pull away pulled over to the side of the road and she just turned and left so i was like well you know no damages we should be fine so i go home couple days later get a call from the police that she apparently called the cops reported me get a call from my insurance she put a claim on my insurance for uh damages to her vehicle and bodily injury and i was like man why why why so i called the police station i tried to give my side of the report and she they apparently were going my insurance was apparently going to pay her out because it was going to go as an accident on my record because i was merging and she had she had the lane so i was like that doesn't make sense because she let me in and then she hit me in the back but they're like since she possessed the lane and you were coming into the lane you're going to be found at fault i was like i never heard of that because my back of my end of my car got hit so it should be her fault but that was where my insurance was at she won all the way till the very end she spoke to my insurance and said the 60 70 year old man that hit me and they were like hold up what and it brought it all back and then they could tell it was fraud and they said our our uh our guy that we insure is not 60 70 years old he's a young man no the man that hit me was 60 70 years old and i saw that was the lord just though that that whole last month of my life i was just saying was trying to discourage me i had the one accident without a car only had liability on my car so out of car had to get a new one then driving my wife's car two days later getting another accident it's going to go on my insurance just one thing after then i purchased a new car i knew it had damage but i didn't know the extent of the damage but i want to take it to my mechanic they said the frame is absolutely terrible and you're it it needs a lot of work so i took it to auto body shop they held it for almost a month and got all the work done but turned out it wasn't as much as we thought it was gonna be turned out to be okay i'm still ahead on the car i could sell it and get my money back but the lord is good i just tried to i was so discouraged one thing after another but i just tried to remain at peace and just know lord i know you know what you're doing i don't understand it and it seems like everything's kind of falling apart for me but you know i know what you know what you're doing so i'm just going to keep a good attitude i told my insurance company the last time i spoke with them when they said they were going to pay the lady out i said i don't understand that at all she should have been at fault she hit the back end of my car but the whole reason why i called the police and reported it and i'm talking to you guys i'm telling you the true story i said i'm a christian and i just want to do the right thing so wherever it goes whatever happens i'm a christian i want to do the right thing so i tried to have a good attitude about it even though satan was trying to get me riled um and i thought i thought i was going to go in her favor but the last last thing last the very right when they were going to pay her out 60 year old man i was like she saw me knock on her window i don't know where she got that from but that was the lord just kind of handling the situation and i drove my car in today and it's running good it's all fixed it's uh it's good so i just know the lord knows what he's doing and i just want to praise him for just taking care of me through that last month and a half god bless you hallelujah i'm a little surprised at that because if she left the scene of an accident without a report being there that that's that's you know fishy anyways does anybody else have a praise report and then we'll move on to uh prayer requests i do have a couple of announcements anybody we want to we want to kind of bring something up here with um with chris goss he's back in town um visiting my daughter um we did get him a job locally he's

announcement it's on youtube even if you miss an announcement for one two months it's on youtube amen blessed be the name of the lord so make sure you give your number also those who came early today i believe we were playing a soft music what we're trying to do is just to create an atmosphere welcoming to the lord i know we have that tendency like it's a hotel no this is no more a hotel for us amen this is our sanctuary until the lord gives us a room so when you enter here behave like in the church you only speak here if necessary if you need a coach you tell me i'm going to give it to you if you have something going on you want to talk go outside on the lobby you can talk so even if you're setting up the instrument make sure you only speak when necessary we don't want to grieve the holy spirit amen oh my god exodus chapter 12 don't worry you'll be all right brother kalima is having a 24th wedding anniversary amen blessed be the name of the lord but he is online though i saw him amending or something so he's online radical is preaching if i'm not mistaken he's in alabama where his son is so probably he might be preaching but i have to confirm it exodus chapter 12 how many read esther chapter one and chapter two okay amen young people how many read this chapter one in chapter two okay praise the name of the lord and how many had a chance to read the church age book okay blessed be the name of the lord exodus chapter 12. verse 35 if you dare you can say amen and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrow of the egyptian jewels of silver and jews of gold and remnant the lord gave them favor verse 36 and the lord gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptian this was according to the promise of abraham if you go to genesis 14 you will see that god already spoke to abraham i will deliver your children out of her country that they will be slaves from egypt but i'm gonna strip the egyptian off from their wealth so that favor was given so whatever they ask the egyptian nobody will withhold anything you might be saying amen verse 36 and the lord gave the people forever in the sight of the egyptian so that they lent to them such things as they require this is the first exodus whatever the one they give it to them and they spoil the egyptian and the children of israel journey from ramesses to sukkoth about 600 000 on foot that were men beside children so going around 2 million verse 38 and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cuddle so what i want you to remember there is when god sent a prophet in egypt to claim a people out of egypt when israel came out of egypt there was a mixed melted among them so not everybody that came out entering the promised land amen so from the people that came out of egypt there was a mixed melted that went up with it a mixed multitude that followed the prophet a mixed multitude that followed moses they followed moses for 40 years until they all died in the desert then only two from the original entering with the new generation amen let's go to the song of solomon if you read the church book you should getting it should be it should be only the light will be blanking already amen praise the name of the lord song of solomon chapter six if you read that you can even preach if you read that section you can preach if you're a sister you can exhort tell somebody sit down take your bible look here look here look here look here by just reading the prophet that's our university amen song of solomon chapter six if you dare you can say amen we read this and preach on it on wednesday but we need to get into something here verse eight they are three score queens you remember that many coins amen and four score concubins many concubans all women and virgin without numbers there's three categories here that we spoke about them we have queens many of them conkeman many of them and we also have virgins many of them amen so when the word is pulling it's pulling a lot of virgins amen some among the virgin ma end up to be queen are you following me some might end up to be concubin amen not everybody that came out of egypt entering verse nine my dove now it's nero my dove he's a dove amen and my dove there is a relationship my dove my auntie phil she's virgin is but what so regardless of the number of the virgin only one were qualified to be the queen amen but one she's the only one of her mother that church only birth one amen are you there esther had no siblings esther and dad no big brother little brother big sister little sister she was only birth one from her mother are we there but she was virgin and there could be a potential for her to be a queen or for her to be a concuban amen she's the choice one of her that bore her the daughter saw her and blessed her something about this young girl that when she goes everybody's just pleased with her amen the queens and the concubins and they praise her verse 10 who is she that girl that only one who is she that looks forth as the morning so she looks if you look at her it is like the rising of the sun it is the rising of the sun that's a woman amen she is fair as the moon the moon is what the church but there was one moon where the light is gonna be like the light of the sun amen and the light of not one sun but seven star or seven days son amen who is she that looks forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as what so this woman is nothing but a perfect reflection of the sun she's him if you sleeping you need to wake up if you are sleepy stand on the back day this is not the time to sleep in church prophecy are falling into their place who is she that looks for us the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible awesome as uh so she's also an invincible army you see your prophet here the bride will be an invincible it's right here in the scripture did brother branham ever give you the scripture you need a prophet and terrible as an army with what banners praise the name of the lord let's go to matthew 22. we read this over and over and hopefully we want to clench it today and jesus answered and spoke to them again by parable and say the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king which made a marriage for his son and sent forth his servants to call them that were beaten to the wedding and they would not come like queen vashti again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are beaten behold i have prepared my dinner vast i have a place my oxen and my are killed and all things are ready come to the marriage the call is a call to the marriage we're gonna see today but they made a lot of it they make fun of the invitation of the king and went their ways one to his farm like kane tiller of the soul another to his merchandise the city of tower that prostitute that made trade with all the world and the remnant these are dropping right now and the remnant took his servant and he treated them spitefully and slew them ken killing abel but when the king heard thereof he was angry just like he was angry because queen faster refused it and he sent forth his army and destroyed those murderers and burned up their cities there are two mysterious war that unfolded in the book of esther and we're gonna see those wars [Music] i put those court like five years and left them alone and say one of this day we will need it and now those words unfolded in the book of esther two wars you're gonna get deep in the message they say then say the verse 8 here to his servant the wedding is ready there is a place there but there which were beaten were not worthy they were not worthy by their character amen by their response to the call their response to the invitation their response to the message of the seventh chamberlain rejecting the message of the seventh chamberlain proved that you were not worthy to begin with even though you were queen amen go you therefore into the highways now go everywhere into all the king provinces and as many as you must you shall find bid to what to marriage it is a call to marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both what aha when israel came out of egypt they were the true one and it makes what they call is pulling two vines are we okay there are many queens many concubines many virgins but only but yet they're gonna be called but only one will qualify are you there the servant of the king went into the highways they collected people left and right but under their collection they were good and bad they were a bad one and they were a good one if you read your church ages now you are ready to take off the airport amen so the servant went out verse 10 into the highways and gathered together all as many as the fan both bad and and the wedding was what so when they call them they enter into this wedding place amen but inside the facility that they gathered into it inside the reception place not everybody that was there was good they responded to the call but not everybody that responded was good not everybody that followed moses was good even though they entered into the place yet among them they were bad people i'm reading the bible watch now who's gonna change it verse 11 and when the king came in to see the guest so the king came and begin to inspect they just like who is this sister l'oreal okay who are you sister zaddy okay who are you brother divine okay amen when the king came to see the guest he saw there was a man which had not a wedding garment on he was within the the facility he has been called he has been poor he has been given a place as a guest but no wedding garment are we there nowhere in government and he said to him what he was not an enemy [Music] you see now jesus judas jesus called him friend but he was the son of perdition a friend that came from hell okay and when the king came and see the guest he saw there was a man which had not the wedding government he says to him friend how came you in here not having a wedding garment and he was what then say the king to the servant ban him hand and feet and take him away and cast him into other words he need to go through the tribulation okay there shall be what and verse 14 give you the summary for what not few many queens many conquer man many virgins but how many are chosen and the number is only let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord the devil fought me so bad this morning but father you touch me and you heal me a new lord when i was sitting at home a thought came back to my mind that i am in the line of duty and because i am in the line of duty i spoke to the devil and that devil had to obey and to leave father we are reporting this morning in the line of duty because you told us that as we see the day approaching we need to gather together into your house father we have obeyed that commandment and we are here under the commandment of the king himself father may your anointing job more this morning may you speak to us so minister to us remove every injuries lord seal the devil of various or evil thought away from this place and may lord father you minister madly to us this morning as we committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you good to see you all in the house of the lord we heard a wonderful sermon on wednesday with brother kelly seems like everybody is getting better and better now last week we were on part two of king a hazary's three-fist we spoke about the first fifth you remember that and we finished the second fist we're trying to get into the third feast which is part three when we were ending up the last feast we ended with the seventh day because the second feast have seven days of the feast and on the last day there was something that happened to the wine of the king and we found out that with that wine there was not an ordinary wine because on the first day the king never was drunk on the second day there was no stimulation that happened to the king on the third day there was no stimulation all the way to the seventh day and on the seventh day that was the day that a stimulation grows up from the wine and then got into the king and that stimulation brother brandon explained to us that it is a new wine it was it only happened on the seventh day because on the seventh day it was the edge of the revelation amen then the king sent his chamberlain to go ahead and get the queen and we found out that the last of the chamberlain was called carcass because the bible taught us that where the carcass is that's where the ego will be gathering and the caucus was crushed amen so there was seven chamberlain but one of those chamberlain was crushed like we spoke about the constellation of the little bear there were seven angels a seven star but one of the star was the north star which was crushed everybody there praise the name of the lord then we went down and we found out that not only did the king have seven specific chamberlain but the king also have seven princes are you there and those princes the last one of those princes was mammocan let's go to esther chapter one we're gonna blend now amen esther chapter 1 verse 14. if you dare you can say amen brother david if you can rise a little bit so i will save my voice if you dare you can say amen and the next to him was corsina one at mata that was the last one of the princes the seven princes of what persia and middles which were the seven pillars upon which the wisdom of the king was standing because those seven princes were wise men you remember it's right there in the scripture which saw the king face and we explained to you that when jesus was talking about the children he said do not let anybody abuse that young kids because their anger see the king's face the children are here but in heaven they have a representation and that representation sees the king face and in heaven before the throne of the king there are seven spirits which are the seven manifestation of the holy spirit throughout the seven church edges and those seven manifestations also immorphed themselves into angels and as angel they go to the messenger and they speak to the messenger are you there so you cannot have the fullness of god only with one of the spirit if you want to see the fullness of god you must have our seven spirit are you there but through the process of the church ages paul declared that he preached in part and the reason why paul preached in part because when the angel that went to paul begin to give paul the revelation of the age of ephesus before that angel unfold the entire revelation god cut that angel off and pull him out are you there then paul said whatever i preached to you it's just a part and the same process happened to arenas all the way to brother branham are you there but on the seventh day are you there all those seven angels all those seven spirits must come and to bring the left over of the other messenger because you cannot have the fullness of god with only one of those spirit it is one holy ghost but it can manifest itself through seven different ways are you there so don't spirit see the face of god but they must have someone on earth that can reflect them are you there just like a child have a representation in heaven the messenger also have their representation in heaven and those who representation see the king first are you there so they see the kingfish through the angels everybody clear and the bible says that they saw the king's face and which sat her the first in the kingdom that's the reason why if you remember wednesday when brother branham went to the sixth dimension are you there brother branham had the position elevated or higher than anybody brother branham saw himself sitting on the throne in a position higher because brother branham is one of the seven princes amen that sit higher in the kingdom when you want to deal with god you deal through those spirits are you there and because on the first day only one messenger comes on the second day only one angel come on the third day only one angel come on the fourth day one sixth one but on the seventh day because all the mysteries of god must be relieved with you all seven chamberlain must come together amen but if all seven comes there must be a messenger on the earth that is waiting for them and that seventh was memocan amen and carcass i told you on wednesday means the covering of the lamb which was crushed brother branham there he is with them angels the water so the cloud is your message amen you don't play with the cloud which was the seventh breaking of them seven because what brandon said every engine was a seal are you there praise the name of the lord air breaking off the seals that reveal serpentine and all these things here and it shows that it is the very water it is caucasian are you there when they take the picture of the seven engine and move it sideways it is crushed it is the lamp that appear but that lamp has a covering and that covering is carcass he shows that it is his very covering his supreme authority so the cloud the seven chamberlain are the supreme authority of the king when they are coming they are coming under the name of the king with a supreme authority that's why brother branham could sit and indict everybody accuse everybody under the supreme authority of the seven angel because the signet is given to mordechai the authority of the king the ring of the king is given to modekai are you there he is supreme he is what or what there he is his word is still what supreme which is the message and the word memocan means impoverished that's the reason why brother manna must be poor and the word mehmukha means also to prepare i will send you elijah the prophet to do what to prepare [Music] but his message is certain and true amen and memo can have seven letters brother branham have seven letters are you there what is carcass it's revelation 10 1. amen it is the mighty angel that is coming down there is seven angels but one of them is different the reason why he's different he was doing like this revelation 10 unfold to us that because he was coming with the open book are you there that's the reason why his chest was like this he was holding the revelation the stimulation of revelation the wine of the seventh day are you there brother branham another thing i want you to notice what took place what taken place and if you are listening to the table of the of the what time is it sir you will notice that one angel was very what notable to me the rest of them just seems to want to so brother branham say when he entered the constellation all other angels were ordinary they were ordinary because paul used them because iranians used them because columba used one because martin used one because luther used one because wesley used one that there was one that was not used yet and that one reflected to brother branham are you there but this angel was another danger he was to my left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid now the angel was to my left would really be there conquest order seventh angel if we would count them from the left to right because he was on my left me looking to him towards the west are you there him towards the east so he was looking to the east like this and brother branham also was looking toward the west in other words him and brother branham were looking facing each other because his face is reflected enough by men who can are you there yes hallelujah so that will be the last and just what very notable remember how he said how i said he had his got his head back and he's great sharp wings and how he flew right to me now this is duh and still uh so that caucus was the seventh field and the way the seventh seal opened when the bible was written brother branham said it was not written like this the bible was written in scroll they used to take and they wrote the squad and they put a seal and they take the second row and they roll it and they put it still and they put the third one and the seal so the seven seal was the last seal which was on the outside and you cannot open the other seal until you break the seven seal and when you break the seven seal then you can pen all other seals [Applause] [Music] hallelujah so at the time of the breaking of the seventh year there must be an angel coming down but revelation 10 1 cannot happen without revelation 10 7 there must be an earthly angel waiting for a heavenly angel to sound the trumpet hallelujah memocan is your revelation 10 7 which is a netflix angel we have a heavenly angel this is the throne of god and we have an earthly angel that is receiving message down hallelujah brother branham and how this angel down along the road messenger of the church ages luther wesley all of them open to a certain part that's why paul said part of that but in the seventh hour seventh day the seventh messenger that all this mystery should be finished see there's seven earthly not heavenly athletes memocan heavenly's carcass the seven earthly messenger this angel that he speak on he speak of them was on earth an angel means messenger and then after that he saw another angel coming down not the earthly angel that's memocan that had been given the message here but another mighty angel that carcass came down from heaven came from heaven with what rainbow all over him that's the one with the seventh seal brother branham said when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel are you there the reason why there was a blast in sunset mountain god told brother branham when you go to sunset mountain you're going to have a blast if you need a coach you see me and the blast is a signal to you that the seventh seal has been broke in heaven and when it's broken in heaven it is sand on the earth and when he sat on the earth it blasted sunset mountain it was a signal that's why they thought brother branham go now to jeffersonville because you promised the church you cannot preach anything new except in jeffersonville so now you need to go back to jeffersonville but that didn't happen by any chance because if you take your one dollar bill and you flip it on the back you will see that on your dollar bill on the left side you're gonna see a circle with a pyramid are you there and with a capsule on you but if you look on the right side you will see an ego are you there are you there i understand my ego but in the mouth of that ego you'll see there is a scroll go check your dollar bill go check your dollar bill you will see a scroll that has been opened and put in the mouth of the ego come on are you there the constellation of the pyramid happened on the west side but the preaching must happen on the east this is where the ego have the scroll in the mouth that's why the angels say go back east go back to jeffersonville the mystery is beyond the dollar let me stay in tune here hallelujah on comes the engine the messenger who revelation 10 1 carcass setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seven engine is our memocan at the time of this in other words and when revelation 10 1 come down revelation 10 7 is prepared to speak that's the reason why none of the seven priests spoke except memocan because he was the age of mehmukhan bhavanam continued here he say even those who are alive and remain until the coming shall not hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of god should sound and the last and at that last trumpet when the last seal do what is broke and when the seven angel is what so the last cell in heaven is connected to the seven angel down are you there there is one heavenly one earthly one heavenly zero barbar zero babel and your high priest and there is one what everybody clear let's go now to esther chapter 19. we already left the airport now amen let's get to our sermon esther chapter 1 verse 19. this is the word of mehmukhan and he pleased the king and if he please the king mehmukhan is talking what authority have memo can to reject the king the queen if somebody have a gut to come and tell you you need to chase your wife away what authority have that person it is the supreme authority only under supreme authority are you there if there is trouble in the land if election we go to the supreme court the supreme court have a right to speak are you there esther chapter 1 verse 19. memo can say if he please the king let there go uh roar your commandment he's just a priest but he is proposing a royal commandment like the king is speaking let's go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persian and media that he be not what altar what is mehmukhan looking for that vashta come what no more before the king that's the first thing and number two and let the king give her a royal state which is a position to another that is better than faster was a queen you see that but there is a woman that is better than a queen you see now they were queens concubine virgin but that younger one is better than all of them so first she must beat queen vasa she must beat the concubine and she must beat all the virgins i'm still moving up to get the altitude the second is give her position to another if you go to revelation 18 7 you will see that deposit it say that i sit as a queen do you want to read it let's go to revelation 18 keep esther chapter one let's go to revelation 18 because we saw vasta was the roman catholic church let's go to revelation 18. there was a queen let's see what she say seven revelation 18 verse seven how much she has what glorify herself and live deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she says in her like lucifer remember she says in her heart i sit uh you see that queen faster i see a queen and i am no and shall see no let's go back to esther chapter one you see now so queen vesta was married to the king are you there but when the king called her and she came in because she refused to come to the king memo can't say take her away and let her never come again to you and see your face no more in other words in plain language mehmukhan she was first married now men who can afford the divorce so there is a mystery of marriage and divorce that arrived okay it is in your bible are you there then that's the first thing the second thing she said give her position to another one but before that she said number one she cannot be a wife anymore and i'm giving a sentence on her she can no longer see your face that's why they have to be an indictment are you there so after the opening of the sales mehmukhan must preach marriage and divorce are we okay and men who can't must preach indictment to indict other churches for rejecting the word christ we okay now but mamuka cannot stop there he must give that position to another one are you there he must call him to another bride why are we giving that position to another one brother branham says notice in marriage and divorce he can what put her away but she cannot put him away he did it has proved it in the days when who because vasta have a feast of women all the churches luther baptist presbyterian all of them into ecumenical movement are you there luther wesley and pentecost when they refuse to become the so there was a further part of the kingdom not a regular part that paul gives not what arenas gives not what all the messenger gave but a further party when that further part came with the seven chamberlain they refused it are you there they felt a part of him by having spiritual sexual affair to become fragmented with the further part of the they rejected the message we don't want it no more enough with what we have you understand she refused the lutheran church refused for christ to have any more desire with her luther refuses and let me say this going to call me something anyhow so it is today with every one of them okay church of christ whoever you call all of them they fail to take the word they refuse who they refuse caucus are we okay and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him only men who can't understand that are you there amen you remember in the bible when the king married who in your message okay because the queen did what he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out with the king and obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refused to be wife to a husband so it is with the church that refused to become pregnant in the age that we servanted to bring forth children of this we are not it's already past we are not it's already passed we are not neither are we pentecostal we've got to be the children of this through the pregnancy of them the child of wolf happened only in the land of judah okay not outside roof must be separated with opera it is in the second marriage that roof got pregnant are we there through the pregnancy of the world to bring forth a child of this age the seed child amen i hope you understand could not be pregnanted no so what did he do put her away divorce democrat in divorcement that's right but she dares put him away he put her away so that mystery of marriage and divorce must be brought by memocan and not only that accusation indictment of the other churches then memo can open the choosing of the brothers are you there are you there that's why the choosing of the bride is preached after this here because there is a rejection of the message there is an indictment then there must be a choosing of the brand and after the choosing there will be the marriage of the land and there will be also the invincible invisible union [Music] are we there we okay now let's go now esther chapter two praise the name of the lord you don't understand brother branham chill out just believe when they bring you food you don't sit and say this is tomato where did it come from walmart or what swallow it after these things when the wrath of the king of hazaris was appeased he remembered remember the hole and what she has done and what she did what was decreed against her then say the king's servant not the king because the seven ninja when they come they will continue their ministry they drop down in sunset mountain and they went baptist with brother branham and every day they have to come and continue to give messages and they never stop because brother branham said the seven still when he begin he have a beginning but the seven seal is a seal when he opened he continued to open he continued to open he continued to open we will get to that are you there so then the king's servant that ministered to him the chamberlains are still talking they're still anointing okay let there be fair young what we just disqualify a queen okay all right now we are dealing with there thank you but those virgins must be beautiful queen vesta was beautiful but the beauty of the church is the the character of the people okay be fair young virgin sought for the king they must be sought we gotta go search them because the first that were invited refused the first guest of matthew 20 to refuse now they must call officer to go in the highway and begin to search are we blending the scripture together okay verse three and let the king appoint officer servant okay preacher you must preach appointed by the king not a pastor training you to be preacher it must be a call paul minister of god by the will of god not man okay the king appointed officer in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may do what many are called we are just gathering we are just pulling gather together all the fair young virgins to shoeshine the palace to the house of what so there is a gathering here the queen in his big palace there is a section in that palace which is called the house of women are we there which is the church amen when you get anybody you pull him there bring him to church bring him to church bring him to church from the nightclub come on from walmart come on from others on come on from whatever come on in the church are you there to the house of women the women to the custody of who hey the king's chamberlain keep her off the women and let the things for her purification be given to her we already explained to you that the process of going out and picking you up is called justification what branham say to justify means there is a glass in the mud and when you come and you pick up the glass from the mud you justify the glass are you there but the glass is still dirty you gotta take the glass and wash it to prepare it for a service that is your sanctification your purification but after picking up choosing justification and sanctification they must fill you up with water for the king to drink the feeling is your baptism of the holy ghost everybody so by going be being picked it is called justification but when you get in the house of reger they just pick you up you have many dirt you have your tradition you have your temper you have your problem but they're bringing you to the house off they called the lord to start your cleaning up because ephesians 5 told us that you need to be watched by the washing of the world are we clear you must go through your purification buckle up pretty good because i'm in the correct attitude okay those who study their church ages welcome amen now let's go to verse 14. if you are sleeping wake up is everybody alert is everybody alert sister roof we alert praise the name of the lord let's go to verse 14. in the evening watch very careful when you are picked and you come into the king you get into the house of women i want you to stay really in tune in here you are under the custody of hager we already explained to you that hey gay is the holy spirit that's right are you there because hege means meditation it means groaning it means word it means separation all those four attributes the holy spirit does it it's the holy spirit that separates you it is the holy spirit that fits you with the word it is the holy spirit that brings the groaning in your life it is the holy spirit that does your meditation are you there when you come in you handle the holy spirit and brother branham said matter of fact the one who picked you up was the holy spirit are you there he was the king appointed officer he was the holy spirit using a preacher to preach the word and to get your heart and bring you to church but that same holy spirit that justify you must also sanctify you everybody clear we're under hagai now the point is this everybody that comes through hagen must be virgin are you there are we clear but if you enter the house of hege to come out of the house of heger you have only two choices are we clear the first choice you must be picked as a queen everybody if you miss to be picked as a queen you turn to be a concubine let's go to verse 14. in the evening the evening light okay the evening time this bubble wrote in mysteries in the evening she went every woman she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women not the first when you miss here there is another house that is the house of shasgas let's go on the house in the second house of the women to the custody of who shashgas the kings who there is a chamberlain and a chamberlain are you there one prepare you to purify you to prepare you to present you to the king for the king to put a seal on you and say i love this one but if you miss you're going straight somewhere amen you're going to the house of who shashgas and we already told you such gas means what the one who take the wool off the ship because to go in the presence of the king you remember the priest was forbidden to carry war are you there you must remove your wall you must be shield you remember and enter into the king but if you left someone if you didn't listen to the pastor if you were hard-headed when you go into the king if there's still war the king said um there is still more work to be done you go to the house of who chess guys he's gonna take care of the war that you refuse to be taken but in the house of shasgas there is wailing and gnashing whipping and gnashing of truth you're going through the tribulation are you there let's go now in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned on the second house of the women to the custody of shaskas the king chamberlain which kept it there you see now we already dealt with who the queen everybody following me now we are dealing with the virgin at this point everybody's virgin the 10th virgin we don't know who's queen and who's going to go to the tribulation period but after going through this process after the king called to work the virgin we're going to know who is the wise virgin and who is a foolish virgin the wise virgin will be picked as the bride and the foolish virgin will become concubine are you following me you are virgin you can either be the bride wise virgin or foolish virgin the concubine let's go now which kept the concubine watch now very careful she came into the king what remember queen vashta will say no more eternally separated from god are you following me she came in the king what in other words when you miss that opportunity gone watch a mystery stay alert she came into the king no more except are we okay except the king do it so when you enter into the king even if you miss to be the bride but if you have a good behavior [Music] glory that the king loved you still have a chest even though you are going through the tribulation are we okay the foolish virgin won't be saved but they still go through the tribulation but they will never be the bride are we okay let's go back now and dig into these mysteries she came into the king no more except the king delighted in and that she were called by what oh my god who are the 17 changes you okay now so when the virgin are coming there was a record are you there what's your name sharon what's your name what's your name okay there is a record brother robert already got it are you there the word chess guys stay in tune we're in trouble here but we're gonna soar there's just gas means that the one who take off your wall because you missed it right we're speaking about the tribulation period okay now watch carefully the only way you can come out from saskatchewan you must be called by name are you there how can they call 2 million virgins and the king remember them there is a record that i have name the name spoke of a record are we okay is everybody okay okay this record brings to us four categories of people let me go here first when you coming you are a virgin everybody is a virgin they are good and bad remember in matthew guest good and bad foolish and wise virgin you're gonna go through the house of peggy are you there for your purification if you leave here gay you're gonna face the king are you there when you face the king if you qualify you go up you are the bride and the reason why you are the bride you must replace faster you must be better than faster you must be obedient to the world and we spoke about surrendering your will your self-will okay because esther didn't want to pick anything except what who he told him because hager knows the king but the fifth will was given to the people that if you're a virgin whatever you want to pick pick and go to the king when the virgin entered uh i believe i need this i believe i need this believe oh the king would like this would like some lipstick this this you go to the king hey guys just sitting say keep moving you go there chase guys next what do you want to pick is this for me yes can i pick whatever i like yes oh let me pick this jewel pic pig pig pig pig hey guy is just watching what do you want you finish yes what do you want give me those high heels maybe if i go this way the king will love it get get you finished come on go there go there what is the breaking news in cnn amen amen are you there then it was esther turner hey comes he said esther pick everything let's say stop playing here [Music] i'm not gonna pick anything you pick it for me [Applause] are you sure he said i'm not gonna dress myself you the king chamberlain you know the secret of women you need to tell me what i need [Applause] close the door when they close the door he says take this one that's the pig is saying this he say you're trusting me i know my body i am the holy spirit i know what the king like take this one esther put take this one essay protect this one that's the put but uh hey i saw the other women going listen to me pick this one this was a test that was put here to see whether you're going to do things according to your will or you're going to surrender your will to the will of the king are you there are you sure yes hey guys that's it that's it hey you think it's enough put your car in neutral [Applause] amen are you there move on oh jesus oh jesus they just say stop take a deep breath i am reggie i know what i'm doing you put your confidence in me i'm not gonna let you down let's go move on yes sir are you there as soon as yesterday everybody said whoa [Music] are you there so when you enter through haggai if you met the king if you are chosen automatically you are the blood you are the bride above the queen vashta above the other virgin and above the concubine because many are called but only few chosen are we there but if you miss the king okay you're going to go down to the house of shiskas are we there there are some women that went into the house of chess guards and never was called back did they drop they took their name here they called her name here you are mrs orpah let's go oppa went here when she dropped there no more call are you there that's a catacle your first category is your brand your second category there are some that go there but the king called them back by name there are some that go there and the king don't call them back you are doomed forever you ready and there are some that never even was picked up as a virgin watch now you okay with the board when the first category is the category of lambda that have sheared them off no war are you there those categories enter like esther and picked up and become bride the wise version we okay now the second category is a lamb but with who okay because of who you need more work because you didn't get the first word so you're gonna go through the house of chess guys you're gonna be rejected by the king and you're gonna go to the tribulation period but you have a chance to come back but when you come back they only call you by name are you there but that name you're not gonna be the bride are you there the reason why they call you back because the king delighted in you and david psalm 1819 says that when the king delighting you he's going to deliver you anybody the third that's your second category which is the foolish virgin are the righteous of matthew 25 if you read your church ages you know where i'm coming are we okay because there will be in the last day jesus will separate the sheep from the goat you remember and they say lord where did we see you he said whatever you did to this list one you did it aren't you are you there they are saved but through tribulation and they are called back by name by record stay alert are you there the third category went they are good that's right are you there once they miss the king they go into the tribulation period and never to be called that is your mixed malted that start from egypt are you there and their name remember this their name will be no more call at the beginning their names were listed but right here their name is no more spoken of their name will be erased are we following hallelujah the fourth category are the black black goat they were even never chosen to begin with they don't they're good have their record here are you following me but once they go through chess guys no more record their name is used the last category never was even picked because when he was born the initia they initiated him to witchcraft are you there when he grows up he's a master in sorcery the more he grows up he begins to make shows of magician and he die a magician he has nothing to do with religious world his name was never even in the record of the virgin he came from hell and going straight back to hell are you there are you there are you there let's go to verse eight it's still esther chapter two let's go back to verse eight [Music] this stuff will anchor you like never chapter 2 verse 8 if you're there you can say amen so it came to pass i will strongly encourage you when you come to this church whether you're using your ipad or your phone or what have your bible we are doing this for you don't sit down like you know everything you're going to remember you won't forget amen but i'm saying faith must be based on the word so you must be able to look in your word and you see it and when you go home you say i believe it's in the bible not i believe brothers even spoke about it no i believe it's in the bible i believe i heard brother brad i'm spoken about that that's the two you approach god with not brother stephen are you there verse eight so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together to shoot sean the palace to the custody of who that esther was brought also to the king's house to the custody of reggae keeper of the women keep your seatbelt very good and stay alert you ready verse nine and demanded what hallelujah before even hagee does anything they brought many virgins they bring hege sitting there they bring the virgin hey look oh pig go over there her room room 42 room 55 room 92 room 270 move on are you there when esther comes when hagen looked suddenly something like do you see a mysterious part of your life do you see why your life is mysterious you meet people and suddenly somebody likes you and you meet somebody suddenly they hate you they don't even want you to be there because they feel like there is a threat we don't want this comma we don't want this woman in this company there is something about you that is threatening that one and there is something about you that you get somebody say wait a minute i like her but did you look at the qualification no i believe she's going to be a good one come on are you there they might please him without anything grace are you there the one who had the secret first night and the maiden please him and she obtained what why are they so nice about you because being nice about you you will give them eternal life you understand somebody who's nice about you at the day of judgement remember oh i remember we worked with her in the earth daddy when we were in autozone she helped me with the flight time go ahead and enter yes sir [Applause] are you there and then she and she obtained comments of him and he what not slowly what caught heggy hey again look you room 242 in the morning we give you a stuff you room 225 we give you your stuff tomorrow who's next hey there is a long land bring your stuff why is it that he just believed the message and it looks like he's cramming quickly that's it [Music] he's new to the message and suddenly his understanding things quickly why why hallelujah why she speaks you say wait i mean she just believed the message it looks like she knows a lot hallelujah speedily gave her huh thanks for purification somebody's getting cleaned up quickly stay alert and watch this now watch this now purification which shot things have belonged to her and seven maidens you gotta go through seven church edges it's the bride are you there we already explained this which were meat to be given here out of the king's what it is provided by the king and watch very carefully are you alert [Music] and he did what to her and her man to the of the house of what so there is a mystery in the house of women are you there the house of women has a mystery when you go through haggai hey gay deal only with this that was selected everybody clear when you selected you can either be the bride or the foolish virgin or you're going to be going in a mixed multitude you will go and your name will never be called or you go and your name will be called or you go and you become a brand but those that were never selected don't deal with them because their name was not written those who read the church ages speak of the holy ghost but hey unfold a mystery here the mystery of hegel's house brother john is that inside the house of hege the house of hege is divided in two parts i'm reading the bible everybody clear there is a part that is the best part of the house of reggae everybody here and there is a part that is the regular part of hagen are you there when demanded come here look and say 242 for regular 74 regular you 347 regular when hager saw us there he said uh-uh not this one this one not a regular rumor there is only one room there are many virgins but there is only one chosen in the house of hedger there are many rooms for women but there is one room that is the best and for several reasons when hagen look at us they say over there you mean not today the best one are you there esther don't understand they scout here and maybe on the hallway the other women are looking where are you going i don't know i'm just following them you need to be part of the house because hey have the record are you there take roman nine keeper chapter two i'm gonna drop now quickly head straight and search for the airport are you ready take roman nine hallelujah if you dare you can say amen roman nine why is the house of the king showing favoritism why is the house of the king instead of treating everybody the same they treat people differently are you there why is the king treating this one best but me they treated me regularly roman chapter nine you there verse 11 for the children being not yet what the mystery of predestination has the not even chosen before before even she was chosen by the king are you there neither having done any what and what did esther do anything she just showed up she didn't even do something to please hey that's right are you there esther have not done anything she just showed up not even being born into the church yet not even being entered into the house of the women yet these are dropping from heaven are you there i know what i'm saying i didn't write them are you there [Music] neither done any good or evil that the the purpose of who god according to what because they're trying to choose a bride but that mystery is locked but according to election my stan not of what esther you don't have to do anything to prove me

of this honor it is in the morning praise god either he was enduring you until the morning to send you to the tribulation are you there verse 23 and that imam make known the riches of his on the vessel of what which was prepared before for what he had before prepared to what even who whom he has come not after but also of that paul is saying to you that in god they are vessels of honor and they are vessels of dishonor it doesn't matter what you do or what you're running for it is god that shows mercy and those vessels of mercy has been prepared for glory when the siesta has that click in hagee that this is a vessel of glory everybody there so esther is put on the best place are you there and the other women goes to the regular place what are you saying brother stephen we have four categories the first category is the bride the second is the foolish virgin the third is the mixed mountain this is saved brad this is stiff through tribulation this one is going through tribulation never to be saved this one never gets involved are you there so when you go to hagin who have the book of record are you there true hege there is the best place for the bride you're following me and they are a regular place the regular players have the foolish virgin and the mixed melted are you there but outside of the house of hege they are also those that were not involved you follow me what is your message here you ready the regular housing is the book of life are you okay are you okay and the best place of hedging is the lamb's book of life you okay now the book of life brother john and the lamb's book of life is only one book in only one house but there is a section that is called the lamp's book of life which only is reserved for the bride are you there any other woman goes to the book of life the name here will never be raised but over here some men will be kept by some men who never will have to be removed and there are other names also that were not written in the lamb's book of life hallelujah the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiply form is the book of life the history or the record names of the wheat plant the church is the book of life which of which a part of the book is the record of eternal life are you there a bear see this song soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat then it goes into a stalk this is not yet to it life is in there but not here to it and then at the end it says stock is a like is like a little spike that send out the tassel still the wheat plant but not the wheat then the plant is pollenized and we can see the shaft this looks muddy like the wheat but it's not seed then from the wheat and the husk what i'm trying to show you here is the wheat plant has shock tassel this this this they're gonna be part of the history but at the end the chef will be gathered to be burned are you there are you there but one name this category here the mixed multitude will be raised are you there hallelujah he caught me when i was nothing i am still nothing but i am in his hand esther see he caught me and he loved me when i was unlovable that's esther he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed you just like the color sister said that time in her testimony i am not what i ought to be i am not what i want to be then i'm not what i used to be she know she had come somewhere something happened and that is the way it is if god when when i was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up justification that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that is unsaved today look at the other category that's gonna miss the bride that's gonna go through the tribulation period they have to go through the purging some of them will go and never to be caught some of them were never even involved into the process hallelujah million look at the million that who took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place you are in god's what economy you are esther no one can do it that is his love to allah god like a young woman a young girl just happened here in louisville a woman she has been a christian for many years but her husband has just felt she fell in love with this man he had been a christian a couple years a solid woman christian with a young man who just got converted two years and so they got married they love and have confidence in one another and they got married and so the woman said to the man hobby it must be hard on you you are just a young christian you had so much to go through with drinking is what he was he was a drunkard before you had so much to go through with i know you are bound to be tempted awfully hard i say and said i want you to know one thing now if you happen to fall if you happen to fall into temptation and is overcome don't stay away from home because i already chose you are you there young people if you fail don't stay away from the church are you there if you cheated don't stay away from the church if you struggle don't stay away from the churches if you fell into fornication into adultery don't stay away from the church are you there don't stay away from home you come back you come right here because i'm going to be right here waiting for you i'm going to help you pray through again until you get victory are you there i am going to stay with you because when i married you i married you because i loved you and no matter what you are i still love you don't run away from church [Music] are you there you have the trouble don't run away you are struggling don't run away are you there oh my god let me search the airport are we there go back to esther chapter two what a john am i okay if not i have to stop here because this is still loaded are you there let's do this and head to the report esther chapter two you there the third fist of king hazaris we want to stop here and let's take it next time because it looks like it's loaded you okay you want to press to the airport okay let's go to the airport let's stay there but now stay alert because this is loaded esther chapter 2. everybody there verse 17 16 pages are still flipping praise god so esther was taken to king of hazaris into his house royal in the 10th month which is the month of tibet in the seventh year of this reign 10 7 revelation 10 7 10 months seven years 10-7 revelation 10 7. are we okay watch now i'm searching okay verse 17. okay brother edward just told me move up i got a brother evil now i'm okay that's it and a end verse 17 and the king loved who above all look at my board many are queens many are concubine many are virgins but all of them there is only when esther came the king loved her above all even those that he delight that went through shasta's house that he need to call back the foolish virgin but still esther is above all of them because by because hege already showed us the book of life that based on the book of life esther should be on the perfect on the best place it is not me determining it is the book of life the treatment you are receiving in your life it is not you who determine it is based on the book of life your life is he is directed by the book of life those who he called he prays destinated predestinated he called them he justified he also glorified them all of them in the book of life it's a package a combo are you there are you there verse 17. and the king loves to report all the women and she obtained what you see what it is not of work and faithful in the sight of more in his heart more than other there is many virgins many are called bada few chosen above all the virgin so that he said what they all were justified picked they all went through the purification sanctified of hege six months with marriage they have to die then six months with the rose of sheriff but the feeling of the holy spirit is a problem the foolish virgin went into tribulation because of lack of oil are you there but when he saw esther the king bring a crown and put it honestly the quran is what the quran is what the holy ghost watch this he is speaking of this great day that when the witness would come what is our the what you see one you see what we clear now the only woman that went that's why judah justified picked by god chosen judah could cast that devil do everything sanctify but to get to pentecost judah is killed are you there you there let's go number one the holy ghost podecran so that he set the crown upon her head do you see a camera everybody's seen that camera it's the bible when they say end without karma it's connected and they say karma and it's two things separate because we already taught you that there is a birth and there is your adoption the birth you are born that you need to be adopted esther had the crown pudding that's the baptism of the holy spirit but she must move from the crown to take the position of vastia which is adoption are we okay now now the holy ghost the crown is put on her head and then she take the queen bastard's position which is the holy ghost the bible said that he set the royal crown upon her head karma and made her queen instead of who she is better than vacher she's better than the concrete man she's better than all the virgins she was the only woman from her mother only one and she is also an invincible army because you're gonna see her her esther will destroy heaven and he's gonna destroy all the enemy the two mysterious war of este are you there are you there brother if you will just keep the word in your mind you will recall that nowhere does it says that we are in the mouth of god but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth matthew 4 but he answers say men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the half of god yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god no more fasting okay it is on my face that still refuse so god is turning on her on esther now you follow me now he will confirm her through the prophet you see you see the prophet and now it's mordecai and esther either he would destroy the enemy through mordecai and esther through the prophet and the bride are you there he will destroy them through the prophet mordechai and the bride if you notice mordech brother pranam is sometime memocanda and sometimes he's mordecai if you go in the book of revelation you'll find that revelation 3 14 if i'm not mistaken the seven engine that's brought brother you go to revelation 10 7 that's what brother you go to revelation 18 1 that's rather random you go to revelation 18 the angel on the sun that's still brother vernon you go to the revelation the seven engine with the seven file it's still brother branham it is one book but they give you different flavor of the same person are you there so memo khan brother branham monica revealing the son of man the king staying by taking the king chariot is still the ministry of brother branham he will confirm her through the prophet mordecai and the protester for the voice of god will be in that's the voice so that's why queen esther what do you want me to do because my voice is in queen esther mother can say if you keep quiet salvation in other words do you know that you were placed in that position for some time in other words you have a power that you don't understand are you there are you there i'm heading i'm going this way with the plane bear with me you ready go to verse 18 then the king made the er the third feast of king are hazares amen are we clear how many fists of queen narrators the first one the jews the second the gentile but the third is another fist of king a hazaris you okay now i got the direction of living with the gps let's go and the king made a great fist not a small a great fist to order oh brother david order the third fist order princess and he didn't say prince is come our servant it is princess and if you remember in esther chapter one on the first feast we found out that the princes and servants were who if you miss one

will come a time when abraham isaac and jacob all will be sitting in the kingdom of heaven with barbara we see our lord what he did and we realized those old testament sent this morning we found out
