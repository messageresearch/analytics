[0:00] Not a word of it fail. What a privilege.
[0:04] That that should have been to know that
[0:06] you were walking in the wilderness.
[0:10] And there after when he told him the
[0:12] message, they had to believe it first.
[0:14] But after he got him out of there, then
[0:16] God said, I proved to him and I am that
[0:17] pillar far that you met in the
[0:19] wilderness. So he said, gather them all
[0:20] together around the mountain. And he
[0:21] come down on top of Mount Si. And God
[0:23] begin to thunder out. And the people
[0:26] said, don't let God speak. Let Moses
[0:28] speak. Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let God said, "I won't speak to
[0:30] him no more like this, but I'll raise
[0:32] him up a prophet that'll speak in my
[0:33] name." See,
[0:35] &gt;&gt; so we find out that that's what God's
[0:37] always done. Why couldn't they see that
[0:38] in the beginning? See all these things
[0:40] and then murmur against the message that
[0:44] was taking them to the promised land to
[0:46] start them out right and taking them to
[0:47] the promised land. But they still they
[0:49] had to murmur against it. Think how
[0:51] perfect how they could have walked every
[0:53] day walking with the Lord. What a life
[0:56] to live right in the wilderness at night
[0:59] time eat mana of the morning it fell
[1:01] over the night and you know what become
[1:03] so common to them till they said our
[1:05] soul loth this bread
[1:07] &gt;&gt; and that's the way it's been with us
[1:10] &gt;&gt; I just think of the little groups that
[1:13] we just in my own little ministry across
[1:15] the nation seeing not only healing and
[1:18] things that's always been healing God
[1:21] always had a healing uh outlet somewhere
[1:24] even he had
[1:26] angel on a pool once and he all kinds of
[1:28] things. The the bra serpent in the
[1:30] wilderness. They've always had symbols
[1:31] of healing. That isn't what I'm talking
[1:33] about. Healing is one thing attracts the
[1:34] attention of the people. Anybody will
[1:36] donate to a healing service. They'll
[1:38] they'll donate to a song festival. But
[1:40] when it comes to a poor lost soul, ain't
[1:42] got nothing to do with that. Now, isn't
[1:44] that about right?
[1:45] &gt;&gt; We got everything to a poor lost soul.
[1:48] Don't want nothing to do with that. They
[1:50] let him gul out into anything. Say,
[1:51] "Well, that's all right. He belongs to
[1:52] church that won't hurt anything. But now
[1:55] we find here coming to a close as quick
[1:58] as we can here. Think of how perfect it
[2:01] was. I look down to the the days that we
[2:04] have been here on this earth. Look what
[2:05] the Lord God has done. Started off in
[2:08] great signs and wonders and miracles
[2:10] which we all enjoyed and watch. Then
[2:12] come the message behind it. Watch what's
[2:14] taking place. Walking right not just by
[2:16] yourself.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Man along with you. See a cluster of
[2:20] angels come from the heavens. shake the
[2:23] whole earth to stand there in the
[2:25] newspapers, write it up.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Was predicted months and months before
[2:28] hands would take place. There he stood
[2:30] there and said, "The time is at hand.
[2:31] Return back. Open the seven seals of
[2:34] mysteries has been hid all through the
[2:35] reformations and things. Bring it out."
[2:37] Then comes preaching serpent seed and
[2:39] all these things like that. What does
[2:41] the clergy do instead of sin? Well,
[2:42] Luther said this or they just they'll
[2:45] never see it. See? But what a privilege
[2:48] it is for us
[2:50] &gt;&gt; who believe and walk in the presence of
[2:52] God every day. Stand there and see a
[2:54] whirlwind come out of the sky. It blow
[2:56] them out in half and you stand there
[2:57] where we was at. Cut the top of trees
[2:59] off and things like that.

[34:26] [Applause]
[34:45] I
[34:47] I'm so excited. I don't even have words
[34:49] to explain this. Um that I abite my
[34:54] teeth when I sleep. And so this I was
[34:58] told this at the dentist. And this um
[35:05] Thank you, Lord. It it went on. I was
[35:08] told to get some guard to prevent that,
[35:11] but uh they were so uncomfortable. So, I
[35:13] couldn't wear them even though I had
[35:16] them. But as time went on, uh, when I
[35:19] would open my mouth wide, it would crack
[35:22] like I was pop, literally pop at the
[35:25] joints. So, the dentist told me that it
[35:29] was my what they call the TMJ, the the
[35:32] joint right here. And so, I I ignored
[35:36] it. Um but uh since the beginning of
[35:40] this year, it became so bad that I would
[35:44] hardly open my mouth wide. So going to
[35:46] the dentist was a real big chore and u
[35:50] sometimes I would I would have to
[35:52] position my head in a certain way
[35:55] because I couldn't open it really.
[35:58] Basically, it would lock at at times.
[36:00] But you know, it didn't bother me. I
[36:02] mean, I said, "Okay, it wasn't painful."
[36:05] So, I didn't really pay much attention
[36:06] to it. But as time went on, it started
[36:10] getting very painful and um sometimes it
[36:14] locks and I can't even brush in the
[36:16] morning. So, I was advised one of my
[36:19] colleagues say, "Why don't you try a
[36:21] chiropractor?" Of course, you know, you
[36:23] try. So, I went and they would do, you
[36:26] know, that machine, but nothing
[36:28] happened. So, it got worse um to a point
[36:33] where I couldn't chew like you know how
[36:36] you get up a stack of hamburgers I
[36:38] couldn't open my mouth to to get it uh
[36:40] to separate it.
[36:42] So, and then uh on Mon know on Friday,
[36:47] this last Friday, I was coming from work
[36:52] and I thought about my dental
[36:54] appointment on Monday, this past Monday.
[36:56] And then as I was driving, something
[36:58] just told me, "Open your mouth." And
[37:00] there I was. I opened my mouth wide. And
[37:03] I was, you know,
[37:07] &gt;&gt; and then I started shouting, "Thank you,
[37:09] Lord. Thank you." And then I opened
[37:11] again and opened again and opened again
[37:13] and um and as I kept on opening
[37:17] there was nothing and you know there was
[37:19] no sound there was no popping or
[37:21] anything. So I reached home and I told
[37:25] my husband I said guess what said what I
[37:27] open
[37:29] why
[37:30] and then he said no sound.
[37:33] So I've just I just want to thank God.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; We bless the name of the Lord

[43:23] that I've never faced before.
[43:29] That's why I'm crawling on you, Lord.
[43:36] I know it's been a while,
[43:40] but Lord, please hear my prayer.
[43:45] I need you like I never have before.
[43:51] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[43:59] Sometimes a troubled sea.
[44:07] Sometimes it takes a desert
[44:15] to get a hold of me.
[44:22] Oh, but your love is so much stronger
[44:30] than whatever trles me.
[44:35] [Music]
[44:39] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[44:47] to trust you and believe.
[44:51] [Music]
[44:58] Forgive me, Jesus.
[45:01] I thought I could control
[45:06] whatever life would throw my window.
[45:13] But this, I will admit,
[45:17] has brought me to my knees.
[45:21] I need you, Lord. And I'm not ashamed to
[45:25] say.
[45:27] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[45:33] Oh,
[45:35] sometimes a troubled sea
[45:38] [Music]
[45:42] and sometimes it takes a desert
[45:46] [Music]
[45:50] to get a hold of me.
[45:57] But your love is so much stronger
[46:03] [Music]
[46:05] than whatever troubles me.
[46:08] [Music]
[46:13] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[46:17] [Music]
[46:20] to trust you anything.
[46:28] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[46:36] to trust you and believe.
[46:39] [Music]

[47:46] holy land. I've got a word in my heart
[47:50] and I am prepared
[47:53] and I will make it on the other side.
[47:57] No matter
[47:59] the devil's dancing my way till I will
[48:02] know my enemy. Oh Jesus
[48:08] and I am
[48:10] the love for my soul.

[49:07] Oh, no matter how the devil stands in my
[49:11] way, still I will know my enemies.
[49:15] Oh, God Jesus.
[49:18] I am
[49:21] the earth. Oh my soul, oh no.
[49:26] [Music]
[49:30] My Jesus is simple control.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got my Christ on my side and I
[49:36] am excited.
[49:38] He's going to bring me to my body. Oh,
[49:42] no matter how long. Yes, I know for sure
[49:47] that I will live eternally.
[49:51] [Music]
[49:52] Amen.
[49:54] How many believe that you're going to
[49:56] live eternally?
[49:58] If you believe it, say amen.
[50:01] I want to hear your amen louder.
[50:05] Some people are not saying amen. I'm
[50:07] watching you. Say amen.
[50:09] Glory to God. Let's give the Lord a big
[50:11] clap offering.

[50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are in Satan's hidden.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; So always expect that sometime the devil
[50:44] is going to be somewhere. But you got to
[50:46] fight your way through and make sure you
[50:48] get it and you show him that no matter
[50:50] what you did, I am still alive and I can
[50:53] still praise and worship the Lord
[50:55] because God is alive.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; We submitted the drawing that stop us to

[51:09] approved.
[51:13] Prayer works.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Prayer changes things.

[51:44] alpha. He's the alpha and he is also the
[51:47] omega. Whatever the Lord started in your
[51:50] life, he who started the good work, he
[51:54] will fulfill it all the way until the
[51:57] day of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[52:03] No weapon formed against us will
[52:06] prosper. Amen. And any tongue that shall
[52:10] rise against me, I have a right to
[52:12] condemn it.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm condemning anything that
[52:17] is contrary to the divine plan of the
[52:19] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Praise God. Praise God.

[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; All that the people are looking for is
[52:55] the word.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They just want to get the word and
[52:59] the word will take care of everything.
[53:00] So, welcome to spoken word tabernacle to
[53:03] our convention tonight on a Wednesday.
[53:06] Everybody's clear with the instructions.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Waiting on the coming of the Lord.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you need to fix, you fix it.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; If you need the Holy Ghost, get the Holy
[53:17] Ghost.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; If you get the Holy Ghost, then you keep
[53:20] your eyes in Jesus Christ. But remember
[53:22] the instruction of Jeremiah. Not
[53:25] Jeremiah over there, but Jeremiah in the
[53:27] present time.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We building houses, looking at the
[53:32] coming of the Lord. We getting married,
[53:34] looking at the coming of the Lord. We
[53:36] planting potato, looking at the coming
[53:38] of the Lord. Whatever you plan, looking
[53:40] at the coming of the Lord. The day he
[53:41] showed up, we drop everything and we go.
[53:44] Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't go to one end or the other.
[53:48] Brother Brandham say do not do that
[53:50] because that will get you so cultish and
[53:53] people will call you a cult because you
[53:55] don't you not normal. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Be normal. Leave normal. Christian not
[54:00] normal
[54:01] &gt;&gt; and Abraham was normal.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Jacob was normal.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Joseph was normal. If you still don't
[54:08] say amen. Jesus was normal.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; He was normal. Brother Brandham say he
[54:16] didn't even speak a high Hebrew.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; He speak a common language until the
[54:21] common people heard him gladly. That's
[54:25] what the Bible say. He was a normal man.
[54:27] He even have a headache.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus was praying.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus was hungry.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus was tired sleeping on the boat.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; 100% God.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And 100% man. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; On the inside, we are redeemed. This
[54:47] body still need to be brought under
[54:49] subjection. Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; When we go to heaven, we get a body
[54:54] change. Then you don't have to worry
[54:56] about anything anymore because over
[54:58] there you will see the devil and just
[55:00] laugh and keep moving around.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, you will see him in
[55:04] the millennium for a thousand years and
[55:06] he won't do anything to you. No
[55:08] sickness, nothing. You just watch. You
[55:10] say, "My friend, stay here. watch me for
[55:13] one day for a thousand years.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without you doing anything. So
[55:18] when we wake up in the morning, we sing
[55:20] I got a sword in my hand and the devil
[55:22] is ready.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Let's keep the balance in the middle of
[55:31] the road and move forward. And after I
[55:34] preach, I heard people that when we are
[55:36] getting uh when they were getting closer
[55:38] to 77, some stop. They say they won't go
[55:41] to school. Some stop. They say they will
[55:44] quit doing this, doing this. And 77
[55:46] happened.
[55:48] And 77 passed. And then they say 2000
[55:52] the computer will crash.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And then 2000 pass. And then they say,
[55:56] well, what's happening now? It is 117 of
[56:00] Ephesis. He passed.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Oh well, the American pope, he came.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I don't know what you're
[56:07] waiting for. California or something. Be
[56:09] ready. All right.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for California.
[56:12] Be ready. Let California find you ready.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Not you waiting for California and say,
[56:20] "Okay, now California is done. Let's go
[56:22] seek for the Holy Ghost." No, no, no,
[56:23] no, no. Seek for the Holy Ghost right
[56:25] now. Because when you eating the lamb,
[56:28] you must eat the lamb with your shoes
[56:30] on, with your belt on. In other words,
[56:32] you ready whenever it's time to go, you
[56:35] drop that lamb or that lamb chop,
[56:37] whatever it is, drop it and you go back
[56:39] and you go straight to heaven. Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I apologize for the young
[56:46] man, but something came up really big
[56:48] that we we don't have any choice because
[56:51] it's an elder right at the corner here
[56:53] in South Carolina. The funeral of Sister
[56:55] Henderson is on Saturday at 100 p.m.
[56:59] That's when they put it. The viewing is
[57:00] on Friday. The funeral is on Saturday.
[57:03] This is not somebody far away. This is
[57:05] an elder rod here at the corner in
[57:08] couple hours only. So we apologize. I
[57:11] know you got your schedule. You are
[57:13] grown up. You young man. You also have
[57:15] your your plan and everything. We plan
[57:18] for this coming Saturday, but we
[57:20] apologize. We got to shift that quickly
[57:22] and try to insert it. The deacon are
[57:25] working quickly to see if the 8th of
[57:28] November will work. So we will allow
[57:30] some people to go there and support the
[57:33] family and show uh the support to
[57:36] brother Anderson because this is a big
[57:38] loss. It's a pastor's wife that have
[57:41] gone to be with the Lord. Amen. So we
[57:44] apologize. Just hold tight. We will try
[57:46] to squeeze you somewhere quickly and
[57:48] then we pick up. I don't know if the ETH
[57:50] will work. So respond quickly to the
[57:52] deacon so we know. Don't wait till you
[57:55] look. I mean sometime you send messages
[57:57] and people are going to answer after 4
[57:59] days. Some are getting on WhatsApp.
[58:01] They're looking at something else but
[58:02] they don't check the and I know how to
[58:04] check stuff. I'm I'm a pastor in the
[58:07] present time. I'm not an old fashioned.
[58:09] I learned some some stuff. I can tell
[58:11] who's reading the message and who's not
[58:14] reading the message. So, but I can tell
[58:16] you were on WhatsApp. You read something
[58:18] else, but you didn't read the church
[58:20] message.
[58:25] Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; So, make sure when you get to check your
[58:28] messages, check the church messages.
[58:30] Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I send a church message today. I
[58:34] put it on a on a musician chat. I put it
[58:37] on the whole church. I put it on on the
[58:39] young people. So, don't come and tell me
[58:41] you miss it because it's three platform.
[58:43] I made sure it's there. If you don't
[58:46] look at that, I will send you directly
[58:48] the message. I will deliver the message
[58:50] directly to you. And then if you see my
[58:53] message directly, just know it means you
[58:55] didn't read the message. So I don't want
[58:57] you to come with an excuse and say I was
[58:59] not aware because the police officer
[59:02] will give you a ticket.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Not the police officer on the street. We
[59:06] got a police officer. We got a deacon
[59:08] right here who is a police officer.
[59:10] Amen. So don't get mad on the deacon
[59:13] when you didn't read the message. So
[59:14] read the message. Stay on top. Make sure
[59:17] everything is good. And let's honor the
[59:19] sanctuary of the Lord. Anything else
[59:22] outside in the sanctuary, whether you in
[59:25] the bathroom, it's still the sanctuary.
[59:27] It's the building of God. Whether you on
[59:28] the sound booth or wherever you are,
[59:30] even right here, whenever we open it,
[59:32] just know it is God. Whether there is no
[59:35] one here in this building, you are
[59:37] alone. Be careful what you're doing
[59:40] because God is here. Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say in places
[59:45] like the churches angel stays right
[59:47] there. So get to get a blessing and not
[59:50] get there to get a whooping. Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm not preaching tonight.
[59:56] Brother JM is preaching tonight. So this
[59:59] month we got home folks back to back.
[1:00:01] Amen. So I told him to preach. Preach
[1:00:04] like home and preach with full of energy
[1:00:07] and we're going to pull on the gift of
[1:00:08] the Lord. Amen. Let's go. We firmly
[1:00:11] believe.

[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe tonight?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you all church. Thank you
[1:02:24] musicians
[1:02:27] and thank you the pastor for this
[1:02:29] privilege.
[1:02:38] Without taking any time, if we could
[1:02:42] go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:02:45] Lord, heavenly father, we come before
[1:02:47] you, Lord Jesus Christ, this evening,
[1:02:48] Lord God, to thank you for your grace,
[1:02:50] for your love, for your mercy, Lord
[1:02:52] Jesus Christ, for protecting us in the
[1:02:53] highways and byways, for giving us the
[1:02:56] breath of life, and for bringing us
[1:02:57] here, Lord Jesus Christ, tonight to not
[1:02:59] hear from a man, but from to hear from
[1:03:01] you, Lord, heavenly father. May you use
[1:03:03] me Lord heavenly father. May you use me
[1:03:05] to fulfill your purpose lord Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ to recharge your people Lord God
[1:03:09] and to speak to your people Lord God.
[1:03:11] That's why Lord heavenly father we came
[1:03:13] here Lord God. Even I myself also Lord
[1:03:15] God came here to hear from you. Not from
[1:03:18] a man but to hear from you Lord God for
[1:03:20] the hour come Lord Jesus Christ for you
[1:03:22] to just have your liberty Lord God and
[1:03:24] bring your word forth Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] and restore us Lord heavenly father.
[1:03:28] because it's by the preaching of the
[1:03:30] word that we're being restored. In Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ's name, I bend the remaining of
[1:03:33] the service unto you. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:37] If we could go to
[1:03:39] our scripture
[1:03:43] in Exodus
[1:03:45] chapter 3
[1:04:07] If you dare, can you say amen?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Exodus chapter 3 verse 13 and 14.
[1:04:13] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I
[1:04:17] come unto the children of Israel, and
[1:04:20] shall
[1:04:22] and shall say unto them, the God of your
[1:04:25] fathers have sent me unto you, and they
[1:04:28] and they shall say to me, what is his
[1:04:31] name? What shall I say unto them? And
[1:04:36] God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And
[1:04:40] he said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the
[1:04:43] children of Israel, I am have sent me
[1:04:46] unto you."
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; As you're standing, if we could also go
[1:04:50] to
[1:04:52] second Peter
[1:05:19] If you're there, can you say amen?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Second Peter chapter one.
[1:05:26] The scripture reads this. But there was
[1:05:31] chapter one. Simon Peter verse one.
[1:05:34] Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of
[1:05:37] Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained
[1:05:40] like precious faith with us through the
[1:05:43] righteousness of God and our savior
[1:05:45] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[1:05:48] multiplied unto you through the
[1:05:50] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[1:05:53] according as his divine power have given
[1:05:57] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:06:01] life and godliness. Amen. through the
[1:06:03] knowledge of him that have called us to
[1:06:06] glory and virtue, whereby are given unto
[1:06:10] us exceeding
[1:06:12] exceeding great and precious promises,
[1:06:15] that by these ye might be partaker of
[1:06:19] the divine nature, having escaped the
[1:06:21] corruption of corruption that is in the
[1:06:24] world through lust. May the Lord God
[1:06:27] bless the reading of his word. You may
[1:06:28] be seated.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] My subject tonight is Jehovah Elle, the
[1:06:34] immor.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; And
[1:06:38] I I wanted to talk about this because I
[1:06:41] remember I looked up the term Jehovah.
[1:06:44] Jehovah means I am. And in certain
[1:06:47] translations,
[1:06:49] uh it also means I am becoming. And I
[1:06:51] wanted to use both of those to speak on
[1:06:54] Jehovah I am which is present in Jehovah
[1:06:56] I am becoming. And the morphe speaks
[1:06:59] about
[1:07:01] a change but not a change of God
[1:07:04] actually changing because the law of God
[1:07:06] doesn't change and but it's a change of
[1:07:09] um masking.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. and Jehovah. The thing about being
[1:07:15] I am as you read in the scripture of
[1:07:17] second Peter, it says that according if
[1:07:20] you go to verse
[1:07:23] three, according as his divine power
[1:07:26] have given unto us all things that
[1:07:28] pertain unto life. Whenever I read this
[1:07:31] scripture, there was something that
[1:07:32] always came to me because I remember one
[1:07:33] time I was watching a certain something
[1:07:35] and that scripture kept coming to me and
[1:07:37] I remember I went to the pastor and I
[1:07:38] get and I spoke to him about it that all
[1:07:41] things pertaining onto life and onto
[1:07:44] godliness. God has already pul in you.
[1:07:48] That mean everything that you need in
[1:07:49] life God has already placed it within
[1:07:52] you. If you remember even the uh Sunday
[1:07:55] that passed when when uh the word was
[1:07:58] coming forth it was talking when God
[1:07:59] told the Israelite that you should build
[1:08:01] houses but they were prisoners they had
[1:08:04] nothing. How can you build something
[1:08:06] that mean there was something inside of
[1:08:07] them? What they're building is coming
[1:08:09] from within. That's right.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; I also wanted if we could go to Matthew
[1:08:17] chapter 25,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 25.
[1:08:35] If you're there, you can say, "Amen."
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] Matthew 25:31
[1:08:46] for the scriptures.
[1:08:59] Sorry, it's like the page is stuck
[1:09:01] between two page.
[1:09:06] Verse 31.
[1:09:08] When the Son of man shall come in his
[1:09:11] glory, and all the holy angels with him,
[1:09:14] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:09:16] glory, and before him shall be gathered
[1:09:20] all the nations, and he shall separate
[1:09:22] them one from another, as a shepherd
[1:09:25] divideth his sheep from the goats. And
[1:09:29] he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:09:31] hand, but the goats on his left.
[1:09:35] Then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:09:39] right hand, come ye blessed of my
[1:09:42] father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
[1:09:45] you from the foundation of the world.
[1:09:47] See, we see that the kingdom was already
[1:09:50] prepared from the foundation of the
[1:09:51] world. That mean before you were born,
[1:09:53] it was already prepared.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; For I was for I was a hungered and ye
[1:09:59] gave me me. I was thirsty and you gave
[1:10:02] me drink. and I was a stranger and you
[1:10:05] took me in. Naked and you clothed me. I
[1:10:09] was sick and you vest and you visited
[1:10:11] me. I was in prison and you came unto
[1:10:14] me.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Then shall the righteous answer him,
[1:10:17] saying, Lord, when saw we thee a
[1:10:22] when saw we thee and hungered and fye,
[1:10:25] or thirsty, and give thee drink? When
[1:10:28] saw we thee a stranger and took thee in
[1:10:31] or naked and clothed thee? Or when saw
[1:10:34] we thee sick or in prison and came unto
[1:10:37] thee? The king shall answer and say unto
[1:10:41] them verily I say unto you. In as much
[1:10:44] as ye have done it unto one of the least
[1:10:47] of these my brethren, ye have done it
[1:10:50] unto me.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then shall he say also unto them
[1:10:53] on the left and on the left hand, Depart
[1:10:56] from me, ye cursed it into everlasting
[1:10:59] fire. Prepared for the devil and his
[1:11:02] angels. For I was a hungered and ye have
[1:11:06] gave gave me no meat. I was thirsty and
[1:11:09] ye gave me no drink. I was a stranger
[1:11:12] and ye took me not in. Naked and ye
[1:11:16] clothed me not. Sick in a prison and ye
[1:11:19] visited me not. Then shall they also
[1:11:22] answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
[1:11:26] thee in hungered, or at thirst, or a
[1:11:29] stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
[1:11:31] prison, and did not manif and did not
[1:11:34] minister unto thee. Then shall he answer
[1:11:37] them, saying, Verily I say unto you, and
[1:11:42] as much as ye did, it is as much as ye
[1:11:47] did it not to one of the least of these,
[1:11:50] ye did it not to me. And these shall go
[1:11:53] away into everlasting punishment, but
[1:11:56] the righteous into life eternal.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] And we see here that God saying is
[1:12:03] saying that everything that you're doing
[1:12:05] to his beloved, his children, those that
[1:12:09] came from him, you're doing it unto him.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And everything that you're not doing,
[1:12:15] everything that you're neglecting to do
[1:12:17] and you're also not doing it unto him.
[1:12:20] And brother Brandham speaks, if I could
[1:12:23] go directly to a prophet, he says,
[1:12:26] "God's first appearing to Moses in a
[1:12:28] burning bush veil before the people, God
[1:12:32] veiled again and vindicated Moses by the
[1:12:35] veil by veiling himself with the same
[1:12:37] fire, same pillar of fire came down from
[1:12:41] them. So they could only hear God's
[1:12:44] word." You get it? Just the word. They
[1:12:46] heard his voice. For Moses was to them
[1:12:50] the living word.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Moses, see God had so proven that word
[1:12:56] by Moses. So Moses, God said, Moses, go
[1:13:00] down there. I will be with you. Not
[1:13:03] nothing going to stand before you. I am
[1:13:06] that I am. He's talking about the
[1:13:08] present stand that he is what he is.
[1:13:10] Everything that God because if you
[1:13:12] remember the title is Jehovah Elleon.
[1:13:14] Jehovah meaning I am and Elleon meaning
[1:13:16] the possessor of heaven and earth. That
[1:13:18] mean everything is already within him.
[1:13:21] Everything he already possesses and has
[1:13:23] control over.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Because I am is a state of being. It's
[1:13:27] not really a place or anything but it's
[1:13:29] a state of being. And it speaks of
[1:13:30] something innate uh of a innate ability
[1:13:33] which is something that is within you.
[1:13:36] Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues and says, I
[1:13:40] said, well, it's very easy if you just
[1:13:42] let your own thinking get away. And
[1:13:45] think the Bible terms of it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; They are the selfsame being. God is a
[1:13:50] spirit. Jesus is the body that he was
[1:13:53] veiled in. See, like in in my home to my
[1:13:57] wife, I am her husband and I have a
[1:13:59] young daughter, Rebecca. I am her father
[1:14:02] and I have a grandson and his name is
[1:14:05] Paul. And I am his uh grandfather. I am
[1:14:10] I am a husband, father, grandfather. And
[1:14:12] my wife has no claim on me as a father
[1:14:15] or a grandfather. She has claim on me
[1:14:19] alone as husband. And my daughter has no
[1:14:22] claim on me as a husband or grandfather.
[1:14:26] She is my child. See, but yet all these
[1:14:29] three person is the same person. See
[1:14:32] that's God father, son and holy ghost is
[1:14:35] just the dispensation claim. God is is
[1:14:39] same the same God.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; And what I want to pull from this is the
[1:14:43] fact that God is the same and the
[1:14:45] prophet is saying that he is a father.
[1:14:47] He's a grandfather. He's a husband. He's
[1:14:48] a wife. I remember uh sometime when I
[1:14:50] kind I came up here and I was um
[1:14:54] ministering and sometime I would touch
[1:14:57] couple stuff and some people would get
[1:14:59] on me on that and they would ask me well
[1:15:02] you're saying this and this and you're
[1:15:03] not married and
[1:15:05] and the thing that I like to use as kind
[1:15:08] of like a rebuttal is Paul wasn't
[1:15:10] married you see and he preached on it
[1:15:13] but anyways
[1:15:15] here the prophet is talking about that
[1:15:17] he's a husband He's a father and all
[1:15:20] that etc. It's not really it's something
[1:15:22] that was already built within him. All
[1:15:24] it took was a certain situation for it
[1:15:26] to come out. It took a certain condition
[1:15:29] for it to just manifest itself. That
[1:15:31] mean
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; me also as many other people here to be
[1:15:35] a father to be uh a parent or something.
[1:15:37] It's something that's already within
[1:15:38] you. It takes a certain condition for it
[1:15:41] to just come out. And in that state you
[1:15:44] will become a father. And you becoming a
[1:15:46] father is not you actually changing and
[1:15:48] becoming a father but it's just the
[1:15:49] father in you coming out. You see that's
[1:15:51] the difference. Just like uh the title
[1:15:53] say Jehovah elo and I said they immor
[1:15:56] God God changing a mask. It's not that
[1:15:58] God himself is actually changing. It's
[1:16:01] just that God is always for example
[1:16:03] Jehovah Gyra the provider. God being the
[1:16:06] healer. God is always a healer. But when
[1:16:09] he changes it's not that he's actually
[1:16:11] changing. For example, uh like I said,
[1:16:13] God is always a healer, but maybe he's
[1:16:15] not a healer for you yet, but he can
[1:16:18] become a healer for you, but that
[1:16:19] doesn't mean that he was never a healer
[1:16:21] to begin with. He was always a healer,
[1:16:24] but you were never put in a situation
[1:16:26] for him to become a healer for you
[1:16:28] individually.
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where I want to uh
[1:16:33] draw my inspiration. That's exactly
[1:16:35] where I draw my inspiration from.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues and he says,
[1:16:39] "God changed himself.
[1:16:42] change his form.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; If you notice here in Philippians, he
[1:16:46] said not thinking a robbery but took the
[1:16:50] form of men.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Why? He told even told Moses himself.
[1:16:55] You'll be God and Aaron will be your
[1:16:56] prophet. See, so he come see he had to
[1:17:00] veil himself cuz God is always behind a
[1:17:03] veil. Oh my. Do you see it? God is hid
[1:17:06] from the public. God when he comes when
[1:17:08] God comes in when God comes with um
[1:17:11] treating with mankind he always comes
[1:17:13] behind skin he will come in to treat
[1:17:15] with you behind skin to talk to you he
[1:17:18] has to reveal himself that way so he can
[1:17:20] so you can comprehend him there's also
[1:17:22] um brother Brandon was talking about in
[1:17:24] a certain place where brother Brand was
[1:17:26] talking he said that the reason why God
[1:17:28] has to use men is is the only way we
[1:17:31] could understand it it's the only way we
[1:17:34] could understand it and I believe I the
[1:17:37] quote here.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; It's in the unveiling of God,
[1:17:48] paragraph 79, 1964. It says 1 Timothy
[1:17:52] 3:16, without controversy, great without
[1:17:56] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:17:58] godliness. for God. G O G O D Elohim
[1:18:03] capital G O D in the Bible refers it
[1:18:06] back anybody. It refers to in the
[1:18:09] original it said Elohim in the beginning
[1:18:12] Elohim. See and Elohim without
[1:18:15] controversy great is the mystery of him.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Pardon? Great is the myster is the
[1:18:23] mystery of him. For Elohim was made
[1:18:25] flesh and we handled him. Elohim veil in
[1:18:28] human flesh. The great Jehovah that
[1:18:31] covered all space, time, and everywhere
[1:18:34] was made man. We handled him Elohim. In
[1:18:38] the beginning, Elohim and Elohim was
[1:18:40] made flesh, dwelling among us. What?
[1:18:43] This is his way, the parts of the drama.
[1:18:45] That's that's the way he's to act it
[1:18:48] out.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; His way of revealing himself to us as
[1:18:52] some different person. We are mort we
[1:18:55] are mortals and he knows that and we
[1:18:58] only understand as mortals. We only know
[1:19:02] as mortal. We only know as our senses
[1:19:05] will let us know. And the rest of it we
[1:19:08] have to believe by faith. We have to say
[1:19:11] there is a God whether we see him or
[1:19:14] not. We believe it anyhow. See whether
[1:19:17] there is or not. We still believe it
[1:19:20] because God says so. So God uses man
[1:19:24] because that's the only because we're
[1:19:25] immortals. We're mortals. So God uses
[1:19:27] man because that's the only way we could
[1:19:29] comprehend it. So he came down as as
[1:19:33] Jesus Christ the son he came down so he
[1:19:36] can bring us up because
[1:19:39] uh as brother Brandham gave an I believe
[1:19:42] um
[1:19:44] I believe he gave an analogy of uh
[1:19:48] chimpanzeee or so. He said, "For you to
[1:19:50] be able to give to tell them to build
[1:19:54] houses, you have to become a chimpenzee
[1:19:56] first and you have to teach them from
[1:19:58] them. You can't just be a human. You're
[1:20:00] talking to your chimp's trying to
[1:20:01] educate them to tell them you need to
[1:20:03] build houses and and tell them, oh, the
[1:20:06] houses are used for this, this and etc.
[1:20:08] You can't teach them salvation like that
[1:20:09] because it's almost as a level higher
[1:20:12] than them that they cannot comprehend.
[1:20:13] You have to lower yourself." That's why
[1:20:15] sometime when you're explaining to a
[1:20:16] child, you have to literally lower
[1:20:18] yourself. Sometime you have to talk to
[1:20:19] them eye to eyes for them to comprehend.
[1:20:21] That's why God did he came down as
[1:20:23] humans as mortals because we can only
[1:20:25] understand mortals. He came down as
[1:20:27] mortals to take us so he could bring us
[1:20:29] higher so he can lift us a little bit
[1:20:31] higher.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Now the other thing about Jehovah
[1:20:37] which is the I am because I am like I
[1:20:41] said it's a state of being. It's just
[1:20:43] something that's within that comes in.
[1:20:45] When God was creating heaven and earth,
[1:20:47] when God was creating the universe, he
[1:20:49] was just taking stuff from within, the
[1:20:51] spoken word which came from within and
[1:20:53] he was creating everything. That's why I
[1:20:55] love um the scripture of I believe it's
[1:20:58] Isaiah 45:7 where it speaks about I
[1:21:02] create darkness and I form light. And I
[1:21:04] really like that term I form because
[1:21:05] what helped me really understand it was
[1:21:08] how diamonds are formed because diamonds
[1:21:10] are not something that are technically
[1:21:12] created. They're just formed. There's
[1:21:13] and if use if you look up the um
[1:21:16] definition of the word form it's using
[1:21:18] something that already exist to make
[1:21:20] something new and diamonds are formed
[1:21:22] through pressure and heat and that's
[1:21:25] when a diamonds is created and the thing
[1:21:27] about that scripture why I love this
[1:21:30] because it says light is formed and if
[1:21:32] you remember who is light god is light
[1:21:35] that mean god formed light from within
[1:21:37] himself
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; and everything that god is he poured on
[1:21:42] to the church. Meaning everything that
[1:21:45] God is is within us. That mean we should
[1:21:48] also have the same ability that he has.
[1:21:50] We should not be doubting in our
[1:21:52] everyday life. That's why even um
[1:21:56] if
[1:21:58] uh just give me a second here. If we
[1:22:01] could go to
[1:22:04] Luke, I believe chapter nine.
[1:22:30] If you're there, you can say amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I love chapter 9 verse, let's start
[1:22:35] from
[1:22:38] verse.
[1:22:56] If we go verse 38,
[1:23:02] this was after Jesus healed a child.
[1:23:09] Jesus says, "And he said unto them,
[1:23:11] whosoever shall receive this child in my
[1:23:14] name, receive me, and whosoever shall
[1:23:17] receive me, receive him that sent me.
[1:23:21] For the for he that is least among you,
[1:23:24] all the same shall be great." And this
[1:23:28] is speaking about how God is uh
[1:23:32] revealing or hiding himself in flesh.
[1:23:34] That mean whatever you're doing to one
[1:23:35] another, you're doing it unto God. And
[1:23:37] if you continue say and John answered
[1:23:40] and said unto I mean and John answered
[1:23:42] and said Master we saw one casting out
[1:23:44] devils in thy name and we forbad him
[1:23:47] because he followth not with us. And
[1:23:51] Jesus said unto him forbid him not for
[1:23:54] he have for he that is not against us is
[1:23:58] for us. And it came to pass when the
[1:24:01] time was come that he should be received
[1:24:04] up, he steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:24:07] Jerusalem, and sent messengers before
[1:24:10] his face. And they went and entered into
[1:24:13] a village, and entered into a village of
[1:24:16] Samaritans to make ready for him. And
[1:24:20] they did not receive him, because his
[1:24:22] face was as though he would go to
[1:24:25] Jerusalem. And when his disciples,
[1:24:28] James, John, saw this, they said, "Lord,
[1:24:31] without
[1:24:33] without that we command fire to come
[1:24:36] down from heaven and consume them, even
[1:24:39] as Elias did." But he turned and rebuked
[1:24:42] them, and said, "You know not what
[1:24:45] manner of spirit you are of. For the Son
[1:24:48] of Man is not come to destroy men's
[1:24:51] lives, but to but to save them." And
[1:24:55] Wayne went
[1:24:56] and they went to another village. Now
[1:24:58] what I want you to pull from here
[1:25:02] is that the disciples James and John
[1:25:06] they already they had somewhat an
[1:25:09] understanding of what was already in
[1:25:11] them. They had the understanding that
[1:25:13] they had the power to bring down fire.
[1:25:15] They had the understanding they had the
[1:25:16] power to do stuff by Jesus Christ
[1:25:19] through Jesus Christ them. They already
[1:25:20] knew that the power was within them.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And which is something that I also want
[1:25:27] you to know tonight that you also have
[1:25:29] the power within you.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; As long as you're connected with the
[1:25:33] Lord Jesus Christ, you also have that
[1:25:34] power within you to do whatsoever
[1:25:37] because
[1:25:40] because as the prophet says here,
[1:25:45] I go back.
[1:25:48] Now the Greek word there for the form
[1:25:51] I've been looking at all day yesterday
[1:25:54] trying to trying to think out what it
[1:25:57] was. I find come with this word of
[1:26:00] immor. It's spelled e n m o r p h e.
[1:26:05] Looking in the Greek to find out what
[1:26:08] was. I may pronounce that that wrong but
[1:26:13] but reason I spell it
[1:26:16] when if a tape is released the people
[1:26:19] will scholars will know what I mean by
[1:26:22] he when they immorate that means that he
[1:26:26] changed himself he come down now the
[1:26:29] Greek word there means that something
[1:26:32] that could not be seen yet it's there
[1:26:36] and then it's changed and the eyes can
[1:26:39] catch
[1:26:39] You see that's what is
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; and God has many ways that he change it
[1:26:46] uh he changed his appearance to speak to
[1:26:50] men and
[1:26:52] in 19 um 64 the prophet says and Elijah
[1:26:56] was at do see the servant couldn't see
[1:27:00] all those angels around there and God
[1:27:03] just changed not brought not brought the
[1:27:06] angels down as we were uh during the
[1:27:09] question and answer we found out that
[1:27:10] heaven was already on earth. It's not
[1:27:12] that oh God had to bring heaven down. So
[1:27:14] all he had to do was just reveal it
[1:27:16] change the appearance of it. You see not
[1:27:20] brought the angels down but he changed
[1:27:23] the seeing of the servant and there was
[1:27:26] the mountain full of angels and fire and
[1:27:29] horses of fire and chariots of fire and
[1:27:31] all around his prophet. See they changed
[1:27:34] the seeing the thing is already there.
[1:27:36] And I pray that God may help us so we
[1:27:38] can change our way of seeing things and
[1:27:40] change the way we walk, change the way
[1:27:42] we believe, and to know that everything
[1:27:44] that we need of is already within us and
[1:27:46] is already around us. You see, and that
[1:27:49] God can change and become anything that
[1:27:52] you that you are in need of.
[1:27:54] I remember um prior when I since we're
[1:27:58] traveling through uh cart ship and
[1:28:00] everything in my notes when I was taking
[1:28:03] my own notes I had quoted how can God
[1:28:06] help people in a relationship and
[1:28:10] in that I quoted if you don't know how
[1:28:12] to cook God can become a chef and teach
[1:28:14] you how to cook if you don't know how to
[1:28:16] love God can teach you because God is a
[1:28:19] love God is love and the scripture says
[1:28:21] husband love your your wife as as Christ
[1:28:25] loved the church. That mean God knows
[1:28:26] how to love. If you're lacking in
[1:28:28] something, God is capable to help you in
[1:28:31] your relationship. And that's why I put
[1:28:33] in my note because God can become
[1:28:34] whatever you whatever you're in need of
[1:28:36] him of. Not be not becoming as in he
[1:28:39] wasn't already, but because he already
[1:28:41] was. But he could become what you're in
[1:28:44] need of in that time because he is a
[1:28:46] present God.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] And the prophet says so that what I'm
[1:28:54] trying to say that God always was in
[1:28:58] here the only thing he done when he
[1:29:01] become man he changed his mask. See
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; he this he changed himself to what he
[1:29:10] was to what he is or his mask and
[1:29:14] another and another act. You know
[1:29:16] sometime God could change himself to
[1:29:18] come help you through another brethren
[1:29:20] to another brother and so forth because
[1:29:23] there are many times where you're in
[1:29:24] need of something but you don't know how
[1:29:26] to ask. So you pray to God in private
[1:29:28] and that aid would come through another
[1:29:30] brother. That's right
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; because I had situations like this when
[1:29:34] I needed something. I had the answer but
[1:29:36] I only needed I was missing one specific
[1:29:38] part and I prayed about it and God sent
[1:29:40] someone my way and he gave me the
[1:29:42] answer. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the
[1:29:43] only one. everything that you're
[1:29:47] everything also um sorry if I seem to be
[1:29:51] a bit all over the place it's just the
[1:29:53] word itself it's so a lot that I can't
[1:29:57] try to stay in one place but
[1:30:00] the thing about
[1:30:02] the um Jehovah being the I am and you
[1:30:06] having everything that you need of
[1:30:07] within you
[1:30:09] I want to kind of give I guess is a
[1:30:11] testimony in a sense
[1:30:14] Because
[1:30:16] if you remember the prophet said that in
[1:30:17] this generation with all this invention
[1:30:19] and everything where we should be happy
[1:30:22] and everything but it seems to be like
[1:30:24] the most depressing age of all
[1:30:27] makes the great depression seem like
[1:30:29] child's play. But anyways what's it
[1:30:31] called with all this technology and
[1:30:33] everything there's a certain period if
[1:30:35] you're too invested in it and if you're
[1:30:37] too occupied in it will bring a certain
[1:30:39] type of depression. And I will say there
[1:30:42] was a point in my life where I was yes
[1:30:46] with all the technology and everything
[1:30:47] you would think it would help you at
[1:30:49] certain point. There was a point in my
[1:30:52] life where I was so depressed
[1:30:56] that I was praying to God to just take
[1:30:58] me away. And I remember because usually
[1:31:01] I go for a walk and I go for a walk to
[1:31:04] like free my mind and ponder upon the
[1:31:07] Lord. And as I was walking, I was
[1:31:09] walking and I was like, "Lord God, I'm
[1:31:11] just tired, you know, just take me." And
[1:31:13] this was like during high school or so.
[1:31:16] But anyways, I was like, "Lord God, just
[1:31:17] take me." And as I was saying that
[1:31:20] within my heart, I didn't even speak it
[1:31:21] out. As I was saying that within my
[1:31:22] heart, a car was passing by towards me.
[1:31:26] And I just felt my leg give out. I just
[1:31:30] felt my leg give out. And I was kind of
[1:31:31] like tilting towards that car. And in a
[1:31:34] split second some something else within
[1:31:37] me came up and he was like no and that I
[1:31:39] just felt extraordinary strength just
[1:31:41] came and pulled me the other way. That
[1:31:43] mean everything every situation that
[1:31:46] you're overcoming I mean every situation
[1:31:48] that you're going through you have the
[1:31:50] ability within you to overcome it. And
[1:31:53] all those even depression is just an
[1:31:55] illusion that the devil puts in your
[1:31:56] past to try to compress you and to hold
[1:31:58] you down. And it's something that the
[1:32:00] world has taught people through
[1:32:03] television through all things because
[1:32:06] television is actually
[1:32:09] television and social media etc. They're
[1:32:11] the thing you can use it to access
[1:32:13] heaven. You can also use it to access
[1:32:15] hell. And and it's a very it's a easy
[1:32:18] and fast ticket for you to access hell.
[1:32:20] And hell nowadays it's all over the
[1:32:24] world. Why? Because that's what's being
[1:32:25] promoted. That's literally what's being
[1:32:27] promoted to television. So you shouldn't
[1:32:29] be surprised when you see people coming
[1:32:31] up and you see something that isn't
[1:32:33] right.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Now the point of that is everything that
[1:32:37] you need of is already within you. So
[1:32:40] Santa, me and some beloved Santa, we
[1:32:42] were talking with because the reason why
[1:32:45] I say this because I had many um I had a
[1:32:48] couple colleagues or so
[1:32:51] this year alone who attempted or at
[1:32:53] least thought of committing suicide and
[1:32:56] I spoke to them and I told them that
[1:32:58] it's not something that you should be
[1:33:00] doing. If you're going through
[1:33:01] something, just I told him to contact me
[1:33:04] once, but one, but two, if you're going
[1:33:06] through a trial, it doesn't matter what
[1:33:08] trial you are, God put you in that trial
[1:33:10] because he knows you can overcome it. He
[1:33:12] put you there because he cannot give you
[1:33:14] something that's greater than what you
[1:33:16] are. And as the scripture say,
[1:33:19] everything that you're in need of is
[1:33:20] already within you to overcome. It's
[1:33:22] already within you, placed in you for
[1:33:24] you to overcome. Even when Cainan, a
[1:33:27] seed of the devil, when God punished him
[1:33:29] and it seemed greater than what he could
[1:33:31] bear, he brought it back to God. So if
[1:33:33] there's a trial that you're going
[1:33:35] through and you think it's greater than
[1:33:37] you could bear, you can always go back
[1:33:38] to God. If the child of if the seed of
[1:33:40] the devil can do it, why can't you?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Why can't you? What's stopping you from
[1:33:44] going to God and telling God, "I cannot
[1:33:46] do this." Or what's stopping you to go
[1:33:48] to God and say, "Lord God, because
[1:33:50] before the foundation of the world, God
[1:33:52] had created you. You are a part of God."
[1:33:53] That mean that's that's also another
[1:33:56] thing because whenever they ask you u
[1:33:59] let's say there was a bad situation they
[1:34:00] were that happened that they ask you
[1:34:02] would you have chosen that many people
[1:34:04] say well I would not have chosen that
[1:34:07] and all of that is true but that's only
[1:34:09] true because we're in flesh but if you
[1:34:11] go back up and yonder before the
[1:34:13] foundation of the world you were back
[1:34:14] with God and when God was creating these
[1:34:17] stars where God was creating all these
[1:34:18] things you were there cheering God on
[1:34:20] that mean you were agreeing with God
[1:34:21] placing you in that specific situ
[1:34:23] situation you were agreeing with God
[1:34:25] placing you in that specific time. Your
[1:34:27] theophony was agreeing with it and that
[1:34:30] mean it was already something that was
[1:34:31] within you. That mean it's that's why I
[1:34:34] don't like when people say, "Well, I
[1:34:35] wouldn't have chosen that." Yes, you
[1:34:36] would have because you already chose it.
[1:34:38] All God did was just press play and
[1:34:40] you're just acting it out. It's plain
[1:34:42] and simple. Just like a believer and a
[1:34:44] child of the devil, they already chose
[1:34:46] their faith. Their faith was already
[1:34:47] chosen and you're just walking into it
[1:34:50] now.
[1:34:51] And the only issue is we don't remember
[1:34:54] because we're under amnesia. And there's
[1:34:56] preaching on the word. What it's doing
[1:34:57] is it's removing that amnesia and it's
[1:34:59] reprogramming you. It's reprogramming
[1:35:02] you so you can be back to where you were
[1:35:05] from the beginning of the world.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And I also want to type this to um like
[1:35:11] a coder when you're coding a script.
[1:35:13] When you code a script, the script has
[1:35:15] everything that you're in need of. You
[1:35:17] already put everything in it. All you do
[1:35:19] is just press execute. And when you
[1:35:22] press execute, it will do what
[1:35:24] everything is written in it to do. And
[1:35:27] us human, we're written epistols. God
[1:35:29] already wrote a script for each
[1:35:31] individual one of us in our life. All
[1:35:33] you have to do is just press execute.
[1:35:34] When you go through a trial, just press
[1:35:36] execute. The execute of the word. And
[1:35:38] the Lord God will just bring it out of
[1:35:40] you. And that they act accordingly based
[1:35:42] on the situation that you're going
[1:35:43] through.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to continue with the prophecy,
[1:35:48] it says veil in human flesh. Moses with
[1:35:52] the word speaking what was to be later
[1:35:55] put behind badger skin. So is Christ our
[1:35:59] Moses. Christ is our Moses. He was God
[1:36:03] veiled in human flesh. Veiled in
[1:36:05] humanity. In flesh. That's right. He's
[1:36:09] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:36:12] He was veiled by badger skin. He was
[1:36:14] veiled and this time he was veiled in
[1:36:17] men.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:36:20] Promise his word to this age. He is
[1:36:24] still Christ. The promised word to this
[1:36:27] age veiled in human flesh. The word is
[1:36:29] God. And we have the prophet which God
[1:36:32] used to veil himself in the prophet to
[1:36:35] bring his word for this age.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet continues to says the
[1:36:41] anointing is a person. The word Christ
[1:36:44] means an anointed one. See the anointed
[1:36:47] one. Then Moses was Christ in the in his
[1:36:51] days. He was the anointed one. Jeremiah
[1:36:53] was Christ in his days with a portion of
[1:36:56] the word for that day just as brother
[1:36:58] Brandham is the one for this age.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It says, "But when Jesus came, he came
[1:37:05] as the redeemer anointed one." And that
[1:37:08] was both Moses and all that was in Moses
[1:37:12] and all the word and all of the godhead
[1:37:15] bodily was in him. That's the reason the
[1:37:18] whole temple veil ramp and mercy said
[1:37:21] come in perfect view. He was the
[1:37:23] anointed one.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Notice now the veil in human flesh. The
[1:37:30] promised word to this age must also be
[1:37:33] veiled. Notice sin loving church members
[1:37:37] and sinner cannot see it because of
[1:37:38] human
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; because of human veil
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; and
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I also want to say well when a minister
[1:37:46] comes over here and is ministering
[1:37:48] that's also God veiling himself with
[1:37:50] flesh and bring you the word for that
[1:37:52] day in that in that time in that day
[1:37:54] like as we're going through the season
[1:37:56] and everything that's God bring you the
[1:37:58] the word of the season for your time and
[1:38:00] for your day because the prophet isn't
[1:38:02] here to tell you that directly
[1:38:04] But God sent a a a pastor in the church
[1:38:07] that will tell you to prepare for the
[1:38:09] season. He's there to prepare you for
[1:38:11] what is to come.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in question answer,
[1:38:18] so being a well-trained theo theologian
[1:38:22] had nothing to do with it. Being meek
[1:38:24] gentle had nothing to do with it. What
[1:38:27] made him different? He was the word made
[1:38:29] flesh, not the word for the day of
[1:38:31] Moses. Moses was that word that day that
[1:38:34] day word not the word for the days of
[1:38:37] Noah. Noah was the word for that day.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Not the day not the word for the day of
[1:38:43] Elijah. Elijah was the word for that
[1:38:45] day. But he was the present tense word.
[1:38:48] And they were living in back then. Just
[1:38:51] as brother Brandon, he's the word for
[1:38:52] this day. Everything that he spoke is
[1:38:55] what we're supposed to be living by.
[1:38:57] That's right. and everything that he
[1:38:59] spoke and everything that your pastor
[1:39:01] speak as long as they're aligned with uh
[1:39:03] the prophet of the of the age, it's
[1:39:05] something that you're supposed to be
[1:39:06] living by. If your pastor um brings up
[1:39:09] the standard, you're supposed to also
[1:39:10] bring up the standard because it's
[1:39:11] something that's supposed to help you.
[1:39:13] And the thing is when he brings up the
[1:39:15] standard, it's not something that you're
[1:39:16] incapable of doing. It's something
[1:39:17] that's already within you.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is just remove doubt.
[1:39:21] If you remove doubt from within
[1:39:22] yourself, you're capable of doing all
[1:39:24] things. Because us being born in um in
[1:39:27] this world, it made us be um he put a
[1:39:31] bondage. He put us under bondage. He put
[1:39:33] restrictions on us. He put restrictions
[1:39:35] as we're growing up. We have
[1:39:37] restrictions in our mental aptitude. We
[1:39:40] have restrictions in the way we think,
[1:39:41] in the way we perceive everything, in
[1:39:43] the way we perceive reality. See,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; the way I see it, there's only one
[1:39:48] reality, and that's the way God see it.
[1:39:50] And that's reality. Every every other
[1:39:52] thing when people say, "Well, that's
[1:39:53] your reality." No, that's your
[1:39:54] perspective. That's your opinion. But
[1:39:55] that's not reality. The only true
[1:39:57] reality, there's one reality, and that's
[1:39:59] the reality of God. That is the word of
[1:40:01] God.
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; And
[1:40:12] um
[1:40:21] And the prophet of God said in
[1:40:25] 1950 believed thou this. I said Joseph
[1:40:28] was a man like you and I.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; See Joseph was a man like you and I. But
[1:40:34] God is Jehovah. The spirit of God. The
[1:40:37] spirit that brought over earth. And in
[1:40:42] 1950 who is God? He said who is God? The
[1:40:46] one that stood there and rolled stars
[1:40:49] off of his hands
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and rolled worlds out of his hands and
[1:40:54] made the things which do not appear.
[1:40:58] Deity
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and deity himself lives in man.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; The creator that made heaven and earth
[1:41:05] lives in man. See, God lives in you.
[1:41:08] That's what the scripture um in Psalm 82
[1:41:10] says. Ye are gods and you are the
[1:41:12] children of the most high and everything
[1:41:14] that God is. If God lives in you, even
[1:41:17] if you remember 1% God is still God. If
[1:41:19] if he was 0.0000
[1:41:22] 1% God is still God nonetheless. That
[1:41:24] mean everything that God can do you can
[1:41:26] also do. That mean it's already within
[1:41:28] you. That's why if you look at Moses
[1:41:30] when he met God when he encountered God
[1:41:34] that encounter with God changed his walk
[1:41:36] changed the way he talked and changed
[1:41:37] everything that he did. And when he met
[1:41:39] him the second time again when if you
[1:41:41] remember the scripture his face was
[1:41:43] resonating he was shining. So why is it
[1:41:45] that whenever a believers come to church
[1:41:47] and they're meeting God as God is
[1:41:49] speaking to them, but they're gloomy and
[1:41:51] they're sad and they're not their face
[1:41:52] is not shining, they're not resonating.
[1:41:54] Is shouldn't the light that's within
[1:41:56] you? Shouldn't the light that's within
[1:41:57] you that was already there before the
[1:41:58] foundation of the world, shouldn't it be
[1:42:00] shining through you? Especially in this
[1:42:03] dark age because if you remember that
[1:42:04] laian age is the darkest age of all and
[1:42:08] it being the darkest age of all and you
[1:42:10] being born here you being the seed of
[1:42:12] God shouldn't you be the brightest light
[1:42:14] of all in this darkest age of all
[1:42:16] shouldn't you be manifesting that what
[1:42:18] Moses done is just the type of what we
[1:42:20] should be doing you see
[1:42:23] and brother Brennham says in at thy word
[1:42:26] may every person in here that's bound by
[1:42:30] sensebound existence
[1:42:32] only trusting on what they can see,
[1:42:34] hear, taste, feel, or smell. May they
[1:42:37] fall away from that tonight. Go up into
[1:42:40] the realms of the higher and may this
[1:42:43] church literally rock with the power of
[1:42:46] God.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; And he also says in the resurrection,
[1:42:50] God take us away from this sense bound
[1:42:53] existence. Carry us out there in those
[1:42:56] realms where all things are possible.
[1:42:59] Remember, because everything that you're
[1:43:00] in need of is already within you. So,
[1:43:02] the only thing that's blocking you is
[1:43:04] your carnal body. It's your body, is
[1:43:06] your flesh. If you could just come above
[1:43:08] the the the um senses, if you could come
[1:43:11] above the senses of the body and tap
[1:43:14] into that potential, that unlimited
[1:43:16] omnipotent potential that's within you
[1:43:19] and you can manifest anything that's
[1:43:21] that you're in dream of, anything that
[1:43:23] you desire. It could be anything in your
[1:43:25] life, anything, any um situation. It
[1:43:27] could be a car. It could be a It could
[1:43:28] be anything that you're in desire of.
[1:43:30] Because if you remember the prophet had
[1:43:32] told the Israelites that
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; that built houses while they were
[1:43:36] prisoner where they had nothing but from
[1:43:38] within them there was already houses.
[1:43:40] They had the ability to build house.
[1:43:42] They had the ability to do all those
[1:43:44] things that it wasn't something that was
[1:43:45] out of reach. And in this age, if you're
[1:43:48] in need of something, if you see
[1:43:49] yourself that there's a strong desire in
[1:43:51] you to do something because remember the
[1:43:52] deep call is onto the deep. If there's a
[1:43:55] deep calling onto something, that mean
[1:43:57] there's a deep somewhere to respond.
[1:43:58] That mean there's already a desire in
[1:44:00] you. There's already an ability and
[1:44:02] there's already an ability within you to
[1:44:04] manifest your desire to manifest that
[1:44:06] pull that's within you.
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:13] Now
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I want to read uh brother Brandham here
[1:44:23] real quick.
[1:44:37] In
[1:44:39] the mighty in
[1:44:41] 1948 at thy word Lord paragraph 22
[1:44:45] brother Brand says this when he met
[1:44:47] Abraham sixth chapter of Genesis back
[1:44:50] there he met him in the name of Jehovah
[1:44:54] of God the Almighty. Now the word in
[1:44:57] Hebrew is from the word Elsh Shadai
[1:45:00] which means the breast the nourishing
[1:45:02] like the woman nourishing nourishes her
[1:45:05] baby. Abraham was 90 and 90 99 years
[1:45:09] old.
[1:45:11] No children. His wife Sarah was past 80.
[1:45:15] They had no children. But God told him,
[1:45:18] "I am El Shadai. I am
[1:45:22] I am the breast. The I am the breast.
[1:45:25] I'm the Almighty." In other words, no
[1:45:27] matter how weak you are,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I can nourish you back to health again.
[1:45:33] Hallelujah.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; He's still almighty God. He's El Shadai
[1:45:36] tonight. You You say I'm old, brother
[1:45:39] Brennan. It's healing for me. Yes. Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It's whatsoever will let him come. You
[1:45:46] say I belong to Methodist. I can't.
[1:45:50] Excuse me. He say I belong to Methodist.
[1:45:52] Brother Brendom says I don't care. I
[1:45:55] don't care where you belong. Healing is
[1:45:57] for you. If you believe it, El Shadai
[1:46:00] the Almighty. Let down the net. Lord,
[1:46:03] you shall you say, "Well, I'm old. Well,
[1:46:07] I've had this infirmity, this female
[1:46:10] trouble. I've had this for years and
[1:46:12] years, and I've tried doctors and
[1:46:14] everything, but at thy word, Lord, I
[1:46:16] will let down the net." You see,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; the Lord God can become whatever you're
[1:46:21] in need of him in your life.
[1:46:25] And also as
[1:46:28] as uh
[1:46:30] another thing is yes the Lord God can
[1:46:32] become anything that you're in need of
[1:46:33] it as your life but you also have to be
[1:46:35] sensitive and very observant because
[1:46:38] sometime God can use another man God can
[1:46:41] use another person to come and aid you
[1:46:42] one way or the other just as he used
[1:46:45] Peter and just the shadows of the
[1:46:46] disciples will heal uh people that was
[1:46:49] God using men to save other people it's
[1:46:52] still Jehovah healing ing people is
[1:46:54] still Jehovah doing manifesting those
[1:46:56] acts. It's still Jesus in the scene but
[1:46:59] just hiding behind man becoming someone
[1:47:01] becoming flesh to help out one another.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] And the other beautiful thing about not
[1:47:09] just becoming and because I'm switching
[1:47:11] between two um subject back and forth
[1:47:15] but the other beautiful thing about it
[1:47:17] is if you look at the story of Job
[1:47:20] throughout um
[1:47:23] when God called Satan to come to Job
[1:47:25] after that God was talking to Satan and
[1:47:27] he said he God putting restrictions he
[1:47:30] said you can touch everything you can
[1:47:32] take everything that he possesses but
[1:47:34] leave him alone. Why? Because everything
[1:47:37] to restore everything that he possesses
[1:47:39] was already within Job. You see, it was
[1:47:41] already within him. And God knew that if
[1:47:44] he could leave Job alone and just take
[1:47:46] everything else, God could restore it
[1:47:47] within Job
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; because later on the double portion came
[1:47:51] because through obedience, God restored
[1:47:52] everything else.
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's why God did not let Satan touch
[1:47:59] Job because everything is within Job.
[1:48:01] Everything is already in there. God
[1:48:03] himself, a piece of God is in there. So
[1:48:05] he cannot let the devil touch that.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; If the musician could come
[1:48:16] trying to close here in 1964, the mighty
[1:48:20] God unveiled before us paragraph 209.
[1:48:24] I'm telling you, when you break that
[1:48:27] traditional barrier that Jesus is way
[1:48:31] back and he isn't now,
[1:48:34] When you find he's the same yesterday,
[1:48:37] today, and forever,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; there's no limit to what God could do
[1:48:42] right here in this convention. Remember,
[1:48:45] Wednesday is a convention, right? Then
[1:48:47] there's nothing there's nothing God
[1:48:51] could do right here in this convention.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And show his world, show this world what
[1:48:56] they need. Not a world's affair, but a
[1:49:00] world revival that will be fulfilled and
[1:49:02] baptized with the presence of the living
[1:49:04] God and immorate inve
[1:49:13] every every veil, every veil. Nothing
[1:49:16] could hide his presence. When people
[1:49:18] gets hungry in their heart, there's a
[1:49:20] veil ready to be broke. You can just
[1:49:23] depend on that. rent and revail by his
[1:49:26] great holy spirit.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:49:31] the thing about um
[1:49:35] the I am God being the I am and you also
[1:49:38] because you being the child of God
[1:49:40] everything that he is you also are. That
[1:49:42] mean you should also be the I am. You
[1:49:44] should also have God in you because God
[1:49:45] is in you. You should also be the I am.
[1:49:48] Why do I say this? Because brother
[1:49:49] Brennham when it came to creating
[1:49:51] squirrel that power came from within him
[1:49:53] and he created squirrel in what he
[1:49:54] needed and sometime like I said earlier
[1:49:57] sometime certain situation you may need
[1:50:00] something and God can become that answer
[1:50:02] for you but you don't know it's within
[1:50:04] you sometime you think how am I going to
[1:50:06] come out of this how am I going to come
[1:50:07] out of this but you always come out of
[1:50:09] it how am I going to respond to this how
[1:50:11] am I going to respond to this but the
[1:50:13] right answer usually always come like
[1:50:15] sister auntie right she didn't know what
[1:50:17] to say she didn't know how to say, but
[1:50:19] when the time came, something within her
[1:50:21] spoke within her. It's not something
[1:50:22] that because within herself, she didn't
[1:50:24] know what to pick, but something else
[1:50:26] within her knew what to say and spoke
[1:50:28] what needed to be said.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; So, the message I want you to take home
[1:50:32] for tonight is that God, the I am, he's
[1:50:36] the one that is becoming and not
[1:50:38] becoming because he wasn't, but becoming
[1:50:40] because you're in need of it now. So, he
[1:50:43] becomes that for you now because he's a
[1:50:45] present time God. And he's a god that's
[1:50:48] always there for you. And he can use
[1:50:50] either man or he can use the other ways
[1:50:53] to come and interact with you.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; If we could all stand.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; If we could b our heart and go to God in
[1:51:08] prayer.
[1:51:11] Lord heavenly father I come before you.
[1:51:13] Lord heavenly father. Thank you for this
[1:51:15] Wednesday service. Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:16] that you call conviction. Thank you for
[1:51:18] this time Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:51:19] took to come and speak to us Lord
[1:51:20] heavenly father. Lord God I pray Lord
[1:51:23] heavenly father what was preached Lord
[1:51:25] Jesus Christ may you reveal even more
[1:51:26] unto your children Lord heavenly father.
[1:51:28] For Lord God Lord God you're the God
[1:51:31] that's always there that's always
[1:51:32] present that's always helping us in
[1:51:34] every situation that we need. Even when
[1:51:36] it seems to be hopeless Lord God you're
[1:51:38] always there to help us Lord. Even when
[1:51:40] we seem Lord Jesus to seem to give up
[1:51:42] Lord Jesus. You say you will never leave
[1:51:44] us nor forsake us, Lord heavenly father.
[1:51:46] For Lord heavenly father, you have your
[1:51:48] angel encamped around us, Lord Jesus
[1:51:50] Christ. That's even to vindicate even
[1:51:52] the more Lord heavenly father. The
[1:51:53] scripture that says everything that
[1:51:54] we're in need of to live a godly life is
[1:51:56] already within us Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51:58] Everything that we need of Lord heavenly
[1:52:00] father to live a godly life Lord God.
[1:52:02] You already gave it unto us Lord Jesus
[1:52:04] Christ. Even the protection Lord Jesus
[1:52:06] Christ. That's why you even have angels
[1:52:07] camp around us Lord Jesus Christ. Oh
[1:52:09] Lord God may you help us Lord Jesus
[1:52:12] Christ. just access Lord Jesus Christ to
[1:52:14] that ability that you put within us Lord
[1:52:16] Jesus Christ to p to that hardware Lord

[1:52:30] may let you use us Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:52:32] ways that you desire Lord God. Lord
[1:52:35] heavenly father we pray that you may
[1:52:36] just wake us up. We pray that you may
[1:52:38] just wake the innate of us up, Lord
[1:52:41] heavenly father. Just like the little
[1:52:43] duckies that the prophet spoke about,
[1:52:44] Lord heavenly father, they didn't know
[1:52:47] how to swim, but yet they knew how to
[1:52:48] swim, Lord Jesus Christ. Rather, they
[1:52:50] never swam before, but when they went on
[1:52:51] water, they just knew how to swim. It
[1:52:52] was something that was already built
[1:52:53] inside them, Lord God. And I pray Lord
[1:52:55] heavenly father as we cross trials Lord
[1:52:57] Jesus Christ may we come to realization
[1:53:00] Lord God that every trials Lord heavenly
[1:53:02] father that we that comes across our
[1:53:04] path Lord God that we're already built
[1:53:06] to overcome it Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:53:08] that power to overcome those trials is
[1:53:11] already within us Lord God. If there's
[1:53:12] anyone among us Lord Jesus God that's in
[1:53:15] need of prayer that's in need of
[1:53:16] sickness Lord Jesus Christ that's that's
[1:53:18] in need of healing for our sickness Lord
[1:53:20] God may become the healer for her Lord
[1:53:22] God. If there's anyone Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:24] longing for something Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:25] may you become that something Lord Jesus
[1:53:27] Christ may you provide it to them Lord
[1:53:29] our heavenly father one way or the other
[1:53:31] Lord heavenly father Lord God we come to
[1:53:34] you Lord Jesus Christ abandoned service
[1:53:36] unto you abandoned life Lord Jesus
[1:53:38] Christ of our dear brothers and sisters

[1:53:41] invisible Lord God I just simply abandon
[1:53:43] everything onto you Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:45] lead us in the highways and by and
[1:53:47] byways Lord Jesus Christ I pray Lord
[1:53:49] heavenly father that you just continue
[1:53:51] to unfold Hold yourself unto us and
[1:53:53] continue to help us reflect you Lord
[1:53:56] heavenly father as a diamond reflects
[1:53:58] Lord Jesus Christ every light Lord Jesus
[1:54:00] Christ. It reflects it Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:02] even the white light and every color
[1:54:03] Lord heavenly father. We wish to reflect

[1:54:06] Help us be like diamonds Lord Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ to reflect you Lord God. I pray
[1:54:10] that you may help us Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:54:12] Be a blessing to everyone around us Lord
[1:54:14] Jesus Christ. You spoke about how Lord
[1:54:17] Jesus Christ
[1:54:19] our enemies can become a blessing to us
[1:54:20] Lord Jesus Christ. But how about us
[1:54:22] becoming a blessing to each other Lord
[1:54:24] heavenly father. I pray that you may
[1:54:25] help us be a blessing to one another to
[1:54:27] help each other go up Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:29] to bring each other higher Lord Jesus
[1:54:31] Christ. Bring each other higher by your
[1:54:32] word Lord heavenly father. For Lord
[1:54:34] heavenly father you knew us before the
[1:54:36] foundation of the earth Lord Jesus
[1:54:38] Christ. And Lord heavenly father before
[1:54:40] the foundation of earth you chose to
[1:54:41] place us here Lord God because you knew
[1:54:43] what was in us Lord Jesus Christ. You
[1:54:44] knew what you placed in us Lord heavenly
[1:54:46] father. And but yet Lord heavenly father
[1:54:49] we find ourel in a state where we do not
[1:54:52] know Lord Jesus Christ or rather we do
[1:54:53] not remember what is in us Lord Jesus
[1:54:55] Christ and we seem to have this deluded
[1:54:58] imagination that we cannot access it
[1:55:00] Lord Jesus Christ that we cannot access
[1:55:02] you Lord Jesus Christ that you're far
[1:55:03] away but Lord God you just came for
[1:55:06] telling us that you that you're the I am
[1:55:07] you're present you're in our midst
[1:55:09] you're within us Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:55:11] you're the one that's helping us move
[1:55:13] forward Lord God wherever we stop that's
[1:55:15] where you begin Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:55:17] pray that you may help us, Lord Jesus
[1:55:19] Christ, that you may give us energy,
[1:55:20] that you may replenish us in all ways,
[1:55:22] Lord Jesus Christ. Just help us, Lord
[1:55:24] Jesus Christ. I thank you in Jesus
[1:55:26] Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[1:55:31] If the pastor could come up,
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:39] Praise God. Amen.
[1:55:42] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a big
[1:55:45] clap offering.
[1:55:49] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:55:53] Everything you have need of his where?
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; In you.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; In you. God is lleon, but he's also I
[1:56:00] am.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Why is he I am when he's lleon.
[1:56:07] Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Did you get that really well? Amen. And
[1:56:13] lleon.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay away from ministering
[1:56:20] because you already get it. Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:56:31] Amen.
[1:56:33] This is Elle Leon.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Everything is here.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Because this one is a possessor of
[1:56:45] heaven
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; and earth. Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; But Elle Leon need to be I am.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] Amen.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Note everything that is in God,
[1:57:04] you need it
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; right now.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; You cannot access pregnancy here if you
[1:57:13] a man.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:57:19] You can ask God a child. Amen. But to
[1:57:23] bury a pregnancy only a sister can go
[1:57:25] right here
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; and draw that from God.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; So for to you he can become a father.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; But for your wife he can become a
[1:57:39] mother.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; So he's the big source of everything.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; But he need to become what you're
[1:57:50] looking for.
[1:57:51] He need to become your life
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; and your life is different than somebody
[1:57:56] else life.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, for you it's a healing
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; but for somebody it's not a healing
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; because they are in good health. He need
[1:58:06] to be I am for that person but to be I
[1:58:10] am in providing.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But for you it's I am in a
[1:58:16] healing.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; For you it's I am in a deliverance. But
[1:58:20] the same I am is
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Elle Leon.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; He possess everything.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; But he need to become what you want him
[1:58:27] to become.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He can be your wisdom.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; He can be your sanctification. He can be
[1:58:34] your Holy Ghost. He can be your
[1:58:36] strength. He can be your wealth.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He can become your husband.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:45] He need to become the I am
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; the God of the present time,
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; the God of the present moment,
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; the God of the present situation you are
[1:58:56] going through right now.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; He can become that God. But he always
[1:59:01] been that God,
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; but he just need to be manifested again.
[1:59:06] And it takes certain circumstances in
[1:59:08] your life to bring that specific desire
[1:59:11] that you're looking for at that specific
[1:59:14] time in your life. Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; He's lleon his I am. He's just
[1:59:19] immorphing. He's just manifesting,
[1:59:22] bringing to pass what you have need of.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; We need to break away from our
[1:59:28] traditional bears.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Especially if you want to follow this
[1:59:32] message. If you want to follow this
[1:59:35] message and you rigid in your old ways,
[1:59:38] you're going to have big trouble because
[1:59:40] God is pushing people toward the third
[1:59:42] pool.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; And the third pool will make us think
[1:59:45] the impossible and believe the
[1:59:47] impossible.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; So if you already have God in the box of
[1:59:51] religion, you will suffer, especially in
[1:59:54] this church.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in this church, we keep
[1:59:58] pushing.
[2:00:00] In other word, as long as you're still
[2:00:02] living in this earth, you got something
[2:00:04] to do.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; If your mission is finished, God will
[2:00:08] take you home.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; If you're still here, it means you still
[2:00:11] need God.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; There are still things that you have not
[2:00:14] finished yet.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Even if you quit your job, you still
[2:00:17] have something to do.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Even if you retired, you still have
[2:00:21] something to do.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; If you say you're too old, God used
[2:00:24] Moses in which age?
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say God can
[2:00:30] prepare you and to use you on you for a
[2:00:32] short period of time. Do you know how
[2:00:34] long John the Baptist preached in six
[2:00:37] months and his ministry was finished?
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; So God put him to the bush to the forest
[2:00:42] to use him six month and that was it.
[2:00:45] And the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[2:00:46] preached how long?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Three and a half years. Look at how long
[2:00:50] our pastors stay preaching.
[2:00:54] Are we together? From years and years
[2:00:57] and years. When the creator of heaven
[2:00:59] himself just preached three and a half
[2:01:02] year and he say it is finished.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; So God built that whole masterpiece
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; for three years and a half that say
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Break your traditional way of thinking.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; We cannot believe a God of impossible
[2:01:22] while we behaving like God is not the
[2:01:25] God of impossible. The way we behaving
[2:01:27] prove that we don't believe it.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Because when we bring you something that
[2:01:32] is beyond your your your understanding,
[2:01:35] you begin to reason it out. You begin to
[2:01:37] fight back. No, no, no, no. I don't
[2:01:39] think this is it. No, it's God pushing
[2:01:41] you off the limit. Brother Brandham say
[2:01:43] our extremities are God opportunities.
[2:01:47] Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham say if you
[2:01:51] don't have a faith for your healing,
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; how are you going to have faith for the
[2:01:56] translation of the Bible? I don't know
[2:01:57] if we realize what we doing in this
[2:01:59] message.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We talking about one day being
[2:02:03] changed and crossing the wall. Do you
[2:02:06] think it's a game
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; and then you can't believe for a
[2:02:09] headache?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God have to train you little by
[2:02:15] little one thing after the other and he
[2:02:18] begin to increase your faith when you
[2:02:19] have a testimony next testimony next
[2:02:22] testimony next testimony before you know
[2:02:25] it when they say believe on the body
[2:02:27] change it won't be any problem because
[2:02:29] you already have experienced God all day
[2:02:32] long. Amen.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; He's lleon. He's also the I am. Whatever
[2:02:38] you have need of is right in you. All it
[2:02:40] takes is a certain circumstances to
[2:02:43] bring what you're looking for out. Amen.
[2:02:46] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:02:49] are approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:02:51] Father, thanking you again for your
[2:02:53] grace, for your love, your mercy, for
[2:02:55] speaking to our soul tonight and
[2:02:58] insisting in the I am Lord. Lord,
[2:03:02] sometime we get frustrated, we get
[2:03:04] discouraged, we get upset, we are tired,
[2:03:09] we feel like we don't want to push out
[2:03:12] because Lord Father, we realize that we
[2:03:15] stuck somewhere and our mind, our
[2:03:18] reasoning have reached its own limit,
[2:03:20] Lord. But Lord, Father, you are always
[2:03:24] that present help in the time of
[2:03:26] trouble. You are always the I the amen.
[2:03:30] Whenever we going through a certain
[2:03:31] situation, note that you have become.
[2:03:34] You always been there, Lord. You always
[2:03:37] been the possessor, the mighty
[2:03:39] conqueror, the God who created heaven
[2:03:41] and earth, the God who our
[2:03:43] sanctification, our healing, the lamb of
[2:03:46] God that was slain before the foundation
[2:03:48] of the world. You are everything that we
[2:03:51] have need of. And you have been that
[2:03:53] before the foundation of the world.
[2:03:55] You're just bringing us Lord, Father,
[2:03:57] back to this awareness, Lord, that you
[2:04:00] can become whatever we need you for the
[2:04:02] present time, Lord. And Lord, we need
[2:04:05] you more than ever in this hour that we
[2:04:07] going on. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, you
[2:04:10] gave us the promise that you will not
[2:04:12] leave us nor forsake us, but you will be
[2:04:15] with us all the way to the end. Lord,
[2:04:17] may you help each one of us to drop and
[2:04:20] to break through that traditional
[2:04:22] barriers, Lord, so that no matter the
[2:04:25] situation like our brother was singing,
[2:04:28] it takes the mountain sometime to see
[2:04:30] you, Lord. Sometime it takes the
[2:04:32] wilderness, sometime it takes those
[2:04:35] difficult situation to bring us to the
[2:04:37] level that we can believe the
[2:04:39] impossible. Father we testify of an
[2:04:42] impossible that you have done just lord
[2:04:45] father for the approval from the county
[2:04:47] according to some people it takes three
[2:04:49] months we were told two weeks but by
[2:04:52] your grace it didn't even take a week by
[2:04:54] the power of prayer lord you open up the
[2:04:57] way and you gave us the approval lord if
[2:05:00] you can do it for a building you can
[2:05:02] also do it for a body lord you can do it
[2:05:05] for whatever we have need of in this
[2:05:07] world lord father and granted unto us
[2:05:09] that's Why we pray Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:11] that you bring us to that existence to
[2:05:14] bring us to that level of faith Lord
[2:05:17] where this sense bound existence Lord
[2:05:20] tradition and what we have been
[2:05:21] instructed since our childhood can now
[2:05:24] break out Lord Father and we can be free
[2:05:27] to sow like an eagle into Lord the
[2:05:30] unlimited as your prophet already
[2:05:32] mentioned. Father, may you give us
[2:05:34] trouble of mercy and keep us all the way
[2:05:37] throughout the week. And if you dare to
[2:05:39] come, Lord, may you consecrate us again
[2:05:41] and help us to meet again back in the
[2:05:44] power of resurrection to hear from thee
[2:05:46] and to enjoy the things of heaven. We
[2:05:49] thank you. May you touch your man's
[2:05:51] servant and strengthen him, Lord, and
[2:05:53] lead us and guide us all in Jesus
[2:05:55] precious name. Amen. Go ahead.
