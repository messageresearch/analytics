ma'am sister bridgette and just singing this song it just kind of hit my heart because it is a guy who's always been like a cook he's always been at funerals of all the family and everything i'm just here thinking lord i don't even know if he knew you so i was just happy i don't know but uh just one lift of his family what was his name thomas thomas okay so we want to remember the family of thomas this morning amen amen and when all we can do sis you know he said anything anybody that loved us or all that we loved and all that loved us so that's a that's a very yes hold on to that any anybody else have a prayer request or a praise report this morning amen i'ma ask brother deny if he would come up and pray this morning let's remember each other we need to draw strength from each other more than ever now we haven't had a gathering in a home in a while um so you know i don't know summer's coming up maybe we can do that outside and just put a tent up or something and just have fellowship so anybody you know want to think about that we're we're considering it as well my mower's broke i can't mow my grass right now so [Music] this boy isn't praying dear god our heavenly father lord jesus christ the great creator of heaven and earth and everything that is therein lord we are gathered here not to see a man not to see each other but we have come here lord to see you to hear from you heavenly father lord may you help us come now and be with us because we don't want to go out of those doors the same way we came we want to go out different lord we may have different issues lord different problems but we pray that as the way to be coming forth all those things will be resolved lord jesus christ you are the god who said you never put us to shame because you promised in your word and the way it is true it says it in the book of joy that my people shall never be put to share and lord we are holding onto that promise you said whatsoever we have need of if we ask you lord you always answer you are the god who is more than willing to give unto us the desires of our hearts then we are willing to receive them father so lord we are holding on to that knowing heavenly father once you promise in your word there is nothing lord that can go wrong because father it is already said and it is settled up in the heavens above so lord we are holding on to that there's nothing else we can trust in everything else has failed us politics has failed us lord our jobs sometimes they failed us lord our family members they failed us but you are the only one the brother the friend that sticketh closer than a brother and we are trusting and depending on you to see us through lord there may be requests that have not been uttered by the word of mouth but we kindly ask you to meet each and every one according to what they have need of you know father everything that your children hear from the oldest to the youngest in this building where we all receive is according to our faith and to help us lord to believe to know that god is more than able no matter how the situation looks like you are more than able heavenly father because we have done it before we read in the bible you have done it lord for shadrach meshach and abednego they were thrown into that fairy fairness and lord you appeared just at the last minute when even people they thought well their goddess forsaken them but you appeared right on time you are never late heavenly father so we are praying lord there may be different situations it may be held it may be financial it may be family issues whatever it may be father the needs are so innumerable but you are the god who is the solution to all that because you said even the prophet teaches before there was a fin on the fish there had to be water for that fish to swim in before there was even a wings on a bed they have to be air for the bed to be able to fly so lord before there was needs there was the one who could fulfill those needs so we kindly ask you this morning to meet each and every one as we have come to hear from you bless the song leader lord as he continues to lead us in the songs of zion bless all those who shall come here and sing the specials anoint them in a special way and bless the preacher as they shall stand forth here may we not see a man but may we see you speaking to us using him as your mouth peace lord we pray now you bless the thoughts and offerings and everything that shall take place in this house may you be the one to get all the glory or the honor and all the praise at the end of it all we pray and ask all these things in the name of our lord and our savior jesus christ amen i'm gonna ask sister victoria to come up and as i do my wife was um looking at something the other day and um i wanted to pass it on to the youth she saw a story of a young man from liberia named samuel morris or is it morris or morrison morris and i guess if you google or youtube samuel morris you'll see the you'll

the past okay but we're going to have some people who can sing singing for you all in the morning come on up okay and we're going to have a good time with it um lately god has just been talking to me and drawing me and talking about making more time for him and getting caught up in his presence and that's what this song is about this world this life god has given us like it's like we take it for granted sometimes and we get focused on the things he blessed us with that we forgot about the blesser himself and what's been on my heart is just making more time for god making more time for god making for it's high for god because it's a relationship it's a daily walk we might stumble we might fall but we have to get back up and ask god for strength and to fight for us because we can't do it by ourselves so i just wanted to sing this song see i'm caught up in your presence i just wanna sit here at your feet i'm caught up in this holy moment [Music] i never wanna leave [Music] [Applause]

doing i'm good let's here y'all better sense uh as you know i'm not a singer but he created us to praise him as uh brothers john song say i've wasted so many years of my life living in the world but through the message to the pastor preaching uh god has been spoken to me to uh as brother angelo say to get closer to him too and the question being in my heart for at least about a month now all these years that i spent in the world how did you have spent living uh an unholy life he could have left me there he could have forgotten about me but he chose me for a reason he predestined it pronouncing each one of us to be in this moment right here why you always chose me it's always been a mystery of my life i've been told i belong at the end of the line with all the other not quite we thought i'd never get it right buddy turns out they're the one you were looking for all this time cause i'm just a nobody tryna tell everybody all about somebody who saved my soul ever since you rescue me you get my heart a song to see i'm living for the world to see nobody by jesus i'm living for the world to see nobody by jesus when moses hash stays bright and we brought a rock to our sword fight you big 12 outsider nobody would have chosen and change the world but the moral of the stories everybody's got a purpose so when i hear that devil start talking to me saying who do you think you are i said i'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody all about somebody who saved my soul ever since you asked me you gave my heart a song to sing i'm living for the world to see nobody but jesus i'm

we want to want you we we would rather want you saved than see you into the world but praise be the name of the lord because it's working it's effective and we can now begin to glean and begin to enjoy the fruit that is coming in the ministry we praise the name of the lord amen you might be seated for a lot of it thank you very much musician brother mikey daily i won't forget about you i keep on the firing line too amen amen blessed be the name of the lord i'm gonna go through everything i hope you're gonna give me grace i hope you're gonna give me grace with time amen blessed be the name of the lord how many caught up on part 20. a few hands a few hands a few hands okay hopefully you're going to stay in tune i just want to remind you that at the end of the service this morning we're going to pick up the building fund offering so the trustees will be standing with a basket over there and as you're going up just remember to go ahead and drop something in to help us move on with our building amen and also continue to remember the building in prayer the work of the building in prayer amen there was someone who asked me a question and it was quite a good one but i could not answer it by replying by text so sometimes your questions are easier i can go ahead and send you an answer right away or a quote but some of them we got to sit down and talk amen so when i send you a message like we got to sit down and talk it's up to you to either talk to me or talk to the deacon so we can sit down and go through scripture i cannot write you a long text message like this until you have to read read read and you lose focus amen so you have questions let's sit down on some of them let's talk go through the message go through the scripture and make sure you get an adequate answer everybody clear so far amen blessed be the name of the lord we're going through a small breathing here because there was a change that was made and the church need to be aware of it amen the bible brother branham says here in the message question and answer he says we believe in church government i already read this quote to you but sometimes we got to refresh and we go back and make sure these things still soak in and we don't forget about it brother branham said we believe in church government for some reason this screen is not adequate here i don't know but you can work it out if you can see clear that's fine but it looks to be tilted amen we believe in church government and the government is order of the holy spirit in the bible so our government is not the government of the world that is ruled by politics but our government is completely ordered by the holy spirit brother branham said that the pastor is always not sometime he say it's always the head of the church the pastor is can you say amen always that is god's elder so when we're talking about an elder for a local church that elder is the pastor everybody clear he say in organization you have to come through the bishop in other words if you go to the world through the baptist the methodist the presbyterian you got to meet the bishop first before you go into the pastor that is not the way in the message in the message every church is sovereign don't worry you're gonna wake up amen the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that is god's elder in organization looks better my brother you have to come through the bishop now the bible there is no higher order in the bible than the elder of the church just tell me where it is that there is no eye no higher order in the bible for the church than who the elder which is who the pastor that is the highest order of the bible in other words when he come to this church the only one that is above me is the lord jesus christ can i repeat it again the only one that is above us is the lord jesus christ and he is the revealed word of the hour amen if you see somewhere in the scripture where the bible says something or you go in the message and brother branham is referring into something whether it is a deacon or a trustee or even your pastor we all have to submit to the scripture or to that quote amen but if it is your preference that's a different story but if it is the word then even the pastor is subject to the word because paul says that the husband is the head of the wife but christ is the head of the husband amen so there is no bishop in this message that is above me everybody clear brother branham said the church it is sovereign in itself we have no word anybody clear no bishop where are you going we have no general office here we have who amen he is the water he is the general water overseer he is the water the head pastor of this church is the lord i am just a pastor under the head pastor everybody clear he is the king he is the lord he is the healer he is all and all we are just his subject working in there right everybody clear where does he say in the bible that he's the chief bishop in hebrew chapter 13 verse 20 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our who lord jesus that great water so your great shepherd is the lord jesus christ i am not your great shepherd i am a shepherd under the great shepherd everybody clear that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant in first peter chapter 2 verse 25 for we are ye a sheep going astray but i now return unto the water and the water the shepherd and the bishop of europe so the bishop of this church is the lord jesus christ amen in 1st peter chapter 5 verse 4 the bible says that and when the chief shepherd again is the great shepherd he's the shepherd he is the bishop he is the chief shepherd matter of fact david said the lord is my everybody clear jesus said i am the good shepherd ever clear so the great shepherd of this church is the lord jesus christ he said when the chief shepherd shall appear you shall receive a crown of glory that faded not away everybody clears so far brother branham say i believe in the supreme can you say amen can you see this clearly i believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly this church is a supreme authority there is no pastor that is offered this church there is no bishop that is above this church there is nobody we must give an account to in this church we give an account to the word and to the message of the hour everybody clear we can consult our brothers we can ask a question but this church is sovereign everybody clear i believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly yes let each church be its water so this church is not going to be exactly like another church in north carolina don't try to make this church and have a church in the message this church is sovereign hallelujah choose its own pastor each person choose its deacon whatever it is and then that way the man in there has no water the one who desired is the church as a whole not a bishop no bishop have a right to tell us what to do here it is the church that have the right to say what they want hallelujah the holy spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or that so if you have a tendency to call people around and tell them what to do or ask a question just learn from today amen go in the bible go in the message and bring it to us amen they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it is the individual in contact with the holy spirit show me by the bible what is greater in the bible than the local water to a local that is right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each church in water in itself now brotherhood that is wonderful all churches ought to be in brotherhood like that together so that's why we call ministers from other church that's why we call pastor from other church but no matter when we call them this church is sovereign anybody clear but the sovereignty of the local what ever created so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said look the way we used to do it years ago sister gertie was the pianist when our pastor here who was the pastor so brother branham used to be a pastor give me grace we're going to get to the message brother branham was a pastor he said when i passed her here i had to be pastor and water can you say amen and what everything else at once but i had to do it everybody i had to do it everybody clear so a pastor can be a pastor himself amen a pastor can also act as a deacon can you say amen a pastor can be a trustee can you say amen a pastor can be a secretary treasurer can you say amen okay let's read this in damn days we who is we wife and who who's i what about them we wife and i had to go down have a head to go do on water can you say amen so a pastor can be a secretary treasurer in them days we wife and i had to go do on secretary work and we live in two little rooms and we go down to the post office so a secretary treasurer is responsible for the mail and take one of these wash baskets every morning get it full of what that's the whole job of a secretary treasurer anybody clear did jesus do something like that jesus was a good nature too but when he come to saving time to say things it is written my father's house is made the house of prayer and you are making it a den of what thieves he knowed when to speak and when not to speak everybody clear that is what we got to do don't worry devil you're going to get blasted soon there was not never was a person like jesus he was who and remember he even talked about being a what so jesus also as a pastor was a deacon in the church he took over he planted some ropes together and he didn't wait to gently walk them out he beat them out that is your savior that is your chief shepherd he whooped people in the church we're not going to whoop you anybody here he beat them out as the house of god he was playing the part of water anybody clear for an example to you deacon see he was your example and now it is written my father's house has made a house of prayer now remember jesus was a what a deacon then you know what jesus was taking the part of her deacon everybody clear brother branham continue when he come the part of a pastor so jesus was also a pastor what did he say you blind pharisee leaders of the blind he was taking the part of her a pastor then and when he taught them what was going to happen he taken the part of oh a prophet he was foretelling the future see and when they require that they must be tribute paid he taken the pot of water check everybody clear peter go down and cast the hook into the river and the first fish you take up has got a coin in his mouth pay them see pay your just debt say to us give caesar what is caesar god's word is god everybody clear so far brother branham continued he was both what prophet trustee and deacon sure was he so then you see what he did he let that be your example in the house here at this branham tabernacle that we want to be a house that shall be honored in everything and honoring with everything every office every place that there'll be no taking back there be gentleness and sweetness and kindness but just straight on the line every man's at his post of duty see that is the way that is the way he wants it he never slag when it comes time to say call what was called what was what he called it in other words when it was time to say jesus have to say what you want to say everybody clear when it comes time to show gentleness then he showed gentleness he was sweet kind understanding but what stern and everything was right to the dot with him and he did that for your example now the holy spirit just gave me that what i just explained you here the holy spirit gave it to brother branham so i never thought about that him being what before but he was america praise the name of the lord but abraham continues here he says now you don't have to do it that way because you got men to carry this out in other words when a church started and there is not a lot of people the pastor as an overseer as the elder of the church can act temporarily as a pastor as a deacon as a trustee as a secretary in other words the pastor can fulfill every office just like jesus did it but when you get people in the church to do it then you don't have to do it that way everybody clear now you don't have to do it that way because you got men to carry this out i had usher brought a seaward and all of them at the door they had booked pile around there at the door setting in a chair or something another and when someone come in you show them a place to hang your coat and help them to their seat you give them a water on here we don't have songs books technology is improving but the word of god remains the same amen even though things begin to go on a computer the word or this concept of god does not change amen if we don't give people songbook we gotta make sure our projector is working amen because your song book become electronic under projector ever clear to help you up let me say this many times teenager children and sometime adult you know young people will pass what in the old time we used to have notes you come in church you have a little piece of paper and a pen you're going to write something and maybe your friend is sitting beside you and you write a note you say how are you doing and you give it to him everybody clear today we don't do that amen our paper become electronics can you say amen our ink our pen is what you text albert here the passing or not is still valid but as of today don't text in the church everybody here do not text in the church you want to text go outside only those that are working on the sound or those that are looking online they have a legitimate reason to do it amen because nobody could profane the sabbath but the priest who was inside the sanctuary could profane the sabbath and he was not a sin unto him look in your scripture when the corner jesus jesus said your priest over there is working on the sabbath day and he was not seen because he is under a different headship everybody young people will pass note or cut up or something in church now you are old enough to know better than that you should know better than that we want to leave this habit right here before we go to the church if you expect to be a real man someday and raise a family to the kingdom of god then start off in the beginning you see and act right and do right if someone young people usually you want to sit together i don't have any problem with it young man you want to sit together i don't have any problem with that but make sure the one sitting beside you is not there to bring a distraction to you you didn't leave your home to come here for someone to hinder your blessing amen you cannot be in church talking to your friend you cannot be in church passing note you cannot be in church texting this is the church of the living god everybody clear in the message god hiding himself in simplicity brother branham said now this may seem a little rude but it is not a place to visit it's a place to do what you want to talk you go outside amen if you're putting the instrument here make sure whatever you talk concern the instrument you don't put the instrument here and begin to talk about your weak you need to go outside we should never even what not talking even what you do we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of what to one another unless it is absolutely water can you please change the baby's diaper that makes sense but not just cut up amen we should never rally around we should never run through the building and let our children run through the water even after church mama pick up your kids let's go outside if you don't change the habit here you're going to bring it in the church over there so we make sure we clean up everything here not texting not talking except it's absolutely necessary respect yourself and we're going to respect you if you don't listen i'm going to talk to you warning then judgment america praise be the name of the lord he said give them a song book and ask them to be in water no talking and then everybody set in their seat and silently pray until starting time when you get here get on your seat start praying stop talking there is a time to talk and there is a time to be quiet if your friend talk a lot stay find another seat if your child is crying you cannot let your child cry for five minutes before you move on the child is crying crying crying just pick up your child go outside but you want to stay there seven minutes until a deacon have to talk to you respect one another everybody clear now going back to this brother branham say you don't have to do it that way because you got men to carry this out so when we start in july i believe when i got elected here we have men in this church that can do the work amen that's the reason why we appointed trustees we appointed usher to go ahead and start doing the work until we move on everybody clear i never thought i needed to add a sunday school superintendent because number one we don't have a sunday school here and we don't have room for it but if we go back to the building and the kids start sunday school we're gonna appoint one anybody clear until we wait and then we voted on it everybody clear i did not think we need a secretary treasurer i thought the trustee can go ahead and handle everything everybody clear that's the reason why we went through and all the way to this year we did the voting and everything was over but after the voting i got the report from the trustees and some of them you know some of you were contacted we had to make some correction everybody i thought we can go a whole year without adding a secretary treasurer but when i look at the report i understood that it was time to add a secretary treasurer because the trustees need some help everybody clear so at the beginning your trustees were doing two jobs they were working as a trustees and they also were working as your secretary treasurer everybody cleared so far why did you give the trustees the job of a secretary treasurer brother branham in church order the trustee only thing they are under duty by god to watch over water the trustees watch over finance can you say amen i go like this because some some of the stuff we thought people knew it but we found out we need to be taught as a pastor i gotta lay it out everybody clear the trusty only thing they are under duty by gods to watch that finance and take care of that the things that goes on like that i told you about them tips which is a property of the church and about other things here that goes on about the building and the water so when it comes to the building and the repair you need to talk to her everybody clear and taking up their finances who pick up the offering everybody clear so now you begin to understand some of them everybody clear they're building repair and taking and taking up the finance and things that is what the trust is off the property they're the finances and what in church order paragraph 113 now there has been complaint all along on making the tips now when there is a complaint on anything pertaining to what finances of this church it is duty-bound to who to see that thing is what if you have a problem with the finances you need to see who everybody clear so far that is the order of the church brother branham in the placing of deacon does this congregation feel that brother hand is a just and a righteous man who has been with us for water so before you join an office in the church clear are you awake you must be with us for some time ever here you cannot come here in two weeks and you are you expecting to get a job hallelujah a just and a righteous man who has been with us for some time to be the the water there is the word secretary and the word treasurer combined together the secretary treasurer of this church to hand there each water so the secretary treasurer also handle what the trust is under water so there is an intersection between the trustees and the secretary everybody here to handle its finances and to pay its water so the secretary is responsible for paying the bills he is also responsible for the mail everybody clear we want you to stay on the word if brother stephen the trustees handed the finances the secretary handed the finances now you have appointed a secretary treasurer how can you split them are you ready in second king chapter 12 verse 9 and 12 you who are looking online it is for this church enjoy the service respect the order but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bore a hole in the lid of him and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priest that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord and he was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the king water and the high priest came up and pulled up in a bag and took the money in other words there was a report that was given that was found in the house of god before going further there was a scribe from the king and a scribe is what you call a secretary everybody clear let's go to john chapter 12. i could have speak to you once but if i speak question will begin to pop up left and right left and right so let's answer those questions amen then he clears everything let's go to john chapter 12. if you dare you can say amen so give me grace this is important for the church i spoke to the trustee i had couple brothers in my mind one of them because of coffee is more not more available in the church but he's there and i presented to them a second one who i thought can do the work and help us up i appointed it i didn't voted you need to vote for it next year whether you agree or not then we find somebody else if you don't agree everybody clear let's go to john chapter 12. if you're there you can say chapter 4 then say one of his disciples not two how many disciples one disciple then say one of his disciples judas iscariot someone son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 pests and given to water so somebody among the disciple is worrying about the money to give it to the poor money to give to the poor why didn't peter worry about the money why didn't john worry about the money only judas let's continue verse six this he said not that he cared for the poor anybody clear but because he was a word and heard the word so the one that was holding the bag was judas there was only one disciple jesus had 70 he had 12 but out of all the number only one was responsible for the beggar or for the bank account because in that time they were keeping the church money in the bag and there was only one disciple that was responsible to the account hallelujah and paul what was put darwin ever clear let's go to chapter 13. john chapter 13. if you dare you can say amen hallelujah john chapter 13 verse 26 are you there and jesus answered here it is to whom i gave i shall give a soap or a morsel when i have dip it and when he had dipped the soap all the morsel he gave it to who judas is carried the son of who he gave it to the one that is responsible for the bank account of the church everybody clear verse 26 and after verse 27 and after the soap sat and entered into him then said jesus to him that in other words what that you do do quickly verse 28 now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him for some of them thought because judah had the word because judah was the one that had the bank account of the church can you say amen judah had the beg that jesus had said to him by those things that we need against the world a secretary treasurer is somebody that can buy stuff for the lord's supper everybody clear the bible says brother branham says everybody clear they thought jesus had said by those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to who so a secretary treasurer is somebody who's responsible for getting the money out from the account when you bring the money you give it to the secretary treasurer and he put it in the bag you just give him instruction to how to pull money out the secretary treasurer doesn't tell you what to do with the money he's only responsible to only give out or put the money into the account the one that give instruction about the money is the trustees hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and look at the church jesus the what judas the what that's why you have secretary treasurer as a secretary it's a scrub he's a man that must give you a record he's a man that must do your bookkeeping he's a man that must give you the report of the bank account that belonged to the church and there were not two of them only one anybody clear you can have five fifty trustees fifty deacon only or one disciple jesus the pastor judas the world both of them were what out of the same so secretary treasurer can be anybody he can be your brother it can be your uncle it can be your friend it can be any brother in the church there is no restriction can you say amen [Laughter] hallelujah in the message is this the son of the end time sir let me say that because i'm going west it is not that i'm leaving this tabernacle this is the church that the lord gave me here is my headquarters here is where i stay i am only going in obedient to the commandment that is given me by vision my what what is his name will remain my water can you say amen brother cox was also a secretary but he was not brother branham's family a secretary can be anybody in the church everybody clear so far what is the secretary job in the message from that time where am i at hallelujah wow the law of offering is for the foreign field i do not receive it myself it's taken by my field water content by minister giving to who to whom deposited in there the one who deposit the money in the bank is your secretary oh my god i want to thank you for the love offering and the missionary offering that you've taken that goes straight to that fund i don't even know never look at any money at all in the meeting my water takes care of what it is all what and what ever here hallelujah i think that as our own as our own people we should take care of them and it should be turning any complaint to the chairman of the deacon board in other words the head deacon and then it should be met by the deacon board to see what they are able to do about it in other words if you're going through headache through trouble you got fire at your job and something is not going right into your home you can talk to the deacon and the deacon will meet together and see what they can do about it everybody clear and all of those things which is clothing food and financial work for the people of the church or whatever it is should come through what if you have a problem in this church see the deacon then the deacon when they decide that they are what they are going to do about it then they should preserve be presented then to the what the deacon the treasurer doesn't tell the deacon what to do the treasure only take the request from the deacon hallelujah you see how we need to teach this thing if i get under this it's gonna take a siri amen then it should be presented to the treasure to see if the water the treasure is able at this time to pay this certain amount of water why the deacon don't know what it is in the bank account because it's held by how many people he is the one that can look in the bank and say i can pay your bill or not buy this clothing or whatever it is to that but the deacon board should meet on that it doesn't go through the world or to the world you can you say amen you get a problem you go see who and the deacon go see who and they exchange your bill with the money the secretary pick up your gas bill and they give the deacon a check that is equivalent or at the same level of your bill because he must keep record for accountability everybody clear it doesn't go through the trustees or to the it is the conflict oh praise be the name of the lord and then if he sees that the sanders could need the sunday school superintendent certain things then he is to present to who the sunday school is superintendent when he needs the bible or something for the kids he goes to the trustees this is how we operate and the trustees had a meeting upon it first then the trustees if they found that there is sufficient fund how do they find it and forth through the world even the trustees don't know what is in here can you say amen a trust if they found that there is sufficient fun and so forth through the treasure then this can be purchased if he wants something another for literature whatever it is some bible or something they want to buy some bible for one you know that can find the most word and quote the most scripture these are sister rails you know you had sunday school before you know how it goes some prizes something they are going to give away like that present they want to buy it through the church then let them present it to who to who the deacons if you go back there he said the trustees if you study down you're going to see it's the trustees then let them find out if it is in there ever clear so far their trust is they have nothing to do with it only repair the church and they can do it until there is the whole trusty boat not one trustee meet and say we shall build this or we shall do that then they have to ask who why do they ask him he's the one that look in the bank account everybody here they have to ask the treasurer if they got money to what the treasurer doesn't come up with any project can i repeat it again a secretary treasurer doesn't come with the project project comes from the pastor from the deacon board and from the trustee board he's there to execute you give him the receipt he gives you the money you give him the receipt he gives you the money if there is no money he says there is no money then you go back to the pastor i have a quote for that everybody here we're going to get into the world but if the treasury is low at that time and they can't afford it to do it in other words your secretary say i don't have money then he has to be taken up let me talk with the board giving order to who the trustees come back and say pastor we need to buy a microphone we got to find the solution amen then if there is no money then the pastor will tell you peter your fish man and go fishing open the mouth of the fish get the money and go do what you got to do brother branham say the reason why jesus did that because they were broke you need a coat you see me and then now tonight brother jones a horrible accident his house burned tonight as christian we are together and each one of us must make a pledge so what we can do to help brother jones back uh with his house whatever it is we shall do that let it be said from the water this is the order the trustees gave to the pastor anybody clear that is the way to do that and let the pledge be given in and then give it over to who the treasurer handled the pledges of the church you can take a picture if you want to anybody clear the pledges be given to the treasurer of the church and these pledges be paid through who why he's the one that get the money and put it in the bag and give it to them and give the person a what that's the secretary who give the receipt back here accountability because i don't know whether that is what that's why we give you a receipt at the end of the year it should be handled by the secretary treasurer anybody tax redemption or not i guess it is for something like that those who are wondering why we give you receipt you got a quote for it you need another one you see me everybody clear brother branham say when i go home and i ask mahu how much do we need the secretary has said well you are what so much in there i put that to fill that up so the one that knows whether the bank is full or the bank is off the drum is hooked the bible says brother branham said as a secretary he must keep the book and give a financial what the financial report of the building fund of your offering need to be given to the trustee for a counter ability everybody clear everybody clear so far and may every officer of the church fill his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church each one will give an account not to me you're gonna answer it to god one day remember you are not working for branham tabernacle neither are you working for brother water you are not working for brother stephen or me the prophet you are working for who he's expecting your loyalty and we want to show him our i ask brother freddie if he can go ahead and help us on a secretary treasurer brother freddie stand up if he's there where is he he went out you know him when he comes back you can see him he's right there in the back i ask him for it he's going to run through the end of the year if he feels it's a hot potato he tells me we get him out and we find somebody else and put him in if that person say hot potato we get him out until we find somebody before january if the lord terry then we bring it to him we bring it to you you vote for him and you say no oh yes once it's sanctioned we go ahead everybody clear let's stand a whole message of church order has been preached let's go to genesis chapter 34. are you still alive some are having question don't be afraid give me a call oh my god the word is the word genesis chapter 34 if you dare you can say amen and donna the daughter of leah which she brought to jacob went out to see the daughters of the land she was in a certain place she went out and when she came the son of emma the harvard prince of country saw her he took her and lay with her and defile her what they did there was not something good it was something that was bad that's the reason why the bible say defile her everybody clean you so far hallelujah yes lord okie dokie and his soul come to donna the daughter of jacob and he loved the demso and spoke kindly to the damsel and she came spoke to his father emo saying get me this damsel as a wife after already messing up everybody clear verse five and jacob heard that he had defiled donna his daughter the report came back to the father now his sons were with the cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come and hammer the father of chicken went out to jacob to commune with him and the son of jacob came out came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very angry because he had wrought what something wrong a disgraceful thing in israel in lying with jacob's daughter which thing ought not to be done you might be seated there is no right that anybody have to know or to have an intimate contact with a woman if they are not married lawfully clear anybody clear is not not to be done verse 8 and ammo commute with them saying the soul of my son chicken long for your daughter i pray you i pray you give her him as a wife and make your marriages with us and give your daughter to us and take our daughter unto you they still love themselves everybody clear job to verse 13. and the sons of jacob answer sheikham and emma his father deceitfully and say because he had defiled donna their sister and they said to them we cannot do this to give our sister to one of the water before you get married to a son to a daughter of jacob everybody here you must be circumcised everybody here in other words the daughters of jacob don't don't get married to pagan they don't get married to worldly people those people must get circumcised first to be part of the commonwealth of israel then we will give our daughter to you thank you my brother and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people but if you would not hearken to us to be circumstanced then we will take our daughter and we will be gone and the word please hammer and she came here my son and the young man even though he did something wrong and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delighting jacob's daughter and he was more honorable than all the hearts of his father when you do something wrong your problem is your attitude when they present you the truth when they present you the truth the attitude you have in front of the truth is what's gonna justify you amen and correct your life even though you messed up in the past always remember check your attitude to make it right this young man was willing to correct to get circumstance and align himself with the god of israel let's go to esther chapter two my speed is running quicker so you stay alert everybody clear esther chapter 2 everybody awake oh they are thinking jack esther chapter 2 are you there then say the king's servant that minister to him let there be fair young water virgin if you remember where we stopped the virgin loves him everybody remember that a few people let there be fair young virgin sought for the king and let the king appoint officer in all provinces everybody clear of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to shoot the palace we went through detail on this to the house of the women to the custody of hege the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for water purification be given to them in other words even though you are virgin everybody clear when you are picked for a king's wife everybody clear you must go through a cleansing process you are virgin but you still need to go through purification why a virgin need to purify she's already pure anybody job to verse 12. now when every man's turn was come to go into the king of hazaris after that she had been 12 months according to the manners of the women for they were for so were the days of the purification accomplished that is six months with the oil of water that purification will kill you you must die with mary remember mary represented death everybody clear six months with all of men and six months with water remember on wednesday we said that the perfume of the rose of cherry now need to be put it on to you number one you must die first and number two you must be sweetened with the perfume of the rose of sharon everybody even though you virgin you gotta go through that process and with other things for the purifying of the what women let's go to song of solomon then we're gonna pray song of solomon chapter one if you dare you can say amen thank you my brother give me grace your church order took my time amen the reason why i had to put everything like that because of question question question question question let me teach the church i'm responsible for the church i must make sure you understand what is going on amen i don't want anybody coming from there and come to teach you i teach you myself by god's grace and i also open the door so the brother can add into the ministry song of solomon chapter one read this on wednesday the song of solomon which is solomon's him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth we already explained you this for your love is better than wine we explain you this because of the severe of your good ointment your name is as annoying poor for perfume therefore do the virgin do what love you there is something about a young brother who is virgin don't worry i will get to you and i'm gonna show you in the scripture for boys also usually we point girls anybody clear therefore do the virgin loves you verse 4 join me we will run after you because nobody comes to the father except by him the king has brought me into his chambers these are the chambers of life they are also chambers of death we will be glad and rejoice in you we will do what remember your love more than what because the king will put a mark on the fusion when the virgin is picked she goes through the purification and after the purification she gets into an antimatter relationship with the king and the king put a mark on her and that mark will be remembered forever we explained to you that on wednesday everybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us lord you have given us another opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour father i just expressed what a shepherd can express to a church we have read the scripture we sung the song of zion father now it is the time that your children we are looking unto thee to come and speak to us father may you remove every demonic spirit every spirit that is trying to torment the man of your people every spirit of lukewarm of sleepiness of tiredness lord father we rebuke everything that is contrary to the word away from this place father may the holy spirit be the only one sealed in thank you for restoring my voice lord speak to us this morning father in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all we are continuing with part 20. i want you to stay alert put your buckle on as we go on let's turn to ezekiel chapter 16. this shall be more familiar ezekiel chapter 16 if you dare you can say amen few people if you dare you can say amen anybody there verse 7 i have caused you to multiply as a bird of the field and you have increased and works and great and you are come to the excellent ornament your breasts are fashioned teenager and your hair is grown teenager whereas you were naked and bear now when i pass by you this is the second time and i look upon you behold your time was the time of love you are awakened and i spread my skirt over you why spreading the skirt because you need redemption god is coming to claim you i spread must cut over you and cover that nakedness yeah i saw to you and enter into a water this woman is not married to anybody yet but she's trying to enter into a covenant with his maker with her maker first before your natural marriage you need to be married with who amen enter into a covenant with you say the lord and you become what and then god will put a mark in your life like jacob and that mark you will never forget it because you need the mark for your life journey verse 9 then what are you with what and i totally wash away your water so this woman when she was born she was polluted under her own blood but we know by the message and the teaching that the blood comes from the father everybody clear and the blood that you are born with is a natural blood which is coming from sex ever clear now when you look at the blood the bible says here in genesis chapter 9 that the flesh with the life thereof which is the water so when we talk about the blood we are really talking about the life that is in the blood when you are born you are living because there is a natural life that came into you through the blood everybody clear but that life is your natural life of sin it is a life that needs to be cleaned up it is a life that needs to be changed hallelujah he said the blood which is the blood thereof shall he not eat leviticus 17 verse 11 for the life of the flesh is in the water can you pray can you uh preach with me the life of the place is in water in the blood leviticus 17 verse 14 for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel you shall eat the blood of normandy of flesh for the life of the flesh is in the water it's in the blood amen this young lady when she was born she was born with a natural life and this natural life is a life of sin and it's a life that is shaped in iniquity so when the lord comes in your time of life he need to kill he need to clean up the first life in other words when you are born remember you are black on the outside black on the inside when god comes you need to remove the first blackness on the inside which is the life from your father and your mother everybody here so far praise be the name of the lord that's why we found roof they gave her with an instruction they say when you go you go to a place where boaz does what sleepeth and sleepeth in the bible spoke of what and the death of christ happened way at calvary at the cross and they told her to lay at her at his feet and brother branham when we were this brother branham explained that going to the feet means to be unworthy in the message go away jesus brother branham say i want to ask you that come to the altar just now from the bottom of your heart with you come in with what sincerity from the bottom of your heart you believe the bible is what that jesus christ god's son died in your water that's why roof has to be brought into a place where boaz is sleeping you have to come and meet christ's first recovery everybody clear you are not worthy of it you are unworthy you know it but because that you was unworthy god sent him the word one that you in your own wordiness might be sons and daughters of what that's why ruth have to go to the faith root was not a jew ruth was a gentile gentile are unworthy because we were strangers from the commonwealth of israel that's why the roman centurion said i am not worthy that you come under my roof you must approach god as an unworthy person if you need redemption from him hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord then cover me with your heart your skirt which is the spirit because that spirit brings the bond of perfection which put a mark in your body everybody clear so far now let's go to ezekiel chapter 23. hallelujah everybody clear i'm sorry i'm rushing ezekiel 23. if you dare you can say amen let me go 35 miles here everybody clear the word of the lord came again to me saying son of them they were what two women the daughter of one mother ever clear and they committed warden in egypt because of the situation of life sometimes we find ourselves victim of circumstances anybody clear we grew up in the wrong room we grew up in a difficult situation we didn't know what to do we didn't know any better and then somebody took advantage of us and we lost our virginity everybody clear and they committed well done in what in egypt these women were in egypt now by default according to the message teaching egypt tapped the world everybody clear but there is another aspect of egypt that i'm going to bring unto you in the message talking brother branham says this hallelujah israel coming out of egypt was a tap of the anti-tab today egypt was the water now here egypt is the church this church is a nominal church anybody clear egypt was the church and israel represented the water so the bride must be pulled out of a denomination church are you following me egypt represented the world and egypt also represented denomination some of you came into the message straight from the world some of you came in the message from a denomination into the message you didn't know any better into the world you didn't know any better into the denomination because the nomination only provided the covering which is called religion that's why when eve and adam sinned they took the fig leaves and brother branham said fig leaps represented religion amen they only cover their sin but the seed were not remitted denomination will give you a shelter that you can go live and clean and then sunday you come to church you can go in a nightclub and behave like a devil and then on sunday you can sing into the quad denomination give you that umbrella but not the bride ever cleared so far israel came out of egypt so does the bread came out of the water the church see because there has to be something there for it to come out it's got to come out if it was a tap the church is down in egypt in the what in the water that's why denomination it's a worldly church it is a church that is in egypt and this church is connected to sin and it's all and it's also connected to unclean living everybody down in egypt in the world and in sin and does not care a thinker about the token they don't even believe it but israel loved it for it was the he was salvation to them so these two women here were in egypt some of them their egypt was completely a hundred percent in the world they didn't know anything some of you your egypt was denomination but yet you were not living a clean life you were going to church just like a muslim you were going to church just like for religion because everybody must go to church on sunday but there was no personal relationship with jesus christ everybody clear so far brother branham let's go he said and they commit one dumb in egypt they commit wardem in their word in their youth in their youth which age of youth are we talking about did they do it when they were two years let's see they committed weldom in their youth they were there where they want the breast remember that puberty makes sense now their breast which is talking about teenage remembers in your 16 their breasts were formed you understand now where their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teeth or the veil of their virginity they lost their virginity in the world they lost their virginity when they were baptists when they were methodists when they were catholic and some of you in the messy church hallelujah i know they're hidden down in africa amongst that my dark bread and butt down there i found the morals of them people higher than 90 of the american people i'm reading your prophet why in some of the traps there if a young girl is not married till she is a certain age or when she is a certain size or no one has taken her yet they know there is something wrong they excommunicated her she take off the trouble pen and she goes to the city then she becomes a reign again and when she's married she's tested for her virginity if the leader virgin vale is broke then she has to tell who done it and they kill them both together then you call them hidden oh my they can come teach people that call themselves church member how to leave what because the nomination don't teach you that and some of the message churches won't teach you that you're killing someone for virginity brother stephen really go to detroit number 33 keep his achieve 23 keep your finger in ezekiel 23. let's go to deuteronomy hallelujah let's go to deuteronomy 33 blessed be the name of the lord if you get there you can holler amen not say but holler hallelujah deuteronomy 33 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen amen the tournament 13 let me see 33 now make sure i write the correct scripture i hope i got the right one hold on away from me i'm gonna make sure it's a scripture that speaks about the cloth of virginity brother michael daley i thought i wrote the correct one deuteronomy 33 can you find that brother mike you found it anybody knows it go to deuteronomy 22 i got it deuteronomy 22 verse 13. why the mic i was faster today deuteronomy 22 if you dare you can say a man if a man take a wife everybody there and go into her and hate her watch this man he love a woman get married to the woman and turn around i don't love you and give occasion of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say i took this woman and when i came to her i found her not water or a virgin she began to the men begin to accuse the woman everybody here dancer the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the water the tokens of the damsel virginity to the elder of the city in the gate so this unity was something very important until your father was keeping a proof of it hallelujah this is not the bible it's not the hidden in africa anybody clear let's drop down verse 16 and that them their father shall say to the elder i gave my daughter to this man as a wife and he hated her and he hates her and no he has given occasion of speech against her say i found not your daughter a virgin and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the word there was a cloth dark cloth if you look at a different translation dark cloth was a bad this is the bible when you get married to a woman you're gonna go to a certain place and they're gonna keep a bad after you finish your honeymoon they pull that bad and they keep it to your father if a knot is brought against you daddy bring the cloth and say this is the proof of a virginity here in your scripture anybody clear and and spread the cloth before the elders of the city and the elder of the city shall take the man and chastise him because he told lies and they shall immerse him a hundred shackle of silver and give them and give them to the father of the damsel because he play with the reputation of the family because he has brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and he shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days but if this thing be what true and the token of virginity be not found for themselves then shall they bring out themselves to the door of her father's house and the man of the city shall do it stun her with stone that what why because she has wrought water in israel to play what in her father when you commit fornication in your father's house you are bringing shameness to your family that's why you need to repent to your parents can you say a man if you don't want to face your mother or your father to tell him what you did you better quieten your nerves anybody clear oh you're gonna do it if you don't do it that spirit will hang on you and continue with you all along everybody clear brother branham says here that the woman she had the sack a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her lord a certain virtue nothing else hold it but a woman that is committed to her by god she must not defile that virtue if she even does something wrong she must do what dad she must confess that to her what not only do you confess to your parent the day before you get married you must tell that man that i am not virgin can you say amen avoid the hard road go the easy one and she even does something wrong she must confess that to her husband before he takes her and make it the same as the church that was married to the lord has to come also before christ before the second marriage she has to confess that if she does not she lives with her husband for how many years and then confesses he has a right to what and marry another woman that is what i just read to you the message perfectly learned with the bible everybody here fornication is what sexual relationship before marriage is unclean living joseph feel not to take unto the married wife for that which is conceiving her is of the holy ghost he was murdered to do what put her away privately after he have already engaged to her when you are engaged to her as far as god is concerned you are married to her not to have sexual relationship yet until in the altar i have to underline that one everybody clear before you get a snake an interpretation she has a sacred trust of virtue that has been given her trusted to her by the lord god gave her the virtue just as he was in the garden of eden she can say yes or what sister you have a right to say yes or no even to god you have the right to say yes or no to god because he put you on the free moral agency she has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her that she must not break what is movementhood the womanhood i'm speaking of here is her work many times what opened the door for the boys to play with you is the way you behave you are too loose around boys [Music] a woman should not be too loose around young men [Applause] you think you conscious you think you're social you are just giving them a signal that we can temper here anybody clear conduct a character around what sister when you are around brother watch yourself watch what you talking watch the subject you engaging yourself into it because that's how eve got in trouble with the devil begin to talk about sex here notice that is committed to her sacred virtue sacred womanhood sacred motherhood or not a husband what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she is a top of the water the church which is the self which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtue to her husband the church has sacred responsibility to work when you destroy your prayer life you are breaking your virtue with your lord i'm busy i'm busy i'm busy i'm busy i'm busy i'm busy you can spend three hours in fellowship but you don't have 20 minutes to pray you can talk on the phone three hours you cannot even pray one hour hallelujah the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the water you must read your bible and listen to the tips and to whom just the same as the woman has ever cleared so far a warm virginity in second samuel chapter 13 the bible says that and she had a garment of diverse colors upon her for with such robes were the king's daughter that were water it was something special in israel when this woman lost it temer she put ashes on her head and rent her government of what diverse caller telling the people that i am no longer virgin anybody exodus 22 verse 17 if her father orderly refused to give her unto him he shall pay money according to the diary of water so there was different diaries amen if you are a virgin your diary was special why god put a special attention to a virgin let's go to judges chapter 11 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord everybody okay so far [Applause] hallelujah i know i'm taking a little bit of your time those that have medical condition you can get something i won't call you everybody clear judges 11 29 if you dare you can say amen why such a special attention to the virgin if you dare you can say amen then the word the spirit of the lord came upon who jeff that the anointing drop on jester when that anointing drop on jephthah what did the anointing do to jester the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gila and manasseh and passover mispre of gila and from miss prayer of gila he passed over to the children of emon and just a vow a vow to the lord under the anointing and say if you shall without fail deliver the children of hemon into my hand then it shall be that whatsoever come forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of

gonna give it to you now who's gonna determine what comes out of the house first who's gonna determine that because this is his prayer between him and god now who's gonna make something come out of the house it is god let's see when god goes to the house of jephthah and he begin to inspect jeffthal he looked at the tv 16 inches he looked at the computer he looked at the couch he looked at the goat he looked over there he owned three cars he looks there what is god going to pick up in your house hallelujah are you ready oh my god blessed be the name of the lord amen verse 31 then it shall be that whatsoever come from of the door of my house to meet me when i return in peace shall the church or from the children of hemon shall sure be the lord and i will offer it up as a water a burn offering so jeff that passed over the children of emma to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hand and he smote them from arrows even till you come to minute even 20 cities and to the plain of vineyard of the vineyard with a very great slaughter thus the children of hermann were subdued before the children of israel everybody clear now verse 34 the lord is speaking and chapter

house god check around and he's looking look he look he went straight to the virgin and pick it up and that virgin is obedient to the commandment of the lord that's why the virgin love amen there is

the power of the mark are you there damn mark made jacob life all along until his death lamping there was no surgeon that could repair that because he was marked by god are you there the mark is powerful if you don't understand that that is where the devil comes everybody clear the bible probably the bible says in deuteronomy for that a holy people unto the lord god the lord that god has what to be a water regardless of what you did god chose [Music] are you following me summer virgin i'll pick you up some you lost it but i still came you because i love you his love is above human reasoning are you there i love your choice d to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the world the face of the earth the lord did not set his what his love is unconditional [Applause] are you there it is not a love that condones sin but it's a love that can pick you up and restore you even if you fail [Applause] hallelujah the lord did not set his love upon you nor chose you because you were more in numbers than any people it was not because of your physical for you were the fewest of the people you were just leader no strength but because the god what the capstone and because he would keep the water god so by himself he's not gonna lose what he belongs to him no matter how much damage that therefore done in your life god will not lose you hallelujah he's so by himself and in revelation 10 when the mighty angel comes he comes with an offer reminding you that i saw i'm not gonna leave you i'm coming down to pick you up hallelujah he will

out of that nightclub let the others stay in denomination but as for you come out from among them everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord let's drop down to verse five again and ahola played the harlot when he when she was who and she dotted on her lover she lasted after her lover on the water huh which were clothes with water captain and rulers all of them hurt handsome men are you there this woman ahola forgot she was mark in egypt she came around she got into the promised land and she began to go out again like donna she went out she got in trouble she came back to the church and she reopened the same door that got her in trouble again [Music] you got in trouble because of first book you coming back again correcting your life but you still open the door again to your old friends are you there they were desirable young men do you see not old men still on the youth young men horsemen riding upon what they all have their cars everybody clear thus she committed her whole them with them with all them that were chosen men of water and with all of them she dotted in other words she lasted with all the adult she defiled water neither left she her what brought from water from in her youth the bible remanded again they laid with her and they bruised the breast of virginity of her virginity and poured their water upon what she and did not understand that she already touched the fire did not understand that she already ate the fruit and the eyes are open the fig tree won't help you you need the lamb to be killed and you need to be clothed with a lamb and stay under the protection of the lamb if you don't do that you are still vulnerable to the devil what did she do she began to do what to last james i'm going to head to the airport here so we can pick up later let no man say when he is what i am tempted of what for god cannot be what that's why jesus told the therefore you shall not tempt the lord your in other words i am your god deity you don't tempt me because i am god are you there neither attempt he what he put you to test he doesn't tempt you the one tempting you is the devil but what is the mechanism or the mystery of lust or temptation but every man is tempted when he he's joined what of his own what the mark is dead you don't cover up against that that's where the devil will begin to pull his magnet you this woman was drawn away by her own lust amen and what entice then when rest is what you agree with it in your heart it brings forth water and once sin is what it brings forth water slowly but graciously and securely god the devil is bringing you to the grave slowly move number one number two number three the end is death everybody praise the name of the lord when moses came out from his 40 days fasting up in the mountain where he had the two table of stone satan tempted him at what this mark is a mark of weakness when it comes from christ it will make you weak but with jesus when you are weak then he is that is his mark ever here but on the world either in egypt in the worldly condition or in denomination denmark is a different weakness it's a weakness that the devil used to punch you and once you get a punch it knocks you down satan tempted him at his weak spot that was his what satan look moses he tried this word moses solid try solid he said where is the weakness of moses he studied moses he said temper do you know what block moses said of the promised land he was water thank god amazing grace went over temple and took moses and put him on one transfiguration and said devil i would not lose any [Applause] are you there and he showed them the commandment and broke them but when satan met the lord jesus he knowed that was not what in other words the devil knows us individually the devil can differentiate this is divine this is brother kalima and he knows who you are and he knows where to shoot you but god said no temptation will come to you that is greater than your stress so when he comes remember you are always greater than him don't give him but stand firm hallelujah he knowed that was not moses he cut him at what which was water that's why he cursed the fig tree if that be the son of god command this stone to be turned to bread and eat because you are but he realized that was not who he didn't get him on his temper anybody there look how satan comes right up there and agree with every bit of that word he's just waiting to find that what in eve to where he could show his to water the power of deception of the devil is manifested in our weak spots to betray her that was satan and here satan in the form of what judas in that age that was satan in the first stage what was he agreeing with the word the word till just one little thing he's trying to find a place where he can get a what so these women by getting their mark forgot the power of the weakness and open the door again and begin to commune with the people that are not supposed to have communication with them and i'm gonna stop here and we're gonna pick up usually if a man is going to be a believer he's got to do whatever from all his water don't tell me your worldly friend is better than some of the message because that's an excuse not all the message people are bad i heard that you tell a sister don't do this no she's better than many people in the message he's better than many people in the message the devil is studying your weak spot we're trying to just have fellowship we're trying to win them i can give you script quote after quote after code after code what we friend the people yoke yourself out from among the what in other words separate yourself when you leave denomination when you leave the world when you come under the headship of the brother make sure all your friends are clean i'm gonna show you that even in the church that you are your friend in your local church must be clean they shall all you do what can you read it with me i want to let you go they shall only do it into water those friends are only there to remind you of your old life what you feeding on tv is only reminding you how you were dancing in the nightclub what you doing on facebook is only reminding you what you are doing before you were married you think you are controlling it but it's working slowly [Music] until i'm sorry i didn't know i just found myself like this and you got to stand in front of this church i have a quote for it i have a scripture for standing in front of the church where i can where where your correction need to be made here they all may call you back into the world again environment a holla a hola remember your environment has a lot to do with it did you not know that your what sure did as brother bosworth used to say you could put a hand head under what and tie him down it would hatch the egg the puppy would hatch out the chicken then because the puppy keeps the egg what it is the water environment account and when you are christian you associate with who and go with who and be what a christian you got to have the right kind of environment around you if you get out in the pool room and dancehall and shuntings and everything else and call yourself a christian the first thing you know you shall be believing it's all right to do it you gotta use to playing around let's stop here brother a brother was testifying to me this morning he was called to the ministry when a what and then he fell he said but then he came back with more of a call to do what than ever before you see what he was when he became a christian he got in the water when ahola left egypt and went to the promised land she went to the assyrian the daughter of jacob dyna went out are you there and that environment does what why didn't dana resist influences him see he just keep on holding around with that kind of environment it influences you i hope you are reading between the line what i am saying it influences you in that environment and the first thing you know you become what you go into it not today coming to you you go into it and just like a good clean man that is clean and moral and begin to associate with a bunch of people who's none see you take up what brother branham didn't say you gonna give them the holy ghost you are the one that gonna pick up the spirit are you there can you work together except the what your friend that you have what is your common ground with them you have a friend on facebook on instagram on whatsapp you chat every day every day you chat you have people in your life you talk to them every day more than even your family member they know more about you than anybody what is your point of agreement do they believe your message you don't believe jesus christ do they believe the bible the way you believe but how can you walk two together because you don't even agree to begin with they don't want to compromise on letting their parent to become your friend but you want to compromise not coming to church to make sure you meet in the restaurant with them young people i'm going to meet my friend over there i'm going to meet my friend in that church i'm going to meet my friend in that church how many times your friend come to meet you in your church how many times did you bring that friend here [Music] you are the only one that keeps going after you the only one that keep moving to them how many times did they follow you you are the only one defeated them you are the only one that have before when you leave work you have to stop by the house before you go to your house how many times do they come to vicious you in your house how do you work together you don't agree how can you work except there what do you agree on if you agree with them it's not an agreement you compromise on your religion to fit them because the message is strict and the message is hard to temper with if you hang on to an old friend who wear makeup high heel paint have boyfriend that means that she's not compromising you the one that is lowering your standard in order to make sure you keep an environment suitable for her [Music] why do you risk your life why do you risk your life mama daddy you watch your girls what kind of friend do they have and you let your girls keep having friendship with people that are not even message believer they go in the same car they travel huh huh they are in the message look at what they are doing on facebook and they put your child in the same category when they see your child say yes it's a friend to that boy over there what kind of reputation is that boy how can you walk together if you don't agree solomon make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man that shall not go why lest that learn his way not him learning your way it's always going that way lest you learn his way and get a what snare to your soul he's a good man he has been like a brother to me he has been like his sister to me i'm going to stop here there is a lot to dig on and i'm gonna show you who should be your friend in the bible and who should be your friend in the message let's stand heavenly father lord it's not an intent to stay longer father a message have to be delivered it's just a matter of a lot of sacrifice not to worry your people but lord the hour is late that we don't have much time left we gotta do everything that we can further to bring your children home to a closer relationship with you where lord father the world will be completely dead and father you only you christ will take the preeminence father there are people here that got their scar into the world they are some dagger this car into denomination some of them even goddess car in their parent home not because they wanted to but it was just because advantage was taken over father some of them in the message churches saw things that made them to go astray in their own life because what they thought was the message example has not been displayed in their life father some are here that are not even going out but the devil has been tempering with them some because of these marks they built complex in their life where they can trust nobody where they can't even lord father have the freedom of their mind and yet you came to approach to tell the world father you didn't leave her because father she lost her virginity lord you even met her with already six and she was even living with the sixth one but because she was a seed of abraham lord you reach down and you snatch her completely out of the devil hands and you gave her lord father a different life a peace in her soul that even the pharisee could not even reach there because she had a representation father these messages are cutting these messages are heart-searching this message of things that comes and bring a man or a woman to drop their head down and say father if i knew better if i knew this i would not have done this father that shows already that it's a predestinated city that is laying there lord father our lives our lord peculiar because you deal with us in our individual work but lord father that does admit that you have not you have forsaken us you were not mindful of us because if you were not we could be still under the mark of the world but father lord jesus christ shows that your grace can reach in every corner he can reach in a man he can reach those that are not in the mind he can reach in every single limit lord and father you can bring your children home father may you comfort the heart of your children and make those that have been found in those situations father may you give peace to the heart lord father that your love has not been wavered you didn't decrease your love for them father but you still love them the same way lord as they never done it because when your
