hear us call him our protector protector protector protector protector god is awesome [Music] my god is awesome [Music] amen amen [Music] praise the lord you know the other uh the other sunday i don't know if y'all were here if you heard it or not but um a couple things brother shango said that just uh was really really touched my heart and one of the one of them was just so simple but i heard a message preacher one time trying uh he was talking about how um brother branham said that the city was was a pyramid and he described as a pyramid through the drawing that he did y'all are familiar with it and uh when john looked up he said he saw it as the shape of a square brother shango was talking about this on sunday and i heard a minister say that he was trying to make excuses for brother branham saying you know they're men they make mistakes he didn't know the answer to it like and it's god in simplicity but he's like you know john might have said it was a square and brother bram i said it's a pyramid but it doesn't matter it's just a city it's just a city but it was so it was such a blessing to me to hear how simple god is and how when john looked up he saw it as a square because he saw the bottom of the pyramid so it was a square and it was a pyramid so people try to find any way they can to diminish the the the work of god but god is true god is the same he's real and uh also as brother shango was saying how uh there has to be than people that worship the man just as there was in scripture there has to be people that will worship the man y'all could be seated y'all could be seated sorry to keep you standing and it's just it was that that was so real to me too because we see that so much we've seen in the past people worshiping the man william branham and even more now and then there's a lot of turning away because of the brother branham worshipers and even we this church has been accused of being brother branham worshipers because you know we believe the prophet in malachi 4 in revelations 10 7. so it's like it's so much of a split some to the left some to the right and it's very hard to see a church stay right down the middle of the road and i believe god's blessed us with a pastor and a church here it's not just the pastor's work you know it's the church keeping the pastor true too and uh i'm just grateful to be in this church where we see our pastor staying right down the straight and narrow and the church keeping him there and and uh um it's just a blessing to me to see it i'm super grateful let's just give the lord a round of applause um we'll just invite our pastor to come as we sing only beliefs this evening all things [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe amen god bless you tonight good to see everybody in the house of the lord i got my family my sister there i know that everybody here is a family [Laughter] but praise god we have one that is in the message and my brother-in-law we have uh i won't call him a visitor preacher i call them a brother it's just to show that we have fellowship with the churches around here some know him some i know he might not know him his name is brother mayang i know him for years he's a wonderful brother if you have uh any knowledge of brother al raven church i used to be in moon hill brother al passed away and he went to be with the lord and he was the one that was elected and he kept uh he's there as a shepherd for that flock up there so you don't hear much of him but he's a wonderful wonderful brother and not only a wonderful brother but a wonderful preacher so if we have some thomas tonight which i don't think you wait till you hear him then you will say brother stephen was right he believed the message he stand for the message and just like we stated this pulpit is for the preaching of the messenger we don't preach tj jakes here or joel austin here or psychology here we preach the end time message of brother branham so if you have a problem with the message this is probably not the place you should be we're going to preach the pure full message i'm sorry we got a small room today the hotel is having two events there so they just can't apologize and at least we are still space with social distance so lord's failing on sunday we'll resume back to our double room and things like that so we won't take too much time we're going to sing only believe again and i'm going to call brother miangi he's coming straight from work he could not go home and pick up his family so this is a big sacrifice for me so maybe next time lord willing you will see his family so the brother was working coming straight and he want to give his heart for the kingdom of the lord and i send his wife the link and hopefully she will be streaming just like the other brothers and we all can enjoy the word of god tonight so brother mayangi this is not a new church this is not another church this is the church of the living god take your liberty feel free preach the house down amen let's stand on [Music] leave only believe [Music] all things are possible only [Music] [Music] only believe [Music] all things are [Music] only lord [Music] so [Music] amen is us is here all things are possible jesus is him jesus is here [Music] all things are possible jesus is here amen please be the name of the lord thank you jesus amen praise be the name of the lord thank you jesus so i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm happy to be in your midst tonight before maybe we get started can you help you sit just for uh just for a few moments such a warm welcome i thank you brother stephen [Music] before i go any further i want you just to read something here from bodybuilding do you mind amen praise the lord i wanted to read something from what house will you build me amen just in a way of encouragement amen praise be the name of the lord the prophet says this he was speaking about brother uh by the green in texas actually he took some he moved to texan he says this i'm on paragraph 22 he says i believe today that the inspiration that's come to body green to move here him and sister green giving up the place back in east also back in texas to come here to start with nothing just simply by an inspiration feeling that they should do it and i appreciate the man that will follow the leading of christ regardless of what the cost is to them though the world may be your best friends think that you are wrong but it's not wrong to you [Music] amen as long as you feel there there's something behind it it's a god moving you it's never long it will always pan out light amen he says i realize that years ago i was called into the ministry i've never made a successful pastor this is what ubanam because i got a warming rambling spirit i can't be satisfied anywhere just wherever the spirit moves i've got to move with it because i've got a message and jesus said i must preach in the other town also how many believe that message that's the reason we're here otherwise we'll not be here amen but there are those who are shepherds that watch the flock i'm so grateful that brother perry followed the leading of the holy spirit and today we have a tabernacle it's a small one that's just good enough to start with to see what the holy spirit not knowing just move step by step now i believe if god has spoken brother sister green to come here and has opened up a place where our children instead of sunday morning one running or riding the bicycles and on the streets running around they have a place to come to worship amen instead of us sitting around and listening to something like that we have heard on a radio which is all right but we as this group of people we have a message for this day amen we we believe that the god has given us a message and brother green i will say buddy stephen now amen i don't want to call him my associate well it is also my associate we are together in this message amen but the green preaches the same thing and the message that i believe in he has left his home left his people left his church and i believe he was a district superintendent or something one of the of the organizations and give the whole thing up when he heard this let everything that was due to him also to come to the desert just to support what god has given us now amen you know the enemy would like to see the flock scattered all over the places because the bible says smite the shepherd and the sheep were scattered together around but god brings the little ones together amen so i would like to thank the pastor for his hospitality to allow us to come and share a little bit from the lord and glad to see brothers modest and his wife coming from concord also and glad to see each one of you so let's stand quickly and go into the scriptures praise be the name of the lord so like brother stephen say i am brother my angie and serving the lord in concord somewhere keep just pressing on amen but before we read the bible let's pray gracious heavenly father this is the moment when we need you the most we are aware that nothing we can do of our own that will help you people you are the only one that was found worthy lord when it comes to the redemption of the lost ways of adam and today we're calling upon you lord to move on the scene and take us out of the way and take over and speak to your children for whom you have given yourself father opened the scriptures to us may the spirit of god just bring the revelation the inspiration and all that we need to make this portion of the service beneficial for the kingdom of god all the glory will be given to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen thank you jesus let's turn to first kings chapter 18 little thoughts we have been sharing back home and trust it will help somebody first kings chapter eighteen and let's start from first maybe let's see here 32 i mean uh let's start from 29 it says first kings 18 verse 29 the bible says and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer no any that regarded and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as the wool contained two measures of seed may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen once again i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ it's an honor for us to have this opportunity of fellowship with you and share a little bit from the world we are familiar with the scripture we just read talking about elijah elijah is the top of a man the tishbite actually he came out of nowhere and he does not say who his father his mother were his family they just said the tishbite but he was kind of a strange man he lived in the wilderness by himself i would say with god amen he did not go to a school of modern day church order he was a a man who was alone in the presence of god and out of nowhere they saw a man walking to the palace with the message and his message was accept i call for when there will not be when coming down even not do that was strange can you imagine uh a man woke up to the white house and give such a message as that the king probably heard elijah speaking and he said well i don't know where he comes from maybe he lost his mind and he took it just lightly and he forgot about it but a month passed six months one year no drop of rain now is that drawing attention of the people you say well there was a fanatic came here and said exactly what is happening here a year and a half nothing happened no rain no dew no crop and ricardo start dying people start dying no food and then people have to do something amen that's why when we go to verse i think 17 the same verse the same chapter now after we know the story we don't have much time to go to the details so after elijah spoke the word we know how god took him to a place of a refuge where he fed him and he took care of him and then after the king realized that we have to do something and then god spoke to elijah to go meet with uh ahab verse 17 he says and it came to pass when ahab so elijah that ahab said unto him or thou he that troubled israel and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the commandment of the lord that's the trouble amen and the thou has followed balaam israel is the people of god god singled out that nation for a purpose that was the only nation that knew god the ways of the people are called hidden pagans idolaters and all these things we know but it happened that they were living in such a time that the nation was carried away into idolatry amen so god cannot let the sin go unpunished amen so he had a man up on the earth for that generation imagine in in chapter 7 verse 1 i mean i mean 17 where elijah came and spoke to ahab the elijah said it was like this he says elijah the tishbite who was in the of the inhabitants of david said unto ahab as the lord the god of israel liveth amen no matter how many bars they had the lord the god was alive no mother they could not see the manifestation of god to show that he was alive in the midst but he was living sin is what actually blind god away from the people and that's what was happening so elijah said as the lord the god of israel live it before whom i stand amen he stood in the presence of god and the word that he spoke to that generation came straight from god a man a prophet of that stand like elijah they don't come with some man-made theology they stand in the presence of god when they say something it's a god who speaks to them and you choose if you want to believe and follow or you want to reject and you know what's going to happen so elijah stood in the presence of god so his message to ahab it was trouble so when he came about ahab came to elijah and he said are you the one troubling israel elijah said no i have not troubled israel but you have trouble israel because this is a people of god and you have taken them away from the message away from the world amen that's what draws judgment over any generation that goes away from god so right away elijah said let's prove and find out who is god because you see when you go when you turn a god down you have to get you a substitute amen when you turn down the message you're gonna have to pick up something else amen so in this case they had valium their church services continued but not in the will of god amen so the message of the hour came to judge that generation praise be the name of the lord so elijah challenged them because he was alone and the rest of the church of that time was way way great in number in so much people look to say oh he does not have god he just he's just him by himself in fact his church is in the wilderness look at the church we have here we have the king on our side even the queen it does not mean a thing to god amen praise be the name of the lord so elijah called them to that great showdown the scripture we just read i think it was uh verse 29 of first kings 18 but my thought here is elijah repairing with building the altar amen so we know the story how elijah said now you are 400 of you just go ahead and uh get your sacrifice and offer to your god and if he is god let him answer by fire amen what a challenge what a showdown and elijah said i will get also a sacrifice and i will call on the name of the lord and let him that is god answer by fire praise be the name of the lord but elijah let them do their uh church uh religious rituals and do their sermons and everything but not a life change amen where's be the name of the lord they had some services they had everything you can imagine in what the world called church amen the church is the presence of god in in the midst of his people the spirit of god will take a hold of a man and through his lips will preach the message that will catch the hearts of the people and turn them back to god amen that's the church of the living god where god manifests his promised word for that day where we see jesus christ alive the same yesterday today and forever that's the church of the living god but the devil comes and defiles that group and makes them look warm and makes them just like the west of the churches amen but we see here elijah let them do their rituals he even mocked them he said but what a god do you guys serve you have been praying preaching and all this time nothing happened and you need to to scream louder maybe your god went to a trip or something amen that's the spirit of elijah amen so when you see elijah speaking you have to have a spiritual understanding to see that this is god otherwise you'll take him like any other man and make fun of his message read the bible elijah said your god went to a trip foreign of the lord but at the evening time amen oh my the second scripture i should have read was malachi chapter 4 because that's today amen so first kings 18 is just like a background because we cannot talk about elijah today and understand his ministry his nature and and the way the lord uses him if you miss to see the first elijah amen because that's the same spirit praise be the name of the lord in fact god sends that spirit when the people have gone astray from god because the ministry of elijah is a ministry of restoration is to bring something that has fallen and we store it back to its position that's what is happening today where is be the name of the law but you see elijah did not call for fire before repairing first the altar amen that's very important before i continue let me read something the prophet says here in the message uh exposition of the seven church ages this is the south sadism church age he says talking about the messengers in each church age he says here in for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep amen amen so when elijah came it was the clergy it was the ministers the preachers those who had the responsibility to lead the people to god amen they get astray and lead the people with them amen so when god sees that condition on the earth he sends a messenger praise be the name of the lord so in this case here is elijah praise be the name of the lord listen what he says the the prophet actually he he longed to see the church of the living god in godly order because when he he was a sent he came into laodicean condition of the church where nothing good was said about the church age exactly the same way it happened in a time of elijah there was nothing good there was a woman called jesse bell the prophetess he had him her she had a group of ministers that were actually eating from his or her table how how can you expect such a minister to go and challenge the queen amen or the king because your paycheck depends on her on him so if you push the message you're not going to get paid amen so you have to preach and say things that pleases his or her ears but elijah was not of that type he stood in the presence of god his message came straight from god amen no matter who will believe it who will not believe it he preached a message it was such a chaos that elijah thought he was the only one left because laodicean condition it's terrible the people who say the church who says we don't have need of you god they kicked him out of the church we are rich we have increased in wages but when god diagnoses that age he said you don't know that you are blind wretched miserable amen praise be the name of the lord so elijah came to call you out of that condition so that your eyes with the eye serve you can see what is happening come on come over my people where is be the name of the lord god had a little handful 7 000 that did not bow before that god of that evil age so we can even take the example of john the baptist he had the spirit of elijah on him amen so the bible says he had the spirit of elijah in order to restore the hearts of the fathers to the children amen as elijah his ministry was to restore the hearts of the fathers back to the children amen oh it was such a quiet i thought maybe i was saying things here william barnum is to restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers john the baptist was to take the patriarchs amen bring them to believe the faith of the children when jesus was there because the patriarch they actually gave them under moses the law you have to sacrifice uh maybe a lame natural lamb and uh turtle dove and all those natural sacrifices and they're depending on that for so long until it has become a tradition they have become pharisees solicits and all that under the law of moses but the messiah could not be received in that condition so god has to send the spirit of elijah to take them from that for those traditions to come and believe the genuine sacrifice amen but he could not come and introduce the messiah before we build in the altar because you see if the altar is not in order your sacrifice will not be accepted you think the prophets of baals did not sacrifice they did sacrifice they did have an altar but it was not according to the order of god for that day praise be in the name of the lord john i mean elijah he did not pick up anything from everywhere he stood in the presence of god and god told him what it takes in order to please him he went and took 12 stones not 30 not 14 not 50 12. amen after the names of the tribes of israel because he has to restore that people back to god he will prepare the altar he will build the altar if you read the bible says even the words was set in order upon that altar and then he laid down the sacrifice oh the fire was obligated to come down praise be the name of the lord john the baptist when he came let's read a little bit of that do you mind praise be the name of the lord so matthew chapter 3 this is the forerunner of the messiah verse 403. well let's give us one he said in those days came with john the baptist preaching in the the wilderness of judea and saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand for this is the heat that was spoken of by the prophet isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight you cannot straighten out something that was not amen are you getting it you have to get the thing straight praise be the name of the lord you cannot just do something i mean prepare something that was not unprepared so that was the ministry of elijah verse 4 and the same john had his remnant of camel's hair that's elijah and a lead and girl about his loins his meat was locked in wild honey many puppets would not let him come preach he was rugged he was tough amen verse 6 verse 5 then when out of him to him jerusalem and all judea all the regions learned about jordan and we're baptized of him in jordan confessing those sins the prophet says people the religious people they said where these men come from remember the pharisees even sent the people to ask who are they are you the christ no are you the elijah no are you the prophet no puzzled tell us who are you so we will bring word to those who sent us amen he had a prophecy about his ministry it was up to them to believe it or not amen listen uh i was saying that the prophet said it was strange for them to see a man drowning people into water never seen before what a religion is this drawing people in the water but god told him to do that amen so when you see elijah preaching things you have to be from the lord in order to receive it the rest of the people will go to the bible they won't found it it was not for them amen praise be the name of the lord it says seven but when he saw many of the pharisees and the services come to his baptism he said unto them oh generation of vipers is that how you speak to the religious leaders that's the spirit of elijah amen amen prayers be the name of the lord who hath wants you to flee from the world to come we thought therefore the foods meet for repentance and think not to say within yourself we are christians we have the holy ghost we are ministers no he says think not to say within yourself we have abraham o our father to our father for i say unto you that the god is able of these stones to raise up children to abraham amen praise be the name of the lord and in that same baptism to save time the soldiers came he said what should we do now don't take from people what you're not supposed to take the tax gathered they came and said what shall we do he told them what they must live straight before he introduced the sacrifice the altar the hearts of the people have to get right before they receive the messiah amen he told them everyone what they were supposed to do but to the minister he told them don't you consider yourself to be of god when your life proved contrary [Music] amen it was in that baptism then jesus just made his way amen you know what john the baptist said he said there is one in your midst i do not know him but the very reason why i am baptizing is to make a way for him because the one who sent me to do this so drawing people into the water god told him to do that amen it was a new enforced doctrine to the church but it was the word of god the message for the hour praise be the name of the lord the one who sent me to baptize told me the man up on whom i see the pillow of fire coming down amen that's the one he will baptize you with the holy ghost amen and here comes the pill of fire only john was allowed to say it and you must believe john's testimony amen if you want to believe what the scientists say about it you go ahead but john had a testimony that the pill of fire came down he heard the voice the rest of the people it was not given to them you must read the bible as a love letter not like a newspaper and come out try to condemn your messenger no you would not get a thing if you approach it that way the bible says the paul heard the voice he saw the sound the the pillow fire the rest of the people didn't so when the prophet give a testimony believe it because the god has validated that man please be the name of the lord amen so john told them you need to forget about your cuddles your your lambs your pigeons your your your sacrifices so-called you got from moses behold the lamb of god amen behold the man the father have to come down those valleys have to go low believe that simplicity of god amen behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world but you see in this last days let's see the prophet says something here you know in the message the feast of the trumpet he says this i'm on paragraph 274 this was preached july the 19th 1964 in the morning he says he is making reference to another elijah here amen because we know the spirit of elijah comes how many times five times so he's making reference to the elijah to come and moses he says in reference i mean i'm sorry in revelation 11 call the ministry will be the ministry of moses and elijah calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the pentecostal tradition amen because when elijah of malachi 4 comes to laodicea the church was in the pentecostal edge pentecost called a pentecostal age that laodicea that's the latest revival we have in the denominations that's the church that kicked out jesus christ from the candlesticks from the church he was knocking the door to get to you amen so elijah's ministry today is to call the bride out of the tradition of laodicea before he laid down the sacrifice before he calls down the fire because the fire will not come down as long as the altar is in this array so he says so their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elijah calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angel's message called the bird out of the pentecostal tradition amen remember moses and elijah is to call israel out of the all atonement of lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the world amen so you see that's what john the baptist did he was calling the the patriarchs the fathers out of those sacrifices to introduce them to the word jesus christ the lamb who takes away the sins of the world but did they receive that no they had to reject that so that you the god will receive it in your day because they have rejected the sacrifice god is sending moses and elijah back to them for that very purpose but elijah must rebuild the altar first praise be the name of the lord thank you jesus and he says that very much all over the places here in this message thank you jesus so we see when the prophet came to this age he found a church in the condition where there was nowhere where to start he tells us he was pastor deacon trusting everything himself he said i think i've got it here let me see it says this this is in the church age i mean in the church order of 1963 he says this page 5 he says now when we dedicated the church i told you a little later i had something to talk to you about this is 1963. so he's making a reference to the previous dedication they had the old tabernacle how to set this thing in order the way it should be one because the theology of the church of that day it was loud decent condition it was not fit for the boy he says and you started off after living here we had ministers and so forth you see when the prophet when the lord called the prophet to the ministry and not long after he told him to do the work of an evangelist so he could not continue to pasture so he had to go and take the message out but the church bottom tabernacle continue as a church as a local church that's what he's talking about he says when you started off after living here we had ministers and so forth but now by the never being just a young among us come among us i thought it would be better for uh brother neville to get better established in the faith before i presented such things as i'm about to do now amen so for so many years he was rebuilding the altar same message paired with 150 he says look the way we used to do it years ago sister gertie was the pianist when i pastored here i had to be pastor deacon trustee everything else at once amen why he had to do that 17 years there was no one qualified to be deacon the altar was torn down laodicea will make deacon double triple made with people they will make minister divorce men and things like that it was a chaos but he had to rebuild the altar before laying down the sacrifice and he says but i had to do it now you don't have to do it that way see because you got men to carry this out amen so we are not rebuilding the altar the lord has already rebuilt the altar but to show you the condition of the edge women preachers you can cut your hair women wear a man's garment and sing in a car and put put the uh well uh make up and all those things that was not the condition for the blood of the lord jesus christ that was in the church when you go outside the same thing the women in the age have lost their position as a woman no wonder they call him to be women it no he was elijah he was trying to tell the people to get back in the line before he laid down the sacrifice the church was in such a condition the prophet was to be all that but after things start coming together and then he says now let's talk about that order amen not when the preacher is preaching and the sister gets up and speaking tongue because he's got the holy ghost she's got the holy ghost the church was in such a confusion this was just loud this year but you see many people thought that was the message the message was to come amen but the message will come oh my i don't know my tongue here let me read something here uh i'm in the message the i think it's though the anointed ones at the end time i'm gonna make it short here i know we're running against time here he's talking about the spirit that goes against the message the anointed word of the day matthew 24 24. and now he gets on saying paper of 258 he says notice compare them together now when you get home notice matthew 24 24 jesus speaking paul ii timothy 3 8 many orders and now compare that that's the spirit we see today second timothy 3 says men of reprobate mind they always go against the world ever learning never will come to the knowledge of the truth that's the edge we are living in he says uh page 2 59 he says and then after quoting matthew 24 24 uh 2nd timothy 3 8 he says and then put another scripture luke 17 30. malachi 4 as a genus and james with stood moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men it says not men singular but men plural anointed ones will resist the truth they will not resist the body bonham they will try to challenge the message by doing so they are challenging jesus christ the word 260. he says maybe i need to speak for this wow so many things he says in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1 to 7 we read it when you get home let me skip here it says and in that day janice and jambos will withstand anointed ones make believers and unbelievers the church formal and the pentecostals stand up against the true grain you know what the bible says let them alone their fully will be made manifest as theirs was see you understand now 260 and 261 he says revelation 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember seventh laodicea church edge the sounding of that angel when that church edge is done denominated and become a church edge when it's done it's in its pentecostal organization will send the messenger to that now listen he says what was each messenger what was martin luther a rebuke to the catholic right what was wesley a rebuke to the lutheran what was the pentecost a rebuke to them orders where has their life gone now amen away from an organization no more shock it's grain what is it a rebuke to the pentecost see to fulfill the scripture of this hour notice 262 though very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message amen so before he declares the message there was a work being done according to the bible he has to gather the loose ends what will left through the edges so when luther came he was the messenger he was anointed to do a work of reformation he was not in that uh ministry to catch the mysteries hidden mysteries he just did enough for the people of that age because there was coming in elijah whose ministry according to revelation 10 is to reveal the hidden truth amen so he's staying here not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pool healing some people grab that call it the message yes it's part of the message don't get me wrong amen it's part of the message but the altar was being rebuilt there was such a confusion in the in in the church a work was to be done second paul prophesying third paul the opening of the word the mysteries reveal because the word opened the anointed of the pill of fire on that word that what draws the bite that's what catches the bar that's what keeps the bite amen because she must be the word because of course the groom is the word the word must unite with the word it's not any word is the anointed word for the day the rest of the church will continue in the traditions in the church traditions in the name of the message in the name of christianity oh my god so today many have become legalists and all they have grabbed was you have to wear a long skirt don't cut your hair that's good pentecostal do that but when the word of god has taken its abode in your heart it's going to display the character of jesus christ it will teach you wife to be submissive to your husband amen amen husband love your wife and set every play everything in the right position [Music] the prophet said i'm close i see the time is gone it says how people were saying to to him that why you keep rebuking the ministers women don't teach them deep things you know how to to get in the spirit and you say how can i lay down the sacrifice when the altar is destroyed i must rebuild the altar first amen you must learn abc's first always believe christ when you get to that position where you can believe everything then you are in the position for the sacrifice to be laid down for the pill of fire to lick that the kindle that those wood praise be the name of the lord that's why god has kept that message that sacrifice so secret that no man will will know about it that third poll is between the bride and the groom nobody in between amen oh my my my but you see the word of god that has been quickened when it's revealed to your heart it's going to set you on fire nobody will be able to stop you not the preacher not the church not nothing because you have come on fire with the reality of of the genuine pentacles pentecost is not a denomination amen pentecost is a god in a man the pill of fire in your heart that's pentecost amen praise be the name of the lord but today we see the condition of the church we see laodicea showing its color maybe i sure with this as my last quote here i got something i would like to close with the prophet says this talking about elijah if i can found that i'm not well organized than my my pastor back there i wish i had this coat ready and we could read it together but didn't have much time for that but i think you trust me amen so let me go ahead and read something here and then we'll close my my my thank you jesus the prophet says in the church age let's see uh may not have it on me here well this is what the prophet says he says elijah the tishbite he preached for the showdown of mount carmon amen and john the baptist i sure have it and read it the way he says it let's see he says he came to the showdown of mount transfiguration and elijah of the last days amen his showdown is for the mount zion you see people can say anything they want to but there is a time when the showdown will be here for elijah the tishbite it was fire came down and approved who was white for john the baptist it was the mount transfiguration because john came and preached and introduced people said it was his cousin that's a family thing you see but it was the word of god god came down from heaven in the skies and here jesus with moses and elijah to his side and a voice it was not john's voice it was from heaven to prove that what john introduced was the truth amen behold my beloved son in whom i have pleasure to dwell in and stay heal ye him that was a god speaking back in john the baptist the pharisees may have argued all along all the ages but god came and spoke and vindicated him today it seems that everybody has something to say but there is a mount zion showdown coming where you are preaching the rupture i'm preaching the rapture who's going to go to the rupture that's what will tell and then you'll know oh that elijah was white that's the showdown miracle everybody's doing it amen even jesus said you will come in the last day and say i have preached i have moved the mountains i have prophesied i brought people to christ they say god help me i never knew you that's not a showdown the showdown is who is gonna go amen and the thing to get the people ready it's here that's the sacrifice jesus christ the same way john the baptist said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world there is another john amen is to introduce the messiah to this age the word of god amen jesus christ amen and then we'll know who's going to go god bless you i think i'll stop right here as i turn the service back to oh praise be the name of the lord as we invite the the musicians back to the thank you jesus we found many people who can't understand why we are so happy and i don't know if i'm singing this right help me out somebody if we know the song let's sing together [Music] oh yes [Music] where's god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and this [Music] i don't have the words they therefore don't believe it when you shout when you sing when you jump but there's something inside of you [Music] when they turn down the message the message has already gotten you heaven to me please god like heaven to [Music] [Applause] [Music] berlin [Music] this is like heaven to me oh this is like eventually and this is [Music] they never won't believe you [Music] [Applause] amen that's this good like given to me oh this is like kevin joey before i crossed [Music] [Applause] is [Music] we've crossed over jordan [Music] oh [Music] okay [Music] amen thank you jesus when you rejoice over the message the devil doesn't doesn't understand it but something is happening to you this is the revival of the vibe thank you jesus let's pray [Music] father these few words that have been spoken scattered here and there into your hands that i committed to your hands i commit your people may oh lord the work that you are doing it cut your attention and serve you with all that is within us to give you our best because you have done oh lord so much there is nothing we can do to match what you have done so we pray lord made a message found its place in our lives and really our lives become the word of god made flesh to see jesus christ manifested people can argue with our what we believe what we preach but let them lord be challenged with our lives when they see jesus christ made flesh living in us that's the purpose of this message lord so we pray that you bless this work that you have started here and bless your servant by the stephen and the people that you have brought under him lord and may the spirit of god continue to lead and guide to inspire so that the work of the lord will continue and bring glory to you may the the sick be healed the captive be set free may the the kingdom of god be proclaimed let the people be prepared for the rupture oh we believe the message we believe the messenger and we thank you for sending him lord now lord we have come to the end may your blessings continue to minister unto us to open up these things much more as we continue to follow we pray and ask these things lord in the name of jesus christ as we turn the service god to the pastor [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] we just heard brother shane go mention on uh on sunday by challenging the message they're challenging the word he said those words exactly i believe i believe you said that exactly and we just heard our brother say it this evening i thought that was pretty pretty neat you see the lord said the same thing sunday and wednesday back to back um also i love how um god always makes things hard to see sometimes so the elect will catch it and others won't and our brother brought something out about that this evening how john the baptist imagine i mean we know what baptism is because we've been practicing it for years but imagine no one knowing what it is but just seeing a man dump people in the water back up they didn't have an understanding of it some did not all and some just did it because it was the right thing to do but and also jesus even in the bible he said drink my flesh eat my flesh and drink my blood and it's just these sayings would be so hard for the human ear to hear and some of what brother branham taught is so hard for the human ear to hear but it's the it's the word within us the word within the bride that's able to reach out and catch it and i'm so thankful for that it's going home time we're justified by faith it's going on time we're sanctified by the blood going old time we're full of the holy ghost it's going home time and the bride has rapturing fit oh it's going home [Music] it's going on time we're [Music] it's going on time amen how many enjoy the word tonight praise the lord amen brother my angel let me ask you a question how many of my sermons not my sermon but the sermon the holy ghost preached through me how many of them have you listened to the one i preached in brother matambas and here have you ever have a chance to listen to any okay long long long time ago and i didn't talk to him so you know what it means right right you know what it means right so that was not a man he was the holy ghost in simplicity picking up everything we preach here for 19 sermon 19 sermon and the holy ghost was catching catch and catching catching and putting them together again and presented to you just like it happened with brother mcgary so god is saying something he's with us amen you know brother abel asked me a question like probably a month or a couple months ago he mentioned that people has been challenging brother branham they say that uh because i tattle the theory the unchanging pattern of god god does not change and they say well elijah did not get married they say elisha did not get married john the baptist did not get married and elijah going to the jews who won't get married so brother brother got married so that means brother branham did not follow the pattern and they are mocking saying the unchanging pattern of god and i let it go i answer him personally but he came back again somebody sent it to someone from this church saying the unchanging pattern of god elijah got married elijah got married and this this i say well i believe i need to talk to my church and the people online that are for this church the bible says that elijah did miracle amen the bible says that elisha did miracle amen elijah going to the jews will do miracle but the bible said john the baptist did no miracle zero he broke the pattern but jesus christ came and said john the baptist he's elijah what are you gonna do with it are you gonna tell me because elijah because john the baptist did not do what the other did he is not qualified to be elijah brother branham said their argument is thinner like a broth that is made out of the shadow of a chicken starved to death it's not me i'm giving you a coat i can give you maybe 15 of them that's what brother branham say in other words it is very very unstable idea very unstable argument all you have to do is humble before the scripture rumble before the message just receive the message accepted and the holy ghost will back you up and lead you through don't try to take the word and challenge the revealed word you don't do that go back to the reveal word and it's going to show you your position in the written word that's what the pharisee did what are you going to do with it so since john the baptist did not follow what the other did let's throw out the bible you see now what about if i sit with you and i'll show you one scripture going this way another scripture going the other way what are you gonna do the bible says it's jeremiah that spoke you go there jeremiah didn't speak it i have it what are you gonna do whether jeremiah spoke or not i believe both this message is the truth there is no argument you can bring against this message because this message was perfectly line up with the scripture there is no message that is so thoroughly lined up with the bible like the message of brother branham none of them if you don't see it yet it doesn't mean it's the other maybe the holy spirit knows what he's doing he might bring a minister and the minister will catch it and explain it to you are you there praise the lord i'm not going to preach let's stand and we will be praying so i thought to mention that to the church those that are not here especially the young people because you have been attacked on facebook whatsapp bombarded like a war we're not in war we are here to prepare the people to the rupture if you don't believe it leave us alone respect our position i don't understand why is it hard we have friends that are baptist we have people we work with it that are methodists we don't argue they don't get here to find our fault we shake hands how are you doing how is your family doing that's fun they respect what we stand and we respect what they stand if the lord open up their eyes praise the lord but what we stand here is the message of malachi 4 from kevor to caver are you there where he said karma we say comma you're a fanatic yes let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for bringing your servant all the way probably tired from workload to come back and to touch on the things that you minister to this church lord father it's showing how you're working through the fivefold ministry lord it's not a work of one man it is not a work of lord father where somebody can get glory lord all the glory goes back to the lord father we thank you are you working in a mysterious way in this church lord father you're moving us in the ways that are never even thought we're gonna get in this situation lord father but you knew and nothing gets you by surprise father thank you for giving us a fellowship thank you for the brother lord father he's open heart to come and to fellowship with us lord and support the work lord father may you strengthen his body may you remember each one of us here lord father tonight lord maybe your children came with major needs lord father somehow on the telephone on on the online lord father listening lord they might be struggling with something lord but i trust you spoke to them lord and if that which they need was not spoken may you minister unto them lord because you the god that gave us above what we ask lord and what we think lord solomon ask you one thing that you added more lord father we ask you that you spoke to us tonight lord and may you add more blessing lord father to this church guide us lord and if you tarry to come may you prepare our heart for the service lord father on sunday lord we commit each family under the blood protect us and be with us lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you take the name of jesus with you [Music] [Applause] [Music] precious
