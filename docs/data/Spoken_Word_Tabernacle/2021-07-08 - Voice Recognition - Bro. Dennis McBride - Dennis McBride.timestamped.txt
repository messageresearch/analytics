[14:44] testimonies this evening
[14:46] anybody have anything on their heart
[14:49] i have one myself actually when we were
[14:51] in indiana
[14:53] um we were outside of church getting
[14:54] ready to go in the church i think it was
[14:56] friday evening
[14:57] and i saw a brother walking like away
[15:00] from where i was at and i saw him from
[15:02] the back
[15:02] and i recognized his walk and it was a
[15:04] brother that i used to be in church with
[15:06] back in sarasota
[15:08] and he was actually a minister at the
[15:10] church in sarasota and
[15:12] his uh he went through a hard time in
[15:14] his life where his uh
[15:17] his wife and his kids left the message
[15:19] and
[15:20] he was all alone and his life kind of
[15:22] fell apart and
[15:23] i don't know what all his life went to i
[15:25] know it went to alcohol and he became an
[15:27] alcoholic and i know like
[15:29] he went out there and he i don't know if
[15:31] he got into drugs or not but
[15:33] as you as you would know i mean losing
[15:35] your wife and kids would would crush you
[15:37] and not not that that's an excuse but he
[15:39] was going through a hard season of his
[15:41] life and
[15:42] he left the church and i never saw him
[15:43] again i never saw him that was back when
[15:45] i was
[15:46] a teenager when i was like 15 or 16 or
[15:48] even younger
[15:49] and i never saw him and i was just
[15:52] sitting outside of church and i see him
[15:54] walking away like walking in the
[15:55] distance and i ran to him and i was like
[15:57] brother will
[15:58] and he turned around and i was like it
[16:00] is you and it was just
[16:02] i told him i said in that moment i told
[16:04] him i said if i get nothing else from
[16:06] these meetings this evening
[16:07] i said or this weekend i said it was
[16:09] enough for me to see you
[16:11] back serving god and i asked him his
[16:13] testimony and he shared his testimony
[16:15] with me he's been back in church for
[16:16] four years now
[16:17] and and i belie he told me his wife and
[16:20] kids are still not still not serving god
[16:22] at the time but
[16:24] yeah i for him to come back and forgot
[16:26] to restore him was
[16:28] a blessing it touched my heart and later
[16:30] on in service i think it was saturday
[16:32] we were people tarried and were praying
[16:35] at the altar
[16:36] and god put it on my heart to go pray
[16:37] for a couple people and i went back to
[16:39] my seat and before that brother left he
[16:41] came to our seat
[16:42] and he asked me and my wife to go to
[16:44] come to his house for dinner
[16:46] to talk to his kids because he knew the
[16:47] struggles that i went through in my life
[16:49] at the church that i was at
[16:51] and he wanted me to just be a testimony
[16:54] to his kids he wanted me to come talk to
[16:56] his kids and show them like
[16:57] even though i had hardship and i had
[16:59] struggles we're still in here we're
[17:00] still serving the message
[17:02] or serving the lord living this message
[17:04] and my wife as an example and
[17:06] i just thought lord lord is good he just
[17:08] even if that was the only reason for us
[17:10] to be out there in indiana i believe
[17:12] that that was enough so
[17:13] i was thankful to see that you know he's
[17:16] back in church he's serving god that's
[17:17] an incredible testimony and
[17:19] we just will remember his family this
[17:21] evening in prayer and i believe god will
[17:23] work that out
[17:24] sorry if it was a little lengthy but i
[17:26] just wanted to share that does anybody
[17:27] have a prayer request
[17:28] on their heart this evening anybody have

[43:19] really throughout the week to have
[43:21] time to go on the internet and listen to

[43:36] about between

[43:40] and
[43:41] trying to get myself together to go to
[43:42] work

[43:46] different activities i just don't have
[43:48] the time to

[43:53] of that nature but but god knows i
[43:56] but i know him and i i've always thanked

[44:37] you all have maybe at times a distance
[44:40] to travel and
[44:41] i don't know what time you have to be to
[44:42] work in the morning but
[44:44] we'll try to uh keep to the subject here
[44:48] and
[44:48] and try to have you out here as soon as
[44:51] possible as the lord will permit
[44:54] praise the lord all right let's let's go
[44:56] saints if we will
[44:58] to i want to go to samuel first
[45:01] first samuel chapter three
[45:11] first samuel chapter three
[45:14] starting at verse one
[45:20] first samuel 3 starting at verse 1 it
[45:22] says
[45:23] and the child samuel ministered unto the
[45:25] lord before eli
[45:27] and the word of the lord was precious in
[45:29] those days
[45:30] there was no open vision and it came to
[45:33] pass
[45:34] at that time when eli was laid down in
[45:36] his place
[45:37] and his eyes began to wax them that he
[45:40] could not see
[45:41] and air the lamp of god went out in the
[45:43] temple of god where the ark of god was
[45:46] and
[45:46] samuel was laid down to sleep it says
[45:50] that the lord called samuel
[45:52] and he answered him i now i want you to
[45:55] just
[45:55] really follow this these next few verses
[45:58] here as far as god communicating with
[46:00] samuel
[46:01] and how samuel is responding and where
[46:04] he's thinking the voice is coming from
[46:07] he says here am i he says and he ran
[46:10] unto eli
[46:12] so god was speaking to him but he ran to
[46:15] eli
[46:16] why do you think he did that
[46:21] and said here am i for thou called us me
[46:25] and he said i call not lie down again
[46:28] and he went and laid down
[46:30] and the lord called yet again samuel and
[46:33] samuel arose and went to eli
[46:35] and said here am i for thou didst call
[46:39] me
[46:40] and i mean because think about it saying
[46:42] he's he's grown up with
[46:44] eli he knows the tone and the pitch of
[46:48] eli's voice
[46:52] so when he heard this voice
[46:55] to him without a shadow of a doubt he
[46:56] said that's eli
[46:59] he said here i am jesus i say i didn't
[47:02] call you
[47:03] [Music]
[47:04] amen he goes on to say in verse seven
[47:08] it says now samuel did not yet now
[47:10] listen
[47:11] samuel did not yet know the lord
[47:15] neither was the word of the lord yet
[47:17] revealed unto him
[47:20] and the lord called samuel again the
[47:23] third time and he arose and went to eli
[47:25] and said
[47:26] here am i for thou didst call me and eli
[47:30] perceived that the lord had called the
[47:32] child
[47:33] therefore eli said unto him unto samuel
[47:36] go lie down and it is
[47:38] and it shall be if he called thee that
[47:40] thou should say
[47:41] speak lord for thy servant heareth
[47:44] so samuel went and laid down in his
[47:46] place and the lord came and stood
[47:50] and called as at other times samuel
[47:52] samuel
[47:54] then samuel answered speak for thy
[47:57] servant
[47:58] heareth i have one more scripture saints
[48:02] i like to read
[48:09] it's in john chapter 8
[48:13] in john chapter 8.
[48:19] i also want to reiterate uh what the
[48:22] brother the song conductor mentioned
[48:24] concerning uh sister zaddy
[48:28] um it wasn't until tonight that i
[48:30] realized she came here
[48:33] because she's come down to brother
[48:35] anderson's church and has blessed the
[48:37] church
[48:38] amen and i've always appreciated the
[48:40] songs that she sung because you can hear
[48:42] the heart that it comes from
[48:44] and there's an anointing that comes from
[48:47] a song that sung from that kind of a
[48:49] heart
[48:50] amen so it's not so much so how well of
[48:53] her how
[48:54] how how good a person's voice sounds
[48:57] is where it's coming from and when god
[49:01] is in it his spirit just kind of just
[49:03] moves along with that voice you know and
[49:06] you can
[49:06] feel it amen so we thank god for her
[49:11] so john chapter 8 it says in verse 39
[49:14] they answered and said unto him
[49:15] abraham is our father jesus saith unto
[49:19] them
[49:19] if ye were abraham's children you would
[49:21] do the works of abraham
[49:23] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[49:26] that have told you the truth which have
[49:28] which i have heard of god he says this
[49:31] did not abraham
[49:32] says you do the deeds of your father
[49:34] then say if they unto him
[49:36] we be not born of fornication we have
[49:39] one father even god
[49:41] jesus said unto them if god were your
[49:43] father ye would love me
[49:45] for i proceeded forth and came forth and
[49:47] came from god
[49:48] neither came out of myself but he sent
[49:51] me
[49:52] now notice what he says here now
[49:56] he says why do you not understand my
[49:58] speech
[50:01] he says even because ye cannot hear my
[50:03] word
[50:06] year of your father the devil and the
[50:08] lust of your father ye will do
[50:10] he says he was a murderer from the
[50:11] beginning and abode not in the truth
[50:13] because there is no truth in him
[50:16] he says when he speaketh the lie he
[50:17] speaketh of his own
[50:19] for he is a liar and the father of it he
[50:22] says and because i tell you the truth
[50:24] ye believe me not which of you convinces
[50:26] me of sin and if i
[50:28] say the truth why do you not believe me
[50:31] he that is of god
[50:33] does what saints heareth god's words
[50:37] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[50:40] are not of god
[50:42] let's pray heavenly father please help
[50:44] us lord
[50:46] these are your people father this is
[50:48] your service
[50:49] god please lord help us to yield
[50:52] ourselves lord and
[50:54] just to be an oracle unto you father by
[50:56] your grace
[50:57] bless this church lord every member the
[51:00] pastor lord
[51:01] lord they mention the church that they
[51:03] have that they've been working on father
[51:06] how you've opened doors for them father
[51:08] and you're causing things to progress
[51:11] we just pray that you will continue to
[51:12] bless every effort lord
[51:14] and continue to move the enemy out of
[51:16] the way as he would try to block the
[51:18] progress of what you've ordained
[51:20] god help us all we pray tonight in jesus
[51:23] christ's name we ask it
[51:24] amen god bless you
[51:37] it's kind of a strange topic but uh
[51:41] it's just something that god was dealing
[51:43] with me on
[51:45] um i believe it's very important to each
[51:48] one of us
[51:50] a lot of what will be said tonight of
[51:52] course i'm sure you've heard before
[51:54] but i just pray that god take it and
[51:57] just
[51:58] give it to you in the way that you stand
[52:00] in need of
[52:03] amen so by god's grace tonight saints i
[52:06] want to try to
[52:06] to minister on a topic of voice
[52:09] recognition
[52:12] amen voice recognition
[52:16] uh this is very important i believe i
[52:19] know it's very important to me
[52:21] all right uh cause i don't know about
[52:24] you but
[52:25] uh i have a lot of thoughts that flow
[52:28] through my mind
[52:30] every day amen and i'm not the only one
[52:34] we all do
[52:36] amen but it's it's very important
[52:39] that that we be able to recognize
[52:43] where the thoughts are coming from
[52:46] um before
[52:51] i didn't notice i was i was in the place
[52:53] of samuel
[52:55] amen i didn't know the lord for those of
[52:58] you of course
[52:59] many of you don't know me but i grew up
[53:01] in the streets
[53:04] you see i didn't grow up in church i
[53:07] grew up in a drug house
[53:09] you know my mom was a drug addict
[53:12] she used crack cocaine and marijuana and
[53:16] all sorts of things and i was i'm the
[53:18] only child i don't have a brother or
[53:20] sister
[53:22] so i grew up in that kind of an
[53:23] atmosphere it wasn't always like that
[53:26] but it was certain people that was
[53:28] introduced into my mom's life
[53:30] and i could before my eyes see our whole
[53:33] life just change around
[53:35] it just it just turned in the wrong
[53:37] direction and it got to the point
[53:39] to where i had to move out and go live
[53:41] with my grandmother
[53:42] because my grandmother was very
[53:44] protective over me
[53:46] but nonetheless though i didn't grow up
[53:48] in a church going home
[53:52] you know but i can all i can say that by
[53:55] the grace of
[53:56] god i can truly say that by the grace of
[53:58] god i
[53:59] am what i am today and that's that's all
[54:03] tied into predestination regardless of
[54:06] what upbringing i had and what
[54:08] atmosphere i grew up within
[54:10] satan couldn't stop what god had
[54:12] ordained
[54:14] amen so i had to come to this place
[54:17] amen but nonetheless though i grew up in
[54:20] a worldly a worldly household
[54:22] and everything that you wouldn't want to
[54:25] be around i was forced to be around
[54:27] because it was my family
[54:29] you know the vulgarity and just
[54:31] everything you know so
[54:33] i'm growing up in that atmosphere and
[54:35] and and and they're on the closest thing
[54:38] i
[54:38] had to to to what i would consider to be
[54:42] god
[54:42] was my grandmother she
[54:46] she didn't fully live for god but she
[54:48] was the closest thing i had because she
[54:50] acknowledged him more
[54:52] than anybody else she had her mahelia
[54:55] jackson
[54:56] records she had the records and she
[54:59] would go into the room and
[55:00] and she would turn the mahelia jackson
[55:02] on and she would blast it
[55:05] you know all throughout the house and
[55:07] even though i heard it at a young age i
[55:09] didn't want to hear it
[55:10] you know so i would go in my room and i
[55:12] would turn up real loud my
[55:14] new addition and my boys
[55:18] boys to men so i i couldn't hear mahelia
[55:21] jackson
[55:22] but nonetheless though she was the
[55:24] closest thing i had
[55:26] so long story short it wasn't until
[55:30] i i met my wife who wasn't my wife at
[55:33] that time
[55:34] we she just started going to my high
[55:35] school and it wasn't until i met her
[55:38] that
[55:39] that through her and through her family
[55:42] i began to be exposed
[55:45] to the voice of god
[55:48] and i'm not talking about so much so the
[55:51] books and the tapes
[55:54] i'm saying as far as god actually
[55:56] speaking to me
[55:58] and i didn't know he was speaking to me
[55:59] i didn't know him
[56:02] something was speaking to me but i
[56:03] didn't know what was speaking to me i
[56:05] was like
[56:06] samuel god was talking directly to me
[56:09] but my
[56:10] i i i wasn't familiar with his voice
[56:16] i remember the first night that i i
[56:19] believe i received
[56:20] revelation of a part of his word it was
[56:23] my wife myself and her mother sitting in
[56:25] the kitchen
[56:26] and they were talking about something
[56:28] and and i don't know
[56:30] god was dealing with my heart so it's
[56:31] like my i began to be more and more
[56:33] interested in conversations that were
[56:36] pertaining to the word
[56:38] and so i was just listening to what they
[56:40] were talking about
[56:42] and then all of a sudden i began to
[56:43] actually understand
[56:45] and it was it got to it got to a point
[56:48] to where it was overwhelming
[56:50] to i couldn't sit down no more i just
[56:52] got up and started walking back and
[56:54] forth across the kitchen floor
[56:56] and i began to speak the things that was
[56:58] coming to my heart
[57:00] and my mother-in-law who had been in the
[57:02] way for a while
[57:04] she or she she recognized something
[57:08] she recognized something and i couldn't
[57:10] even recognize i just knew what was
[57:11] happening
[57:13] you see but it took some time and even
[57:16] now
[57:16] i don't have it all together like that i
[57:18] don't i
[57:19] even now since god talks to me and i
[57:22] don't pick up on it it ain't just me but
[57:26] we all are in that place
[57:33] and what satan doesn't want satan
[57:36] doesn't want us to become
[57:38] too in tune to the voice of god
[57:43] to the point to where we can recognize
[57:45] it and then
[57:46] yield to it
[57:50] so he has all sorts of ways to try to
[57:52] keep our minds and our spirits
[57:55] all bogged up and bogged down
[58:00] there's time saints where i know i know
[58:02] i can speak for myself
[58:03] where i know that the lord has placed it
[58:06] upon my heart to go and pray
[58:11] it's not that i hear an audible voice
[58:14] it's just like it's just i can't even
[58:16] explain it
[58:18] but it's a voice but it's not an
[58:21] audible voice like that it's just
[58:24] something that just kind of presses upon
[58:26] my heart and i hear something
[58:29] go and pray and then i try to make my
[58:33] way to go and pray
[58:34] but listen now
[58:38] see how many realize satan watches us
[58:41] our prophet told us that he studies us
[58:43] isn't that right
[58:46] he said if you're going to go and do
[58:48] something that's pertaining to god he
[58:50] said one of the things you can do to
[58:51] help yourself
[58:52] is not speak it out loud he said because
[58:56] if you speak it out loud
[58:57] then you give satan a a course to take
[59:01] to try to forerun you and to try to
[59:04] hinder
[59:05] what it is is on your heart to do for
[59:07] god
[59:09] and it's times when i'm sitting there
[59:10] and i i felt this impression i need to
[59:13] go and pray
[59:14] and sometimes i'll tell my wife i'm
[59:16] gonna go here and pray
[59:20] next thing you know the phone ringing
[59:22] listen now i want to be very careful in
[59:24] what i'm saying
[59:26] [Music]
[59:30] it it's a saint that's calling me
[59:36] [Music]
[59:41] and so because it's a saint you answer
[59:48] and once you answer then it happened to
[59:52] me recently then it dawns on me
[59:54] i shouldn't answer that phone
[59:56] [Music]
[59:58] because now i'm in a conversation but
[1:00:00] yet i got my heart being pulled to
[1:00:01] prayer
[1:00:02] but now i'm in a conversation that i
[1:00:04] shouldn't be in listen now
[1:00:06] it's not that it's sinful but it's it's
[1:00:09] idle talk
[1:00:12] it's not as important as what as the
[1:00:15] voice that told me to go and pray
[1:00:18] i should have obeyed that voice
[1:00:23] but satan saw what was happening and
[1:00:25] listen saints
[1:00:26] satan knows what happens in prayer
[1:00:31] amen the more we pray and the more we
[1:00:34] give ourselves over to the things of god
[1:00:36] guess what
[1:00:37] we become more sensitive
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:41] amen we're able to be better led because
[1:00:44] we're in an atmosphere now
[1:00:46] now our minds are gathered from all over
[1:00:48] the place
[1:00:49] and placed directly on god
[1:00:52] now his instruction and his
[1:00:54] communication can become more
[1:00:56] clear in those places and satan don't
[1:00:58] want that
[1:01:04] so i'm talking to somebody that's not
[1:01:06] trying to do me wrong or any harm
[1:01:10] but they just don't realize that
[1:01:12] something
[1:01:14] caused them to call me at that moment
[1:01:20] you understand what i'm saying it's okay
[1:01:23] to talk on the phone
[1:01:24] the saints but then it's when god is
[1:01:26] calling you
[1:01:30] sometimes you just got to let the phone
[1:01:31] ring
[1:01:35] now that's what i've been having to do
[1:01:37] more so now
[1:01:39] so i see so and so is calling me but
[1:01:43] i need to go take care of this first
[1:01:46] so we'll talk to all day long brother
[1:01:49] branham told us the greatest battle
[1:01:50] that's ever fought is where
[1:01:54] and how many realize right now right now
[1:01:56] at this second
[1:01:57] at this moment the battle is raging
[1:02:00] right now in people's minds
[1:02:04] the devil is saying all sorts of things
[1:02:07] god is speaking also
[1:02:11] amen but depending on where listen now
[1:02:15] depending on
[1:02:16] uh where we've been spending our time if
[1:02:19] we've been neglecting
[1:02:21] prayer if we've been neglecting the
[1:02:23] reading of the word or the hearing of
[1:02:25] the word
[1:02:26] more than likely spiritually things are
[1:02:29] a little dull
[1:02:34] watch this this is from
[1:02:38] uh let me see what message this here
[1:02:40] this really struck me here saints
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:52] this is from hear his voice
[1:02:55] he says every one of you people who
[1:02:57] profess to be christians get yourself
[1:02:59] quiet before him
[1:03:05] prayer is so important
[1:03:09] you see because we all are witnesses of
[1:03:11] this you can pray right
[1:03:14] and you're praying because you got
[1:03:16] burdens on your heart things you're
[1:03:17] releasing before god
[1:03:19] just you might be even giving god
[1:03:21] thanksgiving or what have you
[1:03:22] but but the voice of god speaking back
[1:03:25] to us
[1:03:29] sometimes that's mist
[1:03:35] i mean to realize you got to pray
[1:03:36] through
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:41] cause just you you trying to
[1:03:45] you trying to break into a place but
[1:03:47] satan sees your efforts
[1:03:50] and even while you're on your knees you
[1:03:52] got all kinds of faults that begin to
[1:03:54] come to your mind
[1:03:57] why it's a spiritual war that devil is
[1:04:01] right there trying to hinder you
[1:04:02] from tapping in to that resource
[1:04:07] amen from that flow of your shady eye
[1:04:11] to receive what you stand in need of at
[1:04:13] that time
[1:04:16] so why are you in prayer brother brother
[1:04:18] even talked about it he's in prayer
[1:04:20] trying to get a message from god
[1:04:21] and satan began to cause his attention
[1:04:24] to go to nets
[1:04:30] i'm talking about the practical side of
[1:04:32] this now
[1:04:33] nets that are flying around his head
[1:04:35] satan is trying to get his attention on
[1:04:37] those gnats
[1:04:39] satan is trying to get him to feel the
[1:04:41] impression of the rocks that was on his
[1:04:43] knees
[1:04:44] while he was using that as a tactic
[1:04:47] saints
[1:04:48] to cause him to come out of prayer
[1:04:54] moving simplicity but understand me
[1:04:56] satan moving simplicity also
[1:04:59] he can move so common and so so simple
[1:05:02] that you can miss it
[1:05:04] which one of us would have thought that
[1:05:05] gnats flying around our head was the
[1:05:07] working of a devil
[1:05:10] that would try to hinder us you get to
[1:05:14] hearing the buzzing of the net you
[1:05:15] trying to swat
[1:05:17] next thing man
[1:05:21] you might say well let me just go pray
[1:05:22] later i mean let me go find someplace
[1:05:24] else to pray and why are you trying to
[1:05:26] go find someone else somewhere else to
[1:05:27] play somebody call you on the phone
[1:05:30] or you remember something or whatever
[1:05:32] just how the enemy operates
[1:05:41] you understand what i'm saying
[1:05:47] watch how he says this every one of you
[1:05:49] people who professes to be christians
[1:05:51] get yourself quiet before him
[1:05:54] he says don't let the washing hinder
[1:06:00] i need to put a load of clothes in the
[1:06:02] wash
[1:06:04] but god has already spoken he wants you
[1:06:06] to pray
[1:06:09] see as simple as that sisters and even
[1:06:11] brothers because i help my wife wash
[1:06:13] clothes too
[1:06:16] praise the lord he says don't let the
[1:06:18] washing hinder don't let the work
[1:06:20] hinder don't let nothing hinder
[1:06:24] don't let nobody know what you're doing
[1:06:27] he says just go before him he says get
[1:06:31] up in the woods somewhere
[1:06:32] get out in the side of the road he says
[1:06:35] go into the secret closet and close the
[1:06:37] door
[1:06:38] when the kids gets at school he says he
[1:06:40] says there
[1:06:41] get down on your knees you've heard all
[1:06:44] kinds of voices
[1:06:45] everywhere amen from the time we get up
[1:06:50] to the time we go to sleep
[1:06:52] we're bombarded with many voices amen
[1:06:55] but we it is within our best
[1:06:57] benefit amen to begin to recognize what
[1:07:00] those voices are and where they coming
[1:07:02] from
[1:07:05] so we can do what we can ignore the
[1:07:08] voice of the enemy
[1:07:13] sometimes you might have something going
[1:07:15] on in your life right
[1:07:17] it can be anything you could be from a
[1:07:19] bill or something that's kind of
[1:07:21] you know a little outside of your budget
[1:07:23] or you can have some sort of a
[1:07:25] issue going on in your body or whatever
[1:07:27] the case might be but
[1:07:29] you you don't realize that that it's
[1:07:31] actually satan will come
[1:07:34] and he'll stay in your mind
[1:07:37] and speak to you in a certain way to
[1:07:40] cause you to gain a certain perspective
[1:07:42] of your situation issue or whatever the
[1:07:45] case might be
[1:07:49] there are some people here that have
[1:07:51] spiritual problems
[1:07:55] right and satan talks to you
[1:07:58] but listen
[1:08:03] you're not you don't recognize that it's
[1:08:05] him
[1:08:08] i know people personally
[1:08:11] listen now i ain't nobody
[1:08:15] but sometimes when you listen to a
[1:08:17] person you can hear
[1:08:20] you can you can hear what voice they've
[1:08:23] been
[1:08:24] listening to watch and you can see that
[1:08:27] they don't realize
[1:08:28] it's the voice of the enemy
[1:08:35] some people are plaguing their minds
[1:08:38] always
[1:08:39] worrying about something or you know
[1:08:41] just something that just
[1:08:42] always lays heavy water makes something
[1:08:44] lay heavy on you like that
[1:08:46] to make you worry amen to make you
[1:08:49] overburden overwhelmed
[1:08:51] anxious god don't communicate like that
[1:08:56] and once you're able to realize that
[1:08:58] it's not the voice of god listen
[1:09:01] and it's not you either it's something
[1:09:04] that's trying to get you
[1:09:05] to think like it wants you to think
[1:09:09] it wants you to be in the fear it wants
[1:09:11] you to worry
[1:09:12] it wants you to doubt
[1:09:15] so you find yourself thinking about your
[1:09:17] situations
[1:09:18] it might even be relationships or family
[1:09:21] problems or something
[1:09:23] and the devil always wants you to look
[1:09:25] at it from a negative slant
[1:09:28] he wants you to feel like it's hopeless
[1:09:30] ain't nothing to be done about it
[1:09:32] it's too big for you you can't take much
[1:09:34] more
[1:09:35] that's a lie
[1:09:39] amen i don't care how long you've been
[1:09:42] dealing with a certain
[1:09:44] physical issue in your body how many
[1:09:46] realize god is still a healer
[1:09:51] that devil want to make us feel
[1:09:52] comfortable with these issues in our
[1:09:54] body amen
[1:09:55] but god is still here to perform his
[1:09:58] word saints
[1:10:03] but if we're not careful
[1:10:06] you can hear the voice of satan
[1:10:10] and not identify it as the voice of
[1:10:13] satan
[1:10:15] you just take it as is you
[1:10:26] watch this lord have mercy
[1:10:31] this right here is from the message of
[1:10:33] life is the healer
[1:10:35] pay attention to this very careful this
[1:10:37] thing is we ain't going to be much
[1:10:38] longer
[1:10:40] he says but now now this is a prayer
[1:10:42] line
[1:10:44] i want i want you to pay real good
[1:10:46] attention now to the activity
[1:10:49] because god is there but satan is there
[1:10:53] also
[1:10:55] how many realize that peter was in the
[1:10:58] very presence of god
[1:11:05] that brother had been walking on the
[1:11:07] water
[1:11:11] think about it i want i want you to
[1:11:13] think about this real good now
[1:11:16] don't don't let this one miss you pass
[1:11:18] you by saints
[1:11:20] that brother saw christ walking on the
[1:11:22] water
[1:11:24] and he said lord if that be you bid me
[1:11:27] come
[1:11:29] didn't he say that jesus said come
[1:11:34] that brother got out of that boat and
[1:11:36] started walking on water like it was
[1:11:37] solid ground
[1:11:40] i don't know how many steps he took but
[1:11:43] he was actually walking on water
[1:11:45] i'm talking about the power of the enemy
[1:11:48] in his words
[1:11:50] how many realized satan never laid a
[1:11:53] hand on eve
[1:11:56] i know the serpent did but hear me out
[1:11:57] before anything ever happened
[1:11:59] satan just listened he seized her
[1:12:03] and he began to control her by his words
[1:12:11] where did she make her mistake she
[1:12:13] considered what he was saying
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:19] so peter walking on water
[1:12:22] the lord standing out there on water he
[1:12:25] walks to the lord
[1:12:26] standing right in front of christ in
[1:12:29] arms distance
[1:12:33] and the devil was right there
[1:12:37] listen and through thoughts
[1:12:40] he didn't recognize the devil's voice
[1:12:45] the devil in his mind began to speak
[1:12:48] things
[1:12:49] to make him focus in on how how the
[1:12:53] water was around him
[1:12:54] listen now listen now
[1:12:58] that brother was anointed amen under the
[1:13:01] inspiration and power of god
[1:13:03] but satan was able to pull him out of
[1:13:06] the anointing of god
[1:13:07] by his voice listen and what he was
[1:13:10] attracting his attention to
[1:13:14] and when his focus
[1:13:17] oh he began to he he
[1:13:20] listened when his mind when his thoughts
[1:13:24] shifted
[1:13:25] he physically began to sink and change
[1:13:28] his situation
[1:13:32] amen saints whenever god has told you by
[1:13:36] his word
[1:13:36] you've been healed amen and the devil
[1:13:39] trying to draw your attention
[1:13:40] to a symptom or something like that
[1:13:43] listen now
[1:13:44] you can actually listen you can actually
[1:13:47] cause your
[1:13:48] healing to leave you
[1:13:55] satan by the power of his word listen
[1:13:58] satan is a master psychologist
[1:14:03] that's all he does it's playing the
[1:14:06] human mind
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:09] brother branham says he comes in full
[1:14:12] reasoning
[1:14:18] let me get to this watch this now
[1:14:22] prayer line this woman is in the
[1:14:25] presence of god
[1:14:27] but satan is there also
[1:14:30] watch this conversation he says now just
[1:14:33] till i
[1:14:33] till i catch your spirit again he says
[1:14:36] yes sir i
[1:14:37] see it coming back you have a shadow
[1:14:40] dark shadow that's following you which
[1:14:41] means that you got a cancer
[1:14:44] that's right he says and the cancer is
[1:14:46] on the leg
[1:14:47] he says that's the left leg that's right
[1:14:49] isn't it that's true
[1:14:51] he says i want to ask you something he
[1:14:54] says
[1:14:54] you have had a something accuse you in
[1:14:57] your lifetime
[1:15:00] even since a young lady that you have a
[1:15:03] desire and a feeling that god has
[1:15:05] something for you to do
[1:15:07] in his vineyard he says now as the
[1:15:10] people out there
[1:15:11] listen listen to how he says this now
[1:15:14] see he's sensitive
[1:15:17] listen he's consecrated himself to god
[1:15:22] see he lived a consecrated life
[1:15:26] see satan tried to make us play around
[1:15:28] with this stuff
[1:15:31] give god a little bit of time give
[1:15:32] everything else a lot of time
[1:15:35] and we wonder why we find ourselves
[1:15:38] defeated more times than we should be
[1:15:42] we're not giving ourselves over
[1:15:45] consecrating ourselves listen
[1:15:47] to the level that god is calling for
[1:15:50] i ain't gonna say to the level that you
[1:15:52] feel like
[1:15:57] but this brother is in a place and so
[1:16:00] now he's in such a place with god
[1:16:02] until that he's very sensitive to the
[1:16:04] spirit realm
[1:16:06] and he recognizes voices and where
[1:16:08] they're coming from
[1:16:12] watch what he says here now he says now
[1:16:16] lord have mercy where am i at
[1:16:20] this thing just jumped up on me praise
[1:16:23] the lord
[1:16:25] amen

[1:16:32] to get it right back again
[1:16:37] here we go all right here we go
[1:16:40] he says now as the people out there a
[1:16:42] thought
[1:16:43] meets me now from satan
[1:16:51] do you remember when peter jesus had
[1:16:54] just finished talking to peter and the
[1:16:56] disciples letting them know what he had
[1:16:58] to go through
[1:17:01] peter's standing right there listen now
[1:17:06] peter did not feel the devil
[1:17:10] he didn't recognize the change
[1:17:16] i'ma tell now listen saints it happens
[1:17:18] to all of us
[1:17:21] we've all been anointed by wrong spirits
[1:17:26] peter didn't hear the devil he didn't
[1:17:28] feel the devil
[1:17:30] listen he didn't know that the devil had
[1:17:32] begun to speak through his lips
[1:17:37] but what he began to say was contrary to
[1:17:40] the word
[1:17:42] and the bible says that jesus turned to
[1:17:45] his beloved brother
[1:17:47] his son his apostle and he rebuked him
[1:17:51] and he says get thee behind me
[1:17:56] satan where was he at
[1:17:59] he was speaking through peter
[1:18:03] and peter didn't even recognize it
[1:18:05] [Music]
[1:18:10] listen unless god helps us saints
[1:18:14] i know that we've been in this situation
[1:18:16] and unless god helps us
[1:18:18] we'll be in this situation too many more
[1:18:20] times
[1:18:24] say can actually get in your mind and
[1:18:27] speak through your lips and you're not
[1:18:29] even aware of what's going on
[1:18:32] but when we're in when we're in a
[1:18:33] consecrated place
[1:18:35] amen then the voice of god becomes
[1:18:38] more clear to us isn't that right
[1:18:41] and god is able to expose and reveal
[1:18:44] where the enemy is
[1:18:47] so now the prophet is here now and he's
[1:18:50] saying now
[1:18:50] a thought meets me now from satan
[1:18:53] outside
[1:18:54] of the outside realm that tells me not a
[1:18:57] devil is trying to fight against him
[1:18:59] while the lord is using him to deal with
[1:19:01] the woman
[1:19:02] he says satan thought came to him and
[1:19:05] tells me
[1:19:06] any woman has that desire
[1:19:09] trying to make him doubt the voice
[1:19:11] that's talking to him
[1:19:20] all right here the ballot is raising in
[1:19:22] the prophet's mind
[1:19:24] while he's under the anointing
[1:19:28] trying to do him trying to do what
[1:19:30] trying to cause him to come out of the
[1:19:32] anointing
[1:19:33] he says i'll go and show shame that he's
[1:19:36] a liar
[1:19:38] see he's in a place now where satan
[1:19:40] can't hide
[1:19:41] when satan spoke he recognized it he
[1:19:44] wasn't like peter a man
[1:19:46] he recognized it and he began to come
[1:19:48] against it
[1:19:50] how blessed saints would it be for you
[1:19:52] and i every time an evil spirit tries to
[1:19:55] come to us
[1:19:55] and make us yield to it to be able to
[1:19:58] recognize that voice
[1:20:00] and rebuild the devil
[1:20:03] versus finding ourselves yielding
[1:20:06] and then after certain things are done
[1:20:09] are said then
[1:20:10] realizing that oh that was an evil
[1:20:12] spirit upon
[1:20:18] says by this and you know that i'm
[1:20:20] telling you the truth and you know
[1:20:21] whether it's god or not
[1:20:23] he says you've never been spiritually
[1:20:25] that's how he says this he told the
[1:20:26] woman
[1:20:27] you've never been spiritual enough in
[1:20:29] your life
[1:20:31] to accept what god has promised you
[1:20:35] spiritual health through consecration
[1:20:40] how many of us in here tonight have
[1:20:43] failed
[1:20:43] to become spiritual enough
[1:20:46] everybody in here want to know their
[1:20:48] purpose right
[1:20:54] that's just for you to ponder in your
[1:20:56] own heart
[1:20:58] how much are you giving yourself to god
[1:21:03] you've never been spiritual enough in
[1:21:05] your life to accept what god has
[1:21:07] promised you
[1:21:08] to do he says that is right isn't it
[1:21:11] you're needing the holy ghost he says
[1:21:12] that's exactly right
[1:21:14] you're seeking for it now the baptism of
[1:21:16] the holy ghost
[1:21:17] he says that's thus saith the lord
[1:21:21] he says and beside that if i tell you
[1:21:24] something he says
[1:21:25] you were very happy today you had to
[1:21:27] make a big decision
[1:21:29] you were supposed to fly away from this
[1:21:31] city you are not from this city you were
[1:21:33] supposed to fly away
[1:21:34] from here to a funeral service and you
[1:21:37] put it off now listen
[1:21:38] you put it off in order to get to the
[1:21:41] meeting tonight
[1:21:42] what told her to put it off it was god
[1:21:47] but she didn't know it was god she just
[1:21:50] thought it was a thought or a decision
[1:21:52] she needed to make
[1:21:53] she didn't realize it was god talking to
[1:21:56] her
[1:21:57] isn't that something so likewise the
[1:21:59] devil could talk to you and you not
[1:22:01] realize it but god also can talk to you
[1:22:03] and you not realize it
[1:22:07] and you put it off in order to get to
[1:22:09] the meeting tonight because
[1:22:10] something told you that you was going to
[1:22:13] receive a prayer card
[1:22:15] what was that something that was jesus
[1:22:17] christ
[1:22:18] when you received the prayer card not
[1:22:20] being number one
[1:22:22] you were surprised he says but when the
[1:22:24] angel of the lord so ordained it
[1:22:26] that i call you first you were happy he
[1:22:28] says that's right he says is that the
[1:22:30] truth he says now you are healed
[1:22:32] in the name of the lord god because god
[1:22:34] has ordained it to be so
[1:22:36] he says going he says go and may god be
[1:22:38] with you my dear sister
[1:22:43] so in that one meeting that the devil
[1:22:45] talked to the prophet
[1:22:48] the prophet talked back to the devil the
[1:22:51] devil talked to the woman
[1:22:52] the woman didn't know what was going on
[1:22:54] but the grace of god prevailed
[1:23:00] even though we've not been in a place
[1:23:01] that i believe we should be spiritually
[1:23:03] how many
[1:23:04] realize the grace of god
[1:23:08] amen the grace of god saints
[1:23:11] he fills in so many gaps for us
[1:23:14] amen are they because we've been the
[1:23:16] best or or the most obedient or anything
[1:23:18] like that
[1:23:19] it's just because of who we are and what
[1:23:21] we mean to him
[1:23:26] i'm gonna leave you with this one saints
[1:23:34] this is some questions and answers now
[1:23:39] it's a question that came to brother
[1:23:41] branham
[1:23:43] and maybe somebody in here might have
[1:23:44] this exact same question i don't know
[1:23:48] cause i want to say this all right even
[1:23:50] though we're here tonight
[1:23:52] we're here because we realize we need
[1:23:53] help
[1:23:56] we realize we ain't where we need to be
[1:23:58] right
[1:24:00] and amongst us saints i know that there
[1:24:02] are spiritual conditions
[1:24:06] some people are bound by certain bad
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:14] habits
[1:24:17] but because you are bride
[1:24:21] you feel all uneasy
[1:24:25] you maybe even have tried to give
[1:24:27] yourself over to certain things
[1:24:30] and god by his grace wouldn't let you go
[1:24:34] as far as the devil wanted to take you
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:39] but yet you play around with certain
[1:24:41] things too much
[1:24:44] things you should stay away from you
[1:24:46] find yourself being attracted to
[1:24:48] and you know that it's wrong you know
[1:24:49] you've been battling with it but you
[1:24:51] just
[1:24:52] find yourself yielding too much
[1:24:55] and because of a lack of a consecrated
[1:24:58] life
[1:24:59] amen you find yourself being weak
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:07] and having to repent over and over and
[1:25:09] over again asking the lord to forgive
[1:25:11] you
[1:25:14] but in the devil see now he sees what's
[1:25:16] going on
[1:25:18] god sees what's going see god will god
[1:25:20] allow god will allow you to go through
[1:25:22] things like that
[1:25:24] god could just take everything right
[1:25:26] away from you right
[1:25:28] but he wants you to want it gone
[1:25:33] if you take it away away from you and
[1:25:34] you still desiring it
[1:25:36] that ain't no good but god want to bring
[1:25:39] you
[1:25:40] to a place to where you see what it is
[1:25:42] for what it is
[1:25:44] and you you begin to put it down
[1:25:46] completely
[1:25:48] when you get tired enough of it
[1:25:51] listen the time is taken away from you
[1:25:54] it's robbing you of so much
[1:25:58] for a little moment of some kind of
[1:26:00] fleshy pleasure of some kind
[1:26:02] maybe you got somebody in your life you
[1:26:04] ain't supposed to have in your life
[1:26:06] maybe you're having a conversation with
[1:26:09] people you shouldn't be having
[1:26:10] and in your heart you know it
[1:26:15] but you feel chained you feel like
[1:26:19] like you can't break loose you tried but
[1:26:22] that lust is so pulsating inside of you
[1:26:26] so you find yourself falling again and
[1:26:28] again and again
[1:26:29] then if you're not careful the devil
[1:26:31] will come to you
[1:26:33] and he'll begin to tell you maybe you're
[1:26:36] not a child of god
[1:26:41] maybe this ain't for you
[1:26:44] do you realize that's how he's captured
[1:26:47] many that have left the message
[1:26:55] they found a desire on the inside of
[1:26:57] them
[1:26:59] that that just seemed to grow stronger
[1:27:02] you know what the more you yield
[1:27:03] yourself to the devil's thoughts
[1:27:06] his voice does become magnified
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:13] but this is somebody who satan's voice
[1:27:16] became magnified in them
[1:27:18] but because they were a true child of
[1:27:21] god
[1:27:22] amen the day of their deliverance had to
[1:27:26] come
[1:27:29] for every one of us there's true bribe
[1:27:31] members i don't care what you've been
[1:27:33] struggling with and how long you've been
[1:27:34] struggling with it
[1:27:36] just know that your time is coming
[1:27:39] amen the devil has a set date
[1:27:42] that he has to leave your life amen
[1:27:45] listen now and the grace of god listen
[1:27:48] i'm telling you saints
[1:27:49] i i ain't the only one you just find
[1:27:52] that
[1:27:53] you you just find yourself looking back
[1:27:55] sometimes and
[1:27:57] oh lord
[1:28:01] this thing don't bother me no more
[1:28:04] what doesn't happen listen the power of
[1:28:08] god justin came
[1:28:09] in amen and he's he's broke the chain of
[1:28:13] the devil
[1:28:14] all for your life listen now and you may
[1:28:16] not even have recognized it was done
[1:28:19] god got to stop you and make you realize
[1:28:22] what he's done
[1:28:23] that you might give him glory for it
[1:28:25] listen now
[1:28:26] and gain strength from that testimony
[1:28:30] to help you to overcome everything else
[1:28:32] that might be in your life
[1:28:35] that's what testimonies are for
[1:28:38] when david saw what happened to the line
[1:28:40] in a bear
[1:28:42] goliath was nothing
[1:28:46] watch this now this person had a
[1:28:48] question he says
[1:28:50] this person says i've lived i have lived
[1:28:52] many years in sin until i found the lord
[1:28:55] please brother braddam i have sinned
[1:28:57] again
[1:29:00] and i'm not worthy to come before you in
[1:29:02] this holy place
[1:29:04] please tell me if i can be restored
[1:29:06] whole again
[1:29:08] brother branham ain't had to wake up
[1:29:10] wait a second
[1:29:12] he immediately responded yes
[1:29:19] and was he just trying to make the
[1:29:20] person feel good
[1:29:22] no it isn't and not ain't that that's
[1:29:25] not what was happening watch this saints
[1:29:27] praise god he says you have not seen my
[1:29:31] friends so far in god but what you could
[1:29:33] be restored
[1:29:35] listen to this now if you had sinned so
[1:29:38] far that you could not be restored
[1:29:40] you never want to be restored
[1:29:49] sure you might have a spiritual trouble
[1:29:52] but pay attention to what's in your
[1:29:54] heart see
[1:29:55] you feel uneasy you feel unsettled you
[1:29:58] feel bad you feel convicted
[1:30:01] you don't want to remain that way even
[1:30:04] though you get knocked down some tell
[1:30:06] you to get back up again
[1:30:08] you just find yourself not not being
[1:30:10] able just to give up
[1:30:13] what is that that's the voice of god
[1:30:17] amen doing what encouraging you in your
[1:30:20] time of weakness
[1:30:21] and your time of hurting pain
[1:30:27] just by having a desire
[1:30:31] to continue to fight
[1:30:34] that's a blessing within itself the
[1:30:37] devil don't want you to see that's a
[1:30:39] major
[1:30:40] sign that you are a child of god
[1:30:43] no matter how many times you failed him
[1:30:46] he ain't counting like that he ain't
[1:30:49] keeping tabs like that
[1:30:52] he's just letting you go through your
[1:30:54] course
[1:30:56] because in the end you're gonna come out
[1:30:58] like gold
[1:31:02] after i am tried job says then shall i
[1:31:06] come forth as gold
[1:31:08] how many believe that
[1:31:13] when you can have that kind of a mindset
[1:31:15] in the midst of your trouble in the
[1:31:16] midst of your battle
[1:31:18] amen the devil can't do nothing with
[1:31:19] that saints
[1:31:23] you gotta have the mind of an overcomer
[1:31:26] when i was in the marine corps we had
[1:31:28] several battles that
[1:31:30] that that sparked up overseas over there
[1:31:32] in the middle east
[1:31:33] and i had a friend of mine that was
[1:31:35] there in platoon with me
[1:31:36] and he told me he said i had a dream i
[1:31:39] had a dream that i heard a loud
[1:31:41] explosion
[1:31:42] and all of us were standing sitting in
[1:31:43] the trench together i heard that loud
[1:31:46] explosion man i don't think we made it
[1:31:48] i was in the world but i just had some
[1:31:51] men me
[1:31:52] you weren't going to speak no negative
[1:31:54] mess over my life
[1:31:55] i said brother i don't know what your
[1:31:57] dream meant but if i go over there i'm
[1:31:59] telling you i'm coming back again
[1:32:02] amen and that's exactly the mindset
[1:32:05] change
[1:32:05] we got to have no matter how many times
[1:32:08] you've been knocked down amen
[1:32:09] no matter how many times you failed god
[1:32:12] something on the inside of you
[1:32:14] gotta let you know and i'm still an
[1:32:16] overcomer i'm still coming out of this
[1:32:18] i will not be defeated amen
[1:32:24] that's what the lord does to the hearts
[1:32:26] of his believers
[1:32:28] he gives us strength
[1:32:33] the bible said he sent his word and he
[1:32:35] healed them
[1:32:41] you've not seen my friends so far in god
[1:32:43] this is what you couldn't be restored if
[1:32:45] you had sin
[1:32:46] so far that you couldn't be restored you
[1:32:48] never want to be restored see
[1:32:50] but as long as there is something
[1:32:52] dealing with your heart you're still
[1:32:54] in line of restoration guilty of the
[1:32:57] lease is guilty of the whole
[1:32:58] i have sinned many times a prophet
[1:33:00] saying himself
[1:33:02] i have sinned many times every day every
[1:33:04] one of us do things we're not
[1:33:06] we don't want to do he says it's in your
[1:33:08] heart our heart
[1:33:09] you don't want to be that way or you
[1:33:11] wouldn't ask the question
[1:33:15] that's he says that's itself or proof
[1:33:17] that god still is dealing with you
[1:33:19] you've probably gotten nervous probably
[1:33:22] satan telling you
[1:33:23] that you can't be restored he says he's
[1:33:26] lying to you
[1:33:30] but the person wasn't able to recognize
[1:33:32] the voice of the devil
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:38] when you hadn't been trained when when
[1:33:40] you when you when your heart when you
[1:33:42] hadn't been trained to that voice
[1:33:44] and you don't you don't really like
[1:33:46] samuel
[1:33:48] you don't realize that it's god
[1:33:52] he says because look if there he's a
[1:33:54] because if there is a deep
[1:33:56] calling there's got to be a deep to
[1:33:58] respond to the call
[1:34:00] if there's a hunger for something that
[1:34:02] something's got to be somewhere or you
[1:34:04] wouldn't he's you wouldn't have no
[1:34:06] hunger for
[1:34:07] it so if we're desiring to be just like
[1:34:11] christ
[1:34:14] then there is a supply for me and for
[1:34:17] you
[1:34:18] isn't that right to satisfy that desire
[1:34:22] god is here amen and he's that supply to
[1:34:26] issue to you to your soul exactly what
[1:34:28] you're standing in need of
[1:34:30] to quench that hunger in that thirst

[1:39:07] see that strength is made perfect in
[1:39:11] weakness
[1:39:12] amen take your bible
[1:39:15] in job chapter 33
[1:39:20] that's a masterpiece
[1:39:23] young people if you have a struggle
[1:39:27] how god speaks this is your answer
[1:39:32] somebody asked me that question recently
[1:39:35] and the lord brought a whole message
[1:39:38] unfolding all these things to us
[1:39:42] amen the voice that ela was hearing in
[1:39:46] the temple
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:50] the voice that samuel was hearing in the
[1:39:52] temple
[1:39:55] do you think that it was by mistake that
[1:39:58] god called
[1:39:58] and he was going to samuel
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:06] so when god is calling he went to samuel
[1:40:09] when god is calling he went to samuel
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:14] he went to ilah actually god is calling
[1:40:17] he went to elah god is calling
[1:40:19] he goes to ila another word of
[1:40:23] torn god used
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:30] was the tone of the priest
[1:40:33] that was there for that time
[1:40:38] amen that's why when you listen to the
[1:40:41] message
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] we call it the voice of god amen
[1:40:48] that's why brother branham said you are
[1:40:50] not feeding
[1:40:51] on the words of men but you are feeding
[1:40:55] upon the unfailing
[1:40:56] body word of the son of man
[1:41:01] you might think it's the voice of
[1:41:02] brother branham yes the tone is brother
[1:41:05] branham
[1:41:06] but the content of that tone is god
[1:41:09] speaking to this generation through a
[1:41:12] vessel
[1:41:13] amen job chapter
[1:41:16] 33 verse 14 hallelujah
[1:41:20] what a masterpiece
[1:41:25] that's why you can hear the message you
[1:41:27] can hear the message you can hear the
[1:41:28] message but one of this day
[1:41:30] like we heard the testimony last sunday
[1:41:33] you're going to come
[1:41:34] into a personal revelation with the god
[1:41:37] of the message
[1:41:39] and that's it then you're going to say
[1:41:42] speak lord
[1:41:43] that servant here is that
[1:41:46] job chapter 33 verse 14. are you there
[1:41:50] if you're there you can say amen the
[1:41:52] bible say god
[1:41:53] speak once yey twice
[1:41:57] yet man perceive it
[1:42:01] in other words it means for god speaks
[1:42:04] again and again though people
[1:42:08] do not recognize it
[1:42:11] amen sometimes we are waiting for that
[1:42:14] audible voice
[1:42:15] where god is putting an impression in
[1:42:18] your heart
[1:42:19] to go ahead and do something sometimes
[1:42:21] you're waiting for that to come a
[1:42:23] different way
[1:42:24] and then you can talk to somebody and
[1:42:26] they say something and
[1:42:28] it triggers you just like that the
[1:42:31] brother opened the scripture and was
[1:42:32] reading
[1:42:33] john 8 and i was sitting there and i
[1:42:36] seen something in marriage and divorce

[1:42:43] divorce he didn't know i'm i have been
[1:42:45] studying marriage and divorce left and
[1:42:47] right how did he know that
[1:42:50] just be sensitive feed the white
[1:42:53] dog and you're going to be more
[1:42:56] sensitive to recognize the voice of god
[1:43:00] and to eliminate the other voices amen
[1:43:04] brother mike brad said he was not a
[1:43:06] sinner that called him
[1:43:08] sometimes he can anoint a brother just
[1:43:11] like brother peter was anointed
[1:43:13] and if you don't recognize somebody can
[1:43:15] take you and pull you down
[1:43:17] and you just woke up in the morning so
[1:43:19] happy and trying to praise the lord

[1:43:30] phone

[1:44:13] because god wanted to bless him amen
[1:44:17] when jesus was talking about those that
[1:44:19] were invited
[1:44:21] there were reason and reason and reason
[1:44:24] and if you chase
[1:44:25] the scripture you're going to find out
[1:44:26] that all those reasons were legitimate
[1:44:29] reason
[1:44:30] that jesus turn around and say let the
[1:44:32] dead bury the dead

[1:47:24] that could create the male and create
[1:47:27] the old
[1:47:28] the voice of elijah has been given to

[1:47:31] we have the message of the hour we have
[1:47:34] the devil's answer
[1:47:35] we know what to do let it drop in your
[1:47:39] heart
[1:47:40] give god preeminence give god

[1:47:44] be sensitive to his voice and the lord
[1:47:46] will bless you heavenly father
[1:47:49] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:47:51] father for your love and for your mercy
[1:47:54] lord if it was not for your grace many
[1:47:57] species could have been stay
[1:47:59] empty and we could be in a lot of
[1:48:02] trouble
[1:48:03] but further even when we feel like we
[1:48:05] are corner left and right
[1:48:07] and there is no outlet lord father you
[1:48:10] always
[1:48:11] provide an emergency bullet of grace
[1:48:14] that will free your predestinated seed
[1:48:17] and lord
[1:48:18] father leaders home father made this
[1:48:20] message

[1:48:25] the people but may he suck deep lord
[1:48:27] and may the holy spirit continue to
[1:48:29] minister to your children

[1:48:33] lord father may you speak to them
[1:48:35] deeply give them a revelation again lord

[1:48:42] to always recognize which voice is
[1:48:44] coming
[1:48:45] which thought are we receiving which
[1:48:47] conversation are we engaging to
[1:48:49] father so that we can make a difference
[1:48:52] between lord the work of the devil
[1:48:54] and the voice of god because your
[1:48:56] prophet told us that to overcome
[1:48:58] is to recognize the devil in his tactics
[1:49:01] lord
[1:49:02] father if in the presence of your
[1:49:04] anointing
[1:49:05] father the devil could sit there trying

[1:49:13] father that you have given in this end
[1:49:15] time lord give us grace to endure
[1:49:17] no matter what's going on no matter our
[1:49:20] failure
[1:49:20] no matter the difficulties no matter the
[1:49:23] symptom lord but may we realize lord
[1:49:26] that we are not looking on doors lying
[1:49:28] vanity
[1:49:29] but we are looking lord father at the
[1:49:31] promise of god
[1:49:32] because the one who gives the promise he
[1:49:35] doesn't lie
[1:49:36] he's not even a man to repent lord
[1:49:38] father help each one of us
[1:49:40] in our our individual life lord as we
[1:49:43] commit it all
[1:49:44] and to the hand lord in the name of
[1:49:46] jesus christ
[1:49:48] in the name of jesus christ amen brother
[1:49:51] you can lead us in one song and you
[1:49:53] dismiss god bless you church to remember
[1:49:55] the service
[1:49:56] and continue to consecrate and to pray
[1:49:59] let god have a personal relationship
[1:50:01] between you and him you and him alone
[1:50:04] when he speak
[1:50:06] you will recognize his voice amen

[1:50:34] powerful
[1:50:36] just like the preacher was saying when
[1:50:38] samuel thought it was eli speaking to
[1:50:40] him but it was god
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:43] you know i'm so grateful for a voice in
[1:50:45] this age that god spoke through
[1:50:47] and we can look at it and say my god not
[1:50:49] to bring glory to the man
[1:50:51] but we just know it was god speaking
[1:50:53] through the man
[1:50:53] [Music]
