[35:55] but we did stream and uh I know the

[36:00] doers not only Heroes only is that right
[36:03] so anyway I hugged my sister goodbye
[36:06] give her a kiss goodbye and heading up
[36:08] the road and I come to a traffic light
[36:10] and my truck just completely stopped it
[36:13] wouldn't move engines running
[36:14] everything's working perfectly truck
[36:16] just won't move
[36:18] so I realized that there's no air
[36:20] in the tanks which released the brakes
[36:23] so
[36:24] it's in there I looked around the truck
[36:26] listening for elite see what's the

[54:31] because if we were here by ourselves we
[54:33] have gathered in vain but if he is here
[54:36] then all things are possible amen it
[54:38] meant to think that God would send us a
[54:40] prophet in this generation that would
[54:42] declare one thing to us he is here amen
[54:47] he says my Ministry is different from
[54:49] the pastor different from the Evangelist
[54:51] he said my Ministry is to declare him
[54:53] that he is here and I I was just hearing
[54:56] a quote today the prophet of God said
[54:58] we've gone beyond all these uh things of
[55:00] trying to speak in tongues and trying to
[55:02] shout and trying to dance he said we
[55:04] believe in those things but we've come
[55:05] to the hour where the word and the word
[55:07] alone amen the word itself divine
[55:10] presence and I I'm thankful to know
[55:12] tonight that we are in the presence amen
[55:14] of the word amen we want to say God
[55:17] bless you all this evening and we sure
[55:19] appreciate mother Stephen we appreciate
[55:20] the opportunity and the invitation to be
[55:22] here and he had asked us some time ago
[55:24] about coming and I wasn't able to come
[55:26] then and the other day you text us out
[55:28] of the clear blue and I realized I never
[55:30] got back with him and it was my fault
[55:32] and so we thank the Lord that he allowed
[55:34] it to work out out we could be here this
[55:36] evening with you and I sure sure
[55:38] appreciate brother Stephen and this
[55:39] church and the stand that you've taken
[55:42] for this message amen and we just pray
[55:44] the Lord bless you richly we bring
[55:45] greetings tonight from our pastor
[55:47] brother Sean Martin all the saints there
[55:49] Faith Tabernacle in Virginia I send the
[55:52] greetings to you and we've just come out
[55:53] of our annual camp meeting there and we
[55:56] saw some of you all there with us and we
[55:57] sure appreciated those that were able to
[55:59] come and we were encouraged by you
[56:01] coming and fellowshipping with us and we
[56:03] sure thank you for that and we also want
[56:06] to say real good to have our in-laws

[56:09] last time I was here everybody was

[56:13] time amen we're sure thankful to have
[56:16] them here with us and for sure sure love
[56:18] and appreciate our family my wife made
[56:20] the trip down with us and be traveling
[56:22] back tonight so we we sure appreciate
[56:24] her for coming and let's just buy our
[56:26] hearts together here for a word of
[56:28] prayer and let's just invite him to come
[56:31] tonight and speak to his Heavenly Father
[56:33] Lord as your Believers have together
[56:35] here this afternoon
[56:37] Lord we come for one Purpose with one
[56:39] motive and one objective and Lord that
[56:41] is to lift up the name that is above
[56:43] every name that at the name of Jesus
[56:45] every knee should bow every tongue
[56:47] should confess Lord father at that name
[56:50] ever Spirit has to come subject Lord to
[56:52] the Holy Spirit if that name Lord
[56:54] sicknesses leave bodies Lord
[56:57] destructions and and strongholds have to
[57:00] leave the minds of your children at the
[57:02] name of Jesus so Lord we've come here
[57:04] tonight to do one thing and that is Lord
[57:07] just to speak the name of Jesus father I
[57:10] pray that as your word Goes Forth as we
[57:12] fill the angels of God in this building
[57:14] Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung
[57:17] to create an atmosphere that would be
[57:19] conducive for your spirit to come and to
[57:21] position your word into the hearts of
[57:23] your children now Lord I Surrender
[57:25] myself as Speaker Lord may they
[57:27] surrender his hearers father and Lord
[57:29] may you speak through me may you hear
[57:31] through the Believers Lord may it be
[57:33] another
[57:34] emmausical God may it not be as brother
[57:36] Andrew spoke to us along the way but
[57:39] father may it be as you come and talk to
[57:41] us along the way Lord we invite you come
[57:43] in the little room tonight oh God take
[57:45] the bread and break it that the
[57:47] children's house would come open and see
[57:49] that you're still the same yesterday
[57:50] today and forever and whatever is
[57:53] accomplished here tonight we'll be sure
[57:55] to give thee all the praise all the
[57:57] honor and all the glory for it to do thy
[57:59] Wonderful Name the name of our Lord
[58:01] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[58:03] Believers says
[58:05] amen and amen the book of Ephesians the
[58:08] second chapter we want to look here in
[58:10] Ephesians the second chapter and we just
[58:12] have something here on our heart tonight
[58:14] to share with you a bit of a study I've
[58:17] been studying through and preaching a
[58:18] little bit on so I trust it'd be okay to
[58:20] bring a few things from it to you
[58:22] tonight in the book of Ephesians the
[58:24] second chapter
[58:25] we want to look in the fourth verse
[58:28] Ephesians 2
[58:30] and verse 4
[58:32] Paul here writing says but God who is
[58:36] rich in Mercy
[58:37] for his great love we're with he loved
[58:40] us that even when we were dead in sins
[58:43] hath quickened us together with Christ
[58:47] by Grace ye are saved now watch this
[58:51] sixth verse and hath raised us up
[58:53] together
[58:54] amen hath not not left us where we were
[58:57] but has raised us up together and has
[59:00] made us to sit together in Heavenly
[59:03] places in Christ Jesus that in the ages
[59:06] to come he might show the exceeding
[59:08] Riches of his grace and his kindness
[59:11] toward us through Christ Jesus so Paul
[59:14] was not just speaking to the Ephesians
[59:16] but he was actually showing in the ages
[59:18] to come that he would actually be
[59:20] showing the same benefits to the church
[59:22] that he was showing to the Ephesians now
[59:25] in the book of Colossians the third
[59:26] chapter I want to pull a couple verses
[59:29] from Colossians 3 and verse 1 again Paul
[59:32] writing and he's speaking of a holy
[59:35] ambition a holy affection and I believe
[59:37] that's what we want tonight is a holy
[59:40] ambition and a holy affection in the
[59:43] first verse Paul says if you then be
[59:45] risen with Christ then seek those things
[59:48] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[59:51] the right hand of God and set your
[59:53] affection on things above and not on
[59:56] things on the earth so Paul's changing
[59:58] your attention from the things of the
[1:00:00] Earth to the things of Heaven for ye are
[1:00:03] dead and you are in your life is hid
[1:00:06] with Christ in God and when Christ who
[1:00:08] is our life shall appear then we shall
[1:00:11] also appear with him in glory amen we
[1:00:15] ask the Lord this evening to add the
[1:00:16] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:00:18] you can be seated here this afternoon I
[1:00:20] want to for just a few moments to speak
[1:00:22] to you tonight and if I title this
[1:00:24] sermon I want to speak to you on two
[1:00:26] words Heavenly set Heavenly set s-e-t
[1:00:30] Heavenly said I I believe that this
[1:00:33] women is not the hour to be drifting but
[1:00:36] I believe this is the hour to be set I
[1:00:38] don't believe this is the hour to be
[1:00:40] aimlessly wandering through life but I
[1:00:42] believe this is the hour to have a focus
[1:00:43] to have a have a vision to have a goal
[1:00:46] to have a direction amen I believe this
[1:00:48] is the hour to set our Spirits now the
[1:00:51] problem of God presuming 1962 he said I
[1:00:54] put my choice with the Full Gospel many
[1:00:56] years ago and I'm happier every day
[1:00:58] about it I'm thankful to be one of them
[1:01:01] how many can say you're thankful to be
[1:01:03] one of them and having this Grand
[1:01:05] experience of receiving Christ is my
[1:01:08] savior and then returns having him to
[1:01:10] fill me with this Holy Spirit and living
[1:01:12] in my heart daily as a witness to me
[1:01:14] that I have passed from deafen to life
[1:01:16] testing my plant of my salvation each
[1:01:19] day as I take inventory see just the way
[1:01:22] the spirit in me what does it feel like
[1:01:24] how does it cooperate with the things of
[1:01:27] the world or is it so Heavenly Sent till
[1:01:30] the world seems dull and dingy and dirty
[1:01:33] amen is our spirit so Heavenly Sent Amen
[1:01:37] to the things of the world sing dull
[1:01:39] they seem dingy and they seem dirty
[1:01:41] again in the junction of time brother
[1:01:43] I'm speaking of Noah he said he was not
[1:01:45] only performing a miracle but he was
[1:01:47] also looking for a miracle and the
[1:01:49] church today is it's a labored away into
[1:01:51] the task of preaching the gospel with
[1:01:54] signs and wonders of following they are
[1:01:56] preparing for a miracle that Miracle is
[1:01:59] the rapture of the church and the going
[1:02:01] home amen the miracle the church is
[1:02:04] preparing for is the rapture and the
[1:02:06] going home it is preparing people
[1:02:09] getting them light and burden from the
[1:02:11] things of the world and getting their
[1:02:13] soul set in the presence of God that
[1:02:16] when Jesus does appear and then the
[1:02:18] second time in glory those who are ready
[1:02:21] will Rapture and be caught up together
[1:02:23] to meet him in the air and be with him
[1:02:25] amen we got to get our spirit sent amen
[1:02:28] we've got to get our soul saved amen can
[1:02:31] I give you some prophetic instructions
[1:02:33] from a prophet prophet he said it
[1:02:34] behooves us to watch and to be careful
[1:02:37] Amen to be set in the word amen this is
[1:02:40] the hour to be sent in the word amen
[1:02:43] many things are taking place today which
[1:02:45] are unscriptural amen let's watch the
[1:02:47] scripture and let's be sure that we are
[1:02:50] right again he said don't be tossed
[1:02:52] about with every wind of Doctrine amen
[1:02:54] you believe God's word you get stable
[1:02:56] and you get set and then listen there's
[1:02:59] many things happening today amen but
[1:03:01] this is not the hour to be following
[1:03:03] every new idea that comes along this is
[1:03:06] not the hour to be fallen every new move
[1:03:08] that comes along amen but God who is
[1:03:11] rich in Mercy has sent a message in this
[1:03:13] generation and I propose to you that
[1:03:16] this message is not a feeling it is not
[1:03:19] a sensation it is not a Doctrine it is
[1:03:21] not a religion amen but it is the
[1:03:24] presence of the resurrected Christ
[1:03:25] they've been returning into the church
[1:03:27] with power and with authoritative amen
[1:03:30] it behooves us tonight's hers to look
[1:03:32] away to Jesus it behooves us tonight
[1:03:35] amen to turn our attention from the
[1:03:37] things that's going on around us amen
[1:03:39] and set our Focus towards heaven amen
[1:03:42] don't be tossed about amen don't move
[1:03:44] one day and end the next but get stable
[1:03:47] amen get set amen because the Rapture is
[1:03:50] upon the church amen when I think of
[1:03:53] this word Heavenly Webster says it is
[1:03:55] relating to Heaven or the heavens amen
[1:03:58] it means divine it is meaning the
[1:04:01] suggesting the Blessed state of heaven
[1:04:03] so in other words the Bible said that
[1:04:06] Jesus give us the model prayer when he
[1:04:08] said you pray this way father let thy
[1:04:11] kingdom come and let thy will be done on
[1:04:14] the Earth as it is in heaven amen when
[1:04:17] Jesus prayed bad amen you were not
[1:04:19] already on the other side amen but you
[1:04:22] were still on this Earthly side amen but
[1:04:25] he was saying amen that the will of
[1:04:27] heaven will come into the Earth and
[1:04:30] before the people get to heaven they
[1:04:32] will be manifest thing the attribute of
[1:04:34] Heaven amen listen without this message
[1:04:37] we're another Baptist Church Without
[1:04:39] this message we're another charismatic
[1:04:42] Catherine amen but if this is the
[1:04:44] message of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10
[1:04:47] and Luke 17 and I believe it is amen
[1:04:50] that we have received a Heavenly message
[1:04:52] upon an Earthly people amen and this
[1:04:55] message is changing us whether it's
[1:04:57] doing more than just changing the way we
[1:04:59] dress it's doing more than just changing
[1:05:02] the way we sing amen but it has changed
[1:05:04] our Focus amen from the things of the
[1:05:06] earth and to the things of Heaven they
[1:05:09] said I'm not looking at the government
[1:05:10] I'm not looking at the White House I'm
[1:05:13] looking at the right hand of God where
[1:05:15] there is a victorious conqueror who sits
[1:05:17] on the seat
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] he's not sitting there nervous he's not
[1:05:22] sitting there confused he is sitting
[1:05:24] there as a mighty God he is sitting
[1:05:27] there as the Everlasting father and
[1:05:29] there is a people on the Earth who is
[1:05:32] manifesting heaven right now
[1:05:36] well glory to God I tell you what I am
[1:05:38] one that believes we don't have to die
[1:05:40] and go to heaven to enjoy heaven
[1:05:44] I am one that's not waiting to get to
[1:05:46] heaven before I enjoy Heaven amen but
[1:05:49] this message has put me in position on a
[1:05:53] Wednesday night in the house of God Amen
[1:05:56] to enjoy their benefits
[1:05:59] this is not an Earthly message this is
[1:06:03] not a churchy message this is a Heavenly
[1:06:05] message with a Heavenly influence and
[1:06:08] the prophet of God said when a heavily
[1:06:10] influence comes in the church he said it
[1:06:12] paralyzes every demon but you know what
[1:06:15] every demon against you tonight amen is
[1:06:17] paralyzed in the atmosphere of the
[1:06:20] message of the hour because this message
[1:06:22] is not a feeling it's a versa the lord
[1:06:25] it's a scriptural message it's a
[1:06:28] Vindicated message it's a message of
[1:06:30] authority it's a message of Direction
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:34] it's a message from heaven
[1:06:37] amen it's a message from Heaven the
[1:06:39] prophet of God one of his final sermons
[1:06:41] he preaches is things that are to be
[1:06:44] beautiful message go listen to it things
[1:06:46] are to be he said I do not think that
[1:06:49] heaven is a place my mother used to tell
[1:06:51] me about he said I believe the church
[1:06:54] has grown from that he said the
[1:06:56] old-timers used to say you go to heaven
[1:06:58] sit on a cloud and play a harp he said
[1:07:01] but it isn't playing Harps at all he
[1:07:03] said I don't believe the Bible teaches
[1:07:05] that amen that was the conception they
[1:07:08] had amen before the fullness of the word
[1:07:11] he said come into existence amen or the
[1:07:14] opening of The Seven seal that promised
[1:07:16] to us in this age amen that we would
[1:07:19] understand among church amen I feel like
[1:07:22] preaching amen this message amen is the
[1:07:25] only message that has accurately ain't
[1:07:27] been described what heaven is my bones
[1:07:30] hurt
[1:07:32] I know there's a lot of books I know
[1:07:34] there's a lot of teachers that teach
[1:07:35] what heaven is amen but the problem with
[1:07:38] those things is brother Stephen the
[1:07:39] things they say they saw there it's not
[1:07:42] what the Bible says will be there
[1:07:44] like like a like a man said one time he
[1:07:47] said I died and went to heaven and he
[1:07:49] saw he said I saw my 80 year old mother
[1:07:51] sitting on the porch I thought 80 year
[1:07:53] old mother amen when we get over there
[1:07:55] old age will be done away with amen but
[1:07:58] God who is rich in Mercy was not
[1:08:00] allowing you to walk to this earth he'd
[1:08:03] been confused about your destination so
[1:08:05] he let a prophet go beyond the curtain
[1:08:07] of time amen and catch a glimpse of the
[1:08:10] things that are to me listen amen we are
[1:08:12] not a helpless hopeless confused amen
[1:08:14] but your church members we are the Bride
[1:08:16] of Jesus Christ and we have been
[1:08:18] notified by the message of The Hour That
[1:08:21] Heaven is a real place
[1:08:24] I say thank God for the message amen
[1:08:27] that changed our conception of what
[1:08:30] heaven is for what it really is
[1:08:32] yeah it's a real place amen it's a real
[1:08:35] place see for God started Us in her
[1:08:39] spiritual growth in this place now watch
[1:08:41] this God started us in our spiritual
[1:08:44] growth in this place he said but watch
[1:08:47] believe that heaven is a real place we
[1:08:50] don't set up fair for eternity and just
[1:08:52] sit there on a cloud so Heaven is a real
[1:08:55] place
[1:08:56] and this message has accurately
[1:08:59] described to you the place you're going
[1:09:01] than what this message has done is it's
[1:09:04] a Divine message it's a Heavenly message
[1:09:07] that has set our focus on our
[1:09:10] destination
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:12] that's why you can't stop us amen that's
[1:09:15] why the devil can't discourage us and
[1:09:18] then that's why troubles and situations
[1:09:19] amen cannot back us off of the promises
[1:09:23] of God because our conception of our
[1:09:26] future has been changed by the verse of
[1:09:29] the seventh angel and that we are not
[1:09:31] hopelessly aimlessly walking through
[1:09:33] life we can see where we come from we
[1:09:35] can see where we're at we can see where
[1:09:37] we're going oh I wish I had the voice of
[1:09:40] a Thousand Angels I would climb upon the
[1:09:42] tallest mountain and scream thank God
[1:09:45] for the message of the hour Amen to open
[1:09:47] our eyes
[1:09:52] Hallelujah I think it's time to remember
[1:09:54] God sent a message he didn't send a
[1:09:57] personality he didn't send a bunch of
[1:09:59] famous preachers he sent a message and
[1:10:01] if you want to escape the destruction
[1:10:03] that is coming upon the Earth you better
[1:10:05] get in the message brother
[1:10:08] all right
[1:10:11] I know what I'm talking about amen
[1:10:13] personalities come and personality goes
[1:10:16] preachers come and preachers go we've
[1:10:19] seen all kinds of moves in this message
[1:10:20] amen but I'll tell you one thing the
[1:10:22] message of the hour Still Remains
[1:10:25] [Applause]
[1:10:30] the message of the hour Still Remains
[1:10:32] pure
[1:10:33] Still Remains undiluted
[1:10:35] now I'm just gonna go ahead and preach
[1:10:37] since I'm here don't you reduce this
[1:10:39] message down to just some feeling or
[1:10:42] some gift or some sensation this message
[1:10:45] is the power to overcome two hundred
[1:10:49] thousand thousand Devils this message
[1:10:51] amen is the ability to equip a pride
[1:10:54] when the incremental counsel is present
[1:10:56] and the World Council churches are
[1:10:58] gathering we have seen the uniting time
[1:11:01] we have seen the uniting sign our eyes
[1:11:04] have been turned
[1:11:07] you say preacher you're a little
[1:11:09] different I say I am because of the
[1:11:11] message
[1:11:17] change my conception it changed the way
[1:11:20] I conduct myself I no longer conduct
[1:11:23] myself as a helpless hopeless church
[1:11:25] member I now conduct myself as a messiah
[1:11:33] and if you ever get in the message it'll
[1:11:35] change the way you conduct yourself
[1:11:38] well glory to God it feels good in here
[1:11:40] don't it and then if you ever get the
[1:11:42] message it'll change the way you conduct
[1:11:45] yourself it'll change the way you talk
[1:11:47] about people it'll change the way you
[1:11:49] come to church it'll change the way you
[1:11:51] say Amen listen there's nothing else on
[1:11:54] the earth to change us but the message
[1:11:56] of the hour
[1:12:00] it's a Heavenly message
[1:12:03] and those that are following this
[1:12:04] heavenly message they have become
[1:12:07] Heavenly Sent
[1:12:09] they have become Heavenly Sent they say
[1:12:13] they become heavily set with everything
[1:12:14] within me I declare we are set towards
[1:12:19] heaven
[1:12:20] now that little word said it's it's a
[1:12:24] little word but it packs a powerful
[1:12:25] definition it means to put layers stand
[1:12:28] something in a specified place or
[1:12:31] position it means to be situated or
[1:12:33] fixed in a specified place or position
[1:12:35] it means to put a seed or plant in the
[1:12:38] ground to grow it means to put a sail up
[1:12:41] in position to catch the wind it means
[1:12:44] to call someone or something to start
[1:12:47] doing something it means to instruct
[1:12:49] someone to do something it means to give
[1:12:51] someone a task it means of a blossom or
[1:12:54] a tree it means to develop into or
[1:12:57] produce fruit
[1:12:59] so when you receive this heavenly
[1:13:02] message it will literally situate you
[1:13:04] and will fix you in a position they
[1:13:07] meant to catch a wind From Another
[1:13:09] Dimension to raise up above the
[1:13:12] dimension that you're in right now
[1:13:14] now I know where I'm at I'm in the
[1:13:16] adoption series part one brother
[1:13:18] remember says that brother man stops and
[1:13:20] reads Ephesians 1 3 and says spiritual
[1:13:23] blessings in Heavenly places he said now
[1:13:26] this brother Stephen I love it he said
[1:13:28] we are heavenlies in our soul
[1:13:32] among church we are heavenlies in our
[1:13:35] soul amen now watch your three you're a
[1:13:38] Triune being you're a body a spirit and
[1:13:41] a soul but he never said that you were
[1:13:43] Heavenly in your spirit he never said
[1:13:45] you were heavily in your flesh but he
[1:13:48] said you were Heavenly in your soul
[1:13:51] come on church and amen can I preach to
[1:13:54] you amen you've got five inner senses
[1:13:57] and you got five outer senses the five
[1:14:00] inner senses are two outer senses rather
[1:14:02] are to your flesh the five innocences
[1:14:05] are to your spirit but there was only
[1:14:07] one sense that can get to your soul and
[1:14:10] it's not seed taste feel smelling here
[1:14:13] it's not reason and affection memory
[1:14:15] imagination and conscience it is Faith
[1:14:18] amen that the only thing that can get to
[1:14:21] the real you is the faith of God in the
[1:14:24] generation that you're living in
[1:14:27] that's why we're still here amen cause
[1:14:29] the devil done everything he could to
[1:14:31] take us out by the flesh he'd done
[1:14:33] everything he could to take us out by
[1:14:36] the spirit but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:14:38] for the seeking inside your soul and
[1:14:42] research you Esther for a Time such as
[1:14:45] this
[1:14:48] that's why there ain't nothing can move
[1:14:49] you but this message
[1:14:53] that's why there ain't nothing can
[1:14:55] change you but this message because it's
[1:14:57] the only thing that God allowed to
[1:15:00] access your soul
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:05] yeah
[1:15:07] feelings has nothing to do with it
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] imagination reasoning has nothing to do
[1:15:14] with it
[1:15:15] I'm on Church
[1:15:18] I'll tell you what a prophet said he
[1:15:20] said in the message called the hour has
[1:15:21] come it's a little quote but it's a
[1:15:23] powerful one he said the hour has come
[1:15:26] to separate your feelings from your
[1:15:27] faith
[1:15:29] he said the hour has come to separate
[1:15:33] your feelings from your faith what do
[1:15:35] you saying preacher I'm saying feelings
[1:15:37] is one thing and faith is another and
[1:15:40] Malachi 4 did not come to restore our
[1:15:44] feelings and come to restore faith we
[1:15:47] will not take a Rapture by the way we
[1:15:49] feel we will not overcome not the way we
[1:15:53] feel but we'll overcome by the word that
[1:15:56] we believe and the word we believe is
[1:15:58] sharper and more powerful than any
[1:16:00] two-edged sword
[1:16:04] oh yeah we're not a bunch of Earthbound
[1:16:06] chicken eyes chickens
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:10] brother Brandon emphatically teaches the
[1:16:13] church that the believer's position in
[1:16:16] Christ is Heavenly places
[1:16:20] if you're not in the heavenlies tonight
[1:16:22] and your name is on the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:24] Life you're out of your position
[1:16:28] now what are you say it I'm saying that
[1:16:30] this is an adoption message
[1:16:33] this is an adoption message don't don't
[1:16:36] you reduce this message down to
[1:16:37] Pentecostal little feeling somewhere
[1:16:40] this is a positionally placing message
[1:16:44] now ah
[1:16:46] I tell you what I feel the strength of
[1:16:48] the message in this church
[1:16:50] your adoption is not your birth
[1:16:54] you was a son at Birth you were
[1:16:57] predestinated unto adoption brother said
[1:17:00] for the sons of the last day yes my
[1:17:03] brother you were predestinated for
[1:17:05] adoption for the sons of the last days
[1:17:07] now that might hurt Pentecostal he said
[1:17:10] I got born again praise the God I got
[1:17:12] the Holy Ghost Pine you're a child of
[1:17:14] God but that ain't what I'm talking
[1:17:15] about see adoption is placing a son yes
[1:17:19] sir so I could easily say heavenly
[1:17:21] adoption Heavenly say it Heavenly Place
[1:17:25] Heavenly situated Heavenly fixed amen
[1:17:29] what are you saying I'm saying the bride
[1:17:31] by an adoption message has been
[1:17:33] positionally placed in the heavenlies
[1:17:36] look at somebody next to you say
[1:17:38] heavenly
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:45] they say can you prove that well the
[1:17:47] prophet said in the countdown he said
[1:17:49] the position of the church that should
[1:17:52] be plum in the heavenlies not down here
[1:17:54] floating through the clouds buzzing
[1:17:56] around like an airplane but it's
[1:17:58] something that's propelled by something
[1:17:59] that sends it beyond anything that an
[1:18:02] airplane could think of it's an
[1:18:04] astronaut oh now we've just found out
[1:18:07] where we're set amen it's an astronaut
[1:18:09] age where spiritual astronauts
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:13] we are now living in a spiritual
[1:18:16] astronaut age amen now come on church
[1:18:19] when brother Adam said the position of
[1:18:21] the church is plumbed in the heavenlies
[1:18:23] he did not say we visit the heavenlies
[1:18:25] he said live in the heavenlies
[1:18:30] now come on cause y'all know we're still
[1:18:32] humans but according to a prophet
[1:18:34] there's a people on the Earth who has
[1:18:36] been propelled beyond anything that the
[1:18:39] Earth has ever seen and whatever they
[1:18:42] have received amen has put them in
[1:18:44] position to live in the heavenlies
[1:18:47] regardless of what's going on in the
[1:18:49] Earthly
[1:18:51] oh I feel like shouting on that one amen
[1:18:54] amen you know what they say about us
[1:18:56] they say we're two we're too heavily
[1:18:58] minded to be any Earthly good and you
[1:19:00] know what I know there's an element of
[1:19:01] Truth to that amen but I say thank God
[1:19:04] there's a people from the face of the
[1:19:06] earth that is so Heavenly minded that
[1:19:09] the things of the Earth can no longer
[1:19:11] influence the decisions they make
[1:19:15] amen if you're Earthly minded then
[1:19:17] you're still wearing high-heeled shoes
[1:19:19] and you're still painting your face and
[1:19:21] boys are still wearing shorts and we're
[1:19:24] still going to picture shows and we
[1:19:26] still got televisions in our home
[1:19:28] come on church if you're Earthly minded
[1:19:31] amen we're still wearing clothes that
[1:19:34] you look like he was poured into
[1:19:36] foreign
[1:19:37] but if we are heavily minded then
[1:19:40] Hollywood fashion has lost its influence
[1:19:43] over the way we dress if we're Heavenly
[1:19:45] minded then denomination has lost its
[1:19:48] influence over the way we conduct our
[1:19:50] services
[1:19:53] oh I know what I'm talking about amen I
[1:19:57] I'm not ignorant worldliness is creeping
[1:19:59] right in the churches
[1:20:01] I know and it's got to work now it comes
[1:20:04] in and dares you to say anything about
[1:20:06] it well guess what you got for wrong
[1:20:08] preacher here tonight
[1:20:10] you didn't hire me so you can't fire me
[1:20:13] I got the guts to say what a prophet
[1:20:15] said he said wash the makeup off
[1:20:19] he said clean out the high-heeled shoes
[1:20:22] clean out the clothes bring Holiness
[1:20:25] back in the church and apply the token
[1:20:28] the death Angels passing through
[1:20:31] yes my brother
[1:20:34] yeah hell brother Andrew it don't matter
[1:20:37] you know why it don't matter because
[1:20:38] you've heard too Earthly minded
[1:20:40] but if you were Heavenly minded the
[1:20:43] things of Heaven would actually matter
[1:20:44] to you
[1:20:47] now y'all know I'm telling the truth
[1:20:49] it's a whirliness spirit
[1:20:52] well brother Andrew don't say nothing
[1:20:53] about it okay how long are we not going
[1:20:56] to say nothing about it until all of our
[1:20:57] boys are wearing skinny jeans
[1:21:02] well glory to God
[1:21:05] I think the message ought to change the
[1:21:07] way we conduct ourselves that's exactly
[1:21:09] right I think we ought to see a
[1:21:10] difference between a Pentecostal girl
[1:21:12] and a message girl yes sir I think we
[1:21:15] ought to be a difference between a
[1:21:16] charismatic home and a message home and
[1:21:19] the separation is the word of God and
[1:21:22] the word alone
[1:21:24] look up
[1:21:25] you gotta carry yourself away come on
[1:21:28] you got to get above these Earthbound
[1:21:30] things till you can see the things it
[1:21:32] was the things it is and the things that
[1:21:35] shall come he said see spiritual
[1:21:37] astronauts in the astronaut age they've
[1:21:40] been positionally placed in the
[1:21:42] heavenlies by the Holy Ghost itself now
[1:21:45] I feel that devil pushing at me and I
[1:21:47] will push back
[1:21:48] it's a spirit from the pits of hell that
[1:21:51] wants our
[1:21:53] I refuse to lay down the microphone and
[1:21:56] let Hollywood dress her girls I refuse
[1:21:59] to lay down this message and let Sports
[1:22:01] influence our boys I think somebody
[1:22:04] ought to get forgot to say what a
[1:22:06] prophet said
[1:22:08] it's time to clean house again Church
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:14] I know where I'm at I heard Brothers say
[1:22:16] today he said the man told me not long
[1:22:18] ago said brother Brandon you got to stay
[1:22:20] in a ditch he said stay in a ditch he
[1:22:22] said there's one ditch full of formals
[1:22:24] he said there's another ditch full of
[1:22:26] Fanatics he said my commission is to
[1:22:28] stay in the middle of the road that man
[1:22:31] said well that's a nice saying brother
[1:22:32] Branham he said but if you stay in the
[1:22:35] middle of the road you'll get run over
[1:22:36] he said oh no I won't he said it's a
[1:22:39] one-way Street
[1:22:42] he said I won't get run over it's a
[1:22:44] one-way Street listen on this street
[1:22:46] there is no coming and going there's
[1:22:49] just a going
[1:22:51] come on Church we're not turning around
[1:22:54] we're not going back that's why brother
[1:22:56] Stephen we can March in the middle of a
[1:22:59] road that's why we can stay with what a
[1:23:01] prophet's saying yes sir yes yes
[1:23:05] now now if you're going to see the
[1:23:08] spiritual astronauts in the astronaut
[1:23:09] age you've got to realize where you are
[1:23:12] and according to a prophet the
[1:23:13] Masterpiece 64 he said notice hear the
[1:23:16] life somebody say the life
[1:23:18] that was in the husk he said in the
[1:23:21] stalk in the tassel in the husk all
[1:23:23] gathers in the seed he said see the life
[1:23:25] that was in the stalk went into the
[1:23:27] other to make the other and he stops and
[1:23:29] says justification made a way for
[1:23:31] sanctification
[1:23:33] and sanctification made a way for the
[1:23:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost which made a
[1:23:39] way for the Holy Ghost itself
[1:23:42] a bone Church there's three elements to
[1:23:45] a birth there's four stages to
[1:23:47] Restoration there's water blood spirit
[1:23:49] constitutes a birth but if you're
[1:23:51] speaking of restoration amen there were
[1:23:54] four death Messengers that eat away the
[1:23:56] tree then if there were four death
[1:23:58] Messengers three life Messengers will
[1:24:02] not restore it it will take the same
[1:24:04] amount to combat the death it'll take
[1:24:07] the same amount in the Life yes my
[1:24:09] brother now people say to me well
[1:24:10] brother you've got to be careful with
[1:24:12] that fourth life you got to be careful
[1:24:14] with that fourth stage well the reason
[1:24:16] they have to be careful is they haven't
[1:24:18] seen it but the reason I don't have to
[1:24:20] be careful is because I've seen it amen
[1:24:24] I've seen it in the word yes I've seen
[1:24:27] it in the message yes I've seen it in
[1:24:29] nature I see it in the bride I'm on
[1:24:31] Church yes
[1:24:33] bridge if you dismiss the fourth light
[1:24:36] do you realize how many sermons you
[1:24:38] gotta throw away you've got to throw
[1:24:40] away the restoration of the bad tree
[1:24:41] then you've got to throw away all your
[1:24:43] countdown tapes and then you gotta throw
[1:24:45] away your restoration you got to throw
[1:24:48] away your Jehovah Jireh series you got a
[1:24:50] four-way crash just a mystery you've got
[1:24:52] to throw away the Masterpiece that's
[1:24:54] because this was the Capstone message
[1:24:58] yes my brother yes it was the ushering
[1:25:01] in of the Holy Ghost itself come on
[1:25:05] church have you forgot what a prophet
[1:25:07] said he said there were seven mountain
[1:25:09] peaks in Colorado he said and right
[1:25:11] they're spelled out on them Peaks his
[1:25:13] last name he said we have now come to
[1:25:15] the seventh Peak he said if the
[1:25:17] Continental Divide he said we can go no
[1:25:20] further the gospel must return back East
[1:25:22] again for those church amen the message
[1:25:25] of the hour amen it's not coming back in
[1:25:28] a tent in a white horse rider and some
[1:25:31] bumpity bumpity airplane but the message
[1:25:33] of the hour is in the flesh of the Bride
[1:25:35] tonight
[1:25:37] can I say it to you we're riding the
[1:25:40] trail right now
[1:25:42] we're right in the trail right now yes
[1:25:46] my brother the word has come into the
[1:25:50] bride and it's changed her conception
[1:25:53] what is it it's the Holy Ghost itself oh
[1:25:56] come on I got to preach this to you if
[1:25:58] you're spiritual astronauts then horse
[1:26:01] and buggy Faith won't work for you
[1:26:03] if you're spiritual astronauts
[1:26:05] automobile airplane faith will not work
[1:26:07] for you spiritual astronauts have to
[1:26:11] have astronaut faith
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] so we got to have it that's right and
[1:26:17] it's astronaut power do you know what
[1:26:19] the astronaut faith is you know if
[1:26:21] astronaut power is is to realize that
[1:26:24] we're in Christ already
[1:26:28] he said see just more of Christ to lift
[1:26:31] us up into Heavenly places
[1:26:34] then the Reverend said it very plainly
[1:26:36] in the spiritual food he said the faith
[1:26:38] of this hour amen is Rapture and Faith
[1:26:41] it's going to take more faith than ever
[1:26:43] was any age for this has to be a
[1:26:45] rapturing faith what is it to be taken
[1:26:48] up see in the countdown 62 it'll take
[1:26:51] astronaut Faith Amen to fly you off of
[1:26:54] this Earth to meet Jesus yes my brother
[1:26:57] now wait a second brother Stephen
[1:26:58] because I thought that the airplanes
[1:27:01] flew they did but do you realize that
[1:27:04] horse and buggy the airplane and the
[1:27:06] automobile all stayed within the bounds
[1:27:09] of Earth
[1:27:10] they never left the Earth the airplane
[1:27:14] went in the sky but it never left the
[1:27:16] Earth amen but what left the Earth the
[1:27:20] astronaut
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:22] salt horse and buggy Faith was good for
[1:27:25] horse and Biggie drivers and automobile
[1:27:27] Faith was good for car riders and
[1:27:30] airplane faith is good for Pentecostal
[1:27:31] Pilots amen but this is not a
[1:27:34] Pentecostal age this is a bad age amen
[1:27:37] this is the age where we're going to
[1:27:39] leave the Earth

[1:28:10] achievements is to manifest himself and
[1:28:13] say he that believeth in me the works
[1:28:15] that I do shall he do also what is it
[1:28:18] brother Branham it's spiritual
[1:28:20] manifestations of spiritual word

[1:34:50] revelation of the foreknowledge and
[1:34:52] predestination and adoption like he does
[1:34:55] in the book of Ephesians you know why
[1:34:57] because the Corinthians were living by
[1:34:59] sensation they were living by a tongue
[1:35:01] they were living by a Psalm amen but
[1:35:03] when Paul come on the scene he said
[1:35:06] let's go another step amen let's step up
[1:35:08] a little bit higher
[1:35:11] and what did he say he said now you were
[1:35:13] predestinated from before the foundation
[1:35:17] of the world sister that would have
[1:35:19] choked to Corinthians but it fed the
[1:35:21] Ephesians
[1:35:23] yes what would a choke the Corinthians
[1:35:26] is what fed the Ephesians and the
[1:35:29] prophet comes in 1965. in the final time
[1:35:32] he preaches Paradox and says we are
[1:35:35] promised another Ephesians then brother

[1:35:57] outside of what you're used to he said
[1:35:59] we're Earth and people we think of Miles
[1:36:01] inches feet and so forth he said but to
[1:36:04] God there's another world

[1:36:44] group of people waiting to welcome you

[1:36:47] I remember Maurice they got up and he
[1:36:50] said listen we got to get a move on he
[1:36:52] said I'm gonna go talk to my grandson
[1:36:53] team to get a move on he had been in
[1:36:56] there too long it was time to come out
[1:36:57] come on church and this message was the
[1:37:01] calling out of the Bride amen come on
[1:37:04] Church the seed was trapped in a
[1:37:07] Pentecostal shock but in the days of the
[1:37:10] voice of the seventh angel yes come on
[1:37:13] you know what I'm talking about yes you
[1:37:16] didn't think there was any life outside
[1:37:17] of it you was used to going to church
[1:37:19] you was used to speaking in tongues you
[1:37:22] was used to just shouting and having
[1:37:24] little serving ads but when you heard
[1:37:26] the eagle scream when you heard the
[1:37:28] voice of identification
[1:37:31] it called you out of Babylon and said
[1:37:34] welcome to the bride age
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:38] my brother yes sir there's life outside
[1:37:42] of what you're used to I say oh God what
[1:37:45] a prophet said they need their eyes open
[1:37:49] Church you know what you need right now
[1:37:52] you don't need another message
[1:37:54] and you don't need another messenger
[1:37:57] and you don't need another Bible you
[1:38:00] need your eyes open to what's around you
[1:38:04] and the only way your eyes can come open
[1:38:08] is there would be an ASAP
[1:38:13] Revelation 3 18 that anoint thine eyes
[1:38:16] that their eyes may see that word c
[1:38:19] means to look it means to discern a bone
[1:38:22] church that's why the devil hates you
[1:38:24] brother Stephen that's why the Devil
[1:38:25] Couldn't trap you in false Doctrine
[1:38:27] because you had Asaf
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:34] it tried brother Maurice but it couldn't
[1:38:37] because you already had eyeshaft listen
[1:38:40] friends before the false Doctrine come
[1:38:43] your way you was already equipped with a
[1:38:45] seed to discern between the spirit of
[1:38:48] truth and the spirit of error
[1:38:52] come on that's why the devil hates this
[1:38:54] bride it's cause we conceive ourselves
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:39:01] you know why the devil wanted you to
[1:39:03] stay blind because a blind person no
[1:39:05] offense but a blind person is easier to
[1:39:08] deal with
[1:39:09] you can tell them that color is that and
[1:39:12] they have to say it because they have no
[1:39:14] ability to see for themselves you can
[1:39:17] tell them the sky is green and they
[1:39:19] believe the sky is green because they
[1:39:21] have no ability to see for themselves
[1:39:24] but when their eyes come open amen amen
[1:39:28] amen when their eyes come open they can
[1:39:31] see it's not three Gods it's one Lord
[1:39:35] when their eyes come open they can see
[1:39:37] that as God said his word he always sent
[1:39:40] it by the channel of the prophets yes
[1:39:43] that's right when their eyes come open
[1:39:45] they can see the horror of Revelation
[1:39:47] 17. it's the Roman Catholic church and
[1:39:51] her Harlot daughters are the prostitute
[1:39:53] denominations preach my brother
[1:39:56] when our eyes come open
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:08] listen brother Stephen I've had a lot of
[1:40:11] them tell me in my few short young years
[1:40:12] if you leave me you're finished well let
[1:40:15] me just go and say this I am obligated
[1:40:17] to no man
[1:40:20] if a man could have stopped me Daddy he
[1:40:23] would have stopped me a long time ago
[1:40:24] but a man didn't call me and a man can't
[1:40:28] finish me but he that has begun a good
[1:40:31] work
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:34] I got eyes to see
[1:40:38] I got ears to hear remember said what he
[1:40:42] said that we might he said send that I
[1:40:44] said well Mercy y'all are pulling faster
[1:40:46] and I can preach
[1:40:48] we might have Isaac

[1:40:53] the invisible God come on church we
[1:40:57] might see the invisible God working
[1:40:59] among his people

[1:41:05] promised what he'd done he would be with
[1:41:08] us and the works that he was doing we
[1:41:10] would do like manner works until he
[1:41:13] comes somebody say see the invisible God
[1:41:18] brother Stephen that's almost a
[1:41:20] contradicting statement to see the
[1:41:24] invisible God but thank God for a
[1:41:27] prophet
[1:41:29] who said Jesus did the works of the
[1:41:32] father amen so when you've seen the
[1:41:34] works of
[1:41:36] when you've seen The Works in Jesus you
[1:41:39] were seeing the father he said that's
[1:41:42] right amen Jesus was the Incarnate God
[1:41:45] he said that God the Father which is the
[1:41:47] father of Jesus Christ the great spirit
[1:41:49] dwelt in the fullness of his power in
[1:41:52] Jesus Christ which was the Tabernacle of
[1:41:55] God made flesh and dwelt on Earth
[1:41:57] representing the word Jesus was the word
[1:42:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:42:04] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:42:06] and the Word was invisible but the word
[1:42:09] was made flesh
[1:42:11] the word was invisible until it was made
[1:42:15] flesh and then the word become visible
[1:42:19] Humble Church wherever Jesus is that's
[1:42:22] where Heaven is
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:26] am I going too long
[1:42:28] wherever Jesus is that's where Heaven is

[1:42:58] prophetic message yes my brother and if
[1:43:01] the message is in the church and the
[1:43:04] church is in the message and the message
[1:43:06] is in the bride then the bride's flesh

[1:49:22] tell you did but let me just say this
[1:49:24] the reason why there's no anointing is
[1:49:26] because the better things you went to
[1:49:28] were not the better things of Hebrews
[1:49:30] eight they were the better things of
[1:49:32] some religion
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:34] bird listen
[1:49:37] I know it's not popular but humble
[1:49:40] yourself and just say what a prophet
[1:49:42] said
[1:49:46] if he said the third pool's here just
[1:49:49] say it
[1:49:50] if he said you always was the son of God
[1:49:53] just say it if he said you're Justified
[1:49:56] just say it amen
[1:50:01] this bride is not fed by little
[1:50:04] sermonettes

[1:50:18] and you're in the field of Boaz
[1:50:20] [Applause]
[1:50:23] come on I know people say well well all
[1:50:25] Rue Scott was handfuls but do you
[1:50:28] realize those handfuls were mouthfuls
[1:50:33] they were not just little crumbs that
[1:50:36] Boaz was leaving behind they were a
[1:50:38] handful of purpose I'm on church and
[1:50:41] according to the book of Ephesians you
[1:50:43] have been called to an eternal purpose
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:49] then come on church I'm about to lay out
[1:50:52] of here climb up on out of this
[1:50:54] religious age and walk around in the
[1:50:57] heavenlies and pick up some handfuls
[1:50:59] foreign

[1:51:07] marriage is still on the Rocks explore

[1:51:28] dudes that told you sow a seed and
[1:51:30] you'll be rich in no time
[1:51:33] this message was the Turning of your
[1:51:36] attention from the Earthly things to the
[1:51:38] Heavenly things and over their money
[1:51:41] don't matter that's right yes my brother
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:50] I know how long I've been preaching
[1:51:52] preach preach preaching can I can I can
[1:51:55] I go on just a second
[1:51:57] explore the heavenlies
[1:52:00] you know what's that word explore means
[1:52:01] it means to travel in them
[1:52:04] it means to go through them it means to
[1:52:06] familiarize yourself with the country
[1:52:08] area in order in order to learn about or
[1:52:10] familiarize oneself with it means to
[1:52:13] search for the resources
[1:52:15] hell Glory it means to inquire into or
[1:52:19] discuss amen as subject or issue in
[1:52:21] detail
[1:52:24] the brother Stephen you're no longer
[1:52:26] just preaching the low shallow thoughts
[1:52:33] listen
[1:52:35] to my brother when I first started
[1:52:37] evangelizing I mean people told me they
[1:52:39] said brother Andrew Evans us that's not
[1:52:40] your place you're not to preach the
[1:52:42] seventh seal not to preach the third
[1:52:43] pool just just preach some little simple
[1:52:45] Evangelistic thoughts I said okay I said
[1:52:48] well I guess that's not what I'm called
[1:52:50] to do so I go and try to find some
[1:52:51] little shallow amen simple Evangelistic
[1:52:54] thoughts it would satisfy what people
[1:52:56] thought all to be saying but you know
[1:52:58] when I found out I found out there was
[1:53:00] no anointing for me in those you know
[1:53:02] why because my anointing is not laying
[1:53:05] in some of the little shallow idea of
[1:53:07] some man's imagination my anointing is
[1:53:11] laying in the resources of the message
[1:53:13] of the earth that I say thank God for
[1:53:16] men like brother Stephen thank God for
[1:53:18] this powerful Ministry that'll dig
[1:53:20] through the message
[1:53:21] [Applause]
[1:53:23] they'll dig through the quote they'll
[1:53:25] dig to the scriptures and they'll find
[1:53:27] something they'll find a golden nugget
[1:53:30] and they'll polish it up and they'll
[1:53:33] bring it to the church
[1:53:34] [Applause]

[1:58:42] but we are not of this world
[1:58:45] there is a deep calling to the Deep
[1:58:50] there is a calling from a place of
[1:58:53] perfection
[1:58:56] now I'm gonna have to skip a lot to say
[1:58:58] this
[1:59:01] Third Exodus
[1:59:02] 1963.
[1:59:04] says these words
[1:59:07] he says we're going to leave here one of
[1:59:09] these mornings
[1:59:14] okay
[1:59:15] but Stephen we're going to leave here
[1:59:16] one of these mornings
[1:59:18] after thinking about something with that
[1:59:19] word familiarize yourself
[1:59:21] ever go to a theater or an auditorium to
[1:59:23] see a singer or a concert or your kids
[1:59:25] in a play or something and you go in
[1:59:27] this this Auditorium and you walk in
[1:59:29] there and you sit down and all of a
[1:59:32] sudden it gets real dark
[1:59:34] and out of nowhere a voice comes in and
[1:59:37] the voice says Welcome to our theater
[1:59:39] Welcome to our Auditorium
[1:59:41] in the unlikely event of an emergency
[1:59:43] we would like for you to familiarize
[1:59:45] yourself with the exits out of the
[1:59:48] auditorium
[1:59:49] and out of nowhere while it's dark
[1:59:54] a lot will come on
[1:59:56] above the door and it says Exit
[1:59:59] because it's dark the second the light
[2:00:03] comes on you didn't get up and go to the
[2:00:05] light for it to get your attention
[2:00:07] but when the light come on it connected
[2:00:11] with your eyes and it turns your eyes
[2:00:13] towards the light
[2:00:15] the exit sign didn't come to it the sign
[2:00:19] the light turns your eyes to and I got
[2:00:21] to thinking about this
[2:00:23] we are in the darkest of Seven Ages
[2:00:25] that's right and we had a Prophet come
[2:00:27] in this generation and you know what he
[2:00:30] said he said it's not going to be an
[2:00:32] unlikely event he said it's events made
[2:00:34] clear by prophecy I'm on Church yes sir
[2:00:37] the background from the Rapture is
[2:00:39] Psalms 27 and it's in the time of
[2:00:43] trouble right right it's a total
[2:00:45] blackout but there's a man here
[2:00:52] there's a man here that can turn on the
[2:00:55] light

[2:01:09] you know what in that theater in that
[2:01:10] Auditorium brother Stephen there's
[2:01:12] multiple exit signs which means there's
[2:01:14] multiple exits but in this message
[2:01:19] if you want out of time into eternity if
[2:01:22] you want to leave this world by The
[2:01:24] Rapture there is only one exit
[2:01:29] brother Kaylee you know what it is it's
[2:01:32] the message of the hour
[2:01:34] it's the calling out of the Bride for
[2:01:36] the church The Exodus for the Rapture
[2:01:39] come on Church the World Church is
[2:01:41] headed for tribulation but some ride is
[2:01:44] headed for glorification

[2:01:51] that Mercy he said God makes a way of
[2:01:52] Escape for all those who desire to fall
[2:01:54] that way that's the mercies with him
[2:01:56] making a way of Escape

[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:19] can I say it to you like this
[2:04:23] God's power to transform power of
[2:04:25] transformation program says it very
[2:04:27] plainly
[2:04:28] he says the word Ark transform the
[2:04:30] people
[2:04:31] from the Earth to Glory
[2:04:35] he said from the Earth to the skies
[2:04:37] can I tell you what didn't happen
[2:04:39] thank you
[2:04:41] Noah's Ark transformed those that was in
[2:04:44] it
[2:04:46] from the Earth to the skies can I say
[2:04:48] this it did not affect those around it
[2:04:54] in other words you could have been
[2:04:57] hanging on to the side of it
[2:04:59] and you wouldn't have made it
[2:05:04] you could have thought you knew more
[2:05:06] than no one knew in the ark so you could
[2:05:08] have got in front of it
[2:05:11] and tried to lead the ark and you still
[2:05:13] would have died
[2:05:15] because the only provided place of
[2:05:18] protection was to those that were in it
[2:05:22] [Applause]
[2:05:24] now listen
[2:05:26] if you're hanging onto the rails of this
[2:05:28] message you won't make it to the new
[2:05:30] world
[2:05:32] and if you get elevated in your mind
[2:05:34] that you know more than a prophet and
[2:05:35] you know more than the message you've
[2:05:37] got a better way to approach it so you
[2:05:39] get out from around it and get in front
[2:05:40] of it you won't make it the ark will run
[2:05:41] you over
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:47] but if you want Fedora to open
[2:05:49] and see the streets of gold
[2:05:52] the walls of Jasper
[2:05:55] the gates of pearl
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:06:00] you better get in it
[2:06:04] once you stand to your feet with us this
[2:06:05] evening
[2:06:07] the message the prophet of God said the
[2:06:09] message
[2:06:10] he said it's finished
[2:06:12] it's a perfect message
[2:06:18] do you realize your air

[2:06:24] you are The Heirs of salvation
[2:06:27] to a Heavenly message

[2:06:38] brother he said I'd want to walk through
[2:06:39] there
[2:06:40] and see what was left for me

[2:06:45] there that had my name on it he said and
[2:06:46] you know what he said if there was
[2:06:47] something a little too high for me
[2:06:49] he said you know what I'd do he said I'd
[2:06:51] get get the ladder and he said I'd climb
[2:06:54] up there and I'd get a hold of it
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:06:59] you know what I say Church
[2:07:01] I say it's time to start climbing
[2:07:02] through this message
[2:07:05] I don't have much confidence in Earthly
[2:07:07] things
