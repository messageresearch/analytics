[53:13] problem uh I will announce it on Sunday
[53:16] Lord's willing okay we we we we working
[53:19] on that amen amen for some reason oh
[53:24] God if you see what the holy spirit is
[53:27] unfolding my mind I can't even scripture
[53:30] I read before and then I'm sitting as
[53:33] soon as I begin to just meditate on
[53:36] that and he keept coming up so I don't
[53:39] even know if one day 3 hours will be
[53:42] even sured because of the material that
[53:45] is coming and it's coming up with
[53:46] scripture with scripture with scripture
[53:48] with and I was coming uh toward work and
[53:51] the Holy Spirit through my wife gave me
[53:53] a quote I usually say that without a qut
[53:56] and he brought BR on Boo's eyes with a
[53:59] quot straight like my
[54:03] God boy you going to be in
[54:05] [Laughter]
[54:08] trouble amen amen no he's going to make
[54:12] our marriages better in
[54:14] sweeten don't worry oh goodness I won't
[54:17] give you that code if I give it to you
[54:19] somebody will run quickly like hands
[54:25] up oh oh my I was sitting in the office
[54:28] there taking the coat and putting that
[54:30] quickly
[54:32] before he crosses my mind because any
[54:34] time it's coming sometime it's at 2: am.
[54:36] and I'm sitting after 2: am I got to
[54:38] wake up in the morning and things
[54:40] continue to come then I have to stop and
[54:42] open up and go ahead and keep putting it
[54:44] putting it's amazing God this message
[54:47] got
[54:48] everything there is nothing that is not
[54:50] in this message we just didn't have time
[54:53] to sit there and to dig the prophet lay
[54:57] everything in the message amen there is
[55:00] no aspect in our life where the Holy
[55:03] Spirit cannot touch there is everything
[55:05] in our life maybe it doesn't have your
[55:07] vocabulary but if you look in a certain
[55:10] way because the scripture doesn't have
[55:11] every vocabulary we're using today but
[55:14] it doesn't mean that the scripture
[55:15] doesn't haveen when they say that the
[55:17] Antichrist will bring fire from I mean
[55:19] down from heaven you saw fire coming
[55:22] down from heaven that's a Pentecostal
[55:24] understanding our understanding is Aton
[55:26] atomic bomb so if you're looking for
[55:28] atomic bomb you won't see it that way
[55:30] you have to understand how can fire come
[55:32] down from heaven it was atomic bomb so
[55:36] all of this if you look at the war of
[55:38] Israel and amas it's sitting right there
[55:40] in the scripture you have to know how to
[55:42] decode the scripture and the only
[55:44] perfect interpretation of the scripture
[55:48] today is nothing else but the message of
[55:51] William Marion BR amen I'm not preaching
[55:55] it a convention convention meaning I
[55:57] take a break and then I'm sitting and we
[56:00] pass the ball and let somebody else
[56:02] score so we got brother Solomon Hoffman
[56:05] amen you already heard the anointing
[56:07] coming up so you know what is coming up
[56:10] so I told him I said the people love you
[56:12] you at home he came he opened the the
[56:15] the door I say perfectly like somebody
[56:17] who's at home that's what you do so he's
[56:20] at home his wife is there baby there
[56:23] welcome again sister you not in another
[56:25] church when you here it's a second home
[56:28] so everybody love you we welcome you and
[56:31] we love the ministry and we are
[56:33] expecting great things tonight because
[56:36] the Lord has been doing good things I
[56:38] was with brother Benjamin last night
[56:40] sitting he ate a big
[56:44] [Applause]
[56:49] meal and he even wanted to be in service
[56:53] tonight so I don't know what happened I
[56:55] told him I said if you can go to the
[56:56] hospital you can go to church you can
[56:58] come to church amen so I don't know what
[57:00] happened maybe he's resting or something
[57:02] like that when you don't feel good you
[57:04] don't stay home come to
[57:08] church amen because the church is like a
[57:12] hospital when you get there you don't
[57:14] leave the same and if and if you come
[57:16] with faith then you're going to leave
[57:17] completely different and the Holy Spirit
[57:20] Will anoint you and God will deliver you
[57:23] amen so let's pull on the gift of God
[57:26] and go with only believe
[57:33] [Music]
[57:41] amen
[57:45] believe all things are
[57:52] possible only
[57:59] [Music]
[58:15] All Things Are
[58:20] [Music]
[58:27] let's just sing that Jesus is here
[58:32] Jesus
[58:36] is
[58:39] Jesus is
[58:43] here all things
[58:51] are
[58:54] Jesus is
[59:01] Jesus
[59:05] is
[59:08] Jesus is
[59:13] here
[59:15] all
[59:20] are
[59:23] Jesus is
[59:28] amen you believe he's here
[59:29] tonight amen we believe that that's a
[59:32] promise and when We Gather in his name
[59:35] he'll be there in the midst and we
[59:37] believe that with all of our hearts amen
[59:39] how many's happy to be in church on a
[59:40] Wednesday night amen thank the Lord for
[59:45] his grace and mercy to be in his house
[59:47] one more time and I know this is our
[59:50] convention night here on on a Wednesday
[59:52] night o tolder the Shango said I don't
[59:54] think this is a Wednesday night prayer
[59:55] meeting I think it's Wednesday night
[59:56] convention so we find that's just about
[59:59] the truth here and uh we know you folks
[1:00:01] love the word here as we do and uh we're
[1:00:04] all fellowshipping around uh the same
[1:00:06] message and I believe it's going to
[1:00:08] produce Rapture in faith and one of
[1:00:11] these days our bodies will be changed
[1:00:13] and we believe that with all of our
[1:00:14] hearts and we're just fighting the
[1:00:16] battle and pressing on until that day is
[1:00:18] here and uh we just want to go to the
[1:00:21] Lord in a lord in a word of prayer
[1:00:23] before we look to the word and uh maybe
[1:00:26] just humble ourselves before him before
[1:00:28] we look at some things here if you have
[1:00:29] a need upon your heart just ask God to
[1:00:31] speak to you and minister to you tonight
[1:00:34] and uh the prophet Tau us he said if we
[1:00:36] we leave disappointed it's not because
[1:00:38] God disappointed us but it's because
[1:00:41] that we didn't come expecting so let's
[1:00:43] just expect the Lord to speak to us and
[1:00:45] move and and I believe he'll do exactly
[1:00:48] what we expect him to so let's just all
[1:00:50] pray together Lord Lord we're so honored
[1:00:52] to be in your presence here tonight and
[1:00:54] Lord we have f moving of your spirit

[1:01:16] midst Lord and what a Divine appointment
[1:01:18] this is Lord every person that's here is

[1:01:25] and you know know the things that they
[1:01:27] have need of Lord you know the needs
[1:01:29] upon their hearts Lord the things Lord
[1:01:31] that may be going on in their life the

[1:01:37] confess there's not a need That's too
[1:01:39] great that you can't minister to Lord
[1:01:41] there's not a wall too great that you
[1:01:43] can't break down there's not a sickness
[1:01:45] too great that you can't heal Lord
[1:01:47] there's not a demon power too strong
[1:01:49] that you're not able to conquer and Lord

[1:01:53] and we just invite you to come into this
[1:01:55] meeting tonight Lord help me to
[1:01:57] surrender to you and to get myself out

[1:02:55] somebody stands you uh you know that
[1:02:58] this church believes the message and
[1:03:01] uh and that right there is just good
[1:03:03] enough to show you amen you believe the
[1:03:06] word of God and we do and uh we we don't
[1:03:08] have to worry about crossing any
[1:03:10] doctrines or ideas but uh we're so
[1:03:13] thankful for that and it's created such
[1:03:15] a liberty for the the spirit of God to
[1:03:18] move and and God blesses that and uh so
[1:03:21] we just appreciate this church very much
[1:03:23] and we bring you greetings from our
[1:03:25] pastor brother Josh Bennett and the
[1:03:27] church over in Newton we want to be sure
[1:03:29] and greet you here and I'm glad to have
[1:03:31] my wife and baby here there're somewhere
[1:03:33] probably in the back I sure appreciate
[1:03:35] her making a sacrifice to be here also
[1:03:38] uh let's read here uh in Revelation 10
[1:03:41] and very familiar scripture uh to us but
[1:03:43] very powerful uh Revelation 101 and I
[1:03:46] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:03:49] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:03:51] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:03:54] was as it were the Sun
[1:03:56] and his feet as pillars of fire and and
[1:03:59] there's so many quotes you could go to
[1:04:01] there in just that verse but the prophet
[1:04:02] said only Christ could have been we know
[1:04:05] that Christ was that Mighty angel that
[1:04:07] came down and he had in his hand a
[1:04:10] little book open and he set his right
[1:04:12] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[1:04:15] the earth now we know the only one that
[1:04:18] was worthy to open book to open the book
[1:04:20] was the lamb that's right so if he had
[1:04:23] the little book opened then it must have
[1:04:25] been in the lamb which was the mighty
[1:04:27] Angel he was the only one worthy to open
[1:04:30] the word and he cried with a loud voice
[1:04:33] as when the lion Roth and when he cried
[1:04:35] seven Thunders uttered their voices when
[1:04:38] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[1:04:39] voices I was about to ride and I Heard a
[1:04:41] Voice from Heaven saying unto me SE up
[1:04:43] those things which the seven Thunders
[1:04:45] uttered and write them not the angel
[1:04:48] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[1:04:50] the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[1:04:53] and sore by him that liveth forever and
[1:04:54] ever who created Heaven and the things
[1:04:57] that therein are and the earth and the
[1:04:58] things that therein are and the Sea and
[1:05:01] the things that there that are therein
[1:05:03] that there should be time no longer but
[1:05:05] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:05:07] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:05:10] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:05:12] ha declared to his servants the prophets
[1:05:15] notice this scripture here in the E
[1:05:17] verse and the voice which I heard from
[1:05:19] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:05:22] and take the little book which is open
[1:05:25] in the the hand of the Angel which
[1:05:27] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:05:30] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:05:32] him give me the little book and he said
[1:05:34] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:05:36] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:05:38] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and he
[1:05:40] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:05:43] before many peoples and Nations and
[1:05:46] tongues and Kings let's turn also in
[1:05:49] Hebrews
[1:05:50] 6 19 and the 20th verse
[1:05:57] Hebrews 619 yes sir the Bible reads this
[1:06:01] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:06:03] Soul both sure and steadfast and which
[1:06:07] entereth into that within the veil sir
[1:06:11] and whether the Forerunner is for us
[1:06:13] entered even Jesus made an high priest
[1:06:16] Forever After the order of man after the
[1:06:20] order of a Preacher after the order of
[1:06:23] MDC we know that was God God himself
[1:06:27] amen we just ask that God will bless his
[1:06:29] word and help us now as you take uh your
[1:06:31] seats tonight and uh want to speak to
[1:06:34] you on a after the order of the third
[1:06:36] pool amen after the order of the third
[1:06:39] pool and amen how many believes that God
[1:06:42] he's a god of order we all believe that
[1:06:44] God sir God is a god of order he does
[1:06:47] things in order and amen and the prophet
[1:06:49] would talk about um how and we'll just
[1:06:51] get really simple in this and build
[1:06:53] somewhat of a foundation but we know
[1:06:55] very clearly that the third pool was the
[1:06:57] opening of the word we all believe that
[1:06:58] here one ones at the end time the
[1:07:00] prophet would say this he said but the
[1:07:02] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[1:07:04] is by the word now not signs not wonders
[1:07:08] not Miracles but by the word yes sir and
[1:07:11] remember he said the third pool was the
[1:07:13] opening of them seals to reveal the
[1:07:15] hidden truth that's been sealed in the
[1:07:17] word he says do you see it yes sir do
[1:07:20] you see it and we know that it was the
[1:07:22] opening of the word that would actually
[1:07:24] wake the bride up as that right amen
[1:07:26] you'll find there in the third seal that
[1:07:28] the prophet would say that the bride has
[1:07:29] not had a Revival yet isn't that right
[1:07:33] he's here in the third s and says that
[1:07:35] the bride has not had a Revival yet that
[1:07:38] she's still sleeping now it's amazing
[1:07:40] that the prophet begins to say that
[1:07:42] because you've got all of these messages
[1:07:44] and all of these uh tapes that are
[1:07:46] recorded and and the prophet says
[1:07:48] there's not been a Revival yet for the
[1:07:51] bride now and the churches had the
[1:07:54] Revival denominations had their Revival
[1:07:56] all of these things had their Revival he
[1:07:59] said but the bride there has not been a
[1:08:01] Revival for he said there's been no
[1:08:03] Revival there he said there's been no
[1:08:05] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:08:08] he said now we're looking for it now he
[1:08:09] said it'll take those seven unknown
[1:08:12] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:08:15] he said he'll send it he promised now
[1:08:17] watch and of course in the church age
[1:08:19] book The Prophet said that the messenger
[1:08:21] of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 that
[1:08:24] he's going to do two he one according to
[1:08:27] Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the
[1:08:29] children to the fathers and two he will
[1:08:32] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:08:35] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[1:08:38] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:08:41] amen so in simple words the seven
[1:08:43] Thunders it is the revelation of the
[1:08:45] Seven Seals and that is what caught your
[1:08:49] attention that that is what woke the
[1:08:51] bride up listen emotionalism didn't wake
[1:08:54] the bride up Pentecostalism didn't wake
[1:08:56] the bride up amen music did not wake the
[1:08:59] bride up SS and wonders did not wake the
[1:09:02] bride up sir listen friends our Revival
[1:09:05] is not centered around signs and wonders
[1:09:07] and it's not even centered around how
[1:09:10] amen the prophet had a gift of
[1:09:11] discernment he had the sign in the hand
[1:09:13] it's not centered around that our
[1:09:15] Revival is a word Revival and our
[1:09:18] Revival is based solemnly upon the word
[1:09:22] that's exactly the right I tell you this
[1:09:24] the order of Revival it was started
[1:09:27] around the word of almighty God that's
[1:09:30] exactly amen of course we know it's the
[1:09:32] opening of the word that brought the
[1:09:34] church and put it back in order amen
[1:09:36] that's exactly right it was the opening
[1:09:38] of the word that put us back in order I
[1:09:40] think it's amazing you know that that
[1:09:41] that brother brandham he would put
[1:09:43] worship back in order but but you never
[1:09:45] find William brandham taking the shout
[1:09:47] out of the church yeah it's so amazing
[1:09:50] how you find him do things as a prophet
[1:09:53] that he would put so much in order but
[1:09:55] he didn't have to take things away all
[1:09:58] he did was put what you had in order let
[1:10:01] me tell you I I tell you church it's m
[1:10:04] that has took things out of the church
[1:10:06] the prophet never took it out he put it
[1:10:08] in order yes sir take your he put it in
[1:10:12] order he didn't take it out listen the
[1:10:15] prophet didn't take joy out of the
[1:10:16] church it was man that put joy out of
[1:10:18] the church the prophet did not take the
[1:10:20] gifts of the Spirit out of the church it
[1:10:23] was man that took it out of the church
[1:10:25] and said we don't need that anymore let
[1:10:28] me say this I think we ought to get back
[1:10:30] to the Vindicated order that God forward
[1:10:33] by the ministry of Malachi 4 if God put
[1:10:37] it in order we ought to let it stay in
[1:10:39] order because if a prophet put it in
[1:10:41] order then it's in the right order
[1:10:44] that's right glory to God that's exactly
[1:10:47] right amen he put the gifts of the
[1:10:49] Spirit in order but he didn't have to
[1:10:51] remove them to put them in order man I
[1:10:54] know people get so up on that because
[1:10:56] they think the prophet he preached
[1:10:57] against speaking in tongu I'll tell you
[1:11:00] what he preached against he preached
[1:11:01] against it being out of order that's
[1:11:03] right he preached against it being out
[1:11:05] of order but he did not take it out of
[1:11:07] the church you show me one place where
[1:11:10] he did it we'll talk about it he didn't
[1:11:12] take it out of the church he put it in
[1:11:14] order yes sir so that God would be
[1:11:16] pleased with the gifts that he gave us
[1:11:19] right amen it was the opening of the
[1:11:21] word that put marriage and divorce back
[1:11:23] in order exactly I know a popular it's
[1:11:27] the truth this message put every single
[1:11:30] say back in order it put how we dress
[1:11:33] back in order and put how we live back
[1:11:36] in order and put how we talk back in

[1:11:43] right amen God sent us a prophet to put
[1:11:46] us back in order yes my brother hey if
[1:11:49] the church is out of order it's because

[1:11:56] sir listen this bride is not out of
[1:11:58] order this bride is in

[1:12:11] church that they stripped all of these
[1:12:13] things that you and I I don't know about
[1:12:15] yall but I enjoy worshiping the Lord I
[1:12:18] enjoy singing to the Lord and you take
[1:12:20] people say we don't need that no more
[1:12:23] and we don't need that no more that's
[1:12:25] not what the prophet said and he didn't
[1:12:28] put that in order you made your own

[1:13:32] order preach my brother Heen we want to
[1:13:35] always take it to one side and say
[1:13:37] emotionalism is out of order shoutings

[1:13:42] out of order using so many scripture
[1:13:44] that's out of order amen and all these
[1:13:46] folks want to make all of this out of

[1:14:09] yes in the middle of the road is where
[1:14:11] the Prophet put
[1:14:13] order glory to God he man what the
[1:14:16] prophet say he saw you and I previewed
[1:14:18] right yes sir he saw the preview of that
[1:14:20] bride that would come out of the leosan
[1:14:22] church age and she was starting to get
[1:14:24] out of order and one that Prophet say
[1:14:27] get back in line get back in order and
[1:14:30] if there was ever time that you and I
[1:14:32] get back in line it is right now if
[1:14:35] there was ever a time that order ought
[1:14:37] to be in the house of God it is right
[1:14:40] now to God that's exactly right people
[1:14:44] want Revival and people want all these
[1:14:45] things but they don't want to get in
[1:14:47] order that's it that's it problem where
[1:14:49] our reval is centered around it's around
[1:14:51] order that's exactly right that's
[1:14:53] exactly right take your time the prophet
[1:14:55] say he said Revival is not adding to the
[1:14:57] church it's not more members and more
[1:15:00] this and more that he said it's a
[1:15:02] stirring up of what you've already got
[1:15:04] there yall know the story he said I was
[1:15:06] looking out there in the lake and saw
[1:15:08] that Lake just rushing back and forth
[1:15:10] that's right he said it hit me there's
[1:15:11] not a single more drop of water than
[1:15:13] there was before it was beginning to be
[1:15:16] stirred up he said what was it it was
[1:15:18] being stirred up and all the trust was
[1:15:21] getting out and the water was getting
[1:15:23] back in order that's right amen the
[1:15:25] water signifies people right I think
[1:15:28] this time there's a stirring of the
[1:15:29] water and we get the trash out of the
[1:15:31] house of God we get the trash out of our
[1:15:34] lives and say God get the trash out and
[1:15:38] put us back in
[1:15:40] order glory to God your time brother
[1:15:44] exactly the truth you'll find Elijah
[1:15:46] when he's rebuilding the altar when when
[1:15:48] the altar was broken down in the Old
[1:15:50] Testament it wasn't until the altar was
[1:15:53] rebuilt and everything was put in order
[1:15:56] yes sir everything was put in order and
[1:15:59] then the fire fell when order was
[1:16:01] restored back to the altar listen you
[1:16:04] find Revival brother sister when you get
[1:16:07] back in line with the word of God and
[1:16:10] God sent us this word to put us back in
[1:16:13] order and to get the church back in line
[1:16:16] yes my brother take your time exactly
[1:16:18] the truth you see that scripture there
[1:16:19] in in Hebrews 6 and 20 that Christ was
[1:16:23] after the order of mezc can you you take
[1:16:25] that word order it's very powerful in
[1:16:27] the Greek because order it means the
[1:16:30] arranging the arrangement in other words
[1:16:32] he was of the arrangement of mzc in
[1:16:35] other words a position he was under the
[1:16:37] position of MDC sir now listen it's
[1:16:40] amazing when you see this because amen
[1:16:43] Jesus was put in order he was after the
[1:16:46] order of the will of the father now now
[1:16:48] we know that God does things in order
[1:16:50] God is not a God that's out of order
[1:16:53] amen and the greater than Solomon is
[1:16:54] here the prophet said you'll find that
[1:16:56] God is a god of order always he's a god
[1:16:59] of order and he does all things in order
[1:17:01] and he does all things well sir I like
[1:17:04] what they testified about Christ there
[1:17:06] in Mark 7:37 he said they were beyond
[1:17:08] measure they were Beyond measured
[1:17:10] astonish saying he has done all things
[1:17:12] well that's right he's done all things
[1:17:15] good he's done all things well he maketh
[1:17:18] both to death to hear and the dumb to
[1:17:19] speak so so we know very clearly there's
[1:17:22] a right order and there's a wrong order
[1:17:24] that's exact amen and I believe that
[1:17:26] when God sets things in order that they
[1:17:28] are in order that's exact when put the
[1:17:30] church in order it was in order that's
[1:17:33] right when man gets his hands in it it's
[1:17:35] when it gets out of order let me say
[1:17:37] this when you get your hands on your
[1:17:39] life and you're calling all your
[1:17:41] decisions that's when you get out of
[1:17:43] order and your life gets all messed up
[1:17:45] when you're the one controlling
[1:17:47] everything you do but Christ has no way
[1:17:50] to have prance in you because you think
[1:17:53] you know the best but let me tell you
[1:17:55] something you don't know the best thing
[1:17:56] for you but God does know the best thing
[1:17:59] for yes my brother yes sir amen the
[1:18:01] right order is when God puts the church
[1:18:03] in order that's right tell you friends
[1:18:05] the church should not be a church out of
[1:18:06] order but we should be a church in order
[1:18:09] exactly right God sent us essages to tie
[1:18:12] up the lucans not not to make us
[1:18:15] guessing and wondering and guessing well
[1:18:17] watch in order watch out of order what
[1:18:19] listen we're not guessing these things
[1:18:21] no more we know what the truth of God's
[1:18:24] word is is we're not guessing around is
[1:18:26] this right is this wrong is this listen
[1:18:29] people that do let me just preach for a
[1:18:31] moment people that are always trying to
[1:18:33] find is something okay that somebody
[1:18:36] that they're wanting to serve sin
[1:18:37] instead of serving God they're trying to
[1:18:40] find can I get away with his can you've
[1:18:43] been asking these questions for years
[1:18:45] amen ain't it time we stop asking the
[1:18:47] silly questions well it's doing this
[1:18:50] wrong and it's doing this wrong if the
[1:18:52] prophet said it was wrong 50 years ago
[1:18:54] and is still wrong today Prophet said it
[1:18:58] was no matter how many years ago the
[1:19:01] truth don't change it is man that
[1:19:04] changes that's exactly right preach my
[1:19:07] brother exactly right take your time
[1:19:09] amen he put it in order yes sir he put
[1:19:12] it in order look at Jesus in the New
[1:19:13] Testament he was he was after the order
[1:19:15] of mzc and we know that Jesus he only
[1:19:18] did the will of the father that's
[1:19:20] exactly right what he say he said not my
[1:19:22] will but your will be done you find
[1:19:24] Jesus here in 5:19 he said and answered
[1:19:27] Jesus and said unto them verily verily I
[1:19:29] say unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:19:31] himself but what he sees the father do
[1:19:34] for whatsoever things he doeth these
[1:19:37] also doeth the son likewise yes my
[1:19:39] brother Everything Jesus would do the
[1:19:42] places that he went he would do it
[1:19:43] because he saw the father do it amen now
[1:19:46] how many knows amen for sure that Jesus
[1:19:48] was after the order of MDC yes sir and
[1:19:51] the things that he did he would actually
[1:19:53] do them by vision amen the message Be
[1:19:55] not Afraid the prophet said any Bible
[1:19:57] student they know that there in John
[1:19:59] 5:19 Jesus never performed one miracle
[1:20:02] in his life without first God the Father
[1:20:05] showing him a vision to do it what what
[1:20:08] was it Jesus was so in order said I'm
[1:20:12] only going to do it if I see the father
[1:20:15] do it first yes and he would show him a
[1:20:18] vision of what to do and where to go
[1:20:21] sometimes it be Samaria amen sometimes
[1:20:24] it be to a well with just one woman but
[1:20:27] God would show him by vision and Jesus
[1:20:30] would obey the will of the father Yes my
[1:20:33] brother take your time take your time my
[1:20:36] brother so we know that God brings order
[1:20:38] by visions he gave Jesus Visions amen
[1:20:40] prophets of the Old Testament he give
[1:20:42] them Visions to uh to show them the
[1:20:44] order that he'd have and we know that
[1:20:46] God brings order by his word yes my
[1:20:48] brother isn't that right by the power of
[1:20:51] His word God sets things in order amen
[1:20:53] you find it verse simply there in
[1:20:55] Genesis 1 that the Earth was without
[1:20:57] form and it was void and darkness was
[1:20:59] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:21:01] of God moved on the face of the water

[1:21:14] deep everything was a mess everything

[1:24:08] voice of God it might kill us that's
[1:24:11] right and you find God institutes the
[1:24:13] way he speaks to his children all the
[1:24:16] way back here in Exodus 20 he's no
[1:24:18] longer coming down and speaking with his
[1:24:20] Audible Voice upon the mountain but now
[1:24:23] he begins to change the way he works and
[1:24:25] he said I won't speak to you that way no
[1:24:27] more but I'll do it by the prophets yes
[1:24:31] my brother I'll do it by the prophets in
[1:24:34] the Fe of the trumpets but said here in
[1:24:35] the prayers said merciful god Jehovah
[1:24:38] the almighty God that thundered on Mount
[1:24:39] Si that he said the people scream let
[1:24:42] Moses speak and not God least we die you
[1:24:45] said great Jehovah I'll raise them up a
[1:24:48] prophet I'll not speak to them like this
[1:24:50] no more he said and you promised that
[1:24:53] you would do this and you did yes my
[1:24:55] brother amen so if God's going to bring
[1:24:57] back order he's going to do it by his
[1:24:59] word sir and he's going to send a
[1:25:02] prophet to bring that word it's
[1:25:04] perfectly Amos 3:7 that surely the Lord
[1:25:06] God will do nothing unless he reveals it
[1:25:09] by his servants the prophets God brings
[1:25:12] his prophets amen and brings the church
[1:25:15] back in order by the ministry of a
[1:25:18] prophet exactly right you'll find at
[1:25:20] every Church age that God would have a
[1:25:22] message for that age amen am right Amen
[1:25:25] in time evangelism I'm trying to cover
[1:25:27] some ground so you give me some Grace in
[1:25:29] time evangelism He said Each age they
[1:25:31] had their own message and their
[1:25:33] messenger all through all time every age
[1:25:35] packed its own message with a messenger
[1:25:38] it was God in that dispensation he would
[1:25:41] send somebody Anointed with the Holy
[1:25:43] Spirit to bring forth his message for
[1:25:45] that age now you you'll go down and you
[1:25:47] study it out here in Revelation 2 that
[1:25:50] God would say unto the angel of the
[1:25:52] Church of Ephesus right and every single
[1:25:54] one of these scriptures you'll see God
[1:25:57] saying unto the angel unto the angel and
[1:25:59] God is sending out an angel but you'll
[1:26:02] find something very powerful here the
[1:26:04] prophet would teach us that God did not
[1:26:06] send prophets all the way through but it
[1:26:08] was a major prophet at the beginning and
[1:26:11] it was a major prophet at the ending of
[1:26:13] it they were not prophets all the way
[1:26:15] through that's exactly right they were
[1:26:17] only reformers amen amen amen I keep
[1:26:22] moving I'll just give this
[1:26:26] to the angel of the Church of Ephesus if
[1:26:28] yall want to take something that's very
[1:26:29] nice to study you find all of these
[1:26:31] different Church ages the different five
[1:26:33] times you read it here I'll just read it
[1:26:35] to you here in Ephesus unto the angel of
[1:26:38] the Church of Ephesus yes sir but then
[1:26:40] you read the rest of the church ages
[1:26:41] unto the angel of the church in samna
[1:26:45] you'll find it the wording is very
[1:26:47] phenomenal because you'll find in
[1:26:49] pergamus in samna but in Ephesus you'll
[1:26:51] find you'll find of instead of in you
[1:26:56] say well where else do you find it you
[1:26:57] find it in ephis and you find it
[1:27:00] Le to the angel of the church unto the
[1:27:03] angel of the you say why did God let it
[1:27:06] be written that way he wrote it that way
[1:27:09] brother sister to let you know at the
[1:27:11] beginning I'm going to send forth the
[1:27:13] word listen can I tell you something

[1:28:08] time that's exactly right thank God did
[1:28:11] not listen friends God did not send
[1:28:13] reformers to bring perfect order
[1:28:15] Hallelujah they couldn't do it because
[1:28:17] they didn't have perfect
[1:28:18] word that's the truth you read about
[1:28:21] Lutheran Wesley these are people
[1:28:23] drinking alcohol call smoking
[1:28:26] cigars study it out you'll find it's the
[1:28:28] truth amen smoking cigar and doing all
[1:28:30] these things they were not word prophets
[1:28:33] bringing order to the church if you want
[1:28:35] to hold on to Luther's message you go
[1:28:37] ahead but God has moved on from that
[1:28:40] that you want to hold on to Wesley's
[1:28:42] message PR my brother listen brother
[1:28:45] sister you got to walk in the light as
[1:28:47] he is in the life you're not responsible
[1:28:50] for what God did a 100 years ago in a
[1:28:53] message of a day going by but you're
[1:28:55] responsible for the light of your age
[1:28:58] and for the message of your
[1:29:00] age take your time my brother exactly
[1:29:02] right take your time amen the prophet
[1:29:04] here in the first seal he said that the
[1:29:06] last message to the last Church age it's
[1:29:07] not a reformer no sir it's not a
[1:29:10] reformer he is a prophet not a reformer
[1:29:13] he said you show me one Prophet every
[1:29:15] start of the church age he said no he's
[1:29:17] not a reformer he's a prophet that's it
[1:29:19] others was reformers but not prophets he
[1:29:22] said if they would have been the word
[1:29:24] word of the Lord comes to the prophet he
[1:29:26] said and that's the reason they
[1:29:27] continued on and baptism and father son
[1:29:30] Holy Ghost and all these other things
[1:29:32] because they was reformers not prophets
[1:29:35] he said they was great men of God out
[1:29:37] there and they tore those things to
[1:29:39] Pieces but the full word of God never
[1:29:42] come to them because they were not
[1:29:45] prophets they were reformers and the
[1:29:48] prophet said but in the last days you
[1:29:50] have to be a prophet to take up the
[1:29:52] mysteries of God and bring it back
[1:29:55] because the mysteries of God is only
[1:29:57] known by the prophets yes my brother yes
[1:30:00] sir that's exactly the truth amen it's
[1:30:03] only known by the prophet it's amazing
[1:30:05] as God would give every individual

[1:30:10] would teach about them for anointings
[1:30:12] that's right God would anoint them to
[1:30:14] believe what he had given them that's
[1:30:16] right and he would give them the grace
[1:30:18] to live the message of their a I want
[1:30:21] you to hear me he would anoint them

[1:42:34] prophet said was the mighty Angel yes
[1:42:36] sir amen which was Christ Christ is the
[1:42:39] spirit of Truth when the spirit of truth
[1:42:41] comes he'll lead you and guide you to
[1:42:43] all the truth
[1:42:45] am that's righten I want you to notice
[1:42:49] in the hand that you just give me some
[1:42:50] Grace as I slow through this but in his
[1:42:53] hand he amen he had in his hand a little
[1:42:55] book open yes my brother take youren as
[1:42:58] I said earlier Christ the lamb was the
[1:43:00] only one worthy to open that book and
[1:43:02] he's here with that book open amen here
[1:43:05] come the lamb that been slayed amen and
[1:43:08] he had the book open he tore off the
[1:43:10] seals and notice what I want you to
[1:43:12] notice because as you take this verse by
[1:43:15] verse you'll find that as John is
[1:43:17] speaking to the angel here right my
[1:43:20] brother take your time you'll find that
[1:43:21] immediately after re Revelation 10:7 in
[1:43:25] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:43:26] angel when he begins to sound the
[1:43:28] mystery of God should be finished you
[1:43:30] find that that that John comes up to
[1:43:32] that angel are you with me on this John
[1:43:36] comes up to that angel and he takes the
[1:43:38] hand he takes he takes the book out of
[1:43:41] the hand of that angel that's exactly
[1:43:44] right and the angel he tells John take
[1:43:47] the book and eat the book that's exactly
[1:43:50] right now he's not asking John John if
[1:43:52] you want to
[1:43:55] pray John pray about it a little while
[1:43:58] see what you think about it no he says
[1:44:00] John take the book and eat the book take
[1:44:04] the book and eat a booken now now where
[1:44:07] did he get the book out of he got it out
[1:44:09] of the hand of the Angel that's exactly
[1:44:12] read now it's out of the hand of the
[1:44:14] mighty Angel like now now you read
[1:44:16] William brand him here because he he
[1:44:18] begins to break this open and shows you
[1:44:20] something here because he said at the
[1:44:22] time that this is happening that that
[1:44:25] that that the seals are open and he
[1:44:27] sends it back down to the Earth he said
[1:44:29] his seventh angel is on the
[1:44:32] earth that he's on the earth at that
[1:44:36] time that's right so but but I thought
[1:44:38] he got the hand I thought he got the
[1:44:40] book out of the hand of the Angel and
[1:44:42] that angel was cry now you see the son
[1:44:44] of man Ministry you see the ministry of
[1:44:48] Christ you see it displayed through the
[1:44:51] ministry of the seven angel amen amen
[1:44:54] amen amen amen amen amen amen take your
[1:45:00] time I tell you what I'll just go to the
[1:45:02] angel himself that ain't how God works
[1:45:05] remember Exodus remember Exodus 20 I I
[1:45:09] won't come to you that way no more I
[1:45:12] will use the ministry of I don't need no
[1:45:15] Prophet I Don't Need No Mess you need a
[1:45:18] prophet you need a prophet I I don't
[1:45:21] need God to send a prophet I don't this
[1:45:23] that's how God speak I friends I met
[1:45:27] folks like this I'll get it directly
[1:45:28] from God I don't need no Prophet you
[1:45:30] need that Propet ever heard that I'll
[1:45:32] get it directly from God himself I don't
[1:45:34] need no Prophet but you're fooling
[1:45:37] yourself I me you're fooling yourself
[1:45:40] God does nothing unless he reveals it to
[1:45:43] his servants the
[1:45:46] prophets it's the way that God speaks
[1:45:49] it's the method that God speaks it is
[1:45:51] the order in which God uses yes my
[1:45:55] brother now it's amazing as you as you
[1:45:57] study this out because the prophet said
[1:46:00] during the time of the opening of those
[1:46:02] seals that the seventh angel was upon
[1:46:04] the Earth am so where did a seventh
[1:46:07] grade Kentucky hillbilly get a message
[1:46:10] as perfect as this message
[1:46:13] is where'd he get it from amen I I pray
[1:46:17] you tell me where did he get it from he
[1:46:19] got it out of the same pillow of fire
[1:46:22] that Moses got his message out of amen
[1:46:26] Amen brother he got it out of the hand
[1:46:29] of the mighty Angel amen this is not
[1:46:31] some private
[1:46:33] interpretation this is this is the
[1:46:35] interpretation from God himself give
[1:46:39] unto the prophet and the prophet unto us
[1:46:42] amen amen amen amen hallelujah he said
[1:46:46] he sent it down to the Earth to his
[1:46:48] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[1:46:50] he said there you are oh my what
[1:46:52] happened the screams the shouts the
[1:46:54] Hallelujah he said the anointed the
[1:46:57] power the glory the manifestation I
[1:47:00] brother sister you you've got to realize
[1:47:02] where this message came from where did
[1:47:05] our order come from we're after the
[1:47:08] order of the opening of the word but
[1:47:11] after the order straight from the Throne
[1:47:13] of God amen amen it's the order of God
[1:47:18] himself amen amen amen the prophet put
[1:47:21] us in order yes sir that's right yes sir
[1:47:24] am mean this message put us in order
[1:47:26] that's exactly listen what did this
[1:47:28] message do it come to bring us and build
[1:47:31] us up in the word of God that's why the
[1:47:33] prophet he didn't just take you to
[1:47:35] justification no no amen it was the
[1:47:39] restoration of all things he didn't just
[1:47:41] bring you to
[1:47:43] sanctification he didn't just bring you
[1:47:44] to Restoration of the gifts he brought
[1:47:47] you to the Holy Ghost the word of Truth
[1:47:50] itself that's right that's what the the
[1:47:53] church has been brought to yes my
[1:47:55] brother hallelujah amen and this is the
[1:47:58] only age it could have happened in
[1:48:00] that's right it's the only age it could
[1:48:02] have took place in that's you realize
[1:48:04] here tonight this is the only age
[1:48:06] Perfection could have came man stay
[1:48:10] right there stay the only age Perfection
[1:48:13] could have came and I want you to
[1:48:14] realize something because the prophet
[1:48:16] would draw that pyramid right statue of
[1:48:18] a perfect man when it started out it was
[1:48:20] really really big
[1:48:23] amen the borders was really big the
[1:48:25] corners was really big but as the ages
[1:48:28] went on it got more narrow and more
[1:48:31] narrow and more
[1:48:33] narrow I can hear I can hear the prophet
[1:48:36] say he says smaller in number but
[1:48:40] greater in
[1:48:42] power amen smaller in number but greater
[1:48:45] in power listen let me tell you here
[1:48:48] tonight this ain't just some emotional
[1:48:50] church this is the power ful church with
[1:48:54] the power of the Holy Ghost amen surging
[1:48:58] our yes sir yes sir this ain't just a
[1:49:01] this ain't just a a Faith Church or a
[1:49:04] patience Church listen brother we're at
[1:49:06] the top of the
[1:49:08] pyramid this is the age of
[1:49:11] perfection I say let us go unto
[1:49:17] Perfection Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:49:21] we're after the order of it yes
[1:49:23] my I I think it's powerful when you when
[1:49:26] you study this out here in Revelation
[1:49:28] because when John here gets the book out
[1:49:31] of his hand he says as the angel told
[1:49:33] him take the book and eat it amen John
[1:49:37] did not sit there and argue he did not
[1:49:39] sit there and
[1:49:41] debate he did not sit there and question
[1:49:43] well you know you know Mighty Angel
[1:49:45] that's a nice book you got right there I
[1:49:48] like this part but I don't like that
[1:49:50] part that's not what John did you know
[1:49:52] the prophet in one place there I believe
[1:49:54] amen early on the 50s or so he said
[1:49:56] that's exactly what happens in your
[1:49:58] mouth it's all sweet in your stomach it
[1:50:00] gets bitter that's exactly right amen
[1:50:02] the word of God Amen this flesh don't
[1:50:04] like coping with the word exactly right
[1:50:06] I don't know if y'all notic that I'm
[1:50:07] sure you have but this flesh it does not
[1:50:10] like cope at least mine don't it don't
[1:50:12] like coping with the word of God because
[1:50:15] when you pass it through the filter this
[1:50:17] flesh gets uncomfortable and this flesh
[1:50:20] gets I don't want to conform I don't
[1:50:22] want to
[1:50:23] but let me tell you brother sister your
[1:50:26] body it's going to C with this
