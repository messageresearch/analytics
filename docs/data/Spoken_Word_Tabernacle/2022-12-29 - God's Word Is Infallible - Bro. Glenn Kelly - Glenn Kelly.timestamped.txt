[26:23] glory to God I was telling somebody I
[26:26] say if David can insert under the old
[26:29] atonement saying Lord forgive me for my
[26:32] presumptuous in
[26:34] if the old atonement was so powerful
[26:37] that he can forgive somebody a
[26:40] presumptuous sin how much more the blood
[26:43] of Jesus Christ
[26:44] amen
[26:45] amen
[26:47] glory to God there is many things that
[26:49] the old atonement took care of it
[26:52] and let people pass through what about
[26:55] the blood of Jesus Christ with the true
[26:57] atonement the anti-tap itself what do
[27:00] you think the blood will do
[27:02] amen that's why the scriptures say he
[27:05] speak better things than the blood of
[27:07] Abel amen
[27:09] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[27:13] hallelujah this Blood
[27:16] let me just leave it alone
[27:21] amen
[27:23] the Covenant that you have with God has
[27:27] nothing to do with what happened with
[27:29] Moses
[27:31] he goes beyond Moses
[27:33] do you know the first priesthood that
[27:35] killed the Lambos who
[27:38] it was God himself in the Garden of Eden
[27:40] so before even Moses came up with the
[27:43] law God already started but before the
[27:46] Garden of Eden before the foundation of
[27:48] the world
[27:49] the lamb was already
[27:52] that's where God look at you that's why
[27:55] why you were yet sinners
[27:58] that Covenant can go through a courage
[28:03] amen and pull you out of the courage
[28:06] when you were drunk
[28:09] you're still drunk you're not Christian
[28:11] yet when you are drunk
[28:13] he will pull you out of a car wreck and
[28:16] everybody else died and you come out
[28:18] drunk
[28:21] but you don't know him yet
[28:23] amen it is beyond what you can imagine
[28:28] amen because God will lose none of it it
[28:31] is beyond that's why the scriptures say
[28:33] why you were yet sinner Christ already
[28:36] died for you in other words he doesn't
[28:39] have anything to do with it we're
[28:40] looking at the sacrifice at the cross
[28:43] once that sacrifice is accepted
[28:45] everything else will pass through amen
[28:49] so never look at yourself
[28:52] look at cover
[28:55] amen take your hand off of yourself
[28:58] look at Calvary that was the scripture I
[29:01] skipped on Sunday and I wanted to read
[29:04] to you then you can see why Paul could
[29:06] say forgetting all things
[29:09] let me move forward forgetting
[29:11] everything that is in the past he knew
[29:14] what he was talking about because if we
[29:16] keep looking in the past then he will
[29:18] see all the mistakes that he made every
[29:21] day how he persecuted the church and put
[29:23] people in prison and blasphemed the word
[29:26] of God and everything the Bible said if
[29:28] you blaspheme the Holy Ghost there is no
[29:30] more Mercy For You Paul called himself a
[29:33] blasphemer
[29:34] preach
[29:36] how is Paul savor
[29:38] why is Peter saved and not Judas
[29:43] why they have to pray for Peter why
[29:46] didn't Jesus say please Judah I pray
[29:49] also for you
[29:50] he only prayed for Peter
[29:53] why not Judas
[29:56] none of these
[29:58] he looked at his children he said the
[30:00] one who will struggle is Peter so he
[30:02] prayed for Peter not Judah and he knew
[30:05] Judah is going to struggle but he can't
[30:07] pray for Judah that is something Beyond
[30:09] and Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost yet
[30:14] I'm trying to stir you on
[30:17] so you can look at the blood amen that
[30:20] blood is powerful amen everybody good
[30:23] with the body change
[30:25] now you're ready for the body to change

[38:38] Hallelujah you got the gospel with John
[38:41] okay in the beginning was the word and
[38:45] the Word was uh who the word was with
[38:48] God
[38:49] and the Word was God and the same was in
[38:52] the beginning with God verse 14 he said
[38:55] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[38:58] Among Us may the Lord add a blessing to
[38:59] the reading of his word
[39:02] uh you know we're looking here tonight
[39:04] and even though we don't plan to be long
[39:07] not didn't have many scriptures we want
[39:10] him to have his way
[39:12] you know in um
[39:14] the thought was on my on my heart when I
[39:17] heard the Holy Spirit near the end say
[39:20] the uh
[39:22] infallible word of God
[39:26] so a topic tonight God's word is
[39:28] infallible
[39:30] God's word is infallible
[39:33] you know when the Lord is dead I'm not
[39:35] forerunning what the Lord going to bring
[39:37] in about a week or so but we're just
[39:40] going to put our little Lake of Fire
[39:42] here tonight by the grace of God
[39:45] and we want you to look at here we've
[39:47] heard a message we heard the prophet of
[39:49] God working uh this but we just want to
[39:52] hit a little portion of it and you can
[39:55] go numerous rate ways in the scripture
[39:57] when you start talking about the
[40:00] infallible word of God
[40:03] and when you start talking about the
[40:05] infallible word of God that's what the
[40:09] holy spirit is moving us into now
[40:12] when he came and he ministered us and he
[40:15] showed us in the beginning was the word
[40:17] the Word was God the word was with God
[40:20] but we know many will take that
[40:23] scripture the nomination will take that
[40:26] scripture and try to apply that
[40:28] scripture to them
[40:30] but we'll assure you by the grace of God
[40:32] if you don't come from God you can't go
[40:35] back to God
[40:38] you know so we know we recognize in as
[40:42] many things I heard the Holy Spirit say
[40:45] Sunday also we got to change that way of
[40:48] thinking
[40:50] and he's saying he's not just saying it
[40:52] but when we go and look into a few
[40:54] scriptures tonight by God's grace and he
[40:57] help us and you'll see
[40:59] but we we coming basically out of the
[41:02] message and if you don't have any notes
[41:05] course I don't have the born but it's 10
[41:08] 354 the word became flesh made flesh is
[41:12] that right so you have to just get
[41:14] around in real life so you have to
[41:16] understand if a person come up here
[41:19] and try to imitate someone else I wonder
[41:22] if you called to preach
[41:26] amen you can only be the way that God
[41:30] Made You
[41:32] because God is the is the Potter and we
[41:36] are the clay is that right we were in
[41:39] the mind of God before the foundation of
[41:42] the world
[41:43] is that so we're coming in here and now
[41:46] God is shaping us and molding us the
[41:49] last time when I was here we was talking
[41:51] about the True Stone nation and the
[41:55] religious Stone Mason because our our
[41:59] battle is salvation versus religion it
[42:03] was always that way from the beginning
[42:04] remember Cain and Abel and when Cain
[42:08] enabled God offered up what Abel said
[42:11] received able sacrifice because the
[42:14] Revelation was given unto Abel Abel knew
[42:18] exactly what God was wanting at the time
[42:21] so we have to understand now you all
[42:24] have to worry about big see the pastor
[42:26] can say certain things but I learned to
[42:28] minister if you're sleeping I look away
[42:30] from you ah
[42:36] Hallelujah
[42:39] so you understand that we got the hand
[42:42] of gracious extended to you I know
[42:45] something worked some come we thank the
[42:47] Lord for you but God's going to show you
[42:49] that reward he will not forget the
[42:51] Faithful is that right so we're gonna
[42:54] have to look in the head we'll look in
[42:56] the scripture here tonight but let's
[42:58] look at infallible
[43:00] now we get here
[43:02] see we lost help us Lord because that's
[43:06] what we're moving into
[43:08] the Holy Spirit showed us Sunday that
[43:12] now what has come down is what the word
[43:15] of God is that right what came down on
[43:18] Sunset now was the word of God is that
[43:22] right what the word of God for your day
[43:25] you're knowing the mind and the Heart of
[43:28] God for your day is that right the
[43:32] almighty God looked upon us and shed his
[43:36] grace and mercy upon us to put us in the
[43:39] overcoming age is that right we get
[43:42] around that's what the pastor was saying
[43:44] when he was saying before we came out
[43:46] some of you have to write you're not
[43:49] rightfully dividing your life well if
[43:52] you're not wisely dividing your life
[43:54] what Satan is doing is pounding on you
[43:57] but he's only pounding on you because
[44:00] he's coming at you when you was a sinner
[44:04] amen amen you keep thinking the wrong
[44:08] way
[44:09] you see he kept saying take not no
[44:12] thought for tomorrow is that right you
[44:16] can add nothing to your statue Christ
[44:18] already took care of it for you we're
[44:21] just this is as we used to say growing
[44:23] up could I just be myself we home right
[44:26] ah you know we used to say you can't
[44:29] Cadillac out of here Satan Ain't Gonna
[44:32] Let You Cadillac out of here you might
[44:35] as well forget about it okay some of
[44:36] y'all don't understand that Concrete
[44:39] Jungle talking I don't mean you can't
[44:41] get a Cadillac what I mean is that
[44:44] you're not going to cruise an easy life
[44:47] out of here is that right so that's all
[44:50] we're telling you because the Bible says
[44:53] wherever it is good evil is what always
[44:56] presence is that right so we see some of
[45:00] you God is already changing your life
[45:02] son you already own the right road is
[45:05] that right I don't want to get ahead of
[45:07] myself but look at fallibility

[45:16] it's incapable of error it cannot error
[45:22] huh we don't have the spirit of fear you
[45:26] trust in the Lord trusting God's word it
[45:30] cannot error
[45:34] it says it's an infallible guide is that
[45:38] right
[45:39] the Holy Ghost will lead and guide you
[45:42] into all truth is that right it's the
[45:46] God for you it's an infallible God it's
[45:50] incapable of failing it cannot fail it
[45:55] is certain if God said it I believe it
[45:58] that's it is that right
[46:01] Vista we're speaking to the Royal Seed
[46:04] of Abraham those that got legitimate
[46:08] reasons for not being here I mean for it
[46:11] God bless them but the ones that's that
[46:13] that well let me keep going help me Lord
[46:16] he said now he said uh the word is
[46:20] accurate other word is accurate it's
[46:23] perfect

[46:29] help me to stay on my point I want to be
[46:31] nice tonight but he's still going to
[46:33] have his way is that right okay
[46:36] Hallelujah he says now in the beginning
[46:39] what's the word the Word was God the
[46:42] word was with God and the Word was made
[46:45] flesh if you got it here I want to look
[46:48] or just read something that the prophet
[46:51] of God said and I want you to realize
[46:53] and don't catch it the wrong way don't
[46:55] you think like men okay he says I he
[46:59] says I see things this is I see things
[47:02] even in the vision things the Lord has
[47:04] showed me and turned right back around
[47:07] and do what vice versa is that right all
[47:11] he's showing you is we're going to show
[47:12] you is that right anything that came
[47:15] forth from him it was not an error on
[47:17] God's part
[47:25] a covenant messenger have thus say the
[47:30] Lord
[47:31] God had to train him he has to train us
[47:34] he has to train you
[47:38] so you're being trained look at the
[47:40] presence anointing because you're
[47:43] hearing the voice of God is that right
[47:45] and brother John you can see the
[47:48] musician coming to another level you can
[47:51] see the songs of singers coming to
[47:53] another level
[47:55] huh God is pleased
[47:58] you're on the right Road
[48:00] I'll tell you that road that you that
[48:02] we're on out there the Pastor said it
[48:04] was what threes is that right he said
[48:06] this is the third time God put a church
[48:08] in his area is that right
[48:10] huh but we won't We're not gonna lose
[48:13] this is the church is that right you
[48:16] know where Street he put us on he put us
[48:18] on Bernice is that right beneath me
[48:21] Victorious Victorious Rhoda we giant

[48:31] of death where's dice thing oh great
[48:35] where is thy victory
[48:40] [Music]
[48:44] Hallelujah
[48:46] look what he says
[48:49] he says and God show me he said I had
[48:53] this in Lisbon he says I said Lord just
[48:56] take your hand off of me he says he said
[48:59] now look at him he didn't even think he
[49:01] was worthy fighting that complex that's
[49:03] all I'm not even worthy to be your
[49:06] servant to see something he he told me
[49:10] he says and I have forgot all about and
[49:13] went right and it happened and I thought
[49:16] my there he said I I thought my help me
[49:21] Lord there why didn't I remember that he
[49:25] said had it wrote In My Pocket a piece
[49:28] of paper and walked right into that
[49:30] doing something vice versa mean the
[49:33] opposite he says see there it shows how
[49:37] much uh how good I am see on the worst
[49:42] of all them would be me after God
[49:45] telling you to do something and you turn
[49:48] right around and do vice versa he said
[49:52] now so you see
[49:54] somebody and I believe the Lord when I
[49:57] was looking at this
[49:59] this would kind of prick my heart the
[50:02] next thing I'm about to read
[50:04] he said so no matter who the man is he's
[50:08] nothing but a human he's going to make
[50:10] mistakes
[50:12] so let's just suffer with one another
[50:15] let's suffer with one another
[50:18] let's forgive one another
[50:21] faith is based upon forgiveness so you
[50:26] can't move any further it's because
[50:28] you've got grudges you hold things in
[50:31] your heart and God came in that door
[50:34] that's what the Holy Spirit was talking
[50:36] about there last Wednesday that door to
[50:39] the heart is that right brother even
[50:42] that door you can't let them in because
[50:44] neighbors pride is not forgiveness I
[50:47] don't want to get ahead of myself but
[50:48] let me keep going
[50:49] he said now look
[50:51] he says now we know in the beginning was
[50:54] the word the Word was God where he was
[50:55] with God he said people make mistakes so
[50:58] let's just suffer with one another and
[51:01] do the best we can he said that's the
[51:04] only thing we can now let's move forward
[51:07] he said now look
[51:09] in the beginning he said now you can't
[51:11] he said in the beginning let's go with
[51:15] it the Holy Spirit must have a door
[51:18] ordained this now you can't go any
[51:21] further back mentally speaking then in
[51:27] the beginning let me slow down
[51:29] see I was telling a religious demon one
[51:33] time they was trying to tell him about
[51:35] they were the religion their faith was
[51:38] this I said Christianity no one can go
[51:42] back as far as Christianity
[51:44] no one because we were in the mind of
[51:47] God the Lord told us he showed us our
[51:51] origin our origin we're from Heaven
[51:53] we're from God is that right we were in
[51:56] the mind of God before the foundation of
[51:58] the world
[51:59] they want to read the slope because many
[52:02] are taking the word
[52:04] many are saying this but what the holy
[52:06] spirit is menacing here is not just
[52:09] something light when he say you got to
[52:12] go a little deep sometimes is that right
[52:15] huh that's why he brought the seals and
[52:18] it was Thunders was hidden up under the
[52:20] seal is that right is that so it can
[52:23] come and bring us what rapturing faith
[52:26] is that right it's not that you don't
[52:29] have it it's already inside of you it's
[52:32] already been planted inside of you it's
[52:35] just that what her sister sharing some
[52:38] see the Thunders when God show it to
[52:42] them they gonna see it but they're gonna
[52:45] see it when God shows it to him
[52:51] don't fail because I catch some of your
[52:55] spirits sometimes it's not that it's
[52:57] putting you down the pastor got to
[53:00] school you sometimes is that right he
[53:03] got a scold you you know that teacher
[53:06] that taught you the best that teacher
[53:09] that kept you in line when we were in
[53:12] school that's the one that we remember
[53:16] because they wouldn't move to the left
[53:18] side they wouldn't move to the right
[53:20] time if you did something wrong they
[53:24] just gave you more homework
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:31] exactly what everyone come on yes my
[53:33] brother
[53:36] then you know what
[53:38] you're going those uh Church ages
[53:41] conduct an order
[53:44] and then certain questions you won't
[53:46] have
[53:52] a pastor
[53:55] love what he does because God called
[53:58] them
[54:00] but anyone can get overloaded
[54:03] what you saying about Kelly
[54:05] you can take a feather right
[54:07] and hold the feather right there
[54:10] and you hold it long enough it's gonna
[54:13] get heavy is that right you see so we're
[54:17] not saying that we're not saying and you
[54:20] don't call the Elders and things for
[54:22] prayer if you need prayer but I'm saying
[54:26] the work that he's that he's assigning
[54:28] to you
[54:29] he's bringing you up to another level is
[54:32] that right
[54:34] I bet at least
[54:38] ah
[54:40] then that give him time is that right
[54:44] so some you'll learn you're lagging
[54:47] behind you know why he's not forcing
[54:50] anything if you notice he's saying now
[54:53] he's trying to find a place to stop
[54:57] why is he trying because now we're
[54:59] pulling we're hungry we're looking for
[55:03] more you see why because we don't
[55:05] believe we know where we at is God is in
[55:08] our presence and when you know that God
[55:11] is in your presence uh who wants to
[55:13] leave out of that presence is that right
[55:15] some can't go you know they're looking
[55:18] for you we thank God for the mystery we
[55:20] thank God for the Deep thing but what is
[55:22] the Revelation faith is a revelation
[55:26] just believe what you're hearing gotta
[55:29] unfold it to you
[55:34] I don't know why we went that way but it
[55:36] was
[55:37] help me Lord
[55:39] he said now look let's see what he said
[55:42] here
[55:43] he said now
[55:46] now you can't go any further back
[55:49] mentally speaking
[55:51] he said then in the beginning
[55:54] in the beginning before there was a
[55:56] world before there was a star before
[55:59] there was a son a moon anything else
[56:03] before there was any creature creation
[56:07] that's in the beginning is that right
[56:10] he says now as far as we can go is back
[56:14] to the what beginning
[56:16] they're with me he said now in the
[56:19] beginning he said in the beginning was
[56:21] the word and the Word was God and the
[56:24] Word was with God and the Word was made
[56:27] flesh he said then the word was Jesus
[56:30] Christ is that right he said he showed
[56:34] us and that what he's showing us when
[56:35] the Capstone came down Christ came down
[56:38] he showed the Holy Spirit showed us that
[56:40] Sunday he said that was who Christ but
[56:43] it was the word it was the word and
[56:44] spirit formed now coming from the what
[56:47] descending opening the word in his end
[56:50] time and that's what he say we're going
[56:52] to get to we're going to get somewhere
[56:54] tonight God help me he said now look
[56:58] he says now in the beginning was Jesus
[57:01] Christ
[57:02] he said now I'm gonna drop down to any
[57:04] beginning was the word
[57:07] he said oh we'll whine ourselves out
[57:11] with here in the good old scriptures
[57:13] let's look into the good old scriptures
[57:16] how I just love it you feel at home when
[57:19] you get into it you know that don't you
[57:22] love it we're gonna get into some
[57:24] scriptures in a minute help me Lord he
[57:26] says in the beginning what's the word
[57:28] and the Word was with God and the Word
[57:31] was God the word itself was God and the
[57:35] Word was made flesh and droved among us
[57:37] and we beheld him in the glory of the
[57:41] father we beheld the word that was in
[57:44] the beginning he said become what become
[57:47] flesh on the Earth
[57:49] he said now what a marvelous thing to
[57:52] think that made flesh to take to do what
[57:56] Jesus came to made flesh to do what take
[57:59] away your sins is that right but now
[58:02] he's given you a clear run
[58:04] understanding about the ministry of the
[58:08] son of man is that right
[58:12] so you got to understand now you're
[58:15] catching and you tying it in with the
[58:17] scriptures when the son of man first
[58:20] came he came as a savior he came to
[58:23] Sanctified us he came and he said love
[58:25] to us is that right he came to redeem us
[58:28] is that right so we're talking about the
[58:31] son of man when he walked here on Earth
[58:33] he was what he was too wise to make a
[58:36] mistake he was too righteous to do any
[58:38] wrong why wouldn't you want to be like
[58:41] him because he lived a Victorious life
[58:44] huh whoa the blood Oh The Blood the
[58:48] blood don't sign my name is that right
[58:50] what's the blood today the blood today
[58:53] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that
[58:56] right he's coming down there his Spirit
[58:58] Fallen bringing you the word so you can
[59:01] read what live Victorious is that right
[59:03] let me keep going help me Lord
[59:06] we talking about now look
[59:10] he says in the beginning
[59:12] now now if we could get the Superstition
[59:16] of the world how they worship and want
[59:19] to become good
[59:21] see
[59:23] that's why you're coming and you
[59:25] recognize
[59:26] you can't bring the nomination Behavior
[59:28] up in here
[59:30] it's not going to work
[59:33] the holy spirit's going to call it out
[59:36] is that right
[59:37] because he recognized the ways of the
[59:40] devil
[59:41] so and what we're doing in this hour
[59:44] here now God said I shall restore
[59:48] with the palm of worm the canker worm
[59:50] the caterpillar the locals have eaten up
[59:52] the Catholic the Baptist the methodists
[59:55] all the denominations have eaten up is
[59:57] that right they wanted to stay settled
[1:00:00] bringing a word to transform you in the
[1:00:04] image of our Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:00:07] brought a word to deform they'll try to
[1:00:10] deform you is that right that's why the
[1:00:12] holy spirit said what do you say
[1:00:15] um last Wednesday brother I beseek you
[1:00:17] brethren
[1:00:18] I beg you I'll be with you
[1:00:22] by the mercies of God
[1:00:25] huh
[1:00:27] be not
[1:00:29] conform to this world
[1:00:34] but be ye transformed
[1:00:37] by the renewing of your mind
[1:00:40] and the only thing is going to transform
[1:00:42] you is the word of God
[1:00:48] let's keep going help me Lord
[1:00:51] he said now look
[1:00:54] he said that we beheld the word and it
[1:00:56] was in the beginning and become flesh
[1:00:58] here on Earth not with a marvelous and
[1:01:01] now what a marvelous thing
[1:01:05] to think that God made flesh to take
[1:01:07] away sin now we could get the
[1:01:10] superstitions out of the way now certain
[1:01:12] of their denominations there of their
[1:01:15] sex if man becomes real good he becomes
[1:01:19] a what a God imma jump a little bit here
[1:01:23] he said now look
[1:01:25] he said and another reason it hardly
[1:01:29] taught to me no let me see now but there
[1:01:33] it tells us that before there was a man
[1:01:38] in the beginning was the word
[1:01:41] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:01:44] with God and the Word was made flesh now
[1:01:46] and about as far as the human mind can
[1:01:49] go that's as far as we can go back well
[1:01:52] to the beginning is that right but in
[1:01:55] the beginning was the word
[1:01:57] but now
[1:01:58] that's as far as we can go by the
[1:02:01] theology
[1:02:05] let's see what brother random going see
[1:02:07] what he's bringing you that's why when
[1:02:10] you heard the Holy Spirit say through
[1:02:11] the pastor son you got to change your
[1:02:13] thinking
[1:02:18] he said that's as far as we can go by
[1:02:21] our mind
[1:02:23] he said but Revelation carries us beyond
[1:02:26] that is that right he said if you're
[1:02:29] teaching something on Theologian you
[1:02:31] think in the beginning was the word
[1:02:33] you said that was God
[1:02:36] now we're talking about an intellectual
[1:02:38] way of teaching it you got to catch it
[1:02:40] he said now
[1:02:42] it tells God help me he said in the
[1:02:45] beginning with the word that was God and
[1:02:48] the Word was God that's right
[1:02:50] this same word was made flesh dwelled
[1:02:53] Among Us and God was flesh he says
[1:02:55] that's without controversy he said
[1:02:59] that's true God was made flesh we
[1:03:02] believe that but now
[1:03:03] this word what is a word
[1:03:07] and word is the manifestation of a
[1:03:11] thought
[1:03:14] amen you see let's keep going
[1:03:17] he said now it's the manifestation of
[1:03:20] your thought it is expressed of a
[1:03:23] thought
[1:03:24] he says is that right before you say
[1:03:26] anything
[1:03:28] subconsciously you think it before you
[1:03:31] speak it is that right
[1:03:33] that's why you have to understand the
[1:03:36] word of God it comes from going god with
[1:03:40] with taking on the mind of God the
[1:03:43] message that God sent for this hour
[1:03:45] which is the word of God is the mind of
[1:03:48] God so you pray and you read your Bible
[1:03:51] and before you answer he said be slow to
[1:03:55] speak
[1:03:56] quick to listen
[1:03:57] slowly wrath is that right
[1:04:13] thank you Jesus he said now the word of
[1:04:16] the manifestation of the authority
[1:04:18] expressed he says so in the beginning
[1:04:19] was the word he said that's as far we
[1:04:22] can go back this by this by theologies
[1:04:25] he but before the word he says what it
[1:04:28] was was a thought and and a thought was
[1:04:31] made what medicine manifest see what I
[1:04:35] mean he says now the first he thought he
[1:04:39] said now that's how he said first he
[1:04:42] thought he spoke the word and the Word
[1:04:43] was made what manifest is that right so
[1:04:47] you picking up the mind of God he comes
[1:04:50] down he opened the book he bring his
[1:04:51] word the word and the mind of god let's
[1:04:54] keep it just simple you see he says oh
[1:04:57] how and then he said oh how infallible
[1:05:01] God is what notice every thought when
[1:05:05] it's spoken Hallelujah
[1:05:08] he said no wonder when we come off
[1:05:11] because when he came off the hill
[1:05:13] remember when Jesus came off the hill
[1:05:15] and Jesus looked the fire off and when
[1:05:18] he looked the far off what he was doing
[1:05:20] he was trying to show him by the grace
[1:05:22] of God his thought he said he cooked he
[1:05:24] picked up the thought of the father is
[1:05:27] that right and he looked and he saw that
[1:05:29] it was what and that I tell you what
[1:05:31] let's turn to that Mark
[1:05:33] help me Lord
[1:05:38] I think it was Mark 11. thank you Lord
[1:05:46] foreign
[1:05:53] infallible worried of God
[1:05:57] God in his word is what one
[1:06:01] all one some of you looking at me don't
[1:06:03] think I'm trying to bring nothing
[1:06:06] different I'm just bringing it right by
[1:06:07] the scripture God and his word and the
[1:06:09] spirit is what all what there's one the
[1:06:12] Bible backs that is that right
[1:06:15] Hallelujah he said now look
[1:06:19] let's look for for the sake of time look
[1:06:22] at verse 12.
[1:06:24] he says and on tomorrow when they who
[1:06:27] when they were come from Bethany he was
[1:06:30] hungry and seeing a fig tree of far off
[1:06:33] having leaves he came happily he might
[1:06:37] find anything thereof he says that when
[1:06:40] he came to it he found nothing but what
[1:06:43] leaves for the time of fix of things was
[1:06:47] was not yet see we know those figs was
[1:06:50] the what he saw nothing but religion at
[1:06:52] the time he wasn't doing anything there
[1:06:54] for the people he had the people bound
[1:06:56] up it's just like they haven't bound up
[1:06:58] today we bring a message this message
[1:07:00] didn't come to bind you up this message
[1:07:02] come to set you free this message God is
[1:07:05] a gentleman and God doesn't put in any
[1:07:08] on anyone first he says what he says
[1:07:10] first you have to come in in his hour
[1:07:12] here now who got his body
[1:07:15] spirit and soul is that right
[1:07:18] and so he comes in when it comes see
[1:07:21] taste filled smell in here is that for
[1:07:24] what to contact your Earthly fleshly
[1:07:27] body for you to operate here on Earth
[1:07:29] it's something in that body is not
[1:07:31] working right then you have a little
[1:07:33] issues there he said then it come in the
[1:07:36] spirit man when most Christians believe
[1:07:39] they have it but they get their self
[1:07:41] thrown up when it comes to the spirit
[1:07:42] man is that right imagination memory
[1:07:46] reasoning conscience affections is that
[1:07:48] right God bring those things but he put
[1:07:51] us on what free more will is that right
[1:07:54] everybody's on free more will God's a
[1:07:58] gentleman is that right so that's when
[1:08:00] he said when you get out there in that
[1:08:01] outer court and that Holiness is right
[1:08:03] now you're on free more will he said
[1:08:06] then it's your soul is that right that's
[1:08:09] the real you it's your soul your soul is
[1:08:12] the real you and your soul even other
[1:08:14] races either doubt or is he the faith
[1:08:17] and when the reveal word come he The
[1:08:21] Operators down or even faith that comes
[1:08:23] down there so your soul a true
[1:08:25] believer's Soul got to germatize seed
[1:08:28] down in there that God put there before
[1:08:32] the foundation of the world and so he
[1:08:35] has your pastor he just hid the pastor
[1:08:38] there for a short period of time for
[1:08:41] that period of time until he now he puts
[1:08:44] him there's a deacon but deep down
[1:08:46] inside he's going to be what he was
[1:08:48] going to be a pastor is that right you
[1:08:51] get a double portion the prophet that
[1:08:53] God said when you got a pastor and a
[1:08:55] teacher you got a double portion he
[1:08:58] comes to you is that right so we're
[1:09:00] looking in this hour here now we want
[1:09:03] the reveal word of the hour is that
[1:09:06] right
[1:09:07] Hallelujah you're helping so Jesus knew
[1:09:10] it was that time but when he came down
[1:09:12] from the mountain he didn't see anything
[1:09:14] it says in Jesus and Jesus answered and
[1:09:17] said unto them he says no man eat fruit
[1:09:20] up there Hereafter his disciples and
[1:09:22] then they went into Jerusalem and Jesus
[1:09:24] went into the temple and began to do
[1:09:26] what cast them cast them and that soul
[1:09:29] and bought in the temple and overthrew
[1:09:32] up the tables of the money changers and
[1:09:35] the seats of them that what sold doves
[1:09:37] and then that not suffer that any
[1:09:40] vessels could carry any any vessel
[1:09:42] through the temple he says and he taught
[1:09:46] saying unto them is it not written my
[1:09:49] house should be called what all nations
[1:09:52] House of Prayer but we have made it a
[1:09:55] what a dinner thieves son so we're
[1:09:57] bringing in now God come to restore
[1:10:00] these things back in our day and that's
[1:10:03] why when the pastor put on the Holy
[1:10:05] Spirit put on his heart about to have
[1:10:08] that order and we had our family meeting
[1:10:11] is that right you can see now the fruits
[1:10:14] of it is that right he said you're
[1:10:16] bringing the true fruits of repent
[1:10:18] sentence and when you bring the fruits
[1:10:21] of repentance he said God has pleased
[1:10:23] them so when Christ now is put what
[1:10:25] preeminence is that right Christ is
[1:10:28] being put first in the church and things
[1:10:32] will fall in the order is that right
[1:10:34] it's the word in the beginning what's
[1:10:36] the word the word with God the word was
[1:10:38] with God we're talking about the
[1:10:40] infallible word of God on when Christ
[1:10:43] said something then it's going to happen
[1:10:46] we're going to get to a point to where
[1:10:49] Show You by God's grace who you are what
[1:10:53] the prophet was one to bring us to he
[1:10:56] never did away with the with the first
[1:10:58] poor second pull third pull he never did
[1:11:02] away with it they trying to tell him
[1:11:03] about Pentecost is that right you know I
[1:11:06] love to praise the Lord I love Rejoice I
[1:11:09] love the dance but it gotta be for him
[1:11:11] it's got to be for his glory it got to
[1:11:14] be for his kingdom it got to be for him
[1:11:16] he was telling them some brother was
[1:11:19] mentioned to him about the Pentacles and
[1:11:22] brother Brandon was saying yeah he told
[1:11:24] him about the Pentecost he says but like
[1:11:28] the house whether I'm just paraphrasing
[1:11:30] it he said the house wasn't finished
[1:11:32] being built yet is that right he told
[1:11:35] him you can't throw away the scaffold
[1:11:38] he can't throw it away the gift you
[1:11:40] can't throw those things away until the
[1:11:42] house is finished because the Gibson
[1:11:45] things were sent to keep it clean is
[1:11:48] that right and so as many as many lives
[1:11:52] being changed young and some are
[1:11:54] humbling their self to the mighty hand
[1:11:56] of God um and some of you are still
[1:11:59] fighting those religious demons is that
[1:12:02] right so we look around we are a body of
[1:12:05] family but God is dealing with
[1:12:07] individuals right now it's the
[1:12:10] infallible word of God that's going to
[1:12:13] be manifest before we leave here is that
[1:12:16] right it's not just a spoken word it's
[1:12:19] the manifestation of the spoken word he
[1:12:22] said now look what Jesus said here he
[1:12:25] said help us Lord
[1:12:26] he said now when God came and God said
[1:12:30] in Genesis 1 and 3 if you're writing it
[1:12:32] down he said God said let there be light
[1:12:35] is that right when God said
[1:12:38] I think I lost some spot help me Lord he
[1:12:40] said now look
[1:12:43] he said I believe
[1:12:47] Hallelujah he said but wait a minute
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] said when Jesus
[1:12:56] no he said when he's dead when Jesus
[1:12:58] came off the hill that night and looked
[1:13:02] around the tree for food and there was
[1:13:05] no food you see and the next day coming
[1:13:08] back the tree had withered
[1:13:10] see God's mind
[1:13:14] brother Brandon said Jesus caught God's
[1:13:17] mind that was God's mind we're going to
[1:13:21] show you anytime God says something it
[1:13:23] got to happen
[1:13:26] you see we're moving into something look
[1:13:28] at here
[1:13:29] he says now
[1:13:31] he said nothing to eat the next day he
[1:13:34] said he said God's mine in the beginning
[1:13:36] that was thought before it was a word
[1:13:39] that was expressed Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:42] one was expressing the word back again
[1:13:46] see now he caught by God's mind God and
[1:13:50] the word or what what the hell one he's
[1:13:54] just bringing us into something of
[1:13:56] understanding this is what brother
[1:13:58] Brandon wanted to bring him into because
[1:14:00] he seen the people didn't have clearly
[1:14:02] understanding they were still struggling
[1:14:05] in about their salvation and things and
[1:14:08] like you so in this hour here now you
[1:14:11] got to understand he that believeth on
[1:14:13] the Lord Jesus Christ and is baptized
[1:14:15] shall be what saved is that right he
[1:14:18] said now once a person is believed now

[1:18:20] he said now look
[1:18:22] he says then and every word in the Bible
[1:18:25] is God's thought laid in the seed form
[1:18:29] if received of the human being and spoke
[1:18:32] by the same thought that materialized in
[1:18:35] the Bible see brings the things to pass
[1:18:39] it says see what I mean how powerful
[1:18:41] could the could the church be
[1:18:44] he said the Bible said let this mind and
[1:18:49] that was in Christ be in you as a man
[1:18:52] thinketh in his heart Psalms 23-7 he
[1:18:55] says as a man thinketh in his heart now
[1:18:58] and now your thoughts if they become
[1:19:02] expressed
[1:19:03] see like God said huh let you let that
[1:19:08] let there be a world before it could be
[1:19:11] a word see he said let there be what
[1:19:15] light he said then before it could be a
[1:19:18] word it had to be a what a thought is
[1:19:21] that right he said God in his creation
[1:19:24] created the world by his word thought
[1:19:28] and his word is that right
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:31] first then he spoke it and the thought
[1:19:34] expressed became what
[1:19:36] materialized see what I mean let me look
[1:19:40] at these things let me see if we give
[1:19:41] these three verses he said here now look
[1:19:43] God said Genesis 1 and 3 he said God
[1:19:47] says let there be light and there was
[1:19:49] what it was light is that right he says
[1:19:52] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[1:19:54] faith in what god let's go over here to
[1:19:58] uh let me keep reading that I want to
[1:19:59] read them or um jump back over to mark
[1:20:03] I'm gonna jump a little bit here so
[1:20:05] y'all bear with me look over the mark
[1:20:07] chapter 11.
[1:20:09] until chapter 11.
[1:20:12] in verse 20.
[1:20:14] he said now
[1:20:16] he said now in the morning as they pass
[1:20:19] that they saw the fig tree dried up from
[1:20:22] the roots and Peter calling to them ran
[1:20:24] to say them to him Master behold the Fig
[1:20:27] Tree which thou what curses this is
[1:20:30] withered with it away and Jesus
[1:20:33] answering said unto them have faith in
[1:20:36] who
[1:20:37] see what he was saying so who was it
[1:20:39] that that the mind he picked up the
[1:20:41] thought which is the word of God is that
[1:20:44] right Jesus was the mouthpiece of God
[1:20:46] Jesus was the fullness of the mind of
[1:20:48] God in the beginning was the word the
[1:20:50] Word was God the word was with God and
[1:20:52] the Word was made flesh God the word the
[1:20:55] word the spirit and God is one is that
[1:20:58] right he come around and the father is
[1:21:00] one so now we're all becoming what we're
[1:21:02] being molded back into what in the image
[1:21:05] of God is that right that's why the Holy
[1:21:08] Spirit came powerful that's why the Holy
[1:21:10] Spirit came and said what when the Holy
[1:21:13] Spirit came it had to be in how many
[1:21:14] parts two parts is that right oh I can't
[1:21:18] cheat a little bit I can't get his notes
[1:21:20] his notes is going now
[1:21:21] ah I gotta go home and do my homework is
[1:21:25] that right he said now I can't get in
[1:21:27] there he said but it came in two parts
[1:21:29] is that right he said well after he came
[1:21:31] there in the two parts he said God has
[1:21:34] to do it first he had to come and then
[1:21:36] and now the inner man is that right ah
[1:21:40] we getting somewhere now that's what
[1:21:42] Paul was talking about Romans 7 he said
[1:21:45] the things I desired to do I did not the
[1:21:48] things I desired not to do but I did he
[1:21:50] said I'll tell you what let's turn there
[1:21:52] Romans 7. Hallelujah I'm jumping a
[1:21:55] little bit but that's okay have your way
[1:21:57] Lord
[1:21:58] he said now look he said when we come
[1:22:01] around in there he's telling you the
[1:22:04] Lord bringing you some of you troubling
[1:22:06] in that flesh shot and then you thought
[1:22:08] right uh you thought you're not saved uh
[1:22:10] you thought you didn't have it is that
[1:22:12] right but I just thought it happened huh
[1:22:15] oh he got it up there I need to throw
[1:22:16] him in the Baton
[1:22:21] don't worry Pastor I ain't getting out
[1:22:23] of my position
[1:22:26] right there I'm enjoying it is that
[1:22:28] right God made me this way I enjoyed it
[1:22:31] that way is that right
[1:22:38] look what he says in Romans he showed us
[1:22:41] the Holy Ghost he told us he said the
[1:22:44] Holy Ghost Paul had the Holy Ghost Paul
[1:22:47] was there and when Paul had the Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost and he had it down in what and his
[1:22:52] soul is that right but Paul was
[1:22:54] struggling with the two Natures Paul was
[1:22:56] struggling with the flesh uh Paul was
[1:22:59] struggling with the what the mind is
[1:23:01] that right we don't have to really
[1:23:02] struggle with the mind uh God has
[1:23:05] brought us the mind of God for this day
[1:23:07] and time is that right cast down every
[1:23:10] imagination and try to exhort itself
[1:23:12] against the word of God a move now if
[1:23:16] your word abide in me and I abide in you
[1:23:18] whatever you ask you can't receive
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:26] the infallible word of God is that right
[1:23:31] he told us oh I knew he couldn't redeem
[1:23:34] that flesh yet the dream because Paul
[1:23:37] said he only had Parts is that right
[1:23:39] that's all he had done he only had
[1:23:42] partner he didn't have the fullness that
[1:23:45] would come at that time so Paul would
[1:23:47] love to see and have the things that we
[1:23:50] have is that right Hallelujah
[1:23:54] look what he said Romans 7. but you
[1:23:58] don't get it here he says the believer
[1:24:00] is not made Holy by the law that's what
[1:24:03] he's working with he knew it let's drop
[1:24:06] down here he said to verse uh 13 and
[1:24:09] when that which is good
[1:24:11] made death unto me God forbid but sin
[1:24:14] that it might appear in working death in
[1:24:17] me that which is good he said that sin
[1:24:21] by the Commandment might become
[1:24:23] extremely sinful he said for we know
[1:24:26] that the law is spiritual but I am what
[1:24:30] carnal see just let it slow down a
[1:24:33] little bit see some of you be sitting
[1:24:36] there with them religious demons and
[1:24:38] you're sitting up in there and you
[1:24:40] wonder why that uh you can't go any
[1:24:43] further
[1:24:44] and that's why the last time when I was
[1:24:46] here that's what I was saying when you
[1:24:49] get there in order to lose quotas and
[1:24:51] quote this and quote that but now the
[1:24:54] Lord has given us a weapon is that right
[1:24:56] he's giving us a weapon where we're not
[1:24:58] going to fail is that right the words of
[1:25:01] the Prophet he's the divine revelation
[1:25:03] revelation of the word that comes to him
[1:25:06] for his age is that right so we got to
[1:25:08] step up come on up hither that's why I
[1:25:11] said you got a pastor of the age as well
[1:25:13] it's the prophet of God is that right
[1:25:15] you got the pastor of your house is your
[1:25:18] husband the Bible say if you have any
[1:25:20] questions first ask your husband at home
[1:25:22] is that right and then so then you have
[1:25:25] to understand what the Lord now is
[1:25:28] bringing us and the pastor for the local
[1:25:31] assembly is here the single women the
[1:25:34] sisters and things you know you come to
[1:25:36] them but you also pray and do your
[1:25:39] homework you try to find out where God
[1:25:41] is dealing with you at God dealing with
[1:25:44] you sister this and then somebody I know
[1:25:46] you desire for a husband is that right I
[1:25:49] know some of the young men Desiring
[1:25:52] wives but there's some things that we
[1:25:54] have to look at maybe some type of
[1:25:56] tradition one day I said we're going to
[1:25:58] look at the Traditions tradition I'll
[1:26:00] tell you put a lot of pressure on you
[1:26:02] especially some of you from your native
[1:26:04] different Native countries you're
[1:26:06] putting pressure on you making you think
[1:26:08] that you got obligations to the Homeland
[1:26:12] um but you got to pray and you got to
[1:26:14] ask God uh to lead and guide you in the
[1:26:17] direction that you need to go or God is
[1:26:20] a universal God and he's able to take
[1:26:23] care of them he's able to make a way for
[1:26:25] them he said I am the way I am the truth
[1:26:28] he said I am the life is that right he
[1:26:31] said no man can come to me unless they
[1:26:33] what come go through me unless then they
[1:26:35] can get to the father they got to come
[1:26:37] through me I'm that door is that right
[1:26:39] I'm the door I'm the way like Jesus say
[1:26:42] so you know what watch the way our sins
[1:26:45] nothing but the blood of Jesus when
[1:26:48] Jesus came here living he loved me dying
[1:26:51] he saved me buried he carry my sins Far
[1:26:53] Away Rise and he justified freely
[1:26:56] forever so you got to get out of your
[1:26:58] thinking that's what he brother Brown
[1:27:00] and preached that message lean not to
[1:27:02] your own understanding he did not knock
[1:27:05] school he did not knock education some
[1:27:08] of you young fellas around here big and
[1:27:10] strong huh Pastor you need to send them
[1:27:12] to me I put him to work we work them so
[1:27:14] hard they get enough jobs and they'll
[1:27:16] stay away from me is that right when
[1:27:18] they get around and around in there
[1:27:20] they'll get two jobs is that right don't
[1:27:23] waste your time is that right time is
[1:27:25] money you find people that waste time
[1:27:28] they got financial problems normally
[1:27:30] because you when you're a businessman
[1:27:32] you can't separate time and money is
[1:27:35] that right they base those things upon
[1:27:37] that about time and money how much a
[1:27:41] profit or how much prosperous am I going
[1:27:44] to get if I invest in this this so you
[1:27:47] have to understand the understand the
[1:27:50] way of the the way of the Lord and some
[1:27:52] of you young men well let me leave that
[1:27:54] alone Step Up hello anyhow give them a
[1:27:57] clap offer
[1:28:00] see you gotta understand I'm home I
[1:28:03] don't know I'm home grown born American
[1:28:06] is that right other Soul here is that's
[1:28:09] right so you got to understand that you
[1:28:12] know if I was on some of y'all soil then
[1:28:14] I would have to ask you to help me is
[1:28:16] that right but I'm telling you I'm fair
[1:28:19] I'm friendly but I'm firm is that right
[1:28:21] we're taking on the mind of God don't
[1:28:23] bring me no foolishness is that right
[1:28:25] little father needs to more Folly at
[1:28:28] least to Babylon it leads to they ain't
[1:28:30] talking emptiness is that right so we
[1:28:33] have to understand God has called you to
[1:28:35] be Overcomers that's right first you
[1:28:38] said what keep the Lord before you at
[1:28:40] all time is that right if you check with
[1:28:43] the Lord and ask the Lord the direction
[1:28:45] in thy path God is taking you a certain
[1:28:48] way to strengthen you is that right he's
[1:28:51] not going to leave you he said I'll
[1:28:53] never leave you or forsaken you he says
[1:28:56] you've never seen your righteous
[1:28:57] forsaken or his seed begging for bread
[1:29:00] is that right that's a fallible
[1:29:02] infallible infallible word of God that
[1:29:07] mean it will come to pass in God's time
[1:29:10] we're looking at something for to happen
[1:29:13] but it's already happened you just gotta
[1:29:16] walk in it it's already happened because
[1:29:19] God said it we coming to another level
[1:29:22] that's why you hear the preachers and
[1:29:24] the pastor keeps saying this is a new
[1:29:26] way of thinking you got to come on up
[1:29:28] he's trying to bring you up hither is
[1:29:30] that right this come to restore all the
[1:29:33] word back to the way it was is that
[1:29:35] right Adam Adam ran the earth when Adam
[1:29:38] was on the earth is that right huh Adam
[1:29:40] gave us an example when Adam was able he
[1:29:43] that and had what the infallible Mind Of
[1:29:46] God is that right Adam has an infallible
[1:29:49] mind of God the word of God was given to
[1:29:52] Adam he named the animal he named the
[1:29:55] giraffe he named The Lion he named the
[1:29:58] bear he was able to move a tree over
[1:30:00] here a rose bush over here you didn't he
[1:30:03] didn't need a landscaper he had what the
[1:30:06] spoken word is that right was the
[1:30:09] original seed of God
[1:30:13] the infallible word of God he don't let
[1:30:17] nobody speak nothing on you my wife and
[1:30:19] I went there shared his testimony why he
[1:30:22] dropped on me that's kind of appreciate
[1:30:24] I am I just I got to catch it when I
[1:30:25] drop we got around in there they went to
[1:30:28] the doctor the other day I don't care
[1:30:30] for the doctors anyway you know I only
[1:30:32] go there if I have to go he said I think
[1:30:34] the Lord for a doctor I'm not talking
[1:30:35] about you Pastor how about that I'm
[1:30:39] talking about the unsaved ones is that
[1:30:40] right huh the unstable because I was
[1:30:43] telling the fellow because you know the
[1:30:44] new drug dealers right the new drug
[1:30:47] dealers the drug stores they got all the
[1:30:49] corners out there they tying down all
[1:30:51] the corners you know what I'm telling
[1:30:52] you so we got to understand in there I'm
[1:30:55] not knocking it because I appreciate
[1:30:56] doctors I appreciate hospital I
[1:30:58] appreciate the medicine God sent those
[1:31:00] things to help us is that right everyone
[1:31:03] doesn't have Enoch Faith the prophet of
[1:31:05] God said Son don't have it some got to
[1:31:07] work at it and some just get it just
[1:31:09] like that but we're talking about it now
[1:31:11] I went there to the doctor and we got
[1:31:13] there you know certain organs on your
[1:31:15] body they just get old is that right as
[1:31:17] you get old they get over the flesh
[1:31:19] that's why the Holy Spirit put that down
[1:31:20] down there is that right the flesh is
[1:31:22] not going to be redeemed the flesh is
[1:31:24] always going to go through things the
[1:31:26] flesh is going to get old but that inner
[1:31:28] man brings that flesh and the subjection
[1:31:30] to the word of God that's what we're
[1:31:33] talking about so we get around in there
[1:31:35] he got there he said well you know
[1:31:38] she said uh we got there he says uh well
[1:31:41] you know this this little large
[1:31:43] he said but you know it could be
[1:31:46] cancerous and he said the only way that

[1:32:12] I gotta I gotta be honest God gonna play
[1:32:14] it back when he got around in it right
[1:32:16] and when I looked at him and I said oh
[1:32:18] oh wait a minute honey I'm the patient

[1:32:55] is the least expensive way to get it
[1:32:58] fixed

[1:33:00] he went the most expensive way to test
[1:33:03] cause I already knew he wasn't right
[1:33:06] because whatever happened was
[1:33:08] huh I'm just telling you about these
[1:33:11] unsafe doctors I'm not talking about
[1:33:12] these righteous doctor I'm talking about
[1:33:14] the after that money out there I'm
[1:33:17] talking about they connected all
[1:33:19] together and when he got over there then
[1:33:21] he came around I said doc

[1:33:46] putting the doctors down you got to
[1:33:48] recognize when you got a bad doctor
[1:33:51] let me tell you another testimony I'm
[1:33:54] talking about for the pastor the Lord
[1:33:56] just dropped that in the mind of me have
[1:33:58] bad experience when he went to the
[1:33:59] dentist about 17 years old
[1:34:02] I prayed I cried I prayed I prayed and
[1:34:05] finally had to get there to go to his
[1:34:07] dentist
[1:34:08] and when I go to a dentist
[1:34:10] and we got there and it was on Sugar
[1:34:12] Creek it was already on a Sugar Creek
[1:34:14] and I said Lord I knew someone
[1:34:17] when I walked in there he was training
[1:34:19] and then he wouldn't he wasn't a dentist
[1:34:21] then he was in the training and when I
[1:34:24] walked in there I lit up I said this is
[1:34:27] the place right here because he was
[1:34:30] sitting there and I knew God had
[1:34:32] answered my prayer because we had all
[1:34:34] fellowship at the other church I'm
[1:34:37] telling you God know how to get God
[1:34:39] knows how to get you over what's
[1:34:42] struggling you on the inside
[1:34:45] God knows how to get you older he
[1:34:48] controls This Heart
[1:34:50] he controls the control tower we're
[1:34:54] connected with him and when I got then
[1:34:57] all was well you hear me always well so
[1:35:00] God sent me to the good doctor and God
[1:35:03] will also show you bad doctors is that
[1:35:06] right I'm trying to tell you in this
[1:35:07] hour here now you got to know the times
[1:35:09] that you're living in I don't know why
[1:35:11] we went that way but it's for somebody
[1:35:12] but I thank the Lord for our doctor
[1:35:14] Let's see we thank the Lord for our
[1:35:16] dentist is that right Hallelujah help me
[1:35:19] Lord he said look look at Paul he said
[1:35:22] Thank You Jesus he said now for we is
[1:35:25] that the law is carnal for which verse
[1:35:28] 15 for that which I do he says I allow
[1:35:31] not for that I would that do I do not he
[1:35:35] said but what I hate that I do he said
[1:35:38] but see look at all these things here
[1:35:40] and I'm gonna have to jump a little bit
[1:35:42] for the sake of time when Sona is here
[1:35:44] Paul Hart was right
[1:35:47] because Paul was Desiring to do what was
[1:35:51] right
[1:35:53] that's what the pastor been telling you
[1:35:56] you see Satan's just messing with your
[1:35:59] mind look over here
[1:36:01] let's jump down here
[1:36:03] he said now look he said now look and
[1:36:06] brother Brian he said what they do is in
[1:36:09] that situation when the devil and it
[1:36:11] started affecting you he said then that
[1:36:14] Cardinal mind kicks in when it's time to
[1:36:17] go to church and it's telling you what
[1:36:20] you're tired he's telling you're feeling
[1:36:23] bad uh he make you ill uh your author
[1:36:27] your authors start acting up a little
[1:36:29] bit though but then you have to look
[1:36:32] into the word and say greater is he that
[1:36:35] is in me than he that is in the world
[1:36:38] brother Robert you gotta recognize what
[1:36:41] is inside of you you gotta speak it
[1:36:44] okay
[1:36:47] let's look at Paul
[1:36:49] see what the Holy Spirit gave the pastor
[1:36:51] look what he gave me he said I find a
[1:36:53] what verse 21 he said finding the law
[1:36:56] that when I would do good that what he
[1:36:59] was present with me remember that voice
[1:37:01] he's always messing with you he's always
[1:37:04] going to bring you a wrong word he
[1:37:06] always wanted to bring a doubt he's
[1:37:08] always going to make it that think God
[1:37:10] can't do it but then not when God came
[1:37:12] over to Abraham and Sarah did not God
[1:37:15] asked him Pastor he said what is too
[1:37:18] hard for God is that right God asked him
[1:37:21] God put it back on you one is too hard
[1:37:24] for our God he's the omnipotent God he's
[1:37:28] our powerful God uh he's our present God
[1:37:31] he's here now we're two and three
[1:37:33] together in my name he said what I'll be
[1:37:36] in the midst of you the infallible word
[1:37:39] of God he's here whatever you need ask
[1:37:42] them in your heart he's here
[1:37:46] amen amen
[1:37:48] fly the light in the law

[1:37:54] I Delight into what the inward man where
[1:37:57] we at up here the inward man thank you
[1:38:00] thank you in the inward man
[1:38:03] he said now look he said but I see
[1:38:06] enough and let me stop cause you just
[1:38:08] come to me see what you have to
[1:38:09] understand is just that
[1:38:12] when God give the pastor a word
[1:38:16] uh-huh is no that's right brother it's
[1:38:20] mine now
[1:38:21] ah it's mine now if you don't take it
[1:38:25] then you believe it's a man talking if
[1:38:28] you don't take it you believe it's a man

[1:38:35] coming to set you free is that right
[1:38:37] brother rabbit it's mine now

[1:38:49] said marriage us back to the word and do
[1:38:52] what with the Plan of Redemption
[1:38:55] foreign
[1:38:56] thank you Jesus
[1:38:58] it's mine
[1:39:00] it's the word from here this is the
[1:39:02] Throne of God oh my my it's been that
[1:39:04] long oh my goodness y'all just give me
[1:39:07] about maybe five minutes help me Lord my
[1:39:10] my oh my so much to get I think the
[1:39:14] pastor number he don't been training us
[1:39:16] with these longer messages huh
[1:39:21] yeah let's go he said verse 23 but I see
[1:39:25] another law of my members warning
[1:39:28] against the law my what my mind and
[1:39:32] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:39:34] what sin which is in in my memory you
[1:39:38] don't have to doubt nothing
[1:39:40] you have to doubt nothing
[1:39:44] sin is just unbelief is that right sin
[1:39:48] is just unbelief look what he says God
[1:39:51] and help me same book turn to chapter
[1:39:54] 14. same book
[1:39:56] if somebody just just needs to see
[1:40:01] he said now look once you have Romans 14
[1:40:05] and verse 22 when she had to say Amen
[1:40:09] has thou what faith Heaven know what
[1:40:12] that have it to thyself before God happy
[1:40:17] as he's at what
[1:40:18] that could them not himself in that
[1:40:21] thing which he what love you see
[1:40:25] God needed God he said and he that what
[1:40:29] doubt of his what damn didn't eat he
[1:40:32] said because he is not a what
[1:40:35] for whatsoever is not faith is what so
[1:40:38] you got to get that unbelief out of you
[1:40:41] you're not going you're not going home
[1:40:44] taking the word you're not going digging
[1:40:46] in it because you still fighting some
[1:40:49] unbelief that war remember he said once
[1:40:52] you're cleaned up he brought them
[1:40:54] through the sanctification life but
[1:40:56] himself when he brought him through the
[1:40:58] sanctification like brother brother
[1:41:00] Polly cook when he brought him through
[1:41:02] the sanctification light he was showing
[1:41:04] them giving him a taste after the
[1:41:06] atonement is that right brother Berner
[1:41:08] said he was giving them a taste before
[1:41:09] they get into the atonement before the
[1:41:12] blood was shed is that right because
[1:41:14] then not Peter cast out that was here to
[1:41:16] sick who's the dead is that right then
[1:41:18] they do those things but the Bible said
[1:41:20] he wasn't even converted yet is that
[1:41:21] right but he still did those things so
[1:41:24] God was giving them a taste of it is
[1:41:25] that right he said but whoa Peter he
[1:41:28] said but I know uh that the devil did
[1:41:31] what the devil desire to what sift you
[1:41:33] like we the devil desired to sip you
[1:41:36] like we but what being found word of God
[1:41:39] said hi brother Robert but I prayed for
[1:41:43] you
[1:41:49] he said look he's turning over there
[1:41:52] Lord help me let us look at this one
