[28:35] [Music]
[29:33] we are aware of the ruling what's going
[29:38] on about the restriction of the churches
[29:40] so by the grace of God the committee
[29:42] will have a meeting this week and after
[29:46] we discuss in a committee we will see
[29:48] what we will do moving forward and
[29:51] everybody will be informed about it
[29:54] some people were already informed those
[29:56] that I hope that stays abreast with the
[29:59] information but we need to talk and then
[30:02] to see what we can do and how we need to
[30:05] proceed as far as our ways of
[30:08] worshipping together so by the grace of
[30:10] God just continue to pray so this
[30:13] coronavirus clears up and then we can
[30:15] come back again in fellowship together
[30:17] god bless you if you would you can go
[30:21] straight to your scripture and you know
[30:23] my style now we read 1 and relate to be
[30:25] seated things we need to build up a
[30:28] little bit
[30:30] Zechariah chapter 12 verse 10 we will
[30:35] get into a very very deep water today
[30:40] so those that have been staying
[30:44] following the cirrie 1 2 3 you should be
[30:48] okay so just stay really awake Zechariah
[30:57] chapter 12 verse 10 if you dare you can
[31:00] say Amen we read the scripture I don't
[31:05] know if it's part 4 or 6 or something
[31:07] but you should be familiar with this now
[31:09] and I will pour upon the house of David
[31:13] you might be saved I don't want to keep
[31:18] you standing too long I will pour upon
[31:22] the house of David and upon the
[31:25] inhabitant of Jerusalem the spirit of
[31:28] grace we all know that spirit of grace
[31:31] is the holy spirit that's going to the
[31:34] Jewish people if you miss that you can
[31:37] go back and then listen to the other
[31:39] sermon the spirit of grace and of
[31:42] supplication so somebody will be
[31:45] mourning
[31:45] somebody will be in distress somebody
[31:49] will be sad it's a spirit of grace but
[31:52] yet there is a supplication connected to
[31:55] it and they will look upon me whom they
[32:00] have pierced when they're talking about
[32:03] piercing is referring to the cross Jesus
[32:08] was not pierced in Gethsemane Jesus was
[32:12] not pierced in pilot-house hallway
[32:15] Jesus was pierced at the cross so this
[32:20] scripture is talking about the cross
[32:22] there is a souvenir there is a memory in
[32:26] reference to the cross so he said they
[32:30] will look upon me whom they have pulled
[32:34] and they shall mourn there is a mourning
[32:37] even the Holy Spirit is there and they
[32:40] shall mourn for him as one mourns for
[32:44] His only Son and he was the only
[32:47] begotten - and shall be in bitterness
[32:50] for him it's a feast of atonement it
[32:53] will be deep water so just hang on as
[32:57] one that is in the bitterness for his
[33:00] firstborn we know clearly that this is
[33:03] speaking about the Jews the spirit of
[33:06] grace the holy spirit living the Gentile
[33:09] going to the Jewish people they received
[33:11] the holy spirit then Jesus Christ will
[33:13] present himself to the Jews and they
[33:16] will recognize Jesus Christ and Jesus
[33:18] Christ will show them the piercing the
[33:22] scar that he has coming from the nails
[33:25] if you would again we can go still in
[33:28] Zechariah chapter 13 verse 1 if you dare
[33:35] you can say a man you need to keep your
[33:37] bubble in that day they shall be a
[33:42] fountain open when they say a fountain
[33:46] this is not a literal phantom when they
[33:51] say fountain they are referring to a
[33:55] person if you need most
[33:58] on that you see me the Bible spoke in
[34:02] the Book of Jeremiah God spoke to Israel
[34:05] he said Israel have committed to crumbs
[34:08] to sins they have forsaken me the
[34:12] fountain of living water
[34:15] right so that fountain is a person but
[34:20] if you notice they say it that day they
[34:23] shall be a fountain open you need to
[34:28] understand that the fountain will be
[34:31] open if you go back to the book of
[34:34] Revelation chapter 4 when John was in
[34:38] the book of Revelation chapter 4 John
[34:40] say that John was lift up into heaven he
[34:45] was caught up into heaven there was a
[34:47] voice that told John come up here and
[34:50] when John rose up and went to heaven
[34:53] he saw a door that was opened it was a
[34:58] door but that door was open and brother
[35:03] Branham came and explained to us that
[35:05] that door was not a literal doll he was
[35:10] Christ because Christ was the door to
[35:13] the ship food and the door open Christ
[35:17] opened it is speaking about an opening
[35:21] of Christ a revelation of Christ and
[35:26] unfolding of Christ so to Zechariah
[35:30] chapter 13 the Bible said the woman and
[35:34] a phantom is a person but a fountain
[35:37] will be opened in other words there will
[35:41] be an opening of Christ there will be an
[35:44] opening a revelation of Christ they will
[35:48] be unfolding of Christ to the Jewish
[35:51] people in that day they shall be a
[35:56] fountain opened to the house of David
[35:59] and the inhabitant of Jerusalem in
[36:02] Chapter 12 he says the spirit of grace
[36:05] will come upon the house of David and
[36:08] the inhabitant
[36:10] Jerusalem this is now not just the Holy
[36:12] Spirit coming down on the Jewish people
[36:15] but the Jewish people also will have an
[36:18] opening of the word and that opening we
[36:23] spoke about the seventh trumpet which is
[36:27] the seventh seal to the bridle so if you
[36:32] do not listen to the message this church
[36:38] you need to pray constantly you need to
[36:42] read your Bible constantly and you need
[36:45] to listen to the message constantly if
[36:48] not you're going to be lost because this
[36:51] is your message in that day there shall
[36:57] be a fountain open to the house of David
[37:00] and to the inhabitant of Jerusalem for
[37:04] sin and for uncleanness so that word
[37:09] that's going to be open will be a word
[37:12] that's going to take sin away and it's
[37:16] gonna take uncleanness away because
[37:19] according to the teaching of the 70
[37:22] weeks of Daniel and trying to refrain
[37:25] myself from getting into it there is six
[37:28] purpose that Gabriel came into Daniel he
[37:33] wants to remove that ungodliness that
[37:37] seen that transgression away from Israel
[37:40] by the removing of that you need a
[37:43] certain water you need a certain word
[37:47] you need an opening of a certain word a
[37:51] fountain to clean up the mess because in
[37:55] the book of Ephesians chapter five Paul
[37:58] say the washing but off by the water of
[38:02] the word so that fountain is Christ in
[38:08] opening of the world to wash away or to
[38:12] take away the sin of Israel
[38:16] everybody clear so far verse six if we
[38:20] can drop there and one shall say to him
[38:24] one somebody will ask him what are these
[38:29] wounds in your hand they didn't say what
[38:36] are these wounds because Jesus have many
[38:39] wounds right we know that he had how
[38:44] many strap in the back now you are in
[38:46] the university thirty-nine strap in the
[38:50] back but this is not just the wound
[38:53] because the wound might be here or the
[38:57] wound might be in hell or the wound
[38:59] might be in the feet but this is
[39:01] speaking about the wound in your hand so
[39:05] that is now referring to the strap
[39:08] because the strap he received them
[39:11] before the cross either this is again
[39:15] something related to the cross in the in
[39:19] chapter 12 they say where did they
[39:22] pierce you the piercing cross where did
[39:26] you have the wound the wound in your
[39:29] hand cross everybody clear
[39:33] so we are separating the cross from
[39:35] testimony and they shall say to him what
[39:38] are these wounds in your hand then he
[39:41] shall answer those with which I was
[39:45] wounded in the house of my friend which
[39:48] are what the Jews he called Judah friend
[39:52] right now let's go again to Zechariah
[39:55] chapter 14 still the first one if you do
[40:01] you can say Amen behold the day of the
[40:04] Lord comes and you'll spoil shall be
[40:08] divided in the midst of you for I will
[40:10] gather all nations against who Jerusalem
[40:15] okay tomorrow and the city shall be
[40:20] taken and the houses rifled and the
[40:23] women ravished what a day and half of
[40:27] the city shall go into captivity and the
[40:30] residue of the people shall not be cut
[40:32] off from the city there is a residue
[40:34] then shall the law
[40:36] go forth and fight against those nation
[40:40] so God will appear and fight against
[40:45] those nation this is not the Second
[40:47] Coming
[40:48] okay he's going to the Jews as when he
[40:52] fought in the day of battle and he is
[40:55] what you need wake up and his feet shall
[41:01] stand in that day upon the Mount of if
[41:06] you remember we spoke that in Revelation
[41:11] 10 there was a mighty angel that came
[41:14] down put one foot on earth and one on
[41:19] the sea and we gave you two coats where
[41:22] brother Branham said that Jesus when he
[41:24] counts we're going to meet him in D he's
[41:28] not gonna put his foot under on the
[41:31] ground are you there but in this coming
[41:34] Jesus is gonna put his foot under this
[41:38] is not the second coming
[41:40] this is it is clear in the scripture and
[41:44] his feet shall stand in that day upon
[41:47] the Mount of Olives which is before
[41:49] Jerusalem on the east and the Mount of
[41:53] Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof
[41:55] toward the east and toward the west and
[41:58] there shall be a very great valley and
[42:01] half of the mountain shall be we move
[42:03] toward the month toward the north and
[42:05] half of it toward the south and you
[42:08] shall flee to the valley of the
[42:10] mountains for the valley of the mountain
[42:12] shall reach to a so yay you shall flee
[42:15] like as you fled from before the
[42:18] earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of
[42:22] judah and the lord my god shall what
[42:25] shall come and all everybody clear he's
[42:31] coming with her in revelation 19 we see
[42:34] him on a white horse coming with the
[42:37] everybody clear but when he's coming his
[42:41] feet are gonna touch the earth but on
[42:44] the second coming we're gonna meet him
[42:47] yeah everybody clear and the Lord my God
[42:51] shall come and all dissent will you
[42:55] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[42:59] you again for your grace your love your
[43:02] mercy because it's amazing grace who's
[43:04] even giving us opportunity to have the
[43:07] doors of the church open where we can
[43:10] have services Lord virtually and even
[43:14] rahi alone father we cannot take this
[43:17] for granted Lord because we know that
[43:19] days are coming Lord when this will not
[43:22] be available but Lord as you still
[43:25] opening that door and giving us grace
[43:27] Lord father we want to take opportunity
[43:29] to come Lord and to enter and to meet
[43:32] with you and to commune with you Lord
[43:35] father upon that word Lord
[43:37] may the Holy Spirit father maybe they
[43:40] inside the teacher come down this
[43:42] morning Lord may you teach your word to
[43:44] your children Lord may you heal the
[43:46] brokenhearted Lord may you search those
[43:49] that are lost Lord may you remove every
[43:52] single thing blindness upon the eyes of
[43:55] the people own may father you comfort
[43:58] and you nourish those that are already
[43:59] standing Lord may you take this for this

[44:14] am blessed amen

[44:35] a or B 5 part 6 this is part 7 we have
[44:41] not touched Malachi 4 yet we like we are
[44:46] cleaning up whatever it is around it
[44:49] then when we land on
[44:51] type 4 we won't have any confusion you
[44:54] will know what is the first coming what
[44:56] is the third coming what is the second
[44:58] coming and you can position everything
[45:00] together and see it clearly we know that
[45:04] there are seven seals that are written
[45:07] in the world you need to stay very close
[45:10] with me because this is deep water upon
[45:14] these seven seals together when they
[45:18] broke we know that the first four zero
[45:21] spoke about the Ministry of the Anti
[45:25] Christ in the church the first one when
[45:29] he broke he was a white horse rather
[45:31] when we look in the zodiac
[45:33] we saw the Sagittarius the seventh the
[45:36] second seal when he broke it was the red
[45:38] all sudden he was not a difference a
[45:41] different horse rather he was the same
[45:44] rather he was just changing the horses
[45:47] so when he got there the Scorpio in a
[45:50] zodiac open up and told us this is him
[45:53] coming up then he changed into the third
[45:56] seal which is the black horse order and
[45:58] on the black holes we see him coming
[46:01] with a scale which the zodiac was Libra
[46:04] then the last one was the bellows which
[46:07] was the carriage which we prove to you
[46:09] that he was the cancellation now after
[46:12] that cells we found that there is
[46:15] another seal which is called the fifth
[46:18] seal when the fifth seal open up that
[46:22] seal have souls under the altar it is
[46:27] important for you to understand what I'm
[46:30] saying now because if we happen to begin
[46:33] to preach the seals one by one it's
[46:37] going to be easy for you so when the
[46:39] fifth seal open up we found out that
[46:42] there is an altar I was preaching on the
[46:45] three the mystery of the true heaven we
[46:50] saw the first we need to get into the
[46:53] second and in the third then you're
[46:56] going to see where that all tourism but
[46:58] beneath the altar or under the altar
[47:02] there is a dimension
[47:04] over there that is called the sixth
[47:07] dimension and that dimension is that I
[47:10] mentioned the whole the souls of the
[47:14] people that died after covering not
[47:19] before covering after covering the
[47:23] people that died before cover we went
[47:27] into paradise but when Jesus Christ came
[47:31] when he paid the price he emptied
[47:35] paradise
[47:36] now if a sense died you not going down
[47:39] in paradise you are going up but you are
[47:43] not going where God is either you are
[47:49] going into a region under the altar that
[47:53] is called the sixth dimension that's the
[47:57] reason why when brother Branham went
[47:59] today he asked where is Jesus and they
[48:03] told him that he is a little bit higher
[48:06] he was not there and what one of
[48:09] explained that the sixth dimension have
[48:12] region so when you die when brother
[48:16] Branham went there he never saw Paul he
[48:21] didn't see Irenaeus he didn't saluted
[48:24] brother Branham saw the people that died
[48:27] in his age the people that he preached
[48:31] to so brother Branham explained to us
[48:34] that that sixth dimension has regions
[48:37] clearer they are separated either so
[48:41] under that dimension this is where the
[48:44] souls are under the altar but the souls
[48:48] that are under the fifth seal are not
[48:52] the source of the questions I'm going
[48:57] slowly when Jesus Christ came Jesus came
[49:04] to the Jewish people when he came to the
[49:08] Jewish people as they are prophesized
[49:12] that Israel will be blinded completely
[49:16] so dead
[49:18] not to reject Jesus Christ willing fully
[49:22] they were blinded by God it is God who
[49:27] branded them so that he can be rejected
[49:31] from the Jewish people are we clear but
[49:35] it was not everybody that was branded
[49:38] some people recognized Jesus Christ and
[49:42] they enter among the elect of the ridge
[49:46] some people work on us Jesus Christ but
[49:51] they rejected him as a messiah
[49:54] that was the Pharisee that was the
[49:57] solution they knew exactly who Jesus
[50:00] Christ was when Nicodemus came by not he
[50:04] said master we know not I know
[50:08] we know our clique our group brother
[50:13] branham said that group was the
[50:15] Sanhedrin they know clearly that no one
[50:19] can do what you do except that you come
[50:22] from God but even though they knew that
[50:25] they rejected him either but there were
[50:30] a group that was just branded so those
[50:34] that knew the Messiah went to the group
[50:37] dance blundered and influenced them to
[50:41] reject Jesus Christ
[50:42] so when Pilate came in he said I have
[50:46] Barabbas a criminal here and I have
[50:50] Jesus Christ who do you want me to
[50:53] release they say release the criminal
[50:56] then he said what about Jesus he said
[50:59] crucify him despite what palette video
[51:04] they said let his blood come upon us and
[51:09] our children when they did that they
[51:13] opened a seal that is called the
[51:17] six-year are you there
[51:22] ok the six here is approaching fear
[51:29] essential it's a
[51:31] until they're six healed it's a sale of
[51:36] judgment that 6-cell it is a painful
[51:40] film it is a seal of suffering it is a
[51:45] sill of fire are you there when they're
[51:51] refused and they rejected Jesus Christ
[51:54] the sick seal does not have time are we
[52:00] there the first seal first surcharges
[52:04] second Church ages torture changes I
[52:08] explain this the second seal Italian
[52:13] Church ages where they were killing the
[52:15] Christian filling them to lie on and all
[52:18] kind of stuff the first year to the
[52:22] other world the transyl Luther Wesley
[52:25] and he enter up with the overlapping
[52:28] into the Pentecostal then the last seal
[52:31] which is the ego seal which is the Eagle
[52:34] age that is our serum but the six year
[52:38] does not have a specific time
[52:41] I'm gonna go slowly thus itself is
[52:45] finished in the Tribulation Period I'm
[52:49] going slowly but it's a self they open
[52:53] up and when we open up a bring judgment
[52:57] upon those that reject the word brother
[53:02] branham say when a seal broke it under
[53:06] open the messenger came and he catches
[53:11] the inspiration from the Thunder which
[53:14] is the voice of God then the messenger
[53:17] was son the trumpet when the trumpet is
[53:20] sundered they elect for da judge will
[53:23] catch the revelation and they will be
[53:25] gathered together to God but once they
[53:28] elect are gathered those they were
[53:31] ejected them the six come open eval and
[53:35] poor judgment upon you are we clear now
[53:39] when the Jews rejected Jesus cross them
[53:42] tightly scammer
[53:45] because Jesus told them when you see
[53:47] Jerusalem besiege whoever is in the
[53:50] mountain don't come down and woe to the
[53:54] woman that are going to have baby
[53:55] because it's gonna be hard for you to
[53:58] run and pray that it doesn't happen in
[54:01] winter because the winter there is snow
[54:04] on the mountain so when Titus came in
[54:07] that was the opening of the sixth seal
[54:10] and then that'll kill the Jewish people
[54:14] until blood of the Jewish were flowing
[54:17] like a river Jesus pray for them at the
[54:22] cross he said Father forgive them
[54:25] because they don't know the Pharisee
[54:29] knew what they were doing are you there
[54:32] but those that were crying did not know
[54:35] and because God blinded them God is
[54:40] under obligation to serve them and
[54:44] tattoos came after death resurrection of
[54:49] Jesus trust that's when Titus came are
[54:52] you there so after the cross when those
[54:55] people died Israel was scattered all
[54:59] over the world then God took those Souls
[55:04] and place them under the facility that's
[55:09] why when they are there they are crying
[55:11] for ventures they say when are you gonna
[55:14] revenge us brother branham said a bride
[55:17] does not cry for vengeance
[55:20] that is not bride material brought when
[55:24] they were killing Stephen he repeated
[55:27] what Jesus Christ said he said forgive
[55:29] them because they don't know are you
[55:32] there but those who are killed Brandon
[55:35] so according to the law eye for eye
[55:39] tooth for tooth that's why whenever was
[55:43] killed
[55:43] what was the blood of Abel crying for
[55:47] revenge that one came he said the blood
[55:50] of Jesus Christ speak fakes other than
[55:54] the blood of Lu because a girl is crying
[55:57] for
[55:58] just are we clear so far
[56:01] you understand that clear so far then
[56:04] when Israel was scattered toward the
[56:07] earth God one in Israel to come back
[56:11] again to the promised land
[56:13] but when the Jewish went in German in
[56:17] Europe in in America the Jews began to
[56:21] prosper under the blessing of Abraham so
[56:26] the robber came they told them hey you
[56:29] guys need to go back to the promised
[56:31] land they refused are there then Jesus
[56:35] prophesied they prophesied in the Old
[56:38] Testament they say I'm gonna send you
[56:40] first fisherman if you need a scripture
[56:43] you see me if you don't listen to the
[56:47] fishermen I'm gonna send you hunters are
[56:52] there when they robot talk to them to go
[56:55] back they refused God turn around and
[56:58] send hunters and open again the six year
[57:04] that's why brother branham say every
[57:07] trumpet sounded under there six years
[57:11] now if you look at the feast of the
[57:14] trumpet I know it's troubling ordinal if
[57:17] you look under the feast of the trumpet
[57:21] in Leviticus 23 that feast sounded at
[57:25] the beginning of the seventh month are
[57:30] you there when the Jewish were scattered
[57:33] he was the first Church ages the second
[57:37] Church ages
[57:37] nothing was done in Israel was
[57:40] completely disappear as a nation the
[57:43] torture changes Israel doesn't exist
[57:46] the fourth one does not exist the fifth
[57:49] one does not exist the sixth one does
[57:53] not exist their servant church ages when
[57:57] we start in 1906 few years later on for
[58:03] some reason if you study it looks almost
[58:07] like it's stupid
[58:09] for the word the first world war broke
[58:14] they kill someone this nation Ganon and
[58:19] Francis said because this getting are
[58:22] getting Germany said because France
[58:24] getting are getting England said because
[58:26] France and Germany garden a garden
[58:28] before you know the whole world is it
[58:32] all why is the world
[58:34] modern event are made clear by because
[58:38] at the beginning of the seventh the
[58:42] trumpet must blow in order to bring
[58:46] Israel back again to the promised land
[58:50] but Israel was under occupation so when
[58:54] those trumpet begin to blow the first
[58:58] liberated the land of Jerusalem from the
[59:02] hand of the Arab but the Jewish were
[59:05] still al-assad God say there is no
[59:08] problem they open again the 6-year idea
[59:12] then it lurk him
[59:14] Mussolini him Eichmann came and the rose
[59:18] with a hatred against the Jews that
[59:22] comes from Hell they begin to kill the
[59:26] Jewish people and if you study the sixth
[59:29] Robert you will find out that they were
[59:31] demon that came out from the river
[59:34] Euphrates and those demons were killing
[59:37] by three things in the Bible do you
[59:40] wanna feel it oh you good you good you
[59:44] want to read it
[59:46] let's go to the book of Revelation I
[59:48] didn't even plan on this
[59:59] I told you to deep water the book of
[1:00:06] Revelation sorry let me get my scripture
[1:00:11] quickly where the trumpet are sounding
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:16] let's go to Revelation chapter 9 if you
[1:00:26] dare you can say Amen
[1:00:34] I'm trying to find the sixth trumpet now
[1:00:39] okay
[1:00:40] yes 13 and the sixth angel sounded and I
[1:00:46] heard a voice from the four horns of the
[1:00:48] golden altar you see her altar
[1:00:50] okay which is before God saying to the
[1:00:54] sixth angel which had the trumpet loose
[1:00:58] lose the word remember those angels four
[1:01:03] angels which are bound in the great
[1:01:06] river Euphrates they are four angels
[1:01:09] remember those four angels don't forget
[1:01:12] them and the four injure were loosed
[1:01:14] which were prepared for an hour and a
[1:01:18] day and a mountain a year for to slay
[1:01:20] the third part of what men and the
[1:01:24] number of the army of the horsemen were
[1:01:27] two hundred thousand thousand in other
[1:01:31] words two hundred million two hundred
[1:01:34] thousand and I heard the number of them
[1:01:36] and thus I saw the horse in the vision
[1:01:40] and them that sat on them having breast
[1:01:44] fed of fire and of jacinth and brimstone
[1:01:48] and the heads of the horse were as the
[1:01:51] head of lions and out of their mouths
[1:01:54] issued and what and what brother Robert
[1:02:00] I hope you day fire smoke and what okay
[1:02:13] let's go to verse 19 for their power is
[1:02:17] in their mouth and in their tail but
[1:02:20] when I'm explained that these are not
[1:02:22] natural horses they were women it's in
[1:02:26] the fist of the trumpet but when I'm
[1:02:27] said they were a demon
[1:02:29] are you dead and these three and by
[1:02:33] these three is it okay
[1:02:38] verse 18 by these three was the third
[1:02:42] part of men killed by Haman
[1:02:44] three by what the fire everybody there
[1:02:50] on the aboard and by what smoke
[1:02:53] everybody see the board and by what
[1:02:57] princedom which is what issue out of
[1:03:02] them if you look at the brimstone
[1:03:05] it means suffer check your Bible it is a
[1:03:11] gas are either and for some reason when
[1:03:16] Adolf Hitler came when he was killing
[1:03:20] the Jewish people they found him opening
[1:03:25] the gas chambers Ida and he began to
[1:03:30] kill the Jews by gas chamber he was not
[1:03:33] an accident
[1:03:37] he was not something that happened just
[1:03:39] as an imagination
[1:03:41] he was prophecy moving it was an
[1:03:45] anointing from hell
[1:03:46] he's telling them to kill the Jewish by
[1:03:50] Gaza everybody and they also killed the
[1:03:55] Jewish by burning them to emotion fire
[1:04:01] everybody
[1:04:02] what is even say ok and they also killed
[1:04:07] the Jewish by what they were shooting
[1:04:10] the Jewish people and the shoot that
[1:04:13] should when the shoot were comes out are
[1:04:22] we clear
[1:04:22] so when the trumpet sounded this demon
[1:04:27] came anointed Hitler and it rapidly to
[1:04:31] shoot they should they should the attire
[1:04:35] they begin to burn burn burn they get
[1:04:38] higher they begin to make gas chamber
[1:04:40] and they kill they kill millions of Jews
[1:04:43] he was the 6th trumpet that was sounding
[1:04:47] telling Israel go back go back to the
[1:04:51] promised land Israel was killed because
[1:04:55] he was fear
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:00] everybody are we there so this song here
[1:05:05] does not because they rejected Jesus
[1:05:09] Christ they died because they were what
[1:05:12] Jewish people so their first died under
[1:05:16] Titus within the second angle it work
[1:05:22] that's why brother Branham say both from
[1:05:25] terrace and both from Ziggler come under
[1:05:28] the fifth seal under the altar they
[1:05:32] cannot give them robbed because they
[1:05:35] didn't have the Holy Ghost either they
[1:05:39] have to wait until their brother but
[1:05:45] they be killed but those Bradley that's
[1:05:48] going to be killed
[1:05:49] are the hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:05:53] which going to receive them are we clear
[1:05:57] in the Old Testament people die Adam
[1:06:00] died Moses died died died died when
[1:06:04] classical trance receive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] and Christ brought the resurrection of
[1:06:12] everybody else we clear
[1:06:15] then when Paul came down erroneous died
[1:06:18] Martin de Columba died looted - Wesley
[1:06:23] de but in this time according to the
[1:06:26] King chamber they must be open to a
[1:06:29] message for the way through a channel
[1:06:32] but would I impede the portion of the
[1:06:39] region of under the altar but the Jewish
[1:06:44] soul that were killed by terrorists are
[1:06:48] still there because we don't have a
[1:06:50] connection with them because they were
[1:06:52] still under the law of Moses and also
[1:06:56] the Jewish that were true that were
[1:06:58] killed under Italy were still under the
[1:07:01] altar so they needed a message that's
[1:07:05] going to bring the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:07:08] and the opening of the
[1:07:10] some time to bring the resurrection
[1:07:15] are we there then the resurrection will
[1:07:19] pull the Jews from goddess the Jews from
[1:07:23] Hitler and take them all also -
[1:07:28] everybody got that clear now when he
[1:07:32] opened the sixth we know that the city
[1:07:35] is a judgment field but the seventh year
[1:07:39] when we open there is nothing
[1:07:44] everybody clear now all these things
[1:07:48] have three purpose the first seal was
[1:07:55] the white horse rather which was the
[1:07:57] Antichrist everybody there the
[1:08:00] Antichrist was a demonic spirit
[1:08:03] everybody clear he was a white horse
[1:08:06] rather the second fear was the art
[1:08:10] across that got into the politics church
[1:08:15] said mixed together you need to read
[1:08:18] your message political power everybody
[1:08:22] then the Antichrist change to the black
[1:08:25] horse which he get into religion demonic
[1:08:32] power political power religious power
[1:08:37] three of them here then the fourth see
[1:08:42] when he open it was the parish rather
[1:08:45] and the pair brother branham say if you
[1:08:48] take the color white you mix it with red
[1:08:52] you mix it with what black he gives you
[1:08:56] what to repurpose to economics right
[1:09:01] here and draw the bottom say the
[1:09:03] parallels rather who is today is worth
[1:09:07] working in politics in religion and
[1:09:11] demonic power earlier and we just found
[1:09:15] out that under the fifth still there is
[1:09:19] also three color people those that were
[1:09:22] killed by others
[1:09:24] everybody clear those that were killed
[1:09:27] by Italy Mussolini and others under the
[1:09:32] Second World War
[1:09:33] are you there and the third one would be
[1:09:36] does that's going to be killed under
[1:09:39] Moses and Elijah which is the hundred
[1:09:42] and forty-four and when we were in
[1:09:46] Living Word Tabernacle we found out that
[1:09:49] the Seventh Seal has how many purpose
[1:09:54] three of them the seven thunders if you
[1:09:58] need caught you see me the third pool if
[1:10:04] you need coal to see me and they're
[1:10:06] coming off the Lord
[1:10:08] this is what brother bottom keep saying
[1:10:10] the Seventh Seal is not open because
[1:10:12] it's not coming off the road it will
[1:10:15] break the scripture are we there but if
[1:10:18] this is three
[1:10:20] destroy destroy destroy this also must
[1:10:25] be where do you get this stuff brother
[1:10:30] Stephen the Seventh Seal now I want you
[1:10:38] to notice tonight that in the seat sir
[1:10:41] there was worth everybody clear
[1:10:46] to be for purpose of the six here there
[1:10:50] was a three-fold purpose of them I just
[1:10:53] show it to you we clear there is been
[1:10:57] three for purpose in word three three
[1:11:03] three three
[1:11:07] we're trying to see three everybody
[1:11:11] there that bring us back to a three and
[1:11:14] a seven again seventh year seven
[1:11:17] thousand so forth now in threes and
[1:11:21] seven seven zero three purpose three
[1:11:26] purpose three purple increase and
[1:11:28] seventh is God's numbered in his love
[1:11:32] Mladic's
[1:11:33] of a villain
[1:11:36] 7:03 purpose 3 purpose 3 purpose 3
[1:11:41] purpose repurposed revelation everybody
[1:11:44] there okay
[1:11:46] now you notice they rather not there was
[1:11:49] that three horse went out one of them
[1:11:52] was white one was red one was black and
[1:11:56] then in the fourth Y all them were
[1:12:01] preferred we see the six owner brother
[1:12:05] branham the Seventh Seal
[1:12:08] that's the six healed now being open he
[1:12:11] was out for a three-fold purpose now
[1:12:17] here was the purposes brother branham
[1:12:21] himself is going to say paragraph 388
[1:12:25] the first thing was that the sleeping
[1:12:28] foolish virgin the foolish virgin had to
[1:12:33] go to the for what the Jewish who
[1:12:38] rejected Jesus Christ will open up the
[1:12:42] sixth seal open tribulation the gentle
[1:12:46] foolish virgin they will stand virgin
[1:12:48] some who have oil which is the blood we
[1:12:51] have the Holy Spirit and some who have
[1:12:53] all because those don't have all
[1:12:56] rejected what happened but if they kill
[1:13:00] them they must be safe because it's a
[1:13:05] purging self-id tribulation period for
[1:13:11] what she had to be purged of her sins of
[1:13:16] ambulance and rejecting them no problem
[1:13:24] but it's the church the pure people that
[1:13:29] didn't have the opportunity so it's a
[1:13:32] deadly thing when you open your eyes to
[1:13:36] the message and you rejected
[1:13:40] it's better for you to be branded I
[1:13:46] didn't because per say once you are
[1:13:49] enlightened and you ejected there is no
[1:13:54] more sacrifice for that word but the
[1:13:58] Pharisee to hell so if you are in the
[1:14:05] message get serious either you cannot be
[1:14:12] in the message and rejected
[1:14:18] but it's the church the pure people that
[1:14:22] didn't have the opportunity maybe to
[1:14:24] receive them or some way that they were
[1:14:29] by these false Matthew 24:24 and they
[1:14:33] didn't get here they were blended under
[1:14:37] the denomination are you there God put
[1:14:40] them on the world because their pastor
[1:14:43] said brother Branham is a false prophet
[1:14:47] but the leader the Pharisee the scrub W
[1:14:53] that brother Branham was a true prophet
[1:14:56] and rejected them no more they didn't
[1:15:03] get a chance and yet they are really
[1:15:06] sincere in the heart and God knows their
[1:15:11] if I knew I would not reject it I did it
[1:15:15] because the Pharisee told us anybody
[1:15:18] that will go there we gonna chase him
[1:15:20] away from the synagogue and then when
[1:15:23] they ask the parent how was your son
[1:15:25] he'll we don't know ask him the Bible
[1:15:27] said they didn't wanna answer because
[1:15:30] they were afraid of death

[1:17:58] third Pole and it will bring the coming
[1:18:00] of there

[1:18:10] child what is the seven silly the
[1:18:12] message he don't know in the message the
[1:18:18] 17 here with you are six years but don't
[1:18:24] say nothing about there we try to find
[1:18:27] out its cause and the anthem what is the
[1:18:33] intention when so we have to finish
[1:18:42] someone when we start will be absolutely
[1:18:48] the total secret according to the before
[1:18:56] knowing that than what before knowing
[1:19:02] the severe weather later if you want to
[1:19:05] know the servants fear remember
[1:19:10] revelation is the complicated before you
[1:19:20] know the seventh seal we fell remember
[1:19:24] revelation 10 want to at the end of the
[1:19:29] seventh angel message order of God will
[1:19:35] be we are in the day opening of the
[1:19:40] servant if you wanna know the seven zero
[1:19:49] remember addressing there will be a
[1:19:53] messenger work on the messenger
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:03] question and answer on the word now we
[1:20:07] come back with the seals and open the
[1:20:10] seal God open the field
[1:20:16] did brother branham fabricated God
[1:20:21] opened that seal for us what is that
[1:20:25] first remember before you know it first
[1:20:29] the reason he repeated back again there
[1:20:33] is a messenger Church ages next is what
[1:20:37] so the messenger must come before the
[1:20:41] seventh year of foam now we found out
[1:20:45] the column the corruption they hit their
[1:20:50] seventh church ages but the seventh seal
[1:20:55] does not reveal what is going to happen
[1:21:00] to it because why the seventh seal does
[1:21:05] not reveal anything before you know it
[1:21:07] you need a messenger why it doesn't
[1:21:10] reveal that brother branham because at
[1:21:14] the end of the church age we change is
[1:21:20] come here to reveal is it complicated my
[1:21:27] friend firstly thanks the book of this
[1:21:36] year and break them and sure there is it
[1:21:41] complicated is he contradicting himself
[1:21:44] for this not to people this alone the
[1:21:52] mystery of God is the Ministry of the
[1:21:57] servants
[1:21:59] what is the Ministry of brotherbrother
[1:22:01] revealing the seventh seal which is the
[1:22:05] message of the end time now we just come
[1:22:11] through their church ages with
[1:22:14] history improved on the angels message
[1:22:17] of the servant church all right we fear
[1:22:21] all the mysteries that has been in the
[1:22:23] past all this fits in there
[1:22:26] so my point I'm trying to drive here it
[1:22:29] is the opening of the seventh year
[1:22:32] require a profit everybody's clear now
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:42] Fasil Antichrist second ant across third
[1:22:46] ant across fourth Antiqua fifth we just
[1:22:50] talked about your souls under the author
[1:22:52] but that's it the second one you need
[1:22:58] now if this still need the profit what
[1:23:02] about the six selves I'm going to get to
[1:23:04] Malachi for are you there the six here
[1:23:09] what is it what can bring these things
[1:23:12] but the word they can do nature any way
[1:23:16] they want to
[1:23:17] we know those people right Moses and
[1:23:20] Elijah we're going to get today here it
[1:23:22] is they are the one who bring on this
[1:23:30] day our cover and what because Zachariah
[1:23:36] said there will be a fountain water
[1:23:40] there will be a seal for the church ages
[1:23:44] that will be water but you know the
[1:23:46] opening of the Seventh Seal Unida in
[1:23:50] Israel there will be a sultan but that
[1:23:53] fountain will be opened by who they are
[1:24:01] covered and open it up it's the power of
[1:24:05] who opened the Seventh Seal to interrupt
[1:24:11] word six here
[1:24:17] the sixth cell is completely a natural
[1:24:20] son of nature do you get it now there is
[1:24:24] yourself who does it it's
[1:24:29] the other side of the in other word not
[1:24:33] as the Jewish people with the power of
[1:24:37] God the Word of God they just condemn
[1:24:40] nature they can send earthquake turn the
[1:24:43] moon into blood the Sun can go down or
[1:24:45] anything and their command now here is
[1:24:48] these two prophets standing here with
[1:24:51] the Word of God to do anything to nature
[1:24:54] they want to and they shake the earth
[1:24:56] and it shows exactly who does it it who
[1:24:59] Moses and Elijah because there is their
[1:25:02] ministry we in person we impersonated
[1:25:06] again it's Byfuglien see what is the six
[1:25:09] series it is does don't let me chop you
[1:25:14] but what will happen that seal what is
[1:25:18] telling you look at me the seventh seal
[1:25:22] was opened by who look at the other one
[1:25:25] who open it again because the sex the
[1:25:29] because the seventh seal to the Jewish
[1:25:32] people is water the seventh trumpet if
[1:25:35] the servants who was opened by a prophet
[1:25:38] who is going to open the seventh trumpet
[1:25:40] it's gonna be wool but those prophet
[1:25:46] Moses M praise God we are living in the
[1:25:53] early age brother heads up to among the
[1:25:56] crowd they opened the sixth seal they
[1:25:58] have power to do it amen there is your
[1:26:00] sixth coming open
[1:26:02] very badly under in the Old Testament
[1:26:04] but in what we're going to get there but
[1:26:08] in the old brother branham is saying
[1:26:10] that Ezekiel is talking about who where
[1:26:15] does is it you're talking about Moses
[1:26:17] and Elijah brother branham lied
[1:26:21] let's get today the six he'll open and
[1:26:25] they say well that's a mysterious thing
[1:26:27] what did it here is the secret of it's
[1:26:31] worth when the seventh seal open he was
[1:26:34] a total secret why because you need the
[1:26:39] secret of the six series profit profit
[1:26:42] because the Bible says so they can open
[1:26:45] it up anytime they can do to nature all
[1:26:48] that they want I'm going to repeat this
[1:26:51] code then we get in their gospel is
[1:26:53] ready to go back to the Jews oh if I
[1:26:56] could just tell you something that is
[1:26:58] about to happen right in this hour day
[1:27:01] this red thing that is about to happen
[1:27:04] will carry over the seventh seal will
[1:27:08] carry over to revelation 11 and pick up
[1:27:11] those the seventh trumpet these two
[1:27:15] prophet Moses and Elijah turning the
[1:27:18] gospel back to the earth are we clear
[1:27:20] now okay now let's get to our stuff we
[1:27:24] found out that we are Testament started
[1:27:27] with Moses you already got it
[1:27:29] then at the end we know that Moses
[1:27:32] prophesy about Jesus Christ and then he
[1:27:35] prophesied about Israel drifting from
[1:27:38] the faith then we saw Elijah here as our
[1:27:41] reference if you wanna know Elijah this
[1:27:44] is a reference are you there then we
[1:27:47] talked about Paul last Sunday and Paul
[1:27:50] was our Morgan Moses you remember that
[1:27:54] and but at the end of Paul Paul also
[1:27:57] prophesy about the coming of Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ and Paul also prophesy about what
[1:28:03] I'm going quickly
[1:28:05] Paul prophesy about the coming of Jesus
[1:28:08] Christ and power also professor about
[1:28:11] the church who's going to depart from
[1:28:15] their faith
[1:28:16] he called her hell there Moses called
[1:28:19] their elders now before we get to
[1:28:23] Malachi for I was going through the seal
[1:28:25] because you need the seal to unlock this
[1:28:28] one over there now we found in the Bible
[1:28:33] in Luke chapter 9 Moses and Elijah
[1:28:37] appeared talking to Jesus Christ at
[1:28:42] their coronation their crowning the
[1:28:46] adoption of Jesus Christ no
[1:28:50] he was present from heaven except Moses
[1:28:53] and who what were they talking about who
[1:28:57] is Jesus Luke chapter 9 verse 30 let's
[1:29:03] go now now I'm going to solve like an
[1:29:07] ego if you have a problem understanding
[1:29:12] the Jewish based foundation you go home
[1:29:15] go read Romans chapter 11 if I touch
[1:29:18] that here I won't be able to even touch
[1:29:22] something here

[1:29:26] Sunday School then I can fill it up you
[1:29:29] there okay Luke chapter 9 verse 30 let's
[1:29:33] go to verse 22 the Son of Man must water
[1:29:40] must what which seal speaks about the
[1:29:44] suffering everybody clear

[1:30:10] talk to who everybody clear the elder
[1:30:14] and the chief priest endure these are
[1:30:17] the one that did iniquity they knew but
[1:30:22] they rejected are you there and be what
[1:30:25] and be worse debtor day and he said to
[1:30:30] them if any man will come to me let him
[1:30:33] deny himself and take up what first of
[1:30:37] all let me ask you a question was Jesus
[1:30:39] dead did Jesus go at the cross how is he

[1:30:51] about it he was not crucified why he's
[1:30:56] telling us if anybody want to follow him
[1:30:58] you must carry you he himself has not
[1:31:02] carried
[1:31:04] and the opening of the seventh year the
[1:31:08] barber became a if you have difficulty
[1:31:15] in the Bible just get the seals and put
[1:31:17] it in you will see how the seals open

[1:32:48] of his disease what kinda disease this
[1:32:52] is which he should accomplish at work on
[1:32:58] the death Jesus had to accomplish it
[1:33:00] Jerusalem are we clear
[1:33:05] when the jewels see him they're gonna
[1:33:08] see who they have
[1:33:10] yes you remember our reading what Jesus
[1:33:18] spoke about the cross Moses and Elijah
[1:33:20] came and talked to him about the cross
[1:33:27] everybody there so why are these guys
[1:33:30] talking about the cross why are they
[1:33:34] talking about the cross let's go to
[1:33:36] Matthew chapter 20 at this point you're
[1:33:41] gonna need your Bible Matthew chapter 20
[1:33:44] verse 18 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:33:50] the cross was not a good thing he was a
[1:33:54] painful thing he was a humiliating thing
[1:34:00] Jesus humbled himself even to the death
[1:34:05] of there are you gay when he looked at
[1:34:11] the joy that was behind Hebrew he and/or
[1:34:15] the cross it's written in the Bible
[1:34:19] either the cross was not easy are either
[1:34:23] mark chapter 20 verse 18 the Bible said
[1:34:27] that we all do who's talking Jesus we go
[1:34:30] up to Jerusalem and the Son of man shall
[1:34:33] be betrayed to the chief priests and to
[1:34:37] the scrub and they shall condemn him to
[1:34:40] death and shall deliver him to the
[1:34:42] gentle to mock and to scourge and to
[1:34:45] crucify cross cross cross
[1:34:48] crucify him and the third day he shall
[1:34:51] rise again everybody there so far verse
[1:34:57] 20 then came to him the mother of
[1:35:02] Zebedee's children with her sons worship
[1:35:05] Him and desired certain things of him
[1:35:07] and he said to her what will you she

[1:35:23] you know not what you asked are you able
[1:35:27] to drink after that I shall drink future
[1:35:34] disclose Jesus called that the cup
[1:35:42] because in Gethsemane when they give him
[1:35:45] the full vision Jesus say father if it's
[1:35:50] possible take away what and that's the
[1:35:58] subject Moses and Elijah brought to him
[1:36:05] are you there and are you able to drink
[1:36:10] the cup that are doing and to be what
[1:36:13] with the Baptist's Miami if you notice
[1:36:17] the baptism he say I am look at your
[1:36:21] Bible shall he was in the future but the
[1:36:27] baptism he said the baptism that I am he
[1:36:31] was already baptized with the Holy
[1:36:33] Spirit in the river of Jordan but he was
[1:36:37] not dead yet that's what he said listen
[1:36:41] man you are asking me for something are
[1:36:44] you ready to drink the cup that I shall
[1:36:48] drink and the baptismal are I am there
[1:36:52] is a cup and there is also a baptism the
[1:36:56] Baptist means the word in the river of
[1:37:01] Jordan everybody there what are we
[1:37:04] talking about here he said can you drink
[1:37:13] the cup that I drink can you be baptized
[1:37:17] with the baptism I am baptized with the
[1:37:21] same water everybody clear the same Holy
[1:37:26] Spirit was upon him without okay Jesus
[1:37:32] asked a question
[1:37:37] take verse 23 so you can understand this
[1:37:39] better and he says and they say to him
[1:37:44] we are able right that's the answer when
[1:37:47] they say are you ready to do this they
[1:37:50] say we are able that was verse 22 verse
[1:37:53] 23 and he says to them who saying now
[1:37:57] Jesus is confirming them you shall drink
[1:38:01] indeed of Maca
[1:38:03] so anybody can drink of this camera and
[1:38:07] be baptized with the baptism I am I am
[1:38:12] baptized with everybody but to sit on my
[1:38:17] right hand and on my left it is not mine
[1:38:21] to give but it shall be given to them to
[1:38:23] whom evil spirit Uma as far as position
[1:38:26] that we destination but as far as
[1:38:29] suffering and the baptism everybody can
[1:38:33] take it over there okay but one cross he
[1:38:38] himself took the baptism his baptism was
[1:38:44] without measure
[1:38:49] everybody did
[1:38:51] he said we can do we can take the cup
[1:38:55] and we can also take the baptism either
[1:39:00] so if in your life you are going to
[1:39:04] suffering either you need to remind
[1:39:09] Jesus and tell him if you can fulfill
[1:39:14] the suffering in my life you must
[1:39:18] fulfill the Holy Ghost in my life I
[1:39:27] cannot suffer and you don't give me the
[1:39:30] Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] either because you say if we partake of
[1:39:36] this we can also take this one young
[1:39:40] people you need to know how to touch God
[1:39:47] are you there and get him at his word
[1:39:50] brother branham can you drink he said

[1:39:58] without come upon his church by with us
[1:40:09] by measure with him without measure come
[1:40:18] upon his church by measure but it's the
[1:40:21] same the same God God gave him the
[1:40:26] spirit with God in other word the
[1:40:30] fullness of the baptism of the holy
[1:40:33] spirit was in Christ you got me the
[1:40:39] fullness of your suffering goes to crush
[1:40:44] them you with me
[1:40:48] the fullness either but one class deal
[1:40:53] with you he gives you the spirit in
[1:40:57] measure God gave him the spirit without

[1:41:10] son this is the Holy Ghost in brother
[1:41:12] Branham on life okay he mention me out a
[1:41:18] spoonful but when he measured his son he
[1:41:23] measured the whole ocean see what I mean
[1:41:26] the same chemical that is in this spoon
[1:41:29] is in the ocean and all the chemical in
[1:41:32] the ocean is a measure of them in this
[1:41:36] spoon it's the same kind I shall do the
[1:41:39] same thing the same word is a produce
[1:41:43] the same that do you really don't you
[1:41:46] believe that that's what make us crystal
[1:41:52] their work the work that I do yuusha if
[1:42:02] he give us the spirit in measure he gets
[1:42:07] the spirit without measure he get the
[1:42:12] suffering with a measure is he going to
[1:42:14] give us the full suffering he may commit
[1:42:22] you to death as he did Paul he may
[1:42:26] commit you to suffering as he did job
[1:42:28] that is his prerogative he's sovereign
[1:42:31] but it's all with a purpose if he did
[1:42:36] not have a purpose then he will be the
[1:42:38] author of frustration and not of peace
[1:42:40] his purpose is that after we suffer your
[1:42:46] sick self while we will be made perfect
[1:42:51] be established strengthen and shadow you
[1:42:56] see he himself suffered he learned
[1:42:59] obedience by defense that he suffered
[1:43:02] that was Jesus Christ he was actually
[1:43:03] made profit by the things that he in
[1:43:06] plain language the very character of
[1:43:10] Jesus was perfected by by suffering and
[1:43:14] according to Paul he left his church ere
[1:43:17] a measure of what that day to buy their
[1:43:31] faith in God was suffering for him will
[1:43:35] come in the place off so even God Jesus
[1:43:39] Christ says that you will drink of his
[1:43:42] cup you now gonna go in the fullness of
[1:43:46] suffering God will give you all me
[1:43:50] nature according to your strengths
[1:43:53] because Paul say you cannot be tempted
[1:43:57] above what you can bear both your
[1:44:02] measure he is a father he knows that
[1:44:05] this one needs level 3 this one needs
[1:44:08] never fall this one need level sees he
[1:44:11] will give you a cording to your measure
[1:44:13] but it will be gasps you are ready the
[1:44:17] suffering if you already suffer in your
[1:44:19] life it is time spoken with Abednego for
[1:44:23] you to turn around you say there is a
[1:44:26] duel there is a 2-fold to this you told
[1:44:29] me if I suffer you also going to give me
[1:44:32] the Holy Ghost you made me suffer now
[1:44:34] it's time for the Holy Ghost everybody
[1:44:44] what a Branham what is this kappa what a
[1:44:47] john this is a different gear alrighty
[1:44:51] one time a young woman came up to Jesus
[1:44:54] and say Lord let one of my sons set one
[1:44:57] on the side and they had on the right
[1:44:59] hand and the one on the left hand when
[1:45:02] you come into your kingdom
[1:45:03] why he said can you drink the does a
[1:45:10] drink cup lynch word trans a Christian
[1:45:18] be the drug death can you drink the cup
[1:45:23] that I drink that is bitter persecution
[1:45:28] that's why we go to persecution sometime
[1:45:31] are you there but we not going to get
[1:45:34] the fullness either now he say so he
[1:45:40] sure is sure that we could drink the
[1:45:44] same cup of what be called be eligible
[1:45:49] and whatever it might be and still be
[1:45:52] baptized with the same spirit he is
[1:45:56] baptized with so if he was called
[1:45:59] Messiah because he was anointed with the
[1:46:02] holy
[1:46:03] and any church that is anointed with the
[1:46:05] same spirit is what it's a lesser leader
[1:46:10] smaller God that what Jesus said the
[1:46:15] natural world of your Lord called those
[1:46:17] who to the Word of God can God tell the
[1:46:22] devil I'm God and someday when this body
[1:46:27] is resurrected
[1:46:29] I hope beforehand that God can get a
[1:46:33] hold of a bunch of people that shall
[1:46:36] manifest his in the Sun every dimension
[1:46:44] that is suppose oh my god take Luke
[1:46:51] chapter 12 we are navigating Luke
[1:46:58] chapter 12 verse 50 are you there
[1:47:06] everybody there we talking about this
[1:47:10] cup and this cross okay verse 50 but I
[1:47:16] who's talking Jesus but I have to be I
[1:47:25] thought Jesus was already baptized in
[1:47:28] Jordan he told us the Baptist letter who
[1:47:31] that I am baptized but now he's talking
[1:47:34] a different what is this baptism I have
[1:47:39] a baptism to be the future okay to be
[1:47:44] baptized with and how I am I am joyful
[1:47:50] is that what he say brother Robert how I
[1:47:54] am distressed till it be what
[1:47:58] so this cup Jesus called that also a
[1:48:04] baptism
[1:48:08] are you there but this is a baptism of
[1:48:12] suffering are you
[1:48:16] and because jesus knew he had to suffer
[1:48:20] he was always under tension I just read
[1:48:26] the scripture I am distressed because I
[1:48:30] know something is coming when the hour
[1:48:33] came and the father told him this system
[1:48:37] he said father is there any possibility
[1:48:40] you can Jesus understand our suffering
[1:48:44] we are mean to people but he understood
[1:48:51] Jesus even pray to do it you know a
[1:48:56] Dutchman they should something so when
[1:49:02] God should the vision he almost did he
[1:49:10] understand the high priest that can be
[1:49:14] by the feeling of your he knows your
[1:49:17] suffering he himself was about to Jesus
[1:49:25] even tried to dodge what here the cup
[1:49:31] the baptism the cross is it easy is it
[1:49:37] possible that the cup the cup should
[1:49:41] pass nevertheless not life but then
[1:49:46] Moses and Elijah came to talk to him
[1:49:48] about but but who opened the sixth seal
[1:49:59] who opened the six year Moses Anna and
[1:50:03] the sixth is a painful sir it is a sill
[1:50:09] of tribulation
[1:50:10] it is a sill of suffering it is a cell
[1:50:14] of persecution

[1:57:27] Noah when the flood came
[1:57:29] then the earth moved from its orbit

[1:59:38] Oh Malachi for applied to the Jews
[1:59:40] Malachi for applied to the Jews that's
[1:59:42] why I'm cleaning this up the Elijah that
[1:59:47] goes to the Jews his reference is in
[1:59:50] Zechariah not Malachi okay when they
[1:59:55] tell you Malachi 4 applied to the Jews
[1:59:57] no no the Elijah that goes to Israel his
[2:00:00] reference is in zechariah zechariah
[2:00:04] chapter 4 everybody did

[2:00:15] the angel that talked to me
[2:00:17] come again and wake me a part of wake me
[2:00:20] up as a man that is awakened out of
[2:00:22] stupid sleep and said to me what do you

[2:09:24] and he answered and said to him o man of
[2:09:26] God thou has the King say come down

[2:09:43] from heaven and consumed him and he's
[2:09:46] number one who spoke and the fire came
[2:09:49] down we're trying to find out if brother
[2:09:52] Branham lied I'm sorry if I say that
[2:09:58] like that take Luke chapter
[2:10:04] I'm going this way so whenever they show
[2:10:07] you something even if you don't
[2:10:09] understand leave it alone
[2:10:12] just take it believe it and go forward
[2:10:15] God will give you the revelation later
[2:10:17] they give you a coat you look at the
[2:10:20] coat you say Amen the interpretation you
[2:10:23] can argue with me but the coat they take
[2:10:26] leave it alone verse nine chapter nine
[2:10:32] are you there
[2:10:33] verse 52 everybody there okay verse 52
[2:10:40] and send message before his face this is
[2:10:44] Jesus and they went and enter into the
[2:10:47] village of Samaritan to make ready for
[2:10:49] him and they did not receive him Jesus
[2:10:52] sent messenger to the village of
[2:10:54] Samaritan to prepare him so he can come
[2:10:57] when they prepare him the Samaritan said
[2:10:59] no we don't want Jesus here no go
[2:11:02] we don't want Jesus here okay that's
[2:11:05] just a background and they did not
[2:11:07] receive him because his face was as
[2:11:09] though he would go to Jerusalem and when
[2:11:12] his disciple who James and John saw this
[2:11:16] they say Lord will you that we command
[2:11:22] what please speak with me so the people
[2:11:26] on the camera will understand you
[2:11:29] command what fire to come down from and
[2:11:33] consume them even answer who speak and
[2:11:42] fire come down oh my god no problem

[2:13:46] stop the heaven from now reigning take
[2:13:52] look chapter 4 you might have to go
[2:14:02] sermon and to review it not because it's
[2:14:06] me who preached it but because of the
[2:14:09] material we put there for you to be
[2:14:13] fortified your fortification is behind
[2:14:16] the world Luke chapter 4 verse 25 if you
[2:14:20] dare you can say Amen only few people if
[2:14:27] you dare you can say Amen deliver the
[2:14:30] devadatta say Amen
[2:14:31] ok first 25 right and I tell you of
[2:14:36] truth that's Jesus speaking maybe we
[2:14:40] don't were in Israel in the days of
[2:14:43] everybody clear
[2:14:44] Elijah when their heaven was for what
[2:14:50] and stop can you raise and look at me
[2:14:54] here the witness in revelation 11
[2:15:00] prophesy for how long did you seat and
[2:15:06] Jesus say Elijah shut up the heaven fall
[2:15:12] are we clear ok let's go but maybe we
[2:15:19] don't were in the days of Elijah when
[2:15:21] they have been well shut for two years
[2:15:23] and six months when great famine was to
[2:15:26] out there who stopped the rain again
[2:15:32] let's go to James chapter 5 I'm sorry
[2:15:40] you gotta bear with me these are the
[2:15:47] stuff that we heard but we never put a
[2:15:50] sermon together to stabilize someone and
[2:15:54] when they bring you something brother
[2:15:56] Branham totala I leave the message to
[2:15:58] more you in short to paint a to
[2:16:00] understand James chapter 5 verse 17 are
[2:16:06] you there are you there who Elijah was a
[2:16:12] man subject to like passions
[2:16:16] we are and he pray earnestly that he
[2:16:18] might not everybody clear rain and he
[2:16:24] ran not on the earth by the space of
[2:16:26] work and what do you see this again the
[2:16:34] prophesy for three years and let's go
[2:16:39] back now to revelation 11 we were in
[2:16:44] verse 6 we're trying to find out why he
[2:16:47] brought a man and say if Elijah I am vs.
[2:16:52] 3 6 these have power to shut heaven that
[2:16:55] it rain not in the days of their
[2:16:57] prophecy and he'll power over the
[2:16:59] warders return them to would run water
[2:17:05] into blood is he difficult to save time
[2:17:14] write this down Exodus 7 verse 17 and 20
[2:17:19] and go clarify it yourself are you there
[2:17:24] okay you write down yourself who turned
[2:17:27] water into blood
[2:17:30] that's why brother Branham say it is not
[2:17:33] anak the works here is not the works of
[2:17:37] Enoch brother Branham said if they give
[2:17:40] you the spirit of Beethoven you will
[2:17:42] play music because birth oven was a
[2:17:45] musician are you there
[2:17:50] I have power over the world to turn them
[2:17:53] to blood and to smite the earth with
[2:17:56] older who are sliding Egypt to spread if
[2:18:03] you need a scripture Exodus chapter 8
[2:18:06] Exodus chapter 9 Exodus chapter 10 you
[2:18:10] will see 10 plagues for 6 these have
[2:18:17] power to shut heaven that it rain not in
[2:18:20] the days of prophecy and have power over
[2:18:22] the water to turn it to blood and to
[2:18:24] smite the earth with all plagues as
[2:18:26] often
[2:18:27] there will and when they shall have
[2:18:30] finished their testimony the Beast Rome
[2:18:32] shall ascend out of the bottomless pit
[2:18:35] that's the Pope shall make war against
[2:18:38] them and shall overcome them and kill
[2:18:40] them because under the fifth seal there
[2:18:43] is souls under there okay do you see why
[2:18:46] I started with the seals and their dead
[2:18:50] bodies shall lie in the street of the
[2:18:52] great city which spiritually is called
[2:18:55] Sodom go to Israel and see the level of
[2:18:59] homosexual in Israel
[2:19:01] rising up why are they rising up as it
[2:19:05] was in the days of he starts from us and
[2:19:08] brother branham came but the sodom days
[2:19:11] must be also in ease so that do you see
[2:19:16] do you see God does not change
[2:19:21] spiritually called Sodom and Egypt and
[2:19:24] Egypt where also the Lord was cross God
[2:19:29] was good if I were in everybody clear
[2:19:33] and there of the people of the kingdom
[2:19:38] and tongues and nations shall see their
[2:19:41] dead body three days and a half and
[2:19:43] shall not permit their dead body to be
[2:19:45] put to grave and they shall dwell upon
[2:19:48] the earth and they that dwell upon the
[2:19:50] earth shall rejoice over them and make
[2:19:52] merry and shall send give one to another
[2:19:55] because these two can you say it aloud
[2:19:59] these two who opened the six here who
[2:20:05] when we speak Falkon down a prophet
[2:20:09] stopped the rain a prophet turned water
[2:20:13] into blood prophet bring the plane to
[2:20:16] Egypt Egypt prophet these two are to
[2:20:21] witness to all of trees to all our
[2:20:24] branches to candlestick to anointed one
[2:20:28] to prophet Moses and
[2:20:37] mented them that dwell upon the earth
[2:20:40] let's Roma right now these two are from
[2:20:44] now on when brother branham say it no
[2:20:47] more question are exactly Moses and
[2:20:52] Elijah look at that we just did it
[2:20:56] ministry now watch these two prophet
[2:20:58] they have power to smite the earth with
[2:21:00] blood as often as their will who did it
[2:21:03] do you see how brother branham is line
[2:21:06] up we're not following a a crazy message
[2:21:13] they have power to shut heaven and he
[2:21:16] went not in the days of ministry who
[2:21:18] closed the heaven for three days and
[2:21:20] half the congregation Ezra there they
[2:21:28] are that's them
[2:21:30] the man when he dies he does not change
[2:21:33] his status he does not change his makeup
[2:21:35] Elijah was a prophet to all nation but
[2:21:38] Moses was a lawgiver to the Jews only
[2:21:41] Moses is there now brother Branham is
[2:21:44] explaining why Moses have to come with
[2:21:46] Elijah are you there Moses is there the
[2:21:50] reason he come with Elijah them Jews
[2:21:53] saying
[2:21:53] wait we are still keeping the law but he
[2:21:56] has turned Moses himself when Jesus came
[2:21:59] they said our Father Moses say our
[2:22:02] father Moses say Moses say now God said
[2:22:05] no problem
[2:22:06] take Moses send him normally I just need
[2:22:09] Elijah because that's what I sent to the
[2:22:12] Jetta
[2:22:12] but because the Jewish has a problem
[2:22:15] about Moses that Moses being dead that
[2:22:18] why Jesus say there is one in heaven who
[2:22:22] testified who accuse you he's not who
[2:22:26] they to witness that stand beside beside
[2:22:30] God one of them is accusing the Jewish
[2:22:36] people hallelujah hallelujah and this
[2:22:45] was to bring forth the to witness Moses
[2:22:47] and Elijah which the Jews only believed
[2:22:49] there
[2:22:50] and they shall come forth with the son
[2:22:53] of the Prophet and the work will be done
[2:22:55] of the Prophet for they did exactly
[2:22:57] showing that a man when you die or
[2:23:00] whatever when you leave this world your
[2:23:02] nature does not change if you are a liar
[2:23:05] now you be a liar a day that's why you
[2:23:07] go to hell are you there if you are
[2:23:10] hot-headed here you'll be hot-headed
[2:23:12] there if you're a data here you'll be
[2:23:14] the other day men and women it's time to
[2:23:16] shake yourself and to examine yourself
[2:23:18] and see where you are standing for death
[2:23:21] does not change and here they return
[2:23:25] with the same nature to do the same
[2:23:28] death does Nina do nothing to amend by
[2:23:32] change his dwelling place does not
[2:23:34] change your nature does not change your
[2:23:36] v does not change nothing in you but
[2:23:39] your dwelling place
[2:23:41] are you there ok let me skip this no let
[2:23:46] me get this now as soon as this church

[2:23:52] Ministry of the seventh year or the
[2:23:54] seventh seal the mystery of the goal and
[2:23:57] the Jews is called but the mystery of
[2:23:59] the seventh we want to finish now let's
[2:24:05] take Matthew 24 take Matthew 24 and then
[2:24:17] we head home
[2:24:19] Matthew 24 verse 29 and 31 this is very
[2:24:23] important I could have skip it but I
[2:24:25] cannot the hour is so treacherous I'm

[2:24:44] those days shall the Sun be darkened we
[2:24:48] under 6 you and the moon shall not give
[2:24:50] her light we on the 6th now you get an
[2:24:53] idea or the six series and the stars
[2:24:56] shall fall from heaven
[2:24:57] it's a tribulation and the power of the
[2:24:59] heavens shall be shaken and they shall
[2:25:02] appear a son of

[2:25:44] sixth and the seventh seal he called
[2:25:46] these people spoken by Matthew 24 verse
[2:25:49] that's what we saw is the trumpet of
[2:25:53] death the great trumpet the great seal
[2:25:56] to the gentle it's the biggest trumpet
[2:25:59] to the Jewish people the great is the
[2:26:03] trumpet to the two witness of the edge
[2:26:05] of what a pollen you seen it's the age
[2:26:09] of the grace to the Jews because the

[2:27:18] God is about to deliver his son Israel
[2:27:20] after the same manner of tribulation
[2:27:22] that he'd be done there he said who
[2:27:24] Moses down there to deliver he done this
[2:27:27] very same thing
[2:27:29] he sent Elijah seven thousand came out
[2:27:31] with a hub and he sent him them both of
[2:27:35] him
[2:27:35] go do the same job again normally I just
[2:27:38] need Elijah but the Jewish
[2:27:40] if you don't show them the law they
[2:27:42] won't listen take Moses with you Moses
[2:27:45] have been accusing them go now with the
[2:27:47] spirit of grace and go poo 144,000 over

[2:28:00] Moses modern Moses Elijah Moses Elijah
[2:28:04] at the end the ministry bring
[2:28:07] resurrection and the rapture of the Old
[2:28:10] Testament said when Paul came at the end
[2:28:13] we found out that there is a
[2:28:15] resurrection and a rupture of the same
[2:28:18] and we found that when Moses and Elijah
[2:28:20] came they killed them and after three
[2:28:23] days the spirit of grace came down there
[2:28:26] was what a resurrection let's take this
[2:28:29] and we close Patti thank you for your
[2:28:32] patience
[2:28:33] Matthew chapter 11 and that's it I'm
[2:28:39] glad because I hid where I want it so
[2:28:42] next time we drop in Malachi for are you
[2:28:45] read Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 today
[2:28:53] for this is he of whom it is written
[2:28:58] behold I send my messenger before your
[2:29:03] face which shall prepare your way before
[2:29:06] verily I say unto you among them that
[2:29:11] are born of women there has not risen a
[2:29:13] greater than John the Baptist
[2:29:16] are you there go down to
[2:29:21] 13 for all the profit and the law
[2:29:30] prophesied until who remember we said
[2:29:35] Jesus when he was talking he started by
[2:29:38] Moses and all the profit now Jesus is
[2:29:42] giving us he stopped and the first time
[2:29:46] they say he started by Moses and all the
[2:29:49] profit right you remember did he stop in
[2:29:52] which profit we do but now he is giving
[2:29:54] us his stop he said we started for Moses
[2:29:57] and stopped at who John okay so we found
[2:30:01] a man by the name of John so he started
[2:30:05] from Moses and he started John this is
[2:30:11] your last script for all the profit and
[2:30:13] the law prophesied until because after
[2:30:17] John who came Jesus and if you will
[2:30:20] receive it this is who we just capture
[2:30:26] if you want to receive it verse 14 this
[2:30:29] is who Elijah we should work for to come
[2:30:36] so now Jesus who study for Moses is
[2:30:41] telling us that you start and Moses you
[2:30:45] stop at who by John Jesus call him who
[2:30:49] Elijah this Elijah is just our reference
[2:30:54] so we know what he did and we can trace
[2:30:58] him Moses Elijah then Jesus come and the
[2:31:06] resurrection modern Oh Moses do we have
[2:31:11] an Elijah here before Jesus come and
[2:31:14] bring the resurrection because over here
[2:31:17] we know this we have a turn and we also
[2:31:20] have Jesus coming and we have also a
[2:31:23] resurrection if God does not change who
[2:31:26] is right here
[2:31:33] okay next time
[2:31:36] that will be part eight god bless you

[2:34:02] Jesus on my Transfiguration and he said
[2:34:06] you know if if we're gonna suffer even
[2:34:10] by measure then it's his obligation to
[2:34:13] give us by measure the baptism of the
[2:34:16] Holy Ghost so a song came into my head
[2:34:20] because I'm a song leader that's how I
[2:34:23] think not like a preacher but I started
[2:34:26] thinking those are promises and he you
[2:34:31] know he never he never breaks his
[2:34:33] promise so let me get a key over here
[2:34:36] I'm gonna get a key off of the piano
[2:34:38] it's number 31 in those books if you've
[2:34:40] got it right there in front of you and
[2:34:42] the song is standing on the promises
[2:34:45] we're not gonna sing it real fast and
[2:34:47] we're not gonna sing it in a hurry but
[2:34:49] we're not gonna sing at all but I want
[2:34:51] to give glory to God for standing behind
[2:34:54] his promises because that's a new one
[2:34:57] that that we that I heard today it's
[2:35:00] another revelation that I would see even
[2:35:21] number 31 standing on the promises of
[2:35:26] price my king
[2:35:29] through eternal ages let his praises
[2:35:33] ring glory in the highest I will shout
[2:35:38] and sing standing on the promises of God
[2:35:47] standing standing standing on the
[2:35:53] promises of God my Savior standing
[2:35:59] standing I'm standing on the promises of
[2:36:07] God let's sing the second one standing
[2:36:10] on the promises that cannot fail win the
[2:36:16] howling storms of doubt and fear assail
[2:36:20] by the Living Word of God I shall
[2:36:24] prevail standing on the promises of God
[2:36:31] standing stained
[2:36:36] any standing on the promises of God my
[2:36:42] Savior standing standing
[2:36:50] I'm standing on the promises of God a
[2:36:54] single last verse they're standing on
[2:36:57] the promises of cannot fail listening
[2:37:03] moment to the spirits calm resting in my
[2:37:08] Saviour as my all in all standing on the
[2:37:14] promises of God
[2:37:19] standing stage
[2:37:22] ending standing on the promises of God
[2:37:27] my Savior standing standing
[2:37:36] I'm standing on the promises of God at
[2:37:43] that point when he was preaching to that
[2:37:45] he looked at the camera and he says
[2:37:46] children he was speaking to the young
[2:37:48] people he said that's a promise you know
[2:37:52] God can't fail when you feel like you're
[2:37:54] down and out you know our children are
[2:37:57] the ones as far as as far as this corona
[2:38:00] goes our children are the one I think
[2:38:01] that are suffering the most because they
[2:38:06] need this message really really bad they
[2:38:09] needed in their lives they need to the
[2:38:11] order the discipline the revelation of
[2:38:14] it and they need to see these messages
