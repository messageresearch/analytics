TRANSCRIPT
========================================
back around and made an alliance with that country now we are today and trying to compete with those big denominational churches building bigger schools but we don't need big schools whatever time that you take a Founder a leader that goes forth and his day well he'll do good in his day but as soon as he's gone then they'll build an organization over the top of his word then you'll get a bunch of little rickies in there Elvis's and the first thing you know they twist the thing to make it suit themselves and then this other comes up he injects something else because he's a great intellectual student not a hybrid somewhere or something and the first thing to begin to eject is to take this out and say this didn't mean that that you're right back in the same old run again yes if Amos is your hit blasts the thing right straight to the ground never built his campaign upon how many churches he could get to cooperate with him he never really shuts up on some certain organization or some sectarian parts of the church the thing you do to build his campaign upon the saith the Lord God would back him up as he always did through that is right he said there's trouble as turtles in your church what would he say today what would he say with that word of God hanging out here before us second Timothy 3 words said they'd be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that aren't trying to live right having a farm of godliness but would deny the power thereof you think a prophet could rise on the scene and bypass that prophecy is this full film in your eyes this day how did the church will get Farm on it how the things they would do it he'd bring to your memory those words of God you bring to your memory what God said he'd do in this day an Amos rose on the sea not only that but God would prove by Amos [Music] mistake certainly he would he did it in that day he's always done it certainly we will not receive Amos if he rose on the scene now now that form of Collins stand up there and in the choirs and around all the great long robed choirs and and sang like angels and dates the next night like Devils that's right it's exactly the truth some come out with great long roads on firely looking like that and looked like some kind of an Angelic being and stand up there and deny the word like any evil spirit would have an a form of God that is what would deny the power of [Music] don't talk about the about the baptism the Holy Ghost said why running out of church why he has to but they'll stand in these churches and let their members in the basement do the twists rock and roll [Music] our so-called YMCA I wonder what that C stands for walk into if you can't even hardly hear nothing but the lord's name you is that the young man's curse of society [Music] the YWCA and it was a disgrace to see them little girls out there on the floor until about nine o'clock trying to break their legs and doing the twist right all of the members of the church sang in choirs and taught Sunday school nothing but the devil tasting them little children out there on the floor a system that's been made up called religion certainly a true Prophet replaced that thing right back into the smoke of hell what originated at certain is true you think Amos could stand on the platform and preach the gospel and look out over a bunch of bobbed-haired women and not condemning [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] the Splendor of the king [Music] oh did Majesty let all the Earth Rejoice

the door because I'm not used to Leading on Sunday night or Wednesday night so wow God bless your sins I had a small testimony before I sing on sister Rebecca's wedding I think a week prior I was getting all the ideas of what I wanted to shoot during the wedding written down and I got called to one of our community parties in South Carolina and when we headed on there around five in the morning we spent an entire day shooting and around 5 p.m when we closed out and we wanted to grab a bike uh in the neighborhood that we were there was a series of rubbing and they broke into one of the cars that we had and they stole some of our equipment one of my friends was lucky they didn't steal anything from him because it was in the truck but mine and another friends was in the back seat that took everything so that was a week before the wedding and I panicked because the wedding is coming up I got everything I don't have the money to buy all these new equipment and I really was really frustrated and I didn't know what to do so throughout the week I tried to reach out to whoever I worked with before I tried to rent equipment but the price was really hop up than what I could afford and I think about when I came to church Wednesday and the pastor mentioned something that he always says put your car in neutral and let God handle everything and when I walked in the door I was I was still thinking about who I can call after church who I can reach out to but when I left I was like it's in God's hands uh so Thursday I went to South Carolina for another shoot with the friend that we was with that had his equipment saved he didn't get it he's stolen and we met up with one of the clients and after filming the entire day my friends that were with me my colleague that were with me talked to him about what happened and I was on the phone you know trying to reach other people you pulled me aside outside of the set and he asked me if the story was true and I told him yes I got a wedding coming up Saturday and I don't have anything and he offered to give me everything that I needed for that event and I told him okay I don't have enough money but this is what our guys about 500. I can pay you in advance and whenever I get some more money I can it's like everything is free so during the party everything that I needed he'd give it to me free and I want something to go for that God is good all the time [Music] God is good all the time he put a song of Praise In This Heart of Mine God is good all the time through the darkest night his life will shine [Music] good songs

[Music] he's so good all the time [Music] Lori [Applause] we needed that didn't we I asked him why we hadn't sang that before see that's that's the when a song leader can't get past the first Pew with the service that's what happens okay I've been leaving sing in 30 years it's not a stranger to me okay now brother Seth has a song and the last time he sang it he preached I think and he told me a while ago that that he wrote this song and I didn't know that so we have an inspired songwriter he's got another one which we're waiting on I'm telling it all because he made the mistake of telling me and you know me so God amen amen with that inspiration amen that the brother song with amen I just pray the Lord amen bless me tonight amen Lord help me amen I know you know that story behind this song Amen the lord gave me that song when brother Stephen called me to preach a man it was it was in line with um the bride's Jubilee amen so I the Lord touched my heart today to sing it amen but I just want to say that the lord gave me another song Amen but I'm still working on it man and one of these days we were going to sing it amen amen amen [Music] very nice [Music] thank you [Music] to bring the glory back [Music] this is [Music] say s [Music] Center to bring the glory back to Earth [Music] this is [Music] foreign [Music] he said [Music] generation [Music] glory to God do you believe it tonight the Lord Almighty has descended do you know what he came to do right to bring the glory back [Laughter] the Bible say shalom amen Shalom the Lord has risen his glory has risen upon thee amen everybody happy tonight everybody's still cleaning from Sunday everything clear on Daniel nobody got lost everybody on board praise the Lord amen so if everybody is good that's wonderful then you're seven and eight are covered in a portion of 11. those are very hard stuff but if you travel there pretty good that is wonderful amen remember to review Ezekiel 38 and 39. man so we're going to leave from Daniel 11 touch Daniel 11 and go back to Ezekiel pick it up and then we try to finish on the bottom and try to go back up to the surface amen amen oh my God it's not me the word keeps unfolding so big it's so big yeah you look and you see the same thing you were looking before and you see it completely totally different amen you just go here and he goes to description push you to description push you to description and some of the time brother Branham didn't even have enough time to go through every detail and now you begin to understand when brother Branham say it's written in the Bible it's written in the Bible but never even gave a scripture for it so once he say it's written in the Bible that's all I need when you trace it you begin to say rather you say my God this message is so perfectly in line with the scripture amen glory to God we have a Duo 42 we have a Lambo and we have a lion amen so there is a time that we are lamb right now there will come a time that we will be roaring like lions amen oh my glory to God you pray for me because the devil has been shooting everything on my truck and I know he's upset but I'm not complaining just saying to stay in prayer amen I'm having even just if I as soon as I touch my Bible trying to read something is something he's it looks like he doesn't even want me to read the Bible I say just reading the Bible it's a problem amen but we're making it through amen he's upsetting something here upsetting something he upsetting something dear before you know it God is it's a military airplane uh the the commercial airplane you can only drive straight the military you can do flips in the air and then you can still Dodge the devil that's the problem he doesn't understand amen and the more he does it the boss keep unfolding all it takes is just two minutes and the Revelation like glory to God Amen there is nothing to fear don't worry about the destruction online on the internet in the message world what people are saying shouldn't focus in the word because through this distraction God is moving slowly and he's working with his broad strengthening his blood you didn't start this thing it is not your responsibility to finish it he's the author and the finisher of water so your faith didn't start by you and you're not going to finish your faith so somebody started your faith and somebody's gonna finish your faith so what do you have to do there you see what I'm saying this Christian work is so good if you learn how to rest at the feet of Boaz everybody okay everybody okay you didn't start it don't worry about it whatever is in the middle as long as you know who started did God tell Joshua that one day you're going to stop the Sun [Music] did he tell him that but he was in the package Joshua didn't know that he was in the package until something happened amen then he found out there is an option he never investigate before amen [Laughter] you don't know what God did in you until you see God coming out of you you still have not you still have not understand what God have done to you I was telling my wife coming on the road and say they killed three people they killed Jesus he killed the two Thief amen and they put him down and the soldier took the hammer okay come to the first one and break the leg they went to the second one and break the leg when they reached Jesus Christ for some reason one of the soldiers said he's dead just leave him alone everybody okay for some reason that's the way you want to you want you want to get stuff for some reason amen that Millet that Soldier can go home and say you know what we break two legs honey but uh when I look at that man called Jesus I just feel so pity for him until I look he was murdered he didn't do anything I just felt like I just leave him alone that's what the soldier taught the soldier thought that it was him purposely that choose not to break the the bones of Jesus Christ he didn't know there was a scripture do you understand what I'm saying if a scripture can be fulfilled in on a military man that doesn't like Jesus [Music] is it okay is it okay this man was not a Christian amen he had the right to break the bond of Jesus Christ but the scripture that was spoken have power over the enemy of Jesus Christ to make that enemy fulfill the word of God what does the scripture will do to you what do you think the scripture will do to you when you the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] amen you don't know what God built in you until the time camera amen until the time come you will realize what's going on get a a woman with a baby try to get the baby out you'll see which strength coming out of that woman probably she never thought she has it but there is something that will open up that she never thought happened before amen you are more than that more than a match for the devil you just have not understanding it but God will bring you to that realization until you will understand who you are and you will turn around and say how was the devil really playing with me I wish I knew this a long time ago because you're going to deal with the devil twice before you leave this world you deal with the Devil and when you go up you're gonna come back again it is written in the scripture so you need to learn how to fight now because your fight is not over you're going into the Rapture three three and a half year rejoicing with Jesus Christ asking him all the question before you know it at a certain time Jesus will say hey hold on get ready we're going back again let's stop the party let's go back again we have another party back there amen do you know that you have a horse the day you will understand what a horse sees you will say this message is so big it's so wonderful he unveiled the entire world of there is nothing in the scripture that is hidden before this message everything is just unfold like this don't worry do just what God asked you to do everything will be okay you cannot sanctify yourself don't be a leopard that tried to leak out your old spot you just make them bread everybody okay just surrender he knows what to do you probably don't realize where you're already with God you're already far away with God from where you started go ahead and sit and make an inventory of where we're coming from and you're going to find out that wait a minute was I living there yes you were there but if your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life even if you grow up with the Pope Moses grew up with pharaoh did Pharaoh change Moses did Pharaoh convert Moses you can leave your child in the world if that child that is in the word is a child of God do you follow me there is nothing that the devil will do to that child came back amen if your name is written in the Book of Life there is nothing you cannot mishap the Rapture will never happen without you nobody will be we won't be standing there in the Rapture with an empty seat everybody will be there the one who's not going to be there means that they were not predestinated for the airplane that's it amen so everything is okay brother said coffee is preaching tonight you

that that name was ever spoken a dead baby came to life and jumped for life and jumped for joy in the womb how powerful the name of Jesus is and we are we're so glad to be gathered here together and I see uh brother Stephen showed me where the water was so I guess he expects me to preach pretty hard tonight I've always made a promise if you pull I'll preach amen We Believe with all of our hearts that there was a gift and then he Minister any true Minister before the foundation of the world we know gifts and callings are without repentance so we know that before the foundation of the world I believe there was a gift placed in my life and you know when people start pulling I can't help but start preaching so I'll make you a promise tonight that if you pull I believe that the gift of God not Seth coffee but the gift of God can identify with your need and God can speak through that gift to touch the very need that you have in your life amen tonight I would like to to take a text if the Lord willing and the Lord be with it I would like to speak on creating an atmosphere for victory creating an atmosphere for victory and we're going to go to a very familiar scripture we could all Quote it but let's turn to Hebrews 13 8.

almighty God father we love you We Praise You almighty God thank you for taking over the service Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated so we know in Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and as I said we would like to speak on creating an atmosphere and you know one thing I begin to realize when I looked at this is everything you know we always hear people say we're going to build the right atmosphere we have the song leader come up and he tries to build an atmosphere but what I want you to realize tonight that everything is actually wrapped around atmosphere you may you may know this but we are actually living within the atmosphere of the Earth they're everywhere that we go there is an atmosphere in it and I was in church probably two and a half three weeks ago now and I was sitting there and something began to speak to me and said an atmosphere for The King and I began to think of that oh how powerful that is an atmosphere for the king and as I said I thought about that and it began to blow my mind because I began to think of that everything is wrapped around atmosphere from the moment that you wake up from the moment that you go to bed you are constantly going in and out of atmospheres and I heard this story on the radio about a man in a boxcar and and it struck me I know it was just the grace of God you know how God would do things for your brother Stephen and I just happened to turn on the radio or whatever it was and and I was listening the man began to tell a story about how there was a man and I didn't catch the whole story I caught the the later half of it from either he was working on the box cars or he was messing around the box cars and and anyways when he was around that boxcar he accidentally locked himself into that boxcar and when he locked himself into that boxcar he began to realize I can't get out of here unless someone helps me I cannot get out of here and he began to have all these negative thoughts he began to think man there's no way that I'm going to make this I I just don't know if I can make it I'm not sure and then that turned into there's definitely no way I can make it so I believe he took a penny out of his pocket and he began to ride on the wall and he began to tell all of his thoughts and everything that he was thinking because he really believed that he wasn't going to be take it brother Stephen he really believed that he was going to die and about that time the train began to take off and he began to say in his own mind he began to speak out and say it's getting colder in here I'm getting colder and he began to ride on that wall I'm getting colder and he began to write all of his life thoughts and he began to say it's getting colder and colder and colder and colder in here and to the point you could see where he's coming down to his final words and he begins to say I just can't take it any longer he began to say my body is beginning to freeze to death these are going to be my last words well you know that was his last words they the The Boxcar stopped and they opened the boxcar and they found the man dead in there the thing was the engineer came and he said the thing about it is that is a climate controlled boxcar so they began to say the temperature the whole time that he was in there brother Stephen would have been around 60 degrees but the Man created such a Negative atmosphere he created such a bad atmosphere inside of that boxcar that he began to tell itself I'm a failure I'm not gonna make it I can't make it and through that atmosphere he actually talked himself into his own death begin to think oh my if a negative atmosphere could do that what could a positive atmosphere do I begin to think about that and you know me and my wife we we took we had a uh we have a we have a little cat and and I brought it home unexpectedly one time and my wife wasn't too happy about it it was for my daughter and I had that little cat and she said well if you want that cat you're gonna have to get it fixed and everything else and I say okay so I put it off forever and finally she said the Humane Society is doing it for twenty dollars and that sounded good to me so I ran down there to get it done and and when I got there everybody was happy at first because everybody was getting a good deal everyone was going to get a good deal on this but you know people begin to block one another in with their cars because there was a small area of parking and when they came in even though everybody was happy at first people began to realize I'm getting blocked in here I'm going to have to stay longer than I want to stay here and next thing you know this person gets mad and begins to begins to put a negative atmosphere off and it goes on to the next one and that one begins to have a negative atmosphere and say well I'm blocked in here too and the one in front of me got that negative atmosphere and said what are we going to do and I spoke up and I said I'll tell you what I'm just thankful that I'm not in Florida right now and there ain't no hurricane hitting my house and next thing you know the next person begin to say you know I'm thankful for that too because I I could be there right there and one person began to say you know I used to be there and I know what those hurricanes are liking it you see how the atmosphere begin to change I don't know I don't want to get ahead of myself but you have the right to change the atmosphere and we can look at the one that always had the most excellent atmosphere with them I began to think of Jesus and it says there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into this ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep [Music] he was asleep on a pillow what was he doing even though everyone around him was panicking Jesus was dwelling in his own atmosphere he didn't care what was going on around him I want you to know what it was about Jesus Jesus knew the purpose of his life Jesus knew where he was going Jesus knew where he had to be Jesus knew he had a calling Jesus knew there was going to be a cross and there couldn't be an ocean that could stop him he was dwelling in his atmosphere and they awake him and said unto him Master cares not that we perish they had a pretty bad atmosphere going on and even the atmosphere around them wasn't so great either Carousel not that we perish and he arose and rebuke the wind and he said unto the sea peace be still and the wind cease and there was a great calm and he said unto them why are ye so fearful can I say that unto the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight why are ye so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they have and they feared exceedingly saying one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him because I want you to know wherever Jesus is Jesus will change the atmosphere I don't know how you came here tonight I don't know how you were feeling but when you come into the presence of Jesus Jesus will always change your atmosphere look in the scriptures that everywhere Jesus went Jesus changed the atmosphere I want to say that again everywhere Jesus went he changed the atmosphere I began to think of that and now you know I begin to think man how amazing is our God that everywhere he went he changed the atmosphere you know I began to think of gerias and and now his daughter was dead and and he said Lord just come pray for my daughter and then when they got there I love how everyone would say she's dead the doctor said she's dead the neighbor said she's dead [Music] nature said she's dead but Jesus in the atmosphere that he brought he would walk into that situation and he would begin to say oh she's just sleeping [Music] hey hey don't worry your ass man don't worry she's just sleeping and they laughed him to scorn but Jesus didn't like that atmosphere so it said when Jesus had put it all out if you want to learn something from Jesus here's a good time to do it when negativity comes around put it all out ain't got no room I ain't got no time I ain't got time for that some of us didn't even say devil you need to put him in his place like he's a little child when you're busy and say I don't have time for that go settle down and when he was coming he said to them why I'm making this a door and wheat the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and mother of the damsel and then that were with him and entered where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by the hand and he sent her there said unto her talith Kumi which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee Jesus is changing the atmosphere that's what's going on Jesus is changing the atmosphere he says Denzel I say that's what I say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was the age of 12 years old and they were astonished with a great astonishment [Music] kind of kind of sounds like I'm on the boat what manner of man is this what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Seas obey him I love how wherever Jesus went he wasn't worried about the atmosphere he changed the atmosphere thank you well what is bro you know it was the same thing it was the same thing with Legion one day I love that because there was a bunch of men that would try to bind Legion there was a bunch of different men that would try to say let's try this to bind him and let's try that to bind him and they would have all their own ideas and and they would begin to try to bind them with chains and and he would just break them free it kind of reminds me of these denominational programs and different things trying to train people into something and train someone out of something if it ain't for the power of God you ain't going to be free but Jesus had such an atmosphere about him that when he stepped off of that boat and he stepped onto that Shore the Devils came running to Jesus can you imagine Legion in that cave and then when Jesus stepped on the shore those Legion of devils began to say the atmosphere has changed back in that cave they begin to say a legion of devils begin to talk to one another and they begin to say do you feel that do you feel that you know what PTSD is can you imagine when they said that's Michael that was the one that was in heaven and when Lucifer tried to gather us all together we thought we were going to overthrow him he kicked us out the atmosphere began it was a familiar atmosphere it was a familiar atmosphere that they walked in Hallelujah it was such a familiar atmosphere they began to tremble and begin to go that's Michael that's gotta be Michael what can we do Hallelujah I don't know I know we can't outrun him I know we can't hide from that discernment I I know we can't do that and Buddy those demons atmosphere begin to change I'm feeling good tonight they begin to say only thing I can do oh I think I know we can do let's go beg for mercy and they run to Jesus and in the atmosphere that Jesus is making they don't say put up your best fight Jesus show me what you got but they come and say oh thou Son of God please don't torment us before our time not one devil a legion of devils came before one almighty God there was such an atmosphere they said just don't torment us before our time and as Jesus as Jesus cast them out of Heaven he cast them out of legion and sent them right into the swine Jesus didn't have an all-night prayer Maiden he made such an atmosphere about him he just said go I don't know if you know who you're serving tonight but let's listen to what brother Brandon says he says you create not just Jesus but you create a creation around you come on now [Music] you create a creation around you you've seen people you couldn't stand to be around [Music] we're nice people they create within themselves love to be with because they create that atmosphere around them he said that's your spirit your soul you can't hide it you can't make believe it now I said this last time I preached this but you know uh any of y'all know big eagle Richie Douglas man what a good atmosphere that brother has I'm gonna tell you what uh okay I I I'm gonna have to take my halo off here for a minute if that's all right but but you know me and my wife we have those two little children and it's everything that we can do we want to make it to church on time but we'll we'll get up the night before the wife has the clothes laid out and we're trying to get out the door and everything's going wrong we walk all the way the car forgets something come back in you know having to change the baby two times he don't he don't ever use the restroom any other time but on Sunday morning he does we're trying to get out the door and I don't have the best atmosphere about me and I'm just trying to get to church and and you know me and Selena we have a a passionate discussion and we're trying to make it to church y'all laughing like you know what I'm talking about and and we're trying to get to church and I have already decided I'm in a bad mood I've already decided I'm just going here because it's my duty but I get in church and I sit down and I look across the church and brother Richie's going and next thing you know because of the atmosphere because as soon as he smiles at me I hear him I hear my voicemail Brady says brother Seth I just want you to know Jesus loves you and I do too because of the atmosphere that he creates around him [Music] fear now I should have never been in that in the first place I'll admit that but I will say this we have the power to change the atmosphere around us sometimes we overthink it sometimes it would make it too complicated but all it takes is a smile and I love you and Jesus does too I love them see you create your own atmosphere around you you believe that you sure do many of you has read my book The Man sent from God remember the night the maniac ran to the platform to kill me air in Portland Oregon you read the story note about no doubt ma it's everywhere what happened well that poor fellow I didn't get angry with him I didn't get angry with him I loved him something happened I want you to know what the power of a true love God is love he said I loved him he run out there 250 60 pounds great big pretty near six foot and a half said I'll break every bone in your body he's coming with an atmosphere he could do it but I didn't hate him I loved him I felt sorry for him he was bound I didn't have to scream I said Satan come out of the man he fell on the floor that was it that was all now there's another quote now let me tell you something each man that's born again with the spirit of God in him is a miniature creator now that might shake you a little bit but that's the truth we're in the image of God God is a Creator that's the reason you can believe that God could heal a person because God is in you and God made this world he just spoke it and his words become material the very ground that you're setting on is the word of God made manifest if he didn't where did he get it see he just spoke it and turned it into existence he believed it in his own word and if a man is born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God if a man is Born Into the spirit of God he's an offspring of God I'm gonna make this as simple as I know how to say it when you have a man and a woman that come together by a marriage and they're both very athletic people very fast people athletic all around you know what that baby's going to be athletic it's in its genes it can't help but be what it is I'm gonna tell you what I was at the barber Tuesday and the man I went to get a haircut but I looked in the mirror and the man was cutting my dad's hair because I was looking at my father in the mirror [Music] I might have not have liked it but I couldn't change it it was I am who I am and I cannot help but be Mark coffey's son because that that's just what I am I do stuff like my father I say stuff like my father he didn't have to train me to do it it just comes out of me he's an offspring of God and that's the part that God is in him he believes every word that God says will materialize D and so that makes him a part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of God what I'm trying to tell you at the beginning of the story you could see Jesus on the stormy seas and he would rebuke the storm you you can see him with jarius's daughter and she will he would raise her from the dead if he's the hell what was his children do then they would do the same thing the spirit of almighty God that is in them you cannot help but be who you are we are made to change the atmosphere we are made if Jesus changed the atmosphere and we have the same Gene's word seed on the inside of us I'm going to say it you might not like it we ain't made to dwell in the devil's atmospheres but we have the power to create an atmosphere and walk into that atmosphere Abraham against hope believed in Hope brother Branham said he got stronger through his trials every time he went up to Sarah and he said Sarah is there any difference and she said no not yet Abraham he still created an atmosphere that said if it's not today it'll be tomorrow and if it's not tomorrow such an atmosphere that he got a visit from God himself thank you he created such an atmosphere that his old body began to change he created such an atmosphere that at a hundred years old and Sarah 75 their bodies were so changed that a king would look at Grandma and see he would say she is fair to look upon because of the atmosphere that they created let me tell you something you're a Seed of Abraham Abraham's seed ain't no wimp seed it's a fake seed you are made to change the atmosphere you are made to overcome every gate of the enemy if you're in any kind of carpentry if you're any kind of carpenter or anything like that they will develop a drill to be able to drill a screw into a two by four a Sawzall cannot do that a skill saw cannot do that a handsaw cannot do that but the drill can because from the beginning an engineer designed that tool he designed it in such a way that it would have a purpose and it would fulfill that purpose when all of the elements came together and it was in the right atmosphere and you took that drill and the battery was fully charged brother sister it dwelled in the presence of that charger and began to draw its strength into that battery and before you know it it couldn't help but produce the power that was on the inside of it and when the mechanics and the Dynamics come together it'll produce the word of God every time you ever try to do the job with the wrong tool you'll be there for hours jumping around doing this that and the other but you grab what was made for the purpose you are trying to do and it cannot fail because it was made to do it and we are made to overcome we are in Satan's end to overcome foreign but we are not living in the atmosphere of Satan's Eden this is what we are coming to we are like Adam and God's Eden again and if Adam spoke the word in that atmosphere in the atmosphere of the Garden of Eden he could speak the word Hallelujah we are in Satan's Eden but we ain't in the atmosphere of Satan's Eden we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but you got to be willing to change your atmosphere if you're dwelling somewhere you ain't supposed to be dwelling then change the atmosphere I think of the woman with the blood issues she began to see Jesus come by and she had all the other doctors say there's no hope you can't do it there's nothing we can do for you I made this statement maybe even she talked to Luke the apostle that was a physician and he says I've seen this before there's not a cure but as Jesus comes by she begins to build an atmosphere and even though all the drugs didn't work come on somebody even though all the drugs didn't work I was getting drunk on the new wine then he's the pain but there was something on the inside of her that began to make an atmosphere that said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment and know that I'll be made whole that sounds ridiculous to everyone around but in her atmosphere all things are possible to them that believe [Music] she built can I say this have you ever been to a place where there was such a bad atmosphere that you knew you weren't supposed to be there before you spoke to anybody before you said a word you walked into something and you walked back out because you said that is not an atmosphere for a son or a daughter of God to be in you know she had to fight her way through the crowd but I kind of Wonder brother Stephen did she make such an atmosphere by her faith that when she was coming up behind people before they ever seen her or knew that she was there they began to feel uncomfortable standing in her way because she made such an atmosphere that devil it was like the Red Sea church there was such an atmosphere that she created saying if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment she had a purpose and God had to fulfill that purpose I'm gonna tell you right now I believe that her atmosphere draw Jesus closer to her I love what Billy Graham said one time one guy said I Found Jesus he said I didn't know Jesus was lost Jesus ain't lost Jesus knew right where he was he knew right where that woman was and I believe you don't you don't have to believe this but I believe that she built such an atmosphere that he began to alter the course of Jesus closer and closer [Music] do you not know that God inhabits the Praises of his people God loves to go where he's welcome so a deep call to the Deep begins to build an atmosphere and there's something that Jesus begins to drift over you know I've said it like this Jesus is supposed to walk this line but her faith begins to draw Jesus and as Jesus is walking by I want to tell it to you this way because Satan says you can never get help Satan says it'll never work but here's the thing in your mind it won't work but God doesn't do the math that we do we try to figure everything out [Music] I can't figure out how God turned the water into wine [Music] you think I can figure out how he raised Lazarus from the dead you tell me how that woman touched a man's clothes and next thing you know I believe it said she had the problem for 20 years gone because the atmosphere that she built you ain't got to worry I want to say it this way stop trying to figure out God [Applause] can we stop trying to figure out God and stop telling God how to run the program I'm a tattoo like this I've been under a lot of stress lately we'll be honest I'm an honest preacher I I I I ain't no Holier I ain't no holier than thou okay [Music] I'm right there with you I'm fighting with a sword Hand in Hand by you you don't believe me I'll pull this one out in front of the pulpit I'm telling you yes Selena there really is a sword under the pulpit I'll tell you I was so stressed I'm trying to sell a house I'm trying to take over a new territory at work and work in the old territory at the same time double duty and then I have children that I'm trying to raise I'm doing all this at one time I'm trying to get the house ready I'm trying to do all this I don't know how it's going to add up how am I going to do this that and the other so I decide I'm going to get away and I go hunting and I sit in the woods and I'm out in the middle of the woods and I'm trying to be quiet and you know I'm kind of talking to God a little bit and I'm just I'm hoping a deer walks out or something you know and the next thing I know some neighbor decides to blast his music and I said I can't even get away right try to come out here try to find some peace and I'm sitting here going God how are you going to do this God how are you going to do that God this and that don't add up now I'm asking with a sincere heart don't think I'm just being a smart alec up there but I'm saying God I don't understand this God I don't know how this is going to happen this guy's blaring the music and I'm saying God I I I don't know what to do and then something says listen to the music and I'm like I don't want to listen to music I don't he just listen to the music and I began to listen and it was a song and it began to say how the love of God chases me down the never-ending overwhelming Reckless Love of God and I began to think if God loves me so much that I would be in the middle of the Woods and some guy walks on his back porch [Music] I'm gonna turn on some music that man probably listened to country music every night of the week but for some reason that night he decides I'm going to turn on some Christian music and then he accidentally left his hearing aids in the house so he cranks that thing up where he can hear it and I'm out in the woods going I don't know what to do God I can't understand this and then while I'm in the middle of the woods God begins to change my atmosphere I began to realize if God loves me sis there ain't a problem big enough in the world we worry we fear we wonder why we stress over this we stress over that church if God loves you why does it matter all these things are going to fade away anyways but then maybe and then right after that song they switch over to a song that that charity girl girl sings I speak Jesus and I began to come home and I tell my wife I said I said I said I'll tell you what God loves me I know God loves me she says what do you mean I began to tell her I was in the woods and I was complaining to God y'all ain't never gonna have me back you're good I was complaining to God and he began to say Seth just be quiet stop trying to tell me how to run my program I love you son I've always took care of you and she said but there's one thing you didn't notice I said what's that she said you didn't realize that that song that they were singing was the same song that you put your boy to sleep to every night [Music] further more than that she played that song or they played that song I speak Jesus that boy when he was born they said he didn't have Hearing in one ear they said he failed the hearing test but I took that song I speak Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I began to play that song in his ear they said we'll come back and do another test they came back in and did the test and they said he failed I said no he didn't my atmosphere had done changed brother Stephen I didn't care what that nurse said I didn't care what she had to say my son was gonna have perfect hearing so he done failed two tests but he had to come back two weeks later but I didn't think about it no more because my son was gonna have perfect hearing and that woman came back and she did the test and she said Selena coffee your son has perfect Hearing in both ears because in the atmosphere of the most high God all things are possible to them that believe when you believe you'll create an atmosphere like God Almighty in the heavens before there was a earth before there was a heaven he began to have a thought and he would believe his own thoughts and it would create such an atmosphere that when he would speak Here Comes the Sun here comes the Earth wow because it was an atmosphere of only believe he believed his own words and the almighty God dwells in you [Music] why cry speak [Music] you got a problem tonight let's change the atmosphere you got some in your life you don't like you got an addiction that's bothering you let's change the atmosphere [Music] we are made we are Heavenly Creatures we are the genetics of the most high God [Music] we'll get somewhere here in just in a minute [Music] can I just preach on not worry about the time I'm sorry I just want to get this off my heart [Music] I'll skip that part there [Music] but I want you to know you might be going through a lot but there's a lot that can be changed in the right atmosphere you might be going through problems you might be going through situations but you change that atmosphere and see what happens I think of Paul and Silas changing the atmosphere Paul and Silas are commissioned by Jesus Christ to go and preach the gospel they go into a place and there's a fortune teller woman and they cast that evil spirit out of her and then they get in trouble for doing it after Jesus commissioned them to do it then they get thrown in trip because listen Paul would say when I would do good evil is present I know you're just trying to do good in this life the evil is going to be present and he would try to do good but evil was present and next thing you know they beat them they give them Stripes they throw them in the innermost part of the jail [Music] fasten them tight that's a bad situation [Music] but Paul begins to look at Silas can I dramatize here for a minute Paul begins to look at Silas [Music] and I don't know and you know I pray I pray to God I would have the same testimony that Paul would have but it wouldn't be too far-fetched for me to say God why'd you do this to me [Music] I did what you asked me to do I'm trying to go and preach the gospel I cast out an evil spirit like you told me to do in mark 16. and now I'm right here but Paul didn't do that Paul if you ever want to get the right attitude do this Paul began to realize where God brought him from and Paul began to look at Silas and he began to say Silas you don't know how happy I am Silas myself what are you talking about he began to say silence you don't know the kind of man I've been you don't know what I'm about this I shouldn't be here I shouldn't have the privilege to be in these chains beside of you and Silas begins to say foreign [Music] I don't deserve this either I might not have been as bad as you Paul but ever since my youth I I ran from Jehovah I stole things I got into drugs and different things I should have never got a part of but one day he called me out Paul and they began to say oh how marvelous it is to thank everything that Jesus went through for us and we could bear a little bit of that shame today we could bear a little bit of reproach for Jesus Christ silence began to say oh it just does something on the inside of me and Paul began to say let's just sing a little bit [Music] how are you looking at your trials [Music] how are you looking at your trials pains were fast and tied but they begin to sing can you imagine two people in jail singing the Praises of almighty God and they just want to lift their hands and praise God and give a wave offering but they're tied up so they're just trying to make some kind of movement you might be bound up and you might feel like you can't get your hand up but just try to make a little bit of movement [Music] I love it because God inhabits the Praises of his people they begin to make such an atmosphere that God Almighty would look down on that praise and he would say I just can't take it anymore I gotta be there I gotta be with them and an earthquake [Music] Ace I ain't never seen an earthquake make handcuffs come off but I ain't trying to figure out God all I can tell you is when they were praising God and they made such an atmosphere [Music] that prison might as well been a house of almighty God foreign he's great and awesome My God is Awesome they begin to sing and before they knew it I wonder if they were so caught up in the spirit that when they came out they didn't even realize they were free I wonder if there's people in this service that we're battling something before they even knew it they were free [Music] it doesn't take much just praise God and these kind of atmospheres in the atmosphere of almighty God you can go free you said I feel bound and these chains are heavy it might be a strong devil but Forever Strong devil there's a stronger God Forever Strong depression there's a greater anointing bringing the joy of the Holy Ghost but I say unto you it's up to you Paul and Silas begin to sing and before they knew it they were free I say unto you I say I say brother Stephen rejoice and go free my atmosphere is freedom tonight if you would like to partake of my atmosphere I encourage you raise your hands praise the most high God and say I am free I'm free I'm free there's the atmosphere I'm free I'm free these chains are strong but God is stronger I'm free [Music] that pornography devil is strong but God is stronger I say this church of the most high God if you can go into Walmart and those people can make such an atmosphere that you don't feel welcome how much more could the Sons and Daughters of almighty God make an atmosphere this evening wherever the devil says I gotta get out of here I can't stay here no longer I'm not comfortable here this ain't my place this is too heavenly [Applause] you can sit there and dwell in that defeated atmosphere if you want to but as Joshua said for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord because you don't know where he's brought me from you don't know what he brought me out of he promised me when I was a 15 year old boy and I opened this Bible for the first time the first thing I ever ran is my Grace will be sufficient for thee ever since then I've dwelled in that atmosphere knowing if God is for me who could be against me you say it's a big devil it only takes a little Stone [Music] I began to think I wonder if David created such an atmosphere not wonder he did he created such an atmosphere that when everyone else all of it see that's what I'm saying if people in the church don't want to Rejoice that ain't got to affect you come on he said who when they said who's going to fight who's going to fight who's going to fight thank God there's a David in every age David walked up and said who is that uncircumcised for this team trying to defy the the army of the Living God who is that uncircumcised for this team trying to defy the message of the hour [Music] is there any David's in here tonight Goliath looks big Lots look strong but let me tell you something David had a promise and David had a purpose and David was anointed and he began to tell Saul you don't know what he's brought me out of brother I can't turn against him now he created such an atmosphere that he convinced the very king of Israel a little guy little King David but with the atmosphere that he built Saul would say I don't know much about him but I'm gonna tell you what he's been with God and David would go out such an atmosphere he didn't run from his problems he ran to his problems [Music] and he was swinging that stone and I wonder don't worry God's got it all in control little sis you ain't got to figure it out you just got to throw the stone I wonder brother Steve I wonder if he let go of that stone and the stone went that way but he had such an atmosphere about him he released The Rock maybe it went that way but brother God called for a curveball and the atmosphere that he built rerouted God will always fulfill his promises even if we get in the way even if we release the Rock at the wrong time in the atmosphere that David created I will be Victorious and before he knew it he let it go it hit the mark because God's word will never miss a mark foreign Church of the Living God if he says we're going to take a body change [Applause] you might not understand it but God sent a message to change the atmosphere that we can have faith but before we know it this mortality this Mortal will take on immortality it won't be hard the atmosphere will be there to do it only believe all things all things are possible [Applause] [Music] changing the atmosphere let me tell you a story because there's those chains every now and then that feel like you can't break [Music] was that the coast not long ago [Music] me and my wife went to a shop and when we walked out of it out across the sound there was this dock and on the side of this dock they had these giant six seven inch Links of chains I would imagine those Chains would probably hold a hundred thousand pounds I used to work with chains lifting heavy stuff up when we lift 8 000 pounds we didn't need a chain but about that big and this chain was about that big but I was looking at that chain brother Stephen and when I was looking at that chain about every six to eight feet that chain was broke and I began to look at that chain and I began to think that's odd I know from experience that that chain will hold a lot and I mean a lot of weight but under its own weight that chain was broken but you know what it was it was in the atmosphere of the salt water it was in the atmosphere of that salt water now listen the first day they put those chains out there brother Stephen they could hold a hundred thousand pounds [Music] a year later they could still hold a hundred thousand pounds but as the atmosphere of that salt water begin to eat away and rust out the year after that they could only hold ninety thousand pounds and then the year after that because corrosion had set in it could only hold 70. and then after that it gets even worse because the atmosphere of the salt water it can only hold 30 000 pounds and then the next year it jumps all the way down to just be able to hold a hundred pounds but one day in the atmosphere of that salt water it might not looked like it was doing anything but in the atmosphere of the salt water that chain one day begin to say I can't even hold my own way any longer and it broke off let me tell you something Satan might have had you wrapped in some hundred thousand pound chains and you might have came to church one Sunday and it didn't break or the next Sunday it didn't break but you didn't realize the chain was getting weaker and then one day God sent us Son of God to the platform to tell you the atmosphere has set you free [Music] what once had you bound you didn't even realize it but in the presence of the Son of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God faith is a strength that is greater than every chain faith is like that salt water and it's rising up and Satan tries to tell you it ain't but you realize the things you used to battle when you first became a Christian you don't battle that anymore so you must be getting stronger and you get stronger and stronger and it might have been a problem you had your whole life but whatever it was my brother the presence of almighty God [Music] you're free in Jesus you say Satan says I'm still man don't dwell in that atmosphere [Music] that's not who you are if Satan says I was bound if Satan says I was depressed and Satan says I don't have joy I would change my atmosphere [Music] when Peter and John pass through the gate called Beautiful there laid a man who had been crippled laying from his mother's womb and he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk see and they talk to them and know that they were ignorant and unlearned but they had taken notice of the atmosphere but they had taken notice that they had been with Jesus see the token was there displayed such as I have see a poor brother laying there crippled and disfigured and everything and the same life somebody say same life that was in Christ was in them churches I have in my name ye shall cast out devils not I will you will if you say to this melon not if I say if you say to this mountain oh brother the hour of that token to be displayed is at hand we can see it we know that we're near the end now we brought all kinds of messages up to show signs and wonders and now we've come back for what the church has got to do the token has got to be displayed when I see the blood I will pass over you nothing else will work it must be the blood now the Holy Ghost is our token from God foreign [Music] if you have the Holy Ghost it is time to speak and go forward and say this is not the atmosphere but I will live in but I will live in the holiest of holies I don't care what's going on around me I gotta skip some of this but when brother Branham told the story of when the death angel would come through the land of Egypt [Music] and they said if I see the blood I'll pass over brother Branham said the blood today is the Holy Ghost the life of the blood [Music] I believe you have the Holy Ghost because you're receptive to the word
