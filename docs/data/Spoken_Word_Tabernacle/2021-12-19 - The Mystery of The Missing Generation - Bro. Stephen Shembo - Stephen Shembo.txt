praying so all the glory return unto god how many are up to date with the sermon raise your hand blessed be the name of the lord i don't want anybody to be behind amen this is no more blaming time you know blaming time or we were not taught like this in the message we didn't have this in the message i wish we have this in the message there is no more blaming time amen we gave you time for house meeting time for youth meeting for sisters meeting brothers meeting all kind of media i received texts left and right and i reply them all kind of stuff amen so if you came to this church a little bit later what i mean later meaning recently you have probably missed a lot of foundation that we put on if you're still struggling with malachi 4 you go on youtube or you see one of the deacons we will give you i already have a list that tells you because i remember when we preach about the king of hazaris we preach like 45 sermons i have all the theme of it so once we begin to work on the website we will put up the theme so if you have a struggle with something you can just go straight but i would strongly encourage you if you have time go back to the wood sermon and pick it up yourself so don't say it was daddy's fault it was the pastor's fault it was the deconform it is your own fault everything is in your lap if you have a struggle with makeup it's there you have a struggle with hearing it's there you have a struggle with high heel it's there you have a struggle with christmas it's there amen if you're still struggling with christmas in this message it is day it is on part 28 amen amen we prove to you that christmas is a hedonism clearly you say brother branham was doing this you need to read brother branham throughout his progression i ask somebody a question and say you are can you check the sound i can hear an echo somebody need to learn this pretty good when brother david is here if brother branham have a sermon preached in 1947 amen how much do you expect the brother brother to give you there how much so if you have a sermon in 47 and brother brother i'm saying we're going to have a christmas plane so you're going to stuck there i thought somebody has said if i'm travel overseas maybe one day or somewhere or maybe in europe and i find a church that only have this sermon i won't blame them if they only have this sermon here in 1947 and that's what they're using i'm not going to blame them but i'm going to bring them other coats so it's up to them to update or to upgrade themselves from 47 all the way to 65 but if they show you new codes and you still don't want to move with the progress of the message then something is wrong anybody care because brother branham have the first pool the second pole then the third pole and back here you gotta understand the progression of that but you cannot stick back there and say no christmas what do you want in christmas what else do you want in christmas what do you want gift even the coming down of the realm of abraham amen sure that jesus was born in april [Music] [Applause] you want to celebrate the birth of jesus christ [Music] he didn't even say for you to remember his birth [Applause] do you know the scripture he said remember his death not his birth anybody care not even his birth even by the zodiac he was aries because on the 25th he goes into the capricorn [Music] god brown he said then also they suffered or worshipped and respected the birthday of their son god that's where the 25th came from which was who you don't take the things of god and just swap him [Music] you need to worship god according to the place he wants you to worship him [Applause] if god said jerusalem everybody must travel to jerusalem you cannot say oh god jerusalem is too too far no no you can't say that anybody he said and it's when the sun from december the first until december the water the 25th it doesn't change it passes its water even in the zodiac it's wrong because the capricorn is a fish goat [Music] it's a creature that has a part of a fish and a part of a goat and goat brother branham says symbolizes denomination it's a denomination gospel those are the ones that want the christmas [Music] you still have a problem go to jeremiah 10. i'm just going to give you one but remember king of hazard is part 28 go listen to that don't blame anybody again in this message the the ammunition is laying there we will have youth meeting you only have few youth if you got 10 you're going to find seven where is the other three and then tomorrow we didn't understand about this we didn't understand about this and most of the time all the questions were ready always trying to blame somebody my father didn't do this my mother did you already grown up enough take your decision why you keep blaming your father why you keep blaming your mother you are growing up enough you can drive your car okay take your decision for jesus christ yourself there was a time that he was smoking daddy took his decision and stopped smoking why you don't want to take your decision keep going down my daddy i'm d i'm here like this because of daddy leave daddy alone leave mama alone you grown enough to take your own decision by 12 years old you can take your decision so don't be blaming somebody jeremiah chapter 10 you have the message you don't listen you have the quote you don't listen you have the bible you don't read you're on the facebook and what's up posting crazy stuff and tomorrow we were done we didn't know all about this where were you what were you reading you see two hours watching movies you can sit one hour listen to the prophet oh brother we stream ask the people who stream all the time ask them you will find many of them they are behind they are behind they are behind did you stream to the side no no no i was too busy i was too busy never busy to work paycheck verse 10 hear you the word which the lord speak to you it's a pastor or house if i burst your bubble that's very good i really like it because you will love me later i would never compromise in the word by god's grace because of you i will stick with what brother brad i'm saying it's clear why we don't get married like this i already preach about it you want to find another pastor amen hear you the word which the lord speak to you or house of israel thus says who learn not the way of the who what are the ways of the healing what are they okay come on and be not dismayed at the sounds of heaven for they hidden or dismayed them ever here watch verse 3 for the custom of the people are water what custom of vain what customer vein what customer then drinking water going to church what what is vain at the bible speaking for the custom of the people are vain for one cuts a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of a workman with the axe the decade with water and with water they fasten it with water and with water then it move not what how many scriptures do you want me to give you you still want this christmas tree we still want to take a picture with it it looks beautiful beauty is off the devil that's right if you see the devil begin to show you crazy stuff it means you're already at the lowest level did you hear me at the beginning he must make something beautiful once you are really deep in the kingdom then he can show you anything you can swallow it so when you watch pornography you know where you are you are really really really down because when you are up if you watch a woman just a little bit something in jesus name meaning you are somewhere but when you sit and you watch and you watch no no you are down don't play church you wake up and you say lord forgive me forgive me for doing this and i'm good that's why you keep falling on that spirit over and over and over and over you thought you were playing with a small demon where's five i don't know where this is coming from somebody need it they are upright maybe online somewhere they are upright as a palm tree but speak not they must need be born you you're the one carrying them because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do what say when the major came they found a young child they take a baby they put it with the major and you swallow you carry that you go you don't want spending money and taking that stuff and bringing that in your home you remember the antenna you can create an atmosphere in your home you yourself are pulling devils there was a freemason book i didn't read it somebody read it the first thing they tell you is begin to worship santa [Music] they want you to celebrate christmas why wait when we get to the goats for you who want to keep beard like a goat [Music] i'm going to go in the old testament and i'm going to show you what does goat mean [Music] do you know the two goats do you know that they were representing who why are they saturn is to using a goat head do you think they're doing that by any chance don't copy after stuff because everybody's doing that i'm doing it so nowadays the hair is going like this no no no before you copy that hair stop and say what is behind this hairstyle why is all the women doing this who started it watch where it starts check the spirit if everything is good fine if not you could be copying after hollywood because that's what everybody's doing all demands are doing like that why are they doing like that if independently you keep your burden while you want it fine praise be the name of the lord but don't do it out of fashion don't go do it because you were shaving yourself a certain way then suddenly you change and when i look i see every single drunkard all those the people that cusses they're doing the same thing the same thing the same thing they say and i'm wondering who are you copying after is this your normal style or you change it to be also in the time right modern so who are you following we are separate people i'm sorry man i don't like the devil i don't like the devil amen my blood and his blood don't get along [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and i don't like the devil bothering you because many people suffer out of ignorance everybody wearing tight paint you wear tight paint why do why why what comes up with thai paint you don't know why stop first and say why is everybody wearing titan we were wearing good good long long uh paint like this now the pants are here why they don't even look nice it's not even respectable why are they doing that who's behind that who's pushing that agenda if you begin to look discerning the spirit behind stuff you're going to get your hand off i can go down and continue to tighten and tighten and tighten until you feel like blessed be the name of the lord so we don't celebrate that amen if somebody's putting their christmas tree or something that's their problem not in this church amen we understand the problem we understand the prophet pretty pretty pretty good we know what brother branham say it's a hedonism amen you know rejecting jesus christ can be a very small thing like this and you find yourself in hell take the money give it to the poor he'll refuse in hell very easy i don't know what he was doing with his business in here you see what i'm saying you can cling on to something sometimes we make a big deal out of nothing why are you fasting in a marriage because she said this table need to be this way and this stable is this way and that's why you're fasting [Music] what a difference between this being this way or this way it is the devil about here and you look you say so all these bidding and all this yelling just because of that because if you look it's not really that it is self-will somebody have iron disposition and another one an eye on disposition and they want to prove their forces and the poor microphone or table is just a victim but it's not really that if somebody say i'm not going to let him do this and the other one say i'm going to show him the head and person no no i moved it no that's not the problem they need to break you like a horse [Music] hey let's go to the world let's go in isaiah 53. [Music] we got christmas what do you want just give me your your facebook account i'm gonna log and see you all merry christmas you the christmas [Music] i block the pastor he won't see me your friend will betray you the purpose [Music] that's not fair oh my if you see if you look at what obedience in god can do in your life you will rather obey god a long time ago [Music] that's why you think some other people it looks like everything they're doing in their life is working god is so good we have trial but we learn how to give him preeminence and everything is just flowing if something happened i'm just calm because i'm watching what is going on why is this happen i just sit quiet and suddenly it comes up because you give them preeminence easy it's not complicated yeah you're going to fast 20 years you don't understand it's just a very small thing like this did abraham first forgot to talk to him where they disciple fasting in the apparel you know what they were doing in april praising god and what happened in the due date in heaven deposit that's it all they told them go wait in jerusalem just go and wait in your brothers even just go and sit like this yeah just go ahead and sit like that [Music] isaiah 53 that's what they told neyman go dip yourself in a jordan he wants something hard if you tell somebody go this is what the denomination or specialize on they tell women go fast for 10 days you need to go in the wood for five days and you see people in the wood i even saw a message believer i mean a message uh pastor making his church war what do you call it sack sackcloth i can show you the picture if you want to in united state you don't believe me i can search for the for the picture and give it to you and you see people in sackcloth what are you trying to do god if god wanna when brother branham was born as a baby was he praying for the people of fire to come you think you were choosing god he was god who looked at you he said brother miki will believe the message uh where are my children one two three you go through brother mickey so you're going to get the message there sister loretta will believe the message load them there somebody they put him into a parent who is a drunker you're born and the parent are believing the message you should have tested the word and you want to come up with scars isaiah 52 who keep pulling like this verse six all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way do we see any exception here did they say whether it's jews or gentiles here how many people no exception anybody clear verse 6 and the lord has laid on him you might be seated the iniquity of us water so everybody gone astray and the scene of everybody put it in somebody christ remember last sunday amen verse seven he was oppressed do the best that you can even if you are streaming be in church as you see the day approaching it's getting pretty bad you playing with church amen he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth we know who that is philip explained the eunuch from ethiopia verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare what this man has a generation this man has he's his generation singular or plural singular okay so it's one amen who shall declare his generation for he was cut out cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken everybody let's go to romans chapter 2. we already touched on the city of refuge last sunday the high priest so get closer and we gonna take off quick roman chapter 2 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen for he is not a jew which is outwardly remember not the outside jew not the man the fleshly jew neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh so verse 28 is speaking about the outside man or the body but verse 29 he is a jew which is one inwardly hey and circumcision is that of though so there is two jews you can be a jew on the outside which none of us here is nobody here anybody or you can be a jew on the inside so if you fail the opportunity to be a jew on the outside there is only one opportunity left here the circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of man but of who go to chapter 6. and verse nine there is two jews there is a jew on the outside i ward you and we have an inward both of them are jews but the true one is the one inward you can be the one naturally and you still go to hell verse 9 knowing that cross being raised from the dead remember last sunday he had to be killed the high priest must die but he didn't stay there he had to be risen again knowing that christ being raised from the dead what dies no more it's just once anybody care death has no more dominion over him for in that he died he died to sin once but in that he liveth he liveth to who so we want the high priest to die but we still also want him to stay alive remember that sunday when he dies he's returning for your sin the high priest anybody here by death goes the atonement a bad care but when he stay alive there is a security anybody here because if he's just alive your sin is still talking your sting is alive you can be good inside the city but outside somebody can tell your story so we don't want no record outside no record inside the only way we can blot out the ordinances that was against us and nail thought ordinances in the cross the high priest must die when he dies he wipe all record amen amen and when you enter he is alive forevermore [Music] revelation chapter 1 the mystery of the sea of glass you see one piece of furniture what is coming out of it verse 18 if you dare you can say amen i am he that liveth and was and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of water forever this man will never die again he did it once because of you and me and once he's dead he's alive that said let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning thanking you for everything you are doing for us lord you walk each one of us this morning and maybe some struggle to come to church lord but you give them grace lord father to overcome that body struggle and they are here this morning father not to listen to a man but to listen to god lord we have done what we can do as far as a man that you're given an ability to read the scripture lord father but when he comes to interpret the scripture and to unfold the word and bless your children it's a work of the holy spirit that's why lord father we are humbling ourself lord and committing ourselves again once again unto the hand the speaker and those that are hearing lord may you move us completely out of the way may you be the one speaking and the one hearing and interpreting your own word lord father be the beginning and the end of this service as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen blessed be the name of the lord we are on the mystery of the sea of glass we're on part seven we're still dealing with the priesthood and once we finish with that we will get into the clothing of the priest amen and the reason why i say the clothing of the priest is because the scripture says here that on verse 12 and that shall bring aaron and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water ever here and that shall put upon aaron the holy garment anybody clear so there is a holy government that went over aaron first and anoint him and sanctify him that he may minister unto me in the priest office and that shall bring his son and clothe them with coats so if you look right here you will see that the clothing of aaron is different than the clothing of his son did you see that so we gotta find out whoa what are the clothing of aaron and why are those clothing different than the clothing of his son and what is the anointing that came upon iran and that same anointing is going to be upon his children but what we were dealing here we found the high priest to the levitical priesthood and the high priest have children that must benefit the same thing that he did before they entered their ministry and we found on last sunday that under melchizedek priesthood we also have another high priest and that high priest his name is who few people need to stay awake the high priest his name is who now with the revelation of the high priest we found out that that revelation goes with the problem of a seed everybody now we found out last sunday that there are two seeds of abraham there is a natural seed of abraham ever here and there is also a spiritual seed of abraham and the natural seed of abraham we found out that it was three categories the first was ishmael about here the second was isaac and the third was the sons of keturah which were six of them these sons were chased away ishmael was run away the one that remained which was the the son of a free woman was isaac anybody clear so far then we read on roman the bible says not not as though the word of god you need to keep your seatbelt has taken non-effect for they are not all israel which are of who so even though we're speaking about isaac not everybody that came out of isaac is israel of god they might be israel as far as the flesh but they are not children of god and paul continued he said neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in not isaac but in isaac shall that seed be called that's why we understood that isaac was not the seed but isaac was only a channel through which the seed shall come open romans chapter 3. hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord roman chapter 3. if you dare you can say amen romans chapter 3 verse 1 brother stephen abraham have ishmael disqualified abraham have keturah disqualify abraham have isaac disqualify what is the benefit of being a juden why verse one what advantage then has the jew ever now we okay don't sleep you can stand back there amen what advantage then has the jew or what prophet is there of circumcision if everybody is disqualified why being a jew amen verse 2 much everywhere chiefly because that to them were committed the oracles of god so paul is saying that the advantage of being a jew here the jews were the first people that god gave the law because the law only was a replica the tabernacle was a replica or a duplicate or a copy of the true priesthood so it is important to understand what happened through the jews that's why brother branham said that israel is god time peace if you want to understand god you need to understand what he did through israel that's why jesus said salvation is of the jew everybody so far job 2 verse 9 amen if there is an advantage watch verse nine what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before proof buff what and what both jews and gender that they are all under water everybody here everybody here so even if you are jew you follow me even if you are gentle paul is saying that we have proved to you that everybody is under sin anybody here in other words the children of god they claim to be a child of god doesn't lie on the color of your skin they claim to be a child of god doesn't lie on your nationality anybody here because when the realm was created remember that realm have no father no money anybody here there was no blood connection between the ram and abraham was not even blood connection between daruma and the realm that were in the flock of abraham everybody here that realm have a unique bloodline that never existed in the entire world even though he looks like another natural rhyme but he's a different species let's go to verse 10 as it is written there is no unrighteous anybody no not not one anybody here there is none that understand there is none that seek after god they are all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that does good no not one jews and gentiles here jump to verse 20. therefore by the deed of the law everybody clear there shall no flesh so the claim is not here anybody the claim is not here that's why people waste their time to watch to see if adam was a a white man or a black man or a yellow man it's a it's unnecessary the claim of god's children is not here it is not in the blood it is not in the nationalities there is a different claim because not all that are coming out of israel are children of god so even under the jews there not all the jews are the children of god so you can put claim on the jew so where is our claim going melchizedek therefore by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of god without the law everybody is manifested or revealed being witnessed by the law and the prophet anybody clear even the righteousness of god which is by faith not by the law of jesus christ to who to all and upon who and upon all them that believe for there is water no difference you can be complex when you see a jew anybody here jump to verse 23 for all have done water and come water short of the glory of water jews and gentile everybody sin we clear jump to verse 29 now is he the god of the jews only is he not also the god of the gentile what is the answer yes of the gentile water everybody seeing it is one god not two which shall justify the circumcision by faith that the jews and the circumcision the gentile through faith marquee do we then make void the law through faith paul is asking a question that now what you are demonstrating brother stephen is whether we are jew or gender he doesn't matter there is no difference everybody can go to hell or everybody can go to heaven depending on who is who so nationalities whatever bloodline have nothing to even if you were born in the lungs of abraham that have nothing to do with it because jesus looked at the jew and told them you say abraham is your father but let me tell you your true father you are of the your father there devil everybody here so paul is saying that now we have a question so because of this faith that we are preaching so the law means nothing now that's what he says he's saying do we then make void in other words do we nullify do we make void the law through faith because of this faith so let's abolish the law watch god forbid yeah we do water did you get that paul is saying that the faith the children of faith do you follow me actually they don't break the law did you get it the children of faith actually are the ones that live that law in other words the children of faith this faith is what makes you fulfill the law do you follow me they gave human beings their love without faith that's why they got in trouble now faith came so that through that faith if you take that faith automatically you're gonna fulfill the law let me go slowly go to roman father once i get here through then we come if you're there you can say amen that faith that we're talking about is a faith that gives you the holy ghost ever here watch romans 5 5 you there and hope makes not a shame because the water the love of god is shed abroad in our water by who by the holy ghost which is water [Music] god say love the lord lord god with all your heart with all your mind how are you going to love god [Music] because on the outside you have the black dog on the inside you have the black dog so by nature we are already enmity with god our nature cannot compar we are not compatible with god how are you going to love god anybody here so when the holy ghost come inside of you do you follow me the holy ghost is the one that brings the love of god inside of you but here that's why a man filled with the holy ghost will never stay at home [Applause] except with legitimate reason if the church is open but here because the one that make you love god the one that make you read the bible the one that make you pray they want that make you long for the message and listen to the message it is not you it is god in you [Music] everybody because if you take that man outside then the message is a burden then the message is a bunch of commandments then you are putting a skirt not by revelation but you are putting the skirt under the law [Applause] [Music] do you follow me you are taking off the earring not because god revealed to you but you are taking that because that is a religion but when the holy ghost come the love of god in your heart automatically is cleaning you up [Music] you won't force yourself to read the bible again you will feel somebody like something like i gotta read the bible you'll be sleeping on the bed and your eyes open up you look at the clock it's 3 am in the morning somebody woke you up [Applause] because he wants you to pray it is no longer you it is not you forcing to love your enemy [Applause] ever here because by human nature i foreign took for a truth but if you look at somebody you begin to love him despite what he did to you it is not true that's why brother branham said i was about to get the gun and shoot the bull until somebody come over and he begin to love the bull how can you love a bull that want to kill you this faith is what makes you fulfill the law this faith is what makes you leave the message of the hour ever ever here go to romans 13. my god amen that's why you see somebody leaving the message automatically everything is coming back something was not there something was not there amen you were fooling yourself we have man made the holy ghost if somebody is quiet by nature they want everybody that receive the holy ghost to be quiet like them if somebody is energetic by nature they want everybody that receive the holy ghost to be like them i don't need your holy ghost you don't need my holy ghost we need the holy ghost from heaven [Applause] you hear somebody you a christian so you're trying to do everything to please that person that's a good question no they're good question because they give you maybe money the day you have a problem with them they're not a good christian anymore go to roman 13 i was preparing something somebody's keep pulling everybody here verse 8 if you're there you can say amen so this faith make you fulfill the law everybody here verse 8 everybody here oh no man anything you owe somebody's their money and you keep building money on your bank account that's wrong get their money give it to them brother branham say when it comes to mortgage and stuff like that we understand but don't be having somebody else money and you say wait for the next paycheck i'm gonna give it to you get their money give it to them okay oh no man anything but water that's what you need to owe me you want to owe me something owe me love [Music] and you gotta pay me my love [Applause] you gotta pay me my love in this church some of you i don't know how much you owe me you see how christianity is easy ever here oh no men anything but to love one another for he that loveth another has done what [Music] everybody here for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten what so far let's go to verse 9 for this you shall not commit adultery the law you shall not kill the law you shall not steal the law you shall not bear false witness the law you shall not covet and if there is any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely you shall love your bro your neighbor as what paul is telling you all the tenth commandment do you follow me do not steal do not commit adultery do not do this paul say all of them are bundled up into one thing love if you love your neighbor you won't steal if you love your neighbor you won't gossip if you love your neighbor you won't commit adultery so but that love have to come by the holy ghost is he okay now watch verse 10 love works no water no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the water everybody but who gave you the love it's the holy ghost so this faith here is what makes you fulfill the law that's why the bible say i will write there my commandment in the heart so that they would do my way who's writing the commandment in the heart it's when the holy ghost is getting you he's bringing the love of god and automatically the law is no more a burden for you the law becomes your life amen everybody so far blessed be the name of the lord so we see here that in isaac that seed shall be called and then which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for water ever here so that was isaac now know ye therefore brother robert that day which are of faith now you understand faith the same are the children of who now you understand clear now and the scripture forcing that god will justify the hidden not the jews through faith preach before the gospel unto abraham saying indeed or nation it's not our nationalities be blessed so them there which be of faith you understand that faith now are blessed with faithful abraham now to abraham and his seed were the promises made and he said not he said not and to seeds bro as of many but as of one and to that seed which is who so the spiritual seed of abraham is christ ever clear but we showed you that christ is not one person amen christ is the high priest the high priest must have children everybody here all right when we talk about this seed since we started from a natural seed into a spiritual seed which is christ ever here the natural seed went through isaac but the true spiritual seed is jesus christ here the covenant also travel just like the seed brother branham say in a seed breath the old seed must die before the new one can be born so therefore death is hard anytime so it's painful it's distressful birth is the same because you are bringing life into the world it's painful both death and birth are painful jesus said to his word jesus said that his word was a seed that a sower went forth to soul now we are all acquainted with that and i want to teach this like a sunday school lesson because it's sunday notice then this world being a seed but remember the seed is only bringing forth a new life when it dies everybody okay [Music] that is the reason it was so hard for those pharisees to understand our lord jesus christ because they were under the law and the law was the word of god in seed form everybody but when the word was made flesh and become not the law but grace now grace and love cannot exist at the same time because grace is so far above law law is not even in the picture and therefore it's hard for the pharisees to die to the law so that grace could be born but it must go the two laws cannot exist at the same time anybody this went through the law this one came with grace everybody so we have a seed law and a seed grace but the two of them cannot exist together anybody here so that's why when jesus was introduced into the world he was not a high priest yet amen amen are we okay everybody okay he was god in flesh the priest was melchizedek but melchizedek was not high priest do you follow me everybody that's why when jesus came there was already there were already another priest present [Music] but there is a period of transition where we gotta push one high priest out to introduce the second high priest is everybody okay hallelujah where are you going my friend in matthew 8 verse 4 jesus said and jesus said unto him see that do see that tell no man but go that way show that self to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them so even when jesus was here jesus have to go to the temple everybody here when jesus hears somebody he said you go to the priest and go do what moses did about so they thought he came to destroy the law the bible said in matthew 5 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophet i am not come to destroy but to do what and to fulfill meaning that the faith here that brings the holy ghost that make you fulfill the law came through jesus christ everybody here but one priest must go hallelujah in gethsemane something happened brother branham said but in that great crucial hour until he suffered knowing all things until the water and the blood separated in his body and great drops of sweat like blood dropped from his bro he died more death in gethsemane than he did on the cross anybody here in gethsemane the cup was given to jesus christ here so jesus must receive the cup or reject the cup every kill ever here when jesus accepted to receive the cup of your sin do you follow me mercy said who was inside jesus christ pull off of him you follow me jesus became the high priest are we following if you're sleeping i'm not responsible brother branham said in the garden of gethsemane the anointing left him that's why he was crying my father my father not the word melchizedek mercy why have that forsaken me the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner he died as sinner you know not his sin but mine and yours that is where the love comes in how he took mine oh hallelujah how he took mine everybody cared so far brother branham continued he said the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friend he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that water melchizedek anointed the flesh here which was human water if he would have went up there as god he would have never died that kind of death you can kill god but he didn't have to do it but he remember he went there with you in him [Applause] anybody here everybody here because the high priest have his children everybody here god has never separated the bread from the groom yet everybody here so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both men and water everybody here ever here that's why this seed here is not one person adam and eve is one person anybody here if he was all redeeming that one body they are one same same water the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the water [Music] everybody here ever here so one melchizedek they pull off me and jesus stays there [Applause] [Music] do you follow me so when jesus was dying i was atoning my own sin [Applause] everything i did before everything i'd done and what i'm gonna do in the future i was pulling both of them like i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this [Applause] amen my god was the call of the elder of the city on the outside of the gate then he had to lift up a nissan boasts plugging off his shoes and declaring it before the elder of the city that he had with him who and in order to redeem or get wolf he had to redeem naomi and all that she had in order to get roof that is the reason jesus came to the jews alone he had to redeem the jews in order to get there [Applause] anybody care anybody care boys never got married to naomi [Applause] what kept him single all that time [Music] i thought he had a lot of money all the women in israel was watching him everybody here everybody here what the people saw is jesus is dying for the jews that was not the case somebody was in jesus christ [Applause] [Music] hallelujah what do you see you see what i mean he had to redeem her and there had to be a public testimony made and the requirement was death so god came down and leaving his own son and was laid outside the gates of jerusalem the principal city of the world at that time religiously speaking and there was lift up between heaven and earth before ever here the high water and all others to show that he has redeemed the church with his own blood everybody killed so far everybody cares so far why was he doing that because there is another generation [Applause] relax let me get to the generation other sheep i have everybody okay are the sheep i have which are not in this water where are those sheep where where is those sheep where were those sheep [Music] if i drop it do you give me time do you give me time go to matthew 27 don't blame me because some have small stomach they can't finish a hamburger everybody clear matthew 27 when they talk about their resurrection anybody clear verse 20 verse 51 are you there and behold the veil of the temple was ranked in two from the top to the bottom and the earth did quick and the rock went and the graves were water and all bodies of descent can i repeat again all bodies of the scent why they didn't sell all the bodies why because they were other bodies that were still on the ground [Music] did you get me he only picked up the old testament sent body because if he said if he was not specific you would have pop-up already there but you have to stay there until mama begin to eat food i will show you the mystery of those body one day many bodies of the scent which were left slept deep water if you notice not all the bodies of the santa rosa only many bodies because brother branham say that our bodies here were laying on the ground anybody here so the food that mama was eating mama was pulling your body from the earth and putting you there and back here then you come out and then from heaven you jump you enter the body so jesus could not pick up your body at that time there is another fold that are there i have not gotten to them yet we okay now we okay now a mass are the sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must it's a must i must bring and they shall hear my voice and that shall be amen we okay now watch where we going john chapter 11 now we got two high priests and back here in gethsemane jesus enter his high priest ministry so one have to go because both of them cannot be at the same time do you hear me so if he is a high priest they gotta take him to another high priest to see who is stronger ever here they're not gonna fight with fist they are fighting with the world everybody and one of them named who careful being there that's that same here say unto them you know nothing at all no consider that it is expedient for us that [Applause] that how many men one man should die remember the sacrifice is the tabernacle is the service that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish what oh caiaphas he's wise he makes sense he's now wise let's see who was talking verse 51 and despite him not of himself but being a high priest that year what advantage is the law because the high priest must testify the death of the the lamb being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that which nation was it watch again 52 and not for that nation only i'm reading your bible ever here not for that nation only but that also he should gather shallow shallow shallow the gathering will be shallow he should gather together in one the children of who that way what everybody here that's why brother bonham said you were in him but one high priest must go because the two cannot be on the same time and they let jesus say well to the high priest they didn't understand he was a high priest now and the two seed cannot work together that's why john said i must disquise and he must increase back here and with him well assembly all the chief priests and the elders in this crowd and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answer that nothing what is this which the witness against it but he held his water and he answered water do you know why because everybody was lying but here they gave them money to bring false witness when somebody is lying something about you don't say nothing just keep quiet everybody amen he said and and he heard his peace again the high priest asked him and say unto him our dad they crust the son of death because you ask me who i am now my mouth is going to open up and back here and jesus said i am and you shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the crowd of heaven then the high priest did water [Music] why didn't caiaphas fainted [Applause] why he didn't leave the room why did he have to rent his clothes while renting the clothes but stephen you got to detail why renting the clothes juana renting his shoes back here in leviticus 21 and he that is a high priest among his brethren upon whose head the anointing always poor and that is consecrated to put on the government shall not uncover his head nor do what everybody here remember the grace was far above the law so when the two high priests met together one disqualified himself [Applause] when a high priest read his club he disqualified himself recognizing that mercy zedek now is entering his priesthood [Applause] everybody okay now everybody okay so jesus christ made the end to the levitical priesthood romans 10 verse 4 and christ is the water you okay now christ is the end of the love for water king of selema to everyone that do what so when you come to jesus christ he stop the law if you are struggling with the message just get to christ that legalistic view of the message dies here the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching water by who king of peace therefore being justified by what king of righteousness we have what king of peace with who through whom because he is melchizedek [Music] who has bed buff one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between water it's no more jews and gentiles all of them are my children christ made the end to the law brother stephen if jesus christ is the high priest now under melchizedek so whatever melchizedek was jesus must be everybody okay hang on king of selem i'll just show it to you he was out jesus is our peace anybody here sell him peace jesus is our peace and priest of the most high we already seen him as a priest he isn't even a high priest here who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the king and bless him we know he gave him bread and wine anybody here to whom abraham gave the tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness we saw it and after that king of salem king of peace he is our peace with our father without water [Music] so there is immortality with this man without beginning of days no ending of life let's go a little bit you ready the bible says in hebrews 7 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death you understand this now but this man because he continued forever has an unchangeable what wherefore he is able also to serve them to the other most that come unto god by him seeing he liveth to make it a session for if melchizedek have no beginning of days no ending of life and he is immortal and eternal and the realm that abraham created no father no matter we must find the same in jesus christ you ready now hebrew chapter one verse one god who extends your time and diverse manner spec in tampa unto our father by the prophet has in this last day spoken unto us by his water so right here it looks like paul is saying we have god and we have prophets everybody here and among the prophets jesus also comes as a son and he is also a prophet he looks like god and jesus everybody by his son whom he has appointed hair of all things by whom also he made the water so if this son is not like this prophet okay this sun is a heir of everything that god have and matter of fact when god was creating the universe god was creating the universe by his son do you understand now you understand now it looks like it's god and the son but paul is saying he said no when i say son this son is different than what you think this son is the man true through whom god created everything and he owns everything that god has somebody's still struggling verse 3 this son who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his water is he really a son philip when you see me you see the mind everybody here come back here and uploading all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purge our sin sat down on the right hand of majesty on high everybody being made so much better than what now he's higher than angel as he has by inheritance obtain a more excellent name than water [Applause] we okay now relax for unto which of the angel in other words tell me who which of the angel said he at any time die out my water this day have i water everybody here anybody here have i begotten means something that was insane about here ever begotten thee and again i will be to him er and he shall be uh oh brothers even you see it father and son relax and again when he brings in the first begotten into the word he say and let all the angel of god do what if he is different than the father why do they worship him ever here watch carefully [Music] you can freeze at this time hallelujah you can freeze at this time da oh lord in the beginning who is the lord ever here who is lord god is talking and god is saying to the son he said you lord. hallelujah that's why when jesus christ the pharisee were traumatizing him with a lot of questions he says let me ask you a question when david say the lord say to my lord who who of the two is the lord everybody here so now god is talking to somebody and he said you lord yes but here the lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heaven are the words of the hand everybody you son they shall perish the heaven and earth but that do what so this son doesn't die everybody here and they all shall what's old as do a garment and as a vesture shall that fold them up and they shall be changed but they are there and that year shall not work [Applause] here so their immortality is not only to the melchizedek but that immortality was crushed to himself i'm going somewhere ever here first timothy 6 that that keep dick's commandment with that spot are rebukable until the appearing of our lord thank you who is this jesus christ which in his time he shall show who is there jesus christ an only [Music] potentiate and and who only has what i thought he was melchizedek that have immortality everybody okay now everybody okay him and melchizedek are like hand and gloves here he has who only there is nobody else it's only him i thought a melchizedek was god with that beginning with that and now jesus christ is the only one that has immortality so who is god who is jesus ever here who only has immortality dwelling in the water oh jesus begin to dwell in the light i thought in the old testament he was jehovah dwelling in the light that's why when paul met him in the road of damascus the pillar of saiyan he said lord in other words jehovah who are you jehovah say paul i am jesus [Music] [Applause] dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be glory and power everlasting a man so jesus is fulfilling this immortality anybody care but stephen not only is he immortal but he have power of resurrection thank you my brother what are you saying buddhist people therefore do my father love me that's why the pharisee their head was spinning because i laid down my life anybody here that i may take it again because he's immortal but here no man taket it from me but i lay it down on myself this is jesus christ i have power to lay it down anybody here you want to see who you are if he's doing this and i have power to take it again this commandment have i receive it of my who so jesus can take his life and drop a day and then tomorrow he comes and pick it up again jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in water god will raise it up who's going to raise up the temple [Music] ever here for us the father has led have life in himself so has he given the son to have life in his water jesus said unto her i am the water and the water he that believes me though he went dead he shall water that's why he can stand and say lazarus come out [Music] [Applause] where are we going brother stephen where are we going brother stephen melchizedek gave abraham bread and wine let's see what jesus did about here matthew 26 and as they were eating jesus took water and bless it and break it and gave it to the disciple and said take it this is my water and he took water and gave thanks and gave it to them and said drink all of this for this is my water the blood of the new have you seen anybody doing this have you seen jeremiah doing this the one who did this in the old testament that brought bread and wine is melchizedek and since then everybody quiet but when jesus came he took bread and wine and begin to give it to the people everybody here back here which is shed for many for the remission of sin but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my water [Applause] so when we go to the heaven we're going to have communion [Music] everybody here and when they had sung and water they went out into the mount of water that's why we sing in the lord's supper hallelujah remember this time the communion has never been instituting not until before the death of jesus christ hundred and hundred and hundred of years later but melchizedek after his chad abraham has won the victory melchizedek met him and gave him what wine and bread showing that after this earthly batter is over we will meet him in the water and take the communion and it will be the wedding water i will not drink no more of the vine or eat the fruit until i eat it and drink it with you and you in my father's water bread and one check are we okay if you were sleeping wake up you ready watch something here i want all of you to wake up if somebody was sleeping in hebrews 7 they say melchizedek is a man whose descent is not counted from them everybody he whose dissent descent is not counted from them receive path of abraham and bless him the head the promise in other words when you take the jew genealogy you follow me and you check melchizedek you will never find him the descent the image of melchizedek he doesn't lie on the jews you follow me you cannot take the blood of melchizedek and see a jewish son because the jewish were disqualified the gentiles were disqualified all of us have seen and come short of the glory of what mercy that have neither beginning of days no ending of life he's immortal and his lineage the children of melchizedek you cannot trace them in the genealogy can i repeat again can i peter ben the high priest aaron have his children aaron enter into the high priest and introduce his children to get the benefit now we find our high priest our high priest is jesus christ but jesus is not alone jesus have his broth here here and deborah and then jesus is a priest after the order of melchizedek he have no beginning of death no ending of life he is immortal about here and the genealogy of melchizedek which was reflected in jesus christ you cannot trace it among human beings take my few chapter one all of you please matthew chapter one let me see where i am at we found right on top take matthew chapter one if you dare you can holler amen who shall declare anybody here verse one you there the book of water how many generation is there according to matthew 1 verse 1 there is a book of the who shall declare his generation anybody here the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of who the son of who why only those two people why they didn't say jesus the son of so-and-so they say jesus the son of david david and abraham who received the promise to bless everybody the father of us all eberkia the father of as all america they said jesus the son of david and the son of who david was a king david was a prophet and david was behaving like a priest king prophet priest ever here a prophet is called son of man a king is called son of david and the priest is son of god the generation one generation of jesus christ the son of and the son of who stay awake let's go verse two abraham that's where they start remember god preached the gospel to abraham for seeing that the hidden will be blessed through the faith so now when we start the generation of jesus christ we didn't started from adam [Music] did you see adam there normally we should start the book of the generation adam adam begat said but when they start the book of the generation they started from abraham everybody here but abraham we know that the problem of abraham is his faith everybody here watch carefully now verse two abraham father isaac and isaac father jacob let me stop there jump to verse 17 so this will be easier on you anybody here so all the generations plural everybody seen that all the generation from abraham to who oh what i want you all to stay awake from abraham to 14 how many generations do we have what is number 14. slow down i don't want you to get lost anybody here verse 17. so all the generation from abraham to david are 14 generation and from david until they're carrying away in babylon or how many generation so we get the first the beginning abraham one number two david number three the caring to babylon caring to babylon everybody here the caring to babylon is what how many generation so if we start abraham will be number one death it will be number one number 14. anybody okay then we start from the son of david up to this one will be 14. everybody okay relax i'm reading your bible verse 17. so all the generation from abraham to david our 14th generation and from david until they're carrying away into babylon our 14th generation and from there carrying a way into babylon to who uh how many generation so our last stop here is crust do you see any more seed after that do you see any more generation he stopped at christ the generation disappear he started abraham in which christ and they've closed the book of the generation oh so where am i at where are you at because when you look you start by abraham everybody have their name there abraham begat david david got this this then it stopped jesus christ and the clothes they say this is the generation these are the children of god that we know and we close if you are not there something is wrong did you hear me did you hear me from abraham to david how many generations from david to the carrying away how many generated generation and from there from the carrying away which was under jeconiah from the carrying away all the way to christ how many generation so jesus christ must be number one number 14 14 then you start again 1 14 which is the conair then you start again 1 14. everybody care why 14 brother branham says this he said and the lamb was tested and was kept up for 14 days are we okay that's why i told you to stay awake that was two sabbaths or what one for the jews which they offered the lambing tap one for the water who has the real lamb the gentile who has the and all of them was made perfect by believing this lamb would come but he was tempted or examined how many days so we found 14 days according to brother branham it takes the edges of the jew and the gentile and combine them together so 14 days is a number of a complete circle amen everybody here so when we go from abraham to david the first circle is completed when we go to david from the caring of babylon the second circle is completed and the scale in the way of babylon to christ the third circle is completed because god is perfected in [Music] are we okay are we okay let me verify okay but before i verify let me help you with something jump again to verse 18. now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was engaged to joseph before they came together she was found with a child of the water so who gave mary the pregnancy does the holy ghost have a seed anybody here we found a woman by the name of mary they say mary have a child a baby the baby is jesus christ but the father of this baby is not joseph the father of this babies who [Laughter] everybody okay everybody okay the father is the holy ghost what are you trying to say about that hang on and i'm heading today and i'm going to job anybody clear jesus was the blood of god a created blood cell remember the realm of abraham remember he was neither jew no gentle he was god the bible said we are served by the blood of god not jewish or gender the created blood that is what if he was a jew my faith is gone if he was a gentile my faith is gone because all have sinned all are disqualified he was god he was the immortal god manifested in flesh that he created that he created a bloodshed and made his own body amen that makes the devil tremble and run [Music] why does this make the devil tremble why you know that the blood of jesus christ jesus was naked jew he was not gentle so he makes the devil tremble why so just knowing that make the devil tremble hang tight and work here that put him on the move when you see the real genuine thing praise the lord what is the real genuine thing then all i've seen you say is jesus was not jews and gentiles brother branham said if you see the real thing in other words if you understand the real meaning of that it will make the devil run away what is the meaning of this god manifested in flesh he is the blood of god therefore the life come from the germ help me up a little bit my brother hang tight whether we are white brown yellow black it does not make a bit of difference to him i'm trying to make you see something we all come from one person adam each one of us whether we are white brown black or yellow we could transfuse blood to each other and save each other's life by a blood transfusion but i am so thankful that one come who was made different from all of us anybody here there is no claim nobody can claim jesus the jews cannot claim him the gentile cannot claim him anybody and through the transfusion of his blood we live forever the lord jesus was neither jew nor gender he was god god's own blood was in him he was a created blood was not through any man the holy spirit of a shadow mary and she conceived and brought forth jesus christ the son of god the blood coming from the water was god's own water that was neither jewish blood or gentle blood it was the blood from emmanuel's water so we are so thankful for that [Music] what are you trying to say everybody here they say degeneration the book of degeneration of who jesus christ the first one was abraham a jew david a jew jacob and i are a jew but jesus christ doesn't belong to their genealogy did you hear me melchizedek his genealogy you cannot trace it among human beings anybody here so by this we can find that jesus doesn't belong to this jewish genealogy because the blood of jesus christ was not from a jewish father abraham has human blood david has human blood for him from his father jacob and i have human blood but jesus christ brother branham said god created the sperm and the egg and mixed them together and brought the blood of jesus christ it's a blood that doesn't belong to any nation [Applause] amen so the genealogy of jesus christ cannot be traced human speaking did you get it okay 14 14 14. let's verify and i'm going to let you go home let's go to chapter two now hey i want you to holler so whoever is sleeping will wake up everybody here abraham one anybody here verse two abraham father isaac two and isaac father jacob you're not hollering at me and jacob father judas thor and his brethren and judah's father ferez of zerah of who we found a woman noticed there tell me was tema jewel and gentile gentile was mary a jewelry gentile let's continue amen fairest was which number five amen and pharaoh's father ashram everybody here one abraham father isaac one and isaac father jacob and jacob father judah and judah father ferez and pharaoh's father esrom and face from father aaron and aaron father amin adaba and aminadab father nation and nation father salmon and salman father boss of rabb another woman keep tender rehab was there the jewelry gentler let's continue boras was number 10 and boy's father obed who another woman a word you are a gender the book of a generation of jesus christ here so we found that obed was eleven and no bad father jesse what and jesus father who everybody here how many do we have it should be fourteen anybody care you start from abraham one all the way to david 14. hey back here are we okay or do you want me to repeat it okay 14 this is verified if you take abraham you added abraham to david 14. america this is correct what i want to show you there is three women here genta one is a jew let me continue again let's go now and just say david and david okay and david the king father solomon we start again one of her dad had been the wife of who another woman there what's her name bad shaver a woman jew or gender bathsheba was a jewish gender he was a wife offer you right at the high tide a water four gentle woman and the fifth one is a jew why for gentle women are we okay hang on and i dropped the brain are you there it has been done in all ages but mary believed god and she said behold the hands made of the lord she believed the word how is she going to heaven she know that hagar had a baby by sex desire with abraham and sarah had a baby by sex desire with abraham children of promise the bones woman and the free woman but her here she is asked to believe no more sex it is of faith here that is a contribution to the faith that was in abraham who believed the impossible as long as god said it so that makes it work so every single woman sex desire marry faith everybody here brother adam say you see the samaritan was actually from my last sermon was edgar a perverted time the jews was what was the sarah height and the gentile is of who the royal seed abraham royal seed mary tapped the gender because of her faith [Music] everybody because she believed something that is impossible and never happened before it is the same thing abraham did so number one gentile two gentile three gender four number of deliverance gender fifth grace seed of faith are we okay are we okay hallelujah give me a few minutes and i'll let you go everybody clear mary was not the seed she was only the carrier she was only the shack to the seed the two other were carrier of life only natural seed agar and the other one mary was not the seed herself but like faith in god's word brought a more real image of the word because he was the word but like the shack of white a corn of wheat the shack hold the wheat inside of it and protect it until it's able or matured to go on its own then it was the seed itself that left her just like the seed was in her womb she was not the seed she didn't produce the seed god is the seed now the blood then many people think that it was jewish blood that we were saved by and some of them said well we got a right through the gender because who a woman there and roof moabite and so forth they were gentle you have no claim at that at all neither one he was neither jew or the fact that these women were gentile here give us no claim because the blood comes from the man but he was telling us there is something with the gentiles and mary showed that what really will come through the gender it doesn't have anything with sex it comes by faith by believing the impossible ever here so where are we in this generation where are we over here we check we found 14 generation and our names are not there you okay you want to go home let me finish this and you go home let's go back again hey mark here verse six jesse begat david the king david the king father solomon one everybody here verse seven and

do with a trace about genealogy [Applause] are we okay let me feel this now we understand that abraham seed was not the literal sexual seed through sarah which was israel which was isaac which was a nation but the royal seed was the promise which was who number 14 he complete the circle and through that seed he wears up a roll of water oh my we are a royal water a royal what a holy word offering
