i didn't know how far i was going but it ended up being 15 20 minutes away but i took them and it just stood out to me that 20 24 pumps at that gas station they might have all been filled there was a busy gas station at that point but yet something stood out and he saw something in me he chose to ask me and then also i the times just didn't didn't work out i mean it should have put me here at like

need me to do this i don't know why but you need me to do this so he went he was talking to me pouring out his life um i guess because i made the comment of having to be at church this evening he just he started talking to me and telling me things and he just asked that we remember him in prayer tonight so we'll remember don um in prayer tonight just for his situation and uh but it was just my testimony was that we were able to get here on time even early we got here like 7 15 and i just did not see how i was going to work but god made a way and i'm grateful for it so we'll just praise him

lord i look over the land and sea pondering the prophecy things that are to be and how they pertain to me i see the junction of time we're in man's destroying himself again but by the vision of the word i see ashes on everything he'll never forsake his own before the first bomb force will be gone to the other dimension traveling faster than the speed of light the same way those angels came that

evening [Music] oh [Music] before we [Music] we [Applause] [Music] as we invite our pastor oh we exalted we exhausted oh lord one more time [Music] we exhausted we exhausted lord amen we exalt him tonight praise the lord amen amen amen for the miracle we have two amps now and it sounds pretty good for me praise the lord and it's a miracle to see those musician chairs being filled praise the lord hallelujah god working in a mysterious way tonight it's another surprise but it's not really a surprise he's our local minister here it's an elder a veteran and we owe him a lot of respect it's brother kelly glenn before we invite him i came across this code after preaching sunday i didn't know it brother branham say in the message is preached on 56 on april the 4th paragraph 13 the infallibility of god's spoken word if i'm not mistaken brother branham says that now the hebrew prophets the two major themes and practically from somewhere along in every chapter of the bible from genesis to malachi you can find one of those subjects being dealt with all the way to the bible the coming of the messiah that's the first one and the anointing and sending forth of the church into all the world so brother branham said from genesis to malachi if you check you'll find two subjects being dealt with the coming down of the lord jesus christ of the messiah and then the sending fourth of the church all over the world so number one it's a preeminence of god in christ and number two is the preeminence in the church brother branham continues he says that it spoke of in symbols and by animals and so forth and like great armies and so forth that march is on and runs over the wall and so forth of different like locusts and everything was in symbols and parable and straight teachings and everything come down to those two subjects so when you see armies marching all over the wall it's speaking about the bride of jesus christ i didn't have this code but we show you that the army that was going around jericho was the bride of jesus christ in each age one time one time one time then in the last stage we go seventh time because we have seven mysteries that must be unfold so we have brother glenn kelly tonight who will be preaching for us we got new amps he sounds good so brother k preach the house down let's sing only believe oh libby [Music] all things are possible [Music] believe only believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] only believe lord i believe [Music] so [Music] you know when we come in you recognize what the lord is doing and uh you know the lord said give them their props while they're here before we take them home you know no man can't minister like that it's the holy ghost that's anointed a man to minister that for his people in the end time is that right god is moving in a miraculous way he's moving in an anointing like he's never moved before is that right because he saved the best for last his bride of jesus christ [Applause] sit on you know i tell them i come here i'm just you know done it's a spare time you know they give you a donut and they give you a spare tire with these cars today right well i'm glad i'm not a donut okay i'm a spare tire because the spare tire can do to have the same anointing and bring the same anointing that a regular tire can bring right huh so we recognize here there's the same holy ghost is that right he just bursted dispersed in it in different ways but i tell you i'm excited i tell you i'm so excited because those messages that have been coming that i didn't talk to brother steve but those messages that have been coming say we wrestle not against flesh and blood but we wrestle against principality and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places you know we are fighting against some influential demons i'm not talking about something light i mean god has given us the word victory to face those devils when the devil came to me you see you understand what we said accepted i sat down in the face of someone that tried to switch malachi 4 on me i sat down in the face of someone trying to tell me a different revelation of of 10 um revelations 10. i'm seeing these demons are out there so i'm telling you this word is not light it's going out all across the world right now people are sending it out so it's a war going on and god has this message tonight it's very appropriate is that right because the cardinal minded cannot cannot receive what god is doing right now is that right hallelujah the devil knows he's in trouble tonight hallelujah hallelujah [Music] come in the house of the lord huh i want to try to deform god's word but god had a ram in the bush is that right hallelujah huh see norman he told us before we get started here by the grace of god you know always i want to read this before we read the word it's just a little uh quote in the note that i saw here and i thought it would be good it's appropriate thank you musicians and it says always pray to have eyes that see the best in people a heart that forgives the worst a mind that forgets the bad and the soul that never loses faith in god so we're going to be working in that faith area tonight we're going to get started by the grace of god let us bow let's pray lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you for the opportunity to come before such a precious group lord god father we come asking you to give us all lord god for anything that we said or done or thought of lord god but we thank you lord god for your precious servant we thank you for your people lord god we thank you for the opportunity to come before your bride your precious wife lord jesus because father we look into the hill to where our strength and our help cometh from lord jesus we know lord jesus you have something for us tonight because father we the enemy tried to bring in the stumbling block lord jesus but we know the footsteps of the righteousness ordered of the lord and that means you are here before us the angel of the lord is here lord god to see that the word come forth for each and every one of your children and those that are listening in lord god bless them bless their families lord god and we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory remember the sick commitment is shut in remember those that have loved ones that are incarcerated lord god have mercy upon their souls also and those that are on their jobs lord god perhaps that are listening in the lord jesus we ask you to touch the heart give him a word of grace so now we bind up every demon force in the name of jesus christ and bring every spirit under subjection lord god and father perhaps father someone is lying streaming lord god listening in and they're still undecided which way they want to go lord jesus perhaps they have a question lord god but only you can answer it so we ask you father have your way and i remove myself out of the way so we thank you in jesus name we pray amen and amen there you go at uh james we're gonna look at the let's look at uh i'll tell you what let's go to matthew first matthew 21 matthew 21 like i got my well that's right here y'all gonna pray with me for an hour because i got to work tonight so i'm going to need your prayers is that right huh god is able to give us the strength that that we need so we thank the lord is it it's it's really a blessing you know those that don't know me i'm brother kelly normally i bring it out in the prisons and jails and the highways the byways and but the lord you know he has left me here and gave me grace tonight so you all be praying with me and um god has for each and every one of us what we come expecting matthew 21 and uh 21 it says jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not jesus shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask and what in prayer now keep that in mind in prayer we're working with prayer tonight okay we're working in prayer tonight you know the prophet of god said and that is one of the most powerful things that god had given me confession is that right he said the holy ghost is that right and he also included prayer in there is that right we're going to look at tonight we're getting ready to bust the devil in the head because when you're in the war you gotta have a prayer life you gotta have a prayer a prayer life of confidence you gotta have a prayer in life you know that god hears your prayers is that right that's why we know we praying do we already have we're rejoicing because we already have our building is that right we already have our building we already have our finances we don't speak because god said if your word abide in me and i abide in you whatever you ask you shall receive we don't ask him how he's going to bring it we know he's going to bring it is that right so we give him praise we give him honor we give him glory let's turn to james and then i appreciate your patience for standing let's turn to james chapter five hallelujah i just love coming in the house with the lord now you're out there warring on all day you know sharing this precious gospel and fi let's look at verse 13 for the sake of time 13 it says in any among you afflicted let him what let him let him pray you may be seated he said then let him pray is any mary let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the of the church and let him pray over him anointing him with oil in the name in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sins they shall be forgiven you know may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you know i mentioned here brother branham hit this scripture twice under the message if you want to pull it up it was 11 6 53 it was do ye noun believe and it was they also 3 2 54 the resurrection of jairus's daughter and so right then he used those two scriptures when he was pointing this out and it kind of pricked my heart so you pray for me there's only the third time we're looking in this area here now but we're looking at our topic tonight is going to be your confidence do do you have pr do you have confidence in your prayer do you have confidence in your prayer so now the first thing he said he said you pray is that right over there do you pray so when he come around and now god is building this house god is building a spiritual house and we have to understand them now you pray when you're walking you pray on your knees you pray when you're in the shower you pray when you're on your job you pray when you're when you're riding you're praying without ceasing is that right you're always talking to the lord so you know sometimes we want to look at this hair lord do ye have confidence in your prayer in the prayer of faith then we going to before we get before we take off because once we're going to just read the context and god's going to bring the rest of it is that right i'm just getting myself out of the way god is having many good ministers to the brothers come through here brother chisholm and the brother last week um i'm trying to think his name but but the cross yeah i tell you the lords have been ritually blessing his people is that right you're coming you're pulling on the gift of god you press your way out to the middle of the week and god has not failed you all you have to do and i say it as a testimony and it's a mark in heaven every place that my wife and i go to fellowship or where we went to we would always pray before we come into the assembly and god always met us there he always met us there you see because he's the author so we're going to look at some scriptures tonight so get your pencil in your pens or your paper or those that got good memories god bless you help me out i need some youth is that right yeah because we're getting some soul food here tonight is that right so i got my clock right here don't worry about it i got to work tonight i'm going to get you out of here in a decent time but we're going to walk out here with something is that right that we're going to knock the devil out and then you're going to come to another level let's look at this here we got some comments here it says look at the comment i wrote these things down i won't get a chance to go through all all this because i tell you i was just having a good time with the lord just me and him into i invited him in my room okay and we have come into this house to magnify the lord and worship him not only comes in the building he's entering us is that right huh so we're saying hey look at this comment before we take off he said there's one thing carefully to be observed here see this take two times i looked over this scripture for a long time missing and finally pricked my heart this is a prayer of faith it's a particular prayer and with this particular prayer it carries great authority great authority look what he says he said there's one thing carefully to be observed here that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil but to the prayer it said prayer over the sick must proceed from and be a company with a lively faith it has to be a lively faith it can't be foreign it can be hypocrisy because we're going to show you what's going on in this one scripture there's a lot in this one scripture where did i get to it but we're going to let the holy ghost have his way he says now look he said there must be faith both in the person praying and then the person prayed for he said now and if he had committed he said sin is somebody it is both the root of sickness and the sting of it it's just sin he said now he said if sin be pardoned either affliction shall be removed in mercy or we shall see there is mercy in the contents of the itch you see what i'm saying now let's turn to hezekiah isaiah 38 let's look at hezekiah isaiah 38 write it down and i was going to quote it but let's turn to it i want you to see he had confidence in his prayer i'm sorry uh uh what did i say isaiah yeah thank you you know he had confidence has given us in this hour here and now now we know that hezekiah his father was coming down and he put up groves and different things and idols they was worshiping there but hezekiah 90 came he was the righteous king but now the child was about to die is that right but when hezekiah was about to die on the sickness and we're going to show you how he had confidence in his prayer no matter what his condition had nothing to do with the promise the condition had nothing to do with the situation the condition we don't look at the condition we keep our eyes on what god has promised is that right look what he says hezekiah's healing he said in those days hezekiah is sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of emma eldo came unto him and said unto him thus saying the lord set thy house in order for thou shall die and not live he said then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and then what ah huh tell me we're going to get somewhere tonight we're going to be able to help someone they're going to be able to move to another level help us lord he said he he prayed unto who the lord see the prayer of faith that you pray with the lord that's a vow a vow that you and the lord has together not if it's going to come to pass it will come to pass [Music] a couple stories he says and said remember now oh lord i deceive thee how that i walk before thee in truth and with a perfect heart he come around in there lord i'm always pray i've read your word i've witnessed for you lord i came i pressed my way out to the service lord you have a heavenly bank that you got money into hezekiah has a heavenly bank that he knew that he could go to and he knew he could get god's grace is that right and hezekiah god will change his word but he's not going to change his way for anything he will change his word for a purpose is that right he saw that the kingdom everything israel was not restored yet is that right so he looked and he recognized lord i need some more time i can't see israel what's going to happen to him we're just paraphrasing it look and see what he was saying here he was not crying out for himself but he was crying out for the people of god he said the people who sigh and cry for the abomination for the condition of the land that's who i'm going to seal [Applause] brother do i need to sit still i can't help it hallelujah boy i'll try my best help me lord he said now look maybe i'll take my jacket off and help me stand still huh hallelujah i don't know that now huh i tell you the lord just been so so good at so much hallelujah he said but look he started pleading his case to god he had right to plead his case to god he had confidence in his prayers to god this wasn't a time because he knew that many times before when he went into the temple when he went in those places he knew that he went into the house of the lord when he went into the house of the lord he didn't fail to testify for god he didn't fail to praise god he didn't fail to worship god he did not fail to take care of people hezekiah knew he had right he didn't go into the heavenly bank you had right to go to the heavenly bank you've been labored by the grace of god when your body didn't want to turn around when god told you to get up three o'clock in the morning he got up three o'clock in the morning he started praying he started commuting with god when god needed things to go visit and help someone you went and visited someone you got he said when i was sick you did what you visited me when i was in prison you visit me when i was in cold you clothed me is that right when i was hungry you fed me you got right to go to the heavenly bank whoever you put on that list don't look at the condition of your family members you can pray to god ah yeah he said now look he says the perfect he said lord i came with a perfect heart and they came with your covenant agreement lord god i was at peace with your covenant agreement god i was with the agreement the lord of what you shared was to do lord what you shared for me to do lord god i tear down i tore down the groves lord god i tore down the images lord jesus he came back he said and that which is good in thy sight and has a kind of wept what sort he just didn't get there some of you got to realize that when you're in a real need when your family members is in need when somebody there is sick you got to get down there lord god in the name of jesus christ father i've come to your throne lord god i come father because my father is healed lord jesus i come lord god because my smother is real here lord god father i come to you because my brother my sister my uncle my lord god they possess with demon forces father a fervent prayer of a righteous man a veil of much you got to labor we're going to show you but you're not laboring by yourself we don't want to get ahead of ourselves huh i want to show you the holy ghost is our what our helper the holy ghost is our what is our comforter the holy ghost says he said now look he says then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus save the lord the god of david the father i have heard thy what prayer he said then and you want to see why that prophet of god said what are you saying we forfeit we forfeit the mighty power we forfeit something that god has greatly given to us see i was looking i was telling my wife that you know thanksgiving is good but living thankful is better you see because the grace it demonstrates that you that you're grateful of what the lord have done for you look what he said hallelujah and said unto hezekiah it said i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thee thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee in this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city he got his confirmation right there he could have said lord if it wasn't for you put me in that position you could have took me home right now lord but hezekiah was the one that was chosen to do what to bring god was going to use for the deliverance hallelujah look what he says a prayer a prayer to god it's a vow it's a vow to do and god has made there together it says sometimes sometimes praying the prayer of faith is like securing the promise of god you're securing the promise of god we got a few things down here that we wrote down they said the the prayer is the most most powerful weapon god gave to humans see i know i know the message theologians is out there they're going to say where you say the most powerful weapon he gave was confession he said the most powerful weapon that he gave was on the holy ghost see all these things was quote but you got to go dig see i'm learning that sitting there running my pastor now you got to go dig and see and see what he's really saying ah see i love it i got tired of going around the wall i got tired of going around the wall i needed something to take me here though huh and the only thing trevor could take you here the revelation of the word is that right who could have sat upon any teacher like paul then paul paul set up on the chameleon where paul is set up under community information is good information is good but information is not revelation you are getting revelation you are getting revelation ah the devil's scared of you i'm telling you scared of you huh some people say it's hard some people don't want to go to another level see when someone's coming in you know what a godless sorrow a godless sorrow in the gala repentance is that is that you have to now really omit you know i thought the scripture meant this over here ah but i found out the holy ghost came to correct me and told me it means this over here [Applause] i love that is that right that's what god is bringing here that's what god is bringing unto you if you if you if you don't have this ministry this ministry what god has brought in this end time because that's what we are contending for turning the hearts the hearts of the father back there to the children is that right so when it came in that's what peter was saying when peter was came in there peter was contending for the faith that he is based what both lord and christ is that right he's coming in so peter had to tell them religious demons see the religion look like you're being hard sometimes they might think brother steve said no no no no no no no no when you see a man stand up there and he goes ah that means god done showed him something and i want to know what god showed him you know why it's because his confidence builds my faith that means he believes what he's talking about he knows what he's talking about we can't possibly go in these areas unless god give us grace to go in his head that's why it's such a mess huh hallelujah see paul had all the kids that's why he said the letter killer but the spirit gave his life that's why he says that you are what born again put on the whole arm of god the arm of god is the word of god by the anointing of god is that right and anybody can't have don't say it part of what the prophets say say oh what the prophet said ah he said you got to be he said you got to be called by god you got to be appointed by god you got to be anointed by god you got to be the word of god you got to be the man of god it's who god chose ah i tell you when you look at that's why david come to him when goliath came in he said you're uncircumcised philistine you come and try to do what to defile the army of the living god see when you go around in there if you dig into it what he was telling me come to deform the word they messed up the rankings that's why he couldn't produce what it was supposed to produce they wanted him their way see as the holy ghost said the other day they tried try to put it on the prophet's son no no no no no no no no the prophet exposed that good in romans 1 8 he says saul no he told him he said samuel samuel don't worry about it samuel when saul come i want you to die i want you to feed them because this is what they want samuel he said they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me they really don't want the way of god [Applause] hallelujah what he says he said the prayer when he come in see when you come into the house of the lord and he sees so when you come against religious demons come hard i won't crack a smile with them because i know what you're doing see i see i had the whole witness spirit come up on me one time i'm not talking about the people i'm talking about that spirit that's what we're living now and that spirit came upon me and i was sitting there eating and when i was sitting there eating he turned him and and he said how you doing i said fine i said how you doing brother i knew the fellow over there he went to the prison with me i didn't know his buddy he didn't know me so i was sitting there and he first of all he disturbed me when i was eating he's already asking for trouble you see so i'm sitting in there and i'm sitting there down in there and eating he said oh brother told me christian i said yeah he said i said he said who do you worship god or jesus so i knew what he was going to say so i know what he was trying to say see you don't always have to answer the devil i said who do you worship huh i got a revelation huh jesus said in my father's houses right over in jeremiah 7. is that right he's saying that this was the house of prayer is that what he told them and in that house jesus told him he said in this house my name shall be there is that right so i looked at him and said huh who you worship you know that i said let me tell you something buddy first of all don't never disturb me when i'm eating and second of all get out of here with your religious demon i don't play with the religious theme they say but kelly that's hard no it's not ah probably god said when they came in the house of the lord where's the first place jesus went riding on that donkey the scripture says judgment begins in the house of the lord the first place jesus went he went in there after the religious demons is that right prophet of god said what he said when he witnessed the money he said he told him to take the coin out of the fish's mouth he said that was the type of what the trustees is that right he said when they got to come and get a rebuke in one time don't don't charlie i know y'all gonna love the pastor but sometimes he's gonna have to come up here might rebuke you now is that eye is that right because you see a devil trying to enter in is that right but then he said to the deacon he said when jesus came in cracked the whip turned the table over he said that was the office of the deacon is that right he didn't play with them religious devils let's give him a clap often thank you jesus hallelujah [Applause] look what he said he says you can't he says the prayer is the most powerful weapon god gave to humans it can change god's mind for a purpose it says this prayer that reaches through knowing touches god's throne this prayer we talk about the prayer of faith confidence in the prayer of faith you can have confidence in the prayer of faith he says that that it touches god's throne rests unshakably in the assurance that the answer will come in god's time isn't that right you're gonna go in it i think it was a message let me say i thought i wrote it down here and you can go and check it you see it it it ah i'll find it but you can go in there and and he had it i'll find it it'll come to me but uh where where brother brandon worked that real real well he was telling people he was helping them letting them know where they felt maybe they wasn't healed or they keep flipping back but he brought it to them and let them know that you're good you have your healing but god vindicated it in his time when god does that you see i thought i wrote that down here but but we'll get it he says next it says it's a it's prayer totally dependent upon the holy spirit a prayer of faith is totally dependent upon the holy spirit you are sure of being guided in the subject of prayer consciousness of being quickened in faith during prayer the spirit confirms to you that the request is essential it's an essential prayer the holy ghost will let you know that's why he says what is a essential prayer or something we cannot do without see they consider us essential i worked there for walmart we've been working since march that's why i need your prayers we get around they've been working they consider us essential we supply 91 of america so when they get around they try to baby them with this little change give them that little change but it's essential remember the disciples of john said then teacher the disciples said teach us how to pray like john disciples is that right what did he say our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name holy holy be thy name thy what kingdom come so that die what you cannot walk right you cannot talk white you cannot pray right what did i just say in this prayer the holy ghost comes in intercession and make droning for you is that right you cannot do it that's why he said this prayer is essential god father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy holy ghost come so that thy what will can be done is that right on earth as it is in heaven forgive us as we forgive those dedicators is that right lead us not into temptation but to do what but deliver us from evil thou art the kingdom that are the power that wants the glory hallelujah we're talking about do you have confidence in your prayer see stop letting the devil try to condemn you see before god even brought the law before he even brought it out there it was things that god already didn't like remember in heaven he didn't like killing he didn't like stealing he didn't like adultery you see he didn't like those things so satan come and try to beat you in your mind is that right he tried to come and try to condemn you but the scripture says there is no condemnation who those that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but walk after the spirit is that right we come our god is a mighty god is that right i'm telling you hallelujah he said look he said now he said this is essential it's absolutely the prayer of faith it's a prayer totally committed to sing god answers realize intense prayer in its highest form as a prayer of faith commits to you determination like a vow is that right remember when the widow got around there was praying for the promise the widow she got there and she was praying there on for a child when there and the uh let's turn it to luke 18. hallelujah i know some are out there listening in we thank you for your prayers out there look what he said luke 18 chapter one verse one it says he spake a parable unto them to this end that men all to us always pray and not to uh saint see they're not moving we're gonna show you tell you why these armors aren't moving she said put on the whole arm of god so that you may be able to withstand the wiles of the devil in the end time is that right in these last days the armor of god which is the word of god that's anointed by the spirit of god the helmet of salvation your salvation is already paid for is that right you're breastfeeding righteousness we got to realize jesus christ when he came in he died on calvary and he shed his blood for you and i we're supposed to be living a victorious life what are you talking about is that right we didn't know that's a demon see brother branham told us when they say they got a virus when they got when they don't know what something is he said they call it a virus is that right is that when they call it a virus all it is is just a devil and that devil and that demon that's out there and they come out there it's just a never another part of the flu is the flu type symptom but you have to understand god told us what if god said greater is he that is in thee then he that is in the world it's going to come at you is that right but it's left up to you if you accept it or not is that right you said that it's a real demon you don't have to accept nothing that the devil sinned upon you he said i'm going to show that you are a different group of people excuse me the different group of people he said none of the diseases none of the plagues so come upon my children is that what he said given us to what the holy ghost the holy ghost brother branham said is nothing else that wealthy people can try to go to the moon the wealthy people can try to get some mountains and dig holes in the mountains the brother and that he said the only thing is going to protect them from the whole from the atomic bomb is the holy ghost nothing but the holy ghost see that's why jesus came in and and he told us these things let me keep going for a good old trap he said look what he says hallelujah look at this woman she knew who she was the prayer of faith [Music] she knew who she was she had confidence in her prayer remind me of what i've been not saying god told us to respect that office right hallelujah he said look he said he said she said verse two there was a in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man there was a widow in in the city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary protect me man you know you're supposed to he said that he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself thou i fear not god nor regard men yet because this widow troubling i will avenge her lest by her continue coming she wears me and the lord said hear that hear what the unjust judge said and shall not god do what avenge his only what elect ain't not that quote bruh steve judge red ah that's the bride that was elected he saved the best for last is that right we got to come he's sending the covenant angel to us to bring it all together bring us worthy people he used that covenant angel but you got to remember if they can kill the messenger they'll try to kill the message but god said is that right i shall not be mocked we had a rim in the bush i'm telling you brother what god gave you was first from the throne of god i i'm the boldness i feel bold as a lion now he told me i told that individual i'm coming back go get those sports series 14 15 16 17 18 19 go get those series that's fresh from the throne of god it was hidden manner malachi 4. i want to try to twist it up i'm talking about you run against chief demons when jesus come around in there when they came against jesus is that right jesus had confidence when he came around and then and jesus was fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and the devil came at him and came to tempt them what the lord teaches us he come at lust of the eye lust of the flesh or the pride of life is that right when jesus came around they came at jesus at the flesh is that right he said thou be the son of god turn these stones to what bread is that right see he thought he was just he thought he was talking to jesus he thought he was talking to a a man let's turn to their food matthew i'm just catching it i'm just catching it as we bring it lord you have your way matthew 3 matthew 3 hallelujah you're going confidence we have confidence in our prayers he said look for the sake of time he came down he came down and touched ground is that right the spirit came on he said the spirit of the descendant like a dove lightening upon him he said lord a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son of whom i'm well pleased is that right now god and man we're going to look at a lesson on that one day we're going to see why some of them can't get the holy ghost huh because obey me a lamb and a sheep or a lamb and a sheep obey your goat don't hello goat but be out there they sound just alike is that right yeah you won't be able to tell the difference but i tell you that's why i said you know them by their fruits you'll know them by their life you know them by giving them the word test that's how you'll know who they are is that right look what it says 4 chapter 4 chapter 4 and verse 1 then was jesus let up of the west spirit so you have to be in the spirit when you come into the house of the lord when you study and you got to be in the spirit you got to get there and pray when you arrive you got to get in the spirit when you get in the spirit now that's what's going on now they've taken this letter and they're twisting people's minds up with this letter but it's not bringing a revelation of the word the revelation only comes from god is that right he said he bears why the prophet of god says the word the bride of jesus christ the elected of jesus christ can never never over emphasize revelation is that revelation upon revelation upon revelation he said as jesus who do men say that i am thou say some say you're elijah some say you john the baptist some say you're one of the prophets some say you william branham who do thou say that i am thou art the christ the son of the living god he said ah flesh and blood this was not revealed to you but this was revealed to you so who my father which is in heaven he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of heaven shall not prevail against it upon the revelation of the word of who jesus christ really is he's the son of god and he's god is that right he's the son of god and he's god hallelujah my god my god my god hallelujah we're gonna have to curse you but let me show you here let me keep reading down in here then we're gonna turn it over to another i got to stop it's getting close he said look he says then faster 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungry and when the tempter dropped down to verse 4 but he answered and said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god he said now look he got around there he attempted them again is that right take him up on the high pinnacle let's drop down to verse seven look how he answered them he said jesus said unto him it is written then again thou shalt not attempt to see he thought he was just talking to jesus no no no he was dealing with god ah [Applause] when he's dealing with you he's think he's just talking to you but now we're being trained huh we do nothing unless the father tell us to say it huh the word will defeat the devil anywhere anytime on any ground we speak but god have us to speak hallelujah my god my god my god this oh my god let's turn it over to uh uh matthew 26 matthew 26 if we go musicians come on up too we got to bring it to a close come on up musicians matthew 26. we didn't even touch the surface of it but that's okay you have confidence confidence in your prayer come on prayer warrior fear warriors you have confidence in your prayers you don't have to worry about anything they're assurance you're sure someone you can trust in confidence confidence know if i read it i miss confidence it's the feeling or belief that one can rely on someone or something firm trust the synonym of continent is trust belief faith we can move on let's look at this here we know here i'm at the jump a little bit look at verse uh we go to verse help us lord 36. we know here is hallelujah yeah jesus is getting ready to go into the garden and when jesus is getting ready to go into the garden he has to press you know sometimes you have to press sometime you had a long day i know it's that way because we're still in the flesh did god give us seed taste filled smelling here that's the contact that's specially somebody here is that right and the spirit man is what is what is the will of god is that right that's what led them in is did you let the devil come in is because according to your will is that right but down in the soul determines it lives on the word of what faith faith and revelation is that right but now jesus was getting ready to go into the garden but he brought the best that he could with him faith hope and charity he brought the best with him he couldn't ring him but they got a little weary he recognized this time he couldn't go in there with them he got to go by himself the bible said he had to go in there on three encounters once he went in there on three encounters i'm telling you he had to claim it he had to press he had the oil he had to fight those demons he needed help down in there i know they was trying to stop him but he had to get the calvary he had to go shut our blood he had to take our sins is that right living he loved me died and he saved me bury to carry my sins far away that's what he tried to do he tried to get jesus to use the word on himself he tried to get him to use the child he tried to stop him from going to calvary but what greater than he that was in me and he that was in the world hallelujah we're talking about prayer let's walk it down look at verse 39 he says and he went a little father and fell on his face and did what prayed now here this scripture how he's responded this is the only encounter that he said this in gethsemane he didn't say it in mark he didn't say it in luke and he didn't say it in john he only said it here in matthew let us read and see he said he prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but what but battle win it was really over then you know it was over there once he said let that will be done it was over huh so he got around in there because we remember the property god told us he said once he came out of the eaton i mean gethsemane he had already taken the garden of eden back he said it was back then ah he says and he come unto the disciples and find them asleep and save him and then what could not watch with me one hour he said watch and pray look what he's telling them that he enter not into temptation the the spirit indeed is willing and the flesh is weak see that's why he said our father's on him he said lead us not into what temptation he said verse 42 and he said he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done let's drop over here to uh verse 50. we know the story there but for the sake of time you can go back and read it look at verse 50. he come in verse 47. he says and while he had spake to judas one of the twelve came in with him a great multitude with sword slaves from the chief priests and the elders drop down to fifty he says and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art i come see what he says he says a character brother branham said a character displays your victory jesus knew he had victory he said my friend he came after all press for you and i after he had the breakthrough query but he still displayed the character that god sent him for you look what he says here he says now verse 51 he says and behold one of them which with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck his servant of the high priest and smote off his ear he said then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword and through his place for all they that take the sewer shall do what perish with the sword he said thinketh thou that i cannot now what pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 legions of an angel but how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be that the lord jesus came in his hour here now it's so much more but i gotta stop he came in his hour here now to what take away our sins fulfill take away all the pain take away all the take the abuse take all the persecution but he knew after he went through the garden he showed the power he could have spoke the word but he did not say that he said don't you know i can pray don't you know you can pray let it stand my hallelujah belong to you [Applause] by hallelujah my hallelujah belongs to you [Music] you deserved oh to you all of the glory belongs to you thank you lord thank you lord thank you you deserve it [Music] belongs to you amen [Music] my hallelujah belongs to you my halloween to you how he has the highest praise my

as we sing this song we sing our hallelujah belongs to you lord lord we sing the song to you knowing that the highest praise belongs to the one and true god one and only true god that is the lord jesus christ lord and we want to give you that hallelujah this evening we want to praise you lord we want to worship you all of the glory belongs to you lord lord we come on sundays and wednesday says play sin you never cease to bless us lord you never cease to feed us lord and we're so grateful and thankful lord we want to give you the highest praise we worship you we love you we praise you i wonder if we can just praise him this evening thank you lord we love you lord thank you lord you are good your mercy to endure us forever you are the same yesterday today and forever lord you never change your word never changes lord we don't just want a head knowledge of it lord but we want to drop down in our heart lord we pray for a greater revelation we pray we love you lord thank you lord in jesus name amen amen give them a handcuff of praise this evening [Music] amen amen he was just saying something there this evening that touched my heart i wrote it down here let me just pull it up but he asked that question to us this evening he said do you have confidence in your prayer and i believe god wants us to have confidence in our prayers that's what he's preaching about a little bit this evening and and when we come before god and we kneel and we pray i mean there's times to cry and there's times to to like ask god for forgiveness of the mistakes that we've made and those things but sometimes i believe god wants us to come come down on our knees and speak to him as as a father every time we approach our our father for something our dad our natural dad do we do we beg him do we do we cry and and when we ask for something or do we walk up to him and say hey i need this can you give it to me you know art how much more our heavenly father he wants us to come boldly before his throne he wants us to come as a son not as a weak christian but as a strong christian because that's what he created that's what he's done for you if it wasn't for him we would be weak christians but he's given us the ability through his word to be be strong and to stand before him righteous pure and he wants us to see that in ourselves he can tell us servicing and service out that that he's had grace for us mercy for us but he wants us to have a revelation of it and to come before him as a child of god and speak to him as as royalty he said we're amateur gods on earth so sometimes rather than than praying for something you just speak the word we're thro i believe we're third paul believers we're third believers and we can speak to that mountain and move it i believe you gotta be careful because i believe there's so much power and the things that we say and the things that we do because of what god given us that we have to be careful to pray for his will so we don't come out of his will but in the end of the day he wants the holy ghost more for you than you want it for yourself a closer walk more for you than you want it for yourself that's what he wants for his children so do you have confidence in your prayer ask yourself that tonight when you go down on your knees to pray this evening ask yourself do you have confidence in your prayer and if you don't pray with confidence this evening come before god as his child amen i don't know if you all know this or not we'll try to we'll try to do it i might not sing it correctly so you all forgive me but pressing on on and on and on pressing on oh i gotta keep pressing on to the higher calling of our lord that's the whole song right there it just says i gotta keep pressing on on and on and on pressing on oh i gotta keep pressing on to the higher calling of our lord you're dismissed this evening as we sing a song i gotta keep pressing on on and on and on pressing on oh i gotta keep pressing on to the higher calling of our lord oh i gotta keep pressing on on and on and on pressing on oh i gotta keep pressing on to the higher calling [Music] on [Music] it's already done hallelujah it's already done praise the lord the victory is won the battle is over it's already done i know that it's done say it's already done oh it's already done [Music] oh the victory is won the battle is over it's already done i know that it's done i'm gonna have to teach you all that sister brenda lewis used to attend the church i used to go to and she wrote that song and she said that people changed it on her she wrote it as a fast song as a praise song not a slow worship song and she wrote it it's already done it's already done the victory is won and the battle is over because she said if we read the back of the book we can see in revelations that we won the victory so the victory is won the battle is over it's already done so the the message kind of changed it on her a little bit but it's a faster song and the words are a little different so we'll have to teach that to y'all but you all have a good night this [Music] evening it's our
