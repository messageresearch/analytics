those who have not done it continue with the 70 weeks of Daniel because one of these day if the Lord car we will begin the seven Church ages age by age by age and if you already read it then you're going to SW with me quickly amen continue with the 70 weeks of Daniel continue with the seals with adop and continue please to listen to the message of the hour amen there is nothing that I can point you to but the message of the hour amen glory to God yesterday we had a wonderful young men meeting wonderful wonderful wonderful and by God grace we finished what we were dealing with now they're going to catch up on the finances amen amen so Sarah stop bragging too much because uh brother Charles is right behind you you don't know the story but Sarah was bragging to his brother that we girls we ahead of you so now the boys are coming up and mother fact yesterday the Holy Spirit dropped two things that you guys never even heard amen and as soon as I Tau them the young sister never heard this you should hear the Jubilee yeah so actually they got something that you don't have so you need to negotiate with them to tell you exactly because it was in a scripture I never seen it and the Holy Spirit open open up rope right there and he was for the patriarch so whatever it is you negotiate with them and find out how you can exchange Revelation somebody's not really in tune amen so you can exchange Revelation they give you some and then you give them some amen glory be to the name of the Lord so Lord's willing brother able you work with me and let me know the next time so we kick on the finances because I don't want anybody to get into financial trouble I appreciate the young sister's response that I got he can I can see that he was the holy spirit because we need to dig a little bit deeper and if you want me to sit with you and go over everything which I would try to do Lord's willing let's sit down and go slowly one by one and deal with your finances if you don't want anybody to know about it either sleep up your question and answer then I deal with everybody or come and sit with me and my wife there we can go ahead and handle it I don't want anybody to be in trouble I love you so much that I want you to be happy in your marriages and happy at your home and enjoy the blessing of the Lord without going on the hard way amen amen glory be to the name of the Lord Lord's willing this coming Saturday December the 23rd will be our question and answers so try to be there on time and I'm waiting to hear from the Deacon then I will give you the date young sisters and then we will see when we can get on to the finances Amen brother Greg sent me a quote and it's uh it's a quote that I didn't have and it's a confirmation for what I preached like I don't know maybe a month ago or something so I felt led to uh share with the church so you also keep it in your ammunition when uh the devil is coming up you know how to shoot him amen amen amen amen the quote says this it's in the former and laddering wonderful amen amen it's a long longer than even this brother Bram say morning lights oh you stars of the morning you know what it means in this church you we already went through this brother Bram say put your alarm back on rise up and do what wash your face wash your face get the night out of your what eyes we don't want Lisha in our eyes and shine forth the approaching of who the Son of God long healing land should be what gone long ago you go verify amen Amen brother brandham say long healing line should be what gone long ago the Miracles and performance of God has got so much greater than that in this day until that is a what a back thing because we got the what a former and latter rain together everybody okay amen so you got the teaching rain you got Mur you got the the former and the latter R together so we should be very far away and brother Bram say long healing service should be what long gone can you say amen amen if you want me to pray for you I will continue to pray for you I will continue to lay hand on you but let's come up a little bit higher because God sent his word and his word was sent to heal you amen amen the words heal the first pull the word discern the second pull and the word itself is the third pole amen and the third pole is Christ amen and the third pole is the message of the hour am you remember that you remember that and the bread of Joseph is a bread that is a mixture of the seven breads it is the light of the Moon that looks like the light of how many days seven days that's why Jero the seven days he have to be turned how many times seven times because we got to pick up the mysterious end this is what brother Bram said brother I'm say the reason this the reason that all the straying ends of the mysterious part of what justification so justification even though it was preached by Luther there were still a mysterious part he said the mysterious part of what sanctification and the Mysterious part of what the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is where the Pentecostal cannot get you only get this by the bread of Joseph amen only Christ can give it to you amen they can go only up to a certain level he says what kind did Eve eat an apple or did she eat a palm grenade or something what was the serpent seed and is the baptism in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost or the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right or hundreds of those things that has been how left loose they were left Loose by a per for a purpose because the messenger of the last day have to gather all the loand and put him together amen and then give us a full message amen so what we receive is a full package amen a message of perfection amen that's why it's a pyramid amen because a pyramid is perfect amen it's the Capstone everybody together amen amen do you know that even Joseph has a portion of a land do you know that Joseph had a portion of the land the land of Goan amen that was given to Israel that's why they told Brother Bram that's a portion of Heaven amen will be given unto thee so everything in this message line perfectly with the Holy Scripture have you thought about it so you pray for me if I can reach 7% of the sermon this morning let's go to our scripture amen am the seals reveal the Thunders and the Thunders are those Revelation the L end and people in this message are even afraid to say the word Thunders you're rejecting the very message brother Bram called this picture here this picture right here brother BR I'm called This Cloud the picture the seven Thunders do you know that do you know that how many knows that okay I'm going to put the quot on the on the church group chat amen Amen brother Bram called this picture the seven Thunders but we are afraid to preach the seven Thunders because of common he did his ministry and we appreciate him but let's repeat what brother say the Thunder is not him the ther is the message amen so when I'm preaching I'm not preaching to be identified with him I'm preaching the message of the hour amen amen am let's go to Leviticus 19 some sometime you don't say things straight up that's why the devil play around with people because everybody's afraid and I don't have a bishop so I'm free amen amen we appreciate the brother the labor that he did he went and rest to be with the Lord but I'm not here perpetuating another another man's Ministry the only Ministry I have is the ministry of Christ which is the ministry of the seven Angel which is the ministry of Joseph that's the ministry that I'm giving unto you that's all amen amen let's go to Leviticus 19 Lord help me if I will cross the scripture if you thereare you can say amen amen Leviticus 19 verse 9 the Bible says and when you reap the Harvest put your seat belt on okay even online put your seat belt amen when you reap the Harvest of your land so the land belongs to you amen amen you will be planting and when you plant there will be a harvest that will come up we clear amen you shall not holy reap the corners of the field so you might be seated yeah yeah so if you have a field everybody okay amen if you have a field and your field you plant and God is specific he's not talking about the time of the planting watch your scripture I have to go slowly so you catch where I'm going God is talking about which time the time of water the Harvest the time of the Harvest thank you my brother the time of the Harvest so the time is very specific so even though the field or the land belongs to you amen the entire Harvest doesn't belong to you right I wish the whole church was here and if you push me to the corner I have more quote and more scripture to get the devil completely out of you amen amen I'm really really really loaded loaded all the way to my teeth everybody okay am so just say amen and we can move easily make my life easy okay so even you if even if you are the one that was that were working somebody didn't get it let me help you up even if you are the one that clock in and out and work can you say amen amen [Laughter] please don't worry I'm not going to preach on that okay I'm just going to touch the surface if I get on that some of you will repent amen amen amen you don't know what the Lord showed me I woke up that was yesterday and I wanted to read my uh morning reading and I just took the Bible and I open it and I fell into something and I read the Bible and I read the Bible again and I never it looks like I never seen what I was seen and when I begin to read I say my God where was this scripture all this along and when I saw it I could not stop in one chapter because I told you one chapter I begin to read the second chapter if I show you that it will make you tremble but I keep it quiet because some are allergic until the spirit will let me to delet it amen amen amen amen amen but David give him the volume please so even if you the one that clock in even if you the one that clock out even if you are the one that were waking up every morning and going to work and labor on your field you're the one that was driving and waking up with an alarm clock in the morning amen you the one that were sweating my brother amen outside and doing all the hard work when the Harvest come it the whole Harvest doesn't belong to you amen can you say amen amen please whoever even even my wife is whoever is not here make sure you come and listen to this slowly okay if you want me to deal with it I will take a whole surface and go little by little until you get it everybody okay so even if you gathered from so at the Harvest it produce 100% amen this 100% doesn't belong to you amen I am in the bible let me leave the bible let me go in the world and leave the Bible Amen in the world in America IRS told you that the 100% doesn't belong to you did you ever a fast with irus I'm asking you a question did you ever a fast with ir no try to fast one time with ir and you will be calling me to pray for you try a little bit one time in other word IR will take it before you even touch it if you got a paycheck system they remove your taxes and your Social Security and your Medicare they remove all of them before you touch anything so if you are okay with ir how much more with who IR take it every day every week you never fast with him so let me preach for God I'm not preaching for IR as much as we Christian we need to be correct with our taxes everybody okay so let me leave the world let me go back again to spoken word now we okay now now amen we clear now amen so when you do whatever you do and you produce 100% not the 100% belong to you there is a portion called the corners can you open your Bible please the corners or the ages sister should understand ages very good everybody okay they got edges in their hair amen the corner yes and the ages so they should understand that good so everybody is on board amen the corner or the ages of the field do not belong to you it belongs to who God God God is in the heaven what is he going to do with your crop God is in the heaven what is he going to do with your crop let's see who it belongs to are we okay if you were going quickly with me we could be already finishing this one amen he says when you reap the Harvest of your land you shall not wholy reap the water corners of thy field neither shall you gather the what cleanings of thy harvest the gleaning of thy Harvest means whenever the reaper are working everybody okay amen if something accidentally let's use it now use the word accidentally if accidentally something dropped from the hand of the reaper don't pick it up can you say amen amen so the corner of the edes and what and the gleaning or whatever Falls or whatever drop as you Gathering the field God say don't pick it up amen everybody okay in other word from your 100% of your Harvest God split your harvest in two part I'm going slowly you have a certain percentage can I pick up a percentage yes can I pick so we agree that I picked I don't have a quote or a scripture I'm just picking okay okay you take 80% that's it I just picked amen and we supposed that 20% let me put it here supposingly is what makes out the corners amen the ages amen and the gleaning are we together are we together we clear so far amen out of this 80% follow me carefully this is where you take your tthing say amen amen are we together so who does the 20% belong to who normally we don't know what the percentage is because we don't know how much will fall that's right we don't know how much is the corners so in other word this supposing 20% does it have a certain number it's an unknown number or an unknown measure we don't know whether it's going to be 10% or it's going to be uh I mean 20% or we don't know amen but the one that is responsible for this is God Amen everybody okay everybody good so as you working on your field amen the holy spirit will move on you and cause you to accidentally on now drop something purposely amen and you think oh I made a mistake it is not you it is God that is withdrawing something for who verse 10 sorry I didn't know he was a different Canon so let me inform you it's a different weapon amen amen verse 10 and you shall not gleed your what Vineyard neither shall you gather what every grape of thy Vineyard when they say every grape it means when you are picking up the grape what will happen to the grape fall some will fall don't pick up you think it's an accident it is not an accident watch what's going on Amen you shall leave them for who the poor and who The Stranger am so God says that this percentage here that we don't know really the number is or belongs to who the poor and the stranger the poor and who stranger everybody okay amen so a portion of your Harvest can you say amen amen goes to the poor amen amen that's why I hope everybody will listen to this brother Bram say never take your tthing and give it to the poor can you say amen amen your taring don't belong to the poor amen it's a Pentecostal understanding a castol understanding a Judas understanding let me repeat it again a Judas understanding when they want to give unto the Lord Judas sees the poor and Jesus said the poor will always be with you don't never take your T money and give it to a widow woman amen it is incorrect [Music] amen oh today he's preaching now about tthing I wish I was not in service this morning I don't know why I clicking the church this morning I don't know why I follow this service after now he's after tthing it looks like I don't I don't leave you can say all you want to say but I will repeat what the prophet say Amen where the he pleases you or not my responsibility is to repeat Malachi [Applause] 4 Listen to this amen amen amen amen question and answer in 1961 question would it be wrong to use what on what church building funds can you say amen amen well now here is a what a touchy little thing so brother Bram knew that it's very sensitive everybody okay Amen in here in this church we preach everything everything there is no part of the church or part of the word that you will intimidate me not to preach I will preach the Bible from the Genesis all the way to Revelation I will preach the message from when it started all the way to where brother brandham sto whether you like it or not I will preach it amen can you say amen amen so never take your tthing and giving that to the poor and you think that you more merciful you wrong you actually sinning by doing that amen no I'm going to take my Tiding and I'm going to send it to the missionary work wrong wrong Revelation no I'm going to give it to the poor because brother Steven is a doctor he doesn't need money wrong Revelation amen don't worry your Tiding is what I'm doing stuff here anyway but I have to preach to you the truth everybody okay everybody okay I want you to follow God and get blessed whether I take the T and give it back to you or give it to this brother or maybe buy an instrument here that's no more your problem your problem is do what God told you to do and you get your blessing and when I get the Tiding I will see who's struggling and I know what to do with it because God gave me the stewardship but don't be looking at me to to fulfill God's word Amen brother Bram say here is a tou of things for the what church now no correctly Tav is to go to the what the minister that can you say amen amen can you say amen amen so when people are preaching here what do you think I need to do because the Bible told me whoever is preaching I need to pay [Applause] [Music] him sorry you got a hot potato Pastor amen he says in the Bible they had what a box they set at the door in the what oh test I explain this to you when the building this box was what a fun where what the people people put in there for the repairing you read it many times in the what Old Testament they keep up the building and things like that all the what repair on the what building was taken care out of that what fun but a t which is what a tent which is a what a TI a TI of that went into what the tithing all the tithing went to the what priest who is those priest the what pastors say amen amen he says yes staring out to go for what nothing else and no people that take the taring and give them to a what a widow woman that is what wrong everybody okay amen if you got anything to give to the widow woman do what give her but don't give her what God's money that is what not yours in the first place that is who God's so whoever is struggling with this thing you need to correct your life amen don't be over Supernatural or over merciful than God God knows how to take care of the poor when you have your income remember there is a portion that you need to give to the poor and that portion is not your taring your tiing come out of here but God provided something for the poor because when you give to the poor you are lending to God am that's what the Bible say you meet a poor person you give him senses you don't know what you're doing give him a $100 bill and you see what God will do to you I'm not talking about me give it to the poor you need to understand the laws of God we need to understand the laws of God not understanding these laws that are in [Applause] trouble we got our money and I wonder if tthing never had a percentage how much

corners of your what if you notice not the man part of the field but the corner the edges amen amen the corners of your field when you reap neither shall you what gather any what gleaning of thy Harvest you shall leave them to the who the poor and to the who the stranger I am the Lord your what God everybody clear amen are we clear amen let's go to Deuteronomy 24 Deuteronomy chapter 24 if you dare you can say amen I have to soak this clearly so when I'm begin to take off you know where I'm soar Lord this message will correct our life in every aspect amen there is not one area in this in our life that the message doesn't se you am the message is not just to touch you the third pool yes in the third pool there is everything that's why every area your finances your everything need to be clean up you need to be free amen total Deliverance amenal Deuteronomy 24: 19 if you dare you can say amen amen when you cut down your water dine Harvest it's it's still in the time of harvest in your field and have water forgot a sheath in the field that's a different aspect did you hear me did you hear that amen so if you you take your sheath and you put it here amen and you Gathering your sheath and then when you go you say oh the cor there I left a she each over who made you forgot that she who did it for who for The Who so God watching over the poor and the stranger will send his Spirit to make sure whenever you are harvesting y y y fi certain accident happen that you accidentally and then you jum with amen as soon as you jum oh my God I can't take it no more if you forgotten something I can't go back and take it more and God is doing that so that the poor will come and say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus God providing Daily Bread amen are we together amen daily bread for the poor and for the Gentile and the and and the stranger the Gentile he sleep up so I have to say it now the stranger amen so the Gentile get which portion the edges the food that are that are lost amen the food that are lost amen accidentally lost the food that escape that's for the Gentile so when we are eating when you are Greening whatever Escape don't worry let's wait for the seven age let's wait for the end time Hallelujah and when we come in the end time we begin to GLE whatever are we together because the owner of the field will never experience this food the owner of the field will never taste this food this food Escape him he escape the Reapers and God mysteriously mysteriously will make a way to pick up those food are we together Are You full I'm just reading the Bible are we together amen okay let's go my friend where are we at if you forgotten a sheep in the field you shall not go again to do what fetch it it shall be for who the stranger come for the what the fatherless God added somebody the poor the stranger now we got who the fatherless right the fatherless let's continue and who for the Widow for The Who The Widow somebody had to pop can't help it amen and for the Widow that the Lord May that the Lord your God do what may bless thee so when that thing goes to the widows when it goes to the fatherless when it goes to the poor when it goes to the stranger what will God do to you bless me that's why I told I'm telling you what I'm telling you when he goes to those Channel those pipe automatically God come and blesses you are we together amen are we together amen God May bless you in what all the work of thine hand so whatever you you do must be blessed amen if you do this if you leave something for the fatherless for the widows for the stranger for the poor automatically God must bless you not in one area in all area of your life God must supplier for you that's why I told you remember the poor are we together amen they told me to send money to Ukraine we didn't have money you know what I did I took whatever I have I send it in faith I said this is spoken word contributing so that in heaven it is spoken word so something must come back no wonder deliverance keep happening in this Hallelujah the Bible say not don't let the right hand do there are many things I do like that you don't know there's many things I do like he knows you see him clapping hands there's many things I do like that you don't understand and in return you get blessed everybody okay Amen Let Me remove this so somebody okay cool okay we clear amen verse 20 when you beat your what thine Olive Tree you shall not go over the what the balls again for it shall be for who the stranger for who the fatherless and for who and for the Widow we clear amen are we clear amen jum to verse 21 when you gather the water The Grapes of thy Vineyard you shall not glean it afterward it shall be for who the stranger for who the fatherless and for who for the Widow and you shall remember that you were a bound man am remember where you come from Hallelujah the land of Egypt therefore I did what I command thee it's a command I command you to what do this thing when you do it God will bless you amen hallelujah so in the time of harvest there is a portion of food that is reserved for the gentle for the poor for the father for the widows and God is responsible to withdraw that food by making you forget a shei by making some of the food oozing from your hand and when he drop it doesn't belong to you anymore and you will never touch that food you will never taste that food it doesn't belong to you anymore it belong to somebody else am are we together now let's go to the book of rof thank I already preached the message now we clear now we clear now should I read or we clear amen let's go to Ru chapter one father help me I'm still reading the scripture amen amen if you there you can say amen amen verse one this is where we stop last Sunday now it came to pass in the days when the judges r that there was what a famine in the land and a certain man of what Bethlehem Judah the house of bread you know what it means amen went to surgeon in the country of what Moab he and his wife and his what s son so what made Naomi to live from the promised land to Moab what happened famine we okay now famine Hallelujah famine cause Naomi me to go to Moab we clear amen praise God jop to verse six now then she arose after all the tragedy that happened with her daughters in inlaw that she might return this is now the return of Naomi she might return from the country of Moab for she have what heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord has what visited his people in giving them what bread So What attracted Naomi back to the promised land bread Moab back to the promised land by Bread we clear we clear jum to verse uh 16 I'm skipping this because you know it if you dare you can say amen amen verse 16 this is uh this is uh let's go to 15 so it makes sense verse 15 and she said this is Naomi talking to Ru behold your sister-in-law is gone back to who her people and to who her Gods return you after your sister-in-law in other word go back to your God and go back to your people and stay there and identify there this is where we find you follow Ruth on verse uh 16 and Ruth say intre in me entreat me not to leave you or to do what return from following after you for where you go I would do what go where was Naomi going back to Israel so Ruth was determined to go back to Israel so going back to the Israel is not enough we need a little bit be more come on where you will go I will go come on where you want large I will do what large so now I can stay there we understand now it's more stable but it's not good enough come on your what people shall be what my people in other word rof is saying I'm no longer a MOAB amen as I'm following you from now on consider me no more and Moab a amen we clear amen come on your people will be my people come on and your what your God shall be what my God in other word ruth is saying that from this day I'm no longer under idolatry I am living under the god of Israel she said everybody okay verse 17 where you do what will I do what die and there will I be what buried burying the promis land where they have Joseph over there yes sir where they have Abraham there and all the pro and all the prophet must be buried there because the Messiah will come so rof was identifying even with the death and the burial of the patriarch are we together there shall I be buried amen verse 17 and the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but what but death part you and what and me so what I'm showing you here is a decision is made from roof Amen to belong to the nation of Israel so Ru now in her mind she's a Jew in her mind she believe in the Lord she believe in Jehovah are you following me what happened with that decision of Ru deciding we already went that went there jum to verse 22 M have your scripture so Naomi returned and Ruth amen the moabites her daughter-in-law she uh um sorry with her which returned out of the country of Moab verse 22 and they came to where Bethlehem the house of what bread in the what beginning of barley Harvest they didn't come before the Harvest amen let me pray so we move on Amen Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto their hand may you come and move me completely out of the way this is the best I could do with your help Lord father come and speak to your children in Jesus precious name amen amen they never came before The Harvest they never came at the end of the Harvest but they came when at the beginning of the what rof and Naomi return at the beginning of their Harvest amen so they came back when the Harvest started let me connect the dots now amen remember during the time of there is a law are we together that law belongs to the stranger are we together now it belongs to the Widow everybody okay if you a poor you qualify if you a stranger you qualify if you a fatherless you qualify if you a widow you qualify and now Nomi returned when she was poor that's why Naomi said do not call me again Naomi call me Mara because I lost everything amen so by poverty roof qualify are we together by stranger roof qualify and by Widow W roof qualify are we together are we together so roof is coming not at end of the Harvest not before the Harvest but at the beginning of what harest in other word god her food her Daily Bread is guaranteed because she's coming at the right time she's coming when this L get in action she's coming when her footstep is activated she's coming when her credit God is activated she's coming at the right time because on the Harvest time she has a right to go to any field and get her Daily Bread amen amen everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay the bread that they were looking for begin to provide for roof are we together are we together amen let's go to rof chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen amen remember rof came at the beginning of the Harvest in other word there is a full package full package by the law amen amen available or waiting to be used so as she's entering Israel there is a package but remember the package is there but you need to go to the package are we together amen do you follow me remember the secret of asking amen even though the package is there you need to move where the package is and you need to go ask for your package give us this day what our daily bread you need to ask for it are we together are we clear Ruth chapter 2 and Naomi had a Kingsman of her husband you know all of this I'm just scratching I'm taking a different angle angle a mighty man of wealth of the family of who and his name was who Boaz you know what he means and rof notice it's not Naomi and Ruth the Moab said to Naomi not Naomi rof herself let me do it now go to the field who T her this law how did she know she can get food so somehow there was conversation between Naomi and rof as they were getting along the road because brother Bram say it was Naomi that was teaching roof the laws of the Prophet so as they were going along Naomi begin to unfold the package of Jehovah since you agree that my God is going to be your God and my people are going to be your people now I'm going to unfold you certain things that Ora knows nothing about and when we get to my land there is a law and that law if you a stranger which you are if you a widow which you are if we poor the way we are you already qualifi for a package are we together amen are we together let's continue my friend he she say verse two and roof the mo they say to Naomi Let Me Now go to the field and do what glean ears of corn glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find what Grace and she said to her do what go my daughter so she's trying to find Grace in the field of somebody amen everybody okay amen follow me very careful amen jum to verse three and she went this is RO and came and glean in the field after the Reapers and her ha yes sir do you know what that means yes sir she happened sir for some reason she happened she happened her H was to light on the part of the field belonging to who boas who was the Kindred of the Kindred of what so when Ruth initiated her move toward her Daily Bread are you following me when Ruth initiated her move toward her provided Daily Bread amen that bread begin to pull roof toward her Kingsman Redeemer are we together in other word the hunger of roof was pushing her toward the Redeemer [Music] [Applause] amen if you do fully you let me know my friend I'm just at the beginning everybody okay so the move of roof the move of roof amen toward her package toward her daily bread that was provided by Jehovah everybody okay that move push her not to any field but he pushed her toward the field of a redeemer in other word bread provided a redeemer amen everybody okay the hunger of rof was calling for a redeemer the bread of Bethlehem was calling for a Kingsman Redeemer so he was not really bread behind bread was the Redeemer everybody okay Ruth thought she was looking for bread Ruth thought she was going to glean she didn't know that her move of Faith her move of Faith was not only bringing bread but bringing a redeemer because the Redeemer himself is a [Applause] bread if I lost you raise your [Applause] hand if I lost you raise your hand Have I Lost You Have I Lost anybody the move of roof toward her package toward the Providence of God according to the law amen was pushing her toward the kingsman with him that's why the Bible say the footstep amen amen of the righteous our what of God so the GPS is not true sometime you g certain Road you don't understand why you getting the road but there is an expected end because the one that is maneuvering the plane is not you all things work together for what good maybe roof as she was moving she saw maybe a field there she say oh that is my field she ch to go and a dog begin to B say uhuh not the dog I don't like dog and she goes to the other she didn't know that God put that dog there to recalibrate her sometime the supervisor that hatur you he doesn't really Hur you he have to Hur you like Pharaoh so that you can go to the promised land am because that job is not your finality it is just a detol everybody together have I lost somebody that's why everything in your life is working together for good IM seems like it's working good but God is orchestrating everything to work according to the purpose of his own will rof thought I'm going to get food she didn't know which field she was going to and she fell by some chances which is not a chance because he was ordained by the Lord and she fell in the field of boas are we together amen and the field of boas like any other field had Corners he has edges he has cleaning drops there everybody okay are we together are we together are we together let me do this so I calm your nerve let's do this my subject this morning is Teachers to pray roof the bread of Faith amen so let me go back to my reading we okay now we clear now where are we at my friend verse four and behold who Boaz came from where Bethlehem he came from Bethlehem and said to who the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answer him saying what the Lord bless thee then said boas to who his servant that was what set over the Reapers What whose damsel is this should I say something oh you already got it boas has Reapers he had Reapers and all those Reaper had a supervisor that's right that was the chief Reaper amen so when boas came he came straight not to any Reaper he came only to the chief reap because in the absence of Boaz the field of boas is under the responsibility of the chief R and the absence of boas which is Christ the field of Christ is under the responsibility of the pastor of the ede amen is under the responsibility of the messenger of the AG amen that's why the messages are sent to the angel not to you to the angel not to you to the Angel and the angel take the message first and deliver the message to you so when that's why over over the curtain of time they told Brother Bram when Jesus Christ will return He will first come to you am he will ask you first amen and if you pass the test whoever is behind you and the multitude say we are resting on what that's why I'm resting this church upon the message of the [Applause] hour they pray you don't go to Pharaoh when you go to Pharaoh Pharaoh say ask [Applause] who [Applause] so are we okay amen according to the setting here we begin to understand we went through n the messages with Pro this is the layer and and it is L 92 okay so I'm really pulling the files there that's where I am okay so according to the setting here we begin to understand that when rof was approaching the field of Boaz are you following me Boaz was not there am I reading a different Bible who was there the chief Reaper and the chief Reaper have Reaper under him because every minister in this message is under the messenger amen our instruction is according to the chief Reaper amen the chief Reaper is responsible for Bas field when is not there William Bram is not there but the message is there the message and the messenger are what so we have the message that's why we have the chief Reaper [Applause] amen Have I Lost somebody have I lost somebody so we begin to understand that when rof enter the field amen she did not see bers yes sir she met somebody who is responsible for the field so the one who will give Ru the permission is not [Applause] bers the one who will give rof the right to pick her Daily Bread is not [Applause] poers can I drop some are you going to swallow it you want me to watch this my friend this is uh verse uh six and the who servant that was what set over the Reapers which is the chief Reaper answered and say it is the who the moabites so who knew the identification of the girl how did the chief Reaper know and boas don't my friend everybody okay everybody okay in other word there was an interaction between boas because your BS is dropping things quickly our boss is dropping things quickly so I got to shoot quickly there is an interaction there was an interaction between the chief Reaper and roof and the absence of bers and listen what your boss just told me now before Rebecca meet Isaac Rebecca interrupted with n there was a discussion between NES and Rebecca until Rebecca and Al become so friend that as they go they say tell me more tell me more tell me more tell me more because El knows the secret of [Applause] so for you to know the secret of God you need the messenger amen you need William Marion BR amen for you to understand this man of Galilee you need to know Malachi for he is the friend to the bridegroom H are we together are we together is he getting juicy Have I Lost somebody Mom are we doing okay see if Mom is Okay we okay are we together glory to God Amen are we together listen to this he says that and the mo and and the servant that was set off the weap answer and say what it is the moabi damsel that did what came back with Naomi okay and what out of the country of Moab watch verse seven and what and she said she said stop it was roof that was speaking rof was speaking to who to the chief Reaper remember as much as bread is there you need to go where the bread is and you need to go and ask for bread you need to go to the father and say give me this day my water Daily Bread you need to go to the Pharaoh and you say give me this day what and Pharaoh say you need to talk to who so you need to go talk to who we clear amen Joseph let's go he says and she said verse seven I do what I pray you let me what clean and do what gather after what the Reapers among the Sheep stop so who granted unto roof her Daily Bread [Music] who gave rof her daily bread now follow me carefully okay are we ready amen the bread that the chief Reaper was giving to rof was the bread of the corners [Music] amen he was the bread of the ages it was the bread that escaped the bra bre of the gleanings the bread that drop the bread that is forgotten in other word when Luther want to preach he leave something and he forgot it and when Luther get in the pull pit he cannot remember what he was trying to preach because the mysterious part of Luther was taken away from [Applause] him everybody okay and those bread that belong to the stranger that belongs to the poor that belong to the Widow are under the custody of the chief Reaper amen so the chief Reaper hold the food of the corners hold the food that escape hold the food that dropped only the chief Reaper can give you the [Applause] tunders [Applause] only the chief Reaper can give you the mystery that were lost amen the Mysteries that have escaped that no one was able to get only the chief Reaper can give you [Music] that give us this day our what Daily Bread our daily bread is in the message of the hour that's why I Joy you with the seals with the church ages read the 70 weeks of Daniel listen to the message that's where your bread [Applause] is Are You full or we continue I'm still reading the scripture can you bear with me can you continue where are we at my friend verse n seven verse seven and she came and has continue even from what the morning continue my friender until now and what that she carried a little in the house who gave her permission to get in the house chief Reaper the house of who Boaz how do you get access to the house of boas when the when boas is not there who hold the keys of the storehouse who hold the key amen of the House of Bo you need to negotiate with the chief Reaper amen because he got the keys to the doors amen he can provide you some rest when you labor you labor you labor he said get this key and God will give you some rest amen are we together my friend are we together this is nailing you the last time we clear my friend amen we clear my friend amen let's go to verse eight father help me Hallelujah you there amen let's go to verse eight then said boas to who Ruth hear you not my what daughter go not to gleen way in another field neither go go from here but do what abide here fast by my maidens so roof is put in the category of servant remember the Egyptian in the category of the servant remember the prodal son in the category of the servant the category of a servant is a true good category because he will lift you up the way up is how when you enter the pyramid how do you go and then after down you do what when do you start as a menen and you become

brother CH noal brother CH cannot shake when he sees me something is wrong amen matter of fact when brother CH sees me it should be even happy and say hey the pastor is coming let me have my opportunity not the pastor is coming and everybody's shaking like the president is coming it's a nicolan spirit in this message the congregation and the preacher will sit on the same place we are part of the can you say Amen respect still is there but we are part of the BR amen can I continue amen I'm just reading the Bible okay where are we at my friend verse 14 and she sat beside the reaper and

can only take the corners and that which is drop if you get among the Sheep they will rebuke you because you have no right but Bo say hey take off the limit amen with this one when she's Greening when

into the property of [Music] boas can I say something can I say something between 80 and 20% have a distinction 20% means that you are poor or you are what stranger or you are what father or you are what Widow this belongs to the owner amen but if somebody begin to cross this Commonwealth the wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentile when you begin to cross the Wall of partition it means you begin the difference between you and the honor begin to disappear we don't know now who you are are you the family of the honor are you the child of the honor are you the wife of the owner what is your connection with the owner because only owner can enter this territory now roof is entering and pulling things for that territory amen amen amen amen is everybody happy amen listen to this my friend verse uh 16 and what and let fall all Al what some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them and what that she may glean them uhhuh and Reb at the beginning it was not it was
