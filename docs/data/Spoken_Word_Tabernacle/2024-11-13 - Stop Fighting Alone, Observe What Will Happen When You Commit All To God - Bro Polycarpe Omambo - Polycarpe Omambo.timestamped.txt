[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:23] 23 I walk in the midst of the shadow of
[1:09:27] the Valley of the shadow of
[1:09:29] death I will fear no
[1:09:33] evil for thou with
[1:09:38] me and stff they comfort
[1:09:45] me do not do not walk in the Valley of
[1:09:49] the shadow of death murmuring
[1:09:51] [Applause]
[1:09:55] many times we are passing through the
[1:09:59] valley this is David
[1:10:04] speaking David found also himself in the
[1:10:07] same
[1:10:11] situation but David remembers God
[1:10:14] promises unto him amen
[1:10:20] amen that road and that stuff they
[1:10:23] comfort me
[1:10:27] meaning that David found himself in a
[1:10:29] difficult situation like you and
[1:10:32] me but he was not
[1:10:36] discouraged he never credited anything
[1:10:38] to the
[1:10:40] devil he confessed that which was
[1:10:43] [Applause]
[1:10:46] positive David was walking through the
[1:10:48] valley of the
[1:10:51] Shadow standing upon the word of God
[1:10:54] without
[1:10:58] murmuring life depend on the way you
[1:11:02] look in
[1:11:05] it even your future depend on the way
[1:11:08] that you expecting that to
[1:11:13] be even if somebody promised to you to
[1:11:16] give you money or that tomorrow you get
[1:11:20] Mar it depends on the way you are
[1:11:23] looking at that person amen
[1:11:28] amen glory to
[1:11:38] God in Matthew
[1:11:40] 192 and Mark 10 verse
[1:11:44] 27 Jesus is using the same
[1:11:52] words Jesus look unto them and say what
[1:11:55] is impossible to man is possible unto
[1:11:59] God amen
[1:12:03] amen people had
[1:12:07] trouble maybe the disciple were unable
[1:12:09] to provide
[1:12:11] healing and they asked the Lord Jesus
[1:12:14] CHR why we were unable to heal this
[1:12:17] person and
[1:12:20] Jesus for men it's
[1:12:23] impossible but for God all things are
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:31] possible and remember we read where
[1:12:33] Jesus mentioned about the master
[1:12:37] seed God doesn't want doesn't wait for
[1:12:41] your faith to be
[1:12:43] such when he was talking about a master
[1:12:47] seed in other word you must have a right
[1:12:51] perception to take that Master seed
[1:12:56] that little faith that you
[1:12:59] have even if it's a little grain of
[1:13:03] it if you can bring unto God that
[1:13:08] faith God is the one that will remove
[1:13:11] that
[1:13:13] mountain why are you not able to move a
[1:13:19] mountain because you are focusing on the
[1:13:22] mountain it's true that mountain
[1:13:25] your problem is real
[1:13:29] true but with your natural eye there is
[1:13:32] no way you can move a
[1:13:38] mountain you need somebody that is
[1:13:41] specialized on Impossible situation to
[1:13:44] move that
[1:13:49] mountain you want somebody that is
[1:13:52] invisible but that can work M things in
[1:13:55] the visible
[1:13:57] realm but when we are
[1:14:00] alive and when you facing your
[1:14:03] situation maybe it's a health
[1:14:08] issue
[1:14:09] maybe a relationship that is in trouble
[1:14:13] maybe a financial
[1:14:15] trouble and it's troubling
[1:14:19] you you cannot find solution
[1:14:23] yourself you're small little
[1:14:28] faith Jesus want you to give him that
[1:14:31] faith when you give him that
[1:14:35] faith and you conf and you trust in
[1:14:39] him and he's the one that will take care
[1:14:42] of the
[1:14:43] situation he's the one that will remove
[1:14:45] the

[1:14:49] the situation for you amen amen
[1:14:56] in Mark
[1:14:58] 23 in Mark 9 actually
[1:15:07] 23 this is somebody who had a child who
[1:15:10] was possessed by a
[1:15:15] spirit and Jesus say here if that can't
[1:15:19] believe all things are possible to him
[1:15:22] that believeth
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:28] Jesus that what is impossible unto men
[1:15:31] is possible unto
[1:15:37] God but now Jesus is saying to this
[1:15:40] person all things are possible to him
[1:15:43] that believe amen
[1:15:47] amen meaning when you
[1:15:50] believe there is nothing that will
[1:15:53] resist you
[1:15:55] because at the time that you start
[1:16:00] believing you already have the
[1:16:02] omnipotent
[1:16:04] power because it's God who does the work
[1:16:07] am
[1:16:09] amen it is God who
[1:16:12] can who change the
[1:16:18] situation in act 8 verse
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:22] 37 Philip
[1:16:27] you know the story about Philip and
[1:16:30] Ethiopian unic amen
[1:16:36] amen and Philip says
[1:16:40] this if thou believeth with all
[1:16:44] heart
[1:16:48] mayest he answered and
[1:16:52] said I believe that Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:56] Son of
[1:17:00] God I want you to notice somebody who
[1:17:03] have the omnipotent power of God like
[1:17:08] Philip he never say if you believe in
[1:17:12] God
[1:17:13] he if you believe from all your
[1:17:17] heart you can have
[1:17:19] it do you do you hear that
[1:17:30] mhm verse 39 and when they were come up
[1:17:33] out of the water the spirit of the Lord
[1:17:36] C away
[1:17:43] Phillip
[1:17:45] and and he went on his way
[1:17:51] rejoicing and but Philip was
[1:17:58] and passing through he preached in all
[1:18:00] the cities till he came to
[1:18:05] cesaria look at the power or the
[1:18:08] omnipotent power of God in a
[1:18:11] man Philip was with the Ethiopian
[1:18:15] un and he told him if you are believe
[1:18:18] you can believe all things are possible
[1:18:21] you can have eternal life
[1:18:25] and he went and baptized the
[1:18:27] man after the word of
[1:18:32] baptism receive eternal life at the same
[1:18:35] time he even forgot about
[1:18:38] pH he to rejoice and
[1:18:41] glor he was
[1:18:43] happy this is what the Bible says but at
[1:18:46] the same
[1:18:48] time Philip disappeared
[1:18:57] we know when we are acquainted with the
[1:19:01] the the the the going away of the the
[1:19:04] Lord Jesus Christ when he died and rose
[1:19:08] again and the disciple were there in the
[1:19:11] room
[1:19:14] shutting and suddenly Jesus appeared
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:18] amen and we all know that story but this
[1:19:22] one is not Jesus it's Philip phip this
[1:19:25] is
[1:19:27] Phil so when you take God at his
[1:19:30] [Music]

[1:19:40] himself you don't use your own thoughts
[1:19:44] anymore you are going with God's Own

[1:20:21] written that we have this treasure in
[1:20:24] Earth
[1:20:27] vessel so that the Excellency of the
[1:20:35] power be of God and not of

[1:20:48] Earth and
[1:20:52] vessel and God took a treasure and put
[1:20:54] inside of

[1:26:07] to
[1:26:09] Peter but Peter say
[1:26:16] to why has Satan filled that heart to
[1:26:18] lie to the Holy
[1:26:23] Ghost and to keep back part of the price
[1:26:25] of the
[1:26:31] land was he remain was he not done
[1:26:36] on and after he was
[1:26:40] sold was he not in own
[1:26:48] power why has thou conceived this thing
[1:26:51] in th heart
[1:26:54] listen to this that has not lie unto men
[1:26:58] but unto
[1:27:02] God and anas hearing these
[1:27:07] words fell down and gave up The
[1:27:14] Ghost and great fear came on all them
[1:27:17] that heard these
[1:27:22] things I want you to notice something
[1:27:26] Peter a human being with all
[1:27:34] disciples the unity created the
[1:27:37] omnipotence of
[1:27:40] God Peter was speaking to another human
[1:27:42] being called
[1:27:45] ananas he looked at him he said why did
[1:27:48] you li to the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost Peter became the Holy
[1:27:52] Ghost according to what
[1:27:55] reading and as he's moving
[1:27:57] forward he also speak he
[1:28:01] say you didn't lie onto
[1:28:04] man but you lied onto
[1:28:07] God when anas heard
[1:28:10] that fell down and gave up the ghost
[1:28:13] right on the spot and in Psalm
[1:28:17] 82m
[1:28:19] 82 God already
[1:28:22] declared he judges among Gods amen
[1:28:27] amen you
[1:28:29] see so in verse
[1:28:32] six God
[1:28:34] says I already declare ye are
[1:28:39] gods look at these people in the
[1:28:42] scripture knew their
[1:28:44] position when they didn't have the full
[1:28:47] word
[1:28:49] like they don't have the Revelation that
[1:28:51] we have
[1:28:54] only have a portion of the
[1:28:56] word but in the end
[1:28:59] time all the mysteries of God are
[1:29:02] already
[1:29:05] declared word of God is already
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:09] unfolded how can you be crying amen
[1:29:16] amen say you didn't lie to men you lied
[1:29:19] to
[1:29:20] God you lied unto God
[1:29:27] you did it unto
[1:29:29] God and this is what happened
[1:29:32] also when his his wife came
[1:29:37] back and she also had the same
[1:29:43] F so no matter where you are
[1:29:47] now no matter who you
[1:29:52] are God is able to localize
[1:29:56] you when you trust in
[1:29:59] him as tonight we are going to see

[1:30:47] up but out of nothing God the light out
[1:30:51] of and God say let
[1:30:55] and and and when light came out so
[1:30:58] before light what was

[1:31:06] everything the one who controls
[1:31:08] everything it is God
[1:31:10] himself when you facing a

[1:36:44] something when you were younger maybe
[1:36:46] one day you were reading years ago maybe
[1:36:49] a dream you maybe a a
[1:36:52] dream forgot about that dream God
[1:36:55] doesn't
[1:36:57] forget and Joseph didn't
[1:37:01] forget all the time he
[1:37:04] passed he never had another
[1:37:06] dream only the two dream he had in and
[1:37:10] those two dreams caus him
[1:37:12] trouble maybe he was a little
[1:37:15] proud when he was having
[1:37:17] dreams what is going to
[1:37:20] happen and the devil work
[1:37:24] because he want to choke
[1:37:26] it but you can't choke the word of
[1:37:30] God for that to
[1:37:32] happen they had to sell
[1:37:35] him they have to put him in a p but he
[1:37:38] could not
[1:37:39] die because the promise was already
[1:37:42] there Joseph didn't even
[1:37:45] mind he was not even murmuring you
[1:37:50] see maybe you going through the same
[1:37:52] situation
[1:37:54] but when you face situations you start
[1:37:57] murmuring oh I pray too much I pray unto
[1:38:01] the Lord I the Lord I I made
[1:38:06] my yes you did it but you don't know my

[1:38:26] Joseph
[1:38:28] they he went
[1:38:32] to and then he got in trouble with for
[1:38:36] wife then Joseph
[1:38:39] look
[1:38:42] woman this is not the woman I want to
[1:38:44] marry in my
[1:38:45] life what God told
[1:38:48] me
[1:38:49] is the people will Bow Down
[1:38:54] but if I go with this
[1:38:58] woman and I'm a slave right
[1:39:00] here you see what going to happen to me
[1:39:04] he said no I cannot do something like he
[1:39:06] could not
[1:39:07] do because he knew the
[1:39:10] great the promise God gave him amen
[1:39:14] amen what is
[1:39:17] really we neglect so much the word even
[1:39:21] when the Bible says
[1:39:23] that there is a pillar of
[1:39:26] fire there is a cloud of witness that
[1:39:29] are observing
[1:39:31] us do you know that
[1:39:33] scripture we usually
[1:39:36] think that it's only those that are
[1:39:38] looking at
[1:39:39] us maybe it's my brother my
[1:39:42] sister if I se here somebody will see
[1:39:46] me so let me go far away and see in in
[1:39:50] in in secr because somebody not watching
[1:39:53] me here no no no no that's not what the
[1:39:56] script say there is a cloud of
[1:40:03] witnesses who went through the scripture
[1:40:06] in a hard
[1:40:07] situation there was RAB the Harlot you
[1:40:11] know the Harlot The
[1:40:13] Prostitute but she's the one that gave
[1:40:15] birth to
[1:40:17] Boaz she's somebody watching you
[1:40:21] also when you say
[1:40:24] oh my life has been abused or somebody
[1:40:26] took advantage of me but the god of RAB
[1:40:31] is the same God to take care of there is
[1:40:34] a witness watching you there is aab
[1:40:37] watching
[1:40:38] you when you see the woman at the
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:43] well those are references that you have
[1:40:47] look at the situation you go
[1:40:49] through when you look at Anna in the
[1:40:51] scripture
[1:40:53] was it's a cloud of
[1:40:55] witness and I can say I was in the same
[1:40:58] situation like child but when I look
[1:41:01] unto the
[1:41:02] Lord the lord always deliver children
[1:41:06] the Bible
[1:41:07] says that trouble always happen to the
[1:41:10] just men but the
[1:41:13] Lord deliver him out of all of
[1:41:16] them what does he mean my
[1:41:21] friend often trial comes to the
[1:41:26] meaning your sickness is only
[1:41:30] for your crisis is for a period of time
[1:41:34] your situation is for a period of time
[1:41:37] your difficulties is for a period of
[1:41:39] time there will be another period of
[1:41:42] time that you will
[1:41:44] beered that you will be
[1:41:47] blessed will be in
[1:41:49] Joy that's why the Bible
[1:41:52] says the Lord will deliver him out of
[1:41:55] all of
[1:41:56] them when they say always means always
[1:41:59] there is not a period of time amen
[1:42:03] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:10] Lord God is able to find
[1:42:14] you David wherever you
[1:42:19] are there is a croud of witness that is
[1:42:23] there is a cloud watching
[1:42:25] you so look at all those
[1:42:30] Heroes what God did with
[1:42:35] them so you can put your faith into
[1:42:43] action there is a story here on the
[1:42:46] wings
[1:42:47] of
[1:42:51] snow brother BR preach that
[1:42:54] 19 65 I
[1:43:04] believe this is Brother Bram himself
[1:43:07] telling the story of what happened to
[1:43:09] him in
[1:43:14] Johannesburg brother say he met a young

[1:49:24] listen to the prayer of brother
[1:49:26] BR because prayer
[1:49:28] changes according to the
[1:49:34] circumstances there are certain
[1:49:36] situation you don't need to
[1:49:39] pray there are people who were healed
[1:49:42] without
[1:49:45] prayer people that were forgiven without
[1:49:48] asking forgiveness to Jesus
[1:49:52] decision they took in their
[1:49:56] heart the way they already repented in
[1:49:58] their
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:01] heart that if I can only touch the H of
[1:50:05] his that will take care of the
[1:50:09] situation so to receive something from
[1:50:12] God you need to have a revelation of
[1:50:14] your
[1:50:16] situation so do not limit God to one
[1:50:20] place because God can move in

[2:02:47] you're going to come out of that
[2:02:49] trial and God won't be surprised when
[2:02:51] you

[2:03:07] children of Israel in the prois and to
[2:03:10] take
[2:03:11] off when he spoke to
[2:03:14] Joshua God never left Joshua
[2:03:17] alone you will notice that when
[2:03:22] facing
[2:03:24] Jericho it was God that took care of the
[2:03:26] situation all they did was going around
[2:03:28] the
[2:03:30] city just going around
[2:03:32] and and Jer was brought
[2:03:36] down it's true you got fight that you
[2:03:39] have to
[2:03:42] fight and but there are some of them you
[2:03:44] don't need to
[2:03:46] fight and only God can fight those for
[2:03:50] you and when you are in the middle
[2:03:53] of just remember you are not
[2:03:56] alone when he told
[2:03:59] josua he said he never left
[2:04:03] Joshua even before
[2:04:06] Jordan he never
[2:04:10] forua he
[2:04:14] told you're the one that will fight with

[2:04:49] sea when Moses stretch the
[2:04:53] road but it was the eyes of God that
[2:04:55] look at the SE and the SE got
[2:05:00] Fe so always trust the
[2:05:05] Lord take the promises of
[2:05:09] God and present them unto
[2:05:13] him every trial that come in your
[2:05:17] life present the word of God

[2:05:32] amen who shall lay charge upon God
[2:05:38] El it's not because we are the way we
[2:05:43] are because in this flesh God already SP
[2:05:47] God already told us we

[2:05:53] princess meaning there is a part of this
[2:05:57] body that is bring down to a lot of

[2:06:14] way you
[2:06:16] just no matter

[2:06:25] situation but he a god of
[2:06:29] variety he knows how to deal with each
[2:06:32] one
[2:06:34] individ I'm going to show you
[2:06:37] Moses Moses was before the Red Sea he
[2:06:41] faced the Red
[2:06:43] Sea he was an
[2:06:45] obstacle behind him Pharaoh in front of
[2:06:49] him
[2:06:51] never
[2:06:52] regretted he never
[2:06:54] murmured he had trust in the
[2:06:57] Lord God told
[2:07:01] him he told him raise the
[2:07:04] road and then the he
[2:07:08] Pard look at that
[2:07:11] same whenu
[2:07:13] the before
[2:07:15] the what happened there God told Joshua
[2:07:22] maybe he could have taken the rooses to
[2:07:25] do that
[2:07:26] off but at that
[2:07:30] time take the
[2:07:32] of the of the
[2:07:37] Prest meaning that the priest were
[2:07:39] walking unconscience of the of the of
[2:07:43] the and the Jordan parted together you
[2:07:46] see what I'm
[2:07:48] saying and when Elijah
[2:07:52] El
[2:07:54] came I thought they're going to do the
[2:07:56] same
[2:07:57] thing maybe the road of maybe look for
[2:08:02] so that a priest can walk but at that
[2:08:05] point they took the man they took the
[2:08:08] man and struck
[2:08:10] the the situation
[2:08:12] change but one
[2:08:16] day greatest
[2:08:23] to
[2:08:26] the when he was facing
[2:08:29] water thought maybe he would take
[2:08:33] the maybe use theu
[2:08:52] [Applause]
[2:08:54] he's more
[2:08:56] he's going
[2:08:59] through upon your situation upon your
[2:09:02] situation do it he can do it he's
[2:09:10] he look
[2:09:12] at look
[2:09:14] Ates look
[2:09:17] at no matter the
[2:09:19] problem Jesus
[2:09:22] and he will
[2:09:24] walk the same way he walk upon the
[2:09:28] Water he will walk upon your problem God
[2:09:31] bless
[2:09:32] [Applause]
[2:09:46] you praise
[2:09:49] God Amen amen amen amen amen amen amen
[2:09:53] amen amen let's give the Lord a big clap
[2:10:02] of
[2:10:04] Glory what a landing my friend every
[2:10:08] situation is specific with Moses he was
[2:10:12] the road with Joshua he was the feet of
[2:10:14] the priest with Elijah and Elisha he was
[2:10:18] the mentor but with the master of the
[2:10:20] world he just walk upon him what is your
[2:10:23] situation tonight what is your problem
[2:10:26] tonight the master is still there the
[2:10:29] same yesterday today and forever let's
[2:10:33] give him a big clap
[2:10:46] again and I'm glad he's the god of
[2:10:49] variety because he will conf use the
[2:10:51] devil if he's waiting for this weapon he
[2:10:54] open another weapon and he can do even
[2:10:57] something he never done before and he
[2:11:00] can start a new Bible with you because
[2:11:02] we are written a people read from all
[2:11:05] men so he can do more than what is
[2:11:08] written in the Bible because the Bible
[2:11:10] say nothing is impossible to God the
[2:11:13] Bible say there are many miracle that
[2:11:15] Jesus did that are not written right
[2:11:18] here so don't limit God to what is here
[2:11:21] have a big faith God can do
[2:11:24] Beyond something that never happened
[2:11:32] before let me ask you a question the
[2:11:34] Bible say there are many things many
[2:11:36] miracle that Jesus did that are not
[2:11:39] written here who can tell me what it is
[2:11:42] since you don't know don't limit me I
[2:11:45] can believe whatever I want to believe
[2:11:48] because you are not there so whatever
[2:11:50] the spirit put in my heart to believe he
[2:11:53] belongs to
[2:11:55] me he's a god of paradox no matter how
[2:11:59] big the situation is God is able to
