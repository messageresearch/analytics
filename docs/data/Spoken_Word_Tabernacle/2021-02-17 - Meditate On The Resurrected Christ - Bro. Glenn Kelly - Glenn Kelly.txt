things begin to open up again open up again open up again and say wow blessed be the name of the lord i was at work and the lord reminded me of a scripture on top and i'm going to give it to you on sunday where the bible says you cannot delay in giving your child [Laughter] young people we got you all covered so once you got your paycheck get your tithe out and take care of it amen i'm going to give you the scripture i'm going to put it on the projector so nobody say you didn't get it you're going to have a full court smear don't delay in giving your tired you get it get it out and the lord also won't delay on his blessings amen you put god first watch out what's going to happen amen that's what we wanted we want a church to be free the church that prosper we want to go read malachi 4 you will see that the the righteous were complaining they say how we don't see we are there we are worshiping the lord we are serving the lord and it seems like there is no difference go watch malachi uh four bill malachi 3 and the lord gave a promise that from there on you're going to see the difference between those that serve me and those that don't serve me amen you want to see that difference put god first amen hallelujah young people we love you but i gotta rob that black dog out amen so you pray for me lord willing on sunday then we're going to get in your marriage and get and get and get what do you need to get married we wipe wipe wipe until you be totally free so you continue on the reading with proverbs 7 and 1st corinthians 7. because of the time we took on sunday i could not get into that so we don't want to weary you so lord's willing i believe the world the the weather will be completely clear on sunday they are calling for maybe a nice in the morning hopefully we can pray god so that goes away except for people that don't want to go to work so if you got to go to work so you need to pray so everything will be all right so lord's willing reading proverbs 7 and 1st corinthians 7 again we must send you this on the text brother david does a great job on that one so just meditate don't wait for me to don't wait to get here just read it at home pray over it the holy the holy ghost might begin even to minister unto you before even you get here so once you get here you are completely wired connected and everything will be all right amen blessed be the name of the lord lord's willing not this saturday but next saturday we will start our work day for the church so if you don't have anything to do you're not working you're fine you're not tired from cooking and all kinds of stuff you want to jump in it's going to be from 10 o'clock to 2 p.m you know the address you can pitch in we are start we're going to start moving stuff up just clearing stuff so whenever the contractor comes they can begin to do work little by little by god's grace so continue to pray the lord has been opening doors little by little last night i met somebody who heard about the church he looked at me he said brother stephen this is my contribution to the work of the lord when i opened the envelope do you want me to tell you how much it was it for building fun you are curious 1600 cash he doesn't even attend this church he just heard them saw me just pulled the envelope handed him so i'm going to take the envelope and give it either to the trustees and they're going to see their way through and puts on on the building fine so that to me is the holy ghost moving in and begin to open doors so the bible says if you don't want to cry what are what is god going to do he's going to take rocks if you don't want to do your part god will open doors somewhere they told esther either you do what you got to do or deliverance what comes for somewhere amen so do your part the door will open the doors i don't know how i hate depths i hate them and even i have a scripture for it but i also have a quote that balance it if you want to have a mortgage and everything so don't go home condemn because you got more my mortgage i got a quote for it so you're good amen praise the name of the lord but i don't like it so if we can do the best that we can and avoid it that would be better amen so tonight i have brother kelly i ask him to minister tonight you know brother kelly there is no much i can say you know him he is one of our deacon here he's going to take his liberty and go ahead and preach the word of the lord whatever the lord put in his heart you take your liberty and go ahead and minister only believe amen only believe [Music] only believe all things are [Music] possible [Music] oh [Music] okay let us pray let's go before the lord lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy lord jesus we thank you lord god for the opportunity to come before such a precious group your precious bride lord god we thank you for putting me on the pastor's heart lord god and bless him bless his family bless the deacons the trustees and the members lord god and all those that are streaming in lord jesus we come just giving you praise giving your honor giving you glory on tonight father because we look unto the hill to where our strength and our help cometh from lord god so we're looking for you lord god to come and back the word lord god that you have given us to share with your precious children on tonight and we promise to give you the praises the honor and the glory we bring every spirit under subjection lord god that try to trouble the hearts and the mind of your children on tonight father so get glory to thy name and give glory to thy kingdom we thank you in jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah i think the lord is doing some great things and we uh brother robert you all keep him up in prayer i tell you the lord has richly anointed him to to do the work that he's doing for the building right now and the trustees and all of your prayers we thank you all so we won't prolong the time we got uh scriptures uh tonight so i hope you got your path i think we're just gonna look at a little lesson and piggyback on what the lord has been doing okay so of all hearts and mind are clear and you're ready ask the lord to forgive you for anything we don't want anything hindering the word or your blessing tonight go to matthew 22 hallelujah we're going to look at verse 37 we'll read that one and then we'll um go to uh isaiah 26 and 3 and then you may be seated have it say amen amen okay jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind let's go to isaiah 26. and hallelujah i tell you with atmosphere like this and hear it tonight anything can happen okay okay verse 3. he said thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know we just want to um get right into the word by the grace of god it may be like a sunday school lesson we looked at it but then god's going to have his way we're going to get out of the way and let him have this way amen we're coming there we know that it's wednesday and it's the middle of the week but you know some call it the hump day but i call it the blessing day for those i call it a refilling day for those that serve in the lord is that right so in him you know we're looking at a little thought tonight it's called meditate meditate you know we're going to look at some scriptures because i've been looking to see where the holy spirit's been moving he's been talking about the white dog the black dog and see how the lord is troubling us you know but he also said that do you know these things started we're at in the mind is that right and so we know that we have to lord teaches us to cast down any imagination and try to exhort itself against the word of god so we want to look at a few definitions and live foundation before we get started but we wanted to want you to realize you know that the lord has been bringing us been working in that area even when we were over at the old church you know he started working with the mind he was saying about the mind and the heart and how it works you know you can get away with lies and things while you're still alive and things like that is that right is that buddy also the lord shared with us but now once that mind goes if someone is in the hospital if someone is there and you're praying for them and you ask them that they do something and they're still operating on the intellectual conception is that right they can still tell you yes yes but though they really haven't repented yet and so now when the brain goes now you're dealing with the heart and the soul is that right now they have to answer the truth so we want to just kind of build on those things and what the lord has been showing us because we want to show you how we can stop satan right there we know the prophet of god preached the greatest battle ever fought is that right but we'll show you just by you meditating on the word of god how you will richly bless you how you will move into your position because god has already told us right he stopped that referendum and we stopped the referendum he said that what that we're now is supposed to be moving into our position is that right we have past justification we thank god sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the lord is moving us into our what adoption position is that right the last time we were here we were talking about those things about with them joshua you know when joshua he was a warrior i love joshua and i love david it's just something that just moves my spirit about joshua and david no we was there we we were here and we were sharing with you by the grace of god that we know joshua had a divine commandment from god and he had that divine commandment from from god and that's one of the scriptures we're going to look at but i don't want to get ahead of myself let's look at the definition and things that we wrote down here definition and synonyms of um meditate and our topic is meditate on jesus the resurrection is that right we want to keep our mind on him you know meditate there in the hebrew is a device a device is a form in the mind by by combination thoughts mind by new combinations or applicants is that right you're always going to get thoughts that devils run through your mind you're not out of your mind because you have mind battles everybody have mind battles is that right because god left that to be the battleground it's just a matter of how you handle it that's what it is is that right so we handle it in his age and now the holy spirit also told us where we have been given a word that can defeat the what the black dog and the white dog is that right the flesh in the soul you should be able to live victorious in this hour here now and is that right god is ritually blessing you god is richly bringing us into the position see it's not by power it's not by might but it's by your spirit saith the lord so we will tell you when the holy ghost come the holy ghost is not anything light the holy ghost is a power it's even for you to walk right is that for you to talk right let me for you to love right saying for you to pray right is that it for you to dress right is everything for you to do right is that for you to sing right all these things the holy ghost has come so that we may live a victorious life not a defeated life but a victorious life is that right he sat down look he says and also it's a misuse news news is a stimulation we're going to show you something what happened with uh david at near the end when we get near the end lord it was just i don't have many quotes tonight but it was one quote that kind of pricked my heart that david said and why little bethlehem and and you'll see it it says imagine inspiration that's meditate okay now we're talking about now look at the webster the webster because we're going to have some words that we want to use but it's going to be right in the line with meditators okay he says to focus one's thoughts or to ponder over a plan or project in the mind is that right so god also if you're looking at or studying some of the messages we know that you said time during the day you want your quiet time you need your quiet time is that right to meditate with god so god can give you a direction which way to go because each day we wake up we thank the lord for another day so we ask the lord what is your will for me today lord is that right so we come in here we don't we'll show you we don't have to be afraid of anything is that right god has given us a word the prophet told us way back in prophesizing that there was going to be a plague a pandemic come on the land didn't he he said they were going to look to dr jones to give an answer but this time it was dr fossey is that right he also told him that they was going to use what lysol is that right people you couldn't even keep a light soul on the shelf is that right he told them that some of them say they will stay in the house is that right he also said that some of them said they put on a what a mask is that right tell me the prophet of god wasn't on the money but he said the only thing is going to keep them is the blood of jesus christ the baptism of the holy ghost that's what he said so we know that what's going to keep us so now when you go out and you witness the word of god you want to tell somebody about the blood of jesus christ and tell them about calvary because they're running around with the fear demon on them but the prophet warned us you're way ahead of this time before some of us was even born he warned us is that right meditate on the word of god meditate on thus say the lord he's coming in and let's go to joshua 1 and 8. i won't read it at all we know joshua got the commandment but joshua also we know the type of the holy ghost and joshua also recognized his position when joshua recognized his position that's where the holy spirit is moving you into once you move into your position you see then you have with that confidence god is that right because you're not going to be moved because a commission a commission from god has to be fulfilled it will be fulfilled whether you like it or not if you gotta humble you down if you're gonna share the word or if you're like sometimes you gotta crack the whip on us huh huh but that's love all that i chastise and i rebuke it all those the ones that i love is that right he said be seriously and do what repent is that right he said look what he said joshua 1 and 8. he said this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall what meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have what good success so he's telling you all you have to do is meditate on the word of god that you're hearing every day and you apply it is that right so now when god says something now it has to be a result is that right this is the latter rain and this is the former rain time is that right now we cannot have just the mechanics without the dynamics is that right so the word of god is being brought in this hour here to let them know that the resurrected christ is not dead but he's alive is that right i love those testimony we have a testimony tonight when he said someone just god went out someone's prayers just went out and touched somebody's heart and it touched their heart and god touched their heart and he brought that offering unto the lord god bless him whoever he is or she is hallelujah so we're talking about meditating joshua knew that he had that commission when joshua was there joshua not only got the commission from god but once joshua then he went out and he got in his position once got joshua moved into his position then joshua met what the angel is that right the angel over the look of the lord which was the or the lord of hosts which was who christ is that right the anointed and joshua knew his position though right what joshua did he immediately pulled his sword is that right he knew his position if thou be with us or against us and then the angel identified himself joshua immediately fell on his face and did what lord and humbled himself like what does he have me to do we just we're not going to get stuck on joshua tonight though cause i can preach all night there on joshua i just love joshua but we're going to look at some other scriptures we're talking about look at psalms chapter 1 and let's see here what the lord by his grace and by his mercy he had there in in this it's a lot in there even the prophet of god kind of hit some things out of that the scripture there and i always loved uh psalms chapter one once you have it say amen he said now he's telling you now remember we share you and meditate if you meditate on the word you will live a victorious life if you mix the word with faith that's right brother mike if you lit the world with faith if you go in there you know if you own your job is that right they're paying you to do that job when brother steve when he leave it he's a dentist is that right he's the dentist he did but he's his own proprietor that's his practice so the times when i go there i drop a little word on him we get a little fellowship but i know he's that there under the anointing of a dentist at that time right so he had to keep his mind on that position there at that time when he's here he's what he's a pastor is that right so he's meditating on his position there is being a pastor when you are on your job you're always a christian you're always a son you're always the daughter of god but you have to rightfully divide when you're in a certain position is that right so you have to understand you know we were in school some children had problems and the problems that they had when they get to middle school you know you change classes now ah what's that adolescent huh huh you changed school i mean you changed classes then is that right we used to have some guys they didn't realize okay you got english you know we tried to get the tough classes in the morning you know you didn't want your tough classes after lunch you drowsy you're lazy you don't feel like doing so you try to get your tough classes schedule in the morning when you're fresh is that right so when we get there when you go in the school maybe you got english first period is that right maybe you got the history second period you have to change your thought pattern you have to change your position for every class you see what i'm saying so then some children have problems changing their position is that right so by them not changing their position they get themselves in trouble maybe they come from gym and all of a sudden you got to go to history but they still got that anointing on them from jim you know and it won't settle themselves down they won't settle their spirit down well we have to understand now god is bringing us into another disposition he's bringing you into the disposition that's what joshua was joshua was moving into the third pole joshua did not have to go back to god and ask god god had already sent joshua on the mission god had already sent you on a commission god had already sent me on the commission so god sent us out here to finish the work and he finished with the work not a defeated life but a victory of life the holy ghost come down on you it's the holy ghost and pow wow the holy ghost has come to fulfill the pain of redemption we're calling you saints we can't get out of it right now we're living a victorious life we're pushing the devil back we do not have to live in any defeated life we don't have to accept anything from the devil is that right they have one scripture one scripture in the wilderness ah one scripture look at all that we have there one scripture the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases ah all thy diseases when the sickness come upon you it's trespassing we know oh um whatever it is kovic 19 try to come against you his trespassing is that right you don't have to accept anything i mean brother random said the devil come at him and his body he said i'll fight him all the way until i go to sleep huh you don't have to accept anything you're trespassing you know i wanted to share i wanted to preach a message on a testimony maybe the lord's willing another time but let us stick with this this thought here meditate humility look what he says here hallelujah because i want to get these scriptures in i i i tell you it says blessed is the man that walked not in the counsel of the what ungodly nor standing from the way of the sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scorn he said but his the light is in the law of the lord and in his law doith he what meditate day and night he's always looking to thinking about things eternal he's always looking and thinking to get the promise that god made that he's going to come get us one day we know we have two lives you got a natural life you got a spiritual life but when you're in there fighting when you end up fighting that old black dog you got to understand all you have to do is meditate on that word god says when the enemy come in like a flood he will lift up a mighty standard against them is that what he said so we bring that word in there david had a revelation of that david had a revelation of god's grace uh how did noah get out of it let's go let's go and turn back to genesis and we'll come back to psalms it just dropped in my spirit look at genesis 6 hallelujah look what the lord he was telling us there uh what the lord was bringing for us sunday morning he got in there he says now we know that let's start at verse one and it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth the daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the doors of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they which they chose now what see the lord is trying to share with them you got to understand noah took a stand you took a stand we are taking a stand and our example is the way jesus christ stands so we have to understand in this hour here now that christ never inhaled anything okay once that word went out it did not go out the void it went and it was going to produce what it was supposed to produce god saw us before the foundation of the world you are sons and daughter of the most high god you got to understand god chose you to fight a battle is that right and the battle that he chose chose us to fight so you have to be careful see what are you getting all these words for what is god revealing all this word for to you for you just to sit and become complacent or we got to keep our commission go ye all the world and preach the gospel we're go in and tell someone about the good news of christ going in and let them know that if you need prayer that we got someone that can pray for you we have soldiers that can touch heaven for you we got soldiers that can go to the heavenly bank for you with confidence is that right god is bringing god is bringing us into a position where you recognize that your prayers will be answered is that right so now we're not just looking to come and be a a religious spirit we don't want that religious spirit on us we want to take this word and we want to apply it you understand no one shouldn't have to come in here and tell you to get up and praise the lord is that right you come in the door dancing prancing singing along giving god his glory is that right because this is what is all god in having the praises of his saints is that right satan hate to see you praising the lord he know that we're going through things he know that we're struggling but we have a god that's going to see us through it is that right [Applause] we speak about faith is that right satan is just a tool to move us closer to perfection that's all he is he's a bluff he's a defeated enemy jesus christ defeated him on calvary is that right jesus christ came in paid the price for you and i is that right god could not have sent an angel for you for me god could not have sent that angel for you god had to come down himself we needed a kissman redeemer we had to come down so you are kim folks coming folks to god is that right glory to god look what he said they talked to wife someone you wonder why you got trouble and really why you got trouble because you didn't do it according to god's way so if you do it god's way you know where you then god is going to work it out and if something happened what the lord show us is not if you're being tested you're being tested by god but if you're being tempted you're being tempted of your what of your own lust is that right so now god's coming in and he's sending us a word in this in this hour so god showed us sunday there's no excuse for you can't have authority over your flesh no excuse you know you got to come on up hither you know god has saved the best for last hallelujah look what he's saying verse 3 says and the lord said my spirit shall not always what strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be hundred and twenty years the lord showed us he shortened those days didn't he seem like it was a long time but he showed us he's short in those days and not only did he shorten those days god came and showed us and that by the garments by prophecy by the royal garments is not much longer is that right he's shown us he showed us there that when we came with the adoption the adoption you know you're always a child of god you're always a son i mean a child but some never move into their position to get their full adoption is that right because when the holy spirit comes minister simple things to you about your dress code or different things you're still struggling with sanctification oh say it like it is i still love you but now you're coming around in there right we're talking about now moving into the baptism of the holy ghost when the holy ghost come there he's dealing with you but he's not there yet to seal you is because he got to get you under obedience he that obeyed the word of god god give them the holy ghost is that right and once they get the holy ghost now you can move into your position now he has something inside of you which is his spirit that he can work with is that right he can teach you he can train you he can lead you he can guide you he can use you he can work with you and that's all we bring you into this is not religion this is salvation the joy of the lord is my strength when you think about what jesus did for you on calvary when you get there think about the goodness of the blood and the thorns that he took every mind battle that you have he took it to calvary he shed his blood for you and i [Music] hallelujah look what he says he said now look he said now look at the purpose of this judgment and god saw verse 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth that every imagination in the what thoughts of his heart was only evil what continuously so what you got to remember now if god says he's not going to always strive with man that means he's not going to always keep pleading with man what he's going to do he's going to pos he's not going to pardon this destruction so he's saying this destruction that's coming it will not be pardoned it's for the wicked because they continuously go in hard don't think that you don't have a testimony when they're coming in and brother john or brother abel i'm gonna come and ask you for a testimony you know we had a testimony we had a sister and we was down in south carolina and if you again shot me she went on to be with the lord but she had a testimony every time we hit the door one day we was there we first walked there at home uh uh a walmart and they used to give us the old liquid detergent and get this whole empty bottle and they had to just keep the jug and we would take the liquid it was busting just pour it in the jug so they would give it to us and uh one day and the lord just put it on my heart and i got there and i knocked on the door and i said we got some liquid detergent uh can you use it and you know she got it she says her and her daughter was living together and it was her time to buy the liquid detergent that week and you know when you're on a fixed income you know that's a lot for you you know you get around it i mean you can get extra little bit extra meat maybe bread or something or potatoes but when she got the church boy i'll tell you she told that testimony like it was like a thousand dollars somebody came and knocked on her door always keep a testimony on your heart it shows that our christ is not dead but he's alive he's living in us to tell the devil don't like it i better stay on my lesson because we'll get to that lesson a little later hallelujah help me lord he said now look so god is not going to pardon but what he's doing is he he he was heavy in his heart that he repented he made man but what you have to realize young men young women you know we some of us out there we got the hormone and drugging and drinking and smoking and doing things you know we thank god for deliver us we thank god for saving our soul we thank god for those things but you know what y'all got a greater testimony you know why because you got a god that's keeping you from all that you could kind of god from keeping you from those things you got a god that's watching over you greater is he that is indeed than he that is in the world you got a testimony huh hallelujah [Music] look what he says he said hallelujah work continuously we have another one look look at let's go back to psalms 1. hallelujah see what the lord help us on this one here just a point by the grace of god kind of struck my spirit is psalms 1 hallelujah it says then but verse 2 but his delight is in the law of the lord and his and in his law doeth he meditate day and night he says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth who his fruit and what his season is that right he's in the sun in season his leaf also shall not what wither and whatsoever he does shall up prosperous is that right because now you know in that scripture brother branham talked about that he typed it with the nine spiritual gifts he came in there and he's talked about it those gifts are sitting up in here you are not to be ashamed of those gifts if god put those gifts in you god put those gifts in you to bless his people they come in there and those singers he brought you in to drive those demon forces away and he anointed you he positioned you stop fighting and kicking against the prick you can't get away from it you've been chosen for your position before the foundation of the world speaking in tongues prophesizing interpretation he said those not spiritual gifts is in the body of jesus christ all of them is here says just humble yourself get into that prayer life get laid before god get in that position let god use you let him have his way hallelujah [Applause] look what he says hallelujah help me lord turn to psalms 119. thank you jesus i tell you what let's go to psalms 37 first it says look here in this one and i think we'll go for the sake of time let us go from 26 we'll start at verse 26 psalms 37 and verse 26 although the habits say amen okay here a few pages let us look at it meditate and you meditate with the lord keep in your mind on the word of the lord you'll live a victorious life he said now look i said thirty we'll start at verse 26. it says he is ever merciful and and lindeth and his seed is what blessed he says hallelujah depart from evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the lord love his judgment and forsake not his saints you'll never be forsaken you've never seen the righteous forsaken or seed beggar from bed they are preserved what forever is that right god has preserved you not only to eternal life he preserved you to finish this work why we're here on this earth and you know you have eternal life because it's already been paid for is that right we recognize with the blood of jesus christ has did for each and every one of us saints he says hallelujah he says verse but verse 28 for the lord love his judgment and forsake not his saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell there forever he says and the you and the mouth of the righteous speaketh what wisdom you see you trusted in the word of the lord trust in the lord in all thy ways lean not to thy own understanding he will lead he will god he will direct your path some of you are taking college classes college courses some of you there but god never knocked education but when you to when your back gets up against the wall and all that you have learned is all your education can produce you remember the word of the lord is that right you turn to the lord and the lord would come in because your motive and your objective is to glorify the lord heard brother randall say one time when you go out and preach the gospel you gotta ask god first to give you a word to go into that heart is that right you got to get a word to go into that heart you got to get the gospel anointed vessel anointing you got to be called by god you got to be anointed by god by the word of god for the timing of god in the position of god it's all by god jesus said when i come i do nothing unless the father what show me is that right when he went there to the grave he went to the grave and he told lazarus god told him to go to the grave when he went to that grave he knew he was going to raise lazarus he would have called the whole world and then that is that right but remember the man that had the palsy and he was on the bed is that right or when the woman had the issues of blood we got an issue maybe somebody's troubling tonight with an issue all you got to do is touch jesus and all you got to do is annoying that touch jesus cry out from your heart really mean it tell god that you're sorry and god will come in and he will make it right and then the next thing uh i remember brother branham said you got to do what you got to go to that forwarding problem you got to ask god to bring that problem do something fun with that problem is that right but the only way he's going to go through that problem the preacher got to understand and the one that needed to be here he'll have to understand god is only going to do it for the glory of god is that right it has to be for the glory of god is that right because we're sent to finish the what the plan of redemption the holy ghost was sent so that we can become one with god is that right and so we can increase our prayer life is that right how do you build up your most holy faith is that right i'll tell you what how they get a refilling that's why i call this a refill hold your hand right there for a minute it just dropped turn the axe forward you know come i'm gonna sit this right here turn the ax4 you know you got to get a refilling sometime why you think the holy ghost been telling the pastor to tell you to pray pray when you're in the shower pray when you're walking pray when you're on the job pray when you're when you're driving pray that time pray when you're just when you're cooking pray when you lose your man pray pray

don't worry the only one can give you eight hours in three and four hours sleep is god god can give you eight hours of sleep in three hours huh if it's for the glory of god huh this ain't just no show we're talking about busting the devil in the head because we're talking about sometimes you know your prayer warriors sometimes you lay there god had to train me too i ain't preaching the jew i throw my hands up too god had to train me too when i lay there my eyes won't go back to sleep he won't let me go back to sleep i know what he tells you you need to go on and get in there and pray that's always turning to her brother steve i know you trouble i know the holy ghost get on you sometimes like that when he really really really really when his children or somebody needs something when they get around there and then i say okay brother one they have to start just two hours maybe some of you could just pray for two hours then you work two hours then you work up to three hours and after three hours you work up to four hours you see and getting there in in in prayer they said that brother on the zuzu street look at all we got they said that brother on zuzu street said he played six and seven hours like it wasn't nothing wow look at this refilling wasn't they there for peter huh then one of their brother after john the baptist got his head chopped off and then peter about to get his head chopped off i'm just preaching now things and then when he got his head when he got his head chopped off is that right when uh they was going to get peter is that right when they went to do what they needed prayer they needed all night prayer they needed somebody it's just like a mother when that baby is maybe getting in the car wreck or something like that now that child needs all-night prayer mama ain't thinking about no job mama ain't thinking about mama's thinking about a baby if you're gonna fall down in there is that right they was thinking about peter is that right they went in the prayer for peter and the angel of the lord went and got peter is that right got him out of that jail hallelujah we're still looking here or refilling hallelujah what'd i say acts chapter 4 hallelujah god is building this house god is building this house a lot of y'all thinkers we're still talking about meditating some of you are thinkers thinkers i'll i'll say it this way you have to even all believers do but especially thinkers you have to have a prayer life you'll overthink it and the devil make you think is right you got to have a prayer life because you make sure and you need that answer from god when you you know you know you need that answer from god that's why joshua that's why david when he went into battles he wanted to make sure that god was with him i wanted to make sure that god is here with me you just don't want to get up and preach you just don't want to be in front of no uh god's people just to be preaching you don't want to go off in the way of preaching i'm telling you god is doing some great things in here and when that message i'm telling you that black dog and that white dog god's doing something he's making it so simple a child can receive it it'll be the dog i ain't never like no dog to try to tell me tell me what to do i don't know dogs went around there and you feed them and then you tell them come on buddy yeah i didn't train he'd look at you and then going on the run off and i think going to me and run off and then he wanted to come back whatever i said i'll tell you what i never had a dog that was going to control me and i'm the one feeding them too i think we need to find you another home dog huh i think satan do the black dog you need to get on up out of here you see what i'm saying it's satan come oh what do you got he's bringing a spirit of disobedience that's all he's bringing with him he's keeping you from what growing and moving in the revelation of the word it gets you growing and moving keeping you from moving into your position hallelujah meditating on the word of god look what he says for hallelujah i'll tell you what for the sake of time let's go down here at uh let's come over to uh verse 23 verse 23 and begin and being let go they went into their own company and reported all the chief priests and elders they had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice of god with one accord and said lord thou art god you see with david before we get to the end see what david was looking at when we get to this this before we close out help us lord he says he says who by the mouth of the servant david has said why did the heathen rage and imagine vain things and is that right because now in the gospel now they're getting mad they're getting upset he got testimony the pastor stood up and told testimony tonight he's telling me what jesus christ is not dead he's alive he can't stop that move over there they can't stop that move what's going over there god gave it to us if god gave it to us that's god's natural house but now he's the spiritual house he's getting you ready so any demon forces try to come against you you can speak the word by faith is that right hello no sickness baby testimonies is going to come out of there blinded eyes will be open people will be healed people be delivered the gospel got to come alive again look what he says hallelujah the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered to together against the lord and in christ and against the who this whole thing is setting up you think the catholic church is coming against they already know who you are but they know they can't touch you and you don't have to worry about taking no thought when that time comes with the holy ghost there he'll put the words in your mouth he says i notice i notice about these people they're not taught like the catholics the baptists the methodists the lutherans the scribes the herodians they speak like someone with authority that has been with jesus christ speak the word look what he says hallelujah he says over here for for a verse 27 for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou has anointed both heroin and pontius pilate who says uh pontius pilate people of israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and counsel determined before to be done and now lord behold their threatenings and granted unto their servants that with all boldness they may what speak the word he said by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus god's going to use you to do miraculous work he's going to work through you saints just hold on little brian hold on he said now look hallelujah he says and now he said but by stretching forth thy hand and look at verse 31 here's where we're getting to and when they had prayed the place was what shaken where they was assembly together and they were all filled with the what holy ghost and spake the word of god with what so you want to pray within the holy ghost is that right and it will increase your faith if you want to get that boldness if you want to recognize that presence you increase your prayer life you stand in the gap when god is be obedient when god wants you to get up and pray you prayer warriors that's what god ever called you for god have called you when he want to wake you up to stand in the gap with someone when that name come to you in prayer when that name or someone that you know that that that or you work with or a co-worker when they come to you in prayer is that right you speak that name with boldness and with authority and you claim their salvation god has chosen you is that right god not has only also given us the holy ghost but he's given us the holy ghost because we can grant someone brother steve eternal life is that right what is greater than granting someone eternal life saints god has given you the authority saints don't don't live below your standards huh the only other way black dog you look at that black dog if you got problem with that television with the movies then you ask god to take them the television from you take that desire from your heart is that right you ask god to fill your heart with something else it's just like the holy ghost was saying don't be ashamed because you're struggling with something and you've been around the message for 10 15 years oh well you've been dealing with a religious spirit that's all we're not going we're not connected like they are up there in uh jeffersonville they don't want no fivefold ministry they don't want no five-fold ministry you know that's nothing new if you go for god's um the prophet that god preached the message i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision that was given to me he told him it was going god told him it was going to be like that in jeffersonville go pick up the message it's in that message it's in there you got to understand that god has prepared us he said when he gets he said we are the seed of abraham not just any seed of abraham you're the royal seed of abraham all of this is not for everyone why do you think that the pastor got around there and the lord told him on that message not to record it not to let it out is that right because the prophecy message is that right god knows what he's doing doing the adoption is that right when that what he was ministering he was ministering during the adoption when he come around there when they went to matthew 17 and they went to mountain mount transfiguration is that right he took peter james and john he took faith hope and charity when he took them up there he showed them now it was a type of the adoption he was identifying that jesus christ was the one but when he came down and he said what tell no one what you saw catch it don't record that don't let them know what i gave you come on sanctuary you got the royal garments on you got the royal garments on god is opening his word here this is not religion when you got salvation you live a victorious life the holy ghost is positive the holy ghost comes in and move us into that position hallelujah he says now look and they and they speak the word with boldness let's turn back to um psalms 37 hallelujah hallelujah we're moving good saints removing good psalms 37 i'll tell you what let's look at verse 31 let's look at verse 31 the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall what slide see our god he's in our hearts lord i want to be like jesus in my heart in my heart lord i want to pray like jesus in my heart in my heart lord i want to sing like jesus when you come up and you're singing my sister even at those weary moments and you look weary a little tired let them get get out the way and let jesus do it through you is that right let god get the glory let them just use that gift get yourself out of the way is that right hallelujah he said now look he said the wicked watcheth the righteous and seek seeketh to lay him see they scheming the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is when he is judged he says wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall what exalt thee inherit the land when the wicked are are cut off and thou shall see it he says i have seen the wicked in great power and spread himself like a green bay tree yet he passeth away and lo he has not yet i sought him but he could not be found he says do what his description mark the what the perfect man and behold the upper right who for the for the end of that man is peace we know which we know is christ he said but the transgression shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off he said but what this is what i'm loving but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the what in the time of trouble you call on the lord he is your fortress he is your buckler he's your protector he's your high horn he's the one that's watching over you the angel of the lord and camp around them that fear you is that right you all you have to do is call on the lord saints meditate on the lord day and night bring back his promises to you to him that you read in his word you pray you read his word you mark those promises and then when you need them you bring it back to god is that right come on now look at jacob jacob wasn't the planner is that right brother polycarp when esau was about to get him he laid on that right brother steve and when he laid on that rock what did he do first he spoke to god about the promised seed is that right and after he brought god the prophecy he went on and laid down and witnessed come on saints and you're living righteous imagine what you can get out of god is that right hallelujah look what he says meditate and the lord and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they what they trust in him you trusted in the words that he meditated that you meditated on let's turn to psalms same book look at 119 hallelujah we'll just start with the first verse removing good hallelujah he said and look thank you jesus he says uh yeah 119 blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord he says blessed are they that keep his testimonies and seek him with the what whole heart love thy god with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and all thy strength meditate on the lord he says keep your mind on the lord he says they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways thou has commanded us to keep the precepts diligently his commandments he said oh that my ways were directed to keep the statues he says then shall i not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy what commandments see you you can go with god in confidence now he says i will praise with the upright of heart when i shall learn thy righteousness judgment i would keep thy statues who for forsake oh forsake me not utterly cleanse his way he says with with all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereof according to thy word how you're going to keep your way cleanse young man if you meditate and keep your mind on the lord somewhere you let the black dog come in and drop a word on you is that right he said keeping your mind on the lord steadfast on the lord trust in the lord and all thy ways he will lead in god and direct your past you got a testimony to keep it's not you keeping it as god that's keeping you is that right he got around in there and let me keep going hallelujah because i want to get i want to close out with that david i'ma jump a little bit now he says now he said now look in verse 15 he says i will what meditate in thy precepts his commandments that's what joshua did see joshua remember the commandments of god he meditate on those things is that right so joshua always prosper when joshua got in that land he know he had to fight is that right he still had to fight and the only time when they got in there the gideons got in there when when joshua went to the princesses and joshua didn't go to god is that right so he temporarily did they temporarily deceived them but joshua said okay i gotta keep my word but i'm gonna give you the hard job i mean you're gonna hurt the water you're gonna hold the wood but i'm gonna make you work since you got in here hallelujah when joshua got in that promised land that's what he was telling them he was telling them some of them still hadn't possessed their land yet but when they got in there they still had to fight these wars some of you still fighting mind battles some in the fight i heard the holy spirit say sunday pornography i say the holy spirit is saying watching the wrong movies i see the holy spirit saying you're being entertained with the wrong company come on saints keep thy mind steadfast young men young women if you don't want to err you don't want to fall keep your mind on the promises of god is that right he's able to keep you hallelujah he said meditate in verse 6 verse 16 he said i will delight myself in thy statute i will not forget thy word this term in the same book psalms 112. hallelujah meditating on the word of god psalms 12 and in verse 8 hallelujah he says his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies so there's i think that was that hallelujah i think it was another scripture god joshua that was it hallelujah just bear with me there saints let's look here and i want to read it's one quote that was pressing on me and i tell you it really just kind of dropped i didn't know why but i was looking at the different quotes i tried to get the ins inspiration quotes that god spoke through the prophet that would be a blessing to you but this one here it was in uh why little bethlehem it was 12 14 63 and it was a time when david was basically there on the run and the prophet of god was he came out of he was kind of tired with the message thirst when he was there and he was saying with david what he was doing was probably meditating on the word of god thinking about the goodness of the lord see the goodness of the lord is what leads a man to repentance so we tell them about the good news jesus christ we tell him when we go out there what he's done for us how he can save his soul how he can deliver a person from anything we're not just the seed we're the royal seed of abraham and by us being the royal seed of abraham you know he says that that seed can believe and take god for at his word that's what the holy spirit is mean we we still have an altar call i always will have an altar card you call you have to discern where the people are and once you discern where the people are but what god is getting us to do is just to receive the spoken word and receive the word for for your hour as peter spoke these words did the holy ghost fall on them is that right so we have to understand now that's what he's moving us into but that's why he held the pastor up is that right he had to hold him up because uh the lord is long suffering and the lord is merciful but we're getting close to that time but i wanted to definitely want you to see this here god help me i didn't get to i didn't get to all of it but that's okay the lord is having this way and here i'm going to jump a little bit so you have to just stick with me he was talking about here with he said david was probably there meditating um there on the word of god but then he says he must have come over a different psalms he said the lord is my shepherd i shall not warn he maketh me to lie down in the green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters he restore my soul oh he leadeth be in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and though i walk through the valley in the shadow of death and i fear no evil for thou art with me as thou as thou as he thought as he thought on these things he meditated meditating it must have been a he said must have been a hot day he said he got thirsty and got sweaty he could look way down into the valley from the top of the mountains on the east side of the west side on the east side of the city when he looked down and he seen where the philistines all down there thousands of them garrisons around he's seen he he's seen that old well where he once drank hallelujah he says now he is our bread god's bread and water for us he's the sinner and the only place that you can come and get it it's from it's from him god's house in in the person of jesus christ now david here let's turn to uh and we're about to wind it up let's turn to um ii samuel 22. and here i think the prophet of god was seeing something and when he got over there and in this book here god help me in there i say second samuel then i'm in first down you okay hallelujah now over there in second samuel i mean first samuel i'm sorry first samuel 22 and 1. i'll i'll read it if you're writing it down um you can go back and look at it for the sake of time he says david therefore departed hence and escaped to to the cave at a lamb and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down here to him now this is not the first time david remember david went into this cave david went to this place this was down there and brother stephen something because it's down there near after them and it went down and they want you to see these scriptures and when the things dropped in there i see why the way the lord and why the holy ghost got him going and when he got him going down there he said now look ii samuel 23 and we know david was on the run in first samuel is that right i think saul was at him and was trying to kill him well david went to that cave david was in that hole with david knew in that hole there that god had met him there he just didn't go in there for no reason at all brother branham said he got around and then he said he looked and he said even look he thought about that water he thought about that thirsting he talked about he thought about outside of that gate of that whale that he would get that fresh water from is that right now we're going to now we go to ii samuel let's go to chapter 23. ii samuel 23 and we'll look over there and we'll start at verse 10 for the sake of time he rose and smoked the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand came uh i'm sorry verse eight verse eight he said these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tacomite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adeno and he's night he lifted up his spirit against the 800 whom he slew at one time he said now now remember these men names they meant something it just wasn't they they just wasn't just a a name on them i think uh let me see hallelujah what i'm talking about it was wisdom it was the wisdom david if these men were sent by god then it has to be something inside of them to protect god's servant still with me his name meant wisdom it says the 809 meant ornament he was a slender mean as a spirit he was as a spirit and eliezer he was god has helped god has sent his help now you just bear with me and be prayerful with me he says now look he hallelujah he says in verse nine he says and after him was eliezer the son of the dodo he said the a hoaxite and one of the and and one thing said dudu three mighty men with david when they defiled the philistines were gathered together to battle and the men of israel were going away he rose and smoked the philistines until his hand was weary and enclaved and the lord wrote a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil he says and after him was shammite the son of aggie the heroite he said in the philistines were gathered together into a a troop where was the piece of ground full of lentils and the and the people fled from the philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord walked a great victory he says and three of the 30 chiefs went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adelum he said now look i think i wrote it down here if god help me hallelujah see what he says to adelum he says hallelujah it was it was a hiding place it was too high it was a justice who was according to justice of other people but it was a hiding place this place was a cave that david went to he said and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of reference he said now look if you look at first chronicles 11 we won't turn it there but you can look at it in first chronicles 11 now three of the city captains went down to the rock to david and to the cave of adelaide and the host of the philistines encamped the valley of referendum hallelujah he says and david was then then and hold in the garrisons of the philistine i'ma drop down a little bit he said david long and said oh that one would give me a drink of water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate now remember david was seeing more it was hot it was during that time probably around april it was harvest time and david knew it was round in harvest time in david's demonstration what he did with that water going to prove that david was looking at more he was seeing that more when david went in that cave when david met their god he knew god would meet him there that was a prayer place for david maybe perhaps they said that the rocks back then was like a made of a limestone you're still with me now you got to put on your spiritual cap saints i'm telling you you got to have that place you got that prayer place where god can meet you and you know god will meet your needs is that right but david had the desire david was meditating on the lord that david was thinking about the goodness of the lord david was thinking about the water that he wasn't wanting to drink but baby was thinking more than just a drink of water look at me saying help me saints pray with me now we closing it out hallelujah verse 17 and he said being far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went into jeopardy well he says now look he said therefore he would not drink it these things did his three mighty men in absence and the brother of joab the son of jeremiah was chief among thee and he lifted up his spirit against the hundred and slewed them and had the name among them but when we look in that saints when david came there you go back and you look at it david came david remember that he remember he saw the anointing he saw the supernatural of god he saw these men that was willing to sacrifice david knew that it was down to time what it was pentecostal time it was jubilee time it was time brother steve i believe david wanted to make a sacrifice i think the heart was crying out he wanted to be there in that worship he remembered what god had brought him out of he remembered what god had brought him through so david what he did he didn't even drink that water i believe david was crying for the presence of the lord i mean david was looking for this presence that's here tonight david wanted to be able to rejoice over the word of god david wanted to be rejoiced because he thought about he remembered how god had brought his people out of egypt from the bondage being burdened down so david remember when he got in that cave david saw it and god met him and baby requested it was one more prophetic request that was made by david and god granted it and he saw the mercy that was extended to him with those men fighting through all of that to just get that drink of water we sacrificed the men of god they sacrificed they sacrificed the word of god i'm just touching on it the lord i have the holy spirit of finish taking that ref from them that's why he stopped this david went down there david went down there a couple times i think it was three times to meet god and when he went down there to meet god and god always met him there david knew he could meet god there david knew he can get his faith built up there praying most much in the holy ghost but we'll do what will increase thy faith great let's bless it be the lord anytime he ever problem remember what the lord have did for

forgot about yourselves i i'm gonna get it at the end so no visitor family member always feel welcome to come in this place and worship together with us amen meditation meditation meditation we already explained to you that meditation is one of the key to the third pull you remember her brother branham was sitting by the tree and keep on meditating meditating actually we need to find some quiet time in the in our day we got so busy you trying to sit quiet and we got that ring on the telephone every time somebody shoots something it goes and it's telling you check it again either it's whatsapp or facebook or the crazy tick talk or whatever that is going on keep blowing your telephone all the time because the devil knows the black dog knows that if you get your mind quiet enough the lord will speak to you amen we are so busy wrapped up thinking about everything you got to do this you got to do this you got to do this by the end of the day you are completely worn out and you just go to sleep no time for the lord sometimes you need to take that telephone and push it aside just sit quiet and think about the lord think about the scripture the bible says in genesis 6 that brother kelly read that the sons of god looked at the daughters of men how can you just look at a woman and go and tomorrow you get in trouble if you look between the line they were pondering on it because james explained to us that we were we are drawn away by our own lust and then when you continue to ponder over and over you get a thought and you keep thinking over over and over you are actually pushing that thought into the subconscious into the soul you are insisting and your soul just get a message that this is what he wants me to do and he suck it down once it's down it will take the grace of god to get you off of it if there is not enough strong prayer automatically sin is conceived when sin is conceived you're gonna go after it you actually manifesting what is already done in your heart so when somebody committed adultery it's not that the sin and the committed adultery no adultery is already committed in the heart fornication is already consumed in the heart amen do you think if abraham was not sure to kill isaac god would have stopped him do you think so if he was pretending because god knows the heart amen god already seen in the heart of abraham that he was determined to kill isaac in other words in the heart of abraham isaac was already gone amen when god saw that god just stopped him from manifesting the faith that was already in his heart if god did not stop him he would have done it but amazing grace came in and provided another lamb in other words i have seen abraham in your heart that you already taken a decision to give to me the best that you got that's enough because once it's conceived there automatically you're going to produce it amen that's why imagination that meditation is very important whatever you meditate all night lord willing on sunday we already seen genesis 6 where the sons of god are meditating they become brother branham say they became women chaser how can you be a child of god and turn suddenly and be and become a woman chaser brother branham explained to us that when you continue to think about something when you think about it you talk about it you think about it but i'm saying automatically you're gonna fall into that category and become what you talk about it and think about it so somehow they were meditating pondering pondering and automatically they begin to live the life and lord's willing on sunday you're going to see how a sister a child of god can get in trouble by meditating meditating what you're going to see in a scripture that's why brother branham continue to warn about the love story i love susie because you poking something in your head and you are pondering you are pondering you are pondering before you know it instead of looking at a young man that is dressed well that is responsible you begin to look at the young men that have six-pack amen that six-pack didn't come from the world that six-pack came from the movie watching that six-pack came from the kind of man you expose your mind all the time and that imprint is printed into your heart and when they say you want to get married you are looking at the man that is matching that image that's why the holy ghost have to come and destroy that image and change the heart kill that nature to show you that this is not the right kind of woman this is not the right kind of husband this is not what you needed this looks good on the inside it's going to be trouble for your life the power of meditating spend some time with the lord take some quiet time just sit quiet and think of a scripture you want to see what god is going to do i do it most of the time i just sit my wife knows it i like to be quiet when i sit quiet quiet and i begin to think on the scripture before you know it remember brother branham say this remember brother brother i'm saying this remember this scripture remember this scripture all i do is just grab a pen and i begin to write it when i give it to you you say where is he seeing that the power is on meditation but if your mind is trouble on the telephone wasting your time the lord is just look at you you're busy they look at you you're busy you are busy in the battleground amen let's stand hallelujah amen we are going through a different channel it seems like it's fire but it's just a cleansing fire amen praise the name of the lord there is a key we already explained to you on sunday why god comes around 12 years 14 because god knows and the lord dropping to me that daniel was around that same time when he went to babylon i took the quarter open and he was right there brother what i'm saying he was around 12 and 14 years when he was taken to babylon why is he matching everything teenager teenager it's just the grace of god the holy spirit to want to fight the battle for you all you have to do is just surrender just give him his place let go and let god have his own way and he's going to fight the battle but if you don't want to listen you want to fight it in yourself you're going to have scar he's going to let you go go you drink water until you completely drawn when you're tired then he just pick you up and pull you out of the water amen but if you let him fight your battle you just take the stem for the word of god like shadrach meshach abednego they were a teenager they just stood for what they know was right they didn't have a vision they didn't see any angel but because they stood for the word of god that they were taught amen when they were going through the fire god stepped in the fire amen god never took the fire away you follow me god only step in the fire and remove the heat from the fire and let go and let them go through that experience without any scar without any smell without any burning wound anything they came out right so going through teenager brother branham say it's a dangerous age we read it to you on sunday so it's a fire age that you're going through but if you're going through just take the word and stand on the word then that fourth man will step in for you and help you through that process of teenager and he's going to carry you when people will be telling you i got trouble in a teenage you don't even know how to explain you say i never went through this because the fourth man was in the fire with you you were growing into the same experience just like any kind of young man any kind of young woman but yours is different yours doesn't burn yours doesn't choke you because the fourth man is in the fire amen once the black dog is released even though the the the bound shot uh uh shadrach meshach abednego what the fourth man did he just permitted that fire to burn the bounds just remove it and free them and they were going into the fire how can you be in the midst of fire and you walking and you're praising the lord if you have the fourth man amen young people bring that fourth man into your life he's gonna take you in that fire age of teenager and he's gonna help you cross that teenager age without any problem because he's the one that's gonna control the fire he's gonna control the black dog he's gonna control the passion he's gonna control everything and you're gonna cross teenager and keep your virginity you're gonna go across teenager and keep your innocency without going to trouble but if you don't invite him you keep being stubborn you don't want to listen amen you're gonna pass that age and be burned just like anybody brother kelly spoke tonight he said that we have our testimony and our testimony was that we were there we did things that were wrong and we repented but you might have a greater testimony where you don't have to go through those things but you can testify that when i went through this age the fourth man was with me when i went through menopause the fourth man was with me when i was in college the fourth man was with me when i was going through trial the fourth man was with me and you can stand as a testimony that no matter how many young people in the message did this did that i can testify i can enter into my marriage with a victorious testimony because the fourth man came in rescue for you and he did it brother branham said they pray all night before going through that temptation stand for the message that you know stand from what we preach for you stand for the word of god just take a decision you say god just like shadrach just like meshach just like abednego just like daniel i'm not gonna defile my body i'm not gonna do what is wrong i'm not gonna play with girls i'm not gonna play with boys i'm just taking a decision brother run and preach the time of decision just take that decision stand on that decision say i'm not gonna defile my body brother when i'm saying virginity is a virtue i'm gonna keep it i'm gonna keep myself there if you stand on that ground the fourth man will come for you amen and he's gonna take the heat off of the battle even though you're crossing difficult time god will help you cross because there is a promise that when you go through fire will happen it will not burn you when you go through the waters what happened it's not going to do anything for you because you pick the fourth man into your life amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace father for your love and for your mercy lord it has been a couple days that you spoke to me about the fourth man in the fire lord to help the teenager understand even the adult to understand lord that it takes you to help us cross through the normal difficult time in our life whether it's a teenager whether it's a menopause whether it's whatever temptation we're going through if we can just open the door stand for what is truth lord father you will not leave us because you gave us a promise that you will never forsake us lord father you always a god that is on time you the present help in the time of trouble father and you prove it for shadrach you prove it from misha you prove it from abe nego lord father you even prove it for daniel lord when he stood for what was right lord even in the lion's den father the pearl of fire stepped there lord and shut the mouth of the lion father you can shut the mouth of the lion lord if lord father you shut the mouth of a lion that is even more powerful than a dog lord how much more lord father is the power in the holy spirit lord to shut the mouth of the black dog father man you shouted for this congregation may you shouted for our young people all may you shouted for our young girls lord may you shouted for our young couples lord father fight this by the lord because you're the one lord father that call us to this cause and you say lord father that you will never leave us not forsake us lord you're gonna go with us all the way along to the finishing line lord may you help your children surrender surrender lord spend their time thinking about you meditating upon the word of god father strengthen your servant that you use tonight lord father i rebuke every spirit of selfishness every spirit of stubbornness every spirit lord father of unbelief that is trying to better the mind of your children lord to block them lord from receiving their deliverance lord father you spoke in your word that when you sent your word you sent your word to heal your people all name nobody in this church lord miss this time of deliverance miss this time of visitation miss this time of to be lost lord father where the shackle of the devil can be completely taken off our life father we thank you for everything lord we are committing them tonight
