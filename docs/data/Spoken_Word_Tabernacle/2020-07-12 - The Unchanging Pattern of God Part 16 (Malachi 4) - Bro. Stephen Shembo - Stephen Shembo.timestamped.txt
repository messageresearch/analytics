[28:14] leather
[28:14] father to you that's in us and if you be

[42:52] please be connected on Wednesday
[42:55] especially on people we need to unfold
[42:59] that and show you where is the portion
[43:02] of John the Baptist in Malachi 4 because

[43:20] servant Moses in Horeb you already know
[43:23] what it means but there is a portion
[43:25] there for John the Baptist that says
[43:27] that he shall return the heart of the
[43:29] father to the children and the people
[43:32] got really mixed up there because

[43:39] Baptist right there then laws willing on

[51:00] word rub wound it in line and cloves
[51:03] with the spices everybody see as the
[51:07] manner of the Jews is to bury let's go
[51:11] back to the Song of Solomon now chapter
[51:14] father so
[51:16] Solomon is coming when he's coming to
[51:19] his wife when he's coming to this woman
[51:23] this woman is a virgin and Solomon is
[51:27] anointed with myrrh and spice
[51:33] he's coming as a sacrifice
[51:36] everybody clear now he's anointed with
[51:40] myrrh and spice they say I have gathered
[51:43] my myrrh and with my spouse in other
[51:47] word they caught the office he's
[51:49] approaching this woman that office is
[51:53] connected to the heat to his death that
[51:58] office is connected to his death as a
[52:01] sacrifice
[52:04] are they okay
[52:07] I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[52:13] so not only is this sacrifice Solomon
[52:17] presenting with himself with myrrh and
[52:19] spice but Solomon have honey and if you
[52:25] go read some 19 dev he told us that
[52:28] there is a honey that comes from the
[52:31] rock are there so there is a revelation
[52:35] that is producing honey Salamone is
[52:40] coming with the sacrifice and he is also
[52:43] coming with a revelation that have honey
[52:48] because in the book of Revelation
[52:50] chapter 10 when John ate the book in the

[53:02] sacrifice connected to a revelation

[53:14] honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my
[53:17] wine and whatever Adam told us that one

[53:26] Hani's coming with a liner there is a
[53:30] revelation that is unfold that Solomon
[53:33] is bringing who's Solomon
[53:37] I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[53:41] I have drunk my wine with my milk we
[53:50] know that Paul spoke about the milk of
[53:53] the gospel to give to the baby so this
[53:58] package is full he have the supreme
[54:02] sacrifice he have the revelation of the
[54:06] world and he also have the milk so it's
[54:10] going to take care of the little

[54:53] happened to this woman were words the
[54:56] woman it is the voice of my beloved ah

[55:21] very clear praise the lord saying open
[55:27] to me my sister my love my dove you

[55:34] Pleiades with seven doll so we clear
[55:39] my head is filled with that we do so
[55:44] that means it's in the night and my
[55:49] love's with the job of the night
[55:52] remember when the foolish virgin and the
[55:55] wise virgin were sleeping they cried the
[55:58] midnight cry came and night and midnight
[56:03] are we there trace the Lord verse three
[56:08] this is the woman talking I have put up
[56:11] my coat if you look in another
[56:14] translation it's the robe the government
[56:17] of the woman so this woman is inside her
[56:20] home the husband came anointed with the
[56:25] sacrifice he have honey
[56:27] he has milk he have wine with a
[56:30] revelation and everything when he's
[56:32] knocking at the door the woman is on the

[57:08] be found him another way to go open the
[57:10] door to the husband she doesn't wanna
[57:13] bear that sacrifice she's more concerned
[57:16] about her feet staying clean versus
[57:20] going to open her own husband who's
[57:26] knocking at the door verse 4 my beloved
[57:30] put in his hand by the hole of the door
[57:34] now brother branham keep telling us that
[57:37] this door the light shed is not on the
[57:40] outside
[57:41] where did brother branham see that did
[57:44] he give you a court
[57:45] did he give you Scripture no but right
[57:49] here we found out that the door of this
[57:51] woman have a little hole and the husband
[57:56] was outside knocking knocking knocking
[57:58] knocking and finally because the woman
[58:01] doesn't want to open the door their
[58:03] husband put the hand inside the hole of
[58:07] the door to access the light shed that
[58:11] is on the Assad so this door only opens
[58:13] from the inside not the outside
[58:19] everybody clear now my beloved put in
[58:23] his hand by the hole of the door my
[58:26] Bower will move for him she begin to
[58:29] fill her heart moving I rose up to open
[58:35] to my beloved and my hand job with me
[58:40] and my finger with sweet-smelling meal
[58:44] upon the handle of the look so because
[58:49] of there the husband insisted insisted
[58:54] insisted and the woman was not opening
[58:58] he took his hand and he put it in the
[59:01] hole and he accessed the latch and he
[59:04] anointed that door that latch of the
[59:08] door with myrrh
[59:13] what does marry means after knocking
[59:17] knocking daunting you don't open the
[59:21] latch at of your door will be anointed
[59:23] with Mary let's go verse 6 I opened my
[59:30] beloved but my beloved has withdrawn
[59:33] himself too late you see that Laodicea
[59:39] too late mmm and was gone my soul fed
[59:45] when he spoke he will so sweet I heard
[59:49] this sermon I sought him but I could not
[59:53] find him
[59:55] I called him but he gave me no answer
[59:57] the time of mercy was cut off that's why
[1:00:02] they anointed her latch it with mer mer
[1:00:06] struck the husband first and the husband
[1:00:10] was dead but because she's that the
[1:00:13] husband is insisting insisting and the
[1:00:15] woman don't open that anointing move not
[1:00:19] the husband but he went and took the
[1:00:22] handle of the door and put death gone
[1:00:28] verse 7 the watchman if you notice this
[1:00:34] watchman our guard there soldier
[1:00:36] the watchman that went about the city
[1:00:39] found me they smote me either
[1:00:44] she is thrown into the Tribulation
[1:00:47] Period because brother branham said in
[1:00:52] the book of Revelation there is a dragon
[1:00:54] that was after a woman and when that
[1:00:57] woman took a flight by the eagle wings
[1:01:00] either the message of the great eagle
[1:01:04] took the woman out then the dragon was
[1:01:07] wroth against the remnant of the woman
[1:01:11] which is the foolish virgin and the
[1:01:15] Bible said the dragon spurred water and
[1:01:17] what venom say water means a multitude
[1:01:20] of the people which was showing the
[1:01:23] armies that's going to be spurred to go
[1:01:26] and abuse the foolish virgin that
[1:01:29] rejected the call of the husband
[1:01:32] everybody clear now now she said that I
[1:01:35] open verse 7 the watchman that went
[1:01:38] about the city found me they smote me
[1:01:41] they wounded me she's under persecution
[1:01:43] now the keepers of the world took away
[1:01:46] my veil from me she is throwing down
[1:01:50] into the darkness where there is crying
[1:01:52] and gnashing of teeth because their
[1:01:55] husband took off let's go to Hebrews
[1:01:58] chapter 4
[1:02:08] and the people think the Bible is not in
[1:02:12] inspired book they don't know what it
[1:02:13] took in about Hebrew chapter 4 verse 1
[1:02:18] if you dare you can say Amen let us
[1:02:22] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:02:25] us of entering into his arrest are there
[1:02:31] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:02:35] it for to us was the gospel preached as
[1:02:40] well as to them but the word preached
[1:02:45] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:02:48] faith in them that heard it the gospel
[1:02:52] preached to them but yet it didn't
[1:02:55] profit them everybody clear
[1:02:57] verse 6 seeing therefore it remained
[1:03:02] that some must enter in and there whom
[1:03:06] it was first preached entered not
[1:03:07] because of unbelief again he limits a
[1:03:11] certain day he gave another opportunity
[1:03:14] after a certain day saying in David
[1:03:18] today after so long a time as it is said
[1:03:23] today if you will hear his voice the
[1:03:27] husband is knocking if you will hear his
[1:03:30] voice harden not your heart like that
[1:03:34] woman
[1:03:35] are we there for if Jesus has given them
[1:03:39] rest then would he not afterward have
[1:03:42] spoken of another day there remain there
[1:03:45] remains therefore arrest for the people
[1:03:48] of God the rest is the Holy Ghost for he
[1:03:52] that is entered into his rest is also is
[1:03:55] now he also has seized from his own work
[1:03:59] as God did from his let us labor
[1:04:03] therefore to enter into the rest lest
[1:04:06] any man fall after the same example of
[1:04:10] unbelief last scripture revelation
[1:04:13] chapter 3 verse 20 when you hear is
[1:04:17] the husband is knocking open quickly you
[1:04:22] take too long they latch it yourself
[1:04:25] will the door of the heart will be
[1:04:28] seared everybody there Revelation
[1:04:32] chapter 3 verse 20 everybody there be
[1:04:38] all that standard there remember Solomon
[1:04:43] was way at the door behold I stand at
[1:04:47] the door and knock lo lo Salomon doing
[1:04:51] knocking do you see clear now we
[1:04:55] understand at the door and knock If any
[1:04:58] man hear my verse you see the Song of
[1:05:02] Solomon hear my voice
[1:05:05] and opened the the woman opened the door
[1:05:09] to late and open the door I will come in
[1:05:14] remember the husband was coming in
[1:05:16] either I will come in to him and will
[1:05:21] sup with him and he with me so in the
[1:05:26] age of law Asia there will be a coming
[1:05:30] of Christ an opportunity being given to
[1:05:35] the church to open the door so that
[1:05:38] Christ can come in and sup with you but
[1:05:43] if you take too long you going to be
[1:05:46] anointed with myrrh
[1:05:48] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:05:53] you for your grace your love your mercy
[1:05:55] and for everything you're doing for us
[1:05:57] father let this scenario that we just
[1:06:01] read be not imputed to this congregation
[1:06:05] father but let each one of this
[1:06:08] congregation whether they are here or on
[1:06:10] the stream or they will be watching
[1:06:13] later may they open the door to the
[1:06:16] crust that has been kicked out by
[1:06:18] denomination but who's trying to gain
[1:06:21] back insurance into the heart of
[1:06:24] individual own father we commit this
[1:06:26] service unto the handle may the Holy
[1:06:29] Spirit Lord made
[1:06:30] inside the teacher maybe you come and
[1:06:33] Lord father unfold your word to your
[1:06:35] children bring their power download and
[1:06:38] fill these Temple Lord as we are
[1:06:41] gathered here together we seal every
[1:06:44] work of the devil away from this place
[1:06:47] may you be the Alpha and the Omega Lord
[1:06:49] as we commit everything unto the hand in
[1:06:52] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:55] take your Bible to the book of Mark
[1:06:57] chapter 1 we are going with the
[1:07:00] unchanging part of God we are part 16
[1:07:04] like we said we are laying a foundation
[1:07:06] we don't want you to get any trouble
[1:07:08] with the Ministry of the centum again on
[1:07:12] Wednesday when we open Wednesday we
[1:07:15] started with John the Baptist and we
[1:07:18] identify John the Baptist to be as they
[1:07:21] are 40 and then Malachi 3 but there was
[1:07:26] an event that happened in the house in
[1:07:29] the ministry of John the Baptist and
[1:07:31] according to that event the Lord which
[1:07:34] was the Spirit of the Lord for those who
[1:07:36] followed on Wednesday the Lord which was
[1:07:40] the Spirit of the Lord came into his
[1:07:43] temple and we proved to you clearly on
[1:07:46] Wednesday that that temple was not the
[1:07:48] tabernacle because the tabernacle was
[1:07:51] already anointed by Moses he was not the
[1:07:53] Temple of Solomon
[1:07:54] because the Temple of Solomon was
[1:07:56] already anointed but God was looking for
[1:07:59] a place of rest
[1:08:01] that's why Hebrews talking about a rest
[1:08:04] and finally God brought us a temple
[1:08:07] which we look in the scripture and we
[1:08:09] found that that temple was speaking
[1:08:11] about the body of Jesus Christ and the
[1:08:14] pillar of fire in the form of the dog
[1:08:16] enter that body
[1:08:18] because according to Isaiah 40 the Lord
[1:08:21] will come and enter suddenly into his
[1:08:24] temple and that happened in the river of
[1:08:27] Jordan now as we dig deeper into John
[1:08:31] the Baptist because on Wednesday Lord
[1:08:34] willing we will show you that John the
[1:08:36] Baptist has question and answer we will
[1:08:39] see that in the scripture are there
[1:08:42] go to the book of Mark chapter 1 if you
[1:08:46] dare you can say Amen the Bible say the
[1:08:49] beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:08:51] the Son of God we prove to you on my own
[1:08:53] Wednesday that mark took Isaiah 40 and
[1:08:56] Malachi 4 and put them together okay now
[1:08:59] as it is written in the prophet behold I
[1:09:02] will send my messenger before your face
[1:09:04] which shall prepare your way before you
[1:09:07] we talked about this on Wednesday the
[1:09:09] voice of one crying into the wilderness
[1:09:12] prepare you the way of the Lord make his
[1:09:14] paths straight so we see those two
[1:09:16] Scripture were talking about one person
[1:09:19] verse 4 John did baptize in the
[1:09:23] wilderness and preached the baptism of
[1:09:27] lament of repentance for the remission
[1:09:29] of sin so the message of Jonah not only
[1:09:34] was there a message to prepare the way
[1:09:36] of the Lord and then to introduce crust
[1:09:39] and to point the Lord Jesus Christ John
[1:09:42] had a message of repentance
[1:09:46] everybody here and John have every a
[1:09:50] message of water baptism but something
[1:09:56] strange in the scripture says that the
[1:09:59] repentance here was the repentance for
[1:10:02] remission of sin now brother Branham
[1:10:07] says that if you look at the scripture
[1:10:11] superficially you're going to come up
[1:10:13] with a superficial understanding if you
[1:10:17] look at this water baptism it looks like
[1:10:20] when somebody was baptized under John
[1:10:23] their sin was already remitted if it's
[1:10:28] so when Paul came in up to chapter 19 he
[1:10:33] should not have we baptized people again
[1:10:38] if it's oh if you go by this scripture
[1:10:42] right there and say repentance of a
[1:10:44] remission of sin you want to get in
[1:10:46] trouble
[1:10:47] John had two ways in his ministry or
[1:10:51] John had the way that
[1:10:52] to fulfill something straight ahead and
[1:10:55] the second part of John he was only
[1:10:59] pointing to something that will come are
[1:11:03] you there so not everything that John
[1:11:06] spoke happened in his ministry some of
[1:11:10] them happen but other he was just
[1:11:13] pointing you to something that is gonna
[1:11:16] follow his ministry everybody clear
[1:11:19] okay verse four John did baptize in the
[1:11:22] wilderness and preach the repentance of
[1:11:25] sin for the remission of what the
[1:11:27] baptism of repentance for the remission
[1:11:29] of sin and there went out to him or the
[1:11:33] land of Judea and day of Jerusalem and
[1:11:36] we're all baptized does his message of
[1:11:39] him in the River Jordan confessing their
[1:11:42] sin why there they were there confessing
[1:11:45] their sins because there was a message
[1:11:47] of repentance everybody clear
[1:11:50] okay now verse seven and preach let me
[1:11:55] drop to verse seven and preach saying
[1:11:58] dare come one mightier than I after me
[1:12:02] now John is not fulfilling this but now
[1:12:05] he is pointing are you there
[1:12:08] they come one after me their large set
[1:12:11] of whose shoes we already explained why
[1:12:13] he didn't touch the largest that's why
[1:12:15] he didn't have the supernatural okay the
[1:12:19] large set of whose shoes I am not worthy
[1:12:21] to stoop down and I lose I indeed
[1:12:24] baptize you with what water that was his
[1:12:28] message everybody clear I indeed baptize
[1:12:31] you with water but his shop is a future
[1:12:35] he's pointing he shall baptize you with
[1:12:37] the Holy Ghost so the message of John
[1:12:41] contain repentance but the repentance
[1:12:46] was only pointing into the religion of
[1:12:50] sin I'm gonna go slowly his message on
[1:12:53] also contain water baptism and his
[1:12:57] message also contained the baptism of
[1:13:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:04] everybody clear but this baptism but
[1:13:09] John was not the one to do it but John
[1:13:13] was only planting to somebody
[1:13:16] everybody clear so far so we have three
[1:13:19] element who are here
[1:13:21] in the message of John repent be
[1:13:25] baptized and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:28] I believe you begin to see clear
[1:13:31] everybody there we have word about this
[1:13:34] we have repentance and we have the Holy
[1:13:37] Ghost John can baptize you but not for a
[1:13:42] lesion of sin you can repent after John
[1:13:46] no problem but the Holy Ghost no he was
[1:13:50] just pointing the people into him let's
[1:13:53] go to John chapter 1 lord help me manage
[1:13:59] the time I want this to sink clearly
[1:14:04] John chapter 1 verse 33 if you dare you
[1:14:07] can say Amen now I know him not but he
[1:14:12] does sent me to baptize so John did not
[1:14:17] come with water baptism just like that
[1:14:19] it was a message that God gave to him to
[1:14:23] do it you now understand okay he does
[1:14:28] send me to baptize with water so what
[1:14:31] John was doing was a commandment of God
[1:14:37] baptized with water the same said to me
[1:14:41] upon whom you shall see the spirit
[1:14:44] descending which plane this and remain
[1:14:46] on him the same is he which baptizeth
[1:14:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:14:51] so the message came God gave John a
[1:14:55] message and the message they gave John
[1:14:58] all you need to take the people and
[1:15:00] baptize them why do we need to baptize
[1:15:04] the people there is something in the Old
[1:15:09] Testament that is called eleven are
[1:15:12] there so when the sinner was coming and
[1:15:16] approaching go
[1:15:17] into the tabernacle on the outside there
[1:15:20] was something that was delivered the I
[1:15:22] had water so what happened is you bring
[1:15:25] your Lambo and your lab have to be
[1:15:27] washed first
[1:15:29] are you there before you kill dilemma
[1:15:33] everybody clear so when John was
[1:15:36] baptizing the people the land was not
[1:15:40] dead yet go back to John chapter 1 where
[1:15:43] idea where we are go back on verse 29
[1:15:48] the Bible say the next day John sees
[1:15:51] Jesus coming to him and say behold the
[1:15:55] lamb of God which the scene of them was
[1:16:00] Jesus crucified that's why the baptism
[1:16:04] of John only pointed but Qunari meat sin
[1:16:09] but the lamb must be first wash and the
[1:16:17] one who was washing the lamb was livid
[1:16:22] do you know that John the Baptist was a
[1:16:24] Levite are there so God took from the
[1:16:30] language the lineage of a lever and pull
[1:16:34] John the Baptist out of the Levitical
[1:16:37] priesthood and send him into a different
[1:16:40] way because one Levite must be there to
[1:16:44] baptize or to wash their Lamb of God the
[1:16:52] believer positioning cross
[1:16:54] what did he speak of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:57] Christ let me drop down here to save
[1:17:00] time God coming to his temple to be
[1:17:03] worshipped from that temple talking
[1:17:05] about the Temple of Solomon where the
[1:17:08] blood outside made in a tournament then
[1:17:10] when Jesus came on earth when he was
[1:17:13] baptized in Jordan as the washing you
[1:17:18] see brother branham ha scriptural he's
[1:17:20] as the washing of the lamp at the
[1:17:23] present level are you there notice then
[1:17:27] John bear
[1:17:28] where could seeing the spirit of god
[1:17:30] like a dog coming from above and settle
[1:17:33] on him he went into him God coming to
[1:17:36] his temple but a Branham help us more
[1:17:39] often Tom I have wondered why that that
[1:17:44] Jesus of Nazareth and many times it's
[1:17:47] been asking me why would a man like
[1:17:49] Jesus have to be baptized are you there
[1:17:54] because the people that were baptized
[1:17:56] have to confess their sin but Jesus did
[1:18:00] not seem everybody why would this person
[1:18:06] be baptized has it not of repentance and
[1:18:09] of confession when he was the Holy
[1:18:13] spotless and adulterated son of the
[1:18:17] Living God why would this person have to
[1:18:20] be baptized like a man coming Baptist
[1:18:24] fees after confession he had no
[1:18:26] confession to make
[1:18:27] because he was God and why would he have
[1:18:31] to be baptized like head unto repentance
[1:18:34] because he needed no repentance for he
[1:18:37] was the infallible God brother Branham
[1:18:39] is asking a question why the
[1:18:43] identification brother Branham say
[1:18:45] suffered that to be this is John to
[1:18:48] occupy Jesus for that he become to us
[1:18:50] that we fulfill all righteousness
[1:18:53] why then John being a prophet and him
[1:18:59] being the world know that he was the
[1:19:02] sacrifice John understood that that's
[1:19:05] why he said behold the lamb of God
[1:19:08] everybody clear knew that he was the
[1:19:11] sacrifice so the sacrifice has to be
[1:19:14] washed over here before it is presented
[1:19:21] so he baptized Jesus washing the word
[1:19:25] before he was presented you see now so
[1:19:29] everything was
[1:19:30] under the scripture but they say
[1:19:32] remission of sin now we just read here
[1:19:37] in John chapter one the Bible says that
[1:19:40] the land away that take away sin so what
[1:19:44] does remit mean remission what does he
[1:19:48] mean brother Branham every person from
[1:19:52] that day on was baptized in the name of
[1:19:54] Jesus Christ and they found some of that
[1:19:57] Baptist in no name at all
[1:20:00] so when John was baptizing people
[1:20:03] John just baptize them but there was no
[1:20:07] name attached to the baptism of John so
[1:20:11] the baptism of John was a baptism that
[1:20:14] didn't have any name because John
[1:20:18] himself said that I knew him not are you
[1:20:22] there and brother Branham say that and
[1:20:25] they found some that was baptized in no
[1:20:28] name at all and the original greek says
[1:20:31] right here and both the hebrew that the
[1:20:34] baptism in the name of jesus is the
[1:20:37] forgiveness of sin both Greek and Hebrew
[1:20:40] Ram it means to forgive of course if I
[1:20:46] remit anything is to take it away to
[1:20:50] remit to take it away behold the lamb of
[1:20:53] God that take away are you there that's
[1:20:58] why the baptism of John was only unto
[1:21:00] repentance take away let's go to up to
[1:21:08] chapter 19
[1:21:13] if you go to the scripture they say for
[1:21:16] the remission of sin for the remission
[1:21:18] of sin when Paul came o Lord l prophet
[1:21:22] and a prophet usually comes and would be
[1:21:26] higher are you there now Paul in after
[1:21:30] 19 here he found the people that were
[1:21:32] baptized and Paul said to them in verse
[1:21:34] 2 he say unto them have you received the
[1:21:37] Holy Ghost since you believe and they
[1:21:39] say unto Him we have not so much of her
[1:21:42] as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost
[1:21:45] do you know that when John was preaching
[1:21:47] he was telling them that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:49] will come why they didn't hear that
[1:21:54] why didn't hear that
[1:21:56] yet they were baptized unto John but
[1:22:01] they miss the part of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:04] coming
[1:22:05] be careful church are you there verse 3
[1:22:09] and he said to them - what then were you
[1:22:13] baptized and they said to John baptism
[1:22:16] and John was already talking about the
[1:22:19] coming Holy Ghost are you then verse 4
[1:22:24] then paul said john verily baptized with
[1:22:28] the baptism of repentance for a mission
[1:22:32] of sealing did you see Paul saying that
[1:22:37] so when Paul speak about the baptism of
[1:22:40] John Paul removes remission of sin are
[1:22:45] there because Paul understood that the
[1:22:48] Baptist was not removing sin because the
[1:22:52] lab was not crucified Paul did not
[1:22:56] contradict mark mark was telling you
[1:23:00] that Oh John was only pointing but Paul
[1:23:04] as a prophet must clarify things he said
[1:23:07] when we talk about John take away
[1:23:10] remission of sin he doesn't belong to
[1:23:12] him he belongs to the Lamba are you dead
[1:23:17] okay brother brother he said Paul met
[1:23:23] some that already had been baptized and
[1:23:24] they were shouting heads
[1:23:26] turi he says unto what were you baptized
[1:23:30] they say unto John he said John baptized
[1:23:33] unto repented he doesn't bet remission
[1:23:36] of sin now get it aren't you
[1:23:39] repentant not for remission of sin well
[1:23:42] did brother Branham learn that how many
[1:23:48] understand that not for remission of sin
[1:23:51] the blood one oblivious Christian year
[1:23:55] be careful they were baptized alright
[1:23:58] unto repentance they were replanted yes
[1:24:03] yes sir I have repented I believe he's
[1:24:05] coming they were baptized unto
[1:24:07] repentance
[1:24:08] that is to say believing pushing
[1:24:11] pointing them on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:13] because if the baptism of John was for
[1:24:17] the remission of sin the Old Testament
[1:24:20] sense should have come out but all of
[1:24:24] them were under the old sacrifice in
[1:24:26] Paradise not in heaven because their sin
[1:24:30] were only covered but they were not
[1:24:33] removed it takes Jesus Christ to remove
[1:24:37] the seed of the world are we clear
[1:24:42] he says here that then when they heard
[1:24:46] this that the sec the sacrifice already
[1:24:50] come now they knew that Jesus already
[1:24:53] came and died they were baptized over
[1:24:56] again in the name of Jesus
[1:25:01] are we clear now here he says John only
[1:25:05] baptized unto repentance just as much
[1:25:08] water as you could get them under in
[1:25:12] other words just get them put them on
[1:25:14] the order out that's it
[1:25:16] under which name we don't know are we
[1:25:20] there now unto repentance not for
[1:25:24] remission of sin because the sacrifice
[1:25:27] was not here yet so when we talked about
[1:25:31] this
[1:25:33] the Ministry of John Donne name is sweet
[1:25:36] speak about these three elements let's
[1:25:38] go now to John chapter 7 so we clarified
[1:25:42] the scripture click quickly and then we
[1:25:45] take off non chapter 7 don't get tired
[1:25:51] we need this if you think this is too
[1:25:56] much if they shut you down with Quran
[1:25:58] again you will be appreciated in church
[1:26:01] time John chapter 7 verse 38 are you
[1:26:07] there
[1:26:07] Quran I showed you that they can shut
[1:26:10] you down and everything is worthless
[1:26:12] your car worthless your clothes where
[1:26:14] your hands were free you can go no way
[1:26:18] John chapter 7 verse 38 he that believes
[1:26:22] on me as the scripture have said out of
[1:26:26] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:26:28] water this is Jesus speaking but this
[1:26:32] spoke he of the Spirit which they that
[1:26:36] believe on him should receive for the
[1:26:39] Holy Ghost was not yet been given was
[1:26:43] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[1:26:46] yet Jesus have to die resurrect be
[1:26:50] glorified then he opened the door
[1:26:53] further so even though John his message
[1:26:57] has the three element that we found in
[1:27:01] up to 38 but John lack the remission of
[1:27:05] sin and John Rock deliver but on the day
[1:27:09] of Pentecost when Peter comes Peter puts
[1:27:12] the prescription properly he say repent
[1:27:15] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:19] Jesus Christ let's go to acts 2:38 it's
[1:27:28] got to act 2:38 if you dare you can say
[1:27:33] Amen
[1:27:35] everybody they don't go by your memory
[1:27:37] please look in the book are you there
[1:27:41] at 2:38 then Peter said to them do what
[1:27:45] we planned
[1:27:46] everybody clear number two and be
[1:27:50] baptized every one of you not only
[1:27:53] Baptist but in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:56] what for the remission of why because
[1:28:03] that's the name that take away the seed
[1:28:06] of the world you see that the formula
[1:28:12] when you do that you shall receive the
[1:28:15] gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] that's why brother Branham called that a
[1:28:23] prescription and when the happen if you
[1:28:27] notice God enter into Christ in the
[1:28:34] rising of the Sun he went there with you
[1:28:37] in see God has never separated the blood
[1:28:42] from the brilliant the pillar of fire
[1:28:50] was not only for Moses it was for all
[1:28:55] Israel the pillar of fire wasn't long
[1:28:58] before brother Branham he was further
[1:29:01] bride what happened to Jesus Christ was
[1:29:04] not only for Jesus Christ he was further
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:12] so when God looked down upon the body of
[1:29:16] Christ he saw both man and fever when
[1:29:23] God created Adam Adam or both man and
[1:29:28] and Jesus is called the second they are
[1:29:38] one same same word the same word spoke
[1:29:43] of the groom speak of the
[1:29:47] so if the Lord enter into the body of
[1:29:51] Jesus Plus suddenly the Lord must also
[1:29:55] enter into your body suddenly why
[1:30:05] brother Branham say that God has a
[1:30:07] three-fold purpose he says first to
[1:30:10] express himself completely God in Christ
[1:30:14] second to help preeminence by this in
[1:30:19] his church which is his body the blood
[1:30:22] till he could have the preeminence to
[1:30:24] express himself through death and turn
[1:30:27] to restore the kingdom in the Millennium
[1:30:30] why because Adam fell - to live a
[1:30:34] thousand years but Christ that's why in
[1:30:37] the third coming Jesus Christ will come
[1:30:39] with his brother brother Branham the
[1:30:47] works that I do shall you do also and in
[1:30:53] the last day the last day it shall come
[1:30:56] to pass
[1:30:59] behold our same to you why are we
[1:31:05] sending Elijah Elijah the prophet he
[1:31:09] shall turn the heart of the children
[1:31:11] back to the faith of the father what
[1:31:14] does that mean in the in the Ministry of
[1:31:20] Elijah they will be a term come forth
[1:31:24] when he could express himself in the
[1:31:27] fullness of his Godhead did through his
[1:31:32] church either so when they are sending
[1:31:37] the message when the husband is coming
[1:31:40] to his garden he is coming to aunt Arina
[1:31:47] have the preeminence in the church oh my
[1:31:51] what the anointed man that was Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ now they are known
[1:31:57] people are we clear
[1:32:01] all right to bring the anointed bride
[1:32:05] the groom anointed by why accepting what
[1:32:10] is turned on and Adam coming back with
[1:32:14] the anointed world because he said my
[1:32:16] word is spirit they are not anointed
[1:32:19] with the world very Bradham the first
[1:32:25] year God promised that he will send us a
[1:32:28] true prophet after sure we fair message
[1:32:35] who returned the original Word of God
[1:32:38] they fell first the father what is the
[1:32:41] faith of the father the faith of the
[1:32:47] father to bring down the power of the
[1:32:51] Holy Ghost among the people we clear
[1:32:56] with a power that will ways help both
[1:32:59] these things and let her in at the same
[1:33:02] time yes same world being vindicated of
[1:33:06] Jesus Christ and he is the same
[1:33:08] yesterday today and forever now in the
[1:33:12] proof of his resurrection brother
[1:33:13] Branham say that the father that sent me
[1:33:16] is with me oh my
[1:33:18] what declaration what a world the father
[1:33:21] that sent me come with me listen as the
[1:33:26] father sent me so do I send you so Jesus
[1:33:31] say the same way God sent me that's the
[1:33:35] same way I am also sending you what does
[1:33:39] he mean brother branham Alleluia
[1:33:43] he don't only send you but he goes with
[1:33:47] you we clear I will be with you even in
[1:33:53] you unto the end of the world all that
[1:33:58] was in God was pour in and all that was
[1:34:02] in class was emptied and to the believer
[1:34:05] the church
[1:34:12] notice here another thing I like to say
[1:34:15] right here Jesus say as the father has
[1:34:19] sent me now watch as the father has sent
[1:34:23] me so say my you how did the father send
[1:34:29] him brother the Father God sent him come
[1:34:38] down from heaven and dwell in him we
[1:34:43] clear now now he said I always do that
[1:34:49] which is pleases my father see he went
[1:34:52] about doing the things of the Father
[1:34:54] that's the father was showing him to do
[1:34:56] I do nothing except my father shows me
[1:34:59] first day God that sent him was on the
[1:35:04] inside of him we're going clearly now as
[1:35:09] the father sent me the same way the
[1:35:12] father sent me so I send you
[1:35:15] what is it God in you carrying on the
[1:35:19] same work as the father sent me so I
[1:35:24] send you the father descend the son went
[1:35:27] with the son and was in the Sun the
[1:35:33] Jesus descends a man goes with him and
[1:35:37] is in him to perform the same work so if
[1:35:43] God came here into his temple is Jesus
[1:35:49] the only temple God he'll take John
[1:35:57] chapter 14 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:36:09] John chapter 14 verse 18 I would not
[1:36:19] leave you comfortless
[1:36:21] okay he's trying to go but before he
[1:36:26] goes he begin to talk I will come to you
[1:36:31] how is he coming again remember Solomon
[1:36:36] have to come to the bridal either and in
[1:36:42] the age of loud ISA he's outside also
[1:36:45] nothing just like Solomon was also
[1:36:48] nothing yet a little while and the world
[1:36:54] deceives me no more but you bye you see
[1:36:59] me because I live you shall live also
[1:37:03] and that day you shall know that I am in
[1:37:08] my father and you in me and I in you
[1:37:12] which day when I send you Elijah
[1:37:21] he shall returned her what is he
[1:37:27] interested in a heart the heart is the
[1:37:33] occupancy of the soul and in the soul
[1:37:37] brother Branham said there is only one
[1:37:39] access which is the South wheel and that
[1:37:42] self will is the logic that you have to
[1:37:45] happen for your husband to Camille but
[1:37:50] the logic is under Assad you have the
[1:37:56] right to reject and a right to accept
[1:38:04] let's go to verse 23 jesus answered and
[1:38:08] said to him if a man love me remember
[1:38:12] Solomon was saying my dove my love there
[1:38:15] is a love affair right if a man love me
[1:38:19] he will keep my word and my father will

[1:50:06] death in the Old Testament God when he
[1:50:11] came even though there was a hundred and
[1:50:14] twenty priests the pillar of fire only
[1:50:17] filled the house because the lamb was
[1:50:23] not slain it he was the one that take
[1:50:26] away the sin of the but when Jesus
[1:50:30] Christ came and John was him and he was
[1:50:34] crucified and he took away the sin of
[1:50:37] the world either in the day of Pentecost
[1:50:41] in the Sun Temple the upper room was in
[1:50:46] the temple in the sound
[1:50:49] when the cloud cancel instead of filling
[1:50:52] the temple the cloud fill the people how
[1:51:00] many people a hundred then he know he
[1:51:05] came deviate the people and fill the
[1:51:08] temple over there when he come the plug
[1:51:11] of Jesus Christ said no more the temple
[1:51:14] this way this way this way this way this
[1:51:17] way this way the pillar of fire wanna go
[1:51:24] to the altar Jesus say this is no more
[1:51:28] my temple I have new temples you when
[1:51:35] God came to his own temple yeah the
[1:51:40] church does when he came to them he feel
[1:51:45] it the temples plural that were
[1:51:48] dedicated just like he did that Solomon
[1:51:52] temple he feel it not with crib not with
[1:51:56] denomination but with he filled the
[1:52:00] temple with his Chicana grew so did he
[1:52:05] do on the day of Pentecost he filled
[1:52:08] them 120 temple that was up there with
[1:52:18] with the Holy Ghost itself the Shekinah
[1:52:22] glory brought through upon them in the
[1:52:26] Temple of Solomon the pillar of fire
[1:52:29] came he look at the people the blood of
[1:52:32] bulls and goats
[1:52:34] aha he went to the Holy of Holies and
[1:52:37] sat there but after the death
[1:52:39] resurrection and glorification of Jesus
[1:52:43] Christ Jesus opened the door that's why
[1:52:46] the mercy seat was split in two and the
[1:52:48] very walls open when the pillar of fire
[1:52:51] cameras the blood of Jesus Christ said
[1:52:55] how much the pillar of fire say how much
[1:52:58] have to feel are you there are you there
[1:53:02] and Jesus say here I have a hundred and
[1:53:06] twenty the pillar of fire said no worry
[1:53:08] I'm going to divide myself and the
[1:53:11] pillar of fire begin to divide itself
[1:53:13] one two three four and a ladder and when
[1:53:21] power may was going on the road to
[1:53:24] Emmaus he also see who the pillar of
[1:53:27] fire
[1:53:30] why when the bread was in the hand of
[1:53:34] Jesus Christ he can cut his return it's
[1:53:38] back again normal he cut back again
[1:53:41] normal he can't back again Roman he cut
[1:53:43] back and I know that's what John the
[1:53:46] Baptist said of his fullness we are go
[1:53:50] to John chapter one what did John
[1:53:58] chapter 1 John chapter 118 praise the
[1:54:06] Lord no.16 are you there
[1:54:18] and office the fullness of who Christ
[1:54:24] are you there have we all receive grace
[1:54:30] for you know that why when the pillar of
[1:54:35] fire came he divided fill the people but
[1:54:39] yet Paul can see him again because he's
[1:54:42] the fountain of water of what is
[1:54:47] fallible
[1:54:49] when you take water you still come out
[1:54:51] when you take water it still comma when
[1:54:53] he gives the bread is still come out
[1:54:55] when he cut the bread is still comma is
[1:54:57] the hole but he has other temple
[1:55:06] there is God to his temple God to his
[1:55:10] dedicated temple not the man-made
[1:55:13] achievement because that was the
[1:55:16] tabernacle that was the Temple of
[1:55:18] Solomon
[1:55:19] but the Moscow a guy God does not live
[1:55:22] in the temple made with no more the
[1:55:25] tabernacle no more the temple of God of
[1:55:28] settlement now I need living people that
[1:55:37] we found in cloud ISA brother branham
[1:55:40] say there was a painter that painted
[1:55:42] this and when the printer printed these
[1:55:45] people criticized him
[1:55:47] they say that you didn't put the light
[1:55:50] on the outside and Granum took this
[1:55:53] printer and turn around and say this
[1:55:55] printer was right if that's the profit
[1:56:00] to approve which painter is right many
[1:56:16] people view the picture of Jesus car
[1:56:20] he touched the Prophet to identify which
[1:56:23] picture is right either that's why when
[1:56:32] the Prophet to look he looked look he
[1:56:34] said the head of Hofmann and when they
[1:56:40] cloud the council God said take the
[1:56:44] cloud turn to the right he proved the
[1:56:47] head of Hartman
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:53] he touched the prophet to identify the
[1:56:57] truthful in that's John to identify the
[1:57:02] longer
[1:57:03] behold the lamb of God here are the
[1:57:07] picture of us when we had this picture
[1:57:14] of us men understand who do attacks John
[1:57:19] - pointer to you as John the Baptist was
[1:57:23] the foreigner is that's another child
[1:57:26] who went to you the Lamb of God
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] and when he calmly said the ratchet is
[1:57:38] not on the outside it is on the inside
[1:57:40] where did brother Branham have that when
[1:57:43] you read Salomon the logit is only when
[1:57:51] the bottom say that door is the heart
[1:57:56] because in the heart is the soul but who
[1:58:00] is Salomon now he was referring to
[1:58:04] Sullivan
[1:58:05] God was phenomenal as it helped of
[1:58:09] Christ over there so Solomon was also a
[1:58:17] trappers David was a top-off if you read
[1:58:21] the Bible you don't see question what go
[1:58:24] back again hallelujah but when Solomon
[1:58:30] counsel he is anointed he is gathering
[1:58:33] up with what myrrh and we found out that
[1:58:37] the body of Jesus Christ when he was
[1:58:39] killed he was anointed with what brother
[1:58:45] Branham and anyone knows that Mel is a
[1:58:49] very question but bitter herb a man of
[1:58:56] soul appointed with grief are either
[1:59:02] what did may represent his great supreme
[1:59:09] so Solomon is a poised upon Qing this
[1:59:13] woman
[1:59:15] the supreme sacrifice of the member
[1:59:19] why because the book of redemption was
[1:59:23] in the hand of the original owner and
[1:59:25] the cry came and they said who is worthy
[1:59:29] to take the book and to practice here
[1:59:32] and no one wants way to accept that the
[1:59:36] supreme sacrifice he was the one worthy
[1:59:41] to come and to take the book and when he
[1:59:44] took the book he comes down in
[1:59:47] revelation held the book chilling
[1:59:51] revelation 5 innovation Thunder booties
[1:59:54] he's coming to job to the bride with an
[1:59:58] open with Mohammed the simulation of
[2:00:10] what did man represent his great supreme
[2:00:14] sacrifice he's crushed out young life at
[2:00:19] Calvary where the sins of the world
[2:00:22] grant him in two beats gold because of
[2:00:27] king he talking about the three things
[2:00:28] and myrrh because of his sacrifice for
[2:00:32] for sinner that he dare he was wounded
[2:00:38] for our he was blue for our iniquities
[2:00:42] the chastisement of our peace was with
[2:00:44] brother Branham is connecting that to
[2:00:47] the atonement your atonement is brought
[2:00:51] for the healing of the body and for the
[2:00:54] serving of the in other words Solomon is
[2:00:57] coming with the full atonement to this
[2:01:00] Friday but he hits the door of a foolish
[2:01:05] virgin
[2:01:07] thank God did Matthew 25 they were also
[2:01:10] wise virgins
[2:01:13] are you there nerve and that's the
[2:01:18] ladies that lunch is under we seen that
[2:01:23] in the scripture the brother branham
[2:01:25] ever give you a scripture in he lied
[2:01:31] Christ not ever know Salomon was doing
[2:01:37] what but you have to open the door he
[2:01:44] will not go against you
[2:01:47] he's not gonna go there and force your
[2:01:50] latchet that your will your self away
[2:01:55] but for God if you are predestinated you
[2:02:01] don't even manager will if you are
[2:02:11] predestinated whether you say no
[2:02:15] suddenly you find yourself opening up
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:23] nobody can come to me except your father
[2:02:30] how many women have said to a man no no
[2:02:34] no no and today they are the men's how
[2:02:36] otherwise how many women have done that
[2:02:40] the man keeps coming low demand comes no
[2:02:44] the man comes no one of this day I love
[2:02:47] you thank you I love you thank you that
[2:02:52] that time I love you I love you too you
[2:02:55] see now you know why because you are
[2:03:05] predestinated for the manner
[2:03:07] [Applause]
[2:03:11] the lattice on the asada crush not yet
[2:03:15] at all but you have to open the door he
[2:03:18] will not go against you will he gives
[2:03:21] you the ability to read II mean he
[2:03:24] cannot force himself in for there is
[2:03:27] knowledge for him to come in by you must
[2:03:31] open the door
[2:03:33] that's why Paul say in the book of
[2:03:36] Hebrew when you hear his voice the
[2:03:38] harder you open yer and then what would
[2:03:46] anyone knock at the door for why is
[2:03:49] Solomon knocking for what would the
[2:03:53] object of someone knocking at the door
[2:03:56] it's trying to gain interest is a
[2:04:00] referral with a message with a present
[2:04:09] is if you will be baptized with the gift
[2:04:14] after today he's bringing you the
[2:04:23] message but that message has a gift
[2:04:26] because he's trying to bring the Holy
[2:04:28] Ghost inside of you or with a commission
[2:04:36] mark 16 or something that the one is
[2:04:41] nothing is trying to get inside to see
[2:04:43] who is inside but what happened Jesus I
[2:04:48] am going to stand outside of your door
[2:04:50] and walk all the time he not my sister
[2:04:58] my love open open the woman thought that
[2:05:02] if I keep doing what I'm doing
[2:05:04] he's going to still there stay there
[2:05:07] there is a time when we shall get enough
[2:05:12] and turn away that's your song of
[2:05:17] settlement he got enough
[2:05:20] are you there and turn away then you
[2:05:24] should do their knocking but you shall
[2:05:27] never did the sooner much found him
[2:05:31] again are you there
[2:05:34] come well it is time he before come what
[2:05:40] the reason look don't you compromise
[2:05:44] with anything less the Baptist Master
[2:05:47] Holy Ghost
[2:05:49] like they got out with the same top of
[2:05:54] the same top that they did don't you let
[2:05:58] nothing put anything in your heart
[2:06:00] unless not a different Holy Ghost but
[2:06:05] the knock the lock and the woman doesn't
[2:06:09] want what happened he anointed the
[2:06:12] latchet with me what does he know was
[2:06:19] anointed off they are nothing of what
[2:06:23] when he came as a sacrifice he already
[2:06:26] took death for you he went to the cross
[2:06:30] he took your penalty he took your shin
[2:06:33] he died in your place because the lamp
[2:06:36] in the Old Testament was dying in the
[2:06:39] place of the sinner so the first
[2:06:42] approach he's approaching you saying I
[2:06:45] took your place I died for you
[2:06:48] I took the sacrifice I took the pen and
[2:06:51] took the rejection all I want you to do
[2:06:54] is open up your heart and I am coming if
[2:06:58] he looks if he looks and you don't
[2:07:01] listen then that turn around the same
[2:07:04] word that comes - says who turn into
[2:07:07] judgment the third - to the souls in
[2:07:11] prison John the 19th chapter the 39
[2:07:21] verse that's going to the funeral
[2:07:24] service of Jesus when Mary and a moment
[2:07:26] they taken this man to anoint him we saw
[2:07:30] that over there
[2:07:32] he must be the servant of death for
[2:07:35] jehovah see somebody had to die so
[2:07:37] bringing them a showing that the deity
[2:07:40] and with the service that he also was
[2:07:43] anointed with myrrh
[2:07:44] that's this deed he had to be put to
[2:07:47] death in order to save the imperfect one
[2:07:50] which we were that was the first
[2:07:52] approach but since he did she did not
[2:07:55] open what happened
[2:07:56] the great man across remove and custom
[2:08:00] that did have life a few years ago right
[2:08:06] because in Azusa Street the Holy Ghost
[2:08:09] dropped down when the Holy Ghost job
[2:08:12] done he quickened the gift of the Spirit
[2:08:15] because the gift of the spirits were
[2:08:17] lost so God sent the Holy Ghost to
[2:08:20] restore back the nine gift of the spirit
[2:08:23] but there was a message docume the
[2:08:27] Pentecostal took the gift and they begin
[2:08:30] to go this way and this way and this way
[2:08:33] but there was a message coming out when
[2:08:36] the message karma the Pentecostal
[2:08:39] rejected the message when they rejected
[2:08:42] the message Muir was anointed in a
[2:08:48] Pentecostal church the Pentecostal move
[2:08:55] that did have in the past life a few
[2:09:00] years ago
[2:09:01] can't you see it's being anointed now
[2:09:04] with in other word Delta we father is
[2:09:08] time deaf Inc abode is blessed day we're
[2:09:14] going clear see the same own word was in
[2:09:20] the church here has come plumbed down
[2:09:23] and anointing this one down here dying
[2:09:26] out because they are going back to the
[2:09:29] ecclesiastical rod they are living the
[2:09:34] message other going back to the
[2:09:39] ecumenical move
[2:09:41] Murr has been anointed are you there and
[2:09:48] taking after the womanís Salomon says
[2:09:53] that I am sleeping I have done what
[2:09:55] takers life
[2:10:00] you remember take off the white robe
[2:10:04] says the leader people who stood a do
[2:10:07] and a genuine Holy Spirit spoke with
[2:10:11] dogs and manifested God and brother
[2:10:14] there was as honest and all wool and
[2:10:17] yard wine they absolutely were genuine
[2:10:21] you could trust them anyway in other
[2:10:24] word when the Pentecostal move started
[2:10:28] the people that were there when the Holy
[2:10:31] Ghost anointed them they were honest
[2:10:34] people genuine people but suddenly today
[2:10:37] we found coolkid preacher crooked people
[2:10:41] speaking in tongues living your hand
[2:10:44] away adultery
[2:10:45] homosexual in a post across the world
[2:10:48] what happened now you don't know what to
[2:10:54] trust and who to trust
[2:10:56] see there is something happened
[2:10:59] something happened what is it they are
[2:11:02] being anointed with of watch the people
[2:11:11] that live the message they become bitter
[2:11:16] against the messaging leader against
[2:11:20] brother branham read about the people
[2:11:23] that don't see like them it is an
[2:11:25] anointed of learn death instructing
[2:11:32] that's why the voice said come out of
[2:11:35] there but people
[2:11:39] hey come out of there my people the
[2:11:43] message come they rejected the message
[2:11:45] now he's knocking at the door but if you
[2:11:48] watch his not saying which church he
[2:11:50] said to whom they open he's dealing not
[2:11:52] with individual individual individual so
[2:11:57] this is your job to open yourself so
[2:11:59] that God can enter you can send the
[2:12:18] message of John the Baptist had the
[2:12:22] prescription repent be baptized and then
[2:12:28] you shall receive the Holy Spirit the
[2:12:30] repentance didn't bring the sinner to
[2:12:33] the remission of sin because the
[2:12:35] sacrifice has to be presented by John
[2:12:37] then washed and clear later and matter
[2:12:41] of fact when he was killed John already
[2:12:44] died John baptized with no name because
[2:12:47] jesus said that I come to reveal the
[2:12:51] father's name I come in my father's name
[2:12:53] he was the one died have to reveal the
[2:12:56] name of God that's why the Baptist means
[2:12:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:13:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[2:13:09] Father Jesus son Christ's Holy Ghost
[2:13:16] baptize them in the name of Father Son
[2:13:19] Holy Ghost brother Branham say come Lord
[2:13:22] Jesus Christ the Baptist means done open
[2:13:30] the way so that Christ can come in don't
[2:13:34] be like I should among where they knock
[2:13:37] the knock she doesn't want to open the
[2:13:39] door she still there she does I want to
[2:13:41] open the door she doesn't want to open
[2:13:42] the door then what Mary's for the day
[2:13:46] rejecting the message because he was
[2:13:49] their voice
[2:13:51] the bridegroom the voice came and was
[2:13:54] calling and knocking and in loud Esha
[2:13:57] there is another voice that came in at
[2:13:59] the voice of the seventh angel voices
[2:14:03] coming in in the church it is not a
[2:14:05] managed christ-rejecting that voice man
[2:14:12] in anointing of deaf is there deaf in
[2:14:16] other word they opened the door God
[2:14:18] gives permission to the white horse
[2:14:20] rather the anointing of deaf we say go
[2:14:23] ahead and struck and by the bottom say
[2:14:26] deaf needs a total separation with God
[2:14:29] eternal separation but God the church is
[2:14:33] under Ichabod the individual must come
[2:14:36] out
[2:14:37] but come out before it's too late before
[2:14:41] the husband take off and then you'll be
[2:14:43] seeking for him he's not there you're
