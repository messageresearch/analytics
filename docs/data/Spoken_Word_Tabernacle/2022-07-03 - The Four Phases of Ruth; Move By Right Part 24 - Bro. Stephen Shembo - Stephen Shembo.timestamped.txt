[23:34] my mind
[23:35] lord jesus
[23:36] it's you that we feel here this morning
[23:38] lord
[23:39] lord have you been expressed through the
[23:41] congregation
[23:43] this is not the spoken word church lord
[23:45] god by name only
[23:47] but lord we hear our precious sister pam
[23:49] lord
[23:50] expressing the spoken word speaking to
[23:53] the devil and tell him he's a liar
[23:56] and lord jesus our sister here lord god
[23:58] speaking to the devil and tell him he's
[24:01] a liar and as a congregation now lord we
[24:03] join our faith with their faith lord and
[24:06] we call upon you lord who spoke the word
[24:09] originally lord jesus and you told us
[24:12] that by your stripes we were healed lord
[24:14] god it doesn't say that we will be
[24:16] healed or we might be healed it said we
[24:19] are healed lord and there's only one
[24:22] thing that's standing between us lord
[24:24] god and our healing and that's our faith
[24:26] in your word lord and father what we're
[24:29] seeing in these sisters lord in their
[24:30] testimonies is the fruit of brother
[24:33] stephen's labor lord god because we know
[24:36] this faith comes by hearing and hearing
[24:38] by the word and how could we hear
[24:41] without a preacher and how could a
[24:43] preacher preach except that he be sent
[24:46] lord and lord i think of how that sister
[24:49] teresa and i just sit around the coffee
[24:50] table lord god and we chew on these
[24:52] nuggets and the
[24:54] little things that have come across this
[24:55] pulpit lord god and how it's just
[24:58] increasing our faith lord god and now
[25:00] we're lord seeing the anointing lord god
[25:03] of those sweet smelling precious
[25:05] ointments lord god and now the joy of
[25:07] the lord filling our hearts lord god the
[25:10] peace lord that passes all understanding
[25:13] oh father we could only be thankful to
[25:15] you lord jesus because we're lord we're
[25:18] not looking towards our righteousness
[25:20] lord we're looking towards the
[25:22] righteousness of the lamb of god who was
[25:24] slain for our transgressions father and
[25:27] we just want to express our thanks to
[25:29] you lord god we want to thank you lord
[25:32] god that you're still el shaddai you're
[25:35] still our provider lord god and how that
[25:38] you provided this home for our brother
[25:41] and for his family lord and lord we want
[25:43] to thank you in advance for finding lord
[25:45] that wallet for our brother chris lord
[25:47] jesus lord jesus we're believers lord
[25:50] god and what believers do is they
[25:53] believe lord god and so lord god we call
[25:56] things that are not as though they were
[25:58] lord jesus we don't walk by sight we
[26:01] walk by faith father and we're so
[26:03] thankful lord jesus to be a part of this
[26:06] great family of god lord and father
[26:09] we're thankful for the worship lord god
[26:11] and all those that you've anointed with
[26:13] gifts father and we're so plentiful in
[26:15] this congregation father and we just
[26:17] pray that our worship will be worthy of
[26:20] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[26:22] and lord jesus we just ask father that
[26:24] you'll touch every unspoken need father
[26:27] you're a discerner of the thought and
[26:30] the intent of the heart lord god and you
[26:32] know every word we're going to speak
[26:34] before we speak it father but you like
[26:37] to hear your children ask father and
[26:39] lord you said that whatever we asked if
[26:41] we believed we could have whatever we
[26:44] ask for lord god and lord you wouldn't
[26:46] return us a stone for an egg lord jesus
[26:49] or a serpent lord god father but you
[26:52] would give us lord god our the the
[26:55] portion that we've asked for lord and
[26:57] not only do you give it to us but you
[26:58] give it to us abundantly lord god and so
[27:01] now we're asking lord jesus christ that
[27:03] you'll take these words that will be
[27:05] spoken across this pulpit and you'll
[27:07] turn it into revelation and that
[27:09] revelation will become the stimulation
[27:11] and the stimulation will become a joy
[27:13] unspeakable and full of glory and lord
[27:16] jesus we pray now father for the
[27:18] offering lord jesus that it will be a
[27:20] free will offering may every dime every
[27:22] nickel every penny put into this
[27:24] offering be from the bottom of our
[27:26] hearts lord god not by constraint lord
[27:29] but willingly lord and then may you take
[27:31] that offering and multiply it lord god
[27:34] to supply the needs of this congregation
[27:36] lord the needs of the building lord god
[27:38] it's in our brother's heart to make lord
[27:40] jesus and lord god will give you thanks
[27:42] honor and praise for everything we have
[27:45] that's good has come from you in jesus

[28:29] sister pam
[28:31] and
[28:32] it's a song my and everyone else here
[28:35] it's a song my father used to sing
[28:38] many years ago

[28:45] they had the horse and buggy
[28:48] so you had if you had a horse back then
[28:51] that's precious to you
[28:53] and you take very well care of that
[28:56] horse and somehow you're quite attached

[29:01] but um
[29:03] what we have now is automobiles
[29:06] so i have one
[29:09] and um
[29:10] turns out that um
[29:12] the sunroof drains got clogged
[29:15] and i didn't know so the water would
[29:17] drain in the car and i didn't drive it
[29:19] for a time so i would drain in the car
[29:21] fill up the back of the trunk where the
[29:23] batteries and all that technology and
[29:26] everything else in there and totally
[29:28] soaked it when i finally brought it to
[29:30] it was like a swimming pool in the back
[29:32] of the car
[29:34] so um we got the water out and it'd be
[29:37] 24 000
[29:39] to correct problem the harness was
[29:41] totally damaged
[29:43] and um the insurance said it's gonna
[29:45] ride off well i'm attached to my car so

[43:55] i already prepared your sermon for this
[43:57] morning
[43:58] and everything was prepared
[44:01] and the title was a little bit different
[44:03] but for some reason your boss shifted me
[44:06] amen amen
[44:09] it's not me i have to follow the gps
[44:12] that's a supreme gps your boss shift me
[44:15] so i have to stay
[44:17] up last night and do the
[44:21] everything back and forth according to
[44:23] the leadership of the boss so you need
[44:25] your bible handy because we will operate
[44:28] in a different route today we're still
[44:31] going to be in the air
[44:33] but have your bubble because we will
[44:35] operate differently amen
[44:37] i was just following the gps amen
[44:40] so before we do that let me read the
[44:42] quote here
[44:43] by god's grace so that quote will kind
[44:45] of prepare you a little bit you know
[44:47] this quote by the brother i'm saying
[44:49] bible teaching
[44:52] is a little treacherous
[44:54] it's dangerous
[44:56] amen
[44:57] and later you know kind of walking on
[45:00] the thin ice you see how careful you
[45:02] must be that's why we want to make sure
[45:04] everything's come up straight from the
[45:06] scripture the bible says and brother
[45:08] brother i'm saying so we know that you
[45:10] are placed on a solid foundation not on
[45:13] the minister because if he goes away
[45:16] which i'm not going to go away i'll stay
[45:17] with this message amen
[45:20] then you get in trouble
[45:22] brother brother i'm saying but we just
[45:23] feel that maybe at this point
[45:26] and at this time
[45:28] it might be good to kind of bring the
[45:30] church to what i think
[45:33] to a complete understanding
[45:36] positionally this understanding is not
[45:39] just understanding
[45:41] but is understanding your position
[45:46] amen
[45:47] if you don't understand this it's a
[45:49] trouble
[45:50] i put up this quote first i didn't know
[45:52] that when when your boss began to
[45:55] shift me i began to see why he wanted
[45:57] that quote to be spoke uh to be put
[45:59] there amen
[46:00] a complete not a partial understanding
[46:06] amen
[46:07] a full understanding
[46:10] amen
[46:11] amen
[46:12] you know when we say completely on the
[46:14] seven
[46:16] amen a seven understanding
[46:21] positionally of what we are
[46:24] in christ
[46:27] not what you are in your family
[46:30] because that won't matter anything
[46:33] amen not your position in a family but
[46:36] your position in christ
[46:42] hallelujah
[46:44] your position in christ if you
[46:46] understand this position amen what
[46:50] random say and sometimes i think that
[46:51] preaching
[46:53] is a wonderful thing
[46:55] but i believe sometimes brother biller
[46:58] that teaching goes beyond that
[47:02] [Music]
[47:03] i don't know why people can't read this
[47:05] quote in the message
[47:10] everybody here brother branham said
[47:12] teaching goes beyond that's right
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:16] amen
[47:18] oh head knowledge hard knowledge he goes
[47:20] beyond it
[47:22] why does he go beyond
[47:24] amen
[47:27] it goes beyond
[47:29] that
[47:30] especially today
[47:35] why he said preaching usually catches
[47:38] the sinner
[47:40] bring him under condemnation by the
[47:43] water
[47:44] so the first step
[47:47] that the gospel approaches you brother
[47:49] kelly he brings somebody under
[47:51] condemnation
[47:54] anybody here when you get under
[47:56] condemnation you don't have any more
[47:58] power
[47:59] you are completely bereft
[48:01] you don't have any more strength
[48:03] amen
[48:04] but you need the teaching
[48:07] to now positionally
[48:10] in other words the teaching restore you
[48:13] back in power
[48:19] hallelujah don't worry my friend we're
[48:21] gonna climb amen
[48:23] he said preaching usually catches the
[48:25] sinner bring him under condemnation by
[48:28] the word
[48:30] but
[48:34] yes sir
[48:35] but teaching
[48:37] places you say because i'm a teacher
[48:40] i have coats
[48:42] you want trouble come and sit with me i
[48:44] will load you with coat
[48:47] until you get drunk with coat
[48:50] amen
[48:51] but teaching places
[48:54] demand positionally in other words when
[48:58] a man has been preached the gospel when
[49:00] he enter he's still in the air
[49:04] amen and the devil can push you
[49:08] to the right or to the left because you
[49:10] don't know first who you are
[49:13] so you need to be granted a certain way
[49:16] once you are grounded
[49:20] don't worry my friend
[49:22] he said but teaching places the man
[49:25] positionally what
[49:30] yes sir
[49:32] amen
[49:33] can i read it again
[49:35] he places you
[49:37] positionally
[49:40] what
[49:42] so this position
[49:45] is
[49:46] unfolding your identity
[49:49] [Music]
[49:54] amen
[49:56] so by positioning you begin to know who
[49:58] you are
[50:02] why is it important
[50:04] he says and we can
[50:12] do you see why we got trouble in the
[50:14] message
[50:15] do you see what people are tossed about
[50:18] because they were never positionally
[50:21] placed
[50:23] they were preached into for years
[50:26] but they were never positioned
[50:29] so you see 25 years in the message but
[50:32] he's in the air
[50:34] when they push him he's out
[50:38] [Music]
[50:44] hallelujah
[50:45] never
[50:47] rightly be able to have
[50:50] you might have faith you pray for the
[50:52] sick and somebody get here the
[50:54] pentecostal got that one that's right
[50:58] amen even a good baptist got that one
[51:00] [Music]
[51:03] amen
[51:04] rightly be able to have faith
[51:07] until what
[51:10] we know
[51:16] everybody okay
[51:17] so my subject this morning
[51:20] is
[51:21] move by right
[51:28] everybody okay
[51:29] you don't just move anyway
[51:31] [Music]
[51:34] everybody okay
[51:35] you move only by your right
[51:40] amen you didn't get it yet in other
[51:42] words you cannot move without knowing
[51:45] who you are
[51:48] [Music]
[51:52] usually i give you the subject i mean
[51:55] the data ladder your boss put it up
[51:57] differently amen
[52:00] you are moving by right
[52:03] you don't just move in the air
[52:06] you don't in other words here
[52:09] there is no adventuring
[52:14] amen because your position in christ
[52:18] when it's unfolded unto you you remove
[52:21] presumption
[52:25] amen in other words you do not adventure
[52:29] anymore
[52:30] without authority
[52:32] when you go to war
[52:34] you know what you're going to want
[52:37] and you know who you are
[52:39] and you know your weapon
[52:44] you don't enter
[52:46] hoping
[52:48] you know the outcome
[52:59] [Laughter]
[53:02] oh my god
[53:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[53:07] let's stand and read the portion of the
[53:09] scripture then you'll be seated
[53:13] hallelujah
[53:16] amen
[53:18] let's pray already so when i'm moving we
[53:20] move
[53:22] heavenly father
[53:24] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[53:26] this morning father thanking you for
[53:29] your grace for your love your mercy
[53:31] father
[53:32] and for everything you have been doing
[53:34] for us lord we are committing this
[53:37] service unto the hand father may you
[53:39] move us completely away may you the holy
[53:42] spirit come
[53:44] and minister to this church in a
[53:46] specific way this morning
[53:48] be the alpha and the omega and we rebuke
[53:51] every demonic spirit away from this
[53:54] place in the name of jesus christ
[53:58] amen
[54:00] so we already live in the airport
[54:03] go to detroit 25.
[54:06] so don't wait for the title anymore
[54:21] oh i'm guessing
[54:23] this is not a guesswork
[54:26] amen
[54:28] determine 25. if you dare you can say
[54:30] amen
[54:31] [Laughter]
[54:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[54:37] amen
[54:38] everything he was fighting is going
[54:42] that's right
[54:44] you think brother mike was crying here
[54:46] just for a person
[54:49] you stand here you will know who's here
[54:52] not me i just came in i just blended
[54:59] amen detroit 25
[55:02] verse 5. if you dare you can say amen
[55:06] if a present
[55:08] if present
[55:09] dwell together you might be seated
[55:13] so we fulfill that part
[55:15] of you standing for the scripture
[55:18] anybody okay
[55:19] i have a scripture in the bible where
[55:21] they stood for the scripture if you have
[55:22] a problem
[55:24] amen
[55:25] you say if brethren dwell together
[55:29] in unity you know
[55:32] amen
[55:33] not here
[55:34] if brethren dwell together
[55:37] and one of them died
[55:40] yes
[55:41] the four faces of roof
[55:44] move by
[55:45] right
[55:47] if one of them
[55:49] died
[55:50] and have no water
[55:54] so the case is
[55:56] very specific here
[55:59] we don't have to guess
[56:00] is he dead yes
[56:03] do you have the death certificate
[56:05] yes did the doctor pronounce him dead
[56:08] yes
[56:09] can we see the death certificate
[56:12] check
[56:14] does he have a child
[56:16] no
[56:18] so we are not broad we are very specific
[56:21] in the law now
[56:22] if there is no child
[56:26] the wife of the dead
[56:31] everybody okay
[56:32] everybody okay
[56:33] the wife of the dead
[56:36] shall not marry
[56:40] so that woman is locked
[56:43] right
[56:47] am i reading a different bible
[56:51] the wife of the dead
[56:53] shall not marry without to a stranger do
[56:57] you know what he means
[56:59] he cannot marry outside of that family
[57:06] even though the husband is dead
[57:11] the death of the husband only removes
[57:14] the first hardship
[57:18] amen
[57:19] amen
[57:20] amen
[57:22] her husband water
[57:28] her husband's brother
[57:31] shall go into her
[57:34] and take her
[57:36] to him as a what
[57:39] so when the
[57:41] first husband died
[57:45] everybody care
[57:47] amen
[57:48] the
[57:49] one following him
[57:52] is locked
[57:56] anybody okay
[57:58] when the first husband was alive
[58:01] that man was free
[58:03] to marry any woman he wanted
[58:09] the death of the husband
[58:12] freed the woman
[58:13] but lock his little brother
[58:19] am i reading a different
[58:20] scripture anybody here
[58:23] so once the husband is dead
[58:26] the woman is locked in the family but
[58:29] the one following the husband is blocked
[58:34] you cannot marry another woman again
[58:38] in your life
[58:40] you are doomed
[58:45] anybody care
[58:47] anybody here
[58:48] in other words the inheritance
[58:51] of the woman
[58:53] is 100 percent guarantee
[59:01] anybody here 100
[59:06] amen
[59:07] so naomi had no right
[59:14] to tell ruth
[59:16] that i don't have any more husband
[59:20] that's right amen
[59:23] amen anybody
[59:25] are we okay now we have no right to tell
[59:28] them that there is no more hope
[59:31] we already married in the family
[59:34] you must create a hope
[59:37] [Music]
[59:40] here because we are burned not to go
[59:42] anywhere
[59:44] [Music]
[59:51] she left her own inheritance
[59:55] by ignorance
[1:00:00] everybody okay so far we okay
[1:00:02] now
[1:00:04] take her to him as a wife
[1:00:07] and perform the water
[1:00:11] perform the water
[1:00:13] so it's an obligation
[1:00:20] the younger brother is under obligation
[1:00:26] he must
[1:00:32] the bible says this because i'm
[1:00:34] preaching already in matthew 22 verse 24
[1:00:39] saying master
[1:00:41] moses said
[1:00:44] if a man
[1:00:47] having
[1:00:48] no children
[1:00:49] his brother
[1:00:52] shall marry his wife
[1:00:54] and raise up seed on to
[1:00:58] his brother
[1:00:59] when we say shall
[1:01:01] you don't really get it
[1:01:06] the bible says in mark 12 19
[1:01:10] master
[1:01:11] moses wrote unto us
[1:01:14] if a man's brother died
[1:01:17] and leave his life with his wife behind
[1:01:19] him and leave water
[1:01:22] where did they learn this
[1:01:24] anybody okay
[1:01:26] that's his brother
[1:01:31] anybody here so it is an obligation by
[1:01:35] law
[1:01:37] you must
[1:01:41] you must
[1:01:43] should take his wife
[1:01:45] and raise up seed on to his brother
[1:01:48] anybody here
[1:01:50] so
[1:01:50] they continue with jesus they say now
[1:01:53] they were with us how many brother
[1:02:02] how many brothers
[1:02:04] why only seven
[1:02:10] there were seven presents
[1:02:13] meaning that they were sons
[1:02:16] they were men
[1:02:18] anybody here
[1:02:19] seven of them what happened to the seven
[1:02:24] anybody here
[1:02:25] and the first
[1:02:27] when he had married a wife
[1:02:30] disease
[1:02:31] death
[1:02:34] next
[1:02:35] and having no issue so the law still
[1:02:38] valid
[1:02:40] left his wife onto his water
[1:02:43] likewise the second also
[1:02:47] no children
[1:02:48] the laws still apply
[1:02:50] and the third onto the water
[1:02:53] and at last the woman also did water
[1:03:00] so
[1:03:01] seven brothers
[1:03:03] were unable
[1:03:06] to produce a child
[1:03:12] why seven
[1:03:16] anybody here
[1:03:18] who's going to produce a child
[1:03:22] who will produce the child
[1:03:24] let's go back to the scripture
[1:03:26] everybody okay
[1:03:28] anybody okay now amen
[1:03:32] and take her
[1:03:34] to him verse five
[1:03:36] as a wife and perform the duty
[1:03:40] of her husband brother to her
[1:03:43] everybody okay
[1:03:45] and it shall be
[1:03:47] that the firstborn when the first child
[1:03:50] is born
[1:03:51] anybody here
[1:03:52] the first one
[1:03:57] it's bible teaching my friend
[1:04:00] when the first born
[1:04:02] which it shall be that the firstborn
[1:04:06] which she bears the first child
[1:04:11] shall succeed in the name of his brother
[1:04:15] which is dead
[1:04:21] the way we understand this
[1:04:24] usually is that
[1:04:27] if the brother that is passed away his
[1:04:31] name is
[1:04:32] there is no william here so let me talk
[1:04:34] with him

[1:04:37] on somebody's families member let me
[1:04:40] call brannan
[1:04:41] anybody here his name is branham
[1:04:46] branham is dead
[1:04:47] without a child
[1:04:49] anybody here the brother take the wife
[1:04:53] and then a baby comes
[1:04:56] when the baby comes
[1:04:57] the way we
[1:04:59] in a pentecostal way
[1:05:04] denominational way the way we understand
[1:05:07] the scripture
[1:05:08] we will expect this baby to be called
[1:05:12] water
[1:05:15] which is wrong
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] let me read the scripture again with you

[1:05:24] bible say let's go quietly

[1:06:22] inheritance
[1:06:26] anybody here
[1:06:27] he's get he becomes head
[1:06:31] of the one that is dead amen
[1:06:35] amen
[1:06:37] if you got uh
[1:06:39] i don't know a thread of something
[1:06:41] put your bible keep the scripture right
[1:06:43] here let's go to genesis 38
[1:06:51] move
[1:06:52] by your right
[1:06:56] everybody here
[1:06:58] hallelujah
[1:07:03] i don't understand the scriptures say
[1:07:05] succeeding in the name
[1:07:07] let me make it a little bit worse for
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:10] so it will help you
[1:07:11] can we go back a little bit where we
[1:07:13] were let me let's make it worse
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:17] verse six and it shall be that the
[1:07:20] firstborn which she bears
[1:07:23] shall succeed in the name of his brother
[1:07:26] which is dead
[1:07:28] but it's even stopped in the middle of
[1:07:29] the scripture let's read it all
[1:07:32] that his name
[1:07:34] be not water
[1:07:37] pulled out of israel you see brothers
[1:07:39] even so they're saying the name
[1:07:41] now let's go to genesis 38.
[1:07:46] in genesis 38 the law is not there
[1:07:51] you remember
[1:07:52] moses is not born yet in genesis we're
[1:07:56] talking about abraham and joseph and and
[1:07:59] then the children of jacob genesis 38
[1:08:01] we're talking about the children of
[1:08:03] judah so moses is not born yet moses
[1:08:06] will wait all the way down there but
[1:08:08] what i read to you came from the law
[1:08:10] where did moses get it
[1:08:15] genesis 38
[1:08:16] verse one you there
[1:08:20] and it come to pass at that time
[1:08:23] that judah went down from his brethren
[1:08:26] and turned into a certain abdullah mad
[1:08:29] whose name was who
[1:08:32] ohira and judah saw there a daughter of
[1:08:35] a certain canaanite whose name was shua
[1:08:39] he took her and went into her so judah
[1:08:41] married a gentile woman
[1:08:44] and she conceived and bore a son and he
[1:08:47] called his name water
[1:08:49] what is the name of the firstborn
[1:08:53] the firstborn of judah
[1:08:56] amen hallelujah
[1:08:58] jump to verse 6 now
[1:09:01] and judah took a wife for her
[1:09:04] his firstborn whose name was who
[1:09:08] so air mary temer
[1:09:14] everybody okay
[1:09:17] verse seven is coming and
[1:09:20] judah's firstborn
[1:09:23] was wicked
[1:09:25] in the sight of the lord the first
[1:09:27] husband wicked
[1:09:29] and the lord did what
[1:09:31] the lord killed him for his wickedness
[1:09:34] anybody okay
[1:09:37] praise god
[1:09:38] and judah said to onan
[1:09:41] go in your brother's what
[1:09:44] wife
[1:09:45] and marry her
[1:09:47] and raise up seed to your water
[1:09:50] where did she where did judah learn this
[1:09:54] moses was not here
[1:09:57] moses is not born yet
[1:10:00] who taught judah this law
[1:10:03] and god took the law and put it in the
[1:10:06] word of god
[1:10:10] we okay now so we found this law already
[1:10:13] existed before moses
[1:10:20] so honorary
[1:10:22] who's following the brother must take
[1:10:25] care of them
[1:10:27] let's see
[1:10:28] if he has a choice amen amen
[1:10:32] verse
[1:10:33] uh
[1:10:34] verse nine thank you and onan knew watch
[1:10:38] carefully
[1:10:40] that deceived
[1:10:42] the child should not be what
[1:10:45] so now we got some correction here
[1:10:49] so are we okay now i told you baba
[1:10:52] teaching anybody okay so the child that
[1:10:56] is born
[1:10:58] the firstborn
[1:10:59] does not belong to the one that gave
[1:11:02] birth to him
[1:11:06] anybody okay
[1:11:07] when he's born he's considered the child
[1:11:11] of the dead
[1:11:16] anybody here so according to what we
[1:11:18] read it looks like if there's a child of
[1:11:21] the dead we're worrying about his name
[1:11:23] to be put out of israel so the baby must
[1:11:26] have the name of the father
[1:11:31] anybody okay so on here
[1:11:34] understood who taught him the law
[1:11:38] moses was not there yet
[1:11:40] he understood that if this child is born
[1:11:43] he's not going to be mine
[1:11:45] he belongs to her
[1:11:48] everybody okay now
[1:11:49] praise god
[1:11:51] hallelujah he said verse 9 he knew that
[1:11:54] he should not be his
[1:11:56] and he came to pass
[1:11:58] when he went into his brother's wife
[1:12:02] that he spilled it on the ground the
[1:12:04] salmon
[1:12:05] lest that he should give seed to his
[1:12:08] water
[1:12:09] so it's clear now the baby is going to
[1:12:11] the brother
[1:12:13] so if they ask you today that brother
[1:12:15] was dead
[1:12:16] does he have a child you will call that
[1:12:19] child that that child is his child
[1:12:23] amen
[1:12:24] everybody okay
[1:12:26] and whatever that bread the head
[1:12:31] everybody here
[1:12:32] belong to that child
[1:12:35] if that brother that was dead was a
[1:12:37] millionaire
[1:12:39] this baby is born a millionaire
[1:12:45] anybody okay
[1:12:46] anybody okay so far
[1:12:48] hallelujah let's go to verse 10
[1:12:52] and the thing
[1:12:55] which he did
[1:12:59] everybody okay
[1:13:02] please download
[1:13:03] [Music]
[1:13:09] so god was already in the law
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:15] before even israel existed
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:22] let me help you up again very good
[1:13:24] according to genesis 38 brother robert
[1:13:29] since the boss just dropped it to me
[1:13:32] right here
[1:13:34] we are dealing with gentile
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:39] everybody okay
[1:13:40] so that law came from gender
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:49] he was only transferred into israel
[1:13:57] everybody okay it is a gentle law
[1:14:01] a gentle godly law because god was angry
[1:14:06] that you didn't do what is right
[1:14:09] in other words i am in this law i am the
[1:14:12] one who's watching over this law
[1:14:15] but where is israel where is moses moses
[1:14:18] is not born
[1:14:20] where is the law we don't have law here
[1:14:23] so he have nothing to do with israel as
[1:14:25] a nation
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:29] let me help you again you who read your
[1:14:31] bible
[1:14:33] the promise
[1:14:34] was given unto abraham when israel was
[1:14:39] not dead
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:46] so that
[1:14:48] through abraham
[1:14:49] all the earth
[1:14:52] can be saved
[1:14:54] so he gave the promise to abraham before
[1:14:57] circumcision
[1:15:03] so that promise is not a jewish promise
[1:15:06] it is a gentile promise and god told
[1:15:10] abraham out of you all the nation of the
[1:15:13] world
[1:15:15] when he was not in israelite
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:19] everybody okay and this promise here
[1:15:22] this law is given to the gentile
[1:15:27] and it is applied
[1:15:30] when the tribe of judah
[1:15:33] married the stranger
[1:15:39] i don't know if you're getting me
[1:15:42] the first time this law
[1:15:44] is appearing in the bible
[1:15:47] everybody here
[1:15:48] this law appeared in the bible when a
[1:15:52] tribe of judah
[1:15:55] went and married a gentile
[1:15:59] then god opened this lord
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:15] and when he went and marry roof
[1:16:23] what must come out
[1:16:27] we okay
[1:16:28] did that lose anybody
[1:16:30] hallelujah
[1:16:33] let's go to verse 10. the thing which he
[1:16:36] did
[1:16:37] displease the lord wherefore god deal
[1:16:40] what
[1:16:41] it's very serious
[1:16:43] in other words if the next brother is
[1:16:46] not willing to fulfill that god kills
[1:16:49] him
[1:16:50] and when they kill the next brother the
[1:16:53] third one is locked
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:56] remember according to matthew all seven
[1:16:58] were locked
[1:17:01] until one
[1:17:03] give a child to that woman
[1:17:05] then the rest are free
[1:17:07] as long as that woman is not free it
[1:17:10] doesn't have a baby she's gonna finish
[1:17:12] your family
[1:17:15] so you better make sure to get it baby
[1:17:17] quickly so the other one get free
[1:17:22] the power that lays in you
[1:17:25] that you don't know
[1:17:33] in other words you better work to kick
[1:17:36] that woman out
[1:17:38] you better find a reason
[1:17:41] to kick that woman out because that
[1:17:43] woman have more power than you think
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:53] everybody okay
[1:17:55] everybody okay
[1:17:56] verse 11
[1:17:59] then said judah to temer his
[1:18:01] daughter-in-law

[1:18:08] go back to your father
[1:18:11] we're still family nobody kicked you out
[1:18:14] but you know things are too tough
[1:18:17] and you have been grieving a lot maybe
[1:18:18] if you stay with your mother she will
[1:18:20] kind of give you some fellowship
[1:18:23] politician
[1:18:24] anybody here remain a widow at your
[1:18:27] father's house in other words

[1:18:37] three only judah have three so they
[1:18:39] already got two down

[1:18:43] judah now is afraid
[1:18:46] ever here

[1:51:34] when a child of judah

[1:52:21] of seed
[1:52:23] of the seed which the lord shall give
[1:52:26] you of this young water
[1:52:29] everybody okay so boys took roof
[1:52:32] and she was with his wife
[1:52:34] roof was the wife of marlon
[1:52:37] so we expecting the baby to be called
[1:52:40] let's see
[1:52:41] so boys took roof and she was with his
[1:52:44] wife and when he went into her the lord
[1:52:47] gave her a conception and she bore a
[1:52:50] woman
[1:52:52] why they always come up
[1:52:56] son everybody okay
[1:52:59] and the women said to her
[1:53:03] bless the lord which have not left you
[1:53:06] this day without a kingsman
[1:53:08] that his name may be famous in israel
[1:53:11] anybody here
[1:53:13] jump to verse
[1:53:16] 16 and naomi took the child
[1:53:19] and laid it in her bosom and became
[1:53:22] nurse to it
[1:53:23] and the women her neighbor gave it a
[1:53:26] name
[1:53:27] saying there is a son
[1:53:30] born to who
[1:53:35] born to roof
[1:53:38] because they were redeeming naomi
[1:53:44] they are redeeming israel
[1:53:47] let's call him a jew
[1:53:51] jesus the jew
[1:53:54] everybody here
[1:53:56] there is a son born to naomi and they
[1:53:59] call his name wu
[1:54:01] he is the father of who
[1:54:04] the father of who
[1:54:05] why is his name not marlon but obed
[1:54:11] let's go to deuteronomy 25
[1:54:17] hallelujah
[1:54:18] sorry brother robert that's how he goes
[1:54:21] you are sitting with me in my office now
[1:54:24] everybody okay
[1:54:25] let's go to verse five now if a brethren
[1:54:28] dwelt together and one of them died
[1:54:31] and have no child the wife of the dead
[1:54:34] shall not marry without to a stranger
[1:54:39] you must know that when you're a woman
[1:54:43] you must understand you're right
[1:54:45] her husband brother shall go into her
[1:54:49] and take her by him as a wife and
[1:54:52] perform the duty the obligation of the
[1:54:55] husband brothers to him and it shall be
[1:54:58] that the firstborn which she bear shall
[1:55:01] succeed
[1:55:02] in it is no longer bearing the name
[1:55:06] because the child of judah never bored
[1:55:09] the name of air and the child of marlon
[1:55:12] of boaz never bought the name of marlon
[1:55:16] everybody
[1:55:17] but that's succeeding is what happened
[1:55:20] between ever and said
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:26] the bible said and adam knew his wife
[1:55:29] again
[1:55:31] and she bear a son and call his name
[1:55:33] water
[1:55:35] for god she said had appointed me
[1:55:38] another
[1:55:39] instead of what
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:43] they didn't give set the name of abel
[1:55:46] but seth was the replacement of abel he
[1:55:49] was in the place of evil
[1:55:53] so when you see set it's the
[1:55:56] resurrection of evil
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:03] so when you see this chad this child
[1:56:05] belongs to the dead
[1:56:07] when they say who's this child you say
[1:56:09] that's the child of malone
[1:56:12] so the name of malone is now remembered
[1:56:16] through the child
[1:56:20] everybody okay so far everybody good
[1:56:22] now let's continue down
[1:56:25] that the name of his brother which is
[1:56:27] dead that his name be not pulled out of
[1:56:29] israel now you understand this
[1:56:32] and if the man
[1:56:33] like not to take his brother's wife
[1:56:36] follow me carefully the man turn around
[1:56:38] and say
[1:56:39] like the one in the roof
[1:56:41] you okay
[1:56:42] no i don't want to do it
[1:56:45] then let the brother's wife
[1:56:48] the woman
[1:56:50] go up to the gate to the elder
[1:56:53] so not only was that an obligation
[1:56:58] or a duty but he have bad consequences
[1:57:02] that the woman can apply to the men
[1:57:08] there was legal consequences
[1:57:12] legal claim
[1:57:15] for the woman
[1:57:21] everybody okay
[1:57:22] am i reading a different bible let's go
[1:57:24] now he says if the man verse 7 if the
[1:57:28] man
[1:57:30] like not to take his brother's wife
[1:57:32] then let his brother's wife go up to the
[1:57:36] gate
[1:57:37] to who
[1:57:39] and say my husband's brother
