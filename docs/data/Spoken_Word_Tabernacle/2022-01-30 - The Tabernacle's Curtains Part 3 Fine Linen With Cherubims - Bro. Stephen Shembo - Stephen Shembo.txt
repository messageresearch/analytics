[Music] let's keep [Music] you might be seated this morning that'd be all for the music god richly bless you and it's always a pleasure to see the traps back in order amen always the music sounds so beautiful here compared to what is coming up on the streaming so i can't wait to have the whole sun system change so whatever you hear here you're going to feel it when you're home amen blessed be the name of the lord good to see everybody this morning and good to see biggie go back there i don't know when you sleep in big ego good to see you amen you should be singing here amen next time when you see him just emergency song requests just put him there amen and you he if you tired or your dynamo have not turned on yet he knows how to turn you up if he starts singing here before you know it your engine cranks amen a wonderful brother since we know him on fire and he still remain on fire amen how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand somebody's lacking ah man oh my god so if you get lost your gps is lost it's not my fault it's on youtube how many red x of this chapter 26 yesterday okay quite a few people praise the name of the lord if you didn't read it we send a text if you're not receiving text it is not my fault it is your fault to go see the deacon or the trustees and make sure of brother david and make sure you are listed in if you're not receiving the text amen we sent you a text letting you know that the meeting was cancelled because of the snow and then that you should read exodus 26 this is a difficult chapter and if you don't read it you don't have a background it's going to be very easy for you to get lost amen so by this time since we went to the first curtain you should be clear of what is going on amen so amen don't worry we'll turn you out the meeting that we have question and answer was cancelled because of the weather we were not sure whether it's knowing how many inches this one say one two we don't want to put anybody on the risk so just be patient lord's willing we will work out with the deacon and see when we can postpone it and give you a date so if you still have questions god give you a door of mercy bring your question and we will handle it amen i have questions for the young sisters they have not set up a date yet for their meeting they have some really good burners question amen the problem is they don't put their name the only problem i have there is one question that is really really really deep but if the person who they have put the name he would have helped me out but they didn't put the name now i tried there were four of them three of them i used an emergency bullet i loaded and the discernment pop up and told me who did it so the second one i'm still having a hard time to decode who that person is i contacted the person i said did you put the president say yes i say okay no problem the emergency bullet work so the other one is a little bit harder it's a question that is like merit question like non-merit question it's right blending in it's about birth control so when i put my hand on i thought it was something quick and i found myself in the ocean deep there in other words it opened up in the message woo i say oh my god what is going on here before you know it the scripture came out and i say wait a minute how can i find this where did did brother brother give a scripture and a quote came back to my mind and i searched the quote and when i opened that code i found it but i'm giving the scripture in that code so now it's a whole sermon that opened about it i can give you an answer but if a wrong seed somebody is not mature yet they can pick it up and cause damage so i'm just thinking whether i need to tell the young sister plainly and then i have to probably get the married people plainly i can just tell you what brother branham said but probably you won't get it because the message has a back part man when the prophet is saying something there is something behind that if you don't catch it then you don't catch the message then you can repeat the message like a parrot but you're not really repeating the message but if you catch the mind in other words if you catch the message in the message then your sound is different then you will understand why his brother random saying this and this so the way the technology is going on in this world you are exposed to everything until there is not even hardly anything to hide anymore what you think a child doesn't know they already know because they're on youtube they have electronic devices so that have been said upon the authority of the local church i might have to open the fire and just give it up plainly to the young sister the young brother is still cool so you wait amen until somebody opened now you open up then i open up if you cool i wait till you drown then i pull you from the water then i shake you up a little bit i say next time remember okay ask me okay amen i told a young man i say don't go on the internet to learn about women do you hear me do you hear me i told the young man i said if you have a question about a woman come come to me let me sit with you and when you're coming bring your bible then i'm gonna open the bible and i'm going to open brother branham ask me any question you want i say don't go learn don't google it come google in the message amen i spoke to a young man i told him i say i understand you growing up now now you start having puberty the black dog is wide open i say but don't go in the internet come sit with me ask me questions i will tell you let me teach you i'm a doctor also so let me help you out but i don't want you to learn on the internet because what you're learning is perverted amen and you're going to bring spirit and i can show you even a quote where birth control caused trouble to a child and brother branham discern it so you got to know what you're doing especially those that are married recently or the younger one and they're the one not being in church correctly and missing services do you know when you choose a pastor you choose him until until [Music] so you already hooked my brother you do amen just remind me trustees we have building found at the end of the service and stop running away from the service stay on the fire we're not killing you we're trying to help you so remember the building found at the end of the service amen blessed be the name of the lord you got it ready not yet my computer went off really the devil anyway let's turn to the book of matthew matthew that's what i had i'm going to have you sit back up again because i have a lot to handle this morning so you might be seated anyway because we're going to read it over again i'm just trying to save you some energy so you can say amen you got it brother it's restarting is that the time the fun to restart the stuff let's go to matthew chapter 1 verse 18. if you dare you can say amen the bible says in matthew 1 verse 18 not the birth of jesus christ i might have to use the board because my computer is behind now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was water do you know what i mean mary we have one service i have a lot to do we have election we have a lot to do so pull your breaks okay that restaurant if you go there do you know the waiting time right when you get there you're gonna wait two hours one hour 45 minutes so let me handle this okay okay whoever so chill out okay mary was engaged brother uh caleb you gather mary was engaged the word the bible uses espoused you got it the devil he even forgot that we got election so it will give me time for his computer for the computer to reboot there is a a powerpoint that will come up that's a lamb meeting and then you pull slide 86 please thank you yes sir they say mary was a spout the the meaning of his past means engaged or betrothed or what everybody mary was engaged to joseph before they came young people i didn't hear you before they came so before you come together am i reading a different bubble you must be water don't come together when you are not engaged we don't believe in boyfriend and girlfriend and hanging around [Music] anybody here so before you get together before you meet on the physical before you start having intimate relationship you must first be engaged or espoused did everybody here okay don't give me don't say buddy stephen i don't remember it's on youtube amen before they come together she was found with child of the holy ghost this child happened only once you didn't get it right so don't bring me another child with the holy ghost he won't come with the holy ghost i know for sure so the virgin birth only happened one no more okay no more virgin birth here [Applause] oh my god it's still not quite working for can you get that off very santa virus there is no corona here amen he said she was found with a child with the holy ghost that's the only permission we can get but it's one time a virgin shall conceive one virgin not many virgins only one hey mark here and that prophecy is a history it's sealed it's close there is no more virgin to conceive amen yes so don't bring any more virgin here to conceive that should be 86 my brother no click escape and find 86. amen verse 19 then joseph her boyfriend [Music] joseph what were they married why does the bible kill them by a husband everybody care so when you give your vow when you propose a woman you are hooked it's finished no turning back no turning back do you hear me everybody okay so you are hooked by the vow [Music] so when you hook by the vowel so automatically thank you my brother before god you are considered married it's done it's finished when god look at you husband and wife but not to be touched yet [Music] anybody here that's why when mary was pregnant it's a problem we need to find out who did this anybody here you touch after brother steve and pray for you amen oh another minister pray for you if you're burning come to the office you don't have to wait for a big reception come to the office let me pray for you no problem you are not sinning there is nothing wrong it's normal come to the office [Music] it's not a scene i'm gonna take all the loose further out anybody here don't run away come to the office and lay hands praise the lord anybody here then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example come on was murdered to do whatever how can you put a wife away if you're not married with her you only put away if you are married to put away means divorce that's right anybody care so when you are engaged in the eyes of god you are hooked god look at you as a married people not to kiss not to hug her not to play around the jokes on the body anybody care until the minister pray for you anybody here anybody here if you separate when you are vowed it's exactly like you are divorced in the eyes of god am i reading a different bible that's why before you get engaged be very careful and make sure what you're doing is correct because you're putting yourself for life everybody clear he was mandated to put hair away privately but while he taught on these things adjustment behold the angel of the lord appeared who's the angel of the lord god himself amen the angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream saying joseph you son of david fear not to take till you marry your water do you see god called that wife marry your wife for that which is conceiving hell is of the holy ghost marriage and divorce is luck right here but let me stay away from it in second corinthians 11 verse 2 paul said for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have in other words i have in the age of paul he was only his spouse but there is no ceiling yet we're going to get into that you're not sealed yet amen i'm gonna get in the tub and alcohol and you will see a lot of stuff in the next month amen he's gonna teach you marriage and all kind of stuff amen he said i have inspired you to have any husband so when i present you in this church young sister i have inspired you to only one so go on your facebook cut off whoever is there that's why to begin with begin to clean up your instagram get the boys out i have inspired you to one husband not many husbands anybody here that i may present you a chest water to who if i present you here i want you to keep yourself so i can present you to your husband with blessing and the parent happy and the family happy to one husband it's a great honor hey that have been said brother chris gus and sister rebecca porter got engaged let's think you can [Applause] amen [Applause] everybody here congratulations you might be seated it's a pleasure it's an honor so let me know the big day i already have a suit at home amen blessed be the name of the lord so it's a joy wonderful thing and we bless the lord for that amen blessed be the name of the lord so you know what we stand in this church it's coming from the word it's coming from brother branham amen remind me to pray for them at the end of the service it just the boss is reminding me the boss is pulling that back yes yeah the big boss is here amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the second one i'm gonna go to the election brother branham say every man ought to have a church home you need more code come and sit with me you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but have somewhere that you go to church and call it your church you cannot have two churches all three churches you must have one church that you call your home by the problem continue somewhere you pay your taxes ouch i won't pay my time he's already making money i'm gonna give it to him he will be more rich you are under a curse you're not paying your tithe to me you're paying your tithe to god [Applause] and somewhere that you help support the cause take your church your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because you don't belong with your group that's why we call them sisters churches that's why we meet together we can go to one another convention and we can fellowship together especially when they are in the message [Music] i have learned a little better than that now every person that is saved how many are saved [Music] so some of you are not saved i didn't see your hand how many people are saved [Music] okay if you now save that fire and i'm going to teach you how to get saved proud will kill you every person that is saved or to have a church home [Music] they ought to be in church and there sometimes every time that church has a service can you say amen or every time you pass it go in open the doors and go in and pray or do something how many of you have felt that you're not here did you stream you're home you're not streaming brother branham say i believe that every person should join the church i absolutely believe that every person should stand at their post of duty when there when their where the pastor is there preaching no there is a birthday going on over there there is a party going on over there no there is a friend that is coming to meet me over there and when there are pastors there preaching or evangelists or something i think they ought to stand at their post of duty i'm not a deacon i'm not a trustee that's not what he's talking about they ought to support that church with everything they got in them with their tithing why should i preach again tardy when i preached to you in a hotel and demonstrated and you still stubborn you're not cheating me i'm going to get taught and give it to the poor brother brandon i'm said no no you need the code come and see me ask the trustee where your task goes ask the treasurer they will tell you amen they got them with their tithing with their offering with anything that they are called on to do be willing and happy if your pastor asks you to do something in your church you should do it that is good but don't let that just be the only thing get inoculated first that is what i'm trying to tell you get the water do you see your problem it's a lack of a holy ghost in the message believers then the rest of it come on all right i hope it's getting here it is not getting in the head everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord brother if you can get me to tripoli that's what is causing it amen last one brother branham say now with our heads bowed not only our head but our hearts and as every member of this what is a member of a church you want to know what a member of the church is not according to brother branham amen amen according to who not according to brother stephen according to brother branham what is a member of a church brother branham say as every member of this church karma that come here why regular and supported with your water and water which is considered a member of this worker so to be a member of a church which you must have a church brother branham say you must be on that church on a regular basis brother branham said you must support that church with your task brother branham say you must support your church with your water you know what you're doing you know yourself what you're doing i don't have time to chase you especially when it comes to money amen you're not cheating me this church will continue to move and continue to operate whether you give money or not hey but here matter of fact we are well here we are by the grace of god so to be a member you must be here on regular basis you must support this church with your tax with your offering those are the members of a church according to brother branham that have been said if you don't meet this qualification you're not eligible to vote let's bow your ahead let's pray for the voting as the bringing the ballot and let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly this morning love is as corrected spiritual father i can never see my children misbehaving and me holding my peace some are doing far better some are still struggling probably because of ignorance probably because there is a devil maybe a hindrance somewhere that they don't get exactly that's they're not blocking us but they are blocking themselves for their blessings and they actually putting themselves in a different path with you lord father may your mercy be upon them those that do not attend service regularly those that do not catch up on the service those that are not lord father supporting the cause here or may be coming and helping when we need help father may you deliver them lord as we are approaching this moment this is a voting time we already gave the announcement we don't want you men to vote we want the holy spirit to vote father may you submit every heart under the inspiration of the holy spirit and may they be free to further put what they feel in their heart as they feel led the lord father by the holy spirit lord we commit them unto the hand may that will be done in the name of jesus christ amen if you can raise your hand and they will give you the ballot you can write your name there when you sign it when you put write your name do not put it without writing your name i am not going to call the officer and tell them you the one that say no the reason why i wanted the name if something happened i

where we are we still have a lot to do a lot moving on but by god's grace we go in little by little we will make it amen just being here it's a miracle we praise god for it that we have a church we can come and fellowship and praise the name of the lord you don't know how much money the hotel cost and god provided every every time amen and when we got here that money dropped remember building fun let's go to exodus 26. so you have accomplished a lot not brother stephen we we have accomplished a lot congratulations spoken word tabernacle good to see you brother joe let's go to genesis chapter 26 verse 1. exodus i'm sorry 26 verse 1. what did that genesis oh sorry exodus chapter 26 verse one moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twine lining you already know what it means now the righteousness of the sand and blue the spirit of truth the spirit of perfect fellowship and purple royalty adoption and scarlet redemption royalty with kerry beams of cunning work shall you make them you might be seated this curtain of fine linen is made of blue you know what it means of purple we already checked that one of scarlet and now we're going to deal with kerry beams remember this curtain is what we call the tabernacle hey mark here so when you call tabernacle this is the curtain anybody clear job to verse seven and you shall make curtain of god's hair we will get to this to be a covering upon the tabernacle in other words the goat hair curtain is the curtain that covered this curtain everybody okay upon the tabernacle eleventh curtain shall you make so this curtain when you look from the outside you won't see it anybody okay because the tabernacle when it was built it was built with wood america that's the way the tabernacle was built everybody here this side here the back side of the tub and across the west everybody okay then we have the north then we have the south then we have the east the door was on the east so when you entered the tabernacle you were entering brother charles from the east anybody here so if i take this and flip it you have something like this north west south and east so the door was coming this way okay so first they put the wood the framing when they finish the framing that's when this first curtain the tabernacle come and come over it and cover it when they put it you can see it if you go around the tabernacle you will see that curtain everybody but when they brought the second curtain and they put it on top of this curtain this curtain became invisible anybody here because after the second curtain they put the third one and they put the fourth one so you can go all around the tabernacle here you will never see this curtain everybody okay so far but there was one way to see that curtain everybody knows for you to see that curtain you must go inside the tabernacle do you follow me so when you enter the tabernacle if you look on the side it's wood overlay with gold you still don't see the curtain if you look on the back it's wood overlay with curt uh we we with gold you don't see the curtain if you look over there it's wood because the curtain was going on the outside of the wood everybody so when you enter here you look it's gold you look there it's gold you look over there it's gold so over here you got gold over there gold over here gold where is that curtain the only way you can see that curtain is when you enter the tabernacle and when you look up [Music] everybody okay everybody okay so this stubborn across the roof the inside roof of the tabernacle itself so when you enter the holy the other court you won't see it anybody okay you have to enter in the holy place then when you look up you will see that beautiful purple scarlet blue you say wow i never knew there is something like this anybody here when you come outside you look you don't see it because it's covered everybody okay so far let's go to chapter 27 hallelujah verse 20. relax we're gonna drop somewhere amen chapter 27 verse 20 and you shall command the children of israel that they bring you pure oil olive beaten for the light to cause the lamb to burn so the the those lamps are supposed to be burning all the time i tried to get in those lamp and something open up the prayer and understood the quote brother branham gave on the time of prayer i said my god how can you how can brother brother and be so accurate verse 21 in the tabernacle of the congregation outside the veil which is before the testimony aaron and his son the high priest and his son shall order it from evening to morning not from morning to evening we'll get maybe down the road from evening to morning before the lord it shall be a statute forever to their generation on behalf of the children of who israel what i'm trying to draw there is the light the candlestick inside the tabernacle where maintained by the priest everybody here they have to be checked by the priest regularly let's go to first samuel chapter 3. my time is fine remember you took your election first samuel chapter three if you dare you can say amen and the child samuel minister to the lord before elah and the word of the lord was precious in other words rare brother kelly in those days there was no open water why aha and he came to pass at that time when ela was laid down in his place and his eyes begin to watch them that he could not see and before the lamp of god everybody okay went what so there was a possibility that this lamp can go out if the priest is not careful because the tabernacle have three lamps when they built the tabernacle they built the tabernacle like this everybody okay this is the most holy or the holiest this was the holy place everybody okay and this was called the other court and this was the gate right here was the gate so when you enter there was an altar here called the brazen altar where they were burning the sacrifice everybody okay when you pass that altar what follows was your lever everybody here when you pass the level then you get into the holy place which they call the first century we will get to that anybody okay then you get to the holy of holies amen over here the light that was lighting here was the light from the sky oh the light from the zodiac anybody okay please stay awake don't want to lose anybody the light that was here was the light of the candlestick on the south side this was the candlestick and this light have to be maintained by the priest and the third one was the ark of the covenant here the showbread was here and then here was the altar of essence that's all here was the ark on top of the ark was the mercy seat and on top of the mercies it was the light of the pillar of fire this was natural light this was artificial light this was divine light i already finished the message right there depending on where you are it's going to influence your life anybody care if you watch your behavior it is telling you which light is operating on you everybody here there is a reason why you keep wearing high heels there is a reason why you keep watching pornography and before the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the earth was the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to water praise god let's go to matthew 19 and then we're going to pray give me grace [Music] hallelujah matthew chapter 19 verse 16. i'm trying to help you diagnose what is your problem and you won't get mad on anybody and you won't blame nobody anymore you have to adjust yourself and be serious with god then your facebook your instagram will go down if you just adjust yourself you will see that facebook running away verse 16. and behold one came and said to him good master you already know what it means what good things shall i do that i may inherit it may have eternal life and he said to him why call you me good there is none good but one that is god in other words i'm god amen but if you will enter into life did you get it if you were entered so you got to enter in life you don't talk too life you got to enter to enter into life keep the commandment he says to him which so this is not somebody from the street who are born in a message it is not somebody from the street he says to him which which commandment tell me which quote jesus said you shall do no murder you shall not commit adultery street you shall not steal street you shall not bear false witness those liars over there i know your father and your mother i was brought up in a message in a strict way and you shall love your neighbor as yourself the young man said to him all these things have that kept from my youth what a home he grew up in he didn't grow up going to the nightclub strict home amen all these things have kept from my youth up what luck i yet in other words what is still missing that i feel like i don't have eternal life so despite all of this the young the rich young ruler understood that something is missing christ i did what the preacher say but i'm still missing something what am i missing let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is what a man can do if you given him ability to do is just read the scripture but when he comes to interpret and blessing your children he only take an action from the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may you remove every demonic spirit that is trying to attack and bring resentment to this service father will rebuke them back to hell in the name of jesus christ be the alpha and the omega of this service in jesus precious name amen god bless you put your seat belt and let it go amen we are on the tabernacle curtains part three we are still dealing with the fine linen when we started with the lever we found out that the level involved the high priest and his family amen because god chose aaron and his son and god chose them to give them the priest office anybody okay so far but we found out that the government of aaron was different than the garment of his children yet the anointing of aaron was the same as the anointing of his children the bible says and that shall anoint them the children of aaron as that did anoint their father that they may minister unto me in the priest's office so the priest office was given to aaron and to his children and the anointing that was upon aaron was the same anointing upon his children but yet their garment was different anybody okay a priest could approach the tabernacle and enter here and nothing happened to him anybody a priest a son of aaron could approach and enter here and nothing happened to him everybody but a son of aaron could not enter right here even though he was chosen even though he had the same anointing as aaron his father he was forbidden to enter here if he enter here god kill him we got the anointing but we still have an access of god that is blocked yet we are the sons of the high priest the only person that was able to enter here was aaron aaron could pass here no problem here no problem here once a year no problem with the blood and god doesn't kill him in other words the high priest have certain privilege more than his children yet they were anointed the same way how can we solve this problem hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord when we spoke about the first curtain we found out that curtin was called the tabernacle like i told you the tabernacle was framed with wood that was overlaid with gold so when they put the first curtain you have to enter inside to see it from the inside anybody care and that curtain was made of fine linen blue purple scarlet now we are dealing with the caribbeans anybody okay so the first time they put this curtain on the tabernacle if you look you say oh that's a beautiful curtain when you look where they ask you a question what do you see you say i see a blue color i see a scarlet color i see a purple color but i see some creatures there what are those creatures doing there anybody okay anybody okay so when they put the other curtain all over the tabernacle this curtain disappear from the outside view the only way you can see that curtain you have to enter into the tabernacle brother branham says this that god has made it so wonderful that in the old testament he were usually i go to for refuge for a text once in a while he's made the old testament in parable and in symbolic form to express himself and his doings that the simple-minded might be able to have a conception of his will on what he's doing god has a will he want to do something but god made the old testament so that a simple man can look through the old testament and begin to understand how god operated brother branham said in the old testament being a top of the new the works of the inward cuts of the tabernacle so when you go in the tabernacle you see the tub and alcohol the tabernacle have three places one two and three and brother branham is saying that their works are the action because works is faith expression everybody the works that you see the priests doing in the tabernacle have a message so when your priest entering the tabernacle there is something he was doing here there is something he was doing there there was something they were doing there and brother branham said their works the actions of the priest had a message brother branham said the inward cult of the tabernacle was a beautiful picture of god's plan of water so when you look at what the priests were doing here he was talking about the plan of god amen to save mankind so when the priest bring a lamb and he's entering with a lamb the priest was telling israel something israel didn't understand it anybody clear brother branham say if we can only learn that's why we're learning by this now and how to get ourselves in the condition to receive what god has in store for us it shall just sweep the whole valley here my people suffer for lack of knowledge everybody here so far so when you enter into this tabernacle you look you don't see that curtain if somebody tells you there is a curtain that is blue scarlet purple you can look around you won't see it the only way you can see that curtain is you got to go inside the tabernacle when you enter the tabernacle like i said you look right here gold you look right here gold you look right there gold the only way you must look up are we okay i'm still going with the airplane like this anybody okay so when you look up you will see a blue color you will see a scarlet column you will see a purple color but there is a creature that look at you [Music] why a creature that creature is called a caribbean anybody okay let's handle it in genesis chapter 3 that's the first time the word caribbean appear in the scripture everybody okay hallelujah brother the bible say and the lord god say behold the man not a woman i have a coat let me stay on the highway behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and leave water the earth was created for men anybody care but man was not living all over the earth everybody okay this is the earth then god took a region of the earth and called the region eden everybody here and in eden here that's where god created man everybody okay then on the east side of eden god planted a garden everybody okay then inside that garden on the east side of that garden [Applause] god put an altar [Applause] did i lose anybody so the earth you can live here you can live here you can live here everybody okay so far the earth itself was the other coat the garden of eden was the holy place i'm sorry eden was the holy place and the garden of eden was the horniest because in the garden of eden that's where god was coming all the night god was not coming here god was not coming there god was coming in the garden of eden at the evening time everybody okay so far your tabernacle is moving this way everybody okay hallelujah the bible says therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden are we okay so one man sinned hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i wish i can lock you here three hours somebody say my god chill out anybody okay because there is a pipe that is connected to me there is like a river and and i only have a small outlet and i'm trying to pump as much as i can everybody here anybody okay so one man sin in the garden of eden god kicked him off from the garden of him eden in other words man left here and came to eden are we okay man left the hardest place everybody following me into the holy place anybody here amen everybody okay jesus christ he sent him from from the garden of eden to till the ground from where he was taken anybody okay when cain sinned god took care out from eden let's go to genesis [Music] at the opening of the seven seals the bible becoming you my god what an anointing let's go to genesis genesis chapter 4 verse 16. if you dare you can say amen amen you're there and can went out from the water in other words he's going away from the light okay he went out from the presence of the lord ever here and dwell in the land of water on the east of water so cain when he sinned he went on to the other coat let me help you up men have three parts you have your body which is the other court you have your spirit which is your holy place and you have your soul which is the holiest of holiest america so when adam was kicked adam left the dominion of living with god in the heart and he went in the spirit everybody okay but when can sin can didn't stop in the sin in the spirit he went into the flesh everybody okay everybody okay jump to verse 17 and can know his wife and she conceived and bore who jump to verse 18. and enoch was born and and to enoch was born arad and arad father me huizhou and mahuja father metuzel and methuselah father who in which land the land of nod outside of eden and lament took to him how many wives why didn't adam take two wives everybody here one was living in the flesh that's where we performing me [Applause] [Music] everybody here oh my god job to uh job to verse 21 and his brother name was juba and he was the father of all that under the water help and water be careful musician everybody okay verse 22. and zela she also paul who tubercan an instructor of every water medal craftsmen in the brass and iron brother branham said that's why the lineage of can produce scientific so this other code here was planned with polygamy and science here education everybody okay the second layer in eden people remain a little spiritual but man was kicked out from the garden of eden which was the holy place where man was meeting god and when he was kicked as a holy person god brought soldiers so he drove out man and he placed at the east of the garden there is a problem there that's where the altar was at the east of the garden of eden water and the water which turned where to keep the water the tree of water so in the garden of eden there was life how may i enter into life good master life was there the tree of life was there men have access to that tree of life but when men sin god moved men out and back here and he put carry them back here so when you want to go get eternal life when you look you see a caribbean's he's looking at you like don't get here everybody okay he put kerry beams and a sword he put carry beams and a sword how many caribbeans you will see the jehovah's witness i don't know who who put two caribbeans there is a reason why they put two hallelujah when god told moses he said make the ark of the covenant and they begin to make the ark of the covenant god told them make two caribbeans and put the caribbeans upon the ark of the covenant that is in exodus 25 and thus have met two caribbeans of gold and beaten work shall that make them into end of the mercy seat why are we having four caribbeans but moses was told to put two at chapter 1 7 verse 44 the bible says our father had the tabernacle of water two or three witnesses let everybody be established in the wilderness as he appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the faction he had seen in heaven so the tabernacle was only a testimony [Music] a witness that's why moses only put two caribbeans bad caribbeans are full amen oh my god brother branham so he drove out the men and placed at the east of the garden of eden caribbeans and a flying sword a sword a flaming sword which turns every way see the water there is only four ways you can go every way four ways that's why you need a profit east north west south these caribbeans had a flaming sword at the gate of the garden to keep the way of the tree of life because if man ever get a hold of the tree of life then he could leave hell so the first curtain of the tabernacle that curtain that have our redemption that curtain that has our adoption that curtain that have our holy spirit that curtain was blocked when you want to approach it he tells you the caribbeans are on this curtain and when you enter the tabernacle you look up you see caribbeans in other words the way up was blocked do you follow me that's why everybody who died in the old testament could not grow up everybody was going down to paradise abraham down job down david down solomon down mosey all of them that down why because the way up was blocked by caribbeans [Music] blessed be the name of the name in ezekiel 10 the bible said in verse 14 and everyone had four faces the first face was the first of a caribbean which means an and the second verse was the face of a man and the third first was a lion and the fourth verse was a water it's in the book of revelation john saw the same thing verse 15 and the kerry beams will lift up this is the living water so the caribbeans have three names in the bible hallelujah they are called caribbeans they are also called a living creature and they are also called beasts the four caribbeans the four living creature or the four beasts everybody okay in verse 20 the bible says this is the living creature that are so under god the god of israel by the river of quebec and i knew that they were what so cherubims and living beings are the same that's the same thing that john saw in the island of patmos everybody okay so far what is wrong with these caribbeans brother branham say these caribbeans that john saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so they must be interested in human beings or read genesis getting back to genesis again they kept the tree of life guarded the way of life the way of life why is the way jesus say i am the water everybody okay so the tree of life was a person everybody here everybody here and the caribbeans were blocking people to access that person that's why the rich young ruler leaves all the law that he could but he figured out i cannot get access to eternal life then he came he said good master how cannot get into the tree of life hallelujah hallelujah he said i am the one i am the bread that come down from heaven from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he shall live what in other words i am the tree of life if somebody eat me that's it everybody okay now there is a way back to that tree of life the carribeans in the tabernacle were on the mercy seat which was the throne because when moses saw in heaven he saw god sitting on the throne and he saw four caribbeans guarding god so when the throne of god came in the tabernacle they have to put caribbeans to garden amen but god have three thrones [Music] brother branham i need more battery for tripoli the first throne was in heaven that's what moses saw the judgment seat the second throne was in christ everybody here that's why the rich young ruler could come to christ because he knew good master jesus said if you call me good master you know that i'm god you already understand that but good master how can i get to the tree of life everybody okay and the third john was in what hallelujah what is wrong with these caribbeans brother the bible says these caribbeans here were placed to block people from accessing the tree of life or accessing god in other words man that was sent out here when you want to go back again to the garden of eden the kerry beams are blocking you anybody care not only kerry beams but the caribbean's plus a sword and that sword have flame because it's judgment anybody here brother branham say anyhow when the angel begin to pull his flaming sword out to god this water the bible says there was an angel there the bible says there were caribbeans and a sword flaming and you would see people putting pictures of a sword flaming on its own brother branham said no there was an angel there where did brother branham get that in the message end time brother branham say i imagine they come to the east side of the gate and there is where the angel stood with this flaming sword grabbing the tree of life by the way he was guarding the people away from the tree of life brother brother is saying that the caribbeans were not alone okay we have four caribbeans and there was an angel there with a sword the bible only said sword but hide the angel brother branham what is happening in number 22 the bible says about balaam that the earth saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his water joining his hand this message is perfectly aligned with the bible everybody here in joshua 5 13 the bible said it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lift up his eyes and look and behold this to the man over against him with water brother branham said he was the peanut of fire that became a man hallelujah and he said but as the captain of the host of the lord i am now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did what so this angel is who so in the garden of eden there were four caribbeans and who but god was angry and his sword was flaming hallelujah hallelujah and then he says what says my lord unto his servant and the captain of the lord of hosts lord source say unto joshua lose the water off of that food for the place where the stand of his water who said that before and who was talking to moses the pillar of fire ever here and now it's not the pillar of fire it's a man that's why brother branham said the pillar of fire became a man brother branham never gave you the scripture here is the scripture the message and the bible are perfectly [Music] mine are we okay i see a lot of moving okay blessed be the name of the lord everybody okay in the first chronicle chapter 21 either three years of famine david sin god gave him and threw all three months to be destroyed before therefore why the sword of the war that the sword of that enemy overtakes thee or else three days the sword of the who even what in the land and the angel of the lord destroying through all there so the sword of the land of the lord have what that's why you don't approach it anybody okay and david lift up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having drawn the sword in his hand stretch out to who go see in the bible how many people die anybody here in revelation 19 verse 15 out of his mouth go off a water that we think he should do others anybody okay so when man was kicked out of the holy place god block it with four carried them in other words the throne of god moved and god pulled his sword and the sword was flaming so when you come you see caribbeans you back up everybody here so the caribbeans were a blockage to access god and this fine run and curtain god told moses mix this curtain with caribbeans telling the people in the old testament that the way is still blocked that redemption of your scarlet is blocked royalties block blue is blocked nobody can get the holy ghost nobody can get redemption no sin can be redeemed because the blood of bulls and god could not bring redemption everybody okay everybody okay take your bible to exodus 26. if you're tired do you let me know men shall not live by bread alone [Music] i can let you go you will sit there 45 minutes anybody okay anybody okay blessed be the name of the lord let me go back again to the tabernacle if you're on 26 you can say amen remember now before you read i want everybody wait here the fine linen is made of what and what and water and with water caribbeans which is telling you that the way is blocked no access anybody here listen carefully go to exodus 26 31. you there that's why i told you to read exodus you there and you shall make a what let's stop there let's come back to the prophet to the prophet the tabernacle have three places when you come you enter the gate everybody okay when you move to the gate you come here there was a veil here this veil remember the level they thought bring the lever to the door this veil was called the door it was a curtain at the pull-up you remember then you move here you come here there was another veil right here everybody okay and this vale here was the veil that the high priest have to go through once a year so there was a veil here a veil here and a gate everybody okay there were three doors to the tabernacle the first you enter the gate the gate gives you access to the other court then the door which is there gives you access to the holy place then the inside there give you access to the holy of holies are we okay this inside veil here is what we are reading now you okay now now let's read it 37 uh 31. and that's a make a veil this fail everybody okay remember this veil okay when you pass the gate you enter which light are you under the zodiac the sky when you enter the door you under the candlestick but to see god to enter where god is you must pass the third veil let's see how is that third veil made you ready now you ready now there is sad curtain brother robert is blue purple scarlet with what blocked the inside veil is made out of what you read your bible don't say brother stephen say and that shall make a veil of what my god blue come out and what camera semicolon and water what is the difference between this veil and this curtain what is the difference zero everybody here so this veil is exactly like this curtain and this verb have also what meaning is what that's why nobody could enter the holy place the holiest so when you enter god put the caribbeans so when you see the caribbeans even if they preach for god he said kerry beams means don't get there when aaron comes aaron must make sure he have blood for his sin and he have to tremble because if you put your foot bad you're dead so aaron have to go slowly with the blood for himself and for the people and they put a bell on aaron so that if something happened and he died inside there nobody got to pick him up because they were putting ropes on the high priest when he's entering if he dies there you don't get there you pull him you pull his body from the rope and you get him off because of the caribbeans this veil is exactly so when you enter the tabernacle you look up and you look straight to you god block up and god block to the holy place that's the first veil job to exodus to verse 26 now we are going to the second veil that is called the door of the tabernacle anybody okay are you tired are you bored i see somebody like this some people are like this okay you saw your excitement goes like this those some are going like this what an excitement i will see you when you watch your movie at home verse 36 are you there it was just to relax you and that shall make a hanging for the water now we are here everybody here now we are here okay let me

come on and what did you see kerry benson jesus i'm still waiting for you to pick it up i'm still waiting for you to pick it up somebody have not picked up yet did you see kerbeams let me go back to the beginning aaron could enter here no problem enter here no problem here once a year with blood but the sons of aaron can enter here here and stop why could they enter here and enter here but they cannot enter here did you hear because this veil didn't have caribbeans in other words the access is open that's why the priest could enter the veil but when you go to the holy veil stay away it's blocked anybody okay we okay now we've seen this with caribbeans this no caribbeans let's look at the gate let's go to exodus 27 verse 16. at the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new the fan lemon caribbeans inside their water and when jesus died do you know which veil was torn relaxing relax hold it hold it hold it hold it hold on oh on pull your break pull your break pull your break by the rabbit don't pull the dynamite to it it's over let's hold on let's hold on you want to go home you want to go home oh my god let's go to the gate verse 16. are you there for the gate of the water anybody okay shall be a what so the door of the tabernacle the gate was not a gate like this one it was a hanging it was a curtain anybody okay 20 cubits of water kama and water karma and water come on water did you see kerbin that's why you could enter the court no problem you could enter the holy place no problem the holy of holi that's why adam you can come here no problem you can live in eden no problem when you want to get in the garden of eden [Applause] caribbeans caribbeans caribbeans what does it mean why all of this what does it mean what does it mean brother stephen what does it mean to me i understand it now what does it mean to me hebrew nine there was a tabernacle made the first wearing walls there and the table and the water so this is the first tabernacle paul is talking about this now when you read your bible you're going to read it differently from now on back here which is called the water so this holy place another name for it is the sanctuary the first sanctuary you need to know bible anybody okay and after the what he's talking about here this is the first verb and you see now after the second fail the tabernacle which is called the water everybody okay now when these things were dazzled in the priests went always into the water in other words the sons of aaron could only stop here that's the further they could go that's it everybody okay accomplishing the service of god but into the second the second veil the holy of holies everybody okay want the high priest alone once a year every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the error of the water what does he mean the holy ghost this signifying in other words the holy ghost was giving a message and the message the holy ghost was giving to israel is what is that the way into holiness into the holiest of all was not yet made what why as the first tabernacle was there to act in other words the holy ghost was telling the people the the the going back to the garden of eden is blocked they're going back into the presence of god they're going back to eternal life is blocked that's why you have a curtain with caribbeans caribbeans on your front carry beams going up so when the old testament sent die he tried to go up the caribbean say down to paradise down down which blood do you have i have the blood of job job witch blood uh it's a lamb to paradise which blood do you have goat paradise which blood do you have both paradise who can enter into the presence of god hallelujah what does it mean brother stephen hallelujah hidden life on the inside of this inner court called the holiest of holies there was a piece of furniture sitting there called the mercy seat i already explained it to you and the covenant was in the ark and the ark has two water we own the whole yeast and he was on the inside that was the furniture inside the holy place next coming out was the golden candlestick we are on the holy place then on out to the water the level we are on the outer court now he perfectly represent the age of what now we begin to to move clearly okay i'm starting with the church age then i'm gonna drop to you okay iran present what and then and then exactly the three step of dispossession of his what that has been given to who remember the works of the tabernacle was showing the plan of redemption of god everybody so now brother branham is telling us hallelujah now brother branham is telling us that what you come the other court is looter what you call the holy place is wesley and when you call the holiest is pentecost sanctification and pentecost brought the baptism of the holy ghost everybody so as you come to god in your life you are actually entering the tabernacle brother branham he said exactly the three steps of dispersation of his grace that have been given to mankind we are in the last water i believe that with all my heart lord help me hallelujah brother bottom say in closing i shall say another thing that in this place where you dwell on the inside the secret place with god there is a difference in them there was three light that led man you remember me telling you everybody here there was three rights that led men today the first thing there was three stages of the manner there was three stages of everything there is three stages of your experience your experience with god you actually going into the tabernacle but where am i hallelujah hallelujah there is two classes of people today them same classes that is trying to do something to save themselves [Music] each one say i go to church every sunday that's very good i want to be religious that's very good that's still under the law but when the other by going to church and being good is not something that you do yourself it's something in you doing it for you the holy spirit in your water let's go slowly we're climbing anybody okay oh my god put your seat belt when you enter the gate we will deal with this gate because there is four doors that curtain when you lift up you have four doors and the second one you've lift up you have four things yes there is a reason why it's four four four anybody okay so even though you have never seen the east side of the tabernacle and see upstairs to see that veil the gate of the tabernacle looks like it you okay now if you see the gate you already see the veil if you see the door you already seen that there if you see this there you already seen that veil what is this what is this what is this anybody okay now when you enter into here into the gate the first things it's a brazen altar brass means judgment that don't there he will come with your sheep because the sheep represent you you are the one that they need to kill by god anybody okay but god gives you a substitute because when god told i told abraham go kill isaac isaac should be killed god said don't touch it get a beast in other words i'm replacing something for you to use the perfect isaac is coming down the road you can kill him not this one anybody okay so you bring the animal and you're gonna prey on the animal you follow me your adultery leave you and enter the animal you're lying leave you and enter your animal everything that you did wrong enter an animal and that lab must be perfect everything bad goes into the animal so the animal innocent become guilty because of you and the you bring that animal and you put him on the altar and you put your hand there anybody okay so the priest bring the knife and begin to cut the throat of the animal so when the animal is trembling is speaking a different language because there was also a man who was dying at the cross and he began to speak in tongues it's a different language because the lamb have to speak a different language that you don't understand this message this message my friend is something else so when you cut the lamb the lamb is speaking in tongues you don't understand it everybody okay the lamb is trembling blood is going all over everybody the lamb is killed in your place [Music] everybody okay everybody okay and that although was three by five let me leave the altar he was three cubit and five cubit grace and perfection he was in that altar everybody okay so that president there represented your cross everybody okay the next that follow was the level the level was where you take and you take the whole animal and you do what you dump it into the water are we okay did that know somebody your baptism follow okay the entrance in the tabernacle was a message for god how to save men so when you enter into the tabernacle the brass and altar is looking at you when you cross the brass and alter then you got to get in the water okay okay and when you leave from the water you are still in the other coat everything that you did on the altar everything that you did when brother stephen baptize you you still under looter amen do you follow me did i lose somebody another word when you come to christ and you accept jesus christ and you repent of your sin everybody care and you go to get baptized you have not got the holy ghost yet amen amen that's it hallelujah everybody okay you gotta move on and lift the bear and enter into the holy place i'm gonna probably touch the first and stop and you go home soak it hallelujah hallelujah brother adam said see when i see this and see that since a boy first time i ever crashed ever crash dealt with me i have still always taught those three stages of grace this is in 1964 after the seals if you look online when you go home that the whole sermon will pop up pretty good for you so you need it for reference notice if it's not true the first step is what you are the present altar and then follow after that is the water you wear the level everybody okay repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ in other words peter was saying brass altar and liver israel missed that god said brass until ever israel didn't understand after the day of pentecost people come and say it means you better repent and go to the water to be baptized anybody okay what a baptism baptized in the name of jesus christ what a baptism follows showing that repentance was water or to remit our past sin that has nothing to do with your future sin he only remit in other words remove it repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ what for remission taking away of passing has nothing to do with the future sin your sin has been chopped off what you did in other words when you coming to god you see the gate god put the gate out and remove the caribbeans so when you see the gate you look you say what are those beautiful colors it looks like scarlet and blue and you're approaching it it's god who puts the gate and he's watching you everybody here when you come to the gate you see the gate flipping and you see the brass altar when you get there you're coming as a sinner you did everything bad everybody you get to the altar you sit down and you sorrow for your sin you say father i am a sinner i have been drinking i have been cheating i have been committing adultery i have been lying to my parents i have been rebellious and everything now i want to give my heart to you nobody knows whether you are telling the truth or not only god everybody here nobody knows some are crying here they go out they do the same thing ever here nobody knows god say for me to see move to the level go baptized anybody okay when you get baptized brother branham is saying everything that you've done in the past is chop off it's taken off hold on the people suffering the message because of this anybody okay what is baptism the light filled you were unto even baptism does also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward water paul is peter is saying here that when you baptize you are not cleaning your body the baptism when you are approaching god at the present altar you feel guilty because you are committing fornication you are living with a boyfriend for three years you have been lying you have been cheating you have been smoking you have been doing all kind of stuff so when you approach god there is like a guiltiness in you like you feel like you are unworthy follow me very carefully if you miss this what is following i'm soaring higher than this everybody okay so you feel like you're guilty in other words this is the feeling that when you come to the church the message church at first you feel like you're dirty you look at everybody the long sister long dresses and you feel like you're the one with a short dress or you're the one with a tight dress you feel like uh these people are holy i am guilty that's what you feel that's what when you're coming to the brazen altar about here so when god opened the gospel and the gospel struck you like peter in the day of pentecost something pricked your heart everybody then you repent you repent means you are truly sorry of what you've done and you are taking a decision to change everybody okay you cannot repent chewing gum in this church we don't chew gum in the church i seen two people doing it and the holy ghost just brought it here stop chewing gum in the church get your gum put it in your pocket when you leave here put your gum back in your mouth everybody if you can't stay awake go stand over there you don't use chewing gum to keep you awake in the church everybody okay so that's why when you get to the altar everybody following me and you are crying the bible said godly sorrow bring if repentance you cannot fully repent if you don't really convicted you don't say brother i believe i need to do this and repent i don't know if i offend you but if i offend you i'm sorry that's not repentance there is a bunch of repentance in the message that are not repentance somebody doing something wrong to you and they just come and do you something good and they think they repent oh no let me take you to a dinner no we're good we are good with the brother we don't have any problem that is not repentance you must tell that brother that brother what we did to you was wrong we are sorry that we treated you that way forget about your lunch [Applause] forget about your lunch how can you be moody with a sister for three months and suddenly you are nice no you gotta stop and give an explanation why are you a moody dreamer because the sister is suffering maybe i did something wrong to sister i don't know did that do something wrong to him i don't know and suddenly you are good no you need to tell the sister assistant when you saw me moody i was going to trial in my life i was not mad against you because if you heard things about that brother and then you found out later that he was wrong and you already treated him bad based on what you heard you need to go corrected many people in this message including preachers need to repent [Applause] i told you i'm gonna rock your boat oh no we just seen it safe by grace no no no no no no no no god tell him i am the one who gossip about you i am sorry sister forgive me i know now the truth i won't do it again [Applause] this rapture is not a game you want to stay here playing games with god we lied to your parents go back and repent don't turn and be nice to mommy no no you know you flank that door right mommy go back and say mommy i'm sorry and don't say sorry as a duty sorry because you are convicted that the way i did was wrong [Music] i wish this whole church was here brother kelly we okay the temperature okay okay everybody okay so when you repent for your sin if you truly repent sincerely because if you don't repent by the problem say what happened is your soul get tired of reminding you and your soul get quiet and let you alone oh if i was doing something wrong why am i prospering the lord gave me a new job they don't give me this prosperity is not a sign that god is with you musician in the world are you following me they are not paying that they're prospering musicians in the world they don't go to church they're prospering but there is a different kind of prosperity i'm adjusting my lenses everybody okay everybody okay if you don't the holy ghost left you and then when you continue it will wake you up when you want to die that's when you're going to wake up like i'm lost because you were playing games but if your repentance is genuine do you follow me god will remove that guilt out of you that unworthiness leave you anybody follow me that clean conscience now your disposition toward god becomes clean do you follow me the answer to that clean conscience is what would take you to be baptized so when you are being baptized you are telling people that i have made peace with god in the altar my conscience is clean i made everything right the way i'm supposed to make right now me and god we don't have any problem i'm gonna stop somewhere because you need to go through this what am i trying to say when you go through that you follow me you get baptized peter is saying you're not taking a bath everybody baptism remove everything past that you did it take it away and chop it away but you are still there this is the dangerous ground you okay now let me click this and then you go home and filter through the week then we're going to come back again and push you more hard and work here brother branham say you can repent for what adam done you never done it adam did you just get forgiveness for what you have done the old nature is still let me help you up when you repented the altar which happened a lot to young people everybody god comes and take that guiltiness away from you do you follow me and now you get baptized but the bad nature follow me carefully that made you do everything bad is still in you everybody okay and everything you have just done you are only at the other court do you follow me do you follow me and the other court is under the light of the sky in other words the light of the zodiac or the light of the cosmos oh the light of the world anybody care so what it means when you are repent the black dog is still there do you follow me to prove to you that the black dog is still there you will see that the all the habit still tempts you but your conscience is clean do you follow me it is a stage you don't stay too long do you follow me you gotta move out quickly anybody because the black dog understood that you are taking him to kill him do you follow me the nature the bad nature that you have understood that now i'm approaching the fire but here the nature will begin to move back anybody okay if you stay in that stage longer [Music] do you follow me you will have a clean conscience playing the instrument in the church and sleeping with a woman at the hotel [Music] this is why people suffer in the message this is why 20 years in the message they are here they never move here tell me the first time that god spoke to you that you can come and say i was sitting and god spoke to me what which year was it you don't remember because you don't have it you are not in the inside court yet you are not here you are not here tell me when you sat down and you can say i was sitting and a voice spoke to me and then when he woke up i went i opened the door and i found exactly what the voice spoke to me when did that happen to you you are fooling yourself especially those that have gifts you can sing like a ninja no holy ghost [Applause] do you follow me you gotta tell your holy ghost you need to change me all we need to divorce do you follow what i'm saying there's light i'm going to stop here i cannot go any more further this light of the zodiac everybody here have a power on you if it rain you're going to get wet here because you are outside if it's snow you're gonna get cold because you are outside even though you are inside the tabernacle but you still outside in other words the outside still have an influence on you anybody here this is why you see people cannot get off politics 20 years in the message this is watch what you watching on the television watch the tick-tock you putting when i see that i know where you are [Music] because the black dog understand that i am getting ready to be kicked so it depends on the diet now the one you feed the most that's the one that getting the strength [Applause] everybody here everybody here this stage still have the demon cling to you do you follow me when they preach about high heels and you still wearing high heels after the world open up to you you need to wake up you are still here this is the stuff that drives you away from church that's why they have service they have a party you will find yourself going to the party versus going to the service [Applause] everything that they call fellowship or the brothers will meet over there that's where you go the spiritual things doesn't matter because your conscience is not guilty [Music] do you follow me do you follow me watch what you listening watch what you're watching watch what you putting on the posting there is a reason why brother kalima does it and you don't do it it is a stage that entertain the black dog it will it's a stage that always draw you to the world to the pleasure of the world let's go out let's go to the restaurant let's go uh uh uh uh in the game it's too boring we need to go gaming we need to and you'll see every saturday you always after game after game after meeting nothing click in your mind that let me sit at home and spend my time with the lord [Music] this stage you can sit three months without reading one message book and your conscience is clean this stage you can do two days you don't read your bible nothing condemns you you are here and the black dog loves it the black dog keeps pulling you ever care about here if you notice it happen in marriages if one spouse is here everybody here and the holy ghost is pulling him here and the second spurs is here this one have a tendency to pull the other one backward everybody here one wanna be in church on time they are the one come to church late he doesn't bother him you can tell him many times he say oh i'm sorry but he's not really getting it to the other one it really hurt him it's it's bothering me why am i in church late every day the other one is okay and what it causes is start fasting at home but here because they are the sparse is now where they're supposed to be they're down there and the other one is pushing to god over there and there is a wall about here one let's go to church one will say oh no let's go out they love more to go out and when they go out they take pictures and entertain the people on their facebook and their face media so they can see how they're having life they got in the store they want to show people the city all their mind is under the cosmos everything about your life you are just trying to entertain worldly stuff word list oh how to make money how to make money how to make money how to make money how to make money there is three months you have not been in church how to make money how to make money there is three weeks you have not been in church how to make money i need to read this book i need to follow this order how to make money how to make money it's a spirit that is right here last year how many sermons did you listen if you think i'm playing you will see me at the judgment seat without your blood if you feel i'm playing anybody here if you think i'm playing what is making you make details uh uh water paint uh uh what nails after we already preach about it what why why you can't get away from it because you are here [Music] you don't have the holy ghost here you don't have the power that can break those stuff yet but it doesn't condemn you because the clean conscience keeps you religious why after we preach about the the water the what's good you happen with a split that is showing this what is wrong why is that split not getting away from you the black dog is fighting his territory and he doesn't want you to move further that's why you hit people i don't want to marry spiritual brothers that's fun get a bad brother get a man that is worldly the sex that you think it's only few a few days after marriage after one month you get used to one another you're gonna see the real deal i'm sorry i gotta talk plan do you follow me do you follow me you're gonna get used together you're gonna wish you have married somebody that have the holy ghost [Music] you don't know how many times i've seen married people crying you don't know you don't know what they put on facebook is fake what you see people hugging on me and my husband that's nothing are you following me that's not that's why you did they show you a spiritual man you will see your eyes he's going to it another one no no he's too he's too he's too strict there is something that doesn't want you to go there maybe that's the husband that's gonna break you and help you up and pull you toward god but the black dog when when when jesus approaches a demon the demon knew from another person that this is jesus christ that's why this get you away oh no no no that's a two strict man that's the place you need to go but this one the old nature is still there watch your behavior how do you give god the preeminence in your life how many times do when they say we're going to church what does it mean to you oh no it's sunday we need to go to church you're here you hear because david said when they tell me to go in the house of god i am what but when they wake you up you like the reason why you do uh because you're here and you become a denomination because it took longer and you never move from that state but here watch your friend how many christian friends do you have how can you be one message believer you have 10 friends and none of them are worldly because you're distinct here no no they're not bad people they're just clean people even better than some of the message believer [Music] he's a nice man he doesn't cast we just friend there is something here that draw you to that friend you can look at somebody singing with tight dresses and cutting pants like this you don't see anything wrong and you have enough gut to even post it so people can see because you taken up with the song but you don't see the outside the reason why you are blended to the outside is because you are here you don't believe in women wearing paint why do you post a woman wearing paint saying speaking about jesus christ the reason why you are blinded because you are right here what motivates you what touches you do you go the whole day and something struck you like i didn't read my bible oh you are reading off the bible is like you hit the ground oh there is a bible that i'm supposed to read or when you wake up something tells you read your bible where is that thing that people speak but i don't hear the reason why is your cosmos so everything that goes in the world in the politics in the drinking in the in the musician all the new words oh the drip that this you know you are all up to dated with all of that but your conscience is clean the reason because you want to go to university and look cool it is this this is this state here the one who's here doesn't play gamer but here this state you can watch pornography and you come out and you pray and you come out like nothing you can sleep with a man you can sleep with a woman and you come up like lord forgive me for what i did and then tomorrow you find in church not even seeing the seriousness of their sex act that you have done there the reason why you're not guilty and you keep doing that years after years because you are still stuck right here those people talk to their children we are already grown up you need to preach to them the one that says that themselves look at the mother look at the mother themselves we attack the children look at the parent your children tight is higher than your tithe i have a report why why what are you doing what is motivating you what party do you go why is you sitting on the party and women are dancing in a in a bad way and you dare and you are laughing somebody will stand up and say god bless you i believe i came to your identity with reception it is my time to go home okay thank you very much congratulations for your wedding and he goes out because that environment is bordering somebody's heart but you you stay there and you want to even go over time what keeps you in that path in that place what light are you living under let me stop here this is the beginning i'm gonna rock your boat are you there sitting at home watching movie watching movie the first time people kiss you good good until kissing is nothing until the next movie they show a little bit of breast the next movie they show a naked person oh no i'm married that's nothing to me there is something that is feeding you to movie all the time it is this state here because the old nature is still there let's bow ahead heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father this is the hour of deliverance your children all over the message has been stuck for years and most are like the rich young ruler where the religion was a law they grew up in the home when they told them that you should dress with a long skirt they grew up in their home where they taught them how to talk how to dress but the nature have never been out they don't drink they don't smoke some never even touch marijuana some never even been in a nightclub they only watch it in a movie and father they don't even know which state they are and they think by staying too long they have the holy ghost and after a while they're going up and down and finally realizing like the rich young ruler that what lacquer yet after everything that i have done after all the youth meeting i have been after all the convention i have been after all the preacher i'm listening in the message after all the anointing i've i cried that's a jump i fell down on the floor still i'm not where i'm supposed to be still when i listen to brother branham it seems like i'm far away from what really this message is portraying people to be father i know the black dog is fighting back i know what kind of war i go through when i go through this kind of sermon father the people don't understand that it's out of love that we're going through all this kind of stuff some are caught up into a carnal mind they're looking at me as a man some are looking at me and saying he already got a lot of money that's why he's saying what he's saying some are looking and they say he doesn't understand what we're going through some are looking at us as oh we were together with him he used to be a deacon oh he's that old deacon that we have they don't understand further the transition that we're going through because the blood is sooner gonna leave the altar and father your children have been trapped for years under stubborn spirit how can you have a stubborn spirit towards your parents and still that clean conscience telling them they are right they have the holy ghost some are arrogant some don't see they don't want to listen to anybody their way is that way some are dominating for years until the holy spirit have no room to work but because of the cleanness of that conscience they don't have any guiltiness to realize what they're doing is wrong they can get in the midst of a congregation where everybody's dressed right they are the only one with split tail and they are calm they are the only one with high heel and they are calm they are the only one wearing makeup and they are calm and they are the only one having long nails and they are calm they are the only one having crazy haircut but their conscience is good it doesn't bother you and most of the time when you talk to them they say i didn't see anything bad on that i didn't see anything bad on that what is portraying what is pushing you where you are father it takes the holy spirit may you be merciful to this congregation may father you give them grace to understand that the place of justification is a deadly ground lord i commit everything unto the hand i have done what i can do but i know i have a great shepherd that is watching over the sheep lord may you give sufficient grace to help your children wake up wake up from the sleepiness to help the mothers wake up and don't put the responsibility on the preachers only to work each one of us to take responsibility of our families of our children of her husband of our wife of our holy daily devotion father to be right with you lord i thank you and commit them unto the hand may you work on this congregation and may you change them and bring them closer to you lord and father bring them into the holy of holies so that the message can no longer be a burden no longer be a religion but the message will be a life that they will be enjoying and no matter what is going outside the one that is in the innerval don't care because he's not even affected father we humbly ask it and we commit them unto the hand in jesus precious name keep your hand teach your keep your head bow down i was praying for somebody yes okay so [Music] [Music] do [Music]
