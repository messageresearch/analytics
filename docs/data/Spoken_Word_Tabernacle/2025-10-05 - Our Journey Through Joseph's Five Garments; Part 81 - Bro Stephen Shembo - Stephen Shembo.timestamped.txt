[0:00] woman was the one that was changed over
[0:03] for the perversion.
[0:06] That's right. See where the beauty takes
[0:08] her to.
[0:09] Now, that's why that today we find that
[0:14] women is on the increase of beauty. You
[0:18] take Pearl Brian. You ever see her
[0:20] picture supposed to be America's great
[0:22] beauty? There isn't a school kid out of
[0:24] any school, but what would have her in a
[0:25] a back row? Did you know it's supposed
[0:29] to be that way?
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Did you know the Bible speaks that
[0:32] that's the way it's going to be?
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know the fall came by women at
[0:36] the beginning and fall the end is going
[0:39] to wind up the same way.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Women coming into authority and ruling
[0:43] over man and so forth. You know the
[0:45] scripture says that
[0:47] &gt;&gt; you know the day that she puts on man's
[0:49] clothes and bobs their hair.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; All those things are contrary to God's
[0:53] word. And
[0:55] &gt;&gt; you know she represents the church. when
[0:58] you watch what women are doing and
[0:59] you'll see what the church is doing.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Now, now that's just as true as the word
[1:08] of God is true. No other female
[1:12] is made that can stoop like a woman can.
[1:16] And yet
[1:18] through that being made an off she was
[1:21] not in the original creation.
[1:24] All other females is in the original
[1:26] creation.

[16:11] We thank you, Lord. We thank you,
[16:12] Father. Lord, we ask a special anointing
[16:15] this morning on our congregation, Lord
[16:18] God. That as the word comes forth, Lord,
[16:20] may you come down and vindicate it,
[16:22] Lord, with your presence, Lord. Make
[16:24] yourself known this morning, Lord God.
[16:26] We know you're here, Lord. You've
[16:28] promised to meet us here every time that
[16:30] we gather, Lord God. And we're not going
[16:33] to doubt that one bit, Lord God. We give
[16:36] ask for travel mercy, Lord, on those
[16:38] that are still on the way, Lord God.
[16:40] Bless our musicians, Lord. Give them a
[16:42] special anointing as well this morning,
[16:44] Lord God. And our singers, Lord God.
[16:48] Bless our technicians as well, Lord God.
[16:51] We thank you for the diligence, Lord,
[16:53] about making everything just come out
[16:56] right. Lord, here and on the stream,
[16:58] Lord God. Bless our deacons, Lord. We
[17:01] pray for our deacons constantly, Lord.
[17:04] That they follow your leadership, Lord,
[17:06] and that they're yielded to your spirit,
[17:08] Lord. We thank you, Father, for our
[17:11] deacons, Lord, and for the anointing
[17:12] that you've put on them, Lord God. And
[17:15] we just ask that you bless them this
[17:16] morning, Lord God. Bless our trustee,
[17:19] Lord, and our treasurer, Lord, and our
[17:22] pastor, Lord God. We we want to, Lord,
[17:26] just pray to guard the gift, Lord, that
[17:28] you've sent to us, Lord God, through
[17:31] this man, Lord God. For we know that
[17:33] when he stands behind this pulpit, it's
[17:35] not him that is speaking, Lord God, but
[17:37] we are hearing from the throne each
[17:40] time, Lord God. So grant it, Lord, that
[17:43] you would just touch him this morning,
[17:44] Lord. Bless the word that will come
[17:47] forth, Lord. Let it come forth as you've
[17:49] planned, Lord God. And let it sink deep
[17:52] into our hearts this morning, Lord God,
[17:54] that we can truly say, Lord, that our
[17:56] hearts burned along the way this
[17:58] morning, Lord God. We thank you for this
[18:00] congregation, Lord. We thank you for
[18:02] this church, Lord. We thank you for the
[18:04] being the lighthouse and the beacon,
[18:06] Lord, that you've made us, Lord God. And
[18:09] we just ask, Lord God, that you just
[18:12] just come, Lord, and just anoint each
[18:14] one of us for our duties this morning,
[18:16] Lord God. Because it's not a duty so
[18:18] much as is a pleasure to serve you, Lord
[18:20] Jesus, for all the things that you've
[18:23] done for us, Lord God. It's just nothing
[18:25] less than a pleasure to sacrifice
[18:28] ourselves to you, Lord God, and just to
[18:30] give up the life that we might have
[18:32] thought we wanted, Lord Jesus,
[18:35] to serve you, Lord God. Help us, Lord.
[18:38] If anyone is struggling this morning,
[18:39] Lord God, we ask you bless them, Lord.
[18:43] We give you thanks, Father, for
[18:45] everything that you do in the precious
[18:48] name of Jesus Christ. We thank you,
[18:51] Father. Amen and amen. Praise God.
[18:55] Praise God. Let's give him a clap
[18:56] offering. Turn around and greet your
[18:59] neighbor this morning. Amen. And we're
[19:02] going to sing a few songs. Hallelujah.
[19:07] We thank the Lord for being here this
[19:09] morning. Amen.

[32:37] ask her to do this, but her hand is
[32:40] fine. There's hard a scar. There's no
[32:44] scar.
[32:51] I was in shock. I was like, "Let me see
[32:53] your hand." This was the next day. It
[32:55] looked like that.
[32:58] She picked up a 400 degree pot with no
[33:02] with no handles
[33:05] and there's no scar.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; The skin's all there. Woo.

[33:16] So, I do have one prayer request this
[33:18] morning from um this is from um Sister
[33:20] Georgia.
[33:22] Uh special prayer for my supervisor's
[33:25] 16-year-old daughter Jada.
[33:29] Uh she says she's been admitted to a
[33:31] mental institution.
[33:34] So, that's not good.
[33:37] So, God has given us a sound mind.
[33:40] daily. Amen. Which we need to thank him
[33:43] for every day. Um

[33:56] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say how good God is
[34:10] to me. You know, our pastors preach two
[34:13] message back to back. You know, he
[34:15] talked last week about Psalms 23,
[34:19] you know, and I want to thank God. And
[34:21] then he preach then he preach a message
[34:23] in the midst of chaos.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of the chaos, sometime
[34:27] we don't see how blessed we are. And I
[34:29] just want to say I'm so so so blessed.
[34:33] This week God sent four and you know
[34:36] four is deliverance and I want to thank
[34:38] God for the four God in flesh that came
[34:41] by me in the midst of the chaos and I'm
[34:44] standing here to say I'm one spoiled
[34:47] wife of Jesus Christ and I want to thank
[34:49] him for it.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[35:03] Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; He's good to us.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Charles, do you mind
[35:12] praying over this prayer request? Yes,
[35:14] ma'am. If we also we want to acknowledge
[35:17] unspoken when we get there. Amen.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; If you could just keep my husband in
[35:23] prayer as he travels for work this week
[35:25] that the Lord gets him there safe and
[35:27] brings him back home. We were reading
[35:29] online that a airplane left from
[35:32] Charlotte to LaGuardia and had a
[35:35] collision. But we know that the angel of
[35:37] the Lord goes with him. So just keep him
[35:39] in prayer.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Brother Charles.
[35:51] Amen. Let us pray. Family. Lord Jesus,
[35:54] we thank you Lord God for being able
[35:56] Lord to stand in the gap for one
[35:57] another. Lord God, and Father, when you
[36:00] shed your blood on that cross, Lord God,
[36:02] it was for the whole world, Lord God.
[36:04] And Lord, the blood being shed, heavenly
[36:06] father, didn't only, Lord God, bring our
[36:09] deliverance from sin, Lord God, but it
[36:11] granted our healing, Lord Jesus. And
[36:13] Father, I pray, Lord God, by your grace
[36:15] and mercy, Lord, that you go out,
[36:17] heavenly father, on the spirit of a
[36:19] dove, Lord God, go touch the mind, Lord,
[36:22] of this 16year-old child, Lord God.
[36:24] Father, your prophet said it would be a
[36:26] neurotic age, heavenly father. But Lord,
[36:28] you said, Father, in your word, Father,
[36:30] that you grant us peace that passes all
[36:31] understanding, Lord God. And Father, I
[36:34] pray, heavenly father, for mercy. I pray
[36:36] for grace, heavenly father. I pray for
[36:38] complete and total deliverance, heavenly
[36:40] father, that when we hear the testimony,
[36:42] what God has done, what you have done,
[36:44] heavenly father, proving that you are
[36:45] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[36:48] heavenly father. Lord God, this is a
[36:50] perfect opportunity, Lord God, for you
[36:52] to prepare the table, Lord God, of this
[36:54] in the presence of that enemy, Lord God,
[36:56] that is troubling that child. What is
[36:58] troubling the child is troubling a
[36:59] family, Lord God. And I pray, heavenly
[37:01] father, Lord, that you pull a wool over
[37:03] Satan's eyes, Lord God, and bring a
[37:05] great and mighty deliverance, Lord
[37:06] Jesus. Father, we pray Lord God for all
[37:08] the unspoken requests, Lord, the things
[37:10] that are hiding in your people's heart,
[37:12] Lord Jesus. Father, that you answer it,
[37:14] heavenly father, Lord, as you use your
[37:16] servant, Lord God, to preach the word,
[37:18] Father, Lord God, anoint them, heavenly
[37:19] father, to answer the request of your
[37:21] people, Father, if that be your will,
[37:23] heavenly father, for we know, Lord, when
[37:24] you speak from behind the sacred desk,
[37:26] Father, it is the greatest blessing that
[37:28] we could ever have, Father, for it is
[37:29] the Lord God himself speaking directly
[37:31] to our situation, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[37:34] give you thanks, heavenly father. We
[37:35] commit the remainder of this service
[37:36] into thy hands, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[37:39] pray, Lord, that you remember the tithes
[37:40] and the offerings, Lord God, and use
[37:42] them for the furtherance of your
[37:43] kingdom, Lord God. We see you're doing
[37:45] the supernatural work, Father, and the
[37:47] erection, Lord God, of the fellowship
[37:49] hall, Lord, in the addition to the
[37:50] building, Lord God. We pray, Lord God,
[37:52] for a total restoration of all things,
[37:54] Father, because before the foundation of
[37:56] the world, Lord God, you saw it,
[37:58] heavenly father. We're just trying to
[37:59] step into the vision, Lord God, of what
[38:01] you prepared, Lord God. Help us to touch
[38:03] and agree with our pastor, Lord God.
[38:05] Lord, this is true work of the third
[38:07] pole, the creative power of God, Lord
[38:09] God, anointed him, Lord God. All we need
[38:11] to do, Lord God, is follow the shepherd,

[57:44] &gt;&gt; Our church ages, 70 weeks of Daniel, the

[57:54] &gt;&gt; Lord's willing, this oncoming Saturday,

[58:04] What is this Q&A? So I figure out his
[58:06] question and answer. Amen. So our
[58:08] question and answer will be on October
[58:10] the 11th. Same place. You know where it
[58:12] is. But the information should be put on
[58:14] the deacon chat. So Lord's willing on
[58:17] Wednesday is the the the last question
[58:20] before I pick it up. So don't send
[58:22] question on Thursday or Friday because
[58:24] I'm already working on something. Amen.
[58:26] And the youngsman meeting will follow on
[58:29] October the 25th part three of the
[58:31] courtship. And Lord's willing, the
[58:33] married couple meeting will be on
[58:36] December the 13th where we get on to
[58:38] finances
[58:40] uh part two, but it's going to be part
[58:42] eight for the married couple meeting.
[58:44] Amen. Um how was the church prayer on
[58:47] Tuesday?
[58:48] [Applause]
[58:56] those that were not there just
[58:58] understand by God's grace we will see as
[59:01] the time move on if we need need to put
[59:04] another day that will have other people
[59:07] also so if you miss the one on Tuesday
[59:09] you have the one on uh on uh uh let me
[59:13] keep the date on X day and then we see
[59:16] what we can do amen but Lord's willing I
[59:20] don't think one hour worked because we
[59:22] went beyond one hour. We were like an
[59:24] hour and 30 minutes and at the last
[59:27] minute I have to put all the prayer
[59:29] requests together. Normally we should
[59:31] have read the prayer request and pray
[59:33] for it. Read and pray for it. So just
[59:36] the what I'm trying to say is open up
[59:38] for two hours.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So open up for two hours. If we go
[59:46] two hour just be prepared for it. No
[59:49] problem. Just know it's two hours. Amen.
[59:51] Glory to God. So again, the last request
[59:54] is taken on Tuesday at 5:00. Then uh at
[59:58] 6:45 we open up the zoom and we start
[1:00:02] again. The zoom will be sent. Usually
[1:00:04] sister Adasa put the zoom by uh uh by
[1:00:07] today the zoom is already up and waiting
[1:00:09] for you for Tuesday. So as soon as we
[1:00:11] receive it, we go ahead and send it and
[1:00:13] we move on. We even have some of the
[1:00:15] invisible audience first times to to see
[1:00:18] them. So now I know who is who who's
[1:00:20] putting some amen. God bless you and
[1:00:23] welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. Amen.
[1:00:26] I spoke uh u I communicated with the
[1:00:30] deacon and also the song leader. I
[1:00:32] believe you already noticed it this
[1:00:34] morning when brother John came up. He
[1:00:36] gave you time to pray as a congregation
[1:00:39] first before he uh he closes and start
[1:00:43] the song service. So make sure you there
[1:00:45] when the song service started on time
[1:00:47] because uh before we start the song
[1:00:49] service we will give you few minute to
[1:00:52] go ahead and pray as a congregation. We
[1:00:54] believe you prayed already at home.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So when you get here we pray a little
[1:00:58] bit as a congregation. Pray for the
[1:01:00] service then brother John closes and we
[1:01:02] start. Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; The building you already uh uh heard the
[1:01:08] the the instruction about it. Just try
[1:01:11] to stay away from the metal that they're
[1:01:14] placing there. It's razor sharp, so we
[1:01:16] don't want any problem. Brother Robert
[1:01:18] already put a tape there. When you see
[1:01:20] the tape, watch it, but don't touch it.
[1:01:23] Are we together? You can watch it, but
[1:01:26] don't touch it until they close
[1:01:28] everything. Amen. You keep playing, but
[1:01:30] I mean praying for us because the
[1:01:32] Abraham Lincoln is already there and
[1:01:34] we're doing work. So, I'm catching up on
[1:01:36] bills. I'm behind bills and catching up
[1:01:39] by God's grace when we we we are
[1:01:41] bringing things low then we got to
[1:01:44] purchase new new new material and then
[1:01:47] we go back. So it's like up and down up
[1:01:49] and down but slowly and gradually we are
[1:01:52] moving on before you know it everything
[1:01:55] will be done. So stay in prayer and also
[1:01:58] remember your contribution. Sister Adasa
[1:02:00] worked very hard on this.
[1:02:02] Congratulations sister Adasa. So
[1:02:11] as a pastor, let me put this together.
[1:02:14] The technician work together good
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; by God's grace. But uh those that are
[1:02:22] online, if you go on the YouTube channel
[1:02:26] for spoken word, when you open the
[1:02:29] channel on YouTube, there is an option
[1:02:30] that says view channel. If you click
[1:02:34] that option, it will give you another
[1:02:36] option that says more. If you click
[1:02:39] more, every single link is there. If you
[1:02:42] need our website link, the contribution
[1:02:45] link for the t for the building fund for
[1:02:47] everything has been laying there. So you
[1:02:50] don't have to ask how to send money or
[1:02:52] whatever you want to do. It's already on
[1:02:54] YouTube channel. So everything if you
[1:02:56] click the link automatically take you to
[1:02:58] the website or take you to whatever
[1:03:00] contribution you want to do, it's there.
[1:03:02] Again, I'm going to repeat it again.
[1:03:03] View channel. When you click view
[1:03:05] channel, click more. Everything will
[1:03:08] appear. So now we believe that we solve
[1:03:11] everything that supposed to be done
[1:03:13] online. Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; I believe I got everything clear. Young
[1:03:17] sisters, if you have any other subject,
[1:03:19] just uh send me a message or the deacon
[1:03:22] and let's sit again and let's talk. But
[1:03:24] it looks like there's no more subject to
[1:03:26] go. God bless you. I don't remember your
[1:03:29] name again.
[1:03:30] What her name again?
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:03:34] go ahead and stand up so we can welcome
[1:03:35] you.
[1:03:38] Praise God.

[1:04:17] and three quote, one sermon. Three
[1:04:19] court, one sermon. Three court, one
[1:04:21] sermon. If not, so do you promise?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Uh, some of you are not that they don't
[1:04:27] want to say anything.
[1:04:31] Do you promise you're going to give me
[1:04:33] time
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; so we can reach where we need to reach
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; and then he will prepare next Sunday.
[1:04:40] Right?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Because I keep pushing sermon. I keep
[1:04:43] pushing sermon and we are way way down
[1:04:46] in in uh uh I mean a pify basement over
[1:04:49] there. We need to come back because
[1:04:51] everything that we are talking now
[1:04:55] so it help you to understand where we
[1:04:57] are. We we are under the blood upon the
[1:05:00] altar.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Do you remember that?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The blood was put on the on the curtain
[1:05:07] and then the blood was put on the altar.
[1:05:09] So all of this is under the altar.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; So we need to come out from there and
[1:05:14] get the blood below
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; that goes into the ground. Then when we
[1:05:18] finish that then we pick up again to the
[1:05:20] prodigal son.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And do you see now where we are? And
[1:05:24] then we come up from the prodigal son
[1:05:25] and go back to to the I mean the
[1:05:28] podifar. Then we resurface again and
[1:05:31] then we take we change the garment. You
[1:05:34] are already on part 81.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm doing this so I can open
[1:05:44] somebody that Okay.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And the year is about to finish.
[1:05:52] Amen.
[1:05:54] Flight attend and prepare for takeoff.
[1:05:57] My subject this morning is our journey,
[1:06:01] our life journey through Joseph 5
[1:06:04] garment part 81. Let's go to Genesis 15.
[1:06:11] Genesis 15. Part 81.
[1:06:15] Unbelievable. So if you behind, you on
[1:06:18] the 40s. Good luck.
[1:06:21] You have to take three weeks vacation
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; to follow up. Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; So stay there so we can move on. If you
[1:06:30] dare, you can say amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and pray. Heavenly
[1:06:34] Father, Lord, we are approaching you
[1:06:37] humbly this morning. Father, thanking
[1:06:40] you for your grace, your love, your
[1:06:42] mercy, and for everything you have been
[1:06:44] doing for us, Lord. Father Lord, this is
[1:06:47] as as as far as I can go with the
[1:06:49] ability you have given me. But when it
[1:06:52] comes to speaking to your brother and
[1:06:53] ministering to your children, Father, we
[1:06:56] are totally insufficient. It takes the
[1:06:58] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:01] to come to Lord reveal your word to
[1:07:04] speak to teach to preach to touch to
[1:07:06] heal to fill and to do everything in our
[1:07:09] lives Lord. Father that's why we are
[1:07:11] inviting you once again Lord Father that
[1:07:13] you can come and move us and the
[1:07:15] audience visible and invisible
[1:07:17] completely out of the way. May you speak
[1:07:19] to us all. May you be the alpha and the
[1:07:22] omega. Lord father anoint us like never
[1:07:25] before in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Our life journey through Joseph's five
[1:07:33] garment part 81. Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Genesis 15. If you dare, you can say
[1:07:40] amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; My theme this morning, if we can make it
[1:07:48] there,
[1:07:50] is
[1:07:51] season.
[1:08:00] Let me read it. Well, so I make sure we
[1:08:02] get it. It's season hidden.
[1:08:13] hidden in darkness.
[1:08:20] Season that are hidden in darkness.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Genesis 15. Let's go to verse seven. If
[1:08:31] you there, you can say amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to try to stay on the
[1:08:35] surface with this scripture because this
[1:08:37] is very deep and it can open up a
[1:08:40] series. So I'm not going to touch it. I
[1:08:42] know what is here. I know what brother
[1:08:44] Brandham say. Brother Brandham usually
[1:08:45] give you a clue. And if you take the
[1:08:47] clue of brother Brandham, he open up 25
[1:08:50] messages. One clue of brother Brandham
[1:08:52] 25 message. If you touch the second one,
[1:08:54] 25 message. Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Because of the power of the seals.
[1:09:00] Seven. And he says unto him, this is God
[1:09:03] talking to Abraham. He says,"I am the
[1:09:06] Lord that brought you out of earth of
[1:09:10] the Caldes to give you this land to
[1:09:14] inherit it." You may be seated.
[1:09:17] And he said, "Lord, keep your seat belt,
[1:09:19] we will take off." And he said, "Lord
[1:09:22] God, whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:09:25] inherit this?" In other words, God is
[1:09:28] telling Abraham, I'm going to give you
[1:09:30] this. And Abraham say, you know what? I
[1:09:33] need an assurance. Give me something
[1:09:36] like Rahab. Hey, give me a true token.
[1:09:40] Amen. I heard your word. I believe your
[1:09:42] word. But how how will I know that
[1:09:45] really truly you will be giving me this?
[1:09:49] Stay in put because the devil won't let
[1:09:50] you get this. Amen. He says verse 8 and
[1:09:55] and he said Lord God whereby shall I
[1:09:59] know that I shall inherit it? Amen. How
[1:10:04] do I know? Job to verse 12. If you there
[1:10:07] you can say amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I skip all of this because there is many
[1:10:12] shadow many messages locked in. So
[1:10:14] that's why I'm skipping this because if
[1:10:16] you you read it all the three years of
[1:10:20] he all of that have meaning. So let's
[1:10:23] stay on where we are going. Verse 12.
[1:10:26] And when the son in other words Abraham
[1:10:28] took the sacrifice and put it if you
[1:10:30] read your Bible and he cut the sacrifice
[1:10:33] in two except the the dove
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; the bird were put aside because that
[1:10:38] represent divine healing. I'm trying to
[1:10:40] stay away from it. Don't ask me question
[1:10:42] now. We will get into something else.
[1:10:44] The bird represented divine healing. But
[1:10:46] Abraham took the sacrifice and Abraham
[1:10:49] split the sacrifice in two.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; And Abraham was there and was chasing
[1:10:53] the bird from the morning all the way so
[1:10:56] that no bird fell on the sacrifice.
[1:10:58] Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Because God gave him instruction. Take
[1:11:01] the sacrifice, split them in two. It's a
[1:11:03] covenant.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And normally when you make a covenant,
[1:11:06] it's two people.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brown, I'm explaining
[1:11:08] about the the the China laundry man
[1:11:11] where they would take I mean I mean a
[1:11:14] paper and then they split it in two and
[1:11:16] then you take one part and we take
[1:11:18] another part. So when you come to get
[1:11:20] your clothing they will try to match. If
[1:11:22] everything match that's your clothing.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; So that's what Abraham is doing here. He
[1:11:26] split everything. Put there put there.
[1:11:29] So normally God should be on one side.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Then Abraham should be on the other
[1:11:35] side. But that's not the case.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That's not the case. So now Abraham is
[1:11:43] there chasing flies so they don't come
[1:11:45] and eat his sacrifice.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says now in verse 12, "And
[1:11:50] when the sun was going down, in other
[1:11:52] word on the sunset,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together."
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Not on the sunrise.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; from the morning he was just chasing
[1:12:01] sacrifice. But when the sun was going
[1:12:04] down and the sun set,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; we clear.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; That's when things begin to happen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; On the sunset,
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; when the day was wide,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; the sun was up.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Nothing happened. Abraham has to just
[1:12:23] chase bird.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; But when the sun begin to go down
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and darkness begin to come. Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Relax, relax.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The sun
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; was going out.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; The sun was going down.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; So this is the sunset.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And darkness begin to come in because as
[1:12:55] the sun is going down, the darkness is
[1:12:58] coming out. In other words, this is the
[1:13:00] evening time.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; If you don't read your message, you'll
[1:13:07] be in trouble.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; This is the evening time.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And you going very slow. I got two quote
[1:13:13] that the Holy Spirit gave me there. So,
[1:13:15] I need to read the day now. I have to
[1:13:17] read it from my phone. So, let's move
[1:13:19] on. Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And when the sun was going
[1:13:23] down,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; a deep sleep.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:28] fell upon Abraham.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Normally like I said Abraham Abraham
[1:13:36] should be on one side and God should be
[1:13:38] on another side and they are making
[1:13:40] covenant.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Now when it comes the time that the
[1:13:44] covenant need to be made
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; because throughout the day there were no
[1:13:48] covenant. Abraham cut the sacrifice put
[1:13:51] one here put one there and he was
[1:13:53] waiting for God.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; In the morning there is no God.
[1:13:58] Good job, my friend. And noon, no God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; 300 p.m. No God.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Abraham is watching his clock.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And then the bird keep coming trying to
[1:14:09] get some steak.
[1:14:11] And then Abraham is keep say where is
[1:14:13] God? Where is God? Where is God? Then
[1:14:16] suddenly in the evening time
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; when the sun
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; when the sun begin to go down.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; My brother who was working so strong
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; waiting on God
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; fell asleep
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; and not just asleep.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; A deep one.
[1:14:44] I'm doing this so I'm helping you to
[1:14:46] catch up whoever he's thinking
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; a deep sleep.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; So how is he going to get into a
[1:14:52] covenant
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; sleeping?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; If you want to understand this per
[1:14:58] perfectly me and brother Angela here we
[1:15:01] need to make a deal.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; There is a paper
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I have to sign. Brother Angelo have to
[1:15:07] sign for the contract to be valid. Now
[1:15:10] when it comes time to son, brother Angel
[1:15:13] is sleeping.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So now how am I going to sound?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; We need to wake him up.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; But this sleep is different.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; It's not a sleep that you push somebody
[1:15:27] and they wake up quickly. It was a deep
[1:15:30] one.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; So my brother got some anesthesia. Very
[1:15:33] good.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is the party that need to be
[1:15:42] involved in the contract be put to a
[1:15:44] deep sleep?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; We together.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the reason why it
[1:15:52] happened to Abraham. If you need coach,
[1:15:54] see me after church.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say God want to take
[1:15:58] Abraham out of the picture.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. Brother Brandham say
[1:16:07] because every contract God have with
[1:16:12] man,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; man always fell.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And then when he started with Abraham,
[1:16:21] the father of our faith,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; God said, "Now Abraham, I'm going to
[1:16:25] start something different.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; And I don't need your input.
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to tell me what to do.
[1:16:36] I don't even want you to get there
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; because if I put you on the covenant,
[1:16:41] the devil will attack you.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be the only one in the
[1:16:47] covenant.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; In other word, in both part, it is God.
[1:16:53] [Applause]
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; In other word, if you go on this side,
[1:17:01] this is the side of God. You look at
[1:17:04] signature it is God who son.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; If you go back to sister Tasad,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; you say who son here?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Sister Ca say oh our son. But you look
[1:17:15] it's not sister Ta.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It is God who son for sister T.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And God does not change
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; and God will never fail.
[1:17:30] In other words, it's a covenant where
[1:17:32] only God and God can do.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say God took
[1:17:44] Abraham out of the picture.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; He said because Adam fell.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I have the quote my friend.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And God say you know what Adam fell I
[1:17:55] don't want to take any more chances now.
[1:17:57] And brother Brandham say it was an
[1:18:00] unconditional
[1:18:03] [Applause]
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; in other word it has nothing to do with
[1:18:07] you.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say what God was
[1:18:10] showing was Abraham you have nothing to
[1:18:13] do in this.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; In other words this contract will never
[1:18:20] fair
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; because it's not a human contract.
[1:18:25] It is a divine contract.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; It is a contract that is based on deity
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; and deity never fail.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are doomed to
[1:18:38] succeed.
[1:18:42] [Applause]
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. In other words,
[1:18:46] we are doomed to make it.
[1:18:49] No matter what's going to happen there
[1:18:52] because it's not you to keep the
[1:18:54] contract. It's the one who son that need
[1:18:58] to keep the contract. It is the one
[1:19:00] whose son that need to keep their word.
[1:19:04] And God and his word are one.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say heaven and earth will
[1:19:09] pass away but the word
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; never pass away.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, your life is not your
[1:19:17] own.
[1:19:25] I don't know if we together.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; you didn't sign for it.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, even if you come today
[1:19:37] and you say, "I'm leaving the message."
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to hell.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I need to know who sign your paper.
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:47] If you sign it, that's fine.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But if God sign it,
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; you won't go nowhere,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I will see you coming back right here.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Because it's God who has to keep the
[1:20:03] contract.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Okay. Since I'm
[1:20:11] leaving, I just took off. Let me take my
[1:20:13] jacket. Keep your seat belt as I coming.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; All of this is happening
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; when the sun begin to go.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Abraham is sleeping.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Abraham, where are you at? You need to
[1:20:44] sign the contract.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; You need to sign the contract. I'm
[1:20:48] sorry. I work too much.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; So, who's going to sign the contract
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; on behalf of Abraham?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; But we know that Abraham was in God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Let me leave it my friend. We are way.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And when the sun was going down, a what?
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; A deep sleep
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; did what?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Fell upon Abraham.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And lo, a what?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; In horror.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; You know what that is?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Spooky.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Halloween.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; We not We don't We don't celebrate
[1:21:33] Halloween, but Halloween is coming.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; A horror of a what? Great darkness fell
[1:21:40] upon him.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Not not darkness.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; What type of darkness?
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Great darkness.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; The sleep was deep.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; The darkness that came there was not
[1:21:50] just darkness.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother,
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; I don't understand this.
[1:21:57] God, I I asked God, what shows me you
[1:22:01] will give me what you say?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And God say, take a sacrifice. It's
[1:22:07] right here. I just keep it cuted and put
[1:22:09] a sacrifice to offer for me.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I did offer the sacrifice.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Now instead of the sacrifice bringing
[1:22:16] God
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; the sacrifice is bringing horror.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's bringing deep sleep.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; It's bringing even great darkness.
[1:22:34] So this sacrifice is bringing horror,
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; horror, great darkness.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; In other word, I was expecting God to
[1:22:45] come as a mighty angel and light shining
[1:22:49] around and say, "I am the God of
[1:22:52] Abraham."
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Suddenly,
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; darkness
[1:22:59] But God
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; dead bodies of animal
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; with darkness
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; and you telling me this is the
[1:23:11] confirmation.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said this great darkness
[1:23:23] and aura was hell.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I have the quote.
[1:23:28] Ah,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; come on man. Come on. Come on my friend.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say this is hell.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So it looks like what is going to happen
[1:23:37] in the evening time
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; is pulling hell.
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hell on Jessie Penny.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Uh do you read your message?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Do you read your message?
[1:23:58] Go read souls that are in prison now.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; In the evening time, it looks like hell
[1:24:06] broke loose.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And not just hell, great darkness.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; All of this
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; because God Abraham asked, he say,
[1:24:17] "Vindicate,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; vindicate to me that you will give it to
[1:24:22] me.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Hell is broke loose.
[1:24:30] Okay, let's continue. Where are we at,
[1:24:32] my friend?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. You are reading very slow, my
[1:24:35] friend.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; We should be finishing this. Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. And he says to Abraham.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Now God come and spoke in the midst of
[1:24:45] hell.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Darkness.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; There is no light here.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; It's darkness. And then God speak
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; in the midst of darkness.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; What is God speaking?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; The the Bible didn't say and light came
[1:25:02] all over them.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; No, darkness came and God begin to speak
[1:25:08] when it's dark.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Which brother Brandham say when hell
[1:25:12] came down,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; God begin to speak. What is God saying?
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 13.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And he says to who?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:25:23] No of shortity, in other words, for sure
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; that your seed shall be what?
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; A stranger
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; in the land that is not water.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So God begin to break things to Abraham.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That hey, your children will go
[1:25:42] somewhere else.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; How will they get there? It is stuff in
[1:25:49] between.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because a mystery always
[1:25:52] got a supernatural element.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; If he say Joseph, the devil will kill
[1:25:56] Joseph.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; But Joseph is hidden right there.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Because it was Joseph that took them to
[1:26:01] Egypt.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; So he just said they will go to Egypt.
[1:26:05] But he doesn't say how.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; So under this it's Joseph. It's all the
[1:26:09] hatred everything is hidden right there.
[1:26:11] Are we together? So the plan begin to
[1:26:14] unfold. According to the plan, your
[1:26:16] people will surge to a strange land.
[1:26:20] Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Which we know today it was Egypt.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And it happened with Joseph.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; We know because it's already finished.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh 13 kama. Uh and shall do
[1:26:36] what?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; If you notice he say the people shall
[1:26:40] sjourn and there is a kama.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; A kama may mean a dispensation.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; So there will be a time they will surge
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; when they will be treated well because
[1:26:51] of Joseph.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible say come and the Bible
[1:26:55] say and serve them. So this is a second
[1:26:59] stage
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; where they will become slave.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; because a pharaoh will rise that will
[1:27:07] not know Joseph.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; So the second one they will serve them
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; which mean they will be slave.
[1:27:16] We clear on that one.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And if you notice again, you will find
[1:27:20] that shall serve them and there is
[1:27:23] another end.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; So you need to be very careful with
[1:27:26] scripture.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And they shall do what?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Afflict them 400 years.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; For what?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; They will serve them and they will
[1:27:34] afflict them as a slave. Afflict them
[1:27:38] for how many years?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; 400 years.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; God, they ask God the question,
[1:27:44] vindicate this.
[1:27:48] God begin to explain the seed will go to
[1:27:51] Egypt and this is what will happen and
[1:27:54] think Abraham just say vindicated this
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; are we
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; verse 14 and also that nation which is
[1:28:04] Egypt
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; whom they shall serve which is Egypt
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; without judge that happened
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; so right there is a Moses right there
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; but he won't tell you Moses. But Moses
[1:28:16] is right there.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So there will come a time of a judgment.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; The judgment of Egypt.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Which happened under Moses.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So the Exodus under a prophet Joseph.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I mean the going under Joseph and the
[1:28:34] Exodus under another prophet.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible say and also that nation whom
[1:28:39] they shall serve will I judge. Are we
[1:28:42] together?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And after that, and afterward
[1:28:46] shall they come out with what?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Great substance.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So when the judgment of God will begin
[1:28:52] to pour down upon Egypt,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; do you follow me?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; There will be something that will happen
[1:28:59] to Israel.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go very slowly.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; When Israel journey in the strange land,
[1:29:08] they were in Gan,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; the best of the land. And they prospered
[1:29:13] so much
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; and the Egyptian were jealous.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Then Egypt came and changed them from
[1:29:20] VIP people and put them to slavery.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And they lost everything.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Then the judgment came with Moses. Came
[1:29:31] the third exodus.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; The ex I mean the exodus. The first
[1:29:35] Exodus came right there. Amen. But
[1:29:39] before Moses pulled them out,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; when the judgment is failing,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; God says something to Abraham.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; We clear
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; in the midst of all the mess.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; God says something to Abraham.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; What is he telling Abraham
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; in verse 14? He say, "And afterward
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; shall they, the people of Israel,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; they shall come out how?"
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; With great substance.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Break that down.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; So Israel will leave Egypt. How?
[1:30:20] [Applause]
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; What is wrong?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Israel will leave Egypt. How? rich.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So when you see judgment falling left
[1:30:32] and right,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; In the midst of that judgment, sir,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; there is a period of time.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; That Israel will be favored.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; There is a period of time Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; A period of time.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; A season.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That Israel will get great.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Great. What?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Substance.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; This substance we need to know. How will
[1:31:23] Israel get it?
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:30] Because some of you think Israel will go
[1:31:33] get doctor's degree
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; to get this substance.
[1:31:38] Some of you think the Jews will be
[1:31:40] working three jobs
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; so that they will get more income.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Some of you think the Jews will open up
[1:31:52] businesses.
[1:31:55] to get this substance.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; We need to know how did they get the
[1:32:00] substance.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; God just say they will get it.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's all I know.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 17. We almost finishing
[1:32:13] this. You're doing good. Great job.
[1:32:16] Spoken word.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. If you there, we can say amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it came to pass that when the
[1:32:24] sun went down,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; now darkness naturally and darkness
[1:32:32] spiritually because there was a darkness
[1:32:34] that came down.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Now the sun is completely down.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; It is a night
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; plus darkness.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Great darkness plus night.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; When the sun was going went down. Amen.
[1:32:51] Amen. If you notice on verse 12, he said
[1:32:54] the sun was going down.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; But now it's not going.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The sun is down.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Darkness upon the earth
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; and then there is great darkness
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; and hell is there
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; because now it's night.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; This is night
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; plus hell.
[1:33:21] So you can come up with your own uh I
[1:33:24] mean recipe
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; how dark it is
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; because this dark because this hell came
[1:33:30] with great darkness.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; It's right here.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Great darkness.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; We together.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And it came to pass that when
[1:33:41] the sun went down,
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; no more light. And he was light.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Dark.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Ah, we clear. And it was dark kama.
[1:33:52] Behold a what?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; A smoking furnace.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Where did the furnace came? Brother say
[1:33:56] that was hell ramen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; In other word hell completely unleash.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; It is dark. There is no sun, nothing, no
[1:34:07] more light. It is dark. The Bible say
[1:34:09] it's dark. Hell is there. A great
[1:34:12] furnace of hell is right there.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And Abraham is right there. Abraham is
[1:34:16] not away. He's right there. God didn't
[1:34:18] remove Abraham
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; because God need to make a covenant.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; God left Abraham there but he just put
[1:34:28] Abraham in the stage where Abraham
[1:34:30] doesn't have to do anything.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; It is all in the responsibility of God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says, "And it
[1:34:42] was dark come behold a what?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; A smoking furnace
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and a what?
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; A burning lamp."
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Now we see a lamp.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; In another translation, it's a light
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; that begin to come in the midst of
[1:35:00] darkness.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:08] And what is the light doing?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Because remember we already separated
[1:35:13] our sacrifice.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; But now the light is coming when hell is
[1:35:16] there. In other words, when hell has
[1:35:19] established completely,
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; the light now begin to come.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham saw something
[1:35:28] like
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; it's moving.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham say uh uh let
[1:35:36] me stop let me read face. He says and a
[1:35:39] burning lamp that did what?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Passed between those pieces.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Ah
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; a burning lamp was doing what?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Pass between those pieces.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; So who was confirming the conf? Because
[1:35:53] Abraham is sleeping
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham said for those who
[1:35:56] are still thinking brother Brham said
[1:35:58] that burning lamp was the pillar of
[1:36:00] fire.
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:08] Are we together?
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So, in other word, when in the midst of
[1:36:17] hell,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; in the midst of gross darkness,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; when there is no more sun
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and the light is gone, God came down
[1:36:27] himself
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and passed between the pieces. Yes, sir.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; To confirm the covenant.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know what passes
[1:36:40] between the pieces means.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Passes between the pieces means this.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It means if I'm standing between the two
[1:36:51] pieces right here,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said what he meant is
[1:36:57] if any of us
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; break the covenant,
[1:37:02] You will be dead
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; as the pieces that are dead.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; So Abraham was supposed to go through
[1:37:12] that himself.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; But God put Abraham aside.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And God himself
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; God passed through the covenant
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; not as Jesus Christ.
[1:37:33] Please keep your seat belt.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know why everything I planned to
[1:37:46] move on. It's not working. Uh God pass
[1:37:51] in between the covenant
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; not as Jesus.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a reason why they say
[1:38:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why they say that.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? This is a man.
[1:38:18] in the man.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; That's why when Jesus said the son of
[1:38:29] man will be killed, the Jews look they
[1:38:31] say but Christ abide forever.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, you cannot kill Christ.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Christ is immortal.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; So how do you say you are the Christ and
[1:38:42] you going to die?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; No. Jesus here was a lamb.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And this one who died on Calvary.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? But this one is
[1:38:55] immortal.
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; This one cannot die.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; But both of them are one.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:13] One is the physical manifestation
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and one is the invisible God
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; made visible as a light.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Have I lost you? If I
[1:39:28] lost you, raise your hand.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; So instead of God passing as Jesus,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; you can kill the man Jesus. He died on
[1:39:40] the cross. God pass Christ
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; as the immortal one
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; showing that if something doesn't work
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; you need to kill Christl
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; but Christ does not die.
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So in the midst
[1:40:11] are we together? So in the midst of all
[1:40:14] this chaos
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; of hell
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; we find that rather lays a unconditional
[1:40:22] covenant
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; that God himself soul
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; not by you by himself.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because there is no one
[1:40:34] greater than him. He must swear by
[1:40:37] himself that if I don't give you what I
[1:40:40] say,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; you kill me.
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, God put himself at stake
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; to make sure you are real. In other
[1:40:55] words, if you need an assurance,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham, that I'm going to do what I say
[1:41:00] I'm going to do.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; I put myself to be dead. If I don't do
[1:41:05] what I told you to do, you kill me.
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But remember, I don't die.
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; We clear, right?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our second scripture in
[1:41:24] Exodus 12.
[1:41:30] I won't congratulate you again because
[1:41:32] you would go slow.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our second scripture. I know
[1:41:39] you very well
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; if you there you can say amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; I know the devil will fight you all here
[1:41:50] not to understand this but we started
[1:41:53] last week we could not finish. So let's
[1:41:55] let's go there. Amen.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Exodus 12. So don't turn your clock yet.
[1:41:59] I'm reading the Bible.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Uh Exodus 12. If you there, you can say
[1:42:03] amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 11 because we need to
[1:42:06] know how.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Did Israel get the substance?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; When they tell you get the substance,
[1:42:17] some of you are more spiritual.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; The substance God give you really it's
[1:42:26] not for you.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Even though you will enjoy it.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:32] Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; God will give you two napkins.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And you who are spiritual, you say,
[1:42:44] "Give me one."
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; He gave you.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; But when he gave you two, he knows why
[1:42:50] he's giving you two. because he knows
[1:42:53] you would take one and give to brother
[1:42:55] Greg.
[1:42:57] That's exactly right.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; And but you are too spiritual.
[1:43:01] [Applause]
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Too humble.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. I have to say that to
[1:43:10] break something. So we move on. Let's go
[1:43:12] to uh 11. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And thus this is Moses giving
[1:43:19] instruction for the Exodus. Yes,
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; because now Israel is about to leave.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; But remember there was a promise when
[1:43:26] they about to leave
[1:43:30] when everything is chaos a mess. In
[1:43:33] other words, if you go in in Egypt,
[1:43:35] things are broken, building down because
[1:43:37] the hell came and destroyed the cuddle
[1:43:40] and everything in the midst of that that
[1:43:43] chaos.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Israel, you must focus on one thing.
[1:43:48] Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 11. And thus shall you eat it.
[1:43:54] God gave them the instruction about the
[1:43:55] lamb. Kill the lamb and take the blood
[1:43:57] to put in the lentil and roast the lamb
[1:43:59] with a fire and everything. Then God is
[1:44:02] saying them is is uh is talking to them
[1:44:04] that this is how you going to eat.
[1:44:06] Because Israel was not ready to leave.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Israel was not leaving yet.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; He was ready to leave. I'm going to
[1:44:14] repeat it again
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; because I'm going somewhere. Israel was
[1:44:18] not leaving yet.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Israel is still in Egypt,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; but they already know they are leaving.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And God come
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; before they leave.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And God say that shall you eat it
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; with your what?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Loins girded.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; So God didn't say because you leaving
[1:44:42] don't eat.
[1:44:45] I'm getting somewhere.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; God say eat it.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; But when you eat it, have your pants on.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; with your belt on.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; In other word, be like somebody who's
[1:45:02] traveling.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; But still stay and eat.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; We will get there.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Ah, are we together?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "And that shall you eat it?"
[1:45:19] How?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; With your loins girded.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Come out with what?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; In other words, remember you are living.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Because if they tell you you're living,
[1:45:32] you don't care about food.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; If you're taking a flight,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; you don't care about food. God said
[1:45:42] because God did not tell them when they
[1:45:44] would leave.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; God only tell them be ready
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:55] [Applause]
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; to make it easy on you.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Charles is right here with a tie
[1:46:03] on, with a shoes on. God say be like
[1:46:05] that.
[1:46:07] Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; But just know you will leave.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; So when you eat like that,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; if you want to talk to your neighbor
[1:46:16] like that,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; so that when the flight come,
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; you don't need to go put your clothes
[1:46:23] on, your clothes are on
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; for the flight at any time.
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:32] Hallelujah.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Are we Please help me. Are we together?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; How do you eat, my friend?
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; With your loins girded.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; If If God will help you with your loins
[1:46:47] girded and what else?
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; On your feet. This is at your house.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You want to eat? God say not barefooted.
[1:47:02] Yeah.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Make sure you put your nice uh Sunday
[1:47:07] shoes on, then go eat with it because I
[1:47:11] don't want to come and you say, "Ah, let
[1:47:13] me get my socks. Get your socks. Put
[1:47:16] your socks on." In other words, when I
[1:47:18] park on the parking lot like a Uber,
[1:47:20] when I do this, you just enter and we
[1:47:23] go.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You are eating with what? Your loans ged
[1:47:30] and what?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Your staff in your hand.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Ah, in other way, even your staff is
[1:47:36] already there.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Everything is there.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Your staff in your hand.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Don't say uh where where is my cane?
[1:47:46] Where did I get your cane around? When
[1:47:49] you go into the bathroom, go with your
[1:47:50] cane.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; With your stuff on you. Continue, my
[1:47:56] friend.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Shall eat it in haste.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; And you shall eat it how? in haste.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Fast. It is what?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; The Lord's Passover. You eating that
[1:48:07] fast in haste. If it's a haste, there is
[1:48:11] an urgency.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 12. Amen. Uh, that was 11.
[1:48:20] Job to verse 12. For I will pass water
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; through the land of Egypt this night.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; This night.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. This night is vague.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Is it 8:00 PM?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Is it at 8:30?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Is it at 9?
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Is it at 10? Is it at 11? Is it at
[1:48:40] 11:45?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He say when
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; what time?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; He gave only night, but he doesn't want
[1:48:50] to give the precision
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; of the Exodus.
[1:48:55] Because if he says a 9:00, all of you
[1:48:58] remove shoes.
[1:49:02] H
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; some of you begin to dance.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You are dancing. You say, "No, no, it's
[1:49:06] not 9:00. Let's play outside." You is it
[1:49:10] 9:20? Then you begin to say, "Huh, I
[1:49:12] know my people.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give them the exact
[1:49:16] time
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; so that they can always be on the look.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?"
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 12, for I will pass through
[1:49:27] the land when
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; this night.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And I will smite all the firstborn of
[1:49:31] the land of Egypt, both man and water
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; and beast.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And against all the gods of Egypt, I
[1:49:37] will execute what?
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Judgment.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Because I am what?
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse 29. I'm skip speaking. I
[1:49:44] mean skipping this. And it came to pass
[1:49:47] that a what?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Midnight.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Now we know the time. Yes.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't say what what he says at which
[1:49:54] night.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Midnight.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; At first he say at night,
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; but in his mind God had midnight.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; So Israel didn't know it's coming at
[1:50:04] midnight.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Israel maybe thought by 8:30 we are
[1:50:08] gone.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; God didn't want to tell them anything.
[1:50:13] But a midnight
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; midnight
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; when God is coming, your shoes on your
[1:50:18] feet,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; your loins are ged,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; your stuff are in the hand. In other
[1:50:23] words, when God look at you ready to go,
[1:50:25] when he look at you ready to go, when
[1:50:27] you look at you ready to go, but there's
[1:50:29] still a time there
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; that God is not there yet.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; So you are living ready.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; You are still living in Egypt, but you
[1:50:40] are ready.
[1:50:42] I hope we are together.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Verse 29. And it came to pass that at
[1:50:48] what time?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Midnight.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Now we know 12 p.m. You know the
[1:50:51] midnight cry. The Lord smote all the
[1:50:54] firstborn of the land of Egypt. From the
[1:50:56] firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on the on
[1:50:58] his throne to the firstborn of the
[1:51:01] captive that was in the water
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; dungeon.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Even in the prisoner there.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; In the dungeon. And all the firstborn of
[1:51:07] what?
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the
[1:51:10] night.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He and what?
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; All his servants
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; and all the Egyptian. And there was a
[1:51:17] great cry in Egypt. For there was not a
[1:51:20] house where there was not one water.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a moon.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So everybody rose at
[1:51:29] night.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; We clear all of these are happening in
[1:51:33] darkness.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; There's no sun.
[1:51:38] Amen.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; We clear
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; verse uh uh uh 31. And he called for
[1:51:44] Moses and Aaron by night and say rise up
[1:51:48] and get you forth from among my people.
[1:51:50] In other words, Pharaoh didn't want to
[1:51:52] wait in the morning.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is Moses and Aaron? They
[1:51:57] are in Hilton Garden. Go wake them up.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; But it's not night yet. Right now, pack
[1:52:06] your stuff and leave.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "And he called Moses and
[1:52:15] Pharaoh by night, the same night, and
[1:52:17] say, do what?
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Rise up
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; and get you forth from among my people,
[1:52:21] both you and who?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Do you have time to go pack for
[1:52:26] diapers?"
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; The children of Isra of Israel. and go
[1:52:35] and do what?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; as you have said. Verse 32. And water.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Al also take your flock.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, even your flock should
[1:52:42] be ready.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Even your flock should be ready.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Take your flock and your water.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Your herds
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; and water.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; As he have said,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; and be what?
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; And be gone.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, get out
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; and midnight.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Get out and bless me also."
[1:53:02] Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Let's leave that one alone.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Verse 33. And the Egyptian were how?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Urgent.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Upon what?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; The people.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, your neighbor begin to
[1:53:16] say, "Hey, hey, please, please get out.
[1:53:17] Get out. Get out. Get out. Let's go.
[1:53:18] Let's go. Let's go." No. No. No. No. No.
[1:53:21] No. Leave.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; You become a hot potato. Leave.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Egyptian were
[1:53:28] urgent upon the people that they must
[1:53:30] send them out of what?
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; The land in haste.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; In haste. For they said, "We shall we
[1:53:38] um I mean we be all water." In other
[1:53:40] words, if you guys stay here, we will
[1:53:42] all die. Get out.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; But it's night. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:53:46] Get out. Amen.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, they don't even give us a
[1:53:51] chance to wait in the morning and night.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, you told us to be ready to leave
[1:53:58] at midnight.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; So, some are waking up the baby that
[1:54:05] were already sleeping with their shoes.
[1:54:07] They put the baby on the car seat
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; at night.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It looks a chaos. Lord, why didn't you
[1:54:13] wait in the morning? Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; But let's see what is happening at
[1:54:18] night.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Next verse, my friend.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; 34.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 34. And the people took their
[1:54:25] what?
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Their dough before it was
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; before it was what?
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So there was unfinished food.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; They were cooking some food.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; So some of the food didn't have enough
[1:54:39] time.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; To complete the process.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes sir.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; In let me put it in our way. In other
[1:54:45] words, some of the meat are still
[1:54:47] roasting.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And the time of departure came up.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; So the time of departure will come
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; and some of your project won't be
[1:55:01] completed.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me go again. Let me go
[1:55:09] again. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.
[1:55:12] Please, we have not start preaching.
[1:55:13] Help me my friend.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Help me my friend. So as the time of
[1:55:18] departure happened,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; we found out that some were done.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Somewhere unfinished.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; So at the time of Exodus,
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; we found out that there were things that
[1:55:34] were completed
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and they are completed and there are
[1:55:38] things that were not unfinished.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; But they were started.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; They were they they started.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; But they didn't finish. Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; So, Israel didn't sit
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Adl.
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Israel was working.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And where God meet them?
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we together?
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Because we don't know the hour and the
[1:56:14] time.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Please preach with me. I hope we are
[1:56:21] together.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Please, today you will stay here. We
[1:56:26] need to finish this because you are
[1:56:28] giving differently. We need to finish
[1:56:29] this.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Verse uh where are we at?
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; 34.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Verse 34. And the people took their
[1:56:39] water
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; though before it was leaven.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; It was not leaven yet.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; And their water
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; kneading thro
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; being what
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; bound up in their clothes
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; upon what?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Their shoulders. In other words, they
[1:56:49] took the pen just as it was boiling and
[1:56:52] they pick up the pen because it's not
[1:56:54] finished.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? They took the material
[1:56:58] that needed and put it everything on the

[1:57:02] somewhere.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Ah, let's take it.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Uh verse uh 35. Let's go, my friend.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; all of this is happening at what time?
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Midnight. Do you see sun and midnight?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; What is in midnight?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; And what is outside in Egypt? What do
[1:57:25] you hear?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; People are crying. Is that a good time?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; It's a funeral time everywhere.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; But even though it's a funeral for you,
[1:57:36] it's a departure.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And not only a departure, let's see
[1:57:44] verse 35. Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 35 say, "And the children of
[1:57:48] Israel did what?"
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; According to the word of Moses.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; According to the word of who?
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And Moses got that word from who?
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; So let's see. What did Moses tell the
[1:57:58] children of Israel? According to the
[1:58:01] word of Moses, come out and did what?
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; They borrowed of the Egyptians.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; They borrowed of the Egyptian.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly. Were they coming back?
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Were they coming back?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible say they did what?
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; If you look at the correct translation,
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; it means they ask.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't borrow. They ask because
[1:58:28] borrow you need to return. The correct
[1:58:31] translation say they ask.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; They ask who?
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Let's read my friend. And they
[1:58:40] verse 35. And they borrow or they ask of
[1:58:44] the water.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Egyptians jewels of silver.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; They ask them what
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; jewels of silver.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Please read loud.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Some some don't want to hear those
[1:58:53] stuff. Just read them.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; They bought and they bought
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; someone they they ask for Bible. They
[1:58:59] ask for tapes. That's what you want. Uh
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; have I said something wrong? I'm reading
[1:59:05] the Bible. We are
[1:59:08] We are answering great substance.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; We are answering what?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Some of you you ask for prayer.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; We need to know what they ask.
[1:59:24] [Applause]
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Every minute you taking, you will pay it
[1:59:31] back
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; with interest. But since I'm a
[1:59:36] Christian, I won't put you in.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; And they barred of the Egyptians.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; They ask what?
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Of the Egyptians. Jewels of silver.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Jewel of what?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; What are they going to do with silver?
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? What are they going to do for
[1:59:57] silver?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Because it ah let me let me now nail it.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; This was not them. It's Moses that
[2:00:05] command them.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; It was Moses that told them at this time
[2:00:11] when everything is dark,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; go to the Egyptian, ask them this and
[2:00:17] this and this.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; The spiritual Moses.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; The spiritual Moses say, "Ask what?
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Silver and water."
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And jewels of gold
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; and jewels of gold and what?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; And Raymond.
[2:00:32] are no message believers. So I have to
[2:00:33] be protected.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; So when you come fight with the word
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Jews of gold and what
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; and then what
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; do you know what remnant mean?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; It means what?
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; So in your Exodus you asking for what?
[2:00:53] [Applause]
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Can you answer me? Yes sir.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Can you answer me?
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; In your Exodus, you ask him for what?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; So when you go to the to the guys that
[2:01:07] own the shop, you say, you know those
[2:01:09] two suits that have there?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Give me those suit.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Who?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Who commanded it?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[2:01:27] fight me.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Who commanded it?
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; because in Genesis, God already
[2:01:38] prophesied.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; And we find this season happened in the
[2:01:44] midst of darkness.
[2:01:50] Yes sir.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, there was a special
[2:01:52] anointing
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; that came in the midst of chaos.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; When it came in the world for the bride,
[2:01:59] it was not chaos.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; It was a time for Jew
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; of silver of gold and remnant.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you for let me ask you, did
[2:02:11] they pay for it?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Did they work for it?
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Did they went to school for it?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; No sir. They are getting by asking.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Let me ask.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Let me let me ask you let me ask you a
[2:02:26] question.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; What prove to you? What prove to you
[2:02:31] that if you ask they will give it to
[2:02:33] you?
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; So it must be done by what?
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; By what?
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; So Moses turned them into a faith.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, when you go to
[2:02:47] In other words, when you go to the Eg,
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; you don't say please Mr. Egyptian. No,
[2:02:53] you say sir,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I need this. I need this. I need this. I
[2:03:00] need this. Put them on my luggage
[2:03:02] quickly. I'm leaving.
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:13] Some of you the GPS signal is lost.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know your problem? Do you know
[2:03:23] your problem? You try to be more
[2:03:25] spiritual. Wait when I read brother.
[2:03:28] Wait when I read brother then he will
[2:03:31] finish with you.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; This is a commandment of Moses.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; In all the word, Moses based that by the
[2:03:44] word.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; He had a scripture backup.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Because God already promised to Abraham.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Did you work for it?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; So maybe during that time, father,
[2:04:05] I don't know if I will even preach.
[2:04:06] Maybe during that time,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; amen,
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; you are going into the store and you
[2:04:11] keep watching,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; you say, "Ah, Lord, the day I will
[2:04:14] afford to get that dress,
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; but I don't have money to get that
[2:04:18] dress." God knew
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; that there will come a time when you
[2:04:22] don't need money, but you will get the
[2:04:25] dress.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; You don't need a bank account, but God
[2:04:31] will come.
[2:04:35] You don't need to have money. You need
[2:04:37] the word of the prophet.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; You need the word. Man shall not live by
[2:04:42] bread alone. Every word what the prophet
[2:04:46] say is enough.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Can I say something?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Can I say something?
[2:05:01] You know that the tabernacle was built
[2:05:03] in the wilderness.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; So which material did they use?
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Which material did they use?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Which material did they use?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; So God is not looking at you.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; He's blessing you for his purpose.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; You who are humble.
[2:05:25] You who are humble,
[2:05:27] they were giving you the juice because
[2:05:29] God knew he will need it over there for
[2:05:33] the tabernacle.
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:40] [Applause]
[2:05:44] useful.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Get a nice job. No, I'm okay with the
[2:05:50] way I am.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; We need to build the tabernacle.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm going to ask God to bless you
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; and to lock that money to go to the
[2:06:02] tabernacle
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; because you don't need it, but the
[2:06:12] tabernacle need it.
[2:06:14] [Applause]
[2:06:20] Are we together, brother Tony?
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; H. Brother Tony, say amen.
[2:06:26] Where are we at, my friend?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; We on verse 36.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Verse 36. And we will finish sooner, my
[2:06:32] friend.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; If you do good, we finish and we start
[2:06:35] read. I have not started reading Baram.
[2:06:37] Let's go. Verse 36. And the Lord God did
[2:06:40] what? gave the people favor in the sight
[2:06:43] of the Egyptians.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; So the word of Moses was accompanied by
[2:06:49] what?
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Favor.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; A divine anointing of favor.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; In other word, whenever you accept what
[2:06:59] Moses said,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; a favor come on you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:08] The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the
[2:07:10] people what?
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Favor in the in the sight of the
[2:07:13] Egyptians
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; so that they did what?
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Lent unto themselves."
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, they gave them what?
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Such things as they required.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; They gave them what?
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; The silver.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; They gave them what?
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[2:07:29] So whatever was coming in the mouth
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; of the Israel,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; if Israel speak something,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; the Egyptian give it.
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is speak.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; When you get to somebody, you say, "I
[2:07:51] need that."
[2:07:55] And you don't have to even think what
[2:07:56] the answer will be because there is a
[2:07:59] favor of the Lord. There is an anointing
[2:08:02] of the Lord.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? In the midst of
[2:08:07] trouble, in the midst of darkness, and
[2:08:10] midnight
[2:08:12] when we were uncomfortable,
[2:08:15] when they woke me up to move on, there
[2:08:18] is an anointing in the time
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; for me to get what I needed.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together in the back?
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the
[2:08:37] people favor in the sight of what?"
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; so that they lent them such things as
[2:08:42] the water
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; required.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; And the Lord did what?
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Spoiled the Egyptians.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know what Paul mean?
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Took away.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Who did it?"
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Who did it?
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; But who actually was doing it?
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; If you look in your eyes, who was doing
[2:09:01] that?
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; But truly, who was doing that?
[2:09:07] To you it is brother Charles.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; But when God look it say it's not
[2:09:11] brother Charles.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I am the one spawning Egypt.
[2:09:15] [Applause]
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; I'm removing things from Egypt.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 39. My friendes.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 39.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And they did what? baked unleavened
[2:09:32] cakes of the dough which they've brought
[2:09:33] forth out of Egypt.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; And it was not because for it was not
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; it was not leavened
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; because they were how
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; thrust out of Egypt
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; and could not tell neither they they
[2:09:43] neither had they don't done done what
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; prepared for themselves any victory.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, God pushed them in the
[2:09:50] time that they didn't have time to even
[2:09:53] pack stuff,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; pack food.
[2:09:57] And God made it so they push them like
[2:10:00] that
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; so that God will now teach them in the
[2:10:04] wilderness. Remember yesterday
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; to live by faith,
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; not by what you pack.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; No. Now you are living by faith.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; If you need quail, you don't need no
[2:10:18] restaurant.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You don't need McDonald.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. The quail must
[2:10:24] come.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Mother will come
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; not from human being.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; A hidden season
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; in darkness
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; to you. What is going on in Egypt? So
[2:10:42] and so I pass away. So and so are going
[2:10:44] to the funeral. Over there also there is
[2:10:46] a c. But I'm telling you all over the
[2:10:48] world it's a mess. Everybody's losing
[2:10:51] somebody.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Check that season very well.
[2:10:56] Check that season very well.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; When death is on the land, when the pale
[2:11:00] horse is riding,
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; when death is riding all over, be
[2:11:05] careful. There is something there
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; before the exodus
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; before the living of Egypt. Before the
[2:11:13] living of the world, the last anointing
[2:11:16] is the pale horse.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Watch out what is there.
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to our last scripture.
[2:11:25] Isaiah 60.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our last scripture.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh.

[2:11:39] the Bible.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's church.
[2:11:54] Isaiah 36. If you there, you can say
[2:11:56] amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 60. If you there, you can say
[2:12:00] amen.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Let's move on, my friend. You are taking
[2:12:04] time.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; On this side, we there.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 60 verse1.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible says what?
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Arise.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; If they say arise, you must be seated.
[2:12:23] That's correct.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; I only have four minutes to finish this
[2:12:28] one. So we start preaching. If they say
[2:12:30] aras,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; you were not standing.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You were sitting
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; or you were laying down
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; and God say do what?
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; How can you shine?
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; So who are you?
[2:12:45] [Applause]
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Who are you to shine?
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. I hope we are together
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; in the back there. Are we together?
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; If God say arise and do what?
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; So who are you to be shining?
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; So what do you have in you?
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; And when do you need the light?
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Can you preach with me? When do you need
[2:13:17] the light?
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; In darkness. Yes.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; And God say arise and what?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Did God say I shine?
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Who's going to shine?
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Me.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; So the light is where?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; In me.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; He say
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; for what?
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; The light of who?
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Thy light. God's light.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:13:47] The light of who?
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, my light.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; The light of who?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; So, your light was somewhere
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and your light came.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Please help me.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Your light was somewhere
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; and God is saying stand up
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; right
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; and shine
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; right
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; because your light has come.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Not the light of God. Your light.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; My light. Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Have come. Amen.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, a a a fire came.

[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Because your light has what?
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; And the glory of who?
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Of the Lord
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; has done what?
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Risen upon me.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; So God is where now?
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. On me.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; On God is where?
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; On me. In other words, the anointing has
[2:14:45] come.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; It's on me. Come on.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, it is your time.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; It is your season.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; It is your time.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; To rise.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; If God say arise and shine, it means you
[2:15:10] were raining down,
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; right? It means you were sitting.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; It means you were sitting in a certain
[2:15:16] condition for a while
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; and now God came
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; and say, "Hey, wake up now."
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Your light has come. Amen.

[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, embrace a new season,
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Embrace a new beginning.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:42] [Applause]
[2:15:44] Are we together?
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; In the scripture we read in Exodus,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; if you go to Exodus 12, at the
[2:15:50] beginning, God told Israel, "This is the
[2:15:52] new calendar."
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are starting a new
[2:15:56] calendar.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; A new calendar with you. Now you are
[2:16:00] leaving Egypt and there was an anointing
[2:16:02] and now God is saying arise and shine.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, before you were not
[2:16:07] shining.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:10] Whatever was going on in your life

[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Your time has come.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Now arise.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; And shine.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; When people see you,
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; they see you shine.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Amen.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; If people need light, you must be there.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; If your family need light,
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; you are the light.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Where people are walking in darkness.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; If you enter there, you begin to light
[2:16:54] up.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say when the light
[2:16:58] comes up, all the cockroaches,
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh-huh. Run away.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Begin to go. That's right. So if the
[2:17:06] light came, the little demon must begin
[2:17:08] to go.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Because God is light.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; But not God. You're light.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:26] [Applause]
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Traman, we together.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[2:17:35] two,
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; verse two,
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; God is asking us,
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; rise up and do what?
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; Shine.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; So, we need to know we shining in the
[2:17:46] midst of what?
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; The darkness.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Season hidden way
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; and darkness.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Season in the hidden way
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; and darkness.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; We need to see when you are rising to
[2:18:01] shine, what is around you,
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:05] Hallelujah.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; What is around you?
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Verse two, behold what?
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; The darkness
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; shall do what?
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Cover the earth.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Come out and what?
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Rose darkness.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; So there is a light that came
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; but at the same time the light came
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; for me to shine around me.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Yes sir. There is gross darkness.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon what?
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; The people.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; So some people have darkness,
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; But some people have the glory of the
[2:18:43] Lord.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible say for you arise
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; right
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; shine. Why? Your light have come
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is what?
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Because the glory of Lord is is a light
[2:19:00] itself. But upon other people, if you
[2:19:03] look at them, there is gross darkness,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; But the what?
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; shall what?
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Arise upon thee,
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; and his what?
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Glory
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; shall be seen where?
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Upon thee.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Let's read it again. And the glory of
[2:19:23] the Lord
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; when the people are in gross darkness
[2:19:28] when they look at you the glory of the
[2:19:30] Lord is upon you.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; And if they want to find God,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; they need to find God where
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; the Bible say that and the glory of the
[2:19:39] Lord shall be what?
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Shall be what?
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Seen where?
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Upon thee.
[2:19:46] So when people look at you,
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; the people in darkness when they look at
[2:19:54] you,
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; they must see God.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:00] [Applause]
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; So now let's start our sermon.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Now we starting our sermon.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; We Okay. Now

[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; It's great to preach in the church that
[2:20:49] is like a family.
[2:20:51] [Applause]
[2:20:51] [Laughter]
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Now, we find out according to Isaiah 60
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; that both light
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; and darkness
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; are happening simultaneously.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, at the same time
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; there is light
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; and at the same time
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; there is darkness and not darkness gross
[2:21:20] darkness.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Let's begin to paint the picture.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Let's begin to paint our picture before.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this about this
[2:21:36] scripture.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; First quote. Brother Brandham says that
[2:21:41] in the message water shalom
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; he say gross darkness where
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; upon the people
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; of discourse. This is a what
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; a prophesying of the
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; of the day that we are what
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; living now.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, the day you are living
[2:21:56] now
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; is gross darkness.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; But remember your light has come.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are looking at the picture of
[2:22:10] this darkness first.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's look at this darkness
[2:22:15] because that's where we are more
[2:22:16] professional.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; That is where we are. We we we we have
[2:22:21] our PhD.
[2:22:23] So let's bring our PhD, our master, BB,
[2:22:26] BSD, whatever. Let's bring it out.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Ah, brother. Brand says in which
[2:22:34] message?
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; He says this what?
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness. I wish to speak on it
[2:22:39] what
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; first.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; So let's start with gross darkness.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Let me put it again here. Amen. Let's
[2:22:50] start with gross darkness. Brother
[2:22:52] Robert, he is slide a little bit. He
[2:22:54] says that there is so much of that in
[2:22:58] the world today.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; There's so much of gross darkness
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; in the world today. Amen.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; All of you would say amen.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Because you see that. Amen. He says,
[2:23:10] "And growing how?"
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Darker and darker all the time.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's getting worse.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; We wish the darkness would stop.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; But the darkness is not stopping.
[2:23:24] Remember when it started with Abraham,
[2:23:26] it get to a point the the sun itself
[2:23:29] went down
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; and the smoking furnace came out from
[2:23:32] hell.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say it's getting
[2:23:35] worse and worse.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about brother Robert. Just
[2:23:37] focus right here. Amen. He says each
[2:23:40] year we found out that the world gets
[2:23:43] what?
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Darker.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; because they are grouping where
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; in darkness.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; There is what?
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; More sin. Just passing through what we
[2:23:52] have the what?
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Assassination of the president.
[2:23:58] [Music]
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's it. Now, brother,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; you didn't get it.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Let me help you. You You who are on the
[2:24:05] media,
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; the assassination of Charlie K.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; In the present time,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; the assassination. I don't have anything
[2:24:16] to do with that. I'm just saying what is
[2:24:18] going on. He said the assassination of
[2:24:21] what?
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; The president
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; and so forth. And people being what?
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Murdered right here in our country.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; That's why I say that. People being
[2:24:28] murdered where?
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Right here in our country.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Which country?
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Our country.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; What is happening all around now?
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; What do you see on the bus station?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody murder somebody in the bus.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody shoot somebody in the in the in
[2:24:42] the in the campus. A co coming up got
[2:24:45] shot everywhere.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:48] Yes, it is.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Don't lose your anointing, my friend.
[2:24:54] Let's keep climbing.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; He says that and where we would not
[2:24:59] think that would be happening in the
[2:25:01] time of what?
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Modern civilization.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, all this killing should
[2:25:05] not be even part of the civilization.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; After all the education we have, after
[2:25:10] all the technology, we should not be
[2:25:13] seeing all shooting like this.
[2:25:17] Are we together?
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; But we sure have it
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; because of what?
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness is upon the people.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, what you see going on is
[2:25:27] a reflection of gross darkness.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Please follow me.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; I won't let you go. You need to do it
[2:25:35] today.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now those who will not
[2:25:39] turn to
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; light
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; then there is only one thing that I can
[2:25:43] say for the coming year you are going to
[2:25:46] stop how
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; darker
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; and darker as the year goes on
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; in other words don't expect things to
[2:25:52] get better
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; I know when I say that you are trembling
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; hold on my friend keep your seat belt we
[2:26:04] just started
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; amen Brother say, have you noticed
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; in the last water
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; few years
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; some of you men and women around my age
[2:26:14] that how each year it seems like the
[2:26:16] what
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; darkness comes more and more. I was
[2:26:19] speaking the other day and I say to my
[2:26:21] wife,
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Sister Cheron, you know, it seems like
[2:26:25] that as the ear do what
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; goes on
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; and it just seem like the people begin
[2:26:31] to get water
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; further and further away from the real
[2:26:34] thing
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; that they should be coming out
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; closer and closer to
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; it looks like people hate God.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; It looks like people
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; uh the the the the what the atheist
[2:26:48] begin to get more covert
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; than the Christian.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; We are painting that picture first. My
[2:26:58] friend, brother Brandham say, I have
[2:27:01] noticed among men, look out where
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; on the streets
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; and most among women, what they desire
[2:27:07] and what they like to do. And they are
[2:27:10] changing what?
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Attitudes all the time.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Men are becoming like what?
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Women.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Should I tell you anything? go to
[2:27:17] Walmart
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; and then women are becoming more like
[2:27:21] what
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; men.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; It seems like there is no way to stop
[2:27:24] it.
[2:27:27] [Music]
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; The LBGT got more power in voices than
[2:27:32] you.
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:34] [Applause]
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; They got their own scholarship.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; They got their own club where they
[2:27:41] support one another.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; And it's not getting better.
[2:27:46] What is going on my friend?
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; If somebody is snowing, shake him. Amen.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; He said across the nation doing what?
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Preaching against the thing.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; And come back the next year and it's how
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; worse than it was when it started.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preach thinking that
[2:28:02] when he preach it's going to go down.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; But when he preach it gets what?
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Worse.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Keep following me. I'm painting the
[2:28:09] first picture. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "And it's them people want to
[2:28:14] do what
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; right
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; but then there is something about it
[2:28:18] that won't let them water
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; do right."
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, they want to do right.
[2:28:24] [Music]
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, but there is
[2:28:27] something
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; that is blocking them
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; from doing right.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say it just what
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; presses down on them.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Forces them. In either way, they don't
[2:28:40] know what they're doing.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; If you sit down, they don't want to do
[2:28:46] it.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, they find themselves doing it.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Tattoo everywhere.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; He says it's like a what?
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; A heavy dark fog over the whole earth.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Not only where
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; in Phoenix,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; but what?
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; All over the world. Even in Africa
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; because of Facebook everything that is
[2:29:16] happening here it's copy in Africa it's
[2:29:19] copy in Asia it's cop in Israel and all
[2:29:22] over the world

[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; because of social media
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham continue he say it's
[2:29:34] like a heavy dark fogway
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; over the whole earth
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; not only in Phoenix but how
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; all over the world
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; there seems to be just a grouping of
[2:29:43] what
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; darkness
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; that is water
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; that's gathering
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; getting more how
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; dense and dense
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; how

[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; smothering out real manhood
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; real womanhood
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking in the water
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; in the natural
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; in other words there is a force that is
[2:29:58] pushing more manhood and womanhood out
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; until we are confused
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; our Children are confused.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Let's continue my friend. Glory to God.
[2:30:14] Now we found out just about the same

[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Alarm the nation.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, people become more
[2:34:15] depressed.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Let's follow me, my friend.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; You thought with everything like this,
[2:34:23] people should be happy. They go to the
[2:34:26] beach, they stay there naked and
[2:34:28] everything. And before you know it, more
[2:34:30] depression.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; I thought they were posting on the
[2:34:35] beach.
[2:34:37] I thought they were having a good life,
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; but it turned out to be a trouble.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when everybody ought to be
[2:34:50] how
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; happy
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; with what?
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Really nothing to be unhappy about.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; There is nothing to be unhappy about.
[2:34:55] But how?
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Millions are taking sedatives.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Millions are taking what?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; I'm in the health department. I know
[2:35:03] exactly what I'm talking about. People
[2:35:05] on medication, they are taking sedative
[2:35:08] and night and water
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; pet pills pills when
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; in the morning
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; rushing to the water.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Doctors
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; entering in where
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; institution
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; and trying to drone out unknown water
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; fears by alcohol.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Something is wrong somewhere.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; He say yes this age boast of water.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; It's tremendous stores of water
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; of worldly goods. But the people are
[2:35:29] what?
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Less happy than ever. People are less
[2:35:32] happy
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; when they have everything.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say this age
[2:35:40] boast of what
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; it's spiritual attainment.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; But the people are less sure of themsel
[2:35:46] than what
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; ever.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Ask the people if they're going to go to
[2:35:49] heaven.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Ask the people, do you have the Holy
[2:35:53] Ghost?
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Even in the message rank.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said this age boast
[2:36:02] of what
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; better moral values
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; and it's more corrupt than what
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; any age since the flood
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; now we are getting somewhere.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; So from the flood
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; all the way today
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; there is no age like the age you are
[2:36:19] living in
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; other word if you saw what was before
[2:36:25] the flood this age matches it.
[2:36:29] I hope we are together. Stay put my
[2:36:32] friend. Keep your seat belt.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; He says where the church has got what
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; was the worst they ever had.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; It was the worst church ages that what
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; they ever had.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you my brother. In other word,
[2:36:57] Ephes was good.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; Smina was good,
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Pergamos was good,
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Tatarian was good,
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; service was good, Philadelphia was good,
[2:37:10] but Laisa,
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; If you put all the ages together,
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; this is the worst.
[2:37:27] Are we together?
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; How can God pick you
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; and instead of putting you in better
[2:37:38] ages,
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; God put you to the bad one.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; We are getting somewhere.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. Let me start it
[2:37:51] again.

[2:38:11] look this there is a light. The light is
[2:38:14] deeming deeming on Tatarian deeming.
[2:38:17] Deeming deeming here there's no light.
[2:38:19] It took brother Brandham to put a light
[2:38:22] [Music]
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; God say sister Unice goes right here.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; They say
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; God without you saying she's your
[2:38:33] daughter. Of course she's my daughter.
[2:38:35] Can a can a father put a child in a
[2:38:38] condition like that?
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; In a condition when people are taking
[2:38:45] sedatives
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; pet pills.
[2:38:49] of God.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; And the Lord who love you
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; so much,
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; instead of sparing you
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; from all those bad stuff, God took you
[2:39:01] and put you there.
[2:39:05] [Applause]
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:39:12] And you are extrapolating
[2:39:14] by singing all love of God has sweeten
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; in Laisha.

[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Do you realize what Laisha is?
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; Do you realize what Laisha is?
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what Laisha is.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; But from Enoch to today, Laisha is the
[2:39:40] worst.
[2:39:42] Can I continue
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; today? My friend, we got to we got to go
[2:39:46] somewhere.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; He says where the church was what?
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; The worst church age they ever had.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; In the Bible, we found out it was the
[2:39:56] only church that God was what
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; on the outside of the church
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; knocking and trying to do what?
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; Get back in his own building.

[2:40:08] Amen.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to warn you, the devil will
[2:40:13] fight you to understand this.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; So stay put, my friend.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; God put you in the age where people
[2:40:21] don't like him.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; If people don't like God, they will like
[2:40:25] you.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; But how can God stay outside and put you
[2:40:28] there?
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Can we continue?
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother say in the message where
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; turn on the light.

[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Which light? Who is the light?
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; So turn on who?
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Turn who on? Amen.
[2:40:59] [Applause]
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see Duke power here?
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; We don't need Duke power here,
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; but we got light.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is what?
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, remember
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; in this what?
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; The seventh church age.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; The what?
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Leian church.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; According to Revelation, what
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; three? They did what?
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; Reject Christ.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; Of every age that was mentioned in the
[2:41:31] Bible.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; The loud was what?
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; The worst of all of them.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; Of all the ages in the Bible.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; the worst.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; He turned him out and did what?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Rejected him.
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; Put him where?
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; On the outside.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; I'm getting my friend.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; Does God change his mind?
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; You know the answer right now?
[2:41:54] Now I claim that he is alive when
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; today.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; How?
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; And his spirit
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; after the church ages. We are
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; in the Leodysian church age.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; Which call?
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; The last call.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; And the what?
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; The worst of all of them.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Because he was put out where
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; of the church.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; So now we understand we are in the worst
[2:42:12] place.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; The worst of all.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; The worst one sees the flood.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; And then we speak about the seventh
[2:42:25] seal.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Okay. Let's let's look
[2:42:30] at the seven seal. Okay. Let's look at
[2:42:32] the seven because we talk about the
[2:42:33] seven seal. The seven seal. Let me look
[2:42:35] at the seven seal. The Bible say brother
[2:42:38] say in the message the feast of the
[2:42:39] trumpet.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; He said now the losing of what
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; this is ecclesiastical spirit.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastical water.
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; Do you know what ecclesiastical spirit
[2:42:50] was? It's a demonic religious spirit.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say this demonic
[2:42:59] religious spirit
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; has been turned loose.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; Not the spirit of God.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a religious demonic
[2:43:11] spirit.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; The devil has been turned loose.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Where
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; He says now how many years? 20 years
[2:43:24] later
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; after what
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; that war
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; you can see it's in 44 because that is
[2:43:28] 64 the the second world war or something
[2:43:31] he says we see the what
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; loosing of the ecclesiastical
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; in other words the ecclesiastical spirit
[2:43:37] was bound
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; it was control
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; do you follow me
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; do you follow me
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; we talking about the bad one and we brag
[2:43:47] about the seven seal now let's look at
[2:43:50] that seven seal that we brag
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; that seven seal that we brought, brother
[2:43:54] Brandham say that the most demonic
[2:43:57] spirit.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm explaining. The bad one
[2:44:00] was blocked, was tied,
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; was put in prison,
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; but that spirit has been liberated,
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; has been free, has been loose.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; We need to know what lose that spirit.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you tired, I stop
[2:44:16] right here.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Who lose that spirit?
[2:44:20] Brother Brandham say we see the what?
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; The loosing of the ecclesiastical
[2:44:24] spirit.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; What? And
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; the seventh seal.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; And the what?
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal.
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, hey.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. I thought the seventh
[2:44:36] seal is the message of the hour.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I thought when the
[2:44:43] seventh seal open and the full word of
[2:44:45] God and then the seals are broken and
[2:44:48] then I thought about all of that. But
[2:44:50] today, brother Brham is saying that the
[2:44:53] the the the demonic
[2:44:56] religious spirit
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; was loose where seal.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; So when they were breaking the seven
[2:45:03] seal,
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; do you follow?
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; Please can you can you read with me?
[2:45:11] Is that a problem?
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; So when they were opening the seven seal
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; because if the book was closed, we are
[2:45:19] lost.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; And John was so happy because one was
[2:45:22] found.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, to open the book and to lose the
[2:45:25] seal. Oh, and all heaven rejoice and
[2:45:28] heaven was rejoicing. John was jumping.
[2:45:31] But when they broke the seal,
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; a demonic spirit came out.
[2:45:36] [Applause]
[2:45:43] In other word, the seventh seal peritted
[2:45:48] the losing.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, when the seven sin is
[2:45:53] opening,
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; the seven se hey
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; call me the devil.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; Me and you, let's go.
[2:46:03] [Applause]
[2:46:06] You need to you you have to swallow
[2:46:08] this. I have to push it. You have to
[2:46:11] swallow this. I'm not going nowhere.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; In other word, when the because we said
[2:46:18] the seven seat is Christ.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; It's Christ.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; We know that, right?
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; But when they open up,
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; when they open up,
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't just open God.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; They also opened the devil.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; I hope you are following me.
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; So, Laia got anointing permission
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; from the sery
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; to anoint the devil to come right here.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; A season, a season where
[2:47:00] hidden where?
[2:47:02] [Music]
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. The seal of all the
[2:47:08] ages.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; The angel that was doing like this.
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, when that angel come,
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; we look at Sabino. But there is another
[2:47:18] side.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; When we were looking at Sabino, the
[2:47:22] devil also came down.
[2:47:26] [Applause]
[2:47:29] that God lose the devil.
[2:47:35] [Applause]
[2:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hell
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; came where Abraham was.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; Please follow me.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says the losing of the
[2:47:50] ecclesiastical spirit and the what?
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. How can a bad demonic
[2:47:55] spirit come under the seventh seal?
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; Ah the seventh seal the what?
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; The seventh trumpet to the Jew.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; Look at the moon which is the church
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; doing what?
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Darkening out.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Where?
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; See it's drawn out the son of man being
[2:48:13] what?
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Drawn from the church. So the reason why
[2:48:16] they are they are they are kicking Jesus
[2:48:19] out of the church because the seven seal
[2:48:22] brought the spirit down
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; and it's darkening all the churches.
[2:48:27] [Applause]
[2:48:28] [Music]
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; That's why the Pentecost can help it.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; H brother Stephen.
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; So this is dangerous.
[2:48:44] The seven still lost lose
[2:48:48] the devil on us.
[2:48:53] &gt;&gt; Laia the worst age.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; The gross darkness in Laia.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; And out of all these ages, God chose me
[2:49:03] and you
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; to put us right there.
[2:49:07] [Applause]
[2:49:07] [Music]
[2:49:08] [Applause]

[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; So after all tension is what?
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; A blessing.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; Some of you won't say amen.

[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are looking at.

[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; looking at it.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; See if you just look to If you just look
[2:50:51] the other side,
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; there is
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; follow me now. No matter,
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; brother Glenn.
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; No matter how thin you slice what

[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Two sides to it.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; So you want to see what?
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; Both sides.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat it again.
[2:51:17] Brother is saying no matter how you take
[2:51:20] something

[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; upon the people
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; the one of
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; the seven losing the ecclesiastical.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; We need to look at both side.
[2:52:01] [Applause]
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; That was one side.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; We need to look at what
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; let's flip the other side.
[2:52:12] Because God chose you to be there.
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; How can God take you and put you in the
[2:52:21] worstage
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; of all the ages?
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Depression pills going on and God take
[2:52:28] you and put you there and sh you there
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; and God take the devil and turn him
[2:52:34] loose.
[2:52:35] Amen.
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; What is in this for you?
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And if God put
[2:52:52] you in La, who are you?
[2:52:56] [Applause]
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Hallelujah.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; Who wrote first Corinthian?
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; Who wrote 1 Corinthian?
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; Paul.
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthian.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; Timothy 1.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; Timothy 2.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh Roman
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; uh uh uh uh Philippian.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; Who did that?
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; When God took Paul.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; Are you do you follow me?
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; And put sister le.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; Paul look at Paul.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; He looked the age of Ephesus full of
[2:53:34] light.
[2:53:36] full of darkness. God say le
[2:53:40] Paul le Paul Paul go where the light is.
[2:53:45] [Applause]
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong?
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; But this girl right here
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; that cannot preach the gospel
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; in
[2:53:55] the major prophet in Ephesus. Who are
[2:53:58] you?
[2:54:01] [Applause]
[2:54:08] I hope we are together.
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; Paul say if an angel come down
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; and preach differently than what I
[2:54:14] preach,
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; let the angel be watched.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; But God say you are not fit for
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; you need to be in Ephesia.
[2:54:24] I have a hand peek.
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; I have a selected group. I have an
[2:54:29] elite,
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; a Navy Seal,
[2:54:33] a four special forces that are put in
[2:54:36] Laisha.
[2:54:38] They know what to do in Laisha. They are
[2:54:41] built for Laisha.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; Can I continue, my friend?
[2:54:51] Can I continue my friend? Can I continue
[2:54:54] my friend? Let's look at this on the
[2:54:58] other side
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; because we found out that simultaneously
[2:55:03] when darkness come light also come.
[2:55:06] &gt;&gt; It looks like your light that come
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; cannot function without darkness.
[2:55:12] [Applause]
[2:55:18] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[2:55:20] [Applause]
[2:55:23] Arise and shine
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; for thy light has come.
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; But for your light to be working,
[2:55:31] &gt;&gt; we must put not darkness, gross
[2:55:34] darkness.
[2:55:37] [Applause]
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. You must put
[2:55:45] gross darkness.
[2:55:52] When God is opening the seventh seal,
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; he say ah this is too powerful called
[2:55:57] the devil himself.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; Get there
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; because this seal need to be matched by
[2:56:06] the devil himself.
[2:56:09] [Applause]
[2:56:10] Amen.
[2:56:12] [Laughter]
[2:56:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; Can we look on the other side?
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to go home?
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the other side.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend.
[2:56:29] &gt;&gt; Today,
[2:56:32] what is still loading there? It's a lot.
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; Let's go. In first John, what
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; five?
[2:56:39] Are we together?
[2:56:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible say this is then what?
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; The message.
[2:56:45] &gt;&gt; This is what
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; the message.
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; The message which we have what?
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; And declare unto you that God is what?
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; Light.
[2:56:56] &gt;&gt; God is what?
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Light.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; In him.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Where?
[2:57:02] &gt;&gt; In him.
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; In God there is no what?
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; Darkness at all. So what the Bible is
[2:57:08] saying here,
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; if you got God
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; in God
[2:57:13] 100%.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; Is what?
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; So if you want to find darkness,
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; you will never find darkness inside of
[2:57:23] God.
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; Because God is what?
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; Good. The Bible says in Revelation 21,
[2:57:33] "And the city has no need of water,
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; the sun
[2:57:36] &gt;&gt; in the city where the lamb is ah neither
[2:57:39] of water,
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; the moon
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; to water
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; to shine in it."
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; For the glory of God did what?
[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; Lighten it.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; And the lamb is what?
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; The light thereof.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; So the light is a person.
[2:57:51] [Music]
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly, my friend.
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; We are in a we are looking at the other
[2:57:58] side. Are we together?
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; Another scripture that goes to 1 Timothy
[2:58:03] 6. The Bible say our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:58:06] I'm saving time which in his time he
[2:58:09] shall do what?
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; Show
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus who is what?
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; The blessed
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; and the water
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; and only potentiate
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; and who?
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; The king of James,
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; King of King and what
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; the Lord of lords
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; who only has what?
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Immortality
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; dwelling where?
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; In the light
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; which no man can what
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; approach. For God dwell where?
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; In the life.
[2:58:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; According to Psalm 104 verse 1 and two.
[2:58:35] Bless the Lord water.
[2:58:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my soul.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord my God. Thou how?
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; Very great.
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; Thou are what?
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; Clothes with honor and majesty.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; Who covered thyself with what?
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; Light.
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; As a what?
[2:58:47] &gt;&gt; With a garment.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; So inside the light there is God.
[2:58:52] That's why when the light appeared to
[2:58:54] Apostle Paul,
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; the light say I am Jesus.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus was in the light.
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; I came from God. I'm going back to God.
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:08] &gt;&gt; So God is light.
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; In God there is what?
[2:59:15] &gt;&gt; Let's look at David.
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; David got an anointing again. David.
[2:59:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:59:23] Hallelujah. Okay. Okay. David, prophesy.
[2:59:25] Prophesy. Tell us what God is saying
[2:59:27] because you just told us God cover
[2:59:29] himself with light. We say amen. David,
[2:59:31] what else do you have? Hallelujah.
[2:59:33] Hallelujah. David, tell us. Tell us.
[2:59:36] Tell us. David under the anointing.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; Psalm 97. The Lord what?
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David, keep going. Let the
[2:59:44] earth do what?
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; Keep going, David. Let the multitude of
[2:59:48] be what? Glad there are
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; cloudness and what
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; and darkness
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; around about who?
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; Push the brake.
[2:59:57] [Music]
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; Verify on your Bible.
[3:00:02] [Applause]
[3:00:02] [Music]
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; Verify in your Bible.
[3:00:06] &gt;&gt; David. Hey, David. Wait a minute. Wait a
[3:00:09] minute.
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. David, wait a minute.
[3:00:12] Wait a minute. Slow down. Turn the car
[3:00:15] off. Come out from the car. Remove the
[3:00:18] the key. Remove the key. Come close the
[3:00:21] car. What did you say?
[3:00:26] &gt;&gt; I have a question. If a light is shining
[3:00:28] here, do you see darkness?
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; But David is saying something.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David say the Lord does
[3:00:35] what?
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; Rain.
[3:00:37] &gt;&gt; And he say what?
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; Clouds.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; Clouds. We love cloud. That's very good.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; Pillar of cloud. Oh, good.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Cloud and what?
[3:00:46] &gt;&gt; Darkness. are what?
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; Round about him.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; So if you look around God, what do you
[3:00:52] see?
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; Clouds and darkness.
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; And who is in the midst of darkness?
[3:01:06] Are we go? Let me continue. He says
[3:01:09] righteousness and what?
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; Judgment
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; are the habitation of what?
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; His throne.
[3:01:14] &gt;&gt; So God sitting on his throne. When David
[3:01:17] look, what does he see? Because God is
[3:01:19] light.
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:22] &gt;&gt; God is what?
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; But David say around God, what do you
[3:01:27] see?
[3:01:34] So if you see darkness, who is in the
[3:01:37] midst?
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; How can God tolerate?
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; Please. Please.
[3:01:54] How can God tolerate
[3:01:57] &gt;&gt; the darkness
[3:01:58] &gt;&gt; where you
[3:02:03] &gt;&gt; because this is this can confuse me?
[3:02:07] &gt;&gt; You know you you know what I'm saying?
[3:02:08] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? You know what
[3:02:10] I mean?
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; Huh? You see what I'm saying?
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because this is not right. I will
[3:02:15] look at darkness and I say, "Okay,
[3:02:17] darkness is there. I'm going to run away
[3:02:20] from it." But didn't he know that behind
[3:02:22] the darkness
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; God is there?
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; Why didn't the light of God just
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; remove darkness?
[3:02:41] because you're the one that started with
[3:02:43] this prophecy.
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; We need to understand it better.
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; Brother David is answering.
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; You begin to get wor down.

[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; that if you bring darkness,
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; if the devil say David is happy,
[3:04:19] darkness, darkness

[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; and David say when you bringing night

[3:05:19] &gt;&gt; So if you are light,
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; if they bring darkness around you,
[3:05:24] &gt;&gt; what happened to the darkness that are
[3:05:26] coming on you?
[3:05:28] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:05:31] The devil don't want you to catch it.
[3:05:33] But I'm going to start it again.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:05:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible say arise and what?
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; So if you shining, who are you?
[3:05:42] &gt;&gt; In plain word, you are a light bulb.
[3:05:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; If you if if if you turn a light bulb
[3:05:49] and you bring that darkness and you
[3:05:51] begin to put around the light bulb, what
[3:05:53] happened to the light bulb?
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; Does he change?
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; No. Does what? What will the light of
[3:06:00] the light bulb do to the darkness?
[3:06:04] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:06:06] &gt;&gt; And David is saying even if I cover
[3:06:09] myself with darkness,
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; all the darkness will turn into what?
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; Because the light of God will take care
[3:06:16] of the darkness.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So according to David,
[3:06:25] whether there is darkness on wrath,
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; it's the same.
[3:06:32] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it yet.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; According to David, if there is no
[3:06:37] darkness,
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; it's day.
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; And David is saying, if you bring
[3:06:42] darkness,
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; it's still day.
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in David there is a light.
[3:06:50] That's why David say even though I walk
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; in the shadow
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; in the valley of the shadow of death.
[3:06:59] If it's a shadow brother say because
[3:07:02] there is light that's why you must have
[3:07:05] a shadow.
[3:07:07] [Music]
[3:07:09] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; You didn't get David be good but you
[3:07:13] going to get him now. The Bible say
[3:07:16] David say yeah the darkness does what?
[3:07:20] not from thee
[3:07:20] &gt;&gt; from God.
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "But the night does what?
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; Shineth as the day."
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; So darkness before God turn into what?
[3:07:29] &gt;&gt; Day.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; And David say darkness
[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; and what?
[3:07:33] &gt;&gt; Light.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; Are what?
[3:07:35] &gt;&gt; Both are like to thee.
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; I hope you understanding.
[3:07:41] &gt;&gt; David is saying if you bring God light,
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; you say what is it? God say it's light.
[3:07:48] Yes.
[3:07:48] &gt;&gt; If you flip, you bring darkness.
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; God say it's light.
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it.
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it yet.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; David is saying for God, whether you
[3:08:03] bring darkness and light, it doesn't
[3:08:06] make any difference.
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; What is the message behind it?
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; God is light.
[3:08:15] around God. We see David saying that
[3:08:17] it's darkness.
[3:08:19] &gt;&gt; And David is saying that the darkness
[3:08:22] that you see around God
[3:08:24] &gt;&gt; is not an obstacle.
[3:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Flight attendant, prepare for landing.
[3:08:35] &gt;&gt; David is saying even though you see
[3:08:38] darkness
[3:08:39] &gt;&gt; around God,
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; that darkness have zero effect.
[3:08:45] on God.
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; Because God is light.
[3:08:51] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, the darkness around God
[3:08:56] is not an obstacle.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; It's not a hindrance.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; Because God when he look at darkness, he
[3:09:04] sees the day.
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; And God is saying you arise
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; and you shine.
[3:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because your light has come.
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; If you shining, you are light.
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; But around you is the darkness of this.
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; But don't let that darkness
[3:09:28] become a hindrance.
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; Because darkness is nothing for you.
[3:09:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are
[3:09:40] together. I hope we are together.
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it, my friend.
[3:09:45] &gt;&gt; When they shooting people,
[3:09:47] &gt;&gt; it brings fear.
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; Which world is going on like this?
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; What is going on in this world?
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; Shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting,
[3:09:55] shooting, shooting. By the brand, say
[3:09:57] it's darkness.
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; But you are light.
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; And light turned darkness in light. In
[3:10:04] other words, whatever is going on around
[3:10:06] God, God doesn't care.
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; Because God passes the darkness and he
[3:10:11] sees the darkness as no hindrance.
[3:10:15] &gt;&gt; So don't let
[3:10:17] hinder you from your season in Laisha.
[3:10:21] [Applause]
[3:10:30] There is a reason why God put you in
[3:10:33] Laisha.
[3:10:34] &gt;&gt; God knows who you are
[3:10:37] &gt;&gt; and knew what is in you
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; and what is in you qualify for laisha.
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:10:43] &gt;&gt; But this is bad.
[3:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; Now this is dark.
[3:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:10:50] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness. But in the midst of
[3:10:53] God's darkness, God say, "Arise,
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; arise
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; and shine."
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because thy light have come.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, my light has come and the glory of
[3:11:03] the Lord has risen upon thee. But there
[3:11:05] are gross darkness around you.
[3:11:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are reflecting the
[3:11:10] throne of God.
[3:11:13] &gt;&gt; God around him is darkness, but the
[3:11:17] light is in him. In other words, the
[3:11:19] throne of God is now in you.
[3:11:24] [Music]
[3:11:24] [Applause]
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[3:11:29] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said the
[3:11:31] throne of God, the third throne is in a
[3:11:34] man
[3:11:35] &gt;&gt; because the light is in you.
[3:11:38] &gt;&gt; Darkness must be around you
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; to vindicate the light.
[3:11:45] [Applause]
[3:11:45] [Music]
[3:11:48] Hallelujah.
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert,
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; if you take this light, you bring it
[3:11:52] outside, what is he going to do?
[3:11:55] &gt;&gt; Because there is light over there.
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; This light to be effective, you need
[3:11:59] what?
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; So for you to be effective.
[3:12:05] [Applause]
[3:12:09] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together for the work.
[3:12:13] You didn't get me.
[3:12:15] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well,
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; if there is light all over you,
[3:12:21] &gt;&gt; people will not know who you are.
[3:12:25] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:12:27] &gt;&gt; For people to know that you are the
[3:12:28] light, you must put darkness.
[3:12:31] &gt;&gt; But your light doesn't require darkness.
[3:12:35] &gt;&gt; It require gross darkness
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; because your intensity is powerful.
[3:12:40] [Applause]
[3:12:44] I hope we are together.
[3:12:45] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Let me go to the
[3:12:48] airport. I can't catch this.
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip something.
[3:12:52] &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say?
[3:12:54] &gt;&gt; No matter what darkness is around you.
[3:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil don't understand.
[3:13:01] &gt;&gt; The devil keep bringing darkness on you.
[3:13:03] But you still survive
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; because in you there is light.
[3:13:11] Amen.
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; We looking at the other side.
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; Back up. I'm heading to the airport.
[3:13:19] Okay. Flight attendant. Let's prepare

[3:13:24] know this one thing.

[3:13:34] &gt;&gt; what do you what do you need to know?
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; Brother say friend
[3:13:40] that Christianity has no negative
[3:13:44] &gt;&gt; nothing to it.
[3:13:46] [Applause]

[3:13:52] next Sunday.
[3:13:53] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so this will soak when you

[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; Because I was trying to drive something
[3:14:00] here
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; then we can let you go.
[3:14:02] &gt;&gt; Brother say
[3:14:04] &gt;&gt; you remembered because we showed you how
[3:14:06] bad our is. Yes.
[3:14:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:14:10] &gt;&gt; And God chose you
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; to put you in the bad environment.
[3:14:16] &gt;&gt; God is not stupid.
[3:14:20] &gt;&gt; God knows what is in you
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; and he prove it by Abraham.
[3:14:25] &gt;&gt; Are are we together?
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; So in order to help you, brother is
[3:14:29] saying this. Even though you are in a
[3:14:31] bad environment,
[3:14:32] &gt;&gt; remember this.
[3:14:35] &gt;&gt; What do you remember? You remember that
[3:14:38] Christianity
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; has what?
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; No negative to it.
[3:14:43] &gt;&gt; In other word, when you are a Christian,
[3:14:46] &gt;&gt; there is nothing negative in that.
[3:14:52] &gt;&gt; I know it's very hard for you to believe
[3:14:55] &gt;&gt; because darkness is around you.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; But remember, darkness around you is not
[3:15:00] different than light.
[3:15:01] &gt;&gt; David said the darkness is the same as
[3:15:04] the light. Both of them are the same.
[3:15:07] &gt;&gt; That's why for you everything is
[3:15:09] positive.
[3:15:11] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:15:13] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[3:15:14] &gt;&gt; because there is no blockage for you.
[3:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's why all things in your life.
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; Work together for good.
[3:15:23] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:15:25] [Applause]
[3:15:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that Christianity
[3:15:30] has what?
[3:15:31] &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it. It is
[3:15:33] everything what?
[3:15:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely positive.
[3:15:37] &gt;&gt; Not positive.
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; In other word, what you call darkness
[3:15:43] &gt;&gt; is positive.
[3:15:46] [Applause]
[3:15:51] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I'm heading to the airport.
[3:15:53] I'm hitting a wall. You fool. You are
[3:15:55] overflowing, my friend. Amen.
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; David say the light.
[3:16:00] &gt;&gt; The light.
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the darkness
[3:16:04] &gt;&gt; before God.
[3:16:05] &gt;&gt; There's no difference.
[3:16:07] &gt;&gt; We are the one that say this is dark.
[3:16:10] &gt;&gt; This is light.
[3:16:11] &gt;&gt; God doesn't care.
[3:16:13] &gt;&gt; When it's day, God flip to a cloud.
[3:16:18] &gt;&gt; And God keep walking.
[3:16:19] &gt;&gt; When it's night,
[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; God turn on and he's a pillar of fire
[3:16:23] and God keep walking.
[3:16:25] &gt;&gt; So whether you change environment, it
[3:16:27] doesn't do anything for God.
[3:16:31] [Applause]
[3:16:35] Yes sir.
[3:16:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:16:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:16:38] &gt;&gt; So if the devil bring darkness in your
[3:16:40] life,
[3:16:41] &gt;&gt; don't worry. It's going to turn to
[3:16:42] light.
[3:16:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, the more trial that come
[3:16:48] your way, the brighter you begin to
[3:16:50] shine.
[3:16:52] &gt;&gt; Because your light require darkness,
[3:16:55] &gt;&gt; your positive require negative.
[3:17:04] That's why you hear brother saying
[3:17:06] tension is a blessing.
[3:17:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:17:09] &gt;&gt; Brother say that Christianity has what?
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's everything what?
[3:17:18] &gt;&gt; Absolutely positive.
[3:17:20] &gt;&gt; How many thing in Christianity are
[3:17:22] positive?
[3:17:24] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[3:17:26] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[3:17:28] Light is what?
[3:17:30] &gt;&gt; Positive.
[3:17:31] &gt;&gt; Darkness is what?
[3:17:33] &gt;&gt; Because in you everything is what?
[3:17:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, it doesn't make a
[3:17:42] difference whether I go through the
[3:17:44] green pasture
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; or the valley of the shadow of death.
[3:17:52] &gt;&gt; I got to stop here. I got to stop. I got
[3:17:55] to stop. That's why Isaiah say
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; okay we hold here because you cannot
[3:18:03] take what is happening
[3:18:04] &gt;&gt; now you push this whole sermon next
[3:18:06] Sunday and add a sermon next Sunday
[3:18:08] let's go to Isaiah 43 and let's finish
[3:18:11] here because you push the sermon next
[3:18:13] Sunday
[3:18:19] yeah
[3:18:20] they said then are already overflowing
[3:18:27] Let's go to Isaiah 43.
[3:18:32] &gt;&gt; They said there are overflowing. You
[3:18:34] take them to the restaurant, you waste
[3:18:36] money.
[3:18:38] Before you know it, to go box to go box
[3:18:40] to go box to go box. They can't finish a
[3:18:42] rack, a full rack, brother John, of of
[3:18:47] ribs.
[3:18:49] And we bringing a full rack of ribs.
[3:18:52] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you back to the earth.
[3:18:53] That's why I'm saying that. So, I'm
[3:18:55] bringing you back to the earth.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 43. Let's stop here.
[3:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get your to-go box.
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:19:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:19:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:08] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43. But now, thus says who?
[3:19:11] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[3:19:12] &gt;&gt; that did what?
[3:19:13] &gt;&gt; Created thee.
[3:19:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, your creator. Oh, who?
[3:19:16] &gt;&gt; Jacob. And he that form you, oh who?
[3:19:19] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[3:19:19] &gt;&gt; If you notice, he's calling you first
[3:19:21] Jacob.
[3:19:22] &gt;&gt; And then he calls you for Abat.
[3:19:24] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; He's calling you. In other words, he was
[3:19:27] the God of you when you were Jacob.
[3:19:30] &gt;&gt; And he's your God when you are Israel.
[3:19:33] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:19:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm calling you, oh Jacob." In
[3:19:38] other words, when you were in your old
[3:19:40] nature,
[3:19:41] &gt;&gt; I was still the one that created you.
[3:19:44] And when you become Israel, you become a
[3:19:47] Christian. I am still your God. I was
[3:19:50] your God before you got converted. And
[3:19:53] I'm your God after you are converted. So
[3:19:55] your entire life is covered.
[3:19:59] &gt;&gt; Even when you didn't know me, I was
[3:20:01] still your God.
[3:20:04] &gt;&gt; Even when you were cheating
[3:20:06] &gt;&gt; like Jacob, I was your God.
[3:20:09] &gt;&gt; When you were dancing in the nightclub,
[3:20:14] when you are telling lies. I was your
[3:20:16] God.
[3:20:17] &gt;&gt; Now that you became Christian, I'm your
[3:20:20] God.
[3:20:21] &gt;&gt; So God say listen Israel.
[3:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:20:24] &gt;&gt; He says but now that who?
[3:20:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[3:20:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord that did what?
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; Redeemed
[3:20:29] &gt;&gt; created you. Who?
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; Your old nature. And he that form you or
[3:20:34] who?
[3:20:34] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[3:20:35] &gt;&gt; Do what?
[3:20:36] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; For I have what?
[3:20:38] &gt;&gt; Redeemed thee.
[3:20:39] &gt;&gt; I have what
[3:20:40] &gt;&gt; called thee by name. And you are what?
[3:20:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:20:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20:54] &gt;&gt; Watch how problem is not problem for
[3:20:56] you.
[3:20:58] &gt;&gt; Verse two. When you press through the
[3:21:00] water,
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; the waters.
[3:21:05] &gt;&gt; I will be where?
[3:21:06] &gt;&gt; With thee. Amen.
[3:21:09] &gt;&gt; So if God goes with you,
[3:21:11] &gt;&gt; what is the word?
[3:21:17] &gt;&gt; When you pass through the waters, I will
[3:21:20] be where?
[3:21:20] &gt;&gt; With thee.
[3:21:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. And through the waters,
[3:21:23] &gt;&gt; the rivers,
[3:21:24] &gt;&gt; they shall not do what?
[3:21:26] &gt;&gt; Overflow thee.
[3:21:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, the water have no power
[3:21:30] on you.
[3:21:31] &gt;&gt; The river has no power on you.
[3:21:33] &gt;&gt; So next time when you see water, what is
[3:21:35] there? Nothing.
[3:21:38] &gt;&gt; When you see a river, what is it?
[3:21:43] &gt;&gt; When you pass through the river, they
[3:21:45] shall not do what?
[3:21:46] &gt;&gt; Overflow to you.
[3:21:47] &gt;&gt; When you walk
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; where?
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; Through the fire.
[3:21:52] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[3:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:53] &gt;&gt; Is that a pleasant thing?
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; When you walk through the water,
[3:21:57] &gt;&gt; the fire,
[3:21:58] &gt;&gt; you shall not be what?
[3:21:59] &gt;&gt; Burned.
[3:22:00] &gt;&gt; If the Because what make us scare for
[3:22:03] the fire
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; is the burning. God is saying there
[3:22:07] there won't be no burning for your fire.
[3:22:09] So when the devil is bringing fire, what
[3:22:11] is it?
[3:22:15] &gt;&gt; What do you do? You walk on it
[3:22:17] &gt;&gt; to show the devil that I can walk on a
[3:22:19] fire
[3:22:20] &gt;&gt; and I cannot get burned
[3:22:22] &gt;&gt; because either fire or no fire, it's the
[3:22:25] same thing.
[3:22:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is bringing you to a
[3:22:28] level
[3:22:29] &gt;&gt; until the de there is nothing that the
[3:22:32] devil can intimidate you with.
[3:22:36] Yes sir.
[3:22:37] &gt;&gt; He says when you pass through the fire
[3:22:40] you shall not be what?
[3:22:42] &gt;&gt; Neither shall the flame do what?
[3:22:44] &gt;&gt; Kindle upon thee.
[3:22:46] &gt;&gt; For I am who?
[3:22:47] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God.
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; The holy one of what?
[3:22:49] &gt;&gt; Of Israel.
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; Your who?
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; Thy savior.
[3:22:51] &gt;&gt; So God is telling you no matter which
[3:22:54] circumstances you going through
[3:22:57] &gt;&gt; the one affect you.
[3:23:01] [Music]
[3:23:03] As a matter of fact, for Nebuchadnezzar
[3:23:05] to recognize who you are, you must walk
[3:23:08] on the fire.
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; When you walk on the fire, the
[3:23:12] Nebuchadnezzar who will realize, these
[3:23:14] are not human being.
[3:23:16] &gt;&gt; These are God who have come in the skin
[3:23:18] of human being.
[3:23:20] &gt;&gt; For people to believe that you are not
[3:23:22] for this world, you must go to the
[3:23:24] lion's den.
[3:23:25] &gt;&gt; When you come out, they say this is not
[3:23:27] a human being. That's right.
[3:23:29] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[3:23:31] &gt;&gt; Let's pause here.
[3:23:33] &gt;&gt; Let's stop here.
[3:23:35] &gt;&gt; Let's pause here.
[3:23:37] &gt;&gt; We painted you the first picture
[3:23:40] &gt;&gt; of Laia. How bad it is.
[3:23:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I was trying to flip the picture.
[3:23:45] &gt;&gt; We could not get it.
[3:23:47] &gt;&gt; But you got the point.
[3:23:48] &gt;&gt; God is in the throne and God is light.
[3:23:52] &gt;&gt; But around God,
[3:23:54] &gt;&gt; there's darkness.
[3:23:56] And David said the darkness that are
[3:23:58] around him means nothing to him.
[3:24:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is not really
[3:24:06] focusing on the darkness
[3:24:09] &gt;&gt; because he is already light.
[3:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:16] &gt;&gt; Let's stop here. Let's stand because if
[3:24:18] I continue overflowing.
[3:24:21] [Applause]
[3:24:29] Season
[3:24:31] season
[3:24:32] &gt;&gt; hidden
[3:24:34] &gt;&gt; in darkness.
[3:24:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is darkness. There is
[3:24:39] darkness. Hold on, Abraham.
[3:24:43] &gt;&gt; Watch the light that is crossing the
[3:24:46] sacrifice.
[3:24:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is darkness. There is
[3:24:49] darkness. Egypt, darkness. People are
[3:24:51] dying all around. Seed of Abraham,
[3:24:54] &gt;&gt; listen to the instruction of Moses
[3:24:57] &gt;&gt; and go do what Moses said because the
[3:24:59] Lord have favored you at midnight.
[3:25:04] &gt;&gt; God,
[3:25:06] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[3:25:08] &gt;&gt; Now, this is dark. The seven seal lose
[3:25:10] the season. That's fine. I'm going to go
[3:25:12] back Lord's will healing next Sunday and
[3:25:14] show you now what is again on the seven
[3:25:16] semen.
[3:25:18] Today you are living with the
[3:25:20] ecclesiastical spirit. But let's come
[3:25:22] next Sunday, Lord's willing, and see
[3:25:24] what is under the seven seal.
[3:25:28] &gt;&gt; But the seven seal cannot operate
[3:25:30] without the ecclesiastical spirit.
[3:25:35] &gt;&gt; So that when you look around, you will
[3:25:37] see darkness.
[3:25:40] &gt;&gt; But remember, when you see darkness,
[3:25:42] there got to be a throne somewhere.
[3:25:44] Amen.
[3:25:46] &gt;&gt; And somebody must be light
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; in the midst of darkness.
[3:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:25:54] &gt;&gt; And let's see what is in there.
[3:25:57] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:25:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[3:26:01] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:26:04] grace, your love, your mercy, and for

[3:26:12] what you have broke, ordained to be
[3:26:14] given and delivered today. Father, we
[3:26:17] felt checked to stop right here so that
[3:26:20] your children can have time to go soak
[3:26:23] in and ponder on what you spoke so that
[3:26:26] your you the Holy Spirit can continue to
[3:26:28] unfold your word. And Lord, Father, if

[3:26:43] Raishia,

[3:26:48] because there is always two side. No, no
[3:26:51] matter how we slice everything, Lord,
[3:26:54] there is a reason why you chose us for
[3:26:56] this age. You took Peter, those that saw
[3:27:00] you, those that walk in the water, you
[3:27:02] put them in the age and you took us and
[3:27:05] you put that in the worst of all.
[3:27:07] &gt;&gt; You know what you are doing and we thank
[3:27:10] you because your program and your
[3:27:12] purpose for our life is perfect. Father,
[3:27:14] we are committing the remaining of this
[3:27:16] day and the oncoming week to the end.
[3:27:19] May your blood continue to protect us.
[3:27:21] Father, may you continue to bless your
[3:27:23] children in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:27:26] Amen.
