[0:00] I said, "Don't don't say no more about
[0:01] him. Let him go. I want to ask you a
[0:03] question." He said, "All right. What is
[0:06] it?" I said, "Do you believe there is a
[0:08] God?" He said, "Certainly, I believe
[0:10] it." Said, "I believe that as strong as
[0:12] you do, I guess, Brother Brandon." I
[0:14] said, "Do you believe that that same God
[0:17] crossed the stream and was made flesh
[0:19] and dwelt among us in the person of
[0:20] Jesus Christ in order to save man?" He
[0:24] said, "Yes, I believe that. and he died
[0:27] to save sinners like you are. Like I
[0:32] Yes, I believe that. I said, "Now, it's
[0:34] just like this. We're all in one big
[0:37] building over here
[0:39] and we're in jail
[0:42] and I can't stand over in this corner
[0:44] and say, "This will help me get out of
[0:45] jail." I stand over in that corner say
[0:47] that'll help me get out of jail. We're
[0:49] all in the same fix. And every man that
[0:52] was born in this world was born in sin,
[0:54] shaped in iniquity, [music] come to the
[0:55] world speaking lies. He's a renegade.

[26:47] Praise God. I do have a couple of praise
[26:50] reports here this morning.
[26:54] First off, the Fali and the Peters
[26:56] family would like to thank everyone and
[26:59] express their sincere thanks and
[27:00] gratitude to all who came out to support
[27:03] the wedding shower for Sister Yokth
[27:05] yesterday.
[27:07] Your fellowship, your words of
[27:09] encouragement and willing hands were
[27:11] truly a blessing.
[27:13] We uh deeply appreciate every act of
[27:16] love that was shown. We pray that the
[27:20] Lord continues to bless each and every
[27:22] one of you as our dear sister enters
[27:24] this season, new season of her life with
[27:28] love and gratitude. Amen. Praise God.
[27:31] Let's give the Lord a hand for that.
[27:33] Amen. Praise the Lord. [applause]
[27:36] Amen.
[27:39] Hallelujah.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[27:41] &gt;&gt; So, I have one here from my daughter
[27:43] Rebecca as well. She said Thursday
[27:45] morning at 5:00 a.m. uh she woke up with
[27:49] UTI symptoms.
[27:51] Um while she was getting ready for work,
[27:54] uh she while she was getting ready for
[27:56] work, she said, "I just talked to the
[27:57] Lord." Said, "Lord, it's too late to
[27:59] call out, you know, um or to go to the
[28:04] doctor, so please just take it away in
[28:07] Jesus name."
[28:09] Chris said, "In Jesus name."
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:14] And
[28:15] she says she's had no memory of it since
[28:18] that point.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; So, she went to work all day and had no
[28:21] more symptoms. Amen. [applause]
[28:24] Amen.
[28:28] I guess that's a pretty unpleasant
[28:31] symptoms.
[28:33] Not sure if I've ever had it, but um I
[28:37] meant to give a little one about my wife
[28:39] on on uh Wednesday when everybody was
[28:42] giving theirs. She's had a she's had
[28:44] some of her wisdom teeth cut out, but
[28:46] not all. And she's had one that's been
[28:47] bothering her for I guess three or four
[28:50] months. She'd just bite down wrong on
[28:52] some food and it would just, you know,
[28:54] shoot the pain through her. And I said,
[28:57] "Well, we she doesn't want to bother our
[29:00] pastor. She feels like he's gotten up on
[29:02] his plate. So, [laughter]
[29:07] so that's true. So, I said, "Well, while
[29:11] you're down in Panama, just have
[29:12] somebody check it out." So, she went and
[29:15] had an X-ray done and they checked it
[29:17] all out for $20.
[29:21] That was kind of why I suggested it,
[29:22] too. But, um, she said that they didn't
[29:25] find anything. So, no updates. I guess
[29:30] everything's fine in her tooth.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; That That's a very unpleasant thing as
[29:36] well. Anybody, especially an abscess,
[29:38] that hurts. [laughter]
[29:42] Amen. I can't get no amen from the
[29:44] singer. Amen. Okay.
[29:48] So, we got a couple of prayer requests.
[29:50] Um, I do want to uh mention my wife
[29:52] again. She has, you know, it's a big
[29:55] family down there. Her mom had 11 on her
[29:57] side. I don't even remember 10 or 11 on
[29:59] her dad's side. So, family just showing
[30:02] up and she had an 80 yearear-old cousin
[30:05] show up from Panama City who's is not in
[30:09] the greatest of health and he's staying
[30:11] a week. So, in addition to caring for
[30:15] her mom and dad and on Sundays the help
[30:18] is not there because they take their day
[30:19] off. So, um, it's just her and her
[30:22] sister from Montreal today with three
[30:25] elderly, one that has to go from the
[30:27] wheelchair to the bed to the bathroom,

[31:01] old man that showed up is a Christian.
[31:02] He's been witnessing to her mother
[31:04] because they're all family." And she
[31:06] said, "I'm getting some good
[31:07] conversation with him about the Bible
[31:09] and all." And I said, "Well, you two
[31:11] talk about it. Jesus has got to show up
[31:13] just like he did on the road to Emmas."
[31:16] I said, "So, we'll just pray for God's
[31:18] will when he gets there." Amen. We also
[31:21] have a prayer here from uh Brother John

[47:23] Brother Glenn will be still working on
[47:24] it. Youngsman meeting. It's November 8th
[47:28] and December 6 backto back. If you
[47:31] cannot make it, you know how to find the
[47:33] deacon after and go watch the the the
[47:37] video to make sure everybody stays on
[47:39] the same page. Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Married couple meeting. It's part eight.
[47:43] will be on December the 13th. We get on

[48:02] &gt;&gt; So prayer meeting on Tuesday. So make
[48:05] sure you got the link. It's the same
[48:07] link. We reuse that link over and over.
[48:10] And I begin to find out this one is not
[48:12] in the group chat. If you're not in the
[48:14] church group chat, it's your
[48:16] responsibility to see the deacon and
[48:18] tell them to incorporate you in the
[48:20] church group chat because every time I'm
[48:22] sending quotes and I'm sending
[48:24] scripture, you're missing everything and
[48:26] before you know it, you wonder. So, make
[48:29] sure you're there. And uh in the in the
[48:31] group chat, if you're not there, the
[48:33] building, you continue to pray, continue
[48:35] to do what you got to do. And the Lord
[48:37] is on our side. Amen. Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert spoke to me about the
[48:42] scent in Jamaica and the people that are
[48:44] uh has been hit pretty hard with this uh
[48:48] hurricane. So, whatever you have at home
[48:51] that you can help. Maybe a cup, maybe a
[48:55] tissue, maybe a napkin or whatever you
[48:58] can that can help the people in Jamaica.
[49:01] Something that you don't need and then
[49:03] you can contribute or something like
[49:05] that. just go ahead and see the deacon
[49:08] and hand it to them. There is a way we
[49:10] can get those stuff all the way to
[49:12] Jamaica to help the people. So if you
[49:14] want to help, you want to bring
[49:16] something, bring it to the church, give
[49:17] it to the deacon and uh they will
[49:20] organize that. There is a way to get
[49:22] stuff to Jamaica. Just give it to the uh
[49:25] I mean a deacon. They know what to do.
[49:27] Amen.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; The brothers are in need. Let's try to
[49:31] do what we can and try to help somebody
[49:34] make their life easy. Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; I believe I got everything clear.
[49:38] Brother Glenn, did I forget anything? So
[49:41] you pray with me because I was trying to
[49:43] move forward and I can't move because
[49:45] the spirit of the Lord open up something
[49:48] else. So whatever it was for this Sunday
[49:51] go Sunday what was for that Sunday move
[49:54] that Sunday what was it? So they got
[49:55] sermon and sermon are just sitting there
[49:58] on on a traffic just waiting for their
[50:00] time. Amen. But I have to follow the
[50:03] leadership of the Holy Spirit. And we
[50:05] have to refocus and balance things
[50:07] correctly because the devil is using
[50:10] ignorance to keep you trapped and accept
[50:13] what is not God's will as God's will and
[50:17] thinking that you are under God's will
[50:19] when you are suffering yourself.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. There was uh a pastor who says
[50:29] uh that they begin to put pressure on
[50:32] the on the country that uh the pastor uh
[50:37] is coming from and he says that he went
[50:39] and closed the church and there was a
[50:42] nail there that say brother Brandham
[50:44] didn't say you will close the church. Uh
[50:47] &gt;&gt; now brother Brandham say they will close
[50:49] the church. Uh so nobody told you to
[50:52] close the church.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[50:54] &gt;&gt; let them come and close the church. So
[50:56] sometime we get things worked up or our
[50:59] own understanding. We didn't study the
[51:02] prophet well and before you know it we
[51:04] cause our own trouble.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; We cause our own trial
[51:08] &gt;&gt; and we think we under the will of the
[51:10] Lord.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; So you would need your Bible.
[51:15] We heard about this before a lot. I
[51:18] don't want to hear from somebody. I want
[51:20] to hear from the Bible
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and I want to hear from the message of
[51:24] the hour. Let the Bible answer itself.
[51:27] So when you leave today, don't say it's
[51:30] already like a law in this church. You
[51:32] never say brother Steven say. You say
[51:34] the Bible says and brother Brandham say
[51:36] amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So you will hear yourself from the Lord
[51:39] Jesus Christ.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; You agree?
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So flat attendant prepare for takeoff.
[51:46] Amen. Let's stand for the reading of the
[51:48] word.
[51:50] my subject this morning. [laughter]
[51:54] Uh
[51:56] I love spoken word. [laughter]
[51:58] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[52:01] are approaching you humbly this morning.
[52:04] Father, again, thanking you for your
[52:06] grace, your love, your mercy, for giving
[52:08] us an extra hour to rest, to sleep,
[52:11] Lord, to come to church refresh and to
[52:14] get ready to listen from thee, Lord.
[52:16] Father, thank you for brothers and
[52:18] sister, people of like precious faith
[52:20] that we can see, we can sit, we can
[52:22] fellowship, we can smile, people that
[52:24] believe like us and people that we will
[52:26] spend all eternity with them, Lord.
[52:29] Father, we thank you for this great
[52:31] privilege that you have given us.
[52:33] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[52:35] the ability you have given me. But when
[52:37] it comes to ministering to your
[52:39] children, Father, he only take the
[52:42] supernatural action of the Holy Spirit
[52:44] because I'm not capable. Father, that's
[52:46] why I'm asking you to come and move me
[52:48] away. Move the audience both visible and
[52:51] invisible out of the place. May you come
[52:54] yourself and be the one speaking,
[52:56] blessing, filling, teaching. And may you
[52:58] minister to us according to our need. We
[53:01] are committing everything and rebuking
[53:03] every demonic spirit contrary to the
[53:06] nature of the Holy Spirit away from this
[53:08] place. May everybody be under the
[53:10] supervision of the spirit in the name of
[53:13] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; My subject this morning, you can turn to
[53:20] Genesis 1, is our life journey through
[53:24] Joseph's five garment part 85,
[53:29] [laughter]
[53:30] &gt;&gt; 8 eternity, five grace. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; My theme, if we can get to that, is
[53:38] seasons.
[53:44] So decrease the movement.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; If you need the quote, I got a quote.
[53:50] Decrease the movement. Let's stay
[53:52] focused. Season for
[53:57] a forerunner.
[54:00] Forun and prepare.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Others.
[54:10] In other words, a season
[54:12] forun another season
[54:15] &gt;&gt; and prepare that season.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; If you in a season, just know there is
[54:21] another one.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; If not, you're going to miss the next
[54:26] one.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis one. If you there,
[54:33] you can say amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before I read that, let me read
[54:37] this quote because I want you to keep
[54:39] this in mind. Brother Brandham says in
[54:42] the message the testimony of a true
[54:44] witness. You can call that title a
[54:47] season for run and prepare another
[54:50] season if you want to. And today that
[54:54] give us a great testimony as a witness
[54:57] of God's creation because that when we
[55:00] are in the season of water,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; mortal life. So this season is a mortal
[55:05] life
[55:05] &gt;&gt; but within this season we got seasons.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; He say in the season of mortal life what
[55:12] do we do there?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Raising our children
[55:14] &gt;&gt; and doing what?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Marrying
[55:16] &gt;&gt; and what?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Bringing forth families.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So don't try to be overspiritual.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Get married.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Let me leave it alone.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Oh are we are we in the season of
[55:29] immortal? [screaming]
[55:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; In this season we eat. create.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; So there is a time to go eat.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; There is a time to read the Bible and
[55:41] there is a time to close the Bible
[55:44] &gt;&gt; and go eat natural food.
[55:52] [laughter]
[55:54] &gt;&gt; That's when we are in the season of
[55:56] what?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Mortal life.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Doing what?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Raising our children
[55:59] &gt;&gt; and what? marrying
[56:01] &gt;&gt; right sister and doing what?
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Bringing forth families.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; This is a life or the season of water,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; mortal life.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; But when we have been born of above,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; the body does what?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Returns to the dust where it come
[56:16] &gt;&gt; and then the spirit goes down to where
[56:18] he came from and goes up rather to where
[56:22] he come from to God who did what?
[56:24] &gt;&gt; David. And there will come another water
[56:27] &gt;&gt; season. And that season that will come
[56:29] will be what?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; The immortal season.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; I already gave you this quote. I gave
[56:34] you two of them. I just did this to
[56:36] refresh you. So we got mortal season and
[56:40] immortal season. We clear on that one.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; So there is a season of mortality,
[56:46] mortal and then immortal.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Immortal.
[56:53] immortal season.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; But remember one season.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; How many season does brother Brandham
[57:06] say?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And what?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Immortal.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And remember one season forun.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; We are already in the mortal.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So the mortal is already forerunning
[57:18] &gt;&gt; and it's also preparing
[57:21] &gt;&gt; for immortality.
[57:23] So you are preparing immortality now.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; You already got the message now.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; We clear now. So let's go to Genesis 1.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 verse 26
[57:38] &gt;&gt; with the word the way he comes here. If
[57:41] you sleeping it's a demon.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; God. The the the easiest example I can
[57:49] get for you is you sitting on a
[57:52] restaurant outback restaurant and they
[57:55] bringing a big steak
[57:58] &gt;&gt; and then you begin to slumber.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Do you sleep at a restaurant?
[58:02] &gt;&gt; So how can you sleep in a church?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; No, never.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; All right, I already prayed. Genesis 1
[58:16] &gt;&gt; verse uh
[58:17] &gt;&gt; 26
[58:18] &gt;&gt; 26
[58:20] &gt;&gt; she said Sharon I'm just getting warm up
[58:24] &gt;&gt; because when I do all of this she say
[58:26] you you losing time keep moving she said
[58:29] I told her I said you need to get here
[58:31] and understand what we go through with
[58:35] this anointing you don't know how to get
[58:38] it [laughter]
[58:39] you taking a mortal man
[58:42] and trying to handle a BIG GOD.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; You need to vent somehow.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Uh Genesis 1 verse 26. If you dare, you
[58:55] can say amen.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And God said, you might
[59:00] be seated."
[59:02] [laughter]
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Your prayer has been answered.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; He say, "And God did what?" said,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; "Let us make man in what?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Our image
[59:14] &gt;&gt; after what?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Our likeness."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And let them plural.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; You, we already went through this
[59:20] several times.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Let them do what?
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Have dominion.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; So the creation of a man
[59:29] &gt;&gt; is already combined with a
[59:31] responsibility.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't say, "Let us create a
[59:40] man." And that's it.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Let us create a man. And God
[59:45] automatically push the purpose.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Push the the the the
[59:56] assignment
[59:58] &gt;&gt; of that man all together.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, man is coming up with a
[1:00:02] purpose.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Man is coming up with his assignment.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; In plain word, God never created man to
[1:00:12] be
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; idol.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Man was created WITH A WORK.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; All for work.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Forward.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He says them, right?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; So he includes women. Yes.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Push your brake. Push your brake. I know
[1:00:38] message believer. Hey, hold on. I know
[1:00:41] message believer. I know the place of a
[1:00:43] woman is in the kitchen. I will get to
[1:00:45] that. [laughter]
[1:00:47] Slow down. Let's Let's keep moving. I
[1:00:50] know message believer when you push like
[1:00:51] this. Ah, swallow.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "And God say, let us make man
[1:01:00] how? in our image,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; after our own likeness, after our
[1:01:04] likeness, and let them
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; both of them do what?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Have dominion
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; over what?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; The fish of the sea.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; So man is created to have dominion.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; So he's not just created to be men.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. When God is creating man
[1:01:18] is for man to do something.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; So man,
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; remember this man is double, right?
[1:01:29] Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Is male and female.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Man is created for what?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Dominion.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Continue. And what else?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Over the fish of the sea.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And over the foul of the air.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And over the cattle.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And over all the earth.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; If you notice, all those things were
[1:01:49] created before men.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; So God already put his job
[1:02:03] Don't you love the Bible?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; There are some the job already was
[1:02:10] there.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; So man is coming into the job
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; because God is so busy
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; with the universe
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to give somebody a charge
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; of the earth. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; We clear right?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; So the job the task of a man already
[1:02:35] existed
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; before man came.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; So man is born with a task.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's why work is divine.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I have quotes my friend. Uh
[1:02:55] uh drop to verse 22. So God created who?
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Man how?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; In his own image.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; If the man that is created in the image
[1:03:05] and likeness of God is a worker, what do
[1:03:08] you think God is?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. And the in the image of
[1:03:17] God created he him. How
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; male?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Male and what?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Female
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; created he what? them.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Remember in this part here they were
[1:03:27] spiritual.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; You know that
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; but even when they were spiritual they
[1:03:34] were working
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say Adam was leading
[1:03:41] the animals
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; like the Holy Spirit was leading the
[1:03:46] church.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; So Adam was working in the spirit.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Follow me. And Eve was working in the
[1:03:52] spirit. Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I will get to your kitchen. I will get
[1:03:57] to your kitchen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I will get to your kitchen. Job to verse
[1:04:02] 28. And God did what?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Bless them.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Let's see the blessing of God.
[1:04:10] Because when we say bless them, we say I
[1:04:12] bless you. I bless you. I bless. No, no,
[1:04:15] no, no. God when he was blessing them,
[1:04:16] he was saying something. What is the
[1:04:18] blessing?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; He said and God blessed them. And what
[1:04:23] did he say?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; He said unto them,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; uhhuh,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; be fruitful and multiply.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Ah, let's go slowly. Be what?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Fruitful.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; So man cannot just come and without
[1:04:33] fruit.
[1:04:43] So when God say be fruitful there must
[1:04:44] be fruit in you.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; So so every so your package is coming
[1:04:50] with your with your creation.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; God say be what? Fruitful. Uh-huh.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So if you not fruitful, we need to go
[1:05:00] back to God.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; If what I'm doing is not fruitful, I
[1:05:09] need to go back to my savior. Don't
[1:05:11] worry. I'm going to help you continue my
[1:05:13] friend.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And multiply.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And multiply.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Ah, so man has also another
[1:05:18] responsibility to do what?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Multiply.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Replenish the earth.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And replenish the Why didn't God
[1:05:27] replenish it?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Replenish. And do what?
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And subdue it.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; And subdue it. And what else?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And have dominion over the
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And have dominion back again. So all of
[1:05:40] these are responsibility of a man
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; who is male and female
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; because God bless them
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; not God bless him,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; God bless her them.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; So a sister spiritually is blessed.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; We clear. Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; We clear. Amen. He says, "And uh and the
[1:06:10] living and and the foul of the air and
[1:06:12] over the living thing that moveth upon
[1:06:14] what?"
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The earth.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; So the man that God created was not
[1:06:19] created to be lazy.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; He was created to be a working man.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one?
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, the problem is the kitchen and
[1:06:31] who stay in the kitchen and everything.
[1:06:33] Let's go to Genesis 2.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; All right. In Genesis 2, because man is
[1:06:41] created for work, so his creator must be
[1:06:43] a worker himself.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Jesus had a job?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You did. Is that a I have the Bible
[1:06:53] scripture. Do you know that Jesus had a
[1:06:56] job
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; and he was recognized by his job?
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible say the carpenter.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; It's written in your Bible.
[1:07:06] So your so your maker was doing this.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Your your maker
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; was doing this and then you go see him
[1:07:17] [cheering]
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; and then he take a break
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; and he go eat his lunch
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; but he's still God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[1:07:33] Hey, [clears throat] I don't know where
[1:07:34] message believer get stuff. My friend,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; we are on verse two. Thus the heaven and
[1:07:39] the earth were what?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Finish.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; If they were finished, somebody was
[1:07:42] working on them.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody was constructing was building
[1:07:48] and he finished his building. That's why
[1:07:50] they say they were finished. They
[1:07:52] finished the building. Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; They were finished and all the host of
[1:07:56] them. And on the seventh day, God did
[1:08:00] what?
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Ended his work. ended what?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; His work.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; So God was doing what?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Working.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; So work is what is divine.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with sin.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; It is not that we working because we
[1:08:15] fail. No.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Work existed before sin.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Before the fall, work already existed.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; So don't think you will go to heaven and
[1:08:25] sit and do nothing.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] Do you see we are refocusing your
[1:08:35] heaven?

[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Seal the ground.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; So we left the spiritual man. We are now

[1:33:14] CHURCH, GOD IS SENDING A TEACHING SHOWER
[1:33:17] OF THE SEASON TO TRANSFORM OUR
[1:33:20] WILDERNESS.
[1:33:23] [screaming]
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T SEND HIS WORD VOID. NO,
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; HE SENDED SO HE WILL FULFILL SOMETHING.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WILL REALIZE WHERE THEY ARE
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; AND BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Uh Proverb 6. My friend,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; please turn your clock off. You already
[1:33:54] got one hour of sleep.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; So, let's go with uh Proverbs 6. Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Verse six. If you dare, you can say
[1:34:04] amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Mhm. The Bible say, "Go to who?"
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; The ant.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; You who?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Consider her ways.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; The lazy man.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And be what?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; We already seen that there is a wisdom
[1:34:16] in the ant.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And it was a divine wisdom.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Because the ant have no ruler, nobody,
[1:34:21] but they know how to function. By the
[1:34:23] brand say it's an instinct that God use.
[1:34:25] We already went through that.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Verse seven, which have what?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; No God. No supervisor. Continue.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Overseer.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; No supervisor. Continue.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Or ruler.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Or ruler. But provide what?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Her meat
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; when?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; In the summer.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Gatherth her food.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; In the water.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; In the harvest.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; You know the harvest means fall.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; So the ant is working when
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Works in the summer.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And it's working when?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; In the fall.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And they are working for which month?
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So winter for the ANT IS IN THE
[1:35:00] SUMMER.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Please.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; The ant is living
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; right
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and eating
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; in the summer and in the fall.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; If you see the ant in the summer, they
[1:35:21] are going to Walmart too. They buy
[1:35:23] groceries, but they are in another
[1:35:26] season. Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; They are also preparing a season.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SUMMER IS ALREADY telling
[1:35:32] them it's too hot.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; So there got to be a cold coming up.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; SO AS THEY ARE GOING TO their normal
[1:35:40] routine life,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AS THEY GOING THROUGH
[1:35:47] their normal routine life,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; they already looking ahead.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; They are looking ahead of winter.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; So winter is in summer and fall.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN WINTER THERE IS NO WORK.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And maybe somebody's lost. The GPS is
[1:36:15] lost.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; They are they ain't work when
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; In the fall. THEY ARE WORKING HERE TO
[1:36:23] STORE.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; They are storing.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; they are saving.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; And they ARE SAVING TO USE WHEN?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; IN THE WINTER.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; SO THE JOY OF WINTER IS IN THE SUMMER.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we're together.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; THE FOOD OF WINTER IS IN THE SUMMER.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; THE PROSPERITY OF WINTER
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; is in THE SUMMER.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU DON'T WATCH SUMMER CORRECTLY,
[1:36:50] YES, SIR. YOU WILL CRY IN THE WINTER.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR RETIREMENT IS
[1:36:57] PREPARED WHEN YOU WORKING.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; But somebody's lost.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. God himself, look at
[1:37:08] what he did to Israel. So he helped
[1:37:10] somebody so we can climb higher. In
[1:37:13] Exodus 16:22, the Bible says, "And it
[1:37:17] came to pass that on the water
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; on the SIXTH DAY
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; THEY GATHERED WATER,
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; twice as much bread."
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Because Israel when they were GOING INTO
[1:37:24] THE WILDERNESS EVERY DAY,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; EVERY DAY
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL bring mana.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPORTION OF MANA WAS TO EAT
[1:37:32] ONE TIME,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; one meal per person.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; IF YOU KEEP IT, THE NEXT DAY IS THANK.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; SO MONDAY, ONE MEAL.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; ONE MEAL. TUESDAY, one meal.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; WEDNESDAY, ONE MEAL.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; THURSDAY, one meal. FRIDAY, ONE MEAL.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; SATURDAY, FOR SOME REASON,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN ISRAEL CAME UP,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; THEY SEEN THAT THE MEAL THAT CAME UP ON
[1:37:57] SATURDAY
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; IS DOUBLE.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO KNOW WHY WAS THE MEAL
[1:38:07] DOUBLED.
[1:38:09] SO THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THEY GATHERED HOW
[1:38:11] MUCH?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; TWICE AS MUCH BREAD.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; How many?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Two for one man.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Because an was for one man. AND ALL THE
[1:38:18] RULERS OF THE congregation came and did
[1:38:20] what?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, they didn't understand
[1:38:22] this. They took it to Moses. They say
[1:38:24] Moses something strange is going on
[1:38:26] today. Uh we gathered twice what we are
[1:38:30] supposed to gather. So we come to ask
[1:38:32] what is the meaning of this? And verse
[1:38:34] 23, and Moses say, and he says unto
[1:38:36] them, water. This is that which the
[1:38:38] Lord,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; in other words, the interpretation of
[1:38:40] what they experiencing. This is that
[1:38:43] which the LORD HAS SAID. TOMORROW IS
[1:38:45] WHAT?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; The rest.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; The winter. Are we together?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Of the water.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Holy Sabbath unto THE LORD.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; BECK THAT which ye shall beg today, and
[1:38:56] sift that ye will sie, and that which
[1:38:59] remain overlay o over
[1:39:03] lay up FOR YOU TO KEEP IT UNTIL WHAT?
[1:39:05] MORNING.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; SO MOSES IS TELLING THEM THERE IS A
[1:39:08] REASON WHY YOU GOT THE BLESSING DOUBLE.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; THE BLESSING DOUBLE IS A LANGUAGE.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST BLESSING IS FOR THE DAY.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; BUT THE DOUBLING BLESSING, GOD IS
[1:39:30] PREPARING ANOTHER SEASON. HE'S PREPARING
[1:39:33] ANOTHER DAY.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE SEVENTH DAY
[1:39:37] WAS IN THE SIXTH DAY.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Is that too hard?
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THAT AND THEY LAID IT
[1:39:49] UNTIL WHAT?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; THE MORNING
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; as Moses bed AND IT DID NOT WHAT?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; STINK.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; NEITHER THERE WAS WHAT
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; ANY WORM THERE.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; THEY found out in the morning it didn't
[1:39:58] stink.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; SO GOD WAS PRESERVING THAT ALL THE WAY
[1:40:01] to the seventh day. THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND
[1:40:03] MOSES SAYS TO THEM WHAT?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; EAT THAT TODAY.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; FOR TH FOR TODAY IS WHAT?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The Sabbath unto THE LORD.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; TODAY YOU SHALL NOT FIND IT WHERE?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; IN THE FIELD."
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN PRAY GOD ALL YOU WANT ON THE
[1:40:16] SABBATH.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; YOUR PRAYER WILL BE ANSWERED AS A NO
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SABBATH WAS ALREADY GIVEN ON THE
[1:40:29] SIXTH DAY.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HE SAID, "YOU SHALL NOT
[1:40:36] FIND IT IN THE FIELD." SIXTH DAY, YOU
[1:40:38] SHALL DO WHAT?
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; GATHER IT.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY, WHICH IS WHAT?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; THE SABBATH.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; IT SHALL BE WHAT?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; NONE.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU GET THE SIXTH DAY, GOD TAKE
[1:40:47] THE BLESSING OF THE SEVENTH DAY AND PUT
[1:40:50] IT ON THE SIXTH DAY. SO YOU MUST BE
[1:40:52] CAREFUL HOW YOU BEHAVING ON THE SIXTH
[1:40:54] DAY.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; IF NOT, YOU GOING TO STARVE ON THE
[1:40:57] SEVENTH DAY.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MONEY IS COMING AROUND, A LOT OF
[1:41:02] MONEY HAS BEEN POURED.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO OPEN YOUR EYES.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A TIME [screaming] OF
[1:41:09] SPENDING, SPENDING, SPENDING.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; GOD IS DOUBLING FOR A REASON.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. [cheering]

[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL ALREADY BEGIN TO PREPARE A
[1:42:17] DEPOSIT FOR YOUR HOUSE.

[1:42:26] thing. YES, SIR.

[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL HAVE AN EXTRA $2,000. AND
[1:42:37] BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU CAN NOW BEGIN TO
[1:42:39] THINK ABOUT A HOUSE.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; SO, THE HOUSE CAME AS A DOUBLE BLESSING.

[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:54] THE BIBLE SAID the ant prepared the meat
[1:42:56] when
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and then what?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Gathers in the
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; To use it in the winter. Listen to what

[1:43:05] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY SOMETIME WE READ

[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO DO WHAT?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE JUST THINK THEY CAN MAKE
[1:43:17] THEIR LIVING WITHOUT
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; WORKING.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; You already understand THIS NOW. BUT I
[1:43:22] THINK SOLOMON IT WAS THAT SAID WE COULD
[1:43:25] FIND HERE WHAT
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; THE ANSWER.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE ANSWER?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; IN WATCHING AN ANT.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ANT IS WORKING WHEN
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; IN THE SUMMER
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; AND IN A FALL PREPARING FOR WHAT?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; WINTER.

[1:43:51] YOU MUST WORK AND SAVE.
[1:43:56] [laughter]
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. If you struggle financially
[1:44:03] in this church, it will be your own
[1:44:05] problem.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those that are going to be
[1:44:09] invisible will suck discernment and be
[1:44:11] delivered.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; And you who sit under it will suffer.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. ACCORDING TO THE ANT PROBLEM SAYS
[1:44:20] THE ANSWER IS AT THE end
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; and according to the ant community
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; if YOU WORK YOU MUST ALSO DO WHAT?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST ALSO SAVE.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THERE IS A PRINCIPLE THAT GOES
[1:44:35] WITH THE ANT COMMUNITY. IN THE ANT
[1:44:38] COMMUNITY THEY ARE WORKERS.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ARE ALSO SAVERS.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU DON'T WORK AND WHEN LAYING
[1:44:49] THAT ANT DOES NOT WHAT
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; EAT THAT WINTER. We you you see brother

[1:45:15] all the time
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; and the and the ant was working. BUT
[1:45:18] WHEN WINTER came
[1:45:22] The game changed.

[1:45:25] "CAN I have food for the ant?" Say, "No,
[1:45:26] no, no, no, no, no, no. WHEN I WAS
[1:45:28] WORKING, YOU were singing.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS WORKING, YOU WERE IN THE
[1:45:31] MALL.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Let's continue." AMEN. HE SAID THAT ANT
[1:45:40] DOES NOT EAT WATER
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; THAT WINTER.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; SO, EVERYBODY HAS TO DO WHAT?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T CALL THE ANT MEAN.
[1:45:49] HEY,

[1:45:55] WILL HELP.

[1:58:18] Holy Ghost have to straighten up all of
[1:58:21] this.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; We need to have a clear balance.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Laisia is an age that everything they
[1:58:28] have need of nothing. We went through
[1:58:31] that with married couple meeting.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; We are we are we are rich. We are this
[1:58:36] this we have need of nothing. Are we
[1:58:37] together? So the prophet of God coming
[1:58:40] have to rebuke the age
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; because now this shall kick God outside.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; God is outside the church
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; but the church is rich. That's why this
[1:58:51] is receiving a rebuke
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; but we are not kicking God outside.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; We are keeping God inside. So we need to
[1:58:59] know who we who are keeping God inside.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS OUR FAITH?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FAITH OF THE REBUKE OF
[1:59:06] PROSPERITY IS LIVING GOD.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DIDN'T LEAVE GOD.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; WE ARE JOB.

[2:05:08] check, buy the house." They went cash
[2:05:10] the check, bought the house, fix the
[2:05:12] house. They saw the house in $600,000
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; and they bought the next house and then
[2:05:17] double and the next wife and then
[2:05:19] double. And brother Brandham say he
[2:05:20] begin to own a company
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; and the company have 1,500
[2:05:26] employees.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. THE MAN BECAME SO
[2:05:29] RICH
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE TOLD, "BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[2:05:32] WHENEVER YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN, IF
[2:05:34] SOMETHING IS NEEDED, CALL ME. I WILL
[2:05:37] SUSTAIN THE CAMPAIGN. THIS IS THE GOD
[2:05:39] I'M SERVING.
[2:05:44] [cheering]
[2:05:46] [applause]
[2:05:49] Are we together?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO, LET'S PUT THINGS IN
[2:05:53] THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; IF you have a hard time,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; swallow what is coming up. Let's go to
[2:06:00] first king.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Chapter 3.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Father, help me to get where I'm trying
[2:06:06] to go.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; First king, chapter 3. If you there, you
[2:06:09] can say amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 5. If you there, you can say amen.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. In Gibian,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; the Lord appeared to Solomon.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The Lord appeared to Solomon
[2:06:17] where? in a dream by night.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; You understand this? And God say what?
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Ask what I shall give thee.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Job to verse uh seven.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; And now, oh Lord my God.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Thou hast made thy servant king instead
[2:06:30] of David my father.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And I am but a little child.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; You know this. Uh-huh.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I know not how to go out or in.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; And thy servant is in the midst of thy
[2:06:40] people,
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; your people,
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; which thou has chosen
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; a great peoplehu
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; that cannot be numbered.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Remember cannot be numbered for
[2:06:47] multitude. continue
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; nor counted for much.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; I give your servant what?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Understanding
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; and understanding what
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; heart.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; God say ask.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Did he say what to ask?
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Solomon say ask for what?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; An understanding heart.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Understanding
[2:07:06] heart. Now we need to understand heart.
[2:07:10] Understanding heart. We already told you
[2:07:12] it's wisdom. But we got children that
[2:07:14] are growing up. They need to know where
[2:07:16] are we getting the word wisdom from.
[2:07:19] Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; They call it here because the king and
[2:07:24] the chronicle are the same.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; But one give you more detail to
[2:07:28] understand things better.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; So keep your finger here. Let's go to 2
[2:07:34] Chronicle 1.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Go search John Shar and go read it
[2:07:48] yourself.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; But don't worry, something is coming up.
[2:07:56] First King uh 2 Kings chapter 1. If you
[2:07:58] dare, you can say amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 7 again, my friend.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Second Chronicles.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, 2 Chronicle, I'm sorry. Chapter one,
[2:08:05] verse 7. And in that night did God
[2:08:08] appear to who? You see here they say in
[2:08:11] the night but in the kings they say in
[2:08:13] the dream. So sometime you need both
[2:08:16] stories
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; to put everything together especially
[2:08:19] minister read both stories to put them
[2:08:21] together.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; He says in that night did God appear to
[2:08:25] Solomon and say to him ask what I shall
[2:08:27] what
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; give thee.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; We clear on that one.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 10. He said give me now
[2:08:33] what?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Do you understand now?
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; The same story here they calling that
[2:08:39] what? wisdom.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; We clear now young people. You
[2:08:41] understand now? So don't say, "Brother,
[2:08:43] brother, I'm saying something that was
[2:08:44] not it's right here in the Bible."
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; The problem is you got to know where to
[2:08:47] find it.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; He say, "Give me now what?
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Wisdom
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; and what?"
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; And knowledge.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Do you see what where it is and jump to
[2:08:54] verse 11?
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; And God said to Solomon,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; "Uh-huh.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Because this was in thine heart,
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; yeah, give me wisdom
[2:09:03] and what?
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Knowledge."
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; You see, they call it wisdom and
[2:09:06] knowledge.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] And you can call this knowledge here.
[2:09:10] They call it understanding.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; We clear now?
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; I know why I'm saying that.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And continue verse 11. And God say,
[2:09:18] "Because you did not ask." What Solomon
[2:09:21] did not ask.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, riches.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. What?
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Riches.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Riches and what?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Wealth.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Wealth. So, we can put riches and wealth
[2:09:30] together, right?
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue, my friend.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Or honor.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; And honor. And what else? nor the life
[2:09:36] of thine enemies.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Life of enemy because if the life of
[2:09:40] enemies and what else?
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Neither yet has asked long life
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; and long life.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Anything else?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; So there are one we put this one, two,
[2:09:50] three, four. We clear so far.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Now let's go back to first king chapter
[2:09:55] three where we were.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; If you there you can say amen.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; All right. Jump to verse uh 11. The
[2:10:07] Bible says
[2:10:09] because you have not because you ask uh
[2:10:13] uh verse 10, I'm sorry. And the speech
[2:10:16] did what?
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Please the Lord.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; So it pleased THE LORD THAT SOLOMON
[2:10:20] ASKED FOR WHAT?
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; For wisdom. We clear
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; or understanding of a heart. We clear so
[2:10:28] far?
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; He pleased the Lord THAT SOLOMON HAS
[2:10:32] ASKED WHAT? for wisdom and knowledge.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Verse 10.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. And the speech pleased the
[2:10:38] Lord that Solomon has asked this thing.
[2:10:41] SO WHEN SOLOMON SAID, "GIVE ME WISDOM."
[2:10:45] GOD WAS SO HAPPY. HE SAID, "GLORY,
[2:10:48] HALLELUJAH, SOLOMON.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's why I love you since you were
[2:10:52] born
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW TO ASK."
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW GOD IS COMING UP WITH
[2:11:01] SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SPIRITUAL.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; We talked about this last Sunday because
[2:11:06] Solomon came with spiritual
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; and God is the one that brought every
[2:11:10] stuff.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; OKAY. GOD SAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE ASKED
[2:11:15] WHAT this thing wisdom and have not
[2:11:17] asked for yourself what
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; long life
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; what
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; neither has asked riches for thyself
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; the life of thine enemies.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; But has asked for thyself understanding
[2:11:26] to DISCERN JUDGMENT. SO GOD IS TELLING
[2:11:29] SOLOMON WHAT SOLOMON DID NOT ASK.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; BUT SOLOMON asked for wisdom. Now I HAVE
[2:11:37] A QUESTION. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
[2:11:40] WISDOM
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT MONEY?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS TALKING ABOUT WEALTH. AND GOD
[2:11:53] IS TALKING ABOUT LONG LIFE. AND GOD IS
[2:11:56] TALKING ABOUT LIFE OF THE ENEMY. AND GOD
[2:11:59] IS TALKING ABOUT HONOR.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON ASKED SOMETHING SPIRITUAL. AND
[2:12:05] GOD BEGIN TO BRING HONOR and wealth. And
[2:12:09] what? And the ONE WHO'S BRINGING THIS
[2:12:11] ADAM IS NOT SOLOMON.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD WHO'S SELECTING OUT OF
[2:12:17] EVERYTHING GOD CAN SAY. GOD HAVE
[2:12:21] SELECTED FOUR.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He selected riches and
[2:12:26] health, wealth. He selected honor. He
[2:12:29] selected life of the enemy. And he
[2:12:31] selected long life. AND GOD SELECTED
[2:12:34] THEM AFTER HIS SON ASKED FOR WISDOM.
[2:12:37] WHY?
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belts, my friend. Why?
[2:12:44] SOMEBODY. SO, SO IT'S LIKE I'M TALKING
[2:12:48] about uh I'm in I'm in food and you came
[2:12:51] up and you begin to talk about a car.
[2:12:54] I mean, we talking about
[2:12:57] I mean discernment. We're talking about
[2:12:59] wisdom to to to judge, to lead God's
[2:13:03] people. And you leave us AND AND YOU
[2:13:05] TAKE US FROM OUR SPIRITUAL CONSECRATED
[2:13:08] SIDE AND YOU PUT US here about money,
[2:13:11] about wealth, about honor. I mean, WHAT
[2:13:15] GOD WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THIS SUBJECT UP
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUAL
[2:13:22] STUFF? AMEN.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TOLD SOLOMON, "BECAUSE YOU
[2:13:29] DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT."
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED FOR MONEY,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; I'M heading now.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Put your SEAT BELT NOW.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED GOD OF LONG
[2:13:40] LIFE.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON COULD HAVE ASKED GOD OF HONOR.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; BUT SOLOMON REJECTED ALL OF THAT
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; AND ASKED FOR WISDOM. AND GOD SAID,
[2:13:50] "BECAUSE YOU ASK FOR WISDOM, ARE YOU
[2:13:52] FOLLOWING ME? BUT YOU DID NOT ASK FOR
[2:13:55] THIS. THESE THINGS GO TOGETHER.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go slow. And I I know I
[2:14:04] know some of you are sitting to see
[2:14:06] where am I coming from and everything.
[2:14:09] Are we together?
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ASK GOD FOR A BABY.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:14:20] [applause] Brother
[2:14:22] uh brother Joshua, you can ask God. You
[2:14:25] can go to God and say, "Lord Jesus
[2:14:27] Christ, please give me a baby."
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; You didn't do anything wrong.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can ask God. You say, "Lord
[2:14:34] Jesus Christ, I also want to have
[2:14:36] somebody who can cook for me good food."
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a desire. You can also say,
[2:14:43] "God, I'm also asking you to give me
[2:14:46] somebody who when I'm going through a
[2:14:50] lot of stuff, that person can sit beside
[2:14:52] me and share with me." You know what I'm
[2:14:54] saying? God,
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother Josh? AND YOU
[2:15:00] CAN ASK GOD, YOU SAY, "GOD, ALSO I'M
[2:15:03] GOING TO MOVE TO my own house and I WANT
[2:15:05] TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHEN I COME, THEY CAN
[2:15:07] TAKE CARE OF my house very good and they
[2:15:10] can clean UP EVERYTHING."
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH DETAIL.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN SUMMARIZE [screaming]
[2:15:16] ALL THE PETITION IN ONE.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU HAVE TO ASK IS GIVE ME A GOOD
[2:15:24] WIFE. [cheering]
[2:15:26] [applause]
[2:15:30] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF A GOOD WIFE COME, THE COOKING
[2:15:36] WILL COME,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; THE BABY WILL COME, THE CLEANING OF THE
[2:15:40] HOUSE WILL COME, THE COMFORT WILL COME,
[2:15:42] THE FELLOWSHIP WILL COME. BECAUSE YOU
[2:15:45] [screaming] ASK FOR A WIFE AND NOT FOR A
[2:15:48] BABY, I'M GOING TO ADD BABY. I'M GOING
[2:15:50] TO ADD COOKER. I'M GOING TO ADD
[2:15:52] EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE TWO COMES
[2:15:55] TOGETHER. [screaming]
[2:15:56] AMEN. [cheering]
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; YOUR WORK IS TOO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S A
[2:16:06] SURGERY. YOU GOT TO GO SLOWLY.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; SO, brother Steven.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; So, you mean
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus?
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; You mean this is your deduction. We
[2:16:16] understand the example. It makes sense
[2:16:18] what you just explained, brother Joshua.
[2:16:20] I understand that. But my point is, so
[2:16:23] you mean wisdom
[2:16:26] goes with money
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; and wisdom goes with this.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb.
[2:16:33] [laughter]
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb chapter
[2:16:38] 4. If you there, you can say amen.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Your surgery is a big one.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; When I'm at home, I'm looking at this.
[2:16:47] Ting ting ting ting thing. We go. When I
[2:16:49] get here,
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Proverb chapter 4. If you there, you can
[2:16:56] say amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON ASKED GOD for what?
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; And God say what?
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Wealth.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Wealth and this and this and this and
[2:17:05] this. I'M GOING TO GIVE it to you. God
[2:17:08] didn't say because you didn't ask for
[2:17:10] this and you asked for wisdom, you are a
[2:17:13] very spiritual young man. I will avoid
[2:17:16] you these things
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; but I will give you wisdom
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; so that wisdom you go with it. Okay,
[2:17:22] Solomon, but not this thing because
[2:17:24] somebody else would have asked me these
[2:17:26] things, but you are very spiritual.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; But God saym, when you ask wisdom, it's
[2:17:33] a package.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Hey,
[2:17:39] you who have some doubt, let's let's
[2:17:41] deal with your doubt.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Proverb chapter 4. If you
[2:17:45] dare, you can say amen.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Verse seven. The Bible say what?
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; WISDOM IS WHAT? THE PRINCIPLE THING.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; AH, wisdom is what?
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; THE PRINCIPLE THING.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, WISDOM IS THE MAIN THING.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT?
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; SO HE ASKED THE PRINCIPLE THING.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:18:09] SO ACCORDING TO AH
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; SO NOW WE FOUND OUT THAT WISDOM
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; IS WHAT
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; the principle thing
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; the the PRINCIPLE
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE MAIN THING.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT?
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; THE MAIN THING.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; BROTHER JOSHUA ASKED FOR WHAT?
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; THE MAIN THING.

[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, SOLOMON is saying IF
[2:18:55] THERE IS ONE THING YOU NEED TO GET
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU NEED TO WORK FOR IT,
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; get wisdom.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WISDOM IS THE MAIN THING.
[2:19:06] BECAUSE WISDOM IS THE PRINCIPAL THING.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ONLY CAN GET
[2:19:13] WISDOM,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; SO SOLOMON ASKED FOR THE MEN. THAT'S WHY
[2:19:22] THE LORD WAS PLEASED.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; I hope now we are together.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; With his request.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE?
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS BRINGING FOUR ADAMS HERE.
[2:19:36] RICHES AND WEALTH, HONOR, LIFE OF THE
[2:19:38] ENEMY AND WHAT
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; long life.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Proverb 3
[2:19:46] and then we start soaring my friend.
[2:19:48] Proverb 3. If you there, you can say
[2:19:50] amen.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Drop to verse 13. If you there, you can
[2:19:55] say amen.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Happy is the who?

[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; THAT FOUND WHAT?
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; AND THE MAN THAT GET WHAT?
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTANDING. SO A MAN THAT FOUND
[2:20:06] WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING IS HOW
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; HAPPY.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 14.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; FOR HER WHAT?
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; FOR THE MERCHANDISE of it.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; SO WISDOM GOT MERCHANDISE.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; UHHUH. UHHUH. UH-UH. UH-UH. UH-UH.
[2:20:23] UH-UH. WISDOM IS NOT JUST WISDOM.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Wisdom got a got a got a got a package.
[2:20:32] He got a merchandise.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; HE GOT GOODS.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; PRODUCTS.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAY FOR HER MERCHANDISE is what?
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Better than the merchandise of silver.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Better than the merchandise of what?
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Silver.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; And the g thereof of what?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; And fine gold. You see, brother Steven,
[2:20:52] you see, you see the merchandise of
[2:20:54] silver are better than I mean the
[2:20:57] merchandise of wisdom are better than
[2:21:00] silver and gold. See, wisdom is
[2:21:03] spiritual. It is better than money.
[2:21:06] Let's continue.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 15. SHE IS MORE PRECIOUS
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; THAN WHAT?
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; RUBY.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK, THEY ARE CALLING WOMAN A
[2:21:17] SHEEP.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; I MEAN WISDOM A SHEEP.
[2:21:20] AMEN.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DESIRE OF A WOMAN,
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; THE DESIRE OF THE bride
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; goes to the groom.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW IN THE BOOK OF THE NEW
[2:21:34] TESTAMENT, THE BIBLE SAY CHRIST IS OUR
[2:21:36] WISDOM.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 15, SHE IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN
[2:21:44] WHAT?
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; RUBIES. AND ALL THE THINGS you can
[2:21:47] desire ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH WHAT
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; TO HER.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO NOW. VERSE 16. LIFE OF DAYS.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; IS IN WHAT?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; HER RIGHT HAND.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; AH. SO THAT IF YOU FIND WISDOM, WISDOM
[2:22:04] HAVE HAND.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'M reading with you.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Ah. Come on. COME ON. WISDOM HAVE HAND.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; WISDOM HAVE A RIGHT HAND AND WISDOM HAVE
[2:22:13] A LEFT HAND. SO WISDOM IS A PERSON.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO FIND WHAT IS IN HER HAND.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THE BIBLE SAY IN
[2:22:31] THE RIGHT HAND OF WISDOM.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THERE?
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; RICHES AND HONOR. NO.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; AH NO NO NO NO NO. LET'S START AGAIN.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Let's start where we were again. VERSE
[2:22:41] 16. LIFE OF WHAT? DAYS
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; ARE WHERE
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; IN HER RIGHT HAND.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; LOOK RIGHT HERE.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; LOOK RIGHT HERE, MY FRIEND.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; GOD TAUGHT SOLOMON WHAT?
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; WHICH is wealth and what?
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Honor
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Life
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; LONG LIFE.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT SOLOMON ASKED FOR
[2:22:58] WHAT?
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; UNDERSTANDING.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; WISDOM. BUT WE FOUND IN WISDOM RIGHT
[2:23:03] HAND WHAT IS THERE?
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD SAY BECAUSE YOU ASK
[2:23:08] WISDOM,
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; WISDOM IN HIS RIGHT HAND GOT LONG LIFE.
[2:23:13] YES, SIR.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; Let's slow down. If I If I lost you,
[2:23:20] raise your hand because I can't play a
[2:23:22] game with that. If I lost you, raise
[2:23:24] your hand. Thank you, Jesus. Listen
[2:23:26] carefully.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Solomon say, "Give me wisdom."
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; And God say, "What
[2:23:34] caliber are you, Solomon?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I didn't. You're a dangerous child.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for money. You didn't ask
[2:23:42] for length of day. You asked for wisdom
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; because you asked for wisdom.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Get length of day.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Get uh money,
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; get honor,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; get the life of your enemy. And our
[2:23:54] question was why is God adding those
[2:23:56] things when Solomon only asked for
[2:23:58] wisdom?
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; We found out that's according to
[2:24:01] proverb, wisdom is the principle thing.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; So Solomon asked for the man thing.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU GET THE MAN THING,
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:24:13] WHEN YOU GET DUKE POWER,
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; WHEN DUKE POWER BELONG TO YOU,
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? NOW WE
[2:24:22] FIND IN WISDOM RIGHT HAND, WHAT DO WE
[2:24:25] FIND THERE?
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; CHECK.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; AND SOLOMON ASKED FOR WHAT?
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; SO AUTOMATICALLY SOLOMON MUST HAVE LONG
[2:24:35] LIFE
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LONG LIFE IS A PACKAGE OF
[2:24:39] WISDOM. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 316.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; This is a teaching reign, my friend.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; We got to be taught to have a right
[2:24:50] faith
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; because when you pray, you cannot have a
[2:24:53] condemnation.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Like you you you asking something that
[2:24:58] is sinful.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; There is a time we told you stay away
[2:25:05] for sisters.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Stay away for sister. After a while we
[2:25:08] say hey you don't watch you don't see
[2:25:12] you don't see because there is a time
[2:25:14] have changed after a while we say we
[2:25:16] don't see it's no longer a sin we say
[2:25:18] boy
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; I took you over there you didn't see
[2:25:21] anything
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; but before it was a sin
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; let me go back to what I'm saying
[2:25:30] [laughter]
[2:25:31] IF YOU DON'T KEEP THE BALANCE THAT'S
[2:25:32] WHEN WE GET IN TROUBLE
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; in the message of the TRUTH AMEN.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE PUSH THE BOY SO FAR
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND, YOU ARE
[2:25:42] TELLING THE SAME BOY, GO MARRY, GO MARRY
[2:25:44] WHAT YOU TOLD ME THIS IS SIN
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE PORTRAY WOMEN AS SIN.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; NOW SIN TURN TO A BLESSING AGAIN
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BALANCE THINGS RIGHT.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAY WHO FIND A WIFE FIND A
[2:26:03] GOOD THING. SO KNOW HOW YOU ARE
[2:26:06] DEPICTING HOW YOU ARE PAINTING A SYSTEM.
[2:26:09] Yes sir.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WORLDLY
[2:26:13] SYSTEM.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; A WORLDLY WOMAN AND A SISTER.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; A SISTER IS A PRECIOUS THING.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOD'S DAUGHTER.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? VERSE 16. LENGTH OF
[2:26:34] DAYS IS WHERE?
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; IN HER LEFT HAND.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; AND IN HER LEFT HAND ARE WHAT?
[2:26:38] [screaming]
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; RICHES AND HONOR.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; RICHES AND WHAT?
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; HONOR.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN SOLOMON IS ASKING FOR WISDOM,
[2:26:44] WHAT IS COMING?
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; You understand? Now
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; can you look at the board?
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; What is on the left hand?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Riches and honor.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Riches and what?
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Honor.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Now you understand why God was adding
[2:27:00] those things? Because you cannot have
[2:27:02] wisdom without having this package.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; I hope I'M GOING TO STRIKE something
[2:27:08] sooner.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh uh verse uh 17. AND HER
[2:27:16] PATH HER WAYS ARE WAYS OF WHAT?
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; PLEASANTNESS.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; AND ALL HER PATH ARE WHAT?
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE THINGS RIGHT HERE?
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; LIFE OF ENEMY.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; LIFE OF WHAT?
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; ENEMY. IF THEY TAKE THE LIFE OF YOUR
[2:27:29] ENEMY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
[2:27:34] [applause and cheering]
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD TOLD SOLOMON, "ASK,
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; SOLOMON SAY, GIVE ME WHAT?"
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; WISDOM.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; BUT WISDOM GOES WITH A PACKAGE.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET HONOR.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET WEALTH.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET PEACE. YES.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GET WISDOM, YOU GET LONG LIFE.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; SEEK YE FIRST.
[2:28:03] [cheering]
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:28:09] [screaming] AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; THOSE THINGS ARE IN THE KINGDOM.
[2:28:15] [cheering]
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. IN OTHER WORDS,
[2:28:21] INSTEAD OF GOING TO GOD AND SAY, "GIVE
[2:28:23] ME MONEY." AH, SAY, "GIVE ME YOURSELF.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOURSELF.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOURSELF.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." [cheering]
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GOT THE HOLY GHOST, [screaming]
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; I GOT MONEY.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I GOT HONOR.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; I GOT LONG LIFE. I GOT [screaming]
[2:28:41] ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY AUNTIE, RIGHT? [screaming]

[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Get the principle thing. you will get
[2:29:51] everything.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; That's what God was teaching Israel in
[2:29:56] the wilderness.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; That man shall not live by bread. If you
[2:29:59] got me,
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; I will produce mana.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; If you got me, I will produce I I will

[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the wealth of Solomon is part
[2:30:17] of the wisdom
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; and the wisdom is
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Christ
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE RICHES AND HONOR AND GLORY AND
[2:30:27] POWER ARE TO CHRIST.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THAT'S WHY BROTHER
[2:30:32] BRHAM SAY IF EINSTEIN WOULD HAVE TAKEN
[2:30:34] THE THE THE SCIENTIFIC WORK THAT HE DID
[2:30:38] AND APPLY IT HE WOULD HAVE TAUGHT US
[2:30:40] SOMETHING BECAUSE SOME BECAUSE EINSTEIN
[2:30:43] FOUND A CENTER IN THE UNIVERSE. IF YOU
[2:30:45] CAN MAKE A CONTACT WITH THAT CENTER YOU
[2:30:48] CAN CREATE EVERYTHING. HE FOUND THE
[2:30:50] PILLAR OF FIRE
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE TAKE CARE OF THE
[2:30:54] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; HE DID IT IN THE FIRST SIX. HE DID IT IN
[2:30:59] THE SECOND AND HE'S GOING TO DO IT IN
[2:31:02] THE THIRD.
[2:31:06] [applause]
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Four minutes left, my friend. Let me try
[2:31:11] to uh maneuver this airplane somewhere.
[2:31:14] Are we together?
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; So you who start Solomon ask for God say
[2:31:24] [laughter]
[2:31:25] wisdom got a package. When you get
[2:31:27] wisdom, you get everything.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; When you get Christ, you get everything.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say Jesus was rich
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; and he made himself poor so that me and
[2:31:38] you can become rich
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; because he is the wisdom of God.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; And Solomon REPRESENTED CHRIST
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; IN THE MILLENNIUM
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; IN THE FULL GLORY OF CHRIST WAS
