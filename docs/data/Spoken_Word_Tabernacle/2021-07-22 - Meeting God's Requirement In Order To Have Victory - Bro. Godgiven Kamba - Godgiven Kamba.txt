visitor because i'm among my brother and sister so i uh i thank pastor shambo for his invitation to come here to bring the word of the lord so i don't want to take much of your time if you have if you have your bible with you return to the book of exodus chapter 12. exodus chapter 12 we will read 1-13 amen let us start from three speaking unto all the congregation of israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a in-house and if the household bit too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take off the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in the in that night wrought with fire and unleavened bread and with a bitter herbs they shall eat it it's not of it raw not sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the prudence thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning you shall burn with fire and thus shall he eat it with your lawns gilded your shoes on your feet and your stuff in your hand and you shall eat it enhanced it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and we smite all the first born in the land of egypt both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt are we i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a talking upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt may the lord add blessing on the reading of its word you might be seated so i know you this scripture you know it very well i believe brother brother stephen went through this many times uh but this evening when brother bradham read it he preached on the token uh this evening by the help of the lord i will not speak on the token i would like to speak on meeting god's requirement in order to have victory meeting god's requirement in order to have victory so we see in life brother bradham told us the natural is a type of a spiritual so if we look in this in the natural first we found that in almost every day everything we do there we meet some requirement in our everyday work you might say i i don't i don't get that but if today you want to go maybe to europe or any other country you you always wanted to go if you do really want to go in that country you will show some interest and you would like to know what are the requirements for me to go to that country if i am an american do i need a visa and if you don't need a visa do i have my passport with me if you don't have a passport then it will be time for you to look for a passport then when you get your passport you have to know how much the ticket cost for me to buy then you look around and see your bank account if you have enough money to buy a ticket and when you put all those requirements together then you can decide if you will do it or not and we found that sometimes people want to do things but when they look on the requirement they become so limited you might say oh i want to buy a house or to buy a house is is good but it comes with a requirement you have to meet some requirement in order for you to buy a house you might go and see and say oh i need this type of house oh well oh it's good then they will ask you how much are you making is your income enough for you to afford the mortgage then they will give you the least of the requirements you will look you go through and maybe you say oh no i i won't be qualified or maybe yes i see what it did for me to buy this type of house then i have to go maybe work hard for my income to meet the requirement for me to obtain what i need so you see all of these is a requirement that we have to meet and we work hard to meet this requirement every single day [Music] you might have money on your bank account you cannot just go and present yourself and say i need to draw money from my my bank the banker will say yes sir do you have your atm card with you oh yes can you swipe and put your pin why because they need to make sure is you the owner of that bank and if the amount is above the limit they will say can i have your id you see all these are requirements we walk according to the law and we meet those requirements for us to receive whatever we have need of you can go and argue with a banker oh it's my bank account a hat they will look at you say yes sir we know is your bank account we want to verify is for your own good you might say oh yes is my but i forgot my wallet i'm sorry we need your id we need your atm we need something to identify who you are so schools they have a requirement there's some type of school that you cannot just go the way you want they say okay maybe apply put an application is a lottery or whatever or maybe for you to be accepted in this school your gpa needs to be this this and that all that are requirement amen job there is a job requirement oh you can look on the internet and you see a good job paying a nice pay but you see down there they say job description and then requirement you need to be this and that you have to be work to have experience of this amount of years you see why they want to make sure the guy who we will take what we high have experienced to do the job he's applying for so we have to meet this requirement in our daily work then i start to look around we look around the christians you meet people good people they love the lord when you talk to them they have a heart for god but when you look around very closely you find out that something is just missing somewhere something just wrong somewhere then we'll we start to think what is the problem what is going on amen and then we have to find out the reason the thing that is not working right for us to work on the thing for the thing to work the way it's supposed to amen you see god is a god of his word when we read the bible most of the time we bypass a lot of things we always jump to the promises of god we read the bible the bible says by his tribe we are healed it's the promise of god and then when we take that promise we stand before god oh lord you said by your stripe we are healed yes but you see but brother abraham say every promise in the bible every promises of god is always attached to a requirement or a condition amen but when we read the bible we present the word of god we take the promise then we pray and nothing is happening then we have to find out what the reason is why god made a promise but why we don't see a result amen there is a reason and we cannot stay and complaining complaining complaining like god has changed our god is the same god god never changed his word is the same he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah but you see we always quote hebrew 13 we say jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but for him to be the same for you you have to identify yourself with hebrew 13 7. hebrew 13 7 is where you have to adapt for yourself because hebrew 13 8 is where god is amen god is in hebrew 13 8 but he wants you to be hebrew 13 7 hallelujah when you become hebrew 13 7 then jesus will be the son yesterday today and forever for you oh glory be to god thank you jesus you see we have to come back to the world we have to see what god needs for you and now because it looks like people are so defeated people are so discouraged people have a lot of questions but no answer but the answer is in the word amen the answer is in the word you see there is a way of following jesus jesus you cannot just follow him any kind of way you can become a member of a church you can be a follower of a preacher that is your problem but when you be you want to be a follower of jesus jesus gives a requirement he gives you a condition for you to be his follower he says here in matthew chapter 16 24-26 then jesus then said jesus unto his disciple if any man will come after me let him deny himself oh hallelujah we can stop right there and finish our service right there or if you want to follow jesus jesus gives you a condition on how you have to follow him you cannot just walk up and say i'm following jesus no jesus tells you if you want to follow me you have to deny yourself not only that but take up his cross and follow me oh hallelujah what is a cross a cross is a symbol of death you cannot follow jesus being alive oh hallelujah you have to deny yourself you have to deny your thoughts you have to unite your mind you have to deny your existence you become dying to yourself then you can follow jesus jesus is the word and there is a way of following him jesus has a requirement each time he gives a promise that promise is always followed by a requirement or a condition o 25 say this for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it matthew chapter 10 38 says this and he that taketh not his cross and followed me and followed after me is not worthy of me you see deny means to refuse reject decline stat that one refuses to admit the truth or existence of so you have to deny yourself in order for you to follow jesus brother brahm says this in the envision of the united states he says and the people is not at blame it is from behind the platform where it's come from exactly it's from behind the platform they teach them all kinds of rhythms and all kind of this and that and organizations and how to make youth groups and everything like that i wonder if that is paid nothing against it but i'm wondering if that is god's requirement when jesus said except a man be born of water and spirit he will in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven he that will follow after me let him deny himself and his own worldly pleasures take up his cross and follow after me cross is a symbol of death agony he that will be a christian let him strip strip himself off his own thought let him strip himself of his own works let him strip himself of everything denying himself and take up that consecrated cross and follow me daily a christian walk brother and sister this is a daily walk we have to die every single day oh hallelujah because we know you and i before we leave this earth this church of jesus christ will reach a perfection oh hallelujah we have to reach it in order for us we will be so perfect until grave will not be able to hold our loved one oh hallelujah we know that all the saints that died are waiting for you and me all the saints are waiting for you and me then what kind of work we should have and what type of life we should have when we are unable to take just a little bit of pressure but yet daily every day we say oh jesus is coming oh we are waiting the coming of the lord is good towards the coming of the lord but are you going to be a part of those who will be raptured you say oh is by grace yes it's by grace but if you don't know what the grace of god is you will you will miss explain and mistake the grace of god the person who knows what the grace of god is that person the kind of life he lives is a different type of life because he knows what grace means grace is not like go live all kind of life any way you want if that what grace means then i didn't i don't need that kind of grace amen to god be the glory we look job still job stood part for he knew that god well he was certain he was god for he had talked with him and he had met his requirement he searched down and found out i've made every burnt offering i said in my heart perhaps when my sons gave a feast and my daughters attended perhaps maybe they did secretly sin in their heart so i will offer a burnt offering for them and confess they sin they're wrong a christian when something happened in our lives in our family in our home or between a brethren a christian is not a someone who just jumping get in fire and start acting kind of all kind of way but a christian we stay calm and we try to find a reason we try to find out why this has happened and he will go searching until he found what went wrong and then he will be eligible if he has to make things right he will make it right and have peace in his heart but when things happen most of the time we are the first one to look the devil and start pointing fingers he is the cause he is the one he is the one he is the one where did that happen to job job knew god was god he knew that god was alive he talked with him and suddenly things that will happen in his family job went on searching to find what went wrong amen oh god oh god when a man keeps what god said do he is certain he's god he has to answer faith calls him on the sin every time [Music] oh hallelujah i like this when a man keeps what god said do this is where the problem comes the problem is not the word of god this is what i'm trying to bring to your attention the problem is not god the problem is how you take what god said is when you skip your portion and you stand before god lord you said sometimes we make god sick when he knows that yes i made a promise but do your part then come i will do mine but we keep our part we want god to do his there is no way god can do it god will never compromise his word hallelujah we have to come the way of the lord we have to come according to his promises in order for us to see the victory oh to god be the glory jesus the son of the living god you see let's go to the book of mark chapter 10. mark 10 let us read 17-21 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running notice that he was not walking he was running and nailed to him humility and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call is thou me good there is no good but one that is god that knows the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that lacketh go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me this man came to jesus running running and he came and knelt down this person stood before the eternal life himself what an opportunity he was rich but he was not satisfied he knew that something was lacking he has a possession but in his heart he knew i'm lacking something and that thing was eternal life then he knew was one who was able to give him what he was lacking and that one was jesus oh hallelujah he came and stood before jesus good master should i do for me to have eternal life oh jesus look at him and say you know the commandment you don't have to do this you don't have to do that you don't have you don't have to don't have he look jesus on the face all of these i have observed since my youth jesus never questioned him of his claim but he looked his life jesus found what the problem was and he said now one thing o mine jesus can jesus look at you tonight and search your life and say i find only one thing you are lacking only one thing you are lacking this man was lacking only one thing oh hallelujah this thing that was changing him from receiving eternal life go the requirement sell what all that you have give it to the poor and come back take your cross and follow me oh hallelujah what jesus said go take everything you have give it come and follow me why because eternal life is to live for others hallelujah come i want you to live for poor people i want you to be my disciple sell everything you have give it to the poor come and follow me take up your cross die to yourself then you have eternal life oh when i think about this man he stood face to face with eternal life jesus scanned his entire life and found only one problem jesus looked at him and loved him oh the love of god oh you say jesus loved him yes he looked him and loved him but the love of jesus was not able to compromise with his word come go sell everything you have if you want eternal life take up your cross and follow me brother and sister there is a way of following jesus and that way many of us come to church but we are not on that way we are not on that way that is the reason why we have all the up and down all the time we cry unto god lord allows you lord help me and lord say take up your cross come and follow me but when you look the cost of the cross you are discouraged but still you come lord help me how can he help you when he already told you what to do you say god is a merciful god look he knew what cain was but still he spoke to cain he said okay if you will do it like your brother if you will do just like your brother you will be accepted what was hard for ken to look what abel did and just go do what evil did and he was going to be accepted but no he didn't want that it was too much for him then he went and did what was in his heart my brother and sister this is not the time to look around and play around this is not the time to stay oh i heard the voice that rich ruler heard the voice he spoke face to face with god came god spoke to him and you say oh no i heard the fall he said yes to him the voice of god can talk to anybody god talk to satan god can talk to who he wants to but that is not the sign that you are a son or a daughter of god we should not be bind by miracles and stuff you see jesus never said believers should follow the sign he never said that but he said this sign shall follow them that believe so if you believe it's not your problem to look for signs sun will follow you why because you are holding off the world why because the word of god is on your heart you are working according to the word hallelujah but when you see people running after signs something is wrong why because god never promised you to follow the sign but he said the sign will follow you if you can believe oh the word of god is just so simple but why why is because we don't go by his word we don't live by his word we want god to do according to our feeling according to our emotion according to our vision according to our thought according to our mind and that where the crash comes from that where there is an opposition because it will never work he is expecting you to come his provided way but you you are on your own way and you want god to come and meet you on your way oh hallelujah it will never work abraham god spoke to him when he was 75 years old he and his wife sarah her being 65 was childless they didn't have any children then god told him you are going to have a child by sarah but in order to do this you've got to separate yourself god spoke to abraham abraham heard the word of god he took his way god asked him to leave him and his wife but abraham instead of doing what god told him he took his nephew a lot with him brother abram say he took also his dad his dad died then they went with lot but god gave him a promise to bless him with a child as long as abraham was with lot it was not possible for him to have a child so god was waiting looking at abraham abraham waiting for the promise and god waiting for him to be separate abraham was waiting the promise sarah was waiting waiting waiting abraham we have been waiting for a long time it seems like maybe god meant it another way you see that what is the problem when god says something don't bring your own interpretation don't try to help god god does not need your help why why is god who wants to help you how you want to help him god said sarah was not a girl oh god whatever your name was but seriously oh abraham you see sometimes you have to understand the speech of god you see you have to understand how god works sometimes i think god meant that you have to take my servant here but that was not what god said god is promises are always on condition you must absolutely no matter how fundamental you are with the promise it is under conditions always not sometimes but always we could stop here and wave through that scripture back and forth for hours see that the condition is what means something did you get that the promise is good but what means something is the condition that comes with the promise but what we where we always go wrong our eyes always set on the promise that what attract our mind is the promise because we lack promises oh he said oh god said the promise is for god the promise is for god but you you do what god told you to do for you to receive the promise if we turn this light off we know the only way to turn this light is to go wherever just turn the switch on the lights will be on right so but when we if we know the only way that this light will turn on is for us to turn the switch up if we don't do that and stay just here oh god we need the light lord we need the light it's too dark it's too dark but just go go there turn it up the light should be on we don't want to do that we want god to do everything to do to do everything but as a children of god god is training us god is training you to become one with his word god wants you to have faith in his word until you know that you know no matter the condition god is going to do what he said you see we have faith we do we all have faith and sometimes we think faith is something so supernatural and so unusual you see the first time i went to winnipeg canada i never been there before but they invited us to go for a wedding the only thing they gave us was the address that the only thing they gave us the address and then i took my gps i put up gps there on my car at 23 hours driving somewhere i've never been before me and my family we trusted that gps so much we knew that after 23 hours we will be in winnipeg canada we took the address we put it there nothing to argue with that gps that gps say stay in this road for two hours no question we stayed there one hour and now 1 30 and 9 15 45 50 55 2 hours take to the right left nothing to argue oh why i'm taking to the left that is not my problem that gps said take the left and it took left stay here for 150 miles i stood there no matter how many turns i saw on my way that was not my concern because my gps told me stay here for 158 miles i trust that gps so much until after 23 hours that if you say you have arrived i look to my right this is the house and the number oh hallelujah then today you are asking me to question the message you want me to question the bible hallelujah god said to me behold i will send you elijah the prophet hallelujah with a message why to turn me back to the experience of my fathers hallelujah to bring me back to the baptism of the holy ghost glory be to god no money no popularity that is not my problem my problem is to see and to know what monarchical has said let me leave by maracas 4. walk with the world hallelujah look the word take to the right take to the left hallelujah and i know one day [Music] one day [Applause] one day jesus hallelujah everyone will open in the twinkle of enough whew the law of god in you [Music] will defy gravity you will fly like an ego you will see the sky you say how do you know management for has spoken i believe what i understand i believe what i don't understand because the angel toward that prophet if you can bring people to believe in you if you can believe in what malachi 4 has spoken i don't say if you pretend not when if you understand but i say if you believe what he said jesus said to his disciple they were so surprised when they when the next day and find the fig tree dried up jesus looked at them and said if you have a faith not just not just you will do the same thing i did not only you'll be able to dry up but you see all these big mountains if you speak to that mountain and if you don't dart in your heart brother you see every promise is always with a condition with a requirement for tonight all i want you to do is to change your way of seeing the things of god look your part do your part don't mind god with his part because him he's faithful to his own word he cannot lie he cannot change so that is a deal done now you find your your part and stay right there make sure you do exactly what he said then take his promise and see if god is not the same and see if he's not the same oh my i don't even know what time i have to finish but see i okay let's do this i will finish very quick why did you ever think why he was absolute positive and the only thing he had to do was separate himself from his people and god never did bless him until he did it he took his daddy his daddy died he took lot and when after lord separated from abraham then god come to him said now walk through the land see listen obedience one promise to and the conditions three always goes with god and his word obedience why because the bible say obedience is better than sacrifice so you obey the word of god after you obey then you look the promise after that you look the conditions in which you have to be for god to fulfill that promise and when you stay there on that condition that condition is made then you see the power of god the bible said these sons shall follow them that believe if they lay hand on the sick they shall recover that is exactly right now that is under conditions if you believe it you see if you believe it oh my if you've done any sin confess it make everything right god will not heal only under conditions see so call your pastor in and if you did and if you did any wrong confess it the bible say confess your fault one to another pray one for another that you may be healed you see when you have done something wrong or you are sick start looking around your own life is it something you have done wrong search go in looking to find out what is the cause of this sickness what is the cause of this problem look around search search then when you found out you make it right and after you make it right brother call your pastor don't hide any sick sin in your life and you bring your pastor a poor man we pray pray pray pray pray nothing happened i don't think i pastor have faith i don't think our pastor god hears his prayers the problem is not your pastor your problem is you how that poor man will know what you did is between you and god you confess make it right then when that man of god comes you just take the scripture lord you said by your stride it happened oh my i'm going to close now by oh jesus what was it that very dark crucial moment come but god is always on the scene if you are sure that it is god if you repented of your sins if you've met god's requirement then be sure that god will keep his promise if men and women could only realize that god is obli uh obligated to his promise and if you've met his requirement if you confessed your sins and you've made your wrong right and you've done everything god has required then hold unto god then hold on to god you've got to see the daylight no matter the situation brother and sister god's promise is true but the problem is the way we approach him the way we approach god is not the right way let us change the way we approach him we will see the glory of god will we become a super christian we will see the glory of god because you know you walk according to his law you walk according to his promises god will never fail you god will never fail you let me read the last quote you know in the prayer line many times going through and maybe offering prayer and sometimes a a case goes deeper than that see god heals on condition and there there might be something in that person's life i don't care how much medicine the doctor would give them they will never get well until that thing is cleared up and sometimes we find people going through these prayer lines out across the nation and they just run up and think that the lord ought to heal them right then but there is something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveres what that is there is a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first and then you can find what to walk on you have been wondering many times why you cannot just live a victorious life as a christian you have been wondering why this is just not working right with me you have questions but tonight the lord is asking you to look around search around found out make it right then your problem will be solved as we bow our heads this tonight i think something has been said that will help you to see things different that will help you maybe just have a closer walk with god if you think the lord has spoke to you tonight and you want to be remembered in prayer just lift up your hand the laws the lord knows everything and jesus is in his word almighty god god of heaven god of

break the mystery of death so you pray for me on sunday we gotta dig into the mystery of death with emman and we gotta break it i tried to avoid it and leave it alone but i see those coming up one by one like defend yourself death die daily i know we have a first resurrection second resurrection and the second death we don't have a choice church we gotta sort through that so you pray for me

expressed the devil in every way that was completely the devil and his plan was to destroy to steal and to do water and to kill you can see that in esther chapter 4 if i'm not mistaken i tried to dodge it and avoid it so we can go back up quickly but the lord is pulling me back so brother kelly yes stick around with me i gotta go through that death and break the mystery of death so you understand when they say death in a scripture there's different death in the scripture and there is one we're gonna overcome because we need to go to the rapture amen blessed be the name of the lord
