[39:27] what's the devil trying to do again
[39:29] tonight
[39:32] let's go to genesis chapter two
[39:34] [Music]
[39:36] glory to god
[39:38] amen
[39:39] i know it's wednesday
[39:45] i'm trying to push a little bit forward
[39:50] if not we're on the deep
[39:54] honey and it's hard to swim
[39:57] amen
[39:59] blessed be the name of the lord let me
[40:01] know when you're ready if not i already
[40:03] have a backup here genesis chapter 2
[40:06] verse 20. if you dare you can say amen
[40:09] we read this over and over the bible
[40:12] says and adam gave name to all caddo
[40:15] and to the file of the air
[40:18] you might be seated
[40:19] and to every beast of the field
[40:22] but for adam
[40:25] there was not found
[40:27] a help
[40:28] made for him
[40:30] everybody okay
[40:32] in other words everybody was a pair
[40:36] male and female amen
[40:39] it doesn't mean that adam was really
[40:41] alone
[40:42] right
[40:43] because the animal were there
[40:45] the fishes were there the elephant was
[40:48] there the zebra was there the rhino was
[40:50] there amen
[40:51] adam was not truly alone in that aspect
[40:54] when they say adam was alone it's that
[40:57] he didn't have his help
[40:59] mate amen somebody that looked like him
[41:03] amen so right there there is a
[41:06] difference in the kingdoms
[41:11] glory to god
[41:13] there was not found a help made for adam
[41:16] amen so there is a difference
[41:19] in the kingdom
[41:22] amen
[41:23] we got the fowls
[41:25] we got the fishes
[41:26] everybody care
[41:28] we got the cattle
[41:30] and the beast
[41:32] amen
[41:33] we got the creeping things
[41:35] if you read your genesis you should be
[41:37] good
[41:39] amen
[41:40] and we got man
[41:42] who was created in the image and in the
[41:45] likeness of god everybody okay
[41:50] so these everybody everything in the
[41:54] file was two
[41:56] a pair
[41:57] in a fish is a pair
[41:59] in the car
[42:01] a pair in the creeping things a pair so
[42:04] adam was not really alone
[42:08] he was the god of the earth remember on
[42:10] sunday
[42:11] but what makes him alone
[42:14] is his female part
[42:17] amen
[42:18] hey buddy clear
[42:20] his help mate was missing
[42:23] amen
[42:24] amen
[42:26] praise god
[42:28] hallelujah verse 21 and the lord god
[42:32] caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam
[42:35] and he slept
[42:37] and he took one of his ribs
[42:40] and closed up the flesh we get to this
[42:42] down the road
[42:45] because there's a lot of things laying
[42:46] there
[42:47] and close up the flesh
[42:50] and instead thereof and the rib which
[42:52] the lord god has taken from man
[42:55] made he a woman you remember it's not if
[42:58] yet
[42:59] it is a woman
[43:01] amen
[43:03] i hope somebody is not tired from work
[43:06] brother kalim is not here some of the
[43:08] folks are not here so you need to
[43:10] compensate
[43:12] amen
[43:14] hallelujah
[43:17] and brought her to man verse 23 and adam
[43:20] say this is now born of my bones and
[43:23] flesh of my flesh and she shall be
[43:26] called a woman because she was taken out
[43:29] of man
[43:31] everybody okay
[43:33] therefore shall men leave his father and
[43:35] his mother and shall cling to his wife
[43:39] and they too and they shall be one flesh
[43:42] sorry
[43:43] and they were both naked
[43:46] the man and his wife and were not
[43:48] ashamed in other words the marriage was
[43:52] not consumed
[43:58] i have scripture on that
[44:00] but i don't know how far we can go
[44:02] tonight
[44:03] go to genesis chapter 3 verse 1
[44:07] now the serpent you understand this now
[44:11] was more subtle
[44:14] the serpent
[44:16] you understand what it means now right
[44:18] he was more subtle
[44:20] amen he was more subtle
[44:24] than
[44:25] any beast you understand his category
[44:27] now
[44:29] of the field which the lord god had made
[44:33] and he said to the woman
[44:35] yea has god said you shall not eat of
[44:38] every tree of the garden we will see
[44:40] what that it means i know you know it
[44:42] i'm going to grind you in the scripture
[44:44] amen
[44:45] let's go to verse 13
[44:48] and the lord god said to the woman
[44:51] what is this that you have done and the
[44:53] woman said the serpent begot or seduced
[44:57] me
[44:57] and i did eat everybody okay
[45:00] watch verse 14 and the lord god said to
[45:03] the serpent because you have done this
[45:07] you are cursed above all cattle
[45:11] and above every beast of the field
[45:14] remember on the fifth day there were
[45:17] three categories that were created you
[45:19] remember
[45:20] we got the caddo
[45:22] we got the beast
[45:24] and we got the creeping things
[45:27] amen
[45:28] but the serpent
[45:30] was removed from this category
[45:34] this sub category
[45:36] amen because he was an upright creature
[45:39] amen
[45:40] amen everybody okay
[45:42] hallelujah the bible says that he was he
[45:45] would be cursed above all cuddle and
[45:48] above every beast of the field upon your
[45:52] belly so he was not walking on his belly
[45:55] anybody care he was an upright creature
[45:58] right here
[46:00] everybody
[46:01] so they move him from here to here
[46:07] everybody okay
[46:08] and since the curse
[46:10] changed him
[46:12] in other words he moved from a standing
[46:15] position
[46:18] here
[46:19] into a fallen position
[46:23] okay back here and since he fell
[46:27] amen there is no redemption for him
[46:31] amen you cannot reverse that back
[46:36] even in the millennium you won't have
[46:38] the serpent anymore
[46:40] the species called the serpent disappear
[46:43] forever
[46:45] you will only have a snake
[46:47] right here he's a serpent
[46:50] but over here he's a snake
[46:52] amen
[46:53] the snake is the cursed version
[46:57] [Music]
[47:00] amen
[47:02] and that's the shall you eat all the
[47:04] days of your life
[47:05] and i will put enmity between you and
[47:09] the woman
[47:10] and between your seed
[47:12] and her seed so both of them have seeds
[47:17] he shall bruise your head and you shall
[47:19] bruise his heel everybody okay
[47:22] let's go to leviticus chapter 18
[47:25] glory to god
[47:30] [Laughter]
[47:34] amen
[47:35] let's go to leviticus chapter 18
[47:39] if you dare you can say amen
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:47] so there is one creature
[47:49] that when he fell
[47:53] never can go back again the way he was
[47:56] he fell
[47:57] eternally
[48:00] the serpent fall
[48:02] eternally that's it nothing happened
[48:05] anymore amen
[48:06] leviticus chapter 18 verse 11 if you
[48:09] dare you can say amen
[48:10] [Music]
[48:12] all right the bible says
[48:14] the nakedness of your father's
[48:17] wife's daughter
[48:20] what does he mean
[48:23] we okay
[48:24] that's what you call half sister
[48:27] everybody okay
[48:28] so we take a father right here
[48:32] amen
[48:33] a father
[48:35] have is married to his wife
[48:38] everybody okay
[48:39] amen
[48:40] but he had another child by another
[48:43] woman
[48:44] which we know about polygamy
[48:47] we don't believe in it
[48:50] everybody okay because god opened the
[48:52] flesh he took one and he closed back up
[48:55] everybody okay
[48:57] we know that right
[48:58] adam never i mean abraham never wanted
[49:01] to be a polygamist he was his wife
[49:04] anybody care
[49:05] okay no problem so if he got another
[49:09] child
[49:10] a daughter from another woman amen
[49:14] he's still the daughter of this man
[49:17] [Music]
[49:19] everybody okay
[49:20] this is what the scripture says now so
[49:23] he might have
[49:24] we're talking about another woman here
[49:27] amen
[49:29] do i have a daughter
[49:30] so he might have a daughter right here
[49:33] and another daughter over there
[49:35] both of them belongs to him because the
[49:38] bloodline comes from the man
[49:41] everybody okay
[49:42] okay that's what i want you to
[49:44] understand the bible say the nakedness
[49:47] of that of your father's wife daughter
[49:49] that daughter
[49:51] begotten of your father amen in other
[49:54] words you're under the same blood
[49:56] amen she is your sister
[50:02] even though it's a different mother
[50:04] but she is your sister everybody okay
[50:07] she's your sister you shall not uncover
[50:11] her nakedness in other words you cannot
[50:14] marry a daughter like that
[50:16] [Music]
[50:17] amen amen it is an unlawful relationship
[50:26] okay
[50:27] where are you going with this
[50:29] job to verse 23
[50:32] i thought we were talking about the
[50:33] serpent
[50:37] verse 23 if you dare you can say amen
[50:41] neither shall you lie
[50:43] with any beast
[50:45] where did they learn this
[50:51] you see that it's in the scripture
[50:53] everybody here neither shall you lie
[50:55] with any beast to defy yourself there
[50:58] with
[50:59] so
[51:00] god calls
[51:02] a relationship between a human
[51:06] and the beast
[51:10] incorrect
[51:12] [Music]
[51:13] everybody okay
[51:15] why is it incorrect
[51:17] because in the garden of eden they are
[51:20] under different category
[51:23] we okay now
[51:25] okay now that's why adam was alone
[51:30] did he make sense now
[51:32] did he make sense now adam was not alone
[51:36] in the sense that there was nothing in
[51:39] the earth no the lion was there the
[51:41] zebra was there amen but adam was alone
[51:45] that there was not another human being
[51:48] like adam
[51:49] who can meet with adam
[51:52] everybody okay
[51:54] so crossing these lines
[51:57] is something wrong
[52:03] everybody okay
[52:04] let me go back again to let me take us
[52:06] my friend
[52:08] amen
[52:09] verse 23 neither shall you lie with any
[52:12] beast to defy yourself there with
[52:14] neither shall any woman
[52:16] clear stand before air beast
[52:20] everybody okay
[52:22] to lie down therefore
[52:24] there are two it is uh
[52:27] so a relationship between a
[52:30] woman and a beast
[52:33] god called that a confusion
[52:38] amen
[52:40] hey
[52:42] in other words you cannot marry the
[52:44] daughter of your father even though she
[52:48] is born from another woman
[52:50] it is a wrong an inordinate passion
[52:57] everybody okay
[52:59] you call her half-sister she's your
[53:01] sister that's what the bible say
[53:05] by the blood
[53:06] everybody okay
[53:08] everybody okay
[53:09] so the unlawful
[53:12] relationship are not only between human
[53:16] and beast
[53:18] but they can be between human and human
[53:22] amen
[53:25] amen am i reading a different bible
[53:30] between human and human
[53:32] if you go home take leviticus 18 and
[53:34] begin to read it they will tell you you
[53:36] can you shall not they could be the i
[53:38] mean uncover the necklace of your mother
[53:40] all of that it's allowful even though
[53:42] it's human
[53:43] anybody here
[53:44] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[53:46] to the book of acts then we pray
[53:52] again in ended
[53:54] different category
[53:57] because man is made in an image and
[54:00] likeness of god man is the highest
[54:02] specie
[54:04] amen you don't leave that and drop under
[54:07] into a different category you don't
[54:09] cross
[54:11] when you cross god say it's a confusion
[54:15] everybody okay
[54:16] what are you using these tools for
[54:21] act 13 this is what we read on
[54:24] sunday verse six and then we will pray
[54:28] you there
[54:29] and when they had gone through the
[54:31] of paphos
[54:33] they found a certain sorcery you
[54:35] remember this on sunday
[54:37] a false prophet you remember on sunday
[54:40] a jew from the tribe of judah you
[54:42] remember this on sunday whose name was
[54:45] water
[54:46] do you know what he means about jesus
[54:53] simons
[54:54] bar
[54:56] son of jonas
[54:58] so this man
[55:00] is called
[55:01] the son of jesus
[55:06] the son of jesus but this son of jesus
[55:10] is from the tribe of judah
[55:13] can you imagine
[55:15] and he is using sorcery
[55:17] [Music]
[55:19] amen and he is also a false prophet
[55:22] [Music]
[55:24] and jesus was from the tribe of judah
[55:27] and jesus didn't use sorcery he was
[55:30] filled with the holy spirit
[55:33] and jesus was a true prophet
[55:38] everybody okay
[55:40] blessed be the name of the lord verse
[55:42] seven
[55:43] which was with the deputy of the country
[55:46] sergi's palace a prudent man who called
[55:50] for barnabas and saw the messenger and
[55:53] the minister
[55:54] desiring to hear the word of god
[55:57] but elimas this is another name
[56:00] for about jesus the sorcerer for so is
[56:04] his name by interpretation withstood
[56:07] them
[56:09] this man did two things
[56:11] number one he withstood paul
[56:15] [Music]
[56:17] and barnabas paul is the messenger
[56:20] and barnabas is the minister
[56:22] under the messenger
[56:24] we okay now
[56:26] he withstood them
[56:28] seeking
[56:29] to turn away the deputy from water
[56:34] the reason why he's doing this the
[56:37] purpose is to turn
[56:40] someone
[56:42] away from what
[56:45] from the faith
[56:49] amen
[56:51] what is in this man
[56:54] everybody okay
[56:56] that is aiming
[56:58] to turn somebody away from the faith
[57:02] in other words there is a faith that was
[57:04] once delivered to the sand
[57:07] he was already delivered
[57:11] amen and someone is coming to turn
[57:15] someone away from the faith
[57:19] but what is the tool that eliminates
[57:23] what are the tools that god jesus is
[57:27] using
[57:30] [Music]
[57:32] everybody okay
[57:34] let's see the tools
[57:36] then so
[57:38] who also is called poor
[57:41] filled with the holy ghost
[57:44] in other words paul
[57:46] now is not using his natural
[57:50] spirit
[57:52] that's what the scripture is telling you
[57:54] paul was a man but the scripture wants
[57:57] you to understand that now there is an
[58:00] anointing on paul
[58:02] it is not paul
[58:04] anybody okay it is the holy spirit in
[58:07] paul
[58:08] that is working now
[58:09] [Music]
[58:11] paul had something
[58:13] lord jesus had something
[58:16] anybody care in paul it was the holy
[58:18] ghost
[58:19] what was involved jesus
[58:23] the son of jesus
[58:25] the name was given to cover up
[58:27] everybody okay
[58:29] now son filled with the holy ghost set
[58:32] his eyes on him so when paul was looking
[58:36] it was not paul that was looking
[58:38] everybody okay he was the holy ghost
[58:41] through paul
[58:43] because paul was a prophet
[58:45] the holy ghost began to use the
[58:47] prophetic eye
[58:49] of paul
[58:50] to zoom in
[58:53] to zoom in about jesus and to begin to
[58:57] detect or to diagnose
[59:00] what is in blood
[59:02] jesus that he's using
[59:06] to
[59:06] turn somebody away from the faith
[59:11] everybody okay it's wednesday my friend
[59:14] already verse 10
[59:16] hallelujah and said this is the holy
[59:20] ghost speaking in power
[59:22] oh full of water
[59:25] so the first two
[59:27] this man has is subtlety
[59:31] everybody okay
[59:33] and the serpent was the master
[59:37] everybody okay
[59:40] you already got the answer right
[59:42] [Music]
[59:44] the two he has is subtility
[59:50] thank you jesus amen
[59:52] is full not just ability full of it
[59:56] [Music]
[59:59] amen
[1:00:02] let's go to first man
[1:00:04] paul was full
[1:00:08] you saw it
[1:00:10] you see it
[1:00:11] paul was filled
[1:00:13] with the holy ghost and this man also
[1:00:16] was filled with something
[1:00:18] [Music]

[1:04:10] roof
[1:04:11] from satan
[1:04:13] to the beast
[1:04:15] everybody okay
[1:04:17] part three we on the threshing floor
[1:04:19] we're dealing with the second oil but on
[1:04:22] the tabernacle language we are in the
[1:04:25] holiest
[1:04:26] brother branham says this that
[1:04:28] everything just a reminder that is today
[1:04:31] that is had its beginning
[1:04:34] and everything that there is begin in
[1:04:36] genesis
[1:04:38] remember life beginning genesis we saw
[1:04:41] that on sunday and life was a person and
[1:04:44] life was a tree
[1:04:46] death began in genesis and death was a
[1:04:49] person and death was a tree remember on
[1:04:52] sunday and all touch begin in genesis
[1:04:55] right and wrong or beginning genesis if
[1:04:58] you study
[1:05:01] the scripture real closely
[1:05:05] amen you will find out that even the ism
[1:05:09] and the quotes of today had their
[1:05:11] beginning in genesis
[1:05:14] if you shall watch nimrod then different
[1:05:16] one in the scripture all them is that we
[1:05:19] have today begin in genesis now today
[1:05:23] they polish it up and make it look like
[1:05:25] something else
[1:05:27] they can call it about jesus
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:33] and right here if you get stuck with the
[1:05:36] name you're going to be deceived
[1:05:39] because the name said the son of jesus
[1:05:42] but the one who was in the son of jesus
[1:05:45] was the devil
[1:05:48] amen so do not worry about the name
[1:05:52] even if they say message believer
[1:05:55] you need to see who is in that message
[1:05:58] believer
[1:06:00] does he have the holy ghost or not
[1:06:03] if there is no holy ghost put them aside
[1:06:07] wait until they are filled with the holy
[1:06:09] spirit
[1:06:11] everybody cares so far brother branham
[1:06:13] said but it's still that old spirit evil
[1:06:17] spirit if you shall watch the nature of
[1:06:20] it and the way that he acts so remember
[1:06:23] this as we're moving through this
[1:06:26] we looked at matthew 25 where we spoke
[1:06:30] about the virgin
[1:06:31] we found out that all those virgins was
[1:06:34] espoused they were not married they were
[1:06:37] only engaged
[1:06:39] and them being engaged spoke about the
[1:06:42] ministry of paul
[1:06:43] because paul say i have a sparse you
[1:06:46] into one husband everybody okay
[1:06:49] in order to present you as a chess
[1:06:53] virgin so paul
[1:06:55] was struggling doing everything that he
[1:06:58] can to keep the church virgin amen
[1:07:02] why
[1:07:05] everybody here
[1:07:06] and those virgins some are foolish some
[1:07:09] are wise everybody clear and we found
[1:07:12] out that at midnight on sunday that the
[1:07:16] midnight cry happened at the seventh
[1:07:18] watch
[1:07:21] everybody okay
[1:07:22] and in the seventh watch brother branham
[1:07:24] said it was malachi fall
[1:07:26] which was the second oil everybody okay
[1:07:28] so far
[1:07:30] amen and then that oil is what made the
[1:07:34] wise virgin to be wise
[1:07:38] that's why we call it the oil of wisdom
[1:07:42] everybody okay
[1:07:43] and the wisdom of god we found through
[1:07:46] the scripture was crossed
[1:07:48] because the bible said that christ is
[1:07:51] the wisdom of god everybody okay now we
[1:07:54] have two wisdom
[1:07:57] we have the wisdom of god
[1:08:01] everybody okay

[1:08:59] because the bible say christ is the
[1:09:01] wisdom of god ever here now we're trying
[1:09:04] to look at the wisdom of the devil

[1:22:44] you
[1:22:47] everybody here
[1:22:48] if you approach it it will kill you
[1:22:50] everybody okay and that wisdom was where

[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] we okay now
[1:22:57] let's go to mark 15. if you dare you can

[1:23:01] mark 15 verse 7
[1:23:03] then i'm gonna drive quick
[1:23:07] you there

[1:23:09] named barabbas
[1:23:12] which laid banned
[1:23:13] with them that had made insurrection a
[1:23:16] bandit
[1:23:18] with him
[1:23:19] who had committed water
[1:23:22] murder in the water
[1:23:24] so there is a man called barabbas a
[1:23:26] murderer
[1:23:29] everybody okay
[1:23:30] okay okay you okay you okay they bring
[1:23:33] the holy people
[1:23:35] and they told them we have two
[1:23:37] candidates
[1:23:38] we have a murderer
[1:23:40] proven by the law
[1:23:42] and murderer everybody and we have an
[1:23:45] innocent man
[1:23:46] which there is nothing else but he's
[1:23:48] doing healing and doing good things to
[1:23:50] the people who would you choose
[1:23:55] your choice
[1:23:56] is based on what is in it
[1:23:59] [Music]
[1:24:01] can i continue
[1:24:04] verse 8 and the multitude cry aloud
[1:24:08] began to desire him to do as he ever
[1:24:12] done to them in other words do what you
[1:24:14] got to do you usually release one person
[1:24:17] but pilot
[1:24:19] as answer them saying will you that are
[1:24:21] released to you the king of the jews
[1:24:25] for he knew
[1:24:27] everybody okay
[1:24:29] that the chief priest
[1:24:31] had delivered him for water
[1:24:34] stop who manifested envy the first time
[1:24:39] in the bible
[1:24:42] let me help you up
[1:24:43] one day god asked two boys bring me the
[1:24:47] offering
[1:24:49] one chose his offering according to his
[1:24:52] revelation they are the one chosen
[1:24:54] offering according to the revelation
[1:24:57] when god agreed to one offering
[1:25:00] the other one rose up with what
[1:25:03] and did what
[1:25:07] everybody okay
[1:25:08] and the chief priests delivered jesus by
[1:25:11] what
[1:25:14] let's continue
[1:25:16] verse 11 but the chief priests you okay
[1:25:20] they moved the people
[1:25:24] you see that
[1:25:25] they move the people that they should
[1:25:28] rather release barabbas to them
[1:25:32] and pilate answered and say again to
[1:25:34] them
[1:25:35] what will you then that i shall do to
[1:25:37] him who you call the king of the jews in
[1:25:41] other words the response of the people
[1:25:43] was not really the people
[1:25:45] it was the priest
[1:25:48] that got into the people and gave them
[1:25:50] the word
[1:25:52] and gave them the wisdom
[1:25:56] and gave them a different wisdom because
[1:25:59] paul said if they have known the wisdom
[1:26:02] of christ
[1:26:03] they would not have crucified the
[1:26:06] problem
[1:26:07] everybody okay so there was another
[1:26:09] wisdom in the priest
[1:26:11] and that wisdom started with envy but he
[1:26:14] always end up with a murderer
[1:26:18] everybody okay
[1:26:19] praise god and politician uh verse 13
[1:26:23] and they cry out again saying water
[1:26:32] in other words
[1:26:33] give us the murderer
[1:26:36] everybody okay
[1:26:37] but crucify the lord
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:41] it's a different wisdom
[1:26:43] anybody okay
[1:26:44] it's a different wisdom amen that's why
[1:26:47] you need the second oil
[1:26:50] ever here because the second oil will
[1:26:53] bring you the wisdom of christ
[1:26:56] for you to know how to avoid
[1:27:00] amen getting in trouble with the lord
[1:27:05] everybody okay so far
[1:27:07] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:27:10] if you notice when the virgin
[1:27:14] left because when the rose they found
[1:27:16] out that they don't have oil in their

[1:27:40] we cannot share the soil it is a
[1:27:43] personal oil
[1:27:46] ever here
[1:27:47] and they want to buy the oil
[1:27:51] everybody okay
[1:27:53] when they want to buy the oil the bible

[1:28:19] marriage and the door was water

[1:30:40] careful with what you follow in the
[1:30:42] pentecostal world
[1:30:44] they might have an anointing
[1:30:47] but their anointing will never make it
[1:30:49] to the blood group
[1:30:52] here they can heal the sick
[1:30:55] they can prophesy that he will take them
[1:30:58] through the tribulation

[1:31:05] with pentecostal
[1:31:07] don't be impressed with baptism don't be
[1:31:10] impressed with catholics

[1:32:56] saying
[1:33:00] they are saved but under tribulation
[1:33:06] amen no matter what billy graham did
[1:33:13] no matter what oral roberts doing
[1:33:17] the gospel will never make it
[1:33:29] don't worry my friend
[1:33:31] there is three seeds brother branham
[1:33:32] said spoken word
[1:33:34] he said there is an evangelical seed by
[1:33:37] billy graham there is a pentecostal seed
[1:33:40] by over rabbit and there is also the
[1:33:44] the bread one the seed of the brother
[1:33:47] the spoken word seed
[1:33:49] amen
[1:33:50] you need to know which seed you belong
[1:33:52] to
[1:33:53] because the other two will not take you
[1:33:55] to meet the bridegroom
[1:33:59] let's go to genesis 18. i don't want you
[1:34:01] to say brother stephen
[1:34:04] you there
[1:34:05] you there
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:08] oh glory to god let's go to verse four
[1:34:11] but before they lay down the men of the
[1:34:14] city even the men of sodom come pass the
[1:34:17] house run
[1:34:18] both old and young all the people from
[1:34:20] every quarter
[1:34:21] and they called to lord and say to him
[1:34:24] where are the men which came into you
[1:34:26] this night
[1:34:27] bring them out to us that we may know
[1:34:29] them amen and lot went out of the door
[1:34:32] he opened the door slowly and held the
[1:34:35] door like this
[1:34:36] then when he was assad
[1:34:38] close the door so he's protecting the
[1:34:40] door anybody okay
[1:34:42] he held the door after him and he said i
[1:34:45] pray you water
[1:34:47] brethren
[1:34:48] the breathing of lord
[1:34:51] the brethren of lord
[1:34:53] i pray you brethren
[1:34:55] do not sow what
[1:34:57] behold now
[1:34:59] i have
[1:35:01] can you say it aloud
[1:35:03] i have two daughters which water
[1:35:08] so those daughters were water
[1:35:11] everybody okay
[1:35:12] they were virgin amen but when they came
[1:35:15] out of sodom
[1:35:18] everybody okay
[1:35:19] because their mother also died
[1:35:22] only two virgins came out
[1:35:25] everybody okay
[1:35:26] they are not so in other words the
[1:35:29] message of the two angels could only
[1:35:32] save two virgins
[1:35:35] amen but those women even though they
[1:35:38] were virgins they were foolish virgins
[1:35:42] because they went and slept with their
[1:35:44] father
[1:35:46] they were not wise virgin
[1:35:51] but here they went and slept with their
[1:35:54] own father they were not wise virgins
[1:35:57] even though they were saved so what i'm
[1:35:59] trying to say is any anointing that is
[1:36:03] separate from the second oil will take
[1:36:06] you in the tribulation it is a
[1:36:09] tribulation anointing
[1:36:15] amen so don't be impressed
[1:36:18] in the pentecostal world
[1:36:20] because the bible say many shall come in
[1:36:22] my name and they will say have we not
[1:36:25] prophesied have we not cast our devil
[1:36:28] have we not done a lot of miracles and
[1:36:30] jesus said i never knew you because it's
[1:36:33] a tribulation anointing
[1:36:43] that the nominal believer like who
[1:36:46] has got he's going through the water
[1:36:50] tribulation period and be safe after he
[1:36:53] was by fire
[1:36:55] noah went through the tribulation period
[1:36:58] carried above it came out with him who
[1:37:01] polluted the earth again
[1:37:02] lot came out his own water did what
[1:37:07] you can read it at home and had children
[1:37:09] by his own water
[1:37:11] but abraham brought forth the water
[1:37:14] because somebody was with abraham that
[1:37:17] was discerning the thought and the
[1:37:20] intent of the heart
[1:37:21] that was a separate message
[1:37:24] that's the brad message
[1:37:28] [Music]
[1:37:29] everybody okay
[1:37:31] he says he brought forth the seed of the
[1:37:33] promise enoch went to glory in the water
[1:37:37] just took a walk and went home he never
[1:37:40] went through the water
[1:37:42] the other oil even though it's oil you
[1:37:45] won't make it with it there is only one
[1:37:48] oil that makes you ready it's the oil
[1:37:50] that is make you wise and it's all of
[1:37:53] christ
[1:37:54] christ who is the wisdom of god
[1:37:57] everybody okay so far so that's why we
[1:37:59] understand that it's very important
[1:38:02] to understand that what we have is more
[1:38:05] than power
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:08] we have power plus
[1:38:11] you remember on sunday
[1:38:13] amen because paul said that i know in
[1:38:16] part
[1:38:18] so the knowledge of paul was important
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:22] and he also prophesied in part
[1:38:26] so paul was a prophet
[1:38:29] everybody okay but when that which is
[1:38:32] perfect is come
[1:38:33] that which is part is water
[1:38:36] we already explained you this and we
[1:38:38] found out that paul was afraid why he
[1:38:41] was afraid he said i'm afraid
[1:38:43] i fear because as the serpent began eve
[1:38:47] through water
[1:38:49] subtlety
[1:38:50] subtlety
[1:38:52] what is sability my friend
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:56] brother problem says this
[1:38:58] that's the big the beast from the
[1:39:00] beginning you remember on sunday he was
[1:39:03] the best at the garden of eden everybody
[1:39:05] okay
[1:39:06] and he is the beast at the end
[1:39:08] and shows that he is a religious person
[1:39:11] and a denomination everybody okay so far
[1:39:14] now on sunday we established two adam
[1:39:19] okay
[1:39:20] the bible says that the first man adam
[1:39:23] was made a living soul it's written in
[1:39:27] genesis
[1:39:28] and the last adam not the second last so
[1:39:31] you don't bring another one amen
[1:39:34] was made a quickening spirit everybody
[1:39:37] okay
[1:39:39] paul now explained this
[1:39:41] he says how bit
[1:39:43] that was not first which is spiritual in
[1:39:46] other words the spiritual adam never
[1:39:49] came first
[1:39:50] the one who started was a natural adam
[1:39:54] amen in genesis you would never see
[1:39:56] jesus there because because jesus is the
[1:39:58] second adam the one who started is adam
[1:40:01] the natural man paul said not the first
[1:40:04] which is spiritual but that which is
[1:40:06] what nacho adam and after all that which
[1:40:09] is what
[1:40:10] so first is start with adam then jesus
[1:40:13] will follow adam amen
[1:40:16] the first man is on earth
[1:40:18] they pull him from the ground hey but
[1:40:20] here earthly but the second man is the
[1:40:24] lord from what
[1:40:25] ever here so on sunday we establish two
[1:40:29] adam
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:32] we found out that in heaven
[1:40:35] god
[1:40:37] was the president
[1:40:39] you remember
[1:40:41] amen
[1:40:42] glory to god
[1:40:43] and on the earth and the vice president
[1:40:46] of heaven
[1:40:48] was lucifer we we gave you all the
[1:40:50] detail on sunday
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:53] and we found on the earth
[1:40:55] because adam was the god of the earth
[1:40:58] we found that the president was adam
[1:41:02] amen if you didn't catch this you go
[1:41:05] back on sunday and the first president
[1:41:08] was who
[1:41:09] we demonstrated this clearly and we
[1:41:12] found that the serpent was the vice
[1:41:15] president amen
[1:41:17] now that serpent
[1:41:19] paul was afraid of the subtlety
[1:41:23] of the serpent amen on sunday we found
[1:41:26] out that the word subtility means to be
[1:41:30] smart
[1:41:32] everybody okay
[1:41:33] to be crafty
[1:41:35] everybody here
[1:41:37] but brother branham added another one he
[1:41:40] says that the best interpretation
[1:41:43] the easiest one is to be crafty
[1:41:46] is to be smart everybody can get that
[1:41:49] amen but brother branham said the best
[1:41:54] so subtity
[1:42:00] first we spoke on sunday that it's smart
[1:42:03] we spoke on sunday that it's to be
[1:42:05] crafty
[1:42:06] we found out that amen
[1:42:08] because the serpent was the more sadder
[1:42:10] but brother branham said the best
[1:42:12] definition
[1:42:13] is coming from the hebrew word that
[1:42:15] means maha
[1:42:17] what does it means it means somebody
[1:42:20] that is heaven
[1:42:22] everybody here a chew
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:26] knowledge of what
[1:42:29] of the principles of life
[1:42:32] what does it mean
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:36] you already understand smart
[1:42:38] you understand crafty let's get into
[1:42:40] this a little bit
[1:42:43] you ready
[1:42:44] let's go to the book of uh
[1:42:47] second samuel chapter 13.
[1:42:52] if i can push this we'll be good on
[1:42:55] sunday
[1:42:56] if you dare you can say amen

[1:57:20] you need to have discernment
[1:57:25] you will think you are talking to a man
[1:57:28] by you not talking to ammon
[1:57:30] ammon became jonah that made flesh

[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] [Applause]

[1:58:02] the appearance of ammon
[1:58:04] don't be caught up with what you know
[1:58:06] about ammon because john adam is already
[1:58:10] flesh
[1:58:11] in ammon
[1:58:14] how did satan become the beast
[1:58:17] [Music]

[1:58:36] eve was talking to the devil mad flesh
[1:58:40] in the serpent
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:47] that's why brother branham preached the
[1:58:49] discernment of the spirit
[1:58:52] you need to catch the spirit
[1:58:54] what is the spirit behind
[1:58:56] because the name might change
[1:58:59] the mask my change the physiological
[1:59:02] might change but it's the same old devil
[1:59:05] it is the same spirit it is the same
[1:59:08] anointing
[1:59:12] glory to god
[1:59:14] i need to land this ship buddy i wish i

[2:00:19] i can take this and go to the parent

[2:01:24] signal sister
[2:01:26] i want to meet with you but i don't want
[2:01:27] nobody to be there

[2:01:35] you'll find yourself in a hotel
[2:01:37] and you don't know how you got in the
[2:01:38] hotel
[2:01:40] because you cannot handle the serpent

[2:01:44] and almond said to them bring me the
[2:01:47] meat into the water

[2:02:01] are down which she has made and brought
[2:02:04] them into the chamber of amnon
[2:02:07] her brother and when she had brought

[2:02:13] and said to her
[2:02:15] come lie with me my sister which love is
[2:02:18] this
[2:02:18] inordinate love
[2:02:20] it is against the law amen

[2:02:27] for no such thing or to be done in
[2:02:29] israel do not use this word
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] folly
[2:02:36] it's fully
[2:02:38] can i continue
[2:02:39] and uh and
[2:02:42] let me drop down to verse for the sake
[2:02:44] of time let me
[2:02:48] jump down to verse 15
[2:02:50] uh 14. however he will not hearken to
[2:02:53] her voice
[2:02:54] but being stronger
[2:02:56] than she
[2:02:57] force her
[2:02:59] and lay with her
[2:03:00] then ammon
[2:03:03] can i continue
[2:03:04] he hated her how
[2:03:07] exceedingly so that the hatred where
[2:03:11] with he hated her was greater than the
[2:03:15] love is this real love
[2:03:17] well if he had loved her
[2:03:19] are you there
[2:03:20] and amman said to her
[2:03:23] arise and go water
[2:03:26] and be gone
[2:03:27] everybody here

[2:03:41] that minister to him and say
[2:03:44] put now
[2:03:45] tamar
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:51] i thought her name was tema

[2:04:05] did we get it did we get it now it's no
[2:04:08] more tema it is ah
[2:04:10] it was the beast against though
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:19] what are you trying to say what i'm
[2:04:21] trying to say is
[2:04:22] subtly
[2:04:24] give the serpent
[2:04:26] number one the ability to deviate
[2:04:30] somebody from the faith
[2:04:34] and number two he gives the ability to
[2:04:37] break virginity
[2:04:44] and the serpent
[2:04:45] was sadder
[2:04:48] very sad though the native beast of the
[2:04:51] field everybody here
[2:04:53] brother branham said the only way for
[2:04:56] satan to accomplish what he wanted to do
[2:04:59] was to enter the water
[2:05:01] because subtlety was already there
[2:05:04] and if it's shelter
[2:05:08] everybody care so the only way i can get
[2:05:11] into and destroy this woman i need
[2:05:14] subtility
[2:05:15] and subtility was already in the serpent
[2:05:18] and subtlety knows how to break the wall
[2:05:21] of protection and get and destroy
[2:05:24] virginity
[2:05:28] everybody okay
[2:05:30] the trail of the serpent he says and the
[2:05:32] only way was to enter the serpent in
[2:05:34] eden even as he entered by evil spirit
[2:05:38] into the swan of gaga edgardo
[2:05:40] god does not enter
[2:05:48] so right here we have now we understand
[2:05:52] that satan always uses the system of a
[2:05:57] beast
[2:06:02] can now continue
[2:06:04] satan can enter human being but he can
[2:06:07] also enter animal
[2:06:12] amen
[2:06:14] let me continue
[2:06:15] god
[2:06:16] does not enter animal but satan can
[2:06:20] and will to accomplish water
[2:06:23] he could not have a child directly by
[2:06:25] eve as did god by mary no creation
[2:06:29] remember on sunday so he entered into
[2:06:32] the serpent and then began eve he said
[2:06:36] use hair and by hair did satan have a
[2:06:39] child vicariously
[2:06:41] cain
[2:06:42] brought the full spiritual
[2:06:44] characteristic of who
[2:06:46] and the animalistic
[2:06:49] essential
[2:06:50] fleshly characteristic of water
[2:06:54] now the true
[2:06:56] relationship between human and beast
[2:06:59] head cross
[2:07:03] unlawful
[2:07:04] in other words subtimity
[2:07:07] can is professional to unlawful
[2:07:10] relationship
[2:07:14] amen
[2:07:16] everybody here
[2:07:18] let me get here and finish it no wonder
[2:07:21] the holy spirit said that cain was off
[2:07:24] the water
[2:07:30] that's why
[2:07:32] the beast
[2:07:34] satan
[2:07:35] what branham says this
[2:07:38] in revelation 11
[2:07:40] i can't get to this variable
[2:07:43] in revelation 13
[2:07:46] all of them are locked
[2:07:47] i can drop into this in revelation 17
[2:07:52] there
[2:07:53] were beasts in other words you go to
[2:07:55] this
[2:07:56] three chapter you will see the name
[2:07:58] beast
[2:08:00] everybody
[2:08:01] you go to revelation 11 he spoke about
[2:08:04] the beast that's the first time the
[2:08:06] beast is mentioned in the book of
[2:08:07] revelation
[2:08:08] you go to revelation 13 there is two
[2:08:11] beasts one coming out of the water one
[2:08:13] coming out of the sea you go to
[2:08:15] revelation 17 you will see also a beast
[2:08:18] the beast that was which was and which
[2:08:20] to come which was which was to come
[2:08:22] there is always beast beast bishops
[2:08:24] today
[2:08:26] everybody okay brother branham say his
[2:08:28] call beast the same way but the beast
[2:08:31] there the interpretation is theron
[2:08:35] the greek word is tyralon
[2:08:38] which means a wild
[2:08:42] anthem
[2:08:44] beast because the serpent in the
[2:08:47] category was in the category of wild
[2:08:51] animal
[2:08:54] amen
[2:08:55] that's why every beast that he uses
[2:08:59] must be wild
[2:09:03] everybody okay
[2:09:04] brother branham say what an antenna
[2:09:07] beast
[2:09:08] but soon
[2:09:10] means a creature or a living creature
[2:09:13] what brother branham is saying is when
[2:09:15] you look at the living creature the four
[2:09:18] anointing one like a lion one like an ox
[2:09:21] one like a man one like a flying ego the
[2:09:24] word there is creature
[2:09:26] but if you go every time they say beast
[2:09:29] they are telling you it's a savage
[2:09:33] it's an animalistic world
[2:09:35] but the creature are not savage
[2:09:38] the living beings are not savage
[2:09:40] creature
[2:09:42] everybody okay he said the four living
[2:09:45] zone or creature not the best world the
[2:09:48] tyrion but the zun the living creature
[2:09:51] the therion is a wide and temp savage
[2:09:55] in other words if you watch revelation
[2:09:58] water
[2:09:59] it's the water
[2:10:01] we will get that down the road
[2:10:03] revelation 13 it's the water
[2:10:06] we will get there down the road the
[2:10:08] revelation 17 is buff water
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:14] the beast at the beginning
[2:10:16] and they'll be stayed there
[2:10:19] everybody okay he said of
[2:10:22] denominational churches consolidated
[2:10:25] with catholicism make them water
[2:10:29] water
[2:10:32] their anointing cannot work
[2:10:35] you cannot unite them with the broth
[2:10:38] those are tribulation anointing
[2:10:41] they are term anointing
[2:10:43] that's why the bible says that the great
[2:10:47] dragon was caster that water
[2:10:51] called the water
[2:10:52] why is he called the devil while he was
[2:10:55] a beast he was called a devil because
[2:10:59] jordan
[2:11:00] was made flesh in ammon
[2:11:03] because the devil was made flesh into
[2:11:06] the serpent now the serpent becomes the
[2:11:09] devil now satan become the beast
[2:11:14] any question
[2:11:16] let's stand
[2:11:18] [Music]
[2:11:20] [Applause]
[2:11:27] i went nine minutes over
[2:11:33] i'm sorry i could not reach where i
[2:11:35] wanted to reach but i want you to get
[2:11:37] that the word subtility
[2:11:40] use wisdom
[2:11:42] daddy use wisdom
[2:11:44] mama use wisdom
[2:11:47] use wisdom use the word of god discern
[2:11:50] the spirit behind
[2:11:52] no matter what the name says
[2:11:55] even if the name say message of the hour
[2:11:57] the name say christian the name say bar
[2:12:01] jesus the son of jesus the son of god
[2:12:04] all those name
[2:12:05] watch the spirit behind because you can
[2:12:08] be fooled by the brother you can because
[2:12:11] more damage by a brother so-called
[2:12:14] message believer because you are you are
[2:12:17] fooled by the name message believer
[2:12:20] because you never look no matter if you
[2:12:22] are message believer we need to see your
[2:12:25] fruit i want to see the working in your
[2:12:28] life if your working is not lined up
[2:12:30] with the word
[2:12:32] no matter how beautiful they look
[2:12:34] no matter how smart and crafty that boy
[2:12:38] look
[2:12:40] stay away
[2:12:42] amen
[2:12:43] because if the devil already infiltrated
[2:12:46] their subtility they know the principle
[2:12:50] of life they know biology they know how
[2:12:53] to get around the woman
[2:12:55] they know what to do how did the serpent
[2:12:58] in one shot got him pregnant
[2:13:00] who taught him the circle of a woman
[2:13:02] because he has the maha he knew the
[2:13:05] principle of life he understood the
[2:13:08] sucker of eve eve was innocent she
[2:13:10] didn't know what she was doing the
[2:13:12] serpent was looking he said you're a
[2:13:14] small girl you don't understand yourself
[2:13:16] amen
[2:13:18] he knew he understood things better
[2:13:20] amen
[2:13:21] let's pray heavenly father
[2:13:23] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:13:25] tonight
[2:13:26] father once again thanking you for your
[2:13:29] grace for your love your mercy
[2:13:31] and for everything you have been doing
[2:13:33] for us
[2:13:34] father these things are unfold
[2:13:37] for a purpose
[2:13:39] because your prophet told us that to
[2:13:41] overcome
[2:13:42] we must recognize the devil
[2:13:44] in all his tricks lord
[2:13:46] father david
[2:13:48] slept up
[2:13:49] did not understand
[2:13:51] did not even question why do you need
[2:13:54] your sister to come home
[2:13:56] if you would have stopped and think
[2:13:58] twice
[2:13:59] probably this damage could not be
[2:14:02] made
[2:14:03] but father we don't know we don't want
[2:14:06] to go like people
[2:14:08] to whom the wisdom of god was not
[2:14:10] expressed in the same time lord you
[2:14:12] broke the seals you unfolded the trace
[2:14:15] of the serpent you unfolded all the
[2:14:17] mystery of the antichrist and you want
[2:14:20] your children to be aware and to know
[2:14:22] clearly because eve did not know what we
[2:14:26] know today lord father the seventh seal
[2:14:29] in genesis was quiet all that they say
[2:14:31] was god rested in the seventh day it
[2:14:34] took the end time to break the seals and
[2:14:37] because of the locking of the seals for
[2:14:39] the humanity has been falling one after
[2:14:42] the other under the trap of the devil
[2:14:44] but further the center
[2:14:47] it's a different oil
[2:14:49] it's a separate oil it's a second oil
[2:14:51] load it's an oil that is opening your
[2:14:54] eyes off your children so that they can
[2:14:56] discern through everything the devil can
[2:14:59] bring and recognize the devil in his
[2:15:02] trick lord and not fall for what seems
[2:15:05] to be fleshy or good in the eyes father
[2:15:07] may you continue to minister to them and
[2:15:10] if anybody is sick tonight father lord
[2:15:12] we pray that you touch their body and
[2:15:15] may you heal them lord father may you
[2:15:17] remember the needs of your children in
[2:15:19] their life lord may you strengthen our
[2:15:21] elder who's here in the midst of us lord
[2:15:24] and father touch his body and give him
[2:15:26] more energy father we commit everything
[2:15:29] unto the hand may you give travel mercy
[2:15:31] to your children as they go into their
[2:15:33] respective place after the worship lord
[2:15:36] father be with us and keep everything
[2:15:38] lord under the blood in the name of
[2:15:40] jesus christ
