very good singing very good music playing I would like to greet my precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ tonight I would like to give thanks to brother Sten you know from the in the Lord for entrusting me with a full sermon um I believe that uh the Lord will not disappoint um because it's not me to begin with um before I start I would like to glorify the Lord even more by saying that uh what the Lord was showing me for today um around last week Monday when brother uh Timothy aong um ministered it kind of was in line and then Sunday the Lord kind of put a stamp on it with with a bullseye so I know I'm in the I'm in the line of duty I know uh the Lord is behind this so um as you open your Bibles take our reading um I would like to go to Revelations 9 verse uh this came from uh inspiration from uh demonology number two um because I was uh as I was listening uh to demonology number one where the Aaron preached and then I was like okay and then uh you know because we know that you know there's 200 million demons that are released right and I said okay there's 200 million demons but I know there's not 200 million diseases so the demons are somewhere else you know where are they you know there's more demons out there so um so I started uh searching my scriptures and the Lord was rilling it on to me and um I like to read Revelations 9 verse6 uh so it reads the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 and I heard the number of them um see so with 200,000,000 so this is why you know it's good to in school you know your numerical placeholders because it's 200 so it's 20 200,000 so that's two z0000 z, extra z00 Z so that's 200 million that's how you get the re re revelation of it see so now go to uh Matthew 24:24 when you get there say Amen all right um it it reads for there for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect that's why I would like to take my uh title as as of if it were possible okay um so as we um bow our heads in prayer put God first Lord God we come unto you humbly father God Jesus Christ Our God the beginning the end father God the author and finisher of our faith Lord God the rose of Shan father God the Bright Morning Star father God father God you're the all in all father God all things are made for you and by you lord god father God Jesus Christ Lord God here you're everything Lord Jesus Christ Lord God father God you're a just God father God your Sovereign father God Jesus Christ Lord God father God we pray father God that if there's anything father God that's blocking father God the anointing Lord God that's blocking father God the the channels father God we pray Lord Jesus Christ father that you remove it father God father God we're here for you Lord God Jesus for this while we're here father God father God you will not disappoint Lord Jesus Christ father God for your word will not come back into your Void Lord God father God I pray Lord God that you give me Father God the ability Lord Jesus Christ to reveal father God the Revelation you showed me and the magnitude that you showed it to me Father God and I'm able to reveal it father God to your sheep father God feed your sheep Lord God father God we pray all these things Lord God putting you first Lord Jesus Christ Lord God father God for that if the God is in the pull pits the God God is in the the pews if God is in the pull pit father God until our MS meet something is bound to happen Lord God father God we put you first Lord God God Jesus Christ's name we pray father amen right be seated all right um so I would like to read um this this uh excerpt from uh brother brandom this 64719 in the morning the Feast of the trumpets it's talking about those 200 million demons okay so it says um notice 200 million he said 200,000 demons but you see it's just like the 144,000 still you know what he was saying you CAU the Revelation see so it says uh turn loose upon those Jews see so that's where they were I believe we went over that in the hotel it says um then I skipped down on 75 what has it done in the com as he said he'd come in like flatteries and what has he done bringing the Protestant economical Council of the world churches the spirit of the Antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loose in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loose upon what not upon denominations upon the bride see so um then I would like to go down to uh Christ is the Myster of God revealed in 63 says think of it holy men couldn't put your finger nowhere on their life the father's life grandfather's life or the great great great great great grandfather's lives if they did they died in shame they were stoned to death see so um and then I would like to read the scripture that the Lord brought to me after this because um I'm bringing you to a thought and I pray the Lord allows me to to bring you to the thought okay so second Peter so you don't have to go to them um uh if you you can if you want to but I have all the scriptures right here just I'm saying so you know what I'm reading uh second Peter 2 1-2 but there shall arise false prophets among the people and and there shall be false teachers among you see and then I'mma drop down too it says many shall follow their pernicious ways see every time a big word pops up in the scriptures I like to look at it because usually it's pretty common speech but when that's put in there putting there for a reason see it says pricious means having a harmful effect in a gradual way see so at first first happens it's not going to see if you give Satan an inch it'll take a mile so he comes in real real slight see so it says uh 2 Corinthians 11: 2-4 see because so it says for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espouse you to one husband see I'm going present you a Chase version of Christ but I fear lest by any means as a spirit as a serpent begal Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted in the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preaches to another Jesus whom we have not preached or received another Spirit we have not received another or another gospel who we have not accepted see and I would like to um parallel this with brother brandham because brother brandham said the exact same thing see he said I'm here to try to help you because I love you you're my children that have gotten to Christ I claim every one of you I claim you tonight see and he goes on down and he says um um I espouse you to Christ gave you to Christ as a chased virgin see see I'm I'm I'm trying to get you to a thought see spous the Christ as a Chase version see um now go to Galatians 1 6-8 ver10 see what was that other Jesus see because because if it verse six reads I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ into another gospel which is not another so it's not another gospel it's not another they're not calling it something else they they're still saying Jesus but but it's in the it's not Jesus it's not that it's the old shoe bread it's the dead word it's not the revealed word it's not the fesh shoe bread that that that's in the in the in in the Tabernacle that's every every Sabbath is is refreshed see um it says um now he see it's a subtle demon see because it says Galatians 5 7-9 says you did run well who did hinder that you should not obey the truth this persuasion that's another way saying subtlety see that Satan right there see cometh not of him that calleth you the le le the whole lump see so um okay um in 1 Corinthians 5 6-12 see because this is following the little 11 see um your glorying is not good know you not the live 11 little 11 leth the whole lump right see oh because uh what does that mean glorifying is not good see it says therefore let see that's 1 Corinthians 3:21 therefore let no let no man glory in men for all things are yours see so stop don't look at the man see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof see that's the false anointed ones in the end times just uh but denying the power that's denying Jesus denying Calvary refusing the main thing see now um in uh I praise the Lord uh Abraham's Grace COV okay 61 the Antichrist in the last days so religious even Pentecostal so it would reive the very elected if it were possible that's right see Billy GM said the other night in his message he said the devil is so roaring until he's absolutely deceived the elected I thought oh oh Billy you made a mistake there that's right you can't deceive the elected because they're secure with Christ see the Bible said that this Antichrist would be so close that would deceive the very if it was possible that's right see cuz it's not possible it can't happen will happen no sir see sir see no sir see all right all right now see take your time see I thank God uh that I don't have to bear the scars of of uh years of denominational teachings or I don't have to or I'm not or I'm not bearing the scars of years of incorrect message teaching but right now the young people we have the unadulterated we have the body word Mind Of God right now see see because see don't make this a tradition see don't make Church a tradition don't make don't make don't make the brothers Mee a tradition don't make the Sisters Meeting a tradition don't make don't make the the church meet a tradition because you got to thank God that you got it see because because you cannot you cannot try to get the Holy Ghost on the on the on on on a cult toils of your parents see because it's an individual Affair see God God don't have grandchildren see see because see because you have to be certain of God see and in the message being certain of God brother Bram talked about how this lateran age is a is a is a uh what's the word it's a it's a idolatrous age see and the Lord hit on that hit on that a while ago see it's an adulterous age because in in the in the message be certain of God brother Brenham he referenced how uh when Elijah went to that woman the widow woman of how the drought that was going on at that time the drought it was a reflection of the sin it was reflection of the idolatry at that age see see now when she was now the widow woman when she was going she was picking up two sticks that's right and what do the two sticks represent what did the prophet tell us it was the two scks was the cross see see and did not the Bible say God say I pick up the cross and follow me forsake all else see so if you're certain of God have you trly forsaken everything else because look you got this right here it's right here every time you walk into church you got this looking at you right here that's a Rich Young Ruler right there have you truly forsaken everything see see see and there's a reason there's a reason why that's up there see now see because because because we're pilgrims see we're pilgrims looking for a for a city not made by the hands of men but made by the hands of God see see because see and thank God that you're the you're part of that if it was possible see because because see did not see yes sir see did not did not the prophet like an election unto a quilt see was not was not the quilt now the lady when she got the quilt she had to purchase the whole the whole material she had to purchase everything right right so when she purchased a quilt when people say oh well God died for everybody well yeah he did but but look he knew who would accept him there was elected portion see when she when that lady B the quilt she knew what portion she was going to use outside of the in the quilt so she took the part she was going to use and threw the other side away see see because because see because God knows who he's going to use God doesn't waste his time he's an on time God see God will not return to him void because before the foundation of the earth he knew who would accept him that's right see see so so and because you're elected you have no right to look down on the sinner see because because because you're saved by God's grace see see see we're we're save we're saved by his grace see see with with Abraham how how was it reckoned uncircumcision circumcision no it was reckoned in uncircumcision he wasn't if you in a church Message Church nothing it don't matter see it's uncircumcision see it was predestinated he received the promise when he was uncircumcised see see see what did uh what what did God say to uh to Nathaniel oh behold isite in whom there is no G see behold my Gentile bride to whom there is no spot nor wrinkle see see see now look see see see now look oh Lord uh when is thou knowest me see that word know see I wish I wish brother brother C was here because I heard him talking to my dad about something see and that's why I love listening to the elders because they got so much wisdom in them so much Revelation in them see cuz cuz the scripture tell tells you the scripture tells you to be uh uh Qui to hear and slow to speak see so always listen see see see that word see that word no see that word when you knowest me see in the scriptures that's used many times in in uh in uh intimate relations see and intimate relations Is type with the with the Holy with the holies for holies is not see and and and for for for for humans for for uh take for humans when your intimate relations Is the highest degree of love you can show by draining in one to somebody see because we have that feel your love we have that agape love see see and and and with the um with the when thou knowest me Lord when did you love me so much see when did you when did you choose me see see why why am I not that part why am I that if it was possible why me see see why am I part of that see he said before before the foundation of the world I chose you so you was in the back part of my mind see before the foundation of the world see before the foundation of the world see when you grow outside see the trees I was the the the grass I was see see the the the clouds I was see see when you see see see see I was I was before all of that and my d in construction all my life so I know I I picked up some things this building right here has has a foundation you can't see the foundation of the building see the foundation of the building see when when you're when the construction starts you got to dig down first that's right and and and and don't that don't that s like the pyramid got to go down and go up see see don't that don't don't that sound like the story of Jesus Christ went down and went up see when he made the the foundation of of the world the foundation of this building they went down put the concrete slabs in it and then he built up see see that means if I apply that the scriptures if the scriptures are consistent that must mean that that before the foundation of this world before the very axis that's keeping this the Earth the Earth centered before the very gravity that keeps the Earth in rotation I was before that see and and and if that holds true if that if that that hold if that holds true that means when God was was all covering all space and all time the Elohim the Jehovah I was right there I was with him see see and then when he condensed himself into the pillar of fire I was still there and then and then when he made the earth I was creating the Earth with him because he made the Earth for me see see that's why that's why I I I can walk and there can be a bull and I can tell the bull I'm just passing by Bo see that's why that's why I can talk to the bees when I'm cutting my grass see that's why I can cause to tell the Sun and the Moon to stop see that's why I can stop that's why that's why I can stop the rain for three years and six months cuz want man are like passions see see see see cuz it was made for me see look God had a threefold plan what was that what was that threefold plan that three-fold plan was God in Christ Christ in me and then and then Christ me and then it was to to restore back to restore back the Garden of Eden position see see see look see see in the title Christ is the mystery of God Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's why did he not say Jesus Christ is the mystery of God revealed uhuh why didn't he say that no take your God is very particular that's right see and and anointed ones in the last in the end time not the prophet Prophet tell us that Christ means the anointed one that's right so so if I apply that uhuh take your time one in the end time if I apply that to myself because if there's a false anointed ones that's right there has to be you anoint to see if there's a bogus that has to be a real do see see so so and did God not say that the father uh I and the Father the father me and I and you that's right did did he not say uh look at the works that I do and he said if you don't believe me believe the works I do they speak of did he not say did he not come right around and then say uh these works you shall do even greater that's see what does that mean see that means I'm God that's exactly what that means see see look see look see see see see that means that that means that I am God see and and and and what just happened what just happened Sunday a war cry went out what that's right what do I mean by war cry no such thing as happen stance why did Brother child lamb church Preach exact same thing brother why why no such thing as happen stance see see see because what read your Bible what did what did Satan say to Eve to get her to fall what did he what did he tell her what did he say Satan said he said if you uh he he said he said you'll be like God knowing good and evil that's right she was already God see see that's why that's exactly why that's exactly why the second Eve won't fall cuz she in CA the Revelation that she's already God see we have Satan's answer see see see see see see and look and look and look look don't don't be no Pharisee and fight the Revelation see what did what did Brother B say a Pharisee was see he said why is they so blind what is the Pharisee because they rejected the Revelation see so don't reject the Revelation accept it it's you just take it it's not it's not hard see see see see you're a God see you can't say oh how my God got this going on my life this going on life God told you God worthy one made you worthy you're God see it's accept it leave it alone see see see because see because see see because Satan's scared right now see see Satan Satan knows Satan knows the threefold plan of God Satan knows that it's God in Christ and Christ in me see all that was in God the Father all that was in Christ there was all put in me so that means that all that was in God what in Christ is in me so all that is in God is in me see see so so so so San heard it right now s got 200 million demons he's freaking out right now he press all his buttons right now see see see see see you probably even started fighting already see see see because because brother brandom yes sir called himself a typologist right that's exactly right and right I'm follow the thought take your follow the the the Old Testament was a shadow of the things to come that's right written from written for admonition and learning uhhuh that's right in the old Old Testament kept typing Christ kep kept typing Christ kept typing Christ God in flesh kept saying God in flesh kept saying God in flesh and then Old Testament then New Testament came right God in flesh came right no one picked it up that's right no one got it that's right see that's right and if this message in this Bible are w why is it that brother brandham always said friends I believe we're in the shadow of the coming of the Lord see so if I apply that same principle Old Testament New Testament brother bham time my time right right shadow of the coming of the Lord don't miss it coming to the Lord just came it's already here see see see see because word God just God just had his whole bride right he's telling his whole bride that second part of the plan right sir is Christ in you right it's God in you right it's me in you if I'm in you then you are me see see am you are that mystery see see I'm I I'm going to go to a scripture see see it says um see because not him that with us not by him that runneth but by him that uh by the grace of God see see it says uh where the scripture see uh it's Colossians 1 yes sir verse uh 26 yes sir even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but is now made manifest to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles we're the Gentiles see which is Christ in you the hope of glory see see the only see brother bar said the only way you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you see see see that means he's recognized you see see look I got another quote uh I got another quote it reads it reads it reads yes sir this is this is this quote comes from Christ is a misery of God revealed 63 amen it reads look uhhuh Christ in you makes him the center of of life of the Revelation yes sir that's right Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation yes sir Christ in you makes you the complete re of the whole thing see see see see see look because because see see Satan knows his time is running out see see because because Satan done Satan he doing this for years thousands of years he knows what it means when it looks like when a true son and daughter of God catches the revelation of who they are see see so so he's seen it many times see and he's seing it again happening right now see see he it's happening right now see see so so so you better be ready for a fight because the fight's coming because Satan saw it and Satan's going to send all his demons at you and 200 million demons are coming for you see see see but I but I feel Invincible you know why that's right you know why because I got my helmet I got my breast plate I got my Lo GED I got I'm shot my feet is shot I got my shield and my favorite part got the sword and what is the sword word the spirit word see the word kill us but the spirit give us life what is that saying that means in my hand I have the divine revelation mind of God in my hand see that means that means that I have see because of the teaching of brother even gave us see my armor was polished see ien been made I ien been made a well-taught demon killer see see look see look look follow me follow me follow me look is is God's word not quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword Divine the center the soul and the spirit the joint and Marrow the the the of the thoughts and the tense of the heart don't tell me that sword ain't real what's the sword brother bam had in his hand see what's that sword that came down in his hand oh that was the king sword no it's Kings is mine cuz I'm God see see see so that sword is mine too see see see see see see see so that so that store sir that divine revelation that I got see I told y I like Timothy see cuz he was a soldier see see see see I like I like David and Goliath too yes sir because D David what happened with David and Goliath Goliath was a big lip blubbering demon and and guess what and guess what after after after the uh the army of God Isel caught the Revelation that God told him that you I'm with you see God just told us he's with us he's in us he just told us we're God see that's what he told in Ty that's what he told the armies Israel that's right and you got the Philistines came in cuz they heard it Satan knew what was happening so he sent his army right all the Philistines came and right now God just told you you're God some people's fighting that Revelation see some people trying to figure it out see don't try to figure it out see see just believe it because he he done gave you a teacher anyway so so he done made it simple as possible anyway so stop trying to figure it out see you're God see look look look it took one person that caught the full Revelation that they're God he said that unbelieving Dem me don't shut up see he said he said man he said man let me go deal with him real quick see he said see that that uh he went down and dealt with him see and guess what that big old demon he was just a big Bluff anyway bump in the road he was just talking and that and and look look what happened when it came down to it he still a even do nothing to begin with he was just still talking see see and then and then and then what did the person with the sword in her hand do see what what what did he do he said I got time to talk to you I'm about my father's business I'mma kill you see see I'mma I'mma chop your head off see see he chopped his head off see he and look and look look that that's what I like it because see this sword I got see I can chop his head off see he I need 200 million demons it ain't hard to miss one to 200 million of them so I'm hit something see see see see see look see so look so look after sir after David cut his head off that's right after cut the Demon's head off he picked his head up that's right he picked his head up that's right and what happened yes sir all the armies of God yes sir caught the Revelation finally they finally caught the Revelation and then after they caught the Revelation the demons realized they caught it and they started running cuz they got scared see and guess what and what did the Army God do they chased him and killed them see see and I picked the head up and I showed it to my festar general j s s and I showed it to him and I still have the sword in my hand because the job ain't done yet I got 199,999 999 demons left to go see see see look see see so since AOS that dialysis demon it head was picked up see and what happened that Demon's head was picked up Sister Kelly the Demon's running it's scared go kill it see see see see look look see and that and and and I also and I also you think of also when that thought that thought C me to another thought of uh of Israel when Israel was told of the pro was told of the promised land see and when Israel was told of the promised land God told him this is yours see he said he said I'm Yours see I'm typing I'm typing it right now see he said he's that you're God go take it because after you get a revelation you have to get the you you have to take it for yourself first see it's hearing the word you hear it the word of God and accepting it so I you just heard it yeah you heard it but did you accept the word that he told you he he told you that you're God you take that you're God see see so so yes sir so he told him that follow that Spirit he told Israel yes sir to go and take the promise that's right see and on the way to get the promise there was all wrapped up in the gifts and the oh the milk and the honey the grapes all the big stuff you see and what happened when they found out they had to fight they got scared see it was on it was on a loudspeaker a couple Services ago see it was on a loudspeaker brother bam said he said the church got it wrong he said he said it's not a picnic he said it's a battlefield it's a war see after you accept the Revelation Satan's come right s's coming right behind it cuz he wants to fight that Revelation see see after after Jesus told Adam and Eve their God Satan came right behind and tried to fight it with with he said you'll be like God if you uh know good and evil I'm already am God what are you talking about see see see so look so look he told he told them to go take the promise they got scared they got scared when it was time to fight am and when it when it was when it took only two people actually took the Revelation that's it that was Joseph no sorry not Joseph Joshua and Caleb yes sir and they went and they fought now now they were giants right that's right GL was a giant GL was a type of of a demon right I wonder how many demons was in Canaan land was it 200 million of them because they're type type of demon too right right so does that not mean that after you accept revelation after after God told you that you're God and Satan comes and you got to know you got to fight you got to fight the demons afterwards see see so amen me see take your time see because some's going to receive it and some's not right see some people going to take the revelation of they're God and some's not going to take the revelation of their God see so get ready for a fight is not Satan like a roaring lion seeking who he may devour that's right didn't David picked that demon by his face by his by his by his his name and killed him right see so so we got the devil's answer so it's like Elisha watching Elijah see every time God tell us something we watching we looking yes amen hallelujah praise the Lord every time every time Jesus is telling us something we're watching him right see because the devil's going to come and he's going to try and fight it see so we're watching and Satan's coming around and he's trying to hit us with because he's not going to hit us with uh with with things that are not wrong he's going to hit us with thoughts that are valid but they're misplaced that's see see see help me Lord see because because see look when you get that Revelation see what happened when God was telling Joshua after they were fight when he was getting the soldiers picking the soldiers to fight and brought to the water and he had him drink the water Gideon he had him drink the water and he he was watching how they were drinking the water see because God's watching how he just took the Revelation he gave you because the water is water is the word right and some of them went down and drunk the water with both hands the face down see they put the sword down they put the Revelation down cuz they was fighting trying to take it they couldn't really take it they was fighting it but then there was some people that had the sword in their hand they was looking up why they drinking the water see they're looking up because the Lord says when you see these signs look up for your Redemption comes now see see because what time are what time are we in right now if what time are we in right now if brother Benham was saying we're in the shadow of coming of the Lord and brother B said the shadow reveals what that thing is see so if God tell us we're God that's the second part of his uh of of of his plan that's exactly right he got one more step left and that's to restore see see it can't it can't be far see see see so look so look that's exactly right see yes sir see so so so don't don't tell me that brother Stephen how long have we been um at this church three four years see God is redeeming his bride for Redemption redeeming his bride telling her who she is amen and what do we leave what what what uh um series were we on before we left the hotel that was king of hazus wasn't it in the feast right right so God told us that we're God and in King hazus Feast after Satan was dealt with after hmon was hung and killed after the marriage supper what was the marble flooring what was the colors on the floor of the marble flooring it was death h the grave the five uh uh the five horse riders see we're walking on Satan he's underneath us see see that's the that's the boo boo boo boo boo That's That was cuz he's down now see and he kept trying to fight that Revelation see so I got I got another quote see um yes um see it says uh it says um Ephesians 1 1-6 that's it says Accord uh this verse four I'm sorry according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that's right that we should be holding without blame for him in love that's right having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself see what is Heavenly places Heavenly places brother bam said is a believer's position in Christ that's see so we are entering Heavenly places we are getting our position in Christ see it says it says uh according to the good pleasure of his will sir to the praise of the glory to the praise of the glory of his grace for he ha made us made us accepted in the Beloved that's exactly and then brother Brenham says in God's provided way 61 he says now it's election right see I want to get on that election strong because it's the truth see now you didn't become a Christian by just a coincidence you became a Christian before you was in this world am before you were born see God ordained you to be a Christian in the Gard of Eden see and he's restoring the Garden of Eden right now see see and that's the truth God before there ever was ever you know anything see no man can no man can walk and know where he's walking no man can walk without making sure he knows where he's walking that's we know where we stand because we're walking with the scriptures believing God keeps every word the word told us we're god brother bam told us that word God Walk with it and just accept that Revelation see see because if there's a see on Sunday when the Revelation came if there was a deep within the Deep there was a pull that that that made your your heart burn within you see see brother Bram says in God's provided way and as sure as that crave is in your heart there's got to be something spring somewhere to satisfy that craving you never have that craving see see see so so because remember when brother brandham gave the uh testimony of of the boy who was eating the erasers and he was eating the erasers because there was a craving in his body because he was he was lacking it see that's what he needed see he but remember the other story when brother Bon was saying how um how uh there was two men and uh he was like be growing up in the ranks of the Pentecostal church he said there was two men um he said in the and the uh anointing the genuine anointing fell on both of them right see but one of them was a was a anyone Christian other one was a hypocrite see so look um glory to God see so because you know this Revelation because you know that you're elected of God don't look down on someone else or a sinner you have no right to no sir because because did not God say that you can't even call Christ Lord if by the holy is not by the Holy Ghost that's right see see did did he did he not say that um uh you can't even come to me unless my father draw draws you to me that's exactly so so you a even have you it wasn't even you didn't even do nothing but brother Benham told us he said that brother Benham said that you had nothing to do with it in the first place see see that's exact see see and brother Benham says in um it is I 61 he saids many times people think when a Ministry comes become Supernatural think that a person ought to wear Rob clothes touch me not you know and when a person acts like that they're trying to be something that they're not see God uses men just ordinary men it and see a person like that to me it's a stuffed shirt see somebody trying to be something they're not see see so so so you didn't save yourself so don't so don't try to make it seem like you saved yourself cuz you didn't see because see you say oh um uh uh the Lord said don't cast a PR Before Swine yeah he says that yeah yeah he said that that's scripture but you're misinterpreting you're putting it in the wrong place because because did not the scripture give us wisdom on how to deal deal deal with the people of the world he said be kind un to all men and apt to teach that's right see see see because because because he said be kind to all men be apt to teach that means that see see I live on a college campus so I know how it is you tried to you try to uh give the Holy Ghost to somebody or speak about Jesus to somebody they look at you crazy they uh they try to you or they uh they ignore you or or they try to uh uh argue with you see see but what you do is be kind on to all men after to teach you be so kind to them that that the the the the Holy Ghost that's bubbling outside of you doesn't make it hard for them to give you a glass of water see the Holy Ghost is bubbling bubbling outside of you doesn't make it hard for them to to to to to to to share share a Kit Kat with you or share some food with you see the Holy Ghost inside of you when you're at work or when you're at school the Holy Ghost inside of you that's bubbling so much it makes it bearable for them that's the only reason why they're going to work or going to school because of you see so so so so one day when when you don't come come to work and come to school they're woring where you at so so they ask you or they call you or you text you and they ask you how you doing and you say man you say you know uh uh uh I'm feeling down in my body but by his Tripes I'm Healed and by I'm Healed and my body is just catching up to my confession see so so and they're going to say man he said even even when they're sick they just they have a consolation in Christ man I want to go and talk to them I'm going to go visit them while they're sick because because I I want I want what they have see see so so don't don't be a be a stuck up person because God just told you who you are see still be humble see see because because the Way Up Is Down see because because because see but brother bam said when a man thinks he accomplished something that's when he start going to sin he said he said that's when he start messing up that's when he realize that he ain't no one to begin with see see so so don't don't um don't don't be a stuffed shirt see see see so in um see and and when it comes to uh fight not Revelation see brother bam says is and lean not on th own understanding see brother bam says when God speaks speaks a word he doesn't need any man or woman or no one else to say what it what that means see I don't need any interpretation it only needs an exception am see so just accept it see see me Lord see take your time see and when God said put this mind in you with Christ thinking not robbery to be equal with God brother bham said that there's a bogus is a real thing see and in the time we're in brother bham said to neurotic age right and if it's a neurotic age that me many people has lost their mind that's right and if many people has lost their mind that means that that means that it's a it's a perversion and in that perversion what is it telling us it's telling us that if you're able to lose your mind and have and have when you're insane you're super strong and have superpowers what does it mean if you take the mind of and put it in you if you accept that what is possible with that see see see see just follow that thought see in um in uh another quote uh yes sir brother bham said and lean not th own understanding that's it he said my sheep know my voice right he say they're not subject to any other voice that's right they won't uhhuh in other words they will not understand the theological voice that's teaching contrary to the word see the Sheep don't understand that no more than the eagle last night could understand the clucking of the head see remember that uh Parable brother brother Brenham gave us of how um he said that they was walking out and they said man I I heard him call me a vulture I heard him call me an eagle see see see because when God told you that you're God see there were some people that walked out and thought that wasn't me I'm unworthy to be be God but then there's some people that said that accept the Revelation said I am God see see see because amen see um got another quote yes my brother another quote see yes sir see and and there is a mixed multitude that still here because it has to the scriptures have to be fulfilled see if if there was a Cain there was Abel when there was a when there was a uh Jacob there was a Esau when there was a Jesus there was a Judas iscar see see and when those disciples and when Judas was with them when Jesus was showing them God in flesh I don't think Judas really caught the full revelation of God in flesh because if Judas knew that God could be in flesh he would have knew that you can't kill God so he never would have did what he did in the first place see see so if you if you are struggling to accept that God can be in flesh be careful of that Spirit be careful of because it's a demon see because there 200 million demons there's a demon that's trying to get in your mind and that's trying to make you doubt make you doubt it's trying to make you uh what what did Brother Bron say crucify God AR fresh again see see because because see brother BR says in Israel in the church 53 he says and watch it's moving right out today in a terrible Force oh it behooves you my brother my sister consider what you're listening at don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you underestimate him he's smooth as he can be see the Antichrist Spirit isn't communism see the Antichrist spirit is so close to the real thing if it was possible he is a religious spirit able brother The Crow and the dove sat Dove sat in the same Roost Esau and Jacob were brothers Judas and Jesus were of the same church right okay and then and then there's um another quote um another quote it says uh that spirit in their earnestly contending for the faith and 54 yes uh brother Bram says he says th Spirit of Cain in the Garden of Eden right he says here's the spirit of Abel from the Garden of Eden coming on coming right on see both of them going up to the stop now it's it's reaching its head that's right see look at them they're ready to bloom out now the church and the world together the former church and the spiritual church he said let them grow together see cuz rain falls on the just and the unjust so when God brings a revelation down it falls on the just and the unjust so God brought that Revelation that you were God down and fell on everybody see see so it says let them grow together notice and pers Nations and so forth see as jambre and janz with stood Moses so did so do these resist the truth men of rep probate Minds concerning the truth see Justus as popularity they won't go into it because they're afraid to tackle it see see EXA they're they're afraid to identify themselves with Christ see see they're afraid to accept that Revelation that's right see see um now another I got another quote in um follow the spirit my brother and um Amen brother bam said is the church number one yes sir 53 uhhuh he says now I want you to quiet and you down for just a minute uhhuh and Judas was with them that's right Judas was as big as a big a duck was in the puddle he was shouting and rejoicing too and he followed the church right down on until it came to Pentecost see what is Pentecost see Pentecost is God coming down himself yes sir see Pentecost when Israel was going to the promised land right that was see when Pentecost came to receive the Holy Ghost to receive the Holy Spirit to receive that Revelation see a lot of them couldn't accept it a lot of them weren't able to take it see see they they can get all the way down to sanctification but when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother said that's when they show their colors that's right but when it comes to see this is continuing but when it comes to Pentecost to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he refus it and betay and betrayed Jesus and that was the Antichrist and that Spirit today will come right on down and teach justification by faith and everything and move on right down and it show us colors that's right see see now amen amen amen see it says um another quote some it says uh take your time it says in John 29 uhhuh see because uhhuh when God gave the Revelation yes see there are some doubting Thomases that's it see that's it there's some people that they're stuck in the calistic see they can't get past that barrier see and and and verse 29 it says Jesus said unto him Thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed right blessed are all they that have not seen and yet have believed see I didn't physically see before the foundation of the world I didn't physically remember seeing even though I did because brother bham say just spiritual Amnesia so I still saw it I'm just it's still hard for me to remember it see see but but bypass my theophany see and and even though I didn't see it I still believe it see and blessed is he blessed is he that amen say blessed are they that have not seen and have yet believed see so because I believe and I'm even more blessed than that see and and and also because you were given this Revelation more stripes to him that knoweth so be careful that because you you you know this Revelation now be careful of how you handle it because if you mess up see because especially for the young people too because our parents see they they um went through you know the domination years in teaching but we have the Divine word of God see and more stripes are to us that know because if you mess up and if you reject this Revelation and if he reject like Esau with the pot of meal going for things of the world for things for things for things that that will that will that will pass away for things that are not permanent see if we give up that you give up your birth right see I know how much my stamp cost I know how much my birth right call see I know how much that that uh that um uh that promise C see because it was the blood of God and that in in the blood is a life that life is in the blood see see so Jesus came down himself because if it's left up to man man can't save himself see because every time God was left men was left to their own devices they failed see and the in the um uh before the into the Delian flood they couldn't do it they fell right before the uh uh s gomor they couldn't do it they fa even now it's happening again they fa see but there every age there was an elected seed there was an elected people of that if it were possible people there was an elected seed that did not fall for for for they did not reject that Revelation because because if if all the scriptures are showing us that it's just Christ and you if just like right now like the five garments God is showing us that is Christ in us because you can see the five garments in your life see if you're seeing it that means that God is telling you that that if Joseph was a type of Christ does that not mean that he's shown you that it's Christ in you it's Christ in me see that's what he's telling us see he he he he's teaching it to us in a way to where we will understand it because he hid it from the eyes and the wi of prudent and gave to babies such that would learn that's right see see so so um come me Lord see see um see because in uh Christ's mystery God revealed in 63 brother Bram says and the other night you didn't get the tape that I preached here one night on a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul a prisoner see when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing what the spirit says do got and then verse 84 this is how I knew that the lord gave me this message because I had this quote and then brother stepen came up and had po this exact quote up it says 84 says he said then take this Rod to take this thy rod God speaking that's God's word right go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and the flies came into creation see cuz that was the third pool see and if you want to utilize the third pool if you want to utilize it if you want to accept you got to accept the Revelation that's your God if you want to utilize that third pool and the only way you can fully utilize is because if you accept the mind of God that's in Christ see a man that a man that has a god of Christ has is die completely to his flesh he has no fault of his own he he has no desire of his own see so when you're that means you're a complete prisoner because everything God says do that's what you do that's right see so so see and the FES came into creation because he was a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing see nobody else could turn away he was complete prisoner in
