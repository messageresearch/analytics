God every mind oh Father we thank you for every testimony that went forth oh God and and even the testimonies oh God that didn't get mentioned oh Father Lord God we thank you for all things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you know I was talking talking to a Believer today one of my brothers and um and we was talking about how the how the um the church was at at a dead end Street say it was amazing that the church was on this street and it was a dead end you know and um I I told I told I look I told him I said well it's it's a it's a dead end Street for an end time message so and um and then then then the law revealed to me and say well really it's not a dead end you know it depend on how you look at it you know it's a dead end if you out there in the street looking but really when you get out inside the church the direction change and go up so so so really it's not a dead end so so you got to get in on the inside to get the rest the instructions and the rest of the instructions will tell you how to go up amen cuz there's Rapture and Faith inside this building if you don't mind turn to the Book of Matthew and and I felt led to go back in this subject and yes sir may the Lord help me with this and Hallelujah think we touched a little bit B of it on New Year's night and and um God has laid it on my heart to deal with it yes sir you know we we'll see where he goes am you got your Bibles turned to the Book of Matthew um chapter 22 verse4 if you got it say Amen am the scripture reads it says for many are called but few are chosen and you may be seated amen we're going to deal with this so my my my subject tonight will be the chosen ones in the contract and sufferings and um we'll see how far we can get with it yes sir um and brother Brenham constantly talk about the chosen ones and and and and he said those those ones though it was the church it made up the church and you know that those was the Believers those that God has chosen those has received that gift of the Holy Ghost and and they have the token yes sir what they need to to produce Rapture in faith so I'm going to start out with this uh this quote question and answer yes sir from 1959 paragraph 122 glory to God he said now you that's been called like that see I want to speak to you you the chosen ones that God chose us in him before the foundation of the world that's right think of that God chose us in him yes sir before the foundation of the world am God knew before the foundation of the world that I speak this same subject tonight amen he's infinite that's right and before there was a world uhhuh oh Sho here get get the Holy Ghost now the word will bring it see that's how it come that's right while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them see then paragraph 123 goes on and says before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew am that you that you will be wanting it amen [Applause] so so so this so This choosing comes with a desire it comes with an expectation and and and you will begin to pull for things that belongs to you before you even receive it and God said he already knew before you got here that you was going to want the Holy Ghost so he already prepared a way for you to receive it [Music] he said because he knew that You' be want it and he chose you himself because you desired it he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth and He sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself that's right and he said hm hm oh that just I know I made this is the church so I'm at home now you see oh that is so rich to me to think it's not not one thing that you have not one thing to do with it but before the world ever started God sought us and put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life before there even was a world talk about God hallelujah now in the message to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal in 1950 paragraph 31 he says he says the brass serpent couldn't pray for no one could it then he says the pool of Bethesda the Angels didn't pray for no one it was a troubled water is that right they just looked and lived with the brass serent and in the days of the Apostles they laid in the shadow of Peter and was healed that's right and he says now if you don't believe that this is Bible times again just a repeat in this last days God's calling out a people of the Gentiles he's calling on the Jews and a gentile Church the same thing a contract so so this is what I want to deal with right now the contract yes in the message Jehovah Gyra yes sir 1957 paragraph 34 brother BR says now like in in America uhuh if I say say we'll make a covenant uhhuh or promise one another we'll go over and have us a little sandwich and made some kind of a deal he said I take hold of a man's hand and say shake brother that's right that's a covenant in the United States he said that's an agreement when we shook hands on it right and then he goes on and shows different you know different um examples he say in Japan a covenant when they make a covenant they stand and get a little box of salt that's right and he said they'll throw salt on each other that's right he said that's a covenant in Japan right and he goes on and say but in the orient back in Abraham's time he said you know what they doing to make a covenant yes sir he said they took an animal and slew the animal that's right he said they cut it apart that's right and he said and they stood between the two pieces of the flesh that's right and he said they wrote on a piece of paper y'all bear with me we going somewhere he said I agreed to do this in such and such a thing he said then they tore the paper apart he said one man kept one part that's it and the other kept the other part that's right he said they took an oath over that dead animal's body right he said that if they broke this Covenant let their bodies be like this dead animal he say and when they come together they have to have the right piece of paper cuz it have to dovetail perfectly with the other piece of paper right yes my brother Hallelujah then he says now how God was showing Abraham he said if we had time to go into it he said but here's what it was listen he said God was showing that through the Seed of Abraham yes sir would bring Christ his own son through Isaac to Christ and that on Calvary God took his own son yes sir and tore him apart that's right so he lifted up the body and set it on his right hand and sent the other part the Holy Spirit down on the church he saying when the Rapture comes it have to be that same spirit that was on Christ will have to dtail with that promise or it would be [Applause] [Music] rejected we going to make it live tonight praise God and I want to show you this is a piece of paper yes and I done ripped it in half now this top portion has the word body on it and the bottom part has the spirit so what what God is saying at Calvary on the cross cross body was ripped it was real but AB is saying that God took the body portion of that contract and it say he SED on the throne that's right and I'm I'm going to sit this right here and he say he took the spirit part that's right and he sent it down to the church I'm going to give this to brother Benjamin you going to you going to represent all the [Applause] Believers so so what he saying yes sir in order for this contract to be valid that's that same piece of paper got to go back with that one you cannot duplicate that piece of paper right there no matter how much you try you cannot duplicate it so it would take that same identical piece of paper to fit back in this right here so so brother Tony what are you saying tonight what I'm saying if you possess the holy ghost that Spirit if God have given you that gift there's no way there's no way you can be lost [Music] toight there's no way you could be lost tonight God is under obligation to make sure you make it there because he's not complete without [Applause] [Music] you that Spirit got to go back to the body and if you possess that Spirit you going back to the body you come from God and you going back to [Music] God this is this is the gift to every believer God God is letting you know that I have given you a portion of the contract so whatever you need in the contract it's it's yours that's right it's yours that's right they without us cannot be made perfect that's right so they're waiting on us to reach profession it's going to take that spirit and I and I want you to remember that that spirit that you possess because that spirit is going to guide you it's going to protect you it going to lead you you in Troublesome times it's going to deliver [Applause] [Music] you he says now how God was SE Abraham paragraph 35 in Jehovah JY Jehovah JY 1957 paragraph 35 he said now God was showing Abraham if we had time to go into it but here what it was God was showing that through the Seed of Abraham would bring Christ his own son through Isaac to Christ and that on Calvary God took his own son tore him apart he lifted up that body and set it on his right hand and sent the other part the Holy Spirit down to the church and when the Rapture comes it has to be that same spirit that was on Christ we have to doveet tail with that promise or it will be rejected no wonder he said except the man be born again he will no wise enter into the kingdom that's right it has to be that same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost has to baptize every believer or it won't be the same Spirit that's right and contract that was tore at Calvary that's right think of that oh that ought to make the Pentecost shout anyhow said think of it the unconditional Covenant God said it has to be and he tore it apart soul and body of his own son he took the body and sent the spirit to the church and that Spirit can come in the church today and perform the same Miracles showing and people will laugh at it and walk away from it he said how do you ever expect to make the Rapture or go in to see God he said there we are maybe you never seen that before like that and he goes on and say now you see why it's necessary you got to be born of the spirit the spirit of Christ has to be in you cuz it has to be that same Spirit take your body to be joined with that body the The Same Spirit that was tore off of Christ tore out of Christ or Jesus and if that spirit is in you it'll make you do the things that Christ did so if you possess that Spirit you ought to be walking like Christ you ought to be talking like Christ everything you should do should be lining up like Christ it'll make you live like the life that Christ Liv and Christ was about the father's business all times no Gathering about at shows and entertainment was about the father's business now you see why it was hard to have a healing service brother Bon said you got to get a foundation first you got to get the People based on thust say the Lord and there's that unconditional [Music] Covenant Hallelujah so what you saying brother Tony I'm saying this thing is already fixed this what I'm trying to tell you it's already fixed and and and and and the devil has beaten us down with with with sufferings and T trials and tribulation and Texas but the victory has already been won you you got a piece of the contract that's all you need you got to go back go that's why God said he would not lose one how he going to lose you you you belong to the [Applause] [Music] contract and and you and you and you wonder why tonight why you can't give up you wondering why you can't give up it's not in you to give up that's not a part of the [Applause] contract Jesus Jesus was our perfect example when he went to Gethsemane he prayed three times sir he TR he tried to pass that cup he tried to pass that coup of suffering the flesh didn't want to go through that suffering but he said but not my will but let thy will be done see even Christ even Jesus Christ wanted to give up but it wasn't in him he couldn't have given up if he wanted to and the same thing to you tonight you can't give up if you wanted to it's in you to keep charging it say you to keep pressing on [Applause] let's turn to Second Corinthians chapter 4 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse starting with verse eight you got it say amen amen amen the scripture read say we are troubled ah on every side yet not disgrace and we are perplexed but not in dispair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed and and and and that's why Paul was Paul was convinced there was nothing that could separate him for the love of Christ cuz he recognized his position he he he knew his position he knew he possessed that spirit so he he knew there was nothing that could separate him from God because he was tied to [Music] [Applause] [Music] God now we want to deal with suffering for a little while and and and this is one of the this is one of the major subjects in that Christians battle with is the suffering just is the suffer nobody wants to go through sufferings amen no nobody wants to go through suffering I'm I'm going throw my hand up for one I this flesh do not want to go through any suffering but by the help of the lord we I hope you'll be free tonight from suffering that you will look at it in a different [Applause] way glory to God turn to the book of Acts chapter n verse one wonderful than you Lord suffering is not so bad once you once you get get on the inside of and get a revelation of why you have sufferings and and and and where it come from where it come from who's the author of there you go [Music] help us Lord all right chapter 9 verse one it says and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went un the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women uhhuh he might bring them bound into Jerusalem we still talking about the chosen ones and as he journeyed he came near to Damascus and suddenly there shine around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and Heard a Voice s to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who are thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest and it is hard for the to kick against the Pricks first of all Saul wasn't looking for Jesus let's let's get that let's get that clear right now he he wasn't even looking for Jesus the man was on a mission to to persecute the Christians Jesus wasn't on his mind I promise Jesus was on his mind you can't think about Jesus and go persecute the Christian so he so he want Jesus was on his mind [Music] and the Bible says verse 6 say and he trembling and astonished say Lord what would thou have me to do see right there was the act of surrenders right there is what what Saul surrendered at and but but B say God cannot he cannot reveal his full word to you until you give a total surrender see right there is where he surrendered at yes sir and the Lord said to him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do yes sir and the man which Journey with him stood speechless hearing it voice but seeing no man in verse eight say and Saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus yes sir and he was there three days without sight and neither did he eat nor drink now now now we know this story now he he's automatically fasting autom automatically fasting now now he went for being a A persecuted and a murderer now he already showing signs of a Believer already showing signs of a Believer and we we we know this story and he automatic begin to fast that's right verse 10 is say there was a certain disciple of Damascus name ananas and to him said the Lord in the vision Vision ananas and he said behold I am he Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of tus torsus for behold he praying yes sir he automatically automattic gains a prayer life automatically I want you I want to you keep that automatically in your mind he automatically gains a prayer life and have seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in yes sir and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananas answer Lord I I have heard by many of this man how much evil he have done to thy Saints at Jerusalem so so what ananas is saying Lord if it was me I I wouldn't choose this man that's what that's what he's saying Lord Lord you sure you want this one I would I wouldn't choose this man but but remember what I said God does the choosing [Applause] it's God that does the choosing cuz we would have been cast out a long time ago if it were based off our works but I'm so glad that God does the [Applause] [Music] choosing in verse 14 he says and here he have authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chos in vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show this the verse I want you to get for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake so Saul conversion automatically came with a suffering his conversion automatically came with a suffering and this suffering he didn't ask for he didn't put a petition in for it but it was automatically given to him just for being [Applause] converted for he say I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake that's right in the book of Philippians chapter U verse chapter 1 verse 29 Hallelujah Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 you got it say amen for it reads for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ yes sir not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you saw in me and now bear and now here to be in me yes so there's two there's two different ways you can suffer that's it you you you can you can do something wrong and and reap the percussions of it and you can suffer for that but there also is another suffering that Christ is speaking about and you don't have to do anything to receive this one you you don't have to do nothing wrong it's automatically given to you Hallelujah amen and and this this is the one that Christians struggle with because we we we walk a good walk and and and and we do everything that we can do but then we found out we always find our back up against the wall we didn't do anything but God said you going to receive a [Applause] suffering thank you but first Peter the book of Peter 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 19 you see what God think about this suffer we're going to look at it in a whole new light after tonight hallelujah hallelujah 1 Peter chap 2 verse 19 and he says yes sir for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully Lord verse 20 say for what glory is it if when you be buffered for your faults you shall take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is a self with God we going to pause right there so God God is weing the two the two different the two different sufferings he God is saying that if if if you as a Christian go do something wrong and you and you have you have become one within yourself that you know you doing wrong and and you receive a suffering for it and you you take it well because you you say well Lord I deserve this I've done this and I deserve this but God say it's more pleasing to him when you doing nothing wrong and you suffer and you take it the same way this this is what he's saying it's it's more acceptable to him when you are innocent and doing nothing [Music] wrong in verse 21 says for even heing to where you you called because Christ also suffered for us yes sir leaving us an example that you should follow his steps that's right who did not sin neither was God found in his mouth yes sir who when he was revealed reveal revealed not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously yes my brother who his own self bear our sins in his own body and on the tree that we being dead to sin to live unto righteousness by whose scr you were healed for you was that sheep going astray but are not return into the shepherd and Bishops of your soul yes sir so God is saying you you entitled to this suffering right just for just for following Christ that's but he also is saying that I have given you that spirit so so don't faint don't get weary when you when these things come to you and and it's even one part when he say don't even consider these things strange when they make it to you so you you should already know He already told you to expect these things so don't conf consider these things CR when they make it to you he said but I but don't look at the circumstances remember the spirit that I have given to you knowing that you can't be lost I'll never leave you or forsake you when you get weak there's power in the spirit when you don't know where to go there's Direction in the spirit so he telling you I already fixed it so that you can [Applause] win you you ever look you ever look at a movie you have a movie and and they have the cast of the movie and it's it's like you have your main characters and then you have your Supporting Cast but everybody know that the main character is going to make it to the end I I I don't care what I don't care what movie it is you already know they going to live and they they can't die because they the main character so that's what that's all I'm telling you tonight that you're the main character it it don't matter what you go through you got to make it because you the main [Applause] character and why and when we looking at and while we watching the movie we'll see the main character go through so much some some they go through so much trauma sometime they laid up in the hospital and they create this scene like oh they on the death bed and they so close to death but in the back of my mind I say somehow he going to get out the bed cuz he the main character I already know how this going to end I don't know how he going to get out but I know he got to get out because if he die then the cast is [Applause] [Music] over apply that in your life tonight you are the main characters tonight it don't matter what you going through how low you get sometimes God got to come pick you up because he saw you over there you got to make it [Applause] he paid way Paul say death where is thy thing St great where is thy Victory even the ones that went by the grave you still got something to get you out of there you got to go [Music] back you're the main character tonight that's what I want you to remember whatever make it to you sufferings tests trials disappointments remember tell myself I'm the I am the main character I can't die I can't be lost and the main character always makes it to the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] end so why sit there and let the devil buffer you but say you got to know who you are tonight you got to know your position in the word and you got to catch this Revelation if you don't catch this Revelation the devil going to pull you from side to side just look him in the face and say I'm the main character look him in say I'm the main character what you going to do I'm going to make it yes sir there's nothing you can do to separate me from [Applause] God hallelujah in the book of First Peter chapter 3 let's go on verse 12 it say for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous yes sir and his ears are open unto their prayers sir but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil and who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good who who is he but if you suffer for righteousness sake have p r ye so pet Peter saying at some point at some point in the midst of this suffering you got to find happiness I don't care how you get it you got to you got to find some happiness at some point you got to find some happiness he say happy are ye and be not afraid of their Terror neither by trouble and and the only way you can find that happiness is you got to know why this suffering come you got know where it come from that's right you got to know the reason behind it that's right God God said I'm going I'm going to give you a portion of this uhhuh I mean you're you're actually playing a role in The Script God already know you going to make it so all God is doing he's telling you say look here brother that's right that's right I'm going send some suffering your way I just I just need for you to take it but I already worked out way for you to overcome but I just need you to play that role I I just need you to do that play that role and and and and who else who is a better candidate for God to S serer to but a Believer who who else would he choose then to send it to a Believer why because he know a Believer can't give up you know a Believer won't quit you know that that's why he sent him to job I mean God s God sit by watching The Script go try job I know what job got I gave it to him go try it he's not going to deny me and God and God I know that about you tonight it's not SCS that these things make it to you God got confidence in you he believe in you but you got to understand that the reason why he sent it to you he sent it to you because he belied in [Applause] [Music] you to God brother in verse 15 say but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask of you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear amen having a good conscience that where as they speak evil of you that's it as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse you falsely accuse you of good conversation in Christ that's right in verse 17 say for it is better if the will of God be so yeah that you suffer for well doing then for evil doing so it's the will of God it's the will of God it's the will of God God turn to Malachi chapter 3 yes sir and and and this is a familiar story and we we we know this Mal 3: 13 and this and this is the conversation with the Believers you know when they went to complaining and and God had a problem with that yes sir he said your words have been Stout against me say the Lord yet you say what have we spoken so much against thee uhhuh he said you have said it is in vain to serve God and what prophet is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy y they that work wickedness are set up yay they that temp God or even delivered and and and and they was complaining they bought the petition they was they was saying that the wicked do wicked and and they and they don't get this suffering right they get by and and and and but God had a problem with that because they didn't catch the Revelation that this suffering was was given to them they they didn't know why they was going through that right and and God God talking to them like you're talking like you don't understand why you getting what you get you act like you don't know so that that's exactly what he's saying why you complaining about something that supposed to be for you uhh in the message perfect Faith yes sir 1963 yes sir paragraph 94 but Bown say now watch and he said to us if you abide in me and my word and you St John here you can ask what you will it'll be done he said then recognize your position in the scripture as a Believer he see he say see you got to recognize your position as he recognized his position that's right it's not as written that Christ shall come and what all Christ would do he said that Copus and them that morning isn't it written in the scriptures that they'll have to that he must suffer and then been killed and then be killed and raised the third day right said why are you so slow of understanding that's right and and that's what Jesus as he say it's written in the scriptures that that that I must suffer he say and you and you acting like you're not getting it so so so God and that's what God was saying in Malachi why are you complaining about this suffering that made it to you if you look in the scripture you will see that you entitled you entitled to a certain type of suffering just for being converted just for following me you entitled to a certain suffering [Music] hallu in second Corinthians chapter 4:17 the Bible even said for I light afflictions which is but for a moment working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory am praise God Amen so let go to the Book of Mark and I'm trying to time you go to the Book of Mark chapter 10 verse 35 me show you that a Believer a Believer will pull for things Hall they they they will pull for things before even time for them to get it they'll pull for days and and and and I and it it's good when you pull for good things and promises but let's see let's see what he was asking for that's exactly right and and in the book of Isaiah 53 you know 7 he say he was oppressed and was afflicted yet he open not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his sheers is D so he open not his mouth right now we on the Book of Mark yes sir chap 10:35 it says and James and John the sons of zebede come into come into him saying Master we would that thou should have do for us whatsoever we shall desire and he said to them what were you that I should do for you and they said unto him Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on the left hand in thy Glory but Jesus said unto them you know not what you ask for he said you know not what you ask for he said can you drink of the cup that I drink of so he basically asking can can can you take this type of suffering that I'm going through do you know what you asking for and and they were perfect examples of sheep led to the slaughter cuz when you leave a sheep to the slaughter he's totally D to what getting ready to go happen he go through the slaughter instantly and these brothers were asking for suffering and didn't even know they was asking for but but but NE but nethertheless the suffing was for them but they didn't know it but they was asking for it ahead of [Music] time Jesus say Jesus said can you drink of the cup that I drink and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with and they said to him we can and Jesus said to to them you shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized so Jesus went out and prophesy for that what you think you want you going to get it and and and that that's the pull of a Believer they were pulling for something and and they didn't even have it wasn't even time for them to suffer [Music] yet why because they didn't have the Holy Spirit on the inside yet it it wasn't time for them to suffer and and the same thing happened with Peter Peter God Christ told him to say Peter before the C cow through twice Thrice you going to deny me three times and and and God knew Peter was asking for a suffering that he wasn't ready to to to go through Jesus said Peter I hear you but but when this suffering come you going to deny me three times you going to deny me three times but he was a Believer and he was asking for it was a pull on the inside we always pull for things that belong to us but but look in the scriptures you don't see nowhere what Peter deny Crist after Pentecost once he got that that Spirit on the inside you don't see nowhere where he Deni Christ now he's ready for that suffering yes that's why Jesus told him you going to deny me three times because you don't have that Spirit you're not equipped to deal with this yet you only making it because I'm here he said the devil desire to sniff you as weak but I pray for you so just for Peter having that desire the devil desired the sniff him as we that desire got the devil [Music] [Applause] attention hallu J oh [Music] Jesus you and like I said when God God choses his vessels and and he he chose he chose Believers right he sent he sent so much suffering to his Believers and and Jo Jo was a good example he was a perfect man God say he was perfect but he was also the perfect candidate for God he was the perfect candidate for God to describ sufferings to show the devil knowing that through these sufferings he won't deny me you won't separate him from me cuz if you think about it when the sons of God went in the presence of God Satan was there too every time the sons of God went Satan went and he asked Satan he said he said why Why th here he said I'm coming to and fro looking for someone I can devour so so when he when he say have you considered my servant Joel and and he said I will but you got a hedge around it so it's God the one that puts the Hedge up and is God is the one that drops the [Music] [Applause] Hedge and and that's what that's what I mean you need to know where it comes from cuz God is contr roll in the Hedge and and and Satan made it clear while the Hedge was up he could not get the Joel he could not touch him and God intentionally dropped the head he intentionally dropped the head and he sent him to him but the good part about it he s a governor he told him how far to go that's it he told him what he could do and he told him what he couldn't [Applause] do you know he went to Joel twice even the first time when he reached his limit he went back and he came back again and God asked him have you considered him again God sent him back to Joel he dropped the Hedge again so I'm thinking like when the devil goes into the presence of God I'm I'm trying to get his thinking so when God drops the Hedge in the devil's Mind through sufferings and persecutions trials and testing the devil thinking I can use this to separate them from God that that's his thinking but God on the other hand say look I'm going to allow you to do this but I'm going to tell you how far to go but through this suffering through this suffering see God God is getting something totally different out of it he get something totally through this suffering they going to be strengthen they going to come to perfect [Applause] [Music] so if the de if the devil really knew what his suffering was going to bring he probably would have walked away if he if he knew why putting Christ on the cross was going to do he probably would have left him alone so this this is what I want you to see in suffering I want you to look at it in a whole different way don't worry about it when it make it to you just worry about what you possess [Music] [Applause] n number one we already know who s it and we already know why he s it so while it's there you rejoice you be happy you be glad because you a candidate use the perfect example that you suffering with Christ and Paul say you ought to be happy for those things because God chose you he chose you from the foundation of the world he put in your contract for you to for you to do this certain role it's for you so you need to know what position that you got to play and on once you know your position you begin to look at things in a different [Music] Manner and like I said nobody wants to suffer nobody wants to suffer but Christ say is it's good for his sake it's good for his sake so so change that mentality and know that you possess the other part of the contract you got the other part of the contract and and and what you got is the only thing that can fit with the part he sent the glory so that mean nobody can't take your place nobody can't take your [Applause] place and I say L I said Lord why do you want me to deal with sufferings so so when I thought about it I said well well that is a problem you know cuz sometimes we don't know why and and God is saying that through your conversion yes sir you are automatically entitled sir to a certain type of suffering and and and you don't have to ask for it you don't have to sign no paper for it it's automatically given to you he he said but no when it make it to you yes sir know who you are know who you are and and the reason that it came and that and and that when you can find joy peace and happiness and you can find that cuz you got to get to a point where you can see God you got to see God there was a man that spit in David David said leave him alone God had it done you got to see God in the midst of it and God and God is love God is Joy God is peace God is happiness and if you can ever find God in the midst then you can develop those you can Dev those offsprings you can come on musicians [Music] than so what are we looking for we looking for God in the midst of the storm if you can if you can ever see God in the midst then you you will forget about the surrounders and and before you know it you be done praise your way out of [Applause] it let us bow our heads Lord God we thank you for your word
