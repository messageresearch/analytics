[17:59] [Music]
[18:00] [Applause]

[57:58] genesis chapter 1 verse 28
[58:01] oh brother robert is happy so i'm happy
[58:04] i'm covered you heard buddy john covered
[58:07] in other words make sure
[58:09] you groom well
[58:12] it's christian
[58:14] it's a holy spirit
[58:17] it is holy
[58:19] holy
[58:20] it is not a dirty spirit
[58:22] it's a holy spirit when they see you you
[58:25] smell holy
[58:28] you look holy
[58:30] amen
[58:32] amen until somebody looking at you like
[58:34] which world are you coming out of
[58:38] until they see that glow
[58:41] of a young man of a gentleman when
[58:44] somebody look at you they change their
[58:45] language they say sir how are you doing
[58:52] [Music]
[58:55] until they ask you where do you go to
[58:57] church
[59:00] then you bring him here
[59:02] and the word
[59:03] take hold of him
[59:05] 28th and god bless them
[59:08] bless who adam and eve
[59:11] the male and the female together
[59:13] everybody
[59:15] and god bless them
[59:17] and god say to them
[59:19] both of them were called adam
[59:21] you might be seated
[59:25] what did god say
[59:27] are you ready
[59:29] and god blessed them
[59:33] and god say to them be
[59:35] fruitful
[59:37] and
[59:40] the man here that god is talking to is
[59:43] not a physical man
[59:46] right
[59:47] god is talking to a spirit
[59:50] and this spirit is dual
[59:53] it is both male and
[59:56] everybody
[59:57] so when god talks to the spirit
[1:00:01] god told the spirit to be fruitful
[1:00:05] yes brother caleb thank you
[1:00:07] and to multiply
[1:00:09] and replenish the earth
[1:00:12] how is a spirit going to multiply
[1:00:16] how is the spirit going to be fruitful
[1:00:20] how is a spirit
[1:00:22] going to replenish the earth
[1:00:24] because god himself was a spirit
[1:00:26] but how did god multiply
[1:00:29] because he did
[1:00:31] somebody answered it
[1:00:33] everybody clear
[1:00:34] anybody clear
[1:00:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:40] okay
[1:00:41] okay
[1:00:42] and subdue it
[1:00:44] and have dominion everybody clear
[1:00:48] that opinion speak about the authority
[1:00:51] everybody
[1:00:53] have dominion over what over there
[1:00:57] who is my man preaching
[1:01:00] okay
[1:01:05] have dominion or authority
[1:01:09] upon water
[1:01:12] the fish of the sea
[1:01:16] everybody clear
[1:01:17] if not the cold one will take the
[1:01:20] headache off
[1:01:22] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:01:25] and over the
[1:01:28] the fall of the air
[1:01:31] fall of the air
[1:01:36] and over water
[1:01:37] every living and over
[1:01:40] every living thing that move upon thee
[1:01:43] earth upon the earth
[1:01:45] living things upon the earth
[1:01:48] so man before the fall was given the
[1:01:53] jurisdiction or the dominion
[1:01:56] or the authority
[1:01:58] upon the fishes
[1:02:00] upon the fire and upon the beast of the
[1:02:03] earth that was amen word man was
[1:02:07] supposed to dominate
[1:02:09] amen everybody clear so far
[1:02:11] let's go to james chapter 3.
[1:02:18] can everybody hear me okay
[1:02:20] amen okay
[1:02:27] if it's a problem brother
[1:02:30] caleb
[1:02:30] if it's a problem go ahead and mute him
[1:02:33] i will try to read everything
[1:02:35] okay
[1:02:36] go ahead and mute him you can come back
[1:02:38] to the front and i'll try to
[1:02:40] do it
[1:02:46] to the best of
[1:02:48] my ability
[1:02:50] so somebody doesn't say you say it
[1:02:55] because i got seeds of abraham
[1:02:59] they like my sister-in-law laughing
[1:03:00] there they want to hold to the world
[1:03:04] you say that you promise
[1:03:07] that's a seed of abraham
[1:03:11] james chapter 3 verse 5. are you there
[1:03:14] everybody there okay so let's quieten
[1:03:16] our spirit now and get focused
[1:03:20] even so the tongue
[1:03:22] is a little member
[1:03:24] and boasts water
[1:03:27] behold how great a matter a little fire
[1:03:31] kingdom
[1:03:32] very little but it can cause a lot of
[1:03:34] headache and damage
[1:03:36] and the tongue is a fire
[1:03:39] a world of iniquity a whole cosmos of
[1:03:44] iniquity of politics and things
[1:03:47] everybody clear
[1:03:48] so is the tongue among our members
[1:03:52] that it defiles the whole body we
[1:03:54] already under have an understanding of
[1:03:56] this
[1:03:57] and sets on fire the course of nature
[1:04:02] so the course of life
[1:04:05] is just a result of what
[1:04:09] of what you
[1:04:13] am i reading a different bible
[1:04:16] the course of nature the way things move
[1:04:19] in your life
[1:04:20] is just a result of what
[1:04:26] which tongue
[1:04:28] okay praise god
[1:04:31] it sets on fire the course of nature
[1:04:34] and it is set on fire of what
[1:04:37] of hell that's why the rich young ruler
[1:04:40] in hell was worrying about his tongue
[1:04:43] that's where it started from
[1:04:45] verse seven
[1:04:46] for every kind of water
[1:04:49] watch my board every kind of water
[1:04:53] anybody clear
[1:04:55] everybody clear on the board
[1:04:57] every kind of beast
[1:04:59] check
[1:05:00] come on and off water
[1:05:03] everybody here
[1:05:04] can you see that on the board
[1:05:06] bird check
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:09] every kind of beast come out and of bird
[1:05:13] kama and of water
[1:05:15] serpent everything that is moving upon
[1:05:18] the earth anybody care
[1:05:21] so beast right here
[1:05:23] serpent right here
[1:05:25] anybody care
[1:05:27] every kind of beast every kind of bird
[1:05:29] which is the fowl of the air
[1:05:32] every kind of beast come out and of
[1:05:34] birds come out and of serpent come on
[1:05:37] and of things in the
[1:05:40] sea
[1:05:40] things in the sea the fishes of the sea
[1:05:43] everybody clear
[1:05:44] check
[1:05:45] so james is
[1:05:47] bringing everything that was in hidden
[1:05:50] back here
[1:05:52] did that make sense in eden the power of
[1:05:55] the spoken word by the spirit man was
[1:05:58] dominating brother branham say adam and
[1:06:01] the spirit led the animal like the holy
[1:06:04] spirit leads the church
[1:06:07] so adam when before he was a man when he
[1:06:10] was a spirit he was just moving along
[1:06:12] and say elephant you go this way and the
[1:06:14] elephant keep moving with the spirit
[1:06:16] everybody clear
[1:06:18] we clear now now james is talking about
[1:06:21] the tongue
[1:06:23] and when he's talking about the tongue
[1:06:25] james begin to remind us
[1:06:28] of the dominion the domain
[1:06:31] that was handed to man
[1:06:33] in the garden of eden
[1:06:37] in connection with them
[1:06:44] did it make sense
[1:06:45] that's why when brother branham faced
[1:06:47] the ball
[1:06:50] all that brother branham have to do was
[1:06:53] to talk to the ball
[1:06:56] everybody
[1:06:58] not to push the ball not to use the gun
[1:07:01] on the ball not to scare the ball but to
[1:07:04] use the
[1:07:06] and speak to the ball
[1:07:07] and the ball understood the human
[1:07:10] language and turned around and went
[1:07:13] and sat down and just watched the
[1:07:14] prophet keep moving
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] for every kind of beast and of birds and
[1:07:25] of serpent and of the things in the sea
[1:07:28] is what
[1:07:31] present tense
[1:07:33] is tame
[1:07:34] present tense
[1:07:37] present tense
[1:07:39] meaning we are already in scene
[1:07:45] his team now
[1:07:46] you go to the zoo
[1:07:48] you will find serpent in the cage
[1:07:51] you will find bird in a cage you're
[1:07:53] going to find animal in the cage you're
[1:07:55] going to find all kind of beasts
[1:07:58] caged up in the zoo it's telling you man
[1:08:01] is taming he's controlling he's
[1:08:04] dominating on all of them even though
[1:08:08] he's living under sin but he still have
[1:08:11] the ability to dominate
[1:08:18] did it make sense
[1:08:19] a sinful man
[1:08:21] has the ability to dominate
[1:08:24] but the way he's dominating this kingdom
[1:08:28] he's not dominating them by the tongue
[1:08:32] right everybody
[1:08:34] they don't catch the lion by the tongue
[1:08:38] make sense they have to put traps
[1:08:41] to get the the
[1:08:42] lion in the trap then they pick the lion
[1:08:45] and get him to the zoo while the lion is
[1:08:47] refusing
[1:08:48] anybody here
[1:08:50] ever here that's the way man is
[1:08:52] dominating
[1:08:54] but when noah wanted to bring the lion
[1:08:57] in the ark
[1:09:01] are you awake
[1:09:02] no i never use a trap
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:10] no i was a perfect man
[1:09:16] no i just preached the gospel
[1:09:19] and when he preached the gospel the lion
[1:09:22] heard noah
[1:09:24] and the lion said mama
[1:09:27] noah is preaching over there he said
[1:09:29] it's going to rain
[1:09:31] and we need to escape the rain and the
[1:09:34] lion pick up mama lion and they both
[1:09:37] begin to come slowly to the ark
[1:09:40] [Applause]
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:42] everybody here
[1:09:43] and when they entered the oak
[1:09:46] no lion could chase
[1:09:49] a lamb inside the ark
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:56] in other words inside the ark of noah
[1:10:01] was like a
[1:10:03] duplicate of the garden of eden
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:12] anybody here
[1:10:14] as long as the lions stay in the ark
[1:10:18] the god can dance before him
[1:10:21] no problem
[1:10:24] but the day the lion left the ark
[1:10:27] then they got to begin to go back again
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:36] hallelujah
[1:10:38] am i reading a different bible
[1:10:40] praise god amen
[1:10:42] so all of them is tame naturally now in
[1:10:46] the present tense when sin is existing
[1:10:49] already it's tame
[1:10:51] and has been water
[1:10:54] of what
[1:10:55] of mankind
[1:10:57] man still under sin
[1:11:01] have not lost
[1:11:02] that dominion
[1:11:04] the difference
[1:11:06] is the way he's operating that dominion
[1:11:10] is we're using a different channel
[1:11:13] because in the garden of eden we have
[1:11:15] two trees
[1:11:18] anybody
[1:11:19] the tree of what
[1:11:22] life and the tree of water
[1:11:25] he's using his gift
[1:11:29] his domain
[1:11:30] through the tree of knowledge
[1:11:34] to dominate
[1:11:36] but that was not what god intended
[1:11:41] blessed be the name of the lord verse
[1:11:43] eight but the tongue can no man tame
[1:11:47] the only man who can tame the tongue now
[1:11:49] we know him
[1:11:50] when he came down in the upper room he
[1:11:53] got in
[1:11:54] a hold the tongue anybody clear
[1:11:58] it is an unruly evil
[1:12:00] full of deadly poison
[1:12:04] dare with
[1:12:07] bless we god
[1:12:09] even the father
[1:12:10] and dare with curse we men
[1:12:14] which are made after the simulated of
[1:12:17] god
[1:12:19] james is pointing here of a tongue that
[1:12:22] is producing two things
[1:12:26] it is a tongue that produces black and
[1:12:28] white
[1:12:29] that produce good and evil that produce
[1:12:32] blessings and cursing
[1:12:35] same time
[1:12:36] watch verse 10
[1:12:38] out of the same water
[1:12:40] remember mouth tongue lips is thinking
[1:12:42] about the same thing
[1:12:44] out of the same mouth proceed with water
[1:12:48] and water
[1:12:49] blessing and cursing my brethren these
[1:12:53] things ought not so too
[1:12:56] in other words a christian cannot
[1:12:58] produce both
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] anybody clear a christian cannot curse
[1:13:06] and bless
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:12] it's a problem
[1:13:13] anybody clear
[1:13:15] a christian only blessings
[1:13:22] let's go to first peter 3
[1:13:24] and you're going to see what a christian
[1:13:26] does
[1:13:27] and we will be praying
[1:13:29] i have a cargo
[1:13:31] let me deliver it
[1:13:33] okay
[1:13:34] so buckle up one service
[1:13:38] relax no sleeping

[1:13:44] if you dare you can say amen
[1:13:46] verse nine are you there
[1:13:48] remember this not rendering evil for
[1:13:53] because somebody is cussing you
[1:13:55] they want you to cuss back
[1:13:57] but a christian cannot
[1:14:00] do you understand now
[1:14:02] it's a temptation
[1:14:04] oh railing for
[1:14:06] railing means insult
[1:14:08] everybody clear
[1:14:09] but contrary is water
[1:14:12] so here peter is saying despite the
[1:14:15] pressure
[1:14:16] that comes on you
[1:14:18] if your source
[1:14:20] is only blessing
[1:14:22] if somebody squeezed you what comes out
[1:14:26] if they squeeze you again what comes out
[1:14:28] if they keep squeezing you what comes
[1:14:29] down
[1:14:33] but if they squeeze you and
[1:14:37] so something was there
[1:14:40] that was not supposed to be there
[1:14:42] anybody clear
[1:14:44] all right but contreras blessing
[1:14:47] knowing that you are called you are
[1:14:51] there unto call you are called to
[1:14:54] blessing

[1:15:00] should inherit uh
[1:15:02] you are a blessing
[1:15:04] you are called for a blessing and your
[1:15:06] inheritance is a blessing so your life
[1:15:09] from start to finish is
[1:15:14] where should curse come from
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:20] for he
[1:15:21] that will love life and see what
[1:15:26] let him do what
[1:15:29] because the course of your life
[1:15:31] is coming from what
[1:15:33] you're writing your own story
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:38] all right let him refrain his strong
[1:15:41] from water
[1:15:43] did they say refrain your tongue from
[1:15:45] good
[1:15:48] did they say refrain your tongue from
[1:15:50] good
[1:15:51] why you don't speak good
[1:15:56] nobody told you not to speak good
[1:15:59] you the one not speaking good
[1:16:03] so what do you expect in your life
[1:16:06] if you don't speak it who's going to
[1:16:08] speak it for you
[1:16:16] you're waiting for me to speak for you
[1:16:20] as a pastor yes
[1:16:22] but i have also
[1:16:25] my life
[1:16:30] let him refrain his tongue from
[1:16:33] evil and he sleeps that they speak no
[1:16:37] water
[1:16:38] why do you have to refrain your tongue
[1:16:40] from evil
[1:16:43] because you don't understand the power
[1:16:45] of your tongue when it comes out
[1:16:50] you better go quickly
[1:16:52] and let the blood of jesus christ erase
[1:16:54] it
[1:16:56] brother brother say every word that we
[1:16:58] speak here stays on the earth
[1:17:03] but branham say that
[1:17:05] brother branham said that even the word
[1:17:07] of jesus christ are still moving
[1:17:13] when you go to a pond
[1:17:16] there is water
[1:17:18] anybody clear
[1:17:20] when you take a stone
[1:17:22] and you drop it in the water what do you
[1:17:24] see
[1:17:26] how do they go
[1:17:31] until there
[1:17:33] but they don't disappear
[1:17:35] they bounce back
[1:17:37] that's how you word them
[1:17:41] that's how your words are
[1:17:44] okay you talking to somebody who is way
[1:17:47] down in africa
[1:17:50] how do they hear you
[1:17:51] you are here
[1:17:53] you say hello
[1:17:56] so much many thousands of miles
[1:17:59] they hear you over there hello
[1:18:02] if they're in australia or in europe
[1:18:05] when you say how are you doing at the
[1:18:07] same minute over there how are you doing
[1:18:10] exactly you talking not somebody else or
[1:18:13] a robot talking it's your voice
[1:18:15] talking over there how does your voice
[1:18:18] reach india quickly
[1:18:21] i'm asking you
[1:18:23] how is it that you speak right here and
[1:18:25] somebody means you're getting you
[1:18:28] well if i tell you if i give you a
[1:18:31] ticket for uh from here to india it
[1:18:34] might take you more than a day
[1:18:36] how can you listen at the same second
[1:18:39] somebody in india is hearing you
[1:18:41] what is the power the speed that your
[1:18:44] voice goes with
[1:18:48] you see the dimension
[1:18:50] so you might think i'm speaking here
[1:18:53] but that word is going somewhere there
[1:18:58] can i help you
[1:18:59] that's why the roman centurion told
[1:19:01] jesus
[1:19:04] just do whatever
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:11] and when he went home
[1:19:14] and asked the question
[1:19:17] do you know what time was my servant
[1:19:20] here
[1:19:21] which time did they give it to him
[1:19:23] did they give him three hours for the
[1:19:25] word of jesus to travel
[1:19:28] they told him at the same time jesus
[1:19:30] spoke
[1:19:31] at the same time over there the man was
[1:19:34] healed
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:40] a loved one is far away you can speak
[1:19:43] right here
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:53] i'm doing this so your mind open up
[1:19:57] because this technology has clogged our
[1:20:00] faith
[1:20:01] we can't believe big things
[1:20:04] we want things that make sense
[1:20:08] i got into the airplane then i traveled
[1:20:10] then i suffered and i went there then i
[1:20:12] see them then i lay hand and then they
[1:20:14] got pray so everybody understand yeah
[1:20:16] yeah that makes sense
[1:20:18] that's not the gentile faith
[1:20:21] the gentile faith is you speak right
[1:20:23] here
[1:20:23] just as your voice leave here and go
[1:20:26] straight to india
[1:20:27] if that person is in india
[1:20:34] oh my god
[1:20:36] open second king chapter six and then
[1:20:38] we're gonna pray
[1:20:45] or maybe you heard this too much and you
[1:20:47] know already everything
[1:20:50] so you don't need you are looking at
[1:20:52] like brother stephen we already know
[1:20:54] this stuff
[1:20:56] if you know this stuff you should not be
[1:20:58] where you are
[1:21:02] it means you miss something

[1:21:17] in poverty
[1:21:24] amen you just feel your head
[1:21:28] but you never understand it
[1:21:30] because the one who understand it
[1:21:32] they just leave
[1:21:34] and the people look they say that man i
[1:21:36] need to get closer to him
[1:21:38] how do you do your stuff

[1:22:32] ability you have given us when it comes
[1:22:35] to interpreting the scripture and giving
[1:22:38] a spiritual revelation the only one who
[1:22:41] can do that is only you the lord jesus
[1:22:44] christ lord if there is anything

[1:23:06] even by our movement father may you

[1:23:11] beginning the alpha and the omega of

[1:23:19] christ amen
[1:23:21] god richly bless you
[1:23:23] i already read this now we are dealing
[1:23:26] with
[1:23:27] the second banquet of esther we're on
[1:23:29] part 17
[1:23:30] we're still dealing with the second
[1:23:32] death we got into this territory of the
[1:23:34] tongue and i'm gonna obey the boss and
[1:23:37] keep talking until he tells me to move
[1:23:40] on today we will speak about tongue and
[1:23:43] works
[1:23:44] we talk about tongue and hell tongue and
[1:23:47] power tongue and this today we're going
[1:23:49] to talk about the tongue and the works
[1:23:51] everybody clear i want you to really
[1:23:54] really focus and do the best
[1:23:57] unless necessary not to move
[1:24:01] everybody clear i'm not saying don't
[1:24:03] shake
[1:24:04] i'm saying not moving
[1:24:06] unless it's necessary anybody clear
[1:24:09] we found out that man
[1:24:12] according to james
[1:24:14] even though man
[1:24:17] is still under the dominion of sin
[1:24:20] especially if he's not converted
[1:24:22] men still have the ability
[1:24:25] to apply
[1:24:28] this dominance upon the kingdom that the
[1:24:31] lord gave it to him in the garden of
[1:24:33] eden hey but here
[1:24:35] in other words man
[1:24:37] first was living by a different law
[1:24:40] because man was in fellowship with god
[1:24:43] anybody clear
[1:24:45] but when sin was introduced
[1:24:47] man moved from a fellowship with god
[1:24:51] because he went and touched the wrong
[1:24:53] tree which is the tree of the knowledge
[1:24:55] of good and evil and from there on man
[1:24:58] begin to operate under the knowledge of
[1:25:02] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:25:04] evil in other words man begin to operate
[1:25:08] under his intellect
[1:25:10] anybody
[1:25:12] over here he was operating on the faith
[1:25:15] but over here he's operating with his
[1:25:18] own intelligence
[1:25:20] and then james is showing to us
[1:25:23] that even though he's operating under
[1:25:26] his own intelligence
[1:25:28] yet he managed how to dominate those
[1:25:31] kingdoms
[1:25:33] why
[1:25:34] is men able to dominate even though he's
[1:25:37] there
[1:25:38] brother brother i'm saying the message
[1:25:40] fellowship by redemption but kill him
[1:25:42] just a little bit more he said but a man
[1:25:45] has a soul
[1:25:47] and therefore that soul
[1:25:49] is a part of god
[1:25:52] and even in its fallen state
[1:25:55] everybody clear
[1:25:57] what is it
[1:25:59] the soul
[1:26:00] everybody
[1:26:02] even in its fallen state
[1:26:05] yet it is the most greatest specie
[1:26:09] of all the species of the earth is the
[1:26:12] man
[1:26:13] because man was created in the image and
[1:26:16] the likeness of god
[1:26:17] and then get him in connection with his
[1:26:21] maker that's what he lost in the garden
[1:26:23] of eden he becomes a water a superman
[1:26:28] so the man that was a superman that
[1:26:30] could move the mountain and move
[1:26:32] everything was a man in fellowship or in
[1:26:36] connection with god
[1:26:38] but the lust of connection or the
[1:26:40] disconnection
[1:26:42] brought man into a lower state but
[1:26:44] despite the fact that man is under a
[1:26:47] lower state yet he's still dominating
[1:26:50] the kingdom
[1:26:51] ever here brother branham said he
[1:26:53] becomes a superman almost because he's a
[1:26:57] son of god
[1:26:58] he becomes acquainted with his maker
[1:27:01] with the creator of all things and then
[1:27:04] when that man there acquainted with his
[1:27:07] maker becomes a part of his maker
[1:27:10] becomes back into fellowship with his
[1:27:12] maker every divine water
[1:27:16] world becomes a living reality to him
[1:27:20] and he believes it
[1:27:24] anybody here so a man that has been
[1:27:28] redeemed
[1:27:29] under the redemptive blessings of god is
[1:27:33] a man that can take god at every single
[1:27:37] word
[1:27:40] anybody clear so far
[1:27:42] no wonder people can believe divine
[1:27:44] healing today they have not got nothing
[1:27:47] to believe with
[1:27:50] origin
[1:27:51] until god comes into water
[1:27:54] where the soul is a man is not much
[1:27:58] better than a brute
[1:28:00] his reason he shall think it all out
[1:28:04] how can this be and explain it all away
[1:28:07] but when god ever takes his position
[1:28:11] in the human water you remember last
[1:28:14] sunday all reasoning fades away
[1:28:18] god becomes water
[1:28:20] everybody cares so far
[1:28:22] so man back in connection with god give
[1:28:26] him the authority
[1:28:28] and the power to exercise his authority
[1:28:32] like adam
[1:28:35] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:28:37] lord brother branham say god wanted
[1:28:41] fellowship
[1:28:42] and if we no matter if man today is a
[1:28:46] fallen son of god there is some part of
[1:28:49] god still with that man in his fallen
[1:28:52] state
[1:28:53] but here you take a man today that can
[1:28:56] split an atom tree of knowledge of good
[1:28:59] and evil
[1:29:00] or molecule or whatever you want to call
[1:29:03] it and can drive and can drive a jet
[1:29:06] plane around the world in a few hours
[1:29:09] and you can see that something in him is
[1:29:12] a fallen creation
[1:29:14] now he cannot create anything
[1:29:18] everybody clear but he can pervert
[1:29:22] what has been created into something to
[1:29:25] do what
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:27] about here
[1:29:29] and that shows that men never come from
[1:29:32] animal life
[1:29:34] because animal continually builds the
[1:29:37] same habitation to live in
[1:29:41] you will never see an elephant begin to
[1:29:44] build houses
[1:29:45] you will never see a giraffe begin to
[1:29:48] change his way of living
[1:29:50] the same way that giraffe was living in
[1:29:53] the garden of eden is the same way the
[1:29:56] giraffe is living today but man is
[1:29:59] changing from time to time
[1:30:02] we used to go with the horses and baggy
[1:30:05] then we get to the car then we get to
[1:30:07] the airplane then we get to the rocket
[1:30:10] men continue to improve
[1:30:14] why because there is something in man
[1:30:18] that is like god
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:21] but man makes him a better house
[1:30:25] a better way of living better clothing
[1:30:28] better transportation now all that shows
[1:30:31] that something behind even in his fallen
[1:30:34] state he's still a son of god fallen
[1:30:39] that's what james is saying that
[1:30:42] everything the fishes of the sea the
[1:30:45] fall of the the living man all of that
[1:30:48] the living creature all of them were
[1:30:50] dominated and are still dominating by
[1:30:52] men how by intellectual
[1:30:56] by the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:30:58] evil by science by technology that's how
[1:31:02] man is dominating but god is calling to
[1:31:05] a higher civilization
[1:31:08] everybody clear now buckle up pretty
[1:31:11] good
[1:31:11] this man here
[1:31:14] that we talk about
[1:31:15] that in the garden of eden was
[1:31:18] dominating by the power of the spoken
[1:31:20] word and lost the power and now even in
[1:31:24] his fallen state he's dominated through
[1:31:27] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:31:30] men live in three realms
[1:31:36] everybody here
[1:31:38] men live under three elements

[1:51:59] and to capture russia number one you
[1:52:02] need to have some ice
[1:52:04] and number two you need to know who
[1:52:06] elisha is
[1:52:10] it's identification of the man
[1:52:13] and the optical eyes
[1:52:15] everybody
[1:52:16] so elijah asked god
[1:52:19] keep their eyes open
[1:52:22] but turn off their identification eyes
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] did you catch me
[1:52:31] in other words keep them in the
[1:52:33] humanistic level but remove them the
[1:52:37] revelation of who i am
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:43] do you understand
[1:52:45] when the revelation of who erasure is is
[1:52:48] removed
[1:52:49] they can look at elisha they won't
[1:52:52] recognize it is elijah because of lack
[1:52:55] of revelation
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:06] did i lose anybody
[1:53:07] did that lose anybody
[1:53:10] so the second prayer is
[1:53:12] block the revelation
[1:53:14] keep them in the humanistic level
[1:53:17] so when they see elijah elijah can be
[1:53:20] talking to them and they cannot see
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:26] do you understand
[1:53:27] when the disciples were on the road to
[1:53:30] emmaus
[1:53:32] and they were talking about jesus christ
[1:53:35] then jesus approaches
[1:53:38] keep them seeing but he broke the
[1:53:41] revelation
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:44] and they're looking at jesus and they
[1:53:46] even ask him are you the only one who
[1:53:48] doesn't know what was coming up

[1:54:27] sees

[1:54:44] they say man you know the scripture
[1:54:48] ever here

[1:55:43] city follow me they were following who

[2:04:38] of the body everybody here
[2:04:41] and he also deal
[2:04:43] with the five senses of the spirit
[2:04:47] everybody here because the spirit

[2:05:33] brain
[2:05:34] and take that information and put the
[2:05:37] data and say that's brother lemon right
[2:05:40] and interpret it
[2:05:41] oh he's in church he's sitting he's

[2:05:46] the spirit anybody clear
[2:05:49] that doorman here of the fafsa says the
[2:05:52] one who dominated the most
[2:05:55] is the eye
[2:05:57] brother branham say
[2:05:59] may every person in here that is bound
[2:06:02] by the census-bound existence
[2:06:06] in other words the men that live under
[2:06:08] humanistic
[2:06:09] only trusting on what they can
[2:06:16] that is a man that is conan
[2:06:23] it is a type of thomas
[2:06:26] amen
[2:06:29] you can tell him jesus is reason he
[2:06:31] won't believe it until he sees it and
[2:06:34] jesus told him thomas come here
[2:06:38] go ahead and touch him but blessed
[2:06:41] is he that believe without water
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:47] a man that when you talk to him

[2:06:59] how much money you have you have to see
[2:07:01] the deposit you have to see that is the
[2:07:04] corner humanistic man
[2:07:07] that's how they operate
[2:07:09] everybody so far
[2:07:11] brother branham say may they fall away
[2:07:14] from that tonight

[2:08:29] i have a very clear so these ten
[2:08:32] five senses here and five senses here

[2:09:11] got pregnant
[2:09:13] and rachel brought
[2:09:15] a child who was number 11
[2:09:20] joseph
[2:09:21] when joseph came
[2:09:24] joseph was born as a
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:30] prophet joseph came with the spiritual
[2:09:34] insight in the family of jacob
[2:09:38] and the bible said the patriarch
[2:09:42] the father because of jealousy
[2:09:46] the 10 brothers
[2:09:50] sold number 11
[2:09:53] because number 11 was spiritual
[2:09:56] and they could not handle spiritual
[2:09:59] everybody care because brother problem
[2:10:01] say number 10 is a carnal number
[2:10:04] and brother branham said when the tribe
[2:10:06] were 10 they were connor
[2:10:09] and they saw joseph which was number 11
[2:10:13] which was coming with a revelation
[2:10:17] your 10 senses will sell you

[2:10:33] then when we move on the second realm
[2:10:36] the realm of faith brother branham said
[2:10:39] the importance of revelation
[2:10:42] by the spirit to a true believer can
[2:10:45] never be overwhelmed
[2:10:51] revelation
[2:10:52] means more to you than perhaps you
[2:10:55] realize
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:10:58] anybody care
[2:10:59] now i'm not talking about this book of
[2:11:02] revelation
[2:11:03] and you i am talking about our
[2:11:07] revelation it is tremendously important
[2:11:11] to the church
[2:11:14] revelation is faith
[2:11:17] [Applause]
[2:11:19] revelation is the substance of things
[2:11:24] you hope for
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:28] do you understand
[2:11:30] when you hope something
[2:11:32] you are in the air
[2:11:34] because you just hope
[2:11:36] everybody

[2:11:52] he say the lord put in my heart to give
[2:11:55] you two thousand dollars
[2:11:57] i better clear
[2:11:58] when you get two thousand dollars in
[2:12:01] your hand
[2:12:03] it's no more hope
[2:12:06] do you follow me
[2:12:07] do you follow me
[2:12:08] two thousand dollars
[2:12:10] is the substance
[2:12:14] of what you were hoping for
[2:12:18] in other words
[2:12:19] in other words two thousand dollars is a
[2:12:22] computer in money form
[2:12:27] everybody here
[2:12:28] so when you have two thousand dollars
[2:12:31] even though you have not bought the

[2:13:17] the money is the substance of what you
[2:13:21] are
[2:13:22] hoping for money is a faith that's why
[2:13:25] brother branham said money is like faith
[2:13:29] [Music]

[2:18:39] there is three elements that people
[2:18:42] now he's more
[2:18:44] he was dwelling now it's living in
[2:18:47] first it is water
[2:18:49] humanistic second secularism
[2:18:53] and third is water
[2:18:55] now dislike in prayer when you pray for
[2:18:58] anyone in humanistic we say well ah
[2:19:04] you shall get well see i'm hoping i'm
[2:19:06] believing for you trying to use all the
[2:19:09] faith that i can
[2:19:10] those are language of a humanistic level
[2:19:14] everybody
[2:19:15] that is human
[2:19:17] compassion
[2:19:19] second is divine revelation when
[2:19:22] something is what
[2:19:24] now you understand that i in the art
[2:19:27] is revealed to you you just know in your
[2:19:32] it's going to happen yet there is
[2:19:34] nothing but just there
[2:19:37] a substance
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:42] you think they're going to give it to
[2:19:44] you yes i'm going
[2:19:46] i don't know how but i'm just going
[2:19:48] back here a third is a vision because
[2:19:52] that is
[2:19:54] that is what
[2:19:56] it will never fail
[2:20:03] hallelujah so now you understand that
[2:20:06] the humanistic
[2:20:08] give you hope
[2:20:09] give you intellectual faith
[2:20:12] but the domain of a revelation deal with
[2:20:15] what
[2:20:16] everybody clear now
[2:20:17] and this doorman
[2:20:19] by the vision when you go the vision
[2:20:22] take
[2:20:24] the heart and the eye
[2:20:27] and put them together
[2:20:34] [Laughter]
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:37] are you ready
[2:20:39] in proverbs 29
[2:20:42] verse 18 the bible says where there is
[2:20:46] no vision the people
[2:20:48] but he that keeps the law happy
[2:20:54] [Music]
[2:20:56] if there is no vision
[2:20:58] the people perish
[2:21:01] but even though there is no vision
[2:21:04] if you want to be happy hold to the word
[2:21:11] okay
[2:21:12] okay if there is no vision
[2:21:15] then you go back to the world
[2:21:19] do you hear me
[2:21:20] if god gives you a vision you walk in
[2:21:22] the vision
[2:21:23] but if you are praying and you don't see
[2:21:26] vision
[2:21:27] now you have a right as a believer to
[2:21:29] get the word
[2:21:31] [Music]
[2:21:31] [Applause]
[2:21:35] [Music]
[2:21:37] when jesus met the devil in the
[2:21:39] wilderness
[2:21:41] and the devil began to tempt him
[2:21:44] the devil spoke and jesus said it is
[2:21:46] written
[2:21:47] spark it is written spoke it is written
[2:21:53] brother branham said the reason he did
[2:21:56] that
[2:21:57] is to say that
[2:21:59] every christian
[2:22:02] no matter where he is
[2:22:05] brother branham said if you notice jesus
[2:22:08] never use any gift
[2:22:11] he only stick to the word
[2:22:14] showing that
[2:22:15] every christian
[2:22:17] when they're going to trouba
[2:22:20] if they just take the world
[2:22:23] they can defeat the devil
[2:22:25] everywhere
[2:22:27] anywhere under any circumstances
[2:22:31] [Applause]
[2:22:36] so when you are weak
[2:22:38] you don't feel like you praying
[2:22:40] don't get discouraged hold to the word
[2:22:44] [Applause]
[2:22:54] hallelujah that's why the prophet have
[2:22:57] to store the word
[2:22:59] so when the prophet is out
[2:23:01] we got the word
[2:23:03] [Applause]
[2:23:06] hallelujah
[2:23:07] if i don't see anything if i don't feel
[2:23:10] anything if i don't feel anything in my
[2:23:12] heart you take god in his word
[2:23:17] [Applause]
[2:23:18] hallelujah

[2:23:22] you up now
[2:23:23] [Applause]
[2:23:27] i wish i can have two hours with you
[2:23:30] here
[2:23:31] oh my god
[2:23:33] number 24 remember vision
[2:23:36] take the optical element
[2:23:38] of the corner mind
[2:23:40] and combine it with the heart
[2:23:42] the corner man uses the eye and working
[2:23:45] with the visible
[2:23:46] the revelation uses the heart the vision
[2:23:49] take the heart and the other one and
[2:23:51] combine both of them
[2:23:52] [Applause]
[2:23:57] let me help you up again
[2:23:59] we talk about their brain
[2:24:01] and we talk about the heart we showed
[2:24:03] you that the spirit operates here
[2:24:06] and this is the first conscience
[2:24:08] right
[2:24:09] and this is the heart where the soul is
[2:24:12] and this is the second conscience or the
[2:24:15] sub-conscience
[2:24:19] here humanistic work with the first
[2:24:22] conscience
[2:24:23] revelation work with the subconscious
[2:24:26] vision take the two conscience and mix
[2:24:29] them together
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:32] relax relax
[2:24:35] hallelujah number 24 verse 4
[2:24:38] he has said which heard the word of god
[2:24:42] which saw the vision of who
[2:24:46] falling into a water
[2:24:48] but having his eyes
[2:24:54] are you okay
[2:24:55] in the vision
[2:24:57] you grow into a dimension but your eyes
[2:25:00] still
[2:25:03] are you there
[2:25:04] he said
[2:25:06] which heard the word of god verse 16 and
[2:25:09] knew the knowledge of the most high
[2:25:11] which saw the water
[2:25:13] of the almighty falling into a water
[2:25:17] but having his eyes what
[2:25:19] a vision uses the heart and the eyes
[2:25:24] yes
[2:25:26] john 5 then answer jesus and say unto
[2:25:29] them verily verily i say unto you the
[2:25:32] son can do nothing of himself but what
[2:25:35] he what
[2:25:37] the father do
[2:25:38] what things so ever he does these also
[2:25:42] do the son likewise
[2:25:44] for the father love of the son and show
[2:25:47] him what
[2:25:48] that himself does and he will show him
[2:25:51] greater words than this that he may
[2:25:54] in other words before jesus do something
[2:25:57] he saw a movie
[2:25:59] and when they show him the movie he
[2:26:00] begin to work like the movie
[2:26:03] but here that's why when brother branham
[2:26:05] saw vision brother brother have to be
[2:26:08] specific on the characteristic of the
[2:26:10] vision
[2:26:11] and when brother branham get to your
[2:26:13] home
[2:26:14] and in the vision he prayed for you when
[2:26:16] sister becky stretched brother branham
[2:26:19] have to wait until sister break is
[2:26:21] stretched before he does it
[2:26:23] as long as the sister have now stretched
[2:26:25] he's going to be waiting
[2:26:27] because you do as the father does
[2:26:33] sorry sister country on god
[2:26:35] ever here
[2:26:37] the bible says in first samuel nana
[2:26:40] before time in israel when a man wants
[2:26:43] to inquire who
[2:26:45] of god that's respect
[2:26:48] come and let us go to the water
[2:26:51] for he that is now called uh
[2:26:54] was before time called uh
[2:26:57] because the prophet uses his eye
[2:26:59] yet his heart open up at the same time
[2:27:04] but here
[2:27:05] so the humanistic kernel element work
[2:27:08] with your visual
[2:27:10] it gives you the visible world this is
[2:27:12] what you see
[2:27:13] the domain of the revelation goes with
[2:27:16] the heart and it's the holy spirit
[2:27:18] coming and bringing you a revelation
[2:27:21] this one brings you senses
[2:27:24] that are different than your natural
[2:27:27] senses remember the heart to have eyes
[2:27:30] right
[2:27:31] and the heart also have an ear
[2:27:34] to him that hears let him hear what the
[2:27:38] it's another ear
[2:27:40] come and test and see if the lord is
[2:27:42] water
[2:27:43] it's a different taste
[2:27:45] when you say yummy it is not here it is
[2:27:47] this person saying it is yummy because
[2:27:50] men shall not live by bread alone but
[2:27:53] every
[2:27:54] you are eating right here it's a
[2:27:56] different senses smell the lord smell
[2:27:59] the sacrifice the lord is a spirit he's
[2:28:02] smelling that in a different
[2:28:05] touch the lord when you touch him
[2:28:07] brother branham says somebody is there
[2:28:09] praying and he touch him the person
[2:28:12] never touched the pillar of fire it's a
[2:28:14] different touch it's a touch of faith
[2:28:17] which is a touch of that
[2:28:19] jesus said who touched me
[2:28:21] they didn't touch jesus they touched the
[2:28:24] helm of his government but jesus felt it
[2:28:27] in his word
[2:28:31] hallelujah
[2:28:33] it is a different sentence
[2:28:35] but here then the vision is using the
[2:28:38] vision and the divine revelation the
[2:28:41] visual and putting that together
[2:28:43] everybody clear so far everybody here so
[2:28:45] far are we okay you want to stop here
[2:28:49] [Laughter]
[2:28:54] let me look at the time
[2:28:56] it's 32. i usually have to stop at 30.
[2:28:59] let me drop this down and we got to stop
[2:29:02] not even half of what i wanted to
[2:29:04] deliver
[2:29:06] everybody amen now we got three parts
[2:29:10] here we got the carnal humanistic
[2:29:13] we got faith revelation we got vision
[2:29:16] which is what that saved the lord to
[2:29:18] move from here to here you use your
[2:29:21] tongue or to move from here to here you
[2:29:23] use prayer but the problem is we're
[2:29:25] trying to know how do we use the tongue
[2:29:29] and you don't have time for me
[2:29:31] everybody
[2:29:33] if you take these three elements
[2:29:36] and i put two
[2:29:38] sets
[2:29:39] the mathematics of god
[2:29:42] in the left side
[2:29:43] i put a humanistic there
[2:29:46] everybody okay
[2:29:48] everybody okay
[2:29:50] in the right side the humanistic side
[2:29:52] over there deal with the brain
[2:29:56] you already understand that it deals
[2:29:58] with the optical eye the visible world
[2:30:00] in the right side we get divine
[2:30:02] revelation and divine revelation deals
[2:30:05] with what
[2:30:07] in the middle you got vision
[2:30:10] because vision combined the two
[2:30:13] but here so the intersection between the
[2:30:16] two is vision over here
[2:30:18] is purely humanistic over here it's
[2:30:21] purely divine revelation but the mixture
[2:30:24] of the two in the middle give you water
[2:30:28] everybody clear so far
[2:30:30] there is an element
[2:30:32] that falls on the vision
[2:30:36] that element
[2:30:37] is called dream
[2:30:39] sister amy
[2:30:44] you remember yesterday right
[2:30:46] that's what the pastor was talking about
[2:30:48] amen
[2:30:51] what is a dream
[2:30:54] if you look right here purely everything
[2:30:57] here is humanistic
[2:30:59] everything over here is a divine
[2:31:01] revelation
[2:31:02] what is in the middle it's a mixture of
[2:31:05] two which puts you in the domain of a
[2:31:07] vision so if you hear you carnal
[2:31:10] if you get here you're in a revelation
[2:31:13] where god speaks to your heart
[2:31:15] and your heart is directing your life
[2:31:17] anybody clear
[2:31:18] you can get a husband here you can get a
[2:31:21] husband here or you can get a husband
[2:31:23] here
[2:31:30] you can get a prophet here
[2:31:33] you can get a prophet here or you can
[2:31:35] get a prophet here
[2:31:42] over here is what people told you
[2:31:45] that brother branham is a prophet
[2:31:47] here
[2:31:49] right
[2:31:50] in divine revelation
[2:31:52] is when the woman at the well said sir i
[2:31:56] perceive
[2:31:57] i'm not perceiving here
[2:31:59] i'm seeing here that you are here
[2:32:03] something in me tells me that you are
[2:32:06] here
[2:32:08] that is the divine revelation
[2:32:10] ever here the vision is when je mama
[2:32:14] mommy in tennessee wait in the morning
[2:32:17] and say daddy
[2:32:18] i pray

[2:32:47] waiting for you good morning pastor that
[2:32:50] was the realm of revelation
[2:32:52] [Applause]
[2:33:00] hallelujah
[2:33:01] depending on where you live
[2:33:04] you can live in revelation or you can
[2:33:06] live in a vision
[2:33:07] those are the realm you should be
[2:33:09] balancing

[2:38:53] is a point here
[2:38:54] that is not here
[2:38:56] it is not here
[2:38:58] it is not here but it's just where it is
[2:39:03] that point
[2:39:05] is the dream
[2:39:10] you want to go home
[2:39:18] brother kelly i'm not responsible
[2:39:22] so i'm i'm getting off the trouble with

[2:39:27] we gotta talk to you
[2:39:29] okay so you heard them brother robert
[2:39:32] okay okay let me get this so i'll let
[2:39:33] you go home and throughout the week
[2:39:38] everybody clear
[2:39:40] the dream world is a dream hallelujah
[2:39:43] brother branham say
[2:39:45] here is what it is here is a man
[2:39:47] conscience first conscience
[2:39:49] right here the conscience you live in
[2:39:51] now we are taught by science that you
[2:39:54] are dreaming
[2:39:55] you are in your what
[2:39:57] you are done here in the heart
[2:40:00] did you ever seen a person dreaming you
[2:40:02] think you dream all night
[2:40:04] it is not that long
[2:40:07] that's why it's a point
[2:40:10] just a what
[2:40:11] a little bit you have done dream hours
[2:40:14] of dream you think but just a moment a
[2:40:17] flash while it's going through the
[2:40:19] person that is dreaming is not
[2:40:24] here
[2:40:26] in the heart subconscious you get there
[2:40:27] when you sleep
[2:40:29] here you are awake
[2:40:30] here you are awake but you can jump in
[2:40:33] your conscience that's why the prophet
[2:40:35] have two conscience superimposed
[2:40:37] they can be looking at you but they're
[2:40:39] acting like they're dreaming it's just
[2:40:41] he's all using his optical and the
[2:40:43] vision up and up and the prophet begin
[2:40:45] to say yeah i see i see something going
[2:40:47] on you see him with eyes open
[2:40:49] he's using both of them
[2:40:51] but clear he's in right here but in the
[2:40:54] dream
[2:40:57] hallelujah
[2:40:58] when
[2:41:00] then you actually had some part of you
[2:41:02] some makeup was somewhere and seen
[2:41:04] something that very yet in your mind
[2:41:07] it's that right that is your
[2:41:08] subconscious so when you dream you are
[2:41:10] here you're sleeping you're not really
[2:41:13] sleeping you are not awake but you lack
[2:41:15] caught between two dimensions
[2:41:19] now a normal person dream because when
[2:41:22] you are here your subconscious they say
[2:41:24] is set far this far from you now the man
[2:41:27] that doesn't dream say his subconscious
[2:41:29] will be plumbed back to that wall there
[2:41:32] he sleeps so sound that he never wakes
[2:41:34] up
[2:41:35] a noise doesn't wake him up but a person
[2:41:38] that dream is not all together
[2:41:41] did you know that a dream only last uh
[2:41:44] or
[2:41:45] it's a point but it's just between
[2:41:49] and what
[2:41:50] that's why it's between there
[2:41:53] okay you're not here you're not here
[2:41:55] point you're not even in a vision
[2:42:00] but you're close to the vision
[2:42:03] hallelujah
[2:42:05] just like dreaming a dream some people
[2:42:08] dream dream some doesn't you are
[2:42:09] dreaming it is your and an ordinary man
[2:42:13] let's say his subconscious heart hears
[2:42:15] it first when he's here when you go to
[2:42:18] sleep you dream of things that you did
[2:42:20] when you was awake when you wake up you
[2:42:22] remember things that you dreamed even
[2:42:24] years ago is that right some people
[2:42:26] never have a dream a person that sleeps
[2:42:29] sound doesn't dream it's the people that
[2:42:32] doesn't sleep very sound that has the
[2:42:34] dream they are not all together
[2:42:38] or not all together
[2:42:40] they are in the point
[2:42:42] anybody clear so far
[2:42:44] all right now a dream and let me go to
[2:42:46] the airport number 16 no and he said
[2:42:49] here now my word
[2:42:51] if there be
[2:42:52] a you i the lord will make myself known
[2:42:57] unto him in
[2:42:59] number three and i will speak unto him
[2:43:01] in uh
[2:43:06] why is a prophet
[2:43:08] using dream and vision
[2:43:12] joe too and it shall come to pass
[2:43:14] afterwards that i will pour out my water
[2:43:19] upon all flesh it's the holy ghost and
[2:43:21] your sons and your daughters shall
[2:43:25] by the spirit your old men shall dream
[2:43:30] by the spirit your young men shall see
[2:43:33] you see the two
[2:43:36] the fulfillment and it shall come to
[2:43:38] pass in the last day i will pull out my
[2:43:40] spirit upon our flesh and your sons and
[2:43:42] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[2:43:44] young men shall see
[2:43:46] and your old men shall dream water so we
[2:43:49] see dreams and vision getting closer
[2:43:52] together
[2:43:54] everybody
[2:43:55] a dream interpreted
[2:43:58] is there
[2:44:02] [Music]
[2:44:04] because vision you don't sleep
[2:44:08] you are wide awake and you see
[2:44:10] and in a dream you are not really
[2:44:12] sleeping you are not really awakened so
[2:44:15] it's a mild form of a dreamer
[2:44:20] a mild form of a vision
[2:44:23] because a person not may be born with
[2:44:27] that subconscious to say
[2:44:29] be awake when he sees it then god get
[2:44:32] over into his sub into the subconscious
[2:44:34] and speak to him which he promised that
[2:44:37] in
[2:44:38] remember joe
[2:44:39] and the book of acts in the last day he
[2:44:42] will visit his people also in vision
[2:44:45] we have seen his star we found joseph
[2:44:48] early jacob's son that he was a prophet
[2:44:52] and a prophet understood dreams
[2:44:55] now if a dream is interpreted then it
[2:44:59] becomes uh
[2:45:00] it is uh
[2:45:04] anybody clear now
[2:45:06] you remember that
[2:45:07] okay praise god
[2:45:09] john 33
[2:45:11] for god speak once
[2:45:13] yeah twice yet man
[2:45:16] in other words god gives us a lot of
[2:45:18] messages
[2:45:20] but we don't get it
[2:45:22] that's what it means
[2:45:23] in a dream in there
[2:45:27] so a dream is what
[2:45:33] are you okay now
[2:45:34] did you get a dream now
[2:45:36] it is a vision of the night when deep
[2:45:38] sleep falls upon men in slumbering upon
[2:45:42] the
[2:45:43] then he opened uh
[2:45:47] i touched your ear you were sleeping
[2:45:50] that's a different year remember
[2:45:52] and still if the instruction that he met
[2:45:55] with german from his
[2:45:58] and hide pride from what so god
[2:46:02] sometimes secondly
[2:46:04] uses vision to warn you of something or
[2:46:07] to instruct you or something but he got
[2:46:10] to be checked by the word he got to be
[2:46:12] interpreted by the word
[2:46:15] anybody clear
[2:46:17] but there is a god in heaven that
[2:46:19] reveals secret and maketh known to the
[2:46:22] king nebuchadnezzar remember also
[2:46:24] pharaoh what shall be in the latter's
[2:46:27] day
[2:46:28] that dream
[2:46:30] and the
[2:46:31] vision of that
[2:46:33] upon that
[2:46:36] okay
[2:46:37] are these
[2:46:39] as for dio king that thoughts
[2:46:42] came in their mind
[2:46:45] upon the bed
[2:46:46] what should come to pass
[2:46:49] [Music]
[2:46:50] so when the king went to bed
[2:46:54] to sleep
[2:46:55] he didn't have sleep
[2:46:57] so he jump on his bed
[2:47:00] if he's a christian today he prayed
[2:47:03] and he sat on the bed and begin to think
[2:47:07] and when he begin to meditate
[2:47:11] the theme
[2:47:13] of his meditation
[2:47:16] pull god
[2:47:22] do you hear me
[2:47:23] what he was meditating upon before he
[2:47:27] goes to bed
[2:47:29] that's what attracted god
[2:47:32] and god entered into that meditation
[2:47:36] and took that meditation and pushed it
[2:47:38] down to his heart
[2:47:48] i'm going to stop
[2:47:51] that thought came into their mind upon
[2:47:53] their bed
[2:47:55] because when you awake
[2:47:59] let me finish here
[2:48:00] you are here you are using your brain
[2:48:03] you're walking throughout the day
[2:48:04] walmart everywhere when you go to bed
[2:48:07] you're sitting you begin to meditate on
[2:48:10] something because once you fall asleep
[2:48:12] you live here you jump here
[2:48:14] and you are resting
[2:48:16] so whatever package you're preparing
[2:48:18] here
[2:48:19] is important
[2:48:22] anybody care
[2:48:23] because that package will not drop down
[2:48:29] so when god was passing by he saw the
[2:48:32] king worrying about good stuff
[2:48:35] he said wow he's thinking about good
[2:48:37] things
[2:48:38] okay since he's thinking about good
[2:48:40] things
[2:48:44] [Music]
[2:48:46] amen and he does reveal if the secret
[2:48:50] make it known to thee what shall come to
[2:48:53] water
[2:48:54] that's why it's important to watch you
[2:48:56] meditating
[2:49:00] because the disciples on the wall to
[2:49:04] emmaus were talking about something
[2:49:07] and as they kept talking and talking and
[2:49:10] talking they were creating an atmosphere
[2:49:13] around them
[2:49:15] and when god saw that atmosphere he
[2:49:18] didn't go to the other disciple he went
[2:49:20] to the one that were talking about him
[2:49:23] and god jumped in the
[2:49:24] conversation and when he jump in the
[2:49:27] conversation he start from moses and
[2:49:30] begin to explain to them the bible the
[2:49:33] baba the bible the bible the bible until
[2:49:36] their heart begin to burn
[2:49:42] what are you meditating before you go to
[2:49:44] bed
[2:49:46] what are you meditating throughout the
[2:49:48] day
[2:49:49] what are you talking about we want to
[2:49:51] move from humanistic
[2:49:53] to the revelation
[2:49:55] and move from the revelation
[2:49:57] all the way to the third on a vision
[2:49:59] they disciple by the tongue
[2:50:02] by their tongue because they were
[2:50:05] cornered here that's why jesus said you
[2:50:08] full and slow of what
[2:50:13] right
[2:50:14] but because they were using the tongue
[2:50:17] properly
[2:50:18] everybody clear
[2:50:20] they were using the tongue properly
[2:50:23] god came
[2:50:25] by their tongue
[2:50:26] to remove the slowness of the heart
[2:50:30] until their heart begin to burn
[2:50:34] are you there
[2:50:35] and when
[2:50:37] the pastor wanna close they begin to
[2:50:40] tell him no
[2:50:41] continue
[2:50:44] [Applause]
[2:50:44] [Music]
[2:50:46] because the heart was burning within
[2:50:50] them as they were hearing there
[2:50:53] let's stand there
[2:51:00] [Applause]
[2:51:09] church if i continue here it's gonna
[2:51:11] spill over
[2:51:13] hallelujah
[2:51:15] three domains
[2:51:21] i was trying to get to the tongue how
[2:51:24] you can make the tongue work for you
[2:51:28] but you got to understand where you're
[2:51:30] living either you're a humanistic
[2:51:34] you worry about what politics is saying
[2:51:36] what everybody's doing
[2:51:38] and everything is going on
[2:51:40] around you how the economy is falling
[2:51:43] how many people are doing this and this
[2:51:46] you are in a humanistic level it's going
[2:51:48] to bring you headache
[2:51:50] it's going to give you
[2:51:51] a fear
[2:51:52] it's going to give you uncertainty you
[2:51:54] will be uncertain you will be puzzled up
[2:51:57] you don't know i don't know what is
[2:51:58] going on in this world what are we going
[2:52:00] to do is the rapture coming up because
[2:52:02] you're in a humanistic level
[2:52:05] but if you dig into the revelation
[2:52:08] then everything is peace
[2:52:10] then modern event will be made clear by
[2:52:13] then you begin to rejoice because jesus
[2:52:16] said when you see these things do
[2:52:17] whatever
[2:52:18] because somebody is in a different level
[2:52:21] when people are depressed you are saying
[2:52:23] praise be to god
[2:52:25] let it come let it come let it come so
[2:52:27] we can go quickly let it come so we can
[2:52:29] go quickly
[2:52:31] because you were in a different level
[2:52:36] until you get to the vision
[2:52:39] [Music]
[2:52:40] where we get in the third pool
[2:52:42] into that safe the lord
[2:52:44] when the instruction begin to drop and
[2:52:46] you say it
[2:52:48] i have a quote brother branham say
[2:52:49] somebody will come to you and say my
[2:52:51] crops is dying i don't have rain and you
[2:52:53] say i give you rain
[2:52:58] hallelujah
[2:52:59] that's where we want to be
[2:53:02] amen
[2:53:05] is a prayer request here
[2:53:07] my mom she needs surgery for cervical
[2:53:09] cancer
[2:53:10] i would like prayer for the cancer to
[2:53:13] disappear
[2:53:15] before the surgery can happen
[2:53:18] let's pray together
[2:53:20] because prayer can move us from one
[2:53:22] realm
[2:53:23] until we can believe for our loved one
[2:53:26] and then god can intervene
[2:53:28] heavenly father
