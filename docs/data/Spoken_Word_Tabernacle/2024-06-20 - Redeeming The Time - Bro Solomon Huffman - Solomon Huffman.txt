your Bibles with you we'll go straight into the word of God and I will turn tonight in the Book of Matthew the 25th chapter and also the book of Ephesians and the fth chapter while you turnning there we just greet you tonight in the name of the Lord and always a pleasure to be here on a Wednesday night a midweek service amen I don't know about you all but there's no other place I'd rather be on a Wednesday night than the house of the Lord you know I think it's amazing I think the devil the devil knows we come to church on a Wednesday night amen everything that can go bad normally will go bad on Wednesday amen Amen on the job side seems like you get about everything done that you can get done on a Wednesday and Wednesday goes so good and you got to pull away and come to the house of the Lord but i' I'd rather be here than my job any day wouldn't you amen so we just love the Lord and certainly count of an honor and we appreciate brother shimbo and the invitation to come and certainly respect him and appreciate his stand on the word of God and uh we need men to uphold this message don't we amen and I I know this church believes it and uh so we just appreciate you here tonight my wife's here somewhere probably in the nursery with our child but I'm glad to have her with me and appreciate her making the sacrifice to be here amen amen so may the Lord bless you tonight let's read together here in Matthew uh 25 and we'll begin reading at the 14th verse familiar scripture Jesus teaching this Parable here amen uh Jesus taught a lot of things in a parable yes sir and uh this is a very powerful one that he mentions here the Bible says for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability and straight way took his journey and then he had received the five talents sir went and traded the same and made them other five talents likewise he had received two he also gained other two but he that had received one talent I want you to notice this he that had received one went and died in the earth and hid his Lord's money amen and after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon with with them and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord you gave unto me or thou deliver unto me five talents and behold I have gained beside them five talents more and his lord said unto him well done now good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things yes sir amen notice what the Lord wants us to do thou has been Faithful over a few things yes sir and I will make the ruler over many things see what the Lord's teaching us we've got to learn to be faithful over a little amen ain't that right we got to learn to be faithful over a little before we can a lot that's exactly what the scriptures teaching us here amen the one lost my place here you forgive me already already pulling you make it hard to read the Bible amen praise the Lord I gained two other talents beside them we'll just pick up in the 23rd verse as the Lord said to him well done good and faithful servant let's go down to the 24th and then he which had received the one Talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art an hard man and reaping where thou Hast not sown and Gathering where thou Hast not strawed and I was afraid amen ain't that something I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth Lo there thou Hast that is thine his Lord answered and said to him thou Wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that I reap where I sld and gather where I have not stoed thou ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received my own with ushery yes sir take therefore the talent from him and give it to him which hath 10 talents for everyone that hath shall be given and he that hath abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away that which he hath amen notice what a staggering scripture this is and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth me just a couple verses here in Ephesians 5 and 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is amen we just ask the Lord to bless his word as you can be seated and uh tonight uh if I would take a subject I want to speak to you on redeem the time amen Redeeming the time and amen uh here in the scripture I find it amazing how Jesus would teach so many things in a parable yes sir and you know they would come to Jesus and ask him why do why do you do it this way why do you give us a parable this way but you'll find that there's normally such a very powerful message hidden behind a parable that's right and uh the Lord would many times give us powerful mess messages that are hidden behind the they and they came to him and said why don't you just speak to us plainly and sometimes Jesus would expound upon the pares and I I think this Parable that Jesus is giving is so powerful yes sir uh because he's telling us here that we are we are we are to be stewards with what God gives us and the one man he had a little bit and he went and he doubled it and then this man had some and then he went and he increased everything that uh that this lord gave him and then the other man he just took it and said well I was afraid I'd lose it all so I just went and buried it and and Jesus is giving us this here and and there's just so many Avenues you could approach it at and speak upon but I I think we need to look at the scripture for what it is because all of us will be held responsible for what God gives us and you say well well you know if I had a lot I'd do something with her no you wouldn't if God gave me a lot then I would do something no you wouldn't see amen God can give you a little let me just say this amen God can take a little and make a lot out of it if it's in his hands amen all of us we want to jump from here and jump to here but see God wants us to be amen ruler over a little amen ruler over a little that he could amen exalt us and make us ruler over you say well preacher you know if I had a lot I would be ruler if I had a lot I would do it if I just had the voice to sing or if I had the gift and I had this and I had you wouldn't do nothing with it amen listen friends it don't matter how much God would bless you because you're not using what God gave you amen God wants you to you listen I don't care if you can't carry a tune in a bucket amen use what God gave you I don't care if you're not the best singer in the church use what God gave you I don't care if you're the best preacher in the message just use what God gave you glory to God Amen it's not a competition is that right the house of God ain't a house of competition amen it's a bunch of people using what God gave us I say if you can sing then sing if you can worship then worship if all you can do is lift your hands and lift your hands amen whatever you're able to do amen just do what you can and stop making an excuse for not doing anything in the house God hallelujah redeem the time amen you know there's a testimony I I heard online and different preachers that preached about it but there was a man some some of y'all probably heard it but this man I believe he uh was in a wheelchair or wheelchair rid and he couldn't get up and couldn't walk and and so this man I think either crawled or every how he got down to the Altar and he got down to the Altar and some of y'all know the story got down to the Altar and begin to pray and and that Pastor he he he saw him he said man I want to I I wonder what that man's going to pray about he crawled out of his chair and just got all the way if there was a man that had an excuse to not be there it would have been that man if there was a man that had ex excuse to not be at that altar would have been that man and so the Pastor said well I'm going to get down and hear what he's got to say and that man knelt down and and he was in body and infirm in body and he got down there and he just began to say God you've been so good to me God you've been so good to me and that man thought H how in the world can he come down here and say that here's a man that barely got no legs and he can't walk and he's crippled but yet he's making his way to the altar just to give his part that he has unto the Lord amen listen I don't care how loud you are or how quiet you are you at least ought to be able to say God you've been so good to me preacher you don't know my problems but God has still been so good and well you don't know what God has brought me through but God has still been so good to me amen now if you didn't have breath in your body you might have an excuse but last I checked all of y'all in here tonight has got breath in your life amen you without an excuse Amen to redeem the time and give God what he's worthy of yes my brother glory to God hallelujah I'm telling you friends amen if there was ever a time to redeem the time it is right now yes amen I think sometimes we get the idea that we won't run out of time but I I want to tell you will oh well I got plenty of church services how do you know this ain't the last one I I got a lot of time to get right with the Lord that's exactly what the devil wants you to say well I got a lot of time to get delivered to get set free that's exactly what the devil wants you to say he wants you to think you got all the time in the world but see the bride don't live that way amen we don't live like we got all the time in the world you say how does the bride live we live like he's coming tomorrow morning amen we live like he's coming tomorrow amen I won't even say it that way but we live like he's coming any minute that's exactly right that's exactly right you all know the scripture and brother random would pick up the scripture there in Hebrews 2 and 3 the scripture that says how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by him that heard him amen the Bible tells us here how shall we escape if we neglect how shall we be amen how shall we escape if we neglect listen friends this is not the time to neglect what God has given us no sir no sir amen we're all here to be good Steward with what God has given us amen as the scripture says Redeeming the time for the days of Amen the days are evil listen friends amen if there was ever a time to redeem the time it's right now listen you don't redeem the time early in amen how many of y'all's ever studied for a test take amen a good bit of people amen y'all y'all all know the day before I've studied for amen several tests the day before that test what do you doing I'm normally up at night and I'm getting the books and this book and this book and this book you say what are you you doing you're Redeeming the time because you know you don't oh God Amen you know you don't have a whole lot of time left so you're getting into the textbooks and you're getting into the code books and you're reading and studying and feeding and reading because you know tomorrow's the big day tomorrow is the test day and you're Redeeming the time amen every spare minute you're using it to prepare oh me you're using it to prepare yourself because you know tomorrow is the big day that's exactly right amen you're using your time as a good Steward listen friends we ought to use every single extra minute we got as a good Steward and not be wasteful with what God gives us amen we should never waste our time serving the devil we should never waste our time in a backsliding condition we should never waste our time listen friends there ain't no sense in US wasting time no more amen the prophet told us years ago that the days of play in church are over amen the listen this a't if you want to play church I'm telling you you don't got time to do it amen if you want to just mess around and dly D you don't got time to do it this is not the time to play church this ain't the time to be all religious and and be I'm better than this ain't the time for that this is the time that we be sure we're right with the Lord amen we got everything in a row and everything is just right amen y' y'all know we live in a very a very wasteful Nation right amen they Amen in the us alone we throw away amen thousands and thousands of pounds of food every year we weigh so much amen you go to a restaurant they're throwing away the food when they could give it to the homeless I I ain't getting I'm not trying to get in all that but but this nation is a wasteful Nation amen many nations are wasteful Nation they they waste a lie acting like they won't ever run out amen they won't ever run out and they act that way and listen friends the devil wants you to be the same way the devil wants you to think you've got plenty of time and and you can just waste time and give your time to all the things of the world but I'm telling you you don't have time to do that amen you've got redeem the time that God has given you and be a good Steward with what the Lord has given you amen I'm telling you you you may can waste many things but you should never waste your time amen you may waste a lot of things in life but you should never waste the time that God has given you I I just love the way job says it here in Job 14 sing his days are determined and the number of his months are with thee thou has to point his bounds that he cannot pass that's exactly that's exactly right amen our days are numbered our days are determined so that means we've got a set amount of time on this Earth is that right amen young people old people whatever age you are you've got a set amount of time on this Earth it may end tomorrow it may end next week amen so how about this while you've got time why don't you give it to the Lord and why don't you make all s amen while you've got time why don't you stop being a slave to sin while you've got time why don't you stop being a slave to the devil and tell that devil we're through and tell the devil you're over amen it's exactly the truth amen you you amen people think well you know I I can neglect my walk with the Lord and get by but you can't I I I can neglect my prayer life with the Lord and get by but you can't the prophet said you can't amen here in Hebrews chapter 2 he said it this way he quotes the scripture there in Hebrews how shall we escape if we neglect such he said you neglect to eat you'll die you neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck you neglect to milk the cows she'll dry up you neglect your teeth you'll have to get them pulled out amen the dentist here will say amen amen you neglect your teeth you got to pull them out certainly you pay for your neglection you pay for your neglection amen listen of the Prophet here if you will he said oh brandham Tabernacle and you visitors let me tell you something now you neglect to testify of the glory of God you neglect to give God praise and glory he said you'll find yourself cold you'll find yourself formal and you'll find yourself backsliding the prophet says you give God praise oh Church you neg to give God praise let me tell you amen if you don't want to praise God Amen he's able to raise up the Rocks amen he's able to raise up the Rocks if you neglect to give God praise and give God worship amen youall know they came to Jesus and told Jesus Jesus calm these people down calm these people they're making all kinds of noise and you you you know what the prophet said he said normally where Jesus was was there was a lot of noise normally where Jesus was there was a lot of noise amen he said don't don't calm them down if they don't worship the rocks are crying I I don't know about you but I'm not letting no Rock take my place I'm not letting no Rock take my opportunity I will not neglect to give God because he's been so good to me hallelujah amen you pay for your negligence that's exactly what the prophet said you pay for your negligence amen listen friends redeem the time amen redeem the time amen stop wasting your time to find out an excuse why you don't serve God and why you don't praise God and why you you've done too many things wrong and you made too many mistakes amen let me tell you you're giving yourself excuse after excuse after excuse that's exactly what the devil want well preacher you know I'm just preach if that's okay people say well you know you know I'd come to the house of God but as an excuse I'd come to church but I I I I I'd praise God but amen what are you doing you're wasting time amen how about this amen we make an excuse you can pull any excuse out of your hat to not come to church amen but why don't you tell your job I'm going get in trouble amen why don't you tell your job hey the reason I can't come in today is cuz I got to be at the house of God on a Wednesday night hey the reason I can't come to the family dinner is cuz I got to get to the house of God Amen the the reason I can't come to the birthday party it's CU I got to redeem the time and come to the house of God amen what kind of life would we have if we'd start giving an excuse to the de say devil I I'd love to but I can't why can't cuz I got to come to the house of God hallelujah I love to throw in the towel but I can't because there's a gene seed on the inside I tried to quit but it didn't work I tried to give

tell you what the prophet said he said we're at the evening time ain't that right we're at the evening time we're at the dawning of a new day listen if there was ever a time to give he I just want to slow down and preach to you for a moment personal if there was ever time to give your all to the Lord it is right now amen at the End of the Age you said preacher they've been preaching that for years that the Rapture can be any day and listen let me tell you we're closer today than we were 5 years ago we're closer today than we were 10 years ago y'all know the reason that that the Lord didn't tell us what day right because with this sin nature this we live like a devil up until the day of y'all know it's the truth amen we live any kind of way if we knew when he was coming and then the day before we'd repent and get right that's exactly right this filthy nature wants to act that way that's why he didn't tell us today or the hour because he knows we content with this flesh but listen friends the bride of Christ lives every single day as he could come today what if it ain't tomorrow then I'm looking the next day hallelujah amen it's at the final part of a race right amen y if you've ever studied and Paul here in the Bible and the prophet would talk about marathons and races and stuff like that amen Paul there in the Bible he would get to the end of his life and he would say I've run a good race I fought a good fight amen if you ever study racing just a little bit you'll find out you don't give everything you got at the beginning amen you don't you don't give everything you got at the beginning it's at the very last stretch at the very last stretch you say okay it's ain't time to play games no more this ain't time to quiet down this ain't time to sit down amen this is the time we give it our all listen little bride this is the time we give our all Amen to Jesus Jesus amen we give our all unto him amen at the very end of the race you give everything you got amen listen stop making an excuse every service you come to you ought to come with the attitude I'm giving everything I've got I don't care if I feel like it I don't care if I don't it don't matter how I feel I'm giving everything I got am glory to God hallelujah redeem the time amen redeem the time we ought to redeem the time of this sister anden we should make up for the time we wasted is that okay we should make up to and we should make it up for the time we've wasted the Bible says that redeem the time redeem the time take advantage of the time that you've got amen listen let me just preach here for a moment amen when you was a slave to the devil you said what he said say you did what he said to do you went where he said go and you didn't question nothing with it because you was a slave to the devil amen but now you're a slave to God I think we ought to say what he says say we ought to do what he says do hallelujah amen if he says come to the house of God we go to the house of God that's exactly the truth amen don't you waste a service Hallelujah hallu you may waste a lot of things but don't you waste your opportunity don't you waste your amen don't you miss your day of visitation don't miss your opportunity listen I amen look at that man as Jesus is talking about it he said you I I gave you this I gave you an opportunity to take something and make something

in the Old Testament very very powerful uh Prophet there in the scripture and you know they came to M y'all know the story in the Bible when Jehoshaphat was seeking the prophets and we got 400 and they said he said well do you have one more we got Micaiah but I hate him and you know Micaiah was such a an amazing Prophet here in the Bible because he he he comes and he says I'm only going to say what I hear the Lord say I'm not going to waste my time saying what you want me to say but I I'm Redeeming the time and I'm just going to speak what the Lord says I'm just going to speak what the Lord tells now that's a trueth Prophet it's a true Prophet when he waits on the Lord and hears what the Lord has to say that's who you want to listen to the man that will not tell you what you want to to hear but will tell you what you need to hear that's the man you ought to listen to that ain't always out to make you feel good let me just tell you God is more concerned of your character amen than he is your your comfortability he's not concerned about your comfort he's concerned about your character that's exactly the truth amen any god- calleded minister is not going to just say what he wants to say he he should be lay to the spirit of God and he should speak as the spirit speaks and we should hear as the spirit speaks to us exactly right and listen before something can be spoken we know the prophet taught us it starts out as a thought that's right right it starts out as a thought then you hear that and then you speak it see you're only able to speak it because you've heard it now I got a daughter back here and she she can say mama she can say Dad listen I I never had to sit down and give her a grammar book on how to pronounce mom or I never had to do that but see she heard it so much she heard it so much amen all she couldn't waste no time that's all she hears it's Mama Mama D say she hears it all the time then she starts repeating what she's heard now just be H it took Dad a lot longer than Mama cuz Mama had a greater influence than daddy did cuz she's with her more amen and she learns that because it's all she hears amen now listen let me just say this you can tell what people listens to by how they talk you can tell what people listens to by how they it's the truth Heen you can tell brother I hope it's okay you can tell by the look of on somebody's face what they've been listening to come on Friends amen I've been to many many church services you can tell what somebody's been listening to by the look on their FA but y'all know they they come to the house of God they're sad and complexion they look like they don't want to be there amen they've been listening to the wrong voice amen they've been wasting their time hearing what the devil has to say and they're not listening to what God has to say listen you might deceive your pastor you might deceive your neighbor but you are not deceiving [Applause] God that's exactly right he knows what you listen [Applause] to amen when your traveler gives it away I I've been all over not all over the world but I've been to many countries by the grace of God I mean God putting me there but I flown to Colorado in different places and they'll ask you and they can hear the North Carolina accent they'll say you're not from around here are you it makes you feel real good people say that that you're not from around here are you and I say no ma'am I'm not you're from the Carolina I said yes I am what gave it away the accent how you're talking gave it away it's because all I've ever heard is North Carolinian and it's all I can say because it's all I've heard amen what kind of church would we have if we just said what the prophet said if we just preached what the prophet preached hallelujah amen what kind of life would we live if we only me said what we heard God say listen let me tell you this God will never lead you to downt talk one another God will never lead you to crucify one that ain't the voice of God he God led me to say that no he didn't Hallelujah I just obey the Lord tonight people say well you know the Lord and brother random face it too brother R the lord gave me the dream and the lord gave me this if it don't line up with the word it ain't the lord well God God told me to marry him and God told me to marry her and it crosses every scripture in the Bible God didn't tell you that you told you that and you're trying to put it on God but you ought to put it on you because there what you want not what God wants and you're hearing your mind so much you think you heard God but you didn't it would line up with God's word and I say if it don't line up with the word then throw it out yes my brother pre prach my Hallelujah redeem the time and say devil I'm done amen listen folks people spend so much time trying to make something work if they just move on from it they might get somewhere with God Amen stop trying to cut this manle to fit you and let the manle cut you to fit it Hallelujah that's exactly right amen redeem the time you amen absolutely you you can tell how people how they talk by what they been listening to it's exactly the truth amen listen friends I I believe we ought to get to a point here that we start saying what the prophet said we start preaching what the prophet preached I mean you know you you face some flat for that a little bit you you face a little bit of fight for that because when you stand and start preaching with the prophet priest Heen listen I don't know about y'all but this is a positive message this is an encouraging positive I've never heard a quote or or or or a tape that put me down I've never heard one that belittle me I I've heard of many that rebuke me I've heard heard of many that challenged my faith I've heard of many that cut me brother and sister but I've never heard any that put me down and be little me I never heard it no sir no sir never heard it amen listen friends amen I I believe we ought to get to a point we start preaching what we've been hearing and people say well say how can you stand there and look out across a group of people and and you you stand there and preach to them and tell them they're the sinless virtuous Blood Washed blood amen Blood Bought bride of Christ how can you stand there and tell them they'll do the Greater Works how can you stand and tell them there'll be a repeat of Pentecost because I heard the prophet say it and listen I'm just repeating to you what I already heard I'm not telling you what I think you ought to hear I'm telling you what I've already heard you said brother how can you tell these people they're going to make it because I heard the prophet say that they're going to make it how can you tell them they're going to overcome because I heard the prophet say Amen they're going to overcome amen amen amen how can you stand there and tell them they can do the Greater Works because I heard the prophet say that you say but but but don't you see the problems don't you I mean can can I give you a quote what the prophet said he said Moses looked out the same window Hallelujah Moses looked out the same window that Pharaoh looked out amen Pharaoh looked out and saw a bunch of Misfit saw a bunch of mud saw much your slaves but Moses looked out that same window and he saw the promised children of God am I want to tell you tonight I'm looking out a window tonight and it's the window of the word you say what do you see I see a sinless virtuous woman I see a people as though you ever done it in the first place I see a people that can make it and that will make it yes my brother glory to God hallelujah God I'm not wasting my time telling you what I think about you I'm redeeming time and telling you what God thinks about you that's it I'm not here to waste time I'm here to redeem listen I wouldn't waste my time telling you what I think I ain't wasting in that way I could tell you what I think about you but it won't help you but if I tell you what God says about you amen I'm Redeeming the time and it's something that will help you yes my brother Hallelujah take your time preach how can you say things like that because I heard the prophet saying and I and call me what you want I'm just crazy enough to believe it I listen I know there's problems I know there's issues but I'm crazy enough to believe it I believe if the prophet said it it's going to come to pass listen my soul is resting on this my life is resting on this he said but but but what about this and what about the failures I'm not looking to the failures I'm looking to the promise listen let me tell you this you you ought to not waste another day amen just Ju Just focused on what you think about you appre it for a moment y'all know that came to John and asked him what do you say of yourself y'all know the scripture amen John what do you say about yourself John went where did he go to what the doctor said did John go to what what what's the church down the street say about me what what what's this one say about what's this he wasn't worried about what people was saying about him he wasn't worried about that he said well you know I just got to turn back to the word listen I want tell I don't care what other churches think about you I don't care what the church down the street thinks about you I don't I don't even care what you think about you I'm only concerned about what God thinks about you Hallelujah I'm concerned about what God thinks about you because that's the only thing that matters hallelujah amen John didn't go to his past and his failures and his problem listen I've made mistakes you've made mistakes but that's not who I am and that's not who you are you've made mistakes but your mistakes are not who you are you've had problems but your problems are not who you are you say what am I you're what God says you are yes sir yes my brother amen redeem the time and stop eating out of the devil's trash can that's exactly

goes back to to the word he says I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness that's John who do you say you are I am the voice of one cist amen John did it and then Jesus was standing there in the synagogue right amen Jesus stood there in the synagogue and it was deliver him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and he be to read the scripture sir and he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me he's anointed me to preach yes sir hallelujah amen he's anointed me Amen to bring Deliverance to the captives to bring healing to the bruised he's a Hallelujah he got done reading the scripture and then he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ear he found where the scripture talked about him and he said this is me yes my brother Hallelujah this is me yes sir and y'all know brother talked about that amen that story of the boy he stood up there at a door door had a door had a mirror on it he looked in that mirror and he put his hand and then the boy put his hand he looked in that mirror and straightened up and then then the boy in the mirror straightened up and then come to realization wait a minute that's me that's who I am and listen brother I came to this message amen and I heard what the prophet said and I said wait a minute amen that sounds like me hallelujah amen that sounds like me yes my brother yes my brother take your time amen I I tell you amen I I heard the prophet preach justification and and that flashed over me but I saw it and believed it amen sanctification I saw it and believe listen I want to tell you something tonight amen there's a world out here you can give them this same thing and they don't see anything that you see in it y'all know what I'm talking about you can take the same mirror of the word and you show it to them and they don't see the reflection you say why don't they see it because there's no genan seed attribute and it's not reflecting back it's not reflecting back and they see no representation listen you've got a representation in you and when you hear this message there's a seed in you and there represents itself that I come from God and I go back to God he said preacher I need a quote for that let me give you one Amen brother BR he I can get the quote for you later at the church whenever you want I give it to you he said you feel that tingle in your heart you feel that tingle in your heart as you hear the word you feel that pulsation that tingle he said what is it it's that attribute trying to declare itself it's that attribute trying to declare listen the fact that you can say Amen to this message it is showing that there's an attribute in you and it's declaring itself that you came from God I'm so glad for that Hallelujah I'm so glad when I heard it there was an amen that ringed up out of my soul

they're fighting and and they don't want to make it work PR my brother y'all know what I'm talking about I thought you know take your time take your time these folks that's left and they just fight and fight it war and fight I thought to myself I hope this so I'm not attacking nobody I'm attacking the devil that's if they would have took as much effort and as much time and as much ability in studying this word and liting it through the scripture and seeing what the if they would have took all all of that ability and energy and put it into the relationship with the Lord where would they be but now they're wasting it trying to fight it and this prove it listen I want to tell you now I don't have time to debate the message I don't have time to argue the message I don't have time to prove the me I'm not wasting my time you want to debate it I ain't wasting my time for it you say why ain't you wasting your your time because that's what Eve did that's what the prophet said he said she stopped for one minute she stopped for one what' you say serpent what what what wasting time stop wasting your time amen listen to the critics and the unbelievers and the na they ain't helping you no

Redeeming the time but we're giving it to the things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus amen the Bible said that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God Amen he says see we're not Redeeming the time but we're giving it to this and giving it to this this is not the time to give all of your spare minutes to Amen to uh to entertainment
