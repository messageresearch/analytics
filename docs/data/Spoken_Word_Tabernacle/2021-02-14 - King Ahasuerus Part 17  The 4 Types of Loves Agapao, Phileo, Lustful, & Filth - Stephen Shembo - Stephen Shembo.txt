this week they want to get see there i knew something had to happen we got a bunch of people in here i was thinking about being a contagious christian so far i was talking to my nephew and it looked like god's contagion amen amen praise the lord we need to spread it like wildfire don't we hallelujah praise the lord anybody else got one they want to tell about amen how about a prayer request anybody got anything we want we want to continue to pray for sister lorelle she's not feeling well yet i don't guess i mean i'm sure she's getting better i haven't heard lately during any report any unspoken let's remember unspoken amen brother caleb come on up you can give your testimony and pray over the unspoken requests okay may god bless you since i mean i believe god is good amen i mean i just uh have a little testimony here uh for the glory of the lord um as the church knows i was diagnosed with latent tv and um they did the test of the test you know it kept on coming back negative but there was one major test that i was waiting on it's called the uh cultural results that takes like eight weeks so when i've been back i was still waiting on those results to come back and i think almost two weeks ago they called me up to just check up on me and everything else and um the results came back and it came back again negative and i just want to thank the lord for that i know the dev was not giving up uh but god is not giving up either so and i'm not giving up either so um i'm just thankful for the law because if it came back positive just a lot of headache so i'm just thankful that god is still god you know even even you know with the with the preaching that's coming forward god is i believe you know it's coming straight from the tone of god because it's a time where i i believe god is making that separation you know that you're either in or you're out and if you're in you know 100 you know it's not 50 percent you know 100 so i'm thankful for the word that's coming forth and um it's it's time for us to get out of here you know i'm just thankful to to god about that you know so i and i appreciate all the prayers that you know the church has been praying for me regarding this this disease and and i know by his track we are here amen they just bought a heart and pray gracious lord jesus christ slowly thankful lord to come to your house lord father god lord

than what you receive if you think like you need a new one just see us and we'll make sure you get a new one everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord so since last sunday we gave you the report about the purchase of the church last sunday and you know that we got some work to do so i have been given a report from the trustees can everybody see my board here quick pretty good or we need to move it up move it up brother benjamin come on you need to get the two legs together over there you good okay is it better better there okay because i'm gonna use it a lot and be gracious with me for those that struggle with time amen so just be gracious with me there is a material to lay out down here so i receive the report from the trustees about everything that was given in the church report for tithing report for offering report for building fund we spoke to you last sunday that for building fund we will be laboring more on the building fund but what we had since last year is very little it is less than even five thousand dollars in a building fund when we purchase the church cash and the property cash whatever we have depleted significantly and we got work to do and we need to do some work so i have to tell you about looking and screaming screening onto the report from the trustee some of you are not paying your tax and as a pastor i don't want to wait for minister coming from outside to come and preach about that can you say amen i'm responsible to make sure you are in correct order and you can make it to heaven if i see something wrong in your life i'm not going to compromise with the world i'm going to lay the word as pure as i can to make sure when i faced my maker i don't have anybody's blood in my hand the bible says that if a watchman sees a danger that is coming up from somewhere if he does not warn the city if the people get killed if you need that scripture you see me the blood will be upon the watchmen but if the watchman sees a danger and he warned the people of the city and the people don't take heed to the watchmen the blood is not going to be on me and the blood is going to be on you you say brother stephen you begin to talk about turning brother branham said turning is god's money can you say amen i gave you the scripture brother branham said that he belonged to the pastor can you say amen never told you that if your pastor is a rich man you're not supposed to take time you don't pay tad because the pastor is a poor pastor you don't pay tad because the pastor is a dentist like your partner you pay that because the word of god said you need to pay time amen whether your pastor is a millionaire or not you need to pay your taxes amen and as your pastor i'm gonna make sure at least i speak to you if i uh bastard your bubble it's gonna do you good it is lame trimming time we're going to worship god with our thought with our being with our life with our offering with everything we must be lined up with the word of god if you struggle with turning and you don't know what timing mean if you want to see scripture you see me tithing means that you need to give the 10th unto the lord i'm going to take my time amen if your earning is five hundred dollars if you are sleeping you need to wake up if your earning is five hundred dollars this is what you get from your paycheck you get five hundred dollars i'm gonna do this so you don't have no excuse if your 30 your pay your earning is 500 out of 500. 451st belong to you amen you can buy your house you can pay your car you can eat you can do everything you want to god wants you to enjoy that money the ten percent of five hundred dollars is fifty dollars this fifty dollars is not your money can you say amen the 50 is not your money it is god's money do you hear me brother stephen i usually pay my tax after taxes but stephen i pay my tax before taxes i'm going to help you on both of them as your pastor i'm working and brother branham was working paying tata i do pay my tartan you can talk to your trustee they will tell you everybody clear praise the name of the lord so when i pay my own tax i pay my tax before taxes this is me everybody clear because what belongs to caesar goes to caesar and what belongs to god goes to god i know you want to fight with me because you say i don't touch that but i'm gonna give you the pure word just as it's coming i pay my timing before taxes anybody clear so when i file my taxes and the government gave me a report a a what uh a refund a refund from the taxes i don't owe god a penny do you hear me because i was paying my tax out of everything everybody clear so if you pay your tax before taxes when you get your tax refund you don't owe god nothing ever clear but for those that are still struggling because they are looking at the paycheck and they think when they give god before taxes it's a lot if that's where you are i'm gonna help you like thomas everybody clear when you pay your taxes after your your tax after taxes if you get a refund do you hear me you need to pay taxes tax again out of that refund because it's your increase everybody clear for me i'm going before taxes i'm gonna let god deal with you but if you understand god pretty well if you know the laws of god pretty well you will give your taxes before taxes your tax before taxes and you're going to see what god is going to do to you if you're still struggling that's your problem if you think i'm here for money i'm not here for money amen i'm a pastor over six months now you can talk to the trustees i have never touched one penny off the table i said one penny up to today never the trustees are there brother chin brother mike daly can you say amen you heard them right everybody clear the only thing the trustees insisted they say but stephen you cannot do this you need to at least take at least an offering so that the people can get blessed i say brother branham used to refuse it and brother branham came back he said what he was doing he was robbing the blessings of god from the people so he was supposed to get the offering and so that the people can get blessed because of that scripture because of that cult because of the word i took that offering from the trustees but you're tiring i have never touched your tithing up to today everybody clear so when i'm talking to you about tiring i'm not looking at money i'm just trying to make sure your life goes straight with the lord everybody clear so when you get your paycheck you get uh 10 of it doesn't belong to you you have 450 out of these 450 even though you are using that you need to remember your offering everybody clear offering is not two dollars it is an offering how can you spend a hundred dollars on a suit two hundred dollars on the suit and your offering for the entire year is 50 000 something is wrong sorry you already elected me as a pastor and when you're elected the pastor is for life everybody clear and i'm gonna tell you the truth as pure as i can malachi chapter three even from the day of your father you are gone water away from your um from minoritiness and have not what kept them return unto me and i will return unto you say the lord of hosts but you say wherein shall we water god had a complaint that the people ran away from his word the people ran away from his commandment and they were not keeping his commandment and israel asked the lord how can we return back to you this is the bible everybody clear praise the name of the lord will a man do what how can you rob god how can you rob god praise the name of the lord will a man rob god yet ye have done what rob me but he said wearing have we robbed thee in other words where did we rob you god you know what robbing means anybody clear in water and water so if you are not paying your tax and your offering you have been robbing god you are not robbing me you have been grabbing god you have been a robber a fifa and you are stealing god's money he needs to help you i'm not going to compromise or lower the word of god everybody clear ye are what so when you don't pay your tax when you don't pay your offering right here you are still under the curse i can pray as you want me to the lord will not remove that curse anybody clear that's why you struggle in your finances that's why money goes up goes up goes up and something happened and money's out a kid gets sick you praying the kid does not get healed you get a new car you get a new house and you begin to live tight if they fire you you in trouble because you're not paying your taxes and you're not paying your offering even you who are online who are streaming and you are streaming we give you simple swap you can be at home and pay your turning you can be at home and pay offering you have been swimming for a whole year for six months you don't pay your time you have been robbing god hallelujah praise the name of the lord bring you water are you awake bring you what all the dirt into the water storage that there may be water in my house and prove me it is not me you don't prove the pastor prove me now herewith said the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour out water that they shall not water be room enough to do what take god at his word give your title and when you give your task give your time in first tell god i'm giving my thought because you asked me to do it and remember also your blessing that you promised for me you worked a whole year your wife worked a whole year your taxes 100 something is wrong you want to know how much you made check your w-2 form hallelujah and i will rebuke the water the one that make your kids sick [Music] touch your car every time you're struggling with bills you're struggling with finances all this time money comes money goes money comes money goes at the end of the year you don't even have two thousand dollars in your account amen i will rebuke the devourer for your sake and he will not destroy the fruits if you say no i i have been skipping my turning and it seems like i have been progressing let me give you a scripture because it dropped to me right now the rich young ruler rejected the word of god and when he rejected the word of god he continued to prosper but he went to hell i will rebuke the devourer for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your van cast fruit before the time in the field say who if you are here whole year not paying taxes the attack not paying offering you have been robbing god you are under a curse everybody clear praise the name of the lord brother branham we got to come back to water is everybody okay god has a way to do what to support a church not making blankets or having soup suppers but every water can you say amen every man paying water and what into what every man paying his start and offering into the church doing the way god said do that is what god provided way for that can you say amen you start a business it's not working you're fighting with your business check your tithe check your offering amen taft and offering goes to who which was the if everybody would pay their taxes you would not have to do attitude you would not have to have any soup supper see you adopted something else and leave the water you are coming up with your human reasoning to take care of the word of the church of the living god and you are living god's provided way we live in a country where people are living like parasite they want to suck from the government they don't want to give the government back that's why people get hooked to food stamps they are lying cheating the government they don't want to report their income because they're going to cut their footsteps if you are in this church and you are doing that tomorrow called dss stop the footsteps [Music] you want to suck suck suck suck you in trouble you want us to intervene you don't pay nothing i'm working under the table they're paying you cash even if they pay you cash report be honest people report everything to the state if they cut your footsteps let the state counted [Applause] you now be you're not living for the state you are living for god [Applause] amen you're getting money you don't pay taxes you are hiding your money you don't even pay that amen shame on you the church of i'm i'm a pastor this is not something to laugh if you have a tendency to laugh you guys need to stop taught and offering god's deliver you adopted something else and leave the turning off say it is an old testament argument i'd like for you to prove it to me that's right you can do it by the way by god's word it is a what new testament order two you must pay your tax any offer god makes one order he can never be what he has to remain water say amen praise the name of the lord in the hebrew why would he take that melchizedek why would he ask abraham to pay that that's melchizedek how many knows who's melchizedek he became jesus christ and he asked abraham i need your thought he was the possessor of heaven and earth why does he ask abraham to answer if you're sleeping wake up i'm looking at everybody amen this is not the time to sleep amen you see what they want what a strict thing is to do what so paying that is strict by god timing is what every water if you work you pay your thousand your wife's work she pay her title your child work they pay their taxes every christian is what turning is a duty it's duty bomb to do water that's right never has been what god being misunderstood they asked brother brown a question does a christian not get to heaven because they do not pay taxes i want you to listen i could not say yes or no to that thank you brother branham i thought i would go to hell let me continue but i do believe that what every christian is what you are obligated by god to pay tax and offering obligated to pay tarding because it's what a commandment of who now watch brother branham he said he's not going to say yes or no watch brother branham he quoted the scripture now and blessed is or did that do what or what painter is a commandment that they may what have a right to what into life so if you want to enter into life you need to do it pay your taxes amen now you want to meet jesus in the air this is god's mercy for you you need to correct your life it is lame trimming life now i do believe that that pain is what to air you have a christian experience you don't pay tithing you argue about the message argue about the scripture can't pay your tithing but when you pay turning really where are you all turning is what where you get your water you coming to this church you have been fed spiritually in this church you paying your diet in this church if you online and somebody give you the link because they want you to get a blessing from something we've been ministering here and you have a church somewhere you attend pay your tax there but if you are a believer in this church and you are following streaming consistently in this church and you belong to this church as a member you must pay your tithe to this church bring you all your turning into my storehouse say who i challenge any man or woman that is not a taxpayer to do what if you are not a third player you've been playing with your tat you need to wake up brother steven i messed up with my dad i was not paying my tax last year what should i do can we forget about it and start anew as a pastor i can give you that option but i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna give you the word everybody clear because you want a shortcut leviticus 27 31 and if a man will or want will at all do what ought of what so you need to redeem your tithing can you say amen you wish you were not in church this morning if you need to redeem your thought he shall add death to it the word god gives you a penalty for using his tattoo say amen what are you talking about brother stephen you owe god five hundred dollars from january till december you didn't pay for it i'm talking about your income what is a fifth a fifth is one over five one over five is zero point zero two you can do your math if you take 0.02 you times it with 100 it's gonna give you 20 in other words god tells you if you use my money and you want to correct your life you must pay a late fee of 20 can you say amen in this church the bible says

wanted to talk to the church and to correct it i saw it as a shepherd i can't keep my mouth closed i gotta help you up we are continuing from where we were on wednesday let's go to psalm 51. brother john you didn't sing that song by any chance it was the holy spirit if you if the word of god make you uncomfortable you need to be made uncomfortable the one who doesn't want you to pay tarding is the black dog amen he wants you to use god money to fulfill the lust of the flesh it's the black dog he's the one who wants you to stay on the curse money is coming money is going money is coming money is going we don't know what is happening where is that money going correct you're tired and often psalm 51 if you're there you can say amen verse 2 this is a psalm when dead when nathan the prophet came to david after he has gone into bathsheba in other words after he committed adultery with bathsheba watch me thoroughly from mind iniquity so it's something david knew better if you checked the old testament they told david that's somebody else's wife he didn't want to stop he went and did it amen and cleans me from my sin everybody clear for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against you you only have a sin it doesn't mean david didn't do something wrong to uriah because when you commit adultery you need they need to take you all the way to that person to ask forgiveness by uriah was dead so david have to deal with god anybody clear i want to clear that up against you you only have a sin and done this evil in your sight that you might be justified when you speak and be clear when you judge in other words when you do something wrong acknowledge it before god just be humble don't fight god behold i was shaping water you might be seated and in what did my mother conceive me behold you desire what can you wake up yes thank you hallelujah okay behold you desire truth in what david is saying here that when i was born we already explained it to you our first birth is a mess from the inside black dog everybody there on the ins on the outside black dog anybody clear david said this is the way i'm born born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the world nobody teach you you start lying anybody clear but david says that the purpose of god in my life is that on the what inward part on the inside man anybody following me amen verse six behold you desire what truth which is the word you desire truth in the world god's purpose for your life is that your inside receive truth which is the word of god remember we explain you the process anybody there so god don't want you to stay black black everybody clear amen you desire truth in the inward part and in the hidden part you shall make me known make me to know what wisdom the inside man verse 7 purge me with what his up which is a faith brother branham told us so the purging of the inside is with faith we already explained to you those purge me with his son and i shall be clean wash me by the word and i shall be wider than what so david is crying to be wider than snow because the cries of davida my soul is testing after thee and also my what my flesh everybody clear job to verse 16 hallelujah for you desire not sacrifice else i will give it you delight nothing burn offering the sacrifices of god are what god wants you to acknowledge don't fight god a broken spirit a broken and a controlled spirit of the heart oh god you will not what if you have a heart that is up that is ready to be humble and to receive the word of god god will never receive the god will never reject you everybody clear let's go to psalm chapter 9 119. if you dare you can say amen blessed be the name of the lord psalm 119 verse 9 page is still turning and i'm waiting for you you there blessed be the name of the lord where we now shall a young man cleanse his way in other words how with what can a young man clean his way what can i do to have my life clean anybody clear by taking heed dare to according to what in other words if you want to clean your life the way to clean your life is to listen and to take heed and to accept the word of god if god say hey just do a god say be just do be it's going to clean you up everybody clear let's go to first thessalonians and then we're going to pray first thessalonians chapter three we wear this on wednesday and we're going to touch up and start climbing first thessalonians chapter four actually verse three if you're there you can say amen people i'm waiting in this church you need your bible in this church you need your bible in this church you need your bible in this church you need your bible always bring your bible if you need the quote you tell me first thessalonians 4 verse 3 for this is the water the will of the will of god even your what so the will of god is sanctification god wants you to be holy clean that you should abstain from water fornication we explain to you that that word sometimes is used both ways but the correct way fornication means sexual relationship before marriage i'm gonna talk to you pure and blunt let's go to verse four that every one of you should know how to possess his what his body in what sanctification and what in other words god doesn't want you to use your body for uncleanness we are preparing you to the second banquet of esther amen everybody clear verse five not in the lust of concupiscence even as they're gentle the hidden which no not well in other words we don't want you to live like hidden you are christian you need to live a holy life job to verse 7 for god has no callers unto what but to what so the church of the living god is supposed to be holy god never called you to live an unclean life ever clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing father i would not apologize for anything that has been spoken under inspiration that you gave me to speak this morning if he hurt father may your children understand that love is corrective and they need to straighten their lives lord father give them grace to remove a stubborn spirit to overcome the black dog and may they give you liberty this morning and focus into your word father i rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place that is making people sleep young people sleep father bringing destruction and thinking that it's a jokey time lord we rebuke them away from this place in the name of jesus christ may you be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the ending of this service father bless your children move me completely out of the way may every demonic spirit be sealed out of this place may you and you only be sealed in lord and bless your children in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you good to see you this morning we are continuing with king a hazardous feast uh three fists and esther's to banquet everybody clear we're on part 17. we already talked to you about the three feasts of king ahazaris we talk to you about the first banquet of east of uh esther which as we are progressing with what we are teaching you can begin to see what is coming up on the second banquet everybody clear now from where we left on wednesday we spoke that david was expressing to christ he expressed the cry that he wants his soul to be delivered which is so speak about the inward or the inside man and david also explained that he want also his body to be delivered and we found paul in romans chapter 7 expressed the same thing that in my body i found another law and that law is sin and paul say oh wretched that i am who shall deliver me from this body everybody clear and then we found on wednesday that for the redemption of the soul god give us a grace and that grace brings faith in our heart and that faith cleans the inside man amen but when we look at peter peter explained to us that you need to continue in this faith and wait for another grace a second grace which is the grace that will come at the end at the revelation of jesus christ everybody clear and we explain to you that the capstone as he was coming down he didn't cry grace but the capstone was crying grace grace double grace in other words the message that we receive have a grace to save your soul and the message also also agrees to change your body everybody clear no problem so we get into the indian chief tap which explained that once he got saved he had a black dog and a white dog fighting and brother branham explained to us that the white dog was the holy ghost in tap and the black dog is seen that paul says that it was in the body everybody clear so from that we had three scenarios the first one you are born in sin shape and iniquity on the inside of you you have a black dog on the outside you have a black dog you are living like a hidden you are living like a sinner even if you are born from parents that have the holy ghost even if you are born in the message on the inside of you black dog on the outside black dog because you are born in sin that birth of sin and iniquity is speaking about a birth by sex he took a sex act to conceive you that's the reason why you are born with a perverted nature anybody clear so far then david spoke to us that god preferred that the inside man should receive his word so we told you that when we began when we became christian on where or when we are born again you're outside according to romans 7 remain with a black dog ever clear that's why you are tempted because you are still in the body that's why you are forced into doing certain things because you are still in the body that's why you are growing that's why you get wrinkled that's why you get gray hair normally you should stop at a certain edge and never grow up again but the reason why we are growing up because death is in the body and death has been working trying to destroy the body everybody's saying well understand me whether you go to the hospital tomorrow you get sick they pray for you tomorrow you get sick because you are fighting with the black dog inside your body everybody clear so from moving from your birth to net new birth we explain to you that the holy ghost come with the word of god and the holy ghost claimed the inside man and the holy ghost enter and then see you there everybody clear now on the inside you are pure but your outside is still unclean now the white dog get on inside and automatically you begin to fight with the black dog that's why when israel drank the water from resident the next thing that followed the amalekite attack because somebody received the holy ghost ever clear brother branham in question answered he said dear brother branham will all the sons and daughters of true born again believer be saved brother branham said no brother no the sure won't as a copy david do places on this remark god don't have water grandchildren just water sons and daughters in other words if you are born in the message you still must be born again you must have your own personal experience with god not the experience of your mother not the experience of your father not the experience of your pastor but your own personal relationship between you and jesus christ can you say amen they shall have to be born just exactly like their father and mother was born of the spirit see that's what makes make a new man make a man a new person is because he's what born again he is reborn like jesus taught nicodemus you must be what born again he could never say wait a minute should i go to my mother's womb again and then come back and he said no no no you got to be born of water and of spirit water which is the word everybody clear now his first birth bring him a natural man on earth which is shepherd iniquity his second birth which is the new birth bring him a what spiritual man of heaven see he changed him he's what not his what so brother branham is telling you that when you get born again your soul changes but not your outside not your body anybody clear his of being he senses he still feel and smell and taste and here but he's what where david spoke if you tired you can stand back there i won't mind it he's in his inward part his desire what motivated him has been what changed to god so if your desires are still the same it means you are not born again because paul said that the worshiper once purged has no more what desire for sin everybody clear praise the name of the lord so the black dog staying in your body have a mission his mission is to pull you back to where you came from and the white dog coming into your life is coming also with a mission or an agenda and his agenda is to push you forward towards redemption so one is pushing you back to egypt one is pushing you to the promised land and you are caught in between two opinion everybody clear so far brother branham we grow up each day our heart anger hunger keep moving on there is something growing water we explain to you that when the holy ghost gets into you when you are born again the holy ghost will come you are 100 50 here black 50 here black completely 100 black 50 here 50 here when you are born again your 50 percent here becomes white everybody clear but you have another 50 of you that is still black and as the white dog which is the holy ghost coming to you the only gods will begin to grow you need to feed him with the word as he grows he begins to push the white of the black dog away that's why paul said we die what daily the more you die the more the holy ghost is getting grown into your life brother branham continue there is something going inside of you the white dog amen you get bigger he spread out paul said told the corinthian church you are maturing growing but when you ought to be teachers you are still what babes needing teaching is that right when you ought to be what teacher paul is telling the christian of corinthians that you already have been born again i'm expecting when i come a year or two years later i want to see you on the inside 70 percent i want to see some of you ready percent i want to see some of you 60 but it seems like when i come back you don't grow something is wrong amen something in there growing out pushing out making bigger like i told you the stone of daniel the stone came struck the image destroyed the image but the stone never stopped there the stone began to grow until it filled the whole earth everybody clear he says something in there growing out pushing out making bigger the holy spirit doing what the white dog is growing everybody clear their new birth if a birth is born from the outside from the inside out do you see that the child he grows if he lives if he doesn't he remain is that right well when a birth is on the inside shouldn't it grow in other words when a child is born the baby does not remain baby the baby continued to grow everybody clear if somebody is sleeping beside you shake him a little bit everybody clear amen so when the baby grows if a baby grows if you are born again inside of you god also need to grow you cannot be born again and remain the same if your experience today is not different than your experience five years ago you need to check yourself you need to seek for god you must be able to look back and say that i'm not what i used to be i am not where i'm going because the white dog is pushing me but i know i am progressing somewhere everybody clear he said the christ in your heart or to be doing what growing what not monthly jesus christ in your heart need to grow every day hallelujah getting what more what our what amen as you grow your understanding with god increasing the power of god increases because the white dog is pushing the black dog outside ever clear praise the name of the lord growing bed getting bigger more powerful understanding things better how can you be five years you still have a problem understanding certain things amen you are five years in the message ten years in the message you don't know how to pay taxes amen you need to die to that today and let the white dog take over that territory everybody clear more powerful understanding things better forgiving working on god as god would till christ be forming you the hope of what so as we get born again we don't stop but every day we die and as we die christ is growing christ is growing until you reach a point then one of this day your entire body will be quickened together and you're gonna meet god into the air that won't be the time that the black dog won't be completely out and from the inside and the outside you are purely white dog everybody praise the name of the lord brother branham at the coming of who at the coming of the lord jesus this body is picked from the earth again and made in a water a glorified state to live in what so brother branham is telling us here when jesus christ come we're gonna be taken quicken and going with jesus but remember when jesus christ come amen he must find you where you where your white dog is already under 90 or 97 amen and as a capstone he's coming to get you ever clear so since the black dog still have a territory that he's living in your life what as jesus does when he comes you're following me when jesus comes paragraph 64 then all the what you following me and all the things that was in the world all goes out of what so when jesus the capstone on the second banquet of esther anybody following me when christ is coming are you following me he's going to kick everything that is black dog out you following me goes out of existence flesh goes to it what that sin that have been bothering you will leave you are you following me when the rapture takes place you will see your body getting changed as your body begin to change what's happening is that the black dog is moving out of you are you following me hell open what why does hell open her mouth why does hell open the mouth because the black dog has a resident are you following me his house that was created by god is hell so when jesus christ comes something will shake your body are you there when it begin to shake your body you'll begin to see yourself changing as you are changing hell open the door to receive everything that the devil was doing in your body back flesh goes to its punishment hell open up her mouth and does what swallow what in all the what and what and god and his beloved church his brother take the stand for the water to roll on that is the water of a christian water that's why when the holy spirit gets into your life the holy ghost begin to grow that's why the bible says the spirit inside of you and the bread which you are are saying come because when god comes he kicks the white the the black dog out of you and the black dog goes to its destination from hell and when they judge you they don't see any blackness in you amen when they look at you i thought yesterday you did something wrong where is it they can't find it because hell open and swallow everything that you did and you are completely free that is the stage we are going in everybody clear praise the name of the lord as we are dealing with the black dog let's go ahead and get in now in galatians 2 20 paul says that i am crucified with christ we identify on the sixth year at the cross nevertheless i live yet not who but who that lives with me in other words i am being crucified with christ on the inside man the one living inside of me is not me paul anymore it is christ jesus christ that is living on me under the baptism of the holy ghost everybody following me and the life which i now live in the world in the flesh that still have the black dog the life that i live in the flesh i live by the water which is your victory the faith of the son of god who loved me your valentine and gave himself to what galatians 5 24 and they data christ belong to christ have crucified the word with the affection and what that's the reason why you're purging on the inside remove the desires of sin but yet the black dog is still on your body everybody clear galatians 6 verse 7 be not deceived god is not what for whatsoever amen so ever that shall he also work so you need to know where you're sowing amen everybody here are you sowing to the black dog or are you sowing to the water if you sowing to the black dog you're going to rip the black dog if you are sowing to the white dog you're going to whip the white dog the bible says that for he that soweth to his what the black dog shall also report corruption but he does so if to what the white dog shall of the spirit report so as you give the holy ghost the word of god and you feed the holy ghost in your life the holy ghost will continue to gain more strength and push you all the way to redemption but as you begin to feed the black dog then the hand of moses begin to go down then you begin to lose ground because the black dog is more bigger and it's pulling you back hold again trying to bring you from the same bondage know where you're sowing because whatever you sow you're going to reap whatever you do online you're going to reap it everybody clear let's go to 1st corinthians chapter 3. hallelujah we still good if you dare you can say amen first corinthians chapter three pages still turning verse 16. if you dare you can say amen know ye not that you are what because the holy ghost is in you you are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwell with the white dog is in you paul is saying you know that the white dog dwelling you if the white dog dwell in you you are god's temple everybody clear let's go to 17. if any man do what defile the temple or your body in other words if you defer the temple of god him shall god do what for the temple of god is what which what temple so yeah the temple of god paul is telling you be careful what you do to your body because whatever you do in your body god will punish you because god lives in you in the person of the holy spirit everybody clear so far let's go to chapter six of first corinthians if you dare you can say amen the devil has been fighting but he's losing that's right just give me more volume you should be good when he battle like this he knows he got a punch first corinthians chapter six if you there you can say amen let's go to verse nine know you not that the unrighteous shall what not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither who sexual relationship before marriage no no adultery sexual relationship outside of marriage no gay homosexual no with men can homosexual no don't steal god's money no no no revalues no extortion shall what the kingdom of what so if you doing any of these things if jesus come you're gonna stay everybody clear verse 11 and such were some of you that was your pastor life but you are what so a homosexual can be saved amen but you are what sanctified but you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god everybody clear all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient they are not profitable all things are loveful to me but i will not be brought under the power of any meat for the belly and the belly for meat but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for what young people their body is not for you to have sex before marriage i'm gonna talk to you plan amen your democrats play too much with morality i'm not a republican i'm not a democrat but we're living on the democrat where they play with uncleanness anybody clear the body is not for fornication but for but for who and their lord for the word so this body that the black dog living is not for you to commit fornication i'm going and god has both raised up the lord and will also always raise us up by his own power we know roman 8 says that no you not that your what our what so your body not only is he a temple but your body is a body that god borrow to do certain things are you following me you are members of god shall i then take the members of christ and make them members of what prostitute god forbid what no you not that being which is joined to a harlot a prostitute is what you become one flesh for two for two say he shall be one flesh but he that is joined to the lord is one spirit verse 18 young people flee in other words run away free what every sin that a man does is outside of the world so when you cast somebody it is outside your body when you are lying it is outside your body but when you are committing fornication you actually are bringing uncleanness to your body i'm gonna talk to you plan are you there free fornication everything that man does is outside the body but he that commit fornication since again what so if you are here and you are having sexual relationship before you are married you are actually committing sin against your own body and against god do you follow me brother stephen i don't commit sinner i have not touched any woman what do you do with that pornography i'm gonna get today sooner everybody clear verse 19 what know you not that your body is what he repeated again the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have god and you are not of your own for you are burnt with a work therefore do what in your what and in your word which belongs to who paul is saying glorify god in your body and glorify god in your holy gospel because both the body and the holy ghost belongs to god everybody clear praise the name of the lord i want you to focus here because this is a difficult session are you ready lord give me grace are you ready are you ready what i put here is the crude oil refinery i want you to focus when oil is brought from the ground it is called crude oil anybody following me if you take that oil you put in your engine it's going to destroy your engine everybody follow me if you take that oil you put on your back it destroys your back your bike if you take that oil you put it in the airplane it destroyed the airplane that oh that oil is pure oil it is gas pure it is called crude oil anybody clear that oil need to go to a process are you following me that process is called fractional distillation are you following me when he goes to the process dado is degraded or perverted are you following me into all that on a morphe into something depending on the temperature are you following me when they begin to boil the oil from the ground as they boil some of those oil will give you asphalt which they put on your highway on the road are you following me some of the all we give you lubricant oil which they put in the car everybody there asphalt was in crude oil you follow me lubricant oil was in crude oil when everything was in crude oil it was pure when it gets degraded it gets another name and another application are you following me when they're boiling more he gives you a gasoline for the boat if you take the gasoline for the boat you put it in your car you damage the engine you follow me when that work on that oil it gives you diesel same oil you follow me when they work in that oil it gives you gasoline for the airplane when they work on that oil it gives you the gasoline for the electric or something the more you work the more different type of gasoline you are receiving from one gasoline what are you trying to say i want you to stay awake in the message god hiding himself in simplicity brother branham say now getting in this now there might be chemists sitting here and now i want to say it because there will be chemists listen at it i don't know the formula but i want just to explain it in my own humble way trusting that god will reveal himself in it but branham is taking an example of chemistry but he's trying to draw a message to make you understand something about god everybody clear brother branham said what did acid come from well you say it come from certain things all right say for instance like fumes i have a bachelor degree i know what he meant it's guess mad acid where did fume comes from where well say fume was made by molecule where did molecule come from from adam where did adam come from from electronic he meant election are you there where did they come from cosmic light see you plumb back past finding of chemistry and if it's a substance it's a creation it comes from water so in other words it's a creator that creates a substance and that substance brings cosmic light cosmic lights bring election election being adam adams bring molecule molecule means from spent to what we call love listen to me carefully everybody clear when love starts the pure the crude form of love the pure form of love the original form of love is called agape love is everybody clear we're trying to under to make you understand the black dog now are you there when a gap in love is perverted are you following me when it's degraded down he produced another love that is called feel your love can you say amen do you follow me now when feel your love is degraded again are you following me he will give birth to another love and that love is called restful love can you say amen when lustful love is degraded you follow me he will give love a breath to another love and that love is called filthy love is everybody clear did i lose anybody where do you get this stuff brother stephen in the message hebrew just take the spirit of love that was the great fountain of god because god is love pure and what and adulterated from that come a perverted love can you say amen i'm gonna make you understand the love that you have the love that the black dog catch you in and every single different love i promise you this and i'm doing it then it comes into what [Music] then it comes into what then it comes into other loves loves and love just keep pervading down till it becomes just what but all those things had a what and someday it's a wand right straight back to what it is what everybody gasoline is not crude oil kerosene is not crude oil asphalt is not crude but all came from the crude oil are you there filth is not a guppy love lustful is not a gappy love failure is not a gaping law but is a descending a degrading of agape love are you following me well lust human love passionate love all those love will have to work so the love that you think you are enjoying right now young people in heaven hallelujah brother branham anything that had the beginning has a what it's those things which have no beginning has amen red perfect what agape love can you preach with me after that comes what can you say amen from what agape to what that is the love that you have for your wife if some man would assault her you shoot him his friend out see because he created what it's a perverted love but that is feel your love what it comes from the first then comes water do you see where brother stephen does his stuff last for another man's wife which is talking about adultery already then comes water see it's just become water but all of this kind of love had their water so from pure filial of agape love comes filio from filio comes lustful from last four comes what filthy feel your love is pure and it's perfect feel your love is the love of god feel our love is eternal feel your love is the strongest love that you ever seen feel your love is unadulterated feel your love is the white dog feel your love is corrective feel your love have no sex oh no grind that's why when brother branham entered the sixth dimension when the sister were hugging him brother branham could not feel any sensation because he said nothing entered there but what perfect love are you following me perfect love which is agape perfect love agape love by what new birth he comes thank you my brothers the next love is filio but before i go to filio if you notice here there is no sex gland in agape what is going on i don't want you to say you were not taught is it right for christian men and women to kiss one another greetings just like sister kiss one another they asked brother brown a question young people and you older is it good for a young man to kiss a young woman when they say god bless you no sir no indeed no sir you kiss one woman brother that is who they didn't say that is your woman wife is speaking about the covenant i want you to get that pretty good your wife or your wife so no young men in this church or young sister in this church have the right to kiss one another if you do it and report it i'm gonna deal with you is it right for christian women to kiss one another on greeting no sir no indeed don't you never get that started yes sir no sir keep you keep away from women shine away from them that is what exactly right now they are your sisters they got that the things even got into the pentacles it's called free love and when you get anything like that you stay away from it that's right i don't care how what you are my brother i believe that you are you

do you know what horror is it's a prostitute when somebody goes with you into the hotel and they know you and give you a gift or money they have treated you like a prostitute because they took off our advantage of your body against a reward or against our money that is the definition of prostitution and their contrary is indeed from other women and word them whereas none follow thee to commit warden and in that you give a reward and no reward is given unto thee in other words they give reward to a prostitute deuteronomy 23 18 that shall not bring the higher of what or the price of what this dog means a male prostitute do you follow me if you got money from from your boyfriend are you there you are not engaged to him lawfully he is not your husband don't bring that man in this church do you hear me if you go into a hotel and they give you money because somebody took advantage of you don't bring that man in this church stay with your money out that shall not bring the higher the

in the marriage what is going on brother stephen but it's last its last here do i fell into this category if you look at the word lust over there there is another word last day that's why when you are married you that got married especially the younger one and even the older one you'll find out that when you are married your going out is no longer called fornication it's called adultery anybody here so on the marriage covenant the black dog still attacks you in those two areas of a lustful love amen you are married but adultery the black dog is after you for adultery he want to move you

can give me grace i'm going to stop in this slide are you still awake everybody ready this is the stage of human circle follow me very well when you are born you are consistent you are in your mother's womb when you are born you are a baby you grow up you become a toddler one to three years then preschoolers then primary school boy then you get you know your adolescent teenager then adult and then older person we're dealing with the white uh the black dog everybody follow me from your babyhood all the way to where you are on a primary school you are born in sin shape iniquity coming in the word speaking what lies that's why the black dog is automatically activating you that's why your child lies you say did you pick something and you see him hiding it is the black dog that is doing that are you there but because they are children because they are toddler because they don't know what they are doing the blood of jesus christ is covering them even though they are telling you lies i want you to follow me very well when you are born god sets a record on put a record on you don't make much noise for a little while you know that is the little baby in other words when you are born god put a tip and begin to record your life when you are a baby the record doesn't pick up anything you do whatever you do nothing because of the blood of jesus christ hallelujah until it becomes to accountability then the noise start once you reach 12 years you follow me whatever you begin to do begin to become pick up on the record if you are before 12 and you die you're going straight to heaven because of the blood of jesus christ can you say amen hallelujah he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer to for and then when that life ends that record or tape is took off when you die and in the great big library of god god put it in the library now how are you going to get around that the judgment well because when you get before god he pulls your tip and they play everything you are hiding from your parent you're gonna see it yourself before god you follow me it's played right back in front of you every move you made in that hotel god will play it in front of everybody every thought that went through your mind because adultery start here it's gonna be played before god do you follow me can you see that now you can see where god anybody following me hallelujah all right let me see where i was okay praise god i shall say this by the authority of god word every baby that is that is under the age of what does goes to what yes sir christ died to take away the sin of the world and when you come to the edge of accountability we are all born in sin when we die he take away the sin and when you come to the age of incontability then you are responsible from then on so when you are 12 years old 13 years old automatically you must repent for everything you do and you must seek the holy ghost everybody following me you are not responsible for something you did not do christ don't die to save you to take away the sin that adam calls but when you sin you have to confess your sin first you have to confess it but the baby done nothing it is not accountable for what he does and christ died for that free baby to free that baby it's born of it is born of a parent drunker whatever they might be that baby goes to heaven i believe it i believe he shall come to recognition of the cross when he gets there to know that christ died for it everybody clear praise the name of the lord as you are still a baby and you are doing things that is wrong there is an area in your life that the black dog is restricted are you following me that area is your sex gland amen are you there so when you are a boy you are a child you can come all the way to here everybody clear your glands are turned off the black dog have no right to touch your gland he can just make you lie to daddy run away and hide get angry and stomp your feet the blood of christ is still covering you but the black dog is restricted from your sex that's why you can take a child kiss all you want he doesn't care matter of fact when he get to mommy he start kissing mommy he doesn't even know what he's doing there is nothing it's turned off are you following me that will happen also when you get older they're gonna turn you off again i'm gonna get there are you following me now brother stephen my child is restricted by the black dog but he's still doing something wrong what can i do for them leave him don't correct them brother branham and you know the first thing you know he's got a habit and you shall find in your children they shall lie to you that is a lying spirit on that baby there is only what one remedy for it the god sticking is not my dear you know the ramrod

of the old gun the hickory stick you know all the muzzleloaders that is not the idea but what cast that evil devil away from that child that's right prayer does it that's your remedy if little malta starts stamping her little foot and running out and turning her through the nose you know you could beat her till she didn't have any clothes on she would do it what the black dog do you follow me the christian life is not for you to fight i'm giving you your remedy but you just lay before god and claim that childhood because he's born in sin he can't help the black dog took advantage of him do you follow me claim that child soul for god just stay right there with it i believe it it is the best thing that i know of yes sir that is the best remedy of it is what only pray for that child speak to

heart to worry people we just want to find a point where we can stop so that they can at least leave the church having something that they can grasp on to chew throughout the week before we come back again and continue where we left off lord you have unveiled many things this morning to your children some of them might think that it's heavy and probably they need to go back to this sermon and go slowly to try to catch and to get what they're missing lord it's with full love that we are doing everything we can to deliver your word lord we are not mad at them i was on friday till four am in the morning my children sleeping my wife's sleeping i was the one up working on this sermon i was sad today till whatever time i woke up and start again trying to glean what you were giving me and put that here sometime i thought i'm finished and you come you give me another scripture and i quit pudding sometime i say it's done i believe i'm guarded for sunday and before you know it you drop it lord this time is a sacrifice willfully and joyfully from me that the holy spirit is getting just because you're wanting to help your children we have dedicated our life our strength our being everything to help the children father may they understand and may they appreciate what you're trying to do to bring all this understanding because the scripture says that you shall know the truth and
