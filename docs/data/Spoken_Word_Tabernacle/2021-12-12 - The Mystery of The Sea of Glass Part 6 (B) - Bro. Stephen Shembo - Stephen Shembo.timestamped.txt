[0:00] the jews
[0:01] through water
[0:02] preach before the gospel unto abraham
[0:06] abraham himself was a hidden
[0:10] amen
[0:14] god didn't preach the promise to isaac
[0:18] [Applause]
[0:20] that's why paul said abraham the father
[0:23] of us all
[0:25] right
[0:26] here
[0:27] he said
[0:28] and unto abraham saying indeed
[0:32] shall all water
[0:34] not only israel nation plural be water
[0:37] this is the gospel god preached to
[0:39] abraham
[0:42] that's the sermon god gave abraham
[0:46] he preached the gospel which gospel
[0:48] indeed shall all nation be saved that's
[0:51] the gospel
[0:53] amen
[0:54] hallelujah
[0:55] so then
[0:57] they which be of faith
[0:59] are blessed with faithful abraham
[1:03] you hear me
[1:04] now to abraham and his seed
[1:08] singular
[1:09] where the promises made
[1:12] he says not
[1:14] and to seeds
[1:16] as of many but as of water
[1:20] and to that seed which is who
[1:27] so these children are crushed
[1:35] everybody here
[1:38] this christ here is one person
[1:42] but he is not one person
[1:46] [Applause]
[1:50] do you hear me
[1:52] do you hear me i'm going slowly this
[1:55] christ is one person
[1:57] but he is not one person
[2:00] amen
[2:01] you hear me
[2:03] because when adam was created
[2:07] we saw adam alone walking on the earth
[2:12] ever here but adam was not alone
[2:15] [Music]
[2:27] [Music]
[2:34] he was adam who called eve eve
[2:38] god never called eve eve
[2:41] when god saw if he said adam
[2:44] [Applause]
[2:48] here before adam was created in the
[2:52] flesh
[2:52] i had adam was already doubled in the
[2:56] spirit
[2:59] everybody here
[3:01] the bible said let us create men one man
[3:05] but when they created that man that man
[3:08] was double
[3:11] anybody here
[3:12] ever here
[3:14] and when god saw that adam was the lord
[3:17] god put adam to sleep
[3:21] here
[3:22] and opened the side of adam
[3:25] and pulled another individual from adam
[3:28] here and created
[3:32] eve was not another creation
[3:35] it was a part of adam
[3:42] everybody
[3:43] so when christ also came
[3:46] on the cross of calvary they pierced
[3:49] jesus christ on the side
[3:51] bringing water and blood
[3:54] showing that somebody is getting
[3:58] both ever here
[4:01] so this seed is one person but it's not
[4:04] one person
[4:06] it's a person with his wife
[4:09] [Applause]
[4:14] hallelujah
[4:16] hallelujah
[4:18] let's see what brother branham says here
[4:20] brother branham said notice
[4:22] the first was by a bound woman
[4:25] didn't look anything like the promise
[4:27] that's ishmael
[4:29] god say
[4:31] god don't have to take back his word for
[4:33] nobody
[4:34] god say how he would come and that is
[4:37] the way you shall come
[4:39] god said through sarah through sarah
[4:41] sarah anticipated and tried to bring it
[4:43] another way he brought the trouble
[4:46] but sarah being a representative of the
[4:49] church
[4:50] top of the church
[4:51] it she found out there that she said
[4:54] well i believe this is a little too
[4:56] phenomenal i just can't even believe in
[4:59] that so you can so you go get haga and
[5:02] you take her for a wife see there that
[5:05] stock didn't look like the promise
[5:08] at all
[5:09] but when sarah came forth
[5:12] now that looked pretty good
[5:15] it looks a whole lot more like the
[5:17] promised day
[5:20] but still it was not the genuine promise
[5:26] did you hear that
[5:27] when we look at ismail we quickly
[5:30] disqualify him
[5:33] when we look at the children of keturah
[5:36] we quickly
[5:37] them
[5:38] but when we look at isaac this is where
[5:41] we have trouble
[5:42] because isaac god already promised a
[5:45] child to isaac and we have a tendency to
[5:47] think that isaac was the promising
[5:51] and brother branham said genuinely he
[5:53] was not
[5:56] ever here because we show you on
[5:58] wednesday
[6:00] ever here that one god when told abraham
[6:04] go take isaac
[6:06] and take him to the mountain and go
[6:09] ahead and sacrifice isaac isaac was
[6:12] never sacrified
[6:15] [Applause]
[6:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[6:19] brother branham why
[6:20] but still he was not the genuine promise
[6:24] why because israel in who
[6:29] fell and denied the water
[6:32] that's why jesus said you are of your
[6:34] father the devil
[6:36] [Music]
[6:38] because if he was in isaac all the jews
[6:40] should recognize jesus christ
[6:42] but not all the jews accepted jesus
[6:45] christ
[6:46] amen and matter of fact the jews were
[6:48] the one that crucified jesus
[6:51] everybody here
[6:53] brother branham continued he said in
[6:55] isaac fell and denied the genuine seed
[6:58] when he come on
[7:00] hallelujah don't get excited don't run
[7:03] that won't hurt you
[7:04] everybody
[7:06] deny the seed indeed what
[7:09] and hung him on the water brother bonham
[7:12] is saying if isaac was the true seed the
[7:16] children of isaac should not crucify the
[7:19] messiah
[7:20] but the children of isaac crucified the
[7:23] messiah showing that even isaac is
[7:26] disqualified
[7:27] [Music]
[7:31] are we okay that's why when god told
[7:34] abraham take isaac and go sacrifice him
[7:38] when abraham was to the point to kill us
[7:40] a god stop him
[7:42] he said that is not the promise
[7:46] everybody here and god created the
[7:49] promise in type
[7:51] [Music]
[7:53] here
[7:54] he created a realm
[8:00] [Applause]
[8:03] [Music]
[8:09] was not born by sex
[8:13] showing that the messiah will not be
[8:16] born by sex
[8:18] [Applause]
[8:21] here
[8:22] that realm have no father no mother
[8:26] [Music]
[8:27] [Applause]
[8:38] and god didn't create a lamb
[8:47] amen a ramen is a lamb but i have horner
[8:53] [Applause]
[8:54] you hear me
[8:55] it's a mature lamb
[8:59] that's why the bible says jesus christ
[9:02] was a man child
[9:05] it's a baby but that baby is a man
[9:10] [Applause]
[9:12] do you know the scripture
[9:14] the bible says a man child
[9:16] it's a child but it's a man
[9:28] was speaking about the zodiac
[9:32] [Music]
[9:33] which was demonstrating that he will be
[9:36] born in a prayer
[9:40] [Applause]
[9:46] [Music]
[9:50] was born like all lamb sir
[9:53] he was born in water
[9:56] and he had to be born under there
[9:59] because he was ill
[10:01] and women were
[10:02] water he was born under that realm
[10:07] that is what he was he was god's realm
[10:10] that was him up there that took water
[10:14] [Applause]
[10:21] hallelujah
[10:23] are we okay
[10:24] are we okay it could not have been crash
[10:28] birthdays
[10:29] not this crazy christmas it just
[10:32] absolutely could not happen
[10:34] he had to be born in macho april because
[10:38] the zodiac overlapped
[10:42] because he was dilemma and he was a male
[10:45] sheep and he was born under the ram what
[10:52] ever here
[10:53] so by creating a realm god was also
[10:57] telling you that he won't be born in
[10:59] april
[10:59] [Music]
[11:04] hallelujah
[11:05] he had to be
[11:07] and sheep are not born in december
[11:09] sheep are born in the spring
[11:12] and then another thing the heels of
[11:14] judea now they are 20 feet of snow now
[11:17] how could the shepherd have been out
[11:18] there
[11:21] ever here
[11:22] so that realm was speaking of christ
[11:26] the only thing that happened to the ram
[11:28] they have to hold him by the horn
[11:32] they have to block his power
[11:34] because what about them say horn
[11:36] represented power they have to block his
[11:39] power
[11:40] [Music]
[11:41] my father my father
[11:44] why have that
[11:48] ever here i'm trying to fight
[11:51] but i can't fight because you took the
[11:54] pillar fire out of me
[11:56] you block me by the horn
[11:58] now i must be killed because you block
[12:02] me by the horn
[12:08] [Music]
[12:11] hallelujah
[12:12] hallelujah so that promised son
[12:15] disqualify isaac
[12:19] now we know who the promised seed is
[12:21] amen
[12:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[12:25] the children of the promised promised
[12:27] water
[12:30] what kind of a promise
[12:32] that god
[12:33] promised before the water
[12:37] he called them not him
[12:47] he called them
[12:49] that's the seed
[12:51] not because you quit doing this and quit
[12:54] doing that and quit lying and quit sleep
[12:58] stealing that is just more a lot a good
[13:01] citizen will do that you can't call
[13:03] yourself a christian yet
[13:05] until something has happened where
[13:08] until you are regenerated
[13:11] something that happened in here
[13:16] everybody here
[13:17] everybody
[13:19] that's why when he met abraham he gave
[13:23] him bread and wine
[13:26] america after the battle he's over now
[13:29] kissing himself his victorious child
[13:32] think of that part of himself
[13:36] here in tap here is in view the
[13:39] communion after the battle he gave of
[13:43] himself because the communion is part of
[13:46] water
[13:49] everybody here
[13:52] so melchizedek by bringing communion
[13:56] he's a priesthood that impart
[14:01] his life into the one that believed on
[14:04] him amen
[14:05] amen
[14:06] amen did you hear me
[14:08] did you hear me
[14:10] let me start it again
[14:12] everybody
[14:13] we're trying to find who is the priest
[14:16] because we're trying to find who is the
[14:17] high priest
[14:19] here but we found out this melchizedek
[14:22] by bringing bread and wine he's bringing
[14:25] a part of himself and putting into a
[14:27] human being he did it with abraham in
[14:30] types of bread and wine which is
[14:33] communion
[14:37] hallelujah
[14:38] i read this on wednesday so let's get to
[14:40] this
[14:41] in psalm
[14:43] chapter 85
[14:45] remember
[14:46] he is the king of water
[14:49] selem and the king of water
[14:52] two kings
[14:54] here
[14:55] in psalm 85 verse 10 the bible says
[14:58] mercy
[15:00] and truth are met together
[15:02] [Music]
[15:04] anybody here
[15:06] righteousness and water
[15:10] melchizedek is king of righteousness
[15:14] and melchizedek is king of peace
[15:20] i'm reading to you the scripture
[15:23] everybody here
[15:24] so righteousness and peace did what
[15:28] in melchizedek
[15:30] [Music]
[15:36] when he comes to you
[15:38] he bring two things together
[15:46] before he even gives you communion
[15:49] his first king of righteousness
[15:53] and second king of peace
[15:55] then after that he produced the
[15:57] communion
[15:59] amen
[16:01] [Music]
[16:07] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[16:10] other in melchizedek
[16:12] let's go to isaiah 32
[16:16] my god
[16:18] verse one
[16:19] you should be there already because i
[16:21] told you to open your scripture there
[16:24] verse one
[16:25] behold
[16:27] a king
[16:28] shall reign in water
[16:30] who's that king of righteousness
[16:34] hey
[16:36] and princes shall rule in judgment
[16:39] verse two
[16:41] and a man
[16:43] shall be a water
[16:46] so when do you say hiding place it's not
[16:48] a place now it is a man
[16:51] remember charlotte was a place
[16:54] but shallow became a man
[16:57] anybody here
[16:59] are we okay now a hiding place is not a
[17:02] place naturally but he becomes a man
[17:05] so if you enter in the man
[17:08] you are lost from the radar
[17:11] the gps of the devil is lost
[17:16] here
[17:17] he said a man shall be a hiding place
[17:20] from the wind
[17:22] and a covered or a shelter
[17:25] from the tempest
[17:27] as rivers of water
[17:30] ever here in a dry water
[17:33] so that man is reverse of water
[17:36] he is a shelter
[17:38] he is your protection
[17:42] ever here
[17:44] and as a shadow
[17:46] of a great rock because he's himself a
[17:49] rock
[17:50] in a weary land
[17:52] so when this man comes
[17:54] it depends on your situation
[17:57] you're in a weary land he knows how to
[17:59] handle that
[18:01] you are in trouble he knows
[18:03] you need protection he knows
[18:05] this king of righteousness
[18:08] america
[18:10] job two verse
[18:12] three and the eyes of them
[18:14] that see shall not be watered
[18:18] and the ear of them that he shall
[18:21] hearken
[18:22] the heart of the rush
[18:25] shall understand knowledge
[18:27] and the tongue of the stemmer shall be
[18:30] ready to speak plainly
[18:32] so when this king comes to you
[18:34] he's bringing healing with him
[18:38] do you follow me because
[18:41] malachi 4 say that the son of
[18:44] righteousness
[18:46] will rise up
[18:47] with healing in his wings
[18:51] so when you meet him like that
[18:54] he have a healing
[18:58] are we okay
[18:59] i want you to stay awake
[19:02] and you get this
[19:05] let's go to verse 15 now it's on the
[19:07] board if you don't want to turn up
[19:08] because some of you don't want to look
[19:09] at it
[19:13] yeah when i say turn to your bible i see
[19:15] some people looking at me
[19:19] verse 15 everybody here
[19:22] watch now
[19:24] until the water
[19:27] until the spirit be watered
[19:30] on us from where
[19:33] until the baptism of the holy spirit is
[19:37] come
[19:40] did you follow me
[19:42] until the spirit be poured upon us from
[19:45] on high
[19:47] and the water
[19:52] hallelujah
[19:54] let me get this one
[19:59] we found two places here
[20:02] there is a place that is a wilderness
[20:06] everybody
[20:08] wilderness
[20:10] that's number one
[20:11] and there is a second place the bible
[20:14] says then their wilderness
[20:17] be a fruitful
[20:19] and the fruitful field
[20:22] be counted for a forest
[20:25] there is two places
[20:27] one is a wilderness
[20:29] one is a fruitful place
[20:32] here
[20:33] follow me very carefully anybody care
[20:38] when
[20:39] the spirit is poured down
[20:43] on a place
[20:44] remember place is a person
[20:47] you got it now
[20:48] you got it now when a spirit is poured
[20:51] down in a place
[20:53] depending on the condition of that place
[20:58] are we okay
[20:59] if the place is the wilderness
[21:02] the coming down of the spirit on that
[21:06] place
[21:07] will turn that place into water
[21:11] a fruitful field
[21:13] everybody here
[21:15] this fruitful field
[21:17] is a fruitful field
[21:20] created by the spirit
[21:24] it was not there before
[21:26] anybody care
[21:27] about here
[21:28] and if the spirit comes
[21:31] and found a fruitful field
[21:34] without the spirit
[21:38] [Music]
[21:39] do you hear me
[21:40] you hear me
[21:43] when he comes on that place
[21:46] what was
[21:48] look like a fruitful field
[21:51] would be water
[21:53] won't be canted not will be a forest
[21:57] but would be counted as a forest
[22:01] let me read it slowly
[22:03] [Music]
[22:05] well wilderness
[22:06] be a fruitful field this is a
[22:08] transformation from wilderness into a
[22:11] fruitful field
[22:12] here but the fruitful place
[22:15] filled
[22:16] will be counted as
[22:19] so when you look at what you thought
[22:22] was a fruitful place
[22:24] before the coming of the spirit
[22:27] it will look like a forest
[22:30] a place where wild things can
[22:33] grow
[22:36] did you hear me
[22:37] did i lose anybody if i lost you raise
[22:40] your hand
[22:40] [Music]

[22:46] so when
[22:48] the spirit comes in your life
[22:51] everybody here
[22:53] you have strong part
[22:58] and weaknesses
[23:00] back here
[23:02] the coming down of the spirit on you
[23:06] will make your weakness turn into a
[23:09] fruitful place
[23:09] [Music]
[23:11] did you hear me
[23:13] and the coming down of that spirit
[23:16] will make what you taught
[23:18] as it was fruitful
[23:21] look foolish

[25:06] paul is telling them i was just like you
[25:09] but if you are zealous toward god

[26:20] god that i'm standing for the law i'm
[26:22] fighting for the law and i'm going to
[26:24] kill all the heretics
[26:27] a fruitful field
[26:29] before the coming of the spirit
[26:33] anybody here
[26:34] jump to verse 12
[26:36] and one ananias a development according
[26:40] to the law having a good report of all
[26:42] the jews which dwell there
[26:44] came to me and stood and said to me
[26:47] brother so
[26:48] receive your sight
[26:51] and the same hour i look up
[26:55] i'll look up upon him in other words my
[26:57] eyes open
[26:59] everybody
[27:00] verse 14. and he said
[27:03] the god
[27:04] of our father has chosen you
[27:08] that you should know his will
[27:11] and see that just one
[27:14] and should hear the voice of his mouth
[27:18] everybody for you shall be a witness
[27:23] here to all men of what you have seen
[27:27] and do whatever
[27:29] a man that persecuted when christ came
[27:33] he's changing into a powerful witness
[27:36] for god
[27:38] until the spirit come
[27:41] if he doesn't come the wilderness remain
[27:44] like wilderness
[27:46] and the fruitful will continue to be
[27:48] fruitful but when he comes
[27:50] the wilderness change
[27:53] and what you talk fruitful
[27:55] becomes something else
[27:57] relax
[28:00] go to first timothy chapter 1
[28:02] [Music]
[28:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[28:06] because you need to understand the power
[28:08] of melchizedek
[28:11] melchizedek is not just a thought
[28:14] just talking about melchizedek
[28:16] melchizedek is a lot of stuff
[28:20] here
[28:21] first timothy chapter 1 verse 12. if you
[28:23] dare you can say amen
[28:25] bear with me we still have time so relax
[28:28] sometimes you drive into this kind of
[28:30] stuff you feel like it's eternity
[28:33] and when you come up oh i thought we
[28:34] went too far yeah yeah
[28:38] all right verse 12. you're there
[28:41] and i thank christ jesus our lord
[28:44] who has enabled me
[28:46] for that he counted me how
[28:49] oh i thought paul was faithful failed
[28:54] now he's counted as
[28:57] faithful putting me into the
[29:00] ministry watch verse 30 13.
[29:03] who was before a what
[29:10] i thought over there he was zealous for
[29:12] god
[29:13] now we begin to see the wilderness
[29:16] we begin to see the wilderness
[29:19] what he showed us there was the faithful
[29:21] field
[29:22] now we are looking at the wilderness of
[29:24] paul i was a blasphemer
[29:27] and a persecutor and a walter
[29:31] oh i thought paul was zealous for god
[29:34] this is the wilderness
[29:36] angels
[29:37] but i obtain mercy because i did it
[29:41] ignorantly in water
[29:44] if he was in unbelief he was his sin
[29:51] he was a sinner
[29:53] yet a religious sinner
[29:57] a sinner that knows the scripture
[30:02] if i preach this in the message
[30:09] a sinner in the message they know the
[30:11] message but they are sinner
[30:15] they even preach the message but they
[30:17] are sinners
[30:21] they don't have the revelation of the
[30:23] message they are preaching
[30:28] [Music]
[30:31] that's why you see their life it shock
[30:33] you i thought he was a preacher he's the
[30:35] one acting like this
[30:38] ever here verse 14 and the grace of our
[30:41] lord was exceeding
[30:44] abundant with faith and love which is in
[30:47] christ
[30:48] everybody
[30:50] which is in christ jesus this is a
[30:53] faithful saying and worthy of our
[30:55] acceptation that christ jesus came into
[30:58] the world to save sinners
[31:01] of
[31:02] water i am water oh my god
[31:06] so paul now is saying
[31:09] i was not religious
[31:11] i was a sinner
[31:14] and i was not even a sinner i was the
[31:17] top of the sinner
[31:20] a man that just bragged
[31:23] that he was under the feet of gamaliel
[31:26] he grew up under ministry in the message
[31:30] see them
[31:32] look at the acting
[31:34] singer
[31:35] still battling prejudice backbiting all
[31:39] this kind of stuff
[31:41] [Music]
[31:48] [Music]
[31:51] however verse 16
[31:53] for this course i obtain mercy
[31:56] that in me first
[31:59] jesus christ must show forth our long
[32:02] suffering
[32:04] for a pattern to them which should hear
[32:07] after belief on him to everlasting life
[32:09] now i become an example of a religious
[32:12] sinner that when i see others they can
[32:15] begin to learn from me
[32:18] that being in the church doesn't mean
[32:20] you're a christian
[32:25] anybody here
[32:26] verse 17 now to the king eterna
[32:31] without father or mother
[32:34] immortal

[32:41] deity

[38:31] loss of water
[38:33] and i do cut them back water
[38:39] their fruitful faith

[41:36] let's dig on melchizedek
[41:40] you ready
[41:41] i'm still good on top for those who
[41:44] worry
[41:45] about here
[41:47] now one melchizedek
[41:49] the king of selem the priest of the most
[41:52] high the king of peace
[41:55] which was none other than the water
[42:00] of the lord who
[42:02] when they say fall part
[42:05] it's the first step
[42:08] into something
[42:10] in other words
[42:13] from god
[42:16] everybody
[42:18] to jesus
[42:19] [Music]
[42:20] you hear me
[42:22] there is a step here
[42:25] did you hear me
[42:27] number one is god the invisible nobody
[42:30] can see god god is a spirit
[42:33] here
[42:34] number three the only begotten who was
[42:36] in the bosom of the father have declared
[42:39] him now philip when you see me you see
[42:41] who
[42:42] you see god me and my father are
[42:46] but in between the flesh of god
[42:49] and the spirit of god there is a step
[42:52] here
[42:53] that was a mystery
[42:55] in the beginning was there
[42:58] and the word was with
[43:00] and the word was
[43:02] and the word dwell among us we was made
[43:06] flesh
[43:07] so the step that missed here is the step
[43:10] of the world
[43:12] which is the fall part
[43:16] this is where melchizedek lies
[43:22] it is god immortal into the world
[43:26] before he becomes flesh
[43:31] are we okay
[43:36] my god
[43:37] when jesus was manifested in the old
[43:41] testament in a water
[43:44] in a person of water
[43:47] not a priesthood but the person
[43:50] the man for this man yet not been born
[43:54] the man jesus
[43:55] but he was in a theophany
[43:58] so he had no father
[44:01] no mother he was god himself
[44:06] he was manifested in the form of man
[44:09] called king of selem which is king of
[44:13] peace and king of righteousness see he
[44:16] was melchizedek he had neither father
[44:20] nor mother beginning of days or ending
[44:22] of life it was jesus in heaven
[44:30] everybody here
[44:32] god left jesus left here and enter here
[44:36] then he became here me and you did one
[44:39] tree
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] and we left our number two
[44:49] ever care so far
[44:51] if therefore
[44:53] perfection were by the levitical
[44:55] priesthood for under it the people
[44:58] received the law
[44:59] what father need was there that another
[45:02] priest should rise after the order of
[45:03] melchizedek and not be called after the
[45:06] order of aaron why do we need another
[45:08] priest if we already got perfection but
[45:10] we know the law can bring nothing to
[45:12] perfection
[45:14] for the priesthood being changed there
[45:17] is made of necessity exchanges of the
[45:20] law
[45:21] for he of whom these things are spoken
[45:24] keep this in mind pretend to another
[45:27] tribe in which no man gave attendance to
[45:30] the altar for it is evident that our
[45:34] lord sprung out of judah of which tribe
[45:38] moses spoke nothing concerning
[45:41] priesthood
[45:43] he was sealed
[45:44] [Music]
[45:46] here
[45:47] the first true king of israel was david
[45:51] because saul came by the wheel of the
[45:54] people he was not the will of god and
[45:57] saul was from the tribe of benjamin not
[45:59] judah the kings must come by judah ever
[46:02] here
[46:04] and when david came he began to do stuff
[46:06] like a priest
[46:09] [Applause]
[46:11] anybody here
[46:13] hallelujah it is yet far more evident
[46:16] that after the simulated remember on
[46:19] wednesday of melchizedek there are
[46:22] another priest
[46:25] who lived forever
[46:26] what are you trying to say
[46:29] hallelujah
[46:31] get it now amen
[46:33] listen carefully
[46:34] verse verse 23 and they
[46:38] surely were many priests
[46:40] because they were not soft they were not
[46:43] suffered to continue by reason of water
[46:47] in the levitical pursuit
[46:50] we have so many priests
[46:52] the reason why they have many priests
[46:55] because of death
[46:57] because a priest will grow and die so
[46:59] they gotta renew him and he died and
[47:01] they got to put another one but mercy
[47:04] said that he doesn't die
[47:06] [Music]
[47:08] about
[47:10] in other words the levitical priesthood
[47:13] had replacement because of death
[47:17] but melchizedek priesthood
[47:20] have a power of endless life
[47:23] it's a priesthood that doesn't die
[47:26] so it's a priesthood that you cannot
[47:29] replace
[47:31] so if it's a priesthood that you cannot
[47:34] replace
[47:35] and it started with a preached cow milk
[47:38] is a deck
[47:40] so they never change any priest
[47:43] because the changing of a priest comes
[47:46] by death
[47:47] but you cannot kill this one
[47:49] so from the beginning all the way to do
[47:52] today
[47:53] under the melchizedek priesthood there
[47:55] is only one priest
[47:59] in order to change him you must kill him
[48:03] here but because he doesn't die you
[48:06] cannot change him
[48:08] so we don't have many priests under the
[48:11] levitical prie under the mercy of the
[48:13] priesthood we only have one priest
[48:20] ever care so far
[48:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[48:24] why is this important
[48:28] why
[48:29] go to number 35
[48:37] go to number 35
[48:39] i'm trying to rush
[48:43] somebody doesn't lose a wing
[48:49] number 35
[48:52] verse 28 if you dare you can say amen
[48:57] everybody there
[48:59] everybody there
[49:00] verse 27
[49:03] and the revenge of blood
[49:06] found him without the border of the city
[49:09] of his refuge
[49:10] and the revenger of blood killed the
[49:13] slater the slayer he will not be guilty
[49:16] of blood
[49:17] in the old testament
[49:19] there was something called the cities of
[49:21] refuge
[49:23] and for some reason when moses
[49:26] established them joshua established them
[49:29] they came out six
[49:31] yes yes
[49:34] here
[49:35] and six is the number of men
[49:39] there never was a seventh one
[49:41] [Applause]
[49:43] are we okay do you follow me
[49:46] do you follow me
[49:47] when they came to the package they said
[49:49] god say i'm gonna put what they call
[49:52] city of refuge
[49:53] they say what does it mean city of
[49:55] refuge yes it means when you did
[49:58] something wrong
[50:00] unintentionally
[50:02] like paul said i was doing that in
[50:04] ignorance
[50:07] okay you were doing that because you
[50:09] didn't know
[50:10] there was a place that you need to run
[50:13] back here and when you run you enter
[50:16] there
[50:17] nobody can touch you
[50:19] even if they have your camera
[50:22] even if they have your picture
[50:25] if you enter there nobody touches you
[50:28] anybody here
[50:30] in that city they will judge you
[50:33] your judgment is in the city
[50:36] not outside the city anybody here and
[50:40] when you are judged
[50:41] you stay in that city
[50:44] never to go outside
[50:46] [Music]
[50:48] do you hear me
[50:50] because the one you did harm
[50:52] is looking for you anybody here
[50:55] everybody here and god is saying here if
[50:58] he finds you outside of the city he has
[51:02] a right to kill you
[51:04] i back here
[51:05] but as long as you are in the city
[51:08] you can stand on the wall of the city
[51:11] and say hello god bless you
[51:14] how are you doing
[51:15] he cannot even shoot an arrow
[51:18] [Music]

[53:46] do you hear me
[53:48] when you enter the city of refuge
[53:51] you are under protection
[53:53] but your sin is talking outside
[53:57] everybody here
[53:58] in the city your sin is quiet
[54:01] outside the city your sin is still alive
[54:04] everybody
[54:06] so that scene
[54:08] is alive
[54:10] but in the city it is carried by the
[54:13] high priest
[54:15] so when the high priest walk he's
[54:17] walking with your sin
[54:19] back here
[54:21] so when the high priest died do you

[54:35] the death of the high priest wipe the
[54:39] sin outside the city
[54:44] in other words the death of the high
[54:46] priest
[54:47] is an atonement for your sin

[54:54] outside the city zero scene
[54:58] [Music]
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:00] so when you come out

[55:06] with
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:09] amen
[55:10] [Applause]
[55:15] hallelujah hallelujah so the problem is
[55:19] melchizedek cannot die
[55:23] you remember we saw that
[55:24] you cannot kill god
[55:26] america
[55:27] so if you keep mercury like that
[55:31] his only security
[55:33] long as we're in the city
[55:35] but our sin is still alive
[55:39] he's still talking
[55:40] do you follow me
[55:42] so we must do something to kill
[55:44] melchizedek
[55:46] yet we don't kill him
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:54] can i repeat again
[55:56] can i repeat again
[55:58] you don't want melchizedek to die
[56:01] because if melchizedek died your
[56:04] security is not
[56:07] is not secure
[56:09] because the high priest as long as he is
[56:11] alive he will protect you on the city of
[56:14] refuge
[56:15] but we want also him to die
[56:18] because we don't want our talking our
[56:21] gossip around the city outside
[56:26] amen
[56:29] do you amen
[56:29] me
[56:30] rahab has a past
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:37] do you follow me
[56:39] if the spies went into jericho
[56:42] and took rehab out
[56:44] and just got with her her story still
[56:47] alive
[56:50] there are people that went with her in
[56:53] the nightclub
[56:55] there are people that were with help in
[56:58] the hotel
[57:00] ever here so pulling rehab only is not
[57:04] the end
[57:05] you must pull him and destroy the
[57:08] evidence
[57:10] [Music]
[57:13] so when you come you want to know the
[57:15] past of harabba there is nobody alive
[57:18] that can tell you her story
[57:22] her city destroyed the people destroyed
[57:25] her whole past is wiped completely
[57:32] you follow me
[57:33] so mercy said they cannot die
[57:36] because we want to stay in eternal
[57:39] security
[57:41] yet we want somebody to wipe what we did
[57:44] wrong
[57:45] so we must also kill melchizedek
[57:50] [Applause]
[57:52] do you follow me you kill melchizedek in
[57:55] this man
[58:02] do you follow me
[58:04] because this man
[58:06] is the visible image of melchizedek
[58:11] him and melchizedek like the hand and
[58:14] the glove
[58:15] when you touch him you touch mercury
[58:18] so melchizedek feel this man
[58:21] until this man is god
[58:24] blessed forever
[58:27] ever here
[58:28] and when your sin is coming upon him
[58:32] melchizedek comes out of him
[58:34] okay back here and say he is the high
[58:37] priest
[58:38] i am the priest
[58:43] [Applause]
[58:50] hallelujah

[58:54] attacking mercury except that's what i
[58:56] was looking

[59:23] security
[59:25] and are wiping off our sins
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:31] are you with me
[59:32] so when they kill jesus christ
[59:36] automatically our sin are nailed
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:45] do you follow me
[59:46] he wiped every sin away
[59:49] and when he finished wiping everything
[59:52] away melchizedek comes again
[59:55] and say wake up
[59:57] and he answered him again
[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:05] hallelujah
[1:00:07] and then from now on you cannot kill him
[1:00:10] anymore
[1:00:11] because he only died once so when you
[1:00:14] come to him

[1:01:31] to show to the hairs
[1:01:35] of the promise
[1:01:39] immutability do you know what that means
[1:01:43] unchangeability unchangeable
[1:01:46] unchangeableness

[1:02:02] that by two
[1:02:04] immunible things
[1:02:06] unchangeable things
[1:02:08] in which it is impossible
[1:02:11] for god to do what
[1:02:14] that we might have a water
[1:02:18] who has what
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:22] you fled for what
[1:02:25] you fled for
[1:02:28] who was fleeing for refuge in the old
[1:02:30] testament they were going where
[1:02:32] to the city of what
[1:02:35] and there were how many city in the old
[1:02:37] testament
[1:02:38] now you found that there is another city
[1:02:40] now
[1:02:42] it is not a natural city
[1:02:45] it is number seven
[1:02:47] the completion of all the cities
[1:02:50] and we who have run toward that city
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:57] a city of refuge
[1:02:59] we who have fled for refuge
[1:03:03] to lay hard upon water
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:06] they hope set water
[1:03:09] this is your seventh city of refuge
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:14] everybody here that's why you heard paul
[1:03:17] say jerusalem who is our mother
[1:03:20] they're
[1:03:22] they heavenly jerusalem who is our
[1:03:24] mother how can a city be your mother
[1:03:28] because we are born into that city
[1:03:30] and the king over there is melchizedek
[1:03:33] the king of jerusalem and that king is a
[1:03:36] high priest he is a city of refuge so
[1:03:39] when you enter there
[1:03:41] ever here
[1:03:42] verse 19 which hope we have as an anchor
[1:03:46] of the water
[1:03:48] not the body now
[1:03:50] but both sure
[1:03:52] and steadfast
[1:03:54] and which enter onto the water
[1:03:59] do you see what the veil was split into
[1:04:02] inside the veil
[1:04:04] verse 20 whereford
[1:04:09] is for us entered
[1:04:17] forever after the order of what
[1:04:24] [Music]
[1:04:29] can i finish here
[1:04:31] let me stop here so you're going to chew
[1:04:33] it
[1:04:35] where was that
[1:04:37] let me stop here where was i
[1:04:41] five
[1:04:42] and no man take off this honor
[1:04:45] that's why here the bible say where of
[1:04:48] he's able to save them to the other most
[1:04:50] he doesn't die
[1:04:52] he's gonna go with his work all the way
[1:04:54] to the end
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:57] that's why he's out firing the omega he
[1:05:00] have to complete what he started
[1:05:02] ever here
[1:05:03] and no man taketh this honor unto
[1:05:06] himself
[1:05:07] but he
[1:05:08] that is call of god
[1:05:10] as was what
[1:05:12] you don't put yourself as a high priest
[1:05:14] you must be appointed by god
[1:05:16] that's why god said you are a priest
[1:05:19] after the order of water they have to
[1:05:22] appoint somebody but here so also christ
[1:05:26] glorify not himself to be made a water
[1:05:31] but he does say unto him there aren't my
[1:05:34] son today i have begotten thee and he
[1:05:38] said also into another place there are
[1:05:40] air
[1:05:42] not a high priest
[1:05:44] forever after the order of what
[1:05:48] called of god a water
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:55] you okay
[1:05:57] melchizedek was a priest
[1:06:00] not a high priest
[1:06:05] but jesus
[1:06:07] is huh
[1:06:14] do you hear me
[1:06:15] do you hear me when mercy melchizedek
[1:06:18] melchizedek took the tarot of high
[1:06:21] priest and put it in jesus
[1:06:24] so he passed the ball
[1:06:27] everybody here
[1:06:28] in other words it's jesus the man
[1:06:31] that made melchizedek high
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:41] melchizedek was a priest
[1:06:43] but when melchizedek entered jesus he
[1:06:47] became the high priest
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:56] before me
[1:06:57] he's the high priest because the high
[1:06:59] priest must die
[1:07:02] everybody
[1:07:02] so the title of high priest is put on
[1:07:06] the sun
[1:07:07] so that he can die for your sin
[1:07:10] when everything is finished that
[1:07:12] melchizedek pulled back up
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:16] and now he stand as a city of refuge
[1:07:20] and back here so when you flee from your
[1:07:23] trouble
[1:07:24] when you flee from your family when you
[1:07:27] free from your old life when you flee
[1:07:29] from spoke from smoking pipe doing all
[1:07:32] kinds of stuff when you enter into
[1:07:35] melchizedek
[1:07:36] it's finished
[1:07:38] everybody
[1:07:39] for you to go out he must die
[1:07:42] but he cannot die no more
[1:07:45] he lived forever
[1:07:46] that's why we are sealed until the day
[1:07:50] of redemption
[1:07:54] ever here
[1:07:55] that's why we are perfected forever
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:00] amen because that person will never die
[1:08:03] it is eternal security
[1:08:07] he finished the work completely once you
[1:08:09] enter he close the door that say
[1:08:13] your problem is finished
[1:08:15] because now the spirit can be poured
[1:08:18] upon you
[1:08:19] and he put your life into a
[1:08:22] rest you enter the sabbath
[1:08:26] and you just sit quiet and he take over
[1:08:28] your life
[1:08:30] let's stand
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:47] i went 11 minutes over
[1:08:51] 11 worker hours
[1:08:58] amen
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:00] that's why you heard peter saying we
[1:09:02] have a sure word of prophecy
[1:09:05] this is not guesswork
[1:09:07] this is reality
[1:09:09] if you have not made peace with
[1:09:12] melchizedek yet
[1:09:14] you must meet him
[1:09:15] as melchizedek
[1:09:17] before the blood is gone and you're
[1:09:20] gonna meet him as a judge
[1:09:22] that's a different thing
[1:09:24] now
[1:09:24] he's the high priest
[1:09:26] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:09:28] her infirmities
[1:09:30] and lord's willing will get into that
[1:09:32] missing generation that we could not
[1:09:34] even touch the scripture
[1:09:36] but you understand the siege of abraham
[1:09:39] he is after a spiritual seed and that
[1:09:42] seed is crust
[1:09:45] but christ is not one man
[1:09:47] he is a multi-member
[1:09:50] person there
[1:09:51] so when you are shaking him there are
[1:09:53] people inside
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] when abraham was playing taft
[1:09:59] that revelation was hidden on
[1:10:01] melchizedek
[1:10:03] liver who was in the loins were benny
[1:10:08] everybody here
[1:10:09] showing that under mercy that the
[1:10:11] benefit is transferred to the children
[1:10:15] even down to the generation liver was
[1:10:17] the fourth one but still the blessing
[1:10:19] can travel spiritually and heat liver
[1:10:22] before levi is born years ago
[1:10:25] it's under melchizedek
[1:10:27] you want to live in peace
[1:10:29] you want a quiet life
[1:10:31] you want a quiet marriage
[1:10:33] you want a peaceful marriage
[1:10:35] you want you need to meet melchizedek
[1:10:39] you want a peaceful life
[1:10:41] you want peace in your home
[1:10:43] you want peace in your family
[1:10:45] there is a king of peace
[1:10:48] there is a king of righteousness there
[1:10:50] is somebody that can speak that can
[1:10:52] justify you more than anybody
[1:10:55] and when he says he have the final word
[1:10:58] you want a relationship in peace
[1:11:01] you want a peaceful job
[1:11:03] you want a peaceful life
[1:11:05] meet the king
[1:11:06] of righteousness
[1:11:08] meet the king of peace
[1:11:10] if he poor his spirit upon you
[1:11:13] then your wilderness
[1:11:15] will be turned into a foot fulfilled
[1:11:17] and what you taught was advantage to you
[1:11:20] you will look at everything all the
[1:11:22] facebook all the whatsapp all the stuff
[1:11:26] that you taught you a big shot you're
[1:11:28] gonna see them as a danger
[1:11:30] why because of the excellency of the
[1:11:33] knowledge of jesus christ
[1:11:35] at that point you are living differently
[1:11:38] then the work of righteousness will
[1:11:39] produce peace
[1:11:41] and you will live in a quiet habitation
[1:11:44] no matter what is going on
[1:11:45] remember he's a shelter in a weary place
[1:11:49] remember he's going to protect you
[1:11:50] against the strong wind
[1:11:52] no matter what is going on you will see
[1:11:54] situation going on in your life
[1:11:57] but on the inside you are peaceful
[1:11:59] you don't know why you peaceful you
[1:12:01] don't know why you're not trouble you
[1:12:03] don't know why you don't get upset again
[1:12:05] like you were doing before because
[1:12:07] somebody is controlling things
[1:12:09] and before you know it everything is
[1:12:11] solved
[1:12:13] beyond your intelligence
[1:12:16] because his way that he work thinks is
[1:12:18] different than you
[1:12:19] because he puts you into rest he say
[1:12:22] rest and watch me do what i can do
[1:12:25] and everything will be all right
[1:12:26] heavenly father
[1:12:28] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:12:30] father thanking you
[1:12:32] for unfolding these things to us lord
[1:12:35] lord we read about melchizedek
[1:12:39] we barely touch the surface father
[1:12:41] because there are so many things that
[1:12:43] you loaded
[1:12:45] under this personality
[1:12:47] that pertain to the benefit of your
[1:12:49] children lord
[1:12:51] father now we begin to understand why
[1:12:53] paul was whipping
[1:12:55] why paul was continually under sorrow
[1:12:59] because he looked and he saw what israel
[1:13:02] missed
[1:13:03] and now it has been turned into the
[1:13:05] gentile
[1:13:06] and father we as a gentile
[1:13:08] we want to look at this treasure
[1:13:11] and appreciate it
[1:13:13] not to look at that treasure as the jews
[1:13:16] who lord because of a lack of revelation
[1:13:18] missed it
[1:13:19] and father turn it away
[1:13:21] and that stone that the builder rejected
[1:13:25] father was the man and the headstone
[1:13:27] lord
[1:13:28] father may each person under the roof of
[1:13:31] this building
[1:13:32] and those that are streaming online lord
[1:13:35] father realized that this is not
[1:13:37] something to fill our mind
[1:13:40] but it is something that was intended to
[1:13:42] touch our heart
[1:13:44] that we can realize that the god of
[1:13:47] heaven can make all these great planes
[1:13:51] father hide all this tap and shadow
[1:13:54] just to get somebody a wretched like us
