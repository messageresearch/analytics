equilibrium everything works fine perfectly Ascent going up another scent coming in Amen to trouble the devil amen glory be to the name of the Lord this coming Sunday I found his text later on there is a ministers meeting going on down in South Carolina so there is a pastor his name is brother Dan Ratliff I met him at Ohio when I was a brother Chad's land meeting that's where we met together and he's uh in Gregory Michigan so Lord's willing he will be going there this weekend but he purposed to stop here he probably missed in two the sermon more than some of you amen so he will he really felt the pool to stop here and to fellowship with us he really enjoyed the church and enjoyed the fellowship so I didn't feel like me preaching and a pastor is coming out like that I felt like I need the lady minister so he can be a blessing for us although it's really on Sunday morning he will be the one ministering while I keep digging on the staff of the Lord amen matter of fact there is stuff still opening up so you pray for the weekend Pastor Dan Ratliff will be here on Sunday morning and tonight we have our family member I told him welcome to this to your second home so I can get in trouble so this is brother Aaron he was here you know brother Aaron now so he will be preaching I told him he's home he behaved like home he preached like home we put like home and we do everything like everybody okay so stay up because he got slapped just like your pastor everybody okay amen so let's see only believe oh We Believe oh We Believe [Music] us [Music] please amen is that your prayer tonight if you believe all things are possible that was the Angel's favorite song because that's what God wants us to do is to only believe if you have a prayer request you can show by raising your hand God sees the hearts that are behind those hands let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for the songs of Zion but we seek sang Here Lord father for the ministration oh God for the gifts father of singing Lord the sons of Assaf Lord skillful in the song as you said Lord that it was Chennai who was skillful in the song and David would write a Psalm and give it to Asaf because he had the gift to make it into a Melody we thank you Father for the song that I've been saying We Believe Lord that these songs have touched your heart Lord for Lord we know that you dwell in the praise of your people now father we are coming Lord with different prayer requests your children are raising their hands Lord no doubt some are streaming Lord somewhere in in in the prophet who call it in tape land father we pray Lord God that you give them the desires of their hearts there are some that are seek Lord may you heal them tonight father for your promise is still the same we thank you for brother Kelly be with theme father as he's undertaking the funeral Lord we want to remember Sister Portia Martin Lord how he has lost oh God her husband and the family and the church father we see that you are harvesting your servants but Lord you never deliver the Earth without a witness we thank you for these things we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you you may have your seats thank you so much musicians we enjoy the the music Ministry suddenly a joy to be here in the house of the Lord with you I I really wish I was sitting and uh igu Shambo would be teaching [Laughter] but he's a Gifted Man and one of the attributes of having a gift is recognizing other gifts if you can't recognize other gifts then your gift is not positionally placed praise be to God but I I I really enjoy coming and you know hearing the word sometimes listening on the stream and I I listen for 10 minutes and then I stop I think about it sometimes I pray and then I continue on the sermon because there's just so much that is allotted in those sermons and um and I pray that you know God bless him as you know that we are losing ministers we are losing pastors but God will always raise men he takes his men but never his spirit Amen brother George Martin was a was a teacher he was a pillar of the faith Down in Africa and some of you may know him you know there's there's a power in teaching the Bible says in the book of Israel Nehemiah that Israel had been without God and without teaching priests so you need teaching priests and brother George Martin was one example of a teaching priest and we we will certainly miss him but we know that God is also raising other teaching priests praise be to God Hallelujah I won't belong tonight I don't have a lot so that's why I'm taking my time you know doing preliminaries sometimes God is in the preliminaries when you re when you read the spoken word don't jump to the scripture read everything the introductions read about it amen one time I preached on the one of the last scriptures in the Bible where Paul was greeting people and he says greet appear less approved in the Lord and that was my title being approved in the Lord so you know all the scripture is inspired and uh we love this church and we we know that we are we are praying for you and we know that you are praying for us and we bring you greetings from my pastor brother Barry coffee if we can stand tonight to read the scripture we're gonna read from uh The Book of Matthew chapter 38 verse uh Chapter 13 Verse 38. if you have your Bible it read in this wise I'm just gonna I just I'm just gonna take a portion but you know the story so Jesus Christ was talking about the the harvests about the you know the the serpent seed and the seed of Christ and he was interpreting that parable verse 38 he says the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world this time that we are living and the reapers are the Angels now how can you meet the minister of brother Branham the reapers are the Angels Hallelujah is therefore the tears are gathered and burnt in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world may God bless the reading of his word you may have your seat tonight for a little for a short time we're going to talk about the maturity of Abram seed at the Harvest amen we love brothers are praying for him amen if there's a man that you need to pray for he's the pastor because you know the enemy attacks the pastor Smite the shepherd and the Sheep who will scatter and there are three three main areas that the devil attack when he wants to attack the pastor he will attack the church he will attack his children and sometimes you attack his wife so that's why sometimes job would say you are speaking like a foolish woman because the devil was attacking job through his wife amen so you you pray for your pastor amen those are things that you know the devil uses to attack the pastor and the things that the devil uses to attack a man it's mainly your job your wife and your religion if you don't pray for these three things as a young man you're going to have a problem the life of a man revolves around these three things your job your religion and your marriage amen amen because when God created Adam that was yet religion a relationship and then the next thing God gave adam the guardian that's his job then you give to Eve that's the wife so those are the three things that revolve around them that's exactly 98 of the problems that a pastor is solving around a man yes sir mostly is those three things that's exactly next time I'll tell you three things that's trouble a young woman praise be to God so you pray for your husband because the husband is the first priest he is the priest of the house amen there are three priesthoods in the Bible the father of the house and the priesthood of the Levites and the priesthood of Melchizedek that's right because job when he was sacrificing for his children yes sir he was doing the work of the priest that's right amen the father is the priest of the house yes they are things that the pastor does not have to deal with the priest of the house you deal with it with those things at his level they are things that God will inquire of the husband that's why the prophet says if you let your wife do that hallelujah praise be to God yes sir I don't know why I'm talking about this but let's go to our scripture so the Seed of Abraham yes now the Seed of Abraham is the seed of Christ that's the seed of God Amen because Genesis is your beginning right that's your seed chapter yes and Revelation is your Harvest that's it whatever was planted in Genesis it's a harvested in Revelation that's right whatever started in the Garden of Eden it will be harvested in the last days hallelujah so we are living in the time of the Harvest and the Bible is predicated upon Harvest oh the Feast of Israel they were based on the Harvest yes Hallelujah the spring feasts and the Autumn Feast amen yes sir I think I spoke about that with the other time I came you know they will start harvesting barley and the the priest would look at the ears of the Corn of Bali for them to declare the Passover because it has to consult yes sir Hallelujah because if it doesn't concise you won't have Bali to bring during the time of the shiv worth that's right which is your which is your first fruits praise be to God and at the time of Pentecost as the Harvest of the wheat amen you are the Feast of the Tabernacles you have the Harvest of the grapes and the pomegranates and the olives yes Hallelujah so the Bible is based upon the Harvest amen and you know these scriptures I'm not going to take so much time on them we have been talking about the Book of Ruth you know coming in the time of the Harvest to Bethlehem and so on and so on hallelujah amen but now Abraham he had a cedar and that seed of Ibraham we know that I'm just you know laying a foundation right now there are two seeds in the Bible huh amen there is a natural seed and then there's a spiritual seed yes Ishmael is the natural seed that's right he is born by the natural wage amen but Isaac is born by the promise and the promise is very specific yes sir I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and your wife yes Sarah yes very specific where the seed will come through amen hallelujah so there are many churches that are gathered tonight but there is one Church which is gathered under the promise behold I send you Elijah the prophet Hallelujah the seed of Ibraham is recognized by the promise yes it's not recognized by the flesh it's recognized by the promises when you believe the promise then you have a seat of Ibraham Hallelujah you cannot be a seed of Ibraham If you deny Malachi chapter 4. no sir the Seed of Abraham is recognized by the promise yes my brother Hallelujah and one one of the seeds is a spiritual Cedar that's right the other one is a natural cedar one is a spiritual manner he loves to be in church he loves to read the Bible he loves to listen to the world that's right and the other is a natural man that's right Hallelujah that's my brother praise be to God the natural man is religious but he is not spiritual those are two different things being religious and being spiritual are two different things that's my brother Hallelujah which seed are you tonight I believe you're the seed of Ibraham that's why you have come to church that's why you are saying amen that's why you are shouting because you are the seat of the promise yes my brother Hallelujah pray to my brother now the seed of Ibraham is to come to maturity yes sir amen yes sir Hallelujah and the maturity of the seat amen when you plant a seed yes sir the end goal of the seed right is to come back to the seat yes Hallelujah if you plant corn that's right the machine of the corner is to become the seed itself so the maturity of the seed of Ibraham hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah of the church is to come to the seed word again that's right Hallelujah yes and the shark has to pull away the shark has to go away the denominational thinking has to go away until we become the full Cedar of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah why is brother Stephen laboring tonight all through this night and all through these days he is preparing the siege of Ibraham to come to the Harvester to a place where we become the seed again the prophet says God is not going to bring a new churcher he's going to to mature his church that's what he said that seed was planted at Pentecost it fell at night exactly and it came up to the Reformation right and in the last age it is to come to the full maturity back to it again Glory so our goal is to come to maturity yes sir and when we become mature we become like Jesus because there is no servant who is greater than his master but if he shall come to his master he shall be perfect hallelujah praise be to God that's that's one problem that we don't have we don't have maturity the difference between called Corinthians and Ephesians was maturity yes Hallelujah yes there were all churches of God but one was greener and the other one was mature that's exactly right Hallelujah and it's the Sun that brings maturity that's right and the sun does not mature the seed only it also matures the tears that's right Hallelujah that's why you see this these days people are coming out I have got nothing to do with religion I'm a sodomite they are coming to maturity where they identify who they are and the sons of God they are also coming to maturity I identify as a Son of God I am a daughter of milk is a taken we are coming out and declaring our pedigree here yes why should you be ashamed to tell the world who you are when you come to my children my brother my sister you are not ashamed you tell the world I'm a message believer I'm identified with the prophet I believe Malachi 4 5 and 6. Hallelujah coming to maturity because the tears are coming to maturity that's right amen yes they celebrate being sodomite all this month we are celebrating the sodomites because I don't know I don't want YouTube to flag our video but you know the mystery yes sir Hallelujah praise be to God yes sir so it's the time of the Harvest amen now the sun brings the maturity that's exactly it's matures the wheat and it matures the tears amen because when they were planted the Angels said can we go and go and approach and Jesus Christ says no you approved the good seeds let them grow together at the time of the Harvest that's it I will send my angel and we will harvest the winter Hallelujah and what is matured is to come to a final desired State amen having completed natural growth heavy being ripe and most of the problems you find in the church is immaturity that's exactly oh this brother he took my seat oh this brother should not be a deacon oh maybe this sister you know she's not supposed to be singing just play immaturity hallelujah praise be to God when you are mature as a Seed of Abraham you prefer your brother better than yourself Hallelujah I am talking about maturity when you are green you walk with a red pen markings other people's mistakes exactly right oh that's the wrong key oh the wedding was not looking so good oh the colors were not planting well but when you are mature you say Lord help my brother is he singing Lord we thank you for our sisters waiting I thank you to my brother's jacket when you are mature you come up to Jesus Christ Hallelujah I am talking about maturity even in marriage you have to come to maturity you can't behave like little children like high school kids sometimes you have to come to maturity yes sometimes if you say you know what therefore I'm tired of this I am tired of this search my brother Hallelujah we are talking about maturity yes brother some of these little demons that we deal with like gossiping backbiting that's just immaturity that's exactly right Hallelujah yes my brother amen yes when you are mature you don't look for yourself amen you look for the next person amen you want your brother to have the better deal yes one time brother pranam was hunting hallelujah amen and the brother shot a deer and he was rejoicing I have the biggest deer and the prophet had a bigger deer than that one but he said I'm not gonna mess up my brother I'm gonna help him Rejoice that's maturity of the Abraham Sita yes when you can live for your brother when you can brother when you can prefer your sister your husband your wife you are coming to maturity Hallelujah but the disciples when they were still green they were wondering Lord who is the greatest in the Kingdom who is the greatest in the Kingdom right in Jesus Christ looking at them is smart says the greatest amongst you must be the servant spiritual maturity yes yes amen yes I can think of our Lord Jesus when you are sitting in the house of Simon the Pharisee and the Pharisees were talking about the word of God they were talking about great scriptures and Mysteries and and they were talking about the logos and different things and he was just quiet like this yes my brother he was just quiet like this no wait you're wrong no he was just sitting like this maturity yes wisdom experience and then when the time had come yes that the father said now it's time to speak that's it Hallelujah you watch what is Sparkle there's never a man speak like this man if you want to have the same testimony you have to wait to speak on God yes Father speak wait upon God yes my brother Hallelujah when Dr best and brother boss with were having their arguments the prophet was sitting in the congregation hiding himself and they were arguing going back and forth until it was almost a fight a mature son of Abraham he could have raised up and said listen I saw an angel oh God is going to curse you oh this is going to happen to you he never did that no sir no sir that's immaturity that's it you waited yes sir you waited yes and when the boss gave the note says now it's time to stand up when he stood up yes they said there was a whole block of of angels oh may God help us tonight to realize the time there's come to follow the spirit of adoption Hallelujah when you know you are angry don't answer back don't send an email don't talk to your brother don't go back go and pray after you after you finish praying then come back say honeybunch I don't appreciate the way you are speaking to me my brother I do not appreciate what you say to me that's maturity my brother that's my shoot my my brother preach it's not about winning an argument it's about winning your brother Hallelujah may God help us tonight may God help us tonight Hallelujah point a problem with the church of Corinth he says I belong to Paul I belong to Apollos I belong to Peter you know I only listen to the tapes where I only followed my pastor he says if you have these things it's because you are immature it's because you're immature that's exactly you never said you are not Christians he says you are immature when you have these divisions when you find divisions in the church there is immaturity Hallelujah because brother Branham said a brother with the Holy Ghost he can go along with a brother out of Truth when you have the Holy Ghost you can live with a wife Out Of Tune you can live with the husband Out Of Tune you can pray for your husband like Abigail preach Hallelujah when Abigail came to day theater he never said King David my husband is a Disciples of men whatever happens is God's judgment says it says my Lord you know that my husband you know he's he's weak you know he pleaded for his husband she pleaded a type of a mature Church Hallelujah could have could have been like ah that man I knew it you you don't know the things that he does at home Hallelujah happy girl spoke good about his husband amen and because of that Abigail was married to King David when she has the right attitude you are going to be married to Jesus Christ the spiritual son of man amen amen hallelujah praise be to God [Music] amen to come to maturity friends we can be going after movements this movement this movement no we have to come to a place where we can say when I was a child I speak like a child I listened as a child but now I'm grown up I'll speak like an adult what is the mark of a child preach my brother someone who is a slave to their feeling when a child wants something they want something that's it they can't help it they have no Restraint of their own body because they are immature they will crack they will roll on the ground because their children but if you're an adult you know better to wait for the time a type of a natural cedar says what benefit is the breath right to me I wonder soup right now I want to be married right now I don't care about the birthrights I can be married in the world I want the soup right now my brother immaturity that's exactly right Hallelujah Glory amen yes and Isaac called Jacob it says the the daughters the the wives of Esau the trouble Mish if you want to marry God to the house of love and God has spoken with Tabernacle go to the house of Laban Hallelujah yes when you married from the house of lapan when you marry the daughter of a king you become the son-in-law of a king when you marry the daughter of the devil do you wanna be a son of Love Melchizedek yes my brother I'm on slide four five off 30 but don't worry we're not preaching to finish we are preaching to to catch the mind of God that's her my brother Romans 8 verse 19 for the earliest expectation yes of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God amen amen amen that we are they are not waiting for the creation of the sons of God but the manifestation of the sons of God Amen so God how how are they manifested the only thing that manifests a seed which is the Harvest if you look in the field yes sir Hallelujah yes everything will be green the wheat the tears but when you come to maturity of the grain then you the grain manifests itself that's exactly this is a wheat this is a tear so the manifestation of the sons of God Amen is the children of God recognizing who they are it was Ephesians says yes yes in the dispensation of the fullness of time that's right and the promise says we have yet the dispensation of Moses where the disposition of Joshua but the name of this dispensation is called the dispensation of the fullness of time Amen in other words is the seventh seal this position that's exactly right Hallelujah yes sir it's a dispensation where Hallelujah promises Mary was a type of Pentecost she was hacking the seed but she was not a cedar so the Pentecost denomination is not a singer she was hugging the cedar but this pride has to come to the become the seed of Jesus Christ Hallelujah yes my brother praise be to God glory to God the creatures are waiting yes my brother as soon as they see the sign of God they recognize that that's exactly they are talking about climate change that's not gonna stop it the only thing that's gonna stop it is you and me amen we hold the mystery of reversing climate change of reversing earthquakes and disasters are praise with the gods yes sir for we know that the whole creation grown up that's right and it's surveillance and playing together until now yes my brother amen yes sir but not only they but ourselves also we have the first fruit of the spirit even ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption now there's a spiritual adoption and there's a natural adoption the natural adoption is when the the celestial the terrestrial takes on Celestial body the prophecies but the true and false Vine are coming to maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for burning that's why if you find people today you know bundling together that's exactly right tick tock with the denomination with the Catholicism I I heard recently the Catholic they said you cannot persecute sonomites that's what he said and the Anglican Church they had a vote and they voted against that they said we have to respect and honor the marriage of the sodomites so the dragon is speaking like the beasts that's exactly so that the peace get the Beast can speak like the Dragon amen amen because the the woman Jezebel she needs Ahab for her to enforce her religion that's exactly like amen right so when she has Ahab yes that's a mixture of of state and religion and when you mix those together you give Jezebel a sword and she becomes a red horse rider she belies a red horse so when the Catholic right now is powerless because it has got no other power to enforce but that she has to write on Ahab which is the Beast of Revelation 13. that's exactly which is this country amen right so she's writing this Beast right so they have to speak the same language that's the only way the woman can raise the beach that's right and they are coming to a convulsion that's exactly everything is maturing Israel is maturity she is recognizing a place that's what she's saying we are going to destroy Iran's nuclear silos she is standing in your place the denominations are recognizing their place the bride has to recognize a place amen glory to God yes sir adoption part one election looks better for knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny that's right now what is our destiny yes it's glorification that's our destiny praise be to God Amen most Vision he says it was white brightest snow this was not because of his age Jesus Christ the brilliant white yet does not signify age but experience maturity and wisdom Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the first shift waiver that was waived by God before the church that all the sons may come back to his full maturity that's exactly right Hallelujah yes my brother that was the purpose of waving the Sheep it was to symbolize that the rest of the Harvest that's right yes to come to this that's why we pay our tithes brother Brahm ties ties paying tithes to the Harvest we don't have time to go into into those things amen but those things are deep and spiritual amen hallelujah let me skip that preach my brother see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church we must have that type of Christianity for him to receive the wheat yes to get the ripe yes all right yes that's the matter with the message today Christ is revealed in his own words in those who obtained it their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun that's exactly to get ripened see you can pick up the message and let the sun break all the greenness out of you yes my brother when you lay in the presence of them or the Holy Spirit and you let all the greenness go out of you all the immaturity or the gossiper or the black bitinger or the foolishness you let it go out of you but today people are not laying in the presence of them they are breaking in the present of Netflix that's it they are breaking in the presence of Amazon amen Hallelujah they want they won't call me after this but we have to preach it lay in the presence of the Son of God not tick tock [Music] listen to the message of the Prophet that's it when you take a car for service on the outside nothing looks like this nothing that has changed but the engine will register the service is up to date when you come to church when you go out outside it looks like nothing has happened but the soul inside there is a check light inside the engine is up to surface Hallelujah yes my brother yes sir preach my brother I wonder how many inches today anyway let me not go there preach where for that I might I might be bold in Christ to enjoy that which is convenient yet for Love's sake I'd rather beseech thee now this is the story of in the book of Philemon now the book of I live on is a very interesting book very because in Philemon was an elder in Coliseum and he was you know he was you know he was the one the church was gathering in his house and he was like the pastor for that group and then there was this servant who stole some man and they ran away and under Roman laws that was cap that was capital punishment that was the realm the Romans did not want a Revolt so they were very strict with with slaves right so he read he went away and he went to to to to to Rome and when he went to Rome you know what he got converted amen amen and he met Paul sometimes when you are a seed no matter where you run no matter where you go the Holy Ghost will find you out others can go in the world and they can get by with it but if you try to run away God will find you she will bring you back because you are the seat of Ibraham Jesus Christ said I have come to find the lost sheep of the house amen so when he was converted under Paul he was a type of you and me yes sir we were running away from God because of our sins that's right because of what we did but when we met Jesus now there's only one God I'm just dramatizing so that you understand was playing the part of Christ so when he met this young man in in Rome he says I I am going to send you with a letter Paul gave the young man a letter that's exactly Christ gave you the word and and he took this letter to to Philemon and Paul says listen Philemon all right whatever this young man stole from shoe that's right put it in my account whatever you owe sir put it in my account Jesus Christ said whatever you are put it in my account at one time he was useless but now he is useful that's exactly and his name was onismus now onismus means useful we were useless in the world when we come to the to Christ we become useful Hallelujah so he took this letter and he presented to find lemon and boy to sign with his own hands otherwise Philemon would say you know what I can't believe this this is something that you made up so Paul had to put his seal of vindication that it is not Paul that is it is but it is Christ who is speaking through this man hallelujah praise be to God glory to God and Paul says I have signed this with my own hands you see how big letters I have wrought because he had problems with his eyes so he would sign with big letters say poor amen and they they recognize the signature of power that this is poor this is legitimate yes sir amen he says good morning friends we recognize him [Applause] is now he says no I could I could command you Philemon to just accept this brother he says but now I'm old he actually says but now export the edged I'm now old I'm gonna use love I plead with you for my son amen when you come to maturity you don't force us your way into things huh you use love I plead for my son's sake please receive yes my brother please yes my brother says I have a right to command you because you owe me even my own life your own lives but because I am out mature I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you in love please forgive my brother onismus ah man may I plead with you tonight please forgive your brother please forgive your sister Hallelujah praise be to God glory to God praise me to God forgive your brother forgive your husband forgive your wife glory to God we are not commanding soon we are pleading in love yes yes my brother the prophet says John the prophet when he was coming from the Isle of Patmos little children amen hallelujah yes maturity and love they walk together yes my brother when divine La projected Sovereign Grace takes over [Applause] preach my brother that which was from the beginning which our hands have handled which our eyes have seen is that which we Proclaim and to shoot amen yes Hallelujah and Paul says this is my own son he didn't say this is a brother that God convert it says he is my own son that's the way you look at your brother in church he is my own son he is my own brother he sees my own mother she is not a brother from church he is my own brother yes my brother Hallelujah we are preaching about maturity sisters when you go to the wedding don't criticize how was the wedding all the food was not nice all the music was not great right away that's where you miss your blessing because God hears that yes [Music] and you block your own Blessing by foolishness yes yes you are to say the wording was great I bless the Lord for my sister God blessed our sister you know David's wife mikai she became barren because of the comments sometimes we lose blessings because of our comments exactly like preach my brother thank you Hallelujah the seventh Church ages 54. the more I think of the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find out what is love that covers the whole thing the love of God said abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit the prophet says when I was a young Minister everyone who disagrees with me is out but when I grew up I learned that it stretches a little further anyone who doesn't agree with me is out that's not how you do it Peter said Lord how many times like you know just think of the Church of Jesus Christ it was Judas and just to see the maturity that was in Christ he knew that Judas was a thief but he never tried to expose him he made he made him the treasurer he made him the chairman of the trustees Hallelujah I am talking about Jesus Christ yes my brother no the Bible says that Joseph being a righteous man would not want to make his wife a public example why should you do that yes my brother if you are mature you live for your brother yes my brother yes sir Joseph said the right yes to say Mary you know what you did this is nonsense he never Joseph never went on Facebook this you know men are dogs Joseph never did that he was a righteous man says I'm gonna put you away secretly and when he did that the angel Gabrielle came right there says Joseph fienna to take me with my wife when you have the right attitude God's Gonna explain things to shoot [Applause] [Music] but when you are rough in your torn apart and Christ can speak he'll wait until you come down one time the prophet prayed for a a Believer and they died and said Lord wash God never said nothing after many weeks and months when he was calmed down Hallelujah the Holy Ghost came this is the reason God does not speak to you when you are in that atmosphere Matthew that's exactly right preach my brother Hallelujah and brother Brahms is the Holy Ghost this is a quote I've never heard him on the discernment line I'm saying to someone you are in the wrong Church you never did that on the discernment that's the that that that the Holy Ghost amen the temperance of the Holy Ghost [Music] and the first time they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denomination will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again it's full power and being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders the prophet was a shift way for our age amen amen amen he is his life was an example when All Shook Up you know she was the prophet looked at the atmosphere in the home he never said let me open the Bible let me give you a quote he took in he took the apron sometimes you need to take the Opera and he went to wash the dishes a prophet of dispensations come on tonight he could have said listen sister you know the angel I spoke today he never he never did that sometimes the prophet would greet a brother and the brother would say I love you my brother and the prophets will see a vision that he's lying he never said you know what you're lying your hypocrites you say I love you my brother God bless you my brother one woman says I want to straighten you out know who I am do you know I met an angel they just said all right you see you can straighten me out I Wanna Be Right you say it's it's attitude yes one time rely on the wood Banks they were driving a boat and they said if only we can you know go and tell this Jehovah Witness that we are now Christians the prophet says that please the Lord and I wonder our conversations tonight are they pleasing the Lord oh people are talking about American football they're talking about balloons and things amen but when Elizabeth and Mary they were talking about Jesus hallelujah amen John received the Holy Ghost because of the conversations which they were having it was a mature conversation yeah it was not a competition no I have the best dress in church amen my husband is the best car I I went to the best Airbnb she knows this is my bucket list all those things are great but they have their place amen but the sisters when they greeted they were greeting with the scriptures and quotations or Hail Mary full of grace Hallelujah press me to God glory to God and they were meeting Angels yes sir who said that Angels can't meet sisters angels can speak to sisters who discovered Malachi 4 5 and 6. [Music] it was the woman sister media brush as a type of the church that the church Elijah will recognize the church but the church has to recognize Elijah remember the woman at Memphis Tennessee she said passion says how did you know that I'm a person Elijah was descending the hearts of the people but the bride deserves Elijah who he is Hallelujah is foreign to recognize Elijah you are Elijah amen prince who do you say this is remember Saint oh my time is running out remember saint the first priesthood in the Old Testament in Hebrew chapter 7 was the priesthood of of the Levites and Paul was separating the old and the new and the book of Hebrews is called the book of bitter things what's bocell is the Moses is better than Christ is better than Moses Christ is better than than Angels you know the other the the new the New Testament is better than the Old Testament you know and he says the priesthood that we have is the priesthood of Melchizedek which is declared by the power of an endless life yes it says but the former priesthood right was in Syria right because it was done by men who could die they would come back again that's right and it was a priesthood that was under the law that's right in other words it was a priesthood that was given to Israel that's right and the prophet says that Israel are always God's servants right but the but but but but we the Gentiles are God's brides and he actually says in 1961 that the 104 000 they are the eunuchs or the bright attendance that's exactly right they are Before the Throne but the pride is in the throne so that that Jews they're under the priesthood of servants but we are under the priesthood of Kings Hallelujah yes sir praise be together and because they were servants they were given the law that's why thou shall not do this thou shall not do things but we are under the priesthood of kings and we live by revelation foreign [Applause] but a son before he comes to maturity is not different from a servant but when it comes to maturity then he doesn't need to be told to come to church Oh Glory to Carter you don't need to be told to delete those filthy websites you are a son of God there were Slavs in a plantation and some of them were Slavs in detail but there was one that was different do you feed him different no sir no sir amen why is it different says because he comes from the order of milk where he comes from he's the son of a king Hallelujah he is under the author of Kings preach my brother amen yes yes the prophet one time was ever tap an echo he says I'm here in the Tabernacle I don't need to have a prayer life I think he was preaching adoption because the church was coming to my church amen no we still need prayer lines yes I don't want you to miss caught me you fine please but he says I'm just gonna run the first line he says receive with my sister receive it my brother receive with my sister but when it called we need to go to the Pentecost house you'd go like for 30 minutes your name is sorry and so because they they faith but but God says blessed are you amen if you believe without saying amen amen when you come to maturity to my sister when you come to my children my brother that you recognize I am a son of God you say brother Aaron ah my church there's this problem you know they should have done this they should have made this brother I trust him that's not a mature attitude the Lord bless our church we thank you for the men that are laboring and your attitude should be if I would do it I'll do a a West job my my brother he does a better job than me amen that's maturity and you mean it from your heart but if you want to do it then you're not the right person for the job because remember God is Not Looking for the gift he is looking for the spirit because Lucifer never lost his gift but he lost the right spirit give it to my brother and David the right spirit Hallelujah hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah so hit the crowd but David the anointing what would you rather have the crown or the anointing I'll rather have the anointing hey man hey man Others May fight for it Others May put us I will wait upon the Lord my help comes from the Lord my help comes from Heaven my promotion comes to my powerful [Applause] you don't have to compromise you stay there as a son of God even Jesus looked at pilate pilate said do you know I have power to release you Jesus says you have no power unless it's given from above he was mature amen he suffered with Peter he was he was slow suffering with Peter yes don't do that Peter oh Peter come on Peter he was long suffering with the disciples he knew that the disciples were not converted and Peter when he had his cup was with Judas you'd go to the Lord and say Lord how many times must I forgive you brother and the Lord said 70 times seven oh pastor this sister this brother the pastor should ask how many times today if it's less than 490 go back hurry to God Clarity in one day yes ma'am let's say can I have the log I want to see brother I don't you don't understand my husband I understand him my brother every wow I have to know my wife I know your wife that's the right one that God gave you that's exactly right preach why was Moses the meekest man on the Earth it was because of zipporah also you cannot rule out zipporah that's what the prophet says yes my brother the prophet says Moses was writing the Bible and he did not leave his bad parts he never said you know my wife is the Angel Moses was the one who wrote the Bible and he's the one who wrote about zipporah Hallelujah and the prophet says my wife brings the door for me if it was you you would leave that part you say oh my wife she's very spiritual oh brother you know she's a human being she's a daughter of God but we all make mistakes and we all need Grace Hallelujah praise be to God knew what you needed and he gave you the best [Music] Hallelujah some of you God knew that you know you the power is too much you need something that brings you down a little bit you need a force of gravity that will keep you grounded God knows how to do things amen praise be to God she is the greatest gift that God gave you outside of salvation you say brother Aaron I don't believe that well okay do you read about the Jews the prophecies that was the tender hand of God what you have is the tender hand of God [Music] praise me to God we are coming to the Harvest now I want to say this in closing friends we need to come to the Harvest is that all right yes we don't always have to wait for my marriage banquet sometimes we can just drop in these things sometimes we see balloons flying over your life we send an F-22 and we shut it down sometimes you need to declare a no-fly zone there is no one that flies a balloon over the White House the balloon one thing that I liked is that as soon as it came to the Carolinas it went all through the denominations as soon as it came to spoken word that should be done Hallelujah the devil must know yes hey man as soon as I I then you know he flees away gossip will be going around and messing churches as soon as you come to spoken with sabaneko shut down glory to God hey man yes I mean we are past the type of splitting churches and you know no no no no no why should you speak the church why should you split the church why should you sow division amen Abraham was mature um you say it to Lots listen Lots he said we are breathless that's what he said he said we are preference let there be no Strife between us he didn't say you are wrong I'm wrong and you know what the herdsmen were fighting each other but the flocks did not belong to them like like ministers sometimes people fight each other but the flocks that belong to Jesus they are not even our flock they belong to God Jesus said Philip before brother Aaron testified to you I saw you so you don't belong to brother era you belong to Jesus Hallelujah and Abraham said if you go to the left I'll go to the right if you go to the right I'll go to the left and the prophet says a Christian will give his brother the better part of the deal that spiritual maturity some of these little deaths sometimes we just have to write them off sometimes just like to say don't worry about it my brother don't know what about in my sister it's not everything that you have to settle do you know four years ago you promised me peace yes you know especially sisters they've got very good memory I wish they could apply it to school glory to God Hallelujah no it's not bad they're a type of the church the church remembers the promise of Christ and it's our duty to remind Christ Lord you promised by your stripes I am healed Lord you promise I shall be the head not the tale Lord you promised in Isaiah amen amen amen and you can't blame the woman because the Bible says your desire shall be that of your husbands no even if you stay 24 7 with your wife you will not give you you have attention because you can't override the scripture your desire shall be that of your husband as a type of the church we always want more of Christ amen but Abraham he said we are brethren and the prophet says that Abraham was a dollar and lot was a penny but because Abraham was a dollar he did not strive with lots he was mature amen he long suffered and and when lot was in trouble Abraham never said I knew it you see I told you don't go there you see what I told you if you hear yourself say I told you you are wrong I don't care what it is you are wrong you should never say that a person must know in in their hearts something the Holy Ghost would deal with the person don't deal with a person let the Holy Ghost deal with a person amen amen amen amen I am talking about maturity friends Abraham when he saw that the Lord was captured when the prophet heard that Billy Paul was in trouble in the hospital he ran he never he just said Billy I'm here my son you know you know you you did something wrong just to confess to God he will help you he never condemned him and say you see what I told you I knew you were wrong you never did that that was the heart of Abraham lot is in trouble let me go and help my brother and many times the people that would curse brother Branham they'll be calling for him on their deathbed and sometimes with brother Abraham is putting a court to go and pray for them sometimes that's when they die amen sometimes even when people leave the church don't condemn them when Junior Jackson refused brother Abraham's Church order some of the people were saying these dead beings brother man says don't do that don't do that someone leaves the church don't say oh you're going to be lost you're going to just say brother if you if you think you can worship God better that's fine brother we are praying for you amen and in your prefer that and start you know no just obviously don't accompany yourself with the big sliders just give them their space I see sometimes people you know they want to go back to the big sliders they say ah you know brother I want to explain to him no don't explain anything just pray for them you know you know it's like you know brother
