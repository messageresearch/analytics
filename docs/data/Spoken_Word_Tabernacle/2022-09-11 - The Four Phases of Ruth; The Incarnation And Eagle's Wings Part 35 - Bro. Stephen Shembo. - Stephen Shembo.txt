sis is it come on up and I'll let you read that and then we'll read the prayer requests and pray we have one special this morning amen and I think it's going to be a very good one God bless your Saints we all believe that east west home is best right naturally and spiritually so we are here but we know that home is best so naturally most of us here we came from different parts of the world and even though we are here we always think of home right so we um for us also east west home is best which is Kenya and we had a small home that we had built for our retirement as we wait for the Lord and we had drilled oh well to serve the water in the home and because we are here and you know how it is those who come from home if you're not there you can send money and that money can be used yes so we we thought we had a professional that was vouched by so many people but he ended up doing a half job and that well sucked um that was a lot of money down the drain so we had to do it again this time we really tried to sort for people that we thought we knew and that you know had a lot of testimonies and really prayed about it and we believed that we got the right person he did the job the well worked fantastically for about a year and a half and then the water that was coming out of the world during a rainy season all of a sudden was like the carpet and so that was very disheartening we realized that the there was a pipe that he was supposed to have put drilled down but because he thought that the area was Stony had a lot of stone he decided to take that um that pipe out so that your water was sipping into the well so when the pump when you pump it the water was actually like the carpet so by the time my pressure sister was coming it was looking like almost golden trying you know kind of once it settles you know how when you get dirty water it settles it's not very clean but it's kind of like that color so we had we were to look for another person to rectify that situation but we were so disheartened we really just committed into the Lord personally I was like Lord can't be do something Lord do something else we waited at one point we almost had someone go in to repair that but then you know something just didn't sound right didn't sit right and we canceled it so during this rainy season I asked my sister how the water was and he said well it's clean very clean I asked her I said well pump the water again so for the last two months it's been raining a lot and the water is perfectly clean so the Lord had our prayer and he fixed whatever it is I didn't want to give this testimony you know soon because I wanted to make sure that it was really done so the last and it's been still raining heavily heavily raining but the water is clean so glory and honor to the Lord [Applause] all right okay sister our coats is doing really good too so that's great we want to remember her every day every day I have one other prayer request here sister um Sherry Hamilton says that her husband Charles senior is going through a fight in his body this morning so let's remember him brother Lamont do you mind coming and praying over this and uh here I'll let you hope and touch it while you're praying and then we got one special this morning [Music] God bless you let us pray you precious Father which is uh thank you for the opportunity this morning Lord which is thank you for blessed to be in the president this morning which is thank you for protecting us at these dangerous highways and blessed to be here on time and for those who come after that Lord we just thank you for everything that offers things that you've done for these past couple weeks and you're working with serious words law which has blessed is opportunities to hear from you this morning Lord blessed is the hidden matter that you want to receive to us morning Lord blesses all to be wide awake Lord and blessings to be an impressed Lord just listen to each and every way Lord and the prayers request Lord is in the hearts Lord have mercy and heal the Lord you say the Lord and you said it in your word in your promise Lord blessed with those who are the tasks and offerings are the ones who desire the ones who couldn't give Glory of Lord and our prayer difficulties to the ones on the live stream the ones who's here the ones who could make it one desire to make it lower which is blessing each other was one just [Music] bless the pastor on this morning Lord for speak to us Lord and use them Lord and give us strength Lord even if you've got to go over time Lord bless us Lord and bless for our prayer that proposed to Charles Hamilton to see you Lord amen [Music] y'all might be seated now um I know the address for Rebecca's wedding next next Saturday has been on the board but it's it's kind of a hard background if you wanted to take a picture so I printed up something that would and put it out there that would make it um a little easier to see this morning so we look forward to it finally come on up brother sing this song okay man God bless you everyone a few weeks ago the Lord allows sister Laurel to say um how to battle his radiant more more and um sometimes you think that is something that you do sometimes or maybe this storm is coming because it's something that I did you're trying to correct me or bring me back in the middle of the road but uh the Lord had brother Kelly say last week how on Wednesday rather that when these things happen is God trying to perfect our character so I was in fellowship with my family last night and I said you know I believe that because it's getting so close you can't have the opportunity in God's kingdom to rule unless you have character so I said well Lord it seems to me that we're getting ready to rule because all of these things that are taking place so sometimes I get to a point like every other believer to where you just want to stay in a channel to just hear what God will have you do period you know not so much what the uh comes from the ministry but you want to catch what God is saying through the ministry to you as an individual and um I believe it's just to a point where no matter what condition that we're in we have to come to let the devil know whose side we're on regardless because even if he can't get us to a point to where he gets us to lose Faith he tries to tap into our spirit to get us to lose Joy sometimes so by God's grace I come to praise the Lord today I don't know what you come to do come on now y'all you and you and you and you I come to sing for a joy I come to sing for a job [Music] foreign [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I don't know and I don't know [Music] what to do foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] grateful Hallelujah Glory [Music] we come to hear him freak [Music] praise the Lord let's invite him out we'll invite our pastor out amen everybody happy [Music] good evening [Music] foreign [Music] foreign Lord I

begin to trouble again amen next Saturday Lord's willing we have sister Rebecca's wedding and the wedding is already scheduled from four o'clock to eight o'clock so be there in Christian time did you hear me I don't want to say your time I'm saying Christian time so don't get in the waiting at 6 p.m or 7 P.M we almost about to close everything so make way for the waiting from four to eight amen and they want me to remind you children 12 years old and up because they have to reserve and let me say this since I'm already handling this when they say sign up for something do not ignore it it's not a it's not it's not respectful we want you to put your name so we know how many people the venue is very strict they have to have a certain number of chairs and table and things like that so if you don't sign up and the day of the wedding if 20 I mean if 200 people sign up and they put 200 years then on the day of the wedding we have 25 or 30 people that showed up that didn't sign up now we

number or your name so somebody knows that so and so is coming stop avoiding or dodging and then popping up you're just creating a mess did you hear me so when we send the communication or an announcement make sure you respond not to read and leave it alone and then when we call you did you read it yes I got the message but you didn't respond stop glancing at the message do you know what classic means you didn't read it you just look and figure it out and then you ask the question so asking questions it's telling me you didn't read the message everybody okay the wedding from four to eight I'm just following the direction of whoever put the wedding amen amen amen [Applause] thank you let me go back to the scripture let's go back to Genesis [Laughter] oh my God you do good we won't have to repeat this thing over and over but I have two ways to work if we're still having a problem and the majority already is doing good I'm not going to repeat it I will come straight to you to the individual that is not doing it so I will spare the majority because when we speak from the pulpit people who think it's a lot of people doing that probably it's not so whoever is not doing that if you don't do it I will come straight to you I will give you a nice gorgeous wonderful call good morning how are you doing how are the children and everything and good did you eat today did you sleep good then we go straight to business why are you not signing up everybody okay so you don't want that phone call do what you got to do everybody okay I'm not a politician where I have to work with words and the word that is certain too much headache let's go to Genesis chapter 3. too much headache it's still having sounds back and forth if not my brother I'm good to use the Bazooka and I will be free we ready if not I can use the Bazooka and we free and the devil won't be keeping you busy on that iPad okay that's it if I'm overseas preaching I'm going to use the microphone to give me so I'm not going to have the fancy one we like it but we go with what we have to go the Lord knows why I have to leave it at home for some reason amen the devil has been fighting left and right left and right I was working on uh Thursday and decoding the Antichrist in Judah and after a while the man pump stopped working very last patient the Lord helped me to go straight just put it where he was and leave it alone we should be good amen can you lift it a little bit you don't want to praise God everybody okay okay so let's go what's that we should be good amen so the last Paul I mean the main Palm start working and I have to continue with the patient praise God I finished and I was like what so when you shut down it's like the whole office is stuck we just stop we can't work and I know he was the devil I went down and I prayed to the pump I put my hand and I pray for the pump that's your problem if you don't know what to do you were learning from now on I pray for the problem I went down and sat down after 15 minutes I turned the pump on and everything is working so I called the company to come and look and steal everything is working on on Friday they check everything is working stay alert to my friend you don't have a fight yet in the load amen Genesis chapter 3 verse 1. if you dare you can say Amen now the serpent was more subtle you might be seated than any beast of the field which the Lord God has made and he said to the woman yea as God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen did God ever spoke to the serpent God never spoke to the serpent God spoke to Adam amen but where did the serpent learn this everybody okay everybody okay so he learned it from somebody else we okay and we know in the Garden of Eden we have two trees I'm using a military aircraft so you need to have your helmet I hope you slept good I hope you had your breakfast and everything okay if I would have preached this on Wednesday some of you won't catch up because of the way things are coming I'm giving you some time a week purposely amen and let another Minister use the pulpit while you're still catching up and reviewing and soaking before we add more but you take the whole weekend you span it without doing what you're supposed to do and now you're lost now the serpent we know he starts speaking in the Garden of Eden we have two trees one was the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil who was that tree who was that tree he was the devil Satan now amen and we know Satan wanted to endure something we already went through that amen now the serpent begin to speak something about the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen who taught the serpent everybody okay according to brother Branham Satan entered the serpent everybody okay so this devil left from just being in the Garden of Eden the devil incarnated are you following me the devil incarnate the serpent and this serpent we know was a beast anybody here because the message that the serpent is speaking doesn't belong to him everybody okay everybody okay remember Peter was saying certain things and Jesus turned around Jesus never say get thee behind me Peter Jesus understood who was talking through Peter we okay glory to God verse 2 and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die so the woman had a voice but this is the voice of God because Eve was not there everybody okay glory to God and the serpents say to the woman you shall not surely die in other words the serpent contradicted God everybody care what I'm trying to get you understand is it is not the serpent do you follow me this serpent is a mouthpiece amen in other words the serpent is a prophet I'm going slowly I wish I can get where I want to take you to do amen you need to stay alert glory to God brother Branham say a prophet is a reflector of God did you hear me another word it's very easy for you to get confusion very easy for you to be confused everybody clear to make a difference between a prophet and God do you hear what I'm saying if you're not careful you can mistake a prophet to be God because the prophet reflects God but he is not God do you understand what I'm saying when David was saying my father my father why have Thou forsaken me was David crucified but David spoke like it's him but he was not David he was the spirit of God he was crushed in David everybody okay that's why the Bible said David was a prophet brother Branham say a prophet is a reflector of God he is made so that he cannot speak his own words [Applause] [Music] everybody okay he has to be God's word that he speaks he is just a water he's just like a reflector he is God water that's why the prophet usually he said that saves the Lord in other words I am not the one speaking this is God speaking through me God who in Sandra times an in diverse manner spoke to Our Father by the Hebrew 1 1. the Bible said in the book of Deuteronomy 18 that I will raise up them I will raise them up a prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee Moses and I will put my word in his water so God takes his words are we okay and he take those word and goes to the prophet and put in the mouth of the prophet anybody care so when the prophet is speaking it is not really the prophet speaking it is God that is speaking when the serpent is talking it is not the serpent it is the devil in the serpent are we okay the Bible says that I will put my word in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall do what and he spoke by the mouth of his water God speak through a prophet amen amen so when the serpent is contradicting the word of God the serpent was created by God amen and the only adversary we know of God was the devil amen so when the when the serpent begin to speak the language of the devil anybody here and begin to teach if about a different tree because in verse 4 5 the Bible says this is a serpent talking that for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing water the proud now the serpent become the prophet he became the teacher he became the prophet but because he's going contrary to the word of God he is a false prophet but here or he is a false teacher everybody care everybody okay another word this serpent you can have a difficulty separating him from Lucifer everybody okay that's why the Bible says this that the Great Dragon was cast out the water old shop and call who now the devil became the serpent ER anybody here not the new serpent the new serpent is the one that crawled but the old serpent the one that was talking and standing upright he says that the old serpent called the water the devil and water they're calling this serpent the devil and Satan because certain incarnated did I lose you into the devil into the into the serpent now the serpent becomes the devil or Satan amen at the beginning he was a serpent he was just a beast everybody okay but when certain incarnate the serpent the serpent becomes Satan because the serpent as a prophet he is a reflector he reflects Satan everybody okay everybody okay so number one we're moving from a devil into a false prophet [Music] we okay I know what I'm saying everybody good we good now he doesn't stop there he's going to move again verse 6 and when the woman saw after the teaching of the serpent amen when he saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit amen and did it we okay now we know that eating amen Now The Serpent and Eve are one foreign and Eve have made another unit we okay now now we have not only the serpent now he moved toward the immoral woman the woman so we have a beast who have United with a woman if you read the scripture you will see it coming up clear if you read the scripture I gave you you will see everything clear now everybody here from a spirit from a spirit incarnate into a beast we okay then the Beast combined with the woman we okay now we okay now when the beasts combine with the woman then she can go toward Adam it's from here if you pay attention and you go to what I already preach you can put the seals and you will be laughing the seals that you listen for I mean two years ago and you don't understand anything you can go right now and play the first seal the second seal that you will be dancing you know everybody okay now she did it comma and gave also to her water to her husband with her and he did what the scripture right here say that they gave to Adam and Adam eat how did Eve give to Adam did Eve just came and say Eve thought Adam everybody okay everybody okay jump to verse 11. God comes down and he said who told you that you were naked have you eaten off the tree in other words who told you who is who who revealed to you have you eaten off the tree whereof I commended you that you should not eat watch now we are tracing where it's coming from and the man say the woman he didn't say that Satan but the woman was already one with the Beast Adam didn't say the Beast gave it to me he didn't say Satan he's identifying the woman but he was not really the woman he was the serpent but he was not really the serpent he was the devil but the devil worked through those Avenue if you don't know you will be stuck at the woman and never discovered he was Satan everybody okay he said the woman whom you give to be with me she gave me of the tree amen and I did eat and the Lord God said to the woman what is this that you have done and the woman said the serpent began me and I did water everybody okay job to verse 17 and to Adam he said because you have hearken to the water so Eve didn't just give to Adam like that just like the serpent taught Eve everybody care Eve also turned around and taught Adam we okay so Eve become a prophetess I hope you are staying with me and you're not distracted if now is a prophetess everybody here what I'm trying to draw here is we're moving from one a spirit into number two a false prophet you following me into number three uh false prophetess all of this were in Eden that's why I brought Abraham said the seven syllables in Eden anybody okay so the devil moved from a spirit but how does he become a false prophet by incarnation we okay and then by immoral Union with the woman the woman becomes the false prophet the beast at the beginning we must go in the end and we must see the same pattern repeating we okay let's go to Daniel chapter 7. I cannot run with this Daniel chapter seven if you dare you can say amen I hope some of you you reviewed Daniel 2 and Daniel 3 and Daniel seven I didn't tell you to come up with a revelation just get the background get the information that's all and when we moving on you just it will come back to your memory like acid acid I see it and we keep moving amen verse two Daniel spoke and say I saw my vision in my vision by night and behold the Four Winds of Heaven you know what it means now strove upon the great sea you know what it means now remember they came from the sea remember s-e-a it's a c and the four Great beasts and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse in other words different one from another I'm gonna get the first one because you understand the other one now the first was like a lion and head water Eagle wings and I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked you understand what it means now and he was lift up from the Earth at the beginning you following me at the beginning of Daniel chapter 7. this first kingdom is a lion mixed with ego's wings we know that amen ego swings that's a lion and this is purely Beast anybody here but when they tell when they took the Eagle wings out you're following me this lion changed everybody here he stood like a man up here it was the heart of a beast so he can just behave like a beast anybody here but right here the scripture says that when the plug up those wings he was lift up from the earth and made stand upon defeat as a what as a man and immense water was water so he didn't have the man's heart to begin with he was given to him afterward everybody okay so he moved from a simple Beast into a human we okay we say human heart everybody here another word this spirit because it's an anointing it's a spirit that is on the country amen this anointing this spirit move from a spirit and incarnate a human we okay praise God and it beats the heart towards give an immense heart was given to him when they say a man heart was given to him it means that now he's a human because he didn't have a man's heart they gave it to him so he becomes somebody in other words when you talk to that person that person is not really the person you're talking to a spirit a beast in a human being but he looks like you everybody okay job to verse 17 the Bible says in verse 17 this great beasts which are four Are For What according to verse 17 the Beast are Kings jump to verse 23 thus he said the fourth Beast shall be the fourth Kingdom so in one way it's a king in another way it is a kingdom everybody here and King and kingdom are connected you cannot have a king without him having a kingdom did you hear me you cannot have a kingdom without a king king dumb King domain everybody okay a king with a domain Kingdom anybody care so it's sometime it will be a person do you do you follow me sometime he won't be a person he will be a kingdom let me say it clearly sometimes it is a person sometimes it is a denomination everybody okay King is a person kingdom is a doorman that the person is ruling anybody okay you need to know when is he the king and when is it a kingdom anybody here but just remember if you see the kingdom somewhere that King is there amen did you get it oh if you see that King just know that his kingdom is around do you follow me if you see the president of United State on 85 be careful there must be secret agent all around and they must be police officer that are watching him that are protecting him he cannot walk alone the last fourth rather was deaf and Hell follow him he cannot have death with the hair moving with him I will can let's go to revelation 18. Hallelujah glory to God if you read the scripture I gave you you're going to see things opening up themselves everybody come here these things these things you cannot overcome the Antichrist without these things you cannot play with the Antichrist with a Pentecostal gospel he was he will he will destroy you in a minute let me ask you a question what can you impress a Pentecostal church with speaking in tongues they already speak in tongue Miracle they have Miracle testimony they have testimony tell me what can you give them and their head begin to spin it is only the word only this message [Music] [Applause] you telling them about wearing long skirts some of them are wearing long skirt you don't impress them there is only one thing that you can impress them your language tell them let's go to the Book of Daniel let's go to the Book of Revelation awesome that's it that's right when you stop this message what are you going to impress the people out there what brand new you're gonna bring them the Bible they already handed the Bible some of them knows the Bible more than you what are you going to impress them oh we left the message that's fine go now go evangelize those people you won't get them they will congratulate you from leaving the message but they're going to stay in their Church you won't remove them from their Church to come to your church they're not going to come but with this message I can pull somebody from a Baptist out [Music] I can go in a Pentecostal even in the Muslim I can pull somebody out yes sir what new do you have to impress them [Music] revelation 18. and after these things are so another angel let's drop down to verse two and he cried madly with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and he's become the habitation of water and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage a garbage can it's a dumpsters of everything that is bad in other words something happened in Babylon that every demonic Spirit are converging into it every the entire Hill is now poor down there in other words if you want to find the hell if you want to find a bad Spirit an unclean Spirit a foul Spirit just go in Babylon but the kingdom of Babylon who was already destroyed where is Babylon the serpent was already destroyed in the Garden of Eden they changed the serpent to a snake so where is the serpent today do we need to go in the forest and begin to chase snakes you can chase them they won't talk to you they ain't talking no more foreign oh my God verse 3 for All Nation have drunk of the wine remember the wine last Sunday and the Kings the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth has committed fornication with her and The Merchant of the Earth have our works Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies in other words this woman become an agent that the devil is using to take care of the entire world a woman amen and I heard if I can I can go verse by verse in Revelation 18 and you will be even scared about the trade in this world [Music] everybody here every every trade that is going on is controlled by somebody [Applause] everything that is going on they control everything I can go through the scripture and prove to you and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that she be not partaker of her sin and that you receive not her plague drop to verse 16 and we pray and saying alas alas that great City so we must have a city today that is Babylon [Music] where is that City if it's a city it's a kingdom if it's a kingdom there is a king who is the king you are playing thinking this thing is outside the message you will realize why people are leaving the message you are playing everybody okay that great city that was clothed in fine learning and purple and Scarlet and Deck with gold and precious stone and water all I want you to remember there is there is a fun landing there when you look spiritually there is a fine learning I mean naturally there is a fun landing in the city what does finally means how can a cage of unclean bird of evil spirit of bad thing be wrapped up in fine learning so when you look it's a fine Lennon but under the fan learning it's hell oh my God hey everybody Kia everybody Kia it's hell that's why we keep telling you take your high heel off take yourself off you don't get it you are caging spirit you will remember me one day even in front of God that I told you the truth everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what any man that you give ability to do Can Do Lord father but we are stuck right here and we need the Holy Spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children we commit everything unto their hand be the Alpha and the Omega remove every unclean Spirit from this place in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'm going to remind you again the Bible says script brother Branham say scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record in the Bible it's there for the anointed eyes to see it's there for her never put a scripture like it's there it's unnecessary it is there for a purpose my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the Incarnation and ego's wings the incarnations and egos wings there was an incarnation in the Garden of Eden there was in an incarnation in the Book of Daniel there is an Incarnation that will have to deal with the wings of an ego everybody okay we are still in the trashing floor still dealing with the ten virgin and the second oil but we are very very deep brother Branham says this he says all cults I know why I keep rebounding you this and uprises and all these things and ISM today not back in the day today in other words everything you see today by God's grace every one of them everything you see today written in Genesis where he had its beginning back there he just got another setting is this spirit Lucifer is this spirit the devil is this Spirit the old serpent is still the same spirit it just changes name but it's still the same devil everybody okay brother Branham said but you watch the working of the spirit in that day go back to Eden see what happened and watch it working today and you shall see it is the very same thing and you will be surprised to know that some of these spirit are in the highest ecclesiastical they are very inside the church but you expect them to be in a nightclub anybody care I don't go to nightclub I don't watch not club stuff but the devil can bring a sister here that looks just like the woman in the nightclub with high heel with tight dresses with tight stuff in other words he's bringing the the nightclub inside the church you need to understand it is not the sister but the spirit upon the sister is the same spirit that is working in a nightclub you follow me foreign language we found out that we have three parts and we are very very very very very deep into the holiest amen last Sunday we added the water we added the blood and we added the spirit now we can say roof deciding all roof in the water our roof under justification or roof in a new heart it is the same thing it's just got another name everybody okay everybody okay according to the book of roof it's roof serving according to the three words of God of Grace it is roof under sanctification according to Ezekiel it's roof in a new spirit according to First John it is Ruth under the blood everybody okay according to roof it's roof resting according to the three works of Grace is roof under the baptism of the Holy Spirit according to Ezekiel its roof under my spirit according to First John it is Ruth under the spirit because these three elements are the one somebody is born with you are born with the word breaking and then the blood comes and then the spirit entered the baby that's the new birth right there in the Tabernacle everybody okay but you can be in the water with other brother or you can be in the blood without the spirit you must be here then you know for sure that you are saved any question glory to God in our parable of the ten virgin we found out that the Midnight Cry triggered three things which was that the Virgin arose we explained to you that justification then they trimmed their lamp that was sanctification but the main thing was to make sure that they have the oil anybody care and this oil is not the first oil the first oil is good but it was a Noel for the engagement everybody okay you need the second oil because the second oil is the oil that unites you with the bridegroom it is the bridegroom oil it is the male anointing I will get down to that later on everybody here because God is both male and female I will go down I won't touch it today I know if I dig into it you're gonna be lost let me leave it alone we coming down to that but it is the anointing of the bread groom because when they were looking for somebody to open the seals no one was found worthy everybody okay no one was worthy in heaven no one was Worthy on the earth no one was worthy underneath the Earth the only one was worthy was dilemma and the lamb is a man it is a male it is the bridegroom himself everybody okay he's the only one that can break the seal and when he break the seals he releases the Thunders and when the pandas are revealing the Thunder bring you rapturing faith everybody okay glory to God brother Branham says this if you notice here in verse 10 the Bible says that the bridegroom came and they that were water what makes them ready what makes them ready was not because they Rose that was part of the process because the other Virgin also he rose they all trim their lamp but what makes them ready was the second oil there was something in that second oil that gave you boldness to see the king come on brother Branham said there is there is your five wise virgin who had oil in the water that oil is water but rapturing faith comes by the pandas and the Thunders comes by the breaking of the seal and the only one who can break the seal is the Lamb it is the fair from the male that's fine my friend you will get it later everybody okay glory be to God that's why the Bible says that let us be glad and do water and give honor to him for the water stop let me go back again to Matthew the bridegroom came and they that were water went into water let's go back again to 19 for the marriage of the water and his wife has made herself scripture don't play with words what makes you ready is the second order with that the first oil is good everybody care but the festival is unable to stop death Paul died I Rangers died Columbia died more than die Martin Luther die even brother Branham die but because the second oil came there is another people that will not die [Music] everybody okay remember Adam die set die everybody die until Enoch that's why Enoch had Rapture in faith because Enoch have something that can overcome death foreign [Applause] and not only does he stop death but he goes back to Power and they walk everybody bring the resurrection to everybody that was there it's just a matter of time when the Rapture time comes you will see what this oil will be doing everybody okay so far glory to God why are you taking me my friend brother Branham says this he said the beast from the beginning he was the beast in the Garden of Eden in the Garden of Eden we found Satan incarnating the Beast then the Beast became the first prophet then he goes and unite to a woman and the woman become a prophetess everybody okay but the problem is after this God came and destroyed the serpent but the system was never destroyed Satan must find another Beast and another woman that he will be working with anybody here you can destroy the vessel but the spirit continue to move on the working of the spirit is still the same but remember it will change name everybody okay brother Branham say at the end it is a water it's a king and a water and it's a kingdom we okay now buckle up because I'm going up we okay if you go to Second Thessalonians chapter two Paul was already afraid Paul says the church started I'm afraid because the church is going to fall and we found out already that the church fell is nothing I already gave you the scripture now Paul says it here that now I will beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together until I'm talking about the coming of the bridegroom and we being united with him what are you talking about Paul Paul said that he be not soon shaken in man Paul was preaching that the Lord is coming but after a while Paul looked he said no no no no no no no no no no no he's not coming now church I don't want anybody to trouble you like the Lord have come he won't come now everybody okay he said I don't want you to be shaken in man or be trouble neither by Spirit nor by word no but let the ass from us as the day of who the coming of the Lord is what let no man deceive you by any mean why for that day foreign coming the coming of Jesus Christ that day Paul said that it shall not come except they come a water so before Jesus Come A Falling Away must happen [Applause] before the coming of the Lord comes number one we must see a falling away somebody must Fall Away we okay we talk about that falling away to the denomination we find what's happening now everybody here somebody must go away they're falling away except they shall come falling away first number one comma not only a falling away and that the man of sin be water two things must happen there must be a falling away first and after the falling away we must have the revelation of the man of sin amen the pure language here Paul is telling you that Jesus will not come if the somebody the church have not Fallen yet you following me you're following me but after the falling of the church God will break the seals you follow me and reveal Satan amen so when you see Satan being revealed just know now that the bridegroom is ready to come do you understand he says this the son of water Judah was already dead Judah was the son of perdition right but Judah was already dead this is Paul so there is another Son of Perdition this man of sin is the son of perdition but we know that Judah already died and the Bible said Judah was the son of perdition so whoever was in Judah everybody okay will do what again he will come back again just like the spirit that was in Jesus came back to the church on the day of Pentecost the spirit that was in Judah must also come back again into the church we okay let me continue verse 8 and then shall die water that person is not only a man of sin the terminology is changing it's the same person he's a man of sin he is the Son of Perdition he is a wicked one remember Cain the son of the which was the son of the devil so if the son of the wicked one was the devil so who is the wicked one and who is the man of sin and who's the son of perdition do we must have fall the devil before Jesus come [Applause] but here so Paul is saying before Jesus Christ come the devil will do something in the church but here but God will not let him be hidden and continue to destroy the church God will finally open the whole thing out and call his children and say come this is the man that was doing this all along this is him right here everybody okay glory to God it's getting juicy my friend everybody okay Dave saw and that Wicked one will be water to reveal unfold so the seals must be broken reveal whom the Lord shall consume with water of water stop does your mouth have a spirit [Music] I'm asking you a question So when you say Jesus that's a spirit that's Jehovah Witness everybody here how can you destroy something with the spirit of your mouth so your spirit is in your mouth you need a prophet what does it mean the spirit in the mouth oh thank you okay glory to God the Bible says this brother Robin that in Revelation 19 that out of the mouth of Jesus God's water [Applause] [Music] we okay out of the mouth of Jesus Christ what comes out of it a sharp it goes a sharp sword that we fit with the sword he should water so it's a sword that will destroy you and Paul is saying that the wicked one will be destroyed by the spirit of the mouth of God but out of the mouth of God we don't see the spirit but we see the sword so brother Stephen do you mean the sword means the Spirit hold on your break let's go back to the Bible the Bible says this in Ephesians 6 brother Robert 17 and take the water and the water of the water the sword of the water so the spirit have a sword so when they say Jesus Christ will destroy with the spirit of his mouth it is the sword in his mouth and the sword which is the water [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so now let's go back to our scripture again glory to God so that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with water with the sword everybody here and remember in Sabino Canyon the sword came down [Music] [Applause] everybody here remember the vision of Junior Jackson The Sword came down so we have what can destroy the Antichrist everybody here everybody here but before you destroy him you must identify him you must unfail him and see where he is and now you pull the sword and you begin to chop him everybody okay anybody lost it's a military aircraft my friend I'll praise God everybody okay everybody okay the spirit of his man shall destroy with the water of water he's coming even him who's coming after the working of who the working of who Satan with all power sun and water everybody okay that's why you need that second oil can I continue praise God let's go here let me pull this one oh my God I'm already in the Milky Way so keep keep your seatbelt tight we're gonna pass the Milky Way everybody okay glory to God we find according to Daniel anybody here we got we we found Daniel 2 and Daniel 7. Daniel 2 was dealing with the natural Kingdom which is the which are the political Kingdom amen that's that was Daniel 2 Daniel 7 was dealing with the spiritual or the Unseen World amen you see Putin doing something but spiritually it's something else amen if you go spiritually you will see a bear moving back here when you go down in the earth you look you will see Putin moving in the earth you say put in it will go back spiritually you'll see a bear roaring and when you look you will see the bear is blowing wind because he's approaching Ukraine everybody okay everybody okay that's a prophetic language everybody okay so according to the spiritual here everything was clear we moved from a girl to Silver to Brass to iron iron with Clay everything clear but on the spiritual the last one was not clear we went to the Book of John and John unfolded to us and when John unfolded to us it was just a mixture of number one plus number two all of them he give you number four number one plus number two plus number three equal number four in other words the strength of a lion [Music] and the strength of the bear and the strength of the leopard all this strength pulled up together in one Beast brother Branham says this glory to God brother Branham says this brother Branham says that John singing and the end of the Gentile ruling all four of those beasts represented in water damn same old water and what that possess each weapon so all these demonic spirit converge into one and I'm gonna remind you something this kingdom are full we okay the first was the Babylonian Kingdom the second was the middle pressure there's uh the the third was the Christian the fourth was wrong it doesn't means that other country did not exist you're following me other country existed but remember last Sunday we found out that God taught every country that you must be under Nebuchadnezzar but here in other words this kingdom are the power dominating the entire world even though you might have your country maybe from Africa maybe from Europe maybe from America maybe from South America all those countries will be dominating by one can you follow me up in Revelation 13. glory to God I'm telling you this so you know glory to God I'm good don't tell my friend it's just I'm almost passing the Milky Milky Way so keep moving everybody okay Revelation 13 verse 2. you there are we talking about this Beast and the Beast which you saw was like to a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth has the mouth of a lion everybody okay everybody okay let me stop right there if you notice this Beast here is a mixture of the tree but every one of these beasts have the power to dominate the entire world we okay drop now to verse 7. I want everybody to see this you there and he was given to him to that Beast it's a hymn it's a male Beast everybody okay it's a male anointing that's why you need a male anointing to fight him everybody here because the woman fell in the Garden of Eden because Satan dodged Adam he knew who was in Adam everybody okay everybody okay if you leave the serpent with Eve Eve will be down you need an anointing from Adam when a serpent sees Adam that's a different anointing but Adam and Eva one [Applause] are we okay are we okay I wonder what do you do at night to sleep in church under an anointing like this if you keep struggling you need to come and see me something is wrong in your life we can be playing everybody okay okay praise God job to verse 7. and he was given to him to make war with the water and to do what so even Ascent cannot stand before this anointing that's right I'm going slowly he will kill him everybody okay can I continue to overcome them and power watch this was giving him all the water all Kindred and water and water so this Kingdom you can't help it even if you are born in Australia your country will be under his anointing watch verse eight he said and all that dwell upon the Earth everybody shall worship Him whose name you okay are not water in The Book of Life of the Lamb not just the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life everybody here in other words those whose name are in the lamps book of life will never fall under the domination of this anointing foreign [Music] make sure your name was in The Book of Life but to reveal your name the seals must be broken and when the seals are broken they are pulling your name and when you recognize your name automatically you are coming out of Babylon come out of here my people come out of here my people [Applause] so this message is the only thing that can pull you out of Babylon the message of William Marion Branham [Applause] [Music] [Applause] some people are ashamed of this message I am not ashamed of this message I am identified with William Marion Branham [Music] [Applause] that's the only message that can take you out of Babylon [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] you don't want to hear his name you can find another church [Applause] you cannot subscribe oh no [Laughter] glory to God everybody okay everybody okay so some will be under Babylon but let them heal their name when they hear their name the feathers of Babylon are shaken completely off and they're coming out of it but here so every Kingdom that you see here will dominate the world regardless of what you want and if this kingdom are demon it means that every Kingdom every country is under the dominance of Satan you don't understand me America is understanding Africa is under certain you represent the Satan that's why it's certain control everything [Music] can I continue I'm using a bazookaban everybody okay [Music] let me help you up let's go to the scripture listen to Luke and the devil taking him Jesus up into a mountain high into a high mountain show unto him water [Music] everybody here that's why we must be born again you must be born again you must be out of Moab you must be out of your country if you are an American you must be born again so the American Spirit can be of if you come from Africa you must be born again so that the African Spirit can be lift off because every country is under the devil that's why you must be born again [Applause] so in this church don't bring me your American way don't bring me your African way don't bring me your real bring me Jesus and the message of Yahweh [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] what are you doing with politics all the time you even are bold to be posting the politics I'm supporting the country which country are you supporting which country are you supporting I'm having the flag of my country I'm gonna dance with the flag of my country [Music] you're gonna go with your country to hell [Applause] we so and so we do stuff like this we who [Music] we are Sons and Daughters of God [Music] [Applause] can I continue that's why the Bible say out of every Kingdom Every Nation continue with your politics you leave church you go and you begin to update quickly what happened in the politics what is next in the polity you can sit and talk in the politics like you are inside politics I'm going to help you this morning can I continue the Bible says all Kingdom of the world in water he has the database he have the database of everything everybody here and the devil say all this water the beasts represent water all this power will I give thee and therefore that is what he was given to the devil [Music] he was given to me and to whomsoever our water so the devil have a right to do whatever he want to do and the Bible says in John Hereafter I would not talk much with you this is Jesus for the water of this water water and has water it's two separate Kingdom that's why he's the prince of this world brother Branham says this I hope he's going to set somebody free he says the whole creation was lost we just went through it in the seventh seal the whole creation was lost everything was water it's all belonged to water where did Brother Branham get it but here he fell water that's why he said he was delivered to me Satan was not talking to you Satan was talking to Jesus Christ and telling Jesus Christ that this entire word was given to me and Jesus never contradicted him who are you who are you when we say take your head of politics you don't understand you see people bragging my president my president they want to dress like the president they want to walk like the president shame on you he says he fell hell to it and he's still water he certainly does that is the reason we are fighting and having all this water he control every Kingdom Satan does every water everyone every water controlled by who the whole world is controlled and run by who that is the reason we have the trouble we have he said any Bible student can tell you that Satan the Bible itself says he did that he controlled there I gave you the scripture he said but Christ will fall hair to it for now he is a redeemer and he come to redeem the water and nothing could do it but who brother Branham politics how Democrat Republican and all is water [Applause] listen to me carefully I respect your position but don't bring it to this church keep your Democrat outside of the city keep your Republican outside of the church [Applause] [Music] everybody okay he said what it is it is a bunch of water every person working in it that is not born again is of death [Applause] your president is born again the president that you love in Europe is he born again the president you love in Africa is he born again you even argue and fight for a president that doesn't know you that President doesn't even know you [Music] can I continue hate me all right everybody okay buddy I'm in fight all the time so if a new fighter don't worry ah because my sword is already blazing [Applause] yeah I'm not gonna play them no no no no no no no I was born for war [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Belongs to Me Jesus never debated him with him the world is controlled by the devil and every man that works for the government if he are a Christian he's after and working father but here this nation will all fall to Jesus Christ when he comes there will be a water [Applause] everybody okay what are you trying to say brother Stephen ever Every Nation here is a pagan Nation Pagan Nation Gentile none of them begging all of them and all of them controlled by Satan the Babylonian was destroyed the middle pigeon was destroyed the Greek Empire was destroyed the Roman Empire was destroyed but if you watch in the Roman place there is two categories [Music] yes what are you saying the first kingdom was pure gold no mixing the second kingdom was pure silver no mixing the third was pure brass no mixing the fourth one here pure iron but when they get here [Applause] [Music] what I'm trying to say is the fourth Kingdom have two phases [Music] everybody here he have a faces that it's completely pagan it's completely Gentile just like the Babylonian the middle pigeon and the Greek Empire but this Kingdom sleeps this Pagan kingdom is pure iron just like everything was pure gold pure silver pure breath pure iron but at the feet it is a mixture of iron and clay so this Kingdom at the beginning will look Pagan and after a while it will flip foreign what are you talking about brother Stephen brother Branham says this he said let's we could go back to Daniel and get the image look at the image the head of gold the Babylonian Kingdom silver medals Persian brass Alexander the Great and so forth the Grecian Kingdom then the Roman Empire Eastern and water the water everybody okay let me go back right here eastern and western everybody okay let me go back again to the court Jesus Christ he says notice in these ten kingdoms the ten toes everybody here the ten toes which exactly Come Those ten what I'm going slowly I'm going slowly did you read the scripture I gave you if you write them you will be happy this morning brother say defeat ghettos you got five here and you got five here all of them makes water and the Beast had also ten horn for some reason so we got tentos and we got ten horns where are we going brother Stephen glory to God Prada pranam says that the 10th Kingdom he said those ten horns that we were speaking of this morning each one of those ten kingdoms that was to water everybody okay remember in the image it is gentles okay that is in the natural but in the spiritual we found a beast that is like a leopard like a bird about I mean a bear and then like a lion but he have ten horns you gotta know that it is the same Spirit it is just changing form in the image it is tentos in the animal it's ten horn the toes and the horns are one do you follow me do you follow me We Are Chasing the Devil everybody okay he says they were iron and water mixed together and that iron comes from the leg which was water there is a streak of romanism mixed in water remember every nation unless you are in the book of the lamb every nation you have a power amen Every Nation there is and the water through the water [Applause] let's go slowly Catholic Church is not a pagan it is a religious [Music] everybody here so the last Kingdom flips from a pure Pagan into a religion when it's pure Pagan it is iron and when we're speaking about Rome as a kingdom today we are calling that Italy going slowly the country Rome today is Italy let me ask you a question does Italy dominate the world does Italy have the strength to fight America does Italy have the strength to fight even in Germany but how is Italy dominating the world it is not Italy the Kingdom of Italy was destroyed already the Beast is no longer in Italy he controlled the world but it's not Italy you need to find him in a religious world but in Rome do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me if you go by rum they say Greek the Greek nation is today do you see Greek dominating anybody it doesn't dominate anybody if you go to the Iranian and thinks you will see the Babylonian do you see Iran dominating the world it is not the irony anymore Italy doesn't dominate the world but there is something that dominate the world America is dominating the world where is America in the scripture you see now Russia is dominating where is Russia in the Bible we okay now we okay now so the last Kingdom flips from a pagan to a religion we okay according to the image of Daniel everybody okay according to the image of Daniel we okay this change from Iron pure to mix of iron of clay is a flipping of the Roman Empire from Rome Pagan to Rome Papa this is according to the image but if you go here it is also expressed another way it is not expressed by Iron and Clay over there remember here we have ten tools but here the toes are called there on so here it is a flipping there is a flip here so what is the flipping in this animal glory to God brother Branham says this everybody okay he says this he says the head of gold was Nebuchadnezzar then Darius the middle Persian taking the gentle Kingdom over then the middle prison was what the Greek Alexander the Great and so forth they greet him the Grecian Kingdom over then what took it over from the Greek duh and who had ruled their work the gentle word ever since Roman Roman that was water that's Pagan Rome we okay then notice Rome exists to the end but if we look today Italy is not strong even in Europe it's a small country the country of Italy is not dominating the world but according to the Bible Rome will dominate the world but Italy the country doesn't dominate the world so when is that Rome that dominated the country the world the Bible says this that it exists because he went to the end of what and we sin mad clay that is what what we are made out of and iron the strength of water run in every one of those Nations Rome has a strength in every nation underwater let me continue where we started according to Revelation 13 the Bible say this Beast this Beast right here this one says he moved from here to the toes it is Pagan to religion here what is the code 10 toes ten horns everybody okay brother Branham say the Bible says I saw one of his head as he was water and his deadly wound was water and the whole world did water [Applause] so when you go in the natural side you look at the Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar when you look you see Iron flipping to iron and clay that is politically speaking when you change you go spiritually you look you see ten horns here 10 toes brother Branham say it is the same thing it just changed the name we okay watch The Working of the spirit you will see it's the same thing but what about the flipping about the flipping in the animal we found that one of the head of the animal was completely killed everybody here but for some reason that animal that was completely dead and the animal continues what is the flipping in the image in the Beast it is the wound and the healing of the wound if I don't do this you can read brother Branham and you don't understand what is going on now brother Branham say Satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts the beach that was wounded unto death but live again is Imperial Pagan room you understand it is the same language it's just using different symbols Nebuchadnezzar when he sees he sees the iron and the toes with iron and Clay Daniel when he sees he see a wound and the wound heal the wound is the destruction of Roman Pagan but when he revived again and he continued to leave he's no more Pagan anymore he's now a religion everybody okay he says it is an imperial Pagan room that fell to the onslaught of the Barbarian and death and thereby lost their power her temporal power but she regained it into water do you see it the nation that ruled by crushing and which became the strongest empire ever know was finally wounded to death they destroy Rome her power was gone physically as a control of the that's why Italy cannot control the world with his army but here physically but I'm the Constantine she came back to for pepper Rome has water the water and has power her power is water so what you need to trust now is not the country of Italy because the Beast already flipped you need to go with his flipping anybody here because if you don't if you don't if you chase the serpent you find that he's in a woman you need to know how you're chasing him back for you to catch him when he finished with the serpent he left the serpent God destroyed the serpent but Satan is free if you keep going to the serpent the serpent has nothing anymore he already changed he's no longer in the snake he's now in another system you need to follow which system he is it did I lose you did I lose you I'm still good in time I already passed the Milky Way so now I'm down towards Pluto toward Uranus so keep that with me everybody okay glory to God what are you trying to say brother Stephen glory to God what are you trying to say brother Stephen everybody here brother Branham says this one he says and there was nothing said about communism when you look at the image he spoke about where a Babylon middle Persian Greek ROM do you see communism rum conquered the world watch carefully Jesus Christ was born in the water are we okay now are we okay now when Jesus Christ was born in a Roman Kingdom

the seventh trumpet is standing everybody okay I'm gonna flip the airplane stay alert glory to God the Bible brother Branham say under the Fist of the trumpet we went through this I'm just going to remind you he said under the seventh trumpet is to Israel the same as the words to water what we call the seventh seal that opened and revealed the devil Israel called that the seven water so as soon
