lord thank you lord i didn't receive any written testimonies this evening but i did have one on my heart i had an accident um ski snowboarding a couple weeks back and i hit my back real hard and i had pain for a while and i was like maybe i should go get this looked at and i'm like nah i'm fine i'm fine and i finally decided to go get it looked at because i have another trip coming up and i'm like i need to feel better before i go on this next trip so i had an x-ray done and they said that it looks like i might have fractured a bone in my back and but i just want to stake the claim i heard he did it personally but i want to do it publicly i want to thank the lord for my healing i know he's healed me i already told my wife i said i don't plan on taking this any further i'm claiming my healing i know the lord will do it he's done it for me before he'll do it again he's the same yesterday and forever so i just want to thank for my healing this evening pain comes and goes but but i i believe i'm healed so i thank the lord i don't want to look at the circumstance i want to look at the promise we're going to ask brother mike if you come lead us in a word of prayer this evening and amen praise the lord [Applause] i felt led to call you this evening in case you had a song special after but i don't want to put you on the spot we did have a prayer request for marshall bartlett marshall bartlett's mom has colon cancer he works at my husband's shop so we just want to remember that prayer request there's no name on it but god knows who it is and we just want to keep that need in prayer and for the tithes and offerings it's good to be back in the house of with lords sense of like precious faith um it's good to see family and friends on my trip to england and um you know just being available for the lord to do his thing through flesh just when i lift up a friend of mine his wife is in hospital in miami her name is cynthia williams and let's bow our heart in prayer heavenly father we are once again very grateful lord to be able to come before thy throne but lord we don't come with empty hands lord and there's nothing that we can give maybe our praise is lord god but you provided yourself a sacrifice you provided the blood which makes the way for us lord covering our sins and removing them lord casting them into the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more father as we come to thee and give you praise today lord for that you are doing lord god in this end time as we look on it lord god we just want to lift up um the sister lord god with colon cancer father you said to abram is there anything too hard for thee to do father we are standing upon thy precious promises lord god that you have given to us which will never fail as we lift her up unto you lord and also sister cynthia with our heart trouble lord lord you are the god that can be touched by our infirmities we lift them up to you lord god and believing in our heart not in our mind lord that you will hear our prayer and grant our request unto them father we pray for the blessing upon this meeting tonight lord god that you take flesh lord god and use it just dress yourself with it lord god and speak to us lord god bless our hearts to receive it lord and the lips of the speaker to bring it forth father we pray a blessing upon the offering that he given here tonight lord may you have your perfect will and way tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen y'all may be seated as they come and gather i believe brother robert had a special for us this evening if brother robert wants to make his way up maybe next wednesday brother mike maybe next wednesday for a special all right god bless everyone it's a privilege to stand here again all the lord has been doing for us uh this song came in my heart this week as we've been looking at everything a lot has been unfolding and as brother stephen was saying that um he's going to shake the boat but it's really not bruh stephen shaking is the lord is doing the shaking you know yes we are listening to brother chad some time ago talking about the headstone those who fall on the stone will be broken but if it falls on you it grants you the powder so it's better to fall on the stone let it break you that is what's supposed to happen if you push and you have your way and let it fall on you not good amen praise the lord amen this song is about that that um image that daniel saw that nebuchadnezzar saw actually coming all the way down from the head to the ten toes to the time we are living in and as the prophet said the ten toes was represented after the second world war so we know that is our time and a stone was cut out of the mountains without hands the trusted zombie a blessing to you yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place but there are some who stood with ladies and orion in every age who kept their first estate and though the powers of heaven are shaken we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved or that can be shaken will be shaken let thy word lord shake us into place [Music] the heavens declare the glory of god [Music] night on tonight it showed knowledge for they are all in god's perfect peace oh but tell me what will happen if the moon should leave her place then the face of the earth would be a dark and chaos again so what about the earthly hosts who were made in the image of god if we are not in order how can we do the works of god [Music] yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and many stars are being moved out of place [Music] but there are some who stirred but ladies and gents [Music] in every age kept their first day [Music] the world is again [Music] falling apart and soon the millennium will be our shedding but this kingdom will be in you spiritually before it comes in the earth literally for in the days of the tentos came a rock struck without hands despite every image in our earth made by man oh i know you're not the kingdom of the lord is in you for the stone did not only smite but grew into a mountain too yet once more lord shake not just heaven but earth and every star you're being moved out of place but there are some who stayed with ladies and gents in every age we kept our first estate [Music] we were like dry bones down in the valley then the son of man came with a prophecy and out of his mouth came seven thundering voices that quickened to bring to life this scattered body demon noise and the shaking as his bone came to his bone sinew and flesh skin came upon it but it had no life of its own but then he prophesied again the dynamics came into that body and so tonight we can stand a mighty marching on me [Music] yet once more lord oh shake not just heaven earth and many stars are being moved out of place but we are those who stood with ladies and orion in this last age we've kept our first estate and though the power of heaven are shaking we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved all that can be shaken will be shaken but let thy word lord shake us into place [Music] let thy word lord shake us into place let thy word lord shake us into place [Music] amen i want to be shaken the place where god wants me to be amazing grace shall always be my song a praise for it was grace [Music] [Music] i do not know [Music] just the way he came to love me so i love this next line he looked beyond all my faults [Music] to view the cross [Music] where jesus died for me the grace that caught [Music] all my [Music] knees god's grace that brought me out of darkness [Music] hands to his life can clearly see [Music] i'll shout it from [Music] [Music] let satan hear it this evening that he looked beyond [Music] all our faults and so far i shall forever [Music] i wonder if you could stand with me this evening and sing it to view the cross [Music] marvelous [Applause] is [Music] let's do that course one more time as we invite our pastor to come this evening [Music] to view the cross where jesus and that for me [Music] [Music] he looked let's do those last two lines again he looked beyond my phone [Music] my knees do you believe it tonight let's give them a clap off hallelujah [Music] you shall forever forever lift your eyes to calvary half fitted is that brother evil because on sunday you're going to see summer what calvary have done for you amen how many caught were we going amen how many understand the direction few people a few people you might be seated i need to get a ten minute and then we move on amen because i don't want anybody to get lost because on sunday we're going to dig again amen amen blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah thank you jesus it's not complicated it's just a multi-directional aspect that brother branham took that makes it a little bit harder for people amen amen i don't want you to read the quote and read another quote and think that those two quotes are contradictory i don't want you to do that amen amen it's still the same it's just you need to read and study brother brown i'm pretty good with the eyes of the holy spirit then everything else will blend together amen this is a deep deep big subject and it's the hardest one in the message the holy ghost amen amen we preach about it people preach about it we spoke about it we went to the prayer line people fell down and still no holy ghost amen amen we need to recalibrate our shooting and see what are we missing then we know how we're doing amen hallelujah somebody's tired all right we landed with roof i'm just going to take 10 minutes and then we go roof was living in her mother's home i want to do this so somebody can catch up easily in her mother house and that was the house of idolatry amen her and hope orpah everybody okay then they move from the house by marriage and they enter into the house of naomi amen amen by entering into the house of naomi they entered into the camp but they are not in the tabernacle yet amen our beginnings still remain the tabernacle and we will be traveling in the tabernacle with ezekiel with john with roof all of those things and the more we travel it gives you more aspect about the holy ghost and the stages of grace amen amen in the tabernacle we know that they are the court and we have also the holy place and the holiest you're coming from the east everybody here the other court we found out that brother branham explained to us that it's justification and then the holy place brother branham say it was sanctification and then we found out that the holiest is the baptism of the holy spirit amen amen all of these apply to an individual amen everybody care amen it doesn't go to the church you must make a difference between the individual and the church everybody okay when we're dealing with the churches we have four stages did you get it yes sir amen i'm trying to help you because on sunday we're moving again deeper so with individual you got three stages because we are a tabernacle ourself we got the body we got the soul we got the spirit amen the body is your other court the soul ah the spirit is the holy place and the soul is the holiest everybody okay but when you're dealing with the church as an age because you as an individual you as a tabernacle you are the bride of jesus christ amen but you are not the only one it's a many members brother and those broad started all the way from paul all the way to laodicea everybody clear so when we talk about the church ages we go through four stages the first age is luther you get it is luther and from luther you go through wesley everybody okay from wesley you go through pentecost remember this is pretty good and from pentecost you enter the broad age everybody okay so far so this is where brother branham said that justification made the way to sanctification make sense don't apply it here you're going to get lost amen everybody okay the stages of grace for an individual remain three because god is perfected in three but when it comes to the church ages that's when you get forward anybody okay did i lose somebody this is where brother branham said that justification made way to sanctification and sanctification made way to the baptism of the holy ghost this baptism is for the restoration of the gifts this is what happened in azusa street when the holy ghost came and the gift of the spirit came back to the church because those gifts were lost god restored the gift and people began to speak in tongues interpret and doing all kinds of stuff everybody okay the non-gift of the spirit then the baptism of the holy ghost make way to the holy ghost himself everybody care this is where brother branham said the shark i mean the tesla the what is the next one but robert the blade the torso this is the shark pentecost and this is the seed the grain anybody here so the error we've been coding this quote here telling the people justification make way to sanctification sanctification make the way to the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost made way to the holy ghost when you preach that to people you must be specific amen because it looks like you're telling somebody you're going to have the baptism of the holy ghost then you're going to have the holy ghost again and when you go through other sermon brother branham said the baptism of the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the same thing now you get confused because you applied it wrong amen everybody here for human being the baptism of the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the same thing everybody okay anybody okay but for the church ages the church has an age everybody okay you need to understand these differences everybody okay so far did we lose somebody did we help you up so roof move from her mother if it's ten minutes you tell me about robert roof move from do you see that you can go back there if you want to roof moved from her mother house from idolatry all the way to naomi's house a man where she was in the camp of israel but she's not in the tabernacle yet anybody okay when she left the house of naomi and went into the way of return you remember on sunday the way of return through judah anybody okay that's where she made the decision everybody okay and brother branham said when ruth made the decision that is justification did you hear so brother brandon was telling you that when ruth was taken or making a decision she was already in the other court because in the other court when you enter the gate the first thing you see is the brazen altar everybody okay then you see the level you must repent here and then you can be baptized everybody okay so once you get here the other court have many aspects we spoke about the light of the other court we spoke about you being in justification there is a snake that is still there you still filthy but god removed the guiltiness that's why you can live and clean and you still come to church you're still right here amen but that stage also doesn't stop in that if i stop right there this is all you're going to remember and when you see brother brown i'm speaking in a different direction you will miss it so the other direction is under this stage right at the beginning of that stage you must make a decision amen this is when we tell people you need to come to the altar but if you don't explain that altar correctly the people will get to the altar by emotion everybody here that's why brother branham said billy graham will have 30 000 people converted and then the next year all of them are gone this is the reason why you see people in the message for 20 years and after a while the message is wrong they don't believe the message again and they go out they didn't have the holy ghost amen amen here when you are sealed with the holy ghost you can never be lost again you are here until the day of redemption everybody okay so if you get here you need to check what was the decision that was taken here because brother branham said on sunday that the decision you take here will either take you to hell or it's gonna take you to the baptism of the holy spirit if you move here wrong like judah you can progress here but you're gonna get blocked to someone amen everybody okay so far cornelius was a good man cornelius was a sanctified man no holy ghost anybody okay amen do you know how many disciples saw jesus going up in the rupture how many 500 how many went to the upper room 120 where was the other one have you thought about it if you need that scripture you ask me where they say 500 people so jesus going up amen out of 500 only went here all the disciples stuck here because the veil of the temple was not broken yet amen jesus prepared them all the way to sanctification that's why jesus told them you go stay in jerusalem and you wait until the power comes from on eye that power when it comes it's gonna burn the snake everybody okay and he put the white dog inside of you then your battle is between the white dog in your soul and the black dog in the body now you are like the indian giver everybody here but the problem is many people are still here with two dogs and the two dogs are black that's why you struggle amen we are shaking you to put you into place anybody okay so brother brown i'm saying the wolf taking a decision is here roof serving is here we have not gotten there yet and then roof resting is here because the rest is your baptism of the holy spirit everybody okay but we are still right here at the altar what was the decision rook made it's easy we can say my people will be your people my god will be what does it mean my people what does it mean your god will be my god it's not the way you think it's telling you something your decision will separate you completely amen anybody care in other words when you are taking this decision you are actually dying amen amen let all that right here and lord willing we will enter the brazen altar because your boss opened the brazen altar amen okay amen so keep staying in prayer don't wait till we get here if you sense syria here the holy ghost can pick you up right there everybody here amen this is why you saw the house of cornelius they got the holy ghost then peter tell them you got here you forget deliver go back again and get baptized not to receive the holy ghost because it's essential all of them is in the tabernacle so don't get confused don't go sideways just keep these as we're moving roof from here because naomi told roof you need to follow your sister who went back to where her god go go read your scripture in other words when all per missed this she's going back not in the house of naomi she's going back again everybody okay so if that decision is not correct brother brad i'm saying you need to search god where you left him and you need to go right there and correct what you did because brother branham said if you were baptized and you don't receive the holy spirit yet he says something is wrong with where you started because the holy spirit is god approving your faith amen amen everybody okay you must receive a faith somewhere here everybody here and that faith need to go through stages oh my god amen everybody okay when that faith goes through sages when god is pleased with the faith god comes and marry and marry that faith and pull it up then you get the seal of circumcision everybody okay amen so don't look at your ears in the message amen i keep telling you that because the old folks are the one that can miss it quickly anybody care don't look at that measure it with your life be very sincere to yourself look at the life you have been living 20 years look at the life you have been living five years look at the life you have been living 10 years and check that life if that life is not really projecting the word you miss something or you are in a certain stage here and the devil keep playing around with you that's why your life is up down up down up down up down and you don't understand why and we cannot continue with you like that amen we need to help you find out where you are then you would know how to pray to get where you're supposed to be amen remember on saturday we get uh we have our house meeting and the house meeting is going to be at three o'clock we already send all the messages four o'clock 2 30. but robert say 2 30. so whoever is online who's coming from work 2 30. that's what brother robert said 2 30 you already got the information the text was sent some information i'm you i'm on youtube i cannot speak it amen so we meet there the young sisters meeting is going to be on uh march 5th i'm receiving a lot of questions and they are big questions and burners probably we can touch only two and finish the whole day amen so please pray for me and let's stand brother bruce is preaching for us tonight you know brother bruce pretty well he preached for us in a hotel he fellowship with brother scott so he's here he's going to take his liberty and preach remember stay simple don't get yourself complicated you're going to get lost amen let's sing only believe as brother bruce come [Music] all things are possible [Music] yes lord [Music] yes lord we believe you tonight [Music] jesus is here now [Music] all things are possible for my jesus [Music] [Music] oh my jesus is here hallelujah thank you lord amen good to be in the house of the lord this evening amen amen just an honor and a privilege appreciate brother stephen amen amen just to be you know it's it was i guess back in the hotel when we were here last and that's not a a position in a in a land but a position in a in a heavenly place amen i believe that where we're sitting together amen here in these heavenly places this evening so i just appreciate being here with you tonight amen you know god said he he made us to sit in heavenly places he made us we were designed and destined and made to sit in these heavenly places amen one time he took ezekiel and he grabbed him by the back of the neck and raised him up and raised him up and said i want to show you something he was made by the hand of god to sit in heavenly places amen amen all that the father has given me will come amen that's a guarantee signed by god himself he laid abraham down one time and he put him to sleep he said because i'm going gonna do this oh my what a god we serve tonight a mighty god and been unveiled in this hour like no other to all the ages they probed at him oh my but here he stands with us this evening my i love him i love him let's let's turn in the scripture to isaiah isaiah 29 or 28 excuse me isaiah 28. isaiah 28 i want to look at verse 7 and we'll read a few of the scriptures here let's bow our heads heavenly father we just thank you tonight god lord that you'd call a people by your name and god when you called us we would come and assemble lord not around a man or an idea tonight god i believe we're gathered around a word and god it's not a an intellectual word but it's a it's a living breathing person tonight god it's a truth not just a truth you said you were the truth tonight god and lord we've come together have thy own way with us and we'll be sure to praise you in jesus christ's name amen and amen in isaiah chapter 28 and verse 7. but they also have aired through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they air in vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean no place no place you say well we're clean no place clean no place verse 9 whom shall he teach knowledge whom shall he teach and whom shall he make to understand doctrine where doctrine means a report or a message amen them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast you might be seated this evening i mean the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word i want to look this evening and just lord teach us lord teach us and and if i was i i was going to islet pentecostal babies but i want to look kind of at the the effect here of what he said whom shall he teach knowledge whom shall he teach and his isaiah is is prophesying as he's looking and he's going he says whom shall he teach knowledge into whom shall he it says to whom shall he make to understand whom who is he going to make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk so we we look and we see as isaiah is talking about this there's there's something that happens from when a baby is is is is on the milk and and he's having to be served by his mother and he's he's having to be attached to his mother that god god is is not looking to teach those that are still attached to their mother he's not looking to teach those that aren't yet weaned away from somewhere they once were so their takes something in the life of a believer that separates them from something they used to be a part of and to the believer the problem with israel is they weren't separated they weren't separated from their days of just going about see they came out of egypt but yet they weren't completely separated and so when they come out of egypt and they entered into another land they they they begin to attach to that other land and as they walk through god would tell them now do not attach do not get in bed with but but destroy everything that lays before you and do not get connected to the philistines or the amorites or the hittites or any of those other nations because when you do you'll begin to pick up their ideas you will begin to pick up their traditions you will begin to act as they act and see god didn't want his people to act like any other nation or any other denomination amen so so we see that that isaiah is talking to a people that will we'll see reflected even in an hour that we're living because israel here in the first verse he says woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim now ephraim e from we know is the is the ten tribes of the of israel so this this isn't people that don't know god this isn't people that have never heard of god this isn't somebody that's just pure heathens this is a religious people [Music] this is the people that maybe even from birth were raised up but they never broke free so here we're looking at and and you notice whose glorious beauty is a fading flower see they didn't recognize this they thought the beauty that they once had would always be they thought that where somebody once said they they come into a church they they maybe would have got at an altar as we say or or got baptized they thought my this is the beauty and the glory and they thought my this will never fade but they but the problem is a lot of times people come in and they get a tradition from a church before from another age that's crept over into this age thus they picked up tradition and we brought tradition over from age unto age unto age unto age and thus every age that birthed another age it never got separated from the mother it was birthed out of amen now we will find it over in revelations when he talks about a great that had many harlots and brother branham would teach us that what are those he said those are the birth children of the mother that she birthed the children and now you know the prophet of god would teach us that a child when it is birthed in that state it is innocent and it doesn't know any better but yet as it is grown up it is taught under the hand of mother and it returns right back to what mother did and there's where she becomes a harlot she's not a hurley when she came out but when she returned back she became a harlot and old saints when luther came out he come out clean but when she went back in she became a harlot oh when wesley come out she come out clean but when they went back in they became a hurlet pentecost when they come out clean they went back in they become a hurlet don't stop with me now because when this message came out it came out clean but it went right back to a hurlet why did it go back because it kept the tradition of the church before it it will not separate but in this hour god is causing a separation of a bride amen from the shark amen it's going to be like nothing you've ever seen before because listen sayings he's teaching a people paul said man cannot teach us but the spirit has taught us yea the deep things of god [Applause] [Music] man does not know man no man knoweth the hour no man knoweth the hour amen but the prophet has taught us in this hour amen that something is coming and no man we can't figure it out in our minds gloria i can't figure it out i can't read enough i can't study enough i can't understand enough i can't sit in church and by my own intellect know it enough but praise god he has a way of teaching this bride he's got a weight that's above every other way he's got a weight that's higher than my waist he's got a way that's higher than your waist all tables are full of vomit this morning this evening amen every bit that man can do is full of vomit this evening amen if i teach you one thing tonight it's full of vomit amen but if god himself amen by the supernatural power amen can teach us something amen it'll be something we'll never forget because it'll be an eternal lesson glory it won't be something man has taught us it won't be something man has worked out but it'll be something god teaches this little bride this is a woman that's not manhandled she's not guided by the hand of man she is guided by the hand of almighty god glory oh my to think about it tonight that god so loved you that he wouldn't allow another man to teach you because he was going to come teach you himself he so loved you that he wasn't going to let another come save you he was going to save you himself oh my this is the same god that wasn't going to let another touch your emotions he was going to touch you himself oh my he has called us into this secret place he so loved us so longed for us that he created he made a law wrote it on tables with his own finger amen just so that fallen man could be in contact with a heavenly god you say that was a law and only one could get into that place and there was a high priest once a year could go in and he had to be dressed a certain way he had to be anointed a certain way he had a group of wise makers amen that were that were that were anointed by god himself to make the garments that he was going to wear and when they put it upon this high priest and he went through all of this and he got layered up in all his clothes and put on his head and put on the urination and put everything in place it wasn't for that man just to go in and be somebody but there was something on the inside of the holiest of the holies amen it was longing for a fellowship amen a man wasn't clean enough to get there god had to make a way for him and so he took moses into the heavens and showed him the way and come back and gave him a word that god could have fellowship he could teach us that he could show us mother he could unveil himself to us then it wasn't even good enough but he had a way that one day a man was going to come he was going to come himself hey mean the world wouldn't know him the world wouldn't seem the world wouldn't understand him but he was going to come to a people and he was going to do things that no other man would do [Music] yet he had the whole power of the world that he could have spoke and pulled himself off he could have spoke and removed himself out of harm's way he could have done any of these things but yet god knew the plan he knew the plan he knew the plan he didn't he didn't even tell the devil about it because the devil surely wouldn't hung him on a cross if he knew glory listen it wasn't the devil that hung jesus on the cross it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a punch of pile it wasn't under them that hung him on a cross it was god himself he said you have no power over me [Music] god would give it to you and god's want to teach us these things but how can he teach us if we don't want to not if we want to keep staying stuck where we were amen so here in israel as they were in isaiah they were they were stuck and they were coming and you look how it refers to drunkenness and wine and and and constantly that now it's not just the the natural don't look look no they weren't drunk with that kind of wine just as they were at pentecost weren't drunk with that kind of wine amen but they were drunk with the wine of the seduction and the influence of everything around them to where they got lord into a state to where they could sit there and to where even the priest he said and the prophet themselves were drunken with this wine down through the ages they fell under the drunkness of that wine to where to where even they lost the vision and they begin to guide the people by a drunken fault amen so they begin and and so we see how that it is even down through the church ages and everything walks in parallel with with israel back in the day because it's god showing us who he is and that he's unchanging and what he's doing that's why he'd say he that began a good work in you he is faithful he is faithful he's faithful this evening but here israel got pulled in and he said all tables are full of vomit whom shall i teach knowledge to whoms they'll make to understand doctrine they're a message he said but why don't you say them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast and then it goes and he says for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little and then it goes forward with a stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people now that's not that's not just a gift of tongues talking but this was israel that was so engulfed in the national language and so lord asleep and where they were and they had precept upon precept they had lying upon line they had a law that they knew they had a tables of stone that they studied with their intellect they had every they had preachers preaching they had a they had a beautiful church set up they were lord into thinking it's okay they had a they were they were they were they were lawed into just i'm going to say they were lulled into lukewarm glory they were lord and like over in the over in revelation where we find the church of the laodiceans it wasn't the church at ephesus or the church of emphasis of the church of smyrna or the church of philadelphia or the church of this but it was now it wasn't a church of a nation but it was a church of the people because it had so engulfed that it wasn't now it had nothing to do with the church in the land but now that people had made it their church to where they were in control of everything listen think listen listen listen they were in control of everything they were in control of who god saved and who didn't get saved they got in control of who got to come in and who didn't get to come in they were now in control of going through the checklist to find out if they passed or not they had us they had a code that boy if you didn't meet this you weren't in because it was now their church but the problem with it was is that the one they were supposed to be worshiping was on the outside but they have precept they have lines they have a book they have a quote they have all of these things have all of that stuff but he was looking and so he said with a stammering lips and if you go and you look into the history of it that that's where god was saying listen you're settled in over here in ephraim and all of this drunkenness and everything but i'm going to bring in another nation a whole nother i'm going to bring assyrians in here and they are going to wipe you out and that is a nation of another language and it's with a stammering lips of another language of another nation that i am going to take this people but in that sweeping he was saying i'm going outside of your precepts because my the precepts aren't doing it it's not doing it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to come into your life i'm going to knock on your door and it's going to be above your understanding see church can't teach you how to get saved oh but god knows how to put you in position to where you got nowhere else to run oh my it we don't it don't take me to show you how you need to be it takes god to put you in position [Music] how does he put you he takes everything in your life amen and he wipes you clean amen there's nothing else left but him alone who am i to think about it who can god teach this to [Music] he that has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit's saying amen so the spirit has now come to teach but who's he going to teach those that have an ear oh my those that have an ear they hear the sound of a true prophet that hear the sound of a true prophet they hear the sound of the messiah speaking and they move according to his word amen watch because even isaiah said over in 53 he said whom who hath believed our report same word as as doctrine who hath believed i report and to whom is the arm or the power of the lord revealed who to whom is the the arm or we'll say the power of the lord revealed paul said in this place he said i didn't come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom that word enticing means persuasive so see paul didn't get up with the idea to preach and to try to persuade somebody to serve this god oh he's going to give you he's going to give you a new car he's going to make everything all right he's you know you're going he didn't even get upset you know you're going to make it to heaven it's a beautiful land i want you to go to heaven with me mama's over there waiting on you i don't want you to miss it see always trying to emotionally persuade somebody to serve almighty god like god can't do it himself oh but god is able my god is able to go beyond my ability to go above and beyond our ability to perform his mighty will glory so we see you here that he said what was it who's going to believe who they couldn't they couldn't comprehend they couldn't comprehend because there he went on to say who's going to verse 2 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should even desire him my let that soak just a second you're not even gonna desire this a man in his right mind won't desire this amen a man in his right mind won't desire to serve a true living god because there god is going to take him and detach him from everything you take i heard him talking something about ruth he is going to take and detach them from everything they've ever known because he wants to teach you his ways and he don't need your old ways because he wants to show you his ways our ways have always been wrong but his or the right way jeremiah said seek out the old ways not the old ways of man but the original ways of god before the earth fell there was a god that had a way and in this hour god is restoring us to that way he's not taking us back to pentecost he's not taking us back to some other day he's taking us back before there was oh my saints and that's why he's wondering who can he teach this to who can he teach this to can't teach it to the churches can't teach it to the church members can't teach it to those that are still hanging on mama's breast can't teach those but he's got to detach he's got to detach us from what is so comfortable [Music] he's got to detach us from what is so our precepts become comfortable our quotes become comfortable our ideas become so comfortable until we until we scoot them up into a nice little nest around us and this is well i believe it this way and and i it's the way my my mama taught me and my mama taught me and oh pastor so-and-so taught me but god says but who can i teach who can i teach see god wants to teach this little bride something now brother branham said in the in the seventh seal there he said a voice come and said you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things and then he said now let them alone let them alone but we want to save everybody no he said let them alone let them alone you know jesus in the midst of his ministry he stopped and he turned and he said remember lot's wife remember lot's wife why did our lord and savior standing on earth go back to her because our prophet picked up and said in this hour said the problem with lot's wife and what got her to turn back was her grandkids over there see the emotional tug of natural things that will turn her back to a pillar of salt and our lord when he was trying to teach the disciples he said don't let your emotions get in the way of what i'm showing you because he's going to take you through things that your friends aren't going to like he's going to put you in positions that that maybe the pastor won't like but what it's don't turn back to what used to be when you know that you're in his plan oh my if i can if oh oh if if i can lord lord please let's go back and save the grandkids he said we can't don't look back honey god's god is going somewhere we're leaving that behind amen oh my god now watch because we see the the condition that we're in and we didn't get here overnight we didn't get settled into church entity overnight we didn't pick up our traditions from just our father these things have been laid in here for instance grandfather and great grandfather we think while we're in the message we're outside denominations no that denominational spirit sets right in amongst us tonight what is that denominational spirit it's i'm okay and there ain't no more and i'm gonna settle in right here and everything's gonna be all right i've gotta i've gotta he said it over in isaiah said you've gotta you've got a uh uh a a a a pact with death and hell but that's not going to hold it's not going to hold us tonight so we see the church listen brother bram said in the first seal oh it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out we know that was what it was the power of what he rode on what did he ride on watch what he said and it still was a symbol now once he said it would be known in the last day where are y'all living where are y'all living this evening are we in the last day amen he said it'd be known in the lat now you can't go back and ask wesley what this was you can't go back and ask some pentecost what this was this is going to take a supernatural voice of what you can't go back and ask brother branham what were you talking about this takes gun to show you what this is what but it come forth in a church symbol coming forth in a church do you understand it church now he's now he's what do you understand it church see how close it see how close it is he come riding on the church a symbol of the church and that same writer jumped on every other age and wrote on out what was he doing he was jumping from church age to church age and coming through [Music] amen it comes forth a symbol of a church a symbol of a church oh that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider how lovely i lovely so they got their idea where'd they get their idea they got their idea from the first church and it carried over to the next church and the same power kept bringing it down from age to age and so now we get dumped down here at the end and what is it now it's become the people are so in control because that's what they've been taught for ages to ages paul didn't teach that paul didn't teach that brother branham didn't teach that he said he's outside of that knocking brother brahman said in the church he said what is it he said when you stand up there knocking he said that's not a single individual plea to somebody's heart he said that is a telling of where christ is in this last day it is god sending a prophet pulling a curtain down and showing us that christ is not in the church so why do we want to keep making churches come on you say well wait a second i'm sitting in church tonight oh no you are made to sit in heavenly places oh my we might be in a in the presence here of a church building we might be fulfilling like a duty of a church but i'm telling you tonight the bride has been made to sit in heavenly places oh how do i get there how can i climb up into heavenly places no you don't reading it right paul said you are made by the same one that made you in the beginning fashioned you in the form of a seed and placed you down under that earth and waited until this time to shine the light of this glorious hour upon you and god in his infinite wisdom has come in this hour and anointed us in this day oh my oh sure and this son all kinds of weeds come up with it but that doesn't stop the bride that don't stop what the bride is to him because he's teaching her amen so we get called we get to be into this thing oh my jesus is so lovely and so kind and so wonderful yet we don't really know him that good watch watch what he said here in matthew chapter 15 jesus come to the place matthew 15 and verse 12 and then he just got done having a little meeting and then came his disciples and suddenly it said unto him notice thou that the pharisees were offended pastor don't you know he offended some this morning good good good say even the disciples you know they was as human as the next one they said lord don't you know that you've run part the church off this morning they didn't understand what you were saying they didn't understand don't you know you offended the pharisees oh my and he says he said what he said after they heard this saying but he answered he answered he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up oh this is our loving this is our loving lord see we got an image of what we think and where did our image of him come from most of our images of him came from mother come on most of our images of what god really is came from our mother because she tried to control him oh but when he stood on the earth he didn't worry about what mother thought he told him and said let him alone they'd be offended lord it don't matter nothing that my father has not planted it'll be rooted up it'll be rooted up he says oh you're so hard you don't care about people no i care i believe the bride cares so much that she she knows that it's nothing but truth that can transform a life doctrine won't do it ideas won't do it traditions won't do it but all the power of god there is a sunlight in this hour it's a harvest sun oh my god it's a harvest sun and it's going to bring all kinds of things up oh but it's also bringing the bride up i can't now let's let's do that you know we bought we're offended somebody i'm not saying we are tonight but let's just you know in our mind we'd think oh you're gonna offend somebody okay then let's do this let's take the sun and turn it down a little bit let's let's say like well let's just go back to pentecost because they had more they had more fun in pentecost pentecost let me tell pentecost was fun oh my they shouted rand jump they didn't know what they was jumping and shouting about but boy they did it they had healings and prayer lines and fun and excitement and everything oh man it was fun and you felt good when you left you felt like man i've done something but god teaches by a difference [Laughter] he teaches you like he teaches his own son he sends you into the wilderness and makes you starve glory why because he don't want you to know anything but him he don't want you to know any kind of tradition he don't want you to know any why because he's got a bride going in a rapture he didn't send some first grade education but he sent himself he came to do what where is he taking it what is he teaching us he's teaching us who we are where we come from where we're going and i don't know about y'all but i didn't come from this earth so i'm not really worried about fitting in with this earth i'm not really worried about fitting in with these religions i'm not really worried about trying to study to be more nice in this world oh my why because i'm looking to get out of here hey man i'm keeping my eyes on him and if he says oh ignore i'll ignore if he says oh this is for the this ain't for the dogs i'll say let's not give it to him then oh but all of a sudden if in that situation when they're so highly offended something stirs in their heart and says truth lord then i'm going to know it's not nothing that my ability is done i haven't been nice enough to pull them in see we've got the church has been set up all along to be nice enough to convince people and to persuade people to come serve the lord please come serve god we'll give you a place in the church we'll do something we'll get you on the front row we'll do we'll put you on the instrument we'll do something just come serve the lord oh my god i'm going to teach somebody something and it ain't nothing you've ever learned before what are you going to teach us well we know we know healings we know this we know we know all these things you say well you don't believe god's a healer i believe he's more of a healer now than he's ever been but we don't have to impersonate what brother branham did to get people healed amen said we fell into traps but what i want i want to show you something because paul said in first corinthians we know familiar scripture for me he said but when that he said for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come i don't know about you but i've got in contact with something perfect and that perfect don't mean something this is better it means something that's complete something that satisfies above anything that's ever satisfied and so that which is in part it's done away but we just what he said now watch when i was a child pentecostal babies i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought i sat around with my thoughts as a child what can i do for fun today i sure hope church is going to be fun tonight i hope somebody good's going to sing i hope i hope the preacher won't be too long i hope he won't tell you i hope he won't take things away from me and then i hope when i go to work everybody loves me i hope i don't get fired i hope my wife don't get mad at me see but with stammering lips and other tugs he's going to teach this little bride he's going to come outside the realm of what we're used to and he's going to flip us upside down so that we'll see him because he loves us so much that he won't let he said i will not leave my holy one to suffer corruption [Music] he may kill you but he won't leave you glory glory ah glory watch i be i became a man i put away childish things now he said in the realm she said well what if moses would have come would have brought noah's message we'll build an ark and float down the nile it just wouldn't work but we still think pentecostal ideas in this message will work my we still think pentecostal well there was a good church they had to give sure they did sure they did but we're talking about noah and moses that's way back it don't affect us that don't affect us but watch how god does things oh it wouldn't have worked and now listen and neither would jesus message have ever worked of moses i thought jesus message will work for anybody my and we'll still worship across we'll put that thing up like it's a brass serpent and think that oh if anybody says anything against it oh there'll be a curse no they said i'm not talking against the cross no more than the kingdom when he come in and he walked over there and the lord told him said take that brass serpent and break it across your knee because that thing had become an idol because it tied on to another day see there's so many things in this message that ties us to another day but i believe god in this hour is breaking those things down around us listen i'm not worried about the people that left the message i'm worried about the people who are satisfied just sitting in the message come on better line upon line precept upon precept when god has done left that thing man [Music] oh my god how to think who can he teach to he can't teach if we're just sitting down with our ears hands plugged in our ears thinking man i'm satisfied i got it all my god i ain't got nowhere else to go i don't know about you but i'm saying lord come quickly and let's go oh my god we got our eyes on him lord teach us whatever you want by thy road and thy steph they comfort me why don't keep me on the straight and then take me and guide me and show me lord i don't want it by precept i don't want some man to teach me how to live but god break it down and take the wound out of me turn this conscience loose god break everything that would tie me to that old man make me so sick of this natural man and his traditions that god i hear only you i don't precept i don't want lying upon line i want the mighty hand of god and that's where god has got this little bride now oh my never work neither will wesley's message work over in luther luther's message won't vice versa and today we are last great reformation was pentecost and today we're moving from that amen wow moving from that and the pentecostal message won't mix with this that's another day listen to rapture 1965 and watch teaching teaching us lord teaches god i'm getting ready to get really close i want i want i want to visit something that brother branham went through listen remember i can't teach you anything brother stephen he can't teach he said well bless god he's a good teacher i believe that he is but but but it's not a man's ability to teach anything because if a man would teach us we would get precept upon precept lying upon line we'd learn how to be a christian so we don't want we don't want to learn to be a christian but brother brethren one time he he told the lord he said you know lord he said if if you if if the meetings don't don't pay the bills i'm getting off the field and so he gets to the meetings and all of a sudden he's in debt five thousand ten thousand and he says that's it lord i'm i'm going off and i'm going i'll tell media and them on the way home and so he gets in the car he's coming out of california and he's going he said okay i'll tell him when we get over into arizona then tell him he said i'll tell him when i get to texas because i didn't tell him he said i got home finally back into jeffersonville he said i finally told him and she said honey said you i don't think you're doing the right thing billy paul told him said dad he said that's something you told god god didn't tell you that so brother branham said well he went out and he he got down in his bed to pray and media was on the other side over there praying he said in the spirit of the lord began to take him into a place he said he saw some kids come pulling a wagon in and he got taken in and and and there and this is 1956 being led to the holy spirit i want to read a read a little portion of it because i believe it's god teaching us something because i believe he taught brother branham things because brother branham had a lot of pentecostal learning in him he did he had a lot of pentecostal learning and it bled through into a lot of things he said well now our prophet was perfect watch and just then brother is talking and he says he goes in he said just then i went off into another dimension and when it was now remember watch these things and he's talking about he it just come out of one dimension where he was dealing with the baby's shoe and the shoestring and he had the shoestring and tried to push it in and he pushed it and he pushed it he couldn't get it and just tearing all apart and and this voice come to him and said you can't teach pentecostal babies super natural things you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things but brother branham was always trying to teach pentecostal babies supernatural things and so he goes and he goes and brothers i look down i saw well there was that little piece of the shoe that was supposed to go through and just then he said sing went like another dimension now remember watch these things they'll come to pass word by word i'm not don't worry i'm not preaching tent vision okay and if you believe that's fine but i don't put my idea to it so listen watch these things that'll come to pass word by word it's perfect paul said when that which is perfect has come hey this is the way he teaches me [Laughter] okay what now and i was standing by a lake look like and he'd taken me and set me down there by this lake and brother brandon says over in a what is the vision he says here it was he said i was by this big beautiful lake and he said there was rainbow trouts all in there i don't know if y'all remember but the prophet had a big rainbow trout world record i might say hanging on this wall it just happened i don't know how good i mean it's probably his ability to fish see how silly humans are we can we can't see god half the time because we're so enamored with ourself i i did that i did watch but what he said there was i stand in my lake look like and he take me and set me down there by this lake and he said there was lots of ministers around fishing now god set brother branham down right amongst this big fishing hole and there was a bunch of ministers fishing a bunch of them fishing so here comes one and sets in the middle of all these might have been a million and he was one i don't know how many there was but there was a lot and i looked and there were great big fish and that's where he's talking about the rainbow trout and some of them was catching little bitty fish some of them was catching up and just then i said oh my i said i'm a fisherman i'll catch the fish so i picked up the pole that was laying on the ground and just then this one said to me said i'll teach you to fish 1956 programs telling this vision the time that america was going to give her sin or dad great grace away but he's coming and said i'm going to teach you so listen something's something's going to let loose because god's going to teach somebody to fish something is changing god's going to teach somebody how to fish so i picked up the pole laying there he said i want to he said this one said i'll teach you to fish the one that had been talking behind me to my right side and i said all right he said fasten on the lure but throw it way out in the deep throw it way out in the day brother said several times he said throw it out into deep he said and when i went and i went way out in the deep he said now when you do let your bait settle down he said and then pull slow first pull slow fair he said the small fish will follow the lure there was people that followed brother branham all over this country people followed him everywhere we got people to follow preachers all over this message now ain't a lot of people following god but they'll follow a man all over the place watch and he said he said now what dude he said small fish will follow the lord now that's really fish and technique all right he said pull slow and said the small fish will follow and then you'll get a when you get a strike he said just jerk it a little bit not hard a little bit not art but i said don't tell nobody how you're doing it now i would have to argue with the angel right here you said what are you talking about jesus told me go you in all the world and preach the gospel teaching them [Music] looks like we got contradiction not if you're under the hand of god and he's teaching he's going to show you these things see remember jesus message won't work today listen brother stephen invited me everybody said by the way the lord now listen i'm not gonna do anything to hurt brother stephen or his church and i believe everything jesus said and i'm not taking and making nothing of none effect but sometimes our traditions will sometimes our traditions will and that's why god will break our traditions now that's really fierce he said let's just jerk a little bit and i'll harvest it don't tell nobody how you're doing say keep it still don't tell nobody what you're doing said pull it slow you know he told he told the disciples one time coming off mountain transfiguration tell no man because some things ain't for them amen god said keep still don't tell nobody what you're doing pull it slow and then and when you feel your strike just pull your bait far enough to scatter the little fish you mean you're gonna scatter them little clingy things that been hanging on around here that really ain't got it them little fish you're gonna run them little fish off don't run nobody no he said pull it until they scatter sometimes i'll have me say things that'll make some leap son ago but he said some will ponder some ponder glory this message ain't a message of a man this is the message and the workings of god he knows what he's doing saints he's got a bride on his mind and he's got a place for glory watch oh when you feel poor and bait and scatter them little fish it'll make the big fish run for it glory it's going to make the big fish run for it who am i going to teach make them run for it oh then when you get a strike then you set your hook for the catch and i said i understand now this is the prophet of god saying i understand and i threw it way out just as i did all these ministers and people run around oh brother branham's back on the field i'll tell you i can guarantee you brother branham wasn't god but oh i can tell you god is this message who can who can i make to understand doctrine who can i make to understand this message this message is none other than jesus christ himself glory none other who was that come down out there in revelation saying that was christ none other could it be oh we're not feeding on a man saints but watch watch oh i said all these ministers and people running around said praise the lord brother branham hope brother branham will really catch fish oh they was just going on like that and i felt real big about because they were telling me i was a fisherman every person is susceptible to that [Laughter] a man don't become popular by itself [Music] a lot of little ministers get around and pump him up and and if he ain't got god to keep him humble he'll ride around and gather up and take off and go and fly and do whatever to satisfy those people his messes will begin to satisfy those people and then god's message will be for god oh but he'll still have quotes he'll still have scripture but the message won't be ringing watch and brother branham now watch this is a brother adam watch he's teaching us and all these ministry people run around praise little brother and really catch fish they was just going home oh my i thought i was somebody telling me i was a fisherman i said now i'll tell you how it's done here's the way you do it and i said the first you're supposed to pull slow and then when the little fish goes to follow i said you said it like this he got so excited about that first pull again he just couldn't let go of that first pull oh come on he couldn't let go of that first pull he couldn't oh wait watch there you go he said you said it like that this and when i did i jerked bait hooking everything out of the water and i looked and i caught a fish but i was wondering how i ever got the lure in his mouth cause it looked like just the skin of the fish stretched around the lower it was such a little fish and just then i said oh my look and just then this one had been talking behind me stepped around in front of me it was the same angel of god that's always spoke to me he said you've done just what i told you not to do standing on the platform and trying to explain it and telling the people and i told you to keep it to yourself now brother brennaman before this said all this is going to come to pass perfect this was 1956 when he got the vision he didn't know what was coming the third pool wasn't there yet but my my saints what what did we see it that brother branham himself as a person would come and he wouldn't let go of that first pull he kept bringing it with him trying to explain it to the people and if we get down to the end and the angel is standing there when it's all done now and he says you did what i exactly what i told you not to do and then you wonder why the little fish left glory god knows what he's doing glory brother brahman didn't do it his own self god knows what brother branham was and what do you do glory you think oh brother brown was messing it all up glory god didn't have his eye on the little fish he had his own the big fish right isaiah 43 said i will give men for your sake he'll make brother branham do exactly what i told you not to do so that we would do exactly what he said to do glory yes i don't understand that goes against my tradition praise god his ways are higher than our ways amen hey listen he sent a man all the way on a boat to tarsus in the perfect will of god the prophet said in the perfect will of god just to get him to have a rendezvous with a fish that he had specially prepared amen to deliver him out to a place that was going to catch a big fish come on saints oh we got it wrong a lot of times we think there's a we think we got a cookie cutter religion and everybody's going to fit in there but god is the god of [Music] oh my saints this message is praying perfect in the hand of almighty god and it's doing what it's supposed to do glory and i'm just glad there's a people that sees it i'm glad there's a people that can understand it glory oh my done exactly what i told you not to do stand on the platform keep it to yourself sin and now this is what i want you to see and said look what you've done look at the carnal impersonators nations you got you got rosie what did he do what did all that show us it showed us that there was a lot of people that was going to watch brother branham and do just what brother branham did they was going to line up and have prayer lines like brother branham did they was going to have big meetings like brother branham did they was gonna try to discern like brother branham did they was gonna carry their bibles like brother brenham did they was gonna have church like brother branham did they were gonna do everything like brother brenham did but yet they were mimics impersonators and here we are in this hour with a bunch of impersonators doing just what the prophet did trying to act and have church and denying the very power of god from such turn away oh my god is going to break everything down in this hour he's going to run out every little fish he said what are you talking about mimicking the way that he fished brother brown talked about casting a net and dragging in the fish and where'd he get that he got that from jesus what did jesus say cast out there in the deep and bring him in and he told the story about casting out there bringing in all the pollywogs bringing in everything else why because they were going to build a church trying to build a church and now i say in this hour i said we're not to throw a net and try to build a church but we've had special god-sent instruction how to he said i'll teach you how to fish and what are we supposed to be fishing for we're not supposed to be fishing for church full of pentecostal babies we're not supposed to be trying to make a bunch of pentecostal babies i mean they gotta suck milk but what do we do we are fishing with a special lure into a deep pool amen where very few are anybody can catch little fish anybody can get an altar full oh my but the supernatural power of almighty god is the only one that can catch a bride in this hour oh my but if everybody wants to keep fishing like they always fist they'll keep catching what they always count oh mama brad it's time that we stand and feel it's like we were taught glory jesus messes won't work today that worked in pentecost they'll work down in the first but it doesn't work today you say well we keep doing it we keep getting church members and that's all we keep getting persuading people persuading but there was a message in this hour to come to teach a bride how to fish [Music] how to fish you might fish all day you might fish all week you might fish all month you might fish a couple years and you might only get one oh but it's going to be the real one you might scatter a bunch of little fish while you're fishing for it it's focusing saints it's focusing it's getting sharp up here everything below us has passed away everything below us has passed away that full pyramid has come down in this hour it's perfect it's perfect that before wasn't perfect without this but this is now perfect without that because everything that that was is now here amen but we don't got to do it like they did it trying to build that when he which is perfect has come we put away those childish things oh saints and the thinking this hour i'm i'm closing let the musicians come oh my god has loved us in this hour and he's wanting to teach a bride and he's going to pull her off to his side and teach her he said well i want to teach people how to be a good christian i want to teach somebody god is saying i want to teach somebody how to take a body change explain that to me i've been a study and i ain't found it yet i've been looking and i've been a digging but i ain't found it yet oh but i'm telling you there's things that are happening in life that i'm screaming out harder and harder lord come quickly do what you're going to do do something supernatural oh my god show me the arm of the lord sure i don't want i don't want a pentecostal prayer line i want a supernatural body change i don't want to go back to something else but i want to go forward to him hold on to the full power of the inheritance of what he's given us in this hour oh my saints it's it's going home time glory glory let's play that there's never been a day like this day now stand our feet teach me lord to fish teach me don't teach me how to be a good layer to sin teach me how to step out of that layout to see into that bright age teach me how see when this teaching comes it changes everything about you you say well can i just go back and throw the old ned every once in a while why would you go back to the tables that are full of vomit you come out of when god has stood in this hour and taught us how to fish now i'm not making a doctrine of that but i'm just saying in everything when god brings us out of something let's not go back and keep doing the same old same old listen he said that bride his wife hath made herself ready he said behold the marriage of the lamb is come when did we get married visible union why are we still acting like some engaged woman come on does an engaged lady act like a married woman [Music] let me ask you another one see god knows answers to all this he knows he said well i find faith when i return he did he did bro stephen he knew he would he wasn't hoping somebody would believe him he looked down brother instead of seven says he said here we were they predestinated for this age yes ezekiel can these bones live lord thou knowest he asked abraham is there anything too hard for the lord see god knows the answer because he is the answer he is the answer when over rebecca turned to eliezer said eliezer who is that [Music] what did she have to do she had to leave eliezer [Music] and then she went to isaac and moved in with isaac and went into the holiest of holies where i where eliezer had never gone before see this bride this bride was not ordained to copycat and to impersonate brother branham's ministry this bride was to fulfill brother branham's the lord's prophecy [Music] she is to live what he preached because this is the very interpretation of that message i don't need some cloud to tell me this is true for right here is the vindication that everything he said is right for it says yea and amen and it lives in this hour i don't need a healing to tell me god's alive because when i lay down in bed with him he tells me his secrets glory told me what he meant he told me who he is he told me who this melchizedek was [Music] that's what he's done to this little bride [Music] oh there's never never been a day like this day hey man let's borrow it's heavenly father we just thank you god god we thank you for brother stephen god we thank you for this people god we thank you for the liberty here tonight for god you said where the spirit of the lord was there was liberty god brothers liberty there is a unction god there is a liberty we have license of freedom tonight god because of the truth of this hour because of the word of this hour sure god we go through and lord and we we come to church and we we live good lives we do things god that are humanly kind and we we try our best to learn and to be better people but god this little bride wants more than that she's not satisfied with a church religion oh god she's not satisfied with little fish she's not satisfied god with what it was or what it might be because she's fell in love with what it is [Music] god you are our everything and there's never ever been a day like this day to me in jesus christ's name lord i pray father that god you let the blessedness continue fathering this assembly god by the power and the leadership of our holy spirit god by the power of the new birth and the lives of these people god i believe god that it's not just a church father but i believe there's a portion of the bride right here under the leadership of you god veiled in a man i believe it [Music] father and go and let the people see let them believe sit here not just well i got the precepts but god let them sit on the edge of their seats when brother stephen would come to preach and what he'd be telling them it's not his thoughts but god would be your thoughts and then god did see it manifest out in their life and god didn't know it's not some vindication of a of some miracle father but it's a it's a vindication of your word being made manifest lord whatever it takes for thy will to break granted father in jesus christ's name we committed to you bless each one pastor deacons trustees each person in the assembly god may we forever and always lean upon your everlasting arm in jesus christ's name amen [Music] i may enjoy the message tonight amen now you can see what i keep telling you all the time that it's not brother stephen amen i didn't talk to him we just text each other that's all he was not even here on sunday and look how the holy ghost is coming amen and confirming and going and insisting over and over over the same thing so god is talking to somebody somebody need to go back and be in position amen that's why he rocked the boat that's why he shook everything because he's trying to get your attention amen that's why disappointment came that's why we are where we are amen because we got comfortable things were running good everything was good and god look he said it's time for my elected brother let me shake the boat and pull them up amen how many understood that vision how many let me see your hand how many understood how the fishing did you see the three pools there did you see them it's in church how could they have asked you a question to verify amen but all three pools were laying in that vision amen the first because the rainbow trap sometimes is under destruction he's probably doing certain things amen so when the bait is launched he's not really looking at the at the at the bait it's like moses hurting the ship so they got to do a supernatural so moses can turn around and say what is this that's the first spoon everybody okay everybody okay so that rainbow could be doing certain things under the under the pond and doesn't see the hook so they tall brother branham go ahead and launch that when you drop deep you pull it the first time when you pull it the little bitty bird will see that and they will go after it everybody care when they begin to go after it that's the first pool that's the healing everybody okay when they begin to come then the one who was under destruction the one who god was really looking for will see the movement of the water vibrating and when he turn he will see little fishes following something is it clear now i thought you told me you know you want me to continue or you want to go home you want me to finish it did i lose somebody you want me to repeat it you want me to repeat it continue okay so that speech was under destruction so when the little fish begin to move quickly there is like a a current like uh like a vibration that comes back so the big fish who was uh looking at something maybe on facebook or whatever they were doing suddenly hear something like where is everybody going everybody okay then that fish turn and he knows if the little fishes are going like this they got to be a food somewhere but here then he jump on there and begin to follow them right so if brother branham pulls quickly if you pull quickly you catch the little one that's not what god is looking for anybody here so you gotta take the little one and you gotta scatter them so they make way for debate to face the big one you see your prophet just put it there and left everybody here so what do you do you pull the second time when you pull the second time the load of fish now lose gps everybody here that's when the message get hard but here that's when brother branham begin to rebuke the nomination coming under the second seal i mean under the second pull and the discernment and from there on the teaching comes in 62 and begin to destroy everything uh why am i against organized religion who is this jesus jezebel with all of that when he does that then brother branham is no more a good man it is the second paul we thought he was good for healing for all this kind of stuff but the message began to get tired tight a little bit tighter then some people begin to leave the church don't worry it's god's scattering the small fishes no no you can talk to that fish from morning to evening he will not stay you can give him 1100 coats that fish will move out because he's not meant for that catch and god doesn't look for him anybody care when the second pool comes he opened the way once he opened the way now the big fish is now facing the lord the lord that is coming up this way that's what god was crying that's why brother branham the angel told him now set ready and then for the catch and then after that the angels stop because the pool to catch is a supernatural action they cannot explain it to you if they explain it to you you're going to give the holy ghost to everybody the way you pull it you don't explain it you will just feel like i need to pull and suddenly the fish is out that's a supernatural you don't explain it it just come automatically because they cannot explain it to if they give you that secret the devil knows the secret of life you cannot give it to the devil so the lord stop right there and keep the third pool quiet because when he comes and brother branham when he got excited he pulled and got the wrong one he was a little bit efficient like this amen that was not what he was meant after a while he would go to mama where he came from so many people can follow the message they can follow the first poll the second poll the problem is get in here everybody here once that hook get to the fish and that rainbow trout has a rainbow many colors which means a it's a covenant it's a fish that before god come to search it you already have a covenant amen so there is already a sign in your life before even god come to look for you you are just in sin but while you were yet sinners christ already died for you so now he's looking he knows exactly where he's going he's just playing around before you know it don't that's why it's an individual walk don't look at the move of other people oh we're going this way we're going this way be careful when they shake the boat watch the door that is opening it is a bait and you only hook roof and pull roof out back here and the sky the orpah is he okay now you got it now leave the intellectual level get into the reality how many times have i say this is not a continuation this is not about a church it is about you and god and your preparation going to heaven that's exactly what the brother preached he was not even here when we preach about it anybody care anybody care it is all about you and god your individual affair amen because if you don't pay attention you stay in this message and you already under a denominational spirit and you after preachers you have to minister pull here pull here until you are confused everybody care stay put the lord knows what he started and what he started he would take it all the way to the end brother wonderful message we will enjoy it amen so stay in prayer we got question and answer on saturday at 2 30 and keep praying keep uh consecrating and lord's willing if he doesn't come back yet we meet again on sunday morning ready to climb up again high amen amen remember his language tonight he's not going to make it easy sometimes he takes you to the wilderness that's where he talks to you that's why he's rocking the boat not telling you that you're not christian you gotta wake up it's all going time no more playing church amen amen if the people in the message don't wake up very soon some will be in total lost because we have been playing church a long time we got comfortable amen that's why deception are coming left and right so that you can be anchored to christ and you know if mama left i'm not leaving if daddy leave i'm not gonna leave him not if my family leave the message i leave the message all of you none of you got it amen but let that message sink deep into you that supernatural get there amen it doesn't matter if it's your child if it's your husband if it's your wife you're gonna stay there and by your stand you can even save your own family amen so don't get discouraged church this was not me i didn't talk to him this is the holy spirit using a vessel in a powerful way telling you it's not about emotion that decision must be the word upon word clear pathway he loves the truth the rainbow trout love the truth of god without playing games amen we can't teach you pentecostal message we can teach you any other kind of message we got to bring you the pure word that's what's going to help you and that word sometimes seems like it's tough for you like it's breaking everything it's taking everything away from me brother stephen you're taking instagram away you're taking facebook away you're taking what's happening it looks like there is no fun really you are getting into the real fun if the lord terry one of this day i will show you what is the true happiness in marriage it is not the picture that you see because it will behind a lot of people a lot of picture there is a lot of problems picture anybody can get preacher go see those that are boyfriend and girlfriend that living in the world they have more picture than you before you know it they break up that's not happiness amen the people that you think are not happy in the marriage sometimes they're the ones that are living a clean marriage more than you your marriage might have a lot of fun going to the restaurant you come back from the restaurant and you argue and you fight all the time do you want a happy marriage with a husband that doesn't serve god do you want a marriage where everything goes good but your husband doesn't want to pray do you want that who won that amen when you start your marriage show your color from the beginning i hope you get it when you get in college show your colors from the beginning if you don't like something say it tell that man we need to pray from the beginning don't let him two years before you start pulling from prayer it's a problem now let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy lord it will totally take a blind person not to discern the working of the spirit in this church lord

was sitting in this church lord you are speaking may your children father be sensitive enough to catch lord father the very thought that you are bringing because all you're trying to do is to prepare them completely and make them ready to meet you into the air father we thank you for the vessel that you use may you strengthen him may you bless him and his ministry and his family and father may you
