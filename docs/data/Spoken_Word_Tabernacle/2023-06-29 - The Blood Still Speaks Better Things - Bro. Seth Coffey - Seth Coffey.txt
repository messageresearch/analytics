coming up in a sermon [Music] I don't know what to do with an atmosphere like this brother able oh my God Ariana is wide awake yes Lord amen amen amen glory to God Amen open Deuteronomy chapter 6. amen amen singing is very important set up the atmosphere amen let's go to Deuteronomy let's go to chapter 7. amen amen amen I can give you a a versus perfusion amen about what the Lord wants you to be amen wow Deuteronomy 7. glory to God verse six if you dare you can say Amen I can't preach somebody else is preaching but I gotta read this amen the Bible say for thou art a holy people unto the Lord that God and the Lord that God has chosen thee to be how say to somebody I'm special we are the Royal Seed of Abraham I want you to start believing this thing we showed you Prosperity the two side of it the reason evil side and the correct side of it we're talking about the correct side that's why brother Branham say Prosperity is not always because it depends on the source amen he said that you are be to be a special people unto who above water that are upon the face of the water so the blood is different my wife is special and the blood of Jesus Christ is pressure you must believe it remember what I told you even if you receive hours should I will push it until you receive it we should be happy happiness is a person Joy is a person and if that person is in your heart you remember what brother Branham say on Sunday he said get Jesus in your heart and be blessed because wherever he is everything blossom amen verse 7 the bible says the Lord did not set his love upon you no chose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest amen that Minority verse 8 but because the Lord did water [Applause] the love of God and because he would keep the oath which he has sown unto your fathers the has the Lord brought you out of with a mighty hand and redeem you out of the house of born men from the hand of pharaoh king of water we were in bondage of sin all of us God redeemed you why because he loved you why you were yet sinner Christ died for you now you got to swallow this job to verse 10. and we payth damned I hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to him that hated him he will repay him to his face you there Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments and the statute and the Judgment which are commended to do them wherefore it shall come to pass if you hearken to this judgment Kama and keep and do them Kama that the Lord that God shall do what keep unto did the Covenant and the mercy which he swear unto their fathers watch this and he will do what and do what who's blessing you who love you he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee Say Amen he will also bless the fruit of that womb and the fruit of that land that corn and that wine and that oil the increase of that Khan and the flock of the sheep in the land which he swear unto the father to do water swallow this one that shall be blessed above all there shall not be male or female bearing among you and among your water so the blessing doesn't stop to human being it started from human beings but he also goes to the Qatar so whatever you possess must be blessed as you are blessed am I reading a different Bible let me load this let's go to Genesis then I call the preacher Genesis 26. before that reasoning demon comes I have to load you so when it's coming you tell him who wrote this you don't have eyes to read the Bible go read it to yourself amen Genesis 26 if you dare you can say Amen you there verse 12 if you dare you can say Amen then Isaac sowed in that land remember on Sunday it is the blessing of the Lord that make if somebody Rich remember on Sunday if you still scare I will continue to push it you waiting for the Millennium brother Brian I'm saying get him in the heart amen amen then Isaac sword in that land and receive in the next year which year so when you saw in the same here you must receive something and he received in the same year amen a hundredfold this is better than your stock market in other words there was zero loss am I reading a different Bible a hundredfold in the same year why where is this coming from who's multiplying this the Bible says in verse 12 and the Lord did what you see where it's coming from verse 13 and the Man what's poor and he went backward and he grew until he became very poor can we read it over and the man works great and went forward and grew until he became very water for he had possession of water and possession of water and great store of water and the Philistine did water did your Philistine Envy you yet they need to envy you [Music] don't worry keep this for Sunday okay and the Philistine envy him keep that on Sunday and I will show you what God does Genesis which verse is it Genesis 26 what to have to what 14 and in 14 the philistine and for him why did they envy him because God blessed him I cannot talk too much because you will catch it now amen amen so when God bless you only believe my friend let me hold that Hallelujah Hallelujah that's your reading for Sunday the first one you meditate you will catch it amen amen God wants you to be happy [Music] even if there is no food you gotta be happy it's the first Exodus under the blood of bulls and goat and God is doing this and the blood that we have speak of better things than discipline oh Lee believe come on brother said [Music] possible thank you brother Solomon to be here thank you oh We Believe [Music] oh We Believe all things are possible [Music] Lord I believe

a privilege to be here thank you brother Stephen I tell you I feel an adequate standing here with all the fine ministers in here that could do a much better job than I can but you know we're we're not

start in in Hebrews chapter 9 and the 12th uh to the 14th verse and and I just want to kind of show throughout these scriptures here what the different things that the blood does that we are told in the scripture now now the blood here changes our desires it says neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us so this isn't a day-to-day thing it's Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer and sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh it says how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God heard your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Amen Let us let us bow

that's praying with Believers I love praying with people yes my brother I believe God is going to do something for us tonight yes God said that he would he promised that he would but you know what it's got to be you got to come to the place you can't be assignment but you got to be that little woman and you got to come to him with your Alabaster Box yes you got to take everything that you have yes sir promise whatever you give him he will be amen greater in return amen you may be seated tonight if you would like and we'll read a couple scriptures here but in First Peter 1 through 18 you know the blood purchased our Redemption it says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things that's silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot who was verily foreordained amen hallelujah before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you amen it brought us now into him in Ephesians 2 it said that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world but now amen how many single for the but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes who were who were afar off or made nigh by what by the blood of Christ in Ephesians 1 but one four through seven it says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world I want you to know it says this is an eternal blood yes this ain't just like a partial blood or a time from time to blood but this is an eternal blood before the foundation that we should be holy and Without Blame before him yes sir having predestinated us unto the adoption of children amen Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure yes sir his wheelchair so this blood that he shed was not just for something that we wanted but this was something that he wanted for us of the glory of his grace where he hath made us accepted yes I tell you what there's a lot of places in life that I haven't been accepted but I'm so glad to know tonight that I've been accepted in the Beloved yes sir in whom we have Redemption through what our works no no through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace and one more here in Romans 5 6 and 9 a high for when we were yet without strength that's right in due time Christ died for the ungodly so listen church I if I could tie this in this was a before the foundation of the world Amen this was something where God seen you he knew you were without strength listen God didn't wait for you to work yourself up before he applied the blood to you no but as he loved you in due time yes died for the ungodly first scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet prayer adventure for a good man some would even dare to die right but God committed his love toward us yes while we were yet sinners died for us amen much more than being now justified by what by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him yes my brother it's all him yes sir him yes what he's done before the foundation of the Lord that's right his blood not my blood his blood yes sir his blood yes my brother now glory to God if we look at this I want to say this it's always been the blood amen it's always been the blood ever since the Book of Genesis you will find the blood yes always be in the blood yes if you take out the blood you take out the Bible that's it it's always been the blood preach my brother now when Adam and Eve had sin in the beginning and they had they they had done this great sin and they had begun to fallen and you know they actually need to even come before God so God that could pronounce judgment on them right but you know they couldn't even come into the presence of God until they had a covering a covering for their sin so you know the way that man is we always think well I've got to build myself up or do something to be able to get back into the presence of God so so they begin to tie all these things together and they begin to get these fig leaves and they they begin to get their own ideas and how they could cover themselves and maybe maybe Eve would look at Adam and say do I look good he said yeah that's fine and then he would try to cover him his own ideas and they would begin to talk one another into that they were finally good enough to go back in the presence of God but as soon as God saying them he said we can't have a conversation like this I can't have a talk like this he took that blood of that lamb and he took those sea it took blood ever since the beginning yes sir take that lamb and he was would begin to apply that that clothing on there that would cover their shoes yes my brother glory to God now yes sir we can see this how this would go down through the children when when Cain and Abel would begin to want to make a sacrifice right God and Cain would begin to get all of his works and all the beautiful things that he could make and all the things that he could grow from the ground and he could be saying to say look how many beautiful sermons I've preached and how many places I've went and the things I've done and this that and the other but you see when he brought that to God God was not pleased with that do you know why because there wasn't no blood in it not like that there wasn't no blood in it but he comes able with this humble sacrifice and he begins to drag a lamb and Abel begins to realize I'm a guilty person that's my guilty human being I was born into this I didn't have a choice I was born came in the world speaking lies shape and iniquity something innocent had to die in his place and he would take that lamb and he would slay it and God was pleased because as that blood would begin to speak out it would begin to bleed and it would begin to cry as the life would begin to leave it and that Old Testament type yes saying you're covered amen you're covered our sins are covered that's right you it's my brother the medicine all through the Old Testament they offered the blood of lambs and goats sheep that's the heifers a substitutionary death that's exactly all in the great economy of God way back in his mind the real object was coming which would be said then were Shadows of the real object that was to come the real object to come was his only begotten son yes sir all the Lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object I only spoke of the coming day of Calvary that's right in Hebrews 10 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come yes and not the very image of the things sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comer there unto perfect and how many knows Jesus would tell them be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and we know that God is a just God and he would never require something out of you that you could not obtain amen amen for when they and not have ceased to be offered because the worshiper once purged should have no more conscience of sin now that word there is desire because we know that we are conscious of the sins of the worlds and the different things but it's not your desire to sin anymore that's the way it should be that's the Old Testament lamb worked like it was supposed to you should have no more conscience of sin but you see these people had the same thoughts they had the same problems year after year because it was just a covering it was no we'll get to it but it was just a covering amen keep on moving my brother but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sin every year now listen here's the reason why the life of the animal could not come back on the believer that's it the animal doesn't have a soul you know they're still they're still out there scientists different things trying to to inbreed the human race with animal life but they cannot do it because that animal does not have a soul but we have a soul so what are you saying brother Sith what I'm saying is it would take a Kinsmen Redeemer it would take her own life to be if I can say this way it would take the life of a human being to be bred into the believer that's exactly right the laugh that animal could not come back on the believer because it was animal life if it could if it could cover him but the blood couldn't change him same desires year after year those Lambs couldn't be akinson Redeemer because it was animal life and not the Seed of Abraham now listen in Hebrews 2 16 it said for verily he took not on them the nature of angels no sir but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his brother and that he might be a merciful right and faithful High priests and things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people so they're saying a lamb this is a person this is a Kinsman this is what we needed and it says in verse 4 now breaking back into Hebrews 10. it says for it is not possible it's not even possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offer is thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared and burned of it can sacrifice for sin thou had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thou Will O God above when he said sacrifices and offerings and burn offings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither had his pleasure in them which are offered by the law then he said lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first he taken away the first that he may establish the second by which we are Sanctified that's right through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all amen amen Jesus didn't have to come back year after year to make this sacrifice because when this sacrifice was so powerful that the one time you see those sacrifices that they made of those those bulls and goats and Lambs year after year it never appeased God it never pleased him but this one sacrifice that Christ Jesus made amen forever eternally for our Redemption for us God was so pleased with the sacrifice Hallelujah and every high priest every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifices for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering that's it he hath made good enough no no no he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I I love this because I'm always trying to hate on the message and say you know you're just trying to live a too holy of a life or this and the other but this is what God said he was going to do this is the Covenant that I will make with them after these days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them listen I can't help being this way I've got the Holy Ghost I can't help being this way I've got the Holy Ghost you live however you want to listen the reason that they had those problems year after year because men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost we ain't moved by the Holy Ghost but in these last days he would pour out his Spirit hallelujah we're not moved by the Holy Ghost but this end time bride is full of the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] I am what I am we are what we are you don't have to beg me to get out of bed and go to church you don't have to beg me to get here sir I am who I am listen I'm not just moved by the Holy Ghost service but I'm full of the Holy Ghost amen can I say it this way you are the church service not too my brother Hallelujah [Applause] see Abel he was a this is brother Brandon see Abel he was a righteous man remember the blood the blood's always spoke that's right but now the blood is speaking better things than that of Abel see Abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent if I'm going too fast I apologize he was in the way I love that he was in the way I love being in the way of everybody standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke it cried out I got to say it I can't help but you know somebody made the statement one time he said you know the message will be done in in four or five years and I believe that was six or seven years ago because I'm standing in the way I I just happen to be in the way brother Solomon we just happen to be in the way we can't help it but we're in the way I I'm sorry standing for the real Revelation he had he spoke it cried out the Justice blood of Abel cried out against Cain another brand says but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried out it redeemed see Abel Abel's blood could just say guilty he's guilty he's guilty but brother Branham said the blood of Jesus not only cried out but it redeemed amen it it speak of better things it makes you Sons and Daughters it hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of Abel could not hide Cain see but the blood of Jesus can amen so old Cain come out today if you've been a persecutor against the word and say the days of Miracles has passed the thing is all nonsense and things it's crying out you see the blood of Jesus Christ cries out but there's forgiveness in it if you'll just accept it amen he said I wish we could stay on that little while see the blood speaketh better things I hope y'all don't mind me reading so much but I I just have to I'm not smart enough amen and the and to Jesus in Hebrews 12 24 and it says and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel Hallelujah so what was it we can look at the Old Testament right and we can begin to look at the Old Testament and we can see what that blood would do that blood would cover their sins but it would never take away their sins it was just a covering that just like in the garden they were able to it was just good enough to appease the wrath of God that they could come back into his presence but it never took away the sin it never took away the desire but you see the blood of the New Testament let's just look at this for a second let's go look at the Old Testament and let's go look at Abraham for a minute under the blood of the Old Testament well look in Genesis and we'll begin to look at Abraham and we begin to look at Abraham we begin to see how it was wrote how Abraham staggered at the promise of God in the Old Testament you say what do you mean mother said well let's look at it it said one time that there was a king that desired to be with Sarah not just once but twice and both times Abraham lied Abraham came out under the blood of the Old Testament when when I believe it was Moses begin to wrote right he began to write out all the mistakes of Abraham and all the things that Abraham did wrong why because he could see it under that sacrificial blood of the other of the natural lamb he could see all the problems oh my we could we could look at Sarah and he would begin to write and Sarah laughed in the tent behind under that blood Moses could see that but glory to God in the New Testament here when Paul would begin to write that's about Abraham yes Sarah yes and all the different ones yes Abraham staggered not at the promise of God Hallelujah they're beginning to write Sarah counted him faithful yes my brother the Old Testament you can see the mistakes now you can see the problem but in the New Testament yeah he said Abraham's perfect uh perfect sacrifice Sarah's perfect okay Caleb you're perfect your Old Testament this old flesh people say you got problems you got this going on you got that going on but under that blood you're standing perfect listen Church you're perfect cause the blood is speaking better things tonight it ain't worried about your past it ain't worried where you came from it ain't even worried what you're going through the blood is speaking better things [Music] wow [Applause] now we find also in Hebrews the 12th chapter the 24th verse that the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice brother Branham said if the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word Hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it brother random says amen amen amen I'll add one more amen sure the blood speaks it speaks better things the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of Resurrection that speaks of healing yes it speaks of Joy yes sir I want to ask you tonight what Testament are you under it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven and the same blood that was shed upon the ground that called out his brother that had killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and it speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all yes my brother all the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for yes it's speaking for you tonight whether you know it or not it's speaking [Applause] you see preacher I know I want to say this I have a voice talking that microphone he has a voice but Solomon has a voice but listen there's one there's many voices there's many voices in the world but there's one true voice there's one true voice and that's not my voice it's not your voice that's not brother Solomon's voice it's the holy spirit's voice and you know what did Brother Branham say he said if there if the blood speaks the blood must have a voice and what is that voice he said it's the word so I want to say this we hear many voices oh yeah there's voices out there that'll say you're not good enough there's voices out there I say you've made too many mistakes there's voices out there that says you'll never get well preach my brother but if you begin to listen he that hath an ear let him hear and remember the blood speaks and the voice is a word so when you're not feeling good the doctor says well this is wrong with you and that's wrong with you and you can't overcome this and you can't overcome that but if you begin to listen to the blood and you begin to hear the blood speak if you get close enough and you tune your ear in you'll begin to hear but he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity you see the blood is speaking better things yes my brother the chastisement of my peace was upon him that's right I'm not feeling good in my flesh but I'm hearing something that's giving me energy it's energizing me there's I'm starting to feel better what is it by his stripes yeah I'm Healed yes and the blood's speaking yes better things it's speaking better things than what this body's saying your body's speaking and saying I'm hurting I'm not feeling good I don't think I can go any further but the blood's saying you're an overcomer glory to God the blood's saying who shall separate us yes you're not good enough you've done this you know who can separate us yes my brother who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribute tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter but nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded yes sir you imagine all the voices that Paul heard you killed Christians Paul you've done too much damage to the church church of the Lord Jesus Christ you've killed too many messes of Believers you've done this you Perse persecuted the church all these different times but there was another voice that he heard on the road to Damascus one time that he said Paul I've called you I've chosen you you're gonna preach to the Gentiles so you know what one day he was in his study right there and he began to write something down and he began to hear a voice and he began to write for I am persuaded that neither death nor life your angels your principalities your powers your things present nor things that come nor high nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Paul didn't say the troubles wouldn't come Paul didn't say you wouldn't have hard days but he said this nay and all these things you're going to be more than a conqueror he said I don't care what you're going through I don't care how bad it is you can't separate my love from the situation you might be going through situations but it's love is unseparable through the situation Hallelujah the blood is still speaking tonight you say how's the blood still speaking because the blood still has a five-fold Ministry that'll come out and say you're the precious spotless Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that never sinned in the first place when Satan says you're not good enough God says you're perfect what are you listening to who are you going to listen to yeah you can sit there and listen to the devil that's saying you're Defeated You've Made too many mistakes that old devil that says you got to work yourself back up for three or four Services because the mistake that you may forget about that devil brother [Applause] we got a perfect sacrifice cause we need to be perfected that's what the blood is for let me tell you something the blood is still the blood amen [Applause] preaching my brother foreign [Music] [Applause] God said so God said so that settles it God's head Zone can we just tell the devil God's handsome that's it the devil says devil said the devil said saith do you really think you're going to overcome do you I mean Seth come on man you got all these problems you got all these family problems you got all these different things do you really think you're going to overcome God said so yeah yeah say you know who I'm talking about God said so yes sir yes my brother I love it I love it if I can just dramatize for a minute I imagine I imagine Satan Satan when he was Lucifer in heaven and he began to begin to go around and tell all the other Angels you know we're going to overcome him we're going to overcome this Jesus and we're gonna we're gonna overcome him and then maybe one of the angels on on the Lord's Side came over and said Lucifer you're getting ready to be kicked out he said who told you that God said so God said so and you know what we learned God's word cannot fail what we've learned is the very Earth that we are standing on is because God said so amen God the very light that we see because God said let there be light amen God said so amen glory to God preach my brother Satan God said so I don't know why I gotta stop preaching and preach I don't know what you're going through and everybody might be putting you down and everybody might be putting you out but it don't matter what they say God says God said so amen page but listen God said so that's where Jesus showed Christ had him on all the qualities for the father was in the son the father was in the son reconciling the world to himself and when he met Satan he never used his power he proved that the weakest of Christian that's it you might feel like the weakest of Christian in here tonight that the weakest of Christians could defeat Satan when Satan come to him and said now if you're the son of God you're a great miracle worker if you are if you be I want you to perform a miracle here for me turn these stones into bread and eat now you're hungry now watch Jesus could have used his power but he didn't he used the word God said so he used the word he said it is written the men shall not live by bread alone but but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth God said so of God yes sir I love that and he stood there three times and defeated Satan all three times and three is a is the confirmation of a witness amen he defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God and the weakest Christian here tonight I don't know where you we're in Satan's eating tonight okay he defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any conditions with the saith the Lord that's right you believe it God said so I didn't even know that was there but I like it God Said So how do you know because the blood's speaking better things God said so yes sir what if he said by his stripes I'm Healed what is confessed confess is to say the same thing saying that's what that's what a confession is confessed is to say the same thing and to say the same thing he said say what he said don't say what your feelings say don't say let your neighbor says say what God Said confess it and believe it don't look at your symptoms the symptoms is the worst thing the enemy that God has to fight against symptoms everybody said well I was prayed for but my hands no better it'll never be like that never will you're looking at your hand don't look at your hands look at what God Said I mean [Applause] why'd you choose that scripture because I can relate with that why'd you choose that quote because I can relate with that you say what he's saying we had we had meetings probably five or six years ago and I was playing a softball game a church softball game and I ended up hurting my wrist and that wrist was hurting me so bad and week after week it didn't get better and you know bro uh brother Timothy Pruitt was preaching at the church was some meetings that we had so I went to that meeting and I was sitting there in that meeting and I began to think about my wrist and how bad it hurt and how I was going to get the insurance card from dad because I just couldn't take it anymore I said you know I was looking at the hand I was looking at the problem I was looking at the symptoms I was looking at how bad it hurt but here I was in the church service and the spirit of God at the end of service you could feel the waves just coming through kind of like we felt tonight but you could feel the waves just coming through exactly and that wave hit the woman in front of me and I know she had some problems I just knew and the Lord came down and delivered her in that moment gave her what she needed but you know what Satan said to me he said he said God will deliver her but he won't heal your hand that's a perfect proof he can do it he told me God how many has had that experience in church before God can help so and so somebody else can have Revival God is able to help somebody else but when it comes to us and I was sitting there and God put it before me and something spoke up inside of me and said what are you gonna do are you going to believe Satan are you going to believe God [Applause] [Music] but you know as I was hearing Satan say God will heal her but he won't hear you I begin to hear another voice and it was the blood and it began to speak better things bad strikes I'm healed amen originally I was gonna go get that insurance card but when I walked out of that service I told my wife I said you've heard me complain about my wrist you've heard me complain about my my pain I said but it stops the right here I said if I say one thing about it hurt if I say one thing you rebuke me on this preacher my brother I'm standing for Jesus yes I said if he'll heal her he can heal me yes sir [Applause] Seth as you get healed the next day no The Voice every day was saying my hand hurts I couldn't hardly drive but if I looked at the symptoms I'd never get better that's right so I just kept saying thank you Lord for healing me buy Stripes I'm here thank you Lord for healing me it's my brother and one day I went to work hurting but on my way home I was driving and I was driving with this hand because this was my good hand while I was hurt this was my hurt hand but one day I was driving home from work and I began to realize unconsciously yes sir I was sitting there going I was held I didn't even know I was here you know why because we weren't healed on any particular day but the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and before the foundation of the world the blood was speaking you're healed you're you're fake you're free and you know what my testimony became a reality amen My Confession it was saying what God had already said said you're healed you're healed saith don't look at that hand don't look at the symptoms don't look at the problems except the promise God said so Hallelujah the blood speaks better things you know what the blood is speaking over that fear [Applause] the blood Speaks Over fear you know the first thing that the blood said when it resurrected was fear not [Applause] fear not [Applause] when I was a 10 year old boy I could not sleep because I had such bad anxiety but I went up and got prayed for in church and my pepper prayed for me and he said you don't worry about it anymore so you know what I did I didn't worry about it anymore I went home and I was sleeping I was trying to go to sleep and Satan began to come around with that same fear that same anxiety Spirit but something began to speak yes sir I want to say this when you can't speak for yourself the blood speaks for you amen and something began to come out of me and I said Satan I was prayed for I'm delivered get out of here foreign never had a sleepless night again from anxiety but I'll tell you what later in life I began to battle a thing called nervousness there was a nervous spirit that came over me there was a nervous spirit that came over me that my stomach was so tore up so I just couldn't hardly breathe felt like no matter what I did I couldn't breathe I couldn't get my heart to slow down I didn't know why I was going through it but God is a merciful high priest Preacher Brother and I was sitting there I battled it for weeks but I would not give in to the devil buy Stripes I'm Healed yes sir the chastisement of my peace was upon him yes sir I was sitting there one day I heard that that song out on the water storm raging High I began to think about that and as I was listening to that song you know what I began to realize and if you realize this right now the nervousness will leave you too if you look back at your life God took me back to when I was a little six-year-old boy and I was sitting there talking to a stump in the woods talking to God and he said to me have I not brought you all this way yes my brother have I not took care of you yes sir have I not given you everything you ever needed have you ever went hungry if I ever left you in the valley not one time the blood was speaking fear not he's our provider amen amen amen what brother Prince say you got to accept it you have to accept the voice of him glory to God I'm trading my sorrow I'm trading my get down for the glory I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my [Applause] yes Lord yes Lord and that's it yes yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord amen amen [Music] you see we sang that we sung that before we came out and preached because what voice are you going to hear so you can trade a voice of Sorrow for a voice of joy [Applause] you can trade that shame for Glory [Applause] you can trade in that sickness for health [Applause] you can trade in all that pain for healing but it all depends on what voice you want to listen to listen tonight there is plenty of voices you know I just feel that let the musicians come back there's many voices that are speaking to you tonight there's many things that are gonna you see that's where you've got to realize there's the devil and demons that our voices constantly battling you trying you putting you down listen any voice that is trying to put you down and not pull you up it's not the voice of God but just as there's demons and devils and other things not only is there the voice of God but there's ministering angels there's a five-fold Ministry there's voices but you know what the truth of it is said take it back to the word [Music] and whatever symptom that you have that goes against the word of God is not the voice of the blood crying out I want to touch on one more thing and then we'll close when we can't speak for ourselves Hallelujah the blood speaks for us you know I began to read and the book of Exodus when the children of Israel the Passover Lamb was going on and it was time for them to leave but they couldn't come out and speak for themselves the death angel was coming through but you know what they had speaking for them a blood there was a blood over the door saying Passover amen amen and that was the Old Testament blood go ahead now but in the New Testament yes sir I'm gonna say this for the one that needs it I've told you how we were Overcomers I've told you the truth of God's word tonight and I believe that but let me tell you this I also know yes what it feels like when you're so low so far down that you can't even speak for yourself right that eagle that gets so crusted over finds himself way he away down in a valley but you know what God sends an eagle to come down and begin to feed that eagle to give that eagle his strength you know there was a man and when I thought about how the blood speaks and I've got plenty more but we're gonna bypass it tonight there was a man one day that was hanging on a cross and he couldn't speak for himself he was sitting there on a cross and there was men all on the ground all kinds of voices that were looking at that thief on that cross and they said you're worthless you're a loser you deserve every bit of this you know what rightfully so he did he deserved everything that he was going through that thief on the cross they could look up and they could begin to look at his life they could be going through his criminal record say on such and such date you did so and so guilty on such and such date you stole this guilty on such and such State you murdered someone guilty on such and such that you did this guilty and they all could begin to say guilty and they could spit on him and and throw stuff at him and do everything to him and you know he's on a cross helpless and even this man is sitting there cussing out the man on the middle cross he's sitting there cussing Jesus with his friend but you know while he's there something begins to speak to him [Music] and it wasn't an audible voice but you know exactly what voice he heard and that voice began to speak to him and as he was listening he began to look and that blood that was pouring out from that man was speaking out come unto me all ye that labor there was something that listened there was a call in him to respond and even though he couldn't even I'm speaking to somebody tonight even though you might feel so lowed down that you feel like you can't get up maybe you feel like you're on the cross of critics but the blood was still speaking better things amen when everything around him was saying you're a loser you're no good you'll never make it there's no way you can make it you've had too many problems you've done too many things wrong God could never forgive you but the blood is still speaking at night listen when brother Branham was sitting there and he was in that Cafe and there was that woman that had those purple nails and purple hair and everything about her and he was sitting there and he was going God how could you ever not how could you ever not just strike her dead how could you not strike this country death does little Rebecca am I in Sarah after grow up looking at this but about that time the angel of the Lord said let me take you behind the curtain here and when he went behind the curtain he began to see a vision what did he see he's seen his own sins but between him and the throne he said day and night listen Satan might come at you from every angle call you a loser call you worthless from every angle but there is a bloodline wrapped around you amen now we don't want to hurt him and we're sorry for the things that we do only but listen everybody around you will be speaking and criticizing and putting you down in every demon out of hell but I want you to know you've got a 360 coverage of the blood of Jesus Christ Before the Throne day and night do you realize in this service right now when you're going to God and you begin to pray and Satan says your prayers will never get to God but listen God don't see you when you're praying God doesn't see you he hears your voice but when he looks to that voice he sees the accepted sacrifice on Calvary speaking better things saying anything that you ask in my name it'll be given to you foreign [Applause] has us covered washes us clean do you realize this night not tomorrow not when we get over there but right now we are standing perfected in Jesus Christ every single one of our sins he took
