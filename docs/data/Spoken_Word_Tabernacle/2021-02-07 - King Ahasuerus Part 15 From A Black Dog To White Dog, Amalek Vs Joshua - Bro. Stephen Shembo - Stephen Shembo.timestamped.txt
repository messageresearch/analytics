[20:56] good morning church last week
[21:01] my husband well every day my husband
[21:02] gets up between two and three in the
[21:04] morning
[21:05] before he gets up for work he makes it
[21:07] his business to pray
[21:09] he gets up an hour two hours early prior
[21:11] to work
[21:12] last thursday he was at work his truck
[21:16] is to give you a picture is like a fire
[21:18] truck the length of a fire truck as tall
[21:20] as a fire truck
[21:21] but he has to on some job sites because
[21:23] he works construction
[21:25] are not stable the ground is soft wet
[21:28] rain
[21:28] so he was up under the truck trying to
[21:30] stabilize the leg and the hydraulics
[21:32] went out
[21:33] and the truck dropped well he didn't see
[21:36] it didn't have time to move
[21:37] had it fallen it would have killed him
[21:40] he said he
[21:41] when the truck shook it should have
[21:42] fallen but i believe because god woke me
[21:45] up
[21:45] my son says he woke him up my daughter
[21:48] later said woke him up
[21:49] we prayed over him that morning he
[21:50] didn't even know we didn't know this
[21:52] happened
[21:52] and god brought him home to it so i
[21:54] thank the lord for that
[21:56] thank you for your prayers
[22:00] hey man hallelujah
[22:09] that was your pump truck pump truck did
[22:12] that huh
[22:12] he drives a concrete pump truck my job
[22:15] is to make the concrete now and then our
[22:17] trucks take it and put it in the back of
[22:19] his truck and
[22:20] he pumps it way over there somewhere how
[22:22] big is it
[22:23] 32 meter so it's a little it's a little
[22:26] one in the business
[22:27] but it's dangerous it's unstable
[22:30] mixers are the same way you're going
[22:32] down the road with a
[22:34] a load that's twisting all the time but
[22:37] god watches after his
[22:40] amen praise god that could have been
[22:43] very tragic
[22:45] we've seen him flip we've seen him stand
[22:47] up on their nose and
[22:48] turn in the ground i don't know the
[22:51] ground just ain't like it
[22:53] there's no good ground where they're
[22:54] building in anywhere anymore but

[49:59] lot of trouble
[50:00] this morning but stay put everything
[50:03] will be all right by god's grace
[50:06] amen you know wednesday
[50:09] i was reading a scripture and instead of
[50:12] reading first timothy or something like
[50:13] the second timothy
[50:15] and i went and i was reading first
[50:16] timothy
[50:18] and i came up and said my god should be
[50:20] how did that make such a mistake
[50:26] i was wondering and the brother
[50:28] approached me
[50:30] he said brother stephen you know the
[50:33] scripture that you made a mistake over
[50:35] there
[50:36] i was thinking all day long about my
[50:39] life
[50:40] and my answer came right from that
[50:44] [Applause]
[50:52] scripture
[50:54] i was feeling bad he told me no he was
[50:57] the holy spirit
[51:00] and last night it was i believe around
[51:04] 12 a.m i was sitting on the living room
[51:07] and brother branham spoke something and
[51:09] i say where
[51:10] i see it amen brother branham say
[51:13] in the message this day this scripture
[51:16] is fulfilled
[51:17] but branham was given a bible from
[51:20] sister meda and he took the bible and
[51:23] was reading
[51:24] and could not read go on the backside
[51:26] read the wrong place the wrong place the
[51:28] wrong place
[51:29] and they gave him a bible where the two
[51:31] paper was taken together
[51:34] and it seems like it's a problem
[51:37] listen to what brother i'm saying he
[51:40] said so one of the children picked it up
[51:43] and we would fill the pages no it looks
[51:46] all right
[51:47] but right down at the bottom it was two
[51:49] pages
[51:50] sticking together see the 16th chapter
[51:54] was on this side
[51:55] and then the continuation of the 16th
[51:58] chapter
[51:58] came up on the other side and the 17
[52:02] started on it's just perfectly exactly
[52:05] the same across
[52:06] and that indian paper real thin
[52:10] sticking together and i was reading out
[52:12] of chapter
[52:13] of the 17th chapter all the time instead
[52:16] of the 16th chapter
[52:18] so when brother branham starts 16 he
[52:20] flip he's already on 17
[52:22] for some reason and do you know what
[52:24] happened
[52:25] he was a catholic priest
[52:30] that took the bible and bring it to
[52:32] brother branham and say
[52:34] pick up the bible
[52:38] verse paragraph 37
[52:41] and i thought god why did you do that
[52:45] he's blaming god why would there be such
[52:49] a thing now
[52:51] that's my feeling you know to see what
[52:54] it was all about
[52:55] because i think nothing happens
[52:59] by chance and i was thinking about the
[53:03] comfort of this brother here coming
[53:05] telling me hold steady him being
[53:08] a priest hold steady
[53:11] maybe god is going to do something
[53:15] and suddenly a thunderbolt came down
[53:17] from heaven
[53:18] and told brother branham go to the book
[53:21] of luke
[53:22] and you're going to see when he entered
[53:24] into the synagogue
[53:25] a priest took the score and gave it to
[53:28] him
[53:29] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[53:32] amen
[53:33] so everything that is happening just pay
[53:35] attention
[53:36] maybe god is moving in a mysterious way
[53:40] he might not think like it's going
[53:41] according to your plan
[53:43] but somehow all things
[53:46] all work together for good to them that
[53:49] love god
[53:50] and those that are caught according to
[53:53] his what
[53:54] purpose amen blessed be the name of the
[53:57] lord
[53:58] now we have an announcement and i'm
[54:01] going to build it up
[54:03] with quotes in the placing of the
[54:07] deacons
[54:08] brother branham said we are building now
[54:11] and we wish to place this church and as
[54:14] a journal overseer of the church
[54:16] i must see that it's kept scripturally
[54:19] everything right on the word that's why
[54:22] i say on wednesday
[54:24] if the prophet say hey i'm going to tell
[54:26] you a if he say b
[54:28] i'm going to tell you b there is no way
[54:30] i can take the word
[54:31] and waver and play with the word or
[54:35] lower the potential of the word done
[54:38] to please anybody we're just going to
[54:40] give it to you according to the
[54:42] prescription
[54:43] because i don't want to face him and
[54:45] have to answer for somebody's blood
[54:47] i want to make sure it comes from the
[54:49] prophet and from the bible
[54:51] amen so we know we have to agree with
[54:55] the word
[54:56] if it's the word if the word is out in
[54:58] one place
[54:59] then it's out everywhere it's perfectly
[55:02] in harmony
[55:03] all the way through i just believe the
[55:05] word that
[55:07] is god's program so the word of god
[55:10] is the program of god i do not want
[55:13] anything more than the bible teaches but
[55:16] i want it all
[55:18] that it does teach i want it all
[55:21] so it's god's word now i know that god
[55:25] can do anything to can do things that is
[55:28] not written in the word
[55:30] because it's god the bible even said
[55:33] that there are many
[55:34] things that jesus did that were not even
[55:36] recorded
[55:37] in the book amen he is god he can do
[55:41] everything he desires to
[55:43] but as long as i know it is coming out
[55:46] of the world
[55:47] it just give me a good assurance that
[55:50] everything is all right i like
[55:53] that real well so when i know it's in
[55:56] the bible
[55:57] brother branham said it when i give it
[55:59] to you i can go sleep in peace because i
[56:02] know that it's not my word
[56:04] it is the word of god amen now we have
[56:07] an announcement
[56:08] and i'm going to let you know in a few
[56:10] minutes what it is
[56:12] in the unpardonable scene brother
[56:15] branham says that
[56:16] so now let us join up together let us
[56:20] be a bunch of people here in this little
[56:23] old
[56:23] tabernacle if you want
[56:27] to take that name of mine off
[56:31] the front out there they just put that
[56:34] on there so brother branham is talking
[56:36] about
[56:37] the name of the church or the name
[56:40] of the tabernacle the name of the
[56:42] tabernacle
[56:44] is branham tabernacle so brother branham
[56:47] is saying here that
[56:48] if there could be a possibility he does
[56:51] not want his name
[56:56] attached to the church
[57:01] he does not want his name attached to
[57:05] the building of the church
[57:13] the name of brother branham he doesn't
[57:16] want it to be connected
[57:18] to the church in other words he doesn't
[57:21] want it to be called
[57:22] branham tabernacle
[57:28] just call it anything you want to
[57:31] don't make any difference you can just
[57:34] call it
[57:35] church if you want to
[57:38] you don't have to be a branham
[57:41] tabernacle
[57:42] that's the prophet and that's what i'm
[57:45] gonna stand with
[57:46] amen brahm has nothing to do with
[57:50] it not at all
[57:54] not a thing they just put my name
[57:57] up there because the what
[58:01] they did was in my name there and they
[58:05] made it up so the name of brother
[58:07] branham appeared
[58:08] on the deed and because of the name
[58:12] being of the deed
[58:13] he automatically by default bring the
[58:16] name of the tabernacle
[58:18] unto his own name amen
[58:21] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:23] paragraph 241
[58:26] i went down there and worked
[58:29] during the depression brother branham
[58:30] was working
[58:32] just like your pastor is working and
[58:36] they
[58:36] brought in their water so when
[58:39] brother branham was working brother
[58:42] branham brought
[58:43] his tight into the church
[58:50] brother stephen do you pay tithe yes
[58:54] ask your trustees
[58:58] they brought their target
[59:02] instead of me keeping it
[59:05] and not working because the thought
[59:09] belonged to the pastor so brother
[59:12] branham had the right to take the title
[59:15] and use it and stop working
[59:20] say amen brother stephen have a right to
[59:24] stop working
[59:26] and put and take the title
[59:32] can you say a man
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:36] he's a dennis he doesn't need money
[59:38] [Laughter]
[59:41] instead of me keeping it and not
[59:45] working i put my own tardine
[59:50] being a pastor paying that to himself
[59:55] and my water because god in the book of
[59:59] malachi
[1:00:00] say you are cheating him in turning an
[1:00:03] offering
[1:00:04] usually turning is universal 10
[1:00:09] everybody knows it offering that's where
[1:00:11] we kill god
[1:00:13] you go to the store you buy whatever you
[1:00:16] want
[1:00:17] and you pick up the change and that's
[1:00:20] what you bring for offering
[1:00:25] amen i put my own hardening
[1:00:29] and my offering in and the money
[1:00:33] in and we built the water
[1:00:36] so the tabernacle that was first built
[1:00:40] in jeffersonville was built out of the
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:44] and the offering of the people
[1:00:47] can you say amen
[1:00:53] i want to make sure everything is
[1:00:55] standing on the word
[1:00:57] amen and it's built on the arms of the
[1:01:02] not the pastor that they give to me
[1:01:07] to make a water and i
[1:01:10] walk and put it back in there
[1:01:14] and that is the reason they call it
[1:01:17] water
[1:01:18] but at the beginning he said he doesn't
[1:01:21] want his name there
[1:01:23] so the tabernacle was built with the
[1:01:26] money out of the tax
[1:01:28] and the offering and the home that the
[1:01:30] people gave
[1:01:31] that's what they built the branham
[1:01:34] tabernacle
[1:01:35] i just read it from the prophet
[1:01:38] when i got elected here as a pastor
[1:01:42] and we place a temporary
[1:01:45] order for appointed trustees
[1:01:49] and appointed deacons until we get to
[1:01:53] the full vote which we will be doing
[1:01:54] today
[1:01:56] i told you that god gave me a job
[1:02:00] that i can still sustain myself and i
[1:02:03] will dedicate
[1:02:05] all the turning to the search
[1:02:08] of the building amen
[1:02:12] by the grace of god with the help of god
[1:02:17] with the work of spoken word tabernacle
[1:02:21] the work of the trustees the work of the
[1:02:24] deacon
[1:02:25] the work of the sisters the works of the
[1:02:28] brother
[1:02:29] last friday we close on the deal of a
[1:02:34] property and the church
[1:02:36] and everything is paid off
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:51] brad abel your song was right on time

[1:04:17] and do you know what
[1:04:19] the property value of your
[1:04:23] church amen on the market
[1:04:27] is double the price that we pray for
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:37] so if you decide to sell that church now
[1:04:41] we can get twice the money we gave
[1:04:43] cashier

[1:05:38] i don't want to go to trouble again
[1:05:44] hallelujah that's the reason they call
[1:05:48] it
[1:05:49] branham tabernacle that don't have
[1:05:53] one thing to do with it if it's called
[1:05:56] navel subernacle it's called anything
[1:05:59] you want to
[1:06:00] it don't make any difference it's just a
[1:06:03] little
[1:06:04] place that god gave us to put our
[1:06:07] head everybody clear let's continue
[1:06:11] i wish he was not what
[1:06:15] so brother branham still doesn't want
[1:06:17] his name
[1:06:18] on the property of the church
[1:06:22] do you think i'm going to do something
[1:06:23] different
[1:06:28] i wish he was just called the tabernacle
[1:06:32] didn't even have my name water
[1:06:36] i am fixing to turn this church
[1:06:40] you all know when we boarded i bought it
[1:06:44] when i worked for the public service
[1:06:45] company and put this thing
[1:06:47] up here and just call it that because
[1:06:50] that brought a c word
[1:06:52] and them attached my name to it
[1:06:55] when they put it on the deed down there
[1:06:59] just as soon as i can get clear of this
[1:07:02] thing
[1:07:03] that we are in now this church is going
[1:07:06] to be turned over to
[1:07:08] a community and just given my name water
[1:07:13] so when it was the time to put the name
[1:07:16] i was asked brother stephen what is the
[1:07:19] name we're going to put on the church
[1:07:21] property
[1:07:22] i say brother branham never wanted his
[1:07:25] church
[1:07:27] to bear his own name i don't want you to
[1:07:30] put my name
[1:07:31] if i need the house i need to buy my
[1:07:33] house myself
[1:07:36] are you there this is the house of the
[1:07:38] lord
[1:07:39] i say put the name of spoken word
[1:07:42] tabernacle so if you have question
[1:07:46] the church belong to spoken word
[1:07:49] tabernacle
[1:07:50] that's it
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:07:59] as a pastor i'm going to protect it i'm
[1:08:02] going to watch over it
[1:08:03] i'm going to take care of it but it is
[1:08:05] not my church
[1:08:10] i want that to sink in
[1:08:14] copy this and keep it
[1:08:18] i don't think my name ought to be on
[1:08:21] that church
[1:08:22] he ought not to be a branham tabernacle
[1:08:26] should just be the church of the lord
[1:08:28] jesus christ
[1:08:31] or something like that the tabernacle of
[1:08:34] the lord
[1:08:35] the dwelling place the house of prayer
[1:08:38] he's giving you many names
[1:08:39] or something another giving some kind of
[1:08:42] a name
[1:08:43] let the what congregation choose there
[1:08:47] and this congregation shows the name of
[1:08:50] what
[1:08:50] spoken word tabernacle that's the name
[1:08:54] on the deed
[1:08:58] hallelujah my name i'm just a man
[1:09:02] my name don't deserve that's a prophet

[1:11:23] the quickest you work with your tithing
[1:11:25] and your offering
[1:11:27] the easier we're going to go ahead and

[1:11:34] don't want to patch work
[1:11:36] i don't want to put a carpet and in two
[1:11:38] years we change the carpet

[1:12:06] so how are we going to continue brother
[1:12:08] stephen
[1:12:09] are we going to continue to get money
[1:12:11] out of the turning
[1:12:12] let's read brother branham would it be
[1:12:15] wrong
[1:12:16] to use stars on church building funds
[1:12:23] here is a touchy little things now
[1:12:27] for the church now no
[1:12:32] say amen at the beginning it worked
[1:12:37] now no
[1:12:41] correctly task is to go to the
[1:12:45] that's right in the bible they had a
[1:12:49] box that is set at the door in the old
[1:12:52] testament
[1:12:53] when the building this box was a found
[1:12:57] where the people put in for the water
[1:13:00] you have read it many times in the old
[1:13:02] testament
[1:13:04] they kept the building they kept up the
[1:13:06] building and things like that
[1:13:08] all the repair on the building was taken
[1:13:10] care of that found
[1:13:12] but a tenth of one of that
[1:13:16] a tenth of the turning all the time went
[1:13:19] to the
[1:13:21] to there yes starting our goal
[1:13:24] out to go for nothing else i know people
[1:13:28] take their thought
[1:13:29] and give them to a widow woman that is
[1:13:34] if you get anything to give to the widow
[1:13:37] mugu man
[1:13:38] give her but don't give her what
[1:13:42] timing is what that is
[1:13:46] not yours in the first place
[1:13:49] that is what so if you notice here
[1:13:52] brother branham said
[1:13:53] there was a box put other outside of the
[1:13:56] church for building
[1:13:58] funds that's your next stage now
[1:14:05] i started like branham tabernacle and
[1:14:07] i'm putting you back like branham
[1:14:09] tabernacle
[1:14:10] are you there where did brother branham
[1:14:12] get that scripture
[1:14:16] give me time with grace with your time
[1:14:19] first king chapter 12 verse 9 to 12
[1:14:22] by jehoiad that the priest took a what
[1:14:25] a box anybody there and bore
[1:14:28] a hole in the lid of it and set it
[1:14:31] beside the altar
[1:14:33] on the right side as one cometh into the
[1:14:36] house of door
[1:14:38] trustees get that pretty good and the
[1:14:41] priest
[1:14:42] that kept the door put there in all the
[1:14:44] water
[1:14:46] that was brought in into the house of
[1:14:48] the lord
[1:14:49] and it was so when they saw that there
[1:14:52] was
[1:14:52] so much there was much money in the
[1:14:55] chest
[1:14:56] the box that described the king scrub
[1:14:59] and the high priest came up and they put
[1:15:02] up
[1:15:02] in what and told the money in other
[1:15:06] words
[1:15:06] as trustees we must give a report of
[1:15:09] what is coming up
[1:15:10] from the building funds amen
[1:15:13] and taught the money that was found in
[1:15:15] the house of the lord
[1:15:17] and they gave the money being told
[1:15:20] reported
[1:15:21] into the hand of what them that did
[1:15:24] though that had the oversight of the
[1:15:27] house of the lord
[1:15:28] and they led it out to the
[1:15:32] and uh that wrought upon the house of
[1:15:35] the lord
[1:15:36] and to the and what
[1:15:39] to do what and young stone
[1:15:42] to what the breaches of the house of the
[1:15:46] lord and
[1:15:46] for all that was laid out for the house
[1:15:50] of two
[1:15:51] in other words the entire project they
[1:15:54] have
[1:15:54] put down when the money comes
[1:15:58] this is the way the money is going to
[1:15:59] all be operated
[1:16:01] we're just putting the church back into
[1:16:03] the world everybody clear so far
[1:16:06] all right we're almost done and at the
[1:16:08] king's commandment
[1:16:10] ii chronicle they made a water
[1:16:13] and set it without the gate of the house
[1:16:16] of the lord
[1:16:17] and they made a proclamation through
[1:16:19] judah and jerusalem
[1:16:20] to bring into the lord water
[1:16:24] so brother jim and brother micah deli
[1:16:28] if god permits that they are for their
[1:16:31] trustees
[1:16:32] you're gonna see them here reminding you
[1:16:36] that when you have twenty dollars we
[1:16:38] have work to do
[1:16:40] when you have a hundred dollars we have
[1:16:42] work to do
[1:16:43] when you have a thousand dollars we have
[1:16:46] work to do
[1:16:47] when you have twenty thousand dollars
[1:16:53] that's the ministry of brother michael
[1:16:55] and chima
[1:16:56] they are anointed when they say that
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] the collection that moses the servant of
[1:17:02] god laid upon
[1:17:04] israel in the water so even in the
[1:17:07] building of the tabernacle in the
[1:17:09] wilderness there was a collection that
[1:17:11] was made
[1:17:12] for the building ever clear
[1:17:15] praise the name of the lord and all the
[1:17:18] princes
[1:17:19] and all the people did what so when they
[1:17:23] told them about bringing money for the
[1:17:25] building they were not sad
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:34] they were not crying and say out to my
[1:17:37] paycheck again
[1:17:42] what a pastor god gave you
[1:17:44] [Laughter]
[1:17:46] and all the princes and all the people
[1:17:49] did what
[1:17:50] and brought in because god wants a
[1:17:53] cheerful what
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:57] it just dropped and brought in
[1:18:00] and cast into the water this is not the
[1:18:03] offering
[1:18:04] this is for the building repair building
[1:18:06] fund
[1:18:07] until they had made air now it came to
[1:18:11] pass
[1:18:12] that at what time the chest was brought
[1:18:14] unto the king's office
[1:18:16] by the hand of the leaver and when they
[1:18:18] saw that there was
[1:18:19] much money the king's crab and the high
[1:18:22] priest officer
[1:18:24] came and did what emptied the chest
[1:18:27] and who did what and who did what
[1:18:31] where in other words when brother
[1:18:34] michael daley and brother chim
[1:18:35] empty the money to continue to make your
[1:18:39] building look pretty
[1:18:40] they're gonna come back again here with
[1:18:42] the basket
[1:18:43] and remind you over again that we still
[1:18:46] need
[1:18:47] money to finish the building everybody
[1:18:50] clear
[1:18:50] they have to carry the box back to its
[1:18:53] place
[1:18:55] i'm reading you the scripture i want you
[1:18:57] to be
[1:18:58] based on the scripture anybody clear
[1:19:01] and the high priest officer came and
[1:19:04] emptied the chest and took it and
[1:19:05] carried to his place
[1:19:07] again thus they did what
[1:19:11] and got the money in what abundance
[1:19:14] and the king and jehoiada gave
[1:19:17] it to such as did the work of the
[1:19:20] service of the house of the lord
[1:19:22] and hired mason and carpenter to repair
[1:19:25] the house of the lord
[1:19:26] and also such as wrote iron and brass to
[1:19:30] man
[1:19:30] to house of the lord so from now on
[1:19:35] offering offering turning turning
[1:19:39] money for building money for building it
[1:19:41] is up to the pastor himself
[1:19:44] if he want to pull money from the tiding
[1:19:46] and put it
[1:19:47] for the building fund and it's not gonna
[1:19:49] be an ownership
[1:19:51] but when he get in the building found it
[1:19:53] turn up from padding
[1:19:55] in morphe into building fun so that
[1:19:57] there is no claim to be put on
[1:20:02] anybody clear anybody clear in other
[1:20:05] words when we take the money we put it
[1:20:07] on building fund
[1:20:09] the name of that money is building fund
[1:20:12] it is no longer pastor's money
[1:20:20] when you bring your tattoo you put it in

[1:22:42] of fact an anointing dropped

[1:22:46] brother robert farby
[1:22:48] anybody clear the one
[1:22:52] looking like a boss back there
[1:22:56] when i look at this i say i'm gonna get
[1:22:58] him on this one
[1:23:00] that's brother michael daley
[1:23:04] and the one looking on the on the
[1:23:07] on the black jacket over there very
[1:23:09] simple like man
[1:23:11] that is brother jim cabello
[1:23:14] at the beginning when we presented to
[1:23:16] you the officer
[1:23:18] you don't really vote song leaders
[1:23:22] song leader are appointed and that's it
[1:23:25] at the beginning when we presented you
[1:23:28] the officer
[1:23:29] for the trustees and the deacon among
[1:23:32] those officers
[1:23:33] we have brother abel cardinal
[1:23:36] you might have a question why is brother
[1:23:38] elbow not there
[1:23:40] brother is a wonderful brother brother
[1:23:43] rebel
[1:23:44] is one of our song leaders here and he's
[1:23:47] helping on the computer
[1:23:48] he's helping with instrument the post or
[1:23:52] the duty of a deacon
[1:23:54] requires a certain consistency on the
[1:23:56] church
[1:23:57] a deacon must be there but with his job
[1:24:01] and uh the way he's moving he's a man
[1:24:04] that traveled quite a bit so he never
[1:24:08] done anything wrong
[1:24:09] he didn't sin you on the internet he
[1:24:12] didn't do anything wrong
[1:24:15] so don't call people here and trying to
[1:24:17] check why is not brother everybody
[1:24:21] amen so we talk with brother abel
[1:24:24] and his shift to help brother david more
[1:24:27] on the computer
[1:24:29] and on the sound system and he's still
[1:24:32] one of our song leaders
[1:24:34] and even on wednesday sometime one of
[1:24:37] the deacon might be out he's still going
[1:24:39] to continue to help us
[1:24:41] pick up the offering and doing the
[1:24:42] things just like he did this morning
[1:24:45] but the reason why we shift him a little
[1:24:47] bit is just because
[1:24:48] he had to travel go out and come back go
[1:24:51] out and come back
[1:24:52] and even when he's out he's still in
[1:24:55] church
[1:24:57] amen he's not there outside and missing
[1:25:00] church
[1:25:01] and when he comes back on his way back
[1:25:03] he always
[1:25:04] catch up on the sermon so we didn't
[1:25:07] shift him
[1:25:08] because there is anything wrong no
[1:25:10] because the office of a deacon
[1:25:13] requires certain consistency somebody to
[1:25:15] be there
[1:25:16] when the service out there and we don't
[1:25:18] want anybody being complaining like
[1:25:20] hey the deacon is not there or anything

[1:31:35] it's only few still few
[1:31:41] okay so your church belongs to you

[1:32:10] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:32:14] towards you
[1:32:16] this is not my thought this is not your
[1:32:19] thought
[1:32:20] this is god's thoughts towards you amen
[1:32:25] hallelujah says the lord
[1:32:29] thoughts of what and not of what
[1:32:34] to give you what a
[1:32:37] hopeful end so the purpose
[1:32:40] the plan of god for your life
[1:32:43] is at the end you're going to come
[1:32:45] upright
[1:32:48] sometimes he might thinks like it's
[1:32:50] troubling
[1:32:52] sometimes he might be hard on the road
[1:32:54] but
[1:32:55] that is not his intent amen
[1:32:59] the finishing line there is an expected
[1:33:02] end
[1:33:03] there is a good result there is
[1:33:06] something good that's going to come out
[1:33:08] of it
[1:33:11] anybody clear let's go to john chapter
[1:33:14] one
[1:33:16] the thoughts of god the plans of god
[1:33:19] are not to harm you
[1:33:23] you got the holy ghost you get in
[1:33:24] trouble but that's not the thought of
[1:33:26] god
[1:33:27] not to bring you the rest so that you
[1:33:30] can be in trouble
[1:33:33] anybody clear because it looks like they
[1:33:35] got the water from rephrasing
[1:33:37] and the amalekite rose i thought we're
[1:33:41] getting into rest
[1:33:42] then we got into trouble that is not his
[1:33:44] thought
[1:33:47] john chapter 1 verse 12 you might be
[1:33:49] seated
[1:33:51] but as many as received him
[1:33:54] receive who to them
[1:33:58] gave him power you remember on wednesday
[1:34:01] you must receive you must accept it you
[1:34:04] remember on wednesday
[1:34:06] as many as receive him to those that
[1:34:09] receive him that accepted it
[1:34:11] to them gave him what so when you
[1:34:15] accept the word of god there is a hidden
[1:34:19] power
[1:34:20] that is automatically transferred to you
[1:34:24] what is the purpose of that power
[1:34:26] because we see on wednesday that you
[1:34:28] don't have to do
[1:34:30] anything amen
[1:34:33] to them gave him power to do what
[1:34:37] to become the sons of what so
[1:34:40] when god sent the gospel to you when god
[1:34:44] sent the message to you oh the gospel
[1:34:48] he said that message there is a
[1:34:51] power of transformation
[1:34:56] brother branham preach a message amen
[1:34:59] when you receive the message inside that
[1:35:02] message there is a power
[1:35:05] to take you and to make you exactly
[1:35:09] what god intended you to be
[1:35:12] because the spoken word is the original
[1:35:15] word
[1:35:16] and every seed must be reproduced
[1:35:18] according to what
[1:35:21] so when you get so you are a bedding
[1:35:23] ground
[1:35:24] so when you open your heart and the word
[1:35:28] come and get on your bedding ground if
[1:35:31] you just put your car in neutral
[1:35:33] the world itself have power to take you
[1:35:37] from
[1:35:37] egg to sea
[1:35:42] hallelujah he gave you power
[1:35:45] to become the sons of god even to them
[1:35:49] that what
[1:35:50] so that acceptance is belief
[1:35:55] i'm reading to you the bible accepted
[1:36:00] it's the same as belief
[1:36:03] faith anybody there even to them that
[1:36:07] believe on his name
[1:36:09] which were born not of what
[1:36:12] flesh no of the will of the
[1:36:17] know of the will of what but of what
[1:36:20] you are born by the will of god
[1:36:25] hallelujah job to verse 16
[1:36:28] and of his what the fullness of who
[1:36:33] have all we received
[1:36:37] what grace for grace
[1:36:40] so christ is the fullness of the godhead
[1:36:42] badly
[1:36:44] and there is room for everybody and from
[1:36:47] that fullness
[1:36:48] everybody receive their grace for grace
[1:36:52] because by one spirit we are all what
[1:36:56] baptized into what one body
[1:36:59] praise the name of the lord let's go to
[1:37:01] ephesians chapter 2
[1:37:03] then we will pray
[1:37:07] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:37:11] we heard too much about the new birth we
[1:37:13] need to get it
[1:37:16] because the second banquet deal with the
[1:37:18] change of the body
[1:37:20] anybody could yeah ephesians chapter 2
[1:37:24] verse 8 for by words
[1:37:30] okay somebody's awake cool
[1:37:33] so by grace are you
[1:37:36] through what remember here
[1:37:40] accept and believe okay
[1:37:43] how can i get that faith and
[1:37:46] that's not of yourself it doesn't come
[1:37:50] from you
[1:37:50] amen it is what
[1:37:54] so that faith is a gift god gives you
[1:37:58] in other words god bring you the program
[1:38:01] to be saved and just loaded
[1:38:05] just let the computer run
[1:38:08] amen verse nine not
[1:38:11] of quirks lest any man should do what
[1:38:15] god don't want you to boast for we are
[1:38:18] his workmanship
[1:38:19] created in christ jesus to good works
[1:38:23] which god had before or then
[1:38:26] that we should do jump what
[1:38:29] verse 18 for
[1:38:33] through him we both have what
[1:38:37] by what to whom
[1:38:42] everybody here go to chapter 4 of
[1:38:45] ephesian
[1:38:47] you should know this scripture even by
[1:38:49] memory
[1:38:50] everybody there verse 30.
[1:38:55] and grieve not what
[1:38:59] whereby you were still until the day of
[1:39:02] what
[1:39:04] so there is an a and there is a z
[1:39:07] anybody clear
[1:39:08] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:39:11] you again for your grace
[1:39:13] father you love your mercy for giving us
[1:39:16] a building that we can call ours
[1:39:19] father we thank you for a wonderful
[1:39:21] congregation
[1:39:23] that dedicated their oh lord father to
[1:39:26] make this happen
[1:39:27] lord we thank you for everything and we
[1:39:30] thank you for giving us even another
[1:39:32] opportunity this morning
[1:39:34] to gather together around the revealed
[1:39:36] word of the hour
[1:39:37] lord we did what every man here on
[1:39:40] planet earth
[1:39:41] with a correct and normal ability can do
[1:39:43] father but
[1:39:44] as long as coming and unfolding your
[1:39:47] word and giving revelation to your
[1:39:48] children
[1:39:49] it takes a grace from you lord may you
[1:39:52] move me completely out of the way
[1:39:54] may you speak to your children tonight
[1:39:56] may the devil be completely sealed out
[1:39:59] may only the holy spirit be sealed in
[1:40:02] those that are weak lord
[1:40:04] may you touch them those that are lord
[1:40:06] father that feel like they're tired
[1:40:09] and that the devil is trying to put them
[1:40:11] asleep lord
[1:40:12] father may you shake that demon away
[1:40:14] from this place
[1:40:15] in the name of jesus christ father we
[1:40:18] commit all and everything unto the hand
[1:40:20] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:40:24] god bless you we are on part 30 in the
[1:40:26] part 15
[1:40:27] of king ahazary street fist and esther
[1:40:30] to banquet
[1:40:31] we spoke about the first fifth the
[1:40:33] second the third
[1:40:35] the first banquet and in preparation to
[1:40:37] the second banquet
[1:40:38] we are trying to get the two aspects
[1:40:41] that david spoke
[1:40:42] about the redemption with crying uh
[1:40:45] david crying for the redemption of the
[1:40:47] soul
[1:40:47] and the redemption of the body everybody
[1:40:50] clear
[1:40:51] when we spoke about referendum we
[1:40:53] unfolded that referendum
[1:40:55] was a place of rest everybody clear so
[1:40:58] as we built from psalm 63
[1:41:02] david says there that my soul
[1:41:05] just for thee and my flesh
[1:41:08] also longest for thee and on wednesday
[1:41:11] we explain to you
[1:41:13] that when we are born according to
[1:41:15] ephesians chapter 2
[1:41:17] we are born in sin shaping iniquity
[1:41:20] coming into the word speaking lies and
[1:41:23] by nature we were also
[1:41:25] children of what disobedience everybody
[1:41:28] clear
[1:41:29] so when you are born in this world both
[1:41:32] your outer man everybody there
[1:41:36] and your inner man or your inside man
[1:41:39] both of them are black or dark
[1:41:43] in other words you have sin on the other
[1:41:45] man
[1:41:46] and you also have a sinful nature
[1:41:49] on your inside so when you get to the
[1:41:52] place where you begin to thrust
[1:41:54] after god because god put you in a
[1:41:57] certain corner
[1:41:59] that you have to be looking unto him
[1:42:01] when you get to that place that you're
[1:42:03] testing
[1:42:04] god will bring you in referendum
[1:42:06] everybody clear
[1:42:07] and in referendum you move from the
[1:42:10] stage one
[1:42:11] that you were born and you go to stage
[1:42:14] two
[1:42:15] and in stage two your inside man
[1:42:18] becomes now light or converted
[1:42:22] over here it's dark on the outside and
[1:42:25] it's also
[1:42:26] dark on the inside this is your first
[1:42:28] church
[1:42:29] yo your first stage which is our natural
[1:42:32] birth
[1:42:32] everybody clear so when you move to the
[1:42:35] spiritual birth
[1:42:36] everybody there what happened is when
[1:42:39] the holy spirit come
[1:42:41] to you the holy spirit will clean your
[1:42:44] inside and take that sinful nature
[1:42:47] out of you then your inside man
[1:42:50] is now born again your inside man
[1:42:53] become the white dog that we explained
[1:42:55] to you
[1:42:56] but the black dog is still on the
[1:42:59] outside
[1:43:00] which is still seen everybody there when
[1:43:03] you are born you have a black dog
[1:43:06] outside and you have a black dog inside
[1:43:09] when you are born again you have a white
[1:43:12] dog on the inside
[1:43:13] and you have a black dog on the outside
[1:43:16] that's why the fight started
[1:43:18] there is no way a fight can start
[1:43:21] between a dark and a duck
[1:43:23] because jesus told us that if satan
[1:43:26] fights satan
[1:43:27] what happened to his kingdom is going to
[1:43:29] be divided anybody there
[1:43:31] so the only way war can be proclaimed
[1:43:34] is only when white darkness everybody
[1:43:38] else
[1:43:39] in heaven everything was fine everything
[1:43:42] was peaceful
[1:43:44] until lucifer initiated sin
[1:43:48] when sin was initiated one was declared
[1:43:51] in heaven
[1:43:53] amen because there were two kingdoms now
[1:43:56] trying to fight for a position anybody
[1:43:58] clear so far
[1:44:00] now david says that when he's born
[1:44:03] born in sin sharpening iniquity coming
[1:44:06] into the word
[1:44:07] speaking lies and as a child of god
[1:44:10] brother bonham explained to us that when
[1:44:12] you are born
[1:44:14] god blesses in your soul a predestinated
[1:44:18] seed there
[1:44:19] that is laying dormant everybody clear
[1:44:22] so that is the difference between you
[1:44:26] and the sinner even though you are still
[1:44:29] sinner
[1:44:30] amen when they check the microscope
[1:44:34] they will see that in the life of
[1:44:36] certain people there is nothing to
[1:44:38] quicken
[1:44:39] but the difference between you and that
[1:44:41] person is that within your soul
[1:44:44] god bless a seed that seed was placed
[1:44:48] there for a purpose
[1:44:50] and that is the seed that was making
[1:44:54] david cry
[1:44:56] because that seed does not like darkness
[1:45:00] that seed does not lack the condition
[1:45:03] you go to the night club you drunk
[1:45:07] you come back everybody is happy but
[1:45:10] something in you make you sad
[1:45:12] you go in the bed of prostitution you
[1:45:16] do everything that everybody is doing
[1:45:18] somebody's happy
[1:45:19] when you come you are sad that sadness
[1:45:23] it is god in you already
[1:45:26] telling you that i don't like the life
[1:45:28] that you are living
[1:45:30] that's why the david that was crying
[1:45:33] is not this devil it is not
[1:45:36] this david but it is this david right
[1:45:40] here
[1:45:41] that was crying to be delivered on the
[1:45:43] soul
[1:45:44] and also under flesh
[1:45:48] everybody clear so far he said my soul
[1:45:51] longest and even fainted for the court
[1:45:55] of the lord
[1:45:56] my what which is the occupancy of the
[1:45:58] soul
[1:45:59] and my word cry out for the word
[1:46:03] because only a living god not a dead god
[1:46:08] only the lord god can deliver you from
[1:46:11] this sinful condition
[1:46:13] ever clear so far press the name of the
[1:46:16] lord
[1:46:17] so when they reach that place in

[2:07:56] do you see that here the black dog is
[2:07:59] fighting the white dog we make it
[2:08:02] simple until a child can see that
[2:08:05] and the spirit against her so

[2:12:12] it means you have a problem with your
[2:12:14] birth because
[2:12:15] paul says that the holy ghost shed the
[2:12:18] love of god in your heart
[2:12:20] but if you love the word and the things
[2:12:22] of the world

[2:13:43] take over
[2:13:44] that nature so peter is saying that be

[2:20:03] this is guaranteed and this is the
[2:20:06] victory
[2:20:07] that overcometh the word even our what
[2:20:11] what is faith
[2:20:15] anybody okay what is
[2:20:19] faith
[2:20:22] faith is something that is what
[2:20:26] that is not yet but you believe

[2:20:48] of god for your life hallelujah

[2:20:56] is a water from who
[2:20:59] ephesians say it is a gift of what
[2:21:03] peter flesh and blood have not
[2:21:06] revealed this to you but who
[2:21:13] now faith is a revelation there
[2:21:16] is where i want to stay there just a
[2:21:19] moment
[2:21:20] it is a revelation he has revealed it to
[2:21:23] you
[2:21:24] by his
[2:21:27] it is what nothing you did
[2:21:31] you didn't work yourself up into what
[2:21:35] may i have the faith faith is coming
[2:21:38] faith is coming
[2:21:38] fairfield's coming fairfield's coming
[2:21:42] how do you crank your car in the morning
[2:21:45] who told you your car is going to be
[2:21:46] cranked
[2:21:48] faithful amen
[2:21:52] faith hallelujah you
[2:21:55] ever have faith it is give
[2:21:59] it's give to you by the grace of god
[2:22:02] and god reveals it to you therefore
[2:22:05] faith is whatever that's why when satan
[2:22:09] was
[2:22:09] attacking peter jesus said
[2:22:12] peter i pray for you
[2:22:18] because peter had the revelation of who
[2:22:21] christ was
[2:22:22] he said i'm gonna pray for you that your
[2:22:25] faith will not fail
[2:22:27] and peter went and made three mistakes
[2:22:30] when jesus christ resurrected he said
[2:22:32] god tell my disciple and who
[2:22:34] peter god tell him i still love him
[2:22:39] god tell him i pray for him
[2:22:43] hallelujah and the whole
[2:22:46] church of god is built upon the
[2:22:49] revelation
[2:22:50] they were all good people we shall say
[2:22:53] there is some
[2:22:54] that is trying hard to believe it trying
[2:22:57] to work themselves into it
[2:22:59] some just can't do it at all another
[2:23:02] it's by grace
[2:23:04] it is just what given to them now
[2:23:07] there is the difference we don't want
[2:23:10] you to work for
[2:23:11] faith
[2:23:15] lord help my unbelief
[2:23:19] that's all amen jude 1
[2:23:24] we're going with faith paul
[2:23:28] was done here in the natural realm
[2:23:31] with his phd see he didn't know
[2:23:34] he had an intellectual faith but he
[2:23:37] didn't have water
[2:23:39] there is quite a difference in me having
[2:23:42] an intellectual faith
[2:23:44] than a divine faithful you get the
[2:23:47] intellectual faith by that
[2:23:49] but it must be a divine revelation of
[2:23:52] who
[2:23:52] jesus christ to you that does what
[2:23:57] so the faith here is the one that
[2:24:01] killed the black dog
[2:24:04] that is the faith that overcome the
[2:24:08] world
[2:24:09] because he already overcome your world
[2:24:12] nature in your soul
[2:24:14] he's gonna shoot the black dog in your
[2:24:17] flesh
[2:24:23] intellectual faith is not enough that's
[2:24:26] all right because you must understand
[2:24:29] what they're preaching to you but it
[2:24:31] only brings you
[2:24:33] to the what holy spirit the holy spirit
[2:24:36] is a what
[2:24:37] personal experience of the
[2:24:40] birth the new birth regeneration
[2:24:44] regeneration
[2:24:46] making a new world a new creature in
[2:24:49] what
[2:24:50] you are here you are no more the man
[2:24:52] that was over there
[2:24:53] because that nature is what dead
[2:24:57] what is the new birth then
[2:25:01] break it down you say well brother
[2:25:05] branham
[2:25:06] what is the new birth it is the water
[2:25:09] of jesus christ water to what
[2:25:14] it is your own personal anchor
[2:25:18] not mama's faithful not that is faith

[2:26:08] message it won't do you

[2:26:18] and his faith it is the white dog
[2:26:21] faithful
[2:26:22] and anything that is contrary to him
