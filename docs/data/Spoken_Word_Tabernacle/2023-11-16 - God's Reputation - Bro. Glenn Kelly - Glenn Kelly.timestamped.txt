[50:09] God's Gathering his bride up all around

[50:13] right that's right brother Seth just
[50:15] like he said he's going to gather him up
[50:18] so let's look at uh verse uh 26 I don't
[50:21] mean to have you standing I appreciate

[50:34] created he him male and female he
[50:37] created them you may be seated let's
[50:40] turn over to uh Matthew 20 Matthew
[50:44] 24 we'll see which way he go uh by the
[50:48] grace of God I don't know which way the
[50:50] Lord's going to go but uh I just want to
[50:52] get myself out of the way so he can have
[50:55] his way I'm just a clay and he's the
[50:58] Potter and so we're looking here tonight
[51:00] you know we're looking at uh the
[51:02] reputation um as a Christian you know
[51:06] the reputation as a Christian I was just
[51:08] got the inspiration I was kind of
[51:11] listening to Memorial and something uh
[51:13] the prophet of God said in there let's
[51:16] look at verse 32 I'm going read also
[51:18] Matthew
[51:20] 2432 he says now let a parable of the
[51:23] Fig Tree which his branch is yet tender
[51:26] and putteth forth his leaves you know
[51:29] that the summer is nigh of course we
[51:31] know the Fig Tree is Israel and we see
[51:34] what's going on now we know recognize
[51:36] that the uh fig tree came forth in 1947
[51:40] right they was Bud they became a nation
[51:43] and um so it's been a while now is that
[51:45] right because we looking up now you know
[51:48] God's getting things mounting up
[51:50] according to the scriptures we getting
[51:52] ready to get up out of here he says now
[51:55] he says so likewise ye when ye shall see
[51:59] all these things know that it is near
[52:02] even at the doors and and forgive me I
[52:04] say good night I mean rapturing time we
[52:06] getting ready to body change somebody
[52:08] don't want to take it literally okay he
[52:10] says he said verily I say unto you this
[52:13] generation shall not pass through all
[52:15] these things be fulfilled but this the
[52:17] part of the scripture I wanted to look
[52:19] at Heaven and Earth shall pass away but
[52:23] my words shall not pass you know we were
[52:26] in there and uh we got another scripture
[52:29] Matthew 6 same book let's go to Matthew
[52:31] 6 because I got a uh some quotes I want
[52:35] to read here tonight and y'all be
[52:37] praying with
[52:39] me God know which way he want us to uh
[52:42] to go Matthew
[52:45] 6 and we know the Lord been working in
[52:48] prayer been doing the beautiful thing
[52:50] for us God's been uh really tearing
[52:52] Satan's kingdom down is that right
[52:55] prophet of God said that's one of the
[52:56] most powerful weapons we can have is
[52:58] prayer is that right so now you're
[53:00] moving into that those secret weapon is
[53:03] that right they talking about the
[53:04] weapons they flying around over there in
[53:06] Israel is that right they talking about
[53:08] the weapons that can knock down missiles
[53:10] out of the air but we got a me we got a
[53:13] weapon that can tear it all down don't
[53:15] we prayer is that right we could drive a
[53:17] demon out of a man life we can move
[53:20] anything out by prayer is that right God
[53:23] said speak the word is that that right
[53:26] oh Hallelujah help us Lord he said now
[53:29] look he says he says after this manner
[53:32] therefore verse 9 Matthew 6 and9 he says
[53:36] pray ye what Our Father which are in
[53:39] heaven and Hallowed be thy name is that
[53:41] right the Lord's been teaching us how we
[53:44] addressing we addressing our great
[53:46] father he's a mighty God is that right
[53:48] he want us to worship him we lift him up
[53:51] on high he says that Hallowed be thy
[53:54] name holy be thy name he said thy
[53:56] kingdom come and thy will be what done
[53:59] in earth as it is in heaven not just the
[54:02] kingdom coming but God also want us to
[54:04] bring it up is that right we going to
[54:07] come up as he come down we going to come
[54:09] up uhhuh I know parents it is now see
[54:12] praise the Lord hallelujah he said now
[54:16] look as it is in heaven he said give us
[54:19] this what day our what Daily Bread may
[54:23] the Lord this is where I wanted to uh
[54:25] look at by the grace of God I got the
[54:27] little inspiration that struck me is
[54:29] when the Lord was showing us you know
[54:31] he's giv us this Daily Bread day by day
[54:35] is that right so the things I didn't ask
[54:37] for I've been asking for huh I've been
[54:40] asking for because the Lord told us ask
[54:43] and it shall be what given and seek it
[54:46] shall find and knock it shall what open
[54:49] is that right because lord said this is
[54:51] the hour now that we can do these things
[54:54] so we want you look at here but he said
[54:57] daily bread and when we look that so
[54:59] that mean God has a reputation God has
[55:03] to keep a reputation anytime God says a
[55:07] word you don't have to worry about it
[55:10] comeing to pass because God got a
[55:13] reputation to
[55:14] [Applause]
[55:17] keep and if he got a reputation to
[55:20] keeping now the devil we got the answer
[55:23] for the devil's problem for the devil's
[55:26] we got his answer is that right a
[55:29] reputation is a overall quality or
[55:32] character as seen or judged by people in
[55:35] general he says you see the
[55:38] characteristics or
[55:40] ability so a car so no matter who you
[55:43] are no matter what position you are no
[55:46] matter what walks of life you are no
[55:48] matter what sex you are no matter how
[55:51] old you are you are living for of what
[55:54] you have a reputation people are
[55:57] watching your character people are
[56:00] watching as you you walking that's why
[56:02] he was saying that what we have a
[56:05] reputation as a what a Christian is that
[56:08] right you we're not a Catholic we're not
[56:11] a Baptist we're not a Methodist we're
[56:13] not a Lutheran we're nothing against the
[56:16] people but we're against the doctrine is
[56:19] that right we don't have that kind of
[56:21] Doctrine because why if you study under
[56:24] the Catholic you become a Catholic uhhuh
[56:27] if you study under a Baptist you become
[56:29] a Baptist is that right if you study up
[56:32] under a Pentecostal you become a
[56:35] Pentecostal is that right but God has
[56:38] bringing his bride a word that he has BR
[56:42] he says up we going to be studying under
[56:45] the message of the hour so we become the
[56:48] what the Bride of Jesus Christ is that
[56:51] right so you what you Tak in the word
[56:54] you become the word in the beginning was
[56:57] the word the Word was God the word was
[57:01] with God and the Word was made flesh is
[57:04] that right so now we coming here our
[57:07] example is Christ Christ is the word now
[57:10] in Christ they were called Christlike
[57:14] and Antioch is that right so we now
[57:17] we're being molded and shape in the
[57:20] character of Christ we may not appear to
[57:22] be like him but we will be just like him
[57:25] when we come is that right so we know
[57:28] God has a reputation and that's why he
[57:31] say his daily bread uh I give you that
[57:34] Daily Bread every day Saints that means
[57:38] there something essential God will get
[57:41] you the essentials God will meet all of
[57:44] your needs uh that's what God said he's
[57:47] going to do oh Pastor the Lord is
[57:50] unfolding so much in this hour here now
[57:53] Saints it's bringing us to another level
[57:56] you have to remember praying church is
[57:58] over with right we coming in the time
[58:01] here now we're moving into the position
[58:04] as that bride and just bear with me uhoh
[58:07] I guess you're on overtime again last
[58:08] time I was here you was on overtime let
[58:11] me start this clock here huh I tell you
[58:14] Lord forgive
[58:15] me he said
[58:18] what I'm learning y'all I'm learning I'm
[58:22] learning y'all got be I went back to my
[58:23] papers tonight I said I going fool with
[58:26] that that computer tonight
[58:29] brother huh Hallelujah y'all pray with
[58:33] me Hallelujah we talking about what we
[58:37] talking about a reputation when a man's
[58:40] got a reputation people are watching
[58:42] that character so now God saying we are
[58:46] what the Bride of Jesus Christ is that
[58:49] right now in this church is going to
[58:51] have what the spoken word Tabernacle
[58:54] spok broken word mean it has a
[58:56] reputation is that right you cannot mix
[58:59] Creeds and then dogs much with coming
[59:02] through here is that right you got there
[59:04] one law is love it's one book but the
[59:08] Bible it's one called Creed but Christ
[59:11] is that right and Christ is the anointed
[59:13] word in the Holy Ghost form and this our
[59:17] here now is that right that's why when
[59:19] you take the reputation on being the
[59:22] bride the Holy Spirit loves the word uh
[59:25] he loves for you to pray and read the
[59:28] word uh that's why the pastor is asking
[59:30] you what he's asking you is that right
[59:32] he's bringing up for the time bringing
[59:34] you up into this age what God is
[59:37] expecting and what God is expecting out
[59:39] of us in this age here is that right
[59:43] bear with me tonight Lord have mercy I
[59:45] know some of you ate out in your car
[59:47] some of you came right from work pray
[59:49] with us on tonight we ask the Lord God
[59:52] who's rich in Mercy help us the Lord he
[59:55] said

[1:01:09] could be homeless you could be from the
[1:01:11] bush you could be from the concrete
[1:01:13] jungle it doesn't matter everybody has
[1:01:16] to have a reputation it's a certain
[1:01:18] character reputation that's going to
[1:01:21] identify you to the ones that's watching
[1:01:24] you
[1:01:25] let us keep going but at this time here
[1:01:27] they was trying to build a bridge and it
[1:01:30] was numerous people that didn't have the
[1:01:32] have the wisdom and knowledge to build
[1:01:35] this bridge uh is that right but this
[1:01:37] man here he had the reputation of

[1:45:56] that's why he says the word uh is
[1:45:59] greater than the name Psalms 138 the
[1:46:02] word is greater than the name why
[1:46:04] because Paul says that preaching other
[1:46:07] jesuses even in this

[1:52:00] prayer
[1:52:01] it amen am let's keep them in prayer
[1:52:06] because we know that our prayers will be
[1:52:08] answered is that right when he got
[1:52:10] around in there is that right they had
[1:52:12] an all night prayer meeting and when
[1:52:14] they had the all night prayer meeting
[1:52:16] they knew Peter is that right Peter was
[1:52:18] in the dungeon he was going to get his
[1:52:19] head chopped off in the morning but when
[1:52:22] they got to praying and all of a sudden
[1:52:24] is that right we moving to the what
[1:52:26] Supernatural we moving to the what
[1:52:28] Supernatural is that right he's getting
[1:52:31] us ready for the supernatural that's
[1:52:33] where we're moving into uh so when that
[1:52:35] angel come and PE you won't be afraid of
[1:52:38] it is that right but he has to train you
[1:52:40] for that is that right so when he got
[1:52:43] over there and you're training for that
[1:52:45] all of a sudden uh Peter the angel came
[1:52:48] up and said let's go Peter when he come
[1:52:50] around and then he came from the third
[1:52:52] dungeon is that right Peter still
[1:52:54] thought he was in the train is that
[1:52:56] right but look what that prayer does uh
[1:52:59] the most powerful weapon that we have is
[1:53:01] that right when he got around in there
[1:53:03] Peter he came down in there and when he
[1:53:05] walked in there knocked on the door boom
[1:53:07] boom boom boom boom and what is her name
[1:53:10] of oh I forget the young lady's name is
[1:53:12] that
[1:53:13] right ah PR I it come to me but I forgot
[1:53:17] the young lady's name that was there
[1:53:20] Roa God bless y thank you Roa when Roa
[1:53:24] came in maybe perhaps Roa didn't really
[1:53:26] believe uh maybe Roa didn't believe all
[1:53:29] night prayer worked uh maybe perhaps he
[1:53:31] wasn't sure is that right so she the one
[1:53:34] had to go answer the door God is rich in
[1:53:37] Mercy he do believe maybe she didn't
[1:53:39] believe but when she got there he
[1:53:41] knocked is that right is said it's Peter
[1:53:44] it's Peter is that right when it came in
[1:53:47] there Saint son so when Peter what got
[1:53:50] Peter set free is that right the other
[1:53:52] night prayer what's going to get your
[1:53:54] loved one free from drinking prayer not
[1:53:57] talking about him smoking prayer

[2:02:01] said it had to move out of the way
[2:02:04] because God was in the ark uh and he
[2:02:07] said when God was in the ark the
[2:02:09] Warriors had to part and when the
[2:02:11] Warriors had to part Joshua was putting
[2:02:14] God and himself the reputation God was
[2:02:18] going to
[2:02:19] Joshua's word to keep his
[2:02:22] reputation because God just told him I
[2:02:25] will magnify you so down God had to do
[2:02:29] what keep his
[2:02:33] reputation pray with me Saints we about
[2:02:35] to stop he said we coming through a hole
[2:02:38] he said look what he said help me Lord

[2:03:47] need Assurance because his reputation is
[2:03:50] at stake certainly it is he says and if
[2:03:53] and it did hold it would be a memorial
[2:03:57] he said that's the reason I know that
[2:04:00] the oldtime god heartfelt salvation will
[2:04:04] hold he said the reputation of Christ is
[2:04:08] at stake that's why the Lord says huh he
[2:04:12] got around there Pastor when the Holy
[2:04:14] Ghost dropped down in here he said what
[2:04:17] had he right what you want he said the
[2:04:19] inspiration the Holy Spirit caught that
[2:04:22] word warned that word spoke through her

[2:11:50] Hallelujah as they continue to play
[2:11:52] softly I'm just going to read Hebrew 3
[2:11:56] and we can go home the Bible says in
[2:11:59] verse three for this man was counted
[2:12:03] worthy of more Glory than
[2:12:06] Moses in as much as he who has built the
[2:12:10] house has more honor than the
[2:12:14] house for every man every house is built
[2:12:18] by some man but he that built all things
[2:12:23] is
[2:12:24] God everything the one who built it is
[2:12:27] God and Moses verily was faithful in all
[2:12:31] his house as a servant for a testimony
[2:12:35] of those things which were to be spoken
[2:12:38] after but Christ as a son over his own
[2:12:44] house whose house are we yes
[2:12:48] remember if he doesn't provide for his
[2:12:50] own house he's worse than an
[2:12:54] Ider so God take care of his own house
[2:12:58] he says but Christ has a son over his
[2:13:01] own house whose house are we If We Hold
[2:13:05] Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of
[2:13:09] the Hope firm unto the end because the

[2:13:40] know you more than yourself and he saw
[2:13:43] something precious that's why he sold
[2:13:46] everything just to get you

[2:13:50] price in the field amen do not
[2:13:54] underestimate yourself the blood of
