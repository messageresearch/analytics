pretty good very good so you know the seventh cell now is it complicated the message never never was complicated that's god that's why god took somebody in elementary to make sure you don't say oh no his english is too complicated go to the very basic one to make sure you can see the message amen blessed be the name of the lord if you miss that sermon you make sure you get it pretty good before we end up on sunday if jesus doesn't tell you because the territory we're getting in on sunday you need to have teeth [Laughter] amen you will remember me on sunday amen you prayed for me i was trying to move on to the same direction but the holy spirit opened up a two different thing about the sabbath that is really really really you pray for me amen is a lot to be gone a lot for me to sit down and to study but everything is coming back together when i was in the office there he dropped a scripture that line up everything again so by god's grace i know we're gonna get blessed together amen blessed be the name of the lord you remember brother said tough to say but he's traveling to ohio this weekend for a memorial about a family member so you just keep them in prayer for travel mercy he will go there but he will come back also remember brother michael daly i know he's here tonight but probably he will be traveling for his mother's funeral this saturday i believe it's 11 o'clock 11 o'clock in florida so just keep the family in prayer so everything goes well and also for travel mercy amen there is a couple churches that mail a convention a summer convention to us i just received the mail today so we posted that on the board if you need more information everything is on the board you can just stop by brother robert can let you know about it amen so tonight i am not preaching praise god i have brother sam mal preaching for us so it's been a long time since he took a break amen so amen so now he should be so much loaded and ready to unload the man tonight amen so let's sing only believe as he's coming home [Music] believe [Music] ah [Music] all alone [Music] i believe [Music] amen amen that's a statement of faith you know you're saying that you believe [Music] let's turn to psalms 46 just as a scripture read and get started amen [Music] if you got it say amen amen if i sound like brother stephen up here tonight don't blame me his voice has been ringing in my head [Music] well imitation is the best form of flattery what a teacher what a teacher god has blessed us with a wonderful gift and i think that we should live lives that are worthy of that gift let's read god is our refuge oh we could just close the book and go home and strength a very present help in trouble we receive not the spirit of fear but the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father which is equivalent to say daddy daddy it's a very familial uh form of the word father it's something that a child would use towards his daddy whereby we cry so we have a relationship with god we respect god we have that fear for him but to be afraid of him to be afraid of his wrath that's all under the law amen oh my a very present help therefore will we not fear will not we fear though the earth be removed sounds like a pretty good earthquake to me though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea and though the waters roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof sila look at this there is a river one river the streams many streams [Laughter] oh it gets better whereof shall make the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles one holy place many tabernacles here comes the bride can you see yourself as being one of those tabernacles well then you should be glad because we're sipping off of this of the river that makes us glad my my my god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her that right early the heathens raged and the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the host the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is a refuge selah come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth and we're supposed to be afraid of putin's atomic bomb this says the desolations that he hath made in the earth oh god's in control [Music] he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow [Music] and cutteth the spear sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire here's your instructions here's your instructions bride be still be still the pastor's gonna get us in to the holiest he's gonna get us into the place where we're resting completely resting devoid of any of our outer uh outer senses devoid of our conscience our reason our imagination our memory it's all gone we're living in a land of perfect faith that means he said it we believe it that settles it and it doesn't matter what the outcome is oh my i feel it rising i feel it rising if you wasn't there saturday you missed us something wow that's all i can say as well don't ask me to to recount it because i can't do it but i sat there for four and a half hours and i think the thing that stumbled brother stephen so much is i didn't say a thing the whole time four and a half hours i didn't say one thing brother stephen he got to the end he looked at me he said brother sam you didn't say anything he kind of stumbled me too but it was so good my my mind be still oh if those words could just anchor something be still and no no that means have faith no we're going to hear that word again a little bit that i am god i mercy i heard this boast somewhere else he said he was going to be exalted above the most high but this one said i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth [Music] the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge sila let's just pray and then you can be seated lord jesus we are humbled to be here father and lord we're not here because we have any great ability father but we're here lord jesus because you called us to this moment and lord i've done everything i can in the past two days to yield every emotion that i have into your hands lord every feeling every every everything that i am my whole entire being i've lived the last couple of days just trying to yield myself totally to you so that i would be an empty vessel when i stood behind this pulpit and lord that you'd be able to use my vocal cords tonight to feed your sheep and i'm asking you to do that now lord as i yield myself to you in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated i'm going to be taking a a text [Music] out of romans 8 and 28 serving his purpose we're going to be going a long way to get there but we're going to get there and when we get there i believe we got some good things in store you know satan tried to really uh upset that meeting on saturday many knows how many was at the meeting saturday okay okay good good representation how many knows that uh a storm came the night before and blew over the tent that had already been set up see satan did not want that meeting to happen and how many knows that he didn't prevail [Music] thus fulfilling the words of our lord the gates of hell cannot prevail oh my god there was such a harmony in that meeting it was one mind [Music] one heart one accord young old i being amongst the latter i'm getting pretty close to 20 though brother abel amen i just got a little further to travel than some of you but the questions that was asked two questions but then the questions to the questions to the questions to the questions two and a half hours of four and a half hours i'm sorry four and a half hours this is not including the meal this is just the time that we were in the questions and answers four and a half hours and everybody was so in tune and you could see as the wisdom and the knowledge was being ushered out by our lord jesus christ not only through our pastor but for the everybody in the in the audience our brother polycarp i wish i could understand french when i was in germany brother uh stephen there was a brother came then we were up at ewald frank's church and i spoke very little german and he spoke very little english so between his broken english and my broken german we were communicating and i'll never forget he looked at me he was just a little bit frustrated because he couldn't communicate the way he wanted to communicate and he said in him there will be van speak [Laughter] friends this harmony is that one speak all hearts in one heart one mind one accord you talk about heavenly places you know the word have the the term heavenly places paul only used it in the book of ephesians and he was speaking to the elect speaking to the elect talking about being in heavenly places in christ jesus you won't find it in the new testament anywhere else only to the ephesians and we know that the book of ephesians parallels the book of joshua which is the time that they were taking possession of the promise that god had made them i hope you're reading between the lines friends we must realize that we are living in the time when we are taking possession of what god has made promised not only to us but they without us cannot be made perfect and i want to say one more thing and i want everybody paying attention to me because this is important and you have to know your place in the body and you have to know your importance in the body because if you're a part of that elect we without you cannot be made perfect i don't care how old you are just a little bitty child is the one that that told naaman about a prophet that was over in the land of israel that could cleanse him of his leprosy every person every uh every beating heart in this assembly is important to the economy of god and do not think negative of one soul in here if you see somebody that's getting a little bit out of line don't criticize them just do what the prophet did get in line get in line get in line the hour is late friends we don't know when that call is coming forth friends i i i wondered about that meeting when i got home brother stephen it was so rich and it was so much if i could ever imagine what it was like in the upper room before the coming down of the the the the cloven tongues of fire they were i don't think that they was cumbered because they'd been there ten days they'd been in prayer for 10 days we're thinking four and a half hours is pretty good can you imagine 120 people gathered in one room for ten days they had to pass from time to eternity could it be friends could it be that we are actually getting into that place to where time is blending into eternity we're building a platform i believe the lord has something that he'd like to share with us tonight and if i can get it out the way it came to me it will be a blessing now we all know that brother branham when he went um when he was a young boy he was shot right remember that he was shot this is in the message souls that are in prison now i think i'm gonna just start skipping a couple pages because this is gonna take some time so we're gonna just fast forward and so he was shot and whilst he was was a bleeding he went into a a vision a trend i don't think he knew exactly what but he visited the the uh the the regions of the lost and in the regions of the lost see if i can find it here and just read it to you he said the vision struck me and i was so weak i had lost that blood and went and i was sinking into an endless eternity many of you may have heard me tell this before and sinking into an endless eternity first i was going down through like clouds and then through darkness and sinking on down down down and the first thing you know i got to the regions of the lost and in there i screamed the first thing you know i got into the regions of the lost i screamed and i looked and there just everything there was no foundation i could never stop falling for eternity looked like i was going to fall there was no stopping nowhere he said then what a difference that was from the vision i had here not long ago being in glory with the with the people the contrast remember when he went beyond the curtain of time so brother branham visited both places the regions of the rot lost and the regions of the blessed but let's continue here he said of course just being a kid i would scream i screamed for my daddy and i was just falling i finally that's all i could do was scream i screamed for my daddy and my daddy wasn't there and i screamed for my mother somebody somebody catch me there was no mother there i was just going i screamed then to god and there was no god there there was nothing and after a while i heard the most mournful sound that i ever heard think about this think about this this is this we're going to find out this is becoming material on earth now right now the hideous sights that i'm seeing right now and brother branham thought hell did that to him look at this there was nothing there no god there and after a while i heard the most mournful sound that i ever heard it was the awfulest feeling there's no way listen to what he says even a literal burning fire would be a pleasure to decide of what this was now those visions has never been wrong just one of the most horrible feelings i ever had and what did and you know i think sometimes in order to comprehend what god is giving us here we have to almost realize what that other side is like because you know brother branham came along and he preached that message the token which was the literal life of jesus christ come back upon the believers we're going to get to that in a minute but do you know what he preached that night what did he preach brother robert desperation exactly right and sometimes i just wonder you've got to realize saints we're living in laodicea we're living in a lukewarm age and you can't live in a lukewarm age if you're being controlled by your seed steel smelling here at all your conscience your reason your memory your imagination your affection if that's got any control on you at all it's going to weaken your faith i want you to see the desperation here let me drop this as we go let me drop this as we go how many were at the resurrection of jesus christ anybody know the bible says above 500. how many were in the upper room what happened to the rest of them do you see the sincerity and what did brother branham tell us he said you have to be more sincere we just have to be more sincere and i believe that's what it's going to take church for us to come to this level that jesus christ is trying to bring us to to get us in behind that curtain to get us into that inner veil to where that were in his presence how many knows that you're justified by faith luke 17 i mean um was ex once that romans romans 1 17 the just shall live by faith is that right how many knows you're sanctified by faith right anybody need a scripture for that i got it written down here we're justified by faith we're sanctified by faith turn to acts 26 18 acts 26 18 these are the words of jesus christ himself as he's talking to paul this just goes to show you the importance of faith and faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word yes okay here we go let's start with 15. and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom now persecute us but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and those things which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they might receive forgiveness of sin and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith so in the outer court we're justified by faith in the holy place we're sanctified by faith and the outer courts where we see taste feel smelling here we're still affected by the outside the the the we can feel the sun the rain inner court brother brown said those those uh you're in your spirit realm it's your conscience your reasoning your imaginations your memories and your affections but we're still justified by faith we're still sanctified by faith but when we get in behind that veil we live by faith every one of the other ten senses is con is controlled by faith alone that's that sixth sense and that's what he's bringing us to he's bringing us to a place to where he what he says we believe it and we're not looking for any other outcome except for the outcome that he intended for us that's his purpose now brother stephen i'm gonna have to get that uh powerpoint down because keeping these paper swords is not easy wow okay okay here we go now and after a while i heard okay we read that oh this is what i want to get to and i heard a noise something like a haunted affair and when i looked coming it was women and they had green stuff just see it in their face they had green stuff under their eyes and their eyes look like run back i see this in cracker barrel all the time they got cat's eyes it's good to see the hamiltons again this one this one this one um well she she used to work with us derek elainey you know who i'm talking about she looks like a clown it hurts me she had a little star stuck on her forehead right here if this disturbed the prophet what would he do if he saw what we're looking at green stuff and their eyes look run back like the women uh today paint their eyes run back like that and their eyes and their face and they're going oh [Music] oh my i just screamed oh god have mercy on me have mercy o god where are you if you only let me go back and live i promise you to be a good boy that's the only thing i say god knows and on the day of judgment he'll judge me for that statement that's what i said lord god let me go back i promise to be a good boy and when i got shot i had told lies i've done pretty much everything to be done and i might as well get it cleaned out right now while i'm here now he said and when i looked and seen i was half blowed into almost i said god have mercy on me you know i've never committed adultery and that's the only thing that i could say to god and i never accepted his pardon but all i could say is i never did commit adultery and then they'd taken me out and there they were going on let's see uh skip a little bit and so help me the weary creatures all around and i had been a new revival i had been a new arrival and the most hideous horrible ungodly feeling looked like great big eyes big eyelashes out like that and run back like a cat my i'm glad it's hitting you the way it hit me and green stuff and canker and he's i'm just saying what he said and i can hear it on the tape you you can't say it the way he said it what a feeling then in a moment's time i'd come back to natural life and the thing has bothered me ever since and then seven months later he said he had a vision of being out west the cross exactly and the glory of god just pouring into him and he said i knew that there was a regions of the dam somewhere now i never noticed so much until about four weeks ago he said wife never thought of it on these terms about four weeks ago wife and i went down to tucson to do some shopping amen jc penney's and a young woman come by and said what do you think of that he said and so let me go on down here just a little bit save some time so i went upstairs and i sat down and when i did there was an escalator and it was a jc penny store and the escalator was bringing people up well i was turning my my sick at my stomach see those women there young old indifferent wrinkled young every way little bitty short son this is 1963. what would he say if he saw it now skipping a little and one coming right off the elevator just to the right like that i was sitting in back in my chair sitting with my head down and i turned and i looked and one of them coming up the steps saying ooh spanish speaking to another woman she was a white woman speaking spanish to the spanish woman and when i looked brother branham snapped his fingers all at once i was changed there and i had seen that before her eyes you know how the women are doing now painting their eyes just recently like cat you know put that green stuff under their eyes there was this was that thing that i seen when i was a child there was the woman just exactly i just got numb all over now he preached that in the morning of um when he preached souls that are in prison now that was on november the 10th now that evening he preached another message and the message that he preached that evening was he that is in you and in the message he that's in you he recounts another time when he was uh out on colorado and that storm came up and the lord told him to speak to the storm and when he spoke to the storm and the storm went away then he was walking across the mountains and he had a burden in his heart and he was praying that god would lift that burden from him and he said and it goes on and on but just he come to a point to where he said all of a sudden he said everything changed and i was in every bit i was just like i was when i was a young man again so just think in the morning he was remembering the regions of the lost and that same night he's preaching he that is in you and he's recounting a time to where that he was actually taken to the point of being in a rapture where he turned young again we want to get to a place friends to where we're so sincere with god we're so sincere with our walk and we have to know that both of those uh places are there but we certainly don't want to go to that let's turn to romans 8 and verse 28. this is a very familiar reading it's one that i've had on every bible that i've ever owned it says and we know that all of things work together for the good to them that love god and to them who are the called according to his purpose his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also justified and whom he justified he also glorified what shall we say to these things then if god before us who can be against us now paul says here for we know and we know and we know and we know and we know i'm not repeating it because i don't know what it says those are three of the most important words in that entire verse we know our faith is anchored we have a revelation that everything that happens to us has not happened to us unless god knew it was going to happen to us and we love god amen how do we know we love god there you go there's one there's one we don't love the things of the world he said if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you what is your soul feeding on what are you spending your time doing what's your idol time the time that you don't have to do do anything for anybody else but just you and you're alone all by yourself and you can turn on a movie or you can turn on a tape you can turn on brother shambo or you can turn on gun smoke i like the smoke that he delivers i'm being serious friends let me tell you something we're all going to come to that point one day we have got to give an answer for what we have done in this flesh what have we done with the time that god has given us did you ever think of the word present it's got two meanings it's a gift it's also a period of time and it doesn't last very long that's why the bible says redeeming the time redeeming the time because the days are evil and we know all things work together for the good to them who love god and to them who are the called according to his purpose now in order to get the full impact of this you have to realize that something took place in romans chapter seven if you did not have something take place in romans chapter 7 in romans chapter 8 doesn't even apply to you that first nature must die and the invisible union brother branham said you don't just hang him up to the occasion you don't put him in the closet until you're until you you just want to have a little time give your flesh a little you want to kill your flesh everything about your flesh that nature that you was born with that's got to die or you're unlawfully married to christ do you realize that you'll be one of the ones that come up on that day and your your house will be all cleaned and garnished and swept but you never allowed him to come in and possess you this is the time of possession we are possessing the promises that god left for us but now let's just say that we've all been through romans 7 and we've all died to our first husband we've been through that then we could wake up in romans chapter eight there is therefore now no condemnation that word condemnation means there's no judgment to those which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh now ask yourself you may as well face it now because if you don't face it now you're going to face it then judgment begins in the house of god and if you judge yourself you won't be judged i find a lot of people don't mind being judges they love to be a judge but they're judging everybody but themselves i told them to let me use use me tonight so so if if if something comes out blame it on boaz boaz made me do it friends we need this we need this we don't realize the time that we're living in do you realize that the hell is being poured out on earth do you realize that the ecclesiastical system is all set up for for for the tribulation period do you believe that the do you know that the political system is all set up for the tribulation period oh he's going to have his day in the hay we won't be here to see it thank you jesus brother brown says before one bomb drops the bride will be in glory before one drop of rain fell nose in the yard now i told you about the title must of my message tonight the one that the lord gave me i believe was serving his purpose and it says we know that all things were together for the good to them that love god and to them who are the called according to his purpose now before you can serve his purpose you have to know his purpose and i want to just give you a little clue before we get too far into this finding your purpose is a personal relationship to jesus christ your pastor can't show you your purpose your mommy can't show you your purpose your daddy can't show you your purpose jesus christ himself did not show peter that he was the christ the bible said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you peter but my father which is in heaven and if you want to know what your purpose is get a prayer life learn how to get if you have to do it as our brother's been teaching us legalistically know that it's just the right thing to do to get on your knees and pray before your god and if you have to just sit there with a blank mind sit there with a blank mind just keep telling him how much you love him how much you appreciate him because he inhabits the praises of his saints but i'll tell you what he doesn't inhabit and if he needs scripture i got it he doesn't inhabit murmuring he doesn't inhabit complaining he doesn't inhabit negativity he doesn't inhabit gossip well we may as well just hit it real good brother stephen you know when they come along and say we gotta pray for that sister you know that come on let's grow up let's grow up you don't have to give all the details there's a sister i know that's struggling let's pray for just that simple amen amen now we've got to find our purpose but in order to find your purpose brother stephen you got to know where your purpose is at how do we find our purpose i want to tell you something you will not find your purpose that god intended for you if you do not have a prayer life brother sam are you serious well it was jesus that said father i thank you because you hid these things hid these things from the wise and prudent but he said that he revealed it and brother branham said unto babes such as would learn so when you humble yourself and you come to god as a little child and look i just want to share this with you because i feel bad for the rich young ruler i really do look at him he got one of them attitude looks isn't he who right do you realize that he was looking he was looking heaven in the face and jesus turned and looked at him he said go sell all you have give it to the poor and you'll have riches in heaven we're talking about eternal life i often wonder brother stephen and i put myself in this man's shoes i mean he was rich but moses was rich too [Music] we can walk away from riches we can walk away from anything that will separate us from the love of god [Applause] brother stephen i wish i was there that day because when i saw him walking away you know what i'd have done i had to run after him and i had grabbed him i said brother brother brother you you don't know what you're doing you're making a bad mistake here he said well i've got great riches i can't do that do you know what i would have said to him brother seth i would have said when he told you to give his way your riches and give it to the poor and you looked at him and said it was too hard for you to do did you ever stop and think about asking him to help you [Music] my bible said if i ask if i seek amen it's easy church to preach to you brother stephen it's an easy church it's an easy church now look i ask i receive i seek i find watch this stay with me a second i knock he opens that's the revelation brother if we will do the asking brother if you will do the seeking you will do the receiving you'll do the finding and when you knock you'll open it and he'll come in and sup with you and you'll sup with him amen i wish i'd have been there on that day because we know the end of his story and we don't want that determine in your heart whatever it takes and remember what we're looking for we are looking for the literal life of jesus christ come back upon the believer amen the literal life brother branham said if i had the spirit of beethoven in me and if i had the spirit of of dillinger in me see but we've got the spirit of christ i wish there was ways that you could just you you're pouring yourself out in romans chapter seven dying out to that nature romans chapter eight look at romans chapter eight there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life of christ has made me free from the law of sin and death for the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us in us now look verse 11 if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit of him that dwelleth where in you so now we know that if we're serving his purpose yes i better bring my paper with me we have to know where to look the word for purpose is watch this i want to put this over here after i've done this a few times i'll be better at it prosthesis that's the greek word for purpose for purpose okay now watch this a purpose the definition of a purpose means the reason for which something is then created or for which something exists and every one of us have a purpose some of us have more than one purpose some of us are dennis and some of us are pastors and some of us are husbands so many purposes but every one of us have a purpose and we're called according to his purpose now the word prosthesis means purpose that's what it means but watch this here we take this word and we put that with prosthesis and so we got artes prosthesis pretty good huh anybody awake yet all right you ready for this now when you take these two greek words and you put them together you get look it up in the strong's concordance now we're serving his purpose where's the showbread at [Applause] amen now this is the only word that appears in romans 8 28. but when you look up the word showbread both these words appear so what i want everybody in here to understand what god was showing me i don't care how old you are pay attention the purpose for your life is hidden in the showbread you won't find that in romans 8 28 it's hidden so now if we take the teaching that brother stephen's been teaching see how close i can come got the labor got the labor what we got we got the candlesticks we got the table i better get this right it's like taking a test [Laughter] bruh and we got the altar of incense am i missing anything the show bro that's right here that's right here show bread sure but i ain't got room enough i don't have room enough for the wine yet but it's the tables there okay there we go right there so now here we are we're justified and we're baptized sanctified and now we're coming to the holy place and what does he teach us that the light of the uh of the angel for your age is shining the light onto the show bread that pertains to you personally [Music] but you have to know that you're one of his there's two tests do you love the world and the things of the world then you don't love him let's get her like let's make black black and white white you out there tinkering with the things of the world don't come around and tell me you love my jesus [Music] but when jesus is the only thing you love him you love him with all your heart with all your mind with all your strength with all your soul [Music] then you can say you love him but it's to them that love him see this is condition though i hear people tell me all the time everything's working together for the good do you love him [Music] do you know what your purpose is do you know why he created you are you fulfilling your purpose are you just going on whining and complaining about everything that's gone wrong in your life if you believed him nothing's gone wrong in your life [Music] [Applause] [Music] teresa was driving she looked ahead and she said oh they're stopping they're stopping you know we get nervous down there when traffic starts to stop because you're crowded you can't go nowhere and i looked over i said honey if i'm supposed to be a church tonight they ain't enough demons in hell because i knew there was a purpose i hadn't been fellowshipping with him for the last two days for safe to set some sort of a traffic jam up and keep me from getting here and i want to tell you this every heartache every trial god has been preparing you because he's got a purpose for you and the reason that you're all discontented and the reason that you're not justified and you don't have peace it's because you don't know your purpose and you're not living in the purpose that god called you for let's talk about faith for a minute he says now this is a message called have faith in god oh plenty of time plenty of time nobody getting tired yet are you the best is yet to come in the message have faith in god he says now some thinks that it's a mental conception of the word but that's not right he said faith is a substance faith is not a mist a myth faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen to have an evidence it must be a substance so it is just so it is not just something that you imagine in your mind it's something that absolutely you have can i just drop this if you don't have a spirit of forgiveness don't tell me you get faith because my bible tells me that when you stand praying forgive [Music] people try to tell me they've got faith and they're still holding grudges friends this is real when peter and john went through the gate called beautiful they said silver and gold have i none but such is i they didn't say such as the pastor has they didn't say such as the deacon has they didn't say such as the elders have they said such as i have [Music] give i unto you it's a substance it's another it's it's he says it's the evidence of things you do not have yet but you have the authority of god to say that you have it it's an evidence something you have in your heart so when abraham called things that were not as though they were he wasn't lying he had a substance and according to his substance he had it and he believed it here we go perfect faith message paragraph 112. what did i do i don't want this thing to dry out i might need it again we having fun yet this has been the last two days with me i've been bubbling i kept it from teresa i didn't tell her what i was going to do and the last two nights you know what we did we watched you and we did i said bye i said that's going to help my sermon just watching him i do want to say this with a very sincere heart if you don't go back and re-listen to them tapes you're missing it i guarantee you you cannot get everything that's said across this pulpit on a sunday in one listening to and it's been a real blessing to me to go back and listen i encourage you saying look we're talking about eternity you you heard what i would do to this rich young ruler if i'd have been there i'd have grabbed him by the collar why didn't you just ask him he'da helped you he could have showed you the the value of what he had to offer and the value of what he was trying to hold on to and by the time he got done sharing with you the value of what he had you wouldn't want nothing to do with your riches you'd have been begging people to go to the bank who would draw it for you ah don't you see what satan's doing he's robbing us of our opportunity he's robbing us of our present time he's robbing us of our ability to spend time in his presence and see what purpose he has and let me tell you some friends he might have a purpose for you today but you might need to know what your purpose is tomorrow we can't just get a purpose and then lay down and say we got our purpose i don't know what god wants for me next week if somebody would told me i was gonna be in this pulpit last friday i said i don't think so we don't know but when i got the call i had to do some praying jesus lived in a world that no one knew anything about let's do this quickly now he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and a perfect god thank you brother kelly i love brother kelly if i could have just half the energy that man's got he lived in a world of perfect faith and a perfect god in which he was that went over pretty good didn't it all right stay alert if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirits what does the galatians say about walking in the spirit it says if you walk in the spirit you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh bingo number one if you're having trouble with the lust of the flesh you're not walking in the spirit number two if you don't want to walk in the flesh of the flesh get in the spirit i like that thing if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world that people wouldn't understand you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do look at philip he's down there in a revival thousands of people the spirit says go out there one person gone didn't make any sense anybody around him what the spirit said you would do and what it forbid you would not do then the people begin to say they they say you'd be a mystic to them now listen how many let me see your show hands how many is a believer well i got some young hands up there anybody else want to put their hands up once we got a hands up keep them up there for a minute i won't see if i get any other hands to go up okay well we got the majority believers here so this pertains to you what i'm about to read he said that's the way it is to all believers they are mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to him they said this and then they say why you you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith for we know for we know we don't have one speck of doubt when we say for we know that means we believe we can sing the song only believe because we're believers and if i quote tim pruitt he says we believe because we're believers and that's what believers do i thought it was pretty profound now listen to this friends he said and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world is he is he here is here isolated behind the veil you and christ alone that's what we're going to ready i'm following brother anything that i don't have lined up i want it lined up and if you don't if you try to spare me on anything brother i'm gonna hold it to you don't you spare one ounce of me you you flay my heart inside and out i don't wanna have to walk away like this man that's real to me i've spent a lot of time pondering that guy where's his treasures at now who would you rather be moses or this man and moses walked away from everything he had he accounted the afflictions of the children of his greater treasures than all of egypt he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ now there now you're getting into bride material how many believes enoch was bribed material let me let me drop something on enoch here hebrews chapter 11 if you want to go there with me enoch my buddy how many knows what enoch means i know what it means if i could just think of it dedicated dedicated i'm working with a 67 year old mind but i'm getting a new one look at this enoch verse 5 11 verse 5 by faith enoch dedicated let's call him dedicated dedicated was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him and before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please god for he that comes to god must believe that he is that's pretty simple this gospel is simple isn't it brother this gospel simple we must believe that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that make it to church every once in a while diligent friends if you don't have a spirit of diligence to your savior i want to advise you the way i would revise that rich young ruler ask him ask him for diligence my bible tells me i have not because i ask not amen it said ask so that your joy might be full now you're getting in the brad material c c c i think there's three c's there for a reason you're getting into rapturing condition now so when you're dedicated to the word of god you're going to be the one that's taking an enoch trip you get up one morning and you'll start walking and you'll start walking and your feet will get lighter and your feet will get lighter and you'll be looking down at your rooftop and you'll just keep on walking brother branham said the moon he said i want to go so far past the moon past the milky way he said i want to keep i want to go into his presence this is real friends this is real and god is delivering it to us in this building consider what this man brings us but then consider all the other ministers that have come in between and how god has so anointed them it's like putting in the mortar between the bricks that this man is laid and it's all being bound together and it's building a beautiful house and you are that house [Applause] i remember remembers when he was talking about going to dental school and he opened up to chapter 23 and he started now this is how you pull the tooth so i did it and then i did it and then i did it he said after a while i didn't need the book you remember what he said he said he became the book and as you eat the book i hope somebody will forgive me if i'm if i'm rubbing too hard but but i really think it's too late to be playing games but when you're watching things that are not i'm trying to be nice how do you say it being how can you be nice how can you be nice i want to be nice brother branham said be firm frank loving and kind but do you realize whatever you're partaking of that's what you're becoming if your kids come home with a with some kind of an off attitude and you don't know what that attitude is find out what they've been looking at we're raising a cookie cutter generation cracker barrels got it down to a science he knows those spoiled kids are going to get what they want so they got all the toys right down here brother kelly i gotta be honest i admire a parent that knows how to say no i really do i'm so tired of them wishy washy panda yeah look at sonny look at tommy [Music] if you'll eat all your food i'll buy you a toy i want it yeah no you haven't been on your own you think i'm kidding do you think i'm exaggerating and whenever i see that brother seth you know what i do i look to her working with me i said i'm my money's on the kid i haven't lost any money all right so we're now we're down to rapturing condition everybody ready for rapturing condition how many wants to go in the rapture oh my goodness look at that i got everybody's hand though that's lovely oh my goodness well let's look here help us up brother branham i hear this man's voice going through my head and i'm laying on the bed at night here i mean when you when you eat the book you become the book [Music] brother stephen god bless your heart i want you to know from the bottom of my heart i appreciate it i really do i appreciate it [Applause] i can say i'm a witness if you'll apply what's being taught it'll produce what he says it'll produce but don't play with it don't go up there and dip your toe in the water and see if it's cold no just jump on him you need that stimulation anyways it ain't gonna kill you you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one for each one of us not just the pastors the deacons the trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god one river many streams one holy place many tabernacles it's you and god alone in the holy place and that my friend is where you'll find your purpose you eat you breathe and then you become a support for your brothers you look around you see a sister struggling you on your knees and you're praying for that who is jesus coming to set a mark on for the abominations done where we're here to help each other friends oh how we could go through uh ephesians 4 don't have time i love ephesians 5 brother i love it you preached that up in uh in the um hotel and i remember getting up he asked me to come up and pray you know what i said brother john i said you can't tell me you can't teach an old dog new tricks that's when he made this statement and i'll never forget it he said it's almost like we have to retrain men in this message how to treat their wives ask theresa if there's been a difference go ahead you can tell on me i'm not ashamed of this gospel [Applause] and if it's working for me it'll work for you but you better apply it while there's time to apply it [Applause] don't go baby foot around with this gospel either get in get out or get out of the way i haven't got to the good stuff yet help me jesus that means for each one of us walk in a world with god alone you're baptized into the kingdom there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out give us this day our daily our daily purpose [Music] people said i spoke in tongues and they got the holy ghost i'm gonna be okay uh oh i wouldn't want to rest on that why do you want to get in the presence of the holy ghost and then get out of the presence of the holy don't make no ghost all right i'm still trying to get to what i'm trying to get to the lord said this oh he gives the orders you pack about whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord said this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on the same you're now you're coming into perfect faith perfect faith that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others let me do this real quick and then we're going to be done and now this is out of crisis the mystery god revealed he said and now christ is in the church now the christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband notice god is the husband of the church and the church is his pride now peter when he called this said thou art the christ the son of the living god now watch blessed are thou simon bar jonas means son of jonah blessed art thou for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you you've never learned it from school my father which is in heaven revealed it unto you and if you want to know what your purpose is there's only one person can reveal it to you and that's your father that's in heaven not your mommy not your daddy not your pastor not your deacon not your husband not your wife i believe every wife needs a prayer life i believe every husband needs a prayer life is the wife supposed to be subject to her husband yes but if she's in the will of god and he's in the will of god they'll be such a harmony you won't know which one is which because it wasn't so brother stephen from the beginning that was put on there because of the curse the man was made to rule over the woman but before so if we're all in harmony with the holy spirit that won't even be like i'd be like the other day i was riding down the road and i'm doing 50 miles an hour and theresa says oh sam the policeman i said yeah i said i'm doing 55. that policeman don't mean nothing to me and when we get in the spirit these things that used to rub us won't rub us no more we will know that they were put there for a purpose and it was put there for our good and sometimes we had to follow it legally because it said so i'm going to help mommies out now i'm gonna help mommy's out okay you children when mommy says because i said so she's not being mean she don't have time to explain herself to you so just do it because she said so that's all do it i don't know if you all picked up on that but when he said legalistically just do it that's all if you don't understand it just do it do you believe god knows what he's doing i can't make a good sam i don't want to try to be a good god i gotta yield everything i am to god that was free of charge mom i hope somebody got it it might help one mommy out anyways my father which in heaven has revealed a notice upon this rock and we know that rock is the revelation of who he is and the gates of hell will not now look i'm going to skip down to paragraph 233 look christ in you everybody say christ in me makes him the center of life of the revelation see can i repeat that brother brown says brother brahm says can i repeat it brother brown's going to repeat it see he heard that that that didn't quite hit right so he's gonna repeat it look what he says christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation [Music] christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ we ain't got the good one yet i'm gonna let that salivate a few minutes look what he says here christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing put your seat belts back on i don't want anybody going through the roof are you with me so far so now we know that you are the revelation of the whole thing next time you're in the mirror just look into that mirror and say i am the revelation of the whole thing [Music] now what does this word mean purpose and when we put our toes on it it means show bread so god's purpose for us is hidden in the show bread and when the angel of our age shines the light on the show bread and you do what he says you're gonna find the purpose for your life not your entire life but everyday life can i get a couple more minutes [Music] i'm having too much fun to quit now in the adoption series brother branham said this he said on that walk he said that's where the church is failing is on that walk that everyday rugged living walking talking with christ when i go into work if my manager's there i go straight to the manager what would you want me to do today how many of you get up in the morning get on your knees and talk to jesus and say what would you have me do today it's that every day walking and talking with christ is where we're going to find our success friends he said christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do do you see what god is trying to do do you see what god's purpose is he wants to make you the revelation of the whole thing are you the called according to his purpose there's two qualifications you love god and you're called do you know that do we know that do we know that what is the new birth then you say brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you not you joined the church you shook a hand you done something different you set a creed you promised to live by a code of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you amen oh don't let the lateness of the hour get you let that soak home he is the word that is revealed to you no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it may be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church is built on let's stand a minute i know a lot of stuff's been said and and it might have cut a little bit somebody and if i it i honest i don't want to hurt nobody but but i think about this rich young ruler i think about he was there in the presence of eternal life and instead of looking at what he was able to do and if he would have just turned around and said you know i can't do this but here's somebody that can help me and so with your heads bowed with your heads bowed every one of you know what battle you're struggling with and i want to tell you by the authority of the bible by the authority of god's word he said if you ask you shall receive and it's such a simple thing if he would have just turned and looked at jesus and said jesus that's a hard thing for me can you help me i believe with all my heart it would be a different story we're missing the value of what we have i asked jesus to come right now where you're at and reveal to you the value of what you have what you have in your hand this word this precious word that gets poured out every sunday that gets poured out every wednesday i don't know if i've ever heard a bad service in this church i've never had a service where somebody was just trying to spend time [Music] to pull in they're making the vision plain upon the tables so that we can see and we can run thereby oh now you hold whatever it is that you're struggling with in your heart [Music] and if you don't have any struggles think of somebody that is struggling and let's ask him to help us [Music] you pray your own little way [Music] i have my struggles i've got children when brother brown preached souls that are in prison now he said oh i i pray that this isn't it i still got children [Music] i got children i got children and they're wondering like sheep without a shepherd and i don't know what to do for him so i'm turning to you great shepherd please help my children christina jonathan susan sharon billy melissa hear a daddy's prayer keep the blood over jesus [Music] please keep the blood over him lord send the holy ghost out after him that prophet said no matter how wayward your children are [Music] said you have the same faith [Music] for your children that you have for your own salvation whatever burden you have saints he's here to take it from you he said cast all your cares on me that's your anxieties your fears your complexes things you can't handle he said cast all your cares on me because i care for you [Music] to keep that which i've committed [Music] unto him [Music] [Music] and i'm persuaded that he if anybody has need of a prayer and you want to come up for prayer while the anointing is here feel free to come up which i've committed unto him against [Music] i am [Music] hallelujah amen hallelujah i mean enjoy the service tonight [Music] there is several points that brother sam preach on it that confirmed me exactly the sermon on sunday even the scripture and the thing he's saying is zeroed in exactly on it even one quote that we read amen it's a very difficult message for me to separate without getting into marriage and it's in the sabbath but i can't it's hard for me to stay on the sabbath without getting in the marriage and i keep seeing how the holy spirit is pulling the marriage part and pulling ephesians 5 which i was reading today at work i was meditating on ephesians 5. so you pray for me for the weekend and you take some good sleep to make sure you don't sleep in church amen i don't know what people say to be hard or to be cut so hard i don't think so when we avoid doing exactly what we are supposed to do that's when people get in trouble amen i was taught in school that when you're dealing with a child you need to tell them be careful be nice just try to cover the needle amen so when you see a child coming up on the chair the first question am i going to get a shot and you need to tell them well we're going to put your teeth to sleep and things like that and i keep watching that the kids keep getting nervous and it doesn't work so when i got in a child look at me say am i get a shot i say yes the mother was expecting me to say no i say yes the mother turned around he said at least you honest [Laughter] do you see what i'm saying then i turn around and

took it i even tried to hold off on the treatment and say you already know you wait for next time you say no i want to finish everything today why because you're telling the truth amen when you tell the truth the more sin is increasing in this world the more they don't want you to speak against sin and they call that to be rude so preacher has been called rude because they're preaching against homosexuality you rude you're not supposed to say things like that it is not being rude it is speaking the word of god and the word of god is truth amen so when you need to speak you speak straight what is in your mind you don't have a lot of trouble to think which word should i use on the pulpit that's too much i'm reading the bible i'm reading brother branham how can i take that word and quote it again the one who called it the word was the devil that's what brother branham say so when you speak speak your mind straight and brother branham say when you are you the people will learn how to live with you kill you so i don't have to struggle a lot i speak my mind and i go to sleep you're going to be speaking your mind and then you go back you say did he really get what i was saying you're the one struggling i didn't because mine was clear yours is difficult because they have to figure it out what was he trying was he really upset or not i don't understand maybe or maybe that was just maybe maybe because you don't you go in too many corners amen so brother sam that was pure and that was clear and that's the way it's supposed to come out [Applause] amen blessed be the name of the lord do you know how many furniture are in the temple in the tabernacle and the seventh one is hidden in one what is here the present author one number two number three number four number five number six is the ark and on top of the ark is the mercy seat and who was sitting on the mercy city who number seven the sabbath sixth furniture the seventh one is the sabbath sixth day the seventh is the sabha sixth seal the seventh is the sabbath sixth measure of barley the other one is easy everybody care blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can never emphasize the need of a candlestick over to the showbread table you can never over emphasize that amen it is the messenger shining the light on the bread and when the bread is illuminating it becomes the light of the hour that is god's purpose for your time if you want to know what god is doing in this day you got to find the messenger of this day and see what he preached today that is the purpose of god for you if you follow that message you are under god's purpose for the time because that's what god wants to accomplish in that specific time is it complicated amen is it complicated no and remember the showbread missed half right because the other half was on the other side amen but remember remember pray for me and stay in prayer for the weekend so that the lord will help us amen it will help you up a lot to understand this message and to see the very purpose of this message some of them will you will spin twice to swallow it but i will post scripture and i will pull quote and i will post scripture and i will poke all until you're going to swallow it amen it's going to be hard for you to believe it to be true but it's true because the devil doesn't want you to believe like that amen and you will look at women again differently then you used to look at sisters differently amen because some teaching traumatized the sisters a lot amen uh go to ephesian five i'm just going
