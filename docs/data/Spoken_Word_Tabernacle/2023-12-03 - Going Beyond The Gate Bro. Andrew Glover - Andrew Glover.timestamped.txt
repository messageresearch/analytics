[35:27] Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[35:30] Believers says amen amen and amen
[35:34] Genesis chapter 19 we want to read in
[35:37] the first verse uh the Bible here says
[35:39] and there came two angels to Sodom at
[35:42] evening and lot sat in the gate of Sodom
[35:47] and lot seeing them rose up to meet them
[35:49] and he bowed his face toward the ground
[35:52] now I want you to notice here the
[35:54] position where lot is sitting he's
[35:56] sitting in the gate but if we go back to
[35:59] Genesis the 18th chapter yes just one
[36:02] chapter over in Genesis 18 in verse one
[36:06] the Bible here speaks of another man and
[36:08] his name is Abraham yes my brother and
[36:11] the Bible says the Lord appeared unto
[36:13] him in the plains of mamory notice this
[36:16] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[36:19] of the day that's right so it was a
[36:21] Divine appearance and lot was sitting at
[36:24] the gate but here's Abraham's sitting at
[36:27] the tent door now in the book of Hebrews
[36:30] chapter 13 the book of Hebrews the 13th
[36:33] chapter I've just been studying here a
[36:35] few days out of these scriptures and uh
[36:37] speaking along these lines and amen the
[36:40] Lord's just opened up some thought to me
[36:41] so we just share a few things with you
[36:43] tonight in Hebrews chapter
[36:46] 13 and beginning at verse number nine uh
[36:49] Paul here writing says be not carried
[36:52] about with diverse and strange doctrines
[36:55] for it is a good thing
[36:57] that the heart be established with Grace
[36:59] amen and not with Meats which have not
[37:02] profited them that have been occupied
[37:04] there in now I love these words we have
[37:07] an altar sir we're not looking for one
[37:09] and we haven't had one but we have an
[37:12] altar whereof they have no right to eat
[37:15] which serve the Tabernacle for those
[37:17] bodies of those beasts whose blood is
[37:19] brought into the sanctuary by the high
[37:22] priest for sin are burned without the
[37:24] camp now wherefore Jesus also so that he
[37:27] might sanctify the people with his own
[37:29] blood suffered without the gate that's
[37:32] right so Jesus was the the the Beast was
[37:35] taken without the camp but here Paul is
[37:37] bringing it from Old Testament to New
[37:39] Testament and says we'll Suffer Without
[37:41] the gate now watch verse 13 now let us
[37:44] go therefore unto him without the camp
[37:48] bearing his reproach now we could very
[37:51] well go back to Hebrews 6 and read where
[37:53] Paul said let us go on unto perfection
[37:56] we could read Hebrews 12 and let us run
[37:59] the race so it's not stopping or staying
[38:01] where we've been but it's moving forward
[38:04] for here we have no continuing City but
[38:07] we seek one to come amen we ask the Lord
[38:10] this evening to add the blessing to the
[38:12] reading of his word as you can have your
[38:13] seats here this afternoon I want you
[38:16] tonight for just a few moments Amen to
[38:18] speak to you here from these verses of
[38:20] scripture and if I will title this
[38:22] tonight I want to talk to you about this
[38:23] thought of going beyond the gate amen
[38:27] going beyond the gate now I'm drawing
[38:29] this thought from a quote in 1960
[38:31] brother BR preaches is there anything
[38:33] too hard for the Lord tssa Oklahoma he
[38:35] said did you notice when the Angels come
[38:38] to lot lot was sitting in the gate amen
[38:41] but Abraham was sitting in the door amen
[38:44] the gate comes into the yard but the
[38:46] door goes into the house amen so the
[38:49] gate takes you further than where the
[38:51] door will take you see I like to or
[38:53] rather the door rather will take you
[38:54] further than where the gate will take
[38:55] you he said the gate comes in the yard
[38:58] but the door goes in the house he said
[39:00] i' like to sit in the door Amen on the
[39:03] altar as close as I can get to him he
[39:06] said that's where my expectations is is
[39:08] on the altar amen waiting for his
[39:11] appearing so a prophet amen was
[39:14] identifying amen there were two men amen
[39:16] and the first one was Lot the second one
[39:19] was Abraham amen and each one had a
[39:21] journey but in their Journey one could
[39:23] only go so far but there was another one
[39:26] that could go further one than the other
[39:28] one right amen and then the prophet of
[39:30] God will come along and preach 1964
[39:32] going beyond the camp he said it seems
[39:35] today to be a day amen of when people
[39:38] are going to be on the camp in
[39:40] everything they're going be on so Amen
[39:42] in science they're going Beyond in
[39:44] education they're going Beyond in
[39:46] religion they're going Beyond amen now
[39:48] listen if the devil is taking his people
[39:50] Beyond amen then you best believe that
[39:53] God is taking his people Beyond amen any
[39:56] of the limitations that the devil could
[39:58] put up on the Church of the Living God
[40:00] now amen he says going Bey on the camp
[40:02] and when you look at the word the word
[40:04] camp in Webster he said it is a place
[40:07] amen with temporary accommodations can
[40:09] we say that together temporary amen it
[40:12] is a place with temporary accommodations
[40:15] amen of a Hut or a tent or other
[40:17] structure amen it is a temporary
[40:19] Dwelling Place amen so let me set to you
[40:22] like this we cannot make a temporary
[40:25] Dwelling Place a a permanent Dwelling
[40:27] Place amen amen it's temporary but it's
[40:30] not permanent can I can I say it to you
[40:32] like this in other words you've got to
[40:33] go there but you cannot stay there
[40:36] you've got to go there but you cannot
[40:39] stay there it's part of your journey
[40:41] amen but it's not your destination amen
[40:44] and and the and and I I love the way the
[40:46] prophet of God brings this out in
[40:47] Genesis 13 he will go back to Abraham
[40:50] and lot and he'll say we find out that
[40:52] there come a Strife amen between lot's
[40:54] hgan and so forth and he said I want to
[40:56] show you a little thing here amen
[40:58] Abraham was an heir to the world now
[41:00] here's Abraham and he is an heir to the
[41:03] world he said but lot amen was a type of
[41:06] the luk horn believer so Abraham is an
[41:08] heir to the world lot is a type of the
[41:11] luk horn believer he was a Believer he
[41:13] had left his homeland to sojourn with
[41:15] God Amen but always never fully
[41:18] surrendered he said that's what's the
[41:20] trouble in the Full Gospel Church
[41:22] tonight along with the rest of them is
[41:24] people who's left the world and they
[41:26] keep out of the world they don't want to
[41:28] go gambling and drinking and carrying on
[41:30] Amen they are a Believer but they have
[41:32] never made a complete surrender amen now
[41:35] you can read that and you can identify
[41:37] that as the second work of Grace amen or
[41:40] the second stage of restoration amen the
[41:43] first one was justification amen and the
[41:46] second one was sanctification listen
[41:48] amen it's a good place to go is
[41:50] sanctification we've everyone got to go
[41:52] there amen but you cannot stay there
[41:55] amen because there's more more to the
[41:56] journey than just justification amen or
[41:59] sanctification but there's a baptism of
[42:02] the Holy Ghost but let me go ahead and
[42:03] say it amen you can't even stay there
[42:06] amen there's more to the believer
[42:08] there's a there there is the word itself
[42:11] amen amen come on lot was a type of the
[42:13] lukor believer amen but Abraham wasn't
[42:16] because he was Heir Amen to lot was Lot
[42:19] was heir to a lukewarm condition amen
[42:22] but Abraham was there to everything amen
[42:24] that God had given him in the Covenant
[42:26] well let me just say it to you tonight
[42:28] Church there's a bride on the earth
[42:30] tonight amen denomination has gone as
[42:32] far as they can go they have settled
[42:35] down with tradition they have settled
[42:37] down with dogmas they have settled down
[42:39] with just having church services amen
[42:41] but there's a bride on the earth tonight
[42:43] who is a Seed of Abraham and she's not
[42:46] anointed just to go to the gates she is
[42:48] Anointed to go to the door and to go
[42:51] through the door amen because she's an
[42:53] heir to All Things amen the prophet of
[42:56] God establishes what lot was he was a
[42:58] type of a Lorn believer again 1959 he
[43:02] said as it was in the days of lot so
[43:04] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[43:05] man he said now does your spirit discern
[43:08] this right remember lot was a type of
[43:11] America amen now lot is a type of the
[43:13] Lorn believer he's also a type of
[43:16] America so a Lorn believer can only go
[43:19] so far and America can only go so far he
[43:22] said it's proven it what was the sin of
[43:24] Sodom it was perversion and this
[43:26] American country of ours the women has
[43:28] degraded themselves so much until
[43:31] natural men sources has been perverted
[43:33] amen so now we have lot as a type of the
[43:35] lukor believer right we have him as a
[43:38] type of America 1964 the prophet of God
[43:41] says amen down there in Sodom we've seen
[43:44] what taken place he said now there was
[43:46] Lot a type of the church natural amen
[43:49] down in Sodom the organization so now we
[43:52] have him as the lukor believer as a type
[43:54] of America and now as a type of the
[43:57] organization amen he said but they got a
[43:59] messenger down there he said that was a
[44:02] Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts amen
[44:04] now don't forget this that Billy Graham
[44:06] could only take his people so far Billy
[44:09] Billy Graham did a good job at preaching
[44:11] repentance he preached the salvation but
[44:13] he could only take him so far and then
[44:16] there was Oral Roberts that would move
[44:18] him from Billy Graham's time Heen into
[44:20] the Pentecostal seed amen but there was
[44:22] more to it than just a Pentecostal seed
[44:25] amen but there was a word seed that had
[44:27] to be sold into the heart of the Bride
[44:30] he said see lot wanted the world Amen so
[44:33] God tore up his world and separated
[44:35] Abraham and lot he said and lot being a
[44:38] type again of a carnal believer amen
[44:41] he's a lukor Believer he's a type of
[44:43] America he's a type of the organization
[44:46] he's a type of a carnal believer who
[44:48] didn't think these things were true so
[44:51] he just went on down into Sodom amen lot
[44:54] did not believe the things that Abraham
[44:56] was talking about so he settled for
[44:58] Sodom amen and he didn't have the real
[45:00] spunk to stand out amen and call what
[45:03] was right right and what was wrong wrong
[45:05] can I sit to you like this God does not
[45:07] want mixers amen God wants separators
[45:11] amen amen Abraham was a separator amen
[45:15] lot was a mixer that's why lot amen
[45:17] could go into Sodom and could be happy
[45:20] amen with the conditions of Sodom amen
[45:22] but it vexed Abraham amen because he
[45:25] knew he was more amen he knew he was air
[45:28] to more than what Sodom had let me just
[45:30] tell you bride I tell you why you cannot
[45:32] get satisfied in Lea I tell you why this
[45:35] world does not satisfy amen the hunger
[45:38] of your soul amen it's because we are
[45:40] citizens of another kingdom we are
[45:43] seeking a city and it has foundations
[45:46] whose city is the maker and the build
[45:48] almighty God let me said as plain as I
[45:50] know how we will not back up and we will
[45:53] not lay down and we will not be satis
[45:56] with temporary conditions when there's a
[45:58] Perfection calling us when there's
[46:00] things that are to be when there's a
[46:02] future home when there's a merit supper
[46:04] of the Lamb there's something Beyond
[46:07] this Dimension and it's calling to the
[46:09] Bride of Jesus Christ come up higher yes
[46:12] sir amen come on up higher come up out
[46:15] of America come up out of lukew
[46:18] condition come up out of carnality amen
[46:21] God called Abraham Amen to a total
[46:24] separation because God requires amen a
[46:27] complete separation from the world yes
[46:31] sir God requires a complete separation
[46:34] from the world now can I can I share
[46:36] something with you tonight yes sir amen
[46:38] don't forget this okay sometimes
[46:41] advancement requires separation that's
[46:44] right yes my brother sometimes
[46:47] advancement requires separation yes my
[46:51] brother don't just suggest it no sir
[46:53] it's not a recommendation no sir it's
[46:56] not an option no it's a requirement yes
[46:59] sir brother BR said no matter what the
[47:01] world says they still want bow to the
[47:03] Modern Trend of modern religion no
[47:06] social gospel for them men there's some
[47:08] that still believe God's holy they
[47:10] believe he requires Holiness he requires
[47:13] the new birth and he requires a
[47:15] separation from sin that is not a
[47:17] suggestion my friend that is a
[47:19] requirement of a holy God requires
[47:23] Holiness he requires a new birth he
[47:26] requires a separation from sin when you
[47:29] separate can I say this when you
[47:31] separate you are separating from
[47:33] something amen amen to go into something
[47:36] that's you are separating from something
[47:38] to something so you're not just
[47:41] separating yourself to be idle and stand
[47:43] alone but you're separating yourself
[47:46] because there's a higher call yes sir
[47:48] yes my brother there's a higher calling
[47:50] upon your life and I'll tell you what
[47:52] the devil does the devil wants to put a
[47:54] pressure on mess people say well you all
[47:57] are just trying to be something you're
[47:59] just trying to preach something deep and
[48:01] you're just trying to be some revelated
[48:03] something no you don't understand we're
[48:06] not lot we're Abraham and there's a city
[48:09] that is calling our name and we cannot
[48:11] stay here and the only way to get there
[48:14] is by Revelation so we're willing to
[48:17] separate from everything contrary to
[48:19] God's word to walk in the provisions of
[48:22] Jehovah amen amen amen when you separate
[48:26] amen you separate from something Amen to
[48:29] something amen don't ever forget that
[48:32] I'm I'm I'm I'm laying some Foundation
[48:34] advancement requires separation yes sir
[48:36] and when you separate you separate from
[48:39] something to something yes sir father
[48:42] said the first man separated himself he
[48:44] said that was Adam and he separated
[48:46] himself from the word to go with his
[48:49] wife so Adam left the word to follow his
[48:52] wife that question whether God kept his
[48:54] word or not he said what a perfect type
[48:57] of the lukor carnal-minded believer
[49:00] today that still wants to cling with
[49:02] that their tradition says instead of
[49:04] taking what the word says amen there's
[49:07] your problem tradition has taking the
[49:09] place of the word amen in the place of
[49:12] the word they would rather stand with
[49:14] tradition he said he was separated to
[49:16] his wife he said and the carnal believer
[49:19] is separated amen from the word to the
[49:22] church the carnal believer is separated
[49:25] from the word to the church but the
[49:28] genuine believer the Abraham believer is
[49:31] separated from the church to the
[49:34] word want go ahead and preach amen it's
[49:37] in your first seal I'm no longer going

[50:11] word to the church we have been
[50:13] separated from the church to the word

[50:19] but the bride lives by Revelation amen a
[50:23] separation he said always the word

[51:37] come in the unity of the faith and of
[51:40] the knowledge of the Son of God to a
[51:42] perfect man to the measure of the
[51:45] stature of the fullness of Christ and
[51:47] watch what Paul says that we henceforth
[51:49] be no more children that's listen
[51:51] friends you you cannot be born and Skip
[51:54] childhood
[51:55] you got to go to childhood but you can't
[51:57] stay in childhood there's a manhood that
[52:01] is a calling you to it amen amen that we
[52:04] be no more children tossed to and fro
[52:07] and carried about with every wind of
[52:09] Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunny
[52:11] craftiness whereby they lie and waight
[52:14] to deceive amen but speaking the truth
[52:17] and love Paul says that we may grow up
[52:20] into him in all things which is the head
[52:23] even Christ and then don't you ever
[52:25] forget church that God sent a prophet in
[52:28] this s to preach a sermon called the
[52:30] stature of a perfect man and he built a
[52:33] pyramid and at the bottom of the pyramid
[52:36] it was really wide amen there was a lot
[52:38] of roomen but the closer you got to the
[52:42] Capstone the more narrow the pyramid
[52:44] become because the only thing that go
[52:47] can to can go to headship is
[52:50] perfection Paul said amen lay it not
[52:53] again the foundation of dead word
[52:56] baptism and repentance unto God let us
[52:59] go on unto Perfection but I feel like
[53:02] preaching tonight I want to announce to
[53:05] America I want to announce to Sodom I
[53:08] want to announce to the organizations I
[53:10] want to announce to the carnal Believers
[53:12] that there is an abrahamic Bride on the
[53:15] earth tonight who knows she is air to
[53:18] all things that God has is hers and she
[53:22] will not lay down and she will not quit
[53:24] growing and she will not back up because
[53:27] she knows her potential is in Jesus
[53:30] Christ amen amen that we may grow look
[53:34] at this word grow it means to cause to
[53:37] grow it means to augment it means to
[53:40] increase to become greater I love what
[53:42] the prophet says Born Again Christians
[53:44] amen grow into the stature of Christ as
[53:47] they live they're born again and their
[53:49] lives begin to shape like a baby that's
[53:51] right it takes form and begins to grow
[53:55] the first thing you know here they are
[53:56] in the full stature amen there you are
[53:58] day after day year after year they stay
[54:01] the same see now they come back to the
[54:03] word and he shows you the place of
[54:05] growth is in the word he says if ye
[54:08] abide in me and my words abide in you he
[54:12] said you cannot expect a baby to be born
[54:14] to man it's got to grow to it and we
[54:17] grow in Christ to the full stature not
[54:21] somebody get converted tonight and
[54:23] tomorrow preach the gospel amen but we
[54:25] grow up somebody say grow up we grow up
[54:28] into manhood into the stature of Christ
[54:32] see that's why Pentecostal babies amen
[54:34] could not take this message it was going
[54:37] Beyond a birth it was moving into
[54:40] adoption amen amen it was moving beyond
[54:44] gifts it was moving beyond tongues it
[54:46] was moving beyond emotion it was
[54:49] bringing a stability come on Paul said I
[54:51] ain't got time to teach all this I got
[54:53] to preach it Paul said amen that we be
[54:56] not children tossed to and fro with
[54:58] every wind of doctrin don't get mad at
[55:01] me but somebody that follows every new
[55:03] doctrine that comes around the message
[55:05] is not a manifested son they're still a
[55:08] child there's still an infant they're
[55:10] still a baby what they need to do is
[55:12] settle down somewhere and let the word
[55:15] of God begin to cause them to come to
[55:18] stability in the message of the hour
[55:21] amen now we're always talking about how
[55:23] bad the world's getting right amen but
[55:25] the pr of God said while we're talking
[55:26] about how bad the world is getting he
[55:29] said we're forgetting how powerful the
[55:30] church is becoming at the same time at
[55:34] the same time the world is getting worse
[55:37] there's a bride that's getting stronger
[55:39] brother said like this he said the
[55:41] church is growing that's each age is a
[55:44] lot in the scripture amen God through
[55:46] the holy spirit amen Reveals His word by
[55:50] manifesting it and his showing it's his
[55:54] word brought to pass in the day it's
[55:57] been promised to be brought to pass in
[56:00] listen God is not bringing Noah's
[56:02] promised to pass because this is not
[56:04] Noah's day he's not bringing Moses's
[56:07] promise to pass this is not Moses's day
[56:10] but he's bringing the promise of Elohim
[56:13] to pass in this generation because it's
[56:16] the age when Elohim but returned to the
[56:20] church for the
[56:22] manifestation preach my brother preach
[56:25] can I preach or what the manifestation
[56:28] of the word of God is the Vindication
[56:30] that it is the word that's right don't
[56:32] you ever forget that if God's word is
[56:35] God's word and it's manifested the same
[56:38] one that manifested is the same one
[56:41] that'll vindicate it want me to prove it
[56:43] to you in Genesis 1 he said let there be
[56:46] light let there be light said he he
[56:48] spoke his word and said let there be
[56:51] light he said then there was light he
[56:54] said see had there been no light then we
[56:56] would have automatically known that it
[56:58] was not God's word that's right yes we
[57:01] would have automatically known that it
[57:03] was not God's word but because there was
[57:06] light the light was the Vindication that
[57:10] it was the manifestation of the word of
[57:13] God listen friends I heard a prophet say
[57:16] let there be a bride let there be a
[57:18] messiah let there be an invincible Army

[57:24] squirrel and I give you your two sons
[57:27] and because the two sons was there and
[57:30] because the squirrels was there and
[57:32] because the bride is here I have an
[57:35] infallible right by the almighty God to
[57:38] say this day is this scripture fulfilled

[59:14] nonsense Glory I know you don't like it
[59:17] but I'll preach it anyhow we ought to be
[59:19] Beyond this it's time to grow up yes my
[59:23] it's time to move on it's time to come
[59:25] to stability yes sir yes my brother
[59:29] Prophet God said we played and we have
[59:31] Frolic as children but now we're going
[59:34] to have to put away childish things and
[59:37] take on manhood which is maturity amen
[59:41] that's where lot could not go he could
[59:43] not go to maturity he could not go to
[59:46] responsibility he could not go to
[59:48] manhood he stayed in Sodom but there was
[59:51] an Abraham who was air to the world he
[59:54] was going all the way if he had to
[59:57] struggle he would struggle if he had to
[59:59] pray he would pray whatever he had to do
[1:00:02] he was willing to do it because he was
[1:00:04] anointed to go all the way yes sir Glory
[1:00:09] now now now can I take two minutes pre
[1:00:11] can I take two minutes more than two
[1:00:13] minutes and break down to you real easy
[1:00:16] the difference in childhood and manhood
[1:00:18] go ahead my brother take your time
[1:00:20] childhood yes sir is a kid that wakes up
[1:00:22] on Thursday morning uh and they got
[1:00:24] scratchy throat and they got a little
[1:00:27] cough and they don't feel the greatest
[1:00:29] so they go in the in the living room and
[1:00:32] they say mom they say Mom I don't feel
[1:00:35] like going to school and mama says okay
[1:00:38] just go back to bed see there's no
[1:00:41] responsibility right what's he going to
[1:00:43] miss a test recess uh lunch uh-huh
[1:00:47] there's no responsibility that's right
[1:00:49] you take a man that's right that wakes
[1:00:51] up with a scratchy throat yes sir and a
[1:00:53] bad headache yes sir he still goes to
[1:00:55] work that's right you know why because
[1:00:59] there's a
[1:01:00] responsibility there's a house payment
[1:01:02] there's a car payment there's miles to
[1:01:04] feed there's bills to pay see when
[1:01:07] responsibility comes it separates the
[1:01:11] childhood from manhood that's why the
[1:01:13] prophet preached a man running from the
[1:01:16] presence of God because in the presence
[1:01:19] of God is where man finds responsibility
[1:01:23] and the prophet said we're all always
[1:01:24] prone am been to cir responsibility but
[1:01:28] you know what I say I say what a prophet
[1:01:30] said we've been babies long enough
[1:01:32] that's right but come on we might as
[1:01:35] well preach amen we might as well bring
[1:01:37] that right on in church amen we wake up
[1:01:40] on Sunday morning and break a fingernail
[1:01:42] and the car won't start and we'll go
[1:01:44] back in house and we'll say well I guess
[1:01:46] it's just wasn't God's will for me to go
[1:01:49] to church today you spiritual baby
[1:01:52] that's right preach you spiritual baby
[1:01:55] I'll tell you the difference in a
[1:01:56] spiritual baby and a son of God go ahead
[1:01:59] you let a Son of God wake up on Sunday
[1:02:00] morning and the car won't start he'll
[1:02:03] start calling people and he'll start
[1:02:05] walking to church because he knows
[1:02:08] there's a responsibility that is laying
[1:02:11] upon his life amen to come to the full
[1:02:14] stature of Jesus Christ there's a
[1:02:16] Hebrews 10 over his life it says forsake
[1:02:19] not the assembling of yourselves
[1:02:21] together brother B said we played his
[1:02:23] children long enough he said when I was
[1:02:26] a child I spake as a child because he
[1:02:28] thought as a child amen but now it's
[1:02:31] time we begin to think like men and
[1:02:33] women should hallu for we got to get
[1:02:36] down to business listen I believe it
[1:02:38] friends I believe in the spiritual
[1:02:41] growth of a Believer yes my brother I
[1:02:43] believe what Peter said when he said we
[1:02:45] desire as newborn babies desire the
[1:02:48] sincere milk of the word that she may
[1:02:51] grow thereby yes sir said you you know
[1:02:54] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word that's
[1:02:56] exactly man shall not live by bread
[1:02:58] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:03:01] out of the mouth of God if you just take
[1:03:03] each day not as just a routine but oh
[1:03:06] I'd say just to make that your heart
[1:03:08] craves for it just to sit down each day
[1:03:11] and read so much out of your Bible you
[1:03:14] would be surprised what it would do for
[1:03:16] your spiritual growth amen now I feel
[1:03:20] that devil pushing back against me well
[1:03:22] brother Andrew I'm too busy I'm too busy
[1:03:25] well if you got time for
[1:03:29] ESPN if you got time for soccer and
[1:03:32] football preach preach my brother preach
[1:03:36] if you got time for everything but the
[1:03:38] house of God you problem is not having
[1:03:41] time you're telling us where your heart
[1:03:43] is because wherever your heart is amen
[1:03:47] wherever your Treasures are there is
[1:03:49] your heart also listen this may not be
[1:03:52] what you want to hear but I going what's
[1:03:53] on my heart we need to get some men
[1:03:56] around this message to be men again quit
[1:03:59] being sissified pansies
[1:04:01] aen amen I'm going preach tonight I
[1:04:05] think it's time we get some fathers to
[1:04:07] start doing the praying instead of the
[1:04:09] mama having to do all the prayer that's
[1:04:11] exactly right I think we ought to get
[1:04:13] some fathers pressing to go to the house
[1:04:15] of God instead of Mama's begging them
[1:04:18] to you know it's a truth but it's a
[1:04:21] layout of see and limitation it's a
[1:04:23] lukew condition and it's stunning the
[1:04:26] growth of the church Preach my brother
[1:04:29] preach preach well I ain't got time for
[1:04:32] prayer time but you got time to keep up
[1:04:34] with everything in the world if you got
[1:04:37] time for ESPN you got time for the
[1:04:39] message of the hour amen amen amen

[1:04:54] Daughters of God amen amen I tell you
[1:04:57] what God desires amen God desires
[1:04:59] spiritual growth in his church amen more
[1:05:02] than he does natural growth now don't
[1:05:05] get mad at me but God is more pleased
[1:05:08] with spiritual growth yes sir and he is
[1:05:11] natural growth yes my brother you know
[1:05:13] why I can say that because he walked off
[1:05:15] and left the Baptist who was hollowing a
[1:05:17] million more in 44 and come to a few
[1:05:21] that was Abraham's type and give them
[1:05:23] the Promises of the
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:27] word now I'm going to say it to you as
[1:05:29] plain as I know how goad isel's Journey
[1:05:31] had stages Israel in Egypt Israel in the
[1:05:34] wilderness Israel in the promised land
[1:05:37] Israel in the homelands look at
[1:05:39] Deuteronomy 2 verse one Hallelujah he
[1:05:41] said we turned and took our journey into
[1:05:44] the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea
[1:05:46] that's right the Lord spake unto me and
[1:05:49] said we've compassed this Mount sier
[1:05:52] many days and the Lord spake unto me
[1:05:55] saying ye have compassed this mountain
[1:05:58] long enough turn you northward you've
[1:06:02] been around this mountain long enough
[1:06:05] it's time to turn and go northward yes
[1:06:08] sir come on Church PR in other words go
[1:06:11] be on this mountain there is more to
[1:06:14] your journey
[1:06:16] amen yes my brother go beyond this
[1:06:19] mountain there is more to your journey
[1:06:23] what you saying and the Red Sea was a
[1:06:25] part of their Journey brother Steven
[1:06:27] they had to go there but they couldn't
[1:06:29] stay there that's right they had to go
[1:06:31] to mount sier but they couldn't stay
[1:06:33] there they had to go to the Wilderness
[1:06:35] but they couldn't stay there because
[1:06:38] they was ordained to go to the promised
[1:06:40] land where the milk and honey was
[1:06:42] flowing
[1:06:45] aen now think about this preacher Israel
[1:06:48] was on a journey and brother said by
[1:06:50] automobile they would have been there in
[1:06:52] three in an hour and a half that's right
[1:06:55] automobile would have had them there in
[1:06:56] an hour and a half he said by foot they
[1:06:59] would have been there in 3 to 4 days yes
[1:07:01] sir right but instead he said what they
[1:07:04] do they wandered for 40
[1:07:07] years pre my brother they were shouting
[1:07:10] at the Red Sea that's right they were
[1:07:12] dancing at the Red Sea that's right the
[1:07:14] taskmasters was dead behind them and God
[1:07:17] said you got to go on uhhuh I mean come
[1:07:20] on brother Sten we're shouting brother
[1:07:24] we're dancing surely we finally made it
[1:07:26] God said that's a stage but there's more
[1:07:29] to it now let me just tell you what a
[1:07:31] prophet say that's my brother he said a
[1:07:33] short Journey amen turned into years of
[1:07:36] wandering in the wilderness go ahead
[1:07:38] brother see all because they chose law
[1:07:41] over Grace he said Grace had provided
[1:07:45] them a great thing he said it provided
[1:07:47] them a Passover Lamb that's right it
[1:07:49] provided them a prophet that's right and
[1:07:51] it provided them an Angel that's right
[1:07:53] but Passover lamb was for their sins yes
[1:07:55] sir the prophet was their instructor and
[1:07:57] the angel was their gu this Grace had oh
[1:08:01] God the grace had provided them an
[1:08:04] escape out of Egypt before they had any
[1:08:07] law that's right yes my brother before
[1:08:10] there was a law there was a Grace yes
[1:08:13] sir oh God yes my brother before there
[1:08:15] was a law there was a Grace So before
[1:08:19] they come in the law and they stopped at
[1:08:21] the law God had a message of Grace that
[1:08:25] was provided for them that would put
[1:08:27] them in the greatest Revival they had
[1:08:30] ever seen this revival they seen the
[1:08:32] powers of God they seen the sunshine
[1:08:35] mother the rest of the world was in
[1:08:36] darkness they seen the mighty hand of
[1:08:38] God deliver the innocent people they
[1:08:41] seen all this thing and they still chose
[1:08:44] law over Grace preach now now I'm just
[1:08:47] going to say what a prophet he said
[1:08:49] Israel's journey is a perfect type of
[1:08:52] the church today amen he said this
[1:08:54] children of Israel starting on their
[1:08:55] Journey perfect time for the church
[1:08:57] today making its way to the glory land

[1:09:32] temporary places permanent we are
[1:09:34] growing daily in the revelation of the
[1:09:37] word of God Amen I tell you what the
[1:09:40] prophet said he said we're moving up yes

[1:09:47] know how God's church is not going down
[1:09:51] we are moving up amen you know how I can
[1:09:53] say that is because God foreen he
[1:09:56] ordained a church that was to appear
[1:09:59] before him in other words he's not going
[1:10:02] to come down amen for you to appear
[1:10:04] before him he's going to come down and

[1:10:41] you ever forget this okay your objective
[1:10:44] is the

[1:12:42] would be made manifest when God's sons
[1:12:45] that rejoiced with him before the

[1:15:29] to the Old Testament go ahead my brother

[1:15:47] Hebrews 9 he writes about the blood
[1:15:49] uhhuh right yes sir are you hearing me
[1:15:53] and the book of Hebrews is the most
[1:15:55] debated book in the entire Bible goad on
[1:15:58] who wrote it they believe Moses wrote
[1:16:00] Genesis more than they believe Paul
[1:16:03] wrote Hebrews but in the end time God
[1:16:06] would send a prophet that would say
[1:16:08] listen oh God say listen I believe that
[1:16:12] Paul wrote the book of Hebrews now some
[1:16:15] people even around the message brother
[1:16:16] Steven they say well I've been reading
[1:16:18] this philosopher and I've been reading
[1:16:19] this kind amen but but I'm the God I'm
[1:16:22] the guy that if a prophet said it was
[1:16:25] Paul it's yes sir yes my brother yes my
[1:16:28] brother I'm sorry I'm the guy that if a
[1:16:30] prophet said was Apostle Paul I'll put
[1:16:33] my voice with the voice of AIC Prophet
[1:16:37] say it was Paul yes sir yes you know why
[1:16:42] because the book of oh God I'm preaching
[1:16:44] another sermon the book of Hebrews has
[1:16:46] the
[1:16:48] key yes my brother brother BR said it's
[1:16:51] the key book of all of Paul's letters
[1:16:53] yes my brother said the key to the
[1:16:54] entire Cannon of scripture is found in
[1:16:57] the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter you
[1:16:59] know what he said he said it's Jesus
[1:17:02] Christ the same yesterday today forever
[1:17:06] yes sir you know what GL a few years ago
[1:17:10] brother Stephen A a few years ago we was
[1:17:12] up in Pennsylvania brother Sean and I
[1:17:14] for some meetings and we was on a
[1:17:16] campground and this Church of Christ
[1:17:18] preacher come to brother Shawn and he
[1:17:20] said sir you all believe in miracles
[1:17:22] brother Sean said we sure do he said he
[1:17:24] said we don't believe in miracles he
[1:17:26] said there are no more miracles he said
[1:17:28] well what do you believe he said well we
[1:17:30] believe the Bible he said well your
[1:17:31] Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:17:35] yesterday today and forever you know
[1:17:38] what that man looked at even said he
[1:17:40] said that scripture don't even make
[1:17:43] sense he said go read the book of
[1:17:45] Hebrews the 13th chapter right he said
[1:17:49] and you'll be reading through there and
[1:17:50] I did it he said you'll be reading
[1:17:52] through there about about all different
[1:17:54] kinds of things and then all of a sudden
[1:17:56] out of nowhere Paul just says Jesus
[1:17:59] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:18:02] forever and really brother Steven if
[1:18:05] you're reading it it seems like it don't
[1:18:07] even fit in there preach preacher you

[1:18:17] abam said a prophet brings the key to
[1:18:19] the generation amen now come on y'all if

[1:18:39] key but oh God but you you yourself you
[1:18:44] take the key and you hide the key and
[1:18:48] then you call the person that you want
[1:18:50] to come into your house and you reveal
[1:18:53] to them where the key is hidden and then
[1:18:56] they
[1:18:58] walk and then they walk up there and
[1:19:01] they pull the mat open the whole world
[1:19:04] don't know where the key is the
[1:19:06] neighborhood don't know where the key is
[1:19:08] but there's an elected selected man
[1:19:12] chosen person that knows where the key
[1:19:16] is 2,000 years they have been trying to
[1:19:19] get in God's house and they don't know
[1:19:21] the key but God would send a prophet in
[1:19:25] the last days would say the key has been
[1:19:28] hidden in the book of Hebrews Jesus
[1:19:31] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:19:36] forever glory glory and there was a

[1:36:15] to preach them to you Moses had to get
[1:36:17] out of the camp of the Egyptians that's
[1:36:19] right in order to fulfill God's will for
[1:36:21] his life that's exactly so God went to
[1:36:23] Moses's camp and Called Moses out of the
[1:36:27] camp amen called out called him out of
[1:36:30] the camp and met him in the form of the
[1:36:32] pillar of fire that's right Moses met
[1:36:35] God and he ran and got his wife and baby
[1:36:38] and saddled up a mule and took off to
[1:36:41] Egypt and they said where you going

[1:37:20] don't you forget this is Israel Israel
[1:37:22] met God by the way of a Vindicated
[1:37:25] Prophet whose name was mesen amen what
[1:37:28] what the prophet of God said yes sir
[1:37:30] remember sometimes advancement this is
[1:37:32] me advancement requires separation ex
[1:37:35] and God told Moses separate yourself and
[1:37:38] then he just swallowed up the Dayan and
[1:37:39] chorus he said now watch all the signs
[1:37:42] and wonders Vindicated his presence he
[1:37:44] said now the man made himself a camp a
[1:37:47] camp of creed uhhuh are y'all ready for
[1:37:49] this preach my brother can can can you
[1:37:51] take this quote go ahead swallow it a
[1:37:53] camp of creed and tradition not God's
[1:37:56] Camp of his word uhhuh a camp of their
[1:38:02] own god brother says God speaking of God
[1:38:05] he had to leave them for he is the word
[1:38:09] amen don't you ever forget this part yes
[1:38:11] sir he cannot stay where people are
[1:38:14] taught out of his word amen amen amen so
[1:38:19] the minute you bring Psych you to a pull
[1:38:21] pit that's it that's it the minute you
[1:38:24] bring religious ideas to a pull pit
[1:38:26] apart from a Vindicated Prophet is the
[1:38:29] minute you put God outside of the camp
[1:38:31] that's exactly right preach my brother
[1:38:34] he cannot stay in the camp he can't he
[1:38:36] never did he must stay exactly where his
[1:38:39] word is amen when God come among them he
[1:38:42] walked in but their Traditions had so
[1:38:45] took his place among them that he was a
[1:38:48] stranger to them the traditions of the
[1:38:50] fathers ahh tradition are you ready for
[1:38:53] this tradition they were washing pans
[1:38:55] and they were grooming their hair and
[1:38:57] they were wearing certain buttons on
[1:38:58] their coat uhuh
[1:39:01] uh oh God so they were no longer just
[1:39:05] called Christians they were wearing tape
[1:39:07] boy pins
[1:39:09] and come on and I'm a I'm a this and I'm
[1:39:12] a that no no clicks butam said this he
[1:39:16] said one said I'm a staunch Pharisee and
[1:39:18] the other one is a sadducee and that it
[1:39:20] all taking the place of the word of God
[1:39:22] Among those men till when God come to
[1:39:24] Vis that he was a foreigner may I say
[1:39:27] this with love and respect but to drive
[1:39:29] it home it's the same thing
[1:39:33] today today it hasn't changed a bit
[1:39:37] right when he comes among the people in
[1:39:39] his power and manifestation to prove
[1:39:41] that his word is the same yesterday and
[1:39:43] forever that's right because he is the
[1:39:45] word amen the people says fortune teller
[1:39:48] be El above Jesus only something like
[1:39:49] that some class youed somewhere but it
[1:39:52] has to be that way amen amen amen can I
[1:39:57] can I leave you this go ahead my brother
[1:39:59] traditional teaching preach my brother
[1:40:02] preach my brother apart from the word
[1:40:04] preach my brother crucifies the effect
[1:40:07] of the manifested Vindicated word of the
[1:40:10] hour repeat it again my brother
[1:40:12] traditional teaching yes my brother
[1:40:15] apart from the word crucifies the effect
[1:40:19] of the manifested and Vindicated word
[1:40:22] amen let it speak for itself that's it
[1:40:26] that's
[1:40:27] it that's it when the light showed up
[1:40:31] they didn't have to stand there explain
[1:40:32] it HH huh no no sir does God keep his
[1:40:35] word well there's the light am amen
[1:40:39] that's it and Jesus said amen you make
[1:40:41] the word of God of none effect through
[1:40:44] your tradition amen amen look at this
[1:40:48] word effect to render void are you ready
[1:40:50] for this yes to deprive the force and
[1:40:53] Authority so tradition literally
[1:40:56] deprives the message of its force and
[1:40:59] Authority that's exactly right that's
[1:41:02] exactly right well I'm this close to it
[1:41:05] exactly right they desired a
[1:41:06] denomination tradition in the stead of
[1:41:09] the true word being manifested and prove
[1:41:12] that it's God amongst the people are
[1:41:14] y'all ready for this yes sir by science
[1:41:17] through pictures a light the same Angel
[1:41:20] of the Lord the pillar of fire amen so
[1:41:24] they take this down preach my brother
[1:41:27] and they put up Hoffman's head of
[1:41:29] Christ confusion now don't get mad at me
[1:41:33] I believe in Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:41:35] yes sir but a prophet said that's a
[1:41:37] painting that's exactly right that is a
[1:41:40] painting that's an original that's
[1:41:42] exactly right he said that's the closest
[1:41:45] thing to what he looked like when I saw
[1:41:47] him in the saes brush field that's right
[1:41:50] that's and his hair blowing in the wind
[1:41:52] right that's right he said that's the
[1:41:53] closest thing so what they do brother is
[1:41:56] they take the Vindicated down and they
[1:41:59] put up a painting and say now let's all
[1:42:01] just focus on
[1:42:04] Jesus so what they do is they take the
[1:42:07] fire out of the church am and they
[1:42:10] replace it with a painted fire
[1:42:13] that's but but don't you ever forget
[1:42:16] this okay we're not following a pillar
[1:42:18] of
[1:42:19] ice
[1:42:21] it's a pillar of fire
[1:42:24] aen it's a Vindicated manifestation amen
[1:42:28] come on Church the same God that was
[1:42:31] with Moses the same God with Paul the
[1:42:34] same God with William Brandon he said
[1:42:37] the same one that lived on the earth in
[1:42:40] the body of Jesus Christ has come upon
[1:42:43] his people in the last day where
[1:42:45] scientists took the picture of it the
[1:42:48] church has seen it it's thoroughly
[1:42:50] identified by tapes and everything
[1:42:52] around and around the world yes my
[1:42:54] brother yes sir yes sir Glory they think
[1:42:59] I'm closing they think their Traditions
[1:43:01] is of God but it won't stand up with a
[1:43:04] word and neither does God vindicate it
[1:43:06] to be
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:10] right the Jews did when the veil was ran
[1:43:12] and bought brought God into Plain View
[1:43:14] hanging on the cross he was in plain
[1:43:16] view but they couldn't see it could it
[1:43:18] be possible amen that the Gentiles is
[1:43:20] did the same thing when they've had the
[1:43:22] church ages of the Son of God but when
[1:43:25] now the veil of this denomination and
[1:43:28] things the veil of tradition that we've
[1:43:30] got since Pentecost when the church
[1:43:33] Traditions has been rent the things that
[1:43:35] people said days of Miracles has passed
[1:43:38] and God has took the veil off of it and
[1:43:41] brought it in plain view amen amen and
[1:43:44] the ready to crucify it
[1:43:47] again yes sir so two th000 years ago
[1:43:52] right he walked up Mount Calvary goo's
[1:43:55] Hill laid down on a cross give up his
[1:43:59] life right they nailed his hands right
[1:44:02] they nailed his feet they driven his
[1:44:05] side they crown of thorns on his head
[1:44:09] hung him up and said
[1:44:12] crucify Hallelujah
[1:44:14] today they bring the message of the hour
[1:44:16] the word of God ream said they lay it on
[1:44:19] a wooden pull pit and with those
[1:44:21] denominational Creed nails they crucify
[1:44:25] the word of God
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:28] aresh
[1:44:31] amen amen why because their Camp has set
[1:44:36] its
[1:44:36] boundary it wouldn't let them it
[1:44:39] wouldn't let him in the camp and it
[1:44:41] wouldn't let anybody go out to him pre
[1:44:44] now watch this the reason they hated him
[1:44:48] is he was a breaker of their tradition
[1:44:51] that's exactly right he was an
[1:44:53] upsetter that's exactly of their
[1:44:55] churches that's exactly right to them he
[1:44:58] was a fortune teller he said and I
[1:45:00] believe if he come among us today he
[1:45:02] would be the same thing to us for we
[1:45:05] have tradition we have denomination we
[1:45:07] can't even get along with one another
[1:45:09] why there's only one place that a man
[1:45:11] can get along that's under the shed
[1:45:13] blood
[1:45:16] right now don't get mad at me I told you
[1:45:19] I'm closing on tradition and I am
[1:45:21] Jesus walked to the Feast of Passover
[1:45:24] they're holding kosher bread in
[1:45:27] commemoration of what God done for him
[1:45:30] brother BM said like this he said this
[1:45:32] was at the Feast of Passover and Jesus
[1:45:35] walked in their midst and they were
[1:45:37] drinking from a fountain and holding the
[1:45:40] kosher in commemoration of the manner
[1:45:42] that fell in the wilderness and Jesus
[1:45:44] cried right out in the
[1:45:45] midst and said I am the bread of life
[1:45:49] your father drank Mana or drank water
[1:45:52] out of a rock and they're every one dead
[1:45:55] right
[1:45:57] right see what was once a blessed symbol
[1:46:00] uhuh had become a blinding tradition
[1:46:04] that's the problem right there can I can
[1:46:07] I can I leave you this and I'm going
[1:46:09] home don't ever let anybody put any
[1:46:13] pressure on you when your righteous
[1:46:16] indignation Rises up when the message is
[1:46:19] being Cru crucified in your presence
[1:46:21] thank you my
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:24] brother thank you come on church we
[1:46:26] might as well face it amen face it
[1:46:29] people people get now now I'm not
[1:46:31] against streaming not against streaming
[1:46:33] okay but people get on streaming and do
[1:46:36] and say things and send it in churches
[1:46:39] and then pastors like brother stepen
[1:46:41] have to get up and correct it and then
[1:46:42] all of a sudden they've got the wrong
[1:46:43] spirit and they don't love right right
[1:46:46] no I tell you why it's because you're
[1:46:49] not sending in your tradition that's
[1:46:52] exactly right into the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:54] Christ amen and the Bethlehem dwellers
[1:46:56] holding their peace amen we've held our
[1:46:59] peace long enough we've taken a backseat
[1:47:02] long enough we've let you get up and say
[1:47:05] well we need to get people to Christ and
[1:47:06] not the message long enough we're done
[1:47:09] with them Traditions let the word of God
[1:47:11] Reign in power and manifestation and
[1:47:15] Revelation and Vindication in the midst
[1:47:18] of the Church of the Living God Amen
[1:47:21] Amen Let our musicians come
[1:47:25] Amen Let our musicians
[1:47:27] come we will not back up tradition any
[1:47:30] longer no sir we will not bow our knee
[1:47:33] to tradition no sir we're not Baptist no
[1:47:37] we're not Pentecostals no we're not
[1:47:40] methodists no we're Believers amen we
[1:47:44] have a right to this word
[1:47:49] amen Glory somebody says why do y'all
[1:47:52] get up there and hark about the message
[1:47:54] we ain't harking we're preaching get it
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:59] right can I tell you why that when
[1:48:02] somebody begins to crucify the effect of
[1:48:04] this message in your presence something
[1:48:06] Rises up within you can I prove it to
[1:48:08] you by the Bible because Revelation 18
[1:48:11] the same voice of Revelation 18:4 is in
[1:48:13] Malachi 4 is in Revelation 10:7 is
[1:48:16] revelation 3 amen the voice of the
[1:48:19] seventh angel on Earth echoing the
[1:48:21] message from Heaven and the message from
[1:48:23] Heaven is come out of her my
[1:48:27] people right can I tell you the very
[1:48:30] next chapter from Revelation 18 is
[1:48:32] revelation 19 and the prophet says when
[1:48:35] he comes he's going to be called the
[1:48:37] word of God riding upon a white horse
[1:48:40] and the followers of
[1:48:42] heaven will be behind
[1:48:46] him see that's why we can't hold our
[1:48:49] peace is CA we've got Captain Jesus's
[1:48:54] jeans on the inside of us and the
[1:48:58] prophet said what he done will do what
[1:49:00] he done will do you know what he done he
[1:49:03] broke the denominational Veil he broke
[1:49:05] the veil of tradition he broke the veils
[1:49:08] that was hiding from from you he broke
[1:49:10] the veils of Pride you King's Daughters
[1:49:12] act like it live like it he broke every
[1:49:15] Veil no matter what PhD lld says if it's

[1:54:31] have blazed Trails for new
[1:54:33] revelation they've left the confines of
[1:54:35] the word of God and what a prophet
[1:54:37] taught and Lord because they think the
[1:54:40] things brother BR said are a little too
[1:54:42] radical or they're a little too far out
[1:54:44] there they're trying to find a more
[1:54:46] refined and Polished way to approach the
[1:54:48] people of God
[1:54:50] but Lord we're not
[1:54:52] compromisers we're not chicken-hearted
[1:54:54] Eagles we're Eagles through and through
[1:54:57] and we'll hunt for our Mana we'll dig

[1:55:20] Revelation and Lord at that altar we
[1:55:22] come and because we're not coming to the
[1:55:25] altar out of tradition we're coming by
[1:55:27] revelation we lay our lives down and
[1:55:31] Lord you take your word and you cut away

[1:55:43] and you cut away camps and you cut away
[1:55:46] ways of saying things you cut that all
[1:55:49] away Lord and you show your Eagles the
[1:55:52] word of God for the hour the manifested
[1:55:55] Vindicated word and they rise up in the
[1:55:58] power of Revelation and they begin to

[1:56:05] walking in Authority father I pray for
[1:56:08] every believer here tonight Lord father
[1:56:11] I know what this church has come through
[1:56:12] and what they've had to stand against
[1:56:15] but father you didn't separate them and
[1:56:17] leave them idle out in the wilderness
[1:56:20] but Lord you separated them from
[1:56:21] something to something Lord you
[1:56:25] separated them from something to
[1:56:27] something and that's this unlimited rise
[1:56:29] Revival Lord the devil's done everything
[1:56:31] he could to shut this pastor up in this
[1:56:33] church but there're still sounding Out
[1:56:36] the voice of
[1:56:37] Revelation they're still digging to the
[1:56:39] word of God and establishing their
[1:56:40] hearts and lives under what a prophet is
[1:56:43] taught father may they never lose the
[1:56:46] ability to be taught
[1:56:50] by the message of the
[1:56:51] hour father I pray Lord you would give
[1:56:53] them courage Lord if there be some
[1:56:56] children here that have not turned from
[1:56:58] childhood to manhood Lord may you give
[1:57:01] them the grace tonight to grow up into

[2:02:31] tolerance when it comes to the message
[2:02:33] of the hour if I heard you even saying
[2:02:36] because I can detect speeches now among
[2:02:38] preachers when I even decode a little
[2:02:41] speech of a Preacher like this you will
[2:02:43] never preach
[2:02:45] here you will never preach in this PO
[2:02:47] you can preach elsewhere

[2:02:51] me I don't play around with my heart
[2:02:55] amen I rather listen to brother Bram
[2:02:57] then listening to you amen why are we
[2:03:00] standing quoting Charles Spurgeon
[2:03:02] Charles Spurgeon we have so many quotes
[2:03:04] in the message that we can quote withing
[2:03:07] Charles what is going
[2:03:09] [Applause]

[2:03:29] amen here we want Malachi 4 just come
[2:03:33] preach Malachi 4 that's it
[2:03:36] denominational suffer just to get a
[2:03:39] sermon they have to copy one and another
[2:03:41] watch this one watch this one and copy
[2:03:44] and go repeat so and so sermon you don't
[2:03:46] have to copy it's over there in the
[2:03:48] message more more than 1,000 message and
[2:03:51] one message you can preach it for for
[2:03:53] for for 3
[2:03:55] [Applause]
[2:03:57] years I don't know what's going on with
[2:04:00] preaching you want to preach they say
[2:04:02] well when you preach in this church do
[2:04:04] not quote the prophet don't go to that
[2:04:10] church no no no no brother we need to
[2:04:13] keep uh I mean uh Brotherhood you in so
[2:04:16] and so Church you quote the message when
[2:04:18] you go some else you don't want to quote
[2:04:19] the message to to please the pastor are
[2:04:22] we after
[2:04:24] money are we looking for money no cut it
[2:04:31] off stay where we are not ashamed of the
[2:04:36] message even where what you think
[2:04:39] brother BR made an error I will identify
[2:04:42] with
[2:04:46] it if you come you say you know that
[2:04:49] brother brandham wanted to kill a police
[2:04:51] officer when he was not safe I would say
[2:04:53] yes I know that story and I can even
[2:04:56] quote that story from the pulpit because
[2:04:59] whatever Abraham did he lied we put it
[2:05:01] back on the Bible and we can still cot
[2:05:04] it so I don't see anything to hide about
[2:05:07] brother Bram I will put it all on
[2:05:10] display because we know he was not a man
[2:05:14] it was God that Vindicated himself in a
[2:05:18] Ministry of a

[2:05:24] around oh it's a fellowship over there

[2:07:31] picture before this one happened what
[2:07:34] kind of Rocket can can draw Jesus Christ

[2:07:41] cloud that Vindicated that what brother
[2:07:44] Bram was telling us about this painting
[2:07:47] was correct because the cloud Vindicated
[2:07:50] this painting So this painting was used
[2:07:54] as a reference for the cloud and the
[2:07:57] cloud came and vindicate this one
[2:07:59] because this one was in 33 or something
[2:08:02] that brother Bram spoke about and this
[2:08:04] happened in 63 and you take 63 in the
[2:08:07] what a rocket it was a revelation rocket
