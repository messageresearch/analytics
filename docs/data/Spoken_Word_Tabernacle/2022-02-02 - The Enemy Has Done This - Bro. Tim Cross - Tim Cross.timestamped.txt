[45:38] print it out and give it to the people
[45:41] so if you go out or you're coming on

[45:56] so it shows you it's a brief brief brief
[45:59] chart that shows you the entrance of the
[46:01] tabernacle the brazen altar the lever
[46:05] and after the level the first uh the
[46:07] holy place then the holy of the oldest

[46:27] you really caught it
[46:29] amen
[46:30] if you don't catch it it's a problem
[46:34] because all we're trying to do is show
[46:37] you where you are
[46:39] anybody care
[46:40] in other words
[46:44] ah please be the name of the lord this
[46:47] church have
[46:48] an anointing
[46:51] amen
[46:56] if i call this apple
[46:59] everybody here
[47:01] one two three
[47:04] i can preach to you apple all the time
[47:07] and you will never understand what an
[47:09] apple is
[47:11] amen amen what are we doing with the
[47:13] tabernacle
[47:14] i'm just trying to help somebody who
[47:17] have not caught yet what we're doing
[47:19] with the tabernacle
[47:21] at the beginning we described to you
[47:23] everything then i stop and i say
[47:26] what does this mean to us you remember
[47:29] on sunday
[47:31] amen in other words what is this
[47:33] information to us then we begin to give
[47:36] description
[47:38] of the part of the tabernacle
[47:41] the reason why we're giving you
[47:42] description or symptoms
[47:46] you have a runny nose
[47:48] you'll not smell
[47:51] you have headache
[47:53] you have a fever
[47:55] what does it mean
[48:03] any question
[48:05] that's what we did we started on sunday
[48:08] so we described to you what are the
[48:10] symptoms
[48:12] of somebody who lives in the other court
[48:17] amen
[48:18] they come late to church they do this
[48:21] and this all of that we explain to you
[48:24] everything that was just the beginning
[48:27] amen because i'm going to dig into that
[48:29] tabernacle pretty deep
[48:31] when we go deeper we're going to come up
[48:33] with roof
[48:35] you remember we left the roof we're
[48:36] going to come up with roof
[48:38] when we come up with roof then we go to
[48:40] the chamber
[48:42] when we move up from the chamber then we
[48:44] go to ezekiel
[48:45] when we move from ezekiel then we go to
[48:48] first john and you come out from there
[48:50] when you come back from there you perch
[48:56] amen
[48:57] so when we are describing to you
[49:00] go listen to the sermon again
[49:03] when we describe to you the other court
[49:07] you need to check your life
[49:10] do you hear me
[49:11] amen
[49:12] and then you look at the description
[49:15] if you find those description in your
[49:18] life
[49:20] the crude
[49:22] pure
[49:23] direct message is you don't have the
[49:26] holy ghost
[49:30] it's hard
[49:32] but i won't have your blood in my hand
[49:34] amen if you look at the description i
[49:37] gave on sunday that's just the beginning
[49:39] of the description and i'm gonna get
[49:42] even into the marriage you heard me
[49:44] touching marriage on sunday amen there
[49:47] is a reason why because when you start
[49:49] marriage whatever you set up at the
[49:52] beginning
[49:53] will cause you problem down the road
[49:58] you can build your husband right at the
[50:00] beginning
[50:03] or you can manage your husband down the
[50:05] road with a lot of oil change and check
[50:08] engine
[50:12] do you hear me
[50:13] you mean me
[50:14] make the husband from the beginning
[50:18] make him
[50:20] understand that you're a christian
[50:25] do you hear me
[50:27] right at the beginning of the marriage
[50:29] tell him we need to go to church
[50:33] amen
[50:34] tell him what you're doing is wrong
[50:37] it's contrary to the word
[50:38] don't condone with him
[50:41] trying to show him love
[50:43] you are building another character
[50:47] and after a while that character will be
[50:50] like a shelter of a turtle
[50:57] don't worry
[50:59] so what i'm saying let me lock that up
[51:01] we'll see down the road what i'm trying
[51:03] to say
[51:04] look at every description on sunday
[51:07] i don't care if you 20 years in the
[51:09] message
[51:10] i don't care with you 30 years in the
[51:12] message i don't care if you were born in
[51:15] the message
[51:17] remember the rich young hero right
[51:19] if you have those symptoms
[51:22] covered
[51:24] you don't have the holy ghost
[51:27] you're just in a justified state
[51:30] and i will dig into the justification in
[51:33] three steps and then you will see what
[51:35] is justification this is the problem we
[51:37] have a big confusion in a message where
[51:40] people don't know where they are so when
[51:42] i'm giving you that information
[51:45] it is for you to check your life
[51:48] if i say one thing it's checking the
[51:50] second is checking what god is telling
[51:52] you is this is where you are
[51:55] you don't stay there you need to move
[51:57] forward quickly because death is coming
[52:02] do you hear me the only place that you
[52:04] can get and know that i really made it
[52:08] is the holy of holies and you gotta know
[52:12] that you are there there is a
[52:14] description your life the life you've
[52:16] been living for 10 years has been giving
[52:19] you signal you didn't understand them
[52:22] you were casting out devil in jesus name
[52:24] in jesus name in jesus name no
[52:29] you cast the devil and he comes back
[52:30] again you cast the devil and he comes
[52:32] back again because you don't understand
[52:34] where you are amen you can never have
[52:37] the holy ghost and have a stubborn
[52:39] spirit
[52:42] rebellious to your parent you don't have
[52:45] the holy ghost you're fooling yourself
[52:47] it's clear amen
[52:50] oh my god i'm not preaching i'm going to
[52:52] let the preacher do do the preaching
[52:54] amen
[52:55] so what i'm just i'm just reminding you
[52:58] if you miss the simplicity of the gospel
[53:01] the three steps of the tabernacle are
[53:05] reflecting the three steps of grace go
[53:08] back and look at the quote i gave you on
[53:11] sunday amen so the other court brother
[53:14] branham say was a justification the holy
[53:16] place was sanctification and the holy of
[53:19] holies is the baptism of the holy spirit
[53:23] amen but we have to break it down so you
[53:27] see exactly am i justify
[53:30] or am i sanctified or do i really have
[53:33] the holy ghost if you justify it's
[53:35] telling you you have been stuck
[53:37] somewhere for years you need to move up
[53:40] amen if you sanctify there is a way a
[53:43] sanctified life is
[53:47] you're watching pornography you say you
[53:49] have sanctification you're wasting your
[53:50] time you're fooling yourself you don't
[53:53] have
[53:54] it amen
[53:56] so we stop on sunday when you confess
[54:00] brother branham said that old nature is
[54:02] still there
[54:05] but you have a clean conscience toward
[54:08] god
[54:09] and that clean conscience has been
[54:11] fooling you for years
[54:13] and you thought you have the holy ghost
[54:15] that's why your life is up
[54:17] and down tomorrow fire to go to then
[54:21] today the fire is going up and then
[54:23] tomorrow fire then after that the fire
[54:25] is going down tomorrow and you wonder
[54:27] why can i why i can't keep this fire all
[54:30] the time there is a reason why you can't
[54:32] keep the fire all the time because it
[54:34] depends on where you are in the
[54:36] tabernacle as long as you dare the
[54:39] cosmos will work on you the zodiac will
[54:42] continue to affect you until you pass
[54:45] the face of the remember that first veil
[54:47] doesn't have caribbean
[54:49] the gate doesn't have caribbean so you
[54:51] can move on quickly
[54:53] amen that's where the family of
[54:55] cornelius moved quickly and stuck
[54:57] somewhere you will see down the road
[55:00] because there was no caribbean so when
[55:02] peter was speaking to them it was very
[55:05] easy for them to enter the holy of
[55:07] holies and the holy ghost to baptize
[55:09] them
[55:11] because the water baptism is essential
[55:13] now they're pulling them up like hey you
[55:15] still need the water but the holy ghost
[55:18] is already there
[55:20] go back again and listen it is not
[55:23] information for the head
[55:26] don't look at somebody else look at your
[55:29] own life
[55:30] examine yourself whether you are in the
[55:33] faith if the description that we gave
[55:36] you you find yourself inside that
[55:38] description it is time to get serious
[55:41] with god to start praying god so that
[55:44] god can deliver you and move you from
[55:47] that justified state
[55:49] all the way to the sun to the
[55:51] sanctification all the way to the holy
[55:53] of holies if not
[55:56] the showdown is coming
[55:58] and it's going to blow you up completely
[56:01] this is why you see people 20 years in
[56:04] the message
[56:05] and the backslid
[56:07] and when the backsleep they go back into
[56:09] the world and they start doing things
[56:11] like i thought this young man was born
[56:13] in a message yeah they didn't understand
[56:16] they never got the holy ghost
[56:18] and when the challenge come the backslid
[56:20] completely
[56:22] and they ran away from the church
[56:23] because there was no holy ghost they
[56:25] grew up like the rich young ruler
[56:28] the message was a legalistic thing
[56:31] amen there was no life
[56:33] that's the reason why you see all these
[56:36] up and down up and down up and down so
[56:39] remember when you're listening to the
[56:41] sermon
[56:42] forget about your neighbor forget about
[56:44] what is going on it is so simple don't
[56:47] overthink
[56:49] don't try to bring
[56:51] complicated revelation we already break
[56:53] it down for you the problem with human
[56:55] being you break it down and they take
[56:56] and then try to
[56:58] mix it up again
[57:00] remember all description is not to kill
[57:03] you because it's going to rock your boat
[57:05] very hard i'm going to rock it again
[57:07] very hard until you feel like you were
[57:10] never a christian before it is just to
[57:13] shake you up and make sure all the loose
[57:15] feathers are gone amen all the desires
[57:18] are gone amen so you must enter into a
[57:22] place where no matter
[57:25] rain
[57:26] it's not raining whatever is happening
[57:28] in your life
[57:30] you in a cruise control
[57:32] your speed is still valid there's
[57:35] nothing that's going to change you
[57:38] then you know you're a candidate for the
[57:39] rapture
[57:41] amen
[57:43] amen remember we're not trying to kill
[57:45] you i know when we touch those area are
[57:48] you like ouch it's me yes i'm just
[57:51] telling you this is where you have been
[57:53] you don't have the holy ghost
[57:56] you need to move up
[57:57] but the one who puts you there is the
[57:59] holy ghost
[58:00] but he have not entered into you yet
[58:03] because he must clean the vessel you
[58:06] don't understand you're struggling with
[58:08] clothing you're struggling with high
[58:10] heels you're struggling with makeup
[58:11] you're struggling with now those na all
[58:14] that you're doing it's just telling you
[58:16] you outside you outside you outside you
[58:18] don't understand
[58:19] and when sickness comes in jesus name in
[58:22] jesus name
[58:24] you need to tell the holy ghost to get
[58:25] that stuff out
[58:27] or you gotta pastor your spirit
[58:30] and he was not the holy ghost
[58:32] sorry so if i rock your boat early i am
[58:36] not doing it wait for sunday don't run
[58:38] away
[58:40] stay in church
[58:43] there is two ways to run away
[58:46] do you know that
[58:48] you can run away clearly or you can run
[58:50] away with a legitimate reason
[58:57] sorry my brother i'm gonna let you
[58:59] preach
[59:00] i can prove to you in the scripture
[59:03] when the invitation was given
[59:05] for the people to come to the
[59:08] to the wedding
[59:10] go look at the reason the people give
[59:14] legitimate reason
[59:17] my father died i need to go bury him
[59:20] who would not let that person go bury
[59:23] his father
[59:24] we always say oh praise the lord we'll
[59:27] pray for you just go ahead and do it
[59:29] jesus turn around and say let's
[59:34] if i tell you this you call me a cruel
[59:36] pastor
[59:38] right
[59:39] it is running from the calling of god
[59:43] with a legitimate reason
[59:45] that with reasoning it sounds very good
[59:49] and with compassion
[59:52] it's very good and the people will
[59:56] sympathize with you but down deep in
[59:59] your heart
[1:00:01] you know the true reason you're running
[1:00:03] away
[1:00:04] it is a spirit pulling you away from
[1:00:08] your deliverance
[1:00:09] with a legitimate reason
[1:00:17] stay put
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] you remember my mother in prayer
[1:00:24] we have like three death in a family
[1:00:27] my sister lost her son in europe they
[1:00:30] just buried
[1:00:32] him back in the country
[1:00:34] then my cousin lost her husband right in
[1:00:37] the middle of that and then yesterday my
[1:00:39] mom lost his younger brother that's why
[1:00:41] my wife is not here she's streaming
[1:00:43] lord's willing and then she's just
[1:00:45] staying with my mom kind of grieving so
[1:00:48] keep her in prayer so i know i exhort
[1:00:50] her a little bit that we have a blessed
[1:00:52] hope and everything will be okay the
[1:00:54] coming of the lord will solve a lot of
[1:00:56] stuff amen and also remember brother
[1:00:59] michael daley he lost his brother-in-law
[1:01:02] in london
[1:01:04] so lord willing maybe next week or
[1:01:06] something he probably might travel if
[1:01:08] everything works fine
[1:01:10] uh with the lord so make sure you keep
[1:01:12] him in prayer he tried to make his way
[1:01:16] here but he's still probably down in
[1:01:17] louisiana maybe he's streaming so you
[1:01:20] know brother mike if he gotta be in
[1:01:21] church he's gonna do everything he can
[1:01:23] to be in church that's your loyal
[1:01:25] brother amen so let's remember the
[1:01:27] family especially her sister going back
[1:01:30] to see her husband and the husband
[1:01:31] passed away so remember the family a lot
[1:01:34] of people passing away

[1:01:56] from the hotel so the lord opened up the
[1:01:58] way the lord spared him from a deadly
[1:02:01] accident so the man you see here is a
[1:02:04] miracle

[1:02:08] exactly they find him unconscious if i'm
[1:02:10] not mistaken and pull him so he's right

[1:06:35] that we win
[1:06:36] and so uh we're resting amen
[1:06:39] in that faith so tonight in matthew
[1:06:42] chapter 13 i'm going to actually pick up
[1:06:45] brother stephen i believe
[1:06:46] on something i had
[1:06:50] started into last time and just
[1:06:52] as is normally the case when there's a
[1:06:54] really good pull
[1:06:55] we didn't get to quite to the end so
[1:06:57] we're just going to
[1:06:59] move in the direction i believe the lord
[1:07:00] is leading
[1:07:01] and
[1:07:03] we trust he'll you know we can read
[1:07:04] these words
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:07] but it takes the holy spirit to bring
[1:07:09] the true you know the miracle at
[1:07:11] pentecost
[1:07:13] was that god was speaking
[1:07:15] and god was hearing amen
[1:07:19] because he was speaking through the lips
[1:07:22] of mortals
[1:07:23] and then others were hearing
[1:07:26] what god was saying
[1:07:29] and so it was god giving the speaking
[1:07:31] and god giving the hearing
[1:07:34] when that takes place
[1:07:36] it doesn't matter your background your
[1:07:38] tribe your nation your language your
[1:07:40] tongue what happened through the day
[1:07:43] none of that matters because the holy
[1:07:45] spirit is giving divine action
[1:07:48] and you're hearing the spirit speak
[1:07:51] through the vessel and you're not even
[1:07:53] hearing the man or seeing the man you're
[1:07:55] hearing and seeing god
[1:07:57] amen you know brother branham said we
[1:07:58] see god in his creation we see god in
[1:08:01] his word we see god in christ and we see
[1:08:04] god in one another
[1:08:06] that's the hardest thing to do is to see
[1:08:09] god in one another
[1:08:10] and to see god
[1:08:12] in you
[1:08:14] but
[1:08:15] with time we realize
[1:08:17] god has a body
[1:08:20] and he has a ministry
[1:08:22] and god is speaking and god is hearing
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] so tonight in matthew 13 verse 24
[1:08:29] uh actually i want to uh let me get my
[1:08:33] notes here i'm i'm a real scrambled up
[1:08:35] preacher after 20-something years you'd
[1:08:37] think i'd know how to preach
[1:08:38] but i don't
[1:08:39] if he doesn't preach they know preaching
[1:08:41] going to get done
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:44] i'll just go off the memory here matthew
[1:08:46] 13. i know you said under a great
[1:08:48] ministry of teaching
[1:08:49] and preaching a dynamic teaching i might
[1:08:52] add teaching that won't put you to sleep
[1:08:55] but it'll keep you awake
[1:08:57] because it's the awakening of the bride
[1:09:01] just before we read let's go to him in
[1:09:03] prayer heavenly father
[1:09:05] we're looking to you now
[1:09:07] to break the bread of life
[1:09:09] to give thee speaking
[1:09:10] and to give us hearing
[1:09:12] bless the remaining portion of this
[1:09:14] service lord and may you be glorified
[1:09:17] all that is said and done that's our
[1:09:19] desire tonight
[1:09:20] in jesus christ's name we ask amen
[1:09:23] matthew 13
[1:09:25] verse 1 the same day went jesus out of
[1:09:27] the house and sat by the seaside
[1:09:31] and great multitudes now notice this is
[1:09:34] multitudes were gathered together unto
[1:09:37] him so that he went into a ship and sat
[1:09:40] and the whole multitude stood on the
[1:09:42] shore
[1:09:43] all right let's go down to verse
[1:09:46] 10.
[1:09:47] and
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:49] disciples
[1:09:50] now these weren't multitude
[1:09:53] these were chosen
[1:09:54] men
[1:09:55] followers
[1:09:57] partakers
[1:09:59] and the disciples came and said unto him
[1:10:02] why speaketh thou unto them
[1:10:05] in parables
[1:10:08] he answered and said unto them because
[1:10:11] it is given unto you
[1:10:14] to know the mysteries
[1:10:17] of the kingdom of heaven
[1:10:20] but to them
[1:10:21] it is not given
[1:10:23] i just can't help myself
[1:10:25] i heard a man say one time there's no
[1:10:27] power in the mystery
[1:10:33] i thought well you sure would have had a
[1:10:35] hard time convincing mary of that
[1:10:41] because in her womb was a mystery
[1:10:45] that had the power
[1:10:48] to reclaim
[1:10:49] the world that he had created
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] unto you
[1:10:57] it is given
[1:10:59] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:11:01] heaven but to them
[1:11:02] is not given
[1:11:04] let's move to verse 24 another parable
[1:11:06] putting forth unto them saying
[1:11:08] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:11:10] man
[1:11:11] which sowed good seed in his field
[1:11:16] but while men slept
[1:11:18] his enemy came and sowed tares among the
[1:11:22] wheat
[1:11:23] and went his way
[1:11:24] but when the blade was sprung up and
[1:11:26] brought forth fruit
[1:11:28] then appeared the tares also
[1:11:31] so the servants of the householder came
[1:11:33] and said unto him sir
[1:11:35] did not thou sow good seed in thy field
[1:11:39] from whence then hath it tares this is
[1:11:42] where i get my subject for tonight and
[1:11:44] he said unto them an enemy
[1:11:49] hath done
[1:11:50] this
[1:11:52] an enemy
[1:11:53] hath done
[1:11:55] this
[1:11:56] the servant said unto him wilt thou then
[1:11:58] that we go and gather them up
[1:12:01] but he said nay
[1:12:03] lest while ye gather up the tares
[1:12:06] ye root up also the wheat with them
[1:12:12] let both grow together
[1:12:15] until the harvest
[1:12:18] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[1:12:21] the five-fold ministry
[1:12:25] i will say to the reapers
[1:12:28] plural
[1:12:30] gather ye together now
[1:12:32] the first ministry this commission is
[1:12:34] given to is a denominational
[1:12:38] ministry
[1:12:41] christ has a fifo ministry
[1:12:43] and satan has a counterfeit
[1:12:49] but they're all serving a role
[1:12:51] that accomplishes the end
[1:12:54] desire
[1:12:56] of the owner of the field
[1:13:02] just when the devil thinks he's pulling
[1:13:04] a trick
[1:13:05] all he's doing is opening the way
[1:13:08] for god's glory to be manifested in a
[1:13:11] greater way
[1:13:13] i will say to the reapers i will say to
[1:13:15] billy graham i will say to oral roberts
[1:13:18] i will say to the charismatics i will
[1:13:20] say to the catholics i'll say to the all
[1:13:23] of these coalition
[1:13:26] of religions
[1:13:29] gather ye
[1:13:31] together first
[1:13:34] the tares
[1:13:36] and bind them in bundles have we ever
[1:13:40] lived in a time of bundling
[1:13:43] spectrum wants you to bundle verizon
[1:13:45] wants you to bundle everybody's wanting
[1:13:47] to bundle their package where do they
[1:13:49] get this inspiration
[1:13:52] gather you together first the tears and
[1:13:53] bind them in bundles to burn them
[1:13:56] but gather the wheat
[1:13:59] into my
[1:14:01] barn
[1:14:03] amen may the lord add his blessings to
[1:14:05] the ring you may be seated the reading
[1:14:07] of his word
[1:14:08] amen an enemy have done this so i think
[1:14:11] last time i had dealt with just the uh
[1:14:14] the battle that began in heaven
[1:14:17] came to the earth in eden
[1:14:19] and resumed
[1:14:22] uh the warfare the the battle that's
[1:14:24] that lucifer lost in heaven came to the
[1:14:28] earth where for six thousand years he
[1:14:30] continues to lose
[1:14:33] but
[1:14:34] in the little victory he gained in eden
[1:14:37] he did obtain a 6 000 year
[1:14:41] lease
[1:14:45] on the earth
[1:14:46] because the title deed
[1:14:48] went back to the hands of the original
[1:14:51] owner
[1:14:53] so the devil has 6 000 years
[1:14:56] to take up god's dare
[1:14:59] that in that six thousand year period of
[1:15:01] time
[1:15:02] he must achieve global domination
[1:15:07] and garner the worship and the adoration
[1:15:10] of all of humanity
[1:15:14] they must worship him as god
[1:15:16] with no exception
[1:15:18] no man woman boy or child is exempted
[1:15:22] from this they all must bow and give him
[1:15:25] worship
[1:15:26] if they do not
[1:15:27] the lease is revoked
[1:15:30] the original owner takes the title deed
[1:15:32] back
[1:15:33] exterminates
[1:15:36] what was never his family
[1:15:39] and those who never accepted
[1:15:41] his offer of grace and redemption
[1:15:48] amen
[1:15:51] if you go to hell it's because you
[1:15:53] fought your way to get there
[1:15:56] you stepped right over the grace of
[1:15:58] jesus christ the bloody shed at calvary
[1:16:01] the sanctifying and holy spirit power of
[1:16:05] the holy ghost
[1:16:06] you're going to fight your way to heaven
[1:16:08] or you're going to fight your way to
[1:16:10] hell
[1:16:11] either way
[1:16:12] you're going to one place or the other
[1:16:14] and if you get to heaven it'll be by his
[1:16:16] grace
[1:16:17] and if you go to hell it'll be you
[1:16:19] fought over his grace to get there
[1:16:26] amen amen
[1:16:28] the devil doesn't have ownership
[1:16:31] he's got a lease
[1:16:33] but at the end of the period amen god's
[1:16:36] going to call the lien back he's going
[1:16:38] to call back and say you never achieved
[1:16:40] you know who's standing in the way
[1:16:45] a little remnant
[1:16:47] a little handful of people
[1:16:49] because he's been exposed in this hour
[1:16:54] satan has been exposed amen a stone was
[1:16:57] cut out of the mountain without hands
[1:16:59] and it does little stone smothy image in
[1:17:02] the feet
[1:17:03] oh my and in the place of that image
[1:17:06] comes up a great mountain
[1:17:09] a pyramid amen the city the habitation
[1:17:12] of the lord our god we are his temple we
[1:17:16] are his habitation and we come back
[1:17:18] we're brought back amen and the kingdom
[1:17:21] is restored
[1:17:22] and satan and his subjects are perished
[1:17:25] in the lake of fire that was created for
[1:17:27] them
[1:17:29] amen because there's no redemption for
[1:17:31] angels
[1:17:32] redemption is only for human beings
[1:17:35] and those those angels influence will be
[1:17:37] perished and be lost but those who were
[1:17:40] influenced
[1:17:42] by the mighty angel
[1:17:44] and his seven messengers that were sent
[1:17:47] to seven gentile church ages
[1:17:49] the message has been the same in every
[1:17:51] age come out of her my people
[1:17:54] in paul's day it was come out of the
[1:17:56] orthodox church come out of the just a
[1:18:00] judaic religion amen amen and in all
[1:18:03] ages it was come out of a
[1:18:06] church
[1:18:07] carnal
[1:18:08] or a church corporate and come into the
[1:18:11] church spiritual oh my the royal seed of
[1:18:15] abraham amen join the real original
[1:18:18] family amen and in the seventh age once
[1:18:22] again he comes and cries come out of her
[1:18:24] my people
[1:18:26] come out of the pentecostal denomination
[1:18:29] come out of catholicism come out of
[1:18:32] every man-made religion and walk in the
[1:18:35] full brilliance of the light of the
[1:18:37] revealed word of the hour
[1:18:39] come in to christ
[1:18:42] an exodus consists of a coming out of
[1:18:44] and going into
[1:18:46] and many will perish in the middle
[1:18:49] oh my but out of the thousands that came
[1:18:52] out
[1:18:53] under the seventh angel's message
[1:18:55] there's a small remnant
[1:18:57] that's not satisfied to circle the
[1:18:59] mountain
[1:19:00] but they're going into christ
[1:19:03] amen they're they're fighting their way
[1:19:06] into christ they're not satisfied in the
[1:19:09] wilderness amen they're not satisfied
[1:19:11] with a temporary temple
[1:19:13] oh my it represents a permanent dwelling
[1:19:16] place christ embodying himself in a
[1:19:19] believer
[1:19:20] and as they receive the revealed word of
[1:19:22] the hour they become his habitation
[1:19:26] oh my so friends of battle still going
[1:19:28] on tonight
[1:19:30] and we're right in the middle of it
[1:19:32] we're right in the warfare
[1:19:34] praise the lord and i got a problem with
[1:19:36] this ipad it likes to go to sleep after
[1:19:38] so many minutes
[1:19:41] it's like some layer of scenes
[1:19:43] if you don't keep
[1:19:45] exciting yet it falls asleep
[1:19:51] i'm glad we don't have any of those here
[1:19:53] tonight
[1:19:54] all the laodiceans found somewhere else
[1:19:56] to go to church or or they're already
[1:19:58] asleep but let's get into the lesson for
[1:20:00] just a moment here a man owns a field
[1:20:04] he's got a desire for that field
[1:20:07] amen he's got a handful of little wheat
[1:20:10] and he wants to multiply it
[1:20:13] into a field full
[1:20:15] of the same
[1:20:16] species amen so he goes and his uh his
[1:20:20] his servants sow this wheat seed if you
[1:20:23] will into the field
[1:20:25] and while they are resting while they
[1:20:28] are sleeping
[1:20:29] amen the enemy comes in and sows a
[1:20:32] strange seed
[1:20:34] a seed of discrepancy
[1:20:36] a seed that's 99.9 percent truth
[1:20:40] but it's got just enough error
[1:20:43] to deceive everybody except the elect
[1:20:47] so at night time he sows this seed and
[1:20:50] then days later or whenever the tears
[1:20:52] come
[1:20:53] the blades spring up and these laborers
[1:20:56] realize
[1:20:58] there's two seeds
[1:21:00] in the one field
[1:21:02] and something must be done
[1:21:04] so they're inexperienced they're not
[1:21:06] masters of the harvest they're not the
[1:21:08] lord they're not the owner they're just
[1:21:09] laborers even like ministers we don't
[1:21:12] own you
[1:21:13] we're your servants amen hired by christ
[1:21:17] amen we give an account to him for your
[1:21:19] souls amen so we don't own you amen
[1:21:23] we're just we're just working for him to
[1:21:25] help you
[1:21:27] amen so they come back with this idea
[1:21:29] hey we'll just destroy
[1:21:32] the work of the enemy right now we'll
[1:21:35] eradicate
[1:21:37] all the serpent seed
[1:21:39] all the false seed all the foolish
[1:21:40] virgins whatever we just get it all out
[1:21:42] of the field and he goes no
[1:21:45] i'm not willing to risk harm
[1:21:48] or injury
[1:21:50] to even one
[1:21:52] of the least
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:55] of those wheat seeds that i planted
[1:21:57] there
[1:21:58] so to avoid injury to even one of them
[1:22:02] we're going to water them both
[1:22:04] we're going to fertilize them both
[1:22:06] we're going to pour out nutrients on
[1:22:08] both of them we're going to care for
[1:22:10] both of them we're going to nurture both
[1:22:12] of them until
[1:22:15] until full maturity
[1:22:18] and full fruition
[1:22:19] and that comes at the end of the seventh
[1:22:22] church age
[1:22:24] when the seeds that were sown amen by
[1:22:26] the reformers
[1:22:28] or the seeds that were sown by
[1:22:29] denominational sowers
[1:22:32] amen uh pardon me for saying billy
[1:22:34] graham and noah roberts but they sowed
[1:22:36] seeds and my what a crop they've had
[1:22:40] they've had a crop of fundamentalists
[1:22:43] they've had a crop of charismatics
[1:22:45] they've had a crop of independent
[1:22:47] movements amen that are
[1:22:49] anti-establishment and
[1:22:51] anti-denominational
[1:22:52] and anti-god
[1:22:55] they scream they shout they have
[1:22:57] emotions they have a disco ball they
[1:22:59] have music they have entertainment they
[1:23:01] tell people come as you were and leave
[1:23:03] as you are and you're okay and you're
[1:23:05] going to hell
[1:23:10] the gospel tells you you're a sinner
[1:23:13] on your way to satan's hell because you
[1:23:15] were born in sin shaping an iniquity and
[1:23:18] you need a savior you need to be
[1:23:20] justified sanctified and filled with the
[1:23:24] spirit of god
[1:23:26] god's not waiting for your approval
[1:23:29] you waiting on god's approval
[1:23:31] the baptism of the holy ghost is not
[1:23:34] something that you can manufacture it's
[1:23:37] not something that you can work up it's
[1:23:39] not something that stimulates your
[1:23:41] emotions although it will do that amen
[1:23:44] you don't produce it
[1:23:46] you stand there and waiting in faith
[1:23:49] knowing you have put everything under
[1:23:50] the blood you are justified sanctified
[1:23:53] and the word is washing you
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:59] until he says
[1:24:01] they're ready
[1:24:02] put the stamp on them
[1:24:05] feel them with the spirit of god set
[1:24:07] them on fire give them a commission give
[1:24:10] them a placing give them power give them
[1:24:13] authority
[1:24:17] i'm going to tag on what you said
[1:24:18] brother some of these people trying to
[1:24:20] cast out every devil in the name of
[1:24:22] jesus christ i adjure thee in the name
[1:24:24] of jesus christ come out of them satan
[1:24:26] come out up say not kick you out i'll
[1:24:28] kick you out i cast you up who are you
[1:24:30] trying to fool

[1:24:35] much less the devil
[1:24:40] hello church
[1:24:43] jesus never had to cast out a demon in
[1:24:46] the name of jesus christ
[1:24:48] he knew who he was
[1:24:52] he said come out of him satan
[1:24:55] when the life of jesus christ is living
[1:24:57] itself through you you don't need a
[1:24:59] patch
[1:25:01] that says message believer you don't
[1:25:03] need a boy scout badge that says
[1:25:06] pastor stephen is my pastor you don't

[1:25:12] lapel pin that says vog
[1:25:15] or jeffersonville or cloverdale or
[1:25:18] tennessee or gastonia
[1:25:22] that's what man gives you
[1:25:24] to give you a brand and a label
[1:25:27] to associate you with a man's kingdom
[1:25:30] when god gives you his step of approval
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:34] the devil will recognize you from 10
[1:25:37] miles away
[1:25:44] he'll tell those devils there's a
[1:25:46] manifested son
[1:25:48] don't ever go with him alone
[1:25:50] take back up
[1:25:51] take reinforcements

[1:25:55] son and daughter of god right there

[1:26:00] flesh
[1:26:01] in laodicea

[1:26:05] have to wear

[1:26:20] this divided fellowship
[1:26:24] on churches
[1:26:26] pastors
[1:26:27] personalities
[1:26:29] ministries an enemy has done this
[1:26:34] it's satan trying to divide the body of
[1:26:38] jesus christ
[1:26:39] by creating a cap
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:43] around the man
[1:26:45] around a building
[1:26:46] around a ministry that circles the globe
[1:26:50] which this influence
[1:26:54] hello
[1:26:55] an enemy
[1:26:57] hath done this
[1:27:00] i know the devil don't like it
[1:27:03] i wouldn't either if i was him
[1:27:06] but the bride loves it
[1:27:12] because an enemy
[1:27:14] is bundling his tares
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] and they're saying come join up with us

[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:36] i want to give the devil a thumbs down
[1:27:38] tonight
[1:27:40] i don't like you devil
[1:27:42] i don't have no time for your nonsense
[1:27:45] i don't subscribe to you
[1:27:48] the whole reason we got the problems we
[1:27:50] got in the world today is because eve
[1:27:54] subscribed
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:27:59] she gave the devil five minutes of her
[1:28:01] time
[1:28:04] and he told her what he could do
[1:28:07] eve i can give you a revelation
[1:28:10] i can explain
[1:28:12] i'm just gonna preach i can explain the
[1:28:16] mystery to you eve
[1:28:19] in a way that adam cannot
[1:28:22] and she said if you can
[1:28:25] i will
[1:28:33] it's based on works
[1:28:36] if you can
[1:28:38] demonstrate it
[1:28:40] if you can manufacture it
[1:28:42] if you can build it
[1:28:44] if you can impress
[1:28:47] then i'll get on board
[1:28:50] god doesn't come to his bride and say if
[1:28:52] i can
[1:28:55] because that's a premise that's built on
[1:28:57] doubt
[1:28:59] if
[1:29:01] is a doubt
[1:29:03] if is a statement of doubt
[1:29:08] god don't say if i can
[1:29:10] will you
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:16] i'm gonna ask you a question tonight
[1:29:18] are you serving god for what you think
[1:29:20] he might do for you
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:31] are you serving god for the benefits
[1:29:34] that you think he's hanging out in front
[1:29:36] of you like you attract a mule with a
[1:29:40] carrot on a stick
[1:29:45] god don't work that way
[1:29:51] god offers you
[1:29:54] he says i already have
[1:29:58] it's done
[1:29:59] it's finished
[1:30:01] it's determined
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:08] will you
[1:30:11] will you
[1:30:13] will you be my wife
[1:30:15] will you be the extension
[1:30:18] of who i am
[1:30:20] will you accept
[1:30:22] my offer
[1:30:24] he's a gentleman
[1:30:26] he's not there to display
[1:30:28] something in hopes
[1:30:30] of winning you
[1:30:32] he knows if you are the true bride
[1:30:35] you'll be attracted by the character
[1:30:39] of who he is
[1:30:41] and the revelation of what he's already
[1:30:45] done
[1:30:47] and he says
[1:30:49] will you
[1:30:51] say
[1:30:52] i do
[1:30:56] i do believe lord
[1:30:59] you don't have to know
[1:31:01] how he's going to do it
[1:31:04] you don't have to know when he's going
[1:31:06] to do it
[1:31:07] you don't have to wonder if
[1:31:10] he's going to do it
[1:31:13] you know
[1:31:14] if he's asking it's because he already
[1:31:17] knows the answers
[1:31:20] to his own questions
[1:31:24] and if he's asking you
[1:31:25] it's because he wants you to say i do
[1:31:30] and i will lord i will follow you
[1:31:33] i will live for you i will sacrifice
[1:31:36] everything i'll rip off every other
[1:31:38] token
[1:31:40] every other engagement
[1:31:43] every other commitment
[1:31:44] every other opportunity i'll lay it all
[1:31:47] aside
[1:31:52] and he says
[1:31:53] that's what i thought you would say
[1:32:00] amen
[1:32:03] glory glory glory god knows the end from
[1:32:07] the beginning
[1:32:09] amen
[1:32:13] when god picks up clay
[1:32:16] he's done got a vessel
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:25] he did not pick you up to examine you
[1:32:29] and try to determine
[1:32:31] if you were suitable
[1:32:34] for the intent and the purpose
[1:32:37] that he had envisioned
[1:32:39] he picked you up because
[1:32:43] god has no wasted motion or efforts
[1:32:47] and because he picked you up
[1:32:50] it's because he has confidence
[1:32:54] in his own choice
[1:32:56] that can never fail
[1:32:58] he that began a good work in you
[1:33:01] will be faithful
[1:33:02] to perform it until the day of jesus
[1:33:07] christ
[1:33:08] full maturity
[1:33:11] full maturity christ
[1:33:13] being birthed and born
[1:33:15] and brought to maturity and adoption
[1:33:18] in a many-membered body
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:23] i do lord
[1:33:25] i do believe
[1:33:27] i do believe
[1:33:28] he didn't say do you understand it
[1:33:32] he didn't say can you explain it
[1:33:37] he says
[1:33:38] if you do
[1:33:40] i will
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:45] we have works
[1:33:47] based
[1:33:48] religions
[1:33:50] because an enemy
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:53] have done this
[1:33:56] and then we have the predestination
[1:33:59] folks
[1:34:00] that like to lie over there and rest
[1:34:05] they don't have one speck
[1:34:08] of dirt on them
[1:34:12] no faults
[1:34:14] no failures no
[1:34:16] blemishes no shame
[1:34:20] they're predestinated
[1:34:26] it's like they talk about the difference
[1:34:28] in value between the male brain
[1:34:31] and the female brain
[1:34:33] the male brain costs a whole lot more
[1:34:40] not because it's altogether worth more
[1:34:43] just because the female brain is much
[1:34:46] more used
[1:34:51] so these
[1:34:53] predestinated christians
[1:34:55] are so perfect
[1:34:58] they know all the scriptures
[1:35:01] all the quotes
[1:35:03] oh my they're almost ashamed to get
[1:35:05] their hands dirty and show up on church
[1:35:08] workday
[1:35:12] they're
[1:35:12] predestinated
[1:35:14] they're going in the same rapture we are
[1:35:17] they're not having to do any works
[1:35:19] they've got faith
[1:35:21] they're like the pencil with an unused
[1:35:24] eraser
[1:35:28] there's no fault
[1:35:30] there's no blemish
[1:35:32] they look as good as the day they were
[1:35:34] born
[1:35:35] problem is
[1:35:36] they've never done anything
[1:35:43] but let me tell you something
[1:35:46] those people
[1:35:47] are going to be so disappointed
[1:35:53] hello church
[1:35:56] because the token given
[1:35:59] must result
[1:36:00] in a token applied
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:06] i don't care if you had a bucket of
[1:36:09] blood
[1:36:11] and you had followed the message to the
[1:36:13] letter
[1:36:14] and followed the prophet's instructions
[1:36:17] you had slayed the lamb after putting
[1:36:18] him up for the appointed time you had
[1:36:20] followed everything to the letter but if
[1:36:22] the blood was not applied
[1:36:26] somebody died
[1:36:28] and we got pristine christians
[1:36:32] that are too perfect to appreciate grace
[1:36:36] because they've never witnessed
[1:36:38] they've never fallen
[1:36:40] they've never had they've never
[1:36:42] backslidden
[1:36:43] they've never made a mistake
[1:36:45] so they don't even know the grace of god
[1:36:49] because it's never been applied
[1:36:54] hello
[1:36:56] hello
[1:36:57] i want to be an applied christian
[1:37:01] i want to be the kind of christian that
[1:37:03] doesn't have to sit in a crystal case
[1:37:06] up on the top shelf for the world to
[1:37:09] admire as the bride of jesus christ
[1:37:12] i want to be a christian
[1:37:14] that has power amongst the coworkers
[1:37:18] and the classmates
[1:37:20] and the factory worker and the lost
[1:37:23] companion
[1:37:25] and the children that need a real god
[1:37:27] because they're facing a real devil
[1:37:30] and they're tired of fake
[1:37:33] tired of philosophy
[1:37:36] they're tired a man of recipes
[1:37:42] i'm gonna say it brother
[1:37:45] this is the
[1:37:46] recipe this is the cake
[1:37:50] you put this
[1:37:52] and apply the token and let the holy
[1:37:55] spirit mix up your life
[1:37:59] and you get the living bread
[1:38:01] the living manner the word made flesh
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:11] yes sir brother
[1:38:14] jesus gave his disciples power over
[1:38:17] unclean spirits they healed the sick
[1:38:19] they cast out devils the dead were
[1:38:21] raised and legion was brought back from
[1:38:23] the tombs
[1:38:25] he commanded his disciples terry in
[1:38:27] jerusalem until you are endured a
[1:38:29] powerful night
[1:38:32] they come out of the upper room
[1:38:34] staggering under the dynamic power
[1:38:37] of jesus christ
[1:38:39] applied life
[1:38:43] and they did not go back to the temple
[1:38:46] and start a debate
[1:38:53] they didn't start a new youtube channel
[1:38:56] to defy and counter all the critics of
[1:39:00] the message
[1:39:06] they come out of the upper room
[1:39:08] and the world said what meant
[1:39:10] this and the word spoke
[1:39:14] and said these men are not drunk as you
[1:39:16] suppose see it is but the third hour of
[1:39:18] the day but this
[1:39:20] is that
[1:39:22] the living bread the living word the
[1:39:25] applied token this is that that the
[1:39:28] prophet joel spoke of
[1:39:30] i'll pour out my
[1:39:32] spirit
[1:39:33] upon all flesh
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:37] and the prophet of god said the devil
[1:39:40] never even moved out of his bed
[1:39:43] until
[1:39:44] they went walking down to the gate
[1:39:46] called beautiful
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:52] oh my where a lame man
[1:39:55] had been crippled
[1:39:57] and he'd had handouts
[1:40:00] he did he'd been given tracts
[1:40:02] he'd been offered memberships
[1:40:04] he'd been offered incentives to come
[1:40:07] join
[1:40:08] or to lure him away from one church into
[1:40:11] another church
[1:40:12] or from one ministry into another
[1:40:14] ministry
[1:40:15] he had been offered all kinds of
[1:40:18] incentives
[1:40:20] and on this day
[1:40:22] his expectations
[1:40:24] have been reduced to believing that's
[1:40:27] all he would ever get
[1:40:29] was a little financial
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:36] and if you'll accept that
[1:40:38] that's all you'll ever get
[1:40:41] if you'll settle for the devil's
[1:40:43] counterfeit
[1:40:46] that's all you'll ever
[1:40:48] get
[1:40:51] but on this day
[1:40:53] he met the word applied
[1:40:58] he said i don't need
[1:41:01] the wallet
[1:41:04] i don't need
[1:41:05] an income

[1:41:17] i don't need a club i don't need a
[1:41:19] society i don't need a support group
[1:41:23] i don't need a i don't need a
[1:41:24] psychiatrist
[1:41:26] i don't need philosophy
[1:41:29] such
[1:41:30] as i have
[1:41:33] give i unto thee in the name of jesus
[1:41:36] christ of nazareth rise up
[1:41:39] and
[1:41:40] walk

[1:41:47] of your seat
[1:41:49] of self-pity
[1:41:52] and government dependence
[1:41:55] and believing in some political party or
[1:41:57] some administration in the white house
[1:41:59] that's going to give you anything
[1:42:03] every good gift

[1:42:48] the devil's bondage
[1:42:50] brother tim i'm just
[1:42:52] waiting on my ship to come in
[1:42:57] oh brother tim if you knew my condition

[1:43:07] your condition
[1:43:09] is not your problem

[1:43:17] of a deeper
[1:43:19] underlying issue
[1:43:21] that will result in a fatality
[1:43:28] the problem is the mindset
[1:43:33] so you started thinking the way your
[1:43:36] adversary an enemy had done this
[1:43:40] he planted a tear in your mind
[1:43:44] and you started accepting your condition
[1:43:49] and he says your daddy had it your mama
[1:43:51] had it your aunt had it it was put on
[1:43:54] you
[1:43:55] it was projected on you
[1:43:57] that's a lie from the pits of hell
[1:44:01] it come from the devil and you can put
[1:44:03] it back on his head
[1:44:08] you are not a victim
[1:44:12] you are not
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:14] hallelujah

[1:44:22] you recognize your sonship
[1:44:25] and your relationship to the almighty
[1:44:27] god
[1:44:29] and the day you recognize that
[1:44:31] the devil's in trouble because you don't
[1:44:35] have to scream
[1:44:36] you don't have to shout you don't have
[1:44:38] to get on facebook
[1:44:40] you can go to the source
[1:44:43] and say god
[1:44:44] i need you right now
[1:44:47] and when you get up
[1:44:51] i'm going to hit this one while i'm
[1:44:53] having fun
[1:44:57] brother tim
[1:44:59] i'm just going to go home
[1:45:01] and i'm going to send my tithes
[1:45:04] up to headquarters
[1:45:07] and i'm waiting
[1:45:09] on the prophet to return
[1:45:13] so the vision
[1:45:15] the vision
[1:45:16] can then
[1:45:18] unfold
[1:45:21] and i want to be in
[1:45:23] that fulfillment
[1:45:28] okay if that's what you want
[1:45:32] i hope you're not disappointed
[1:45:36] with the outcome
[1:45:39] may i remind you
[1:45:42] of a little woman
[1:45:44] who had a son
[1:45:46] dying
[1:45:48] from a venereal disease
[1:45:52] he had contracted
[1:45:54] as a result of a sinful lifestyle
[1:45:59] but he had a godly
[1:46:01] mother
[1:46:04] that had a connection
[1:46:08] [Applause]
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:13] satan's given you a path uh satan's
[1:46:16] given you a path of destruction
[1:46:18] god's speaking to somebody tonight
[1:46:21] you'll never convince me
[1:46:23] that god didn't tailor this service for
[1:46:25] somebody
[1:46:30] god's prophet
[1:46:33] was on a journey
[1:46:35] and on a mission
[1:46:37] and he had a point of origin and he had
[1:46:39] a destination
[1:46:42] but some mother
[1:46:44] started praying
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:48] don't think
[1:46:49] you're a victim
[1:46:52] don't think all the storms
[1:46:54] and all the trials and all the currents
[1:46:57] and all the dissuasion
[1:46:59] is a result
[1:47:01] of satan's
[1:47:03] doings
[1:47:04] remember he's operating
[1:47:07] under
[1:47:09] a lease
[1:47:13] all his power
[1:47:15] was given to him
[1:47:17] temporarily to exercise
[1:47:20] his trickery
[1:47:25] so here was a woman that had a
[1:47:27] connection
[1:47:30] plane comes down
[1:47:32] in a storm
[1:47:33] is grounded overnight
[1:47:36] and god's prophet is there in memphis
[1:47:39] tennessee
[1:47:40] an unplanned
[1:47:42] stop
[1:47:44] an interruption
[1:47:48] don't tell me that prophet of god wasn't
[1:47:51] following a vision
[1:47:53] that god had ordained for his life
[1:47:55] but the vision
[1:47:57] amen had
[1:48:01] a little hickey
[1:48:06] a little space of time
[1:48:10] that is not the end of eternity
[1:48:13] it's just a brief pause
[1:48:15] and he's walking down the street
[1:48:18] i'm so glad that i can say
[1:48:21] one of them
[1:48:22] the holy spirit says turn right here
[1:48:26] but i got letters to mail i've got a bri
[1:48:28] you know i got a flight again turn right
[1:48:30] here

[1:48:35] he's walking away
[1:48:38] from the airport
[1:48:42] he's walking away
[1:48:44] from his only way out
[1:48:49] he's not walking in his own vision
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:55] he walks down the street he sees a lady
[1:48:57] leaning over the fence
[1:49:00] moaning parson
[1:49:03] how did you know i was a person
[1:49:08] now who was having a vision
[1:49:13] you're waiting on brother branham to
[1:49:14] come back
[1:49:16] brother branham and all the saints of
[1:49:18] ages past might just be waiting on you
[1:49:24] to realize who you are and get a
[1:49:28] connection with god
[1:49:30] and get a revelation
[1:49:33] if i'm that shunamite woman
[1:49:35] you got a prophet somewhere and he was
[1:49:38] walking into her vision
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:44] where are we at church
[1:49:46] we're not waiting on brother branham
[1:49:49] they without us
[1:49:51] cannot be made complete
[1:49:54] oh my
[1:49:58] yeah
[1:49:59] you need a vision
[1:50:01] brother ben said one
[1:50:02] planet out of order
[1:50:04] would throw the entire solar system and
[1:50:06] he said one believer out of their
[1:50:08] position
[1:50:09] paralyzes
[1:50:11] the whole program of god
[1:50:15] when you recognize your position who you
[1:50:18] are where you stand
[1:50:20] we're going to rock the devil's world
[1:50:23] right out of orbit amen
[1:50:26] hallelujah
[1:50:29] he walked in that lady's home
[1:50:32] he saw a picture of jesus christ he said
[1:50:34] i knew i was in a christian home
[1:50:37] said ma'am
[1:50:39] would you pray
[1:50:47] why don't you try it
[1:50:51] why don't you get on your knees
[1:50:54] and pray
[1:50:56] oh but brother tim i got a schedule to
[1:50:59] keep
[1:51:00] i got a job i got these kids i got this
[1:51:05] i got this get together i got this
[1:51:07] birthday party i got this church
[1:51:09] function i got this church of it oh i
[1:51:10] gotta go go go
[1:51:12] you're trying to put god on your
[1:51:14] schedule
[1:51:20] why don't you stop your schedule and say
[1:51:22] god i'm on your time now
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:29] the prophet said you pray
[1:51:32] and when she began to pray
[1:51:35] he felt the anointing he felt the spirit
[1:51:37] of god and he realized his purpose
[1:51:41] he realized
[1:51:42] his purpose
[1:51:44] as a result of her prayer and her
[1:51:48] determination
[1:51:49] and her unyielding resolve
[1:51:53] i'm not going to let my child die as a
[1:51:57] victim
[1:51:58] of a venereal disease that he contracted
[1:52:01] as a result of sinful living
[1:52:03] how many people would have resigned
[1:52:06] to the doctor's diagnosis
[1:52:09] but she caught a revelation
[1:52:11] and that revelation did not put her on a
[1:52:14] pillow of predestination
[1:52:16] it put her on her knees
[1:52:18] saying god if i am who you tell me i am
[1:52:22] then you send the prophet
[1:52:24] that i know
[1:52:26] if i'm here then he's got to be
[1:52:28] somewhere close by
[1:52:31] hello church
[1:52:32] when you get in your position the
[1:52:34] prophet will be less than six feet away
[1:52:38] in another dimension
[1:52:40] waiting to rejoin you in this dimension
[1:52:43] in a glorified condition and for 40 days
[1:52:46] we will congregate together before we
[1:52:49] meet the lord in the air
[1:52:52] amen
[1:52:55] praise the lord
[1:52:57] oh how i love jesus
[1:53:00] praise the lord
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:03] an enemy has done this
[1:53:05] the tares the false seeds
[1:53:08] the weeds
[1:53:09] they're not just sown into the church
[1:53:12] they're sown into humanity and they're
[1:53:14] sown into you
[1:53:17] god's going to save you
[1:53:19] fill you with the spirit
[1:53:21] his spirit and spend the rest of your
[1:53:23] life
[1:53:24] plucking weeds
[1:53:26] ideas thoughts
[1:53:29] complexes
[1:53:31] issues
[1:53:32] genetic
[1:53:33] predispositions
[1:53:35] all of these things that got sown into
[1:53:38] humanity
[1:53:39] when satan mixed his seed
[1:53:44] you're a victim of it if you
[1:53:47] in one sense
[1:53:48] but you're a victor
[1:53:50] through christ
[1:53:52] on calvary and he's sending now
[1:53:56] reapers
[1:53:58] to say your response
[1:54:01] to the revealed word of the hour
[1:54:04] testifies to whether you are a terror or
[1:54:08] a wheat
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:12] because the tares are genetically
[1:54:15] predisposed to like denominational
[1:54:19] structure
[1:54:26] they got to feel like they belong to
[1:54:28] something big
[1:54:31] they got to feel recognition they like
[1:54:34] the united nations approval they like
[1:54:37] the ecumenical council of churches they
[1:54:40] want to feel like they're being embraced
[1:54:43] by other religions
[1:54:46] with similar views but differing
[1:54:49] convictions
[1:54:51] and a tare says i will gladly
[1:54:54] join
[1:54:57] and the wheat says
[1:55:03] if i have to stand alone
[1:55:05] if i had to be by myself
[1:55:08] if i had to be on the back side of the
[1:55:10] desert no family no believers no friends
[1:55:14] no associations if i have to be like
[1:55:16] daniel and the three hebrew children
[1:55:19] i'm not going to compromise for approval
[1:55:23] friendship
[1:55:25] friendship that is based on compromise
[1:55:27] is not friendship
[1:55:32] it's fraudship
[1:55:37] it's not friendship it's not love it's
[1:55:39] lust
[1:55:41] it's pity oh i love him brother tim i'm
[1:55:43] gonna i'm gonna make a real man at him
[1:55:45] quit pitying him
[1:55:47] if you love him tell him you get filled
[1:55:49] with the holy ghost you become a son of
[1:55:51] god and if you then love me as much as
[1:55:54] you love god we'll think about
[1:55:57] we'll think about it but until you get
[1:55:59] to an old-fashioned altar and you get
[1:56:01] filled with the holy ghost
[1:56:03] you can't reform cigarettes away from
[1:56:05] him you're not going to take away the
[1:56:07] desire to be in the pool halls and the
[1:56:09] booze joints and running around with the
[1:56:11] skimpy girls
[1:56:15] hello
[1:56:17] you want a husband
[1:56:19] or do you want a liability for the rest
[1:56:22] of your living years
[1:56:24] if you want a husband
[1:56:26] go to god and say god i'm standing right
[1:56:28] here until you send me a holy
[1:56:31] ghost-filled husband
[1:56:35] and until he does you tell every serpent
[1:56:38] no
[1:56:40] i'd have no time i have no ear
[1:56:43] i have no interest
[1:56:46] i'm already taken
[1:56:52] i'm already spoken for
[1:56:57] that was free
[1:57:00] an enemy had done this
[1:57:04] sickness disease
[1:57:06] viruses
[1:57:09] it
[1:57:10] i tell you what now our problem is not
[1:57:12] covered
[1:57:13] our problem is all the opinions that
[1:57:15] surround the covet
[1:57:20] hey is god god
[1:57:22] is god in control
[1:57:24] is god greater than any sickness
[1:57:26] and any disease and any virus any
[1:57:29] affliction hey i'm not saying go cough
[1:57:31] and sneeze on each other
[1:57:35] i wouldn't do that to a healthy person
[1:57:38] but i'm not going to let a little bit of
[1:57:39] fear
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:42] interrupt my connection
[1:57:47] they said it's a death sentence if we
[1:57:50] catch you praying to the hebrew god
[1:57:53] daniel said i'll throw the windows open
[1:57:56] and pray a little louder
[1:57:59] because you're not messing with my
[1:58:01] connection
[1:58:04] oh will he deliver you
[1:58:07] that's not the question
[1:58:11] that's a distraction
[1:58:13] whether he does
[1:58:15] or whether he does not
[1:58:18] one thing
[1:58:19] we're determined
[1:58:20] i'm not gonna bow
[1:58:23] i'm not gonna bend
[1:58:25] and i won't burn
[1:58:29] try it
[1:58:31] try it
[1:58:32] it's been tried in the fire before it's
[1:58:35] going to be tried in the fire again
[1:58:37] amen fire does not destroy gold fire
[1:58:40] proves gold fire does not destroy silver
[1:58:44] fire proves silver fire does not destroy
[1:58:47] precious material or precious metals
[1:58:50] when you go into the fire you come out
[1:58:52] refined
[1:58:53] you come out cleaner brighter shinier
[1:58:56] you reflect the image of the maker even
[1:59:00] more than you did before the fire
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:04] sin the fire lord
[1:59:07] sin the fire lord
[1:59:09] oh my
[1:59:11] burn away everything that's not like you
[1:59:13] lord
[1:59:17] oh but but
[1:59:18] but but brother tim
[1:59:24] you don't understand my situation
[1:59:29] okay friends it's hard for me to believe
[1:59:30] that after 6
[1:59:32] 000 years
[1:59:34] god needs to change
[1:59:37] his ways
[1:59:40] nothing's ever beaten
[1:59:42] nothing's ever defeated him
[1:59:44] nothing's ever deterred him
[1:59:47] or derailed his purpose
[1:59:50] in 6 000
[1:59:52] years
[1:59:54] satan has tried every
[1:59:57] thing he can think of
[2:00:00] he's the one going insane
[2:00:06] he's he's running out of plays
[2:00:09] he's running out of tactics he's running
[2:00:11] out of strategy he's running out of
[2:00:13] maneuvers
[2:00:14] and all the things that used to work
[2:00:17] don't work anymore
[2:00:22] so
[2:00:23] tension i think oh my what's this
[2:00:27] tension
[2:00:28] if i could have been born
[2:00:31] without the tension
[2:00:33] well
[2:00:34] if i wouldn't have had this tension
[2:00:39] i wouldn't have been
[2:00:41] what i am
[2:00:46] you say oh brother tim i hate friction
[2:00:51] well how many of you enjoyed driving on
[2:00:53] the ice
[2:01:03] is that the way you want to go through
[2:01:05] your life
[2:01:06] slipping and sliding around
[2:01:13] [Applause]
[2:01:15] friction
[2:01:17] helps us move somewhere
[2:01:19] and know where we were
[2:01:21] and appreciate where we are now
[2:01:23] [Applause]
[2:01:25] if i wouldn't have had this tension i
[2:01:27] wouldn't have been what i am
[2:01:29] i wouldn't have been a christian perhaps
[2:01:32] it was this tension
[2:01:34] this tension that drove me to jesus
[2:01:36] christ
[2:01:38] see it's been a blessing thing to me
[2:01:41] so then as paul said as though when he
[2:01:43] had tension or something another he had
[2:01:45] consulted the lord to take it away from
[2:01:47] him three times
[2:01:49] and the lord said saul
[2:01:52] my grace
[2:01:54] is
[2:01:55] sufficient
[2:01:59] he said then i'll glory
[2:02:01] and my
[2:02:02] infirmities then when i'm weak
[2:02:06] i'm strong
[2:02:10] god is a god of contrast
[2:02:13] as great
[2:02:15] and as powerful and as mighty and as
[2:02:17] shrewd as the devil is
[2:02:20] god is greater
[2:02:23] the contrast
[2:02:25] helps us
[2:02:26] if we can see how powerful how powerful
[2:02:29] how manipulative how shrewd what a
[2:02:32] mastermind the devil is
[2:02:34] we should appreciate god all the more
[2:02:38] because he made the devil
[2:02:42] he gave him everything he had
[2:02:44] taught him everything he knows
[2:02:46] and the devil for 6 000 years has been
[2:02:49] trying to replicate
[2:02:53] but he can never
[2:02:55] duplicate
[2:02:56] because he's an imitator
[2:03:01] he's not an inventor
[2:03:03] he's never had an original idea
[2:03:07] just a perverted
[2:03:14] if people knew what the devil was
[2:03:16] they wouldn't serve him
[2:03:18] and they'd be less fearful of him
[2:03:20] because as much as you can appreciate
[2:03:22] the devil
[2:03:24] realize
[2:03:25] he was a created being
[2:03:29] to give us a contrast
[2:03:32] to make us believe and love
[2:03:34] god
[2:03:35] all the more
[2:03:38] i'll glory in my infirmities then when
[2:03:41] i'm weak
[2:03:42] i'm strong
[2:03:44] as long as it's to the will of god
[2:03:47] all right i got to close
[2:03:49] an enemy hath done this
[2:03:52] trying to confuse
[2:03:54] the original seed
[2:03:56] the bride material
[2:03:58] with the grafted vine
[2:04:01] the church
[2:04:03] corporate
[2:04:04] oh yeah brother tim you're talking about
[2:04:06] denominations right
[2:04:08] of every variety
[2:04:13] including those within the ranks
[2:04:16] of so-called message believers
[2:04:21] see brother tim here's how it is
[2:04:23] we got it
[2:04:25] you need to come over here
[2:04:27] and you need to line up and and join up
[2:04:30] with us
[2:04:40] if you can appreciate my ability
[2:04:43] eve
[2:04:47] he's got you
[2:04:48] if he can impress you
[2:04:51] with what he can do
[2:04:54] and you can be enticed
[2:04:56] by ability
[2:05:00] you're the prime candidate
[2:05:02] for his deception
[2:05:05] but if you can say satan if that's the
[2:05:07] way you're trying to impress
[2:05:11] you're only testifying
[2:05:13] to who you have always been
[2:05:16] i'm not serving god
[2:05:18] for what he can do
[2:05:21] i'm serving god for who he is
[2:05:30] i'm not serving god for the rewards
[2:05:34] those are going to come as the result of
[2:05:37] the relationship
[2:05:40] they're unavoidable
[2:05:42] but if the relationship is not there
[2:05:45] you're only getting the gifts
[2:05:50] but rebecca said there's a source
[2:05:53] and i'm willing to ride a camel tray
[2:05:56] across a desert wilderness
[2:05:58] and follow a man
[2:06:00] to find who sent the man
[2:06:03] and that's what differentiated the bride
[2:06:06] from the pentecostal and denominational
[2:06:08] and independent sisters
[2:06:10] they said we're satisfied to stay right
[2:06:12] here where we came from she said not me
[2:06:15] this is not where i came from
[2:06:17] i come from the mind of god
[2:06:19] and when i heard the message i realized
[2:06:22] this is not my home this is not my
[2:06:25] origin this is not who i am
[2:06:28] that is who i am and the message comes
[2:06:31] to call you
[2:06:33] to the giver
[2:06:35] and it does not disall
[2:06:38] or discredit the gifts
[2:06:41] it puts them in their place because it
[2:06:43] recognizes the value
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:48] i just gotta hit this brother stephen
[2:06:50] you see a woman with decked out with all
[2:06:53] the tencent jewelry of the jewelry store
[2:06:56] she doesn't know her value
[2:07:02] she's trying to attract
[2:07:04] with a false value because she's
[2:07:07] insecure of her true value
[2:07:10] hello
[2:07:13] but true gold and true things of
[2:07:16] precious worth are concealed
[2:07:19] and hidden
[2:07:21] and discreet
[2:07:23] and they're buried beneath a veil
[2:07:28] i'm gonna hit it church
[2:07:30] what's all this flashy religion
[2:07:34] an enemy had done this
[2:07:36] but god buried his treasure
[2:07:40] and said when you recognize where the
[2:07:42] treasure is you go sell
[2:07:44] everything else
[2:07:46] everything else to get the field with
[2:07:50] the treasure on the inside
[2:07:53] [Applause]
[2:07:54] it doesn't have to be flashy shiny it
[2:07:57] doesn't have to have a seat on the
[2:07:59] ecumenical council
[2:08:01] it doesn't have to have the adore
[2:08:04] and and all the things of the world
[2:08:07] we don't need
[2:08:09] the devils
[2:08:12] endorsement
[2:08:15] we've already got ours
[2:08:17] the message is already vindicated
[2:08:22] and it's being vindicated
[2:08:25] i have both glorified it
[2:08:27] and i will glorify it again
[2:08:30] it was glorified in christ it was
[2:08:32] glorified in the 120 that came out of
[2:08:34] the upper room on the day of pentecost
[2:08:37] here's my here's my punchline it was
[2:08:39] glorified in a waved sheath
[2:08:47] yes sir
[2:08:48] an enemy hath bound and bundled the
[2:08:52] tares
[2:08:53] but the wave chief
[2:08:55] is lifted up
[2:08:57] as a declaration
[2:08:59] the only thing remaining
[2:09:02] is me in a mini-membered expression
[2:09:06] called the body of jesus christ
[2:09:09] [Applause]
[2:09:10] let the sun rise
[2:09:13] let the revealed word of the hour shine
[2:09:16] let the son of man ministry and
[2:09:18] revealing be preached and lived
[2:09:23] it is
[2:09:24] the rising of the sun
[2:09:26] it's time for the declaration of the
[2:09:29] true wheat
[2:09:31] one came to maturity and was lifted up
[2:09:34] the ministry of jesus christ resurrected
[2:09:38] after seven church ages
[2:09:40] but one was not there to be admired and
[2:09:43] adored and crystallized and petrified as
[2:09:47] the only living expression of jesus
[2:09:49] christ in a human body
[2:09:51] it was there to testify
[2:09:53] it may be 10 years it may be 20 years it
[2:09:57] may be 1990 it might be 2000 it might be
[2:10:01] 2022 but somewhere there's a field full
[2:10:05] of jesus christ
[2:10:06] just like the original they won't settle
[2:10:09] for less they won't settle for a
[2:10:11] counterfeit they won't settle for a
[2:10:14] personality
[2:10:16] yup
[2:10:18] an enemy had done this
[2:10:21] but the rising of the sun had done this
[2:10:28] we're reflecting an original light
[2:10:31] an original source
[2:10:33] it is the rising of the sun
[2:10:36] and when the head rose
[2:10:38] the body rose with it
[2:10:41] his vindication was not just himself
[2:10:45] but it was all those who died in the
[2:10:47] faith
[2:10:48] and the same will repeat
[2:10:51] are you watching for the coming
[2:10:54] of the glad millennial day
[2:10:56] when our blessed lord shall come and
[2:10:58] take his waiting bride away oh my heart
[2:11:02] is filled with rapture as i labor watch
[2:11:05] and pray
[2:11:07] you're laboring watching and praying
[2:11:10] as a result of the rapture
[2:11:14] dwelling in your heart
[2:11:16] which will bring you into
[2:11:18] the climax

[2:16:32] oh
[2:16:33] my brother
[2:16:34] oh my sister
[2:16:37] hallelujah
[2:16:41] that rich man came from chicago
[2:16:45] down to the ranch
[2:16:47] and all those girls danced
[2:16:49] they displayed
[2:16:52] all of their skills and
[2:16:54] all of their tricks and all of their
[2:16:56] abilities
[2:16:58] and he was so disappointed
[2:17:03] what i was
[2:17:04] looking for
[2:17:07] is
[2:17:08] neither here
[2:17:10] nor there
[2:17:13] but when he stepped out
[2:17:15] to take a break
[2:17:18] from the denominational
[2:17:20] circus
[2:17:23] he saw
[2:17:25] something
[2:17:27] that
[2:17:28] caught him right here
[2:17:32] he said do you know why i'm here
[2:17:37] he revealed
[2:17:38] his purpose
[2:17:40] to the one
[2:17:42] he had intentions
[2:17:44] of taking
[2:17:46] home
[2:17:49] all those girls inside had their ideas
[2:17:52] of what it would take
[2:17:54] to catch his attention
[2:17:58] he told her
[2:17:59] his purpose
[2:18:01] and said
[2:18:02] will you
[2:18:06] she did she didn't have to hear how
[2:18:08] wealthy he was
[2:18:11] what he could do for her
[2:18:15] he offered her
[2:18:18] will
[2:18:19] you
[2:18:21] come with me
[2:18:23] and be
[2:18:24] my wife
[2:18:28] and she felt unworthy
[2:18:31] to even be offered
[2:18:34] much less to accept
[2:18:37] and that was the response he was looking
[2:18:40] for
[2:18:42] it vindicated yes my brother that she
[2:18:45] was the one
[2:18:46] if she said oh i've just been waiting
[2:18:48] all this time i got some fancy shoes
[2:18:51] oh and i've been taking dance lessons
[2:18:53] and i can shoot
[2:18:56] her response
[2:18:59] was the vindication
[2:19:03] and he slips away
[2:19:05] with a promise
[2:19:08] and
[2:19:08] a guardian
[2:19:10] he left an agent there
[2:19:13] that could watch
[2:19:15] and ensure
[2:19:16] that she was
[2:19:18] safe and protected until his return
[2:19:22] the prophet teaches
[2:19:24] there was an agent appointed
[2:19:26] by the man
[2:19:29] to watch her and make sure she was not
[2:19:32] defiled
[2:19:34] before he returned
[2:19:38] what is the proof
[2:19:40] that he's coming back
[2:19:43] here
[2:19:51] he's coming back
[2:19:54] for me
[2:19:58] i'm the reason he came the first time
[2:20:02] i'm the reason he came in the revealing
[2:20:04] of the son of man
[2:20:07] and i heard the proposal
[2:20:10] and didn't even feel worthy
[2:20:13] much less questioned the credibility
[2:20:16] of the agent
[2:20:18] he sits
[2:20:22] and her attitude
[2:20:24] confirmed she was the recipient
[2:20:28] and the designated beneficiary
[2:20:31] of all that he was
[2:20:33] [Music]
[2:20:34] and he said on a certain day
[2:20:36] i will return
[2:20:39] and the witness of his return
[2:20:41] was her
[2:20:42] preparation and
[2:20:45] readiness
[2:20:47] she wasn't looking for
[2:20:50] an excuse
[2:20:53] to cut corners
[2:20:55] and compromise the expectations
[2:20:59] she was quite happy
[2:21:02] to prepare herself
[2:21:04] to leave
[2:21:07] and go
[2:21:09] i'm not looking to get comfortable here
[2:21:12] i'm not staying here
[2:21:15] it's not where i'm from
[2:21:17] and it's not where i'm staying
[2:21:19] i'm getting ready
[2:21:21] to go
[2:21:25] an enemy had done
[2:21:26] this
[2:21:28] but he had done
[2:21:31] this
[2:21:32] god bless you this evening give the lord
[2:21:34] a hand of praise tonight

[2:21:57] young sister do you understand what the
[2:21:59] holy spirit has been saying
[2:22:02] did you get it really
[2:22:04] since sunday
[2:22:05] you have not caught it yet
[2:22:08] if i break it down it's going to be
[2:22:11] a problem
[2:22:14] amen
[2:22:19] make sure
[2:22:21] you are married to a christian
[2:22:29] you think he's not cool
[2:22:32] that's the perfect husband for you
[2:22:37] amen
[2:22:38] don't work for him
[2:22:41] let him be the husband
[2:22:45] don't chase him
[2:22:48] don't impress him
[2:22:53] do you know the story he just said have
[2:22:55] you read it with brother branham
[2:22:57] have you read it
[2:22:58] do you know where did they find the
[2:23:00] woman at
[2:23:02] on facebook
[2:23:07] she was doing what
[2:23:10] washing water
[2:23:13] what beauty do you expect to see a woman
[2:23:15] when she's washing dishes
[2:23:23] do you see now
[2:23:24] do you see now but that man found
[2:23:27] something there
[2:23:28] that's what men usually look for
[2:23:31] and the younger sister don't understand
[2:23:33] that
[2:23:35] young assistants still don't understand
[2:23:37] that
[2:23:38] watch their poster you see they don't
[2:23:40] understand that
[2:23:42] amen
[2:23:43] the one who's really shy that tried to
[2:23:46] get away that's the one that impressed
[2:23:49] men
[2:23:50] not the one that put up themselves
[2:23:53] that the man backs off
[2:23:55] they will talk to you and before you
[2:23:56] know it they marry somebody else
[2:23:58] they joke with you and they marry
[2:23:59] somebody else
[2:24:01] and they marry the one you like wow
[2:24:05] yes
[2:24:06] there is something in here that you
[2:24:08] don't have
[2:24:10] that you taught you more prejudice but
[2:24:12] you're not it's the other party that is
[2:24:15] evaluating
[2:24:17] amen
[2:24:21] uh
[2:24:22] young sisters
[2:24:24] god have a husband for you look for a
[2:24:27] genuine
[2:24:28] christian
[2:24:30] because marriage have a lot of stuff
[2:24:34] that have nothing to do with the
[2:24:37] hollywood
[2:24:39] all the posters you see people posting
[2:24:41] on facebook it's not reality
[2:24:47] i'm not permitted i would never tell you
[2:24:49] but if i was permitted you hear the
[2:24:52] story of married people you would never
[2:24:54] think what is going on
[2:24:57] so the best thing to do get a genuine
[2:25:01] husband
[2:25:03] a man
[2:25:04] who is a christian
[2:25:06] who loves you
[2:25:08] then everything will be okay
[2:25:10] and right at the beginning
[2:25:13] gear your husband
[2:25:14] to the word of god
[2:25:17] don't try to please him
[2:25:20] don't try to condone with him
[2:25:22] if he comes home he say no
[2:25:25] we can stay home and stream don't let
[2:25:27] him sit home
[2:25:29] i know what i'm talking about
[2:25:32] amen
[2:25:33] because when you're gonna wake up
[2:25:36] maybe five seven years in marriage and
[2:25:38] you're trying to change him
[2:25:40] to be a leader of the home
[2:25:43] you will see what you're dealing with
[2:25:45] because you already got him used seven
[2:25:47] years of having everything he want that
[2:25:50] is contrary to the word of god
[2:25:54] everybody care so right at the beginning
[2:25:57] amen before even you get married
[2:26:01] when you talking
[2:26:03] teach him that it is two o'clock you
[2:26:06] cannot call me at this time
[2:26:09] he will learn
[2:26:11] he will love you more
[2:26:13] when you hang up the phone he's like wow
[2:26:17] that's the one i need
[2:26:19] if you think no if i don't get answered
[2:26:21] that phone at two o'clock he's gonna get
[2:26:23] mad you are actually
[2:26:26] building him up a certain way
[2:26:28] that you're gonna entertain all your
[2:26:30] life and continue to suffer
[2:26:33] i am telling you what is the truth amen
[2:26:38] amen
[2:26:39] i'm not saying be rude that's not what
[2:26:42] i'm saying but stand on your christian
[2:26:44] ground
[2:26:45] tell them man i'm not gonna leave this
[2:26:48] home you come to our home and you talk
[2:26:51] to me
[2:26:54] tell that man we're not gonna ride the
[2:26:56] car with you
[2:26:59] tell that man keep your hand in your
[2:27:01] pocket
[2:27:04] he will understand you and he's going to
[2:27:07] respect you
[2:27:09] he's not going to be afraid of you
[2:27:11] because if you lose that respect
[2:27:13] you're going to manipulate him to work
[2:27:16] him up a different way so you can
[2:27:18] control him and when you do that you
[2:27:20] outside the word of god
[2:27:22] because you're trying to control the man
[2:27:24] you're already outside the word of god
[2:27:26] control him by the christian life
[2:27:29] amen
[2:27:30] i'm your wife but i won't tell that lie
[2:27:34] brother branham did something and made
[2:27:36] her just like you know what you did was
[2:27:38] wrong right
[2:27:39] they taught the prophet
[2:27:41] amen
[2:27:42] amen
[2:27:43] that's what the men need
[2:27:45] and the man when he goes to work he
[2:27:47] knows that i have a wife over there
[2:27:50] not a wife that is yes yes yes yes yes

[2:30:27] amen
[2:30:29] i'm telling you this by love i've seen a
[2:30:31] lot of stuff
[2:30:33] marriage when it doesn't work it's a lot
[2:30:36] of headache and the person that suffers
[2:30:39] a lot is the woman
[2:30:41] most of the time because you're trying
[2:30:43] to build the marriage and children here
[2:30:46] and before you know it the children are
[2:30:48] giving you a hard time and you can focus
[2:30:50] in the husband that is acting like a
[2:30:51] baby you have to push him in everything
[2:30:54] even to go to work you got to push him
[2:30:56] and now you're the one working trying to
[2:30:58] pay the bills and he's getting his money
[2:31:00] and spending out you the one that built
[2:31:02] him up that way
[2:31:06] amen
[2:31:07] let him be a man let him be what he is
[2:31:10] don't build a complex around him you're
[2:31:14] going to suffer
[2:31:16] amen you're going to suffer i have i i i
[2:31:20] came aground across brothers that live
[2:31:22] like they have a shield
[2:31:25] and when you meet them
[2:31:27] they know that you're going to see the
[2:31:28] real them and they have a tendency to
[2:31:30] back up
[2:31:32] because the more you talk to them you're
[2:31:34] going to realize they're not what they
[2:31:35] would have been projecting
[2:31:37] so before you know it they're trying to
[2:31:39] be isolated like hey god bless you god
[2:31:42] bless you and there are they're hiding
[2:31:44] something
[2:31:46] because they put up an image
[2:31:49] a man and the one who's on the laptop is
[2:31:51] the sisters
[2:31:53] tell him this
[2:31:54] answer this tell him this answer this
[2:31:58] you're wasting your time
[2:32:00] let him be a man and people accept him
[2:32:02] the way you are even if he you you have
[2:32:05] a phd and your husband is a high school
[2:32:08] degree
[2:32:09] you don't have to pump him up
[2:32:13] let him just be a christian nobody will
[2:32:16] play with him
[2:32:20] easy
[2:32:21] let's just be a christian nobody will
[2:32:24] play with him
[2:32:26] if you see a man dressed nice standing
[2:32:28] on a gate station do you ask him which
[2:32:31] school did you go to
[2:32:33] why do you call him sir you don't even
[2:32:35] know where he's from
