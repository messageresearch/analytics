Do you want me to come and be worn up at home and tired and then we're going to get into a prayer service? I say to the Lord, I say, "Father, look, this schedule is empty here.

God was in the middle of the fight. &gt;&gt; He's weakening the enemy, removing tire from their the their the chariot and then all kind of it was God that was fighting. All Israel have to do is just slay the enemy because the enemy is already terrified. &gt;&gt; Rahab say everybody here is already trembling. Who who made the wall fall? &gt;&gt; The wall of Jericho. Who made them fall? Did Israel have to stand from the morning with a hammer? No. The war fall by the falling of the wall. How many people already died &gt;&gt; just by the wall falling? So do you think when Israel was entering the people have even the courage &gt;&gt; to even stand when you seen all the wall crumbling down? Do you have the It was God doing that. God even told Israel, I'm going to send your fear before you. The fear of Israel was going before terrorizing the enemy. God is able to make things easier for you. &gt;&gt; God took a piece of wood and put it in the water. And the piece of wood pulled the uh the metal. The axe, it's written in your Bible. The axe got into the water and they took a piece of metal and they put the I mean wood and the wood pulled the metal. Explain me the chemistry. How can a wood pull the metal? &gt;&gt; This is the God I serve. &gt;&gt; My friend, it is a hour of logic. I'm tired of logic. I'm tired of reasoning. Reasoning have brought nothing to my life. But faith have done a lot of stuff in my life. So, I'm going to stick to faith and move on. You can't tell me anything. I have several experience of the faith of God. I seen God giving me $18,000 &gt;&gt; for a day like this. &gt;&gt; It's not a history. I seen it with my own eyes. &gt;&gt; I took it to the church treasury, put it there in the bank account, write the check and say, "Come and get it." Today it's a history. That foundation is a history. &gt;&gt; It is not in payment. That foundation is paid full. I'm trying to raise your faith up. I'm trying to raise your faith up. &gt;&gt; That foundation was 67 and it's paid off. How much is your house? &gt;&gt; You are too spiritual. Yeah, you are too spiritual. That's fine. Uh let's let's talk about other things &gt;&gt; because some of you own mortgages of $200,000 or some God is showing you what he can do. In other words, your house can be paid off. &gt;&gt; A few people continue with your mortgage. Not me. Not me. &gt;&gt; Not me. I have I have promises in this Bible right here. &gt;&gt; I have promises of houses without mortgage. It's in this house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So when I come to church and they say praise, then I'm going to praise him because God has been so good to me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you happy AND YOU LET'S CLAP OUR HAND FOR GOD. AMEN. We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Both visible and invisible audience. Amen. When the rapture come, you won't need all the faith that you need now. We will see Jesus all the time. &gt;&gt; And so if I need to really enjoy my faith, I will enjoy it now. I will believe for whatever I want to believe. &gt;&gt; You don't have to join me. I can stay alone. &gt;&gt; I will still believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a story book. This is a real book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is things that happened truly. &gt;&gt; And even there are many things that happened that were not even written here &gt;&gt; that Jesus did that were not even written here. &gt;&gt; So how much more was done in Israel? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we cannot even be confined to this book because what he did was so much. That's why we understand the thunders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We gave you the definition of thunders on Sunday. Very simple. &gt;&gt; Very simple from the Bible.

I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the that is the the the signature. If it was Trump, he would say, "Thank you for attention to this man. May may God bless you. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; If God says I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's saying this is final. &gt;&gt; There there's no higher authority &gt;&gt; there. There's nothing anymore that can be changed &gt;&gt; because I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much musicians for wonderful song service. It's good to see sister Yoko singing for the Lord. That shows that truly it's a it's a real gift of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, some people they sing and then when they get married they they stop singing. &gt;&gt; But if you can sing on this side and on that side, &gt;&gt; that's a real gift of God. &gt;&gt; And tonight we want to talk about uh get up your loins and eat in haste. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And uh for a subtitle, we want to talk about the son of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that it is Christmas season, but we we don't celebrate Christmas. How many how many knows that? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we celebrate the birth of our Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know based on the Bible that our Lord was not born in December. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what the prophet teaches us. But without getting into the doctrines that that's for the pastor, right? &gt;&gt; But being that we are in Christmas season, we have to talk about it &gt;&gt; because brother Brham would preach different sermons &gt;&gt; around Christmas time. &gt;&gt; If you want to go home and search, you can find many different wonderful sermons. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you know the world will commercialize anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Mother's Day. &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Easter. The world will commercialize Thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Christmas. &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize anything they can commercialize. &gt;&gt; But our job, our job is not to go after the commercial side. &gt;&gt; Our job is to stay with the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've learned early on in the ministry that when you visit, never teach about Christmas. Always leave that for the pastor. Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But from the scripture that we read, &gt;&gt; the Bible says when you eat the Passover, &gt;&gt; it talks about three things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, if I wish I had something to illustrate by time, I could have brought something, but um &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. The Bible says, "You shall eat it with your loins ged &gt;&gt; and your shoes in your feet." That's the second thing. and your staff in your hand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you shall eat it in haste. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For it is the Lord's Passover. &gt;&gt; And tonight, by the grace of God, we want to talk about the attitude of an exodus. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, getting up your loins. &gt;&gt; That is how you eat the Passover lamb. &gt;&gt; That is how you It's not sometimes what you are eating. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's how you are eating it. Sometimes it's not what you do but it's about how you do it. &gt;&gt; Many times you know we feel justified by doing what we are doing. &gt;&gt; But sometimes God is more interested in how we are doing what we are doing. &gt;&gt; Praise the L the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes people like to say no why why do you condemn me? I've done that. You know you can you could say good morning. You say, "Yeah, I've said good morning to you, but how you say it tells me what you mean." &gt;&gt; You can you can tell someone I love you, but how you say it will tell me whether you mean it or not. &gt;&gt; You can call someone sweetheart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But how you say it &gt;&gt; has different meanings. I can come to you and say, "Oh, brother Aaron, I do everything right. I say good morning. I make a meal." But how you do it makes a difference. &gt;&gt; So we could say that we're in the third exodus, but we may not be in an exodus based on our attitude. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God does not look at what we are doing. &gt;&gt; GOD LOOKS AT HOW WE ARE DOING IT. And God is very interested in HOW WE ARE DOING something &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that God judges &gt;&gt; the intents OF THE HEART. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not judge what you're doing. He judges your intention. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one time there was a woman who was anointing the feet of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Judah said, "If this could have been sold, we could have given the money to the poor." That was a wonderful statement but the intention was not correct. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO GOD DOES NOT JUDGE YOUR WORDS. He judges your intentions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So legalism gives you a covering &gt;&gt; but revelation gives you the right intent &gt;&gt; because legalism is based on legislation. But revelation is based on love. &gt;&gt; Revelation is based on the right intent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Legalism is about crossing the the the tees and dotting the eyes. &gt;&gt; You know, I've done this. I've done this. Like the Pharisees, they would pay the tithes of OF OF OF SPICES. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to this is it's okay for you to do this. BUT WHY ARE YOU ALSO IGNORING THIS? is because their intention was not right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says every each man's every man's way is right in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; But every man has to prove his own way &gt;&gt; if he's in the right way. Amen. &gt;&gt; So So the THE THE THE FIRST EXODUS, God tells them what to do and how to do it. &gt;&gt; In the second exodus is the same thing. In the third exodus, God has told us what to do. He has ALSO TOLD US HOW TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; AND MANY times the how part is not explicitly stated. &gt;&gt; The how part is in between the lines. &gt;&gt; The how part sometimes is not explicitly given. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God is interested in how we are doing things. &gt;&gt; So when you eat the Passover lamb, Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says you don't eat sitting down. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It says you should eat it with your loins girded up, &gt;&gt; with your stuff in your hand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we'll come back to this. Let's read another scripture. &gt;&gt; Hold this thought. We'll come back to it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, if we go to John chapter 13:3, the Bible says, "Jesus, knowing that the father had given him all things in his hand, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand to to see something here." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Jesus had a perfect revelation of who he was. And having a perfect revelation, the Bible says that he knew that the father had given HIM ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; YES, my brother. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he was that he was come from God and he went from God. &gt;&gt; So he knew where he was coming from. He knew where he was going and he knew what he had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO HE HAD A PERFECT REVELATION THAT HE WAS THE son of God. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PERFECT REVELATION THAT HE WAS THE SON OF THE KING. &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PERFECT REVELATION THAT HE WAS THE KING OF KINGS. &gt;&gt; BUT WITH THIS PERFECT REVELATION, &gt;&gt; what does he do? The Bible says he riseth from the supper &gt;&gt; and laid aside his garments and took a towel and ged himself and and that he poured water in a basin and began to wash the disciples feet &gt;&gt; and to to wipe them with a tower wherewith he was ged. &gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE OF PERFECT REVELATION, &gt;&gt; Jesus knew who he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I knew I was a king, I would build a golden house. IF I KNEW I was a king, I would find a thousand servants. If I knew I was a king and opposed all things, I WOULD FIND 10,000 CHARIOTS. BUT JESUS, &gt;&gt; KNOWING THAT HE WAS A KING OF KINGSH AND THE LORD OF LORDS, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF. PERFECT REVELATION LEADS YOU TO SERVICE. &gt;&gt; PERFECT REVELATION LEADS YOU TO HUMILITY. &gt;&gt; PERFECT REVELATION LEADS YOU TO HELP YOUR BROTHER. PERFECT REVELATION HELPS YOU TO HELP YOUR SISTER. &gt;&gt; If you KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A HUSBAND, &gt;&gt; it's not a problem for you to help your wife. IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A WIFE, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR you to help your HUSBAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM, WHERE YOU ARE GOING, AND WHAT YOU HAVE. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; you have something called insecurity. &gt;&gt; And when you have insecurity, &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME A THORN in the flesh. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JESUS WAS SECURE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. THAT'S WHY YOU YOU WOULD sing a song, blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you know who you are, &gt;&gt; you are not defined by your circumstances. WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY WHAT you have. WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU'RE NOT DEFINED BY WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE. WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE BY THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am brother Aaron. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I was born in Zimbabwe in Africa. &gt;&gt; If I wear a suit, I'm still Aaron from Africa. If I don't wear a suit, I'm still Aaron from Africa. &gt;&gt; If I eat five meals, I'm still Aaron. If I eat two meals, I'm still Aaron. If you know who you are, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE, WE TRY TO FIND THINGS TO DEFINE WHO WE ARE. WE TRY TO MAKE SOME TATTOOS UPON OUR BODIES TO IDENTIFY WHO WE ARE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO FIND LABELS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO FIND AN IDENTITY. Take your time. &gt;&gt; That's why people find they use they spend all their life saving &gt;&gt; to buy a Jordan sneaker. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with Jordans. &gt;&gt; On my birthday, you can get me some Jordans. But you know what? I'm not defined by Jordans. &gt;&gt; I'm not defined by the clothes that I wear. I'm not defined by the food that I eat. I'M DEFINED BY THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD TELLS ME WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I am not defined by my backgrounds. I'M NOT DEFINED BY MY zip code or my neighborhood. I AM DEFINED BY THE WORD OF GOD. I'M TRYING to remove the complex from your mind. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. UH NO MATTER WHAT YOU DRIVE, UH YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. NO MATTER WHAT YOU EAT, YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. NO MATTER WHERE YOU DWELL, &gt;&gt; because if YOU ARE A SON OF GOD, ALL THINGS ARE YOURS. &gt;&gt; YOU POSSESS ALL THINGS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS &gt;&gt; WAS the king of kings. &gt;&gt; Was the Lord of lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says he became poor. &gt;&gt; He was not poor, but he became poor. &gt;&gt; But can I tell you something? &gt;&gt; He was a poor king. &gt;&gt; He was riding a donkey, but he was still the king of kings. HE HAD ONE ROBE, BUT HE WAS STILL THE KING OF KINGS. THE DONKEY DID NOT CHANGE WHO HE WAS. THE ROBE DID NOT CHANGE WHO HE WAS. YOU ARE STILL THE KING OF JE THE KING OF THE JEWS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO JERUSALEM, &gt;&gt; he borrowed a donkey. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they were singing hosana &gt;&gt; to the king. &gt;&gt; Now, as I I want to I want to give a caveat. &gt;&gt; As I'm preaching this, &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I'm not glorifying being poor or poverty. You heard &gt;&gt; poor Joseph and rich Joseph. &gt;&gt; So we got that balance. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now let me preach please. &gt;&gt; You have Joseph of Arythea. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So you have got Joseph the carpenter and you have Joseph of Arythea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't go this extreme or that extreme. Let's just enjoy the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what you have &gt;&gt; does not define who you are &gt;&gt; because that's where depression comes. &gt;&gt; That's where anxiety comes. That's where complexes come. You say, you know what, I see others going to a vacation. What about me? You know what? You can wait upon the Lord. And even if you don't go, YOU ARE STILL A SON OF GOD. Even if you go OR YOU DON'T GO, YOU ARE STILL A SON OF GOD. And if you HAVE THAT ATTITUDE, THEN YOU CAN PRAISE GOD IN ANY SITUATION. BECAUSE YOUR PRAISING GOD IS NOT BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE. IS BASED ON YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's how you have a happy life. &gt;&gt; It's because the devil CAN NEVER GIVE YOU ANYTHING. AND JESUS WHEN HE WAS GOING to the cross he says the prince of this world is waiting for me but he has got nothing in me. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN COME TO A PLACE WHERE YOU SAY THE DEVIL HAS GOT NOTHING IN ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I AM FOR GOD AND GOD IS FOR ME. I COME FROM GOD. I GO BACK TO GOD. &gt;&gt; But Lord is here. defines people by objects. &gt;&gt; You are not a man &gt;&gt; unless you have got six packs. &gt;&gt; Guess what? I have one peg, but I'm still a man. I'M STILL A SON OF GOD. I'M STILL A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, you're not a man unless you have a pickup truck. Guess what? &gt;&gt; You may have a minivan. You are still A SON OF GOD. YOU ARE STILL A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO I DON'T CARE WHAT I HAVE OR WHAT I DON'T HAVE. I AM A SON OF GOD. AND I WILL PRAISE HIM ANYHOW. I WILL PRAISE HIM ANYHOW. I WILL SHOUT ANYHOW. I WILL DANCE ANYHOW. I WILL HOLLER AMEN. ANYHOW, SIR, &gt;&gt; brother Bam says, and you know what I've noticed in this in my travels, usually great men have and and they are great men and they are little men. &gt;&gt; I go around where there's great men, really great men. And they are great men. When I start to lift them, they make you think you are the great man. &gt;&gt; They ain't nothing. But you take a a little two by4 don't know nothing. He thinks he's all of it. &gt;&gt; One knows what he have. One knows one has got nothing. One has got something. &gt;&gt; Can I use an example? Technicians. You can take this and delete this part. You go to the hood. &gt;&gt; Somebody buys a $2,000 car. They will they'll buy all sort of things from Amazon. All these grills, all these speakers, all these things. Someone with a Rolls-Royce, &gt;&gt; they just wash it with they just wash it with water and that's it. BUT THE ONE WHO MAKES NOISE IN the hood &gt;&gt; is a $1,000 car. &gt;&gt; But the Rolls-Royce ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS. ONE IS TRYING TO compensate for what he don't have. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT CREATES something called religion. Because religion is a covering. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN ADAM LOST HIS POSITION, HE FOUND A COVERING. &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "WHY ARE YOU HIDING FROM ME?" &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "LORD, I'm naked." He said, "Who told you I'm naked?" &gt;&gt; SO ADAM WAS TRYING TO FIND A COVERING because he was missing something. &gt;&gt; And whenever a man is looking for something, &gt;&gt; he finds a covering. Sometimes it's tattoos. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's muscles. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S HEAVY METAL MUSIC. &gt;&gt; That is a covering FOR SOMETHING THAT IS LOST. &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to make something. You're trying to make up for something that you have lost. &gt;&gt; But if you are a son of God, &gt;&gt; you don't need you don't need to prove anything to anyone. Don't prove anything to anyone. &gt;&gt; You know who you are. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO, where you come from, and where you are going. YOU KNOW YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT gives you rest. &gt;&gt; He will keep those in perfect peace &gt;&gt; whose eyes are what are stayed on thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, it gives you rest. And the reason why we don't rest is because we are trying. We are running around. We are like wandering stars. &gt;&gt; But if you are a son of God, you know your position. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And can I tell you something? &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; although he was poor, &gt;&gt; yet he was able to do whatever you wanted to do. &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God, &gt;&gt; there's nothing that can stop you from doing everything that God wants you to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus went where he wanted to go. &gt;&gt; He ate where he wanted to eat. &gt;&gt; He He would go to where he ever he wanted TO GO BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? BECAUSE HE was a son of God. Whenever he had to go somewhere, God made a way for him. &gt;&gt; God made a way for him. I say God makes a way for you. God makes a way for you. God makes a way for you tonight. &gt;&gt; SO A SON OF GOD is not governed by the principles of the outside. &gt;&gt; He's governed by the principles of the word. &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS me to go to Samaria, he will take me to Samaria. &gt;&gt; By hook or cook, he will take me to Samaria. &gt;&gt; If God wants me to go to Mexico, he will take ME TO MEXICO. &gt;&gt; GOD PROVIDES FOR ME WHATEVER I HAVE NEED OF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS, "ALL THINGS ARE YOURS. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Now the first thing I want to say is &gt;&gt; Jesus never lived for himself. &gt;&gt; His life was spent for others. &gt;&gt; That's perfectly eternal life. &gt;&gt; When when you say you you go to church and do this thing, that's fine. But when you live for yourself, you have an eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So Jesus &gt;&gt; knowing who he was &gt;&gt; having a perfect revelation &gt;&gt; that God had given him all things where he came from where he went to wash the feet of the disciples. &gt;&gt; So the proof that Jesus Christ was ETERNAL SIR &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE WENT TO SERVE HIS DISCIPLES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ETERNAL LIFE is serving others &gt;&gt; and this is the key to the blessing OF GOD. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? &gt;&gt; Whenever brother Brham would find someone who's sick, &gt;&gt; or someone who is lost, &gt;&gt; you know what brother would say? He would say, if he heals you, &gt;&gt; do you promise to serve him? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If he heals you, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; would you promise to serve him? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because perfect revelation leads you into service. That's exactly &gt;&gt; what that means is that &gt;&gt; God provides us with everything that we need &gt;&gt; as long as we are able to put whatever we have in service of him &gt;&gt; and this tells me that even if it's your job situation &gt;&gt; if you have got a real desire in your heart &gt;&gt; and you say Lord I want to save you &gt;&gt; if you can bless me &gt;&gt; you know it's I I I got in out of trouble many times by just negotiating with God. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, if you give me this, I'll give you that. &gt;&gt; But you have to you have to honor what you promise God. &gt;&gt; Because God will will take you very seriously at your words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God be he gives eternal life &gt;&gt; and eternal life is a life that is lived to other people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus and the prophet says now eternal life is perfectly living for others. So when Jesus Christ came upon this earth &gt;&gt; around this I mean not this time around the time of Christmas which will be April right &gt;&gt; the Bible says &gt;&gt; he was born &gt;&gt; brother brother brother Steph will correct you don't worry he was born in a manger &gt;&gt; and being born in a manger the Bible says that there was no room for him at the &gt;&gt; in Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; With all his wisdom and all his preparation. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yet there was no room for him at the inn. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ was born &gt;&gt; there there was no pictures to show on Instagram &gt;&gt; because it was a manure pile. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In a manger &gt;&gt; and he was not wrapped in the North Carolina hospital baby blanket. He was wrapped in a swandling cloth. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And the people that came &gt;&gt; to congratulate him. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it was shepherds. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; first it was angels. &gt;&gt; Then the shepherds came. &gt;&gt; That's why the king of kings came into this world. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAYS THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GO DOWN. BECAUSE THE NATURE OF A man is not to go down. &gt;&gt; The nature of of a man is to lift himself up. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU GO DOWN, YOU ARE SHOWING YOURSELF TO BE GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A MAN CANNOT DO THAT. &gt;&gt; I SAY A MAN CANNOT DO THAT. &gt;&gt; IT TAKES GOD TO DO THAT. AND HE WAS BORN IN A MANGER OF HAY. &gt;&gt; AND THE SHEPHERDS &gt;&gt; THEY CAME and they were singing. And the prophet says, the angels, they sang the first Noah for him. &gt;&gt; And you know the people that came to the temple when he was circumcised, when he was dedicated, &gt;&gt; it was Simeon and Anna. &gt;&gt; That's right. These were not people that were coming from the borrowers of Manhattan. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE POOR PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS the degraded people. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE OUTCAST OF the society &gt;&gt; that came to the dedication of Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he was the KING OF KINGS. &gt;&gt; NOW, WHY did Jesus do that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in the in the in the book of Luke, it says, "This shall be a sign to you." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You shall find the baby &gt;&gt; raped in swaddling cloth. &gt;&gt; So the raping of the swaddling cloth, IT WAS ACTUALLY A SIGN that he was the king of kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So his birth &gt;&gt; was a sign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you see one of the, you know, you have to understand how when God does things, &gt;&gt; he's not just doing things for sure. &gt;&gt; He was not just trying to prove to the world how poor he can be. &gt;&gt; Neither was he trying to glorify poverty. &gt;&gt; But he was showing us a sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That he was going to be the king of kings. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By being born in a manger, &gt;&gt; and guess what the Bible says? He was born in a manger. The prophet says he had no place to be born. &gt;&gt; And the and the Bible says he had no place to lay his head. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he wanted to go to Jerusalem &gt;&gt; to be received as a king, &gt;&gt; he had to borrow a donkey. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; And he told disciples, you shall find a donkey &gt;&gt; tied upon a tree. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It says, if they ask you, you shall tell them the master has need of it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When they came to collect the taxes from him, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; He had nothing &gt;&gt; in the treasury. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Go to the fish." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The treasury had nothing. But he was still the king of kings. &gt;&gt; He was still the Lord of lords. And being the king of kings and the lord of lords, he was able to send people to find gold from a fish. &gt;&gt; That was the sign that he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? &gt;&gt; If we were to do it here upon the earth as human beings to prove that this is a royal wedding, There will be 31 carat &gt;&gt; decorations &gt;&gt; to prove that this is a royal wedding or this is a royal birth. &gt;&gt; There will be invitations to the celebrities. There will be invitations to the billionaires and the millionaires &gt;&gt; to prove that there's been a royal birth. &gt;&gt; But Jesus when he was born, &gt;&gt; he went 100% the opposite. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Jesus hides himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; But he reveals himself in the same &gt;&gt; and that's the same way that he has come in our day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you see everything about his birth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The prophet says he was born in the smallest town of the princes of Judah, &gt;&gt; which was Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He he went he just he was just going the the more little he could go, that's as far as he could go. That's right. &gt;&gt; The most literal town of Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; That was where he was born. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Which was a a a wheat &gt;&gt; belt. &gt;&gt; And the message when it came to us, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It came through a man who was born in the hills of Kentucky. &gt;&gt; A hey who was born in the corn belt of the United States. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that was a sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation sir &gt;&gt; does not change who you are &gt;&gt; but it makes you humble &gt;&gt; now people have gone to extremes &gt;&gt; to say no get rid of your houses don't drive nice cars that is wrong &gt;&gt; a true revelation &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; you you live in a nice house &gt;&gt; but you are still humble you still come to church you still praise the Lord a true revelation you drive a nice car. You thank God for a nice car, but you still come to church. YOU STILL WORSHIP GOD. UH YOU STILL HUG the brothers. Uh you still sweep the church. Uh you still respect the PEOPLE AROUND YOU. THAT'S a true revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be legalistic and say, you know what, I want to BE LIKE JESUS CHRIST. AND THEN YOU start walking on foot. You become you you you become a voodoo person who who send you to Sudan or Hayiti sir &gt;&gt; be a normal person &gt;&gt; brother wanted to live in the mountains &gt;&gt; the angel says you are going to be a bomb if you do THAT AND YOUR WIFE WILL leave you &gt;&gt; so when we talk about the humility of Christ we are talking about WHAT IS INSIDE YOUR HEART WHAT IS INSIDE YOUR MIND. IT'S NOT THE OUTSIDE, IT'S THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; After you preach like this, people go on a tangent and say, "Oh, brother Eron, that was a wonderful message. I'm selling my pickup truck." &gt;&gt; Come and sell it to me. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; so what I'm saying is Jesus &gt;&gt; did not change who he was. He was still the king of kings &gt;&gt; although he was born in a manger. &gt;&gt; So the word identifies who you are. &gt;&gt; So when you know who you are, it doesn't matter whether you are in a manger, whether you're in A HOTEL, WHETHER YOU'RE IN AN APARTMENT, YOU ARE STILL A SON OF THE KING. &gt;&gt; That is WHAT YOU ARE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FOCUS ON. AND when God lifts you up, you become more humble. When God lifts you up, you become MORE HUMBLE. WHEN GOD LIFTS YOU UP, YOU BECOME MORE HUMBLE. &gt;&gt; HE GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be humble. Be humble. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." It's in spirit. &gt;&gt; In spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not having one jacket. &gt;&gt; You are not the Messiah. &gt;&gt; You are who you are by the grace of God. Be yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't try to live in Nazareth and and and and and walk walk with with sandals. No, sir. Be yourself. &gt;&gt; Wear a suit. Come to church. &gt;&gt; Take a shower. &gt;&gt; Wear put on some lotion. &gt;&gt; The message is not a doomsday cout. &gt;&gt; The message is the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But we ARE NOT A DOOMSDAY COUT. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Don't try to be odd &gt;&gt; with the seventh seal." He says, "Don't try to be odd. If Jesus is coming tomorrow, just be on your post of duty. &gt;&gt; If you are working, he will find you working. &gt;&gt; If you in school, HE WILL FIND YOU IN SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; Don't try to be strange, to be humble. No sir, follow the word. &gt;&gt; You know, it's very hard to balance people because &gt;&gt; they they go to one extreme. always. &gt;&gt; You know how people start to say, you know, you know what? I'm not going to finish my finish my degree. Guess what? &gt;&gt; Life is going to be very hard for you. &gt;&gt; Don't do something unless God tells you to do it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, you'd say, "I'm going to cut my message short because the kids are in school." He was preaching the end time message but his kids were still going to school. &gt;&gt; Where did he preach the message leadership? &gt;&gt; He was teaching I think it was Rebecca's graduation class. &gt;&gt; Imagine the prophet's son daughter was graduating and he was he was teaching leadership. &gt;&gt; So when you hear about why Bethlehem &gt;&gt; why it had to be shepherds &gt;&gt; don't take it with a canal attitude. take it with a spiritual revelation &gt;&gt; to say, you know what? I have all of these things, but my Lord did not have any of this. I give God the praise. &gt;&gt; Even if I have all these things, I want to serve MY GOD WITH ALL MY HEART, WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, WITH ALL MY SOUL. What the Bible says, for my yoke is easy. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And my burden is light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So Jesus has a yokeh &gt;&gt; and Jesus has a burden. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But his yoke is easy, but his burden is light. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Now, so Jesus when he came upon the earth, &gt;&gt; he was not yolked to anything, but he was only yolked to the will of the father. &gt;&gt; So that is what we must do &gt;&gt; is that we are y to the will of the father &gt;&gt; because David said when riches increase set not your heart upon them. &gt;&gt; You can have nice things but don't set your heart upon those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU HAVE, DON'T SET YOUR HEART upon those things. YOUR HEART SHOULD BE ON JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Your heart SHOULD BE UPON JESUS CHRIST AND HIS WORD ONLY. NOW, SO THE scripture that we read first &gt;&gt; was that the exodus &gt;&gt; the people were supposed to g up their loins &gt;&gt; because in the old testament they used to wear these long robes &gt;&gt; but these long robes if you were going to work walk a long distance or run &gt;&gt; you know it's it's very difficult &gt;&gt; so what do what would people do they would pull them and they would you know tie them with a belt &gt;&gt; and that would tell you that somebody is ready to move &gt;&gt; and they would wear their sandals, their shoes &gt;&gt; and they would they would travel with a what? &gt;&gt; With a with a staff. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So God is telling you &gt;&gt; when you hear the word of an &gt;&gt; exorders &gt;&gt; enjoy the lamp. &gt;&gt; Eat the lamp. But guess what your mind should be? I have to move. &gt;&gt; I have to move. &gt;&gt; I have to walk. I have to go. So we are eating the message of the hour. But we are not eating to stay here upon the earth. Our attitude is I have to go to the rapture. I have to go to heaven. I have to meet Melkisedc. I have to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; So we are eating the lamb. &gt;&gt; We are asking God FOR WONDERFUL THINGS. BUT OUR ATTITUDE is not TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD. BUT OUR ATTITUDE IS TO LIVE OVER YONDER. Because Abraham &gt;&gt; had hundreds of flocks. &gt;&gt; He had hundreds of flocks. &gt;&gt; But guess what? He was a pilgrim. He was a stranger because he was looking for a city whose milk and whose BUILDER IS GOD. AND THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE MET ME, HE KNEW that the CITY WAS CLOSE BY BECAUSE HE MET THE KING OF THE CITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So Abraham &gt;&gt; Yes sir &gt;&gt; had thousand flocks &gt;&gt; but guess what &gt;&gt; he was moving &gt;&gt; that's it &gt;&gt; he was moving &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; he was moving he was looking FOR A CITY &gt;&gt; THAT IS OUR attitude in these last days &gt;&gt; if you build a nice church praise God we are still moving &gt;&gt; if we BUILD A NICE HOUSE PRAISE GOD I'M STILL moving if you BUY A NICE CAR PRAISE GOD I'M STILL MOVING because our attitude is to move out of here. &gt;&gt; Do you want to know &gt;&gt; where I'm going? &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder. &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder. &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to New York City. I'm not going to Los Angeles. I'm not going TO SANTA BARBARA. I'M GOING UP BEYOND TO BE WITH ME. I'M GOING UP BEYOND TO BE WITH JESUS. I'M GOING UP BEYOND TO BE WITH THE KING. &gt;&gt; Because Enoch, he lived until he was 65 years old. But one day he got a revelation and he TOOK A STAFF. HE WEAR HIS SANDALS AND HE WAS walking uh walking uh walking UH WALKING UNTIL ONE DAY HE WAS NOT FOUND. &gt;&gt; Because you know what the Bible says? Enoch, &gt;&gt; he had a family. &gt;&gt; Enoch had a wife. &gt;&gt; Enoch had children. &gt;&gt; But guess what? He was building pyramids. &gt;&gt; He was building pyramids. Why was he building pyramids? It was a revelation of what he was seeing. ENOCH WAS SEEING THE PYRAMID CITY. ENOCH WAS seeing the city of the king. &gt;&gt; But today, people have become so complacent. People have become so relaxed. &gt;&gt; You know, they eat McDonald's, they eat food, they have a, you know, a nice house in the seabs, they have a minivan and a dog. They live the American dream. &gt;&gt; You know what? I'm not looking for the American dream. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for the for for the American dream. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the bride dream. &gt;&gt; I am looking for the bride dream. &gt;&gt; And my mansion is NOT IN CHARLOTTE. I'VE GOT A MANSION OVER THE HILLTOP. &gt;&gt; MY MANSION IS ON THE HILLTOP. SO YOU SAY, "Brother Aaron, what are you saying?" &gt;&gt; I'm saying, "Whatever I have, &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at this. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the city." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever man I have in the bank, I'm not looking at that. I'm looking for Jesus. WHATEVER I'M DRIVING, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THAT. I'M LOOKING FOR JESUS. Wise men still seek him. Where are the wise men tonight? Uh who are seeking Jesus. THE PROPHET SAYS THEY SAW HIS STAR IN THE EAST AND THE STAR WAS IN THE WEST. WHERE IS THE WEST? The United States of America. THAT'S WHEN THE STAR of the seventh seal appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Exodus, &gt;&gt; yes, my brother, &gt;&gt; it's a call to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Exodus, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a call to walk. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Exodus, &gt;&gt; it's a call to go on a journey. &gt;&gt; And for you to go on a journey, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; you need to have travel light. &gt;&gt; You need to travel light &gt;&gt; because you know what? When you go to an air airplane, they will give you they will give you a limit for the baggage that you can you can bring. And that limit I don't care if your friend works at the airport. &gt;&gt; It is set by international standards of aviation. &gt;&gt; And for us to be in the rapture, &gt;&gt; my brother, &gt;&gt; we have to lay off some weight. It doesn't matter if your pastor is your friend. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if brother Aaron is your friend. &gt;&gt; We are on a journey. &gt;&gt; And for us to go on this journey, &gt;&gt; there is some weight that we have to get get rid of. &gt;&gt; That was the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; He didn't have anything of the devil. The Bible says one of the shortest verses in the Bible, &gt;&gt; it says, "Remember Lot's wife &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? &gt;&gt; She had many riches in Sodom. &gt;&gt; And her heart was upon them." &gt;&gt; But Abraham, when Abraham, he had many riches, &gt;&gt; but when God says move, &gt;&gt; he just move. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; Where is your heart tonight? &gt;&gt; Where is your heart tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 1 verse 13. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I've got 15 minutes to go. The musicians took their time. I'll take my time. Peter says, "Wherefore g up the loins of your what?" &gt;&gt; So in the New Testament, the loins are no longer the physical loins of, you know, is the loins of your what? Yes, my brother, &gt;&gt; be sober &gt;&gt; and hope to the end &gt;&gt; for the grace that is to be brought before unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Because the Bible says for the joy that was set before him, &gt;&gt; he endured the cross. &gt;&gt; So Moses, the Bible says he he he is he, you know, he had faith as seeing him who's what? Who is invisible? So because they were looking forward to the joy &gt;&gt; that was before them, they were able to endure the challenges &gt;&gt; that they were going through. &gt;&gt; And and and and Peter and Peter here is saying that let's g up &gt;&gt; the loins of our minds. &gt;&gt; What it tells you is that God is not saying get rid of, you know, things in your life. Don't buy a phone. No, he's saying your mind &gt;&gt; should always be attentive. &gt;&gt; What is God saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel the Lord saying go and pray. &gt;&gt; You go in the closet and pray. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I feel the Lord telling me tonight to just lay low. Just maybe switch off my phone and spend time with him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I feel the Lord leading me to do this. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants. &gt;&gt; It doesn't help God if you sell your house and you're still not spiritual. It It doesn't even help God at all. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Brother Brham says &gt;&gt; there will be millionaires in hell. &gt;&gt; He says but there will also be many pioneers in hell. &gt;&gt; That's a quotation. &gt;&gt; My brother &gt;&gt; says there will be many peners in heaven in hell. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:37 &gt;&gt; they were stoned. They were sand were tempted were slain with the word of God. They wandered about in sheep skins and god stings being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worth. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in the ds of the earth. &gt;&gt; So these were people that were on the move &gt;&gt; and the church of God should always be on the move &gt;&gt; because remember the prophet types the church of God to the vision of Ezekiel. He says, "Is the will in the midst of a will?" &gt;&gt; How many knows that? &gt;&gt; That's the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Because the church of the living God is not a denominated church. &gt;&gt; We don't dwell like a denomination. We move in tense. &gt;&gt; Today we go this direction. Tomorrow God says move. Go this direction. When the pillar of fire moves, we move with it. So the exter attitude is to be ready to move. &gt;&gt; When God speaks, be ready to move &gt;&gt; because you know what? WHEN GOD SPEAKS, IT'S DONE. &gt;&gt; There's no need to to wait and to linger around. WHEN GOD SPEAKS, IT'S DONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Hebrews Hebrews chapter 13. &gt;&gt; Let us therefore go unto the camp bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. &gt;&gt; So even if you live in France or in America, your attitude should be, you know what, I like where I'm staying. I love where I'm staying. But guess what? &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that other city. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that other city. &gt;&gt; You may love your president. You may not love him. But guess what? I'm looking for a day when Jesus Christ comes &gt;&gt; and he takes over the earth. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitude concerning John, &gt;&gt; what you went out the to the wilderness to see a a reed shaken with the wind. But what went he had to see? A man clothed in self, and behold, they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses. But what you went out for to see a prophet here I say unto you and more than a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the prophet now he and Jesus Christ said if you can receive it &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; this is here &gt;&gt; Elijah that is supposed to come. In other words, if you are able to receive such a deep revelation, &gt;&gt; because you know what it was so simple, &gt;&gt; he was not wearing king's robes. &gt;&gt; The Bible says his clothes were camel skins &gt;&gt; and he was and he was baptizing in the river Jordan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know when you take a camel skin and you go where there's water, you know what? It stinks pretty bad. So you had to have a revelation to go where he was. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Let me skip some things here. We bring it to a close. Now the prophet says here in exposition of the seven churches, now the seventh age is a very short age. &gt;&gt; Gathers up into itself for one quick work. &gt;&gt; That's right. all the evil of every age and all the reality of Pentecost once the Philadelphiaian age is about to run its course the loudian age quickly comes in &gt;&gt; bringing the tears and the wheat to the harvest &gt;&gt; so the prophet is telling us that the loudest church age &gt;&gt; yes sir &gt;&gt; it's a very short age &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; now I want to say this you know soberly as I close 1700 years ago the church f at na &gt;&gt; you know what happened at na was a man called Constantine. &gt;&gt; He brought a church. They were there was division in the church &gt;&gt; because they were debating on the deity of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So he brought the first the different scholars and they said let's come together let's unite &gt;&gt; and they had to iron out those differences and they made a resolution and they came up with something called the apostles creed. It was made at NA and that was the beginning of the Roman system. &gt;&gt; Because the church and the state they united. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then many years later there was what is called the great schism when the east and and the western bishops they split. &gt;&gt; Right. But recently the pope that came from America, &gt;&gt; what does his first pilgrimage since becoming a pope exactly 1700 anniversary? He goes to Na &gt;&gt; and at Na he takes the bishops of the Eastern Orthodox &gt;&gt; and the Western Orthodox &gt;&gt; and he stood and on the ruins of Naa because the Na was submerged in water and you know you can see the symbolism of the beast coming out of the water &gt;&gt; and they prayed the apostles creed together and he was preaching unity. says we must come together as one. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to unite. &gt;&gt; And if you are spiritual, you ask yourself where is Na? &gt;&gt; Na is in Turkey. &gt;&gt; Turkey is what we call Asia Minor. &gt;&gt; Because the Turkey is the bridge between the east and the west. How many knows that &gt;&gt; that the the church began in in Jerusalem and and it spread to Asia Minor &gt;&gt; and the and they were fleeing from persecution. They went to Turkey. &gt;&gt; They went to a place called Antioch &gt;&gt; which was the bridge between the east and the west. &gt;&gt; And at Antioch, that's when they were first called Christians. That's right. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, there was that bridge between the east and the west. So we come again to the last days &gt;&gt; and the prophet says I want to preach on the message when the east and the west meet &gt;&gt; and says we have come to that junction &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; where nothing has to happen except the coming of the lord &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN NO LONGER go any further to the west &gt;&gt; because the further you go you come to what red China HE SAYS BECAUSE CHINA IS THE OLDEST civilization &gt;&gt; and he says is because that gospel has traveled with civilization. That's right. &gt;&gt; And right now, who is making the most advanced car, electric cars? &gt;&gt; China. Who is building the most advanced buildings? China. Who has the biggest navy right now? China. Who is manufacturing everything all over the world? &gt;&gt; China. Because where was why we have come back to the east? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; The highest number of billionaires coming up right now is from where? China &gt;&gt; industrialization right now is in China. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we have got we we have we are 31 trillion dollars in debt. &gt;&gt; And China just posted a surplus of over $1 trillion trade surplus. &gt;&gt; They've been making surpluses over I don't know decades. &gt;&gt; And right now you look at Saudi Arabia, all the eastern countries, they are flourishing. Right? &gt;&gt; And you look at the the West, Greece, Britain, uh uh Germany, it's problems upon problems. Why? Because the gospel is now going back to the east &gt;&gt; to Israel. &gt;&gt; And so is civilization. &gt;&gt; So what is all these things telling you, friends? IT'S TELLING YOU IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; It's time to go home. It's time to leave out of here and to GO HOME. SO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING, OUR minds and our attitude should be Lord take us home. Lord take us home. Lord take us home. It's time to be in your in in a when you are in church. Don't just sit and and listen to the word. It's time for you to hold your stuff in your hand. &gt;&gt; Hold your stuff in your hand &gt;&gt; and be ready to go. When you look on the news, hold your stuff. wear your ski sandals and get up your loins because it's homegoing time. I SAY IT'S HOMEGOING TIME. Uh it's homegoing time. I'm going up yonder. Musicians come. &gt;&gt; This is homegoing time, friends. &gt;&gt; This is homegoing time, friends. &gt;&gt; There are many things we can talk about, &gt;&gt; but everything is showing that the Lord is coming. Last time when we were here, we told you that right now, research shows that conservatives are starting to hate Israel. For the first time in many years, everyone right now is hating Israel &gt;&gt; because you know what? Israel has to stand alone &gt;&gt; so that Christ can fight for it from the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. That's it. &gt;&gt; When you see, &gt;&gt; think about the intelligence of Israel. &gt;&gt; For for for many, many days, they couldn't find people in the tunnels. &gt;&gt; Friends, that was the hand of God. &gt;&gt; God was doing something to fulfill his word. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When you see all these things, friends, when you see how the world has become Sodom &gt;&gt; and the world has become &gt;&gt; Gomorrah, &gt;&gt; when you see pandemics and wars all over, you see diseases, you see politics, you see many radicals coming up, what does it tell you? When you see these things, lift up your heads &gt;&gt; for your redemption is is drawing now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going up yonder. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister Yogen, take it away. If you want to know, If you want to know where I'm going, where I'm going where I'm going, if anybody ask you, if anybody ask you where I'm going, &gt;&gt; where I am going, &gt;&gt; where I'm going, I'm going up beyond. &gt;&gt; Going up. &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond. &gt;&gt; Going up. &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond to be with my Lord. Yeah. I'm going up beyond. Going up. &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond. &gt;&gt; Going up beyond. &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond to be with my love. &gt;&gt; And I can take the pain. &gt;&gt; I can take the pain. &gt;&gt; The heartache they bring. &gt;&gt; The heartache they bring. Home but in knowing I'll soon be gone. Oh, as God gives me grad. &gt;&gt; I'm going to run this race until I see my savior. I'm going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Going in the &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture to be with my Lord.

Oh, &gt;&gt; I can take the pain. &gt;&gt; I can take the pain. &gt;&gt; All the heartaches they bring. &gt;&gt; All the heartaches they bring. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's comfort in knowing we'll soon be gone. As God gives us grace, &gt;&gt; we're going to run this race until we see a savior face to face. Going up yonder. &gt;&gt; Going up yonder. &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond. &gt;&gt; Going up. &gt;&gt; I'm going up to be with my Lord. Yeah. I'm going up. &gt;&gt; Going up. I'm going up beyond. Going up. I'm going up beyond. to be with my love. I'm going inure. I'm going inure. I'm going inure to be with my Lord. We're going in. We're going inure. We're going in rapure to be with our Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go in the rapture? &gt;&gt; Praise. Praise. Praise. Praise. Praise God. Everything that was preached here took it all, balance it up together and give it to you straight ahead. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter which state you are, keep your focus. Amen. &gt;&gt; On your maker. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember you plant potato, brother say it's like a jubilee time. Whenever this the trumpet sound, what do you do? &gt;&gt; Job where it is and you go. Amen. You remember Israel left Egypt with certain food that they didn't finish cooking &gt;&gt; and we describe it that there are certain project we won't finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we will get to a point where you start building something and before you know it you leave it there and we go when we come back it's a destruction of everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be normal. Stay normal. Get your loans g up your feet short with uh uh I mean shoes and then have your stuff in your hand and be ready for the coming of the Lord. Whether you in school, whether you at work, whether you trying to get married or whether you have a big project, whatever you want to do, keep your focus at the master. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God is coming soon and know who you are. This is the biggest thing you can keep tonight. Amen. Your circumstances do not determine who you are. &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, it breaks that complex and you can live freely and express yourself without even being afraid of anything. Not waiting to be somebody before you can be who you are. God built you with a certain nature. Be who God built you with and be confident knowing that you are a son of God. You are a daughter of God and God is watching over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he was going left and right but the time ran out so you need to probably pick up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Praise the Lord. Let's give the Lord a big clap of Amen. Amen. The subject of the subject of Christmas was already dealt with in a hotel. &gt;&gt; It was already dealt here last year in details. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham clearly stated the quote. I gave it to you. Brother Brandham say it's a worship of devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to be very spiritual to understand brother Brham and stay with what is on the tape. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm repeating that again. &gt;&gt; Because there is craziness, foolishness going around and everything. Hey, you already been preach about Christmas and everything. Stay focused in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you do Christmas and you put Santa and everything, what do you get out of it? &gt;&gt; Does it bring you closer to God? &gt;&gt; So when you put Santa and then tomorrow you are closer to God. So I'm asking you a question &gt;&gt; because it looks like in this message they don't want to get that lollipop out. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When you put a light outside like the people in in our neighbor here when you put those light that do they attract angels? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you are worshiping the devil. &gt;&gt; How many courts do you want? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, brother Brown was telling people merry Christmas. &gt;&gt; Do you know how many times Elisha Elijah told Elijah to stay? &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question. &gt;&gt; I know I know I know somebody was trying to escape with that. Let me hold it. Do you know how many time Elijah told Elisha stay? How many coats did Elijah have? Elisha have &gt;&gt; If you ask Elisha, Elisha say I have three coats. Elijah told me stay in Gilgar. &gt;&gt; So if you come in Jericho, why are you staying in Jericho? I have a quote. Elijah say in Jericho, you're going to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; I wish I was on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to miss the revelation of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham say when they say when you see me see is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the rapture happened after they crossed Jordan. That's when the chariot came and pick up Elijah into the rapture. But Elijah who was going into the rapture was discouraging &gt;&gt; Elijah three times. He say stay here. So if you ask or why did you go back? &gt;&gt; She have a quote from Naomi. &gt;&gt; She even have a video from Naomi. You didn't know about it. Maybe you were not born in that time. &gt;&gt; In that time we were with roof and I have the coat. That's the reason why we are still living in Moab &gt;&gt; because Naomi say stay there. &gt;&gt; But there was something in roof. &gt;&gt; When Naomi is saying stay there &gt;&gt; in the eyes of in in the ear of Ruth it doesn't mean stay there. It is like hey you trying to block ME FROM MY BLESSING. I'M NOT GOING TO STAY HERE. I AM GOING WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You who are following me online, &gt;&gt; put a Tik Tok, my friend. I'm already moving even on Tik Tok and uh and Instagram. Put a Tik Tok. You who are following me online.
