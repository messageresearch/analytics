this song invite brother stevenh tonight amen how many believe tonight we are Justified amen amen regardless of whatever we did amen the Lord says we are Justified amen so we want to take just the chus Justified amen Justified [Music] Justified you have not done in the perf justif justif oh [Music] justify oh done it in the let's keep it amen oh justify oh justify [Music] you justif oh you in the oh jusy [Music] justif you have it in the first place justif oh justify justif you have not done the place you [Applause] Justus amen you have not done it in the first place you are Justified amen if you have a hard time swallowing that you told him I did it ignorantly in unbelief so at that point your conscience will be calm because it's hard the brother brandham say God is the only one that can forgive and forget but human being you can forgive yourself but you won't forget so when they say you never done it in the first place it's hard for the human man to grasp the richness of the glory of God to understand that I never done it so God gave us a second thing through Paul I did it devil but I did it ignorantly in unbelief amen because there is a sacrifice of ignorance can you believe it amen amen is God unjust God forbid amen it is for the vessels of Mercy that have been predestinated to show the glory of God Amen when Judah does it it's not in ignorance it is counting unto Judah even if he take the money and pull it back it's not working when Esau goes back and then cry and repent it's not working but when Peter comes back it's a different story it looks like God overlooked the mistake of Peter amen because God has something special when it comes to the predestinated seed amen it is the sin of ignorance you did it ignorantly in unbelief that's why when you come back to your normal mind it is completely different I know you fighting with the thought that okay now we know that we justify but we still make mistake right don't worry my friend down the road I have like 80 something slide I mean the court or something so we are loaded so down the road we will deal with that how can you be justified never done it and still you fall on the on I mean under sin or you commit I mean you do something wrong what do you think about it what has God think about because that's what matter and you will see and it will free you completely and deliver you because these things are not been taught well and we struggle with the devil all the time beaing ourself some of us have a PhD in biding ourself amen I'm the bad one I did bad I I mean I don't deserve Mercy to begin with you don't deserve anything so it was the grace of God so when you say I don't deserve I don't deserve sometime what we mean is I wish I never done any sin so I can come to God and say I deserve it that's what we unconsciously are saying without saying it so you try to be over just it is the attribute that produ it in other word it's God that allow it so that God can show healing through you so that God can show his saving power through you how can God save you if there is nothing to save me how can you call him a savior so why do you blame yourself brother Bram say it's the attribute that produces it as hard as you think he's the one that created Lucifer what did he have in mind when he was creating Lucifer to bring Lucifer to worship Him Lucifer begin to worship but God knew exactly what Lucifer will do and if you notice at the beginning he worshiped yes he did then later on he turned into something else and Judah at the beginning was a disciple he preached the gospel he cast a devil but toward the end he shows something what do you think Jesus was piing when he was picking Judah was he looking at Judah preaching the gospel only no no he knew that the atonement must be killed and need somebody not from Heaven from Hell because he was called the son of ption so he came from hell it's God that picked somebody from here and put him among the disciple to fulfill his work this is this is not uh Pentecostal uh teaching these are message pure word Brad that open up your eyes and you will bless God every day of your life amen because if you were not predestinated no matter what you do you are going no amen but God chose you before the foundation of the world and he put you in the Lamb's Book of Life and then kill the lamb knowing that somewhere down the road I know they're going to mess up that's why he say you are God don't forget that but just know that you're going to fall like men amen I'm already in other word I'm already aware of what is coming in your life so when you coming back home don't think you are the one informing me oh Lord I did a 100 Sin Sin number one what do you think God was when you were doing that God already knows everything amen amen that's why he summarized everything in unbelief because sometime you won't remember everything in detail that you did from the time you were born all the way now if not everybody will stay on the Altar for three five days sitting uh s number uh 1,35 see number 4 4,000 I mean I mean how are you going to remember all of that so God help you and put everything up he said whether you remember it or not whatever you remember just put it and say I'm a sinner when you say I'm a sinner so we know exactly everything that follow up is connected to a sinner so when you ask forgiveness as a sinner it cuts everything away so when you chop sinner it chop Sinner and every attribute that is connected with sinner is chopped away so you don't have to go into the [Applause] detail if I say what I want to say you will shock some of you so I bet I better just avoid right the problem is when I say I'm the one on the camera are we together are we together that's why a true head a true head a true husband will not sit and wait for his wife to give all the [Music] detail the wife need to confess but a true husband will sit and say that's it I already know you messed up put it down let's move on I don't need for you to tell me number one one number two number three number four number five what do you think do you love [Applause] me there is a way to summarize all of that into one thing she already have a baby what do you want that's a Silence of the seven SE yes sir did you get what I say did you get what I say God look at one thing you did all of this because you were a sinner that's why brother Bram say sin is not uh stealing it's not this is this brother say sin is unbelief I'm an unbeliever no wonder you cheating no wonder you lying no wonder you doing all of the so should we stay here like a Catholic where you go to the Catholic have you been in a Catholic Church some of you are born in a message praise the Lord thank God don't even try to go look it up but we were there you go sit the priest is sitting in a little chamber and you sit there and you begin to say everything that you did I did this I did this and the priest say go ahead and do hell Mary 20 times and do this and you go ahead and you go hell Mary blah blah blah and then you go back you think you you are [Laughter] I will tell the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen he saw Mary Magdalene I don't know who's pulling this whether it's online or it's here because it's a convention so let me speak it's a convention it's not your normal regular service this is a convention amen Mary Magdalene came I'm going to ask you a question when did she pray I'm asking you a question when did Mary Pray when did she pray did you see her coming and say Lord Jesus oh Father you're the god of Heaven you're the creator of Heaven and Earth what did she do she just did what she did did she open up her mouth the Bible say out of her came seven unclean Seven Devils and brother Bram is the only one that gave us all description of Seven Devils so where did Mary sit down and say Jesus I have seven devil devil number one is this number two is this number three is this because it was those devil that made her what she was what when did she pray I'm just asking you a question so what is prayer what is really prayer pray because Jesus was sitting there leaving her doing everything then he turned around to the accuser because he need to dismiss the case first before he justify just like the woman that was caught in adultery he need to dismiss the accusers first before he get there amen so what do you think we can do amen what do you think he's going to do he just sat there when he finished he said woman you sins that are your sins that are what how did Jesus know that he was many how did he know he was many he met Mary Magdalene the first day but he knew that her sins were many everybody that was there knew her they have vide tape and uh iPad and and record from uh I mean they they kind of downloaded all her pictures and everything Jesus didn't need all of that he said your sins are many are what based on which prayer the atonement is powerful my brother the atonement is powerful message believer clean up your mind on atonment it's a very powerful thing amen the atonement put you on a high level like you never done anything and it's the atonement that bring you back to your state of deity because the atonement produces that are we together praise God glory to God we welcome you on our first Convention of 2025 this is our first one amen last week was New Year's Eve this is our first Wednesday so it's our first convention 2020 5 amen so we welcome the visible and the invisible audience and any family members here God richly bless you we do not have visitors so if this is your first time God richly bless you they gave me a prayer request here to pray for uh brother Raj okay we can do that probably at the end he's online from India we got you brother Raj we will pray for you he lost his appetite so we will pray that the Lord restore everything back amen so Wednesday I am not preaching Amen brother Tony Allen will be preaching tonight first time in the

and that he's healed right now in the name of Jesus Jesus Lord God we bless the remaining of your service oh God and the reading of your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 yes sir and it reads for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh that's for the weapons of our welfare are not cornal but mighty through God to the pulling down of stron holdes you can be seated and my my subject for tonight is the pulling down of the enemy's strongholds the pulling down of the enemy's strongholds yes sir and I look at Christians today and I and I one thing I don't like to see is is brothers and sisters and Christian in bondage and and and it it troubles me when I see this you know in the church outside of church and and and and we have this word and and and and we I see that we in bondage a lot of times and and I think I was like why are Christian Believers in bondage and and and and second Corinthians came to my to my mind and and I was like we we going to expose the devil tonight that's right everything that he ever did and everything that he trying to do we're going to put them on blast tonight for the for the word says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh that's right for the weapons of our Warfare are not cornal so basically the word is saying the weapons that we fight with are not cornal that's right this this war is not a cornal war no sir it's a spiritual war that's right and you cannot fight this war with a corner mind no sir Hallelujah and it's saying it's But Mighty through God to the pulling down the stronghold that's so whatever these spiritual whatever these spiritual weapons are they're Mighty so the word is telling me whatever these weapons are that I have in my possession sir they're in my possession as a Believer they are powerful enough to bring these strongholds down not only way I can get in trouble if I don't use them so it's there there are through the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations so that tells you right there there there's going to be some imaginations going on and and and these imaginations is Imagination that you don't have nothing to do with and we we going to get in that in a little bit and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God now a Believer is is not going to exalt himself against the knowledge of God so this word is saying every High thing that exalteth itself against God I don't I only know one person that's right that tries to exalt himself higher than God so so so we already know where these imaginations are coming from and we already know what these thoughts are coming from but the word says the power that we have is able to bring these thoughts into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so so whatever it is that we need we already got it on the inside so we just got to use it that's right so so my question to you tonight what what is a gr hole what is a stronghold one definition says it's a place that has been fortified so as to protect right it against an ATT type right and on a and on a spiritual note it's a place where particular cause or belief is strongly defended or upheld take your time take your time now we we don't necessarily want to deal on the natural strongholds ton now we we going to focus on the spiritual side now a stronghold has two functions it's used to keep things out and it's used to keep things in a stron ho has two functions it's used to keep things out and it's chose to keep things in and what God wants us to be is behind the stronghold of his word his word is a stronghold for every believer yes sir and back in the biblical days um on the natural standpoint you know they would you know they would use uh big tall walls for Protections in the in the natural they they would surround their buildings with big tall walls that for protection but those walls were protections from the enemy but if you think about it if though if the enemy was to get inside those walls that same stronghold become protection for that enemy so but the but the good note on the spiritual side is that Satan can't get in he's got to find some kind of way to get you out he cannot cross the word of God so his his tactic is to find a way to pull you out from behind the word so that he can get you the reason with the word of God now a spiritual stronghold is a mental or emotional space controlled by a spiritual enemy and he uses it as a stationary to wage war against God that's right in the mind in mind battles this is the place where he uses to wage war against God so he can't pass the word so if he can get you out and get you to reason with What God Says then he got something to work with that's right he got something to work with yes sir in the message the greatest battle ever fought yes sir in 62 he said that but B say there's your Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning right back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul that's right the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit that's right you can have a little conscious Consciousness and little feelings right and little Sensations right all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little Sensations and things right but when it comes to the reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's right that's it friends God let none of them miss it see if your mind that opens up the door or closes the door that's right it listens to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affections but when your mind close itself to those things and let God the spirit of his word come in yes sir it blows the rest of that stuff out that's right every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true yes sir these battles has raged since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's word but he whitewashed it he stopped up some little channels here somewhere he said but surely God Genesis 3:1 see surely God all things that he promised he know the word was right but he know he couldn't just come right out and blast it out BL like that but he sugarcoated it that's right let's turn let's turn to Genesis 3 and let's take a look at that amen see I'm I'm I'm just tired of him Whispering the enemy whispering things that God didn't say that God didn't say now chapter three sir verse one Genesis 3 verse one it says now the serpent was more subtle right than any beast of the field right which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay have God said you should not eat of every tree of the garden now see that was a sarcastic statement right there now he he know that's not what he told him see see see how he came around the word he he know that's not what he told her so so what he did he he he threw a jail better did did he not did did he say thou shall not eat of every tree of the garden now Eve going Eve going to correct him this time that's brother and the woman said unto the serpent no no no no no that ain't what he said we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden we can do that but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die that's now verse three 2 and three Eve basically was telling the serpent that God didn't say that that that's exactly what she told him God didn't say that and that's how you got to do when the devil come telling you something that the word didn't say you just got to look him in the face say God didn't say that the word didn't say that the word didn't say it didn't say that there's no scripture in the Bible that say we're entitled to diabetes there's no scripture in the Bible that say we entitled to high blood person there's no scripture in the Bible that say that we're not we can't make it but God say we are healed we are healed by his scripes and that's the word you got to hold on to he's not going to tell you you heal he's going to give you any other reason to believe that you heal but you got to tell the devil God didn't say that that's not what the word say [Applause] verse [Music] three she says verse three but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die see he didn't he didn't get in with the first jail so so here he coming he coming around the other way come around another way he said You shall not surely die now if that's not the opposite of the word he he can't he can't get behind the word he can't change it so all he can do is take the word and flip it the opposite way for God do know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil wow Proverbs 25:28 says he that have no rule over his own Spirit right is like a city that is broken down that's it and without walls amen and so basically if if you're not behind the protection of the word any and everything is able to get in and out of your spirit any and everything is able to travel inside and outside of your spirit so if the devil can get you to realize or Reason with the word of God if if you if he can get you to realize that you're not healed he got something to work on and and and he come in all kind of tightness and he he look at you and and and the doctor might tell you oh you oh you got cancer come on the doctor might tell you you got cancer but the word of God told me I was healed by a scraps and and he going to come to you and say oh you know you're losing a little weight don't don't you see that but you got to stay focused on the word I I I don't care about the circumstances I don't care how many tests I got to go through I don't care how many trials I got to go through I got my eyes focused on the rapture [Applause] he told me it was going to be a Rapture and I believe it I'm I'm not overwhelmed with the testes I got to go through to get to the Rapture that's going to be many tests but if he can get me to stop dropping pay attention to every little thing that it do then I take my mind off the Rapture now he got me then he'll talk me out of the Rapture but I know there's going to be a Rapture I don't care how many testes you bring my way I don't care how many times you tripped me up there's going to be a rapture and I'm going to stay [Applause] focused am Ephesians 2 and 2 says when in time pass yes sir you walk according to the course of this world that's right according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience yes sir so so this this is who we Waring against you know Satan and and his angels his fallen angels and and like I said when you behind the protection of the word he can't get to you and and and and and the bride of Christ should be so fortified behind the word so so he can't get way in I mean I mean he should thus say the Lord should be all around you you got to get to a place when Satan comes up to you he runs into dust says the Lord you see what I'm saying and then and then when he come from another way he running the dust say the Lord he can't get in so whatever way he come tired of get to you he need to run in the dust sayth the Lord you need to be fortified behind the word don't reason with the word don't reason with the word and and the and the Bride is a word bride and we have a word Prophet so so so this is all we have so in Ephesians 6 verse 10 it say finally my brethren sir be strong in the Lord that's right in the power of His might that's right put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil that's right for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may a be able to withstand the evil of the devil and heav doing all to stand am now how how can you put on the whole arm of God I'm ask you a question how can you put on the whole arm of God by believing Every Word by believeing every word that's in this Bible when you deny one part of this Bible you missing a piece of your armor in the message who is God yes sir this is in 1950 paragraph 12 said well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost born men doesn't realize their Authority where of the authority that God has permitted to his church on I give unto the the key to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose will be loosed I give you power over serpents and over all kinds of diseases yes sir so he's telling me I got that power right not just me but you got that power so why would you accept anything from the devil when you got that power you got the answer to his to his lies you got the answer he give you he give you power over all kinds of diseases yes sir oh everything and nothing shall harn you exercise your faith Let it Loose let God have his way God will grant it to you and he said exercise your faith but you got to put it in action that's right you got to put that power in action that's right you can't just read it in the Bible you got to speak it to the devil he he know the word he see the word but he just can't live it but you got you got to put it back in his face Matthew 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse 19 and I wish I had it up there so you can read it so they put it up okay you got to say amen and I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven yes sir whatsoever thou sh bound on Earth shall be bound in heaven that's right and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so the so the so the prophet right in line with the scriptures yes sir so he he describing you telling you what you can do with this power so my my thoughts tonight is that every every child of God will be free tonight that that's that's my prayer tonight that anybody that's bound that can be free tonight you you need to know where your battle coming from you need to know how to fight you need to know how he how he attacks you you need to know how to counteract hallu now let's look at this message the conflict between God and Satan paragraph 29 it says Eve got from behind it and lost the battle right as soon as Eve Satan was standing out there shooting his targets she said but the Lord said and then he shot again she said but the Lord say so then he shot again another way but the Lord said but Satan raised up back there said but wait just a minute if the Lord did say that let me just tell you something you see you're not wise like God you don't know right from wrong but if listen wouldn't you love to be wise like God see she see she shot him down with every Avenue that he came in so so he he's he's very cunning he's very cunning so so he he's not going to stop until he find a way to get in so so like I said you need to make sure that you you don't have no way for him to get in and and only way you can do that is surround yourself by the [Applause] word and the prophet says why Eve said yes I believe I would maybe something like that I believe I would like to just know all the wisdom of God I like to know what's right and wrong I don't know it well tell I'll tell you this say say I'll tell you now she said but the Lord said oh but surely you know he's a good God he won't do that see right there she broke the hole through so he could shoot right there she made the wrong stop right there yeah see she opened up she opened up she opened up a space for him to shoot in she opened up a space and and what she did she went against what the word said so when she went against what the word that become that become a gap in her protection see the word was her stronghold but the minute that she turned down one portion of the word it opened up a gap of her protection now the enemy can get in that's right and and what he do he pulls her out yeah when she when she begin to un disbelieve what the word say he pulls her out and he begin to develop strongholds in their mind now she got a stronghold between her and the word of God so then now she become a protection place for that [Applause] Spirit when when you allow the devil to talk you out of what God Said you become protection for that Spirit now instead of the word of God being a being a stronghold for you now you a stronghold for that [Applause] spirit and that's what Satan want he want rest he want to place the rest and when you let him in you is his protection the only way you can break that is to get back in line get back behind the word of God the only good thing about it if you allow Satan to do that if if he can treat you into taking something that God a said you can always give it [Applause] back you can always give it back there there's no respiration period you you you know you go to the store and buy something they tell you you got 90 days to exchange it no you can always give the devil his you can always give it back to him there's no time limit on it whenever you can come to yourself however long that take when you come back to yourself all you got to do is say I'm sorry devil you can have this back this is not what God said this is not what he said we we we didn't say that he won't use you or he won't get to you sometime but sometimes some somewhere down the road a Believer is going to wake up somewhere down the line a Believers going to wake up and and and they going to say you know what God didn't say this he didn't say that wh why am I worrying about things when he told me he won't put no more on me than I can bear and you know and then the scripture start coming back in our mind why why I worrying about if I'm going to make it and he told me I already made it you know when you and you start playing the scriptures in your mind why why am I worrying about sicknesses and he already told me I'm Healed a Believer going to kick soon or lat it's going to kick in and when it kick in you just politely hand it back to him as they say the game is [Applause] [Music] over paragraph 30 say now let me say something to you Christians down here uhhuh we're still in a conflict between God and Satan yes sir now let me say something to you Christians down here don't you never stop one second for the devil don't stop to reason it out when you start to reason it the Devil comes right in and see that's what he wants you to do reason he want you to find some kind of way to to say that God didn't mean what he said no God meant what he said you cannot you cannot reason God you cannot understand God you got to just believe God see that's it I can't explain God nobody can I can't explain many things but the only thing I just believe it because he say so now there's none of us can explain it don't try to explain it don't get with these unbelievers that say well now look your pastor out there I heard him pray for the sick now you're all crazy down there there's no such a thing as divine hisory healing say all right there isn't for you then cuz you're an unbeliever you just R you just walk right on see it's just for the Believers where you all say you you got the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost say is isn't it isn't for you then you just go right on see don't try to reason it it hasn't got no reasoning you just believe and that and that's one of the main things he like to he like to tell Believers that you don't have the Holy Ghost you know and and cuz cuz if he if you can you know catch that Revelation that's it that that that Christ is in me if you can catch that Revelation that Christ lives in me and and and and he fights with that the most he he do he do not want you to realize who's walking on the inside of you so he will make you reason all the time about who's walking inside of you because he have you looking at the corner man he would constantly Focus you on the corner man but you you got to catch the [Applause] Revelation hallu putting on the whole arm of God yes sir it's 1962 paragraph 29 say now we found out that God gave his children the best yes my brother and therefore he don't have to improve it he just he never changes he hasn't changed one bit since the first time he gave for his children protection now when he knew there's war in heaven he had to kick out Satan right then he came down on Earth and fortified his children with his word yes my brother so you see your protection word god came down here to fortify you with the word he he knew that the only way you could be be protected from the enemy when he came to Jesus what did Jesus do it is written he put the word on him he he did he didn't give him nothing but the word and and and that's what we got to do tonight we got to do that tomorrow in the day after that we got to use the word there's no other way around it he he came down on the earth and fortify his children with his word I want to ask you something just think he said now Eve did not why she Eve did not while she was standing in that great Fortress of his word and see she was behind the word right she was fortified behind the word but she made the choice to St to step out right so some don't don't step out tonight it get rough sometimes it get tough sometimes and we don't understand God sometimes and what he doing but just stay on the word don't leave the word it's the only thing that's going to see you through it's your protection it's the only thing that can protect [Music] you you know he constantly saying you know that that the word is your Fortress and and and and and David talked about it a lot right once he realized what his protection was they they always talk about the Lord as my Fortress he's my buckler he's my shield and and and David caught a revelation where his protection he knew if I could stand behind the word that my enemies couldn't get to me if you read psalms David D David was constantly talking about his enemies but but he knew that they couldn't touch him where he [Applause] was he say now Satan was on the outside trying to use some kind of technique to get in you know to get her out of there basically what we talking about right now she would have just stayed behind the word everything would have been fine and that's what we make our mistake we get from behind the word so now paragraph 30 say now we found out then in this great time of the beginning when God fortify his children yes sir in thisfor of his word right and he told them now that was it now just think he didn't turn the whole word she didn't turn the whole thing down she didn't say well God I guess it's all together wrong I don't believe a word of it no I believe half of it Lord no Satan just misconstrued a little bitty fraction of it not all of it just a little bit of it and because of that she listened to that one little term it caused every funeral possession made every grave made every gray hair every sick baby every sin that was ever committed because of just taking one little speck of God's word and just misplacing it that's right that's right so now you see how important it is to stay with the word we we get in trouble when we step from behind it that's right yes sir yes sir now if the infinite God a God full of love to misconstrue his word just don't believe all of it just part of it will let all this happen because of just misbelieving a little bit of it I believe we're going to have to take every bit of it back again cuz just muring it saying the Bible said this but honest it doesn't mean that it does mean that see it mean that just that way yes sir so we must keep it that way that's it the way he said it but then ew now we're going to find out as soon as she had to get as soon as he had to get Satan had to get her attention basically right now you remember he's in Warfare with God and men and women is his children so he's in Warfare with Satan so now remember Satan comes down to use a tactic to try to counteract God's welfare his protection he's trying to find something that he can a better weapon that's right so there is no better weapon that he can find so then the only typ that that he could use would be reasoning and when you start to reason anything the word said but let me see that doesn't mean by his christes we were healed that doesn't say it does mean that that's right so my my main thing is to get you to understand yes sir that you got to say what God said you got to say what God Said that's the safest place you can be is is is is what the word [Music] say and it reads on and it says whosoever will well I know the Holy Spirit was for them back in the early days but just reasoning just reasoning tell us that we oh no don't you do that whosoever will to you and your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call see no reasoning don't stop the reason just keep believing just believing what he said well brother Brenham I sought the Holy Ghost for 10 years what you reasoning about if you carried out his plans then just go on then just believe it see he laid down the plan and just follow that plan that's then it's got to come out right right if it isn't then he told something wrong see so he can tell us nothing wrong and still be God so you see you got to believe it it's his word or you don't believe him at all so it's strange isn't it but it's really true it really is the truth right now we find that this great enemy of God now as long as the will long as they will believe that that word I can never get to them as long as that little family in Eden keeps behind word I can never touch them that's right neither can he today amen he's still blocked off that's right but I can use some real good or strategy and just reason out I give some human reasoning because she's human evil was human and if I can just give human reasoning then well well we'll win the battle Satan and his angels but then e gave away so therefore we know our enemy by his attacks that's right maybe you didn't get maybe you didn't get it just right the way I said it we know our enemy when anyone any Spirit any person tries to disagree with God's word remember that's your enemy that's your enemy I don't care who it is that's your enemy we we know his older type that's right that's the one he broke the human race down that's right and that's the way he breaks them down yet today and that's the way he gets you away from God is to just believe his word and the only way that you can ever stand in fellowship with God and talk to him in the cool of the evening is to stay fortified in the word on both sides let the curtain of God's word just drop all around you and you be dropped right in the middle of it that's right then you floridly [Applause] [Music] glory this what Paul said in Galatians 1 verse 8 and N he said but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any gospel unto you that you have receive you have received let him be a curse that's right that's right I got one paragraph I want to use in take on the take on the whole Army of God sir in 1962 and it says paragraph 36 it said not the enemy know as long as the human race stay with the word right he'll never be able to touch them now I'm beginning to feel religious right now as long as the human race stayed with the word god fortified his family on the earth his armor and the fort of his word that's our Fortress the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe they're fortified the Lord is the word they are in their fortified and safe forever more as long as the human race stays in the word long as the church stays in the word it's fortified there's nothing going to bother it so he he's telling you where your safety zone at but but M but what we got to do now we got to pull down these spiritual stron holes of the enemy if it's affecting your life you got to pull it down if if if it's draining your walk you got to pull it down if if you disbelieve in in any the area you got to pull it down and God said you got the power to do that [Applause] now think about the children of Israel when they came out yes now God God gave them 10 signs before they left yes sir 10 10 signs before they left 10 signs sir and when they came [Music] out and they find himself at the Red Sea I now the enemy came in and begin to create stron holes in the mind now what it is that would convince you that God can't take care of you after them 10 signs you you you see how he begin to work on their mind they begin to murm and complain they came to the to the Red Sea and and they looking around like what we going to do you don't you just forgot the 10 signs that fast but see the enemy came in started working in their mind God brought you to the Red Sea now now what he going to do with you what he going to do with you then God come down and splits the Red Sea they walk through on dry [Applause] land I'm talking about the ground was hard as concrete they walk through on dry land and they get through and then they findel complaining again now God just split the Red Sea now you complaining talking about you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hungry now you complaining talking about you hungry you see the tactic of the enemy now now I'm speaking for me in this day now if I would have been there and seen God do all this and split the Red Sea I wouldn't have had no doubt that he couldn't feed [Applause] me and it kept going on and on they got thirsty they wanted water and and and and the enemy tied them up so tight he worked on their mind so tight till they they didn't even realize the very thing that God was trying to show them the prophet of God say we focus on what God already done and we focus on what he going to do but but we don't focus on what he doing see the en the enemy had not got control of their mind so much so they didn't even catch the fight that God was a Creator if they would have caught [Applause] that if they would have caught that one Revelation they would have never worried about anything else they [Applause] needed God was trying to show you that I'm a creator whatever you need I can I can supply he was trying to show them there but the but the strongholds of the enemy blind their mind to what God was doing that's why they went to complaining but not Joshua and [Applause] Caleb Joshua and Caleb kept their mind on the [Applause] word they were fortified behind the word they kept their mind on the word Joshua Kaya knew that they had a promise there was a land over there flowing with milk and honey and they didn't care about no circumstances they kept their mind on the word you see what happen when you keep your mind on the word circumstances don't get you off track now now I'm I'm sure the enemy bother Joshua Caleb but but they stay with the word yeah I see the Red Sea yeah I see it but he also made me a [Applause] promise see they they didn't realize Deliverance coming out of Egypt want all of the Deliverance getting in that land of where the milk and honey was all that was part of the Deliverance so God brought me out if he able to begin a work he's able to perform it so if he brought me out then that land over there he got to take me to it cuz that's part of the deliverance and they didn't catch that they didn't catch that and that's what God does in our lives he he want he wants to show us I'm a Healer I don't care how many times you get sick but if you just catch the fight that I'm a Healer it won't matter how many times you get sick it won't matter what diseases you run into just catch the Revelation that I'm a [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Healer just catch the Revelation and God God has done explain to us he done showed us any word yes sir I'm everything you need I'm when you need healing I'm I'm a Healer when when you need a way I will make a way and and and and you just you stick with that you know and and it don't Le no room for reasoning the devil has no Battleground he has no no no way of getting to you now if you get your Bibles let's let's turn to Second Kings W glory to God hallelujah yes sir second Kings chapter 2 very familiar story yes my brother very familiar story amen second Kings chapter 2 verse one Hallelujah you got to say amen and it reads and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind yes sir that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry here I pray the for the Lord ha sent me to belth and Elisha said Toto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee kind of sound like what Ruth told Naomi sound sound a lot like what Ru told Naomi so they went down to Beth and the sons of the prophets that were at bethle came forth to Elisha yes sir and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord would take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it hold your peace hold your peace so in other words they they were telling Elisha don't don't you know the Lord going going to take your head from you today not what you going to do [Applause] then what you going to do El when he take him you know he leaving today don't what you going to do then I see I see you follow him around what you going to do that's why you need to tell the devil when he come come whispering in your ear you know you got your lck beard do I know it hold your peace when he come just tell tell him I know it hold your peace I'm waiting on my Deliverance I'm waiting on my Deliverance in verse three says and the sons of the prophets that were at belth came forth to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord would take away thy master from thy head today he said y I know it hold your peace verse four and Elijah said Toto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as and thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho now it was something about Elijah that would cause Elisha to not want to leave him that's right it was something he had his eyesight on it was something he wanted and he and he was going to make sure he didn't leave him in verse 5 say and the sons of the Prophet that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said it to him everybody attacking him no th no th that Lord would take away th master from that head today and he answer yeah I know it but again hold your at peace hold your peace and Elijah verse 6 say Elijah said unto him Terry I pray the here for the Lord have sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they two went on so Elisha was not going to let Elijah get out of his sight see in verse seven it says and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went 50 yes sir they went and stood to view a far off yes sir so they they want to see the results I'm going to see what he going to do now when he walk and they stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided hither and the so that they too went over on dry ground yes and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken from thee so so Elijah like Elijah just like you know he he been with me this whole time what do you want what what can I do for you and and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me see what what Elijah was interested in was the god of [Applause] Elijah he he want the god of Elijah Ruth told Naomi your God will be my God and and Elija telling Elijah I'm interested in that God that's in you and you going you going to see in a few minutes and he said verse 10 said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so now that was a promise to Elisha there there go his word that that was the that was the promise Pro of the word to Elijah Elijah told him if you see me if you see me when I go up it will be given to you so that that was his promise so so so now that's what he holding on to Hallelujah and it came to pass as they still went on and Tau that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both of sun and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and and and I can imagine in a bite in the past when when they was telling Elijah he's going to be taken from you you know he said hold he said hold your peace that's you know you you looking at the corner stuff you looking at what you can see but I but I'm looking for something different I'm looking for something different and it came to pass that they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and departed them both for Sund and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the Mount of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mountain of Elijah that fell from him and he smoked the waters and said now listen what he said he said where is the Lord God of Elijah [Music] so that tell you right there what he was looking for he want he wanted the same the God that was in Elijah that's what that's what he wanted in [Applause] him and and and we as Christian we should live a life so tight that the outside world should look at us and say I want that God that's inside of here whatever he got I want it I don't know what it is but whatever it is I want it and and and that's the kind of life that we got to [Applause] [Music] live glory to God the Book of James first chapter verse 12 Hallelujah it said blessed is the man that endureth Temptation right for when he is tried right he shall receive the Crown of Life uhhuh which the Lord hath promised to them that love him yes sir you know that and that that's that's our promise we got a race to we got a race to run I don't I don't have time to focus on every little ISM that that's going on here down here on this Earth I got a race to run and it's going to be a reward at the end and my job is to stay focused and get there I I don't care what happened on the journey I'm going I'm going to fall sometime I'm going to take testes you know what I'm saying but it it's it's it ain't going to take my mind off the prize in 1 Corinthians 10: 13 say there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful he will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you be able to bear it and and we got to we got to take these scriptures to heart so so so when the devil come pouring on you and saying oh you this is unbearable no the scripture said I'm able to Bear it if it made it to you if it made it to you that mean you are able to Bear it according to the [Music] word am I reading it wrong I mean it say you are able to bear so that mean whatever makes it to you God already sought a governor on it he already sought a governor on it it can only go so far sir same the same way he did job he he told Satan yeah you can touch him but you but you can't go no past this you you can do this but you can't do that he he do he do us the same way he sets a govern that way his word won't come back forward and be and because of that that forces God to put this scripture in the Bible that I want put no more on you that you can bear you know why because he said he won't lose none the fact of him telling you that I can't lose none that that that makes that scripture they come into life that I can't put no more on you than you can [Music] bear in the book of Isaiah chapter 53: 5 amen amen said but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his scripes we are healed that's word that's your protection that's your Fortress Isaiah 43:2 you know I'm just giving you encouraging scriptures to let you know our answers in the word this is our protection and when you when you find yourself battling these things go back to the word yeah the answer is right here in the word and you got to hold on to it Isaiah 43 CH 43:2 it said when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee that's sir and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and where thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon theeen and and I'm trying to come to a closeall and and and and the these things is is is you need to print them in your heart yes and and by the grace of God in closing I'm I'm I'm going to show you how how a Believer is once he's fortified behind the word once he know he's he's he's protected fully protected with the word let's turn to psalms 27 let's turn to Psalm 27 now this is for the Bel Believers this is for the Believers and see D like I said earlier David got to a place when he knew that God was his Fortress he was his protection he was his shield and he and he recognized that the enemy couldn't get to him and and and it and and and it put him in this position and he said the Lord is my light that's it and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid and and I I can see David just just behind the stron holdes of the word and and he just on the inside looking out and and and he's saying when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fail that's right and and and these are the thing that that David is witnessing while he's behind the protection of the word I I see the enemy coming and try to TP but I'm also watching him fall I see him coming from the side but I'm also watching him fall so he he's in a good place right now and and that's what you got to do you got to get fortified behind the word so you can just sit back and watch the dev I seen you coming but it didn't work I see you trying but it ain't going to work and and that's the place where David got to and he in in verse three he said though and hoost should have Camp against me my heart should not fear I'm not going to fear though War should rise against me and this will I be confident I'm going to be confident God is going to protect me I'm going to be confident God God is going to give me a w and Escape sir and one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord hear ye oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou say Seek Ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I see hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not David saying I like where I'm at right now Lord don't leave me back here stay where you at Lord keep protecting me don't leave me neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies deliver me not over into the will of my enemies for false Witnesses are rising up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I have fainted unless I had to believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the [Applause] [Music] Lord there's no reason why any believers should be bound tonight Hall with all this word we got this you shouldn't be bound amen I just I just want to let you know it's the tactic of the enemy right I don't care what the doctor report said I no no no no we don't care about that we look into the scripture of healing into the scripture of healing let us stand let us pray dear Lord Jesus Lord God I have said everything that you wanted to say Lord God I pray that you will free your children tonight Lord all my brothers and sisters oh God I pray that you free them tonight oh Lord from the enemy from the strongholds of the enemy every stronghold the en of the enemy it's the opposite of what God said it's the reverse of what God Said but Lord God teach us oh God to hold on to your word it's what your word said oh God and that we would get a mentality oh God and and and we can walk around and say God said and and look the enemy in the face and say God didn't say that and let us hold on to the word oh God and look to the word for our protection Lord God and look nowhere else oh oh Father Lord God as we leave from here oh God give us a

God amen amen amen amen amen did you enjoy the [Applause] word Oh Glory to God amen amen amen Amen brother Glenn he knows how to take a flight and land the airplane right on time amen what a masterpiece tonight glory to God Amen the enemy one has distracted but God want you to focus amen can I read something to you do you want me to you good brother Joshua brother Joshua say yes oh Glory he came to me when he was preaching but I just want to share amen open first king chapter 19 oh glory to God praise God first king chapter 19 if you dare you can say amen I believe brother Raj the pray for you already and we believe God will touch you and restore you let's go to first king chapter 19 verse 16 it's a convention so let's see something here amen because this word keep opening up all the time if you thereare you can say Amen first king 19:16 this is Elijah going to the mountain and then when he went to the mountain God spoke to him after he killed the prophet of baale he went and he seen the earthquake and all those things and then there were a still Small Voice that came and the Lord spoke to Elijah and notice here when God is speaking to Elijah Elisha is not here I want you to notice something verse 16 God says this he says and jiu the son of Nima shall that anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha the son of japat of Abel Abel Meola shall that anoint to be prophet in that room so God met with Elijah alone and gave Elijah the promise of Elisha when Elisha have not even started his ministry with Elijah is my Bible different than your Bible do you want me to continue or you want to go home Elisha is not here Elisha is not even aware of this amen but God already gave his Word of Promise that the replacement the one who will replace Elijah is Elisha so technically speaking the anointing of Elijah is [Applause] guaranteed to Elisha when Elisha was still working with Ox so your position was already guaranteed before you come in the work of the Lord before Elisha begin to serve the Lord God already gave a promise God gave his position and God gave his anointing and Elisha was not aware of that anointing are we together do you want me to continue do you want me to continue I want you to understand these things clearly number one Elisha was not aware that God have something in store for him you want to stand or sit stand so ah praise God so Elisha was not aware that God already have something for him and he was not even aware of the caliber that God about him nobody you it's you don't take anyone to replace Elijah because Elijah was a major prophet but look at this little bit of man working over there in a warehouse somewhere packing boxes did know that you are the one to replace Elijah are we together do you see Elisha here let's see what happened are we together jum to verse uh 19 the Bible say so he departed then Elijah yes sir and found Elisha the son of shaat who was plowing normal work with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he with the 12 one number 12 worship and Elijah passed by him and his mantle upon him he didn't pray for him he didn't do anything somebody's working maybe putting boxes in a big truck and elishah just took his jacket off and thre to Elijah amen watch what happened verse 20 and he left the oxen who talked to him verse 12 20 and he left the oxen and run after Elijah and say let me appr pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again what have I done unto thee in other word what's wrong with you my question is who taught Elijah who talked to Elijah Elisha all they did is throw something there but that me had a message I don't know if you get there everybody that was there maybe saw the mantle hidden but Elijah didn't see the manle he heard something and he understood something and because he understood he went to Elisha and said you know what I'm going to leave everything and I'm going to follow you who told you to follow Elijah how did he get the message how did he understand are we together because God will do things in this church but you need to be able to understand what God is speaking with speaking are we together sir are we together if you truly CAU the Revelation it will make you behave different sir maybe somebody will look and say this man through the Garment and you following him did he tell you to follow him that message was only for one person are we together are we together let's go to second king chapter 9 I just want you to see this and I'm going to let you go home second king chapter 1 the promise belong to Elijah God already promised to Elisha it is his position it is his anointing it is his place and all they did they took him under the ministry of Elijah and and he begin to minister to Elijah 10 Years brother Bram says amen and during 10 years God allow him to sit and to see the power yes to see the 10 Sons to see so many example how God is working in the ministry of Elijah to cause him Amen to begin to desire what was already for him I don't know if you know you understand what I'm saying God put him on next to what he needed the very thing that you were looking at God put you next to it so that the longer you spend time with it it begin to create an attraction it begin to create a pool it begin to create it begin to bring your attention to be focus on this his attention was no longer oxen no longer the job that he was working but now his attention is brought throughout his Destiny are we together are we together second king chapter 9 drop to verse 9 if you dare I mean sorry 2 King chapter 2:9 if you dare you can say Amen all of this came and I was sitting right there are we together verse n we there now remember when he's following Elijah amen Elijah himself tried to block him sir Elisha knew the Revelation but elishah turned around and say you know what you stay here but there was already something created in Elisha that even Elijah could not stop it are we together what belongs to you even God himself won't stop you I don't know if you get what I'm saying amen everybody knew that Elijah was going amen but they only knew by information but they didn't have the revelation of the going people may quote this message but they can quote this message as an information but you need to know this message more than an information to you it's a life you know it but why are you not following Elijah because the promise did not belong to them I don't know if you get what I'm saying you are following what belongs to you so don't expect everybody to walk with you Hall your promise is not a collective promise it is an individual promise in other word when you hold on to something don't expect to receive support from everybody matter of fact they are people who discourage you but because he belong to you there is something Supernatural that is beyond you will push you toward it are we together are we together verse 9 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says I'm just backing him up of what he preached amen the Bible says in verse 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah say unto elishah ask what I shall do to thee before I be taken away what should Elijah ask if you notice even though the promise belonged to him Elijah told him ask so you are asking something that already belong to you you didn't get it my friend so when you come to God and you say I want to be healed you need to know first that that healing already belong to you that's the reason why I'm asking I don't know if you get what I'm saying I am not just asking this marriage like this I already know it for me that's the reason why I'm asking Lord help Mercy he say ask what I shall do for thee therefore before I be taken away from thee amen and elishah say I pray thee let a double portion of that Spirit be upon you why didn't he ask anything except that spirit because God already spoke that Elisha will be the one replacing Elijah so what was coming out from his mouth amen is nothing but what already spoke when he was not even dead are we together this is where I want you to see verse 10 and he said Elijah thou has asked an easy thing you ask what hard based on what I'm asking you a question it's hard based on what because God already said that elishah will take the place of Elijah so why is he hard it should not be hard what I'm trying to say is what you think it's hard for you to get just know it's not hard when you hit a wall in your life and something looks to be super hard this is a confirmation that it belongs to me [Music] amen hallelujah oh glory to God he says and he says th have asked hard things nevertheless if thou see me when I'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so in other word keep your focus on me keep your focus on the promise the promise already belong to you the pull of the promise is already pulling you you are already asking for the promise it is not going to be anything too hard for the Lord because the Bible say is there anything too hard for the Lord it is not too hard for you because it belongs to you all you have to do is keep the pro focus focus on your promise sir don't listen to the devil focus on your promise don't go under destraction focus on your promise this is what God is telling you tonight what are you trying to say I'm going to finish by this my friend and you go home brother brandham say in the message the everpresent word in 1961 uh July 23rd in the morning paragraph 121 brother Bram say that is what power is in the church now but it control by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it is a law of Faith that's right yes sir Jesus say all things yes sir are possible to them that believe in other word there is nothing too hard amen and if you can believe it you ready what whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is [Music] yours can I repeat it again whatever the Lord will lead your soul to believe it is yours the soul of Elia was led to ask to believe for the double portion because the portion belongs to him in other words that pool that attraction is a son that he already belonged to [Music] you when I'm saying this there are things that belong to me and don't belong to you so I'm not waiting for you to uh agree with me if you agree that fan if you don't agree maybe it doesn't belong to you but it belongs to me because I feel the pull in my heart that I need to have that one you don't feel the pool maybe you're not part of it so don't block me move out of my [Applause] way are we together let me finish with this brother Brown I'm say every place that the soul of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you am amen it is yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that Ops that open it to you you see what I mean the power is control if you are a son of God you are a Daughters of a daughter of God that never leaves you it is with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but he still there Hallelujah why did Elisha focus on his promise because he belongs to him he was not there in M caramel but something within him was puling saying this belong to me and any obstacle that came against him from the brother from the sons of the Prophet to tell him that you're not going to get it you talking about this third pool third pool you're not going to get that third pull you can say all you want that was only for brother brother Bram told me the pillar of fire that work with him is also with me so you must stay where you are you can be spectator but as for me and my house as for me and this church we will cross Jord we will keep our eyes focused on the word I don't care how hard the promises are but those promises belong to us because there is a deep that is calling to the deep and if there is deep that is calling to the Deep there must be a deep to respond to it and I believe what I want is coming because this is the year stay focused on the word stay focused on the promise God is not a man to lie nor a son of man to repent what God say he will fulfill it believe it and accepted God richly bless you may you go home in peace brother said [Music] amen and amen amen amen I want to take this song we've got the power in the name of Jesus amen amen we've got the power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the
