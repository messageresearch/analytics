[24:37] test and i was like
[24:39] wow it wasn't even that hard like the

[25:17] i wanna i wanna mention i got a red
[25:21] light on this is it the battery
[25:24] amen god bless everybody i wanna just
[25:26] share this testimony because
[25:30] last wednesday working at the church
[25:33] went in as normal
[25:34] we had some contractors working in the
[25:35] back of the building
[25:37] and they had some issues with some wasps
[25:40] so as soon as i got there they wanted to
[25:42] get some raspberry
[25:44] so i opened the building went in there
[25:46] put my things down
[25:49] locked it back and ran to walmart
[25:52] to get the spray for them when i got
[25:54] back i gave it to them and
[25:55] they see that settle that is you never
[25:57] came back to get back in the building
[26:00] put my hand in my pocket no key
[26:04] say no i can't do that i checked every
[26:06] pocket nokia said my god no man this
[26:10] can't happen
[26:11] brother greg was supposed to come to
[26:12] help me work
[26:14] and my son was supposed to be there also
[26:16] and i can't get in the building and
[26:18] it's it's critical we have to get stuff
[26:19] done
[26:21] so i went to the truck i said i'm trying
[26:23] to figure what to do lord
[26:24] where could possibly this key be
[26:27] i'm very you know methodical about stuff
[26:30] because i hate losing stuff
[26:31] and i always put in this pocket and it's
[26:34] not there and say hello that's what i
[26:36] call a locksmith
[26:39] super great cause i said well the place
[26:41] is locked i'm locked out man
[26:43] so long story short i finally decided
[26:46] that cobra might
[26:47] so i went to charlotte got his key and
[26:48] got in the building because i had locked
[26:50] it in the building
[26:52] i went in there nothing said god where's
[26:55] this key
[26:56] ah went back around the building walked
[26:59] around retraced my footsteps nothing
[27:03] so i was feeling very you know disturbed
[27:06] about that because i hate losing keys
[27:09] so i prayed about it and i remembered
[27:12] a couple saturdays ago with charles iii
[27:16] he had lost his key and he came and gave
[27:18] the testimony how
[27:20] the lord you know used brother kelly to
[27:21] get the key for him
[27:23] was actually when i went there this
[27:24] saturday to pick up the the tent
[27:26] i just saw the key laying on the grass
[27:28] just clearly
[27:30] and i picked it up and said this looks
[27:31] like his can give to berkeley and he
[27:32] brought to him
[27:34] so the ideas came to my head and said
[27:35] lord you
[27:37] had allowed me to find his keys
[27:42] and get it through brother kelly to get
[27:44] to him i said lord i need that
[27:47] now i need that same help
[27:50] somewhere in this universe you know
[27:52] exactly where that kid i can't find it
[27:54] i can't go back to walmart i'm just at a
[27:57] loss
[27:59] so i got a copy i made a second copy but
[28:03] but the other key that's missing is the
[28:04] key for the mailbox and there's only one
[28:06] of that
[28:07] trying to figure out how to break into
[28:08] the mailbox just a bunch of stuff
[28:12] so i just i said
[28:15] i can't i didn't really initial um you
[28:18] know
[28:19] articulate the words that i'm thinking
[28:22] just how
[28:22] myself kelly and charles was involved in
[28:26] that fine
[28:27] i need that same kind of help and he
[28:30] just came to me with brother kelly
[28:32] so yesterday brothers went to clean up
[28:36] at the back of the church
[28:38] so cold broccoli is how they were doing
[28:39] he said um everything's going all right
[28:42] and we're supposed to be there
[28:43] shortly and i found a bunch of keys
[28:46] i said what
[28:49] i said is the orange key he said yes i
[28:52] was
[28:52] elated so by the time i got to church he
[28:56] threw it for me i quote and said oh
[28:58] my god thank god for he found it right
[29:01] at the entrance where i passed thursday
[29:04] friday back and forth and he just
[29:07] thought on the grasses so thank god for
[29:10] that
[29:12] god it's good amen
[29:18] well you know i'll give one real quick
[29:20] last year you know
[29:21] um my wife and i had coveted in december
[29:24] but rebecca had it all the way back at
[29:25] last
[29:26] july and any time
[29:29] from what i understand that your body
[29:31] especially for a lady
[29:33] anytime that their body goes to an
[29:35] extreme fever
[29:38] they lose their hair and it was it was
[29:40] evident with both
[29:42] both of them and you know um
[29:46] rebecca went to the pastor and said
[29:48] would you pray that my hair grows back
[29:50] this is her glory right this is her
[29:52] glory
[29:53] will you pray for it well
[29:56] it's been growing it looks kind of you
[29:59] know
[30:00] kind of we compare to my older brother
[30:02] because he's got real
[30:04] kind of shaggy hair but you know it
[30:06] looks like sometimes she has bangs and
[30:08] we're like no you're not growing bangs
[30:09] it's just your hair growing back so it's
[30:11] growing back and i think
[30:12] you know some of my wife as well but god
[30:15] doesn't want her without the glory
[30:17] you know so we praise god for that
[30:22] amen

[31:21] so a lot of times we take care of
[31:23] patients and nothing

[31:29] but then there are particular times when
[31:31] you take care of a patient and something
[31:33] just
[31:33] hits you yesterday i was taking care of
[31:36] a 46 year old man
[31:40] who reminded me of my brother i have a
[31:42] brother who follows me who is also 46.
[31:46] he is so sick he needs god
[31:52] they put i'm not sure if you're aware of
[31:55] ecma
[31:56] where they bypass your lungs and put it
[31:59] in a machine

[32:14] help him
[32:17] and i just asked for prayers for him
[32:21] i mean there are many patients in the
[32:22] hospital but
[32:24] if you could just remember him his name

[32:27] so long he's of indian descent so i
[32:30] couldn't even pronounce his name i was
[32:32] just

[33:16] guarantee
[33:18] yes so all year long and is now coming
[33:22] back
[33:23] it's like daily you handle those people
[33:27] if you are not god's grace i will not
[33:31] sometimes i wanted even to excuse myself
[33:33] and ask
[33:34] as if they could allow me not to work
[33:37] with covered patients because of my age
[33:40] and they said no
[33:44] secondly i want thank god i've been
[33:46] praying
[33:48] for a job that can allow me to have time

[1:11:16] what do you want to do with trees
[1:11:19] matthew 13 but don't worry i already
[1:11:22] know them by the scripture
[1:11:27] another parable put him forth
[1:11:31] to them saying if i'm not mistaken
[1:11:34] matthew 13 have
[1:11:36] seven parables
[1:11:39] and if we get into them you're going to
[1:11:42] see the seven church ages lining up like
[1:11:44] this
[1:11:44] in one chapter there's seven parable in
[1:11:46] matthew 13
[1:11:48] we're just pulling one okay
[1:11:51] the opening of the seventh seal
[1:11:55] another you go home you're gonna count
[1:11:57] them
[1:11:59] another parable put here forth to them
[1:12:02] saying the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:05] is like to a man which saweth
[1:12:08] good seed in the in his field
[1:12:12] you can sit down there is a field
[1:12:17] and that field belong to the good man
[1:12:21] and do you know who the good man is
[1:12:24] you know him right because the rich
[1:12:27] young ruler when he say good master
[1:12:29] jesus said who is good but who
[1:12:32] so there is a man that i have a field
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:36] that man the owner of the field
[1:12:39] which is god everybody clear
[1:12:42] has good seed
[1:12:46] he has seeds and those seeds are good
[1:12:49] you need to be
[1:12:50] really really tight today because i am
[1:12:53] taking off
[1:12:55] amen but verse 25
[1:12:59] while he slept his enemy so there is a
[1:13:03] second person here
[1:13:05] who is the enemy anybody clear
[1:13:09] i know you've seen this before but stay
[1:13:12] tight
[1:13:13] his enemy came and saw the tears
[1:13:18] among the wheat so the good seed are
[1:13:20] wheat
[1:13:22] everybody the wheat
[1:13:26] and the enemy which we know is satan
[1:13:30] has also some seed and they are bad seed
[1:13:34] because this one is good
[1:13:36] and he sees our tears the serpent seed
[1:13:41] right here in the scripture but when
[1:13:44] the blood was sprung up and brought
[1:13:47] forth fruit
[1:13:49] then appeared the tales also so the
[1:13:52] servant of the householder
[1:13:54] came and said to him sir did not use so
[1:13:58] good seed in your field it belongs to
[1:14:00] him
[1:14:01] from where then has its tears
[1:14:04] he said to them an enemy has done this
[1:14:08] the servant said to him will you then
[1:14:10] that we go
[1:14:11] and gather them up but he said nay
[1:14:14] lest while you gather up the tears you
[1:14:17] ruled up the wheat from them
[1:14:20] let both grow together until
[1:14:23] the harvest there is a harvest and
[1:14:26] in the time of harvest i was saying
[1:14:30] to the reapers gather you together first
[1:14:33] details they must be bound first
[1:14:36] and bind them in bundle to be water
[1:14:40] so the purpose of the tears according
[1:14:44] to the owner of the field is fire
[1:14:48] is burning
[1:14:52] you need to understand this stuff about
[1:14:55] clear
[1:14:56] to be burned and bind them in bottle
[1:14:59] in bundle to be burned to burn them
[1:15:02] but gather their wheat into my water
[1:15:05] brother branham call that the rapture
[1:15:10] one is going to be burned one is going
[1:15:12] to be raptured anybody clear
[1:15:15] that's finished now jump to verse 36
[1:15:19] then jesus sent the multitude away
[1:15:22] and went into the house and his disciple
[1:15:26] came to him
[1:15:27] saying declare to us the parable
[1:15:31] of the tares of the field jesus
[1:15:35] gave them a lot of parables but out of
[1:15:39] all those parables there was something
[1:15:41] about
[1:15:42] this specific one that pricked the heart
[1:15:46] of the disciple and the disciples were
[1:15:48] really
[1:15:49] interested on this one more than the
[1:15:52] other one
[1:15:53] amen verse 37 he
[1:15:56] answered and said to them he that soweth
[1:16:00] the good seed is who
[1:16:03] so the owner or god is the son of man
[1:16:09] anybody clear is the son of man
[1:16:13] come up oh say my calm
[1:16:16] the field is the water
[1:16:19] so this field is the world
[1:16:22] filled equal the world that's why when
[1:16:26] they say
[1:16:27] israel was a man of the field
[1:16:30] it means he was a worldly man
[1:16:36] right makes sense now if you go in the
[1:16:38] old testament you will see the bible say
[1:16:40] esau was a man of the field
[1:16:42] the field is the world in other words
[1:16:45] esau was a carnal man
[1:16:48] but random never give you that scripture
[1:16:51] the message is perfectly in line with
[1:16:54] the scripture
[1:16:55] anybody clear he answered and said to
[1:16:58] them he that served the good seed is the
[1:17:00] son of man
[1:17:01] they filled this the world the good seed
[1:17:04] are the water
[1:17:07] so the seed of god are the children of
[1:17:10] god
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] seed means children
[1:17:22] amen are the children of the kingdom
[1:17:27] but the tares are the children
[1:17:30] of the water remember cain
[1:17:33] was of the wicked one
[1:17:36] so we have children of god and also
[1:17:40] children of the devil
[1:17:50] scripture not even a quote yet
[1:17:53] anybody clear verse 39
[1:17:56] the enemy that soweth them is who
[1:18:00] satan their harvest is the end of the
[1:18:03] world
[1:18:04] and the reapers are the angels everybody
[1:18:08] clear
[1:18:09] let's go to john chapter 18.
[1:18:12] just bear with me let me land this plane
[1:18:16] where i want it to
[1:18:17] amen because if you don't understand
[1:18:21] these two principle you're not going to
[1:18:24] understand the second death
[1:18:26] i can give you a description it's in the
[1:18:28] scripture the bible say the second death
[1:18:30] is the lake of fire
[1:18:32] it's in this bible what does the lake of
[1:18:35] fire mean
[1:18:38] what is the lake of fire is he our fire
[1:18:41] or a different fire
[1:18:44] see now
[1:18:47] john chapter 18 verse 36 if you're there
[1:18:50] you can say
[1:18:51] amen answered my
[1:18:54] kingdom is not of this world
[1:18:58] so this honor and this enemy
[1:19:02] these children are talking about two
[1:19:06] kingdoms
[1:19:09] and both kingdoms have a head
[1:19:12] and a children and a servant a head
[1:19:17] children and servant
[1:19:20] a head god
[1:19:23] children the children of god and servant
[1:19:27] the angels anybody clear
[1:19:31] a head satan children of the devil
[1:19:35] servants are demons
[1:19:39] two kingdoms we clear now
[1:19:44] my kingdom is not of this world if my
[1:19:47] kingdom were of this world
[1:19:49] then would my servant fight
[1:19:53] that i should not be delivered to the
[1:19:55] jews
[1:19:56] but now is my kingdom not from here he's
[1:19:59] talking to pilate
[1:20:01] pilate therefore said to him are you
[1:20:04] a king then jesus answered
[1:20:08] you say that i am a king in other words
[1:20:11] i am a king
[1:20:13] to this and was i born
[1:20:17] and for this course came i into the
[1:20:19] world
[1:20:21] that i should bear witness of the truth
[1:20:24] watch carefully now everyone
[1:20:28] that is off the water the truth do what
[1:20:34] so for you to hear the voice of god
[1:20:37] you must be a child of the truth
[1:20:43] make sense it is those
[1:20:46] that came out of the truth that can
[1:20:50] hear the truth
[1:20:54] not everybody will hear the truth
[1:20:58] you must be born of the truth
[1:21:01] for you to hear the truth
[1:21:05] so these wit here are children
[1:21:09] of the truth
[1:21:13] let's go to second thessalonians chapter
[1:21:16] two
[1:21:18] it's going to get yummy here
[1:21:23] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:29] when we have service make sure you sleep
[1:21:31] on time eat
[1:21:32] good so when you come you relax
[1:21:39] and then we load you you go home and you
[1:21:41] digest till wednesday
[1:21:44] 2nd thessalonians chapter 2 if you dare
[1:21:47] you can say amen
[1:21:49] verse 8 and then shall that wicked one
[1:21:53] remember the children of the wicked one
[1:21:55] be revealed
[1:21:57] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:22:00] spirit of his mouth that's another
[1:22:01] problem there
[1:22:05] let me leave it alone and shall destroy
[1:22:08] with the brightness of his coming
[1:22:11] even him that wicked one whose coming
[1:22:15] is after the working of who satan
[1:22:19] with all power and sons
[1:22:22] and lying wonders and with all
[1:22:24] deceivableness
[1:22:26] of our righteousness in them that do
[1:22:29] water
[1:22:30] so the people that usually perish
[1:22:34] have something in them
[1:22:39] let me continue they have something in
[1:22:42] them
[1:22:43] that help them perish
[1:22:48] amen because they receive
[1:22:51] not the water the love of the truth that
[1:22:56] there might be water
[1:22:58] so for you to be saved you must first be
[1:23:02] a child
[1:23:02] of the truth and for you to
[1:23:06] be saved you must receive the
[1:23:09] love of the truth
[1:23:15] in other words a child of the truth
[1:23:19] everybody clear is a child that have
[1:23:22] been
[1:23:23] loaded with the love of the truth
[1:23:30] that's why you hate iniquity
[1:23:34] when somebody is treating somebody wrong
[1:23:36] you just feel in your heart that this
[1:23:37] is not right
[1:23:41] and somebody else is having pleasure
[1:23:43] into that
[1:23:44] like go ahead get him get him get him
[1:23:46] and you look like i don't think this is
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:49] what makes you act like that
[1:23:57] you you have a problem knowing if you're
[1:24:00] a child of god
[1:24:01] you're gonna know it today
[1:24:06] before you leave this building you're
[1:24:09] gonna know which seed you are
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:15] hallelujah we're sick of playing church
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] and for this cause god
[1:24:23] shall send them a waters
[1:24:27] who's sending data
[1:24:32] that they should believe in water so
[1:24:35] when somebody believe
[1:24:37] a lie they have something in them
[1:24:40] helping them to believe a liar
[1:24:48] am i reading a different bible than
[1:24:49] yourself
[1:24:51] okay that day all might be water
[1:24:57] why are they them
[1:25:00] why why god cannot save them
[1:25:07] that there may be them who believe not
[1:25:10] in the water how are they going to
[1:25:12] believe the truth
[1:25:14] because they don't have the love of the
[1:25:16] truth
[1:25:21] but head water that's why when they do
[1:25:25] something wrong
[1:25:26] they like it
[1:25:29] they like the shooting stuff killing
[1:25:33] stuff
[1:25:34] making somebody bad they like that they
[1:25:37] enjoy it
[1:25:37] when they kill people intentionally they
[1:25:40] like it there's something in them that
[1:25:42] like that
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:48] but they have pleasure in
[1:25:50] unrighteousness
[1:25:52] but we are bound we
[1:25:56] are bound to give thank to who
[1:26:00] to give thanks to god for you
[1:26:03] brethren beloved of the lord because
[1:26:06] god why do we give thanks for you
[1:26:09] because
[1:26:09] god from water from the beginning
[1:26:16] god has from the beginning do what
[1:26:20] chosen you to water you were
[1:26:24] chosen to be saved
[1:26:29] even if you don't like it you're going
[1:26:31] to be saved
[1:26:34] it doesn't depend on you it depends on
[1:26:38] who took the decision for you
[1:26:49] what else do you have to do to be safe
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:56] hallelujah chosen you to salvation
[1:27:01] through sanctification of the water and
[1:27:04] belief of the water that's why you
[1:27:06] believe the truth
[1:27:08] sometimes it doesn't make sense
[1:27:13] hallelujah verse 14
[1:27:16] where to he called you by our water
[1:27:21] so when the gospel goes it's somebody's
[1:27:24] calling you
[1:27:25] somebody's hearing the sermon somebody
[1:27:28] else is hearing a call
[1:27:32] anybody clear to the obtaining of the
[1:27:35] glory
[1:27:36] of our lord jesus christ therefore verse
[1:27:40] 15
[1:27:41] brethren stand fast
[1:27:45] and hold the water the tradition
[1:27:48] which you have been taught whether by

[1:28:10] taught whether by water
[1:28:14] tapes

[1:29:19] from this place
[1:29:20] may you come and speak to your children

[1:29:32] may you come lord father and lift up
[1:29:35] your children
[1:29:36] to the dimension lord of the heavenly
[1:29:38] places
[1:29:39] in christ jesus father we ambly ask it
[1:29:42] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:29:46] god bless you we are on part three
[1:29:50] we start with the second banquet of
[1:29:53] esther
[1:29:54] number one was the mystery of death you
[1:29:56] understand
[1:29:57] why we have to go through that number
[1:30:00] two
[1:30:00] we spoke about the first death number
[1:30:03] three today
[1:30:05] we are entering the second death
[1:30:08] like i said it's very easy to go in the
[1:30:11] scripture
[1:30:12] to look at the definition of the second
[1:30:14] death the second death is the lake of
[1:30:16] fire
[1:30:17] everybody have that every church
[1:30:21] can read that because it's written in
[1:30:24] the scripture
[1:30:25] but what is the lake of fire
[1:30:29] amen what is the lake of fire
[1:30:33] what has the lake of fire to do with us
[1:30:37] anybody clear so to understand the lake
[1:30:40] of fire
[1:30:42] we need two things in other words to
[1:30:45] understand the second death
[1:30:48] we need two things number one
[1:30:51] we need to understand what is the origin
[1:30:54] of people
[1:30:58] number two we need to understand the
[1:31:01] resurrection
[1:31:04] everybody clear we are digging deep now
[1:31:08] today we're gonna handle the origin
[1:31:12] anybody clear when you understand the
[1:31:15] origin and the resurrection
[1:31:17] when we enter the second death you're
[1:31:19] gonna know what it means
[1:31:21] what is our origin last sunday we spoke
[1:31:25] with found out that man
[1:31:27] is made of three parts the body
[1:31:30] the soul and the spirit and we found
[1:31:33] that these three parts have
[1:31:35] been divided into two different aspects
[1:31:38] the spiritual man which have the spirit
[1:31:41] and the soul
[1:31:42] and then the natural man which have the
[1:31:44] body or the clothing
[1:31:46] or the tabernacle or the other garment
[1:31:49] everybody clear and then we found out
[1:31:51] that death
[1:31:52] itself also come into two aspects
[1:31:56] death come in the spiritual aspect and
[1:31:59] in the natural aspect of the literal
[1:32:01] aspect
[1:32:02] in the literal or natural aspect when we
[1:32:05] started
[1:32:06] we touched the first death and we found
[1:32:09] out that the first death affected
[1:32:11] the body everybody clear brother bonham
[1:32:14] says
[1:32:14] here in the pergamos churches he says
[1:32:17] that if there
[1:32:18] is one death and we know about it
[1:32:21] then there is got to be another death
[1:32:24] somewhere
[1:32:25] because one death we die in here is
[1:32:28] in uh we diet here in the flesh
[1:32:32] the second death we diet in the water
[1:32:35] in the spirit commander soul
[1:32:38] so if man is made out of
[1:32:42] three elements which is body soul and
[1:32:45] spirit
[1:32:46] and the first death destroyed the body
[1:32:49] everybody clear
[1:32:52] the second death here brother branham
[1:32:54] say is for the destruction
[1:32:56] of the spirit and the soul in other
[1:33:00] words
[1:33:00] if you want to destroy an individual
[1:33:03] completely if you want to inaudible
[1:33:07] somebody if you wanna make somebody
[1:33:10] disappear
[1:33:11] completely you must give him the first
[1:33:15] death and the second death
[1:33:18] ever clear so far i'm clamping so keep
[1:33:21] your seat belt
[1:33:22] ever clear in matthew 10 verse 28
[1:33:26] the bible say and fear not them which
[1:33:29] can cure
[1:33:30] the by which killed the body that's the
[1:33:32] devil that's the highest he can go
[1:33:34] remember but are not able to kill the
[1:33:38] water
[1:33:39] so the only person that can kill
[1:33:42] the soul of somebody is the lord jesus
[1:33:45] christ
[1:33:46] ever clear so you might be dead in the
[1:33:49] body
[1:33:50] but you are still alive somewhere so
[1:33:53] to destroy you completely you must be
[1:33:56] destroyed in the body
[1:33:58] and in the spirit and the soul you must
[1:34:01] have the first
[1:34:02] death and the second death anybody can
[1:34:06] hear so far
[1:34:07] he said but are not able to kill the
[1:34:10] soul
[1:34:11] but rather feel him which is able to
[1:34:13] destroy both what
[1:34:15] the soul and the body in water keep the
[1:34:19] hell in mind
[1:34:20] luke 12 and i say unto you my friends
[1:34:24] be not afraid of them that can kill the
[1:34:26] body and after that
[1:34:28] have no more that they can do that's all
[1:34:30] the devil can do but i will forewarn you
[1:34:34] whom you shall feel because when they
[1:34:36] kill you you enter the sixth dimension
[1:34:39] and nothing enters the sixth dimension
[1:34:41] except water
[1:34:44] can the devil have perfect love
[1:34:47] so he's doomed he's finished everybody
[1:34:51] okay but i will follow on you whom you
[1:34:54] shall feel
[1:34:55] feel him which after he has killed
[1:34:58] you physically physically have power to
[1:35:02] cast into water
[1:35:03] so to destroy somebody completely you
[1:35:06] must give him the first and the second
[1:35:08] death
[1:35:09] if he only get the first death he's
[1:35:11] still alive somewhere
[1:35:14] but we don't want on them everybody here
[1:35:19] if a soul died behold all souls
[1:35:22] are mine as the soul of the father
[1:35:27] so also the soul of the son is mine
[1:35:30] the soul that sinneth is shall water
[1:35:34] so a soul can die but who can kill the
[1:35:37] soul
[1:35:38] only god they saw that sin if he shall
[1:35:41] die
[1:35:42] the son shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:35:45] the father
[1:35:46] neither shall the father bear the
[1:35:48] iniquity of the son
[1:35:51] the righteousness of the rapture shall
[1:35:53] be
[1:35:54] upon him and the wickedness of the
[1:35:56] wicked shall be upon him in other words
[1:35:59] everybody must be responsible for their
[1:36:01] own life
[1:36:03] but if the wicked will turn from all his
[1:36:06] sin
[1:36:07] that he had committed and keep on my
[1:36:10] statute
[1:36:11] and do what is lawful and while he shall
[1:36:14] surely
[1:36:15] leave he shall not water so we
[1:36:18] understand here that a soul can die
[1:36:20] so the second death actually applied to
[1:36:24] the spiritual
[1:36:25] part of a man because the second death
[1:36:29] killed the spirit
[1:36:30] and the soul but to understand this
[1:36:34] death we must understand
[1:36:37] the mystery of our origin
[1:36:40] you ready praise god
[1:36:44] if you didn't back up i'm not
[1:36:46] responsible for that
[1:36:48] anybody clear there is a circle here
[1:36:52] this circle is called eternity make sure
[1:36:56] you stay awake
[1:36:59] make sure you stay awake
[1:37:02] everybody clear this circle here is
[1:37:06] called
[1:37:06] eternity when we say eternity
[1:37:11] eternity doesn't have an end
[1:37:15] you follow me eternity you cannot
[1:37:18] pinpoint
[1:37:19] the beginning and you cannot pinpoint
[1:37:22] the
[1:37:22] end on eternity everybody here
[1:37:25] when you study math in school
[1:37:28] they show you a line where they were
[1:37:31] saying for me
[1:37:32] minus infinity to plus
[1:37:35] infinity eternity is not like that
[1:37:39] you follow me eternity is something that
[1:37:43] doesn't have
[1:37:44] an end in other words negative
[1:37:47] infinity and positive infinity
[1:37:50] are all blending in eternity
[1:37:55] are you following me the way our brain
[1:37:58] has been structured we have been
[1:38:01] structured
[1:38:02] to think in the plain way
[1:38:07] make sure you stay awake if you look at
[1:38:10] the earth
[1:38:12] the earth is round about clear
[1:38:16] how can we be standing straight when the
[1:38:18] earth is round
[1:38:22] anybody here when you look at the map of
[1:38:25] the earth
[1:38:26] they're going to show you africa here
[1:38:28] they show you america here
[1:38:30] and it goes all around so which side is
[1:38:33] the up
[1:38:34] and which side is the down so when we
[1:38:37] are standing straight here
[1:38:39] are we standing straight like this or a
[1:38:42] mass straight
[1:38:43] on the earth like this or am i upside
[1:38:45] down
[1:38:47] have you ever thought about it ever here
[1:38:50] if you leave gastonia and you continue
[1:38:53] to go towards charlotte
[1:38:54] everything is playing plan plan play and
[1:38:56] playing play because our brains were
[1:38:59] wired
[1:39:02] to look at things in the plain way
[1:39:05] are you following me everybody clear
[1:39:10] our brain were wired to work with the
[1:39:13] law of
[1:39:13] gravitation everybody
[1:39:17] that law does not apply to end
[1:39:27] did you get it if i take an end
[1:39:31] a n t and i put a net right here on the
[1:39:34] floor
[1:39:36] you're gonna see the ant walking
[1:39:37] straight like this
[1:39:39] you follow me if i pick up the ant
[1:39:42] and i put him on the wall here you're
[1:39:44] going to see that ant going up he's not
[1:39:47] falling
[1:39:50] back here if i pick the hand and put him
[1:39:54] on the ceiling you see the end going on
[1:39:57] the ceiling
[1:39:57] he doesn't fall down to the end
[1:40:00] everything is flat
[1:40:04] when the ant get right here he see it
[1:40:07] like a
[1:40:08] plane to you and me
[1:40:11] we have to be on the flat floor when
[1:40:14] if i take you and i put you here to walk
[1:40:17] like this you're going to fall down
[1:40:19] if i put your feet over there you're
[1:40:21] going to fall down because we were not
[1:40:23] wired like that
[1:40:27] anybody following me so eternity
[1:40:30] doesn't have a beginning and does not
[1:40:34] have
[1:40:34] an end are you following me
[1:40:39] there is one being
[1:40:42] that is called god god
[1:40:46] is the only being that is eternal
[1:40:51] you follow me so the only being
[1:40:54] that can feel eternity is god
[1:40:58] because eternity does not have a
[1:41:01] beginning
[1:41:03] and eternity does not have an end
[1:41:06] and god also as melchizedek
[1:41:09] have no father no matter no beginning of
[1:41:13] days no ending of time
[1:41:16] so the only being that if you take him
[1:41:21] you put him in eternity he feel all
[1:41:24] eternity
[1:41:24] is god
[1:41:29] i'm going slowly everybody following me
[1:41:33] if i take you and i put you into a
[1:41:36] bottle
[1:41:37] you're not gonna feel that bottle
[1:41:39] anybody clear
[1:41:40] you're gonna get in the border and there
[1:41:41] will be space around
[1:41:43] but when you take god and eternity
[1:41:46] if you put god in eternity god fit
[1:41:50] eternity
[1:41:54] in other words god is a hand
[1:42:00] and eternity is the glove
[1:42:06] when you take god you put him in
[1:42:08] eternity he fits perfectly
[1:42:11] if i take you i put you in eternity
[1:42:13] you're going to be maybe small like this
[1:42:20] what are you talking about brother
[1:42:21] stephen hallelujah
[1:42:25] god being infinite who cannot lie
[1:42:29] cannot speak anything contrary knows
[1:42:32] everything how does god knows everything
[1:42:36] please give me time
[1:42:39] wake up and buckle up what makes god to
[1:42:43] know everything
[1:42:50] are you ready
[1:42:54] if eternity is a circle
[1:42:58] anybody clear and god and eternity are
[1:43:02] blending together in other words when
[1:43:05] you put
[1:43:05] god all eternity is filled
[1:43:09] you follow me everything
[1:43:13] that is in god
[1:43:17] everything that is in god feel
[1:43:21] eternity are you there
[1:43:24] stay with me come
[1:43:28] just as perfect at the beginning as he
[1:43:31] is at the ending
[1:43:33] and just as perfect at the end as he was
[1:43:36] at the beginning
[1:43:37] in other words negative infinity and
[1:43:39] madness they blend together
[1:43:41] god is water like water
[1:43:46] you can never find a corner in a perfect
[1:43:50] cycle you could run and run
[1:43:53] through ages and eternity and there
[1:43:56] never
[1:43:57] never never be an end to it and that is
[1:44:00] the way
[1:44:01] god is
[1:44:04] god which always was
[1:44:07] he was infinite perfect to begin with
[1:44:10] and he shall always be the same he never
[1:44:15] can change his perfectly the same
[1:44:20] everybody understanding this man called
[1:44:24] god
[1:44:25] was made of seven colors
[1:44:28] relaxing
[1:44:32] god was this great big fountain of water
[1:44:36] seven colors how many knows that see
[1:44:40] and how many knows that god has seven
[1:44:42] spirit
[1:44:43] absolutely seven spirits and there was
[1:44:46] seven eyes in the lamb and so forth all
[1:44:50] that coming together now now that was
[1:44:53] god now when he the logos went out of
[1:44:57] god
[1:44:58] which was god coming from this one
[1:45:02] big fountain into a body in the form of
[1:45:04] man
[1:45:05] he made the logos which called the what
[1:45:08] theophany
[1:45:11] pay attention here this eternity here
[1:45:15] is filled with seven colors
[1:45:18] which is god
[1:45:22] these colors here are
[1:45:25] not
[1:45:29] amen visible you following me brother
[1:45:32] branham say
[1:45:33] many times that through this world
[1:45:36] what there is color coming down
[1:45:40] to prove to you that color comes down
[1:45:43] about here if we bring a tv right here
[1:45:46] and we put a tv right there you're gonna
[1:45:49] see
[1:45:50] the same color president by then have in
[1:45:53] washington right now
[1:45:55] if the president is giving a speech in
[1:45:57] washington
[1:45:58] and his style is blue everybody
[1:46:01] the color of his tie goes
[1:46:04] in a ways do you follow me
[1:46:08] and that color goes all over the world
[1:46:11] in the same time
[1:46:14] you follow me that's the reason
[1:46:17] when the president gives a speech in
[1:46:19] washington
[1:46:20] even if somebody is in africa if you put
[1:46:23] a tv
[1:46:24] you're going to see him with the same
[1:46:26] color he's giving the speech
[1:46:29] way in washington what makes you
[1:46:33] way somewhere there see the same color
[1:46:37] that is in another place over there
[1:46:39] because you are hitting
[1:46:40] the wave area take hebrew chapter 11
[1:46:52] hallelujah
[1:46:55] did i lose someone
[1:47:03] you already need space you already
[1:47:07] forgot about
[1:47:08] gastonia
[1:47:11] are you there hebrew chapter 11
[1:47:14] verse three everybody here
[1:47:18] through water faith we
[1:47:21] understand that the world's plural did
[1:47:24] you see that
[1:47:25] where framed by water the word of god
[1:47:29] so that things which are seen
[1:47:32] were not made of things which do water
[1:47:36] and but here god is a spirit
[1:47:41] john 4 verse 21 if i'm not mistaken
[1:47:44] a spirit is not visible so the seven
[1:47:48] colors of god wear invisible colors
[1:47:52] the color becomes visible when it's
[1:47:56] already condensed in a certain place
[1:47:59] then your eye can detect it
[1:48:02] what are you trying to say brother
[1:48:04] stephen if you
[1:48:06] take clorox and you take a black color
[1:48:10] and you put in clorox what do you see
[1:48:13] there
[1:48:14] do you see the black color again the
[1:48:16] black color disappear
[1:48:18] because the black color has been
[1:48:20] disintegrated
[1:48:21] when it's disintegrated it doesn't carry
[1:48:24] the color you see with your eye
[1:48:27] it is there but it's broken down
[1:48:29] everybody understanding
[1:48:31] so these seven colors here are the seven
[1:48:34] spirit of god that fill all eternity
[1:48:40] do you understand so within this god
[1:48:45] inside this god there was an attribute
[1:48:51] you follow me attribute to be
[1:48:55] saved attribute to be healed we know all
[1:48:57] about it
[1:48:59] now this god in eternity sat
[1:49:02] down in his mind
[1:49:06] and he begin to write his own story
[1:49:12] are you following me
[1:49:16] this is a different language buddy this
[1:49:20] whole bible
[1:49:21] to my opinion we know the opinion of the
[1:49:24] prophet
[1:49:25] the whole set up is a dramatic weapon
[1:49:29] just starting out of eden coming out
[1:49:32] through the gate
[1:49:34] on out the way of the cross leading
[1:49:37] right back again
[1:49:38] just all one big picture god
[1:49:42] has placed out of his mind i can imagine
[1:49:45] seeing god
[1:49:46] before there was even a foundation of
[1:49:49] the world
[1:49:50] before there was a moon a star anything
[1:49:53] seeing him set in the space yonder
[1:49:56] where did you see him brother branham
[1:49:58] and in his mind
[1:50:00] he drew out that picture what it would
[1:50:04] all be and everything he just spoke
[1:50:08] and said let there be and everything
[1:50:10] just begin
[1:50:11] to come into its place
[1:50:14] in this being that i have attribute here
[1:50:18] follow me carefully god begin to write
[1:50:22] his own story
[1:50:24] you follow me you follow me
[1:50:28] god begin to say that there will be a
[1:50:31] man
[1:50:32] called brother robert he's gonna be born
[1:50:36] in the country of trinidad he will move
[1:50:40] to the united states
[1:50:42] he will be an engineer he will be a
[1:50:45] deacon
[1:50:46] in living word then he's going to be a
[1:50:49] deacon in spoken word
[1:50:51] all of that was bundled up in the mind
[1:50:54] of god
[1:50:56] do you follow me your entire life
[1:51:01] everything that you got through now your
[1:51:04] entire life from beginning to the end
[1:51:07] was all part of the mind of god
[1:51:12] everybody understanding we are talking
[1:51:15] about eternity and god
[1:51:17] everybody following me blessed be the
[1:51:20] name of the lord
[1:51:21] so this being here when he
[1:51:24] finished his story do you understand
[1:51:28] when he wrote his story when he
[1:51:31] slew the lamb in his story
[1:51:36] when he finished the entire bible
[1:51:40] and your life and my life and your life
[1:51:43] all of them together he was
[1:51:46] not having space
[1:51:50] because he was feeling eternity
[1:51:54] if he moved it's eternity if he moved
[1:51:57] it's eternity if he moves it's eternal
[1:52:00] eternity block him
[1:52:02] because eternity and him blended
[1:52:05] together
[1:52:07] are you following me him and eternity
[1:52:11] fused together he needed space
[1:52:17] when he want to move it's eternity
[1:52:20] if he goes this way eternity if he goes
[1:52:24] up
[1:52:24] eternity he goes down he wants space
[1:52:29] you follow me to create space
[1:52:35] you follow me god pulled
[1:52:38] two words the first was
[1:52:42] in my faith
[1:52:48] and the second one was kenos
[1:52:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:52:58] by a morphin the invisible god
[1:53:03] wanted to make himself visible
[1:53:07] you understand but
[1:53:10] if he makes himself
[1:53:14] visible do you follow me he is still
[1:53:18] feeling eternity everybody follow me
[1:53:22] so he needed to get himself
[1:53:25] out of eternity and shrink
[1:53:29] himself down
[1:53:36] i'm going to go slowly if you look at a
[1:53:40] big tree somewhere there
[1:53:43] that tree was a small seed like this
[1:53:46] you follow me when they planted the seed
[1:53:50] that seed when it grows it gives you a
[1:53:53] big trees
[1:53:54] with all the fruit there you follow me
[1:53:58] if you take this tree and you begin to
[1:54:01] shrink it back
[1:54:04] to where it started you follow me
[1:54:08] you gonna end up into a seed
[1:54:13] do you follow me in other words the
[1:54:15] branches were in the seed
[1:54:17] the fruit were in the seed the bark was
[1:54:21] in the seed
[1:54:22] so god also who feel all eternity
[1:54:26] begin to shrink himself down
[1:54:33] you follow me when he shrugged himself
[1:54:36] down
[1:54:37] he ended up into a pillar of fire
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:47] did i lose somebody did i lose someone
[1:54:52] did i lose someone in other words the
[1:54:55] pillar of fire
[1:54:56] have the fullness of god bonded up
[1:55:00] into a seed the spoken word is the
[1:55:04] original
[1:55:10] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:55:14] when god shrank himself
[1:55:17] through a murphy and kenos
[1:55:20] into the pillar of fire he created
[1:55:23] a negative pressure
[1:55:29] did i lose somebody did i lose somebody
[1:55:34] this person here was filled by god
[1:55:38] are you there but when god strike
[1:55:41] himself
[1:55:42] eternity become a hollow
[1:55:48] the hand that was filling
[1:55:52] the the glove becomes so small
[1:55:56] until the glove is flabby
[1:56:02] because god needed space
[1:56:05] so he shrunk himself into a seed
[1:56:09] so he can have space in eternity
[1:56:15] now eternity is empty now
[1:56:18] with a pillar of fire circling
[1:56:22] and the pillar of fire is god shrunk
[1:56:26] into a seed
[1:56:30] and that seed is the logos which is the
[1:56:34] word of god
[1:56:35] in the beginning was the and the word
[1:56:38] was with
[1:56:39] and the word was
[1:56:42] [Applause]
[1:56:46] hallelujah so when god shrank himself
[1:56:51] he opened the law of contrast
[1:57:01] you okay everybody okay are we still
[1:57:05] coming
[1:57:06] keep your seat belt i'm gonna tell you
[1:57:08] when we're gonna get in a correct
[1:57:10] altitude
[1:57:11] are we okay god open up the law
[1:57:14] of contrast are you there
[1:57:18] the law of contrast if you have a
[1:57:21] positive you have water
[1:57:23] if you have a bowl you have water if you
[1:57:26] have
[1:57:26] night you have water
[1:57:30] are you are you there so god
[1:57:33] the pillar of fire becomes the positive
[1:57:39] because he shrunk himself and by
[1:57:43] shrinking himself he created a negative
[1:57:46] pressure
[1:57:48] in other words in the center right here
[1:57:51] it's plus
[1:57:52] all around becomes negative
[1:57:55] he needed something to feel it eternity
[1:57:58] is now
[1:57:58] empty are you there
[1:58:02] then from this pillar of fire here god
[1:58:06] with that space available now
[1:58:09] you follow me
[1:58:14] god has a big plan
[1:58:18] you follow me he needed space then
[1:58:21] he shrank himself
[1:58:29] god but everything that was written in
[1:58:33] the paper is right in it
[1:58:36] everything there so when he had
[1:58:39] free vacant space then he begin
[1:58:43] to create because now
[1:58:46] there is space he was feeling eternity
[1:58:50] he shrunk he created an empty space
[1:58:54] then he says let there be the earth let
[1:58:57] there be pluto
[1:58:58] let there be jupiter let there be this
[1:59:01] let there be this
[1:59:02] then eternity begin to get filled with
[1:59:05] planets
[1:59:14] hallelujah if ashtan
[1:59:18] had only had the spiritual application
[1:59:23] as he had defused the physical
[1:59:25] application
[1:59:26] as he studied the law of water god is
[1:59:29] right
[1:59:31] and so forth he could have told us
[1:59:34] something
[1:59:35] but brother when i heard his message
[1:59:39] on that great water that pillar of fire
[1:59:43] i stand so the pillar of fire
[1:59:46] in the midst of all eternity anybody
[1:59:50] clear
[1:59:51] center in the sky that
[1:59:54] ever contacted with that center
[1:59:57] you could do water do what
[2:00:02] and the power won't be water so this
[2:00:05] man albert einstein when he was studying
[2:00:08] universe
[2:00:10] he saw a light standing in the middle
[2:00:14] and when he studied he came up with a
[2:00:17] conclusion that
[2:00:18] if you ever get a contact with that
[2:00:21] light
[2:00:22] you can create water
[2:00:26] and you can be unlimited and i know one
[2:00:30] person
[2:00:31] who got in contact with that light
[2:00:34] until when they took a picture of him
[2:00:37] that light was hanging on top of him
[2:00:40] that's why he could create squirrel
[2:00:43] [Applause]
[2:00:49] hallelujah brother brother continued
[2:00:52] he says they are going to find out
[2:00:55] someday
[2:00:56] that they are not seeing 150 million
[2:00:59] years of space either
[2:01:01] they are going right around in the water
[2:01:08] you understand now
[2:01:12] you are going to find out one of this
[2:01:15] day
[2:01:15] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[2:01:18] off somewhere
[2:01:20] you are still well right here
[2:01:24] just into another water that is faster
[2:01:27] than water
[2:01:28] what they call light years they just
[2:01:30] going into a water
[2:01:33] because when they leave the earth they
[2:01:35] begin to look
[2:01:36] at the planet that's the emptiness that
[2:01:39] elohim
[2:01:40] shrank himself and was feeling but it's
[2:01:43] all a circle
[2:01:46] are you there so he created a negative
[2:01:50] pressure
[2:01:51] all around him because in him was filled
[2:01:54] with attribute
[2:01:56] so he wanted to release the attribute
[2:01:58] but there was no space
[2:02:00] so he have to shrink himself and then
[2:02:02] out of him he begin to
[2:02:04] release his attribute and his attribute
[2:02:07] begin to fill
[2:02:08] eternity
[2:02:11] now there are two attributes that we
[2:02:14] want to know here
[2:02:15] when we're dealing with the second death
[2:02:19] one attribute is the wrath of god
[2:02:25] the second attribute is the mercy of god
[2:02:31] these attributes have been the main king
[2:02:35] of the story of redemption
[2:02:38] these attributes have been even
[2:02:42] the beginning and the end of the zodiac
[2:02:48] the wrath of god spoke about his nature
[2:02:52] as a lionel and the mercy
[2:02:56] spoke about his nature as the lamb
[2:03:00] that's why when john was crying
[2:03:03] who is worthy to take the book and to
[2:03:06] break the seal
[2:03:06] they said john behold the lion
[2:03:10] of the tribe of judah when he turned he
[2:03:12] saw water
[2:03:14] he can be a lion mlm
[2:03:18] are you following me the two end of the
[2:03:20] zodiac
[2:03:22] the virgin and the lion er barkian
[2:03:25] this attribute this nature
[2:03:28] caused god to have two kinds of seed
[2:03:36] you okay he created the children of
[2:03:40] wrath
[2:03:44] because he must express himself
[2:03:48] in the attribute as a rough and angry
[2:03:51] god
[2:03:55] are you there god was a lion
[2:04:00] he must have something that will cause
[2:04:03] him
[2:04:03] to act like a lion
[2:04:08] if god is a savior they must be a sinner
[2:04:13] so that god can express his salvation
[2:04:16] if god is a healer somebody needs to get
[2:04:19] sick
[2:04:20] so god can act as a healer if god
[2:04:24] has an anger somebody must be there
[2:04:27] so that god can demonstrate his anger
[2:04:32] if god has mercy somebody must be there
[2:04:37] so god can display his mercy through
[2:04:40] that person
[2:04:42] so we gave the children of wrath
[2:04:45] and the children of mercy take romans 9.
[2:04:51] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:04:55] lord
[2:04:56] you see why the devil fought me
[2:05:02] allow me time you're gonna know who you
[2:05:04] are
[2:05:06] romans chapter 9 verse 11. if you dare
[2:05:09] you can say amen
[2:05:16] for the children being not yet
[2:05:20] to utter
[2:05:24] if they were not born where were they
[2:05:28] the children being not yet born
[2:05:32] hallelujah neither having done
[2:05:36] any water because when you do
[2:05:39] something good you have a tendency to
[2:05:41] say i did good so i deserve this
[2:05:46] if somebody did something bad you say
[2:05:48] yes god need to whip him
[2:05:50] because he did something bad god removed
[2:05:53] that from you
[2:05:56] you didn't do good if the bible said you
[2:05:59] didn't do evil
[2:06:00] you're gonna say yes i never seen that's
[2:06:03] what the young ruler came he said i
[2:06:05] listened i did all the law he thought he
[2:06:09] can have eternal life
[2:06:12] are you there jesus gave him a different
[2:06:15] bullet
[2:06:16] to show him that you were not qualified
[2:06:18] for it even though you follow the law
[2:06:23] it doesn't depend on you
[2:06:34] i hope i'm not talking to serpenty
[2:06:38] that's why moses can kill somebody
[2:06:42] and they pick him up amen
[2:06:47] and he saw for what seems to be a small
[2:06:50] mistake
[2:06:51] they kicked him out yet he was the one
[2:06:54] bringing food every day
[2:06:56] the other one was lazy
[2:07:07] none done evil or good
[2:07:10] that the purpose of god not your
[2:07:13] decision
[2:07:16] the purpose of god according to water
[2:07:20] election must stand not of
[2:07:24] water that's what israel missed
[2:07:27] but of him the water so just make sure
[2:07:31] he's the one that called me
[2:07:35] hallelujah he was saying to the younger
[2:07:39] it was said to her the elder shall serve
[2:07:42] the younger
[2:07:43] as it is written jacob has outdone water
[2:07:47] and eso have had on water were they born
[2:07:50] yet
[2:07:52] why do you hate them
[2:07:55] hallelujah what shall we
[2:07:58] say then is there unrighteousness with
[2:08:02] god
[2:08:04] god forbid for he says to moses
[2:08:07] i will have water
[2:08:10] on whom i will have mercy and i will
[2:08:13] have water
[2:08:15] on whom i will have water so the mercy
[2:08:19] of god
[2:08:23] where is where did i put it
[2:08:26] the mercy of god work with his
[2:08:29] compassion
[2:08:33] the mercy of god goes with his
[2:08:36] compassion
[2:08:39] watch now hallelujah
[2:08:42] so then it is not of him that will
[2:08:46] nor of him that runs but of god that
[2:08:50] shows what remember mercy over there
[2:08:54] it depends on who god revealed himself
[2:08:58] as a lamb
[2:09:00] are you there for the scripture says
[2:09:04] or to pharaoh even for this same purpose
[2:09:08] have i raised you up that i must show my
[2:09:11] power in you so they
[2:09:14] created pharaoh to show
[2:09:17] the power of god was that power
[2:09:21] in pharaoh to save him or to destroy him
[2:09:27] are you there my power in you
[2:09:30] that my name might be declared
[2:09:33] throughout all the earth
[2:09:35] therefore has he mercy on him he will
[2:09:38] have her mercy

[2:34:52] when the angels were placing seed they
[2:34:55] put one in the house of jeroboam
[2:35:00] god was coming with judgment he said
[2:35:04] an angel put one day come on out here
[2:35:07] get him out there there was something in
[2:35:10] that child that when god
[2:35:13] look
[2:35:16] what was that thing hallelujah
[2:35:21] as the eternal logos i'm going to head
[2:35:24] to the airport
[2:35:25] god was manifested in the sun
[2:35:28] and in jesus dwell all the fullness of
[2:35:31] the godhead badly
[2:35:33] and that eternal one was the father
[2:35:35] manifested in flesh
[2:35:37] and thereby gained a title of what
[2:35:40] that's jesus
[2:35:41] even so we eternal
[2:35:44] in his thought in our turn
[2:35:48] became the many members spoken word
[2:35:52] water
[2:35:53] manifested in flesh and those eternal
[2:35:57] touch
[2:35:59] now manifested in flesh our water
[2:36:02] even as we are also we are so-called
[2:36:06] we did not become seed by the rivers
[2:36:19] being born again
[2:36:22] does it make you a child of god
[2:36:30] the new birth only confirmed to you
[2:36:35] that you are a child of god
[2:36:40] it's a seal it's a confirmation
[2:36:48] are you there we were seed
[2:36:52] and therefore we were reborn
[2:36:55] so only the elect can be water
[2:36:59] because we were water is the reason we
[2:37:02] could be white
[2:37:04] in non-seed there is water
[2:37:07] because the vessel of wrath
[2:37:13] are you there it shows plainly
[2:37:17] the predestinated is the only one
[2:37:20] that is considering redemption
[2:37:24] did you get it let me say that again the
[2:37:27] predestinated
[2:37:28] is the only one that is considering
[2:37:30] redemption
[2:37:31] people might be making like think they
[2:37:34] are
[2:37:34] but the real redemption is those that
[2:37:37] are water
[2:37:38] because the very word redeem means water
[2:37:43] to redeem anything is bringing back to
[2:37:46] its water
[2:37:47] hallelujah so it's only the
[2:37:49] predestination
[2:37:50] will be brought back because the other
[2:37:54] didn't come from water
[2:37:59] hallelujah so were you
[2:38:02] sons of god and daughters of god before
[2:38:05] there was even a moon star or a molecule
[2:38:08] you were sons and daughters of god for
[2:38:10] you are only the physical manifestation
[2:38:13] of the attribute that was in god at the
[2:38:15] beginning for there is only one form of
[2:38:17] eternal life
[2:38:18] and that was who
[2:38:24] who is eternal life
[2:38:31] are you still doubting you still
[2:38:33] doubting yourself
[2:38:35] you still doubting wait i'm gonna help
[2:38:38] you
[2:38:39] in the image of god you was made
[2:38:42] and you were manifested for the glory
[2:38:44] and the fellowship of god
[2:38:46] and therefore as sure as your gene had
[2:38:49] to be in your father
[2:38:50] before your natural birth your spiritual
[2:38:52] gene had to be in who
[2:38:55] before you are an expression of the
[2:38:57] attribute of his thought
[2:38:59] before the foundation of the hallelujah
[2:39:04] john 10 but ye believe not
[2:39:07] because you are not of my what
[2:39:10] as i said unto you my sheep do what
[2:39:14] and i know them and they will water and
[2:39:17] i give
[2:39:17] unto them eternal life and they shall
[2:39:20] never water
[2:39:22] neither shall any plug them out of mind
[2:39:26] eternal security
[2:39:29] and when the gentile heard this
[2:39:32] they were glad and glorified the word of
[2:39:36] god
[2:39:36] and as many as where what
[2:39:39] to water deed water
[2:39:42] [Music]
[2:39:47] are you there then if you are a
[2:39:50] son of god or a daughter of god you were
[2:39:53] in god
[2:39:54] all the time but he knew what bed
[2:39:57] and time that you will be planted so now
[2:40:00] you are made a creature
[2:40:02] a son of god manifested son or daughter
[2:40:05] of god
[2:40:06] to meet the challenge of water to
[2:40:09] vindicate the water
[2:40:11] and living god of this water the message
[2:40:15] that is water
[2:40:16] you were programmed for the message of
[2:40:19] the hour

[2:40:28] not you that believed the message

[2:40:33] message

[2:40:46] how much you tried to impersonate you
[2:40:47] will never make
[2:40:48] it hallelujah
[2:40:52] how do i know i'm a child of mercy
[2:40:58] notice that word cannot deny itself
[2:41:02] then it is satisfied or it's the desire
[2:41:06] it's the desire it's a desire of
[2:41:09] what what made you desire it in the
[2:41:12] first place
[2:41:15] hallelujah because down in your soul
[2:41:19] there was a water which was what
[2:41:31] did you get it
