[16:38] the lord when he brought the quail
[16:41] he brought them so low he even decreased
[16:44] their speed
[16:45] so that the jews can just go and grab

[16:49] i say father if you did it for the quail
[16:52] i want this flight to come and slow him
[16:54] down
[16:56] very slow let him come slowly like the
[16:59] quail so i can kill him
[17:01] and i begin to work work after a while
[17:04] here comes the fly with a very slow
[17:07] speed
[17:08] [Laughter]
[17:11] amen and sat right there on the
[17:14] laptop screen so if i hit the laptop

[17:31] amen i hope you learned a lesson
[17:34] even in the little small thing you need
[17:37] god
[17:37] [Music]
[17:39] you don't need god only for big stuff
[17:42] even for breathing you need god
[17:45] everything that you do you just need god
[17:48] you lost a key just pray god

[18:16] hallelujah
[18:21] faith is so simple so
[18:24] simple so simple if god can help me with
[18:29] that fly i don't see what god cannot do
[18:32] for you
[18:34] amen he's not the god of the big stuff
[18:38] only
[18:40] or even the small stuff and if he can do
[18:43] the small stuff
[18:44] you can even speak to the mountain
[18:48] the mountain look big to you not to god
[18:51] he is the one that created the mountain
[18:55] hallelujah we the one that were
[18:58] trained that the mountain is a big thing
[19:01] oh that those mountains are big the
[19:03] king's mountain are big that's the way
[19:05] we were breathed
[19:07] when adam was bred there was nothing for
[19:09] him he could just move them left
[19:11] right nothing
[19:15] hosea chapter 13 verse 12.
[19:24] verse 12 if you dare you can say amen
[19:30] yeah we're changing gears and getting
[19:33] back up to the surface
[19:35] when i say it back up to the surface you
[19:38] need to be in tune in the message
[19:41] because you're going to wonder because
[19:44] when i say
[19:44] backup we're just soaring
[19:48] like a rocket amen so if you don't read
[19:51] your bible
[19:52] you don't listen to the message it's a
[19:55] problem
[19:56] hosea 13 verse 12 the
[19:59] iniquity how many knows what iniquities
[20:04] something that you know better not to do
[20:06] and you do it
[20:08] don't worry tight dress you wear tight
[20:09] dress it's iniquity
[20:11] because you already know better amen
[20:14] all right thank you brother kelly we got
[20:17] wired pretty good
[20:19] we say the iniquity of ephraim
[20:23] is bound in other words it's collected
[20:27] you might be seated
[20:29] god is talking about ephraim here we
[20:32] know that joseph had two children
[20:35] ephraim and manasseh right
[20:38] ephraim was the youngest one and
[20:41] manasseh was the
[20:42] oldest one and when jacob was about to
[20:45] bless his children
[20:47] he had to cross the hand amen and
[20:50] brother branham explained to us that he
[20:51] was the blessing that was supposed to go
[20:53] to the jews going into the gentile
[20:56] everybody clear
[20:57] so we're talking about ephraim here
[20:59] which is a gentile
[21:01] nation or gentile church
[21:04] ephraim a gentile church
[21:09] anybody clear what's going on
[21:12] with this gentile church
[21:15] blessed be the name of the lord the
[21:18] bible says that there is iniquity
[21:20] in this church amen so this church
[21:25] have already the knowledge of god
[21:28] given to them anybody clear but despite
[21:32] the fact that they have the knowledge of
[21:34] god
[21:35] they just don't want to do it
[21:39] they don't want to do it that's why
[21:42] it's iniquity anybody created so far
[21:47] so they know something better but there
[21:49] is something about
[21:50] ephraim that he doesn't want to do what
[21:54] god is asking him to do
[21:56] amen the scripture continues
[21:59] the iniquity of ephraim is bound in
[22:02] other words
[22:03] it's collected god collects it
[22:06] it's burned up his sin
[22:10] is hidden in other words god watched
[22:13] ephraim
[22:14] and god already gave his word to ephraim
[22:18] god spoke to ibrahim and demonstrated to
[22:21] ephraim
[22:22] all the territory of the black dog
[22:27] amen god unfolded the mystery
[22:30] to the point that even a baby will know
[22:33] what's going on
[22:35] but despite the knowledge and the
[22:38] understanding
[22:40] and the revelation that ephraim got
[22:43] ephraim still doesn't want to do what
[22:46] god is asking him to do
[22:48] everybody clear so because of that god
[22:52] comes and collects the iniquity of
[22:55] ephraim
[22:56] and store it
[23:00] anybody clear amen
[23:03] verse 13 the sorrows
[23:06] of a travailing woman shall come upon
[23:10] him
[23:12] he is a water
[23:15] he is an unwise son
[23:19] who is wisdom
[23:23] and he is a wise meaning he lacks wisdom
[23:28] remember the boy in uh in proverbs 7
[23:31] anybody clear now sorrow of a travailing
[23:35] woman
[23:36] shall come upon him he is unwise
[23:40] and unwise son why is he unwise
[23:44] four he should not stay long
[23:48] in the place of the breaking forth
[23:52] of children
[23:56] how many understand that
[24:00] this is why praise god let me help you
[24:04] in another translation the bible says
[24:08] that
[24:08] pain has come
[24:12] to the people like the pain of a child
[24:16] birth
[24:18] but they are like a child
[24:22] who resists being born
[24:28] everybody the moment of birth was
[24:31] arrived but they stay in the womb
[24:36] so ephraim was in the womb and it was
[24:40] time for ephraim to be born
[24:43] so the pain and the travel came upon the
[24:46] mother of ephraim
[24:48] but ephraim doesn't want to come out
[24:51] and because of that he's an unwise son
[24:55] because he's staying
[24:56] too long in the delivery ephraim is
[24:59] holding mommy too long in a delivery
[25:02] mommy wanna tell him hey you need to
[25:04] come out for him say
[25:05] i don't want to come out it is a son
[25:09] that does not like to be born again
[25:15] [Music]
[25:19] everybody clear he hates the new birth
[25:24] when god tells him what to do he doesn't
[25:28] want to do what god wants him to do
[25:30] he still want to stay in the position
[25:33] that he is
[25:35] he's still connected to the high heel
[25:38] he's still connected to the
[25:39] bad dressing he's still collected
[25:42] connected to everything that god
[25:44] displayed unto him not to do
[25:46] in other words he doesn't want to be
[25:48] born
[25:50] god came to give him an opportunity to
[25:54] clean up his life
[25:55] so that he can be born but ephraim
[25:58] doesn't want to be born
[26:04] the sorrow of a travel woman shall come
[26:07] upon him
[26:09] he is an unwise son why are you unwise
[26:12] for he should not stay long in the place
[26:15] of the breaking forth of children in the
[26:17] delivery home
[26:19] verse 14 i
[26:22] will ransom them from the power of the
[26:26] grave
[26:28] i will redeem them from death so there
[26:30] is two things here
[26:32] that is waiting for ephraim one of them
[26:36] is death and another one is water
[26:41] the grave because if you stay on mama
[26:44] too long
[26:45] you don't want to come out you're going
[26:46] to end up dying
[26:48] anybody clear and when you die the next
[26:51] step is they're going to take you to the
[26:53] grave
[26:56] now the scripture is clear i will ransom
[27:00] them
[27:00] from the power of the grave i will
[27:04] redeem them
[27:05] from death or death
[27:08] i will be your water plagues
[27:12] or grave i will be your water
[27:16] so ephraim here is afraid of two deaths
[27:21] there is a death to be born again
[27:26] is to die on your own
[27:31] anybody here die on the self
[27:34] it's a self death
[27:38] ephraim doesn't want it he's afraid
[27:41] he doesn't want to come out and there is
[27:44] a second death
[27:46] that is right there is a death that's
[27:49] going to put him in the grave
[27:51] so the first death he doesn't want to be
[27:54] separated and the second death is going
[27:57] to put him to the grave
[27:59] both of those deaths are looking at
[28:01] ephraim
[28:02] but god is coming down to rescue him
[28:06] anybody clear i will ransom them from
[28:10] the power of the grave
[28:12] i will redeem them from death or
[28:16] death i will be your plug now god
[28:19] is threatening death
[28:23] anybody clear oh grave
[28:26] i will be your destruction repentance
[28:31] shall be hidden from my eyes
[28:39] this is not for the serpent seed
[28:42] when god is determined to do something
[28:46] gift and calling are without water
[28:50] so whether you repent or not they are
[28:52] there
[28:54] anybody clear so when god is determined
[28:58] to get his elect anybody clear
[29:01] god will even bypass certain things
[29:06] just to get you where you are and to get
[29:09] you out
[29:10] so that he can rescue you anybody clear
[29:13] because this child is about to die
[29:16] still born because he
[29:20] has he doesn't want to be a a boner
[29:24] he doesn't like a birth and death is
[29:26] also over there
[29:27] trying to kill him anybody care
[29:33] repentance shall be hidden from my eyes
[29:36] i'm not looking at that anymore i'm
[29:37] determined that my plan
[29:39] is going to take place regardless
[29:42] whether you want it
[29:43] or not i am coming down for you
[29:48] anybody clear you don't want to repent i
[29:50] am coming down
[29:52] i'm going to turn the devil everywhere
[29:55] i'm gonna turn everything upside down
[30:00] i'm gonna push you to the corner until i
[30:03] get you out of that because you don't
[30:07] want to come out
[30:08] from the womb even though you have been
[30:10] preached so long
[30:13] and you don't understand that not only
[30:16] the natural i mean the spiritual birth
[30:19] is a problem
[30:20] there is also death plus grave
[30:23] that is about to attack you let's go to
[30:26] first corinthians
[30:27] 15 hallelujah
[30:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[30:38] brother mike do we have another sharpie
[30:41] this is sinking in
[30:51] i can still work with it though if you
[30:53] can find it
[30:55] first corinthians chapter 15. if you
[30:58] dare you can say amen
[31:00] everybody clear you need to be wired
[31:03] pretty good
[31:04] because i am taking off
[31:07] amen if not it's going to generate a
[31:10] bunch of questions and answers
[31:12] amen which is still fun
[31:16] first corinthians 15.
[31:19] you grown up now it's time to eat solid
[31:22] food
[31:25] thank you very much they should look
[31:27] like this
[31:30] okay
[31:32] verse 27
[31:35] for he god
[31:38] has put all things under his feet
[31:44] jesus but
[31:47] when he says all things are put
[31:50] under him it is manifested
[31:54] that he is accepted
[31:57] in other words when god says that he
[32:01] took everything
[32:03] and put under jesus christ
[32:06] so jesus christ is above everything
[32:10] anybody clear so when it's under him it
[32:14] doesn't mean he's under himself
[32:16] he is the exception everybody clear
[32:20] he is the top
[32:23] everybody clear all things are put under
[32:26] him
[32:27] it is manifested that he is accepted
[32:31] which did put all things under water
[32:35] god is not going to be under christ
[32:37] because christ and god are
[32:39] amen verse 28. and when all things shall
[32:43] be
[32:44] subdued to him then shall the son
[32:48] also himself be subject to him that put
[32:51] all things under him there is no true
[32:54] god here it is the offices that are
[32:57] working
[32:58] amen he is in the office of the son
[33:01] they're putting everything under him
[33:04] when they finish that
[33:05] office then he goes back to the father
[33:08] then we ascended back again
[33:10] and he goes to god amen because the son
[33:13] of god is who
[33:15] we already shown to you it's in uh john
[33:17] 5 28 or something like that
[33:19] about here amen job to verse 51

[33:36] we shall not all die
[33:39] but we shall all be water so some people
[33:43] will die
[33:45] some people will not die
[33:48] but for sure whether you die or you stay
[33:52] alive
[33:52] we all gonna be changed
[33:56] anybody clear
[34:01] death
[34:04] let's go to hebrew chapter two ephraim
[34:08] doesn't want to come out he doesn't like
[34:10] the birth
[34:11] it cost him a lot he's going to cost him
[34:14] his friend
[34:16] it's going to cost him his facebook his
[34:18] instagram his clothing
[34:22] ibrahim doesn't want to come out he
[34:24] doesn't want to die to himself
[34:26] he doesn't understand that if he doesn't
[34:29] come out
[34:30] there is another death that is waiting
[34:33] for him and that death
[34:35] is always accompanied with grief
[34:39] anybody clear then everything
[34:43] was put on the crust except who
[34:46] christ who is god himself but not
[34:49] everybody
[34:50] is gonna die some people won't die
[34:56] i am among them
[34:59] it's up to you to claim it
[35:04] i'm going to see jesus alive hebrew
[35:07] chapter 2.
[35:11] the scripture cannot be broken
[35:17] amen hebrew chapter 2 verse 7.
[35:22] everybody there you can say amen you
[35:25] made him
[35:26] a little lower than the angels
[35:30] who's that person jesus
[35:34] you made him a looter lower than the
[35:37] angel
[35:38] you crowned him with glory and honor
[35:43] and indeed set him over the work
[35:46] of your hands just like adam
[35:49] he's the second adam ever clear
[35:53] watch verse 8 you have put
[35:56] all things back again to corinthians
[36:00] you have put all things in water
[36:03] in subjection in other words under his
[36:06] control
[36:08] in subjection under his water
[36:11] under the feet of christ everybody
[36:13] understand
[36:15] four in that he put all
[36:19] in subjection under him he left
[36:22] what that is not put
[36:25] under him but
[36:29] now we see not
[36:32] yet all things put
[36:35] under paul is saying that
[36:38] in the mind of god in the position
[36:42] that christ have everything is under the
[36:46] control of christ
[36:49] ever here accept christ himself
[36:52] because he's god but paul is saying that
[36:56] even though all things are already given
[37:00] to christ
[37:01] all things are under the feet of christ
[37:05] yet when we observe there is
[37:08] something that it looks like it's not
[37:12] controlled yet by christ there is
[37:15] something else that is still free
[37:18] amen yet he has everything under control
[37:22] but there is something that looks like
[37:25] it is not under control yet
[37:28] what is that anybody clear
[37:31] let me read it again so you get it you
[37:34] have put
[37:35] all things in subjection under his feet
[37:38] for in that he put all things under him
[37:41] he left nothing in other words all
[37:43] around him
[37:45] that is not put under him but now
[37:48] in the present time that is already
[37:51] finishing the man of god
[37:52] but in the present time in what we are
[37:55] living today
[37:56] but now we see not yet all things put
[38:00] under him there's
[38:01] something that is not under him anybody
[38:04] clear
[38:05] verse 9 but we see who
[38:10] jesus who was made a little water
[38:14] now you got your answer right
[38:17] okay which is made lower who was made
[38:20] lower than the angel for the suffering
[38:24] of
[38:24] water the purpose of christ
[38:28] was to suffer water
[38:34] anybody clear to suffer death
[38:38] comer quran with god glory and honor
[38:42] that he by the grace of god should
[38:46] test what for who
[38:51] why should i testify if he tested for me
[38:59] did it make sense you're not going to
[39:02] hell
[39:03] because jesus went to hell for your
[39:05] place
[39:13] it's a combo there is a hamburger
[39:17] there is a tomato there is a chicken
[39:20] there is pickles all of them it is not
[39:23] just not going to help for me
[39:25] he also tests death for me
[39:29] he also took the penalty of sin for me
[39:32] he also took the judgment for me all of
[39:35] that are in your hamburger
[39:39] you don't want to pick up fine i see you
[39:41] in the resurrection
[39:47] let's go to verse 15
[39:50] and deliver them who drew fear of water
[39:58] so death has a fear
[40:03] you gather bj you got it
[40:06] okay who drew fear of water
[40:10] of death where all their lifetimes
[40:13] subject to water
[40:15] so there was somebody who had made
[40:18] humanity
[40:19] suffer and keep everybody
[40:22] under bondage everybody
[40:25] you can fight this you can fight this
[40:28] you can fight the
[40:29] when that person come everybody shake
[40:35] his name is water
[40:38] are people still dying today
[40:41] so not all things are put under
[40:47] yet all things are put under christ
[40:51] because he is the resurrection and the
[40:54] life
[40:55] yet lazarus can die
[41:01] but when are we going to reach a point
[41:02] where nobody dies
[41:06] you ready now let's pray heavenly father
[41:11] lord we thank you again for your grace
[41:13] your love your mercy
[41:15] and for everything you have been doing
[41:17] for us father we are committing this
[41:19] service unto the hand

[41:58] father
[41:59] you touch and minister to their life we
[42:02] aimly ask it lord father
[42:03] in the name of jesus christ amen
[42:07] all right
[42:12] the second banquet of esther
[42:20] we're going up we finish with king
[42:23] ahazarys
[42:25] the second banquet of esther part one
[42:29] the mystery of water praise god
[42:34] you ready when we talk about the black
[42:37] dog
[42:40] we found out that the origin of the
[42:43] black dog
[42:44] came from the indian chief
[42:48] embark here and we gave you three
[42:51] scenario
[42:53] that when we are born in this world
[42:56] we have the inward man or the inside man
[43:00] and the outside man or the body or the
[43:04] physical man
[43:06] and when we are born the way we are born
[43:08] we born in sin
[43:10] we are shaping iniquity coming into this
[43:13] world
[43:13] we don't have to be taught lie we
[43:15] speaking lies everybody clear
[43:17] and we explain to you that both your
[43:20] inside
[43:22] and your outside according to romans 7
[43:24] have a black dog in it
[43:26] anybody clear all right then when we
[43:30] moved to the second scenario
[43:32] we found out that the black dog was
[43:34] still there
[43:36] everybody clear but the black dog was no
[43:39] longer
[43:40] inside and what changed you or what
[43:44] takes you
[43:45] from the first step all the way to the
[43:47] second step
[43:48] is the coming down of the dove
[43:52] anybody clear when the dove comes
[43:55] when the gospel the living christ come
[43:59] in your life
[44:00] he approaches you on the east side
[44:04] everybody when he approaches
[44:07] when he approaches you on the inside
[44:10] your soul
[44:11] is still death
[44:14] because your soul already sinned and the
[44:17] bible said that the soul that sinners
[44:19] shall do what
[44:21] should i ever care so when the holy
[44:24] spirit come
[44:25] he's gonna kiss your soul
[44:28] and when he make a contact with your
[44:30] soul he's gonna remove
[44:32] everything that was dark over there
[44:37] this is what we call the new birth
[44:41] are we clear then the holy spirit will
[44:44] enter
[44:44] inside there and when he enter then
[44:48] he become a white dog
[44:52] ever here no your
[44:55] inside is the white dog
[44:59] but your outside is a black dog
[45:02] that is the indian chief problem
[45:06] because he was born again brother
[45:08] branham said what's going on with you
[45:09] chief
[45:10] he said oh prophet since i was born
[45:13] again
[45:14] there is a fight not outside of me
[45:18] everybody there is a fight inside of me
[45:22] and paul explained to us that fact in
[45:25] romans 7 he said
[45:27] when i want to do good i found out that
[45:29] evil is present
[45:31] evil is present within me so there is a
[45:34] wrestling
[45:35] a fight that is going on between you and
[45:38] you
[45:42] ever care so far the black dog
[45:47] that is still on your flesh is trying to
[45:50] pull you backward toward
[45:51] egypt but this one that came on the
[45:54] inside
[45:55] has a purpose to pull you all the way to
[45:58] full redemption
[46:00] where the inside and the outside is
[46:02] completely
[46:03] free
[46:06] over here everything will be put
[46:10] in subjection of you not crushed
[46:14] you ever clear
[46:18] now we found out that in this second
[46:21] scenario
[46:22] the black dog is still there
[46:25] yet on the inside christ is living with
[46:28] you
[46:30] in john chapter 14 verse 23
[46:33] the bible says that jesus answered and
[46:36] said unto him
[46:38] if a man loves me he will keep my word
[46:42] and my father will love him
[46:46] and we will come unto him and make our
[46:49] water
[46:51] our board with him in other words my
[46:53] father and me
[46:54] which are one we're going to come and
[46:57] make
[46:58] you our dwelling place
[47:01] and a bird is a house a dwelling place
[47:05] ever clear so when you love christ then
[47:07] you receive his word
[47:09] god is coming into you enter in your
[47:12] heart
[47:13] and you become the temple of god
[47:15] everybody clear
[47:18] in revelation chapter 3 verse 20 the
[47:21] bible says behold
[47:22] i stand at the door and do whatever
[47:25] who's knocking
[47:27] christ if any man hears my voice
[47:30] this is in laodicea and open the door
[47:35] i will come into him
[47:38] so there is an entrance in and
[47:41] will do what so there is a
[47:45] supper that is going to happen in you
[47:49] come here there is a banquet
[47:54] in you
[47:59] ever here there is a supper
[48:02] that happened in you when you opened
[48:05] your door which is your free moral
[48:07] agency
[48:08] you have the right to say yes or no to
[48:10] god
[48:11] but if you are predestinated god will
[48:14] give you the love of the truth
[48:17] so when you see the truth automatically
[48:19] or door open like the door of walmart
[48:22] pup wide open and then christ
[48:26] enter when he's entering in he's
[48:29] bringing a banquet
[48:33] not a banquet to your friend
[48:36] not a banquet with your neighbor not a
[48:39] banquet with your pastor
[48:41] or your deacon but a banquet for you
[48:47] i will come in him and will sup with him
[48:50] and he with me there is a communion
[48:54] brother but i'm saying the message
[48:56] leadership he says
[48:57] god is calling whom not a church
[49:03] ever here individual in spoken word
[49:06] tabernacle
[49:09] here i stand at the door and
[49:12] knock if any man
[49:16] any person how many individuals
[49:20] one individual out of a thousand
[49:23] it might be one out of water so god
[49:26] is coming individually to you
[49:30] and he has he's entering in so he can
[49:33] have a banquet with you
[49:36] ever clear the door inside the door
[49:40] brother branham said lord i stand at the
[49:42] door and knock
[49:44] and if you shall open the door i will
[49:46] come into you and will sap with you
[49:49] sup with him and him with me
[49:52] sup means to do what
[49:55] to entertain to have fellowship
[49:59] sap one with the other it's to have
[50:02] water
[50:03] communion fellowship one with another
[50:08] so we found out by these verses here and
[50:11] this quote
[50:12] that the coming of the white dog
[50:15] inside of you is a coming into a banquet
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] are you following me yet in that banquet
[50:25] you still have the black dog
[50:30] hey god came into you
[50:34] by the new birth to have communion with
[50:37] you
[50:37] to have fellowship with you inside of
[50:40] you
[50:41] but a one god is having communion with
[50:44] you
[50:45] there is also somebody there everybody
[50:48] here
[50:49] that's why esther have to invite airmen
[50:58] so on the first banquet a man
[51:01] is present he's happy he's alive
[51:04] he's disturbing paul until paul
[51:08] said all right said that i am who can
[51:11] rescue me
[51:12] for this body of water because somebody
[51:15] a visitor is there we don't want him
[51:20] amen esther knew that the one who's
[51:22] causing all the trouble
[51:24] his name is heaven but yet a man must be
[51:27] invited
[51:28] because in your body when you have
[51:31] communion which is with the king
[51:33] sin he also is over there
[51:37] ever here if he's coming in
[51:42] he's bringing his coming inside what is
[51:44] he coming for
[51:47] brother of adam said in the very day
[51:50] that the son of man is revealed
[51:54] now remember the first banquet of esther
[51:57] happened in esther chapter 5.
[52:01] you remember that and in esther
[52:04] chapter 6 which is the number of a man
[52:08] about here that's when mordecai
[52:12] revealed the son of man to the public
[52:15] and then in esther chapter seven
[52:19] ever here this is when we have the
[52:22] second penguin
[52:25] the mathematics of the bible america
[52:29] the book of esther is like a book of
[52:31] revelation
[52:32] america in chapter 5
[52:35] there is a first banquet
[52:38] in chapter 6 there is a revealing
[52:42] of the king to the public by mordecai
[52:46] in chapter 7 there is the second banquet
[52:50] in chapter 5 amen is good
[52:56] everybody in chapter seven
[52:59] emmen is in trouble
[53:02] in chapter five emen is still powerful
[53:07] in chapter seven emen is powerless
[53:12] about here so when the king come
[53:15] into you to sup with you there is a
[53:19] black dog
[53:20] standing right there amen
[53:23] but before you move from the first
[53:26] banquet
[53:27] all the way to the second banquet there
[53:29] must be
[53:30] a a a a space
[53:34] where the son of man must be revealed
[53:38] the revelation of the son of man
[53:41] have a purpose for your banquet
[53:48] hallelujah brother branham say
[53:51] in the very day that the son of man is
[53:55] revealed
[53:56] we found the king stay in the palace
[53:59] and monica took the robe of the king
[54:03] the crown of the king even the horse of
[54:06] the king until when you look at modica
[54:09] you will think it's the king
[54:14] are you there that's why brother branham
[54:16] was riding
[54:18] the horse of jesus
[54:33] and when you look at him from afar you
[54:35] think it's the king
[54:37] you must get on the detail
[54:40] in order to detect and to separate
[54:43] mordecai with the king if not you're
[54:47] going to get
[54:47] confusion because john
[54:51] got that confusion in the book of
[54:53] revelation
[54:54] until john begin to worship mordechai
[54:59] [Music]
[55:03] people trying to worship brother branham
[55:06] is it a problem it's in the scripture
[55:12] we don't worship brother branham we know
[55:15] who do we worship
[55:17] because we got the ego vision
[55:26] it is to the unbeliever to stumble
[55:30] but to me it's glorious
[55:33] when i see a man turning his back and
[55:36] doing this
[55:37] it's telling me genesis 18
[55:41] god revealing human flesh
[55:50] hallelujah i told you i am soaring
[55:53] up toward the surface so you better stay
[55:56] up
[55:59] amen in the day
[56:02] when the son of man is with you
[56:04] revelation water
[56:06] one to water read it when you get home
[56:11] the seventh angel's message
[56:14] opening up water so in between
[56:18] where esther chapter 5 which is the
[56:22] chapter of grace because grace
[56:25] brought you the gift of faith for you to
[56:28] be saved
[56:30] ever clear then arrested chapter 6 the
[56:33] revelation of a man
[56:36] the son of man and exodus chapter 7
[56:39] which is going to be the completion
[56:42] of your redemption ever clear
[56:46] so in between step five and esther
[56:50] seven they must reveal the seals
[56:54] what for
[57:00] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[57:03] lord
[57:04] the seventh century message opening up
[57:07] the water
[57:08] what is it not the
[57:12] engine is the water
[57:15] but the messenger is revealing the water
[57:19] mother kai is not the king
[57:22] mordecai is only resilient the king
[57:27] the king was in the palace you never
[57:30] seen his horse before
[57:33] you never seen his crown before you
[57:36] never seen his clothing before
[57:38] somebody went and stripped the king
[57:46] strip the king off his power
[57:49] strip the king of his crown until the
[57:53] fullness
[57:54] of the king was outside what
[57:57] remained in the palace was the body
[58:01] but the fullness of the king was
[58:03] outsider
[58:05] and he was carried by somebody else
[58:10] the king anointing was on someone
[58:13] yes sir
[58:20] is everybody awake are we okay
[58:24] are we good did i lose someone
[58:27] thank you back on up good i'm come i'm
[58:29] keep coming out
[58:34] everybody
[58:36] this you don't get into this anymore
[58:41] you must believe the message of the hour
[58:48] what is it not the angel is the son of
[58:52] man
[58:53] but the messenger is revealing the son
[58:56] of man
[58:57] can you get it water
[59:00] that is where it seems to be water
[59:05] it's not easy
[59:10] you see not the son of man
[59:14] himself the king but the seventh angel
[59:18] mordecai the seventh messenger
[59:21] modica is revealing to the water
[59:25] it's mordecai he's going who's going on
[59:28] the city
[59:31] and when you see more the car you say oh
[59:33] now i see how the king's crown looked
[59:35] like
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:38] i never had a pair i never had a chance
[59:41] to get in the palace
[59:43] now i can see the king robert
[59:51] i'm gonna drop it when the king
[59:54] won his apparel when the president is
[59:58] operating
[59:59] when the president is passing through
[1:00:02] here
[1:00:02] either to jump back and passing here
[1:00:05] nobody will be allowed to be on the

[1:21:27] miss water
[1:21:29] that life you won't come up if you miss

[1:21:51] belong to
[1:21:52] it does not matter one thing unless you
[1:21:56] have been water
[1:21:58] you must go to chapter five the first
[1:22:01] banquet
[1:22:02] before you are a candidate to
[1:22:05] the second banquet we skip like
[1:22:09] afrahim the new birth and we put the
[1:22:12] mysteries
[1:22:13] on a regenerated heart
[1:22:18] somebody who is not born again but his
[1:22:21] head is filled with
[1:22:22] mysteries it doesn't help you
[1:22:27] you won't come up because you miss the
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:31] you miss the step you miss the first
[1:22:34] supper
[1:22:36] you can get an intellectual knowledge
[1:22:40] but the the reason of the first supper
[1:22:44] is to bring the holy ghost in you
[1:22:47] and the holy ghost is the inside
[1:22:50] teacher so when you begin to listen to
[1:22:53] the word
[1:22:54] to the message the holy spirit in you
[1:22:57] begin to teach you
[1:22:59] how to live a christian life
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:03] because the holy ghost feeds on though
[1:23:06] and when you bring in mysteries he
[1:23:08] begins to grow
[1:23:11] anybody clear the greatest marker of
[1:23:15] villain in that age
[1:23:17] in the world that we ever lived is a
[1:23:20] false light in this hour
[1:23:22] that we're living in trying to put us
[1:23:24] back
[1:23:25] under some kind of creed and things when
[1:23:28] we are living water
[1:23:30] or in other words we are a piece of that
[1:23:33] that is living
[1:23:34] that has been written and now living out
[1:23:37] the water
[1:23:39] as he promised in the hour manifested
[1:23:42] word
[1:23:43] a piece of written that has been living
[1:23:46] that is what their pastor was so the
[1:23:49] apostles
[1:23:50] were not people that were just coding
[1:23:52] the word
[1:23:54] because they were not intellectual but
[1:23:56] there were people
[1:23:58] that were living the gospel until if you
[1:24:01] don't have the message
[1:24:03] if you watch them you can understand the
[1:24:06] message
[1:24:08] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:24:10] name of the young

[1:25:25] that is the thunder that's going to

[1:25:29] he hates that you can do everything as
[1:25:32] long as you miss the life
[1:25:36] let's go to verse 8.
[1:25:39] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:43] jump to verse 13.
[1:25:50] i'm sorry go back to verse 8. and heaven
[1:25:53] said to the king of hazaris there is a
[1:25:56] certain people
[1:25:57] scattered abroad and dispersed among the
[1:26:00] people
[1:26:01] in all the provinces of your kingdom and
[1:26:03] the laws
[1:26:05] how did he know the laws did he read
[1:26:08] them
[1:26:11] do you think him and stop on the
[1:26:13] computer to do research on crazy website
[1:26:21] endeavors from all the people neither
[1:26:24] keep that the king's law
[1:26:26] therefore it is not for the king's
[1:26:28] prophet to allow them
[1:26:31] if you notice here him and purpose in
[1:26:34] his heart
[1:26:36] to destroy mordecai and all the jews
[1:26:40] and we already show you that the jew in
[1:26:42] the new testament
[1:26:44] paul said that the jew is the one that
[1:26:46] is what in word
[1:26:47] the one that is already in chapter five
[1:26:50] this is the jew but here but
[1:26:54] even though you are jew already living
[1:26:57] the world
[1:26:58] the threat of heaven is still there
[1:27:02] are you following me amen is not solved
[1:27:06] even though you were jew by birth
[1:27:09] everybody so he purposed to destroy them
[1:27:15] but if you notice he cannot destroy them
[1:27:20] without the permission of the king
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:27] the power of heaven
[1:27:33] is always
[1:27:36] under permission to the
[1:27:40] jews or to the believer
[1:27:48] we're going somewhere jump to verse 30

[1:28:36] his ministry is to destroy everybody
[1:28:40] that is jew anybody clear
[1:28:45] but in order to do that number one
[1:28:48] he needs a permission from the king
[1:28:51] anybody
[1:28:53] when he get permission from the king
[1:28:57] his plan his

[1:29:26] you need to watch your scripture who's
[1:29:29] riding

[1:30:37] the letter is written under the king's
[1:30:41] name
[1:30:42] but it is not the purpose of the kingdom
[1:30:46] you follow me the purpose is the purpose
[1:30:50] of heaven
[1:30:51] but if you look it looks like it's the
[1:30:54] king
[1:30:55] and it's written by a scrabble and
[1:30:58] invade the politics
[1:31:02] anybody he was written

[1:31:19] that purpose is written brother robert
[1:31:23] by a scrub
[1:31:26] and it's written under the king's name
[1:31:31] but that purpose is also sealed
[1:31:35] with the king seal and if it's still
[1:31:40] somebody need to break the seal to
[1:31:43] decode it

[1:32:30] and send leather by water
[1:32:34] on what come out

[1:33:02] number three he must be sealed
[1:33:05] number three he must be carried on a
[1:33:08] horse
[1:33:15] we have three elements here
[1:33:18] we have a message
[1:33:23] of heaven and that message is a sealed
[1:33:27] message
[1:33:29] written by a scrub and carried on a
[1:33:34] horse
[1:33:44] it is a ministry that comes like it's
[1:33:47] god
[1:33:48] but it's not god it is the antichrist
[1:33:53] it must be written by a scribe by the
[1:33:56] name of john
[1:33:59] john must be the one writing what he
[1:34:01] sees
[1:34:03] and when john sees he sees a rose heard
[1:34:07] a rose a horse right there coming up a
[1:34:10] cavalier
[1:34:11] and the cavalier carried a message
[1:34:14] a message with the plan of the enemy
[1:34:18] still with the king seal in order
[1:34:21] to destroy so you need a mordekai
[1:34:25] to take that message and decode it
[1:34:33] everybody clear so far
[1:34:35] [Laughter]
[1:34:38] i'm not in the deep portion i told you
[1:34:40] i'm sorry
[1:34:41] let's go to verse 13. and the letter was
[1:34:44] sent by goldberg post on a beast
[1:34:48] into all the king's provinces to do
[1:34:50] water
[1:34:52] destroy come out kill
[1:34:56] to cause to perish still kill all the
[1:34:58] jews
[1:34:59] both young and old little children and
[1:35:02] women
[1:35:03] in one day upon the 13th day of the 12th
[1:35:06] month
[1:35:07] 12 12 13 12 which is the month of adam
[1:35:12] and to take the water somebody want to
[1:35:14] steal
[1:35:17] so we found out that that message has
[1:35:19] three purpose
[1:35:21] to kill destroy to kill
[1:35:25] or to cause to perish and to do what
[1:35:28] to steal john chapter 10 verse 10
[1:35:32] the bible said the fifth cometh not but
[1:35:36] to do water
[1:35:37] and to do what and to do what
[1:35:40] but i am calm that they might have water
[1:35:44] this is the black dog this is a white
[1:35:46] dog and that they might have more water
[1:35:49] not only does he want you to have life
[1:35:53] chapter five but he wants you to have
[1:35:56] life
[1:35:56] abundantly chapter seven he wants you to
[1:36:00] have pro complete
[1:36:01] life
[1:36:04] everybody so far so we found out
[1:36:08] here go to esther chapter four verse
[1:36:10] seven
[1:36:12] then i'm gonna sort straight and go to
[1:36:15] the airport
[1:36:16] if possible exeter chapter seven
[1:36:19] you there all right chapter four verse
[1:36:22] seven
[1:36:24] and mordecai told him oh
[1:36:27] that had happened to him and the sum of
[1:36:29] money that human head
[1:36:30] remember that was not written
[1:36:34] right it was not written but it was part
[1:36:37] of the story
[1:36:38] he have to be unfolded by mordecai
[1:36:41] that's the
[1:36:41] thunder that are written in between
[1:36:46] you can read the letter all along
[1:36:49] you will never know about the 30 pieces
[1:36:54] but mordecai must be there
[1:36:57] to know what happened to tell you
[1:37:00] if you chase him by the ladder you won't
[1:37:03] find it
[1:37:06] because it's a tangle
[1:37:10] where is he written in the bible where
[1:37:11] is he written in the bible you won't
[1:37:13] find it
[1:37:13] like that it's connected to the bible
[1:37:17] but it has been hidden
[1:37:20] when you read the king is saying we need
[1:37:22] to destroy
[1:37:23] you take that same bible you give to
[1:37:25] mordechai he look
[1:37:27] heaven is behind this he's trying to
[1:37:30] destroy you
[1:37:30] and he have given the king so many
[1:37:34] pieces of silver what kind of bible are
[1:37:36] you reading
[1:37:38] let me see the king is trying to destroy
[1:37:40] modica
[1:37:42] do you need glasses get glasses mordecai
[1:37:44] get grasses
[1:37:46] heaven is trying to destroy he's trying
[1:37:48] to destroy the king
[1:37:49] and this is what he's trying to do the
[1:37:52] bible
[1:37:52] become a new same
[1:37:56] same letter different view
[1:38:00] based on who is interpreting it
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:07] if you want to know the true concept you
[1:38:10] must go to mordechai
[1:38:12] because he is the one that can give you
[1:38:15] the living letter
[1:38:17] and the written the logos and the rhema
[1:38:19] he gives you both of them
[1:38:23] because he is the one that can afford
[1:38:26] the seal
[1:38:30] and tell you the road that you see
[1:38:32] coming up there
[1:38:33] it's death his message is the message of
[1:38:37] heaven
[1:38:39] wait you're gonna see and you see
[1:38:40] somebody standing the king is saying
[1:38:42] we're going to kill all the jews he said
[1:38:44] what did i tell you
[1:38:47] it is not the king he's on the white
[1:38:49] horse
[1:38:51] he's an impersonator
[1:38:55] verse 7 and the sum of money that
[1:38:58] hammond promised to pay the king's
[1:39:00] treasures
[1:39:02] also he gave him the copy of the riding
[1:39:04] of the decree
[1:39:06] let me drop this to save time verse 11
[1:39:09] and oh this is 10 again esther spoke to
[1:39:12] attack
[1:39:13] heter and gave him commandment to modica
[1:39:16] all the king
[1:39:17] servant and the people of the king's
[1:39:19] provinces
[1:39:20] do know that whosoever whether man or
[1:39:23] woman
[1:39:24] shall go to the king into the inner
[1:39:26] court we already explained you this
[1:39:28] who is not called you must be a leaver
[1:39:31] to go in the
[1:39:32] body of holies there is only water
[1:39:35] one law the law of moses of him to be
[1:39:38] put to water
[1:39:40] so we found out here that esther even
[1:39:43] though she was chosen
[1:39:45] everybody here she was subject to a
[1:39:48] death
[1:39:50] death to approach the king enter
[1:39:53] inner chamber amen
[1:39:57] that's why ephraim was afraid he doesn't
[1:40:00] want to come out
[1:40:02] but mordecai say you must cross that
[1:40:05] death
[1:40:06] if you don't overcome the first death
[1:40:09] that block you to access the king
[1:40:12] you will not be able to overcome the
[1:40:16] death by heaven
[1:40:18] everybody the power to overcome the
[1:40:21] second deaths
[1:40:23] you must overcome the first death first
[1:40:26] you must die to yourself first
[1:40:30] if you want to die kill heaven
[1:40:37] so we found that it's death to enter
[1:40:40] in the king's presence and it's also
[1:40:42] death
[1:40:43] that is coming from the enemy heaven to
[1:40:46] death
[1:40:48] ephraim is afraid of both of them
[1:40:51] ephraim doesn't want to get into the
[1:40:53] presence of the king he doesn't want to
[1:40:55] be born
[1:40:56] and yet there is another death that is
[1:40:57] waiting on him
[1:40:59] esther broke into the first death we
[1:41:01] know that happened
[1:41:03] by the problem saying the bible say the
[1:41:06] soul that sinneth
[1:41:07] he shall die the word death means water
[1:41:11] in other words the soul that disbelief
[1:41:14] the word of god
[1:41:15] shall finally separate from you
[1:41:18] now death if i die now or
[1:41:22] any water christian would die
[1:41:25] it would not be separation from god
[1:41:28] because he died here with my word and
[1:41:31] believe
[1:41:31] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:41:34] but you will be separated from one
[1:41:37] another
[1:41:38] it's just a separation brother problem
[1:41:41] is saying here
[1:41:42] when you are a christian when you are
[1:41:44] born again
[1:41:46] when you are already here on the first
[1:41:48] banquet
[1:41:49] the death to the soul doesn't do
[1:41:51] anything to you
[1:41:53] yet somebody is not under
[1:41:57] jurisdiction yet it's heaven
[1:42:01] how do we get him off are we there
[1:42:05] praise be the name of the lord when god
[1:42:08] created
[1:42:09] adam in the garden of eden we go
[1:42:12] downtown
[1:42:13] it's just when you saw in this avenue
[1:42:15] like you in eternity
[1:42:17] amen when death when adam was created
[1:42:21] actually in the garden of eden
[1:42:23] adam was not created as a baby
[1:42:26] adam was created by children after
[1:42:29] sin was entered to the human race then
[1:42:33] men begin to be born by a woman
[1:42:36] and job says that a man born of a woman
[1:42:39] his days are water very few
[1:42:42] and full of water why because death
[1:42:46] entering in
[1:42:48] now we are growing we are growing we are
[1:42:50] growing
[1:42:51] we are growing we are strong after a
[1:42:53] while we begin to wake up in the morning
[1:42:55] we have backache ever clear
[1:42:59] so when you look at this chart
[1:43:03] roman says for the earnest expectation
[1:43:06] of the creature
[1:43:08] whether for the manifestation of the son
[1:43:10] of god
[1:43:11] for the creature was made subject to
[1:43:14] vanity
[1:43:16] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:43:19] has subjected
[1:43:20] the same in hope remember the word put
[1:43:23] on the suggestion
[1:43:24] paul is saying here that when man fell
[1:43:28] man was given the jurisdiction of the
[1:43:31] earth
[1:43:32] when he fell by sin paul
[1:43:35] is saying that nature also fell by
[1:43:38] default
[1:43:40] not that nature sin but because
[1:43:43] nature was under man automatically
[1:43:46] nature fell
[1:43:49] paul continued he said because the
[1:43:52] creature itself
[1:43:54] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:43:56] of water
[1:43:58] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:44:00] the children of god
[1:44:02] paul says that just as christ is coming
[1:44:06] to save you to rescue you and to bring
[1:44:09] you
[1:44:09] back again to eden god will not
[1:44:12] only save men but god will
[1:44:16] also save the creation that fell on the
[1:44:20] man
[1:44:21] that's why you repent you get baptized
[1:44:25] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:44:28] the holy ghost
[1:44:29] that's the reason why the earth also go
[1:44:32] through the same process
[1:44:34] brother branham said through the water
[1:44:36] of noah it was the baptism
[1:44:38] when jesus died on the cross he shed his
[1:44:41] blood
[1:44:42] now there is fire coming up because the
[1:44:44] creation also
[1:44:46] shall be delivered just like you not
[1:44:48] only are you wanting the black dog to be
[1:44:51] kicked out
[1:44:52] nature also doesn't like the black dog
[1:45:00] let me help you up there was a man
[1:45:04] by the name of legion
[1:45:07] you got it now you got it now did you
[1:45:10] get it yeah
[1:45:11] you want me to explain legion was a
[1:45:14] normal man
[1:45:16] he was living fine and some
[1:45:19] because of his lifestyle demon came
[1:45:23] and began to live with him
[1:45:26] he could not take it he went
[1:45:29] all the way and begin to live in the
[1:45:31] grave until when he heard
[1:45:34] that jesus christ was coming legion ran
[1:45:37] quickly he said i suffered this for so
[1:45:40] long
[1:45:41] please come and deliver me from devils
[1:45:44] you cannot be comfortable with demon in
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:50] you are not meant to live with devils
[1:45:56] you cannot condone with evil spirit
[1:46:00] you cannot be pleasing on pornography
[1:46:03] that is not correct are you there
[1:46:06] when jesus when legion so crushed
[1:46:10] he says this is my deliverance son of
[1:46:12] man
[1:46:13] son of man the people say keep your
[1:46:16] mouth shut
[1:46:16] he said son of david son of david
[1:46:20] why it is my deliverance i need to get
[1:46:23] this blindness
[1:46:24] out of me are you there
[1:46:29] god said fine i'm gonna remove the
[1:46:33] devils
[1:46:34] the devil said please we don't just want
[1:46:37] to go in the air help us
[1:46:40] fund creation
[1:46:44] we got it now we need a creation
[1:46:48] that is not human that we're gonna get
[1:46:51] there
[1:46:51] the devil did not understand that even
[1:46:54] creation is crying for him
[1:46:58] god said where do you want to go they
[1:47:00] say to the
[1:47:01] people he said go when they put the
[1:47:03] devil in the pig

[1:53:30] there is somebody who's accompanying god
[1:53:34] his name is the destroyer
[1:53:39] hallelujah amen
[1:53:42] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 10
[1:53:44] neither murmur year
[1:53:46] as some of them also murmur and where
[1:53:49] destroy of the water
[1:53:53] the same person psalm 78
[1:53:56] verse 49 he cast upon them
[1:54:00] the fairness of his anger rough
[1:54:03] and indignation and trouble by sending
[1:54:06] water
[1:54:08] so david explained to us that this
[1:54:11] destroyer that destroyed the children of
[1:54:13] god
[1:54:14] was an evil angel
[1:54:19] who is deaf
[1:54:22] are you there hang on
[1:54:25] hallelujah first corinthians 15
[1:54:29] for cease by man came what adam
[1:54:33] by men also came the water jesus of the
[1:54:36] water
[1:54:38] i am the resurrection and water life
[1:54:41] so as in adam all did water
[1:54:46] even so in who shall be
[1:54:50] all be known water
[1:54:53] if we were represented by death in the
[1:54:56] first adam
[1:54:57] we are also represented by life
[1:55:00] in the second adam
[1:55:04] are you there it's a sandwich
[1:55:08] are you there the last enemy
[1:55:12] that shall be destroyed so death is an
[1:55:16] enemy
[1:55:18] death is a destroyer
[1:55:21] death is an evil angel death
[1:55:25] is an enemy and he'll be the last one
[1:55:29] to be destroyed i'm going with death
[1:55:33] are we okay you tired
[1:55:36] hallelujah hebrew two for as much
[1:55:40] then as the children are partaking of
[1:55:43] flesh and blood
[1:55:45] because we the children of god we were
[1:55:47] born
[1:55:48] with this flesh come on he
[1:55:51] also jesus christ himself likewise
[1:55:54] took part of the same in other words god
[1:55:57] also said
[1:55:58] my children are body are made in the
[1:56:01] body of flesh
[1:56:02] i'm going to make myself also a body of
[1:56:04] flesh to be like them
[1:56:06] he came in the body called jesus jesus
[1:56:09] is god that what is the purpose
[1:56:13] that through death
[1:56:16] anybody he might destroy
[1:56:20] him the head the water
[1:56:25] that is there
[1:56:28] so this angel death
[1:56:32] is a power
[1:56:36] everybody clear death is a destroyer
[1:56:40] called the death angel
[1:56:43] he's an evil angel he's an enemy
[1:56:47] he's a power controlled by
[1:56:50] the devil because he is the one that
[1:56:54] have the power of water
[1:56:56] control or under the jurisdiction
[1:57:02] everybody of the devil
[1:57:05] or satan anybody
[1:57:09] to destroy satan that had the power of
[1:57:13] water that is who the devil
[1:57:16] is hallelujah
[1:57:19] brother branham see where our wrestle is
[1:57:23] today
[1:57:25] see what the deaf angel is now you
[1:57:28] understand why brother branham is
[1:57:30] calling him deaf angel
[1:57:31] he never gave you a scripture what the
[1:57:34] death angel is
[1:57:36] it's a spiritual water wickedness in
[1:57:39] high places
[1:57:41] great places big places
[1:57:44] ever clear for the sake of time
[1:57:48] but on his road up here i imagine there
[1:57:51] was a decision when the devil looked
[1:57:53] down
[1:57:54] death you want to kill christ he said
[1:57:58] if that is life then i'm wrong but if
[1:58:01] it's not life
[1:58:02] i shall sting him when the devil was
[1:58:05] looking
[1:58:05] at jesus christ i shall kill him down
[1:58:08] there at the cross
[1:58:10] and at the conference in hell
[1:58:13] the devil's angel was sent
[1:58:16] forth the angel of water so death is a
[1:58:20] destroyer
[1:58:21] death is an angel an evil angel death
[1:58:25] is an enemy death is a spiritual power
[1:58:28] under the jurisdiction of satan
[1:58:32] everybody clear hallelujah
[1:58:36] revelation 6 verse 8 when he
[1:58:39] opened the fourth seal i heard the voice
[1:58:42] of the four beasts come and see
[1:58:45] say come and see and i look and behold
[1:58:48] a water a pelvis his name
[1:58:51] that sat on him was water
[1:58:55] death and water
[1:58:58] ephraim i'm gonna
[1:59:02] wrestle you i'm gonna rest from you
[1:59:05] and i will be a plug to
[1:59:08] death and to who
[1:59:13] the grave hell
[1:59:17] this is not the hell that the other
[1:59:19] people go not to me
[1:59:22] everybody his name that sat on him
[1:59:26] was death and he'll follow him
[1:59:30] and power was given unto him in other
[1:59:33] words they took that angel
[1:59:35] and gave him in jurisdiction
[1:59:39] because barbara branham said that man
[1:59:40] was satan
[1:59:42] and satan had the power of what death
[1:59:45] they gave him again the jurisdiction
[1:59:47] go ahead and do it power was given over
[1:59:51] him
[1:59:52] over the fourth part of the earth to do
[1:59:54] what
[1:59:56] with water and water
[2:00:01] he's killing with the sword
[2:00:06] is killing with water or feminine
[2:00:12] and then he's killing with what
[2:00:15] how can you kill with death
[2:00:18] and with the water
[2:00:22] i told you the beasts of the earth don't
[2:00:23] like the devil

[2:00:33] antichrist call who help
[2:00:36] followed him which watched his fourth
[2:00:39] point scheme
[2:00:41] anticlass the white horse killed
[2:00:44] by water being antichrist spiritual
[2:00:48] water
[2:00:49] is killing by death check you want
[2:00:52] horseradish
[2:00:55] number two red horse killed by water
[2:00:59] check host red horse heart
[2:01:04] political power remember the power of a
[2:01:07] man
[2:01:08] goes to politics when church and state
[2:01:11] united
[2:01:12] black horse shows when he give out his
[2:01:16] doctrine
[2:01:18] and she did there with her fornication
[2:01:21] and he weigh out their what
[2:01:24] hunger what they give for food for a
[2:01:28] balance and the pennies
[2:01:31] third as the six year old the third seal
[2:01:34] this
[2:01:34] is water by fall
[2:01:39] second seal by hunger
[2:01:42] third seal spiritual death
[2:01:45] antichrist white horse rather over there
[2:01:49] everybody clear the penthouse got the
[2:01:52] three horses mixed together
[2:01:55] brother branham spoke it and you saw it
[2:01:58] where it's coming from
[2:02:00] now when the lion was first created
[2:02:02] because he killed by the beast
[2:02:04] of the earth he was a friend of man it's
[2:02:07] the endeavor
[2:02:08] that make him do that in the millennium
[2:02:12] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[2:02:13] together the lions are eat strong
[2:02:17] normal stake like the bullock and shall
[2:02:20] lay down in the bullock
[2:02:22] they shall not hurt or destroy in the
[2:02:24] millennium
[2:02:25] the devil will be gone it's the
[2:02:28] devil that make the world be stale
[2:02:32] and reap and eat and things like that
[2:02:36] the way they do it's certain that does
[2:02:39] that
[2:02:39] they also want to be free from satan
[2:02:42] because
[2:02:43] at the beginning the lion was eating
[2:02:45] grass
[2:02:49] now you put him on the stake meat lover
[2:02:53] but greater was he that was in daniel
[2:02:57] then he that was in the lion see greater
[2:03:00] was he
[2:03:01] in the prophet than he that was in the
[2:03:04] lion it's too power hey but here
[2:03:08] don't worry we're heading quick now he
[2:03:11] was
[2:03:12] he has a name called death none of the
[2:03:15] other radio or none of the other horses
[2:03:18] or no one term that this rather ever
[2:03:20] wrote
[2:03:21] they didn't have that man had no name
[2:03:24] but now he's called death it's not
[2:03:27] mentioned
[2:03:28] he is revealed now what he is death
[2:03:32] now we could linger on that for a sermon
[2:03:35] and make a real plan but anything that
[2:03:38] is
[2:03:38] entire that is against the will has
[2:03:42] to be because that is on there is only
[2:03:45] two subjects life and water the entire
[2:03:49] he is death because the word as
[2:03:52] we shall see later is what
[2:03:57] watch now but he was
[2:04:00] 68 million put to death
[2:04:04] to protest the first roman church rome
[2:04:07] wonder he could impersonate himself
[2:04:11] in the personified name called
[2:04:14] death the devil
[2:04:18] impersonate himself in death but
[2:04:21] death is not the devil
[2:04:25] relax
[2:04:28] now god only
[2:04:32] knows how many he caused spiritually to
[2:04:35] die
[2:04:35] to spiritually die by his anti-bible
[2:04:38] word teaching
[2:04:39] this is one he put this this is the one
[2:04:43] he put 68 million to the sword
[2:04:45] and killed him and probably literally
[2:04:48] billion dies spiritually
[2:04:50] on his false teaching no wonder he could
[2:04:53] take the name of what
[2:04:57] brother branham said he could take the
[2:04:59] name
[2:05:00] he was not deaf
[2:05:04] revelation 20. take that and then i'll
[2:05:07] go to the airport
[2:05:10] revelation 20. what is the mystery of
[2:05:14] death
[2:05:17] revelation 20 verse 7
[2:05:21] the devil is not death the devil have
[2:05:25] power over death
[2:05:28] but death and the devil are separated
[2:05:31] even though the is called death
[2:05:35] it's a tado higa
[2:05:39] because he's killing revelation 20 verse
[2:05:43] 7.
[2:05:44] and when the thousand years are expired
[2:05:47] who
[2:05:48] the devil shall be lose out of his
[2:05:50] prison
[2:05:51] anybody clear job to verse 10
[2:05:54] and there satan
[2:05:57] that deceived them was cast into the
[2:06:01] lake of water
[2:06:03] who is casting the lake of fire satan
[2:06:07] jumped to verse 14
[2:06:10] and and were cast into the water
[2:06:16] so there will be a time the devil
[2:06:18] himself will because
[2:06:20] then death end so death
[2:06:24] and hell and the devil are separated
[2:06:29] are you there this angel the destroyer
[2:06:33] the deaf angel the evil angel the enemy
[2:06:36] the power always work with hell anybody
[2:06:44] care
[2:06:45] i just want you to see that fear not i
[2:06:48] am he that was
[2:06:49] he that is and welcome i'm the first and
[2:06:52] last i have the keys of hell and what
[2:06:56] not the keys of satan not certain
[2:06:59] why i have overcome and conquered both
[2:07:02] water
[2:07:03] and that is buffed
[2:07:07] and death itself
[2:07:10] had this itself hell
[2:07:13] always follow death in the natural
[2:07:17] when natural man dies hell
[2:07:20] follows him that is the water
[2:07:24] the grave hades and uh see
[2:07:27] that's in the natural but in the
[2:07:30] spiritual
[2:07:32] it's the lack of water all right
[2:07:35] it's into eternal separation i'm gonna
[2:07:38] explain that later
[2:07:40] keep that down so we understand that
[2:07:43] death
[2:07:44] is followed by hell hell another name
[2:07:47] is called the hades that's why paul
[2:07:50] could say
[2:07:50] oh death where is your sting oh
[2:07:54] where is your victory death
[2:07:58] this angel called death
[2:08:02] called the destroyer the evil angel the
[2:08:05] enemy
[2:08:06] the spiritual power is the highest
[2:08:09] level i'm almost going to the airport
[2:08:14] he is the highest level
[2:08:18] that satan can reach
[2:08:23] are you there the highest level
[2:08:27] satan can achieve in your life is to
[2:08:30] kill you
[2:08:31] once he kill you there is no more bullet
[2:08:34] for the devil
[2:08:36] the devil can torment you torment you
[2:08:39] torment you
[2:08:40] block you here block you there but his
[2:08:42] top
[2:08:43] weapon is death
[2:08:50] that is the end of satan's dominion
[2:08:53] his domain can only come that far to the
[2:08:56] river
[2:08:58] and his power is cut off
[2:09:02] it is that satan has the power of what
[2:09:06] the jurisdiction but thank be to the
[2:09:09] living god
[2:09:10] who has the power of water beyond the
[2:09:13] shadow of water
[2:09:15] what a marvelous thing the devil
[2:09:19] assured fellow all right and he carried
[2:09:22] the power of death within him
[2:09:24] with him but that is all the father he
[2:09:27] can go
[2:09:28] his death but then we found out
[2:09:31] that faith stepping them at the death
[2:09:34] then faith step in and recognize a god
[2:09:37] of resurrection
[2:09:38] are you there so where the devil stop
[2:09:42] god start
[2:09:46] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:09:49] lord
[2:09:50] so the devil usually start that little
[2:09:53] flare
[2:09:54] and so watch it he tried to cut off the
[2:09:57] move of god
[2:09:59] every time he will do that and he shall
[2:10:01] still
[2:10:02] and he is still the same devil use the
[2:10:05] same technique that he did in the old
[2:10:07] days
[2:10:08] he still uses them today we could only
[2:10:10] read the old testament
[2:10:12] then we learn the tactics of the devil
[2:10:15] how he does
[2:10:16] so we found out that his power he had
[2:10:18] power
[2:10:19] and that power was death but
[2:10:22] he had no power beyond that
[2:10:26] just death ends his power then beyond
[2:10:30] death faith sees the god of resurrection
[2:10:33] after the devil's end of
[2:10:37] power of death then his water the devil
[2:10:40] can do no more

[2:10:52] just don't want to know him but i want
[2:10:54] to know him
[2:10:55] in the power of his resurrection because
[2:10:59] the resurrection
[2:11:00] is beyond death
