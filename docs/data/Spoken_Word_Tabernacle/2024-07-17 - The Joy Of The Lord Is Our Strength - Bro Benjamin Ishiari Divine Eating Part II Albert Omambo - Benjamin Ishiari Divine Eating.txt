prophetic song right there I'm sorry I'm not the one preaching tonight it's a convention so I got two guest speakers tonight and everything will be okay all right you ready let's start with the first one brother the Benjamin is [Applause] sh so you pull on the gift of the Lord and let's hear from Heaven tonight glory to God Amen let's go we only believe hallu [Music] all [Music] [Music] all are

the precious name of Jesus Christ my name is brother Benjamin um Benjamin um family here spoke the word Tabernacle um so let's get to the word let's pray dear Lord Heavenly Father Lord God you're the God know father Mo out of Lord father Lord God bless father God people come here God father father us God us the first scripture that I wanted to read today was Revelation 66 am and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine amen my second scripture I wanted to read was act 16 verses 25 through 26 you say amen and that midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken yes sir and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's hands bands were loosed yes sir in the last SC want to read is Nehemiah 8 verse 10 you there say Amen then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them from whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto our Lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strengthen amen so that's my title for today the joy of the Lord is our strength see when I was meditating on this I was thinking se you may be seated I was thinking um sometimes we don't really understand God sometimes we think of our life as like a fairy tale or something that oh every time it has to be happy if if it's sunny outside I'm I'm happy if it's raining I'm not happy so but when you really get higher with God yes sir when you get into a revelation yes sir we're going into the back part of God's mind right now the part that confuses the devil Hallelujah if we go to um where with Paul and Silas oh no let's start with um Revelation 6 but the brandom said the oil is the Holy Ghost I'm paraphrasing I'm going to read the quotes we know the oil is the Holy Ghost and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation so in the third seal um paragraph 305 now oil the third SE yeah 63 now oil symbolizes the spirit the Holy Spirit I'll give you a few verses if you want to I won't and the next one the third seal 306 and wine symb symbolizes stimulation of Revelation so we read that in when God put the people in that age through turmoil now us as carnal beings we look at it as like we would look at it oh why did God put us through this we live in a world where if you don't know if you don't really know much things happen things bad happen in this life sometimes it blows your mind like how could this even happen how could God even how can God even allow this thing to happen but amongst all those things touch not the oil and the wine [Music] [Applause] God touch not the oil and the wine what is the mystery behind this oil and this [Applause] wine and my title for today is the joy of the Lord is our strength so what is the stimulation oh oh oh I'm get oh we said I already read the one symbolizes the stimulation right so what is the stimulation we he that the stimulation of Revelation so is it it maybe is it just it maybe but what really is this stimulation what stimulates [Applause] us for the brandom says in the third seal chap on paragraph 308 when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation look what he says Glory I feel it right now stimulated with [Applause] [Music] [Applause] joy so it's not a stimulation of just playing [Applause] around it's a stimulation of joy and joy connects with the [Applause] Revelation Lord help Lord help me so Joy connects with the Revelation so no [Applause] Revelation he says in another um the same the same um the same same message on the third seal paragraph 318 they become so stimulated over the Revelation that they Vindicated all right the promise yes sir now oh now oh M there broke out the joy of stimulation till the people said they're drunk on new wine so when the people of God were in shackles I forgot what age that was specifically that I read from I don't the Dark Ages uhhuh when the people of God were in shackles when apus and silus were bound [Music] up it confuses the devil completely it looks like how I have these people Locked In Chains the chains of sin the chains of lust but all of a sudden the devil just sees they're out of it now what could what could be in a religion that take people away from the lust of this flesh what could be in a oh just come to church St glass windows what could be in a a religion in a church that takes people from from sin and brings them to God they have to see the joy of the Lord they have not see they have to feel they have to feel the joy of the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord which is given by Revelation so when they receive a revelation they automatically receive [Applause] Joy if you don't if you don't receive that Revelation you'll you'll go back to brother brandom even said um when that was in the up um he he dramatized in the um in this message through the third sale yes he said if there was in the upper room and they thought oh we've been here for a few days now we must have already got it you know let's just go out and preach our our sermon let's he said it like that let's just go out and preach our seron we we've got it we've been here praise the Lord Jesus uh I give I give him two days you have to wait till the stimulation comes till the Revelation comes and the joy of the Lord is our strength so they that wait on the Lord shall renew their [Applause] strength how do they renew their strength by waiting how could waiting renew your [Applause] strength waiting on the Lord renews your [Applause] [Music] strength so what happened between that span of time [Applause] of they shall even run and not grow weary that's what Joy does to [Applause] you the ones that wait shall renew their strength and they shall even run and not grow weary so what's what's what's stimulating that running and not going weary it's the joy of the [Music] Lord because when God came when you were waiting when you were in patience I'm perfecting your faith cuz patience what yes sir patience perfects your faith so that's why that's why we must be patient that's why that's why it's not a picnic God God knows us better than we know ourselves what we think is good for us but we think will work when the little kid gets mad and he's throwing like how we said he's throwing a temper tantrum what we think that what the gentle parenting what you think will work oh give from the candy and then he keeps on doing that until we grow that's not how God works even if he so even if we God does what we think he should do for us it will not help you so we should we should be thankful for the whoopings [Applause] the Lord chastised and and rebukes those that he loves the joy of the Lord joy of the Lord in the um in the third seal paragraph 314 uhhuh so you see wine represents stimulation of Revelation that's right and when the Holy Ghost fell yes sir and they seen the fire of God fall upon them yes sir my that begin to stimulate them right and the first thing you know they got so stimulated to the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by the Revelation by God's here it is God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them no no sorry made it plain to them they was happy about it God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them amen here was a man here saying this is that this is that and there it was being Vindicated by the same sign that we have today there is stimulation by [Music] Revelation Joy cannot be faked [Applause] with Paul and Silas they were in a prison house and there were other people in that prison house with them that were not Believers so they're already at they're at the lowest of the lows their s their sin took them to the prison house [Music] the things of this world LED them to that prison [Applause] house the only way you can really get somebody to thirst for what you believe if they see it that it's [Applause] real when they were when they were at their lowest and they they had anything but Faith but they hear Paul and [Applause] silence cuz remember God opened the doors for them too it just said that they heard so what did it do to them when they it must have done [Applause] something it must have done something it stirred up something in them to and God opened the doors for all of them so now they have something different that's it now they heard they heard something real this time because in this world that we we have now we already in a Christian Nation so the the the Christianity will not work the faith it will not work [Music] [Applause] oh I go I go to church we have Bible study every Wednesday me me too they have to see something and they have to know that is real even in the message that's it it's nothing that you do it's the stimulation of revulation gives you Joy it renews your strength so when you're in the prison and you're clapping when your strength is renewed they see [Applause] that oh Lord God Lord Lord heavenly father they that wait upon the Lord yes brother shall renew their strength yes and brother and if I could zoom in on that same one that same quote I read and it said and the first thing you know they got so stimulated till the people actually thought that they were drunk and um in the same SC in the same in the same message he says that it made them act as if a drunk person would act so with the people in the world that some people especially religious people if you're going there with not without real real Revelation that was trouble you they have a type of anchor in what they do they will never compromise for what they do it could be drinking it could be just random anything but they're firm about it cuz it's in them so if you come in with a with a um a coat that that's not really in you it's on [Applause] you just them Simply Having the strength that will automat you automatically will lose just their persistence and just they really believe what they do is right and you not really sure just that alone you already lost they say Real Recognize is [Applause] real so so it made these people act as if they were drunk so the stimulation is so deep The Sinner is even looking like are they drunk so it's the it's the opposite what I'm trying to say is the word of God the revelation of God does not put a religious spirit on you because the religious spirit was the FES when they saw Jesus eating with the Sinners they said why is this man eating with Sinners Jesus would rather eat with the sinners than eat with the Pharisees I'd rather you be cold because the because the Sinners they they they they be chilling man they don't care they just chilling the church betrayed Jesus it wasn't it wasn't at the center that was that's why he said he's crucified on the PO he's not crucified out there in the [Applause] world so the so the nonchalantness of The Sinner the one he's just chilling man he don't got no put on man he yeah that's why a true Son of God I know you you all experienced this when you when you speak with a a sinner it's different because sometimes they they've heard this before they've heard this before but man I I like you brother Charles I like you just I don't know I just like your um your um different you're you're different it's the same religion this but it's something different inside that's real so until they see something real until that until they see something real until they they see something real they follow they don't understand but they just they just love this [Applause] presence a great atmosphere they will continue with you and then they start they just start dropping certain things they start they start doing things that they never expected them to do before they start thinking things that and they're learning it from a you a real believer because they see that this man is not faking it I can talk with this man I can reason with this man he has wisdom he knows how to divide the word cuz if you a hypocrite oh you just rebuke rebuke rebuke rebuke all the time and it's not led by the [Applause] spirit I said the O Brother BR said the oil was the Holy Ghost and the sons of God are led by the spirit of God the sons of God are not controlled by the spirit of God they are led by the spirit of God this is all going back to the things you can't control the the oil and the wine so until you get that stimulation of Revelation the Holy Ghost [Music] you can't really be like Jesus you can't really spread Jesus in this world because because they won't see the joy they see these people are [Applause] miserable that's why I said that's why the sinner is confident and the Christian is they you think they want to go to that they don't want to go to that they have to see the joy of the Lord be your [Applause] strength the people the people in the hood they have a revelation there's something in them that's that's they're really confident they're really if if you don't have that they will manipulate [Applause] you sometimes a brother said it was like oh man like oh there just a bunch of thugs it's like that was like a brother and I was like no I was like hold on you you won't say that to their face we we cuz the Holy Spirit removes the unnecessary bad but that confidence brings them things just that alone just the law of the the confidence in them just the law of confidence they'll go to the basketball court and everybody's all and they score all the points they can't it it they one they're not even good sometimes just that confidence that scares the [Applause] people so me going there as a Son of God I'm not scared of [Music] them sometime I even check your hand brother I shake I shake your hand and I I like I like that confidence and but I'm I'm not they see they they don't know they talk trash they're cousing like that but that confidence that that they use I said I like that I want a person like that on my team it's a perversion of it so if you are a Christian and the drawer of the Lord is your strength cuz you've been given Revelation it should give you a Divine confidence And when they see that Divine confidence they won't when they see that Divine confidence they'll see that something's real with these [Applause] people because the other people they they they just kind of Pat me in the back but I'm still talking about the people in the hood now they still strong they they can read people easily they can read people easily I know they can read people easily but when they but when they see something real be like man B you different man man some of the stuff you understood I'm olding you I'm just understanding it now because you took a stand people will always respect the [Applause] stand so do not wave her left and right do not move to it from the left or move to it with it from the right stick with it Forward forsake the people that you want to please and stuff like that in the future if they're God's people they'll look at you and say what you did was good brother and they'll walk with and you gain a soul everything works for our good this friend that I love so much I had to let him go for the gospel but then I continue on I continue on and then the same stand that I took saves him now he's my brother if I would have compromised with him right [Applause] [Music] there stand h stand for Hol stand for righteous and be counted among them that shall with you [Applause] stand the joy of the Lord that's why Christian should be [Applause] happy if I see you when you're a Christian and you're not happy I'm already like something is wrong we make we make Christianity like depression like oh you know ever since I came to the Lord you know the Lord has been good lord is good Lord is sweet but when you were in the world [Applause] 100% just standing and walking with God by faith it may be hard in the beginning it may feel like you know something's that's ups and downs all the times we've all been through that but eventually there'll be the cream of the crop [Applause] it will be something that goes down to the source of who you are to where you can't even go back anymore and this is now your reality now you actually are happy that's why Jesus can either only he can only look at he can only Bring The Sinner he can only look at Peter who says depart from me I'm a man or I'm with sin because there's like there's a law in this world that's it it's like a magnet there's a North Pole and a South Pole if I can really say what I'm trying to say if you basically I'm trying to say that the only difference between a sinner and a Christian is the Holy Ghost so a true Christian if he sees a sinner you can get the same thing I have but if you that's why I said I'd rather you hot or cold cuz if you were cold I can make you hot and if you are hot stay hot to get hotter but because Thou Are art [Music] lukewarm that's why Jesus could sit comfortably with the sinners and not compromise he could sit with them and not compromise that doesn't mean all your friends you hang with Sinners because he was still with his disciples the majority of the [Applause] [Music] time but when he sees a sinner he's not [Applause] nervous his faith is not hindered he has the fullness of the godhead botom [Applause] and if you are [Applause] God Jesus had the fullest of the godhead body and if we are God and join hirs with Jesus Christ it's fuu [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's a beautiful Revelation that gives you stimulation that gives you Joy that gives you strength that makes you run and not grow weary that makes you run and will not faint heav father God am I good on time teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait um GL so for my text my text here today as I'm winding up the joy of the Lord is our strength and the joy of the Lord only comes by Revelation so if you are in a position in your life where you know you a new a Christian or you've been in the message for very long period of time and it's just not you know you just don't feel it just feels like put on it feels dragging when you get the Revelation you will see the joy of the Lord and the the joy of the Lord the The Joy the real Joy it's something that you actually feel I don't know why I feel this way but I I I feel this way that's the only reason any of us can be here today saved by grace Sinners because we received that Revelation that gave us joy and by the grace of God we continued with it by the grace of God only so it's something so hold steadfast to the faith God bless [Applause] you glory to God

king chapter 19 if you're there can you say amen amen now first king Chapter 19 Verse 5 says and as he lay and slept under a jener tree behold then an angel touched him and said to him arise and eat and he looked and behold there there was a cake bacon on the co and the Cru of the water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink and he went in the strength of the meat for 40 days and 40 nights onto herab the Mount of God may the Lord God bless the reading with his word y'all may be seated am so in this scripture it's it's about the Prophet Elijah and Elijah had a great journey in front of him and brother Bram said the great journey in front of him was the top of tribulation and the the prophet of God brother Brenham also said it was God who was holding Elijah to sleep and it was God who was waking him up and it was also God who fed him because that we know that in the the angel of the Lord is God himself so I would like to read or at least touch a little bit here in communion 1962 the prophet of God was talking about how our body requires constant food constant nurturing because if you go one day without eating you'll get weak you go the next day you'll get weaker they go the third G you go you go the Third Day by the time you arrive to the third day you'll be tremendously weaker now if you go with me to First John chapter 4 I mean John chapter 4 verse 32 I'll get today if you're there can you say Amen now in John chapter 4 verse 32 the scripture says this was um Jesus after talk to the we at the well the scripture says but he said unto them talk to his disciples I have meat to eat that you know not of therefore said the disciples one to another have any man brought him ought to eat and Jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and and finish his work over here Jesus is talk because the disciple probably with the whole entire day they probably didn't see Jesus so they came to Jesus ask him if he ate and Jesus said already ate but no man has seen Jesus eat any food and Jesus said that the food that he ate the meat that he ate was to do the will of God not just hearing but also doing it not just being hearer of the word but actual uh doers of the word and if we keep going to 35 say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh Harvest behold I say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest and he that reapeth receive wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that Seth and he that reapeth may Rejoice together and therein is that saying true one Seth and another one reapeth I sent you to the reap I sent you to reap that whereon you bestow no labor other men labor and ye are entered into their labor God already sent us a a prophet that already sold the seed that already sold the um that so dece and all we have to do is just benefit of the labor of it and my subject today will be divine eating part two going beyond your limit because I'm trying to get to the point where we we get to understand what type of food the Elijah eat for him to go through tribulation and just be all right and to start it off in 1960 the prophet was talking about well that's what the Pentecost church as soon as they as soon as he was born and or many other churches when he was born in the kingdom of God he becomes Sons and Daughters of God but we stopped at that when the Pentecostal Church received the gift of speaking a tongue and interpreting and they stopped at that that's no place to stop that's the place to begin why we got onta resources everywhere all things are possible to them that believe everything every promise in the Bible belongs to us people tend to just stop at the outer outer car and think that's where they could just chill and just do whatever they want but some people their promise or their Vision it just stops at the gate instead of advancing but the Bible says and Prophet also says to come up hether little bride that mean you have to go a little bit further yes sir now in 41 the prophet says I haven't got nothing against television there's nice things on there but when a Christian will stay home from church to see some silly play like that there's something happened in that person's life the Holy Spirit went out somewhere you're not about the father's business what what do you think he does what do you think he does when he comes up before the father and has to say that his daughters his children his lovely daughters is wearing some these immoral clothes that they call shorts his daughters now in here um the prophet of God says in another part he says that the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God and that and that's good for you see the the prophet says that it's good for you to read it's good for you to feed on the word of God so when you're not going to church and you're doing something else that mean you're feeding your spirit something else and if going to church is good for you that mean if you're doing anything else but not listening to the word that mean you're destroying your own body that's why in um Galatians 5 it says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the Yoke of bondage that scripture is pretty is pretty self-explain so just stand fast before God set us free and go and the Bible says that he who the son has set free that you're free indeed that you have to stand fast with the with the sun and the Sun is the word because it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh so you have to stand fast with the word it says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the of the flesh for the flesh lust is against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary to one another so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law see this scripture over here because I remember a few weeks ago I had a homework that was due at midnight so I had to stay up and finish my homework but and also my body was tired I was feeling sleepy and it was cold in the house because it was dark it was uh night time but if I would if I were to listen to my body to listen to My Flesh and go to sleep or take a shower then go to sleep I was not going to finish my homework on time and I was not going to submit it to get the full grade that I needed see the scripture say that you have to walk in the spirit and it doesn't just say walk in any type of spirit it says walk in the spirit I saying walk in God itself and if you walk in God you're not going to fulfill the lust of the flesh because if you you can walk in any other Spirits also and you will still fulfill the lust of the flesh because adultery is a spirit and um fornication is a spirit even pornography is a spirit because all those are Spirit and the scripture doesn't just say to walk in any Spirit but to walk in the spirit of God in galatian 6 ver says not be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a mess soth that shall he also reap that's right it tells people to not to not deceive themselves because people tend to think they could just come to the to church to just be a churchgoer and they will still go to heaven or meet the Rapture and I would like to read uh where the Prophet was talking concerning this in the message thirst of 1965 paragraph 178 he says I want you to see another great danger just before we close if you're if you're not if you're not guilty of any of these that's that I've mentioned and that is the danger of neglecting a thirst see you say I have I have the Holy thirst but I'm not guilty brother Brenham of just go and joining a church and the things like this but see to neglect The Thirst if you neglect to satisfy the thirst of water or food you you'll die and if you neglect The Thirst in you for God you will spiritually die and if you drop down to 181 the prophet says so if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll die you Christians you Baptist you Methodist you petorian you you Pentecost you Assemblies of God Oneness Tess threeness whatever you are see don't care that don't matter to me that don't matter nothing to me I don't think it does to God see it's you're an individual you're a unit you'll never go to heaven as a church you're or a denomination you go to heaven as one single person between you and God that's all don't care what church you belong to because some people tend to try to go to a church to hide behind a church that's right thinking just because the church is big oh I'm g go to heaven well my pastor is well known I will go to heaven well my dad is a preacher so I will go to heaven they try to hide behind that and paragraph 183 the prophet of God says and if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe in the Bible and the Holy Spirit to feed upon that you will die Jesus said this in St John 4 the scripture got it right Jesus said that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part but by every single word and the other thing I also noticed about whenever the prophet kept mentioning neglecting the other thing that came to mind is backsliding because neglecting is just another worm of backsliding because if you're neglecting something that mean you're not going to do something you're procrastinating and that's what someone that backslides does that's right and in one in 191 the prophet say so if you're NE if you neglect to eat the Holy Spirit the word of God Jesus said every word shall be by the Holy Spirit and listen now if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it's the genuine Holy Spirit in you it will know the difference now remember the word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on it don't feed on it doesn't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed on education it doesn't feed on Church goinging it doesn't feed on theologies it does there's a lot of difference between an inspired something or a theological standpoint can you imagine there's many people that go to church just to get like a a degree in theology a degree in religion like what are you going to do with that degree are that is that degree um to serve you to go and start debating because we're not in the time to debate with one another anymore and the prophet of God also says if you drop that in7 says now see then you had to be before the world was ever formed your name was put in the lamp's Book of Life and when and then what can you eat the Holy Spirit lives by the word of God and now in Revelation 22:19 the Bible says whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to to it his part will be taken from The Book of Life see how deep it is you can't you cannot the Holy Spirit won't live on those things and then brother BR U proceeds to use the analogy of a dove and a crow and a crow how a crow can eat a wheat and and also eat a dead carcass but when it comes to a dove a dove doesn't eat nothing but beside wheat and if he attempts to even eat a dead carcass it will die it will cow the same thing applies to a Believer a Believer is supposed to only feed on the word of God if you start feeding on any other thing beside the word of God spiritually killing themselves and they're not benefiting from it and the prophet God said that's the way that's the way with a real genuine Christian you don't want to you don't want the things of the world they just eat the world they all they just eat the word of God and that alone what's clean you think the thinking man's filter see they come through that and that alone the dead things of the world is stink to them that mean when you see people doing sin to you doesn't it doesn't um it doesn't give you Joy it doesn't it doesn't give you any Revelation or any stimulation into you and it says greater should be the thirst of any soul of for the Waters of life than to say you belong to a church to The Thirst of the Soul cannot be satisfied the real true thirst it can be perverted you can think you're all right when you join church but that isn't it that won't satisfy the genuine holy holy thirst for God it simply won't do it it just it just not there when you join a church you're just deceiving yourself you're like oh I'll will go to a church and I'll just feel comfortable and just relaxing you're just deceiving yourself as the scripture say because you're not mocking God you're mocking yourself because at the end of the race when you're not there people will start asking well I thought that person was a saint I thought that person he always come to church dress all nice and acting all nice I thought that person was a saint but he ends up going to hell he ends up going through tribulation that's right now in verse eight says for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of this shall of the spirit reap Everlast life Everlasting and let us not be worried in well dooing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not see it says over here that if you're going after the things of the world if you're going after the spirits of the word or or the flesh you will die because if you remember the scripture says Out of the Dust y came and to the dust y shall return that mean the desires of this flesh is only temporary it's only corner it's only a mortal desire meaning if you're Desiring things of this world at some point it will just stop like people that take drugs and stuff like that they they will have that little sensation for a little while but when people come to church and hear the word you're G to have that sensation it will go with you home also unlike when people are addicted to wrong things now the prophet of God says in we would see Jesus paragraph 70 it creat is all right but just doesn't satisfy till you get down to the word and a man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedes out of the mouth of God that's what men shall live by the word of God the word of God is the man's spiritual spiritual Daily Bread is the word of God manifested sir and the prophet of God also speaks about how the um how when you have to eat daily when when you eat daily builds up your resistance to disease that mean it builds up your immune system and the same thing applies with your spiritual aspect because when you eat physically when you eat physically when you when you don't eat physically rather when you don't eat food you become weak that mean when a disease come when a pandemic come it hates you after you get sick the same thing applies with the word if you don't eat the word um constantly somebody can come with a spirit that that they can come in your presence and touch your that you might end up catching that spirit that they have because you because you you didn't fortify yourself that's what I want to get you this whenever I see this picture where it says what are you are what you eat because the the carrot it reinforces the eye and the um Grace reinforces the lung when I was looking at this the first defense mechanism the first defense mechanism of a human of an individual is their body then you have to reinforce that body because your body is like your armor that protects you against disease and and I remember um in the scripture and I remember in the scripture he also speaks about how we do not wrestle against fleshly Blood by principalities and powers and wickedness in high places and he tells us to put on the full armor of God it tells us to put on the full armor of God and brother Brenham says that the whole armor of Christianity is Supernatural look at the Christian armor love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness peace patience is that right see all those things are Christian armor and when you look at the Bible it says to put on your La gra about the truth and we remember Jesus Christ says I am the truth I am the way and he says to put on the breastplate of righteousness and that's melchisedec which is the king of righteousness put on the shoes of preparation of the gospel of peace which is also melkisedek the the prince of peace and it says to put on the shield of faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God and it says put on the helmet of salvation and he says for the grace that Grace being Jesus Christ of God that bringeth salvation have appeared to all men my grace is sufficient to you speaking about Adonai then it says to have the sword of the spirit which is the word of God because in the beginning was the word and Jesus Christ is that word and if you look at that whole entire armor is Jesus Christ himself that mean you're putting Jesus Christ on you you're putting Jesus Christ in you until Jesus Christ is covering your whole entire being now if we go to Matthew um 19 it says or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his good except the first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house either make the free either make the tree good or his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt or his fruit corrupt for his tree is known by his fruit see the first scripture talks about how can um someone for example like Samson how can someone strong like Samson get tied unless if he lets um that person tie him up because Samson the Bible say he was a very strong man he had the strength of God in him because God was with him but the lia is someone that was even the someone that's weaker than him tremendously weaker than him managed to tie him up and certain people in this world in this current time they're getting tied by the devil and they're getting tied because they're letting the devil tie them because you're strong you have God behind you just like Sam have God behind it but samel let himself let himself be subjected to the law of the Flesh and lust after a woman and that lust produced that lust led him to Devy away from God and leted him to get tied up by the enemy and the same thing most people are doing today they're letting themselves get tied by the devil they get letting them themselves get tied by the circumstances of this world they let them themselves get tied by those and on the second part brother brandom gave uh was talking in in 1962 in forsake all things he gave an analogy of a a blind deaf man who was also dumb who kept going to Sunday school and every time he went to Sunday school people asked him why are you comeing to Sunday school and after he was like I'm going to Sunday school to show people where I stand to show the devil and everyone else where I stand and the scripture says to be either either you're a true um your either you're a tree of good or you're a tree a tree of good with his fruit being good or you're a tree of corruption with his fruit being corruption then there's no 50/50 there's no mixed multitude there's no being um lukewarm or neglecting stuff there's no being a backsliding Christian because that time of being a backslide of playing church are over that mean you're supposed to be you're supposed to show yourself as the brother was saying as the brother was saying that real recognize real that mean you're supposed to be real and if you're being real and if you're being real even the devil will notice that you're being real even the devil will have to take more precaution when he's coming towards you when you're being real and in paragraph 34 it says oh generations of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speakers and as excuse me see it says all generations of vipers how can you being evil speak good things meaning this in this generation here when you whenever you open the TV and you look at watching the news and stuff like that the things that are being promoted are things that are contrary to the word that are against God so how can a generation that are raised by looking at those type of things be able to speak good or make good come out of their heart they can't do that because they're raised in a certain uh manner they're raised in a certain way that's right the scripture also say a good man out of the good Treasure of of the heart bringeth forth good things and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things see when I was reading this scripture that the Revelation dropped and I was like because I remember Jesus said no one is good but God so I decided to replace good with God and I was like a god man out of the god Treasure of their heart bringeth forth God thing meaning if we had to break it down a God man is a child God things are like doing Miracles like Jesus um when he multiplied the bread walked on water and stuff like that and when I was pondering on this I was thinking he said a god Treasure of of the heart bringeth forth God things a god treasure and I was like what thing inside a man inside the heart that's Godly that's good and I was thinking and I remember brother BR brother Brandon when he was talking he spoke about how the how us human we have three Department we have the soul spirit and body and usually the spirit take control of the Mind and the Soul goes inside the heart and then within the soul there's a seed inside there and that seed is the part of God and God is the only one that's good so that seed inside you is is that thing that's Pro that's um that's helping you do good things that seed inside you is the thing that's pushing you to do good things but a a evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things because they have no seed in them so there's nothing there's no good in them because before the foundation of the world when God filled our eternity God was all light God was good and when God shrunk himself the emptiness that stayed there that was sin and that evilness if you don't have God in you that mean you have that Darkness you have that sin in you that mean there's not there's nothing within you to to um to do to produce good things there's nothing in you to produce Godly things in Matthew 6 it says for where your treasure is is there where your heart is also where your heart be also see when I read when I read this scripture reminded me of a time when I was younger and inside my house a cousin came in took one of my toys and after that head inside my parents house inside my parents bedroom and since I couldn't reach the light I took a match to try to find it until the match burnt my head after they dropped and the the uh house got on fire but the thing the thing that I want you to draw from that story is because I was a kid and he took what belonged to me I went and pursued it because that toy was my treasure at that time the same thing applies with y'all what is that thing that if somebody take from you that will push you to go pursu it see the other thing that you can also P that can also help you identify what your treasure is when you go to the shower or when you're meditating or when you're working what's the first thing that comes into your mind because David said in the comfort in the multitude of my thought that comfor the my soul so when you're thinking when you're pondering what are you pondering about what's what's bringing joy into you what's that thing that when when you're working and you feel tired and after that it comes in and after that you think think about it gives you Joy it gives you energy what's that thing that you have to think about and in paragraph 23 says the light of God is the eye if therefore thy eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore the light that is empty be Darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve to master for either he will hate one hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in mment you cannot serve God and after that go to um the world and after that party later on you cannot do that because because you will e you will end up back because that's what back that's the definition of backsliding because you're sering you're TR you're trying to serve two people you're trying I'm not saying you're serving you're trying to serve two people that's and even in Matthew 13 like you can read it when you get home Matthew 13 uh vers 15- 23 he talks he says blessed are are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for many prophets and righteous men they desire to see what you see they desire to hear what you hear there's many people many people in the in the denomination that are also locked that are trying to see what you see and see the prophecies that we see see the revelations we see and experience what we see there's many people like there's many people that are that are walking and all these seeds they they don't have a good eye as because single here means good eye they don't have a good eye they're they're not healthy if I were to take this water bottle and I P it here after I tell brother Charles come here and grab this water bottle he can walk over here and grab it but somebody that's in darkness if I tell him to come grab this water bottle they will trip they will fall they will stumble on themselves in fact they might not even come and reach this water bottle right here and in Mark 7 Jesus talks gives a parable about it's not what's it's not what you eat that goes to the belly that defiles man but it's what goes into the heart and if you have a good eyes that mean you're looking at the scripture you're looking at the word you're eating the word that will go to your heart and that will only produce good things in 1960 of hear ye him the prophet of God says and that's the way I preach the gospel if this just to give you like a story This was um the prophet when whenever he if this let me just read if this makes you sick it might stir up some of your gastronomics of the Bible and the things that the things started and get things started that's right that's right we need the oldfashioned gospel we need the power of God the Holy Ghost back in and all the Hollywood tevion starts out move out you know lady I want you to say something to I want to say something to you and I'm going to get to the man just a moment but lady I want you to say to say something I want to say something to you did you know that that's an unclean Spirit come on you do you know a little lady goes down the street all sexy dressed you do you know that the woman is going to have to answer to committing adultery well she might be as pure as a lily to her boyfriend or to her husband by the Bible says Jesus said that if whosoever lookth upon a woman and lost after her committeth adultery with her already in in the heart in his heart if you're dress if you're dressed like that and some sinner look looks at you in a way that the day of Judgment at the at the day of judgment when he answers for committing adultery it'll be with you and it'll be your fault because you're presenting yourself to him you might not come back tomorrow but you're going to hear it one time see that's that's right that's an evil spirit that comes upon you see um well I want to take from here because many people love to say well when you bring them and you tell them the way they're dressed and you're confronting them by the way they're dressed and stuff like they tend to say well it's my body I can do what I want or sometime they're like well I'm not hurting anybody it's just my body I'm just doing it for myself while the prophet of God was talking in influence 1963 paragraph 17 he gave an an knowledge of a little CH of a little child that his dad every Christmas like not every Christmas but one Christmas his dad was going from house to house drinking so on his way home there was snow and his dad was walking all wobbly and stuff like that and the little kid behind him was following in his footstep just going like that just following in his footstep and his dad turned around and look and his kid was a far off and his dad stopped to wait for the kid to come to come near him and when the kid come um arrived near him the dad asked him what are you doing and after that the little fell was like daddy I'm trying to step on your footstep I'm trying to copy you see the prophet of God used that to demonstrate that kids are there watching what you do Al you saying Al you're saying I'm dressing this way for myself I'm not as stumbly B from anybody else Al they're confronting you about it but there's little kids that they can't separate the good from bad unless if you told them that mean if they see someone that's dressed immorally they will copy that reproduce it so sometime sometime a kid may come home from Square after they acting a certain way after they their parent might ask where did you learn this that's because at school certain people are addressing certain way certain people are doing a certain habit that the kids peek up and suck it in and and the prophet of God and the prophet God also says in 1963 in influence paragraph 14 says and you know what your children is one of the main ises that watch that's watching you they watch what you do and whatever ever you do they copy after you because you're setting the example before them to what you do and the prophet God said the books of Corinthians like the book of Correction and in First Corinthians chapter um 8 verse 9 I'm not going to read it because to save time but it speaks about how you have free will and you you shouldn't just because you have free will you shouldn't use that to be you shouldn't be a stumbling block for your fellow brother and sister you shouldn't use that free will to be a stumbling block for your fellow brother and sister but that free will when God gave free will to humanity it was a trap to the seed of the devil because the the seed of the devil when they see free will they're like I guess I could do whatever I want I guess I could go to church and I can go I could go to church on Monday that I go to the club on on um I could go to the church on Sunday and go to the club on Monday or I could go to the amusement part as long as I'm not looking after any as long as I'm not looking at anybody that's dressing tomorrow I can go to the bowling bowling alley or to the prophet God said not to see yes see the concept of Free Will is just there to trip up the children of the of the devil but when a Believer a true seed of God when they have free will the moment they they receive the revelation of their position them they're obligated automatically to follow the word of God them they can't leave you away from the word of God they have to stay close to the word of God they have to keep on feeding on the word of God they can't Devi it away from that that's why Free Will is just a trap for the devil and in 1960 hear ye him paragraph the prophet of God says now that's the way the church has got about God we see the spirit of God in a Revival fall and Shake people and get up out of the wheelchair and the lame walk and the blind see and the spirit of God fall into the meeting discern the very thoughts of their heart and the great prophetic things will go forth that's the perfect that's perfect every time just exact just exactly and the church says well that's all right big water chewing G sitting sitting right there you know yes that's all right but we're going to see Lucy tomorrow night and we just ain't going to the pastor wants to condemn us let him condemn us we'll go over to this other denomination if he wants to condemn us we'll go over and join the if they run us out of the Church of God we go to the assembly they they run us out of the assembly we'll go to the oness run us out of the Oneness we'll go to the TW Ness to the threeness to all so far and so so far and so on see and and I just want to read um in the sermon thir 1965 to add on to that the prophet of God say in paragraph 173 says a vulture wants dead things that's right and it and that's dead and that's dead that's exactly right plainly shows it it just plainly shows here what is their head and their control tower what's giving them see what's what's in their soul they're so longest for things like that they're so longest for a high intellectual Church where the people dress real nice real fine and the pastor takes 15 minutes or 20 or 20 and if you go over there over that they draw him back on the Deacon board and he mustn't say nothing about Sin he must say anything about wearing shorts about saying nothing about people doing things that or the other he mustn't mention that at all if we if they do the board will have him throw out see what it is that's their thinking man's filter see which that reminds me back in middle school because my class had this bad habit of running teachers out of uh class and they were brag about it too they would go to another student and be like well we just ran this teacher out and we just got this teacher fired and they would boast about it and the teacher could be trying to help them and the teach and the student don't like the way the teacher is teaching that they would they would just take they will get the teacher fired and the same thing applies with church many people when the pastor is coming to correct and people don't like that they would try to push the pastor off they'll try to push the pastor off either they push the pastor off or they will leave the church and if they go to different Church now in um in the sermon of in in here in 1960 here your hand the prophet God says so we just SE until the last one is send out seen meaning fishing and then Jesus with will come how do we know who they are you just throw the gospel in that and throw it and draw that's why I come here with my brethren stand on the corner somewhere and throw the net with them reach out with my Ministry and pull it and say there there they are Brethren what is it now but this is the burnt over territory did you notice back there when I first come to you in Oregon people was coming from everywhere thousands times thousands crowding in oh it was fine I was just going along praying for the sick but when I come back and begin to lay the truth down laying the gospel down oh many turned aside see many many people come to church and when there's a healing companion there's something concerned about healing the body they will be quick to come they'll be the first one even on the prayer line but when it comes to healing of character or healing of your spirit people tend to run away from that people tend when they just read the scripture that they say oh um people cried out to God that after God sent the word and the word healed them people tend to just take that scripture as in healing their body but the word of God when it comes it comes to correct and correction is a top of healing and the Bible also said love is corrective that mean if if a pastor is coming here and bringing out the word and telling you to change your life change your ways that mean he loves you if your father is coming and telling you what you did here was wrong and you need to change it that mean he's showing love to you that mean you need to change the way you are you need to you need to change the way you are and and improve because what that also remind me is like because that correction that correction is like it's your sanctification when you're in the Holy in the Holy place that's San that's sanctification when you're in the Holy place and let me just read uh the prophet here real quick then I'll just wrap up in dors door 1965 but see it's like the church has to pass through the Hall of credit we go through you're going to be called Holy Rollers you're going to be called Everything But If You Could Only Hold Your Position in Christ then someday he'll take us to the heartall of Fame but first with God is stand we have to stand criticism there is a there is where the littleness of us stand there is where it shows he cannot stand chastisement chastisement is he cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined church and whatever he's done he's still he if he cannot stand chastisement he's an illegit and he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says every everything else is secondary he's got his mind on Christ and that settles it yes whatever Christ says do he'll do it wherever the lamp goes there wherever the lamp goes there are with Him ex wherever and then you see his appearing his presence and what he does he is always with his people his bride he is courting her someday there is going to be a wedding supper when God is there and right now God is preparing us he's just pling out see that what that correction does remind me of uh um the artist uh michelangela when he was just chipping off everything that was in Moses see ran out like the sermon that was preached on Sunday telling us that we are gods and that we need to be on our position we need to step into our position of God and when the word is coming it's removing our complexes it's removing anything that's ungodly into US preparing us for the wedding supper because when God when the wedding when God comes down to marry the groom the groom must be United with God he must be she must be one with God she must be like God she must be God and judge with God because when you get judge with God first you can't judge with God if you can't even judge yourself you can't judge with God when somebody's giving you correction you're not going to accept correction how are you going to judge with God how is God going to allow you to judge with him when you can't and judge your fellow peers um say my time is running so far we've spoke about how you need to take the word and the word by eating the word it reinforce your armor it will reinforce your body it will give you strength and it will also gives you protection because that protection will help you away from disease and sickness not I'm not talking about physical sickness but spiritual sickness spiritual spiritual disease spiritual demons and spiritual attacks and we also learn about how the word comes to correct because people when they hear the word when they hear when they hear the word healing they're just thinking about well I have a healing here I'm sick here my legs is broken and I need God to repair my leg but they for they tend to forget when the pastor is there giving um the word breaking the word and the word is telling you you need to change your life that the word is telling you you need to change your life that's the type of healing on itself because it's plucking out anything else that's bad and it's just purifying it's a type of sanctification exactly you're just washing Yourself by the word by the word of God if the P come [Applause] praise God praise God praise God God amen amen amen amen glory to God amen amen amen amen let's give the Lord a big clap offering amen amen they know how to take off the airplane and land it slowly finally he pushed the brake and the airplane is there welcome God richly bless you what a tremendous conven mention tonight amen you heard the first one you heard the second one and they summarize everything at the end for you amen it's a healing of the Soul Brother Bram said the sickest body that he know of is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ he need a spiritual healing and brother Bram say the only bomb that he knows that can heal the body is the word of God Amen when we eat the word it will bring healing to our body healing to our spirit healing to our soul and when the revelation of the stimulation struck there then he produce joy and the joy of the Lord is our strength and with that strength we can run the race all the way to the finishing line I will see God face amen amen so we got three brand new preachers that have been birthed by the gospel of God amen glory to God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
