[49:45] all right
[49:47] we
[49:47] spoke on wednesday on ruth
[49:50] and the calvinism
[49:52] now you understand what it is right so
[49:54] if you find yourself under preaching
[49:56] under a camp or whatever click you need
[49:59] to come up
[50:00] let's stay with the message amen the
[50:03] brothers remain brothers we shake hands
[50:05] we're good we keep the fellowship but
[50:08] we're not under any move in this church
[50:12] did you hear me
[50:13] in other words i don't have the
[50:14] headquarters
[50:16] that i have to report to you
[50:18] i preach what the lord put in my heart
[50:23] i'm not preaching to please somebody or
[50:25] a click somewhere
[50:27] i'm preaching to stay with what brother
[50:29] branham say and what the bible says
[50:32] period
[50:34] so if you're coming under a certain
[50:37] doctrine and you want me to preach a
[50:38] certain way it's not going to happen
[50:41] i only have one boss
[50:46] amen
[50:48] brother branham said he believed in the
[50:50] supreme authority of the local church
[50:54] amen
[50:55] the only person i must make sure i am
[50:58] really lined up with is brother branham
[51:01] that's all
[51:04] everybody here
[51:05] so we found out that the calvinist was
[51:08] an error of a lot of fact
[51:11] a lot of fighting a lot of contention
[51:14] and a lot of clicks
[51:19] everybody clear
[51:21] if you own my clique
[51:23] you're going to be invited
[51:25] if you're not on my clique you're going
[51:26] to stay there
[51:30] hallelujah
[51:32] brother branham says because it's an era
[51:35] with a lot of doctrine
[51:36] and if you remember it's an era when the
[51:40] book print began to go
[51:42] and when the books were going
[51:44] the children of god were coming they
[51:47] were younger
[51:48] they were looking for the bread to grow
[51:51] instead of giving them bread
[51:54] the pulpit forgot
[51:56] they got into the fasting into the
[51:58] clique
[51:59] and the children that were growing up
[52:01] begin to suck onto the fastest
[52:04] of the message
[52:06] instead of growing and later on no holy
[52:09] ghost
[52:12] fasting keep continuing camp continue 20
[52:15] years 40 years doctrine amen
[52:18] brother branham says satan
[52:20] does not care how religious you are
[52:26] anybody care
[52:27] oh how right
[52:31] you are in your water
[52:37] how many people believe that doctrine
[52:39] are right in the message
[52:44] satan doesn't care about it
[52:50] everybody here
[52:51] he said if you miss that life
[52:57] you can get in your clicks
[52:59] in your preferred preachers
[53:02] or in your camp
[53:04] as long as you miss that life satan
[53:07] doesn't care about you you don't even
[53:09] bother him
[53:10] you can continue fasting for 30 years
[53:14] he's fine
[53:15] as long as you miss that life you won't
[53:18] come up
[53:21] the doctrine is right
[53:23] but the doctrine won't pull you out of
[53:25] the grave
[53:29] you won't come up anywhere anyhow no
[53:32] matter how religious
[53:35] how
[53:40] how good how many churches you belong to
[53:44] or will belong to it doesn't matter one
[53:48] thing unless you have been water
[53:52] must be in the holiest
[53:55] that's what shake the devil
[53:57] anybody care
[53:58] brother branham continues he says now
[54:02] i says to brother sis
[54:05] brother ness to answer your question
[54:07] that says now
[54:08] i don't take
[54:10] i do not take either side with you
[54:13] brethren and i know as long as you fuss
[54:16] you are above water
[54:20] two preachers fasting brother branham
[54:23] comes he says i'm not going to take side
[54:25] on neither of you as long as you're
[54:27] fasting it automatically showing me both
[54:29] of you are wrong
[54:31] anybody care
[54:32] but bottom say because i would rather be
[54:35] wrong in my water
[54:41] and writing my water
[54:44] then to be right in my
[54:47] and wrong in my water roof under
[54:50] calvinist
[54:51] wrong heart
[54:53] good doctrines
[54:55] everybody here
[54:56] everybody
[54:58] brother branham say i said after all it
[55:00] is your heart condition
[55:03] the holiest
[55:04] and i made that a practice to know this
[55:07] that if a man
[55:09] no matter what he does and how much we
[55:12] difference
[55:13] and what he says about me if in my
[55:17] heart
[55:18] not from just a water
[55:21] roof
[55:22] serving we will get to that
[55:25] but from my heart i can't love that man
[55:28] as well as i love anyone else then i
[55:31] know there is something wrong with
[55:35] you've been under the doctrine
[55:38] have your heart been changed
[55:43] all it takes is somebody push you to the
[55:45] edge you find out you don't have the
[55:47] holy ghost amen brother bottom say and
[55:50] the pentecostal people you are doing the
[55:52] same thing
[55:54] trying to pick him up by organization
[55:56] you shall never do it
[55:58] separating yourself from another brother
[56:00] from other brothers you got to come back
[56:03] and we got to be
[56:05] i don't care if the man is wrong
[56:12] roof and the calvinist
[56:15] if he's wrong and sincere in his water
[56:19] that's what matters and you are right in
[56:22] your belief
[56:23] and you are wrong in the acting of your
[56:26] way you are acting
[56:32] in other words if that person
[56:34] is wrong in his doctrine
[56:37] and his heart is correct
[56:40] and you
[56:41] the knowing of
[56:43] the big shot
[56:45] you are writing your doctrine
[56:47] but your heart is wrong
[56:50] brother branham said this is what i
[56:51] would like
[56:53] brother branham says
[56:55] i'd rather be in his place
[56:58] than be in water
[57:01] [Music]
[57:05] that is right
[57:06] i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine
[57:10] and right in my water

[57:15] so if a man is wrong what of it do what
[57:22] what do the clique do

[1:07:44] clearly in the scripture you need a
[1:07:46] prophet to bring this out so brother
[1:07:48] branham is telling you this woman didn't
[1:07:51] just go out like that
[1:07:52] somebody told her
[1:07:54] go
[1:07:55] gather
[1:07:57] two sticks did you notice the scripture
[1:07:59] says how many sticks
[1:08:01] which means water
[1:08:11] what does this represent the president
[1:08:16] what
[1:08:19] the president represents water
[1:08:26] so when elijah came he found a woman
[1:08:28] where
[1:08:30] with how many tooths how many sticks
[1:08:33] elijah said bring me water
[1:08:35] she said i have water and i just said
[1:08:37] bring me water
[1:08:43] she's already there
[1:08:45] she can serve
[1:08:46] which stage is she
[1:08:55] any any question
[1:08:59] that i may go and dress it for me and my
[1:09:03] son that we may eat and do what
[1:09:06] and elijah said to her fear not
[1:09:09] go and do
[1:09:12] i want you to do service
[1:09:16] you need to serve me
[1:09:18] roof
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:21] do as you have said
[1:09:23] but make me there for a little cake
[1:09:26] first
[1:09:30] you must serve me first
[1:09:34] must serve elijah first
[1:09:37] there is an interaction between elijah
[1:09:42] and a weird woman
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:47] they have to talk
[1:09:50] right
[1:09:52] first
[1:09:53] and after
[1:09:55] make for you and for your water
[1:09:57] son for that save the lord god of israel
[1:10:02] the burial of meal shall not waste
[1:10:07] neither shall the crews of all fair
[1:10:10] water
[1:10:12] fail not until the day that the lord
[1:10:16] sent what
[1:10:17] rain upon the water
[1:10:19] the meal
[1:10:21] and the
[1:10:23] oil
[1:10:25] that this woman had
[1:10:27] could waste
[1:10:32] are we okay
[1:10:34] the meal that the woman have
[1:10:37] if she keep it
[1:10:38] that was the last one
[1:10:40] it can go
[1:10:42] and that's it and no more
[1:10:45] anybody care
[1:10:48] the meal and the oil the woman had
[1:10:51] if she makes it to bread
[1:10:54] that bread if it takes too long you have
[1:10:56] an expiration date
[1:11:00] everybody okay
[1:11:02] the manner when you eat it at the end of
[1:11:04] the day you have an expiration date
[1:11:10] are we okay
[1:11:11] then elijah bring another food
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:18] and the food of elijah
[1:11:20] it doesn't waste
[1:11:23] anybody here we know in the tabernacle
[1:11:27] if you keep mana here something will
[1:11:29] happen to your mana
[1:11:31] but if you take mana over there there is
[1:11:34] no aspiration
[1:11:40] everybody here the first food was there
[1:11:43] in the holy place
[1:11:45] but the second one was a different food
[1:11:48] it's a food that is created you take it
[1:11:52] it comes back up because god told moses
[1:11:55] take only a little
[1:11:58] vessel and put the manner but the priest
[1:12:01] could go eat and that man is still there
[1:12:06] every priest you come you eat you go
[1:12:08] back the man is still there
[1:12:10] everybody here and the meal that elijah
[1:12:13] brought by the spoken word
[1:12:16] is a meal that doesn't go away
[1:12:19] when you eat
[1:12:21] another meal when you eat another meal
[1:12:24] i'm here that's safe the lord let's move
[1:12:27] into here
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:32] everybody okay
[1:12:34] let's go to proverbs 10.
[1:12:40] it's called the tabernacle language

[1:13:02] amen why didn't eliezer gave rebecca
[1:13:06] quickly what she wanted
[1:13:08] he wanted rebecca to work first
[1:13:13] and elias waited for her to do the work
[1:13:18] until she watered the camel
[1:13:20] then
[1:13:21] he pulled the
[1:13:23] earring
[1:13:24] after work
[1:13:26] and pulled the bracelet and put it
[1:13:28] together
[1:13:31] after she works
[1:13:33] after she served
[1:13:35] a roof serving
[1:13:38] everybody
[1:13:39] proverb 10 verse 16. if you're there you
[1:13:41] can say amen
[1:13:43] the labor of the rapture stand to water
[1:13:47] so the labor of the righteous will bring
[1:13:50] her we will bring that righteous person
[1:13:53] toward
[1:13:54] life the labor
[1:13:57] the labor
[1:13:59] serving
[1:14:00] the labor
[1:14:02] of the righteous
[1:14:04] will bring that righteous to life
[1:14:08] the labor
[1:14:10] of the righteous will bring the
[1:14:11] righteous to life
[1:14:16] that labor is going to move you
[1:14:20] you gotta do the work
[1:14:21] then it moves you to a different stage
[1:14:26] rehab must do something about the
[1:14:29] spice
[1:14:30] then he move her to the token
[1:14:36] roof must serve before resting
[1:14:42] the labor of the righteous tend to life
[1:14:45] the fruit of the wicked to what
[1:14:48] we're not there let's go to philippians
[1:14:50] chapter 2 then we're going to pray
[1:14:57] i hope nobody's failed yet
[1:15:01] if you feel we need to take you to the
[1:15:03] doctor
[1:15:06] those were some roles that they bring at
[1:15:08] the restaurant while you're waiting for
[1:15:10] the food
[1:15:13] appetizer all of those stuff
[1:15:16] philippians chapter 2
[1:15:19] if you're there you can say amen
[1:15:21] verse 12. the bible
[1:15:23] wherefore my beloved
[1:15:25] as you have always obeyed
[1:15:29] not as in my presence only
[1:15:32] but now much more in my absence
[1:15:36] do water
[1:15:38] your own water how can you work your
[1:15:40] salvation
[1:15:43] how can you work your salvation
[1:15:46] so you want to do something to be safe
[1:15:53] work out
[1:15:54] your own salvation not the salvation of
[1:15:58] your neighbor
[1:16:01] your own salvation with what
[1:16:04] and trembling
[1:16:06] so brother stephen i need now to do work
[1:16:09] praise god
[1:16:10] i'm gonna
[1:16:11] make myself this way make myself this
[1:16:13] way you you did it for a long time
[1:16:16] didn't take you no way
[1:16:20] only major is a big hypocrite
[1:16:26] so how do you do the work
[1:16:30] i can go deep now because something is
[1:16:32] there's a lot here we're going to get to
[1:16:35] roof under sanctification
[1:16:37] then roof under
[1:16:39] wesley then we keep moving amen
[1:16:41] how do you work verse 13 for it is me
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:56] paul said work out your salvation and
[1:16:58] paul turn around he said it is god
[1:17:02] the same one that pick up the glass
[1:17:06] is the same one that's going to clean up
[1:17:08] the glass
[1:17:09] it's the same one that's going to fill
[1:17:12] the one that called you the one that
[1:17:14] justify you
[1:17:16] that gate is going to turn into a door
[1:17:18] and that door is going to turn into a
[1:17:20] veil
[1:17:21] everybody here
[1:17:23] so it is god which works in you both to
[1:17:27] what
[1:17:32] that that desire that is coming up
[1:17:36] it is him
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] not you
[1:17:41] you will know that this is nominee
[1:17:44] this is somebody else because if it's me
[1:17:46] i would not do something like this
[1:17:48] it is him that bring the will and the
[1:17:51] water
[1:17:52] and they do
[1:17:55] so it's not a pharisee work because the
[1:17:58] pharisee when they do they remember
[1:18:01] everybody here but the rapture is when
[1:18:03] jesus tells them that when i was sick
[1:18:06] you came and visit me they don't
[1:18:08] remember
[1:18:09] they say when when were you seeking then
[1:18:12] we came and see you they didn't remember
[1:18:16] everybody here but the one the other one
[1:18:18] said lord have we not cast devil in your
[1:18:21] name have we not prophesy they know the
[1:18:24] other one doesn't remember it's a nature
[1:18:28] they were just living they thought it
[1:18:30] was them that were living
[1:18:32] they found out that it was not them they
[1:18:34] were living
[1:18:35] because the faith that they were living
[1:18:37] with was not them anymore that's why
[1:18:40] paul said it is not i who is living now
[1:18:44] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:18:48] the life that i leave now it's not me
[1:18:50] paul anymore because paul was a murderer
[1:18:53] over there
[1:18:54] ever here
[1:18:55] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:18:57] to do
[1:18:59] of his good water
[1:19:03] so that sanctification
[1:19:05] you do it but it's not you doing it
[1:19:07] that's right
[1:19:09] but you do it
[1:19:11] how can i do something that is not me
[1:19:13] doing it
[1:19:17] how can you do it
[1:19:19] let's go to roof chapter 2 and then we
[1:19:21] pray
[1:19:26] alleluia
[1:19:27] if you dare you can say a man
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:35] let's pray now heavenly father lord we
[1:19:38] thank you again father for your grace
[1:19:40] for your love your mercy father and for
[1:19:42] everything you have been doing for us
[1:19:45] lord you have given us another
[1:19:47] opportunity to be here to gather
[1:19:49] together around the revealed word of the
[1:19:51] hour
[1:19:52] father i have done what any man
[1:19:55] that you give an ability to do can do
[1:19:58] we can read the word
[1:20:00] and father people can hear it and listen
[1:20:02] to it but father when it comes to
[1:20:04] ministering to your people and to unfold
[1:20:07] your word it only take the action of the
[1:20:10] holy spirit lord
[1:20:12] i am completely 100 dependent upon you
[1:20:16] father may you move me completely out of
[1:20:18] the way may you come and bless our soul
[1:20:21] and minister to this church lord and to
[1:20:23] those that are not here and streaming
[1:20:25] lord father may your presence continue
[1:20:27] to minister and unfold your word to your
[1:20:29] children to bring forth healing in the
[1:20:32] name of jesus christ
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] all right
[1:20:37] one more scripture in exodus chapter 25
[1:20:40] verse 31
[1:20:42] just a reminder the bible says that
[1:20:44] shall make a candlestick of pure gold
[1:20:47] we talk about it on sunday we mentioned
[1:20:49] that on sunday
[1:20:50] of bidding work
[1:20:52] shall the candlestick be made
[1:20:54] there is some beating there
[1:20:57] his shaft his branches his ball his
[1:21:01] knobs and his flower shall be all the
[1:21:04] same when you look at the candlestick it
[1:21:06] looks beautiful made out of gold it's
[1:21:08] shining it looks great
[1:21:10] but there was a lot of building to bring
[1:21:13] that beauty out
[1:21:15] here
[1:21:16] now we are today this morning in the
[1:21:19] four phases of roof
[1:21:21] roof
[1:21:23] at the candlestick
[1:21:26] hey here
[1:21:29] we are in the tabernacle you see it on
[1:21:31] the board there
[1:21:33] you enter the tabernacle passing the
[1:21:35] tribe of judah
[1:21:37] then you pass into the priest after the
[1:21:41] priest you enter the gate
[1:21:43] when you enter the gate you find the two
[1:21:45] sticks everybody okay
[1:21:46] then you go to the water ever here and
[1:21:49] from there we put roof under
[1:21:51] justification
[1:21:53] and brother branham came again and he
[1:21:55] said rule founded justification means
[1:21:57] roof under luther on the sanctification
[1:22:00] on the westlake and then on all the way
[1:22:03] to the message of the hour amen then we
[1:22:06] found that luther has a baby
[1:22:09] a big one a tribal baby
[1:22:11] that we call calvin
[1:22:13] and with the stage of kevin
[1:22:16] the church miss
[1:22:18] that the one who is under justification
[1:22:21] is really a
[1:22:22] baby or an infant
[1:22:25] and he needs a different food than the
[1:22:28] doctrine
[1:22:29] in hebrews 5
[1:22:31] 12
[1:22:32] the bible says for when
[1:22:35] for the time you ought to be teachers
[1:22:39] you have need that one teach you again
[1:22:43] which be the first
[1:22:45] principle of the oracle of god
[1:22:49] so there is something here paul is
[1:22:52] calling the first principles
[1:22:56] the first principles of the word
[1:22:59] or the oracle of god what is the first
[1:23:03] principle of the word of god amen
[1:23:06] paul say and i become such as have made
[1:23:10] of milk
[1:23:11] and not of water
[1:23:14] so there is two food
[1:23:17] the first one is milk
[1:23:19] and you know who's responsible for the
[1:23:21] milk
[1:23:22] we're talking about we're dealing with
[1:23:24] babies
[1:23:25] and the second one is strong meat
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:30] and the calvinist they went straight to
[1:23:32] the strong meat
[1:23:36] and they forgot the church needed milk
[1:23:39] and this is the error that happened in a
[1:23:41] message
[1:23:43] everybody here if you look at brother
[1:23:45] branham brother branham never started
[1:23:47] his ministry and preached the seals
[1:23:53] brother bonham started with the first
[1:23:55] pool with the healing and the miracle
[1:23:57] and going to the teaching all the way
[1:24:00] the seals were almost at the end of
[1:24:03] brother branham life
[1:24:05] there was a reason why the seals have to
[1:24:07] be down there
[1:24:08] because the milk have to go first then
[1:24:11] you bring the strong meat later on when
[1:24:14] a child is growing up amen and paul
[1:24:16] continued he said for everyone
[1:24:19] that uses milk is a skillful in the word
[1:24:23] of righteousness
[1:24:24] anybody care for he is a water he's a
[1:24:28] baby
[1:24:29] are you giving a baby a stick
[1:24:31] this is what they did in the message
[1:24:34] everybody here
[1:24:35] but strong meat belong to them that are
[1:24:38] of full age
[1:24:39] even those who by reason of use have
[1:24:42] their senses already exercised to
[1:24:46] discern both water
[1:24:48] and water they know what is the
[1:24:50] difference between good and evil those
[1:24:53] can get the strong meat everybody
[1:24:56] we can start with the unchanging pattern
[1:24:58] of god
[1:25:00] in order to rebuild the altar of malachi
[1:25:03] 4
[1:25:04] we can emphasize on some of the doctrine
[1:25:08] in order to rebuild again the confidence
[1:25:11] in the cloud and in everything
[1:25:14] everybody here and once we reach the
[1:25:16] referee the lord push a break
[1:25:19] he says they are still babies down there
[1:25:22] go back into the black dog territory
[1:25:26] and begin to clean up the church first
[1:25:30] i hope you're listening
[1:25:32] in hebrew chapter six verse one the
[1:25:35] bible says therefore leaving the
[1:25:38] principles remember the principles
[1:25:40] of the doctrine of who
[1:25:43] let us go on to water
[1:25:46] the principle here paul says that they
[1:25:49] are milk
[1:25:52] anybody here and here you're moving
[1:25:55] toward perfection
[1:25:57] everybody
[1:25:58] but what are the principle
[1:26:01] of the word of god
[1:26:02] paul says living the principles of the
[1:26:06] doctrine of christ
[1:26:07] let us go on to perfection
[1:26:10] not laying again
[1:26:13] the principles
[1:26:15] which are the principle not laying again
[1:26:18] because we already laid that
[1:26:20] we don't want to go back again and keep
[1:26:21] digging there
[1:26:23] not laying again the water
[1:26:25] the foundation of water
[1:26:28] repentance happened where
[1:26:33] the principle of the doctrine of christ
[1:26:36] everybody okay
[1:26:37] paul saying we need to move toward
[1:26:40] perfection
[1:26:42] you cannot remain baby anymore for
[1:26:44] eternal
[1:26:46] you cannot be baby 20 30 years in a
[1:26:48] message we cannot continue to go back
[1:26:52] here back there back there you baptize
[1:26:55] one time here and let's move forward
[1:27:01] anybody okay
[1:27:02] not lying again the foundation of
[1:27:05] repentance the present altar from dead
[1:27:08] work the brazen altar amen and the fifth
[1:27:11] word god the brazen altar
[1:27:13] and of the doctrine of water
[1:27:16] do you see that
[1:27:17] deliver
[1:27:19] so this right here
[1:27:22] the other court
[1:27:25] belongs to babies
[1:27:26] because you are just new in the gospel
[1:27:30] you need milk
[1:27:32] not the feast of the trumpet
[1:27:35] anybody here
[1:27:36] and laying on the fend and the
[1:27:38] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:27:41] judgment it is necessary this is what
[1:27:43] you get there ever here and peter said
[1:27:46] as newborn babies
[1:27:48] desiring the water
[1:27:51] the sincere milk of the word that she
[1:27:53] may do water
[1:27:56] that's what you need in the other
[1:27:58] quarter here when you plateau then we
[1:28:01] gotta move to you and begin to give you
[1:28:03] some bread
[1:28:05] anybody here so far so they missed this
[1:28:08] and they caused a lot of problem because
[1:28:10] they went through the doctrine
[1:28:12] and they forgot that the church was
[1:28:14] coming to learn how they can live with
[1:28:16] their wife how they can live with their
[1:28:19] children how they can be good people
[1:28:21] when they get there the clergy is
[1:28:23] fighting left and right
[1:28:25] and the people miss the life and they
[1:28:27] grew up with doctrine and they still
[1:28:29] fasting till today
[1:28:31] but no life
[1:28:32] living like devils at home but here then
[1:28:36] under westlake we found our minion
[1:28:39] so brother branham says this as we begin
[1:28:41] to go now
[1:28:43] that roof
[1:28:44] deciding
[1:28:45] roof serving roof resting deciding was
[1:28:49] justification serving was making herself
[1:28:53] ready
[1:28:55] in serving
[1:28:57] i'm catching up from sunday
[1:28:59] is roof
[1:29:00] making herself
[1:29:02] ready another word roof preparing
[1:29:05] herself
[1:29:07] everybody
[1:29:08] here brother branham says this again
[1:29:12] we move on to roof going into the
[1:29:14] holiest
[1:29:15] we're dealing with it brother branham
[1:29:17] says this he said then after she got
[1:29:20] there
[1:29:21] the next thing she has to do was to
[1:29:23] serve
[1:29:25] in the field of boas
[1:29:28] for you to serve
[1:29:30] you must be in the field of boaz
[1:29:33] why boas
[1:29:35] because boaz
[1:29:37] was the king's man
[1:29:39] with him
[1:29:41] anybody care
[1:29:42] you cannot go anywhere
[1:29:44] number two brother branham say out there
[1:29:46] she was barefooted
[1:29:50] so it was not easy
[1:29:53] bear footed and brother branham said she
[1:29:55] had to glean
[1:29:57] behind
[1:29:59] the reapers
[1:30:02] everybody here
[1:30:04] praise be the name of the lord
[1:30:06] now
[1:30:07] to help somebody because last sunday i
[1:30:10] have to go twice with it
[1:30:13] buckle up pretty good
[1:30:15] when we're talking about somebody
[1:30:17] showing you remember that sunday
[1:30:20] okay or somebody who's planting
[1:30:25] my brother who is on the computer make
[1:30:27] sure you stay there so when they go home
[1:30:30] they can watch it
[1:30:31] they can review it when somebody is
[1:30:33] sowing there is a mystery that goes into
[1:30:37] the ground
[1:30:43] you're the one going slowly with me
[1:30:46] anybody care if you look under there if
[1:30:49] you pull the ground
[1:30:51] everybody here
[1:30:53] when you have a seed
[1:30:55] and you cast your seed on the ground
[1:30:58] everybody okay
[1:30:59] the seed doesn't stay like that
[1:31:04] after a while the seed will begin to
[1:31:06] sink
[1:31:07] everybody okay
[1:31:08] then you begin to sink
[1:31:11] then the seed will sink completely in
[1:31:15] everybody okay
[1:31:16] when he sink completely in
[1:31:19] this seed here have life in it
[1:31:23] but if you take the seed you put it
[1:31:26] right here that life will remain in the
[1:31:28] sea then never move on
[1:31:31] everybody here
[1:31:33] in this stage there is still life there
[1:31:36] but you don't see the life here but when
[1:31:38] the seed is completely sink into the
[1:31:40] ground
[1:31:42] the seed will rot
[1:31:44] in other words the seed dies
[1:31:47] everybody okay so far i'm trying to help
[1:31:50] you from last sunday and when the seed
[1:31:52] dies
[1:31:53] after a while you think everything is
[1:31:56] done no the death of the seed
[1:31:59] is the
[1:32:01] releasing of the life
[1:32:05] everybody here as long as the seed
[1:32:08] remains seed the life is blocked
[1:32:12] everybody here for the life to live the
[1:32:15] seed the seed must die
[1:32:18] and when he dies it's going to release
[1:32:20] the life that was in it and once the
[1:32:22] life is released
[1:32:24] then what come out something will shoot
[1:32:26] up
[1:32:30] everybody okay
[1:32:31] then after the process of time something
[1:32:33] else shoot up
[1:32:36] the blade
[1:32:37] the tassel
[1:32:39] everybody care then after the process of
[1:32:41] time we begin to find a mature
[1:32:45] wheat ever here but in between this
[1:32:48] stage here
[1:32:50] and the other stage here there is a
[1:32:52] stage that something is formed that is
[1:32:55] called the shock
[1:32:59] the shark
[1:33:01] looks like the seed
[1:33:05] but it is not the seed the shark is an
[1:33:10] empty seed
[1:33:13] everybody here
[1:33:15] if you look you will think you got the
[1:33:17] seed
[1:33:18] when you open there is nothing there it
[1:33:20] is just a protective layer
[1:33:23] ever here
[1:33:24] to protect
[1:33:28] like an anki bedo
[1:33:30] like a womb
[1:33:32] that the seed is using
[1:33:35] until the seed is fully formed
[1:33:38] then the seed the baby comes out
[1:33:41] amen
[1:33:42] everybody okay so far
[1:33:44] everybody okay so far so when somebody
[1:33:46] who's not trained correctly look at the
[1:33:49] shack they will think that they got the
[1:33:51] seed
[1:33:53] and they take and they begin to tell the
[1:33:54] people i got the seed and one day you're
[1:33:56] going to open up you found out you
[1:33:58] didn't have the seed
[1:34:00] you only have the shack
[1:34:02] anybody here
[1:34:03] all right blessed be the name of the
[1:34:05] lord so when
[1:34:06] i don't know where this is coming from
[1:34:08] jesus can you close that
[1:34:10] the devil
[1:34:11] and do you see where he's dead
[1:34:14] that's exactly where i am
[1:34:16] everybody here so with this seed
[1:34:19] when it reach maturity they bring the
[1:34:22] sickle or the instrument and then they
[1:34:25] cut the seed and they make a sheath
[1:34:30] everybody okay this process this journey
[1:34:34] of the wheat that you see from here all
[1:34:38] the way here is exactly a reflection of
[1:34:41] the church ages
[1:34:44] anybody here if you notice over here
[1:34:47] everything is yellow
[1:34:49] but the ground is dark
[1:34:53] everybody okay so far
[1:34:54] if you notice right here you will find
[1:34:56] everything is white but you see darkness
[1:34:59] begin to come out there
[1:35:01] in other words the seed is sinking
[1:35:04] everybody okay on the next stage you
[1:35:06] will see the seed sinking more on the
[1:35:08] third it's sinking until the fourth it
[1:35:11] dies completely it is sinking anybody
[1:35:14] okay
[1:35:15] then it begin to come up
[1:35:17] then come up then come up all the way to
[1:35:19] the harvest anybody clear so far
[1:35:23] jesus says this that verily verily i say
[1:35:26] unto you except a corn of wheat
[1:35:29] fall into the ground and do whatever
[1:35:33] he will lay by the lawn
[1:35:37] anybody okay
[1:35:38] but if he dies he bring more water
[1:35:42] so the depth of the corner with is
[1:35:45] important
[1:35:49] in in john chapter 11 verse 15
[1:35:53] caiaphas says this
[1:35:55] he says no
[1:35:56] consider that it is expedient
[1:36:00] it is necessary it is very important
[1:36:04] for us that one man should die
[1:36:08] for the people and that the whole nation
[1:36:11] perished not
[1:36:13] and this
[1:36:14] spoke he not of himself
[1:36:16] but being high priest that year he did
[1:36:19] what
[1:36:20] so the one who says this was god amen
[1:36:25] amen he was not careful
[1:36:27] so according to god
[1:36:29] the death of jesus christ is important
[1:36:34] it is important for the whole nation
[1:36:38] that jesus should die for that nation
[1:36:41] and not for that nation only which is
[1:36:44] israel
[1:36:45] anybody
[1:36:46] but that also he should gather together
[1:36:49] in what
[1:36:51] children of god that were water
[1:36:53] in other words the
[1:36:55] the
[1:36:57] the death of jesus christ
[1:36:59] is a blessing to us
[1:37:02] when jesus died he released the god that
[1:37:06] was in jesus christ
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:09] and that god that was locking jesus
[1:37:11] christ now can go everywhere
[1:37:14] not only to the jewish only but even to
[1:37:17] the gentile and begin to search the
[1:37:20] children of god according to the lineage
[1:37:23] of melchizedek
[1:37:28] everybody okay so far
[1:37:30] john 16 verse 7
[1:37:32] nevertheless i tell you the truth it is
[1:37:35] expedient for you that i do what
[1:37:38] it was expedient for him to die
[1:37:43] and it is also expedient for him to go
[1:37:45] away
[1:37:47] this going away was his rapture
[1:37:51] it is also expedient for you that i go
[1:37:54] away for if i go not away the who
[1:37:58] the life because when he came from the
[1:38:00] grave he picked up the life again
[1:38:03] nobody can receive it
[1:38:05] so what do we do you must go when he
[1:38:08] goes he will ease that life and that
[1:38:11] life come back in the church everybody
[1:38:13] here it is expedient for you that i go
[1:38:15] away for if i go not away the comforter
[1:38:18] the holy ghost will not come upon you
[1:38:21] but if i depart my rapture i will do
[1:38:24] what
[1:38:25] i will send him unto you so the death
[1:38:29] and the rapture is important
[1:38:33] everybody okay
[1:38:34] let's continue
[1:38:36] brother branham say
[1:38:38] he died in the dark ages
[1:38:40] down beneath the dark dead
[1:38:42] they thought he was gone
[1:38:44] saint john 12 4 24 jesus said except a
[1:38:48] corn of wheat fall in the ground he
[1:38:50] abides alone and the first church was
[1:38:53] the reproduction
[1:38:55] that brad
[1:38:57] that seed that word made manifest that
[1:39:00] fell into the ground in water
[1:39:02] in rome
[1:39:04] brother obama says a corn of which fall
[1:39:06] into the ground now jesus was that corn
[1:39:10] of wheat
[1:39:12] that fell into the ground which after
[1:39:15] was made perfect he had life in it
[1:39:18] in the beginning was the word
[1:39:20] and the word was with god and the word
[1:39:23] was god and in that world was life and
[1:39:27] that life was the light of man
[1:39:29] you remember now okay but this perfect
[1:39:33] one that reflected the word in every age
[1:39:36] every word he lived by they put him in
[1:39:39] the grave but three days he broke her
[1:39:42] open and come out again
[1:39:45] hey mark here so when jesus christ died
[1:39:48] his death is important
[1:39:50] his burial is important his resurrection
[1:39:53] is important but once the corner which
[1:39:56] is resurrected
[1:39:58] after the death they got to take it
[1:40:00] somewhere
[1:40:03] everybody okay
[1:40:05] jesus says this that
[1:40:07] a believer john doe baptist says whose
[1:40:10] fan is in his hand
[1:40:12] he will thoroughly purge his floor
[1:40:15] and gather his wheat into the water
[1:40:18] garner but he will burn up the shelf
[1:40:21] with unquenchable fire the gunner is
[1:40:25] born
[1:40:28] the gardener
[1:40:30] is another word for born
[1:40:32] this is where you keep the seed
[1:40:36] everybody here so when the seed that you
[1:40:39] have you plant it it dies you produce
[1:40:42] you take the end product into the burner
[1:40:46] everybody okay
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:48] matthew 13
[1:40:50] let both together let both grow together
[1:40:54] until the harvest
[1:40:56] in the time of the harvest i will send
[1:40:58] the reapers
[1:41:00] gather you together fetch the tears
[1:41:03] burn them in the binder to be burned
[1:41:07] to burn them but gather the wheat into
[1:41:10] water
[1:41:11] here it's called garner here it's called
[1:41:13] water
[1:41:14] so when the wheat is put into the barn
[1:41:18] he has
[1:41:19] two missions
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:23] anybody okay
[1:41:24] either this sweet
[1:41:27] will be used for bread
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:33] everybody here
[1:41:35] and part of this seed
[1:41:37] will be used
[1:41:39] for sowing
[1:41:41] in other words to aerate again the
[1:41:44] ground so we can produce more
[1:41:47] so some will be turning to bread
[1:41:50] and some will keep it to plant them over
[1:41:53] again so when jesus died and rose again
[1:41:56] they retrieve him from the father
[1:41:59] and they put him back into the barn
[1:42:02] ever here
[1:42:04] and they pulled the life
[1:42:06] that was in jesus christ
[1:42:08] and they planted back again
[1:42:11] everybody okay so far
[1:42:13] when they planted he came down with paul
[1:42:16] right here boom
[1:42:17] and then that life will begin to go
[1:42:20] until the end
[1:42:21] everybody okay
[1:42:22] so to make everything easy for you
[1:42:26] we have a sower that is planting
[1:42:29] after he planted we got a field
[1:42:32] after the field then we got the harvest
[1:42:35] everybody clear now
[1:42:38] that which is in this
[1:42:40] bed which has been spread here
[1:42:44] ever here
[1:42:45] came from the barn
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:51] everybody okay
[1:42:53] it is a seed
[1:42:57] anybody here
[1:42:59] and what you see in the office here it
[1:43:02] is exactly what came out of the barn
[1:43:08] anybody care
[1:43:09] so their harvest bring you back to the
[1:43:12] original
[1:43:17] everybody okay
[1:43:18] the difference is in the planting you
[1:43:21] have one seed
[1:43:26] everybody okay so far but in the harvest
[1:43:29] you have the same seed in multiplication
[1:43:34] you put one but you have many
[1:43:37] you kill one jesus on the day of
[1:43:39] pentecost 120 jesus
[1:43:44] everybody okay
[1:43:46] jesus became multiplied
[1:43:48] because when the pillar of fire met a
[1:43:51] paul on the road to emmaus the penal
[1:43:54] fire told paul what paul paul so why are
[1:43:59] you what
[1:44:01] was paul persecuting jesus christ
[1:44:04] he was persecuting who the church became
[1:44:07] jesus christ but it was jesus christ in
[1:44:09] many members
[1:44:11] not one person but now it's many seed
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:15] everybody okay so far
[1:44:17] amen so what is this seed here what is
[1:44:20] it
[1:44:24] luke chapter 8 verse 11 the bible say
[1:44:27] now the parable is this the seed is the
[1:44:31] water
[1:44:32] any question
[1:44:35] first peter 1 23 being born again
[1:44:39] not of corruptable water
[1:44:42] seed but of incorruptible by the water
[1:44:47] which liveth and the blood of water so
[1:44:49] this seed here is the word of god
[1:44:53] and whatever you start with it over
[1:44:56] there in the planting is going to be
[1:44:59] exactly what you get in the harvest you
[1:45:02] going back again to the original
[1:45:05] planting to the original faith
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:11] everybody okay
[1:45:12] the faith that you started here
[1:45:15] we'll go down through the edges and come
[1:45:17] back again the same thing
[1:45:20] ever here
[1:45:22] now we are in the tabernacle
[1:45:24] we're dealing with roof
[1:45:26] in the holy place
[1:45:28] as we put our microscope we pull again
[1:45:30] again
[1:45:31] again the holy place like we did last
[1:45:33] sunday
[1:45:34] we know that the holy place depending on
[1:45:37] how you look at if you got according to
[1:45:40] hebrew the holy place have only the
[1:45:42] candlestick and the table of the
[1:45:44] showbread but we know that according to
[1:45:47] moses moses put the altar of aces which
[1:45:49] we already talked about it anybody here
[1:45:52] now we're dealing with roof under the
[1:45:54] candlestick
[1:45:56] everybody okay roof chapter two
[1:46:00] remember last sunday that what move
[1:46:04] naomi
[1:46:05] everybody okay
[1:46:06] to go back to the promised land was not
[1:46:09] the death of her husband
[1:46:11] he was not even not he was not the death
[1:46:14] of her children it was the
[1:46:17] he was the news that bread
[1:46:20] is back again in israel
[1:46:23] the news didn't say that wheat is in
[1:46:26] israel
[1:46:29] then you say that it's bread
[1:46:31] in other words by bread
[1:46:34] we mean that the wheat is already mature
[1:46:40] okay
[1:46:41] but the death of marlon was necessary
[1:46:44] because your first husband must die
[1:46:45] everybody here
[1:46:47] you already know this by last sunday
[1:46:48] amen and we found out that when naomi
[1:46:51] returned with roof and her mother-in-law
[1:46:54] when she begin
[1:46:56] her daughter-in-law she began to return
[1:46:58] on the cuff from the country of moab the
[1:47:00] bible said they came to bethlehem the
[1:47:02] center of bread in the beginning of
[1:47:05] barley harvest
[1:47:13] where are you going with this
[1:47:14] candlestick
[1:47:16] we already talked about this on sunday
[1:47:18] i'm just keeping
[1:47:19] this is where we were now we understood
[1:47:23] that the office or the farming have
[1:47:25] certain principles
[1:47:27] this is where we were
[1:47:30] in the farm
[1:47:31] everybody okay
[1:47:33] we have
[1:47:39] let me get it here
[1:47:41] so we go pretty quick probably pretty
[1:47:43] quick here
[1:47:45] we have
[1:47:46] according to john chapter 4
[1:47:50] we got two seasons
[1:47:53] amen
[1:47:54] we got the planting season
[1:47:57] and we got the harvest
[1:47:59] everybody here because jesus says that
[1:48:03] he that reapeth
[1:48:05] receiveth his wage and gathered fruit
[1:48:08] unto life eternal but both he does
[1:48:11] soweth
[1:48:13] the planter and he that reaped may we
[1:48:16] judge together and hearing is that
[1:48:19] saying true one so f and one other
[1:48:22] reaper i sent you to reap that where on
[1:48:26] you bestow no level at the main library
[1:48:28] and you enter into their
[1:48:31] ever here
[1:48:32] so the one who's sewing
[1:48:35] and the one who is reaping are two
[1:48:38] different people
[1:48:41] but both of them are put together in one
[1:48:44] set
[1:48:47] everybody okay
[1:48:49] and according to matthew chapter nine
[1:48:52] the bible says that the harvest is truly
[1:48:54] plenties but the laborers are few
[1:48:58] pray he therefore the lord of the
[1:49:00] harvest
[1:49:01] so the harvest according to matthew
[1:49:04] have the lord
[1:49:07] of the harvest
[1:49:10] not the lord of the planting
[1:49:14] everybody here
[1:49:15] and he will send forth laborers into his
[1:49:19] water
[1:49:20] so this lord is not alone he have
[1:49:24] workers
[1:49:26] all
[1:49:26] liberals everybody care
[1:49:29] and we know that these workers and
[1:49:31] laborers are in category
[1:49:35] you remember that
[1:49:38] don't worry
[1:49:39] we'll get there amen amen
[1:49:43] now paul in 1st corinthians chapter 3
[1:49:47] says i have done water
[1:49:55] everybody okay
[1:49:57] we got moses
[1:50:00] and who
[1:50:01] elijah
[1:50:03] we got paul
[1:50:04] and who
[1:50:06] brother branham
[1:50:08] and when you go back to the jews what do
[1:50:09] you have again
[1:50:10] moses and who
[1:50:13] in one transfiguration what do you have
[1:50:15] and who
[1:50:19] everybody okay
[1:50:21] so there is a planting season
[1:50:24] and there is a harvest season
[1:50:27] ever here
[1:50:28] the planting season will have the seed
[1:50:34] the harvest also have the seed
[1:50:39] and jesus said one wool plant
[1:50:42] and the other one will be doing water
[1:50:45] harvesting but here and we found paul
[1:50:48] says that i have planted
[1:50:56] because when naomi was still in the land
[1:50:59] of moab when malone died
[1:51:03] everybody care
[1:51:05] they didn't move
[1:51:06] everybody
[1:51:07] they moved in the time of the harvest
[1:51:10] ever here so the death of marlon here
[1:51:14] was the time
[1:51:16] that they were planting
[1:51:18] something in israel
[1:51:21] and the planting correspond with the
[1:51:24] death of the husband
[1:51:27] anybody here and paul is the one that
[1:51:30] says that your first husband must die
[1:51:34] and paul is the one that says that i'm
[1:51:37] me paul i have planted
[1:51:39] so paul was a planter
[1:51:42] but who is in the harvest
[1:51:47] anybody okay
[1:51:48] paul says that i have planted
[1:51:52] apollos dead water
[1:51:55] what does it mean
[1:51:59] paul
[1:52:00] is the one that planted
[1:52:03] but apollos did what
[1:52:06] did apollos plant
[1:52:10] the one who is watering
[1:52:14] doesn't pamper with the seed
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:22] because when you are born under a
[1:52:24] messenger when you are a baby remember
[1:52:28] on wednesday you cannot deviate from the
[1:52:30] right or the left

[1:54:18] not everybody have the seed
[1:54:20] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:54:25] the preacher are unique

[1:55:28] he's quoting paul
[1:55:30] come on
[1:55:32] he says paul have a certain wisdom
[1:55:35] that was given to him and he wrote to
[1:55:38] you certain things

[1:56:08] writes
[1:56:09] there are certain sermons of power
[1:56:12] that are hard to understand

[1:56:36] which day that i want
[1:56:39] and on what
[1:56:41] and learn and unstable do what
[1:56:44] twist as they do also the other word
[1:56:54] there is the sermon of paul
[1:56:59] everybody okay
[1:57:01] the sermon of paul or the epistles which
[1:57:05] are the letters
[1:57:06] of paul

[1:57:33] peter is putting the sun man of poor
[1:57:38] together with the scripture
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:44] the sermon of a prophet
[1:57:47] are connected with the scriptures
[1:57:51] and peter said there are certain people
[1:57:54] that are unknown
[1:57:56] and what they do they twist the
[1:57:58] scripture
[1:57:59] and by this habit of twisting the
[1:58:02] scripture
[1:58:03] they also have a tendency to twist the
[1:58:06] sermon of paul
[1:58:09] and when they twist the sermon upon what
[1:58:12] happened
[1:58:15] everybody here
[1:58:17] as they do also are the scripture

[1:58:23] misinterpreting the prophet
[1:58:26] you bringing destruction to the people
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:33] so paul planted
[1:58:35] there are certain things that power
[1:58:38] when he planted they are hard to be
[1:58:41] understood apollos come now not to plant
[1:58:45] but to water

[2:00:02] was instructed in the way of the lord
[2:00:06] and being fervent
[2:00:08] zealous
[2:00:09] in the spirit
[2:00:10] he spoke
[2:00:13] and thought teaching
[2:00:15] diligently the things of the lord
[2:00:18] apollos doesn't play
[2:00:20] he's right to the letter
[2:00:22] apollos anybody here
[2:00:25] knowing only
[2:00:27] the baptism of power
[2:00:31] of john

[2:00:42] them
[2:00:43] and expanded in other words explained to
[2:00:46] him the way of god more water
[2:00:49] they brought him they said we see that
[2:00:51] the lord is gifting
[2:00:53] you have a gift
[2:00:54] but you're missing something
[2:00:56] you started with john
[2:00:58] but the atonement already moved
[2:01:01] come let's have fellowship
[2:01:03] so they took him to their home and
[2:01:05] sister priscilla began to cook when they
[2:01:08] sat down together they begin to talk to
[2:01:11] uh to apollos they say look you see that
[2:01:14] lamb that lamb was already killed he's
[2:01:16] already came he resurrected and
[2:01:17] descended this and apollos caught the
[2:01:20] vision everybody okay now
[2:01:23] watch apollos
[2:01:26] verse 2097 and when he was disposed to
[2:01:29] pass into akaya
[2:01:31] the brethren wrote exalting the disciple
[2:01:34] to receive him
[2:01:35] who when he was come to do what
[2:01:39] apollos came to help
[2:01:42] to help them
[2:01:43] match which had believed through the
[2:01:46] water
[2:01:47] apollos was called to come and help the
[2:01:50] people that just believe
[2:01:52] verse 28 for he murderly
[2:01:58] convinced the jews
[2:02:01] and that publicly
[2:02:03] everybody okay
[2:02:04] showing by the water
[2:02:07] that jesus was what
[2:02:09] so apollos
[2:02:12] didn't bring a new message
[2:02:18] amen apollos took what was already
[2:02:21] brought forth
[2:02:23] everybody here and use the scriptures
[2:02:27] everybody okay
[2:02:29] to nail the message is zeroed in in
[2:02:33] other words apollos take the message and
[2:02:35] he
[2:02:36] generate the message perfectly with the
[2:02:39] scripture until you don't know which way
[2:02:42] to go
[2:02:43] that is called watering
[2:02:49] everybody okay so far
[2:02:51] so paul said that i planted but apollos
[2:02:55] when he comes he doesn't bring a new
[2:02:58] message he doesn't touch the message
[2:03:01] that was already printed but apollo
[2:03:03] stick the scripture and begin to show
[2:03:06] you that what paul was saying it is
[2:03:09] written here what brother branham was
[2:03:11] saying it is written here what brother
[2:03:14] branham was saying it is written here
[2:03:16] apollos was building up he was watering
[2:03:20] power
[2:03:22] not changing power not bringing a new
[2:03:25] gospel but wondering what was already
[2:03:28] planted by paul
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:33] we don't have another message to preach
[2:03:37] we don't have other sermons to preach we
[2:03:40] already have their spoken word which is
[2:03:43] the original seed our job is to order
[2:03:47] the spoken word by bringing the people
[2:03:50] through the scripture
[2:03:52] and they can see what brother branham
[2:03:54] said in the scripture
[2:04:01] everybody here
[2:04:03] but god but god gives the water
[2:04:07] so that neither is he that planted
[2:04:10] anything
[2:04:11] neither is he that does what
[2:04:13] but god that gives water all the glory
[2:04:16] goes back to god and he that planteth
[2:04:19] and he the water of our water so you
[2:04:22] must be one with your messenger
[2:04:25] repeat what the messenger say

[2:16:57] everybody okay
[2:16:59] anybody okay
[2:17:00] and he said i shall command the young
[2:17:03] men
[2:17:04] now as you go along the reapers
[2:17:08] the water
[2:17:09] you see the scripture right
[2:17:11] he said every once in a while let her
[2:17:14] glean wherever she want to and then drop
[2:17:17] a little handful on purpose
[2:17:20] let's go to roof 2 now and let's drop to
[2:17:22] milk
[2:17:23] let's drop to milk
[2:17:28] everybody okay
[2:17:30] my god
[2:17:36] oh my god
[2:17:38] you ready
[2:17:39] all right let's get it
[2:17:41] luke chapter two
[2:17:45] she found grace she was looking for
[2:17:47] grace
[2:17:48] jump to verse
[2:17:50] five
[2:17:51] then say boaz
[2:17:53] to his servant
[2:17:54] that was set over the reapers
[2:17:58] the supervisor
[2:17:59] the chief reaper
[2:18:01] boaz came and talked to him boaz never
[2:18:04] came and talked to roof
[2:18:05] [Music]
[2:18:07] anybody here
[2:18:08] he came first to the chief reaper
[2:18:11] you shall be judged first
[2:18:14] you remember last sunday to the chief
[2:18:16] reaper
[2:18:17] and he asked for the report
[2:18:20] he says whose demsel is this
[2:18:23] so the one who can give the detail
[2:18:26] is somebody else
[2:18:28] the chief reaper
[2:18:30] who's responsible
[2:18:32] for whatever is in it
[2:18:34] roof under
[2:18:36] in other words before boaz came
[2:18:41] roof was under the supervision of the
[2:18:44] chief reaper
[2:18:48] here the chief reaper have his light
[2:18:52] of the roof
[2:18:56] in other words roof was under the wing
[2:19:00] of the chief reaper
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:04] here
[2:19:05] ever here
[2:19:06] the chief reaper
[2:19:08] represented boaz
[2:19:11] but he was not bowers
[2:19:14] he was only a reflection of boaz
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:22] everybody okay
[2:19:23] when boss is absent that's when he's
[2:19:26] charming
[2:19:32] because the candlesticks
[2:19:35] are used when there is darkness
[2:19:39] brother branham said can the stick speak
[2:19:42] of the abscess of the sun
[2:19:46] and you need the light when the sun is
[2:19:49] not there because boys represented
[2:19:51] christ
[2:19:52] but when christ is not there
[2:19:55] you must be in the field
[2:19:58] that is
[2:19:59] they have the
[2:20:00] representative
[2:20:02] of bowers
[2:20:04] you cannot go to any kind of field
[2:20:09] let me help you up again
[2:20:13] according to the law according to god
[2:20:18] according to the law
[2:20:20] according to the word of god
[2:20:23] every field
[2:20:26] in israel
[2:20:28] can give food to anybody
[2:20:32] anybody here
[2:20:33] if i go to brother kalima's field if
[2:20:36] he's working i can get food if i go to
[2:20:38] brother greg for the field i can get
[2:20:41] food if i go to brother hamilton field i
[2:20:44] can get through every field that is in
[2:20:46] israel can give you food
[2:20:48] all of them are jewish field
[2:20:52] anybody here
[2:20:54] but every field cannot give you marriage
[2:21:01] are you with me
[2:21:03] every field can give you the natural
[2:21:06] food that you need
[2:21:10] everybody
[2:21:11] but not every field can give you
[2:21:14] marriage
[2:21:15] because jesus taught the woman
[2:21:17] everywhere you can drink of this water
[2:21:20] tomorrow you'll be thirsty again
[2:21:24] but there is another world another
[2:21:26] heaven
[2:21:28] if i give you that water
[2:21:30] you will never come to this anymore
[2:21:32] ever here so when you go to the field of
[2:21:35] israel roof could have been gone here
[2:21:38] and get something for food and go back
[2:21:41] home
[2:21:41] he can go here and get some kind of food
[2:21:44] and go back home but all this field
[2:21:47] even though they are jewish filled
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:54] even though they are christians filled
[2:21:57] [Music]
[2:22:01] they can provide you some kind of food
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:07] the pentecostal can preach the bible
[2:22:10] the baptist can preach the bible
[2:22:12] the presbyterian can preach the bible
[2:22:16] but they are not the qualified field for
[2:22:18] you
[2:22:21] the denomination can give you the bible
[2:22:24] because the bible is universal
[2:22:28] but you must be in the field that can
[2:22:31] give you not only baba that can give you
[2:22:34] more than bubble a field that can bring
[2:22:37] you into relationship
[2:22:40] into marriage
[2:22:42] and that field must have a chief repair
[2:22:46] [Music]
[2:22:49] it is a field that is connected by
[2:22:52] bloodline
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:22:57] you must see your family blood in that
[2:23:00] field
[2:23:01] that's the field that you go through
[2:23:06] because they are the field you can eat
[2:23:08] all you want
[2:23:09] and you will remain in that situation
[2:23:12] it's just soothing you
[2:23:14] and tomorrow you hungry tomorrow you
[2:23:16] hungry but your condition doesn't change
[2:23:21] you go there we know you come there a
[2:23:23] widow you go there a widow you come
[2:23:25] there a widow but there is only one
[2:23:27] field
[2:23:28] if you enter there
[2:23:29] he can lock you and change you from a
[2:23:32] widow woman
[2:23:34] into a married woman
[2:23:36] because nobody in israel can marry you
[2:23:40] only the line of judah
[2:23:42] and not everybody in the land of judah
[2:23:45] it must be the wrong line of judah
[2:23:48] [Music]
[2:23:54] everybody okay so far
[2:23:56] so this field
[2:23:58] is important where you landed
[2:24:01] when you land there boaz is not there
[2:24:04] you find the chief reaper the chief
[2:24:06] reaper is giving report
[2:24:08] let's go my friend we good on time when

[2:24:21] when you come out there oh we finish
[2:24:24] your time because you drop back in time
[2:24:28] anybody here
[2:24:30] verse five whose stem cell is this and
[2:24:32] the servant that was set over the water
[2:24:35] do you see the chief ripper
[2:24:37] he's on top of everybody
[2:24:40] every single reaper is under the ripper
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:46] you remember
[2:24:47] every single reaper
[2:24:50] in the field gabor
[2:24:52] and the chief written
[2:24:54] under
[2:24:56] you listen to what the chief reaper say
[2:24:59] you repeat what the chief reaper said
[2:25:02] because the chief reaper doesn't speak
[2:25:05] his mind
[2:25:06] he's getting the program from boards
[2:25:10] he's accomplishing the agenda of bowers
[2:25:16] follow me as a follower
[2:25:24] everybody here
[2:25:26] verse six
[2:25:28] and the servant that was set up for the
[2:25:30] the reapers answered and say it is the
[2:25:33] more british damsel how did he know that
[2:25:37] how did he know that who taught him that
[2:25:42] he knows the family of uh of boaz
[2:25:45] he knows the lineage
[2:25:47] he understands he can connect to lima
[2:25:50] like was a brother to boaz and he knows
[2:25:52] everything
[2:25:54] everybody here
[2:25:55] the damsel that came back with naomi out
[2:25:58] of the country of moab
[2:26:00] and she said now the chief reaper began
[2:26:02] to speak to boaz what happened before
[2:26:05] boaz got there
[2:26:06] she said
[2:26:08] i pray you you remember that
[2:26:11] let me glean and gather after the
[2:26:13] reapers among the chief so roof could
[2:26:16] not go and start
[2:26:17] gleaning she have to ask
[2:26:21] and somebody in the absence of boaz have
[2:26:24] to grant
[2:26:25] that grace
[2:26:27] that roof was looking because it was
[2:26:29] grace to reap
[2:26:31] somebody gotta give her the grace even
[2:26:33] though boaz is not there
[2:26:35] i don't know what is wrong with the
[2:26:37] screen

[2:27:01] house
[2:27:03] why did the chief reaper tell tell ruth

[2:27:08] it looks like the chief reaper knew the
[2:27:10] mind of boaz
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:16] and the chief reaper understood that if
[2:27:19] i put that woman over there he's not
[2:27:20] going to get mad
[2:27:23] because it's part of his family
[2:27:25] [Music]

[2:35:23] you ate yesterday it becomes an
[2:35:26] intentional cupcake

[2:35:34] language

[2:35:45] he didn't say anything but he's talking
[2:35:48] with a cupcake
[2:35:53] everybody okay
[2:35:54] so when the wolf begins to go
[2:35:57] she remember she knows how she claimed

[2:36:46] the third food of
[2:36:48] roof then i'm gonna come back to the
[2:36:50] intention
[2:36:51] is this
[2:36:52] in roof three the bible says that also
[2:36:56] he said bring the veil that that has
[2:36:59] upon thee when ruth met with boaz
[2:37:01] without anybody
[2:37:04] and hold it and when she held that he
[2:37:06] measured how many
[2:37:08] measures of water
[2:37:12] disturbed the roof this
[2:37:15] was under the reaper
[2:37:18] ever here
[2:37:19] this under the reapers
[2:37:22] everybody here
[2:37:23] behind the maiden
[2:37:26] everybody here
[2:37:27] but this one
[2:37:29] is six measures
[2:37:31] of barley
[2:37:34] directly
[2:37:37] from boas
[2:37:38] nobody in between
[2:37:41] no repairs
[2:37:42] no maiden
[2:37:44] directly straight from boast
[2:37:47] sixth measure
[2:37:48] why six
[2:37:50] six is the number of men
[2:37:53] everybody okay
[2:37:55] and oh and when she came to her
[2:37:58] mother-in-law she said who are they my
[2:38:00] daughter in other words how did things
[2:38:02] go
[2:38:03] america and she told her oh that the man
[2:38:06] has what done to her did boast do
[2:38:09] anything you who know the scripture
[2:38:11] nothing
[2:38:12] but he just gave her six measures of
[2:38:14] valley and she said this sixth measure
[2:38:17] of valley gave him me for he said to me
[2:38:20] go not empty unto that mother in love so

[2:41:00] let me see where to get hallelujah
[2:41:03] hallelujah so we got the first food
[2:41:06] general the second purpose intentional
[2:41:09] the third one is boaz himself
[2:41:12] giving the food what is the first food
[2:41:16] brother stephen
[2:41:18] and while she was gleaning in the field
[2:41:20] directed by the holy spirit to go into
[2:41:23] that field to glean you see why brother
[2:41:25] branham says this
[2:41:26] then come up boaz up kemboas boaz was a
[2:41:31] representative of who
[2:41:33] and for he was the lord of the harvest
[2:41:35] he was over the harvest and notice as
[2:41:38] soon as he looked out in the field and
[2:41:41] saw that gentle girl he did water
[2:41:46] now the prophet begin to open it
[2:41:48] but here
[2:41:50] why she was gleaming behind the what
[2:41:53] this general food
[2:41:55] everybody okay
[2:41:56] that is what the church has to do
[2:42:00] pick up a little bit here
[2:42:02] and a little bit there
[2:42:04] cleaning reading over there and seeing
[2:42:07] what who
[2:42:09] and what the
[2:42:11] and how the way of redemption was what
[2:42:15] picking up this little cleaning behind
[2:42:17] the jewish water
[2:42:19] there see what i mean that grain that
[2:42:22] she that they were ripping represented
[2:42:24] what
[2:42:25] what
[2:42:27] eternal life to us out of the water
[2:42:30] the word of water
[2:42:32] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:42:34] every water
[2:42:36] so the general food
[2:42:38] that roof was getting behind the reapers
[2:42:42] remember roof came from the other court
[2:42:46] young in the faith
[2:42:50] about here and suddenly she began to
[2:42:53] read her bible more
[2:42:56] amen
[2:42:57] amen
[2:42:59] after you gave your heart to the lord
[2:43:02] after you gave your
[2:43:04] you went to the world of baptism did you
[2:43:06] notice that after a while you begin to
[2:43:08] read the bible more
[2:43:10] do you know who was reading the bible
[2:43:12] brother branham said she began to look
[2:43:14] at job
[2:43:15] you begin to read the barber mold
[2:43:18] but still that's a general food
[2:43:21] you don't understand the bible quite
[2:43:23] late because you're younger in the faith
[2:43:29] everybody okay
[2:43:30] brother brother says this
[2:43:33] hallelujah
[2:43:34] brother branham says this he says so
[2:43:37] what was she gleaning for she was
[2:43:40] gleaming for food
[2:43:42] and that's what the gentile church did
[2:43:45] coming behind the orthodox church
[2:43:47] picking up all the head which was the
[2:43:49] water
[2:43:51] gleaming what god give to the water
[2:43:53] so when you are coming out from the
[2:43:57] article from under justification when
[2:43:59] you start entering into sanctification
[2:44:03] the first sign you would notice you
[2:44:06] begin to get in tune with reading the
[2:44:08] bible
[2:44:12] if it didn't happen to you go check it
[2:44:13] again
[2:44:14] but here you will read the bible without
[2:44:17] understanding what you're reading
[2:44:19] you just read it looks like something in
[2:44:21] you love the bible story love the bible
[2:44:23] story you don't know what is going on
[2:44:25] because you just move into another stage
[2:44:27] but here once you get in that stage then
[2:44:30] the food change
[2:44:33] here from a general reading of the baba
[2:44:37] into a food that is given on purpose
[2:44:41] or intentionally
[2:44:44] and that food comes from the reapers
[2:44:48] the reaper pull it from the ship
[2:44:52] you didn't have access to that
[2:44:54] the reaper have access to that because
[2:44:58] the reapers are angels
[2:45:00] the reaper are messenger
[2:45:03] the reaper are gifted people
[2:45:07] everybody here by their gift
[2:45:11] they can enter in the world anybody here
[2:45:15] and they can get a revelation
[2:45:19] here and they can pull that out
[2:45:22] and when you come to church
[2:45:25] all discouraged
[2:45:27] going through a lot of headache in life

[2:53:27] anybody here
[2:53:28] brother bottom say the way this light

[2:53:34] was there was a fire that came from the
[2:53:37] feeling of fire
[2:53:39] anybody here
[2:53:40] so we got a pillar of fire here
[2:53:42] and the leak of fire dropped
[2:53:44] and came
[2:53:46] and got there
[2:53:47] then detect this light and delete the

[2:56:01] the seven spirit of god means that it is
[2:56:04] one spirit and the same spirit coming
[2:56:06] forth in what
[2:56:09] anybody okay
[2:56:10] but what i'm saying in revelation 4 in
[2:56:12] heaven
[2:56:13] it is the same spirit the same seven
[2:56:16] spirit are called the lamps of fire
[2:56:20] burning before the lord
[2:56:22] since john always used nothing but the
[2:56:25] old testament symbols in the revelation
[2:56:28] we got to go in the old testament and
[2:56:30] found from proverbs 20 27
[2:56:33] the spirit of a man is what
[2:56:36] a lamp unto the lord so these seven
[2:56:39] spirits are found to be associated with
[2:56:42] what
[2:56:43] so the seven spirits that are here are
[2:56:46] connected to human being
[2:56:52] anybody here
[2:56:54] all right
[2:56:55] now brother branham say
[2:56:57] i have to skip this one
[2:56:59] because of time you can read it at home
[2:57:03] come on brother branham say it is
[2:57:05] evident that the servant spirit of god
[2:57:08] referred to the continuous
[2:57:11] ministry of the same holy spirit in the
[2:57:15] lives of seven men
[2:57:18] with whom god
[2:57:20] identified himself
[2:57:22] very
[2:57:24] a chief reaper
[2:57:27] closely anybody here
[2:57:30] they are his eyes
[2:57:32] they are his what
[2:57:35] who these men are can easily be seen
[2:57:38] because the next phrase called them the
[2:57:41] seven what
[2:57:43] which are already known to us as the
[2:57:46] seventh messenger to the seven water so
[2:57:50] these seven spirits are the seven
[2:57:53] anointing that came upon the messenger
[2:57:57] of the edges
[2:58:00] in heaven
[2:58:02] the star
[2:58:03] war before the throne reflecting on the
[2:58:07] sea of glass
[2:58:09] but in the tabernacle it is different
[2:58:12] this is where i'm going to drop and go
[2:58:15] anybody okay
[2:58:16] brother bonham say in every age we have
[2:58:19] exactly the same pattern that is why the
[2:58:23] light comes through some god-given man
[2:58:26] in a certain area the chief reaper
[2:58:29] and then from that messenger the chief
[2:58:32] reaper they spread the light through the
[2:58:35] ministry of others the reapers who has
[2:58:39] been fed fully what
[2:58:41] apollos
[2:58:43] anybody okay
[2:58:44] his messenger returned back
[2:58:47] the messenger of joshua despised i have
[2:58:50] obeyed your orders and there was a woman
[2:58:53] we found we played the tape to you
[2:58:57] brother brother said that when the spies
[2:59:00] went into jericho they enter into herald
[2:59:03] they played the tips
[2:59:09] in the time of jericho did they have
[2:59:11] tips
[2:59:18] push play
[2:59:19] did they have tips
[2:59:22] who was the tips
[2:59:26] the spies
[2:59:27] the tape
[2:59:28] made flesh
[2:59:34] [Music]
[2:59:35] a tape doesn't manufacture the message
[2:59:40] a tape doesn't change the message
[2:59:44] a tape only repeats what has been
[2:59:47] recorded into him
[2:59:51] they repeat it what they received from
[2:59:54] joshua
[2:59:55] [Music]
[2:59:59] hallelujah
[3:00:01] in exodus 26 the bible says that that
[3:00:04] shall hang up the veil
[3:00:07] this one
[3:00:08] under the touches and that the mayor's
[3:00:10] bringing tether within the veil the ark
[3:00:13] of the testimony we are here
[3:00:16] and the veil shall divide unto you
[3:00:19] between the water
[3:00:21] and the water
[3:00:22] it is this veil right here ever here
[3:00:25] and that shall put the mercy seat upon
[3:00:28] the ark of the testimony in the most
[3:00:30] water
[3:00:31] we are here everybody
[3:00:33] and that shall set the table
[3:00:36] without the in other words outside this
[3:00:39] bear in the holy place that's where you
[3:00:42] put the table where was the table
[3:00:45] and the candle stick over against the
[3:00:48] water
[3:00:49] so in the tabernacle the candlestick
[3:00:53] were opposite to the table
[3:00:58] anybody okay
[3:00:59] so when they lit the candlestick
[3:01:02] the candlestick were given light
[3:01:05] and the light of the candlestick
[3:01:08] was charming on the table
[3:01:13] what was on the table
[3:01:17] everybody okay
[3:01:19] and over against the table on the side
[3:01:22] of the tabernacle towards the water
[3:01:25] and that shall put the table on the
[3:01:27] water so on the north side because this
[3:01:30] is the east gate this is the west the
[3:01:34] north is here the surf is here so on the
[3:01:37] north
[3:01:38] where the eagle dan is
[3:01:41] this is where the showbread was put
[3:01:43] there
[3:01:44] and over against that were the
[3:01:46] candlestick
[3:01:47] and the candlestick have the light from
[3:01:49] the pillar of fire and that light was
[3:01:52] shining on the bread
[3:01:56] ever here so when you enter in the holy
[3:01:59] place
[3:02:00] you must find the field that have the
[3:02:02] candlestick
[3:02:05] and those candlesticks must shine on the
[3:02:08] world
[3:02:10] and the light from the candlestick
[3:02:13] is shining on the world
[3:02:18] the light from the messenger goes
[3:02:21] through the bible and when he pick up
[3:02:23] the bible he opened the bible to you
[3:02:27] this is where you need to stay this is
[3:02:30] where you need to eat this is why you
[3:02:32] need to serve this is where you need to
[3:02:35] abide this is your plan of redemption
[3:02:38] that's where you stand in the field of
[3:02:41] prowess under the messenger of the hour
[3:02:45] under the reapers under the churches
[3:02:48] that are under the message of the hour
[3:02:51] let's stand
[3:03:00] you don't glean anywhere
[3:03:03] before you gleam
[3:03:05] you must know which field you're
[3:03:06] gleaning
[3:03:08] because the favor of boaz is only on
[3:03:10] that field you go to that field
[3:03:14] and make sure there is a reaper
[3:03:16] and stay under the reaper
[3:03:19] and the reaper must stay under the chief
[3:03:21] reaper
[3:03:22] if the reaper is not under the chief
[3:03:25] reaper you are on the wrong reaper
[3:03:28] you need to come out
[3:03:31] right here because at the absence of
[3:03:33] boaz you must be under the candlestick
[3:03:37] the candlestick must give you light
[3:03:40] everybody here
[3:03:41] because the candlestick are going to
[3:03:43] shine on the showbread
[3:03:45] and then when they shine on the
[3:03:46] showbread the light from the candlestick
[3:03:49] hit the show bread
[3:03:51] and then the showbread now is a
[3:03:53] different bread
[3:03:54] and we will see they call that show
[3:03:57] bread
[3:03:58] why is this show bread
[3:04:05] do you know what showbread means
[3:04:08] it means the bread of his presence
[3:04:12] when that bread is there he is there
[3:04:18] back here and nobody eats those bread
[3:04:21] except the priest
[3:04:24] or you must be in the lineage of david
[3:04:27] following david
[3:04:29] and david can get that bread
[3:04:31] [Music]
[3:04:34] and nothing happened to you only the
[3:04:36] priest can get it
[3:04:39] and those bread were sean from the
[3:04:41] candlestick roof
[3:04:43] serving you don't serve any kind of way
[3:04:46] you don't serve in any kind of field
[3:04:49] you don't serve with any kind of food
[3:04:51] you must serve under the field of boaz
[3:04:55] under the messenger
[3:04:58] and if there is a preacher that preacher
[3:05:00] must follow the messenger
[3:05:02] to keep the program of boaz
[3:05:05] for your life because the one who's
[3:05:07] giving instruction is boaz
[3:05:10] and all we do is delivering whatever
[3:05:13] boaz is saying
[3:05:14] and what he's delivering is only an
[3:05:17] expression of love
[3:05:19] and that he's preparing you because he's
[3:05:21] going to take you to somewhere and when
[3:05:24] he take you that place you're going to
[3:05:26] receive the third food
[3:05:29] and the third food nobody gave it to you
[3:05:33] it only boasts
[3:05:34] do you know that food
[3:05:37] can i tell you
[3:05:39] do you know in revelation 10
[3:05:43] when the marriage came down
[3:05:47] everybody
[3:05:49] he had what
[3:05:50] he had a book
[3:05:53] and 10 7 who was there
[3:05:56] the messenger
[3:05:57] the chief reaper everybody here
[3:06:01] the chief reaper sundered the trumpet
[3:06:04] but the chief reaper didn't give you the
[3:06:05] book
[3:06:08] everybody here
[3:06:10] they told john now
[3:06:13] you go yourself
[3:06:16] you go to boaz
[3:06:18] that book only boasts
[3:06:21] you take it from boaz
[3:06:22] [Music]
[3:06:25] the chief reaper can send it
[3:06:27] but boaz is the one that gave it to you
[3:06:32] back here
[3:06:33] the chief reaper didn't take it and gave
[3:06:35] it to john they said no the voice told
[3:06:37] john you go
[3:06:39] go tell the angel
[3:06:43] the angel said i'm not gonna give it to
[3:06:44] you
[3:06:47] [Music]
[3:06:50] when john put his hand there there was
[3:06:53] no chief reaper there was no reaper it
[3:06:56] was the hand of john and the hand of
[3:06:58] boaz
[3:06:58] [Music]
[3:07:03] that's a different food
[3:07:05] about here
[3:07:07] that's a different food
[3:07:08] once you swallow that you can prophesy
[3:07:11] let's pray heavenly father
[3:07:13] lord we thank you again father for your
[3:07:15] grace
[3:07:16] for your love your mercy
[3:07:18] and for everything you have been doing
[3:07:20] for us
[3:07:21] father many subject has been touched
[3:07:24] due to the depth of this book lord
[3:07:27] there are many ways we can go
[3:07:30] because the scripture is so loaded
[3:07:33] but father the main thing is you want
[3:07:35] your children to understand
[3:07:37] that to serve you
[3:07:39] we don't serve you any kind of way
[3:07:41] we don't serve you in any kind of field
[3:07:44] there is a program a plan of redemption
[3:07:47] when we enter that stage
[3:07:49] we must make sure that the bread we are
[3:07:52] eating
[3:07:53] is a bread that have a light
[3:07:56] that is reflecting from the candlestick
[3:07:58] of the age
[3:08:00] because that's the bread
[3:08:02] that's going to prepare us
[3:08:04] father to enter into the most holy
[3:08:08] father like you spoke
[3:08:10] weeks ago
[3:08:12] that the water
[3:08:14] the message of noah
[3:08:15] could not work in moses time
[3:08:18] the message of moses could not work in
[3:08:20] the time of jesus
[3:08:21] and the message of jesus could not work
[3:08:23] in the time of moses because there is a
[3:08:25] specific water
[3:08:27] there is a specific field there is a
[3:08:29] specific candlestick there is a specific
[3:08:32] bread there is a specific wheat that
[3:08:35] must be given to a people and that's the
[3:08:38] wheat that's going to clean up your
[3:08:41] bread under sanctification
[3:08:43] and remove everything else that is not
[3:08:46] like you
[3:08:47] for the denomination we can glean
[3:08:49] something here and there
[3:08:51] but that which is giving under the
[3:08:53] nomination is not able to take the pants
[3:08:55] off of the woman
[3:08:57] it's not able to take the high heel of
[3:08:59] the woman
[3:09:00] it's not able to take the short hair
[3:09:02] from the women it's not able to change
[3:09:05] people
[3:09:06] it's only covering the people and
[3:09:08] keeping them in the very state that they
[3:09:10] came in
[3:09:12] but father there is a word that can wash
[3:09:15] there is a word a bread that can wash
[3:09:18] that the one who's partaking to this
[3:09:20] bread
[3:09:21] even though it's painful through the
[3:09:23] candlestick because there is a beating
[3:09:25] that is going on there but father that
[3:09:28] word not only is it washing but it's
[3:09:31] chipping everything that is not like you
[3:09:33] away
[3:09:34] because you could not associate with
[3:09:36] roof that quick
[3:09:38] you have to go
[3:09:39] further through the pen and the toes
[3:09:42] that she's working
[3:09:43] father sweating under the sun but you
[3:09:46] keep showing your goodness
[3:09:48] father encouraging her that know that i
[3:09:50] love you
[3:09:51] i am still with you i'm watching over
[3:09:53] you i am the one protecting you i am the
[3:09:56] one encouraging you it's a little bit
[3:09:58] harder but keep cleaning keep cleaning
[3:10:00] all i want is a character from you i
[3:10:03] want everything that is not like me to
[3:10:05] be completely stripped away i want
[3:10:07] everything that you came with from moab
[3:10:09] to be completely taken off and when all
[3:10:12] is taken off then i can receive you as
[3:10:15] my brother and i can put my seals of
[3:10:17] circumcision father we thank you for
[3:10:20] everything and we are committing this
[3:10:22] church unto the hand and the sacrifice
[3:10:24] they're doing to go extra my lord so

[3:10:42] children lord and to give them a
[3:10:44] revelation so that they can understand
[3:10:47] that this is not a legalistic standpoint

[3:10:53] it is not that we taking the the uh
[3:10:56] paint off because
[3:10:59] we are on the obligation but we're
[3:11:01] taking the paint off because we're
[3:11:04] trying to find grace we're trying to
[3:11:06] please the lord we're trying to do
[3:11:08] things that is going to make him happy
