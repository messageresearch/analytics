[45:33] else is he going to do
[45:36] himself amen and did what feed thee and
[45:40] feed you and fed you with what man so
[45:44] when God bring the hunger he doesn't
[45:47] even give you natural food come on
[45:49] Brother come on brother yes sir who
[45:53] brought the hunger God so who need to
[45:56] provide for the food
[45:59] God what kind of food did he
[46:03] give if you tired we close we go home
[46:08] right
[46:12] Mana glory to
[46:14] God Amen and then he fed you with Mana
[46:20] which you knew
[46:21] not so if God never brought
[46:26] hunger to these people they would never
[46:28] know
[46:30] mana come
[46:32] on it your hunger will cat you to
[46:37] McDonald your hunger will take you to
[46:40] Chick-fil-A but God's hunger will give
[46:42] you something you never
[46:44] experienced it's a hunger that will
[46:46] produce oil in the vessel and your
[46:49] children will never be slave again yes
[46:52] sir Brother come on brother yes sir
[46:56] [Laughter]
[46:59] it amen amen so it's an opportunity for
[47:03] God to show you something that you never
[47:05] experienced yes sir I don't even know if
[47:08] I would touch what I'm trying to preach
[47:12] tonight I know where I am it's so
[47:15] deep amen glory to God oh
[47:20] my Lord help me which you knew not
[47:24] neither did your father
[47:28] no so God can give you a personal
[47:32] experience that nobody in your family
[47:35] ever experien
[47:38] it if you waiting for whatever happened
[47:41] to your father to happen to you God can
[47:43] give you something that never even your
[47:45] father experiences maybe your parent
[47:48] never even experienced God can give you
[47:50] a special blessing that no one in your
[47:53] family ever touch that kind of blessing
[47:57] am I reading a different Bible no
[48:00] sir GL GL thank you Jesus
[48:05] amen glory he said neither did your
[48:09] father know that he man make you
[48:12] know that water man does not live by
[48:15] bread only so everything that happened
[48:18] here God was doing that for one
[48:22] purpose he make you hungry
[48:26] amen where there is no food that's right
[48:29] amen am so humanly speaking we're
[48:31] looking for food but God ambushed us and
[48:35] he placed Us in the wilderness in the
[48:37] place where there is no food to show you
[48:40] that you need to look at something more
[48:43] than
[48:44] food you need to look at something more
[48:47] than the
[48:48] natural that's why I put you because if
[48:50] food was there if food were there you're
[48:53] going to be looking at the tree to get
[48:55] something for food when Jesus was hungry
[48:57] he saw a tree what did he do curs the
[48:59] tree he went to the tree straight ahead
[49:02] to find food when there was no food he
[49:04] cursed the tree that's right but if you
[49:06] get in the wilderness there is no Tree
[49:08] in other word everywhere you look there
[49:10] is
[49:11] nothing God Did It for a
[49:14] purpose how can you hunger in the
[49:18] wilderness in a place where there is no
[49:20] food God wanted to teach Israel
[49:23] something that my word
[49:26] is more than
[49:27] food are we together so God want to
[49:31] teach you that man shall not leave by
[49:33] Bread what only but by every what that
[49:37] word word that proceed out of the mouth
[49:40] of what the Lord does men what live so
[49:43] the purpose of the trial is to bring men
[49:47] to a higher
[49:51] Dimension is to take man from a natural
[49:54] dimension come on now amen into a
[49:58] spiritual Dimension where men begin to
[50:02] depend not on natural
[50:06] resources but man is depending on the
[50:09] word of
[50:11] God Amen because the word can produce
[50:16] bread but bread cannot produce the
[50:22] word the word of God can produce your
[50:24] hamburger
[50:27] amen God does not only produce natural
[50:31] food God can produce a cook
[50:35] food because Jesus they gave him cooked
[50:38] food and cooked fishes Jesus never
[50:41] multiplied them into raw fishes he
[50:44] multiplied them in a food that was
[50:47] already cooked and seasoned and well
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:52] done so God can produce natural food and
[50:57] he can produce also cooked food so the
[51:00] word of God is greater than
[51:04] anything come on now what is the purpose
[51:07] of the Wilderness is to take you away
[51:09] from the natural resources yes into a
[51:12] spiritual resources sir is to take you
[51:15] away from the natural dependency into a
[51:19] spiritual dependency am where you can be
[51:21] in the wilderness and you still trust
[51:24] him Amen in the of death you still trust
[51:27] him when there is no oil you still trust
[51:30] him when there is no food you still
[51:32] trust him when there is nothing at home
[51:34] you still trust God because he is
[51:37] Jehovah jar
[51:40] amen glory glory
[51:43] glory
[51:45] come are we together yes are we
[51:50] together the song that was sung here
[51:52] should have taught you the level of the
[51:54] anointing that is in this place tonight

[52:29] problem your clothing can get in
[52:32] trouble because you don't have time to

[53:16] guaranteed so when you're going into the
[53:18] Wilderness your car cannot break
[53:22] down if your car is broken down you need
[53:24] to go back to
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:29] God he's taking care of the
[53:33] food he's taking care of the

[54:46] resource

[56:40] as the what Hypocrites
[56:42] Pretenders amen for they love to pray
[56:47] standing where in the synagog in the
[56:49] corners of the what streets that they
[56:51] may be what seen of men so the purpose
[56:54] of their prayer is to impress somebody

[57:46] when you pray use not what vain
[57:51] repetitions as the who Heathen do for
[57:54] for they think that they shall be heard

[58:37] God why God doesn't want us to repeat so
[58:41] much because the problem is do not use

[58:47] they're repeating to repeat the things
[58:48] that if they talk too much God will hear
[58:52] them watch what God is saying amen why
[58:56] is God saying that why we don't need to
[58:58] have V
[59:00] repetition why V repetition we don't

[59:58] know what I'm about to ask why should I
[1:00:01] ask amen

[1:03:26] then get to here that's the
[1:03:28] problem amen let's go to Luke chapter
[1:03:33] 11 all of this is because of the
[1:03:36] seals it's the power of the seals since
[1:03:40] the seals are broken the Bible open up
[1:03:42] in a different form and in the deepest
[1:03:45] way amen Luke 11 verse one if you dare
[1:03:49] you can say amen
[1:03:52] amen and he came to pass that as he was
[1:03:55] praying in a certain place when he sees
[1:03:58] whoever Miss part one 2 and three one of
[1:04:01] his disciples said to him Lord do what

[1:04:06] our title so you can teach somebody to
[1:04:09] pray everybody okay amen teach us to
[1:04:12] pray as John also did what taught his
[1:04:16] disciples so John taught his disciple
[1:04:18] had to pray amen and they asked Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ to teach also us how to pray amen
[1:04:23] verse two and he said to them when you
[1:04:26] pray say what Our Father which are in
[1:04:28] heaven Hallowed Be Your Name Your

[1:04:49] give us this day over the day he say
[1:04:52] give us what day by by day day by
[1:04:58] day so we gave the two versions amen
[1:05:02] give us day by day in other word every
[1:05:05] day God need to give us
[1:05:09] something amen he need okay let me go
[1:05:12] your way God need to give us
[1:05:15] bread that that one you will say amen
[1:05:17] amen every day God need to give us bread
[1:05:21] so every day you need to do what to God
[1:05:25] pray doing what asking for asking him
[1:05:27] for what bread how many days every day
[1:05:30] did you ask him for bread today no we
[1:05:33] didn't did you ask him for bread today
[1:05:35] because you got bread in your

[1:11:39] you brother Angel he say teach us to
[1:11:41] pray and we are talking today it's part
[1:11:44] four on our daily
[1:11:46] bread our provider amen let me go this
[1:11:51] way so you make sure you look at teach
[1:11:53] us to pray Our Daily Bread provider amen
[1:11:58] Amen on part one we spoke about Our
[1:12:02] Father which are in heaven and we
[1:12:06] explained that he was showing a
[1:12:09] relationship that exists between us and
[1:12:12] God and that relationship is a
[1:12:15] relationship between a father and a son
[1:12:18] so when you are approaching God In
[1:12:20] Prayer Jesus wants you to approach God
[1:12:22] In Prayer as a child who's approaching a
[1:12:25] father everybody clear amen then we went
[1:12:28] on part one and seen that Our Father
[1:12:31] which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:12:34] in other words when you come into His
[1:12:36] presence you need to worship him then on
[1:12:38] part two we went through your kingdom
[1:12:41] come amen and your will be done amen and
[1:12:44] part three we went through your will be
[1:12:47] done in earth on Earth as it is in
[1:12:50] heaven and we seen the scene of Queen
[1:12:52] Esther whenever she goes to the king she
[1:12:54] say whatever pleases the king because
[1:12:57] there could be a uh uh uh there could be
[1:13:01] something contrary between your will and
[1:13:04] God's will that's why Jesus said
[1:13:06] nevertheless not my will but your will
[1:13:09] they could be a contradiction between
[1:13:11] your will and God's will that's why we
[1:13:13] always say your will be done you bring
[1:13:16] your petition but God might have
[1:13:18] something better for you because he
[1:13:19] always have something better for us amen
[1:13:23] and when we say the kingdom come in part
[1:13:25] two we explain to you that the kingdom
[1:13:28] of God according to brother BR means the
[1:13:30] spirit of the Lord because we need the
[1:13:32] spirit of the Lord to come and to help
[1:13:34] us pray if not we will be praying with
[1:13:37] our own intelligence Paul is saying this
[1:13:40] in Romans chapter 8:1 15 Paul say that
[1:13:44] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:13:47] bondage again to do what fear but ye
[1:13:51] have received the spirit of what adop
[1:13:53] whereby we cry what ABA father ABA
[1:13:57] father if you notice the spirit also
[1:13:59] when he comes into your life he want to
[1:14:02] establish the fatherhood of God into you
[1:14:04] amen he want you to understand that God
[1:14:07] is your father amen and Jesus say when
[1:14:09] you pray you say your father before even
[1:14:11] you pray your father already know amen
[1:14:15] he's your God but when it comes to
[1:14:17] prayer he want you to understand him as
[1:14:19] a father amen everybody okay and then
[1:14:22] Paul say this Spirit itself which is the
[1:14:25] kingdom beareth witness with our spirit
[1:14:29] that we are what the children of God so
[1:14:32] when the spirit of the Lord comes he
[1:14:34] convict you that you are God's son Amen
[1:14:36] in other word the spirit bring the
[1:14:38] connection
[1:14:40] back the spirit of the Lord when he
[1:14:42] comes in your life he move your
[1:14:44] connection from a natural father into a
[1:14:47] spiritual father because your natural
[1:14:50] father can die your natural father I or
[1:14:53] might not be saved but if you have a
[1:14:56] relationship with your spiritual father
[1:14:59] that one you are guarantee for eternity
[1:15:01] amen amen so he move your dependency
[1:15:04] from your natural father onto your
[1:15:07] spiritual father the spirit of the Lord
[1:15:09] convict you or unfold to you or reveal
[1:15:12] to you that you are God son or god
[1:15:15] daughter everybody okay amen and he said
[1:15:18] likewise verse 26 the spirit also do
[1:15:21] what helpeth our infirmity he help our
[1:15:24] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:15:26] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:15:29] spirit itself do what maketh
[1:15:30] intercession for us with what groaning
[1:15:33] which cannot be other and he that
[1:15:35] searcheth the heart knoweth what is in
[1:15:37] the mind what is the mind of the spirit
[1:15:40] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:15:43] what Saints according to what the will
[1:15:45] of God that's why when you say th will
[1:15:47] be done the spirit of the Lord knows the
[1:15:50] will of God Amen and if the spirit of
[1:15:52] the Lord pick up the steering wheel he
[1:15:54] will take you straight to the whe of God
[1:15:56] and your prayer will be always answered
[1:15:59] amen because the spirit and God are want
[1:16:02] so the only way to have a perfect prayer
[1:16:05] answer is you got to be moved by the
[1:16:07] spirit of the Lord and you our prayer
[1:16:09] will be effective pray in the spirit it
[1:16:13] is very important amen everybody okay
[1:16:16] amen as we ding into our sermon tonight
[1:16:19] glory to God we know that prayer brother

[1:16:40] said the greatest privilege that a
[1:16:42] mortal can have is to just have the
[1:16:45] ability to close your eyes to open your
[1:16:48] heart and to talk to God Amen so if you
[1:16:52] can e a talk to God it's a greatest
[1:16:55] privilege amen so prayer should not be a
[1:16:57] burden Hallelujah prayer should be a
[1:16:59] privilege amen when they are calling you
[1:17:01] to pray you should be happy amen because
[1:17:04] they're calling you to the greatest
[1:17:05] privilege of speaking to your true

[1:17:51] doubt from our heart and let us receive
[1:17:53] what we asking and brother Bram is
[1:17:55] saying that father is addressing God as
[1:17:58] a father we know that according to
[1:18:00] brother Bram we already established just
[1:18:03] remanding you so we can fly he says God
[1:18:06] never come for just any halfhazard
[1:18:10] way amen prayer is not a
[1:18:14] perhapse prayer is what a sincere thing
[1:18:17] prayer is what talking to God prayer is
[1:18:21] not get down and do what shut your eyes
[1:18:24] and thinking about your watching or your
[1:18:26] work you are doing and say Lord help me
[1:18:30] and John and heal Mrs John and so forth

[1:18:35] repeating some
[1:18:38] words Hallelujah everybody okay amen we
[1:18:41] clear so far Amen brother Bram said but
[1:18:44] prayer is to come into a what an
[1:18:46] atmosphere where you realize that you

[1:19:26] what deepest of sincerity first you must

[1:37:56] ask no that Kingdom Come you are wishing
[1:37:59] his kingdom to come th will be done on
[1:38:01] Earth as it is in heaven did you ask no
[1:38:04] but the first time Jesus put a
[1:38:07] request he said now you already
[1:38:09] worshiped me you want the kingdom to
[1:38:12] come you want my will to be done now you

[1:38:25] anymore in other word worship has a
[1:38:27] beginning and an ending now you need to
[1:38:30] switch the button you need to switch the
[1:38:32] power you need to switch the G now you
[1:38:36] ask who are you asking your father amen
[1:38:39] and Jesus is saying whatever you
[1:38:42] everyone that ask is
[1:38:46] guaranteed should what
[1:38:50] receive
[1:38:51] amen this principle we don't use
[1:38:55] it I've been places you
[1:38:58] go they say how much is this you pay for
[1:39:03] and something come you say ask and you
[1:39:05] turn around you say can I get a discount
[1:39:08] and they then they look left and right
[1:39:10] and they give you a discount because you
[1:39:14] [Music]

[1:39:21] if you don't have that Faith fine me I
[1:39:23] have it and I seen it

[1:39:28] working I seen it working over and over
[1:39:32] when I get somewhere it's locking I say
[1:39:34] can I ask you a question and I have the
[1:39:36] answer because it's a principle you need
[1:39:39] to know who you are you're not asking
[1:39:43] because it's good to ask you asking with
[1:39:46] a background of the
[1:39:48] scripture right that's why you work

[1:40:04] guaranteed and him that knth it shall be
[1:40:08] what
[1:40:09] open so if you knock it's not open you
[1:40:12] need to go back to
[1:40:15] God because heaven and earth will pass
[1:40:18] away but his word will never pass away
[1:40:21] God it's impossible for God to
[1:40:25] lie it is impos the Bible say it's
[1:40:27] impossible for God to lie so what God
[1:40:30] Said must happen
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:34] amen I'm not venturing I'm coming upon
[1:40:37] the authority of the word you told me
[1:40:40] ask and it shall be given to you that's
[1:40:42] why I'm going to go and ask even if they
[1:40:45] already told me no when I remember the
[1:40:48] scripture I go back again amen

[1:43:58] responsibility but there is an assurance
[1:44:02] an assurance why this one must provide
[1:44:05] what the other one is looking for and
[1:44:07] Jesus now is Shing is adding now that
[1:44:10] not only is he going to provide but he
[1:44:14] cannot give something
[1:44:19] different

[1:44:24] spoken word am I reading a different
[1:44:27] Bible he cannot give something different

[1:53:53] chapter
[1:53:54] 11 teach us to
[1:53:58] pray when you begin to approach god with
[1:54:01] this understanding sir your prayer
[1:54:04] changes because at the beginning we
[1:54:07] approaching God by
[1:54:09] routine we don't even know what to ask
[1:54:12] we just doing praying because they say
[1:54:13] you need to pray but now you need to
[1:54:15] know that's why the Bible say him that
[1:54:18] comes to God must first believe that he
[1:54:21] is and he is a what
[1:54:25] rewarder so you cannot approach god
[1:54:28] without first believing he's a reward
[1:54:31] amen so you must first convince yourself
[1:54:33] that hey the one I'm going to talk to is
[1:54:36] my reward when you accept that that's
[1:54:39] when you go to pray if you have not
[1:54:41] accepted that don't pray don't pray yet
[1:54:44] because you not you know
[1:54:48] no
[1:54:52] you might as well go to
[1:54:54] sleep I can prove to you by the
[1:54:57] scripture that you're not going to
[1:54:58] receive
[1:54:59] anything by the scripture don't worry
[1:55:02] let's go my friend Luke chapter 11
[1:55:05] father help me if you thereare you can
[1:55:07] say amen
[1:55:09] amen I only read two
[1:55:12] quotes everybody okay amen you there
[1:55:15] amen jump to verse
[1:55:17] n and I say unto you do what ask and it
[1:55:22] shall be what given you seek and you
[1:55:24] shall do what find knock and it shall be
[1:55:27] what opened unto you for everyone that
[1:55:30] ask do what receive it and he that
[1:55:32] seeketh do what find it and to him that
[1:55:34] knth he shall do what open if a son
[1:55:37] shall ask for what bread again it's
[1:55:40] right there of any of you that is a
[1:55:44] father so it's a relationship between a
[1:55:47] what a son and father a father and a
[1:55:52] son if you ask you if if they ask you a
[1:55:55] bread of any of you that is a father
[1:55:58] will he give me give him a what
[1:56:02] stone or if he ask a what fish will he
[1:56:06] for a fish give him what
[1:56:08] serpent watch again we on that was verse
[1:56:11] 11 verse 12 oh if he shall ask for what
[1:56:16] an
[1:56:17] egg hallah let me ask you a question
[1:56:20] what is there that you cannot ask God
[1:56:24] now
[1:56:26] abely we move from a fish to a what
[1:56:30] bread a bread to gift gift to things now
[1:56:35] even the
[1:56:36] [Applause]
[1:56:40] egg so if one day they say there is no
[1:56:43] more don't
[1:56:48] worry
[1:56:51] H do you know what the third pool
[1:56:53] created did he create elephant he
[1:56:56] created
[1:56:58] what if he was us we would want to have
[1:57:00] an
[1:57:03] elephant in other word whatever brother
[1:57:05] Bram was looking for that's what came
[1:57:09] out now Jesus is putting what
[1:57:15] egg if they ask you for an egg amen will
[1:57:19] of a what a
[1:57:25] scorpion
[1:57:28] Scorpio is he going to harm you a
[1:57:31] serpent to kill you a scorpion to kill
[1:57:36] you Stone to do what to crush
[1:57:39] you can I continue watch verse 13 very

[1:58:03] Spirit give what Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:58:06] Spirit to who them that ask because ask
[1:58:09] and it shall be what given to you now we
[1:58:12] move from gift into the what Holy Spirit
[1:58:15] and do you know that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:58:17] gift amen am do you know that amen and
[1:58:21] you shall repent and be baptized in the
[1:58:23] name of what Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:58:26] receive the gift the Holy Ghost is a
[1:58:28] what and it's a good
[1:58:33] gift so you can ask God for a bread you
[1:58:37] can ask him for a fish you can ask him
[1:58:40] for a egg you can ask him for gifts and
[1:58:44] things and Holy Ghost

[1:59:07] and the lord gave them again the Holy
[1:59:09] Ghost brother Bram called that the
[1:59:11] refilling so even if you were filled

[1:59:16] go back again and to continue to ask for
[1:59:18] what amen refilling for a refilling of
[1:59:21] the Holy
[1:59:23] Ghost oh my God amen amen amen amen
[1:59:28] let's go to James I might have to stop

[1:59:35] running Our Father which are in heaven
[1:59:38] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:59:41] thy will be done give us this day our
[1:59:45] daily bread talking about dependency

[1:59:50] is an assurance what is the Assurance
[1:59:53] whatever we ask the father we're going
[1:59:55] to have it amen and the father will give
[1:59:58] us he won't swap it he will give us
[2:00:00] exactly what we need he won't swap it
[2:00:02] because if bad father knows how to give
[2:00:05] good gift to their children how much
[2:00:07] more god with his children because the
[2:00:11] father of the earth only reflect God in
[2:00:14] an imature
[2:00:16] way amen amen father help me let's go to
[2:00:20] James chapter 1 if you thereare you can
[2:00:22] say amen
[2:00:24] amen I wish I can even touch this Lord
[2:00:27] help
[2:00:30] me oh my five minute amen James chapter
[2:00:35] one if you there you can say amen amen

[2:00:42] every what good
[2:00:45] gift amen amen amen let me back up
[2:00:50] here watch it if you ask a what bread or

[2:00:59] many what kind of gift good gifts now
[2:01:01] watch
[2:01:03] James okay good gift good things Holy
[2:01:07] Ghost watch James verse 17 every what
[2:01:12] good
[2:01:13] gift and every what perfect gift amen
[2:01:18] hallelujah your natural father can give
[2:01:21] you good
[2:01:24] gift according to the Bible your natural
[2:01:27] father can give you good thing but here
[2:01:30] it is not only good gift but also
[2:01:34] perfect
[2:01:35] gift oh spoken
[2:01:38] word every what good and what
[2:01:43] perfect so where are we reaching who's
[2:01:47] perfect the natural can give us good
[2:01:50] things they can give us good gift now
[2:01:53] every good gift and what perfect gift
[2:01:57] perfect gift amen and perfect gift amen
[2:02:03] comes down from who the
[2:02:07] father everybody okay we talking about
[2:02:10] the father and the child look at James
[2:02:13] is not saying come from God come from
[2:02:16] the father he wants you to remember he's
[2:02:19] father that's right every good and
[2:02:21] perfect gift come from your father
[2:02:24] because when we say you're God then we
[2:02:26] have a tendency to go like this when you
[2:02:27] say my father you can go and hug
[2:02:34] him it's Jesus Christ who gave us the C
[2:02:39] the the the courage and the ability to
[2:02:41] hug God in the Old Testament you don't
[2:02:44] touch the
[2:02:45] mountain only if God is in Jesus Christ
[2:02:47] that's when even a PR can touch
[2:02:51] him amen amen amen am and he keep
[2:02:54] talking about the Father the Father the
[2:02:56] father and Philip look he say show us
[2:03:00] who the father he say Philip you don't
[2:03:02] understand when you see me who do you
[2:03:05] see the father that's why you can hug me
[2:03:07] that's why you can sleep closer to me
[2:03:10] that's why even John can put
[2:03:12] his his head right here on my chest
[2:03:16] because I'm a
[2:03:17] father
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:21] Jesus Christ he say every good gift and
[2:03:25] every perfect gift is from who above
[2:03:27] Heavenly Heavenly and comes where down
[2:03:31] from who the father of life with whom is
[2:03:33] no what varess stop let's go back here
[2:03:38] Jesus say if you ask for bread is your
[2:03:41] father going to give you what a stone
[2:03:43] does it happen no if you ask for fish
[2:03:46] are they going to give you f no did it
[2:03:48] happen if you ask for egg are they going
[2:03:50] to give you scorpion so the natural
[2:03:52] father doesn't have valuableness
[2:03:56] he doesn't
[2:04:00] change amen he says in whom there is
[2:04:04] with whom there is no what variableness
[2:04:06] neither shadow of what turning so when
[2:04:09] you come to God asking God something
[2:04:14] it's an assurance that God won't deviate
[2:04:17] from what you're talking about
[2:04:19] [Applause]
[2:04:21] because the natural father cannot
[2:04:23] deviate your evil father cannot deviate
[2:04:26] our evil father cannot deviate I'm not
[2:04:29] telling you our father are evil but evil
[2:04:31] because we were born in sin shaping
[2:04:33] iniquity coming into this word speaking
[2:04:35] life even in our bad State we have a
[2:04:39] conscience to do good things to our
[2:04:41] children amen but how much more
[2:04:44] God so when you come and you say our
[2:04:46] father give us this day our what daily
[2:04:49] bre it's a dependence of responsibility
[2:04:53] but it's lock with Assurance in other
[2:04:55] words when you approaching God you
[2:04:57] cannot think twice whether he's going to
[2:05:00] give you something or not you cannot
[2:05:02] even doubt that maybe he will say yes or
[2:05:05] no you are coming straight with a 100%
[2:05:09] confidence that whatever I'm going to
[2:05:11] ask God is going to give it to me
[2:05:14] because he is my father amen he is the
[2:05:17] good father amen he is my shepherd amen
[2:05:20] he's the one that bur me he's my
[2:05:23] [Applause]
[2:05:27] responsible amen amen amen amen oh my
[2:05:33] now if I get to this it's going to be
[2:05:35] something else we got to stop here let
[2:05:38] me see yeah I just passed one
[2:05:43] minute if I dig into this it's more
[2:05:46] extensive amen amen bear with me we're
[2:05:49] going to catch up again Our Father which
[2:05:52] are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thaty
[2:05:56] kingdom come thy will be done in heaven
[2:06:01] as it is on Earth give us this day our
[2:06:04] what Daily
[2:06:06] Bread God expect us to
[2:06:10] ask why because God is our father we are
[2:06:14] his offspring we are his children and we
[2:06:18] depend on him he understand that he
[2:06:21] expect us to ask him and when you ask
[2:06:25] him ask him as a child that is asking a
[2:06:29] father ask him knowing that he cannot
[2:06:32] give you something bad ask him knowing
[2:06:34] that he's the good God because he said
[2:06:38] no one is good but God so ask him
[2:06:40] knowing that he cannot wather ask him
[2:06:43] knowing that every good gift and every
[2:06:46] perfect gift come from him that's why
[2:06:49] I'm approaching you if my father can
[2:06:52] give me this how much more you if my
[2:06:55] father can give me something good so you
[2:06:57] can give me not only good but you can
[2:06:59] give me something that is perfect do you
[2:07:02] want a perfect health do you want a
[2:07:04] perfect marriage do you want a perfect
[2:07:06] children do you want a perfect life do
[2:07:09] you want Perfection God is the author
[2:07:12] and the finisher of your faith whatever
[2:07:14] you have need of God is able to do and
[2:07:17] he can do exed inly and abundantly above
[2:07:21] everything you can ask and see teachers
[2:07:24] how to pray God richly bless you let's
[2:07:27] stand and stop you
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:40] amen When you pray Paul say you praying
[2:07:44] with
[2:07:45] understanding now when you go to prayer
[2:07:48] you you know what you're saying you know
[2:07:50] what you're going to talk you're not
[2:07:53] just going just guessing of some
[2:07:55] invisible being that is somewhere maybe
[2:07:58] way in the sky maybe in the galaxy
[2:08:01] somewhere that I'm going to talk to and
[2:08:04] I have been talking to him sometime he
[2:08:06] works sometime he doesn't work that's
[2:08:08] not the concept that's not the mentality
[2:08:12] brother Bram say any correct mental
[2:08:16] attitude toward me mental attitude you
[2:08:19] need to have that correct mental
[2:08:22] attitude brother say toward every Divine
[2:08:25] promise will bring it to pass in other
[2:08:28] word when you approaching God you know
[2:08:30] who you're talking to if you have a
[2:08:33] difficulty believing before you pray sit
[2:08:36] down and think about what you do to your
[2:08:38] children meditate a little bit like what
[2:08:41] if my child ask me this what will be my
[2:08:45] response after you begin to meditate
[2:08:47] then when you come come and you soak
[2:08:50] that Revelation then you turn around you
[2:08:52] say this is the same thing God will do
[2:08:54] for me and he can also do more so than
[2:08:58] what me I can do because me as a man I
[2:09:00] can turn down somebody and say no you
[2:09:03] know what because you did this I'm not
[2:09:04] going to give it to you but this is a
[2:09:07] good God every perfect thing come from
[2:09:10] him from the father above amen Our Daily
[2:09:14] Bread amen our provider he carth for for
[2:09:18] you let's pray Heavenly
[2:09:22] Father Lord we approaching you again
[2:09:24] humbly
[2:09:26] tonight father once again we thank you
[2:09:30] for your grace for your love for your
[2:09:33] mercy father and for everything you have
[2:09:35] been doing for
[2:09:37] us father you say that your people
[2:09:40] perish for lack of
[2:09:43] knowledge and father you gave us the
[2:09:46] promise that in this end time
[2:09:48] with the opening of the seals there is
[2:09:51] no way your children can be living again
[2:09:54] Into Darkness but you are unfolding your
[2:09:57] word you are unfolding your will so that
[2:10:01] oh God we know
[2:10:04] plainly who you are and who you are for
[2:10:07] us
[2:10:09] Lord father now we begin to understand
[2:10:12] when the scripture says that you so
[2:10:14] loved the world that you gave your only
[2:10:17] begotten why did you give your only
[2:10:20] begotten because you were not giving
[2:10:22] that to anyone you were doing that for
[2:10:25] your children you look in our condition
[2:10:29] and you took the place that any of us
[2:10:33] could be crucify to take the shame and
[2:10:37] to Bear the cross so that Lord father
[2:10:40] your children could be satisfies and be
[2:10:43] at ease Lord father that's why Paul
[2:10:47] picking up in Roman he says if God could
[2:10:51] give us the great treasure of Heaven how
[2:10:55] much more should he give us freely all
[2:11:00] things now we understand that it's more
[2:11:03] than just
[2:11:04] bread father you can give us good things
[2:11:09] you can give us good gift you can give
[2:11:11] us perfect gift you can give us the holy
[2:11:15] spirit because everything that we have
[2:11:18] need of is in your hand Lord our
[2:11:21] strength for work our intelligence for
[2:11:23] school our help our ability to walk our
[2:11:28] ability to breathe everything that we
[2:11:30] are is coming from thee father Lord we
[2:11:34] thank you for unfolding this word to us
[2:11:37] and help us Lord father that we do not
[2:11:39] forget this but as from now on when we
[2:11:43] approach you in prayer may we realize
[2:11:45] who we talking to May we come like
[2:11:48] children father with all love all joy
[2:11:53] approaching our father just like a
[2:11:55] father who's coming from work and the
[2:11:58] kids are coming and say hi Daddy this is
[2:12:01] the way we should be talking to you this
[2:12:03] should be this is the way we should be
[2:12:05] coming to your house that's why David
[2:12:07] say I'm happy when they tell me to go
[2:12:09] into the house of the Lord because I'm
[2:12:11] going to the house of my father I should
[2:12:14] be happy because I'm going to talk to
[2:12:15] him he have something to tell me he have
