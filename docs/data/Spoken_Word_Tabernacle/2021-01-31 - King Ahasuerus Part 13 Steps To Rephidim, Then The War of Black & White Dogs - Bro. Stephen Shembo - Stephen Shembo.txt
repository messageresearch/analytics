special spoken testimony he'd like to give this morning and then i have a little bit of a praise report and i do have one prayer request come on up brother kelly absolutely good to see you man you looking sharp today telling you smoking i don't know you look good i love you brother hallelujah you may be seated i just wanted to share this appraisal everyone doing fine hey amen i just wanted to share this i know uh the pastor mentioned about the uh election or the office next month which this is the final day of january and i know my name would come up as a deacon but i just also wanted to share with you i'm a minister of the gospel that's what god called me to do first and if they do select me there as the deacon i will always do my best you're precious you're too precious and i say that humbly but you're too precious for me to halfway do anything you understand what i'm saying if i see that i cannot feel it i would go to the pastor pastor no one not even my wife knew i was going to come up here i was praying and this was on my heart and even if i can't i will come to you just like i'm coming to you now i truly love the lord but i love his word and more so i love his people because here god is doing great things you know some people i tell them i was telling them we was ministering friday and i was people say nothing's being done nothing's being done that's not true you know why you're looking at it the wrong way this is an individual walk so the elect knows what is going on so i want you to understand i will serve you i will serve you dearly but i'm called by him first okay so i just want to share those things with you and i'll do my best and all that the lord has called me to do and that's the only reason why he's been blessing me because i was i'm in his will i always want to be in his will so i appreciate you we have a great man of god that god has sent us a gift from god so i just want to share those things with you ahead of time okay because i love you dearly and i know how the enemy is see he didn't no one knew i was going to say this but god this morning i was talking to god because i know how the enemy is some of you will go the enemy will send some of you to act six is that right he was saying some of you to timothy three okay so you have to understand looking at things but the pastor has that final voice in here okay it's only one voice okay but i want to share those things with you so you can understand because that's not a a foreign position to me i say it that way some of you understand what i'm saying it's not a foreign position to me but i understand that any of the ones that's going to be selected in that that's the hardest working office in the church it's a deacon's office so we have to realize this is the church of jesus christ and the ministry is the the ministry is sent to present a glorious church a god without a spot ain't that what the lord shared us or without a wrinkle so we know that glorious body that we're going to receive but right now i want to bring because i've seen so many things in the past not done according to his will and that's how things get thrown off so if i am i will uh accept it but i will totally work in that office for god's people some things already being done only the lord and i and the pastor knows things already being done but god's always going to have his church filled in the places where they're supposed to be hear what i'm saying according to his will right and i've said it now i never told you this but i want you to trust and the lord knows is this is the supernatural church [Music] you're too precious [Applause] i think we can all agree we love brother kelly too and we i'm sure i'm sure there's nothing no reason not to have confidence in him i want to um i want to share one little um praise report um my wife didn't know i'm fixing to do it but she she she was raised with a a a lady who now lives out west you know back in panama and my wife began um witnessing to her um the lady her husband was unfaithful and everything unfortunately but she um my wife's been witnessing to her and she sees it she sees the message she sees it so much that she's witnessing she's my wife sent her some books this week and the lady that she's witnessing to says i've never seen these things in the bible before but they're right there so it's the it's the revelation testimony amen that it's a new book so continue to pray um just pray for the lady that my wife grew up with to continue i won't bring any names up because it's on youtube and everything but just continue you know like that does it and does he and listen it's we're at the end so he's he's gathering that last seat in here you know does anybody else have a praise report real quick and then i'm going to read this prayer request anybody yes ma'am who what family was it jones okay oh wow oh wow okay so remember the jones family their their youngest one uh passed this morning you said this this morning correct so let's remember them we need to we need to remember brother michael holloway he has spoken with our pastor a couple times concerning and health issue in his heart so um let's just put that on on the top burner you know he's our brother we love him we miss him you know and he needs he needs a big touch from god so let's um i mean i mean like miracle proportion so let's um let's stand and uh and let's um i want to get somebody to pray over this brother daily do you mind coming up and praying over this prayer these prayer requests and then you can lead the lead that song afterwards let's remember each other any unspoken as well i forget some time to acknowledge unspoken requests um but let's remember each other in this end time and i mean it's close we're close amen god i had a couple more testimonies we went to florida over the christmas and scripture says no weapons fashion or form against the shall prosper and um it didn't but we went to my mother who i haven't seen since february of last year and everything was okay when we left but um by the time we got there we kind of found out that that um bug came with us too so we're then it's on my heart thinking lord the thing is very contagious and i really don't want my mother to contract that and i gave it over to the lord and praise god we were there for almost a week and she didn't contract it so that's one of the most glorious thing i can give god praise for you know and um let's just put our hearts unto the lord most gracious and heavenly father we once again come boldly before thy throne of grace to obtain mercy in time of need father you say in your word that we are to repeat redeem this time for the time is short you say lord god that we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling lord god our own salvation but as we come to you lord god given these few words unto you lord we ask you that you would incline your ears unto them we want to give you a re keep you in remembrance lord of the jones family in their passing lord god but you said you would send another comforter lord god and you are not a god or a man where you will lie so lord god we ask in you lord to bring that word to pass and comfort them the memory isn't very good in in retaining the needs of the people lord but in general you say you know what we want before we would ask and even though we know not what we ought to pray your spirit lord give it utterance and groaning for us so we thank you lord for your every provision lord in our abounding and lord in our short coming lord god but as we prepare ourselves lord to receive of thee this morning the bread of life which come down from heaven once again lord coming and dwelling lord in a place which you have prepared for yourself your body your church father we're just thanking you lord that we can look into the book lord god and see our names at this time and we just want to give you all the glory power and praise for that lord god we're asking you lord god to bless the service today in a special way let the words that come forth from your servant's mouth lord god move from our ears lord and pass our brain lord into our hearts lord and may our heart be able to receive it today lord god that we may be transformed and translated lord god into that very same word bless the offerings today lord god let it go forth and do that it is appointed to do for your work here on earth we give you all glory unknown praise in jesus name amen the song i want to sing i i don't really have a great voice but i want to give god the best so since he bypassed my vocal cords gave it to my daughter i'm gonna let her help us out here i'm gonna start you are alpha [Music] and oh makeup we worship you are lord you are worthy to be praised you are alpha [Music] you are lord you are worthy to be praised who we give you the glory we worship you our lord you are to be praised we give you the glory we worship you are lord you are worthy to be brave [Music] [Music] you are worthy to be praised [Music] you lord you are worthy to be brave we give you love glory [Music] you are worthy to be praised we give you the glory we worship you are lord you are worthy to be praised hallelujah let's stand isn't that a lovely song it just creates such an atmosphere he was telling me that um they went to england is that right i went to a zimbabwe church in england and the congregation just sang it and sang it and sang and i'm sure that even just in the few minutes that we sing it the presence that you can feel here would be just so much you know if we could just sing it for half an hour could you imagine amen so let's invite our pastor up if y'all can give me a c hallelujah oh [Music] libya believe all things are possible [Music] only [Music] believe all things are possible [Music] only [Music] lord things are possible lord i believe i believe i believe all things one more time jesus is here jesus [Music] all things are [Music] possible [Music] [Laughter] uh all things are possible jesus amen somebody praise him like you believe jesus is here [Applause] amen and i believe that the rain on the outside did not affect you if you are affected by the outside world then you are living in the other court because the other court was exposed to the light of the zodiac if iran iran there if it's hot it's hard there if it's cold it's called there so regardless of what is going on outside in the world it cannot affect you amen and you cannot even be affected by the light of the second part because that light could be put out you have to be affected by the third spot which is the invisible place of god amen that was the eternal light which first timothy 16 6 say that no man can approach that's where the pillar of fire can be made visible and you can stay there and nobody can put that light out so you want to stay in that position whether it rain whether there is corona or no corona whether it's sickness or no sickness whether things are going tougher or not you're still worshiping the living god amen blessed be the name of the lord last sunday we dealt purely with prophecy so if you think there is more time in this world you're just wasting your time if you even need more time there is more time there is an overtime it is an overtime of three and a half years it's in the tribulation period you're going to stay here for three and a half years and you can fulfill your project over there but i'm not going there i'm going to meet my savior into the air amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to the scripture genesis chapter 26 sunday we were unable to even get to our subject so i'm gonna call today's sermon part 13 because that was part 13 but we dealt purely with prophecy to stabilize the church and to show you by the prophet and by the scripture where we are i don't have time to argue on the internet or to be on facebook what this preacher here say what this preacher here say that's their responsibility i give to the church what they need here to stabilize you here if somebody's heard something else that's your problem if you have a new coat you bring it to me but don't bring me pasta so and so say this this no i gave you the prophet i gave you the bible and we go by the bible says and brother branham say and that is for the local church what is going on in europe in south america in africa whatever people are saying this is not the time to argue you don't argue with prophecy prophecy is interpreted by god and there is no argument when mary is pregnant she's pregnant that's it we don't have to do dna tests [Laughter] genesis chapter 26 it's like a spirit of argument all the time you can't just take god at his word and that's it still want a reason still want to argue what else do you want what else do you want what else oh my god that's why they tell the young ruler they say if they have moses over there if they don't listen to those even if you brought somebody you bring somebody from the dead they're not gonna listen and jesus rose from the dead did they listen to jesus they were not predestinated for that rest they see and they repented and god forgive them so god intentionally locks that up genesis chapter 26 verse 17 if you dare you can say amen and isaac departed there and pitched his tent in other words he camp in the valley of gerald and dwelt there there is many things in this but i'm gonna try to stay focused with what we're dealing with verse 18 and isaac dug against the wells of of water which they have dug in the days of abraham his father for the philistine had stopped them after death after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them he didn't change the name he kept the same name he only on choke or uncovered the whales that were already choked by the philistine verse 19 an isaac servant dug in the valley now this is a separate well number one and found there a well of springing water these wells are different than the wells of abraham you might be seated the well of abraham were uncovered no problem but this is a new well that is coming up that is in the valley so when they uncovered this war happened verse 20 and the herdsmen of gear did strive in other words the struggle the quarrel it was supposed to be a well of water it turned into argument and the hurts man of gear did strive with isaac's herdman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well issec which brother branham interpreted as malice because they strove with him he also speak about contention verse 21 and they dug another well and strove for that also so the second world again trouble you taught you sitting here it's peace you get into a fight you move to another you get into a fight again amen and he called the name of it cigna and citna means strath but i'm going to draw your attention to the third well that was number one number two number three verse 22 and he will remove from there and dug another well and for that they strove not in other words the third world have no trouble there was no fighting no quailing no arguing on facebook no arguing on what's up there's no argument with that well amen he said and he called the name of faith riobof that's the third one and he say for now the lord has made room for us in other words there is room for everybody here amen it is not something we have to struggle to quell there is room for everybody anybody that want to come drink there is room for it that's real above amen there is room for all of us and we shall be fruitful in the land so the third world which is the real above well was the world not only that i have room for everybody but it's a world that can make you fruitful do you see that let me read it over again he said and he removed from there and dug another well and for that they strive not number one there is no discussion there is no argument there is no reasoning there is no uh contention there nothing once you reach real about there is no trouble once you reach robot that's the true rest amen if you're in sydney you will be fighting make sense if you in insect you're going to struggle you cannot stay in issec you cannot stay in sydney you need to go all the way to rio both when you reach to rio above there is no more battle there is no more struggle there is no more contention there is room for everybody and not only that you begin to produce fruit amen and he called the name of it real above and he said for now the lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land so in the first world no fruit second no fruit the third one that's where you can begin to produce fruit because you will gain life over there amen not in the first part not in the second part but you get life into the third one when they took the road of aaron aaron on the first part no life second no lies but on the third part that's where the road that was dry the dry stick battered and brought forth what fruit and by the fruit we could identify that it was an almond at the beginning we didn't know where he came from we didn't know where he came from an oak tree or an apple tree but by the third part you can identify by the fruit exodus chapter 16 blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah you need to keep your bible with you exodus chapter 16 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came to the wilderness of sin we are there that's what we're dealing with which is between ellen and sana so right here the wilderness of sin which we talk about is a wilderness that is between elim and sana so somehow when you begin to move down sana is around it and we know that sana is another name for horrible we already proved to you that under in the bible sana of on the 15th day of the second month after the departing out of the land of what egypt so when you reach the wilderness of sin you are not in horrible yet you are not in monsanto yet but you just getting into the direction let's go to chapter 17. this is where we weigh and we're picking up now and all the congregation of israel verse 1 of the children of israel journey from the wilderness of sin now we started our part there from the wilderness of sin after their journey according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in what referred them and there was no order for the people to drink so now we're going from the wilderness all the way to refer them but in referendum there is no water how can god lead you to a place where there is no water amen let's jump to verse five and the lord said to moses go on before the people and take with you or the la the elders of israel because it's a work of redemption and your road we're going to see it where would you smote the river the road of judgment the road of death take in your hand and go behold i will stand before you there upon the rock in water so this rock is a little bit further from referendum are you following me they camp here no word he told moses go outside the temple [Music] go beyond the camper make sense now you need to be listening to your prophet go beyond the camp when you move a little bit beyond there is a place called horeb or sana in that place there is a rock but when you struck this rock the water will be flowing all the way to the camp you strike it outside but it brings water into the camp the bible become a new book amen behold i will stand before you there upon a rock in the horeb and you shall smite the rock the judgment that you were supposed to strike israel because they are murmuring turn around and strike the rock amen you shall smack the rock and they shall come water out of it where was that water oh maybe it's a big mountain so water was inside there so you smite you pull the water out but do you know that walk down that road rock was walking yes i'm gonna show you in the scripture when israel moved the rock also moved when israel stopped the rock stop is the hell begin to move the rock is following israel what kind of rock is that one [Laughter] i'm gonna show you that in the bible so you don't say pastor c i don't like that amen and you shall smite the rock and they shall come water out of it and the people may drink he took only the elder outside here when the struck the water goes into rephidim amen praise the name of the lord and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel he took the elders out in horeb for the work of redemption and from there came water flowing all the way to the camp and the people begin to drink let's go to verse eight then came amalek and fought with israel in referendum amalek came after the rock you must drink the water from the rock first then amalek come he didn't come before there is a reason why first 9 and moses said to joshua now moses is committing that to joshua when he was in horeb it is moses when it's fighting amalek it is no more moses moses take his hand off he said joshua now it's your turn amen but joshua was under moses as i was with so shall be with verse 9 and moses said to joshua choose us out man go out and go out fight with family tomorrow i will stand on the top of the wheel hill with the road of god in my hand you know the story already we read this many times at home let's go to hebrew hebrew chapter 13 then we're going to pray hebrew 13 you need to keep your bible hebrew 13 verse 11 if you dare you can say amen praise god for the bodies of those beasts speaking about the old testament sacrifice whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned outside the camp so the atonement paul is saying was not burned in the camp the priest was taking the sacrifice outside the camp and kill it outside the camp then he take the blood and come with the blood back into the camp but the work of the killing the slaying of the lamb was outside the camp outside the camper he was in horrible not in referendum make sense now verse 12 wherefore who you need to wake up i hope you're not affected by the weather you can be sleeping in this morning and well for who jesus also just like the sacrifice were killed on the outside jesus also that he must sanctify the people with his own blood suffered outside the water so he went outside the gate and suffered there somebody killed him somebody smite him amen but he have to be outside the camp everybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord once again we give you grace we thank you for your grace for your mercy and for everything lord you are doing for us father not even giving but we're expecting that grace from you lord father we thank you for giving us an opportunity to gather together this morning around the revealed word of the hour lord may you move me again completely out of the way may you speak to your children may the holy spirit come this morning lord and minister to your children may the devil and his old camp be completely sealed out of this place but may only the holy spirit lord be shut in with your children lord minister and bring life lord and rescue somebody this morning we committed all unto the hand lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you just like i said last week we dealt purely with prophecy so i'm recalling this part 13 which were supposed to be 14. everybody clear we explain you the prophecy and gave you what is happening into the world so you can wake up and know where we are according to the clock of god you know how to prepare yourself because one of this day we don't know whether it's six months whether it's going to be three months whether it's a year or a year and a half somehow the lord is coming back amen brother branham say i want this tabernacle now that you are on your feet i want you to keep pressing toward the mark of a high calling whatever you do cling together whatever you do in this church claim together if you don't see your brother or your sister coming to church pick up a phone give them a call know what is going on amen if you have a chance you're going to walmart and somebody is not scared about coronavirus give them a call you say are you at home jump there and check your brother check your sister clean together you cannot be here not seeing somebody three months and you're good and you let it to the deacon or to the pastor we are in this together we need to clean one with another support one with another praying one for another amen brother vanam said clean together be as cleanish as you can be so we want this church to be a class claimish as you can be if you touch my brother you touch me if you touch my sister you touch me if you're dealing with my brother i'm going to get there because they are my family they are part of her clan oh brother stephen so we don't want to talk to another church that's not what i'm saying brother branham said be as cleanish as you can be but always with an arm out in other words i'm holding my brother in spoken word tabernacle but my arm is also outside if somebody need help amen to reach out and get someone else to bring them in always keep that arm out but remember this is the one you need to stand for [Applause] amen but in this faith it says that we are now preaching and earnestly contending for don't you move one and from it don't you move one end from the message hallelujah four if you believe me to be his servant how many people believe brother branham to be a servant how many people believe brother branham to be a true prophet amen if you believe me to be his servant this is the problem of god the message is god's program for today you want a different program fine meet you after tribulation not in the millennium after the millennium when i'm gonna judge you with jesus christ then we see if you are good to me and then you're gonna get that way amen it shall never be in the majority that's why people begin to depart because the numbers need to come down never to be in a majority too many people it shall always be in the minority always has and always will be but remember it is written fear not regardless of what we show you on the prophecy feel not little flock not big flock it is your father's goodwill to give to you the kingdom everybody clear so far now we started with our story this morning picking up back last time and we found out that when we when the bible says that israel's journey from the wilderness of sin all the way to referendum it was not actually going from one place straight to another one because according to number 33 verse 12 and 14 the bible says that and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin which we are right here amen if you read according to exodus it seems like you're going from deal all the way there and that's it but you need god give more information to help you understand and receive it so they move from that wilderness of sin and in camp into dhafka which is right there and they deported from davka and in camp into alaska which is ready and they removed from alice and in camp at what refered him so before referendum there were two other stations that israel journey and in referendum the same thing there was no order for the people to drink now when we are talking about israel brother branham said i believe that all of the all things was a type of the new to come what israel was in the natural we are in the spiritual god is leading israel naturally what was what he is doing for us spiritually today so when you look at israel naturally in the bible you need to convert that in your spiritual work to see what your what god is doing in your life because israel is god's redemptive name everybody clear so far now when we talk about the wilderness of sin usually when we mention sin we usually refer to somebody who is approximated somebody who's a drug addict somebody who is drinking somebody who's smoking somebody who goes to the night club and all those kind of stuff because we are dealing with the second banquet of esther we're just preparing you so we can enter there the first banquet we already seen that it was the outpouring of the holy spirit on azusa street but iron man was comfortable we don't want that we don't want the devil comfortable in our life we want the devil to be in trouble then you know that you're going on the right path everybody clear now when we look at sin usually we look at somebody who's a sinner somebody who put his paint down somebody who probably smoking or walking naked on the street all kinds of stuff which is true the bible says in 1st peter chapter 4 verse 1 that for as much then as christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh has ceased from his sin everybody clear that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god in other words that person is already changed he's no longer living for himself now he's living for the will of god everybody clear now paul is saying here peter is saying here that for the time passed off her life us to have wrote in the will of the gentile in other words in our old life in our past life we lived like hidden we were sinners we were doing things that were not right when we walk in lasciviousness in lust in excess of one drinkers amen on downtown all the time in the night reveling we were doing what banqueting this banquet is not the banquet of esther this is a banquet of sin amen you were born quitting or you were sinning feasting with the world amen and abominable idolatries so it is true when we talk about sin we refer to somebody who is living an unclean life who's living a promiscuous life maybe a prostitute maybe running around with different women and all kinds of stuff that's what we refer to but i'm gonna zero in something a little bit different to blend in with what brother tim cross was preaching amen there was a man by the name of paul here we see paul was given a letter by the high priest and we want to check a little bit who is paul we're trying to understand what is sin amen take acts chapter 22. if we approach it with a sunday school that's fine acts 22 you need your bible if you dare you can say amen we're talking about a man called paul amen let's check paul and see because when they say the wilderness of sin brother stephen i'm not sinning anymore i don't drink i never prostitute my life i'm now going to the nightclub i'm not playing around i'm not smoking i was born in a message i was grown in a message so you're not a sinner paul acts 22 if you dare you can say amen verse five as also the high priest does bear me witness this is paul speaking and all the estate of the elders so the entire council knows paul paul didn't say that the dj the nightclub knows me that's what he is this is not what he's saying he's saying that if you check my friend they are always religious people amen praise the name of the lord from whom also i receive letters it's right there in the picture i received letters to the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound to jerusalem for to be punished everybody clear go back to verse three i am verily a man which was what so paul was a jew he was not a gentile thank you let's go born in texas a city of cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of who gemelia you remember when we talked about the keynote gamelia was a very very good man brought up under gamaliel he didn't say my father was a drunker that's not what paul said usually we say my mom was a jungle my my father did this my uncle did this i came up with a family we didn't know god now we are talking about a different perspective this man is born a jew grown up correctly amen come on and taught according to what the perfect manner of the law of our so they taught him right according to the word can this man be a sinner no no brother stephen no you remember the young ruler you remember him he came to jesus jesus said you need to know what the lord said he said i did it i think these are the this are the these are the these i did this and jesus liked him he ended up in hell amen and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the father and was zealous toward the nightclub [Music] you see when they said go to church he's going to church he's helping in the instrument he's playing the piano he grew up in the church environment he grew up in the message i need to prepare you so we can leave this world was zealous toward god as you all are this day and are persecuted this way to death binding and delivering in prison both men and women everybody clear job to verse 19 and i say lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believe on you and when the blood of the martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting to his death and kept the remnant of them that slew him he grew up in the message but his life was a father fighting thinking the other man is wrong let's go to chapter 23 if you dare you can say amen verse six but one who paul everybody clear when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisee he cried out in the council man and brethren i am a dj at the nightclub i am a smoker i am a pharisee the son of her i was born in a message and my father also believed the message amen i am a pharisee a son of a pharisee of the hope of resurrection of the dead and my call in what question job to verse 8 for the sadducees says that there is no resurrection that is their doctrine amen neither angel no spirit but the pharisee confessed buff so paul was a pharisee child of a pharisee child of a preacher born in a preacher taught by a good teacher amen let's go to chapter 26 we're looking at paul we talked about the sin of lasciviousness and this and this but this man was not there amen praise the name of the lord chapter 26 paul says my manner of life from my youth which was at first among my own nation at jerusalem not all the jews in other words you know me you know my reputation what was that reputation paul verse five which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after they must what street set very legalistic straight to the point after the most strict state of our religion i leave a pharisee everybody clear still a good man let's go to galatians chapter one we're going to take couple then we move on to referendum everybody there galatians chapter 1 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen page is still turning anybody there you can review these at home for you have heard of my conversation in my word my way of life paul in time pastor in the jews religion it was a religion it was not a life anybody clear how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it watch verse 14 and profited in the jewish religion above many my what is in other words according to the young people of my age i was better than all of them i was a very good young man above many my equal in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of my father so you were in the way born into it but he was no more zealous toward god he was more zealous about the tradition the doctrine of the message he was more of a father amen anybody clear go to philippians 3 then we're going to go straight home for paul anybody there this man is zealous there is a youth camp there he's there he doesn't miss any he's there oh he's a lovely brother he's been in the message for so long i believe he can be a good husband amen philippians 3 verse 4. if you there you can say amen do a man also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinks that he has well whereof he might trust in the flesh and more in other words if you think that you can boast about religion meepo i can give you more credit than that amen what are those credits there verse five circumcised on the earth day i did it of the stock of israel i can give you my curriculum vitae i know preacher so-and-so and no preacher so and so when they built the church i was there actually i was the one pulling the concrete amen circumcised the earth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin to be more specific a hebrew of the hebrews oh my god i am a message believer i was touching the lawyer pharisee oh my god concerning zeal persecuting the church watch this touching the righteousness which is in the law i was what so you cannot point a finger in the life of paul paul look perfect blameless in other words when you take the law you put you check long dress all the way here is it flowing garment yes did you show her cleavage no she's covered all the way here oh no makeup or check oh oh no hearing check [Applause] when we say wilderness of sin you can say amen because you're looking at the prostitute i'm not looking at prostituted now i'm looking at you especially those that are born in the message amen first timothy chapter one paul blameless looking good he knows all the doctrine he can sit and argue zealous about the tradition of the preacher it depends on which camp he is whether he is in a return ministry camp or jesus camp or this camp or what camp it depends on which camp he is whether does that reward the message a little bit depending on the camp whether you want frank kemp first timothy chapter one verse nine are you there knowing this that the law is not made for the righteous man but for the loneliness paul said he was blameless so paul didn't do this but stephen had never done this and disobedient oh i always listen to mom and dad even though you sneaking amen for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murder and ever kill somebody for murder of fathers no i never killed my dad and murderers of mother i never killed my mom for men slayer i never shoot somebody for whole monger i was never a prostitute i'm virgin for them that defiled themselves with mankind in other words homosexual had never done it for men stealers i never did it for liars i'm always true for perjured person gnomed me and if er if there be any other things that is contrary to what sound doctrine but paul was what blameless let's see paul according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust this is paul verse 1 told you it's paul and i thank christ jesus our lord who has enabled me that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry also maybe paul when jesus look his life he looks good good good good jesus said this one can preach the gospel not the other one not moses that kills someone amen verse 13 who was before air blaspheme i thought he was blameless okay and a persecutor persecuted not according to the law according to the new way amen and injurious they're just a bunch of idiots they don't understand amen but i obtain what mercy because i did it what ignorantly in what oh my god how can somebody be blameless like paul and he was living under unbelief and sin means what so you can be born in a message coming in the message church mom and dad in the message and you still living on the unbelief you are still under the wilderness of sin we are zeroing differently job now to verse 14 and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus watch verse 15. this is a faithful saying and worthy of our acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save who sinners camera or semicolon of whom i am what so paul was not only a sinner he was a chief sinner a yet he never been in a nightclub yet he never drunk yet he always wear long dresses but a chief sinner hallelujah so when we talk about sin leave the prostitute out they're not here to begin with they are unbelievers but look at a religious man who was blameless according to the legalistic standpoint yet the top sinner that's why he was fighting that's why he was zealous to please the father amen let's look at this pharisee take matthew 12 and i'm gonna go everybody clear hallelujah let me shoot that devil out of your life so you can be free and when they tell you jesus is coming you not shaking when they tell you jesus is coming you should be happy you should be like hallelujah because the spirit and the bread say jesus is coming what about my project i am not married yet maybe jesus can wait till i get married then he comes i have not bought my house yet i have a project i have not finished my school you are like paul matthew chapter 12 verse 24 hallelujah but when the pharisee heard it they say this fellow does not cast out devils by the elizabeth the prince of the devil but by beelzebub verse 25 and jesus knew their thought and say unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall he how shall then his kingdom stand watch verse 27 and if i jesus by beerus a book the prince of demon cast out devils these are the by whom do your children do what so the pharisees were also casting devils this is where preachers miss it they think because they have a ministry they have the holy ghost gift and calling or without repentance you can cast that devil and be a judas and when the people approach your life it is contrary to the message and yet many preachers in the message and you get along them you are shocked you say is this ministering acting like this pharisee casting out devils are not only christian caster devils are you there hallelujah let's go to chapter 23 of matthew the wilderness of sin if you are still in that wilderness if that is your condition i'm gonna give you steps you know they come out from there amen 23 matthew if you dare you can say amen we're talking about the pharisees they were casting out devils verse 2 saying the scrub and who the pharisees sit in water they know the message very well hallelujah i am shaking you off from where you are because paul said examine yourself whether you are in the faith [Music] not because you're coming to church you're going into the rapture you might be in the church but you are a sinner verse 3 all therefore whatsoever they beat you observe because they are preaching from the message of brother branham take what they give you as long as it comes from the message do it because it's still the word but one thing that observe and do but do not do do not you after their what for they say and they do so when you look at their life is different than their sermon they can tell you they believe brother branham but they don't actually believe brother branham take what they preach but don't follow their life because this has been a hindrance in the message you're telling a young man what you're doing is wrong preacher so and so he's doing that sister so-and-so is doing that preacher pastor so and so he's doing that that is not your example follow me as i follow christ brother branham pointed you to christ [Applause] you heard so many bad stories about preachers and you took that to cover yourself oh i saw the deacon wife wearing a dress here so i think i can wear a dress here are you there i saw they trust his wife having a tight dress follow what they tell you but not follow their life because there is a discrepancy between their life and their sermon don't give me excuse of preachers you are not responsible for preacher's life you are not responsible for the pastor's wife it is between you and the lord [Applause] [Music] amen job to first hallelujah i'm on 23 to two job to verse father the pharisee but all their what they do for to be what everything they do is for a show it is a custom question the humility is for people to see them amen but truly they are not humble bad the hell they would be rob the first in a different direction and you're going to see whether they humble amen hallelujah take matthew 16. go back to chapter 16. we on 23. i need to drop something here 16 verse 12. i can't go faster with this we got a chip chip chip chip then when we say the holy spirit come down he comes because he doesn't come there is many things hidden there you are looking at your own righteousness which is the righteousness of the law which is the righteousness you built yourself we always wear dresses you have not understood yet you need to know why are you wearing a dress why are you not wearing paint that's the reason why people they leave the message as soon as they leave the message they repent they thought pence means brother branham that's what they thought they thought paint means water branham so when they take body brand amount when they take by the brand of mouth earrings when they take brother brother on lipstick [Music] miss the mark in the church for years matthew 16 verse 12 hallelujah if you dare you can say amen they understood not then understood not they how that he beat them not be aware in other words he was not telling them be aware of the leaven of bread jesus told his disciple be aware of the leaven of the pharisee and the disciples say oh eleven oh so the pharisees have eleven so maybe in their kitchen they have a different level and when jesus talked he said that is not what i was saying i was not telling you about the leaven they put in bread to eat this is what it means here then understood there how that he bid them not be aware of the leaven of bread i was not talking about the natural level but of the water doctrine of their pharisee and their sadducees so the doctrine of the pharisee is 11. amen what is that doctrine go to luke chapter 12. i'm almost going to take off go to luke chapter 12. keep your bible amen in the church we give preeminence to the word amen luke chapter 12 are you there verse 1. pages are still flipping everybody there okay in the mean time when they were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people in so much that they trample one upon another he began to say to his disciples first of all be aware of the leaven of who karma which is what see now you see now so the entire way the fruit that is coming for the ministry it is bringing people to be just hypocrite just to please one another but in the heart they are struggling are you there but these were pharisees casting out devils sitting in moses sin brother stephen you talking about sinners are they sinners really take now john 8 then we take off let's see if the pharisee were sinners paul was not even a sinner he was a chief one amen if you're sleepy you can stand up there i can see everybody so i don't want to call you up john 8 say he embarrassed me i won't come back john 8 verse 13. you there you can say amen the pharisee therefore said to him you bear record of yourself your record is not true we're talking about pharisees jump to verse 23 and he said to them who are those them pharisees you are from what oh i thought somebody who come from hell will go straight to the nightclub i thought somebody who comes for help from hell will automatically manifest the devil they came from hell this is not me this is jesus but they went to the church and they become preachers from hell it is not only the pope amen you are from medieval i am from what above you are of this water the last of the eyes the lust of the flesh the proud of life amen i am not of this world i say therefore to you pharisee that you should die in your thought there were religious people casting out devils you see now in your sin for if you do what believe not unbelief that i am he you shall die in what in other words these religious people jesus is telling them you must be born again when nicodemus came jesus look at him he said as righteous as you are you must be born again in other words you are not born yet with all the righteousness that you have paul you are not born yet with all the theology that you know you are still a sinner everybody clear everybody clear so what is a pharisee brother branham oh my this pharisee must have some kind of a motive behind this what is a pharisee what does the word pharisee mean because paul was a pharisee and we found many pharisees here we don't use that word very often in kentucky in north carolina what does the word pharisee mean in the greek it means actor a costume christian your christianity is like you playing a drama you do it to please the audience but you are not what you actually playing on the scene it is just a costume it is an actor somebody who acts you are not you and the customer not one the wool that you have is not because you are a sheep oh i hate that somebody acting trying to put on i disperse such things many times people are trying to act like the other fellow listen you quit trying to act like the next fellow and just act out your own conviction and you get along better be yourself that's right that picture on facebook is not you that picture was airbrush that picture was brighten up and the day the young man will see you face to face it's not the woman he fell in love on facebook hallelujah but a pharisee i'm trying to help you up because in marriage they're gonna see you as you are if you didn't have long hair they're gonna see it in the marriage i'm an actor some sisters do the same thing got a lot of acting about them or they shall cut their husband nose off john why did you do that just snapping like a crocodile as they can be oh my god deliver me from ever calling on you if that is the kind of spirit you have amen but let someone talk on the phone in other words they can argue with the husband when the phone rings hello how are you doing oh lovely i miss you hallelujah but let someone talk on the phone oh how do you do oh how do you do i'm so glad that you called actors shame on you house angels road what on the highway holding

morning nobody could get along with you you pharisee what good does it do to go to church they need the air you need to live here they need the conversion that is what you need take the thing out the

don't want you to be an actor he wants you to be partaker of his work let it do that look for rest in your life and let the holy spirit be the one working in your life [Applause] hallelujah come lord

hard-headed if you don't want to listen you are still living in sin if you born in a message and you acting like paul you are still living in sin if you have pharisees you are still living in sin amen god have a different work for you you move from the wilderness of sin to doveka and we taught judaska is when god is knocking in your heart telling you come unto me you fought this battle alone you manufacture your holiness you stay in the message church for so long it becomes a social part for you you go there to meet friend to your friend that's all you do you take it as another religion i'm

buckle up now let's take off david says that as the heart planted after the water broke so plenty of my water are you there we talk about the inner man and the outside man amen the inner man is the soul and we have enough sad man david is saying that just as this animal planted after the water my soul is also thirsty how can a soul thirst what kind of water do you put to your soul do you do a heart surgery and put water amen my soul painteth after thee oh god my soul touches for god for what kind of god believing god amen you were born in the message but god never talked to you are you

judah my soul again justice for this and my word so not only is the soul testing but the flesh of david also is crying for the living god hallelujah in other words david is thirsting for a full redemption [Music] are you there that's why paul said glorify god also in your body hallelujah my soul thirsts for thee my flesh longed for thee in a dry and thirsty land where what you are in touch you reach referendum you reach referendum 84 my soul longeth and fainted for the court of the lord my heart which is the occupancy of the soul and my flesh cry out to the living god the two of them are crying for redemption why are they crying because they are not right with god and this one is not right with god are you there let me get the other one hallelujah psalm 146 my soul justice after thee as a what thirsty land a land that is dry no rain and that land is calling for the rain amen if the soil is testing where is the solution refrigerant means a what rests or resting places if you notice refrigerant doesn't mean west singular it is rest plural it is resting places in other words in referendum there is room you gather there is many places of rest there is plenty of room of rest in residence it is a rest place on the highway when you drove you tired exit refer them are you there it is a place where there is room for everybody it is not a race for one person it is a rest for the preacher a rest for the sister arrest for the brother and race for the young man and rest for the deacon arrests for everybody now i mean well for them where is the rest i am testing i'm testing for water where is the water amen hallelujah brother branham said i think about your different separation jacob had a fear a very clear top of that he died going well and the philistine run him away he called it malice they dug an outer well and the philistine run him away he called it strath he dug an underwear and there is room for us all we enrich them everybody come and do what that is what it is tonight room room yes there is room there is room at the fountain for every person in here every what my soul thirsted everybody clear there is rumor defending every sick and afflicted there is room at the fountain amen and so god dug a well in the lutheran church brother branham is talking about the three worlds and they run all the rest of them away from it the lutheran then he dug a well in the methodist church the wealth of jacob under sanctification luther was justification then sanctification he dug away and now they run all away from it now he is dug another whale he ain't got no name no there is no denomination it is just the good pure word and there is room for what the promise is unto you to your children and as many as the lord your god work everybody there so where is that water show me where it is come unto me who's talking so if you need water the water is in christ come unto me all he that did what like paul like pharisee like the banqueting of uncleanness and i have 11 many souvenirs many scars many disappointment in the message and i will give you what so do we take bag our car and everything and go where jesus is and give it to him take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lonely in heart and you shall find what unto you so the rest christ was talking about come unto me i'm gonna give you rest it was a specific rest for the soul but david said not only my soul but my body also is thirsting after thee are you following me now take hebrew chapter three you remember i gave you this in the reading amen blessed be the name of the lord hebrew chapter 3 verse 7 if you dare you can say amen are you there still looking verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost says today if you will hear his voice heart and not your heart as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the what when your father tempted me prove me and saw my work 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation that was baptized under moses and said they do always air in their what and they have not known my ways i saw in my wrath they shall not enter into ma so there was a rest somewhere are you there i said be the name of the lord job to verse 30 12. take his brethren lest there be in any of you any of you in this church an evil heart of what paul unbeliever pharisee and believer the sinner on the street unbelievers you just unbeliever under a costume be careful that your evil heart of unbelief in departing from what that's why when something happened people are departing from the message amen we have costumed christians that were sitting in the message amen and when an opportunity opened up they just leave the message because all this time they were like paul are you there job to verse 16. some for some when they have heard did provoke however not all that came out of egypt by moses hallelujah but with whom was he grieved for years was he not with them that had seen whose carcasses fell in the wilderness watch and to whom so he that they should not enter into what his rest but to them that did what believe not unbelief verse 19 so we see that they could not enter in because of what unbelief is the deadly devil that is gonna block you from entering in your rest the rest i'm talking about is a place where christianity is no more work christianity becomes a life you can't help to be a woman because you're just a woman it is the girl that tried to be like this because he was not like that and when he remember i need to walk like a woman because he is forcing me are you there we don't want you to force christianity we want you to put your car in neutral we want you to reach a place where that desire to do wrong is no longer there let's go to chapter four verse one let us therefore feel less the promise being left of us of entering into what his rest any of you should seem to come short of it we don't want anybody to miss this for to us was the work gospel what so israel they preach the gospel just like i'm preaching to you history repeat itself do you remember that sunday don't be an example in the new testament of going to hell are you there for to us was the gospel preached as well as to them but the word preached the message they preached to them did not profit them no being mixed with what in them that did what so they were hearing the word intellectually there's no revelation there is no faith job to verse 9 they remain therefore uh rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his what he has also ceased from his own so once you enter into this rest automatically your car is defaulting neutral are you there once you reach this place automatically somebody take off in your life [Music] are you there you are saved from your own work as god did from work you reach the place god was wake up amen verse 11 let us label therefore to enter into the rest lest any men fall after the same example of what the unbelief that was in the pharisee the unbelief that was in paul don't fall in that example be desperate you say god i need to enter into this rest are you there moses went in front of god and begged god and god said go into horrible go beyond the camp go outside the camp amen because that's where the sacrifice is killed go today and i'm gonna give water to israel amen moses went and stood and struck the rock and water came what kind of water is this and what kind of rock is this first corinthians chapter 10 and did all drink the same word are you there so the water that came here was a spiritual water are you following me now i'm giving you the bible amen for the drunk of that what so that rock was a spiritual rock and he brought forth spiritual water amen that spiritual rock daddy dwight that's the reason why the rock could walk are you there so when they say rock it is not a stone that rock was a spiritual rock that walk was a living rock it was a rock that was breathing amen and that rock was who [Applause] when you read the old testament you think it was a strong no paul now is telling you when they told them go to horeb he was beyond the temple jesus was outside the camp he was ready to be killed are you there that they say go ahead and strike the judgment on him and from his judgment will come what water and that their water if you drink it it puts you into rest are you there the order what it is brother branham in order to get these people to some order after they got over there in refugee this dry place was made a what are you following me beyond outside jerusalem and there god told moses he say take the road and the elders and go forth and i will stand on the rock before you and this rock was what did brother branham give you a scripture did you see the scripture where it came from the prophet is always zeroing with the bible are you there and moses with the road that he had brought judgment upon the nation of israel took this same road and smote the judgment of god upon the earth see he took the sins of the people onto this road which he should have smoked the people instead of smiting the people he smoked there and the rock through the work of god brought what brought what to a perishing he brought to a dying and that is what god did by taking his wand of judgment road and winding my sins and your sins around this road when it should have struck us but it struck cross that from him came forth what which means what are you understanding now so the rest we are talking about is the holy ghost paul paul why do you persecuted me ananias go lay hand on him so that he can receive the holy ghost when he did he changed camp automatically and then when he did amalek pull a sword you understand and they begin to chase after paul they are malacate that were quiet turn around against paul after the holy ghost enter are you there which means spirit the holy spirit came from from him to give us what life now we have eternal life that's why isaiah 53 said he was stricken by god he was smitten the chastisement of your peace the punishment that bring you peace was upon him are you there so now we understand that in horeb water came from christ dying on cavalry for you it is expedient for me to go and the comforter will i don't want you to go leave yourself again that's what happened in the old testament and they could not live my life are you there i'm going to orb i'm going to do the work of redemption and from there water is coming for the whole camp and then rest was found in referendum the rest of rephrasing comes from the water from the rock are you there so that water brother branham say he typified the holy ghost take isaiah 55 i hope you're not tired let's go to isaiah 55 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord isaiah 55 verse 1 if you dare you can say amen remember david

heart not your head are you there because you were laboring in your head and put the power of the holy spirit in there start pulling it don't crush you and yet we lay in the ditch because we can't pay

build to it he heals the headache takes away all your sorrows he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was of him and if we strength we were it is all free are you there in isaiah 55 god is saying you don't have to pay for it i am the one that took the blow that's why moses brought the rock on me i took your place to produce water don't work for

answered and said to her was so drink of this water shall water this is what you are doing all this time you were coming to this well you were drinking this water and it was not satisfying you you were carrying water so you can give it to your boyfriend to take a shower you were the one paying the bills of your boyfriend you even took your paycheck and put it in his direct deposit account a boyfriend because you love him so much and one of this day he's gonna turn his back on you amen and before you get married you got to confess to your husband what you did with him are you there laboring laboring laboring laboring laboring laboring verse 13 who so drink of this water shall not work but who so drink the water that i shall give him shall never touch but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of what water sprinking up into water so when you drink the water of resident you yourself you become a wall of water are you there now when the champion munich needs the holy ghost god say who's on the dispatch philip take care of it amen when cornelius need the holy ghost god say who's there peter go there while peter yet spread this word the holy ghost are you there who's over there it's paul a sinner he needs the holy ghost he's praying who's over there ananias ananias go to paul lord i cannot go he's the one that killed the christian ah he's a vessel god there when ananias pray [Applause] are you there let me finish by this let's go to john chapter 7. we are moving you from the first banquet into the second banquet are you there are you there john 7 37 are you there 37 in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cry and say if any man do what who is testing it if any man touch let him come unto me and do what if you are in a refugee and you testing it is normal i knew there is no other but come unto me i have water are you there verse 38 he that believes on me as the scripture have said out of his what daily shall flow what reverse of living what day but this is spock this sparky off there which they that belief on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet what the sure mercies of david are you following me the water of rephidim will give you rest to your soul the water of refugee is a water that will help you stop living the christian life out of your own ability amen the world of refugees is your sabbath the holy ghost is our the bible say come unto me or ye that label and heavy laden i will give you sabbath for your soul not a day you that keep a day i'm afraid of you that's right the remain of air rest hebrew four we read to the people of god a sabbath keeping for we which have entered into this rest have seized from our own as god did for what am i saying the first part god is dealing with in your life is to bring redemption to your soul redemption to your inner man redemption to your soul so that you can stop working so that you don't live a christian life out of your own ability so that christianity is not a burden for you also that christianity is not a prisoner like you hear people we were in the prison in the message when we were in the message we were in the prison we were in the court the reason why they felt like that because they never drunk from refuge because their soul was still struggling if it's a prison in the message when you left the message which well did you go to jesus and after you drunk from that well what kind of life are you having now a world that you drunk and became a prostitute with men a world that you drunk and begin to make you wear a tight paint what kind of well was that the solution was not to leave reference the solution was to find where is the rock in referendum where is the god of the message are you there are you there and when that water was given and israel took the water and drunk off the water and when israel sat down and said thank you jesus now we can sit and rest amalek rosa that's right and i'm going to finish with this why did malek rose up how many here how many red back in deuteronomy 1 where the spies went right in there and tested off the things from canada which cannon is not a top of the millennium how many knows that you mean just one hand juni that's right cannon is not the top of the millennium because they had woe are you there fightings killing and everything else in canada cut that tap cannon is the top of the water so when you receive the holy ghost you enter the war zone [Applause] [Music] it is a rest to your soul but is entering in in the world zone that's why as soon as they drank the [Music] because the last amalekite is in the book of esther that's where they lost the malachi today amen amen hallelujah egypt is the world that they came out of it the wilderness is where they were sanctified called our church canon is where they were settled down with their holy ghost because they still had what if you don't believe you have woe just get there once you drink from rough edema expect amalek to rose because you become a threat for amalek because you become a threat to a man a man is no longer quiet because what you just done the experience you have just partook certain senses that i need to wake up amen that is where you are are you there and when you remember brother branham spoke about the indian chief can you give me two minutes the indian chief said this somebody told me he had one time was converted received [Music] as he said to him how are you getting along i received the holy spirit so i'm going to be restful yes you're not walking anymore when you're trying to wake up in the morning to pray we like [Music] but suddenly you're sleeping you'll see your eyes and you say yeah it's you want me to pray nobody tells you are you there amen he said pretty good pretty bad so i taught you today the rest how to receive it and i'm telling you what's going to come after you receive it pretty good pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty good pretty bad he said well since me received that since i drank this water in the refrigerator man i got into a wall he said the husband in me not outside of me one of them is hell because when the holy ghost comes it gives you rest in your white dog are you there is the black dog one of them a white dog and said they do what romans 7 i want to do good [Music] the desire of the flesh are contrary to the desire of them they begin to fight and my leg are you there they go and fight at one another and say the white dog want me to do romans 7 and the black dog want me to do roman 7 where chief which one wins the fight say that depends on which one chief what i think that is a good answer here they just depend on the worrying of them my body cries for the lord that is in you it depends on which one you cater to which what you get they come on nature after the things of them your body is still waiting for the sure mercies of david are you there oh dear spiritual nature after the things of your inner soul is crying after that are you there so brother stephen you taught me about rest if i get this rest you say i'm going to get in the wall how am i going to fight this battle how am i going to fight this battle let me skip this we'll see if we can get this on wednesday how am i gonna fight this battle this battle is fought by joshua amen when you get the holy ghost amen you entering the world zone because your own body will begin to fight you i'm not talking about amalek out of there the sin that paul says in the body will begin to walk against you amen but when the sin is worrying about you that's the ministry of joshua now call joshua to take care of the america who is joshua he that is in you is greater than he that is in there let's turn amen the ministry the ancient chief never said i begin to beat myself stupid stupid stupid that's not a the fight is not you the fight is the white dog and the black dog are you there it is the white dog that is fighting against the black dog not you all you need to do you need to make sure the hand of moses are up against the gravitational forces amen make sure you give joshua more fuel amen feed joshua more amen if you do this you begin to feed the black dog because the forces of nature is pulling you if you do this you begin to feed who joshua and the more you feed joshua the more everybody is like this at work you are just smiling is that a slave yes he's a slave yes why is this slave happy because the slave had a revelation that i come from god even though i'm in this world i'm still behaving like a child of a christian are you there they didn't give him a paycheck they didn't treat him good better than the other one regardless of how they treated him he never changed that slave because the joshua there is fed by a revelation of predestination let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father i want to just a lot of it beyond time because i wanted to reach a point that's going to help us pick up easily lord lord we didn't point anybody in this church to this church we didn't point them to a man we didn't point them to a certain person we pointed them to christ the anointed word of the our lord father many here are gathered together not because they want to be bad people they came here because they wanted to look at their lives through the mirror of the world the word and make sure lord that their life is worthy of the gospel and one of these days if you come they can meet you in the air to be with you forever lord we spoke about the category of sin lord if there is anybody here or maybe on a stream or maybe down the road they're going to stream back because their work or they have a certain difficulties being streaming in direct line lord father that is still banqueting in sin banqueting in pornography banqueting in disobedience sneaking and smoking doing things that is contrary living an unclean life lord make this morning sermon knock at the door father to pull them from that wilderness of sin and to bring them into the water of life further if there are people here born in a message grew up in the message but never have an experience with you where they can put their finger and say this is it this is where my life changed this is where i stopped struggling this is where i stop sneaking on that because if you don't do it you'll be chased away from home i'm just waiting for 18 years old so that i can leave home and then i can do my own things because living under mummy living under daddy seems to be like it's a bunch of rules if they are here this morning they are preparing to leave or maybe if i get married when i'll go to my husband then i will do what i wanted to do because when i'm living with that they want me to do this way this way when i go to my own house i can dress like i want i can eat like i want i can go any places that i want nobody can come and talk to me father if this is there is anybody here that is in that situation that has been living like paul living like pharisee living after fighting after the tradition of people took the message for another religion where they can find friends they can hang out on the weekend hang out on friday hang out somewhere just get together and just life laugh joke joke joke go somewhere play play play lord before the door closes may you be merciful unto them to knock very hard at their door so that they can respond to your call and come on today and drink from them to rest from all their labor they have been working so hard they have been laboring so hard all their preoperation everything they put first is their job because their job provides for their car their job provide for the food their job paid their uh houses and they put you second yes never understood that if you put them in on the bed of the hospital they can take the house they can take that car they can destroy that credit and they will find themselves down father they're under the imagination of their own self because your word stated that everything that men do seems good to their own eyes father may do you deliver them for that deception that deceitful spirit that make them think that what they're doing is right and neglecting the things of god when they talk about being somewhere they can be on that time every day every place is on time when we come to the house of the lord this is when we take our time this is when we shower for 35 minutes but when it's on the job sometimes we skip showering because we don't want to get pointed yes lord may you touch your children this is not the time of playing this is not the charm of being under a religious spirit this is a time that we must make contact with the living god with the living christ a real god that can come and quench the thirst of our soul and bring us into a candidate seal us with the holy spirit until the day of redemption and that full redemption that will come with adoption to bring the redemption of our body father i commit them unto the hand i am begging them lord as a shepherd we are knocking lord the best that we can do as a watchman warning your people to flee from the wrath that is coming because you are coming to take your brother father lord may they find their place for word and uh and refer them because there is plenty of spaces there is room for all if somebody got the holy ghost there is more holy ghost available to be filled lord father where they are if they are crying unto you if they are praying if they are testing made by the power of the holy spirit you drop down in their life may you touch them then you feel them when you give them a personal experience that can change their life that can bring them to be more concerned to the things of god may lord you don't let them that are still reluctant don't let them sleep until they make peace with thee because the hour is late we must leave this world father we committed unto the hand and ask it in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] when you get a chance to go back we give a lot of scriptures because we want your faith to be based on the scripture based on the word of god so that you see it yourself that it's not the will of a pastor it is the will of god and it is god's program god bless you brother john amen amen [Applause] in times like these you need a savior [Music] in times like these you need an anchor be very sure be very sure your anchor holds and grips that solid rock [Music] this rock is jesus yes he's the one [Music] this rock is jesus the only one be very sure be very sure your anchor holds and grips the solid rock let's sing the last verse in times like this [Music] we have a save you make it personal and say in times like these i have an anchor be very sure i'm very sure my anchor holds

lord jesus we can do nothing but thank you lord god for bringing this message this morning lord jesus lord i know this was for the porter household lord and we got we got a lot of praying that we need to do lord and i thank you lord it's stung at times lord jesus but you care enough lord to make it sting and to say get back in line so let us all examine ourselves lord jesus lord there's many i can say you gave me the holy ghost years ago lord but i need a refreshing lord god i need lord i need to rededicate lord a few things in my life you took things from me lord a long time ago lord the very desire for certain things but i know you're not done with me lord and you said you would finish the job that you started so help me lord help my family help my christian brothers and sisters here lord we all lord we have aspects in our lives that we need to put our car in neutral with we need to let joshua come in lord when the amalekites arise lord and to allow him to fight that battle so we ask
