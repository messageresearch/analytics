just keep him in prayer all is well yeah he just need to go through some treatment so just keep him in prayer so everything goes well amen yeah but David is taking him today there Genesis 39 verse one if you thereare you can say amen and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard you know what it means now an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down there you might be seated so there was a need in the house of this man Piper he was looking for a slave a worker and for some reason the Lord opened up that need so that Joseph can get closer not directly going to the throne but first first you go through P our house before you can get to the throne you go through the preparation through the training amen before you get there amen and verse two and the Lord was with Joseph you remember this with David now couple Sundays ago and he was a prosperous man how did we know that he was a prosperous man was he written on his forehead I'm asking a question were you just looking at him and say oh uh that slave is a prosperous man how do we know he was a prosperous manen glory to God the Bible says Joseph was a prosperous man Joseph was a prosperous man ah glory to God how do we know that he is a prosperous man how can we tell because of the way he dressed no because of the kind of suit he wear no sir how many gold stuff he has around no sir because he got good gold teeth I'm just picking up a number if you got them there is nothing wrong with with it said okay how do we know he's a prosperous man because he got some Rams on the car that when he stop and the RMS keep moving how do we know he's a Prosper because you can have all of that uhhuh and you are poor that's right you can have all of that and your bank account is overdraft you know what let's pray because so we we free Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace you love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but Lord father when he come to interpret your word he only take a supernatural action from the Holy Spirit Lord may you move me and the congregation those that are here and streaming away may you come and be Lord the one teaching from the pulpit and the inside teacher in the heart of your children so that we can live here filled completely blessed s is fire change and Lord father our eyes open completely to see the goodness of the Lord father we commit everything unto our hand May the devil and his Angel be completely sealed out of this place may only the Holy Spirit and the elect Angel be in this place to minister to your children in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen so I was saying you can have all of that and you poor you can even have a nice house but you don't have money in the bank account you can drive a nice car it doesn't mean you prosper broke completely

when you were sleeping I was awake amen amen how do we know he's a prosperous man amen verse two and the Lord was with Jose you dare my interpret yes sir okay let's go the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man right and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian how do we know he's a prosperous man verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him so there was something peculiar about Joseph M that you can tell that God's hand is in the life of this man but how do we know was the hand of the Lord going over Joseph like this no sir sir did they see the pillar of fire all the time around him sir first his master noticed amen amen amen he saw that God was with him amen he didn't stop there we clear come on and the Lord made him Prosper no sir we on verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made him Prosper made all he was already a prosperous man uh-huh but the Lord made all that he did so Prosperity is not in the mouth come on come on are we together okay God I'm a prosperous man yes what about the result amen amen the fruit uh-huh The Works which is the of Faith Amen brother BR say works is Faith expressed amen so there is a faith and there is works we got to go with both of them that's right you can't have faith without our works amen we must have faith with Works amen the Lord is with you yes how do we know show me the works amen amen amen so his Prosperity was coupled with work amen are we together amen and he was through this works amen that we knew that the Lord was prospering him if I lost you raise your hand

know God is with you there must be a life uh-huh amen following you uh-huh that is actually displaying what God is doing in your life so God made everything that Joseph did so when Joseph work are we together then God step in the work amen are we together Joseph didn't sit watching TV and then they say okay he's watching TV he's a pro man no no when he was at work God jumped into the work amen and made the work prosper and when the work Prosper then the people realize this man is a bless man amen because the work he's doing is prospering amen are we together are we together hope you slept well amen and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to what prosper in his hand that's how they knew that this is a different caliber amen because everybody many people can promise a lot of stuff many candidate in presidence can tell a lot of stuff when you elect me I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this the end result is when you get there let's see what happen see what you do amen then we know what kind of man you are so promising is not enough that's right amen amen let's see you in work in the job then we can tell whether you know what you're talking about amen the Lord did so this Prosperity goes with work amen this work is not different than whatever anybody else does but the difference is when you work God step in your work amen and your result are different than any other person then we know the Lord is with you amen then we know the Lord is prospering you amen because somebody's going 888 you going 20,000 amen are we together are we together how are we selling the same thing and yours is moving mind is now moving now we begin to notice something Supernatural yes now people come and say what is your secret what do you do because I'm doing the same thing you're doing yeah the Lord was with him are we okay praise God hope everything will be all right verse four and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over what his house and all that he had he put it where into his hand at the beginning he didn't do it now the ceremon is Shifting amen at the beginning pipy was not stupid that's right that's right he have to try oh God Lord help me up don't worry I'm getting there I'm going to get there but if didn't just come and look at Joseph and say h this boy look good you know what let me give him the responsibility of my house you going to cry that's right that's rightl you will be bankrupt first you got to show your work when we see the result of your work then he built confidence amen that every time I give this boy something to do he always does it correctly and he prospered therefore now you can take over everything now I can go to sleep in peace because I know in the hand of whom I place my stuff what a principle we need to learn and you're going to learn it sooner so pipar tested first Amen in this church we teach you everything because the message got everything amen oh okay part are tested first tested Joseph amen amen when he seen how the Lord the result amen then he open up amen amen amen you cannot see somebody first day and you open up don't worry I'm going to get there amen amen verse 5 and he came to to pass from the time that he had made him how Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord did what blessed the Egyptians house for the for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was where upon all that he had in the house where in the house and what in the field so whichever business was going in the house and in the field begin to prosper amen amen so his Prosperity was displayed through what God was doing in the natural life amen when you look at the house of Piper before Joseph and after Joseph you can tell the difference amen you can tell that no no no no no since Joseph came uh-huh since this message came uhhuh since Jesus came uhhuh things begin to change amen this house is not the way you used to be my marriage changed my children changed my work Chang my business Chang am my church Chang amen amen amen amen glory to God let's go to Exodus chapter 1 you're doing very good amen amen Oh Glory to God uhhuh Exodus chapter 1 verse 6 if you dare you can say Amen am you need to keep your Bible the Bible says and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation died first they went to Egypt when they went to Egypt they were placed in a place called Goan right amen Amen brother Bram say he was the fruit of the land amen and brother Bram say it was the best place of Egypt and remember not even the plague were getting there that's right secure protected when Egypt is in darkness over there there is light amen right amen so Israel going to Egypt started at Goan with all privileges amen privileged people high class people amen everybody fear them because of Joseph we clear praise God now Joseph died amen amen and all Brethren and all that generation died amen amen and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased how abundantly and did what multiplied and works exceedingly what Mighty and the land was what filled with them what is the secret of these people why are they prospering like this I already prayed so we are soring amen amen the Bible says in Genesis 47: 27 that an Israel dwell in the land of Egypt in the country of what Goan and they had what possessions therein and they grew and they what multiplied exceedingly so if they give you something good if they place you in a best place they give you advantages we need to see some result amen amen they cannot give you $8,000 and tomorrow you have zero and you lost everything you must Prosper amen you must move forward amen so when they put Israel in the Blessed Place Israel begin to multiply why didn't the Egyptian multiply come on brother did the possessor of the land why didn't Egypt Prosper that's it that's it amen amen why they didn't multiply what was the secret of these Jews let me read it continue amen we on verse uh 7 and the children of Israel were fruitful and increase abundantly and multiply and works exceeding Mighty and the land was filled with them everywhere you going there is a Hebrew you enter Walmart a Hebrew you go to the restaurant a Hebrew we begin to have Hebrews restaurant in Egypt Hebrews car washes in Egypt Hebrews dentist in Egypt Hebrews company in Egypt everywhere you going to the hospital Hebrews the nurses are Hebrews what is wrong with this these people are taking over the land what is the secret are we together amen the Bible says in verse 8 now there arose up a new king over Egypt with new not Joseph amen amen we will come back to this and he said to his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more M are more are more and migher than we both of them were in the same land Egypt both of them were working when the other one begin to prosper it begin to cause jealousy that's right it become a problem have you noticed all of them are moving forward why they didn't learn what the Jews were doing Ken why didn't you do what AB did amen you are ready to get upset you are ready to be jealous why don't you why don't you do like your brother am it was easy he just took a lamb and kill it why don't you find the lamb and kill him but instead of killing you turn into jealousy because Israel have to change mental he have to change garment they came from a high place now God need to change the Garment of Israel are we together amen are we together how many garment do we have my friend Hallelujah number one which what the coat of many color Oh Glory to God number two is what serving slave so what was happening to Israel from a high position a privilege and everything and God turned the fire on because Israel need to change the government now the Jews have to become slaves and servant because their Journey started the Exodus started are we together are we together okay servant or slave what is the third one my friend prisoner prisoner and what is the fourth one appearance to Pharaoh no error now at this time appear before Pharaoh what is the last one fine linen the fine lenen which goes with the marriage of the Lamb amen amen amen so we found out that Israel now begin to prosper and the prosperity cause jealousy the mental the court of many color cause jealousy always cause jealousy so don't expect when you're moving forward the whole world to clap for you if the church is moving forward don't expect everybody to be happy you need to learn this principle it will keep your blood pressure correct don't even mind that when you see that it's a signal that you moving forward there is two ways you can take it you can take it as a negative energy or you can take it as a compliment that ah devil Now understand that I'm troubling you you are troubled by my spiritual progress it means are moving with the Lord that's why you trouble are we together are we together why are you trouble why are you upset why are you jealous we all working in the same company when I change car it's a problem what is the problem with you who told you to spend money the way you spending what is the secret of these Jews that made them multiply GL GL you need a prophet my friend sir what is the secret of these Jews Glory to God brother Bram say in the message Jas a secret believer put your seat belt my friend in the days of Moses when God sent Moses down to deliver the children of Israel before he could deliver the children of Israel first pharaoh There Rose up a what a pharaoh who did not know what Joseph so that hatred is the beginning of Exodus uh-huh are we together and he was a smart phoh perhaps train in all the Theology of Egypt he was how smart and how true but he didn't have he had a good reasoning but he didn't have the word of God Amen Ken didn't have the Revelation am are we together now the reason now he reason out how scientifically and say this is Pharaoh saying brother Bram is giving us the sin this is in the tunders Amen brother Bram say Pharaoh say look here he's talking to his people they are all what multiplying they are more of a what Thrifty people than we are so the first characteristic of Jews or Israel in Egypt Israel were free 50 people I thought you put your seat belt what does 3y mean what does he mean a 50 man a 50 woman according to the dictionary a 50 person is a person who uses money a person who uses money and other resources amen carefully it's very easy to say oh Israel is prospering learn what Israel is [Music] doing the Lord is prospering Israel how are we together Israel were people that use his money and other sources carefully amen amen they were not wasteful people a 50y person is a person who use his money and

balance if you got something in your heart for God and you want what express it and so forth and just doing what keep putting it off well later on later on and that little what desire that you once had to do what to serve God will be what be taken from you the devil will come in and do it and seal that away and you won't have that desire to do what to serve him he works for your money and he works in the spiritual he works in the natural and he works in the spiritual when God is calling you come to your come and serve the Lord whenever the desire is hot because after a while the devil will take it away from you am am amen amen Israel prosper in Egypt what was their secret now when they say Israel was prospering now you know what they were doing Solomon the greatest King how did he become king God say I'm going to bless you Solomon you're going to be the richest of all the king so Solomon just sat and the and the blessing came and then he woke up in the morning and he found gold laying there and Solomon woke up he say ah the Lord you have fulfill your duty I was just sleeping overnight I woke up look at this gold now I'm the richest person how did Solomon with the blessing of the Lord how did he get where he got I'm still reading my Bible my friend amen am brother Bram says this glory to God when a gift is what given to the church and the church do what refuses to hear that gift then the gift will become of what of none effect but when the gift is given to what the church and the church do What receives it then it's a what a golden age for that church let me leave it alone you do you do the M yourself it become a golden age for what that church Israel was living in it what Golden Age under who Solomon and Solomon brother Robert isah was in the Golden Age amen what does he mean so you go outside you see Gold Everywhere Solomon gold the trees are in gold cars are in gold everything is in gold the Golden Age amen what El the Golden Age means glory to God brother Bram all Israel did what glorified God because of this marvelous what he was what perfectly operated and they could see the what results that he was not something that was just what a put on but it was what a real gift from God remember remember Joseph they got to see the result yes let me go with Solomon a little bit more brother Bram saying the queen of the South we come to who Solomon in the days of who Solomon and Bible reader knows that that was what the gold age of Israel that was the best days they ever had Solomon Reign Solomon Reign my friend was a golden age the best days of Israel amen H everybody want to look at this what are we seeing brother Bram say that was the what amateur millennial can you say Amen can you say Amen Solomon was am Millennium so when you get into Solomon way you almost like in a millennium what makes that Millennium how did they become a millennium God because David was not a millennium how did Solomon turn the Kingdom from David to an amature Millennium what was the secret of Solomon the Lord bless him how are we together are we together brother brandham say everything not something everything did what prospered under Solomon why when God does what gives a gift to a people or what a nation or what a people and those people will do what recognize that gift it is what a golden age for them in other word God gave Solomon the vision that's right and Solomon has to deliver the vision to the people and the people that respect listen pay attention receive and act upon the vision that Solomon delivered those people will see the result of Solomon because the anointing all when he comes upon the head of Aon he doesn't stop on the head the Bible say he goes where down to the beard down to the beard down to what all the way to the H of the Garment if you can receive that oil don't worry my friend brother Bram say if they turn it down it's a what chaos for them so when a gift come it's a trouble you don't receive it you're in trouble you receive it you bless amen that is the reason he kept saying a what greater than Solomon is here and they were turning it how down in other words Jesus was telling you do you know Solomon I am bigger than Solomon but they didn't understand what he was talking about they rejected he came to his own and his own receive him he goes to the Gentile now we got the seals open now the Gentile become the pride not the Jews the Jews remain servant Israel is servant but the church is the bride the 144,000 won't be the bride they will be your servant are we together are we together am are we together am look at Solomon my friend brother Bram he says in the days of Solomon Solomon's Reign any Minister knows that was what a golden age for Israel the what the greatest age the Golden Age the best days of Israel in amateur Millennium the greatest age amen what made the age greatest they built what the temple they had no war to a mon to anything and they had let me leave it alone am am do you see what war does to the economy let me leave it alone amen and they had the power of God among them and that gift was how so great till all the nation around about did What Fear them now we find out that when we come down to the next character which is who Solomon now all Bible readers know that the days of Solomon was what the Golden Age of Israel they Prosper more under who Solomon because they have there was hardly what any war and they built what the temple and he was a great golden time for Israel amen let's refocus our lenses a little bit and get into Solomon era we ready don't worry my friend glory to God in First Kings chapter 10 verse 21 and all King how many all King Solomon what drinking vessels where of what gold can iue and all the vessels of the House of the forest of Lebanon were what of pure gold all of them none were what silver you see the golden age he was nothing a counted in the days of what Solomon this man prospered so much until silver was nothing thing is go how did you get there Solomon what did you do to get there glory to God 2 Chronicle 1 ver1 15 and the King made what silver and gold silver and gold and Jerusalem as ples as what Stones why did David didn't do it huh huh after Solomon anybody did this so we need to learn the secret of Solomon that when he Prosper silver and gold are like Stone what they left for my friend Oh Glory to God and the what cedar trees the expensive trees made he as a what the sycamore tree that are what in the veil for what abundance so whatever was big in the eyes of the people all over the world when you get to Israel it's common let me put it this way to make a sense okay in other words when you get to Israel everybody's driving a Mercedes that's so you don't know who's poor you don't know who's rich because V Bram say if you get money to those that are called Christian there won't be any poor person amen because Christian are the one who knows how to hand the money but today is the opposite we going to the unbeliever to learn how to keep our money the unbeliever should be coming to you Amen to ask you advice how to save money Oh Glory to God the Golden Age of Solomon Solomon had did you get there first King 5 if I stop here no problem my friend I told you I hope I'm going to finish the reading of the scripture amen first king 5:2 and the lord gave Solomon what wisdom we clear as he did what promised him and there was a what peace between Haram and Solomon and they two made a what a league together and Solomon and King Solomon raised a what a levy out of all Israel do you know what a levy mean yes sir I know all of you will say many of you will say it's tax which is also true Amen Let me see what kind of taxes he weighs I'm going to read the Bible le le our day means taxes but let me see the tax of Solomon Solomon raised a what Levy out of all Israel and the levy was what 30,000 men stop what kind the taxes 30,000 men I'm asking you so Liv here does a mean tax are we together are we together the word Levy here means for SL Solomon took 30,000 people let me read the Bible King Solomon raised a what Levy out of all Israel and the levy was what 30,000 men and he sent them to what Lebanon 10,000 what a month by courses a month they were where in Lebanon and two month where at home like truck driver they go and they come back and Adon was off the what are we together Solomon hired took 30,000 people and put them into labor you leave your home one month and you going there not in the carabines not in Dubai not in M Beach you're going to work and when you come they give you two month break like teacher and after two month you go back up again amen what was the purpose of this Levy glory to God the Bible says in first king chapter 9 I put this to save you time to to go over the Bible okay so relax and this is the reason of what the levy which King Solomon raised for the before to do what build the house of the Lord so the temple didn't come from Heaven amen the Temple of Solomon the beautiful Temple that have gold didn't fall from Heaven somebody was at work somebody was clocking in and clock out to build the temple am am oh my God am am

accomplish something in other word there was sacrifice am am before this Prosperity be displayed listen to this my friend in first king 11 verse 47 and Solomon did what slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of what David his father and RAM his son did what reigned in so the son of Solomon his name is what rehob we clear now in first king chapter 12 verse1 the Bible say and RAM went to shikim for all Israel were come to shikim to make him King and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet where in Egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of King woo Solomon and Jobo dwelt in Egypt that they sent and call him because Solomon is theread they say come back and jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spake to who ram ram who is the son of who Solomon who is the new king and they say what that father who was his father made our yoke how [Applause] Grievous you never seen this before my friend the reign of Solomon was how previous oh it was Golden Age it was what the best day of Israel it was what amateure millennium it was what the greatest age but underneath that Millennium what was there work do you see the S let me go this one

there so yes sir you ought to take a what a lesson from the end take a lesson from what how can you be a human being taking a lesson to another you need to humble yourself take a lesson from a n a bug the bug that you step on he's more wiser amen he say you need to take a lesson from what the end the Bible say you know if they don't work they don't eat that is what exactly right you don't want to work no food don't worry William Marion Bram here we found out we found an example of what all of us every one of us we always are what running from something we run from what trouble we run from what responsibility we are all prone to what do that we are we are more prone to run than we ought to stand and do what and face it out we find ourself how running sometime we find ourself prone to run from what work it is impossible to be a brother and you don't want to work it's a sickness unless you dis and we need to make sure you show me that disability card because you're not desable in [Music] spending you are desable in [Applause] producing amen Amen brother Bram say we don't want to we don't want to do what some people just think they can make a living without what working but I think Solomon is what that say we find here the answer in watching what ant you know a little ant they tell me if that every and doesn't work and lay in that an doesn't eat that winter either so everybody has to do what work brother Bram say in the End Community they watch you if they see you on the iPad and they Mark you if they see you on the telephone posting posting posting posting posting every day you are even uh paid by WhatsApp or Instagram to be posting they Mark you because on the posting that's when we show what we doing then we he was at the beach he was here and the aunt Mark you they say no problem and if one come and complain they say well did you see brother so they say leave him alone let him enjoy his time you keep working in the anend community I'm reading the message amen and then when we take him [Laughter] don't seek for forgiveness because some take advantage of what Christianity is all about you do stuff purposely in the intent that I'm going to ask forgiveness they will help me that's why we got Deacon are we together so in the end Community they already know when it's time for wi they say don't worry we got him yes H then we see somebody Hallelujah Lord Jesus help me Jesus they say m we remember when you were in the iPad there in the End Community you didn't work you can roll on the floor you can cry you can read the message all day you won't [Applause] eat I'm reading PR now they won't give you you will and next time you will learn when everybody's working you going to work if the ant have such an organization so the aunt have a good police officer because somebody must be there to be following you like uh huh hey you over there over there you are winter is two month you'll be fasting for 60 days amen so they have a good Sheriff so they a got good president that follows everything everything is structure amen oh my let's see the end a little bit let me Focus the end let me get under the ground and see what happened in the end the Bible say in Proverbs 6 verse 6 go to the what end you who Slugger lazy you who love the bed so much go to the end consider what her ways and be what wise so wisdom is in the end can I continue what is the ways of an an which have no what guy no what overseer no What ruler no police officer but they know how to get you disciplined am when they say the anend you don't eat you thought they are structure the Bible say there is no ruler no overseer no supervisor so how do they leave they manage to live by discipline am amen amen am amen amen because if you don't know how to manage the little one even God himself won't promote you this is what brother I'm saying then when you go to doing something what good just like you was working for a bus Piper and you start out on the first of your job and you are what willing to take orders amen amen you are willing to do what take orders so giving a job is not enough the problem is willing to do what take orders then bus py has what confidence in you and he will keep what raising you up to a what a higher office all the time why you don't get a salary raiser on what happened knowing too much answering back to the supervisor am Amen brother brother this is the message of the hour this is the solution to our problem this is what God wants you to do so you can prosper so you can move from that house to a different house willing to follow orders and when the boss sees that they promote you to a higher position brother brandham say I believe that time has struck the brandham Tabernacle to know what to take the gift that God give us that God can trust us with something even what greater than what we have got you want God to give you something more than you got you want to move to the other learn how to manage what you have first then God will increase it because God hate wasting but we cannot go along and see a man that is always have to be tell have to be tell him and everything they have to talk to him everything every day and remember the spirit of what the prophet is subject to what the prophet what does he mean when you see a man that you have to do what correct or a what a woman and that person gets out of H and then you are telling him there what scriptural truth then it shows that the spirit that is on them is what isn't of God can I continue yes because the Bible say the spirit of what the prophets of prophesying that is testifying preaching speaking in tongues or whatever it is because tongues interpreted is what prophecy the spirit is so it is subject to what the prophet and the word is the prophet amen so when they say the spirit is subject to the prophet that Prophet means the word amen so your spirit must be under the word hallelujah so when they tell you something from the scripture you must humble yourself if you're the one spending money push the break get back in [Music] line ambition is okay how do you handle your ambition amen the Bible say learn from an ant which have no guide overseer or but he provide her meat when in the summer and gather her food in the what Harvest let's go to Genesis I can't even move I'm still in the reading of the Bible let's go to Genesis 41 let me drop this and let me see if I can let you go home my time is almost gone I'm in a second scripture so help me amen amen amen amen Genesis 41 verse 30 if you thereare you can say Amen this is a cleansing that's right so tomorrow when you prosper you will be the one enjoying I will be sleeping you enjoying amen amen amen amen we there we there amen verse 30 the Bible says and they shall arise after them what seven years of famine you know this already and all the Plenty will be how forgotten in the land of Egypt and famine and the famine shall do what consume the land so what is coming is dangerous and it's going to destroy everything the vision is open so what do we do what do we do start panicking we got to find a solution God open up something he have to give us a solution he's just not a God to open the seals and then we stop there and we don't know what to do that's why we going through all of this we got to know what to do now now that the seals are open how do we invest our money yes siren how do we protect our money how do we spend our money until the Rapture comes amen amen now we know it's going to be danger it's going to be bad so what verse 31 and the Plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of famine following for it shall be how very Grievious everybody oh oh God so what are we going to do my retirement plan my this slow down amen verse 32 for that the dream was double to Pharaoh twice it is because the think is what established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass now solution therefore let Pharaoh look out a man how discreet no not any cand to hander this the solution against Bad circumstances in the future the solution against Calamity against trouble amen amen what is the solution against Calamity against trouble number one you must find somebody who's how discreet somebody who knows how to discern somebody who's prudent somebody who's careful that's what discret mean not anybody can solve this situation you must be prudent careful amen find somebody who is discret discreet come on and and what wise it require wisdom it require the Capstone it will car the cloud amen amen amen amen which is the opening of the word verse uh uh uh 33 somebody who's discreet and how wise and set him over the land of what Egypt if you don't have somebody who's discreet and why you in trouble amen what is that person going to do God gave us all the principles in the Bible to know how to live in our homes brother pram says uh uh uh uh the Bible says let Pharaoh do this after you found that man let him appoint what officers over the land so the solution to the Grievous famine is the same solution Solomon used am you got to find people who are willing to work that's right am oh my found one the director two verse 34 let Pharaoh do this let him appoint what officers over the land plural and take them what take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years so there will be a l a levy of people that will be there in the land and that Levy is responsible to be pulling 20% amen so every that is coming up 20% goes to the saving how many percentage goes to your [Music] saving we in trouble amen we're in trouble how many percentage go to the saving negative saving that $5 they left it there so the bank don't charge you $5 fee you know what I'm talking about amen amen verse 35 and let them gather what all the food of those good years that come and lay the corn under the hand of who of pharaoh and let them the food where in the city in other word when some people are enjoying the Plenty somebody his eyes is not on enjoyment somebody is his eyes his focus is not on enjoying yet it's about how can I glean and put things away because of the future and when Joseph begin to glean that money God stepping and begin to take the 20% and begin to multiply the 20% when Solomon begin to put people to work God step in and begin to take whatever you doing and begin to multiply it when Joseph begin to work God step in that work and begin to get that work and multiply it and py could tell that what is coming from Joseph is different than anybody who work it looks like there is something magical about this boy when I put him when he goes he comes with five this one goes he comes with two Joseph is always or above because God stepp in his work that's right are we together we almost I'm going to let you go my friend verse uh 36 and the food and that food shall be stored shall shall be foro to the land against what the seven years of family so somebody is working against something in other words there is a project and the project is set we know it's a project of seven years there is a goal and we working toward the goal so when the income is coming I'm teaching you all this principle my friend from the Bible and the message of the hour when the man is coming we not play this is not the time of playing it is the time to prepare to reach a goal young man you are in college you must have a goal if not you will sit in college 10 years and you can't graduate when somebody goes 3 years and they graduate why are you staying longer because no goal no Focus they give you 40 classes you taking one class a semester one class a semester something is wrong can you say amen amen something is wrong but if you let go and you sit down and you say 40 I can divide it maybe six classes and then you take maybe 40 divided by five he give you six you say you know what in two years I'll be done from this one then you are progressing with goals am that's true amen amen I'm entering even your schools everything my friend amen it's the message of the hour the Bible says against the seven years of Fe which shall be in the land that the land perish not through what the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of who pharaoh and in the in the eyes of who all his servant and Pharaoh said to his servant can we find such a one as this is a man in whom what the spirit of God is and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as what God has showed thee all this come on there is none so what discreet and what and wise as who thou are drop to verse 47 and in the seven plous year the Earth brought forth what by handfuls everybody is enjoying a good time economy is high amen amen everybody's buying houses Joseph is buying something remember at the end Joseph bought the people do you remember that he bought their Beast he even bought the land and bought everything so the one who was busy working and investing is the one who's going to dominate all of you so when you enjoying somebody's focusing after a while he take over you and you going to work for him and you begin to go this brother we used to go to school with him now he's my boss look how he is you will be talking stories because your boss was focusing when you were enjoying on downtown don't worry my friend we're going to finish where are we at verse 48 the Bible say and he gather up all the what the food of the seven years which were where in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the what the cities where were the Egyptian what were they doing they were having good times amen and somebody's working laid up on the city the food of water the field which was what round about everything he laid up in the water saying and Joseph GA what corn as the what the sand of the sea how very much until he left what numbering for he was what without number when somebody else is doing something else someone is sitting Gathering every else and at the end of the day people begin to come to Pharaoh they say can you give us corn Pharaoh say go see who jph so when Joseph was working where were you enjoying enjoying your corn now Joseph is sitting enjoying amen amen he can give you any price he want to amen and this is what he did he took their land he took their camel he took their hor he took everything and put even the taxes on them because somebody was focused where did he Master this in the house of pipy and the Bible say but if any provided not for his own especially for those of his own he has what and he's worse than an idel amen let me stop here because I can't go
