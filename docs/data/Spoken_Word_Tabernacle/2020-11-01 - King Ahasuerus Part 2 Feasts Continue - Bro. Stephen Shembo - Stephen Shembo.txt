kind of an astrological sign would that baby have been born under yesterday so we were just hoping now normally bow ties are not they're not me but i feel 10 years younger or 20. and thank you for the compliments that i have been receiving um our precious brother caleb is leaving today for marine boot camp amen he's going to be a reservist he has to spend the next two weeks in atlanta under quarantine before he can actually go to paris island and go through that training i'm very proud of him i'm not i'm not crazy about the military anymore but if if he's feeling led to go that way nobody you know i can't question it and i'm going to be praying for him amen i think it's a noble thing to you know to have served in the military um it's not i don't know how it is today i can't comment but this was a gift from him and i wanted to honor him by changing out of my tie and wearing wearing this uh he thought enough of me you know to give it to me and and i certainly appreciate it maybe i'll wear it on the day you return okay as you wear your uniform i'll wear the i may wear my beret too it's my old beret i've got it just in honor of you so let's pray for our brother i i want to make this comment as well um you know some of us haven't known him very long um but it's it's a rare thing and i mentioned that to some of the brothers as we're setting up this morning it's a rare thing to find in a young man the willingness to do as much as this man has done for us to have a service and and that's why i want i want to pray for him because what's going to happen when he comes back where will he go from there you know he did a great job interpreting wednesday we were enjoying that and he was doing a good job i don't know if it was his first time good you did a fine job my brother so um maybe you know some help these guys need relief every once in a while from for the earphones as well um i've i've got uh two other announcements one well let's say let's go to prayer requests first so remember brother caleb remember my grandbaby has got to come sometime hopefully soon and does anybody else have anything on their heart they want to bring it before the lord as we go to him in prayer for special needs yes brother jimmy okay all right any direction in that or just you want to just do general prayer over it oh wow well you look good this morning so the lord's already touching amen praise god anybody else remember brother jimmy amen praise the lord now i said something about getting one of these young brothers he's not even looking at me now come on up my brother pollycock's brothers our sons and we we want to find out if there's gifts in these young men amen god bless you my brother lord heavenly father i come to you this morning to pray for the people that had a prayer request i don't know all their problems are what they may need but may you put a hand upon them and heal whatever needs to be healed and fix or repair whatever needs to be fixed and repair the lord and i'm praying for today's service oh lord may you be the person to speak to each individual one of us may help each of us oh lord because each of us have our own obstacles that we need to overcome and we need your hand to help us overcome them oh lord oh lord jesus christ i'm praying for the offerings also lord when it goes passing by may bless the people that give offerings and for those that doesn't may bless them so next time when they come they may have something to give to you oh lord jesus christ i'm abandoning the rest of today's surface onto your hands oh lord amen amen thank you my brother god bless you yes sir hallelujah yes sir y'all may be coming maybe seated as they come around uh i have first announcement there was an umbrella left here last week so if anybody's missing one um see brother um brother daley at the back after you know after service uh also i want to remind everyone of sister rebecca's um baby shower on the 17th of this month at brother or sister sharon's house um and uh i mean you can see her for address if you don't know i'm sure most of us know where they live um and then i want to i want to make an appeal this morning i had i spoke to brother i'm stephen about it you know we've had fellowship in in someone's home we had a bible study once at my house and we had a fellowship you know with a few people at brother steven's house and we had a big one at brother um at brother daley's home [Music] and i just it was enjoyed so much we enjoyed it so much as as even adults it's geared for the youth we want to remove the stigma with the youth that if they have questions they're going to be judged by the question that they asked we're not we don't want to give the impression that anybody you know if you have a question you're not going to be judged we're not going to judge young people we just want to help you understand and have the revelation of the word of the hour and we encourage attendance to the fellowships now you know the food is very good as well okay so and brother stephen assured me that you know the church helps with that there's already been um you know it's set aside for for things like this my my appeal is that if it's possible for somebody to open their home up you know my home is tore apart right now because we're building bathrooms and rebuilding bathrooms and all of my living room furniture is under covers and we're fixing to have to move into our spare bedroom and [Music] or i'd have everybody over at my house it's coming we will soon as we get everything back back to normal um but if somebody has it on their heart to open up their home for this type of fellowship we want to ask for it we want to say follow the leading of god open your door your house won't get destroyed we won't leave you cleaning up all the you know afterwards and everything or cooking all the food if i'm there i'm gonna eat my portion maybe a little more but just consider pray about it and consider because the fellowship you know we're in a unique situation here by not having a building a church building so we have to we have to rely on homes in the hearts of the people so just you know everyone consider it oh wow sister devine your your mother's here this morning amen praise the lord glory to god hallelujah that is wonderful that is wonderful what time is it okay i'm going to sing the only special we're going to have today if you have a song on your heart hold on to it till next week this is going to be kind of a a special song we are going to put it up on the over here because i'm not going to i'm a song leader i'm not a soloist so i need a little help this morning okay i sang this once and i didn't do very good job so i need the help it's a familiar song and i also only gave the musicians um was it this morning yes this morning okay so we're really relying on god between singing and playing but y'all sing yes it is so when we sing it just enjoy it and it's going to be it's it's a special song this morning let me wet my lips again that doesn't stuck to me i'm talking too much [Music] it's just right it's always nerve-wracking to come up here hey man [Music] i dreamed i went to heaven and you were there with me [Music] we walked upon the streets of gold beside the crystal sea i'm not getting the tempo [Music] saw this young man and he was smiling as he came he said friend you may not know me now but then but wait you used to teach my sunday school when i was only hey [Music] and every week you would say a prayer before the class would start one day when you said that prayer i asked jesus in my home thank you thank you for giving to the home i am a life that was changed thank you for forgiving to the lord stood before you said remember the time [Music] missionary came to your church and [Music] [Music] jesus took the gift you gave and that's why i'm in heaven [Applause] thank you for giving to the lord i am [Music] i am so one by one they came as far as the eyes somehow touched by your generosity the little things that you have done the sacrifice has made [Music] i noticed all the earth in heaven [Music] and i know that up in heaven

hallelujah bless you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord let me have your seats amen if you have your seat this is a very special morning two weeks ago sister priscilla brought to my attention that the second sunday in april in october is past appreciation sunday so we got together and got some tokens of appreciation we wanted to present to brother stephen and sister sharon on behalf of their service that they've been giving they've been called into this position and they have thrown themselves into it and we have we're the products of what the lord has been doing among us amen um somebody back in 1992 started this tradition of pastor appreciation and clergy appreciation so the entire month of october is clergy appreciation month well that ended yesterday but it we're not limited by that because just like father's day and mother's day we appreciate those who give every day amen and there's a scripture that covers this it's first timothy chapter 5 and verse 17 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in the word and doctrine and also in first thessalonians chapter 5 and 12 we beseech you brethren to know them which labor among you we don't see the days and nights that the pastor spends laboring in prayer for needs among us amen yes sir texting at 2 am as brother was saying and i over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves i mean that that special brother john sang was we honor the lord but he uses men so we honor our pastor this morning brother stephen sister sharon his wife we'd like to ask them to come forward please want to present a little token from the church behalf of our love and gratitude for your giving to the lord [Applause] amen hallelujah hey maybe we know it's a surprise bro steven [Applause] what a surprise amen praise god there will come a day when there's a much bigger reward for what you've been doing what you continue to do god bless you so god calls a man and he calls his wife god bless you sister sharon on behalf of the church god bless brother stephen [Applause] amen thank you very much amen these tokens are of a servant's heart and of gratitude from the church thank you for teaching us god's word amen amen if you can if you can read it you don't

of the lord amen wow wow to our pastor thank you for teaching us the word of the lord through you we are led to him amen amen jesus said if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all mark 9 35 praise the name of the lord is already got his computer up here okay okay [Music] i was not prepared for this i was getting ready to be called to preach so this really is a surprise for me i don't know if my wife is in this or she knew about it but sometimes they tell her stuff they don't tell me amen but we really truly appreciate it we don't deserve this but as a token of love from the children of god we really appreciate it and may all the glory return to god and we are proud to be a family and to work as a church family together thank you very much for the bottom of our heart we're going to sing only believe as he prepares there were there were um dreams that go back to october of last year that foresaw brother stephen becoming our pastor there was dreams showing in october men being kicked out of the church at living word there were dreams about who would anoint him and where for him to become our pastor all of these have been fulfilled and it's god i am a very very happy to be a part of this church and to be under our pastor oh oh we believe [Music] that all things are possible [Music] oh all things are possible [Music] called lord i believe lord

[Music] jesus let's give the lord a clap of amen this is really a surprise my gps signal was lost [Laughter] now i'm connected back again when brother robert was speaking i thought he wanted to present it to the church to get prepared for it i was like okay no problem he's just announcing and backing that with the word and everything didn't know it was already playing god richly bless you amen i was trying to get on brother john and he got on me by the surprise but he sure looked very good amen she said the congratulations amen praise the name of the lord [Applause] amen you know we spoke about the sister dressing nights coming to church we didn't get the brothers amen christians should look and act like gentlemen amen if you want to keep your beard that's fine just trim it pretty good amen like brother john like brother maurice jr looking good like a gentleman amen praise the name of the lord you need to cut your hair pretty good amen look like a christian look like a gentleman reflect the message that you're living with have you ever studied a picture of the pillar of fire did you see how our prophet dressed amen did you see the kind of suit he wear and the tie he had i have a lot of ties at home young people if you need them somebody gave me a bunch of ties so i can share if you need ties see me i'll bring it here and then you can get a gathering a little bit from my collection amen we want you to look like gentlemen amen where you get into a store somebody look at you they say sir without you saying anything it happened to me a lot i didn't use my whooping amen it's the way you present yourself let me help you up do you know when moses rescued the children of the girls of jethro do you remember that when he went to the well and he defended those women do you know when the women went to their father what did they say they say a hebrew deliverance what did they say an egyptian deliverers was moses an egyptian why did they refer to him like an egyptian because of his other appearance amen so we don't want to look like egyptian we want to look like christian amen we don't want our parents hanging down like this put your pants like a gentleman amen cut your hair like a gentleman shave like a gentleman look like a gentleman smell like a gentleman the message has everything in it amen we traumatize people in the message no the message has everything lined up in there amen don't worry we are still in a journey you're gonna learn stuff in this message and you're gonna be like wow i never knew it was in the message yes everything that you need on your life journey it's your home it's your marriage it's your job everything is in the message of the hour amen praise the name of the lord so we appreciate god for that you know i went to have a car wash i pulled up on a car wash i was trying to pay for it then the gate opened say wait a minute i have not paid for it okay i move on and i call the attender that was there i said come on i said sir i just stopped by the gate and they get open up i have not paid anything i have the money i want to pay for it he said don't worry about it just keep moving amen [Laughter] i say i preach so much about the car wash until god gave me a free one and then and it was not even the one that i usually get the one higher than that he said maybe it's a membership issue just go ahead put your car in neutral and pass through it amen blessed be the name of the lord so i got a free car wash i said praise the name of the lord because i have a debt that i could not pay and somebody paid for my debt and his name is the lord jesus christ and when i get there because i was predestinated as a member of his body by the baptism of the holy spirit the gift will have to open and i have to get my free watch until i make it to heaven amen let's go to the book of genesis blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah we serve a mighty god it happened i don't know two or three times i will order stuff by the time i get to the window they say the one who was in front of you paid for it you want to see that in the court it happened to brother branham i am not the replacement of brad branham there is nobody that's going to replace brother branham but the god of brother branham is also my god [Applause] i'm not going to expect less than what he did with the messenger because brother branham told us whatever he does to the messenger is an example to what he's going to do to you genesis chapter 4 verse 3. let's start even from verse one just to get a lot of background thank you brother david and adam knew his wife knew eve his wife if he's a church a woman and she conceived and war came and said i have gathered a man from the lord a cover-up just to explain that oh every life comes from god cover up you need the prophet to go under that blanket and to pull to you that that's a serpent seed amen verse two and she again bore his brother abel you might be seated so we find here that within this church call eve because a woman in the bible is a church there are two seeds we have the seed of the devil if you still have a problem with serpent seed you see me we're going to spend time together the seed of the devil satan and we have the seed of god amen now when those two seeds two vine in the church came out the bible says that in verse two and evil was a keeper of the sheep we have able brother ebo a keeper of the ship and we have kane who was a tiller off the ground everybody clear one attended to the ship another one attended to the ground but we know that before those two children were born men disobey god anybody clear when men disobey god man took the fruit of the ground which produced the fig and took thick leaves and covered himself up amen but when god came down adam in the presence of god still taught god that he was naked he was covered but that covering was not enough to protect him in the eyes of god in the eyes of god adam was still naked even though he was covered by fig leaves amen then the lord instead of cursing adam god cursed the ground are you there and when a cane comes out his life is always around that which was cursed amen correct but before they leave the garden of eden god himself took a lamb and killed the lamb and took the covering of the lamb and clothed them with a bleeding covering lamb are you there and when the elbow comes out evo is taking care of his entire life is around what god used to protect man are you there one is more spiritual one is always about the cursed stuff everybody clear amen verse three and in the process of time it comes to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground which didn't work with adam and offering those fig leaves all those fruits an offering to the lord and evil he also brought out the first ring of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect to abel and to his offering so both of these boys are worshipping amen they are worshippers both of them none of them is a hidden amen both of them offered to god but god had a respect to one who had the revelation of the sheep versus the other one amen verse five but ken but to ken and to his offering he had no respect and ken was very angry and his countenance fell and the lord said to ken why are you angry and why are your countenance fallen if you do well now something happened james he arrows and because of jealousy cain was upset against his brother then god open up and give a command god give his word to ken amen and this is the word of god to cain he said if you do well in other words if you do like your brother shall you not be accepted in other words just follow what your brother did and i'm gonna accept your offering amen and if you do not well sin lies at the door so he give him his word like if you want me to accept you this is the way but be careful unbelief sin is at the door amen and to you shall be his desire and you shall rule over him in other words i am giving you my word i am showing you that you a man and a free moral agency you have a right to take my word and to be accepted into my presence or you can reject my word by sin are you there but i'm telling you you have power to rule over sin you have the right to say no even though sin is presented to you you still have the right to say no you have the power but can willing fully that's the problem verse 8 and ken talked with fable his brother and he came to pass when they were in the field that can rolls up against about his brother and do what in other words can rejected the word of god amen if ken would have kept the word of god he would have done whatever have done and then be accepted by god but because god sent his word god sent his command and cairne took the command of god and rejected it what happened to cain verse 15 and the lord said to him therefore whosoever slay cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord said what cain was marked the first mark of the beast are you there and he set the mark upon cain lest any funding him should kill him watch verse 15. and cain went out from what in other words cain departed from the presence of god the presence of god that he had access to it he was forever forbidden from that presence can no longer could come back again in the presence of god he was marked separated from god and went outside of the presence of god because he rejected the command or the word of the lord everybody clear a cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwell in the land of node on the east of eden what i'm trying to you to show you here there is a woman a church within that church we have two vine we have two seeds we have the line of the devil and the lion of god the line of god will always line up with the first scripture god uses scripture by killing the lamb and evil line up with the word automatically wakan was mastering on the face of the world that was already cursed by god are you there both of them were worshipers but one rejected the command of god and because of rejecting the command of god a mark was put upon him and he no longer seen the presence of god everybody clear let's go to matthew 22. and then we're going to lend to our esther matthew 22 verse 1 and jesus answered and spoke to them again and by parable and say the kingdom of god of heaven is like a certain king which way made a marriage to his son and sent forth his servant to call them that were beaten to the wedding and they would not come so there was a wedding set up here this king have already chairs just like you found chairs in a hotel those chairs belong first to those that were invited are you there it was their position are you there but they rejected their position everybody clear and refused to obey the word of the king or the command of the king if you study your esther it should be dropping now are you there again he sent forefather servant verse 4 saying tell them which are beaten behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatling are killed and all things are ready come to the marriage a call into the marriage an invitation into the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant took his servant and entreated them spitefully and slew them in other words they rejected the call they rejected the invitation they rejected the command of god are you there but when the king heard thereof that the command was rejected the car was rejected the invitation was rejected he was angry we already gave you your reading and he sent off his army and destroy those murderers and burn up their cities then say he to his servant he sent his servant amen the king did not go the king sent his servant the servant came with a message and delivered the message and the message was rejected and when the message was rejected the king was upset we okay now and then say he to his servant the wedding is ready there is a position here a call for a feeling on the position but there which were beaten that which were called first amen were not what they had their opposition they were invited they have a certain relationship between them and that king that's the reason why the king invited them when you're inviting somebody to their friend their family their co-worker somebody that you know but because they rejected that invitation their position in the life of the king is lost esther chapter one you okay and then that position must be taken and given to somebody else you okay now i hope you read your bible okay and then so the servant went out into the highways and gather together all as many as the fan both bad and good because they're gonna go through purification and the wedding was what furnished with guests so the position was lost but somebody else must come and fill in that position everybody clear last scripture second thessalonians chapter two then we're gonna pray and before you pray you go back to the book of esther chapter one amen second thessalonian chapter two if you dare you can say amen is michael daley somewhere okay he's there oh praise the name amen verse 10 and we found receivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the what the love of the truth so when you see some people rejecting the word there is a mystery to that amen they are rejecting the world because in them they never receive the love of the truth and the truth we know is the word of god i am the welder truth the truth is christ for you to receive christ in you you must have the love of the truth predestination all over amen because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be what so to be saved you must receive the love of the truth if not you're not going to be saved that's why if you are saved thank god amen verse 11 and for this cause because they never receive it god shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe er that's why you stop you say how can somebody not see what i'm saying after all of this it's clear that this man is lying and still the people believe that the problem is they never receive the love of the truth and god sent them a spirit that helped them believe a lie neutral amen i'm reading the bible that they all might be working so after you believe god come and whoop you to be them who believe not though but had pleasure in what they even have pleasure that spirit make them enjoy it get on facebook and brag about it brag about a lie on the internet [Music] but we are what do you know what that ban means we are obliged we are under obligation we are born to give what do you remember i just told you always to god why brethren beloved of the lord because god has what you see your predestination did you see it from the beginning that's why when you wake up in the morning you say thank you jesus are you there because before the foundation of the world god already put a system under you are you there when the word of god comes whether you like it or not something in you pull it amen that's why brother branham said you have nothing to do to be safe nothing put your car in your chair amen because god has from the beginning chosen you to what if god have chosen you to salvation god must give you the love of the for you to be what saved so when you coming into the world he said this one you're gonna be saved where is the ship loaded go you in the night club you are dancing in the nightclub god is relaxing when the time of god comes your friend will say what happened to you no the system is activated it is your time to report to go back to your father because you are predestinated you are programmed to be saved you are programmed for the message of yahweh you don't have to force it you are not here because your brother stephen you hear because of a program god put in your life [Music] if you are not on the program you're going to hang on for a little while and you're going to get tired and you're going to leave because under god you were not under that program are you there praise the name of the lord because god has from the beginning chosen you to what through what it is already prepared for you that's six months of marriage are you there sanctification of what of the spirit and belief of what you just can't help it you have to believe the truth whether you like it or not you're gonna believe it you're gonna be obliged you're gonna be bound you're gonna be forced some people god don't care about them if you sin they lock you you don't ask forgiveness they lock you again it seems like everything you do god is kind of watching you like i'm not supposed to be doing this everybody is doing that when i do it and get in trouble yes because you a program put your car in neutral and let the creator and the master take over your life and do with your life what he predestinated you to be but the plan of him our plan of good not of evil let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for your presence this morning father thank you for this anointing and open up the windows of heaven to bless your children lord we are committing this service unto the hand may you be the alpha and the omega may the devil be completely sealed out lord and may the holy spirit and the angel of the lord father minister to your children this morning we commit them that are streaming online unto the hand lord may you also bless them lord father change the life of your children in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you as you are said i thought this sermon will be one but it turned out to be that the book of esther is a very peculiar book let's go to esther chapter one the king a hazaris thrift and esther's two banquets last week last sunday we already dealt with the first feast how many remember what the first 50s how many people are on board if you are not on board it's not my fault it's on youtube all you need is your phone amen we talk about the first feast and the second fist and we stop in the middle of the feast of the sacrifice but i want to remind you this that the bible is written in mysteries in symbols jesus thanked the father for it that he was wrought in mysteries the whole world is wrote in mysteries and only the knowledge of god can reveal it not the wrong knowledge of a man not the knowledge of brother stephen but a mystery require the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know now we spoke and explained to you this that god can't give a first revelation than a second revelation if he did he will be changing his mind god can give a revelation and then add to it and the reason why he's adding he's giving more scripture more detail more explanation is is for you to give the people more information to help them receive and understand that's why if you go to the book of revelation you'll find that revelation 1 1 is speaking about the significant angel that angel is brad branham we already preached about it if you go to revelation 3 it spoke about the seventh angel to the seven church ages that is brother branham if you go to revelation 10 7 that is brother branham if you go to revelation 18 1 the angel that come down and his light is lighting the entire world that angel is also brother branham if you go you will see a ninja standing on the sun that angel is still brother branham and you will see one of the seven engine with the seven vowel that engine also is what a branham it is one book but it gave you more detail about the ministry of guatemala so when that ministry come it's going to be easy for you to receive it everybody clear praise the name of the lord brother branham said the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how are you going to get lift yourself to the power of god how we are too close to the end now and i believe the church is in a condition where we can teach it a little deeper things to get to the power of god you need a lot of deeper things are you there and rob some of this make believer out and get into something real so to get back to the power of god we gotta get a little bit deeper in our teaching are you there now when we spoke on the second feast we found out that their feast came after the expiration of the first feast which was showing that the dispensation of god to the jewish people was expired god will never use that again because grace already took over and we found that it was a feast where all the people were invited not just the jews but he was both the jews and the gentiles and that fish took day off seven days which were typifying the gentile dispensation of seven church ages then that feast took place on the court of the garden of the palace but when we look at the decoration of the court we found out that the coat was decorated in white you remember that in green in purple in blue and all those colors were gathered together by fine lemon which was the righteousness of the sand which was speaking about the gospel but if you check on esther chapter one you'll find out that that fine landing which gathered all those color was attached to the pillar you want to see it let's read down essence chapter one verse six then i'm gonna continue where we stop if you dare you can say amen where where white is there green it's there and blue hangings are those three fastened with coats they were hooked together we've called of what fine linen which is the gospel are you there find lemon and purple for your adoption are you there to silvering and to what so all of this gospel i want you to remember that as we're moving down the world all the gospel contain three colors four actually with the purple but all those four colors were hooked to the gospel and they took those color and hooked them to the pillar so the pillars of that place were the ones that were holding the gospel i'm going to repeat it again the pillar of the court of the king where the feast of the gentiles were taking places there were some pillars and those pillars hold the gospel and in the gospel of those pillars because the pillar are part of the foundation we saw it last week those pillars that held the gospel within the gospel you got a green color a white color a blue color and a purple color which becomes adoption it's a gospel that will position the believer in the edge brother stephen we spoke and we saw that those colors represented the purity of god those color represented the what demons of god and the attitude of god so the color shows the motives of god and the attitude or the intent of god toward his people if those color represented the attitude and the motives of god what do they mean you there there is only one original color and that is white how many knows that there is only one original color anything else is mixed crust is on a solid white come on an adulterated word from the beginning amen every color will be white if some chemistry had not broken into it amen glory every church will be standing under what apostolic doctrine of them so that feast of the gentile started with white color which spoke about the apostolic doctrine of the word because the church is built upon the foundation of apostle and water and prophet and jesus christ himself being the chief everybody clear revelation chapter four brother branham say so we see him in the circle of both green amber color this is greenish what else green what represent it represent what so not only are the pillars carrying a gospel that is carrying the apostolic doctrine but that gospel is intended to give you life everybody clear life green is evergreen always stays green is what life whatever blue but a stephen but a pranam the perfect spirit of love red blue the perfect spirit of what let me drop down here he said and they come all the way down from philia agape love to feel your love on down to lust undone to the lowest this is not the time to get on to this but we're going to teach you all these kind of loves and it's going to impact your wedding your marriage and also your own life amen because there are different kind of laws amen the top one is agape then you have failure then you have a different kind of love especially young people amen now in the book of hebrew brother branham says here that this ray of light went off it was a ray of love that is the main one red the next color follow which is what blue the white so you see that those colors have the intent the attribute the motive of god to all his people so when god send his gospel in that gospel is going to bring you into perfect fellowship with god that gospel will bring you eternal life that gospel is based upon the doctrine of the apostle that god is based upon the truth because the word of god is true and you must have the love of the blue love of the truth for you to receive it amen and the purple which spoke about your position and we found out in that same quote that on the pavement of the court we also have four colors and of four colors we have founded the ministry of the antichrist so even though god is bringing the gospel by the pillars but still we are walking in the way way which is infested by demon but those demons do not have power over us we have power over them because according to luke chapter 10 we have been given power to walk over the serpent and all the power of the enemy everybody clear then that feast also implies wine which one represented the anointing of god the oil the holy spirit but the problem was in the last day of the feast in the last church ages something happened that was in revelation uh in esther chapter 10 we found out that the king sent seven chamberlain you remember that that's where our plan landed now we got to leave the airport are you there so it was seventh chamberlain that was sent to call on the bride but let's go back to chapter nine because we skipped something everybody ready don't worry we're going to take off esther chapter 1 verse 9. everybody there also vashta the queen okay we have the first feast of king hazardous which implies the jews the second feast of king and hazaras speak of the dispensation of the gentile which are the seven churches are you there the first feast of the king was dealing with the jewish people and god use israel to display his attribute or his characteristic so that those might be for our learning or our instruction everybody here when that feast expired the second feast that followed was the feast of the gentiles which have seven days which are the seven church edges where the holy spirit the wine is given everybody have a vessel diverse from another because with the gentile god deals with them individually but we found out that when the king ushered the second feast the queen faster you okay now also i shed a feast are you there so the fist of the king the second one and the fifth of the queen were both working together okay let's go to verse nine keep your seatbelt i'm taking off also vaster the queen made a feast for the the queen of faster the fists of queen vesta only have women and a woman in the bible represented what i like it are you there for the women in what the royal house which belonged to the queen where is your bible are you there the house does not belong to the queen it is the house of the king by the queen within the framework of the house of the king usher also another feast amen in the house that belongeth to king a hazaris so we found out that along the second feast when that fist is coming up where there is a king a queen queen vasta who open up a fist and her fists only include the women what does it mean by this feast you ready now as we have read the queen fastest fist or come along with the banquet of wine of the king in other words throughout the seven churches when god is deploying the holy spirit blessing filling the people under the dispensation of the holy spirit under the dispensation of the son of god the dispensation when the holy spirit is available to the gentile people there is another feast within the framework of the church the feast goes along with the church ages that feasts only include women that feast take place in the royal house which is the king's house are you there what is going on over there brother branham let's help me what about him says many symbols in the bible and god has likened his heritage here on earth his church like onto a vine he's likened them to many things like unto a woman you see vine you see a woman it's speaking about the church and this time he's speaking of his church like an unto a vine and in the vine over in kings we found a fourth vinyl and the vine look almost alike so within the womb of evil you have ken walking through and you also have able walking through when the king is having a feast for his children seven church edges there is also another vine that is having her fist within the framework of the church amen praise the name of the lord i must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion in other words spiritual matter if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine either that feast of the king and the feast of the queen intertwine are we there both of those feasts happen on the same time and both of those feasts are taking place in the same place are you following me it is composed of two parts that ain't one but our opposite they are not the same fist this feast is different than this one yet it happened on the same time in the same place cain and albert are different yet they're coming up from the same womb and their boyfriend at the same time are you there amen opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which had their root in hidden we just saw them both of those trees buff the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden remember the feast was in the court of the garden are you there and no doubt they're very branches intertwine each other thus in the ephesian church it's the sign it's that same paradox the church is made out of what good and bad two vines makes the church are you there they are like the wheat and the tears growing up side by side but one is the truth and the king has arrested the other is the force and the queen vashtia now god will speak to each one are you there so when god is speaking to the churches he doesn't only speak to the true vine he's have a message for the true vine and a message for the first vine are you there the other is false now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church are we clear and only they left we really know which is the true spirit because in the elect there is the love of the truth amen praise the name of the lord the church spoken of and spoken to in the book does not refer to the pure ecclesia they elect the body of christ the blood but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called christian are you okay ken was a believer ever was a believer can worship ever worship both of them are christian are you there whether they be true or merely nominal us all israel is not israel so all christians are not christian we okay that's what we learned that the church is made up of what tuvan the true and the false both claim to know and be known of god they all have relationship both purple to speak from god both believe certain basic truth and defer on others but since bear the name of the lord being called christian and by such name bearing obviously claim a relationship to him vasta was a queen she has a relationship with the king are you there god call it what she is a queen she is a marriage are you following me okay god now holds them both responsible to him and therefore speak to each so because they call themselves christian god is obligated to speak to both of them but one is true one is bad everybody care by the brother why does god call them these churches his churches even though they are the false the truth of the matter is that they are christian but they are not christian of the spirit we okay they are christian of the flesh they are bearing their name in them mark 7 7 habit a habit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine the commandment of men but indeed they are christian for what else could they be a is a muhammadan that is his religion no matter how he lives he leave it because he's subscribing terry to what the quran teach in other words as long as you go to church you are christian but that is not true are you there in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribed to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified died and rose that he is the savior of mankind etc we call them christians but they are not true christians they are christians of the flesh everybody clear so we found that along the feast of queen of hazzarest there is another fist the feast of investor and that fist is talking about the false vine that is progressing with the true vine duffy take revelation chapter two keep esther chapter one keep esther chapter one let's go to revelation chapter two if you remember we taught you that nicolette and opened the door to belemus you remember that embellishments opened the door to what to jezebel right when the church changes started they always talk about men men poly cop this this man man they never mentioned a woman are you there the first time they mention a woman it's a queen revelation 2 chapter 20. if you're there you can say amen notwithstanding i have a few things against you because you have permitted that woman kahu the first time a queen appeared are you there the feast was seven days it was the fist of wine it was the feast where everybody was there it was a feast that was decorated with green with white with blue and everything but suddenly in a beast of that feast they pop up they say queen vastur i have another fist in the midst of the church ages jezebel rosa are you there which call herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servant to commit fornication and to each think sacrifice to adult the king organized a feast the entire attention of the kingdom should be about the feast of the queen but this woman opened up a different fist drawing the women away from the king are we okay drop to verse 23 and i will kill her her children churches with death and all the churches shall know that i am he da search of the rain in other words of this of jezebel is gonna be an example to other churches are you there the sanction of jezebel is gonna be an example to other churches to other women are we okay jezebel rose she's calling a different fist but because she's calling in differences i'm gonna sanction her and her children the women that gather together with her but that won't be an example to the entire kingdom that this is the way the king is sanctioning a woman that rolls against him are we okay brother branham the church member the christian the church leave not again until the end of a thousand years and then they come forth to stand before the bran that's right stand before the king and the queen glory some church call herself the queen of heaven queen vacher okay the queen of heaven is the selected bride of christ and she comes with him but we find another queen that comes here organize a feast pull the women away from the kingdom and she hold the fists within the framework of the church are you there barbara a whole a woman that is of that tap it's a flat word to say among a mixed audience but the bible says that you see you and we realize that a woman that live on you to a marriage vow and you see she's supposed to be says herself call herself the queen queen vesta of heaven that won't be the bride of god god is crushed but there is another woman that is called the queen she organized the feast of the churches drop to revelation 17 [Music] are you there you're going to see that your message is all over the bible amen revelation 17 verse 4 and a woman was arraigned in purple and scarlet color and deck with gold and precious stone and pearl having a golden cup in here full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication verse five and upon her forehead was the name written mystery what the great the mother of what the mother of harlots harlots are women are you there the mother of harlot and the abomination of the earth so this queen organized a fist she organized she made an organization within the framework of the church and pulled the other church into her organization and she become the mother she's the one that gave birth to that organization of women which become harlots that happen within the framework of the church take out the chapter 20. we already left i'm still climbing amen after chapter 20 verse 28 always keep your bible verse 28 if you dare you can say amen it happened within the framework of the church take it therefore to yourself and to all the flock of the which the holy ghost has made you overseer to feed what the church of god which he has what with his own it is the church that belonged to the king of hazards are you there it does not belong to wester we okay go to first corinthians chapter six amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord first corinthians 6 20 for you are but with what therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are what it belongs to the king are you there go to chapter 7 verse 23 are you there verse 22. you are what with a price be not see you be not use the servant of what the body the church belong to king hazaris are you there but the queen organized within the framework of the church brother stephen it brings out the truth that is set for off in every age which was spoken to us by our lord with great emphasis what is the truth it is this the church system of these ages is made up of tuvan true and false god in his own sovereign purpose has put them all together it is god that permitted it calling them what the everybody there there is a dispensation of seven churches yet there is another seven churches feast that is happening with queen vaster within the premises of the church that belongs to queen of hazaris then the queen son the chamberlain and those chamberlain he sent them on the seventh day so what caused the king to send the chamberlains let's go to western now i'm going to reach my alternated are you there esther chapter 1 verse 10 on the not the first day of the feast not the second day not the third on the seventh day on the church edge of lao edition in the last church age are you there paul have wine but his wine didn't stimulate the king are you there are you there because he preached in part are you there i ran you said wine have wine mountain have wine luther have wine wesley have wine but on the seventh day there is a different wine are you there watch now on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with what so the wine of the seventh day intoxicated the king what is going on on the seventh day are you there brother branham help us decode this the power of revelation brings working and the power of revelation only come in the seventh day are you there so the stimulation of the king was a signal that there is a revelation that is coming not on the first day but on the seventh day hallelujah the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate there is power of what the revelation of them so the stimulation of the seventh day was showing that the revelation of the world will happen on the seventh day give stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction stimulation that it's vindicated it's proofed it is calling the scripture as we want to refer it a new one are we okay are you okay remember when jesus went to the feast people were drinking wine are you there when the wine was finished jesus took the water and changed it to wine when they tasted that wine they say wait a minute why was this wine all along are you there we suffer in necessity we suffer in smeaner why was this wine it was kept at the end are you there that was the one that happened in the marriage hallelujah a new one we always refer it to like that these are drunk on you one spiritual one i think the best interpretation will be spiritual one as the natural wine reveal itself in stimulated power so that's the new one as he revealed there which is there so on the seventh day there is a wine that is brought to the king and that one is a new wine and when they get the king that wine he brought a revelation [Music] he stimulated revelation when that revelation came the king was supposed to go get the queen but the king stop and hold himself and begin to call the chamberlain are you there those chamberlains except text hallelujah verse 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with one he commanded me human one vista 2 habona viktor akbarta zitor and caucus the seventh chamberlain that served in there so those chamberlain were all in the presence of the king not six chamberlain seven chamberlain seven spirits before the throne of god are you there and if you notice on the seventh day the king doesn't send one because the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be like the light of seven days the light of paul the light of arenas the light of mountain the light of columba the light of luther the light of wesley the light of mother branham all seven tumbling sent together by the king with a commandment let's go to verse 10 again on the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with one he did what so that that the chamberlain are going with a command are you there those chamberlain when they are coming those angels those seven spirits when they come they're coming with a command praise the name of the lord when you look at the word command in second test alone in 1st catalonian chapter 4 verse 16 the bible said that the lord himself shall descend with what if you check that word shout even those that have the french bubble the word shout means command are you there the word sharp means an order it means a command it means a stimulation cry like a saw a commander is giving to his soldier are you there it is a command that is sent it says the lord himself shall descend are you there king hazard stays in but it's the chamberlain that comes out are you there and if you look at those chamberlain the last one which is the seventh his name is what we have your seven angels take a second keep keeping the chapter one keep esta chapter one the entities is rich go to second thessalonians hallelujah ii thessalonians chapter one amen amen if you dare you can say amen verse seven and two and to you who are trouble rest with us when the lord jesus shall be what it's on the seventh day the stimulation of the revelation she revealed from heaven with what are you there the revelation of the lord is in heaven it is in the sky with his what maddie angel maddy and not angel maddy angel in a flaming of what which brother branham called that cloud are you there let me skip that it's the seventh spirit before the throne what are those chamberlains are you ready the spirit was the angels the seven spirit and the seven are stars the spirit was the angels that went to the star which were messenger are you there so those seven spirits that were before the throne when paul came one spirit left and went and talked to paul are you there and paul preached when i when you scum the second spirit comes are you there and speak to arenas but on the seventh day are you there not one comes the poor power because paul preached in part so they need his angel to come because paul preached important so they take the angel of paul the angel of arenas the angel of columbus the angel of mountain all the danger comes together are you there and when brother branham entered the constellation brother branham said all six were familiar he was only one carcass he was doing this are you there he was carcass who was doing this brother brother says that prince i was looking all my life i know what paul preached i know what aren't you preached i know what columbus preached but i was looking for this one and he was carcass and he looked at brother branham where is the name of the lord seven spirit cells and what the holy spirit will anoint her which was uh in his day a spirited eternal the star that was made for a purpose to reflect light in the dark of these churches where kendo and stars are representing the angel the spirit was the one that went to the star and reflect the light of the holy spirit through this star to that church everybody clear brother branham just exactly like he showed us the seven churches what would come just exactly what he showed us what would come when he set that light up there the cloud in a revelation to it to show the world when he sent there angel to reveal there are you there the seven chamberlains in the presence of the king seven messengers that have been done through there to show them because paul preaching part all of them put in part and they're left to loose end that's why they gotta call the angel of paul to be there are you there each angel coming each day and revealing the what the what it's all represented so when david comes to paul he begins to give paul the resolution he gave quote the revelation he gave paul the revelation when he want to give it all god pulled him assad he said leave paul in part where is the arrest go back when they begin to afford to arrest you before they finish their falling god says stop don't give her when you say everything come back here because on the seventh day they left over of paul the leftover of arenas the leftover of colomba the leftover of mountain the leftover of luther all those leftovers gathered together hallelujah the very what seven angels which were presented there oh the entire forward are you there and we could not even see them they didn't they took the picture not what and in revelation 10 remember in 2nd thessalonians jesus christ will reveal with what mighty angels mighty angels in revelation 10 1 the bible says another what not another angel another mighty angel are you there in revelation 10 1 he only spoke of one that was carcass because when he comes he brings the carcass with him he's descending with the word are you there and the bible says where the christian text matthew 24. amen blessed be the name of the lord [Music] you think a man can fabricate this some people or maybe online they are regretting while the book of esther was written too late too late you wish he was not there matthew 24 verse 27. for asda comes out from the what and sean to the from india to ethiopia you remember from india to what ethiopia so shadow coming off the son of men being for whatsoever duh why is that last chamberlain called carcass where the carcasses there were what brother brother where the carcasses the ego will be gathered egos not buzzer but where the fresh clean meat is the ego will gather certainly whether world eager food they shall gather pentecostal says oh there is going to be a great thing happen it is happening and they don't know it that's it yes for where the carcasses that the ego will be god just as sure as the word see that's what he says what is the carcass the word he is the the carcass is what christ are you there that's why the last chamberlain his name is what carcass what is going on with this caucus are you there go back to wester go back to esther chapter one that's why i changed my mind that says focus on chapter one you're there esther chapter one the seventh chamberlain the last one is carcass seventh chamberlain in the presence of the global of king a hazardous which are the seven spirits that are before the throne take verse 11 the purpose of the seventh chamberlain is for what verse 11 is to what queen vesta she call herself a king bring queen vastu before the king number one is to bring the queen before the king everybody clear number two bring her before the queen with what she must have a royal crown on here are you there to show to the people show to the people and the what we know the princes are israel okay you remember last week to show the princess what for she was what so when you look at queen faster she's beautiful but when she does things she's doing things contrary to the king are you there the purpose of the crowd is to bring the queen into the presence of god the purpose of the champion is to bring the queen with the crown on her head and that quran is because god wants to show the world the people and the jews who is the queen because she must be beautiful what is going on brother stephen brother branham and it's the hour hour that the world has long to see is now approaching for it cries out for redemption we can see the element ready to bring it back we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of them you see now the chamberlain comes because they need to bring a church into the presence of the thank you the oddball there is a people called the brother it's threaded too just as sure as i'm standing here god will send them a nut because the blood is threaded are you there there is a coupling that is coming but that coupling comes with a message of seven chamberlain are you there he's gonna send them a nut that shall pull the bride out of this chaos into the world the presence of king hazard are you there it shall be a word threaded mad that's why carcass is coming because carcass have the word and he need to pull the bride and bring the bread to the presence of the kingdom are we following a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before jesus appeared king hazardous jesus does all three of them when he's descending as shout commander what is the shout it is that going forth first the what to bring what it is that message going because that message need to gather the blood and bring him into the presence of the king are we clear now brother pronoun no more we could understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood seven what which is december of the seven chamberlains seven thunders of revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the glory they want to bring you into the presence of the king are you there there will be a time coming forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man that was jesus christ now the anointed people that's the brand oh my to bring back the anointed brother and the groom anointed by why accepting whatever if turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of them so the seven angel brings an anointing word to take you into the presence of the kingdom it takes the thunder to give you rapturing faith that will take you into the presence of god are we okay why the royal crown he's speaking of this great day that when the witness would come what is our crime we spoke about eternal life the what cronus so when the seventh chamberlain comes they don't take you just like that to the presence of the king are you there the seven chamberlain have a command to put the crown on top of the queen are you there are you there because the chamberlain themselves are weak are you there they are the white week that the king where when he get into judgment so when they comes they're gonna bring you eternal life that's why once the shack is separated from the wheat the baptism of the holy ghost is only to the message the crown the commission to the holy ghost rest under the seventh chamberlain no more the shock hallelujah brother madam say it's like the anointing that was on aaron bury that anointing all which you know what the anointing all does he preserve him to go in there you see now you see now so to go in the presence of god aaron must be anointed to get into the holy of holies are you there so to bring you into the presence of king ahazarez the chamberlain must crown you with the holy spirit with the baptism of the holy spirit you're a candidate to the presence of god you're a candidate to the rapture are you there see he had to be anointed with that all before he went in the presence of what god that's what the chamberlain's comes now the purpose is not only to take the bread anoint the bread but to show the bread to the world and also to the princess take matthew chapter 80. hallelujah amen see why you need to read your message matthew chapter 8 verse 10 if you're there you can say amen when jesus heard it the roman centurion he marveled and said to them that follow him verily i say to you i have not found so great faith no not in what watch verse 11 and i say to you that many shall come from the east and west to sit down with who a prince and a priest and a priest in the are we there take luke 13. that's the reason why when the rapture will happen the old testament scent that all first feast the people that were served there will come are you there they're going to be ahead of us because god not only did we do a

the power thereof there is a form here of godliness there is a form of godliness it's beautiful on the outside but it is rejecting the word like king is out there beautiful queen was that beautiful are we okay go to revelation 17 now if you dare you can say amen watch now carefully and there came who one of the seven angel which had the seven who's that angel brother branham right you remember the danger it's brother branham in revelation 18 they taught us what men see are you following me in revelation 17 the revealer angel comes to show you who is this woman truly not what your eyes see but the eyes of revelation are you following me that's why you have to understand that angel now you see why and talk with me saying come here i will show you the what of the great word that sits upon many so keep in mind that this brother branham this angel is responsible to pronounce judgment on the whole are you there because when queen vesta will refuse to go to the king somebody must pronounce his judgment keep that in mind now i am navigating are you are you there it is this angel that have the judgment not poor it's decentral no tiranius with whom the king of the earth have committed fornication and the the inhabitants of the earth have been drunk of which he has a fist are you there it fits the wine of her because she's going against the king her wine is not the wine of the king it is a wine of fornication it's a feast of master so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet cola colobist full of the name of blasphemy having seven horn and why in revelation 18 john didn't see those he takes the reveal arranger to show him in the different angle are you there in revelation 18 it's what you see beautiful church beautiful cathedral the pope beautiful quiet religious fine gold may the lord bless you are you there but when the seven angel comes he say what you call beauty come let me show you who he is i am the one that unveiled the book of revelation come and i'm gonna show you are you there you ready first four the woman was that rare in what i want you to look at the bone what's that right in what across purple check next it's called there cross check and what gold question and what look at the board and what and what where is fine running where is fine learning [Music] are you there naturally speaking fine learning that's the beauty that he's deceiving the people with him but when the angel comes and unfolds his revelation when god look at him there is no final enemy because fine linen is the righteousness of descent she doesn't have it [Music] having the form of godliness but spiritually speaking no fine learning beautiful queen vaster no character brother branham the prostitute of revelation 17 was there john d what stop jump to verse uh six and i saw the woman how drunken the king was drunken with stimulation of revelation and the queen also was are you there joking with what the false vine and with the blood of the of jesus see the seven church edges and when i saw her i wonder with great what because still she is beautiful but cruel are you there are you there john admire her because of her queen vasta are you there she was what she was she was beautiful thing brother vernon john said i look at her she was so pretty a lovely big church she had a whole bunch of churches the queen of vacher are you there quiet of vashta have a lot of women with her a lot of churches been born out of her you called oh woman come birth into my organization birth into and they become harlot are you there mother of what hollow but i look at her she was what [Music] one place in the scripture said i sit as hell queen vashta and have need off that's why she doesn't need the king are you there and john admire her look at her and look with great admiration because of the beauty of queen vacher outside because she was fair to look on are you there they have a form of godliness and would deny the power thereof they shall have big churches fun denomination and great splendor and great beauty and so forth like that if jesus said the two spirit in the last day will be so close till he will deceive the very elective possible religious people now remember outside queen vashta they have just a form of what that's when you see revelation 18 fine lining are you there you see but this two spirit the real spirit will be so close till they will deceive the very there was working side by side in the last days are you there i think it's our duty to make the inside right are you there by the grace of god to be so grateful to our god this will just not only be a beautiful building that we shall come to we need the church we need a beautiful church but brother branham say it is not just good to make the church the building looks beautiful are you there but may everyone who comes in the beautiful characteristic comes in see the beautiful characteristic of jesus christ in every person there may be a consequent place to our lord a consecrated what for no man they have beautiful destruction that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of a woman the beauty of the church is what of them i shall trust that to always be the house of god of what so the beauty that chamberlain are coming to look for is the character of that's why young men dress right catch your hair no more don't make your hair look like the one on the street don't leave your beard disorder like those on the street are you there because the beauty of this church is your character whatever you do on facebook whatever you do in the feast whatever you do in weddings whatever way you play and dance that is the beauty of this church it is your character the way you dress are you there his church everything really beautiful probably a lot more beautiful but god does not dwell in what made by what the beauty of holiness is where god dwells where the power of the holy spirit god is looking for what not membership what else when he went to get the bread for isaac he sweared out until he farmed haunt me my bread god bless your heart i am looking for members i am looking for a pure in what somebody that shall believe that somebody that would respect my command because when the chamberlain came they say queen vasta the king needs you she say no [Music] yet beautiful but rebellious are you there let's go back to the book of esther and we're going to head to the airport hallelujah let's go back to the book of esther i hope we can finish yesterday one let's hurry are you there verse 12 queen vesta refused to come at what she refused to commit what by refusing to come to the king's commandment what does it mean if the king gives you a command you refuse what does it mean take john chapter 14. let the bible interpret the bible john chapter 14 if you dare you can say amen once we cross here then we go to the airport are you there john chapter verse 15. are you there she was a queen she is she was in love with the king she loved the king right they were in love but when the king called her she refused did she really love the king let's see she refused the commandment john 14 14 john 14 15 are you there if you do what did she love the king you see now i'm reading to you the scripture jump to verse 21 he that has my from the chamberlain and do it and keep the message he did that what so to prove to god that you love him you must stay with the message of the hour because the message of the hour is the shout out is the commandment of the king you see you love christ you love christ but you don't love christ you are rejecting the chamberlain you are rejecting the cloud you are calling the cloud the rocket you are calling the chamberlain a rocket while it's the chamberlain that came to take you to the presence of the king denying the picture of the cloud it's a lack of love but it's not surprised because the love of the truth was not even in you [Music] are you there he that has my commandment and keeps them he this that loves me and he that loves me shall be loves of mine and i will love him and will myself in what so by standing for the world all you need to do put your car in youtube because god has a responsibility to manifest himself through your life do you get it go to john 15. go to john 15 verse 10. are you there if you want did queen vastner keep the commandment if you what keep my commandment you shall what even as i have kept my father commandment and abiding his job to verse 14 you are my if you do whatsoever i do what so she was neither a wife no love and no friendship i'm reading the bible are you there verse 15 here after i call you not for the servant knows not what this lord does but i have called you what for all that i have heard of my father i have made known to you i send you the seventh chamberlain i give you the complete word watch verse 16. you have not so now it's the king who's going to choose somebody else you okay now now queen the faster is rejected now there is another choice that open you have not chosen me but i have what predestination and who do what predestinated you that you should go and bring forth it is not you that bring the fruit you were programmed to bring fruit are you there and that your fruit should what that whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name i will want you see how easy that is one more first john chapter two hallelujah first john chapter two verse three if you dare you can say amen first john chapter two verse three are you there watch this clearly somebody is still flipping the pages are you there and hereby we do know that we know him if we do it so the commandment came by the chamberlain for you to prove to me that you know god that you have a relationship with god you must keep the commandment first four he that says i know him and keep not he's rejected the chamberlain he's here so if you reject the message you are here you see now because god will give you a spirit of delusion to believe into her until you become yourself here a liar and the truth is not in but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god do what hereby know we that we are in if you keep the commandment of the devil she fell her face she had no head she was going to her head amen that's rebecca a woman it's her nature a woman to surrender to a man let me repeat it again a nature of a woman is to surrender to a man queen vesta refuses it's the nature of the church to surrender to who surrender to his will surrender just surrender she has not thinking of her home she take his word which is the command not somebody else if eve would have done that we have never had to die but she listened to reasoning but the real bread of christ take their headship of christ which is the seventh chamberlain because when the seven chamberlains came when we move the picture it is their head the head of christ the headship are you there the headship of christ which is there and only believes god that is real they restore brad hallelujah are you there now let's finish here and go to them drop to the airport go back to mr chapter one hallelujah go back to essex chapter one everybody awake so stay awake because we're gonna head to the airport and we go to lane take esther chapter one by the chamberlain verse 12 but the queen vasta refused they come to commit the commands of of the king's command no love no friendship by his chamberlain rejected the message therefore was the king very angry remember in the book of matthew when they sent the people and they refused the king was angry you remember yesterday okay wester have the position of a queen now her position is going to be taken away and somebody else is going to fit in that position verse 13 then the king said to the what the chamberlain were the seventh spirit the seven angels before the throne of god and their mission is to go to the seven messenger and speak to the messenger there is a difference between the seven chamberlain and the seven messenger the seven chamberlain are the seven spirit that anoints the earthly messenger of the seven church ages but the king called wise men there is a wisdom here wise men wise men brother stephen wiseman let me leave isaiah 11 for the sake of time take proverbs 9. you can read that say 11 yourself keep keep your finger on estee one because we're coming back take proverbs chapter 9. are you there you need to wake up because i don't want to land and then you wake up while i'm landing you're gonna hear boom because the airplane just hit the ground so stay alert are you there proverb chapter one the king called who wiseman mother of it always foiled it are you there proverb chapter one remember the beginning i told you that there are three colors you okay green white blue and purple they were tied to find lemon are you there and they were hooked to pillars so the pillars were the one holding the gospel yes somebody got it there okay sister got it your sister got it now okay i'm waiting for others to get their dynamo on okay let's go to verse nine wisdom wise men first one wisdom has built huh [Music] she has you not how go back to esther chapter one we found out that god called wisely the king of hazaris the wisdom of god have a house and the house of the wisdom of god have seven pillars that hold it not six seven pillars but we found out that the gospel of the king jesus were hooked to the pillars and it was seven pillars that held the gospel let's go back to western now chapter 13. then the king said to the wise men which knew the time for so was the king's manner toward all that knew the law in judgment verse 14 the next to him those wise men was corsina can somebody say wonder shita there why are seven wise men and there are seven princes of persia and those wise men are pillars are you there seven princes of pleasure and media which soda they are the one the reason why they see the king face because the angel that work with them always behold the face of the father amen hallelujah jesus said offend not the little children because they enjoy behold there in other words in in front of god there's angel of the children looking they say don't whip that child because his angel look at god and we find there were seven spirits that looked to the face of god but those seven spirits have seven messenger that they anoint and those seven messenger sees the king first through the seven chamberlains are you there he called them i want you to notice who was the last one memocan he was the seventh one the seventh chamberlain was carcass but the last seven priests was memocan the seventh church edge messenger which sees the king face because the seven angels speak to them and the seven angels are the seventh spirit that see the throne of god are you there but we are in the seventh day it is not the day of paul it is not the day of arenas it is not the day of columbus it is the day of god branham but that day seven is carcass from heaven but on the earth the one who need to speak must be seven you okay i'm maneuvering toward the airport verse 15 and what shall we do to queen vesta remember in the book of revelation 17 the one who have the judgment of the whole okay not paul okay the king is calling the judgment he said wise man comes i need to know how am i going to punish deal with this woman what shall we do to the queen vasa according to the law because she has not performed the commandment of king a hazaris by there she refused rejected the cloud the message verse 16 and who why didn't the first answer why didn't the second answer why only mamukan has to speak are you there at the voice of the seven engine only memo can have to speak because it's the time of carcass the time where the crowd comes seven engine that is coming on heaven on the earth the seven messenger must be there to speak are you there are you there it's seven pillars those pillars carry the gospel but we are dealing with the last pillar over there it's carcass who is the seventh are you there but over here it's memocan who speak of today it's revelation 10 1. over here is revelation 10 7. are you there it is the cloud of seventh chamberlain with carcass but on the earth it's memocan which is the last messenger are you there seven and seven are we clear there's seven here which is the seventh seal and the messenger to the seventh seal is the seventh angel hallelujah hallelujah look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this heart tracking from the seventh angel memo messenger of the carcass you understand now message in revelation so revelation 10 1 carcass but conquest is another matthew because they are seven jesus will reveal in heaven with essentia with seven chamberlain carcass is just another mighty engine but he's a carcass because he's the word but then when he come as he's descending there must be a seven-incher waiting for him mehmukhan must be there because mamu can receive the seventh seal that's why when brother branham entered the constellation brother branham said all the six were familiar but he was only caucus that's the one that have the best like this because i'm more interested to the seven because it's seven to seven let's go to verse 16 then you're gonna hear the the wheel of the airplane and member can answer before the king and the princes faster the queen he's the one giving the judgment of the you see now the seven ninja with the seventh player i say faster the queen has not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes to all the people that are in all the prophecies of the king of hazaris are you there for this deed of the queen shall come abroad to alder remember in the church ages jezebel i must punish her to give an example to all all the churches right okay so that they were they shall disperse their husband in their eyes respect marriage and divorce when it shall be reported the king of hearts is commanded for faster the queen to be brought in before him but she came not jump to verse 19. and if he please the king who's talking everybody is quiet because it's on the seventh day only the seventh angels speak on the seventh day it is the age of malachi 4. luke 17 30 revelation 10 1-7 revelation 18 genesis 18 zechariah 14 john 14 12. if he please the king my airplane is doing this that's why i'm trying to to to go down hallelujah if he please the king then let there go a word a commandment of the king who's talking who gave him the signet to speak of jeroboam who gave him that let go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the law of the persian and medies that he be not what in other words put a mark and never change that ayah mukhan i'm speaking he's bringing the judgment to cain he's bringing the mark upon cain are you there that faster come what and cain left the presence of the lord amen because ken rejected the word of god no more can have to come in the presence of god are you there queen vashta rejected the king no more queen vasta have to be accepted in the presence of the king she is marked with the mark of the beast it's coming from memocana put that and never change it in other words no redemption it's coming from the lips of memocam because under the white wing of the chamberlain he's preaching indictment mehmukhan is preaching indictment indicting the generation and the church for the second crucifixion of the christ because vassa and the women rejected the king they crucified the message that memocon is indicting them under the seventh chamberlain hallelujah that faster come no more mark that vasta come no more before the king answer it and let the king give her uh to another that is better than mehmukhan is putting that down i will make him a signet zero babel job to verse 22 verse job to verse 21 and the saying please there and all the seven angels say yes and the king did according to the word of what so when the letter comes it is the king but the one who spoke is memocan are you there watch verse 22 for he send what into all the all the word

to every country to every churches to every people to every professor to the entire world and giving to the people we hit the airport let's stand are you there that every man should bear rule of what his own house because it's gentile and that should be what read it again that it should be what publication spoken word the publication brother kelly publication it should be published what are we publishing the message of memo publish according to what of what that's why there is stress selection of the message going on to india going on to africa in spanish in south america in europe in canada all those publication is the message of memo khan mehmukhan is the one speaking on the seventh day he's speaking because carcass come the cloud came brought southern ninja it's the time of mehmukhan and his message must be put together all of this in the bible that was your second fist of queen of king a hazaris this is israel this one is the second king of the gentile it's gonna end with mehmukhan the last day of the feast the message of mehmukhan is gonna go all over the world amen by those that rejected the message you get the mark of the beast you turn your back on god what do you do then seal yourself away and take the mark of the beast and go off like candid from the presence of the king queen faster no more to see the king anymore it shall be light in the evening time that's right while evening lights are shining why do you receive it why do you come to it why don't you come to it don't be silly don't sit dead believe on the lord jesus christ and be still into the kingdom what is the mark of the beast to reject the holy ghost coming up to the knowledge of the truth seeing that they see the truth and see the knowledge of it see it's here see it working see it's right have the knowledge of the truth and to turn away again the remainder of no more sacrifice just like kane at the beginning so will it be at the end and will be marked and will be marked away from the presence of god and be a baptist away from the presence of god presbyterian away from the presence of god pentecostal by denomination only the rest of their days they shall serve their denomination instead of serving christ serve their creed then from there on the door open up where we pick up esther and este comes to the custody of higa because we need a bride amen and then that
