[37:09] glory to God verse six if you dare you
[37:12] can say Amen
[37:13] I can't preach
[37:15] somebody else is preaching but I gotta
[37:18] read this amen the Bible say for thou
[37:22] art a holy people
[37:24] unto the Lord that God
[37:26] and the Lord that God has chosen thee to
[37:29] be how
[37:31] say to somebody I'm special
[37:35] we are the Royal Seed of Abraham
[37:40] I want you to start believing this thing
[37:46] we showed you Prosperity the two side of
[37:49] it the reason evil side and the correct
[37:52] side of it we're talking about the
[37:54] correct side that's why brother Branham
[37:56] say Prosperity is not always
[37:59] because it depends on the source
[38:03] amen he said that you are be to be a
[38:07] special people unto who
[38:09] above water
[38:11] that are upon the face of the water so
[38:14] the blood is different
[38:18] my wife is special
[38:22] and the blood of Jesus Christ is
[38:24] pressure
[38:26] you must believe it remember what I told
[38:29] you even if you receive hours should I
[38:31] will push it until you receive it
[38:37] we should be happy
[38:40] happiness is a person
[38:42] Joy is a person
[38:45] and if that person is in your heart you
[38:48] remember what brother Branham say on
[38:49] Sunday he said get Jesus in your heart
[38:51] and be blessed
[38:55] because wherever he is everything
[38:57] blossom
[38:58] amen
[39:00] verse 7 the bible says the Lord did not
[39:05] set his love upon you no chose you
[39:08] because you were more in number than any
[39:10] people for ye were the fewest
[39:19] amen that Minority verse 8 but because
[39:23] the Lord did water
[39:24] [Applause]
[39:25] the love of God
[39:27] and because he would keep the oath which
[39:31] he has sown unto your fathers the has
[39:34] the Lord brought you out of with a
[39:36] mighty hand and redeem you out of the
[39:39] house of born men from the hand of
[39:41] pharaoh king of water
[39:43] we were in bondage of sin
[39:46] all of us God redeemed you why because
[39:48] he loved you why you were yet sinner
[39:51] Christ died for you
[39:56] now you got to swallow this
[39:58] job to verse 10.
[40:02] and we payth damned I hate him
[40:06] to their face
[40:08] to destroy them he will not be slacked
[40:12] to him that hated him he will repay him
[40:14] to his face you there
[40:17] Thou shalt therefore keep the
[40:19] Commandments and the statute and the
[40:22] Judgment which are commended to do them
[40:24] wherefore it shall come to pass if you
[40:28] hearken
[40:29] to this judgment Kama and keep and do
[40:33] them Kama that the Lord that God shall
[40:36] do what
[40:37] keep unto did the Covenant and the mercy
[40:40] which he swear unto their fathers
[40:43] watch this and he will do what
[40:46] and do what
[40:50] who's blessing you who love you
[40:53] he will love thee and bless thee and
[40:57] multiply thee
[41:00] Say Amen
[41:02] he will also bless the fruit of that
[41:05] womb and the fruit of that land that
[41:09] corn and that wine and that oil the
[41:13] increase of that Khan and the flock of
[41:15] the sheep in the land which he swear
[41:18] unto the father to do water
[41:21] swallow this one that shall be blessed
[41:24] above all
[41:26] there shall not be male or female
[41:30] bearing among you and among your water
[41:33] so the blessing doesn't stop to human
[41:36] being
[41:39] it started from human beings but he also
[41:43] goes to the Qatar so whatever you
[41:47] possess must be blessed as you are
[41:50] blessed

[53:27] my brother I believe God is going to do
[53:29] something for us tonight yes God said
[53:31] that he would he promised that he would
[53:33] but you know what it's got to be you got
[53:35] to come to the place you can't be
[53:36] assignment but you got to be that little
[53:38] woman and you got to come to him with
[53:40] your Alabaster Box yes you got to take
[53:42] everything that you have yes sir promise
[53:44] whatever you give him he will be amen
[53:46] greater in return
[53:48] amen you may be seated tonight if you
[53:50] would like and we'll read a couple
[53:52] scriptures here but in First Peter 1
[53:54] through 18 you know the blood purchased
[53:56] our Redemption it says for as much as
[53:58] you know that you were not redeemed with
[54:00] corruptable things that's silver and
[54:02] gold from your vain conversation
[54:03] received by tradition from your fathers
[54:06] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[54:09] a lamb without blemish and without spot
[54:11] who was verily foreordained amen
[54:14] hallelujah before the foundation of the
[54:17] world but was manifest in these last
[54:19] times for you amen it brought us now
[54:22] into him in Ephesians 2 it said that at
[54:25] that time ye were without Christ being
[54:27] aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel
[54:30] and strangers from the covenants of
[54:33] Promise having no hope and without God
[54:35] in the world but now amen how many
[54:37] single for the but now in Christ Jesus
[54:40] you were sometimes who were who were
[54:42] afar off or made nigh by what by the
[54:46] blood of Christ in Ephesians 1 but one
[54:48] four through seven it says according as
[54:50] he has chosen Us in him before the
[54:53] foundation of the world I want you to
[54:55] know it says this is an eternal blood
[54:56] yes this ain't just like a partial blood
[54:59] or a time from time to blood but this is
[55:01] an eternal blood before the foundation
[55:03] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[55:06] before him yes sir having predestinated
[55:08] us unto the adoption of children amen
[55:11] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[55:13] good pleasure yes sir his wheelchair so
[55:16] this blood that he shed was not just for
[55:18] something that we wanted but this was
[55:19] something that he wanted for us
[55:22] of the glory of his grace where he hath
[55:25] made us accepted yes I tell you what
[55:27] there's a lot of places in life that I
[55:29] haven't been accepted but I'm so glad to
[55:31] know tonight that I've been accepted in
[55:33] the Beloved yes sir in whom we have
[55:36] Redemption through what our works no no
[55:38] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[55:41] sins according to the riches of his
[55:43] grace and one more here in Romans 5 6
[55:46] and 9 a high for when we were yet
[55:48] without strength that's right in due
[55:50] time Christ died for the ungodly so
[55:53] listen church I if I could tie this in
[55:55] this was a before the foundation of the
[55:58] world Amen this was something where God
[56:00] seen you he knew you were without
[56:01] strength listen God didn't wait for you
[56:03] to work yourself up before he applied
[56:05] the blood to you no but as he loved you
[56:08] in due time yes died for the ungodly
[56:11] first scarcely for a righteous man will
[56:13] one die yet prayer adventure for a good
[56:15] man some would even dare to die right
[56:17] but God committed his love toward us yes
[56:20] while we were yet sinners died for us
[56:23] amen much more than being now justified
[56:25] by what by his blood we shall be saved
[56:30] from wrath through him yes my brother
[56:33] it's all him yes sir him yes what he's
[56:36] done before the foundation of the Lord
[56:38] that's right his blood not my blood his
[56:40] blood yes sir his blood yes my brother
[56:43] now glory to God if we look at this I
[56:46] want to say this it's always been the
[56:48] blood amen it's always been the blood
[56:51] ever since the Book of Genesis you will
[56:54] find the blood yes always be in the
[56:56] blood yes if you take out the blood you
[56:58] take out the Bible that's it it's always
[57:00] been the blood preach my brother now
[57:02] when Adam and Eve had sin in the
[57:05] beginning and they had they they had
[57:07] done this great sin and they had begun
[57:08] to fallen and you know they actually
[57:10] need to even come before God so God that
[57:13] could pronounce judgment on them right
[57:15] but you know they couldn't even come
[57:16] into the presence of God until they had
[57:19] a covering a covering for their sin so
[57:22] you know the way that man is we always
[57:24] think well I've got to build myself up
[57:26] or do something to be able to get back
[57:29] into the presence of God so so they
[57:31] begin to tie all these things together
[57:33] and they begin to get these fig leaves
[57:35] and they they begin to get their own
[57:36] ideas and how they could cover
[57:38] themselves and maybe maybe Eve would
[57:40] look at Adam and say do I look good he
[57:42] said yeah that's fine and then he would
[57:43] try to cover him his own ideas and they
[57:46] would begin to talk one another into
[57:47] that they were finally good enough to go
[57:49] back in the presence of God but as soon
[57:51] as God saying them he said we can't have
[57:54] a conversation like this I can't have a
[57:56] talk like this
[58:00] he took that blood of that lamb and he
[58:04] took those sea it took blood ever since
[58:06] the beginning yes sir take that lamb and
[58:08] he was would begin to apply that that
[58:10] clothing on there that would cover their
[58:12] shoes
[58:13] yes my brother
[58:15] glory to God now yes sir we can see this
[58:19] how this would go down through the
[58:20] children when when Cain and Abel would
[58:23] begin to want to make a sacrifice right
[58:24] God
[58:26] and Cain would begin to get all of his
[58:28] works and all the beautiful things that
[58:30] he could make and all the things that he
[58:31] could grow from the ground and he could
[58:33] be saying to say look how many beautiful
[58:34] sermons I've preached and how many
[58:36] places I've went and the things I've
[58:38] done and this that and the other but you
[58:40] see when he brought that to God God was
[58:42] not pleased with that do you know why
[58:43] because there wasn't no blood in it not
[58:45] like that there wasn't no blood in it
[58:47] but he comes able with this humble
[58:49] sacrifice and he begins to drag a lamb
[58:51] and Abel begins to realize I'm a guilty
[58:54] person that's my guilty human being I
[58:56] was born into this I didn't have a
[58:58] choice I was born came in the world
[59:01] speaking lies shape and iniquity
[59:03] something innocent had to die in his
[59:05] place and he would take that lamb and he
[59:08] would slay it and God was pleased
[59:10] because as that blood would begin to
[59:12] speak out it would begin to bleed and it
[59:14] would begin to cry as the life would
[59:16] begin to leave it and that Old Testament
[59:19] type yes saying you're covered amen
[59:21] you're covered our sins are covered
[59:24] that's right you it's my brother the
[59:27] medicine all through the Old Testament
[59:28] they offered the blood of lambs and
[59:30] goats sheep that's the heifers a
[59:32] substitutionary death that's exactly all
[59:34] in the great economy of God way back in
[59:37] his mind the real object was coming
[59:39] which would be said then were Shadows of
[59:41] the real object that was to come the
[59:43] real object to come was his only
[59:46] begotten son yes sir all the Lambs that
[59:49] died was only a shadow and a shadow is
[59:51] only the negative side of an object I
[59:54] only spoke of the coming day of Calvary
[59:56] that's right in Hebrews 10 it says for
[59:59] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:00:01] to come yes and not the very image of
[1:00:03] the things
[1:00:04] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:00:07] year continually make the comer there
[1:00:10] unto perfect and how many knows Jesus
[1:00:12] would tell them be therefore perfect
[1:00:14] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:00:16] and we know that God is a just God and
[1:00:19] he would never require something out of
[1:00:21] you that you could not obtain amen amen
[1:00:25] for when they and not have ceased to be
[1:00:27] offered because the worshiper once
[1:00:29] purged should have no more conscience of
[1:00:31] sin now that word there is desire
[1:00:33] because we know that we are conscious of
[1:00:36] the sins of the worlds and the different
[1:00:37] things but it's not your desire to sin
[1:00:39] anymore that's the way it should be
[1:00:41] that's the Old Testament lamb worked
[1:00:43] like it was supposed to you should have
[1:00:45] no more conscience of sin but you see
[1:00:47] these people had the same thoughts they
[1:00:50] had the same problems year after year
[1:00:52] because it was just a covering it was no
[1:00:54] we'll get to it but it was just a
[1:00:56] covering amen
[1:00:58] keep on moving my brother but in those
[1:01:00] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:01:03] made of sin every year now listen here's
[1:01:05] the reason why the life of the animal
[1:01:07] could not come back on the believer
[1:01:09] that's it the animal doesn't have a soul
[1:01:12] you know they're still they're still out
[1:01:13] there scientists different things trying
[1:01:15] to to inbreed the human race with animal
[1:01:18] life but they cannot do it because that
[1:01:20] animal does not have a soul but we have
[1:01:22] a soul so what are you saying brother
[1:01:24] Sith what I'm saying is it would take a
[1:01:26] Kinsmen Redeemer it would take her own
[1:01:29] life to be if I can say this way it
[1:01:31] would take the life of a human being to
[1:01:33] be bred into the believer that's exactly
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:39] the laugh that animal could not come
[1:01:41] back on the believer because it was
[1:01:42] animal life if it could if it could
[1:01:44] cover him but the blood couldn't change
[1:01:47] him same desires year after year those
[1:01:49] Lambs couldn't be akinson Redeemer
[1:01:51] because it was animal life and not the
[1:01:54] Seed of Abraham now listen in Hebrews 2
[1:01:57] 16 it said for verily he took not on
[1:02:00] them the nature of angels no sir but he
[1:02:03] took on him the Seed of Abraham
[1:02:04] wherefore in all things that behooved
[1:02:07] him to be made like unto his brother and
[1:02:09] that he might be a merciful right and
[1:02:13] faithful High priests and things
[1:02:15] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:02:18] for the sins of the people so they're
[1:02:20] saying a lamb this is a person this is a
[1:02:23] Kinsman this is what we needed and it
[1:02:26] says in verse 4 now breaking back into
[1:02:27] Hebrews 10. it says for it is not
[1:02:29] possible it's not even possible that the
[1:02:33] blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:02:35] away sins
[1:02:37] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:02:39] he says sacrifice and offer is thou what
[1:02:41] is not but a body hast thou prepared and
[1:02:43] burned of it can sacrifice for sin thou
[1:02:45] had no pleasure then said I lo I come in
[1:02:48] the volume of the book that is written
[1:02:50] of me to do thou Will O God above when
[1:02:53] he said sacrifices and offerings and
[1:02:56] burn offings and offerings for sin thou
[1:02:58] wouldest not neither had his pleasure in
[1:03:00] them which are offered by the law then
[1:03:02] he said lo I come to do thy will o God
[1:03:04] he taketh away the first he taken away
[1:03:08] the first that he may establish the
[1:03:12] second by which we are Sanctified that's
[1:03:16] right through the offering of the body
[1:03:18] of Jesus Christ
[1:03:21] once for all amen amen Jesus didn't have
[1:03:26] to come back year after year
[1:03:28] to make this sacrifice because when this
[1:03:31] sacrifice was so powerful that the one
[1:03:34] time you see those sacrifices that they
[1:03:36] made of those those bulls and goats and
[1:03:38] Lambs year after year it never appeased
[1:03:41] God it never pleased him but this one
[1:03:43] sacrifice that Christ Jesus made
[1:03:48] amen forever
[1:03:50] eternally for our Redemption for us God
[1:03:53] was so pleased with the sacrifice
[1:03:57] Hallelujah
[1:04:00] and every high priest every priest
[1:04:03] standeth daily ministering and offering
[1:04:05] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:04:08] never take away sins but this man after
[1:04:11] he had offered one sacrifices for sins
[1:04:14] forever sat down on the right hand of
[1:04:16] God henceforth expecting till his
[1:04:19] enemies be made his footstool for by one
[1:04:22] offering that's it he hath made good
[1:04:25] enough no no no he has perfected forever
[1:04:30] them that are Sanctified where of the
[1:04:32] Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for
[1:04:35] after that he said before this is the
[1:04:37] Covenant that I will make with them
[1:04:39] after those days saith the Lord I I love
[1:04:42] this because I'm always trying to hate
[1:04:45] on the message and say you know you're
[1:04:46] just trying to live a too holy of a life
[1:04:48] or this and the other but this is what
[1:04:50] God said he was going to do this is the
[1:04:53] Covenant that I will make with them
[1:04:54] after these days saith the Lord I will
[1:04:57] put my laws into their hearts and in
[1:04:59] their minds will I write them listen I
[1:05:01] can't help being this way I've got the
[1:05:03] Holy Ghost I can't help being this way
[1:05:06] I've got the Holy Ghost you live however
[1:05:08] you want to listen the reason that they
[1:05:11] had those problems year after year
[1:05:13] because men of old were moved by the
[1:05:15] Holy Ghost we ain't moved by the Holy
[1:05:18] Ghost but in these last days he would
[1:05:21] pour out his Spirit hallelujah we're not
[1:05:24] moved by the Holy Ghost but this end
[1:05:26] time bride is full of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:34] I am what I am
[1:05:37] we are what we are
[1:05:39] you don't have to beg me to get out of
[1:05:40] bed and go to church you don't have to
[1:05:42] beg me to get here sir I am who I am
[1:05:44] listen I'm not just moved by the Holy
[1:05:46] Ghost service but I'm full of the Holy

[1:08:20] better things than that of Abel
[1:08:23] Hallelujah so what was it we can look at
[1:08:25] the Old Testament right and we can begin
[1:08:28] to look at the Old Testament and we can
[1:08:30] see what that blood would do that blood
[1:08:32] would cover their sins but it would
[1:08:33] never take away their sins it was just a
[1:08:36] covering that just like in the garden
[1:08:38] they were able to it was just good
[1:08:40] enough to appease the wrath of God that
[1:08:42] they could come back into his presence
[1:08:44] but it never took away the sin it never
[1:08:46] took away the desire but you see the
[1:08:49] blood of the New Testament let's just
[1:08:51] look at this for a second let's go look
[1:08:53] at the Old Testament and let's go look
[1:08:55] at Abraham for a minute under the blood
[1:08:57] of the Old Testament
[1:08:59] well look in Genesis and we'll begin to
[1:09:01] look at Abraham and we begin to look at
[1:09:03] Abraham we begin to see how it was wrote
[1:09:05] how Abraham staggered at the promise of
[1:09:08] God in the Old Testament you say what do
[1:09:10] you mean mother said well let's look at
[1:09:12] it it said one time that there was a
[1:09:14] king that desired to be with Sarah
[1:09:16] not just once but twice
[1:09:20] and both times Abraham lied Abraham came
[1:09:24] out under the blood of the Old Testament
[1:09:26] when when I believe it was Moses begin
[1:09:28] to wrote right he began to write out all
[1:09:30] the mistakes of Abraham and all the
[1:09:33] things that Abraham did wrong why
[1:09:34] because he could see it under that
[1:09:36] sacrificial blood of the other of the
[1:09:39] natural lamb he could see all the
[1:09:41] problems oh my we could we could look at
[1:09:43] Sarah and he would begin to write and
[1:09:45] Sarah laughed in the tent behind
[1:09:48] under that blood Moses could see that
[1:09:51] but glory to God
[1:09:54] in the New Testament here when Paul
[1:09:57] would begin to write that's about
[1:09:59] Abraham yes Sarah yes
[1:10:03] and all the different ones yes
[1:10:06] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:10:10] God

[1:11:16] better things
[1:11:18] the blood is speaking then the blood has

[1:13:00] preacher I know I want to say this
[1:13:04] I have a voice
[1:13:07] talking that microphone he has a voice
[1:13:10] but Solomon has a voice
[1:13:13] but listen there's one there's many
[1:13:15] voices
[1:13:17] there's many voices in the world
[1:13:19] but there's one true voice
[1:13:29] there's one true voice
[1:13:32] and that's not my voice
[1:13:34] it's not your voice that's not brother
[1:13:37] Solomon's voice it's the holy spirit's
[1:13:39] voice
[1:13:42] and you know what did Brother Branham
[1:13:44] say
[1:13:45] he said if there if the blood speaks
[1:13:48] the blood must have a voice
[1:13:50] and what is that voice he said it's the
[1:13:53] word
[1:13:56] so I want to say this we hear many
[1:14:00] voices

[1:14:06] that'll say you're not good enough
[1:14:09] there's voices out there

[1:14:37] doctor says well this is wrong with you
[1:14:39] and that's wrong with you and you can't
[1:14:41] overcome this and you can't overcome
[1:14:43] that but if you begin to listen to the
[1:14:46] blood and you begin to hear the blood
[1:14:48] speak if you get close enough and you
[1:14:50] tune your ear in you'll begin to hear
[1:14:53] but he was wounded for my transgressions
[1:14:55] he was bruised for my iniquity you see
[1:14:59] the blood is speaking better things yes
[1:15:01] my brother
[1:15:04] the chastisement of my peace was upon
[1:15:06] him that's right I'm not feeling good in
[1:15:09] my flesh but I'm hearing something

[1:15:19] Healed yes and the blood's speaking yes
[1:15:23] better things it's speaking better
[1:15:25] things than what this body's saying your
[1:15:27] body's speaking and saying I'm hurting
[1:15:29] I'm not feeling good I don't think I can
[1:15:31] go any further but the blood's saying
[1:15:33] you're an overcomer
[1:15:36] glory to God the blood's saying who
[1:15:39] shall separate us yes

[1:15:47] brother who shall separate us from the
[1:15:49] love of Christ shall tribute tribulation
[1:15:52] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:15:56] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[1:15:59] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:16:00] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[1:16:03] for the slaughter but nay in all these
[1:16:06] things
[1:16:07] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:16:11] that loved us
[1:16:13] for I'm persuaded
[1:16:16] yes sir you imagine all the voices that
[1:16:20] Paul heard you killed Christians Paul

[1:16:28] Believers you've done this you Perse
[1:16:30] persecuted the church all these
[1:16:33] different times but there was another
[1:16:34] voice that he heard on the road to
[1:16:37] Damascus one time that he said Paul I've
[1:16:40] called you I've chosen you you're gonna
[1:16:42] preach to the Gentiles so you know what
[1:16:44] one day he was in his study right there
[1:16:47] and he began to write something down and
[1:16:49] he began to hear a voice and he began to
[1:16:51] write for I am persuaded that neither
[1:16:54] death nor life your angels your
[1:16:56] principalities your powers your things
[1:16:59] present nor things that come nor high
[1:17:01] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:17:04] be able
[1:17:06] to separate us from the love of God
[1:17:09] which is in Christ Jesus our lord Paul
[1:17:12] didn't say the troubles wouldn't come
[1:17:13] Paul didn't say you wouldn't have hard
[1:17:15] days but he said this nay and all these
[1:17:18] things you're going to be more than a
[1:17:20] conqueror he said I don't care what
[1:17:22] you're going through I don't care how
[1:17:23] bad it is you can't separate my love
[1:17:26] from the situation you might be going
[1:17:28] through situations but it's love is
[1:17:31] unseparable through the situation

[1:20:06] getting ready to be kicked out he said
[1:20:08] who told you that God said so
[1:20:14] God said so and you know what we learned

[1:20:20] learned is the very Earth that we are
[1:20:22] standing on is because God said so amen

[1:21:06] Christ had him on all the qualities for
[1:21:09] the father was in the son the father was
[1:21:12] in the son reconciling the world to
[1:21:15] himself and when he met Satan he never
[1:21:17] used his power
[1:21:19] he proved that the weakest of Christian
[1:21:22] that's it you might feel like the
[1:21:24] weakest of Christian in here tonight
[1:21:29] that the weakest of Christians
[1:21:32] could defeat Satan when Satan come to
[1:21:36] him and said now if you're the son of
[1:21:39] God

[1:22:01] the men shall not live by bread alone
[1:22:03] but but every word that proceedeth out
[1:22:06] of the mouth God said so of God yes sir

[1:23:44] why'd you choose that scripture because
[1:23:46] I can relate with that why'd you choose
[1:23:49] that quote because I can relate with
[1:23:51] that you say what he's saying
[1:23:54] we had we had meetings probably five or
[1:23:56] six years ago
[1:23:58] and I was playing a softball game a
[1:24:00] church softball game and I ended up
[1:24:01] hurting my wrist and that wrist was
[1:24:03] hurting me so bad and week after week it
[1:24:05] didn't get better and you know bro uh
[1:24:08] brother Timothy Pruitt was preaching at
[1:24:10] the church was some meetings that we had
[1:24:11] so I went to that meeting and I was
[1:24:13] sitting there in that meeting and I
[1:24:15] began to think about my wrist and how
[1:24:17] bad it hurt and how I was going to get
[1:24:19] the insurance card from dad because I
[1:24:21] just couldn't take it anymore I said you
[1:24:22] know I was looking at the hand I was
[1:24:25] looking at the problem I was looking at
[1:24:27] the symptoms I was looking at how bad it
[1:24:28] hurt but here I was in the church
[1:24:30] service and the spirit of God at the end
[1:24:32] of service you could feel the waves just
[1:24:34] coming through kind of like we felt
[1:24:36] tonight but you could feel the waves
[1:24:38] just coming through exactly and that
[1:24:39] wave hit the woman in front of me and I
[1:24:41] know she had some problems I just knew
[1:24:43] and the Lord came down and delivered her
[1:24:45] in that moment gave her what she needed
[1:24:48] but you know what Satan said to me he
[1:24:50] said he said God will deliver her but he
[1:24:53] won't heal your hand
[1:24:55] that's a perfect proof he can do it he
[1:24:59] told me God how many has had that
[1:25:01] experience in church before
[1:25:03] God can help so and so somebody else can
[1:25:07] have Revival God is able to help
[1:25:10] somebody else
[1:25:11] but when it comes to us and I was
[1:25:13] sitting there and God put it before me
[1:25:16] and something spoke up inside of me and
[1:25:18] said what are you gonna do
[1:25:19] are you going to believe Satan are you
[1:25:21] going to believe God
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:25] but you know as I was hearing Satan say
[1:25:28] God will heal her but he won't hear you
[1:25:30] I begin to hear another voice and it was
[1:25:33] the blood and it began to speak better
[1:25:35] things bad strikes I'm healed amen
[1:25:40] originally I was gonna go get that
[1:25:42] insurance card but when I walked out of
[1:25:45] that service I told my wife I said
[1:25:47] you've heard me complain about my wrist
[1:25:48] you've heard me complain about my my
[1:25:51] pain I said but it stops the right here
[1:25:54] I said if I say one thing about it hurt
[1:25:57] if I say one thing you rebuke me on this
[1:26:00] preacher my brother
[1:26:01] I'm standing for Jesus yes I said if
[1:26:04] he'll heal her he can heal me yes sir
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:10] Seth as you get healed the next day no
[1:26:14] The Voice every day was saying my hand
[1:26:16] hurts I couldn't hardly drive but if I
[1:26:20] looked at the symptoms I'd never get
[1:26:22] better that's right so I just kept
[1:26:24] saying thank you Lord for healing me buy
[1:26:26] Stripes I'm here thank you Lord for
[1:26:28] healing me it's my brother and one day I
[1:26:31] went to work hurting but on my way home
[1:26:33] I was driving and I was driving with
[1:26:36] this hand because this was my good hand
[1:26:38] while I was hurt this was my hurt hand
[1:26:39] but one day I was driving home from work
[1:26:42] and I began to realize unconsciously yes
[1:26:45] sir I was sitting there going
[1:26:48] I was held I didn't even know I was here
[1:26:53] you know why because we weren't healed
[1:26:56] on any particular day
[1:26:58] but the lamb was slain before the
[1:27:01] foundation of the world and before the
[1:27:03] foundation of the world the blood was
[1:27:06] speaking you're healed you're
[1:27:09] you're fake you're free
[1:27:13] and you know what
[1:27:15] my testimony became a reality amen My
[1:27:19] Confession it was saying what God had
[1:27:22] already said said you're healed you're
[1:27:24] healed saith don't look at that hand
[1:27:27] don't look at the symptoms don't look at
[1:27:29] the problems except the promise God said
[1:27:32] so
[1:27:38] Hallelujah
[1:27:40] the blood
[1:27:42] speaks
[1:27:43] better things you know what the blood is
[1:27:47] speaking over that fear
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:51] the blood Speaks Over fear you know the
[1:27:55] first thing that the blood said when it
[1:27:59] resurrected was fear not
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:02] fear not
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:05] when I was a 10 year old boy I could not
[1:28:08] sleep
[1:28:09] because I had such bad anxiety
[1:28:12] but I went up and got prayed for in
[1:28:14] church and my pepper prayed for me and
[1:28:17] he said you don't worry about it anymore
[1:28:19] so you know what I did I didn't worry
[1:28:21] about it anymore
[1:28:22] I went home and I was sleeping I was
[1:28:26] trying to go to sleep and Satan began to
[1:28:28] come around with that same fear that
[1:28:30] same anxiety Spirit but something began
[1:28:33] to speak yes sir I want to say this when
[1:28:37] you can't speak for yourself the blood
[1:28:39] speaks for you amen and something began
[1:28:42] to come out of me and I said Satan I was
[1:28:45] prayed for I'm delivered get out of here
[1:28:50] foreign
[1:28:51] never had a sleepless night again from
[1:28:53] anxiety but I'll tell you what later in
[1:28:55] life I began to battle a thing called
[1:28:57] nervousness there was a nervous spirit
[1:28:59] that came over me there was a nervous
[1:29:01] spirit that came over me that my stomach
[1:29:03] was so tore up so I just couldn't hardly
[1:29:06] breathe felt like no matter what I did I
[1:29:08] couldn't breathe I couldn't get my heart
[1:29:09] to slow down I didn't know why I was
[1:29:11] going through it but God is a merciful
[1:29:14] high priest
[1:29:15] Preacher Brother
[1:29:17] and I was sitting there I battled it for
[1:29:20] weeks but I would not give in to the
[1:29:22] devil buy Stripes I'm Healed yes sir the
[1:29:25] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:29:28] yes sir
[1:29:30] I was sitting there
[1:29:32] one day I heard that that song
[1:29:35] out on the water storm raging High I
[1:29:38] began to think about that and as I was
[1:29:39] listening to that song you know what I
[1:29:41] began to realize and if you realize this
[1:29:43] right now the nervousness will leave you
[1:29:45] too if you look back at your life God
[1:29:47] took me back to when I was a little
[1:29:48] six-year-old boy and I was sitting there
[1:29:51] talking to a stump in the woods talking
[1:29:53] to God and he said to me have I not
[1:29:55] brought you all this way
[1:29:57] yes my brother have I not took care of
[1:29:59] you yes sir have I not given you
[1:30:01] everything you ever needed have you ever
[1:30:03] went hungry
[1:30:07] if I ever left you in the valley
[1:30:10] not one time the blood was speaking fear
[1:30:14] not
[1:30:15] he's our provider amen amen amen
[1:30:21] what brother Prince say
[1:30:24] you got to accept it
[1:30:26] you have to accept the voice of him
[1:30:36] glory to God
[1:30:39] I'm trading my sorrow
[1:30:44] I'm trading my
[1:30:49] get down for the glory
[1:30:56] I'm trading my sickness
[1:31:01] I'm trading my
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:13] yes Lord yes Lord
[1:31:18] and that's
[1:31:20] it yes yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes
[1:31:25] yes Lord amen amen
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:35] you see we sang that
[1:31:38] we sung that before we came out and
[1:31:40] preached
[1:31:42] because what voice are you going to hear
[1:31:49] so you can trade
[1:31:51] a voice of Sorrow for a voice of joy
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:58] you can trade that shame for Glory
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:05] you can trade in that sickness for
[1:32:07] health
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:09] you can trade in all that pain
[1:32:13] for healing
[1:32:17] but it all depends
[1:32:19] on what voice you want to listen to
[1:32:22] listen tonight
[1:32:24] there is plenty of voices
[1:32:28] you know I just feel that let the
[1:32:29] musicians come back
[1:32:33] there's many voices
[1:32:36] that are speaking to you tonight
[1:32:40] there's many things that are gonna
[1:32:43] you see that's where you've got to
[1:32:45] realize
[1:32:46] there's the devil
[1:32:48] and demons
[1:32:50] that our voices constantly battling you
[1:32:54] trying you
[1:32:55] putting you down listen any voice
[1:32:58] that is trying to put you down and not
[1:33:00] pull you up it's not the voice of God
[1:33:04] but just as there's demons and devils
[1:33:07] and other things
[1:33:09] not only is there the voice of God but
[1:33:12] there's ministering angels
[1:33:15] there's a five-fold Ministry
[1:33:17] there's voices but you know what the
[1:33:19] truth of it is said take it back to the
[1:33:21] word
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:24] and whatever symptom that you have that
[1:33:27] goes against the word of God is not the
[1:33:30] voice of the blood crying out
[1:33:32] I want to touch on one more thing and
[1:33:34] then we'll close
[1:33:39] when we can't speak for ourselves
[1:33:42] Hallelujah
[1:33:44] the blood speaks for us
[1:33:48] you know I began to read and
[1:33:52] the book of Exodus
[1:33:54] when the children of Israel
[1:33:58] the Passover Lamb was going on
[1:34:01] and it was time for them to leave
[1:34:04] but they couldn't come out and speak
[1:34:07] for themselves
[1:34:08] the death angel was coming through
[1:34:12] but you know what they had speaking for
[1:34:14] them
[1:34:15] a blood
[1:34:19] there was a blood over the door saying
[1:34:22] Passover
[1:34:25] amen amen and that was the Old Testament
[1:34:27] blood go ahead now
[1:34:30] but in the New Testament yes sir
[1:34:34] I'm gonna say this for the one that
[1:34:36] needs it
[1:34:37] I've told you how we were Overcomers
[1:34:40] I've told you the truth of God's word
[1:34:42] tonight and I believe that
[1:34:45] but let me tell you this I also know yes
[1:34:48] what it feels like
[1:34:50] when you're so low
[1:34:53] so far down
[1:34:56] that you can't even speak for yourself
[1:34:58] right
[1:35:01] that eagle that
[1:35:02] gets so crusted over
[1:35:04] finds himself way he
[1:35:07] away
[1:35:08] down in a valley
[1:35:11] but you know what God sends an eagle
[1:35:15] to come down
[1:35:17] and begin to feed that eagle
[1:35:20] to give that eagle his strength
[1:35:24] you know there was a man and when I
[1:35:26] thought about how the blood speaks
[1:35:28] and I've got plenty more but we're gonna
[1:35:31] bypass it tonight
[1:35:34] there was a man one day
[1:35:37] that was hanging on a cross
[1:35:41] and he couldn't speak for himself
[1:35:44] he was sitting there on a cross
[1:35:46] and there was men all on the ground
[1:35:50] all kinds of voices
[1:35:53] that were looking at that thief on that
[1:35:55] cross
[1:35:56] and they said you're worthless
[1:35:59] you're a loser
[1:36:01] you deserve every bit of this
[1:36:04] you know what rightfully so he did
[1:36:07] he deserved everything that he was going
[1:36:10] through that thief on the cross
[1:36:12] they could look up and they could begin
[1:36:14] to look at his life
[1:36:16] they could be going through his criminal
[1:36:18] record
[1:36:19] say on such and such date you did so and
[1:36:21] so guilty
[1:36:24] on such and such date you stole this
[1:36:26] guilty
[1:36:27] on such and such State you murdered
[1:36:30] someone guilty
[1:36:32] on such and such that you did this
[1:36:34] guilty and they all could begin to say
[1:36:37] guilty and they could spit on him and
[1:36:39] and throw stuff at him and do everything
[1:36:41] to him
[1:36:42] and you know he's on a cross helpless
[1:36:45] and even this man is sitting there
[1:36:48] cussing out the man on the middle cross
[1:36:51] he's sitting there cussing Jesus with
[1:36:53] his friend
[1:36:55] but you know while he's there
[1:36:58] something begins to speak to him
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:04] and it wasn't an audible voice
[1:37:06] but you know exactly what voice he heard
[1:37:11] and that voice began to speak to him
[1:37:15] and as he was listening
[1:37:17] he began to look
[1:37:19] and that blood that was pouring out from
[1:37:22] that man
[1:37:23] was speaking out
[1:37:27] come unto me
[1:37:29] all ye that labor
[1:37:34] there was something that listened there
[1:37:36] was a call in him to respond
[1:37:40] and even though he couldn't even I'm
[1:37:43] speaking to somebody tonight even though
[1:37:45] you might feel so lowed down that you
[1:37:47] feel like you can't get up maybe you
[1:37:49] feel like you're on the cross of critics
[1:37:52] but the blood was still speaking better
[1:37:56] things
[1:37:57] amen when everything around him was
[1:38:00] saying you're a loser you're no good
[1:38:02] you'll never make it there's no way you
[1:38:04] can make it you've had too many problems
[1:38:06] you've done too many things wrong God
[1:38:09] could never forgive you but the blood is
[1:38:11] still speaking at night listen when
[1:38:13] brother Branham was sitting there and he
[1:38:15] was in that Cafe and there was that
[1:38:17] woman that had those purple nails and
[1:38:19] purple hair and everything about her and
[1:38:21] he was sitting there and he was going

[1:38:28] little Rebecca am I in Sarah after grow
[1:38:31] up looking at this but about that time
[1:38:33] the angel of the Lord said let me take
[1:38:35] you behind the curtain here
[1:38:37] and when he went behind the curtain he
[1:38:38] began to see a vision what did he see
[1:38:42] he's seen his own sins but between him
[1:38:45] and the throne
[1:38:47] he said day and night listen Satan might
[1:38:51] come at you from every angle call you a
[1:38:54] loser call you worthless from every
[1:38:56] angle but there is a bloodline
[1:39:00] wrapped around you

[1:39:08] sorry for the things that we do only

[1:39:33] see you
