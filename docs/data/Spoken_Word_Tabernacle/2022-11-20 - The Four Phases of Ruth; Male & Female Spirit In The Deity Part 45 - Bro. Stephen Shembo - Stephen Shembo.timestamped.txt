[50:03] and around how many are not able to

[50:08] so everybody you you're the only one so
[50:12] talk to Brother David if he can give it
[50:13] to you anybody else
[50:15] so either you didn't read it
[50:18] or you are behind your messages I have
[50:21] been sending a lot of messages and once
[50:24] I sent a message it's not in my
[50:26] responsibility anymore in other words if
[50:29] you are not up to the message that will
[50:31] send
[50:32] that is your own responsibility amen my
[50:35] responsibility is to send it but I'm not
[50:37] going to be at home telling you to read
[50:39] your own message so it's your
[50:41] responsibility to make sure you're up to
[50:43] date with the sermon or with the the the
[50:46] messages or the quotes that has been
[50:48] sent there amen but Lord's willing I
[50:51] would like to have whatever I send in a
[50:54] message on December 3rd here amen so
[50:58] make sure you make it there if you can
[51:01] if you cannot make it do not operate in
[51:04] this church
[51:07] you didn't hear me
[51:09] if you miss that meeting and you play an
[51:12] instrument do not play an instrument
[51:14] anymore until you talk to me
[51:18] if you miss that meeting and you know
[51:20] you're in a choir when they call the
[51:22] choir do not come up here
[51:24] because I don't want you to operate
[51:26] differently
[51:28] amen you must ask your question you
[51:30] might ask yourself a question why am I
[51:32] going that direction we started this
[51:35] church in December 2019.
[51:40] that's when we left the old church
[51:43] that's when we started this church and
[51:45] the first service in a hotel was in this
[51:48] in January 2020 and I was the one who
[51:52] preached the first service out there
[51:54] and then seven months later we went
[51:57] through the election and I was elected
[51:59] as a pastor so from December 2019 to
[52:04] almost December this year you are three
[52:07] years old
[52:12] you're no longer and a baby
[52:16] so the level of Tolerance is no longer
[52:19] there
[52:25] glory to God
[52:27] the Bible says in Acts chapter 17 verse
[52:31] 30.
[52:32] that and the time of this ignorance God
[52:36] winked at
[52:40] so there is a time that God went
[52:43] at your ignorance because you don't know
[52:45] what you're doing or maybe you are
[52:47] growing up in a faith and there are
[52:49] certain things that the Lord will
[52:51] tolerate amen usually the way I operate
[52:55] I must see something I will not do
[52:57] anything to it until I get a signal
[53:00] from the headquarter that's now it's
[53:03] time to move on and to do it that's how
[53:05] I learned from Brother Branham that's
[53:07] why brother Branham say that Paul became
[53:09] a prisoner because Paul learned to wait
[53:13] on to the Lord until the Lord zeroed in
[53:16] everything and say go ahead and do what
[53:18] you got to do that's the reason why that
[53:20] woman keep following Paul and Paul was
[53:23] not able to do anything brother random
[53:24] said he was waiting until they gave him
[53:26] a signal and once they give a signal
[53:28] then you know that everything is on time
[53:31] you can move on and do what you got to
[53:33] do amen so I receive a comment
[53:36] from someone online and I really
[53:39] appreciate the men who sent the comment
[53:41] and in conjunction to the comment
[53:43] brother John mentioned something on the
[53:46] musician chat so with those two coming
[53:48] together at the same time personally the
[53:51] way I'm LED with the Lord I felt that
[53:54] this is the time now that I need to
[53:56] address certain things that probably you
[53:59] don't know because you were not taught
[54:01] well
[54:02] amen so I'm not saying that you did
[54:05] something bad you did it ignorantly
[54:07] because you didn't know now it's time to
[54:10] start showing you certain things and
[54:13] once it's shown to you once it's
[54:16] revealed to you you you must walk at
[54:19] that level
[54:21] do you understand what I'm saying
[54:24] Paul says this he says the time of this
[54:28] ignorance God winked at
[54:31] but now
[54:33] no more ignorance
[54:35] commanded all men everywhere to do water
[54:39] repent so there is a time that God is
[54:41] quiet
[54:42] and there is a time that God will
[54:44] require you to do something
[54:47] amen Paul says in First Corinthians
[54:50] chapter 13 I read this on due on
[54:52] Wednesday he says when I was a child
[54:56] I speak like what a child and I
[54:59] understood as water and I taught us what
[55:01] so you are three years old in the
[55:04] ministry
[55:07] amen and Paul said but when I became a
[55:10] man I put away water so we reach a level
[55:14] that certain things need to go now
[55:19] amen
[55:21] let me give you an example just to help
[55:23] you see what I'm saying
[55:25] brother Branham says here that I don't
[55:27] see nothing he was taken he was talking
[55:30] about the women here he said I don't see
[55:33] nothing on taking on or taking off of
[55:37] her there unless the woman wants he says
[55:41] if she says she has to cut it then let
[55:44] her shave it off how sleep because the
[55:47] scriptures say a woman should not shave
[55:49] her hair we already went through this in
[55:52] the hotel if you want to do it you
[55:53] better give move everything but brother
[55:55] Branham continues he said because if she
[55:58] does not let her have her hair because
[56:01] her hair is her water covering but
[56:05] for a man to have his head covered
[56:11] comma long hair like a water woman it's
[56:14] a problem
[56:17] you must say this picture here look like
[56:21] having long hair
[56:25] brother Branham says this he say
[56:27] you say well my hair is long
[56:31] and it's done to my water shoulders that
[56:34] will shorten
[56:39] crust you say Christ had long hair no he
[56:43] never
[56:43] cross the head shoulder left hair that's
[56:46] what you see there
[56:47] so they say they just pull it around
[56:50] this way and cut it off shoulder length
[56:54] hair look at the Greek word on that in
[56:57] there and you shall find out so in the
[57:00] Bible time
[57:01] what you see here was called shorter
[57:05] hair
[57:08] you will catch up on me later right
[57:10] about them say a man should not have
[57:13] long hair
[57:15] because it is water feminist way down
[57:18] long like this but he just cut it off
[57:21] here and he showed her where they cut it
[57:24] off around his head just bobbed it off
[57:27] like that that was water short hair so a
[57:30] man should not wear a long hair
[57:33] but I'm gonna say something the Bible
[57:36] says that when the woman at the well met
[57:38] Jesus Christ he said how can you be a
[57:42] what
[57:43] can you say it louder so Jesus Christ
[57:46] was a Jew
[57:49] and Jewish hair are not black people
[57:52] here
[57:58] do you hear me so don't come in this
[58:01] church
[58:02] and keep your hair longer because you
[58:05] want to resemble this one
[58:09] that was a Jewish hair
[58:11] if you're a black man you don't have
[58:13] Jewish hair don't do this cut your hair
[58:16] clean
[58:18] we're not Mavericks in this church
[58:23] you don't have to say Amen
[58:27] I am fine
[58:29] what I'm trying to say by that brother
[58:31] Branham say but for a man to have his
[58:33] hair covered
[58:35] long like a water woman standing in the
[58:39] water he looked like a woman up there
[58:43] mine
[58:46] brother Branham is saying if a man have
[58:49] long hair
[58:50] standing on the pulpit when people look
[58:53] at that man over there they will think
[58:56] that man is a woman
[58:57] in other words a woman should not stand
[59:01] on this pulpit
[59:07] a sister should not come over here and
[59:10] stand on this pulpit
[59:14] all the singers should be standing right
[59:16] here
[59:20] hmm
[59:22] glory to God
[59:25] we talked about this Tabernacle and this
[59:28] Tabernacle has how many parts three
[59:33] the Tabernacle have three parts
[59:36] if I Don't Preach that's okay if you can
[59:38] get this only we have the first part is
[59:41] called water they are the court and the
[59:44] second one is called what
[59:46] the holy place
[59:48] we call this the sanctuary remember we
[59:52] went through this the first century and
[59:54] the third one was water the holiest of
[59:57] all this one was called the second
[59:59] century
[1:00:02] everybody okay why what are you trying
[1:00:05] to say with a tabernacle and about
[1:00:07] people singing and standing here it's
[1:00:10] indifferent language but you gotta learn
[1:00:12] it now now we need to teach you you
[1:00:15] didn't know before now you need to know
[1:00:17] brother Branham say then when the
[1:00:21] building was assembled together and all
[1:00:24] completed
[1:00:25] Solomon called the day of water
[1:00:28] dedication
[1:00:29] that Tabernacle of Solomon
[1:00:33] was built just exactly like water
[1:00:41] here brother Branham is saying that the
[1:00:43] way they built the Tabernacle that's the
[1:00:46] way they built the Branham Tabernacle
[1:00:49] if you look at Branham Tabernacle does
[1:00:51] he resemble the Tabernacle of Solomon or
[1:00:54] the Temple of Solomon
[1:00:56] how does he look like it it's a
[1:00:58] different language
[1:00:59] don't worry
[1:01:01] brother Branham say the congregation is
[1:01:04] what the court
[1:01:11] can you say Amen
[1:01:14] so when you are entering this church
[1:01:17] everywhere from from here where you are
[1:01:20] sitting there in the eyes of God you
[1:01:23] already in the other court
[1:01:28] I know maybe you never heard something
[1:01:31] never never heard something like this
[1:01:33] that's why we're going through this
[1:01:36] brother Branham said the congregation
[1:01:38] where you are is the water cool Karma
[1:01:40] and what followed the court if you are
[1:01:43] in the other court what follow the other
[1:01:46] quote
[1:01:47] and brother Branham called that water
[1:01:50] whoever is on the computer makes sure
[1:01:52] all these quotes are ported up there so
[1:01:56] don't be behind me or ahead of me Let's
[1:01:59] Stay Together in harmony brother Branham
[1:02:01] say the other court is the congregation
[1:02:05] What followed the other court
[1:02:08] the holy place and the holy Place
[1:02:10] brother Branham called that water so
[1:02:12] when you're entering the church this
[1:02:14] place right here is your holy place
[1:02:22] am I reading something different
[1:02:28] let's go up with our
[1:02:31] level Amen brother Branham say and the
[1:02:34] water holiest of holy what do you think
[1:02:36] the holiest should be then
[1:02:41] what do you think it is
[1:02:44] brother Branham said but look
[1:02:47] let me pull this up brother Branham say
[1:02:50] and standing here with this bubble on
[1:02:52] the water
[1:02:54] come out the water the water
[1:02:57] to heaven on water why brother Branham
[1:03:00] called that
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:08] keep soaking it
[1:03:11] it will help you out brother Branham
[1:03:14] said but look at the principle they had
[1:03:16] to come to look what they had to stand
[1:03:18] for look how they had to have this
[1:03:21] common place of Fellowship let this
[1:03:23] water Tabernacle always stand for those
[1:03:26] water which was intact then now it is
[1:03:30] the water
[1:03:31] so the congregation is the other court
[1:03:35] this place right here at the altar is
[1:03:37] the holy place and your Pulpit is what
[1:03:40] is called the holiest
[1:03:43] back
[1:03:44] amen you're going to understand that
[1:03:47] later bye and by I have to preach it
[1:03:49] it's up to you to catch up to what I'm
[1:03:51] saying
[1:03:53] you think it's a deduction let me help
[1:03:55] you up more
[1:03:57] brother Branham say I just asked any man
[1:04:00] to produce scripture for a woman water
[1:04:03] preacher I can't I can prove to you that
[1:04:06] in the Old Testament
[1:04:09] as Paul say even so say the water I was
[1:04:13] looking in the crown uh in the
[1:04:15] chronology of the Old Testament
[1:04:17] yesterday and I found in there that
[1:04:21] where they had special water police that
[1:04:24] a woman could not even come to the water
[1:04:28] what is the second call
[1:04:30] all the water
[1:04:32] the turtle is called water the third
[1:04:35] Court LED alone in the water
[1:04:42] so if they call you to sing something
[1:04:44] special
[1:04:46] don't stand here
[1:04:52] if you heard me say Amen
[1:04:54] all musicians stand right here like you
[1:04:57] did with sister Victoria and sister
[1:04:59] Olivia praise the Lord you were right on
[1:05:02] the correct line where you were if they
[1:05:05] call you you sing over there in this
[1:05:07] puppet here on this song leader get here
[1:05:10] only preacher get here only the pastor
[1:05:14] get here only the Deacon get here or
[1:05:17] they trusty if he wanna say something to
[1:05:20] the church
[1:05:22] if you're not in that order when they
[1:05:24] call you stand over there when they call
[1:05:26] the choir stand behind here
[1:05:29] you say brother Stephen we under the
[1:05:31] levitical priesthood we are not under
[1:05:33] the levitical priesthood we under the
[1:05:36] Melchizedek priesthood God opened the
[1:05:39] way that's why women can come to the
[1:05:41] Altar and they can pray women can step
[1:05:44] all the way here and they can sing but
[1:05:47] because the Covenant never change
[1:05:49] between a man and a woman and the man is
[1:05:52] still the head Paul say I do not give
[1:05:55] the woman the right to come to the
[1:05:57] pulpit and take authority because of
[1:06:00] that that is what is keeping the woman
[1:06:02] away under the melchized
[1:06:05] foreign
[1:06:10] sister you can step all the way here but
[1:06:13] because of what Paul kept the Covenant
[1:06:16] that changed after sin man still the
[1:06:19] head that's why the woman cannot come
[1:06:21] here if he was not for that the sister
[1:06:23] who would have a right to get here
[1:06:26] it's a different language
[1:06:28] that was just an appetizer
[1:06:33] Paul says this he said nevertheless well
[1:06:37] too we have already watered in other
[1:06:39] words we have reached a certain level
[1:06:41] with the church
[1:06:42] he said let us walk by the same room let
[1:06:46] us man the same water if you reach a
[1:06:49] certain level you need now to move to
[1:06:51] that level in other words I cannot
[1:06:53] tolerate anybody operating in this
[1:06:56] church under the standard you rather sit
[1:06:59] down
[1:07:02] did you hear me
[1:07:04] the remaining I'll talk to you in
[1:07:05] December 3rd Paul said Paul spoke to
[1:07:08] Timothy he said no man that worth a
[1:07:11] soldier entangle himself with the affair
[1:07:14] of water that he may please him who has
[1:07:18] water chosen him to be a water so if you
[1:07:21] are
[1:07:22] you are boarded
[1:07:24] to serve the Lord
[1:07:26] whether musician weather singer whether
[1:07:31] on the computer there whether on the
[1:07:33] sound system whether you are an officer
[1:07:35] whether a deacon whether a trustee
[1:07:37] whether uh uh I mean a treasure whatever
[1:07:41] you're doing if you are embarked in
[1:07:44] those offices you must stop you
[1:07:47] masturbide
[1:07:49] by what that office is calling
[1:07:52] you cannot be in those offices and you
[1:07:55] are entangling with the things of life
[1:07:58] in other words the work of God is
[1:08:00] neglected because you are so busy it is
[1:08:03] better for you to leave
[1:08:08] it is better for you not to play on the
[1:08:10] instrument if you cannot consecrate
[1:08:12] yourself
[1:08:14] it will be better for you to sit down
[1:08:17] then try to temper here
[1:08:19] you grown up see you on December 3rd
[1:08:23] let's go with the scripture
[1:08:28] it's a different language buddy happened

[1:09:00] because I know somebody's looking at me
[1:09:02] like where he's going with it yeah it is
[1:09:04] the word of God that's the congregation
[1:09:06] this is the holy place this is the
[1:09:08] holiest place that's the way it is

[1:09:14] you are mature Now by God's grace you
[1:09:17] need to know certain things and let's
[1:09:19] Now operate under that so we can be
[1:09:21] pleasing to the Lord
[1:09:23] and keeping moving amen yeah when God
[1:09:27] pull you to a certain level you cannot
[1:09:29] stay where you are those that stay on
[1:09:31] the looter became denomination
[1:09:33] because they didn't want to move with
[1:09:35] God those that stay on the Wesley
[1:09:37] denomination they didn't want to move
[1:09:39] with Pentecost those that stay on the
[1:09:41] Pentecostal denomination they didn't
[1:09:42] want to move with the entire message

[1:10:39] and make it personal I don't have a
[1:10:40] problem with anybody okay but if I tell
[1:10:43] you you need to move and go over there

[1:10:47] problem with you I'm saying that for
[1:10:49] your protection and to help you out so
[1:10:52] don't make it personal
[1:10:55] don't make it personal
[1:10:59] do not make it personal

[1:11:08] let's go to Genesis chapter 2.
[1:11:15] yes don't bring bring your this family
[1:11:18] the problem this family the problem
[1:11:20] talking to this one talking to this one
[1:11:22] and then I have a problem no no no no
[1:11:24] don't make it personal all I'm saying is
[1:11:26] sister you're too busy take your time
[1:11:28] consecrate yourself when you're ready
[1:11:30] then you can come back and continue to
[1:11:32] play instrument you have nothing
[1:11:33] personal amen
[1:11:35] that's it
[1:11:38] if the door in the morning is not open
[1:11:40] the first time it's not open the second
[1:11:42] time it's not open the third time I
[1:11:44] would take the keys off the door I would
[1:11:45] do my best to be there on time so don't
[1:11:47] take it personal if I take the keys out
[1:11:55] Genesis chapter 2.
[1:11:57] I already warned you
[1:12:09] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you dare
[1:12:12] you can say amen I want you to stay
[1:12:15] awake this is a different language
[1:12:17] completely
[1:12:19] stay awake
[1:12:21] give me time
[1:12:23] stay awake it's a different language
[1:12:27] okay
[1:12:28] Genesis 2 verse 7. if you dare you can
[1:12:31] say amen amen and the Lord God formed
[1:12:34] man of the dust off the ground you know
[1:12:37] what it means and breathe into his
[1:12:39] nostril the breath of life and he became
[1:12:43] a what living Soul you might be seated
[1:12:45] job to verse 18.
[1:12:48] and the Lord God say it is not good for
[1:12:51] the man
[1:12:52] that man should be what alone so this
[1:12:55] man is a natural man
[1:12:57] and this man that was created naturally
[1:13:02] he appeared to be
[1:13:04] alone
[1:13:07] because he was one person when you look
[1:13:10] at him naturally you only see one being
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] verse 19 let me drop down to verse 20
[1:13:20] for the sake of time and Adam gave name
[1:13:24] to okada
[1:13:25] and to the fall of the air and to every
[1:13:28] beast of the field but for Adam there
[1:13:32] was not found a what help me whoever
[1:13:35] missed the church and you're going to
[1:13:37] stream later make sure you abide with
[1:13:39] what was spoken this morning
[1:13:45] but Adam was not found a help meet for
[1:13:48] him and the Lord God calls a deep sleep
[1:13:51] to fall upon Adam
[1:13:54] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:13:58] so in other words before Eve can be
[1:14:01] pulled out from the body of Adam Adam
[1:14:04] must be completely asleep
[1:14:10] Adam must be completely
[1:14:14] sleeping and not just a slit by the Deep
[1:14:17] one
[1:14:18] when he went to a deep sleep he could
[1:14:21] not even move that's when God pulled the
[1:14:25] woman
[1:14:26] the woman we went through that last
[1:14:28] Sunday the woman
[1:14:30] using a rib
[1:14:32] amen glory to God and close up the flesh
[1:14:36] instead thereof and the rib which the
[1:14:39] Lord God has taken from man made he a
[1:14:42] water woman and brought her to man and
[1:14:45] Adam say this is now you remember Sunday
[1:14:50] born of my born and Flesh of My Flesh
[1:14:53] she shall be called the water
[1:14:56] if you notice here Adam say that she is
[1:15:00] born of his born
[1:15:03] and flesh of his flesh in other words
[1:15:07] the body of Eve
[1:15:12] the body of Eve
[1:15:15] was not different than the body of Adam
[1:15:22] everybody okay in other words the body
[1:15:25] of Eve was the body of Adam in female
[1:15:29] version
[1:15:35] because Adam didn't say this is somebody
[1:15:37] else's body this is somebody else born
[1:15:40] he said no no no no no no no this is my
[1:15:42] born and this is my flesh so when you're
[1:15:45] looking at Eve you're looking at Adam in
[1:15:48] a feminine in a female version
[1:15:52] stay alert
[1:15:54] everybody okay
[1:15:56] therefore shall man leave his father and
[1:15:59] his mother and shall cling to his wife
[1:16:01] and they shall be water one flesh and
[1:16:04] they were both naked the man and his
[1:16:06] wife and were not wanted let's go to
[1:16:08] Genesis chapter 5 verse one this is the
[1:16:12] book of the generation of Adam
[1:16:14] in the day that God created man in his
[1:16:18] in the likeness of God made he him
[1:16:21] he made him how male and female created
[1:16:24] he them and God blessed them and called
[1:16:29] their name
[1:16:32] So Adam
[1:16:36] is male
[1:16:39] and he's female
[1:16:41] and Adam is the name for the mayor and
[1:16:46] the female so what you call Eve was not
[1:16:49] ease
[1:16:51] the name of Eve was Adam
[1:16:54] she became Eve when she seen
[1:16:58] everybody okay
[1:16:59] go to roof chapter 2.
[1:17:07] let's see how the Lord will help us here
[1:17:09] I'm going to skip a lot of them for the
[1:17:13] sake of time
[1:17:15] let's go to verse 11.
[1:17:23] and Boaz answer and say to her he has
[1:17:27] fully been shown to me all that you have
[1:17:29] done to your mother in Lord since the
[1:17:32] death of your husband and how you have
[1:17:34] left your father like Abraham did your
[1:17:36] mother and the land of your Nativity
[1:17:39] exactly the faith of Abraham and now
[1:17:41] come to a people which you knew not
[1:17:43] before
[1:17:44] the Lord welcome past your work
[1:17:47] that work was a work of faith
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:52] and a full reward be giving you of the
[1:17:56] Lord God of Israel under whose wings we
[1:18:00] know it's the Tabernacle you are come to
[1:18:02] the water
[1:18:03] so roof was after the full reward what
[1:18:07] is the full reward
[1:18:11] go to chapter 3.
[1:18:14] verse 1 the Bible says this the Naomi
[1:18:19] her mother-in-law said to her my
[1:18:21] daughter Shala not seek water so Ruth
[1:18:24] being in Israel working in a field of
[1:18:27] Boaz was not enough
[1:18:29] staying with Naomi was not enough she
[1:18:32] was not in rest yet
[1:18:37] everybody okay whatever happened in
[1:18:40] Israel she was that she did not have
[1:18:42] rest yet
[1:18:48] what is this restaurant
[1:18:52] amen how do you find the rest
[1:18:55] this is the way you found rest that he
[1:18:57] may be well with you and now he's not
[1:18:59] Boaz Our Kingdom
[1:19:02] with whose Maiden you were that's in the
[1:19:05] past
[1:19:06] amen behold he we knoweth Barney tonight
[1:19:09] in the water if you notice here it's
[1:19:12] Boaz working
[1:19:15] for you to find your rest you need to go
[1:19:18] where Boaz himself is working
[1:19:22] everybody okay let's go to Ephesians and
[1:19:25] then we pray
[1:19:28] help me give me time and let's handle
[1:19:31] this
[1:19:36] verse 23
[1:19:40] you already understand now what a woman
[1:19:42] is how to respect the sister and what is
[1:19:45] the position of the sister how she need
[1:19:47] to be submitted to her husband
[1:19:49] if you play around with those two things
[1:19:51] you're going to get yourself in trouble
[1:19:53] with God
[1:19:54] amen verse 23 for the husband is the
[1:20:00] head of the what
[1:20:01] that's why women cannot come here
[1:20:05] because the Covenant is still kept
[1:20:09] everybody okay if it was not for this
[1:20:11] sister would have been appearing here
[1:20:13] that's why Paul said a woman cannot even
[1:20:15] preach
[1:20:18] everybody okay even as Christ is the
[1:20:22] head of the water then he is the savior
[1:20:25] of the water so the church is the body
[1:20:30] the Church of God
[1:20:31] is the body of God
[1:20:34] the Church of God is the body of God
[1:20:38] let me keep that way
[1:20:41] amen job to verse 28.
[1:20:46] Hallelujah
[1:20:51] no
[1:20:53] you can get this go back to verse 24. I
[1:20:57] cannot skip this therefore as the church
[1:21:00] is subject to Christ
[1:21:02] so let the wives be to their own husband
[1:21:05] in water
[1:21:06] husbands love your water we went through
[1:21:09] that on Sunday even as Christ also loved
[1:21:13] her church and gave himself for water in
[1:21:16] other words you give your wife Jesus
[1:21:21] they love you must love your wife is the
[1:21:24] love of Jesus Christ how can you love
[1:21:27] your wife who like Jesus if you don't
[1:21:29] have Jesus
[1:21:30] [Applause]
[1:21:32] that's why a man before he get married
[1:21:35] he must meet Christ he must have the
[1:21:38] Holy Ghost if not he cannot give Christ
[1:21:41] to his wife
[1:21:43] walk on the love are you gonna give to
[1:21:46] your wife
[1:21:47] if you are not born again
[1:21:49] a Hollywood lover a freshly love
[1:21:55] you cannot even answer a question about
[1:21:58] the Bible
[1:22:02] [Applause]
[1:22:09] Hallelujah
[1:22:11] he said I said that Hima sanctify and
[1:22:15] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[1:22:18] by the water word you stay up whoever in
[1:22:22] a computer and here stay up with me
[1:22:24] please amen that he might present it to
[1:22:28] himself a water
[1:22:30] so the purpose of God
[1:22:33] God wants to present himself not just
[1:22:36] the church
[1:22:38] he want to present himself a church that
[1:22:41] is how
[1:22:43] why glorious
[1:22:47] why a glorious Church
[1:22:51] a glorious Church
[1:22:53] having not having water or water or any
[1:22:58] such water but that it should be how
[1:23:01] holy and without water so this church
[1:23:04] must be holy
[1:23:07] and this church must be without water
[1:23:14] with a blemish Hallelujah
[1:23:17] he continued he says so ought man to
[1:23:20] love the water how can you express that
[1:23:23] love if you don't have God
[1:23:26] Paul is saying this is the way a man
[1:23:29] should love his wife how are you God
[1:23:31] brother Branham saying you don't draw
[1:23:33] blood out of Eternity because there is
[1:23:36] no blood to begin with so you get in
[1:23:38] your Hollywood husband and you want the
[1:23:41] husband to Love You Like Jesus Christ
[1:23:43] this is why you get beaten
[1:23:48] this is why you disappointed you're
[1:23:50] trying to judge Jesus Christ out of a
[1:23:53] man that doesn't have Jesus Christ
[1:23:55] the staff of God does and not interest
[1:23:58] him
[1:24:01] when it's church he will find the reason
[1:24:03] when it's a house meeting he will find a
[1:24:06] reason not to be there everything that
[1:24:09] concerned God he's not there
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:19] so ought men to love the wife as their
[1:24:22] own water bodies
[1:24:25] he that love his wife love of water
[1:24:27] himself so the wife is your body
[1:24:31] so the body of a man the body of Eve is
[1:24:36] the body of who Adam
[1:24:43] it's a formula
[1:24:46] everybody okay
[1:24:47] for we are members of his water
[1:24:52] where is our weight 22 28 go to 29. for
[1:24:56] no man ever yet hated his own water
[1:24:59] flesh so the body of God is the Flesh of
[1:25:03] God
[1:25:04] that's why Adam said this is Flesh of My
[1:25:07] Flesh everybody okay
[1:25:09] nobody he said for no man ever hated his
[1:25:13] own flesh but does what nourishes in
[1:25:16] other words seeds it and do water care
[1:25:20] for it even as the Lord the water so we
[1:25:25] are members of his water body so this
[1:25:28] church is our so-called members
[1:25:35] everybody okay we are members of his
[1:25:38] body amen of his flesh and of his water
[1:25:42] that's why Adam says Flesh of My Flesh
[1:25:45] and born of my born now Paul is saying
[1:25:48] that Jesus Christ also have his flesh of
[1:25:52] his flesh and bonds of his bone his
[1:25:55] flesh of his Flesh and Bones of his
[1:25:58] bones is what they call his church
[1:26:02] everybody okay
[1:26:04] glory to God verse 31 for this course
[1:26:08] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:26:10] and shall be drawn to his water why and
[1:26:13] they too shall be water one flesh this
[1:26:16] is a great Water mystery but I speak
[1:26:19] concerning who and the water everything
[1:26:22] that I explain you here is a great
[1:26:26] mystery
[1:26:35] everybody okay keep those words here and
[1:26:39] let's pray
[1:26:40] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:26:43] you humbly this morning thanking you
[1:26:46] once again father for your grace for
[1:26:48] your love and your mercy and for
[1:26:50] everything you have been doing for us
[1:26:51] father this is as far as I can go as a
[1:26:54] human being that you have given ability
[1:26:56] to be able to read the Holy Scripture
[1:26:59] and be even able to be found worthy to
[1:27:02] read Lord father the worthy message that
[1:27:05] you have sent unto us in this Center
[1:27:07] Lord may you move me completely out of
[1:27:10] the way and may you move also the
[1:27:12] congregation out of the way so that Lord
[1:27:14] father you'll be the one speaking and
[1:27:17] the one Hearing in the heart of your
[1:27:18] children may every demonic Spirit
[1:27:20] contrary to your word live completely
[1:27:23] this place may you be the Alpha and the
[1:27:25] Omega of this service as we commit
[1:27:28] everything unto the hand in the name of
[1:27:30] Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:33] the way I will be traveling with this
[1:27:36] sermon is this
[1:27:39] according to First Corinthians chapter
[1:27:41] 15 The Bible say and so it is written
[1:27:45] the first man who Adam
[1:27:48] so we have a first Adam
[1:27:51] we have Adam the first
[1:27:56] the first one
[1:27:58] amen Adam the first one was made a
[1:28:01] living soul
[1:28:04] and we explained that brother Branham
[1:28:06] say he was a living Soul he means that
[1:28:08] he was a soul that cannot die because
[1:28:11] God injected into him eternal life you
[1:28:14] remember that but there is another Adam
[1:28:17] that is called the last Adam
[1:28:21] he's the second or the last last so you
[1:28:26] don't bring another third Adam
[1:28:28] the last Adam he is not a living soul
[1:28:32] but he is a quickening spirit
[1:28:37] he's a quickening spirit means that he
[1:28:41] is the one that give life
[1:28:46] he is the one that gives you the Holy
[1:28:49] Ghost
[1:28:50] that's why John the Baptist says that I
[1:28:54] John the Baptist baptize you with water
[1:28:56] water but there is somebody else that is
[1:28:59] coming after me that person will baptize
[1:29:02] you with what Holy Ghost and what that's
[1:29:05] why he is the Adam that quickened the
[1:29:07] spirit
[1:29:08] he's the one that gives eternal life if
[1:29:12] you don't have eternal life he's the one
[1:29:15] that will come and Quicken you so that
[1:29:18] you can receive
[1:29:19] eternal life so the way I'm gonna travel
[1:29:21] we will be traveling with the first Adam
[1:29:24] and the last Adam or the second Adam the
[1:29:27] first Adam is what Paul is referring
[1:29:30] here in the book of Ephesians as Adam
[1:29:33] and Eve then when he changed here he
[1:29:36] said this is about Christ
[1:29:39] and the what church over here it's about
[1:29:42] Adam and Eve
[1:29:45] so we have a natural Adam
[1:29:49] amen and we have over here a spiritual
[1:29:52] Adam
[1:29:54] everybody okay so keep those thoughts in
[1:29:56] mind this is how we're traveling my
[1:29:59] subject this morning is the four phases
[1:30:02] of roof
[1:30:04] male and female spirit in the deity
[1:30:13] everybody okay
[1:30:14] Adam was both male and female everybody
[1:30:18] can say Amen to that everybody can agree
[1:30:21] with that everybody takes it without any
[1:30:24] problem because it's very easy to see
[1:30:26] brother Charles and to see sister Keller
[1:30:29] the two two people everybody can see
[1:30:31] that without any problem now I'm not
[1:30:33] talking about the male and the female in
[1:30:36] the human being we already seen that
[1:30:39] today I'm talking about a mayor and a
[1:30:42] female spirit in the digity
[1:30:46] amen
[1:30:48] that's why I say stay up
[1:30:52] we're still dealing with the second oil
[1:30:55] whoever is on the computer please keep
[1:30:58] those quotes up
[1:30:59] roof was here in the uh in the field of
[1:31:02] Boaz working with the maiden we got two
[1:31:05] type of women we got who roof the bride
[1:31:09] to be and the other women that were
[1:31:11] working together just exactly like roof
[1:31:14] but they never became the the wife of
[1:31:17] Boaz the only one that continued and
[1:31:20] progress all the way to rest was only
[1:31:23] roof and roof alone
[1:31:25] according to Matthew 25 we got also two
[1:31:29] type of women we got the wise version
[1:31:32] and we also got the word the foolish
[1:31:34] virgin and the Bible says that and why
[1:31:38] they want to buy the bridegroom came and
[1:31:41] they that were already went in with him
[1:31:44] into the water
[1:31:45] so those that were ready were those that
[1:31:48] had the second oil
[1:31:52] because the Bible said in the Book of
[1:31:54] Revelation 19 that the marriage of the
[1:31:57] Lamb has come and his blood has made
[1:32:00] herself how do you make yourself ready
[1:32:04] you make yourself ready by making sure
[1:32:06] you have the second oil
[1:32:11] what are you trying to say brother
[1:32:13] Stephen
[1:32:14] brother Branham says in the Philadelphia
[1:32:16] churches he said don't you remember the
[1:32:20] sleeping virgin when she raised up now
[1:32:23] remember what what she call there is 10
[1:32:27] of them went out to meet the bridegroom
[1:32:29] is that right five was wise
[1:32:34] had oil in their lamp
[1:32:36] how many knows what all signified in the
[1:32:39] Bible is signify water
[1:32:43] you okay
[1:32:44] the oil signify the spirit but we got
[1:32:48] the first oil
[1:32:50] and we also got the water second oil
[1:32:54] the first oil was carried by the women
[1:32:58] amen but the second all opened up only
[1:33:01] when the bridegroom came
[1:33:06] everybody okay glory to God he says now
[1:33:10] one could not say you are not Sanctified
[1:33:13] I'm not there was all Sanctified all of
[1:33:17] them were virgin every one of them all
[1:33:19] water
[1:33:22] is everybody awake
[1:33:23] all of them sanctify but five was wise
[1:33:28] enough
[1:33:29] what does this wisdom mean
[1:33:32] to have the wisdom of water revelation
[1:33:35] and we know according to Paul Paul says
[1:33:40] that Christ
[1:33:43] is the wisdom of God
[1:33:46] we went through this before now brother
[1:33:48] Branham say the wise virgin that had the
[1:33:52] second oil or the wise virgin that that
[1:33:56] entered all the way to the marriage
[1:33:58] brother Branham said they had the wisdom
[1:34:01] of Revelation
[1:34:04] and the wisdom of God is Christ in other
[1:34:08] words these women had the true reference
[1:34:11] Center of Jesus Christ
[1:34:14] thank you
[1:34:18] glory to God brother Branham said that
[1:34:22] was wise enough to have the wisdom of
[1:34:26] Christ or direction of Christ the wisdom
[1:34:29] of Revelation to catch the water
[1:34:31] and the door is who
[1:34:34] seek to be filled with the water so in
[1:34:37] order to be to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:34:42] you must know where to find the door
[1:34:46] and you must have the revelation of that
[1:34:49] door and that door is closed
[1:34:56] what are you saying brother Stephen
[1:34:58] brother Branham said Paul was down there
[1:35:01] in the natural realm with his PhD see
[1:35:05] he didn't know he had a water
[1:35:08] intellectual Faith enter can you give
[1:35:10] him more volume please he has a made
[1:35:13] difference in me having an intellectual
[1:35:16] Faith then a Divine faith that is where
[1:35:21] you my Baptist friend failed to go on
[1:35:24] you get the intellectual Faith by that
[1:35:28] but it must be a water
[1:35:30] revelation of who Jesus Christ to you
[1:35:34] that that's what take sin out of the
[1:35:37] water and to let your faith is not
[1:35:40] enough
[1:35:45] Hallelujah
[1:35:46] that's all right but it only bring you
[1:35:49] to the water in other words you need
[1:35:51] knowledge first to know how God operate
[1:35:54] and that knowledge will bring you closer
[1:35:57] but you need to move from the head
[1:35:59] knowledge to a heart knowledge to
[1:36:01] understand who Christ is brother Branham
[1:36:04] said the holy spirit is a personal
[1:36:06] experience of water
[1:36:09] of the birth the new water
[1:36:12] regeneration making a new creature in
[1:36:14] water
[1:36:18] glory to God after the opening of the
[1:36:21] seals what is the new birth then
[1:36:26] you say well brother pranam what is the
[1:36:29] new birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ personally to you

[1:36:40] you shook a hand you done something
[1:36:42] different you say the Creed you promised
[1:36:45] to live by a code of law but it's who

[1:36:52] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:36:54] anybody says what takes place it is who
[1:36:57] right
[1:36:58] right whether it's a pastor or a priest
[1:37:01] whatever it might be it is Christ in who
[1:37:04] you that is the Revelation that the
[1:37:07] church was built upon
[1:37:10] what Revelation are you talking about
[1:37:12] that seals to reveal who
[1:37:16] is everybody awake
[1:37:19] all right let me keep moving

[1:37:25] Christ
[1:37:27] is a water revelation God has revealed
[1:37:31] to you this water great mystery

[1:38:02] this water and that is a new water now
[1:38:06] what are you going to do when you get
[1:38:08] all that group together where the
[1:38:10] Revelation is perfectly in water and God
[1:38:14] is expressing through his water by the
[1:38:17] same action the same thing that he did
[1:38:19] making the world water oh if the church
[1:38:23] only know each water he will one day
[1:38:27] [Applause]

[1:38:31] everybody okay then if you win one day
[1:38:34] then the Rapture will water go when he
[1:38:37] knows what it is now notice
[1:38:46] we need this message
[1:38:48] God is known by the Simplicity of the
[1:38:51] water Revelation revelation of water
[1:38:54] Jesus Christ
[1:38:58] you don't need to go to school that's
[1:39:01] why he took us not a theology it is a
[1:39:04] revelation of who Jesus Christ Upon This
[1:39:07] Rock I will build My Water Church no
[1:39:10] other rock is accepted no other thing is
[1:39:13] accepted nor the Roman Rock nor the
[1:39:16] Protestant Rock no other school no other
[1:39:19] nothing but on exactly the water
[1:39:22] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[1:39:24] water
[1:39:25] he Bonds in there and inject his own
[1:39:29] life and your life is water and the life
[1:39:33] of Christ is projecting itself through
[1:39:36] with the water
[1:39:38] how can you not if God preeminence and
[1:39:41] you claim to have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:47] when they call you about the freaks of
[1:39:49] God you don't want to come and you're
[1:39:52] telling me you have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:56] that's your own Holy Ghost
[1:40:00] it won't get you there amen with the
[1:40:03] water
[1:40:05] plural to the water people that they see
[1:40:08] the very water and Water Works and water
[1:40:12] and water that he did is doing the same
[1:40:16] thing through her so it is not just a
[1:40:19] talk
[1:40:20] it is a life and that life have also
[1:40:24] worked
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:30] glory to God outside of that the rest is
[1:40:35] not even water if that don't produce
[1:40:39] this one you don't have it
[1:40:43] you are 10 years in a message fan you
[1:40:46] don't have it
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:49] I was born in a message fan you don't
[1:40:51] have it
[1:40:52] Bridget yes
[1:40:54] everybody okay
[1:40:56] Watch God's Great Water Revelation doing
[1:41:00] water and forwarding by lack of
[1:41:04] disgravation is why we have so many
[1:41:07] water different divisions
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:11] do you see the problem in the message
[1:41:13] do you see why we have division in a
[1:41:15] message because the preacher themselves
[1:41:18] never got the revelation of the message
[1:41:22] that's why they are troubling the people
[1:41:25] all over
[1:41:29] we learn how to do emotions
[1:41:32] we learned how to run here and there we
[1:41:35] learn how to be good speakers by zero
[1:41:38] life
[1:41:39] he said by lack of this Revelation is
[1:41:42] why we have so many different water
[1:41:45] how can one message produce so many
[1:41:48] doctrines
[1:41:49] [Applause]
[1:41:52] how
[1:41:54] how Paul received the revelation of
[1:41:57] Jesus Christ Paul never met Peter but
[1:41:59] when Paul and Peter met they were
[1:42:01] preaching the same thing
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:08] amen by lack of this Revelation is why
[1:42:11] we have so many water different
[1:42:13] among us and so many so much water
[1:42:18] they make fun of the seals they make fun
[1:42:21] of the Thunders because of this and so
[1:42:24] much division Among Us is because the
[1:42:27] people lack water
[1:42:31] the teacher that went through lack the
[1:42:35] Revelation what were they teaching
[1:42:37] before
[1:42:42] the wise virgin
[1:42:44] head oil you need an oil that's going to
[1:42:48] help you now according to Genesis 1
[1:42:51] verse 26 amen
[1:42:55] God created man
[1:42:59] glory to God
[1:43:01] the Bible say he created man in his own
[1:43:05] image
[1:43:06] and in his own likeness
[1:43:10] and he created them and God called them
[1:43:14] what Adam
[1:43:16] follow me carefully I'm gonna call this
[1:43:19] circle God
[1:43:22] everybody okay now God in Genesis 1 26
[1:43:27] he created man
[1:43:30] the Bible never said he created a woman
[1:43:34] the word woman came when Eve was pulled
[1:43:38] out of Adam everybody okay follow me
[1:43:42] carefully
[1:43:43] in Genesis 1 26 God created a man
[1:43:50] not a woman
[1:43:52] but this man was double
[1:43:56] oh he was a dual man inside this man
[1:44:00] inside this man that looked like God
[1:44:04] there was a male
[1:44:06] and there was a female
[1:44:09] everybody okay if you take the female
[1:44:13] off of this man this man is no longer
[1:44:16] man
[1:44:20] are we okay are we okay
[1:44:23] are we okay if you take the man off of
[1:44:27] this man this man is no longer man to be
[1:44:31] man he must be double he must be man and
[1:44:36] he must be also a woman
[1:44:40] it's a different language buddy
[1:44:43] everybody okay that is why in Genesis
[1:44:47] this is Genesis 1 26. that is why in
[1:44:52] Genesis 2 verse 7 when God created man
[1:44:58] everybody okay In the Flesh in the
[1:45:02] biology in the genetics of this man he
[1:45:05] is also XY because he must be both mayor
[1:45:09] and water
[1:45:14] everybody okay
[1:45:16] this man of Genesis 1 was a spirit man
[1:45:21] he was a man that was invisible
[1:45:26] nobody can see him he was just like a
[1:45:29] spirit because God is a spirit himself
[1:45:32] according to First John chapter 4 we
[1:45:36] went through that
[1:45:37] and if this man is created in the image
[1:45:40] of God and the likeness of God this man
[1:45:43] must be a spirit because God was a
[1:45:46] spirit everybody okay but in Genesis 2
[1:45:50] verse 7 this man is not a spiritual man
[1:45:53] he is a natural man
[1:45:58] everybody okay now the Bible says that
[1:46:02] when God was talking here God used the
[1:46:05] terminology let us
[1:46:09] so God wants us
[1:46:12] that God was plural
[1:46:19] everybody okay when God moved man
[1:46:22] singular when you look inside that man
[1:46:26] singular that man singular also was
[1:46:29] plural
[1:46:34] everybody okay and when he moved this
[1:46:37] man from the spirit into a man naturally
[1:46:42] amen for some reason this man appear
[1:46:46] visibly
[1:46:49] to be alone
[1:46:55] everybody okay if you go into the
[1:46:59] spiritual Dimension if you look here you
[1:47:02] will see God too
[1:47:05] if you look at man you will see man too
[1:47:08] but when you jump in the Garden of Eden
[1:47:11] and you say Adam you will see Adam
[1:47:14] coming up alone
[1:47:16] you will expect to have Adam with
[1:47:19] somebody else beside him but when Adam
[1:47:22] comes to you he's alone
[1:47:24] what is going on
[1:47:26] [Applause]
[1:47:28] remember I'm traveling with the first
[1:47:31] Adam and the water
[1:47:33] everybody okay so the first Adam when he
[1:47:38] is created naturally he's created one
[1:47:42] person and he is a man or a man
[1:47:50] that's why the Bible say Adam was a son
[1:47:55] of God
[1:47:57] not a daughter of God
[1:48:05] everybody okay
[1:48:07] when God created the second Adam
[1:48:13] are we okay because this man here is the
[1:48:16] second Adam
[1:48:18] that's right that's right everybody okay
[1:48:20] when God created the second Adam which
[1:48:24] was the Lord Jesus Christ when Jesus
[1:48:27] Christ appeared on the scene Jesus
[1:48:30] Christ appeared as a man
[1:48:33] and he was a man that was alone
[1:48:37] and he was called also the son of God
[1:48:47] glory to God in Luke 3 verse 38
[1:48:51] the Bible said which was the son of in
[1:48:54] us which was the son of Seth which was
[1:48:57] the son of who
[1:49:00] the son of Adam Karma which was the son
[1:49:03] of who So Adam was the son of God not a
[1:49:08] daughter of God
[1:49:10] because he was a male
[1:49:12] everybody okay now in the making of
[1:49:15] Jesus Christ
[1:49:17] the second Adam Isaiah said unto us a
[1:49:21] water so that child we don't know
[1:49:24] whether it's a male or a female
[1:49:27] we don't know if it's going to be a
[1:49:28] daughter of God or he's going to be a
[1:49:30] Son of God so I say I need to provide us
[1:49:33] with more information
[1:49:36] so Isaiah said unto us a child is born
[1:49:40] Karma unto us a water why Jesus have to
[1:49:44] come as a son
[1:49:49] let me continue and to as our son is
[1:49:52] given and the government shall be upon
[1:49:55] he's not her
[1:49:58] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:50:01] Called water wonderful Karma and water
[1:50:04] and water
[1:50:06] so this son is the Mighty God
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:12] the Son of God is God
[1:50:18] amen what do you think Adam is if he's a
[1:50:21] son of God
[1:50:24] Adam is water
[1:50:28] Adam is water
[1:50:30] the Bible said didn't the Lord say that
[1:50:33] God called them water
[1:50:40] everybody okay
[1:50:43] he's the Mighty God Karma the
[1:50:46] Everlasting water how can the son be
[1:50:49] their father
[1:50:54] I told you to stay alert
[1:50:57] this son is also a father
[1:51:01] so who gave birth to the son
[1:51:06] is a self-existing
[1:51:08] everybody okay he said this dad is going
[1:51:12] to be Mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:51:14] the prince of water peace
[1:51:17] in Revelation 12 verse 5 and she brought
[1:51:19] forth a water
[1:51:21] a man shall not a woman child
[1:51:25] a man child that wants to rule all the
[1:51:28] nation with a road of iron and her child
[1:51:31] was caught up onto water God and to his
[1:51:34] water through the child was caught up
[1:51:36] unto God in other words God sucked the
[1:51:38] child because remember when Jesus was
[1:51:41] going up a cloud came open up and Jesus
[1:51:45] entered the cloud and the cloud
[1:51:47] everybody okay he was a caught up unto
[1:51:50] God and unto his water so the first Adam
[1:51:55] physically he was alone
[1:51:58] but spiritually he's male and female
[1:52:01] now when Jesus Christ came physically we
[1:52:04] seen a man walking
[1:52:06] alone if you look at Jesus he doesn't
[1:52:09] have a wife
[1:52:13] everybody okay glory to God now in First
[1:52:18] Corinthians chapter 11 this is where we
[1:52:20] stop last Sunday
[1:52:22] Paul say for a man indeed
[1:52:25] ought not to cover his head
[1:52:28] why
[1:52:30] for as much as he is water
[1:52:37] Adam naturally
[1:52:40] Adam naturally
[1:52:43] was one man
[1:52:47] amen first Adam Jesus Christ which is
[1:52:51] the second and last Adam naturally when
[1:52:55] you look at him he was one man
[1:52:58] amen
[1:53:00] now Paul is saying that for as much as
[1:53:04] he the man is the image and the glory of
[1:53:08] water God Paul is saying when you look
[1:53:12] at men
[1:53:14] everybody okay man
[1:53:17] naturally is one person
[1:53:21] and this man that look naturally as one
[1:53:25] person is the image
[1:53:28] and the glory of God because God is
[1:53:33] always one
[1:53:39] open Ephesians chapter four
[1:53:45] we aware in a vision father
[1:53:49] follow me carefully please
[1:53:52] Ephesians chapter four if you dare you
[1:53:55] can say Amen why is man the image of God
[1:53:59] and not the woman
[1:54:04] hear your Israel the Lord your God is
[1:54:07] what
[1:54:09] is what
[1:54:10] do you expect Adam to be too
[1:54:16] hear or Israel the Lord your God is how
[1:54:19] many God so if Adam come do you want
[1:54:22] Adam to be killed if he's too he doesn't
[1:54:24] look like God to look like God other
[1:54:27] must be one
[1:54:29] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:54:33] go to uh Ephesians 4 verse 4 if you dare
[1:54:36] you can say amen amen
[1:54:41] where am I
[1:54:43] Ephesians 4 4.
[1:54:46] I hope I got the right scripture
[1:54:49] that's what I was looking for
[1:54:53] for everybody okay all right the Bible
[1:54:56] says there is how many body one body
[1:54:59] Kama and water one Spirit come out even
[1:55:03] as you are caught into one hope of your
[1:55:07] calling verse five and what
[1:55:15] who is Father of water who is above and
[1:55:20] through water and in Utah
[1:55:24] how many favor one how many baptisms how
[1:55:29] many gods how many spirits how many body
[1:55:32] when how do you expect Adam to show up
[1:55:36] that's why man is in the image and in
[1:55:40] the likeness of who God
[1:55:43] everybody okay
[1:55:45] where are you going
[1:55:50] you ready
[1:55:51] let's read it now a man indeed ought not
[1:55:55] to cover his head for as much as he is
[1:55:58] the image and the glory of who God we
[1:56:00] understand now because God is one God if
[1:56:04] he is one God everything is single
[1:56:06] single single we understand that so when
[1:56:08] Adam is created he looks one person
[1:56:11] now let's go to the other one but
[1:56:15] are you okay the woman
[1:56:18] is the glory of the man not of God
[1:56:26] I'll let you soak that in
[1:56:28] everybody okay man is the glory of God
[1:56:33] but the woman is not the glory of God
[1:56:39] I'm going slowly
[1:56:41] a woman is the glory of man
[1:56:46] what does he mean
[1:56:49] in other words when you see Adam
[1:56:53] physically he's not supposed to be
[1:56:57] glorious
[1:57:00] are you following me please check
[1:57:03] somebody's head
[1:57:08] let me start it again
[1:57:10] let me sound it again
[1:57:12] if you see something that is glorious on
[1:57:16] your side how do you react to it
[1:57:20] how if you see something that looks
[1:57:22] glorious how do you react to it
[1:57:25] you'll be like wow
[1:57:27] everybody okay but now they say that if
[1:57:32] you look at Adam Adam is the glory of
[1:57:36] God
[1:57:37] but the glory of Adam was not Adam
[1:57:43] the glory of Adam was if
[1:57:49] everybody okay another word the glory of
[1:57:52] Adam was completely hidden in his
[1:57:58] come on I'm going slowly
[1:58:01] everybody okay another word if you look
[1:58:04] at Adam Adam doesn't have anything
[1:58:08] glorious
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:11] do you follow me in other words Adam was
[1:58:15] not beautiful
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:21] do you follow me
[1:58:23] So when you say where is Adam if Adam
[1:58:27] comes out you will see him that he
[1:58:29] doesn't look beautiful
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:32] if you look at the tiger you look at the
[1:58:36] Target man the tiger male is beautiful
[1:58:38] you look at the lion the man of a lion
[1:58:42] he's beautiful more than a female every
[1:58:45] Square Every Creature the man is always
[1:58:48] beautiful but when you look at Adam he
[1:58:51] doesn't look beautiful
[1:58:54] the glory of Adam is not in Adam
[1:58:57] [Applause]
[1:59:00] do you follow me do you follow me do you
[1:59:04] follow me if you wanna see the beauty of
[1:59:07] Adam

[1:59:29] in the image of God
[1:59:31] was not beautiful and the second Adam

[2:03:10] amen
[2:03:11] amen
[2:03:13] the Bible says behold my servant
[2:03:17] there is a scripture in Matthew that
[2:03:18] said Jesus was the servant of God
[2:03:20] beyond my servant shall deal prudently

[2:03:55] the cross until when you look at him he
[2:03:58] doesn't look like a human being anymore
[2:03:59] on the cross
[2:04:03] let's go back now to Paul
[2:04:07] Paul says
[2:04:09] as much as man is the image and the
[2:04:12] glory of who man is the image and the
[2:04:15] glory of God
[2:04:17] amen but Paul says that but the woman is
[2:04:21] the glory of who the man in other words
[2:04:24] when you look a man man is not beautiful
[2:04:30] everybody okay
[2:04:32] the beauty of Adam was healing inside of
[2:04:38] Adam
[2:04:42] everybody okay if you want to see her
[2:04:45] Adam is beautiful how Adam is glorious
[2:04:48] you need to find the wife of Adam

[2:04:56] how Adam look like you need to see his
[2:04:59] wife his wife tells you who Adam is
[2:05:05] amen
[2:05:11] Adam in the natural he came out one man
[2:05:16] and God said I'm gonna create his help
[2:05:21] we thought hey he's going to create his
[2:05:24] help so God is going to take another
[2:05:25] dirt and make something if he does that
[2:05:29] it's contrary to what he studied what he
[2:05:31] started was one person double you
[2:05:35] remember now if one person is double
[2:05:39] if I will need to make Eve where should
[2:05:42] I get Eve
[2:05:44] I need to go get his inside of Hope
[2:05:48] in other words Adam in his body has also
[2:05:53] two being hidden there
[2:05:56] everybody okay and one being called Eve
[2:06:00] was the one who is possible for the
[2:06:03] glory of Adam
[2:06:06] so as long as if doesn't come out you
[2:06:10] will never know the beauty of Adam
[2:06:13] you will never know the glory of Adam
[2:06:16] you will never have an idea how great
[2:06:20] Adam is

[2:06:25] are we okay if the body of the first
[2:06:29] Adam has two person Adam
[2:06:33] and Eve
[2:06:35] and the body of Jesus Christ came also
[2:06:39] with one person what do you think is

[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:04] sit God had never separated the water
[2:07:08] the bride from the water yet so when God
[2:07:12] looked down upon the Water the body of
[2:07:15] who of Christ slowly slowly the body of
[2:07:19] Hope Christ he saw above water and water
[2:07:22] female
[2:07:25] foreign

[2:07:37] female that were hidden in Jesus Christ
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:41] [Applause]
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:51] if Man was created in the image and the
[2:07:56] likeness of God and man is male and
[2:07:59] female
[2:08:00] and he's created in the image and the
[2:08:02] likeness of God how is that God then

[2:09:28] woman is the glory of the man how did
[2:09:32] the woman came out of man
[2:09:40] because whatever happened to the first
[2:09:42] Adam must also happen to the water
[2:09:45] second Adam so let's see how did the
[2:09:48] woman came out of the first Adam number

[2:10:52] Jesus Christ if Adam was male and female
[2:10:56] and to pull the Bride of Adam out of him
[2:11:00] they have to take the bread from the Sun
[2:11:04] You Follow Me Jesus who's the second

[2:11:43] church what happened God not open up the
[2:11:45] water inside of Adam and took out the

[2:11:49] the water the bride and God opened the
[2:11:52] side of who Jesus where at what Calvary
[2:11:56] and to cut his water right and when
[2:11:59] Jesus died remember the blood was not
[2:12:01] taken from the body until he was watered
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:05] [Applause]
[2:12:12] he already did what died and they was
[2:12:15] going to break his water and the prophet
[2:12:18] said they shall not break they shall not
[2:12:20] one bond be broken so they had done John
[2:12:23] Back the Water Heaven the hammered to
[2:12:26] break the leg and the man went up with
[2:12:28] the waters and did water pushed it
[2:12:31] through to his water it's hard

[2:12:58] I wish I have time to reach where I need
[2:13:01] to reach
[2:13:03] let's go to first John
[2:13:05] glory to God
[2:13:07] Hallelujah
[2:13:08] go to first John
[2:13:13] go to First John chapter 5.
[2:13:15] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:13:18] first John chapter 5 verse 6.
[2:13:22] amen
[2:13:23] amen
[2:13:24] you there
[2:13:26] verse six you there amen
[2:13:28] but Angelo you got amen let's go this is
[2:13:32] he
[2:13:34] amen let's go to verse 5 so it makes
[2:13:37] sense
[2:13:38] so I don't have question
[2:13:40] who is he that overcome the water the
[2:13:43] world but he that believed that Jesus is
[2:13:45] the water Son of God so we're talking
[2:13:47] about who
[2:13:48] Jesus The Who Son of God okay six this
[2:13:52] is he that came by water water and water
[2:13:57] blood if and who Jesus Christ so how was
[2:14:00] Jesus born
[2:14:03] by water and by what blood so Jesus
[2:14:07] Christ himself
[2:14:09] I'm going slowly Jesus Christ
[2:14:14] I hope you're getting what I'm saying
[2:14:16] amen
[2:14:18] the one who gave you birth himself
[2:14:21] because you cannot be born just like
[2:14:23] that
[2:14:24] you must first know how he was born and
[2:14:27] you must be born the same way because
[2:14:30] you and him you are so let's see how he
[2:14:33] was born
[2:14:36] the Bible said when Jesus was born Jesus
[2:14:40] was born with water
[2:14:43] and with water blood
[2:14:47] let's continue he said this is he that
[2:14:51] came by water water and water even who
[2:14:55] it is not by water only
[2:14:58] if it's just worth it we don't take it
[2:15:00] amen but by water and water and it is
[2:15:05] the spirit that beareth what witness
[2:15:07] because the spirit is water
[2:15:10] everybody okay everybody clear
[2:15:13] now for there are three that bear
[2:15:16] recorded water Heaven the Father the
[2:15:19] word and the Holy Ghost and this tree
[2:15:21] are what verse eight and there are three
[2:15:25] that bear witness in the water the
[2:15:27] waters and the water water and the water
[2:15:30] and these three are green water so Jesus
[2:15:34] Christ himself his birth was by water
[2:15:36] and water blood stop let's go to Calvary
[2:15:41] and see what come out of Jesus Christ
[2:15:44] go to the Book of John chapter 19.
[2:15:50] let's go to John chapter 19.
[2:15:54] glory to God if you dare you can say
[2:15:56] Amen John 19 verse 30.
[2:16:00] Hallelujah
[2:16:03] you there
[2:16:04] you there
[2:16:05] when Jesus therefore had to received the
[2:16:08] vinegar he said it is water finish and
[2:16:12] he bowed his head and gave up the water
[2:16:15] in other words Jesus was dead
[2:16:18] if you notice the bread is not out here
[2:16:22] yet
[2:16:23] nobody peace Jesus Christ before the
[2:16:26] peace Adam Adam must be completely
[2:16:29] and before the peace Jesus Christ he
[2:16:32] must be completely dead
[2:16:36] the tap never misses
[2:16:39] everybody okay so according to John 19
[2:16:42] verse 30 the ghost of Jesus Christ
[2:16:45] already left his body and the body with
[2:16:48] her spirit James said he is dead verse
[2:16:51] 31 they choose therefore because he was
[2:16:54] the preparation that the body should not
[2:16:56] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day
[2:16:58] for the Sabbath day was high and good in
[2:17:01] time it's just Where We Are
[2:17:04] so
[2:17:05] uchilat amen
[2:17:07] upon the cross on the Sabbath day for
[2:17:10] the Sabbath day was a high day besought
[2:17:12] palate that their leg might be watered
[2:17:15] and that they might be taken away then
[2:17:18] came the soldier and broke the leg of
[2:17:21] the first and the other and of the other
[2:17:24] which was crucified with him but
[2:17:28] you ready
[2:17:29] when they came to Jesus and so that he
[2:17:34] was already dead
[2:17:38] so somebody must Testify the death
[2:17:43] before the bride people because if they
[2:17:46] pulled the brand and Jesus is still
[2:17:49] alive something is wrong
[2:17:51] they must make sure that Jesus is
[2:17:53] completely dead they kick him they move
[2:17:56] around they do everything he's dead he
[2:17:59] pronounced dead the medical doctor said
[2:18:01] dead
[2:18:03] yeah man
[2:18:04] everybody okay
[2:18:06] and they saw that he was dead already
[2:18:08] they broke not his leg
[2:18:11] but one of the soldiers with the water
[2:18:15] speed peace is water
[2:18:20] Kama and forth with in other words
[2:18:23] immediately camera came there out what
[2:18:27] blood and water and water when Jesus
[2:18:30] Christ came he came with water blood and
[2:18:33] water water in other words the birth of
[2:18:35] Eve must be the same the birth of the
[2:18:40] blood of Jesus Christ must be exactly
[2:18:43] the way he he was born himself
[2:18:49] everybody okay

[2:22:09] careful
[2:22:10] don't let it leave you God never got a
[2:22:13] handful of dust and made an evil she had
[2:22:16] been a different what creation she's not
[2:22:19] a creation she was a water by flesh and
[2:22:22] God goes off in the water
[2:22:25] this water rather from under his what
[2:22:29] and take a whip to make a water a wife
[2:22:32] and the Very part of Adam water spirit
[2:22:35] was in the water the woman and day two
[2:22:39] are what one how so and what body and
[2:22:43] what Spirit they are what one stop they
[2:22:46] are perfect what Oneness
[2:22:51] brother Branham say body
[2:22:55] spirit
[2:22:58] and so
[2:22:59] they are what
[2:23:02] so in the body we just check it
[2:23:05] we find that the body was pierced
[2:23:07] something came out
[2:23:09] amen we need to find out the spirit
[2:23:14] everybody okay brother Branham continues
[2:23:17] he says he says they are one they are
[2:23:20] they are perfect Oneness a real woman a
[2:23:23] real husband a real wife they are one
[2:23:26] together what is a type of
[2:23:29] Christ from out of his water
[2:23:32] noted by product not a water Methodist
[2:23:35] or a water or a water Pentecostal
[2:23:41] no sir but out of his own heart she he
[2:23:45] took a water sweetheart that is pure and
[2:23:49] loyal as she can be she is a lawyer as a
[2:23:53] water look back there at Solomon
[2:23:56] speaking come my love let us walk in the
[2:24:00] pomegranate let us take a feel of love
[2:24:02] and when the real Believers are a
[2:24:05] Believer open his arm with a pure heart
[2:24:08] and he holds up to class that affection
[2:24:11] of that lover of Christ goes into his
[2:24:14] water it is his water just like a
[2:24:18] husband does to a real what why now
[2:24:22] we found out that the man is not
[2:24:26] beautiful
[2:24:27] the beauty of a man is hidden in his
[2:24:30] wife
[2:24:31] amen so the beauty of a man must be seen
[2:24:35] on the woman that's why in the human
[2:24:38] race the woman is the most beautiful
[2:24:43] that beauty reflects the beauty of a man
[2:24:48] everybody okay
[2:24:50] where are we going now by a person for
[2:24:54] the man is not of the water the woman
[2:24:57] but the woman of the water the man it
[2:24:59] was Adam that appears and pulled the
[2:25:02] wife over there they never Pierce Eve to
[2:25:04] pull out
[2:25:05] everybody okay
[2:25:06] Paul say neither was the Man created for
[2:25:10] the water the woman because the man was
[2:25:12] already there but he was the woman for
[2:25:14] the water because man was alone
[2:25:17] we clear on that for this course
[2:25:20] ought to the woman to have power on her
[2:25:23] head because of what the angels we
[2:25:25] already know that
[2:25:26] let's deal with the spirit put your seat
[2:25:29] belt very well and stay alert
[2:25:33] methodless
[2:25:35] everybody okay neither is the man
[2:25:38] without the what the woman needed the
[2:25:41] woman without the what the man in the
[2:25:43] water lord
[2:25:50] in the Lord
[2:25:51] in the Lord you cannot have a man
[2:25:55] without a female
[2:25:58] am I reading a different Bible and you
[2:26:01] cannot when you get in the Lord if you
[2:26:04] see a woman there must be a man and if
[2:26:07] you see a man there must be a movement
[2:26:09] in the Lord you can never have a female
[2:26:12] alone
[2:26:15] the female is always associated with the
[2:26:19] man and the man is always associated
[2:26:22] with the female because in the beginning
[2:26:24] God created them
[2:26:27] and God bless them and he called them
[2:26:31] Adam and both of them were
[2:26:36] in the Lord
[2:26:38] has in the Lord mean
[2:26:44] when you say in the Lord it means what
[2:26:49] open second Corinthians
[2:26:54] glory to God
[2:26:56] let's go to Second Corinthians chapter
[2:26:58] 3.
[2:26:59] what does in the Lord means
[2:27:02] we don't read the Bible just like that
[2:27:06] in the Lord in the body we found out
[2:27:09] that Jesus in his body he was male and
[2:27:12] what female now we need to go back to
[2:27:14] the spirit of Jesus
[2:27:16] to find what happened in the spirit of
[2:27:18] Jesus but Paul said in the Lord
[2:27:21] okay you cannot have a man without a
[2:27:25] female and you cannot have a female
[2:27:27] without a man but we need to know in the
[2:27:30] Lord means what let's go to Second
[2:27:32] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17.
[2:27:35] if you dare you can say amen amen
[2:27:39] everybody okay
[2:27:41] everybody okay
[2:27:42] you there what Angel are you there yes
[2:27:45] sir all right let's go now the Lord
[2:27:50] is the water spirit stop
[2:27:54] so the Lord means the spirit
[2:27:58] and Paul is saying in the Lord in other
[2:28:02] words in the spirit
[2:28:07] of God
[2:28:09] you cannot find a male without a female
[2:28:13] or you cannot find a female without a
[2:28:17] man in other word the spirit of the Lord
[2:28:20] has a male and a female
[2:28:28] a letter soak it
[2:28:31] let me go straight again
[2:28:33] you cannot help a man
[2:28:36] without a female you cannot have a
[2:28:39] female without a man in the water
[2:28:41] because man when he was created he was
[2:28:44] male and female and he was created in
[2:28:47] the image and in the likeness of who so
[2:28:51] God is male and female and matador is
[2:28:55] the mayor and the female spirit in the
[2:28:59] deity
[2:29:01] in other words the Holy Ghost has a man
[2:29:05] and a female
[2:29:11] I let you swallow that
[2:29:14] keep swallowing
[2:29:17] keep swallowing
[2:29:20] I know where you're struggling
[2:29:22] I know
[2:29:24] I know where you're struggling I'll let
[2:29:26] you keep struggling a little bit for a
[2:29:28] few seconds
[2:29:29] because your problem is so we got a
[2:29:31] female Holy Ghost that's that that's
[2:29:34] what you have keep following you keep
[2:29:36] struggling first
[2:29:39] yeah you ready
[2:29:41] you ready
[2:29:42] you ready let's continue to read
[2:29:45] for the Lord is the water and where the
[2:29:49] spirit of the who the Lord is there is
[2:29:53] water
[2:29:54] so Paul is saying in the Lord
[2:29:57] there is nowhere
[2:29:59] without a woman and there is no female
[2:30:01] without a man in other words in the
[2:30:04] spirit of the Lord there is male and
[2:30:06] female and man at the beginning was
[2:30:08] created in the image and the likeness of
[2:30:11] who God if man is male and female god
[2:30:15] also is man and a female the tree of
[2:30:18] life was water
[2:30:20] you remember wisdom was water
[2:30:23] so what are you struggling
[2:30:26] when I say the Holy Ghost is male and
[2:30:29] female now you start running away
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:35] when I say the tree of life is male and
[2:30:37] female you say Amen
[2:30:41] [Applause]
[2:30:43] you ready
[2:30:45] so according to Paul
[2:30:48] We Ready God also
[2:30:52] is water
[2:30:55] female
[2:30:57] to make it clear the Holy Ghost
[2:31:04] I'm preaching to this church anyway is
[2:31:07] water male
[2:31:09] female
[2:31:13] brother Stephen
[2:31:14] so we got a man holy ghost and we got a
[2:31:17] female Holy Ghost the Bible say bye one
[2:31:20] Spirit how can one Spirit be male and
[2:31:23] female
[2:31:25] one
[2:31:27] you awake
[2:31:29] you awake
[2:31:31] are you awake

[2:31:38] deity

[2:31:50] Mel and female in God in the deity have
[2:31:57] nothing to do with sex
[2:32:04] and now you start to relaxing now
[2:32:07] whoever was like this is now
[2:32:10] your blood pressure is coming back to
[2:32:12] normal everybody okay when we say men
[2:32:16] and women when we say brother Angelo is
[2:32:19] a man sister geruchi is a female you
[2:32:22] know what you're thinking about
[2:32:24] you want to take that application to God
[2:32:27] that's where you struggling
[2:32:31] it doesn't go like that
[2:32:33] everybody okay Daddy's in the body
[2:32:37] it's male and female male and female
[2:32:41] male and female in the deity
[2:32:44] in God when you get in the spirit of God
[2:32:48] Amen the spirit of God is also one but
[2:32:53] that spirit is male and female the male
[2:32:58] and female have nothing to do with sex
[2:33:05] everybody okay what does he have to do
[2:33:09] then
[2:33:12] you okay
[2:33:15] the spirit of God is here
[2:33:19] everybody okay everybody okay this
[2:33:22] spirit of God is one
[2:33:25] but one doesn't mean one according to
[2:33:29] you
[2:33:30] because Adam was one man
[2:33:33] but Adam was
[2:33:36] because the truth shall be and if you
[2:33:39] have Adam with that if you don't have
[2:33:41] Adam
[2:33:42] if you have if without Adam you don't
[2:33:44] have Adam so for you to have Adam you
[2:33:47] must have Adam and Eve together for you
[2:33:49] to have brother John you must have the
[2:33:51] body of body jump the spirit of Brother
[2:33:54] John and the soul of Brother John then
[2:33:56] you have brother John if you only have
[2:33:59] the body of Brother John you only have
[2:34:00] portion of Brother John the three are
[2:34:04] makes sense so Oneness in the scripture
[2:34:07] is different than your whiteness
[2:34:12] we Okay we okay when you see me you see
[2:34:15] what I am my father are water why whose
[2:34:19] son the father
[2:34:20] who's in the father they only see Jesus
[2:34:22] Christ
[2:34:23] you see what I'm saying now when we say
[2:34:26] this is the Holy Ghost follow me
[2:34:28] carefully
[2:34:30] the Holy Ghost is one
[2:34:32] but that one is double
[2:34:36] because Man was created in the image and
[2:34:39] likeness of what that double means what
[2:34:47] everybody okay
[2:34:48] the female Holy Ghost
[2:34:52] you're following me
[2:34:54] what is it
[2:34:56] the female Holy Ghost
[2:34:59] is the portion of the Holy Spirit
[2:35:04] responsible to fill the bread of Jesus
[2:35:08] Christ

[2:35:12] if it's your hand
[2:35:20] thank you my brother follow me carefully
[2:35:23] Jesus said
[2:35:25] it is expedient
[2:35:27] for me to do what
[2:35:30] because if I go I will send you the
[2:35:32] water
[2:35:34] the comforter which is the
[2:35:36] on the day of Pentecost
[2:35:39] the Holy Ghost came down
[2:35:42] do you follow me the one who came down
[2:35:44] was the pillar of Fire and the pillar of
[2:35:47] fire was the fullness of the godhead
[2:35:52] are you following me when the pillar of
[2:35:55] fire came he found
[2:35:58] 120 people only
[2:36:02] you follow me the pillar of fire begin
[2:36:05] to divide himself
[2:36:07] one two three four five five all the way
[2:36:11] to 120. you're following me you're

[2:37:18] why Paul when he was on the road to
[2:37:20] Damascus he saw the pillar of fire back
[2:37:23] again

[2:37:28] that was in the disciple came off of
[2:37:30] them and made the pillar of fire again
[2:37:32] no no no no no no no the pillar of fire

[2:54:31] God and their spirit that is John with
[2:54:36] what God is what one spirit let me go
[2:54:40] back here

[2:54:59] God and the spirit that is joy
[2:55:03] join us
[2:55:08] [Applause]
[2:55:10] this message is deeper than you think
[2:55:14] in other words God
[2:55:17] demand Jesus Christ and the spirit the
[2:55:21] Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ and the Holy
[2:55:24] Ghost
[2:55:25] that is making the bread both holy
[2:55:28] ghosts are one Holy Ghost
[2:55:33] the holy ghost that was in Jesus Christ
[2:55:35] and the holy ghost that you receive in
[2:55:38] your baptism both Holy Ghost are
[2:55:42] God and the spirit that is joined the
[2:55:46] wife with God is what one spirit that is
[2:55:50] right now the spirit of God that dwell
[2:55:53] in their church is the spirit that comes
[2:55:56] from where Heaven that God knew where
[2:55:59] before foreign
[2:56:09] do you understand
[2:56:11] do you understand do you understand
[2:56:13] God who is in heaven and the spirit of
[2:56:17] God that is in the church the Holy Ghost
[2:56:20] on the male version and the female Holy
[2:56:24] Ghost which is the version of the Holy
[2:56:27] Ghost in the church both of those Holy
[2:56:29] Ghost is just one Holy Ghost
[2:56:33] but this is the key I'm trying to stop
[2:56:36] here
[2:56:37] brother Branham say that God they now
[2:56:41] the spirit of God that dwell in the
[2:56:43] Water Church the female
[2:56:46] okay is the spirit that comes from what
[2:56:49] heaven that God knew before the water
[2:56:53] remember that wisdom when God created
[2:56:56] that wisdom was with her you remember
[2:56:58] and then that spirit
[2:57:01] that uh before the foundation of the
[2:57:04] world that rejected the water
[2:57:06] and that Spirit had to take a water to
[2:57:10] take his water he had to come flesh like
[2:57:14] this other did and all of them put in
[2:57:16] water in other words your Holy Ghost
[2:57:21] that is resisting the devil today
[2:57:24] already was with God before the
[2:57:28] foundation of the world
[2:57:33] in other words you're standing this
[2:57:36] message that's not surpass God
[2:57:39] you already stood for the message long
[2:57:43] time ago
[2:57:44] [Applause]
[2:57:49] the one who stood for the message was
[2:57:53] not you he was your Holy Ghost
[2:57:56] [Applause]
[2:57:58] your portion of the Holy Ghost is what
[2:58:02] resisted the devil that's why when you
[2:58:05] are filled with the Holy Ghost there is
[2:58:08] nothing the devil will do
[2:58:10] because before the foundation of the
[2:58:13] world you fought the devil you overcome
[2:58:16] the devil you resisted the devil all you
[2:58:20] need is God to God and say give me my

[2:59:17] they therefore want you to understand
[2:59:18] that you and God are different you are

[3:07:13] I hope you understand what it is
[3:07:16] so when you ask God for the Holy Ghost
[3:07:19] don't be coming like you are asking
[3:07:22] something that that you don't even know
[3:07:24] what you're talking about
[3:07:28] change your prayer
[3:07:30] tell God you know me
[3:07:34] I wish I can there are stuff Beyond this
[3:07:37] that will turn you upside down
[3:07:40] tell God you know me me and you we
[3:07:43] existed before
[3:07:47] what I'm asking is not something new
[3:07:50] it's something that belongs to me
[3:07:53] I am held to that if you go look he says
[3:07:58] my name on it
[3:07:59] that's what I'm asking
[3:08:01] give me my mountain
[3:08:03] [Applause]
[3:08:11] young people
[3:08:13] the Holy Ghost
[3:08:18] you need the Holy Ghost Lord when are
[3:08:20] you going to fill me with that no no no
[3:08:22] no no no no no no no no no no no no
[3:08:25] it's God who's watching you claiming you
[3:08:30] to present you to himself a church with
[3:08:35] that spot with that the Flemish that
[3:08:38] will be holy and without blemish why
[3:08:41] because in him before the foundation of
[3:08:44] the world he already predestinated you
[3:08:47] to be holy without blemish that's why
[3:08:51] he's just implementing his plan in you
[3:08:55] all you have to do is just surrender
[3:08:57] [Applause]
[3:09:04] you're begging for something that
[3:09:05] belongs to you
[3:09:07] talk to God honestly you say father help
[3:09:10] me now I understand that you have
[3:09:13] predestined me to have the Holy Ghost so
[3:09:16] the Holy Ghost is not something that is
[3:09:18] just there that I'm guessing whether I'm
[3:09:20] going to receive or not it is something
[3:09:22] that belongs to me there is a portion of
[3:09:25] you called The Bride
[3:09:28] part of that brother so they gotta be a
[3:09:30] portion of the holy spirit that belongs
[3:09:33] to me to make me and me a new one
[3:09:37] give me that portion that's all I need
[3:09:41] that is my representation
[3:09:47] that is your name
[3:09:50] that is your personal revelation of
[3:09:55] Jesus Christ to you not to somebody else
[3:09:59] that's why people receive the Holy Ghost
[3:10:01] different way somebody might fell on the
[3:10:04] ground somebody begin to dance somebody
[3:10:06] because it depends if your Holy Ghost
[3:10:08] has a program to dance when he will come
[3:10:11] you find yourself dancing like this and
[3:10:13] you are filled with the Holy Spirit
[3:10:17] foreign
[3:10:29] [Applause]
[3:10:34] [Applause]
[3:10:39] for me to stop
[3:10:41] we will continue again let's pray
[3:10:43] Heavenly Father
[3:10:45] Lord we are approaching you humbly this
[3:10:47] morning

[3:11:10] this great mystery of Christ and his
[3:11:13] church
[3:11:14] of the whiteness of God
[3:11:17] where we and you We Are One
[3:11:21] father the plan became so clear
[3:11:24] that now we understand who we are

[3:11:33] Prophet could say that I realized that

[3:11:46] fighting Lucifer in heaven father we
[3:11:49] were fighting with you we all became
[3:11:51] Lucifer that's why even today there is
[3:11:55] something in us that has a match with
[3:11:57] the devil there is something in this
[3:11:59] house that always click with this
[3:12:02] message no murder the Temptation no
[3:12:05] matter how hard the trial of life but we
[3:12:08] found ourselves at the end of the day

[3:12:33] their own bedroom
[3:12:34] in their own vehicle and work where they
