[38:40] the lord in our spirits
[38:44] he's blessed us with a song service that
[38:47] was very
[38:49] moving and relaxing to my spirit
[38:55] and i believe he wants to further settle
[38:57] us down so that we can focus in upon him
[39:00] and allow him to move as he wills
[39:04] [Music]
[39:08] and just right now my
[39:11] precious brother mike holloway is on my
[39:13] heart
[39:15] and i just would like to enter into
[39:17] prayer
[39:19] for him and i know there are many
[39:23] other needs in the building
[39:26] and those that might be streaming i know
[39:28] there's needs among all of god's people
[39:33] so let's pray for one another saints
[39:38] heavenly father
[39:41] we're so undeserving of anything lord
[39:48] i have to say that first father
[39:52] because for anything that has been done
[39:55] it's been completely by your grace
[40:00] none of us lord can boast of anything
[40:03] father or feel like we worked for it or
[40:06] we merited it lord god we didn't deserve
[40:09] anything
[40:10] lord but just to see the richness of
[40:15] your love
[40:15] and your mercy that you
[40:18] constantly pour out upon our lives on a
[40:21] daily basis father all we can do
[40:23] is say thank you jesus
[40:27] thank you jesus and lord have mercy on
[40:30] us all
[40:31] [Music]
[40:33] father there are many things that are
[40:35] going on right now
[40:36] you know all about them there's nothing
[40:38] that we can say to you
[40:40] that you don't already know but you
[40:41] ordained and we come to you in prayer
[40:45] it's an expression of our faith lord
[40:50] that we believe that if we come
[40:51] according to your word
[40:53] father you are answered according to
[40:55] your promise
[40:58] through what you've done for us at
[40:59] calvary lord
[41:02] you made a way for us father to come
[41:04] back home
[41:06] lord we pray for those that are maybe
[41:09] battling within their bodies tonight
[41:13] for many different reasons lord we want
[41:15] to say thank you for keeping our brother
[41:17] holloway
[41:18] and may you continue to strengthen and
[41:20] bless and heal
[41:21] him by your grace
[41:24] and for all the unspoken prayer requests
[41:27] father that are upon your children's
[41:29] hearts
[41:29] my heart lord god we pray that you will
[41:32] be merciful to us father
[41:34] and that you will move upon each request
[41:38] lord forgive us of our sins and our
[41:42] iniquities lord jesus
[41:45] father we never desire to hurt you lord
[41:47] or to go contrary to your word
[41:50] it's been our whole heart's desire this
[41:52] whole time
[41:53] to continue to yield ourselves to you
[41:56] lord
[41:57] so that you can be pleased father
[42:03] we know it's nothing that we can do to
[42:07] to work for anything from you father but
[42:09] from our hearts because you revealed
[42:11] yourself to us and we see your goodness
[42:13] and your kindness and
[42:15] all that you are lord it makes us want
[42:18] to give our all to you
[42:19] help us to do that lord we want to
[42:23] father
[42:23] you see it lord please help us to do
[42:25] that
[42:27] this is your service tonight lord these
[42:30] are your people tonight father
[42:33] lord we ask that you would please come
[42:34] and help us all
[42:35] [Music]
[42:38] you know how to minister to your needs
[42:40] of all of your children you know each
[42:42] one of us in particular
[42:45] may you be able to have your way lord
[42:47] may you not be hindered we pray
[42:51] and we ask all these things in your name
[42:54] the name of our lord and savior jesus
[42:56] christ let the church say amen
[43:00] let's give the lord a hand clapper
[43:01] praises
[43:03] praise the lord
[43:10] i thank god for the invitation of being
[43:13] able to be here
[43:15] um it's a pleasure
[43:20] i think this is my third time here now i
[43:23] think three
[43:24] right three times i think
[43:27] and uh it's just it's a pleasure to be
[43:30] able to come among you
[43:33] and i'm not just saying that it's just a
[43:34] good atmosphere
[43:36] and the brother that was leading the
[43:38] song service he did a
[43:40] phenomenal joke he's built for the job
[43:47] [Applause]
[43:52] i couldn't even stand still out there to
[43:54] pacing back and forth
[43:56] hey man just at the atmosphere not
[43:59] necessarily
[44:00] good music good singing but it's just
[44:03] when it's coming from the right heart
[44:05] and the right source
[44:08] it carries something different something
[44:11] you can feel
[44:13] i was outside the door but it was an
[44:15] anointing
[44:16] that i could feel and that's just god
[44:19] working through his gifts
[44:22] he was ministering to me
[44:25] praise the lord so it's good to see
[44:28] everybody god bless you god bless you
[44:30] brother stephen
[44:31] your family brother kelly the other
[44:35] minister brothers that might be in here
[44:36] that i
[44:37] i'm not aware of right now the musicians
[44:40] god bless you
[44:42] amen i don't want to keep you standing
[44:44] long so let's get right into the word
[44:51] uh
[44:54] i want to go to hebrews chapter 5.
[45:03] hebrews chapter 5.
[45:10] i want to start at verse 1.
[45:14] it says for every high priest taken from
[45:16] among men is ordained for
[45:19] men and things pertaining to god
[45:22] that he may offer both gifts and
[45:24] sacrifices for sins
[45:27] so i really want to focus in on these
[45:29] next few verses saints
[45:32] it says who can have compassion on the
[45:35] ignorant
[45:36] and on them that are out of the way
[45:40] and this is he's going to give you the
[45:42] reason why he's able to do that
[45:45] it says for that he himself also is
[45:47] compass with infirmity
[45:51] and by reason hereof he ought ask for
[45:54] the people
[45:55] so also for himself to offer for sins
[46:00] amen let's go to galatians chapter 6.
[46:05] galatians 6.
[46:11] i want to start at verse 1.
[46:18] it says brethren if a man be overtaken
[46:20] in a fault
[46:23] pay close and let's just not gloss over
[46:25] this saints
[46:27] because the lord has been really dealing
[46:29] with me in this for some time now
[46:32] if i can say it in this way the lord has
[46:34] been deflating me
[46:37] it's been very humbling and i say that
[46:40] with sincerity
[46:43] i believe it's something that means a
[46:45] lot to god
[46:46] it says brethren if a man be overtaken
[46:48] in a fault ye
[46:50] notice what he says now ye which are
[46:54] spiritual notice the thought he says
[46:57] restore
[47:00] see that's the mindset
[47:04] restore such a one in the spirit of
[47:07] meekness
[47:09] now notice like the like the high priest
[47:12] in hebrews 5
[47:16] there was a way in which god wanted him
[47:18] to approach those sacrifices and those
[47:20] offerings
[47:21] it's a mindset
[47:24] it was an internal atmosphere that god
[47:27] needed for him to have
[47:30] so now it's moved from the priests to
[47:32] just
[47:34] any of the saints
[47:37] when you see somebody overtaken in a
[47:39] fault
[47:41] god as god is emphasizing he's taking
[47:43] the time to say these specific things
[47:45] through paul
[47:47] because it's something that he wants his
[47:49] his bride to understand
[47:54] it says ye which are spiritual restore
[47:58] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[48:02] he says considering thyself
[48:08] amen he says lest thou also be
[48:11] tempted he says bear ye one another's
[48:14] burdens
[48:16] and so fulfill the law of christ
[48:20] for if a man think himself to be
[48:22] something
[48:24] when he is nothing
[48:27] how many in here something tonight
[48:35] we don't even want to scratch out here
[48:37] right now
[48:40] for if a man think himself to be
[48:42] something when he is nothing
[48:44] notice he deceiveth himself
[48:49] let's just pray once more heavenly
[48:50] father help us we pray
[48:53] god we need you in jesus christ holy and
[48:55] precious name we ask it
[48:57] amen amen god bless you saying she may
[49:01] be seated
[49:18] so tonight by the grace of god same side
[49:22] i want to deal with a topic of
[49:26] effective prayer
[49:30] effective prayer
[49:34] as i just finished saying there are
[49:36] certain things that mean a lot to god
[49:40] and one of those things saints is
[49:44] how you and i think toward one another
[49:47] and how we handle one another
[49:52] and not just us in the church
[49:56] but but when we go out to our workplaces
[50:00] and to the grocery stores and and out in
[50:03] the world
[50:03] it it it god watches us
[50:07] because there is a reflection that he's
[50:09] looking for
[50:12] and that reflection is by nature
[50:16] i actually thought i was going to preach
[50:18] on that tonight by nature
[50:20] but that's not the way i feel led
[50:24] but how god is see what and i love this
[50:27] and it makes it easy to follow god
[50:30] because whatever he's requiring of us is
[50:33] what he
[50:34] is
[50:39] i was a supervisor for a number of years
[50:43] and i would never ask the people
[50:46] that the lord allowed me to be over to
[50:48] do anything that i wouldn't do myself
[50:53] i rather go and do it myself so that
[50:56] they can actu i can give them an example
[51:00] he's not above that he's right down
[51:02] there with us he'll come down
[51:04] and do the lowest jobs
[51:07] i would go and i would sweep and i would
[51:09] clean and i let them go in and relax
[51:13] but it was for i wanted to show them
[51:15] something i wanted him to be able to see
[51:17] that he doesn't he's not
[51:18] he's not high like that he he actually
[51:21] is a humble brother
[51:23] he doesn't mind working hard so when he
[51:25] tells me to do something
[51:27] i can have more respect for that because
[51:30] i know where it's coming from it's
[51:31] coming from a right heart
[51:34] he cares about the people but see
[51:37] concerning us saints god he cares about
[51:41] like i said how we think about other
[51:43] people and how we handle other people
[51:46] as we speak about the adoption and all
[51:48] you know those things like that you know
[51:50] it's certain things that are kind of
[51:52] keyed in upon
[51:53] you know the power part and the position
[51:55] part and thing
[51:56] but but this right here is just as much
[51:58] a part of it
[51:59] it's a very key part of it
[52:03] because it actually is the manifestation
[52:06] of the character
[52:10] being able to conduct the father's
[52:13] business
[52:14] and he's in the business of saving souls
[52:19] we're still in a time of grace isn't
[52:22] that right
[52:24] isn't that right many people that we
[52:27] witness to they may never be able to
[52:29] come into this message
[52:30] they may not be able to be ordained to
[52:32] that
[52:33] but they have a place you understand
[52:37] what i'm saying
[52:39] and god has a uh uh um
[52:44] we have orders each one of us
[52:48] within our individual lives brother
[52:51] branham said that's the reason why you
[52:52] stay in the neighborhood you stay in
[52:54] that's the reason why you work at the
[52:56] job that you work in
[52:57] because god made you with a certain
[52:59] makeup
[53:01] better be able to reach people and touch
[53:04] people
[53:05] that if i came into your place at your
[53:07] job i wouldn't be as effective
[53:12] amen and i'm a witness of that
[53:16] praise the lord but i'm talking about
[53:18] effective prayer tonight so god
[53:20] he desires for his people to be in a
[53:23] certain frame of mind when it comes to
[53:25] helping others
[53:28] and even when it comes to praying for
[53:30] others
[53:32] how many times saints have myself
[53:35] i'm gonna use myself as an example
[53:38] people come up to you and they say hey
[53:40] brother
[53:40] i need you to pray with me sometimes
[53:43] they may tell you what it is sometimes
[53:45] they may not
[53:47] but how many times and i say this to my
[53:50] shame
[53:51] how many times have i been asked to pray
[53:53] for somebody
[53:54] and i say yes i'll do that and then go
[53:56] off and forget about it
[54:00] or or not not consider
[54:04] what what really just took place because
[54:06] if somebody
[54:07] thinks enough of you to come to you
[54:11] and say brother so listen it's a reason
[54:13] why they came in you were not somebody
[54:15] else
[54:18] something strikes them about you
[54:20] something they see within you
[54:22] that made them feel led to come to you
[54:24] because maybe they felt like look if
[54:26] this person prays for me
[54:28] i feel like they'll be more sincere
[54:32] but how often even in those times when
[54:34] somebody comes to confide in us
[54:36] to ask prayer with them it's not even
[54:40] handled right
[54:43] we don't handle it as our own
[54:50] we may pray but it's like it ain't the
[54:53] same kind of prayer
[54:57] as though it was a prayer for yourself
[54:59] or so or your loved one or something
[55:01] that you're going through
[55:06] there's many times a disconnect
[55:16] turn with me saying if you will to
[55:24] amen let's go to luke chapter seven
[55:30] if you see or you know about a brother
[55:32] or sister that's overcoming a fault
[55:36] he said ye which are spiritual
[55:42] that means that you have a certain walk
[55:44] with god
[55:46] you you you you have a certain amount of
[55:48] yielding
[55:51] that's been established in your life to
[55:53] the things of god
[55:55] you have a relationship with god amen
[56:00] you have the holy ghost
[56:03] now i want to touch upon that real
[56:05] carefully now
[56:08] because the holy ghost having the
[56:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:11] doesn't exempt us from making mistakes
[56:14] you can have the baptism of the holy
[56:16] ghost and still handle people wrong
[56:26] you can have the baptism of the holy
[56:28] ghost and it's going out you go outside
[56:29] and it's
[56:30] raining you'll get wet like everybody
[56:31] else right
[56:33] spirits can land upon anybody
[56:37] self-righteous spiritual spirits
[56:44] and cause us at times to look at people
[56:47] wrong
[56:51] to learn about somebody's mistakes or
[56:53] failures or faults
[56:54] and be more ready to talk about
[56:57] something and ain't praying about
[56:58] nothing
[57:06] and how do you know that god didn't let
[57:08] you come across that situation
[57:12] bring out your reaction so that he can
[57:15] turn around and show
[57:16] you where you need help at
[57:20] because when you're the one that fails
[57:22] when you're the one that falls
[57:25] how often and how easy it is for us to
[57:27] be absent-minded
[57:29] of how we feel when we're asking god for
[57:31] prayer
[57:33] and forgiveness
[57:39] that's what god wants us to be mindful
[57:41] of he says when you are spiritual
[57:43] you go but remember yourself
[57:47] that'll change how you go
[57:51] how to change the atmosphere
[57:54] [Music]
[57:58] now an atmosphere of love
[58:02] humility how
[58:05] what's bringing out about saints because
[58:07] you you're able to see yourself
[58:09] lord if it wasn't for your grace that'll
[58:11] be me
[58:13] i'll be the one that's fallen i'll be
[58:15] the one that's out
[58:16] i'll be the one that's backslidden in
[58:18] today for your grace and your power
[58:24] that goes for every one of us in here if
[58:27] it wasn't for the grace of god as the
[58:30] song says
[58:32] where will we be we wouldn't be here
[58:35] tonight
[58:37] some people may not have some some some
[58:39] of us some of us in here may not have
[58:41] wanted to even come
[58:42] come tonight there was battles that was
[58:48] present
[58:52] notice this in luke chapter 7
[58:56] starting at verse 36 and one of the
[58:58] pharisees desired him that he would eat
[59:00] with him
[59:01] and he went into the pharisees house and
[59:03] sat down to meet
[59:05] and behold a woman in the city which was
[59:07] a sinner
[59:09] when she knew that jesus sat at meeting
[59:11] the pharisees house
[59:12] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[59:16] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[59:20] and began to wash his feet with tears
[59:22] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[59:24] head and kissed his feet
[59:26] and anointed them with the ointment now
[59:29] notice this now
[59:32] now when the pharisee which had been him
[59:35] saw it
[59:37] he spake within himself not allowed
[59:43] within himself
[59:47] our prophet taught us that our thoughts
[59:49] are heard louder in heaven
[59:51] than what our words are on the earth
[59:56] god don't want us to get comfortable
[59:58] with lip service
[1:00:01] it's good to sing songs it's good to
[1:00:03] praise the lord it's good to speak the
[1:00:05] word
[1:00:07] but god cares more about what's in that
[1:00:09] heart
[1:00:12] he said how can you be in evil speak
[1:00:15] good things
[1:00:17] he said these people honored me with
[1:00:19] their mouth but their heart is far from
[1:00:21] me
[1:00:25] he wanted something that was of more
[1:00:27] value
[1:00:31] amen think about it isn't that what we
[1:00:34] want
[1:00:35] for the people that we're associated
[1:00:37] with we don't want somebody that's just
[1:00:39] acting the part around us but despise us
[1:00:42] in their hearts
[1:00:44] isn't that right we call that what
[1:00:46] two-faced it
[1:00:48] none of us want that around us do we
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:52] how much more god
[1:01:01] lord brother i've been two-faced it at
[1:01:05] times
[1:01:08] with my lord
[1:01:11] and he sees everything
[1:01:18] see this is a real love relationship
[1:01:20] that he's calling us to now
[1:01:22] this ain't just some religious show or
[1:01:25] ritual or
[1:01:26] getting used to some routine or some
[1:01:28] program no god's calling for a wife
[1:01:32] ain't that somebody that loved him
[1:01:33] somebody that want to be
[1:01:35] with him somebody that desires to spend
[1:01:37] quality time with him
[1:01:39] not despising and trying to see i didn't
[1:01:41] get out of it until
[1:01:43] trouble comes
[1:01:46] not everyone act loving and kind and all
[1:01:49] that engaged
[1:01:50] whenever trouble strikes
[1:01:53] amen but him being god he see all of
[1:01:58] that
[1:02:03] he said behold an israelite in whom
[1:02:05] there is no god
[1:02:08] when did you know me before philip
[1:02:11] called you i saw you
[1:02:19] amen god wants something that's real
[1:02:22] and i say lord help me to give you
[1:02:24] something that's real
[1:02:26] that's the whole part of our journey
[1:02:28] saints
[1:02:30] that transition that transition from
[1:02:33] worldliness
[1:02:34] from darkness from being an enemy of god
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] and the power of god amen through the
[1:02:40] power of that spoken word
[1:02:42] changing us from glory to glory
[1:02:46] even as by the spirit of the lord
[1:02:49] revealing themselves to us amen
[1:02:51] and coming with the revelation of the
[1:02:53] word in our souls
[1:02:56] how through love
[1:03:00] when we were his enemies think about it
[1:03:04] i'm talking about tonight
[1:03:11] you think let let us let us think right
[1:03:13] now how we've treated our lord
[1:03:18] in the simple things amen
[1:03:24] how faithful have we been to him
[1:03:27] but yet we want him every time to be
[1:03:29] right there for us
[1:03:31] amen lord help us to pay our bills
[1:03:34] lord give me that good job lord give me
[1:03:36] that god we want him to
[1:03:38] satisfy every desire that we have
[1:03:41] but when it comes to satisfying his
[1:03:43] desires
[1:03:46] he told israel once i've brought you out
[1:03:48] and and once i've placed you in a good
[1:03:50] land and once i've made you
[1:03:52] rich and you become fat
[1:03:55] he said don't you forget about the lord
[1:03:57] your god
[1:03:59] he knew the course of human nature
[1:04:09] praise the lord
[1:04:15] he spoke within himself saying this man
[1:04:17] if he were a prophet
[1:04:19] would have known who and what manner of
[1:04:21] woman this
[1:04:22] is that toucheth him for she
[1:04:27] is a sinner
[1:04:30] and jesus sitting right there and it's
[1:04:34] almost like he had a microphone just
[1:04:35] like i got right now
[1:04:38] he heard his inward thoughts loud and
[1:04:40] clear
[1:04:42] amen as soon as soon as he said his last
[1:04:44] word to his statement in his heart
[1:04:47] jesus looked at him
[1:04:52] my lord my god my example
[1:04:58] see that was his daughter
[1:05:01] but she was all covered over but that
[1:05:04] seed was in there
[1:05:06] amen only a spiritual eye i'll be able
[1:05:09] to see that seed
[1:05:13] amen how else are we going to be a
[1:05:16] benefit and a help to anybody
[1:05:18] unless we're in the spirit because
[1:05:22] in my natural sight saints because
[1:05:23] listen now we're human
[1:05:26] we came into this world in a fallen
[1:05:28] condition and even when you receive the
[1:05:30] holy ghost you still have a fallen body
[1:05:32] and a human spirit got to be dealt with
[1:05:35] and as a result of that demon spirits
[1:05:37] can latch themselves
[1:05:38] to your spirit and control your mind
[1:05:44] brother calls it a spiritual oppression
[1:05:53] make you look at somebody or one another
[1:05:55] in the wrong light
[1:05:58] amen just like simon is
[1:06:02] looking at him with a critical eye amen
[1:06:07] and the lord was displeased with that
[1:06:12] let me read something to you here
[1:06:16] he says and jesus answering said unto
[1:06:18] him simon i have somewhat to say unto
[1:06:20] thee
[1:06:21] and he said listen what he said master
[1:06:23] say on
[1:06:24] he know full well he didn't consider
[1:06:26] christ to be his master
[1:06:31] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:06:33] two debtors the one owed 500 pence and
[1:06:36] the other 50 and when he had nothing to
[1:06:38] pay
[1:06:38] he frankly forgave them both tell me
[1:06:40] therefore which of them loving him
[1:06:42] would love him most simon answered and
[1:06:44] said i suppose that he
[1:06:46] to whom he forgave most and he said unto
[1:06:48] him thou has rightly judged
[1:06:50] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:06:52] simon she asked out this woman
[1:06:53] i entered and i entered into thine house
[1:06:55] thou gave us me no water for my feet
[1:06:57] but she have not washed she has not she
[1:07:00] have
[1:07:00] had washed my feet with tears and wiped
[1:07:02] them with the hairs of her head
[1:07:04] thou gaves me no kiss but but this woman
[1:07:07] since the time i came in have not ceased
[1:07:09] to kiss my feet
[1:07:10] my head with oil about did is not
[1:07:12] annoying but this woman hath anointed my
[1:07:14] feet with ointment
[1:07:15] wherefore i see unto thee her sins which
[1:07:17] are many are forgiven
[1:07:19] for she loved much but to whom little is
[1:07:21] forgiving the same love of little
[1:07:23] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:07:25] forgiven
[1:07:27] and they that said and meet with him
[1:07:28] began to say within themselves
[1:07:30] who is this that forgive us our sins
[1:07:32] also and he said unto the woman thy
[1:07:34] faith have saved thee
[1:07:35] go in peace simon
[1:07:39] you've been here with this woman you
[1:07:42] know
[1:07:42] all about her what have you done to help
[1:07:46] her
[1:07:51] you're so easy to criticize
[1:07:56] but where's your heart at my brother
[1:08:01] starchy self-righteous
[1:08:08] blind
[1:08:10] the bible says when somebody thinks they
[1:08:12] are something when they are nothing
[1:08:15] they deceive themselves
[1:08:18] was he deceived yes indeed
[1:08:25] see so god says he wants us to be able
[1:08:27] to have compassion
[1:08:33] be in a place in our house we actually
[1:08:35] care about what somebody is going
[1:08:37] through
[1:08:39] but she didn't know we we we touching on
[1:08:43] holy ground here see because
[1:08:45] did this i'm not talking about something
[1:08:47] that's humanly produced
[1:08:50] we can't enter into this place on our
[1:08:52] own
[1:08:53] it's a place that we're brought into
[1:08:55] amen the prophet talked about it
[1:08:57] it's a place that you're actually
[1:08:59] brought into by the power of god
[1:09:02] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:05] it's a level of relationship and love
[1:09:08] everybody speaks so highly of brother
[1:09:11] brown
[1:09:14] but his life was just a reflection of
[1:09:17] his
[1:09:17] love relationship with our lord jesus
[1:09:20] christ
[1:09:22] it wasn't because he was some special
[1:09:24] somebody no sir but he
[1:09:27] he came to a place where he really loved
[1:09:30] god
[1:09:31] more than what we realize
[1:09:35] and as a result of that the presence of
[1:09:38] god
[1:09:40] do you understand those things when we
[1:09:42] humble ourselves before god
[1:09:44] and we allow him to have his way and we
[1:09:46] really be
[1:09:47] sheep that dove is able to come and
[1:09:51] connect with that lamb nature
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:59] whenever that simon woof-like spirit
[1:10:02] comes upon us
[1:10:04] just like the prophet said the sweet
[1:10:06] holy spirit takes his flight
[1:10:09] i said but don't worry though he he he's
[1:10:11] within calling
[1:10:12] he he's he's within distance there
[1:10:15] he's just waiting for us to come back to
[1:10:17] our right frame of mind
[1:10:19] and realize lord i was wrong forgive me
[1:10:22] heavenly father
[1:10:23] for how i've acted for how i've thought
[1:10:27] about it and that sweet anointing i'll
[1:10:29] come float right back down on
[1:10:31] you see the grace of god but we deserve
[1:10:34] to be left alone
[1:10:37] how many times sayings have you and i
[1:10:38] acted up before the lord
[1:10:41] in a day in a week in a month
[1:10:45] in a year in five years we can't count
[1:10:48] it
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:52] but look at how he handles us
[1:10:56] he could tell he he could take any one
[1:10:58] of us right now and
[1:11:00] plaster our secret sins over this wall
[1:11:04] cause the anointing of god to drop and a
[1:11:06] gift operate
[1:11:08] and blast out before everybody
[1:11:11] our own sins are
[1:11:15] but does he do it
[1:11:18] and all that we've been through does he
[1:11:20] do it look at how he handles us
[1:11:29] lord have mercy on us compassion saints
[1:11:32] according to the dictionary
[1:11:34] watch this now this is what simon lacked
[1:11:39] it means sympathetic awareness
[1:11:42] of others distress
[1:11:45] notice it says together with
[1:11:49] a desire to alleviate it
[1:11:54] he says ye which are spiritual go and
[1:11:57] restore
[1:11:59] you're not just going to see what's
[1:12:01] going on so you can take something back
[1:12:03] to gossip about amen
[1:12:05] you ain't just going to be nosy amen but
[1:12:07] you're going with the deepness of
[1:12:09] sincerity amen why
[1:12:11] because you're being mindful of yourself
[1:12:13] he said
[1:12:14] considering yourself lest you be tempted
[1:12:17] also
[1:12:18] you know what the bible says so when you
[1:12:21] talk about compassion
[1:12:22] is you see somebody in distress but you
[1:12:25] have a desire
[1:12:27] to see them restored to see them
[1:12:29] delivered
[1:12:31] so when you go you go softly the bible
[1:12:34] said in the spirit of meekness
[1:12:37] considering yourself
[1:12:43] that's the making of an effective prayer
[1:12:54] when people use you
[1:12:58] when people handle you wrong how many
[1:13:02] realize god don't let you act back the
[1:13:04] way that they acted towards you
[1:13:07] you want to know why because you're
[1:13:09] royalty
[1:13:11] you have a higher calling amen amen
[1:13:14] you not from this world like that amen
[1:13:17] you can't act like everybody else sack
[1:13:20] that low mentality and i for not know
[1:13:23] sir
[1:13:24] not in god's kingdom he said love your
[1:13:27] enemies
[1:13:29] god allow enemies to come in your life
[1:13:31] amen it's like we preached before
[1:13:33] brother to challenge you to love him
[1:13:37] i'm talking about effective prayer now
[1:13:39] listen he says
[1:13:40] pray for those that despitefully use you
[1:13:44] and persecute you
[1:13:46] think about that
[1:13:50] your name cast all about
[1:13:54] you being talked about you being
[1:13:56] ridiculed
[1:13:58] listen and all lord let it roll right
[1:14:01] into your life
[1:14:04] what is it for it's the finishing
[1:14:06] touches of perfection
[1:14:09] amen we're talking about real training
[1:14:11] here now
[1:14:13] man before i went to marine corps boot
[1:14:16] camp i heard about it but once i was in
[1:14:17] it i was in it
[1:14:19] amen it was a tough training
[1:14:23] the training of god ain't easy and he
[1:14:25] permits all these things to take place
[1:14:28] he let it roll right into your life to
[1:14:31] bring out your reaction and your
[1:14:32] response hey man why
[1:14:34] because he's molding and he's shaping
[1:14:36] he's the potter and we're the clay
[1:14:40] there's something he got in his mind
[1:14:42] that he's trying to bring out
[1:14:44] in that vessel each one of our vessels
[1:14:48] so you let people talk about you and
[1:14:50] persecute you
[1:14:51] and then when it and then when you're
[1:14:53] able and when you feel like to talk back
[1:14:55] he said uh
[1:15:01] don't you say a word
[1:15:07] there's a sheet before shears as dumb he
[1:15:09] opened not his mouth
[1:15:14] god has been having me to hold my breath
[1:15:18] you feel like you about to explode on me
[1:15:21] you want to clear your name you want to
[1:15:23] be able to justify yourself
[1:15:26] he says no
[1:15:32] he says now pray for them
[1:15:36] not some little flimsy week
[1:15:40] lord i pray for my enemies lord you know
[1:15:42] lord bless them
[1:15:43] no sir there's a place
[1:15:47] there's a place saints that we got to
[1:15:49] enter into
[1:15:51] watch this now watch it i'm gonna touch
[1:15:54] on a few things here saints and i'm
[1:15:56] gonna let you go cause i know it's a
[1:15:57] wednesday night
[1:15:59] and i just wanna share this with you
[1:16:01] here
[1:16:04] notice this now brother branham
[1:16:07] his daughter sharon when she was dying
[1:16:13] and the lord brought this to my
[1:16:14] attention because i realized saints the
[1:16:16] lord allows us to go through things at
[1:16:18] times
[1:16:20] for other people
[1:16:25] he takes you through it because
[1:16:28] somewhere down the line there's gonna be
[1:16:30] somebody that he's gonna cause across
[1:16:32] your path
[1:16:33] that's going to have a need of what you
[1:16:35] gained in the midst
[1:16:37] of that trial or that trouble or that
[1:16:40] situation
[1:16:42] he's equipping you with something to
[1:16:43] give to somebody else
[1:16:47] when brother branham sharon his daughter
[1:16:49] sharon rose was dying
[1:16:50] he talked about how she was suffering
[1:16:53] flies flying in her eyes she trying to
[1:16:57] wave at him and she's sitting there
[1:16:59] dying
[1:17:00] he said she was in so much pain to her
[1:17:02] little eyes
[1:17:03] crossed
[1:17:09] no parent ever want to go through that
[1:17:16] but as a result of that
[1:17:20] there wasn't a person that hardly was
[1:17:22] able to come across that stage that had
[1:17:24] crossed
[1:17:24] eyes that didn't leave healed
[1:17:35] why because it wasn't just somebody that
[1:17:37] needed prayer
[1:17:38] he was able to enter into their
[1:17:40] suffering
[1:17:43] because it triggered his memory of his
[1:17:45] daughter amen
[1:17:47] and as he saw that child of that grown
[1:17:49] up standing there with that crossed eyes
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:52] there was something that was able to
[1:17:53] come forth from that brother under the
[1:17:55] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:17:58] and prayed upon faith watch this now
[1:18:04] he says in his message called god
[1:18:06] projecting his love
[1:18:08] he says and i thought after all that
[1:18:10] talking about the old mexican brother
[1:18:12] after all that and then nature the devil
[1:18:15] has given him
[1:18:15] evil to blind his poor old blinded eyes
[1:18:19] how cruel it was to him and i began to
[1:18:21] enter into something
[1:18:26] notice how he said that i began he
[1:18:28] wasn't able to bring himself into it
[1:18:33] it's just where he was he was yielded to
[1:18:35] god he loved god
[1:18:37] and he was just there to do the service
[1:18:39] of god in the will of god
[1:18:40] god was just able to have his way so now
[1:18:42] he was able to
[1:18:44] he began to feel the very feeling of god
[1:18:49] do you understand that when we're
[1:18:52] yielded to god like we're supposed to be
[1:18:53] united saints by his grace
[1:18:55] it brings us into the very feeling of
[1:18:58] god
[1:19:02] that's why stephen when he was being
[1:19:04] stoned
[1:19:05] he was being killed and the same one
[1:19:09] that was on the cross
[1:19:11] that said forgive them was that same one
[1:19:13] speaking through philip on
[1:19:15] stephen's lips he was able to enter into
[1:19:18] that same place
[1:19:19] by the same person that wasn't a
[1:19:21] religious act
[1:19:24] that was a life by nature
[1:19:27] you understand so brother branham is
[1:19:30] saying here i begin he says
[1:19:32] to enter into something he says i can't
[1:19:34] express it
[1:19:36] it was a love of sympathy
[1:19:41] he says and as the old fellow come and
[1:19:43] laid his head over on my shoulder
[1:19:44] and i hugged that old ragged coat i said
[1:19:47] merciful god
[1:19:48] please help this poor old blind daddy if
[1:19:51] my dad would have lived he'd have been
[1:19:53] about that age see how god was helping
[1:19:55] his mind
[1:19:59] his consideration his sincerity for this
[1:20:01] man he was going into a certain place
[1:20:04] that the holy ghost was directing it
[1:20:07] why because god was going to use him to
[1:20:09] pray
[1:20:12] an effect of prayer for this brother
[1:20:17] amen he says and i heard him hold listen
[1:20:21] now
[1:20:22] he's sitting there with these thoughts
[1:20:25] my daddy would have been about that age
[1:20:28] considering his condition
[1:20:30] and because he was yielded and he loved
[1:20:33] god
[1:20:34] god came right down and rested and
[1:20:36] settled upon that that little vessel
[1:20:39] and he began to think the thoughts of
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:43] and as he's sitting there and he's
[1:20:45] whispering this simple prayer
[1:20:49] amen the miraculous beginning to happen
[1:20:51] he says and i heard him hollering gloria
[1:20:53] adios
[1:20:55] and the man could see as good as i could
[1:20:58] the people began screaming everywhere he
[1:21:00] says what was it
[1:21:01] it was entering into that fellowship of
[1:21:03] his suffering
[1:21:04] in his blindness so when somebody bring
[1:21:07] prayer to you
[1:21:10] to me
[1:21:14] be able to go home even if you got to
[1:21:16] write it down
[1:21:19] and not just get down and just begin to
[1:21:21] say a prayer but sometimes just sit just
[1:21:23] sit and be quiet for a little while
[1:21:28] coming in from outside coming in from
[1:21:30] work just go in a room and close it up
[1:21:32] just sit quiet for a little
[1:21:33] maybe read the bible or something
[1:21:38] hey man why you're wanting to create an
[1:21:40] atmosphere
[1:21:42] you want your spirit to get uncluttered
[1:21:45] why because you really want to be able
[1:21:46] to pray for your brother your sister
[1:21:51] not forget about him not a little weak
[1:21:54] prayer
[1:21:58] the holy ghost is watching because the
[1:22:01] bible says it's his desire that we will
[1:22:03] pray always
[1:22:05] especially for one another
[1:22:10] amen watch this now
[1:22:13] he said if ever i had a time of success
[1:22:18] of praying for anyone is when
[1:22:21] i could enter into the fellowship with
[1:22:24] them
[1:22:25] feel their infirmities feel their
[1:22:27] conditions
[1:22:29] that's where the high priest success
[1:22:31] comes from
[1:22:32] that's where the saints that finds one
[1:22:34] overcoming a fault
[1:22:35] that's where their success of prayer
[1:22:38] comes from
[1:22:42] the holy ghost will put you in it listen
[1:22:45] when all the men came and women
[1:22:49] bringing that woman that was caught in
[1:22:50] an act of adultery
[1:22:52] she was caught right
[1:22:56] but listen even though she was the one
[1:22:58] called
[1:22:59] look who god directed his tear his
[1:23:01] attention toward
[1:23:03] the ones that brought her
[1:23:06] the critical ones the persecuting ones
[1:23:10] yes she did wrong but i want to tell you
[1:23:12] about yourself
[1:23:14] he said simon i have somewhat against
[1:23:16] you
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:19] they thinking they doing god of service
[1:23:22] listen
[1:23:23] how easily that happens in the wrong
[1:23:26] spirit
[1:23:27] you thinking that you on god's side
[1:23:29] working for god
[1:23:30] and god ain't behind you not one tap
[1:23:35] you don't realize what spirit you're off
[1:23:41] my prophet went to that cafe
[1:23:44] he was anointed by devil he was looking
[1:23:47] through the sight of an evil spirit
[1:23:50] with the holy ghost powerful services
[1:23:54] and in that moment a demon took control
[1:23:56] of our prophet
[1:23:58] and made him made him want to see the
[1:24:00] people that were in there destroyed
[1:24:09] isn't that something with the holy ghost
[1:24:14] can get so caught up in religious
[1:24:16] thoughts
[1:24:18] god he said why don't you just wipe the
[1:24:20] whole thing off
[1:24:21] so that my kids ain't got to grow up
[1:24:23] with people like that
[1:24:28] you can't tell me that don't happen
[1:24:29] among the saints
[1:24:33] but guess what our father ain't having
[1:24:34] it
[1:24:37] he checks his family he checks his
[1:24:39] children
[1:24:40] why that ain't called raising you up i
[1:24:43] ain't how i want you to live
[1:24:51] can we say praise the lord saints amen
[1:24:55] if ever i had a time of success or
[1:24:57] praying for anyone
[1:24:58] is when i could enter into the
[1:24:59] fellowship with them
[1:25:01] with them feeling their infirmities
[1:25:04] feel their condition
[1:25:09] amen then something in you goes down
[1:25:13] beyond
[1:25:13] reasonings and prayers the prayer of
[1:25:15] faith for the sick
[1:25:17] you've got to feel for a man you've got
[1:25:20] to sympathize with him
[1:25:22] you've got to be with him before you can
[1:25:24] help him
[1:25:26] then you enter into some sort of a
[1:25:28] deepness it's the love of god
[1:25:31] it's beyond human love
[1:25:38] this is something saints to him this is
[1:25:40] something that the lord is emphasizing
[1:25:41] to my heart
[1:25:44] i'm preaching to you my conviction
[1:25:48] the lord is helping me in my words to
[1:25:51] communicate
[1:25:53] what he's been teaching me
[1:25:57] i want you to understand that
[1:26:01] and the only reason why i'm sharing it
[1:26:02] with you tonight is because i i want to
[1:26:05] if it can be of a help to somebody
[1:26:09] that's my desire because i see this is
[1:26:12] something
[1:26:13] that every member of the bride of christ
[1:26:15] must have
[1:26:18] you must have it we have the ministry of
[1:26:21] reconciliation
[1:26:23] isn't that right but how are you going
[1:26:25] to be effective
[1:26:26] in that ministry in that in that role
[1:26:29] amen
[1:26:31] we got to amen we got to come in the
[1:26:32] right way
[1:26:34] not just one time but spend spin spin
[1:26:39] spend the quality with the quality time
[1:26:41] with god that we need to
[1:26:43] so that we can just enter into this
[1:26:45] place
[1:26:49] that's it it's as simple as that the
[1:26:52] little things that we take for granted
[1:26:53] many times
[1:26:55] are so powerful but the devil want us to
[1:26:58] overlook it
[1:26:59] simply taking the time to pray spending
[1:27:02] time
[1:27:02] spending real time in the world i've
[1:27:05] been so busy lately ain't made no sense
[1:27:08] but what i began to realize you know
[1:27:09] what let me i got to stop and reevaluate
[1:27:12] some things because
[1:27:14] maybe i don't need to be as busy as i
[1:27:16] think i need to be
[1:27:18] maybe maybe some of this is actually the
[1:27:20] enemy trying to keep me from something
[1:27:30] i want to be able to pray an effective
[1:27:33] prayer
[1:27:36] for my brothers and my sisters no matter
[1:27:39] who it is
[1:27:40] somebody in the world lord have mercy on
[1:27:42] me

[1:27:55] my family
[1:27:56] and by the grace of god i know we're
[1:27:58] human we can't always remember
[1:28:00] everything like that but if we're in
[1:28:01] that place with god
[1:28:03] help me to know that god will bring
[1:28:04] somebody to your heart
[1:28:07] we're human we forget but but if it's
[1:28:10] somebody that god really wants you to
[1:28:11] pray for be mindful i mean

[1:40:31] tonight
[1:40:34] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:39] but david give me a little bit i just
[1:40:41] want to save my voice
[1:40:42] amen you know brother branham preached a
[1:40:46] message
[1:40:47] before he preached the seals everybody
[1:40:50] was under anticipation for the seals
[1:40:53] and do you know the message he preached
[1:40:55] before
[1:40:56] god hide
[1:41:00] and reveal himself in simplicity
[1:41:04] this message is not complicated
[1:41:08] it is very simple and those very
[1:41:11] simple things have a
[1:41:14] powerful force that can
[1:41:18] even move a mountain amen
[1:41:21] the disciple thought that if jesus
[1:41:23] increased their faith
[1:41:25] then they're going to move the mountain
[1:41:26] jesus said if faith is just like a
[1:41:29] little master seed
[1:41:30] just the way it is it can move that big
[1:41:33] mountain
[1:41:34] amen it is very important when
[1:41:38] things happen in our life
[1:41:42] instead of getting angry
[1:41:45] instead of getting upset try to discern
[1:41:49] the message behind what you see
[1:41:53] usually most of the time god is
[1:41:56] talking in a different language
[1:41:59] than you are used to amen
[1:42:03] amen kids you might have a noisy
[1:42:07] neighbor
[1:42:08] always troubling you do something
[1:42:12] and they say your kids are making noise
[1:42:15] your kids are making noise your kids are
[1:42:17] making noise
[1:42:18] you can get upset to the neighbor and
[1:42:21] miss the message of god
[1:42:24] amen maybe it's just time for you to
[1:42:27] move
[1:42:30] amen maybe it's just a time
[1:42:33] for you to move so god will make that
[1:42:36] place
[1:42:36] uncomfortable amen until you
[1:42:40] understand that you know what i need to
[1:42:43] go ahead and pray
[1:42:45] so that the lord can give me a house you
[1:42:47] pray and it doesn't take long and you
[1:42:49] get a house
[1:42:50] it took the pressure amen to put you
[1:42:53] into a certain place if you discern it
[1:42:56] right
[1:42:57] you can pray for that neighbor show him
[1:43:00] love
[1:43:00] and also reap your blessing and keep
[1:43:03] moving forward
[1:43:05] amen but most of the time when something
[1:43:07] happens we get upset
[1:43:09] and we don't understand that we miss god
[1:43:12] when you grow
[1:43:14] pressure comes amen things begin to
[1:43:17] happen
[1:43:18] tension get into the church that tension
[1:43:21] is not don't give too much credit to the
[1:43:24] devil
[1:43:26] god is saying something amen
[1:43:30] god is just telling you something maybe
[1:43:32] it's time for you to move to a next step
[1:43:35] so they gotta shake things away from you
[1:43:38] and if you don't discern that right
[1:43:40] you're going to be caught up and the
[1:43:42] blessing of the lord just passed you by
[1:43:45] and you got to go back to the school
[1:43:46] again and be retrained
[1:43:49] because you didn't pass the test amen
[1:43:52] so just remember self-righteousness is
[1:43:54] something that is
[1:43:55] very very bad amen
[1:43:59] you cannot have that one and handle
[1:44:02] the sheep of god that's the reason why i
[1:44:05] say
[1:44:06] i made a statement i say if you see
[1:44:08] somebody in this church that got trouble
[1:44:11] if you don't know how to handle it just
[1:44:14] leave them alone
[1:44:15] come and talk to me amen because you
[1:44:18] handle them right you can get a warping
[1:44:21] from god even though they're wrong amen
[1:44:25] go read the scripture you will see many
[1:44:27] times god bring
[1:44:28] babylon to take israel out of the land
[1:44:32] and the same god turn again and whoop
[1:44:34] babylon
[1:44:35] amen i can give you scripture
[1:44:39] after scripture but self-righteousness
[1:44:42] very very very bad thing
[1:44:46] learn to see yourself a little
[1:44:49] amen acknowledge your weakness it's
[1:44:53] gonna help you in marriage
[1:44:55] amen if you don't remember things right
[1:44:58] just acknowledge i have a tendency to
[1:45:02] forget things let discern
[1:45:05] the gift in your wife that god placed
[1:45:08] there
[1:45:08] to help you compensate on that weakness
[1:45:12] you do it you begin to prosper but we've
[1:45:15] been blocking
[1:45:16] our husband belittling our lives
[1:45:20] crushing our kids and don't even discern
[1:45:24] what is going on
[1:45:25] and you're gonna go in a circle in a
[1:45:27] circle
[1:45:28] in a circle because you know everything
[1:45:31] because you know
[1:45:32] all because you don't understand that
[1:45:34] god put
[1:45:35] a team there god put a song leader god
[1:45:38] put a trusty
[1:45:39] god put a deacon god put somebody there
[1:45:42] to sing
[1:45:43] all these people are there many times
[1:45:45] people come and ask me brother stephen
[1:45:47] what should i do i say you do as you
