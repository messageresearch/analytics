[30:51] and trying to bring some other different
[30:54] ideas you know what that's floating in

[54:10] Wednesday we will pick up that will be
[54:11] done so we can continue to move until we
[54:14] get the prayer uh part covered amen
[54:17] sister Arcos is doing well by God's
[54:20] grace just getting used to uh the new
[54:24] organ transplant and I felt like I did
[54:27] my heart I don't know where this is
[54:29] coming from or the Lord or it's National
[54:31] or it's local or it's International I
[54:35] don't know but I have to mention
[54:38] something about transplant because we
[54:41] gave a testimony about transplant but
[54:44] maybe somebody's wondering what does the
[54:47] prophet say about organ transplant what
[54:50] does the scripture says about it
[54:52] to me first it's a testimony if you were
[54:55] suffering for 13 years
[54:57] and they give you one you will be
[55:00] praising the Lord
[55:01] amen
[55:03] but whoever was struggling with that
[55:05] question I'm gonna help you up stabilize
[55:08] you in the scripture and in the message
[55:10] of the hour
[55:11] amen
[55:13] we good
[55:14] this is what the Bible says amen glory
[55:18] to God
[55:20] this is what the Bible says in the book
[55:23] of Galatians chapter 4 verse 13 Paul say
[55:27] you know how true infirmity because Paul
[55:31] has an infirmity
[55:33] of the flesh I preached the gospel unto
[55:36] you at first
[55:38] and my Temptation which was in my flesh
[55:42] ye despise not in other words they
[55:44] didn't look down on Paul because he had
[55:46] suffering amen nor rejected but receive
[55:50] me as an angel of what God
[55:54] Paul was received as an angel of God
[55:58] so if you have a problem receiving
[56:00] brother Branham as an angel of God
[56:02] that's your problem me I believe him as
[56:05] the angel of God
[56:06] he say and we receive me as an angel of
[56:09] God even as who Christ Jesus
[56:15] am I reading a different Bible
[56:17] if you have a problem you open your
[56:19] scripture and you verify they receive
[56:21] Paul as Jesus Christ
[56:25] I'm reading the Bible please open your
[56:28] scripture
[56:31] open your scripture because when I read
[56:34] the Bible here it's appearing like I
[56:35] have a different Bible
[56:37] I'm still using the same old Bible
[56:41] amen open your scripture and you need
[56:44] your Bible because I'm going to navigate
[56:46] to the Bible
[56:48] everybody okay
[56:50] let's go to Galatians chapter 4 verse
[56:53] 15. uh verse 14. if you dare you can say
[56:56] Amen
[56:59] I went to sleep probably later than all
[57:02] of you
[57:04] I was sleeping at 3 30.
[57:06] and I'm here this morning so you should
[57:08] be alive
[57:11] amen you should be more stronger than me
[57:15] amen
[57:18] amen
[57:21] my temptation is that correct
[57:24] which was in my flesh you despise not
[57:28] nor water rejected but receive me as an
[57:32] angel of who God even as who Christ
[57:38] they received Paul as Christ Jesus
[57:41] amen
[57:44] because Paul was representing Jesus
[57:47] Christ
[57:48] and William Branham represented Jesus
[57:51] Christ
[57:54] the message is Christ
[57:57] and the message and the messenger I won
[58:05] that's it my friend where is then the
[58:08] blessedness you speak of
[58:11] for I bear you record that if he had
[58:15] been possible you would have done water
[58:19] plant out your own eyes and have given
[58:23] them to her
[58:25] everybody okay
[58:27] so Paul said if he was possible in his
[58:31] time the believer could have plucked out
[58:34] their eyes and give it to Paul so that
[58:38] Paul can use that eye because Paul had a
[58:41] problem with his eyes since the pillar
[58:43] of fire struck him
[58:45] so Paul already mentioned a bad organ
[58:48] transplant
[58:52] can you say amen amen
[58:59] okay William Marion Branham so I can go
[59:02] to my sermon this becoming a very water
[59:05] wonderful wonderful can you give him
[59:07] more volume please
[59:10] since somebody's not dead
[59:13] level of saying amen he got it okay this
[59:17] become a very wonderful water thing to
[59:21] work on human water body we appreciate
[59:24] that
[59:25] what do you appreciate they can transfer
[59:28] water and I from one man to water
[59:31] another take those tiny little cord and
[59:35] take an eye out of a man's socket and
[59:37] place it over into another man's socket
[59:40] and that man can see from water that is
[59:44] how wonderful whole thing
[59:47] so there is nothing wrong with organ
[59:50] transplanting
[59:54] Paul spoke about the transfer of an eye
[59:57] and William Mayon Branham spoke about
[1:00:00] the transfer of an eye because brother
[1:00:03] Branham say I preach like Paul
[1:00:05] [Applause]
[1:00:08] the message and the scripture are
[1:00:11] perfectly in order brother Branham give
[1:00:14] you this and never give you a scripture
[1:00:16] but the spirit that worked with brother
[1:00:18] Branham
[1:00:20] I'm talking about myself he's also
[1:00:23] working with me
[1:00:25] I am not going to be a new messenger I
[1:00:29] am under brother Branham but the
[1:00:32] anointing is flowing through me that's
[1:00:34] why it's giving me scripture to back up
[1:00:36] the message of the hour because the
[1:00:39] message in the Bible are one
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:00:44] everybody clear
[1:00:48] everybody created so whoever had a
[1:00:51] problem with organ transplant I believe
[1:00:52] you got your answer God richly bless you
[1:00:55] if you were calling to if you were
[1:00:59] wondering to learn the Lord has answered
[1:01:02] your prayer but if you had the night to
[1:01:05] criticize your mouth is going to be shut
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:09] let's go to our scripture this morning
[1:01:18] when I say your mouth is going to be
[1:01:19] shut you don't understand what I'm
[1:01:21] saying read brother Branham and you
[1:01:23] would know what I'm talking about let's
[1:01:25] go to Ezekiel 36.
[1:01:29] glory to God
[1:01:33] Hallelujah
[1:01:37] Ezekiel 36 verse 24.
[1:01:42] you need to keep your Bible
[1:01:46] because we will travel to certain things
[1:01:48] there were things
[1:01:49] that are taught a long time and if you
[1:01:53] don't go slowly
[1:01:55] it's hard to correct them like we
[1:01:57] mentioned like we dealt with prosperity
[1:02:00] now you understand that Prosperity is
[1:02:02] not just about money
[1:02:05] Prosperity affect every aspect of our
[1:02:07] life
[1:02:09] amen but when they say Prosperity
[1:02:12] Everybody Run Away
[1:02:15] and then yet
[1:02:17] your whole life what you're doing is
[1:02:19] after money
[1:02:25] a lot of pretense in the message
[1:02:28] Ezekiel 36 verse 24 if you dare you can
[1:02:31] say amen amen
[1:02:33] the Bible says this
[1:02:35] for I would take you from The Hidden
[1:02:40] and gather you out of the countries and
[1:02:43] will bring you into your own land you
[1:02:47] might be seated so somebody who's out of
[1:02:50] order
[1:02:52] everybody okay somebody was not in the
[1:02:55] promised land somebody was out
[1:02:58] and God says you are outside you're not
[1:03:01] in your right position you are not in
[1:03:04] order
[1:03:05] so I will come and take you from out of
[1:03:08] order
[1:03:08] and bring you back into the Promised
[1:03:11] Land
[1:03:12] so somebody was outside the Promised
[1:03:15] Land
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:20] outside the promised land amen and God
[1:03:24] promised to bring them in the promising
[1:03:29] and we know what the promised land means
[1:03:32] spiritually right we went through
[1:03:34] disorders Canon means
[1:03:36] it means the Holy Ghost amen
[1:03:39] so somebody didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] and God want to bring them back into the
[1:03:45] promised land that's right amen and
[1:03:48] watch the bringing back into the
[1:03:50] promised land when you look at this
[1:03:52] scripture you will find out you will
[1:03:54] think that God is bringing them to a
[1:03:56] natural land
[1:03:59] because the Bible says you were not in a
[1:04:01] promised land and you are coming into
[1:04:03] the promised land because scripture got
[1:04:06] compound meaning the first way you look
[1:04:07] at it is somebody moving from a country
[1:04:10] to another country but watch how the
[1:04:12] scripture is bringing them to the
[1:04:14] promised land
[1:04:15] verse 25
[1:04:17] then we last sprinkle clean water
[1:04:21] upon you
[1:04:22] and you shall be clean from your water
[1:04:25] filthiness does it mean that Israel was
[1:04:28] not taking a bath
[1:04:30] you see that it's a different promise
[1:04:32] line
[1:04:33] because you will think God is standing
[1:04:35] there with a big pipe and when the Jews
[1:04:37] are coming he's praying watching them
[1:04:39] like in a car wash
[1:04:43] everybody okay that's not the case God
[1:04:47] is spoken about God is talking here
[1:04:49] about a change spiritually he say I will
[1:04:53] sprinkle clean water
[1:04:56] upon you and you shall be clean
[1:05:00] you shall be clean from all your
[1:05:03] filthiness so this art of other place
[1:05:07] they were in filthiness
[1:05:11] amen so somebody was filthy
[1:05:15] and God before they bring them down
[1:05:18] there want to spray clean water and we
[1:05:21] know according to Ephesians
[1:05:23] the washing of the World by the word so
[1:05:27] there will come a word that will come to
[1:05:30] you and that word will clean you up
[1:05:33] Amen in preparation toward the Promised
[1:05:37] Land so in preparation toward the
[1:05:39] promised land there is a water
[1:05:42] not just the water but it's a clean
[1:05:44] water that God will sprinkle upon you
[1:05:47] and we know that water according to
[1:05:49] Ephesians is the word that we there will
[1:05:52] come a word to clean you from your
[1:05:54] filthiness amen as you're going into the
[1:05:58] Promised Land
[1:05:59] and the Bible continues Ezekiel says and
[1:06:03] from all your adults we like cleanse you
[1:06:07] it's the filthiness and others let me
[1:06:10] put that together
[1:06:11] so we don't leave anything there amen
[1:06:15] verse 26
[1:06:16] a new heart
[1:06:21] I thought we are going to the promised
[1:06:23] land
[1:06:26] you want to clean us with water
[1:06:30] now it's a heart transplant
[1:06:33] everybody okay a new heart
[1:06:37] amen
[1:06:38] will I give you so God
[1:06:42] when he's bringing Israel out from their
[1:06:46] filthiness into the promised land amen
[1:06:50] he says that he's going to wash them
[1:06:53] he will cleanse them he doesn't mean
[1:06:56] they were not taking a bath we already
[1:06:58] understood that but God is targeting one
[1:07:01] place
[1:07:03] are you following me the place that God
[1:07:06] is targeting
[1:07:08] is the heart
[1:07:13] to be restored these people were in the
[1:07:17] promised lands and they left the
[1:07:20] promised land
[1:07:21] restoration means to bring back
[1:07:26] everybody okay and to restore God his
[1:07:30] restoration
[1:07:31] Target the heart
[1:07:35] I will send you a word
[1:07:38] I will send you a larger the prophet
[1:07:44] who will turn the water
[1:07:47] you understand now so the restoration
[1:07:50] always Target the heart
[1:07:53] because if the heart is not restored
[1:07:56] amen it is just a physical act
[1:08:03] Israel left Egypt physically
[1:08:08] amen and they were going into the
[1:08:11] Wilderness whenever anything happened
[1:08:16] we remember what we were eating in Egypt
[1:08:19] we need to go back to Egypt
[1:08:21] amen their body was taken off of Egypt
[1:08:25] but their heart was still in Egypt
[1:08:29] everybody okay God saw that already he
[1:08:33] said I'm bringing these people back
[1:08:35] again to the promised land but if I
[1:08:37] don't Target the heart
[1:08:39] amen they will come with all this
[1:08:42] filthiness
[1:08:43] and adult
[1:08:44] into the message
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:52] so the target to come to the promised
[1:08:56] land is the heart
[1:08:59] follow me carefully amen
[1:09:03] I will give you a new heart verse 26
[1:09:06] will I give you and a new spirit
[1:09:10] we love put within you we went through
[1:09:12] this
[1:09:14] in this series
[1:09:15] and I would take away the Stony heart
[1:09:19] so the heart that have filthiness
[1:09:23] and other is a Stony heart
[1:09:28] in other words you can hit as much as
[1:09:31] you can hit nothing happened
[1:09:36] it's a Stony heart right here
[1:09:39] so God realized I'm bringing people with
[1:09:42] Stony heart
[1:09:44] if I put them in the promised land there
[1:09:48] will be Jews with Stony heart in the
[1:09:50] message
[1:09:51] that's it you can preach all you want
[1:09:54] they have their own agenda
[1:09:56] they're not going to change
[1:09:58] so I need to Target the problem and the
[1:10:02] problem is the heart
[1:10:06] everybody okay
[1:10:08] and I would take away the Heart of Stone
[1:10:12] the Stony heart out of your flesh
[1:10:17] a transplant
[1:10:20] clear another scripture for transplant
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:27] is your Bible different than mine okay I
[1:10:30] will take away the Stony heart out of
[1:10:32] your flesh and will give you a heart of
[1:10:35] water flesh so God will change heart
[1:10:40] what does changing heart means
[1:10:43] everybody okay
[1:10:45] watch verse 27 and I will put my spirit
[1:10:51] within you
[1:10:53] so God don't just change heart
[1:10:57] everybody okay but God wants to put his
[1:11:00] Spirit within us why
[1:11:05] so to go in the promised land follow me
[1:11:09] it was not a natural going
[1:11:12] it is a going into receiving the Holy
[1:11:16] Ghost
[1:11:21] it is a journey from a Stony Heart To A
[1:11:26] Heart of Flesh that is filled with the
[1:11:28] Holy Spirit
[1:11:32] so if you make it to the promised land
[1:11:34] remember last Sunday it means that God
[1:11:36] have changed everything and giving you
[1:11:39] the Holy Ghost why do you need the Holy
[1:11:42] Ghost
[1:11:42] in Canaan why
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:50] verse 27 and I will put my spirit within
[1:11:56] you
[1:11:57] and cause you to do water walk in my
[1:12:00] statues so what will make you walk in
[1:12:03] this word of God
[1:12:07] who
[1:12:10] are you afraid
[1:12:12] [Music]
[1:12:17] hold this my friend we can preach also
[1:12:19] together
[1:12:22] hey everybody okay thank you so
[1:12:26] when you get into the promised land amen
[1:12:29] God wants to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] why does he want us to have the Holy
[1:12:34] Ghost there must be a purpose and the
[1:12:36] purpose is what he said that and cause
[1:12:39] you to the worker
[1:12:42] walk in my statute why because God
[1:12:45] figured out that whatever he's doing
[1:12:48] with the Lord doesn't work
[1:12:53] he gives the law the people are going
[1:12:55] out he gives the Lord the people are
[1:12:57] going now God found out that the only
[1:13:00] way
[1:13:01] you can leave the law it takes the
[1:13:04] spirit of God
[1:13:09] and let me say this the only way you
[1:13:12] will leave this message
[1:13:16] is only by the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] if the holy spirit is not in your life
[1:13:22] this message is a burden
[1:13:25] it's a religion
[1:13:27] it is something that you suffer all the
[1:13:30] time
[1:13:35] this message is legalistic
[1:13:38] you feel like you in prison all the time
[1:13:43] it's a lack of Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] [Applause]
[1:13:48] amen amen amen
[1:13:51] so why do we need the Holy Ghost we need
[1:13:54] the Holy Ghost so that we will walk
[1:13:57] in my statute everybody here
[1:14:04] to walk
[1:14:09] to keep
[1:14:13] and to do
[1:14:16] the will of God or the word of God or
[1:14:19] the Commandment of God you must have the
[1:14:23] Holy Ghost
[1:14:31] to our king is not your walking
[1:14:35] because your walking was a hypocritical
[1:14:38] walking
[1:14:40] he was a religious walking
[1:14:43] you are working to please your husband
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:48] you were walking to please your wife
[1:14:51] you were walking to please your parents
[1:14:55] because you need favor from your parents
[1:14:58] and your parents wants you to believe
[1:15:00] the message so you gotta do everything
[1:15:02] to please your parent so you can
[1:15:04] continue to gain their favor
[1:15:08] come on but it's not God working in you
[1:15:12] everybody okay but when the spirit of
[1:15:15] the Lord comes in you God himself begin
[1:15:18] to do the walking
[1:15:21] God himself begin to keep his word
[1:15:26] God himself begin to do his word
[1:15:30] in other words I walk by faith they walk
[1:15:33] they're keeping and they're doing is not
[1:15:37] you anymore
[1:15:41] you are in Auto palate my friend that's
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:49] keep that in mind the reason why God
[1:15:52] wants you to have his spirit
[1:15:54] he will ask without his spirit
[1:15:57] the law is a burden
[1:16:01] so God is coming so that he himself can
[1:16:06] walk
[1:16:06] according to his word because God will
[1:16:09] never deviate
[1:16:11] from the word God himself will keep his
[1:16:14] word
[1:16:15] even if you don't want to keep he he
[1:16:17] will keep his word his word will never
[1:16:19] return vote to him
[1:16:21] and the reason why and the doing the
[1:16:24] action in your life won't be you anymore

[1:16:30] acting in your life

[1:57:17] everybody okay we talk about two lines
[1:57:22] Lord help amen we saw the eternal life
[1:57:26] amen
[1:57:27] in the Eternal land we started as a seed
[1:57:31] and that seed is the word
[1:57:33] amen and we were supposed to go into our
[1:57:36] to your family amen which were the body
[1:57:39] of the world that's right and we miss
[1:57:41] our theophany and on our temporal line
[1:57:44] glory to God we started as a soul and a
[1:57:50] spirit amen and we have our flesh
[1:57:54] all our corporal which is the body that
[1:57:59] is for the spirit

[1:58:49] and it's a seed that's right amen which
[1:58:52] is the word
[1:58:53] amen this part is checked so even though

[2:11:05] Jesus said unto him
[2:11:07] that shall love who the Lord thy God
[2:11:10] stop Jesus didn't say here to love you
[2:11:19] number one
[2:11:21] our love
[2:11:24] must be to God Amen
[2:11:27] and God Alone
[2:11:30] follow me carefully please
[2:11:32] how do we love that God amen
[2:11:37] I'm trying to help you
[2:11:39] let's go my brother with all the hearts
[2:11:43] with all that so
[2:11:47] let's stop right there
[2:11:49] you love God with all your heart
[2:11:55] everybody's following me
[2:11:58] with all my water soul and we fall water
[2:12:05] the Bible says Solomon
[2:12:08] as a man thinketh way in his heart so
[2:12:12] the heart has a mind amen
[2:12:15] amen that's it amen
[2:12:18] let me start it again
[2:12:19] Solomon say as a man thinking in his
[2:12:23] heart not his head
[2:12:25] amen you can think with your head but
[2:12:28] you can also think with your heart but
[2:12:31] Solomon say as a man thinking in his
[2:12:33] heart so easy in other words the true
[2:12:36] you is the one in the heart amen the one
[2:12:38] that speak with this intellect is a
[2:12:41] politician that's right amen
[2:12:43] when you ask him about the meal he said
[2:12:46] not too bad but the one then say yak
[2:12:50] amen that's the one that is telling the
[2:12:52] truth amen everybody okay as a man
[2:12:55] thinking in his heart so easy in other
[2:12:58] words the mind is in the heart
[2:13:01] amen
[2:13:04] I'm going slowly
[2:13:05] because we're looking at these things
[2:13:07] are three things
[2:13:09] but they're not everything Amen brother
[2:13:11] Branham said they found that in the
[2:13:13] heart of man that there is a compartment
[2:13:16] that has no cells and brother Branham
[2:13:19] said that was the occupancy of the Soul
[2:13:21] amen so the soul is in the heart because
[2:13:25] when God say love him with his heart it
[2:13:28] doesn't mean this puppy amen the true
[2:13:32] heart is the soul so all I'm trying to
[2:13:35] say is these three things are one amen
[2:13:41] everybody okay amen they're so occupied
[2:13:44] the heart and you thinking in the soul
[2:13:47] so God wants you that want you to love
[2:13:51] him with all your soul
[2:13:54] with your whole being amen the real you
[2:13:57] to love God amen amen in other words God
[2:14:00] wants the true you to love him follow me
[2:14:04] carefully
[2:14:05] we okay Jesus said this is the water
[2:14:09] first and great the first and water
[2:14:12] great commandment
[2:14:14] so this commandment is great amen I'm
[2:14:19] reading the Bible my friend
[2:14:22] this is a great commandment
[2:14:25] a great commandment so not a small a
[2:14:28] great
[2:14:30] Jesus continue
[2:14:32] and the second is water
[2:14:35] in other words the second commandment
[2:14:37] connect to the first you cannot separate
[2:14:41] the two Commandments amen
[2:14:43] I don't know if you're getting me you
[2:14:46] cannot have the first commandment
[2:14:48] without the second amen you cannot have
[2:14:51] the second commandment without the first
[2:14:54] amen if you have one you have the other
[2:14:56] amen
[2:14:58] I cannot carry this bottle without the
[2:15:00] water amen and I cannot carry this bow
[2:15:04] this water alone without the body
[2:15:07] they will be on the floor I need the
[2:15:09] border and the water
[2:15:11] anybody okay so the first commandment is
[2:15:14] your battle and the second commandment
[2:15:16] is inside the first one and the two are
[2:15:20] Blended together are you following me
[2:15:25] the second is like unto it what is the
[2:15:29] second that shall love the water
[2:15:31] neighbor as womb thyself

[2:24:52] where did you get that love
[2:24:54] God love comes from God I'm going slowly
[2:24:57] he said for love is of God and everyone
[2:25:01] that loves is what
[2:25:04] so if you are not born of God you cannot
[2:25:07] love
[2:25:08] I'm going slowly
[2:25:10] okay in other words it's the holy ghost
[2:25:14] that will bring you love
[2:25:17] I know where I'm heading
[2:25:20] and knows God to know him his life
[2:25:23] verse 8 he that loves not knows not God
[2:25:28] for God is what so when the Holy Ghost
[2:25:32] get in you who get in you
[2:25:35] that's why you begin to love God that's
[2:25:38] why you begin to love one another
[2:25:40] I'm going slowly
[2:25:42] everybody okay everybody good
[2:25:45] job to verse 11 beloved
[2:25:49] if God so loved us we ought to also love
[2:25:53] water
[2:25:54] everybody okay
[2:25:55] no man has seen God and Edina
[2:25:59] if we love one another God dwells way
[2:26:07] do you see
[2:26:09] so how do you know God dwell in you
[2:26:13] look at the hatred we have in this
[2:26:14] message
[2:26:17] let me continue he said God dwell in us
[2:26:21] and his love is perfected where
[2:26:25] watch verse 13 very good you there
[2:26:29] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[2:26:34] he wear in us because he has given us of
[2:26:37] what
[2:26:39] everybody clear so when the Holy Ghost
[2:26:43] come in you
[2:26:45] he automatically brings the love of God
[2:26:48] I know where I'm heading
[2:26:51] may God help me out job to verse 16.
[2:26:55] and we know we have known and believe
[2:26:58] the love that God has to us God is what
[2:27:01] my friend love and he that dwell in love
[2:27:05] dwell in and God in him
[2:27:10] [Music]
[2:27:11] do we have to argue with this
[2:27:14] that's why brother Branham say the
[2:27:16] greatest evidence that he knows of the
[2:27:20] Holy Spirit
[2:27:21] is for you to love one another
[2:27:24] because there is no way you can love God
[2:27:26] and don't love your brother the two
[2:27:28] Commandments are connected I want that
[2:27:31] in this church
[2:27:33] this church is not a place for clicks
[2:27:38] this is a whole family
[2:27:40] our nationalities has nothing to do with
[2:27:44] us
[2:27:45] yes sir
[2:27:47] it is not an American Church it is not
[2:27:51] an African church it is not the European
[2:27:54] Church it is a Church of the Living God
[2:27:57] and we should treat one another as a
[2:28:00] family
[2:28:02] amen amen
[2:28:04] everybody create everybody clears and
[2:28:07] respect our differences
[2:28:12] everybody okay everybody okay job to
[2:28:15] verse uh 20. if a man say I love God and
[2:28:20] do what
[2:28:22] he is what
[2:28:24] for he that loves not his brother
[2:28:26] whom he has seen how can he love God
[2:28:30] whom he has not seen
[2:28:33] and this commandment have we from him
[2:28:37] that he who loves God love his water
[2:28:41] that's why Jesus said this is a great
[2:28:44] commandment and the second is unto like
[2:28:46] unto the
[2:28:48] everybody okay the point I was driving
[2:28:52] here is to show you that when the Holy
[2:28:55] Spirit Come he is the one that bring
[2:28:58] love
[2:28:59] because God wants you to love him with
[2:29:03] all your heart all your man all your
[2:29:06] soul and God wants you to love his
[2:29:08] brother his children how are you gonna
[2:29:11] do that without the Holy Spirit
[2:29:13] what are you driving my friend
[2:29:18] everybody okay everybody good listen to
[2:29:21] what Paul says glory to God
[2:29:24] Jesus said on these two Commandments
[2:29:27] hang the water
[2:29:29] and the water so if you love you have
[2:29:32] fulfilled the law
[2:29:34] you don't need the law anymore
[2:29:38] the love of the Commandment with that
[2:29:42] love is a legalistic
[2:29:48] the message of William Marion Branham
[2:29:51] without the love of God will be a hard
[2:29:56] message for you to live
[2:30:02] because the whole message is perfect
[2:30:05] love
[2:30:07] the message itself is perfect love
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:12] so with that love you can leave the
[2:30:15] message
[2:30:16] Jesus Christ
[2:30:19] look at Paul
[2:30:31] watch this
[2:30:33] Paul again in Roman oh no men anything
[2:30:38] but water love one another so you owe me
[2:30:41] love
[2:30:43] and he that love it now that has done
[2:30:45] what to fulfill the law what's the
[2:30:47] Commandment for this that shall not
[2:30:49] commit adultery that shall not kill that
[2:30:52] shall not steal that shall not bail for
[2:30:55] witness that shall not covet if there be
[2:30:58] any other water in other words Paul is
[2:31:01] saying whatever commandment is left that
[2:31:04] I have not uh I mean quoted here all the
[2:31:08] Commandments Paul said it is briefly
[2:31:11] comprehended in this saying namely that
[2:31:15] shall love their neighbor as water in
[2:31:17] other words every commandment of the Old
[2:31:19] Testament can be summarized in one
[2:31:21] commandment that's a love your neighbor
[2:31:24] as what
[2:31:25] and that shall love your neighbor as
[2:31:27] yourself is connected to do to that
[2:31:29] shall love the Lord your God if you do
[2:31:32] those two things you don't need the law
[2:31:34] anymore
[2:31:36] because the law become you
[2:31:41] love worketh no ill to his water
[2:31:44] neighbor therefore love is the
[2:31:47] Fulfillment of water
[2:31:48] why do we need this love
[2:31:52] father helped me up the way our heart
[2:31:56] were created our hard work created wrong
[2:32:04] that's why God said we had got a Stony
[2:32:06] heart
[2:32:08] and brother Branham say a stormy heart
[2:32:10] is a worldly heart
[2:32:13] it's a sinful heart
[2:32:16] there is a snake there
[2:32:19] your desires are wrong
[2:32:22] everybody okay
[2:32:24] so God has to attack the heart because
[2:32:27] out of your heart come the issues of
[2:32:30] your life that's the center of
[2:32:32] everything that is the real you
[2:32:34] follow me carefully
[2:32:38] but Jeremiah says this
[2:32:40] circumcise yourself to the Lord
[2:32:45] you ready my friend
[2:32:47] and take away the false skin of your
[2:32:50] water your heart
[2:32:54] verify your Bible
[2:32:56] so our heart have a foreskin
[2:32:59] I'm reading the Bible
[2:33:01] I'm reading the Bible false King is a
[2:33:06] Nexus flesh
[2:33:08] wow
[2:33:10] that's why we say that's why we see come
[2:33:13] says mayor because we are born with
[2:33:17] excess flesh
[2:33:19] it is disturbing
[2:33:21] it is too much that's why they have to
[2:33:24] see concert they have to cut the Surplus
[2:33:27] off
[2:33:30] and Jeremiah said your heart also
[2:33:34] has a foreskin
[2:33:37] that's why God said you must circumcise
[2:33:40] your heart
[2:33:41] I'm going slowly my friend
[2:33:43] in that the word when you are born in
[2:33:47] this world you have access
[2:33:51] you are born with sin
[2:33:53] [Applause]
[2:33:55] with iniquity God has to cut the bad
[2:33:59] part of you out
[2:34:04] that's fun listen Roman 2 28. for he is
[2:34:10] not a Jew which is where our worldly of
[2:34:14] the flesh neither is that circumcision
[2:34:16] which is at work in the water flesh but
[2:34:20] he is a Jew which is where inward
[2:34:23] ly and see completion is that of death
[2:34:27] all right
[2:34:32] so the Holy Ghost is the one that
[2:34:35] circumcision
[2:34:37] [Music]
[2:34:39] do you follow me so when the spirit of
[2:34:42] the Lord enter into you
[2:34:44] you follow me he cut he's chopping a
[2:34:48] part of you
[2:34:49] and he's removing it why
[2:34:53] follow me
[2:34:55] amen
[2:34:56] not in the leader whose praise is not of
[2:35:00] men but of who God
[2:35:03] Colossians 2 in whom also
[2:35:06] circumcised with the circumcision made
[2:35:09] without it's not human
[2:35:12] in putting off the body of what of the
[2:35:15] water the flesh by the circumcision of
[2:35:18] Hope Christ
[2:35:19] so when class come in you he look at
[2:35:22] where is that sin I got him
[2:35:27] when Jesus looked
[2:35:29] this one came from his grandfather he
[2:35:32] was a drunker that's why he drinks like
[2:35:34] this
[2:35:35] his father was a smoker
[2:35:38] this is coming from his uncle he's a
[2:35:40] mother son
[2:35:41] God pulled them together and he cut it
[2:35:44] off
[2:35:46] do you follow me something is left what
[2:35:48] is left
[2:35:50] follow me carefully
[2:35:53] Deuteronomy 10 verse 15. she come says
[2:35:57] therefore the full skin of your water
[2:36:00] and be no more water
[2:36:04] because God wants you to fulfill his
[2:36:07] commandment he wants you to love him how
[2:36:10] before your heart with all this your
[2:36:13] soul and we follow your mind to do that
[2:36:16] you must have the Holy Ghost
[2:36:18] watch what uh Deuteronomy said and the
[2:36:22] Lord that God will circumcise the water
[2:36:25] so who's doing the circumcision
[2:36:28] and the Heart of that
[2:36:30] This Promise shall be unto you and unto
[2:36:34] your children
[2:36:36] in the Old Testament
[2:36:38] the promise of the Holy Ghost God shall
[2:36:41] circumcise your heart and your heart of
[2:36:43] your children the promise shall be given
[2:36:45] unto you and to your children and as far
[2:36:47] do you see in the Old Testament
[2:36:50] he shall circumstance that heart and the
[2:36:53] Heart of the seed to do what
[2:36:56] that God will father
[2:36:58] and we thought that so that she made
[2:37:01] water so to circumcise your heart is for
[2:37:05] the Holy Spirit to bring the love of God
[2:37:08] in your heart
[2:37:10] amen why is this love important
[2:37:16] everybody okay
[2:37:18] Colossians says 3 3 14 and above all
[2:37:22] things put on Water charity which is
[2:37:24] love which is the pound of water
[2:37:26] perfectness
[2:37:31] when the Holy Ghost come in your life
[2:37:34] do you follow me when God enter into you
[2:37:38] God chopped the world off of you
[2:37:41] amen and God marries you
[2:37:46] I'm going slowly and God needs some
[2:37:50] bonds
[2:37:52] so that you and him can never be
[2:37:56] separated
[2:37:59] the bond God used is the love of God
[2:38:04] God dispatched his love and his love
[2:38:08] hold you and you and God fuse together
[2:38:12] and you become one in other words they
[2:38:16] can never take God out of you without
[2:38:19] taking you off
[2:38:26] because the Rapture is God coming to
[2:38:29] pick up the Holy Ghost back
[2:38:31] so when God is picking up the Holy Ghost
[2:38:34] when the Holy Ghost is coming back to
[2:38:37] God you also are going with your
[2:38:39] promises
[2:38:42] I don't know if you're getting me so the
[2:38:45] Holy Ghost when he comes he brings a
[2:38:48] bond and blends you with God so that you
[2:38:51] and God become United and become one
[2:38:55] that's why Paul says it's the bond of
[2:38:58] perfectness there is no marriage like
[2:39:01] this marriage
[2:39:03] it is a marriage that you and God are
[2:39:06] one
[2:39:09] that's why the Bible say if you love the
[2:39:12] world
[2:39:13] and the things after it means that the
[2:39:17] love of God is not even water in you it
[2:39:20] means that you are not touched to
[2:39:22] correctly
[2:39:24] do you follow me do you follow me so
[2:39:27] when the Holy Spirit Come it Blends you
[2:39:30] and tighten you
[2:39:31] why do you need that Bond
[2:39:35] let's go to Roman 8.
[2:39:37] father help me
[2:39:40] brother Kelly I can't reach where I'm
[2:39:42] going
[2:39:44] yeah I gotta stop somewhere
[2:39:46] let me see if I can stop here I might
[2:39:48] have to change the title
[2:39:50] let's go to Roman 8 if you there you can
[2:39:52] say Amen
[2:39:54] Romans 8.
[2:39:56] Hallelujah
[2:39:59] Roman 8.
[2:40:02] verse 28 because the Bible says that the
[2:40:06] love with the world is enmity with
[2:40:08] Christ it's in James 4 4. let me tighten
[2:40:11] up here and then we can stop somewhere
[2:40:14] because this is a teaching we got to go
[2:40:16] slowly
[2:40:17] Romans 8 verse 28 if you dare you can
[2:40:19] say amen amen the Bible say and we know
[2:40:23] that water all things work together for
[2:40:26] good to them that water love God
[2:40:31] do you see that
[2:40:33] how do you love God to love God you need
[2:40:36] what
[2:40:37] you need toward the Holy Ghost
[2:40:39] and when the Holy Ghost come in your
[2:40:41] life and he bring the bunch of
[2:40:43] perfection between you and Jesus Christ
[2:40:46] everything in your life
[2:40:49] is working together for good
[2:40:54] I don't know if you hated me in other
[2:40:57] words that love have a purpose
[2:41:04] Lord help me
[2:41:06] to them that are called according to his
[2:41:09] water so God had a purpose
[2:41:12] then God calls you when God calls you he
[2:41:16] doesn't stay there he enter into you and
[2:41:19] he Bland with you
[2:41:22] by bringing his love why
[2:41:26] you there
[2:41:27] verse 29 for whom he did what for no he
[2:41:32] also did water to be conformed to the
[2:41:35] image of his Waters sir that he might be
[2:41:37] the first man among water many brothers
[2:41:40] he is the first one so now he's creating
[2:41:43] breathing
[2:41:45] he's God he's creating a mature God
[2:41:49] but he is the top
[2:41:51] can I continue
[2:41:52] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[2:41:56] he also called and whom he has called he
[2:41:59] down water justify and whom he justified
[2:42:02] he has water glorify so when God entered
[2:42:05] into you and blind with you God is
[2:42:09] kissing you
[2:42:11] and telling you that whatever I heard
[2:42:15] about you is over
[2:42:17] [Applause]
[2:42:21] that's what brother Branham said it
[2:42:23] means that you never done anything to
[2:42:26] begin with
[2:42:27] in other words God is is Justified
[2:42:33] removing everything
[2:42:36] let me ask you this
[2:42:38] there is a woman a sister
[2:42:41] you know her very well
[2:42:43] the sister you saw her with the first
[2:42:45] boy
[2:42:46] second boy
[2:42:48] third one
[2:42:49] you have even their picture you even
[2:42:51] keep a record when she posts you pick it
[2:42:54] up when she posts you pick it up when
[2:42:55] she posts you pick it up one of this day
[2:42:57] you see that girl's coming and give her
[2:42:59] life to God you have all her record
[2:43:02] you say she slept with seven boys
[2:43:05] everybody okay and here come a young man
[2:43:08] that you think should not bury that
[2:43:11] woman the young man should marry the one
[2:43:13] that is over there
[2:43:15] and you talk to the young man you say be
[2:43:17] careful with that one that one she was
[2:43:20] that's another rehab my friend she was
[2:43:23] all along with both a health proof look
[2:43:25] at this look at and the young man say
[2:43:27] yes I understand I saw it I saw it she
[2:43:30] was a bad woman okay
[2:43:32] then few months
[2:43:34] you learned that they said
[2:43:50] thank you my friend and you heard that
[2:43:52] the same boy everybody okay that you
[2:43:56] were explaining everything
[2:43:58] and giving all the detail
[2:44:00] is quoting that same girl
[2:44:07] what are you gonna do
[2:44:12] and then they give the date of the
[2:44:14] marriage
[2:44:16] and they invite you there
[2:44:20] [Music]
[2:44:21] everybody okay and on the day of
[2:44:24] marriage you see that boy kissing that
[2:44:26] woman
[2:44:28] in other words the boy is telling the
[2:44:31] woman whatever I've heard about you
[2:44:37] I have dumped it down and I made my
[2:44:41] decision to love you and love causes a
[2:44:46] multitude of sin
[2:44:47] [Applause]
[2:44:55] and the Book of Proverbs say that Love
[2:44:58] cover all sin in other word when God
[2:45:03] bring his love to you he's wiping
[2:45:06] everything amen
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:12] you can keep what you know about me but
[2:45:16] God doesn't remember because he goes to
[2:45:19] the Sea of God's unforgiveness
[2:45:22] [Applause]
[2:45:27] that's why when you are true truly
[2:45:31] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:45:33] and the love of God he breaks the
[2:45:36] complex off from your life
[2:45:38] when you dance you dancing with pride
[2:45:41] because you know nothing
[2:45:44] [Applause]
[2:45:49] let me stop here because if I push it
[2:45:52] deeper okay let me stop here let's go to
[2:45:56] ruminate
[2:45:59] remind me brother Caleb change this with
[2:46:02] the Holy Ghost and the love of God then
[2:46:05] I will come back to the resources
[2:46:07] and we see why everybody okay
[2:46:10] we are justified in verse 30 verse 31
[2:46:14] what shall we then say to these things
[2:46:17] if God be water if that boy is for me
[2:46:22] if the boy that you gossip that you saw
[2:46:25] my bad picture you show him my picture
[2:46:28] in pant you show him my picture when I
[2:46:31] was smoking if that boy is for me
[2:46:34] [Applause]
[2:46:40] you better find another church
[2:46:42] because when I'm coming to church I will
[2:46:45] always hug him like this
[2:46:47] [Applause]
[2:46:47] [Music]
[2:46:50] as he didn't look upon my fault he
[2:46:54] looked beyond my fault and so my need
[2:46:58] all right
[2:47:01] [Applause]
[2:47:05] you disqualify me but he qualify me
[2:47:10] you thought I was a nobody he saw
[2:47:13] something good out of me he saw me as a
[2:47:16] somebody
[2:47:18] and he giving me the privilege to be his
[2:47:21] mother
[2:47:22] the mother of his children
[2:47:25] if I remember what I did and how the
[2:47:29] church gossip about me and that young
[2:47:31] man regardless of the gossip still marry
[2:47:34] me how would I love that young man
[2:47:36] [Applause]
[2:47:40] [Music]
[2:47:41] who can separate me from the love of thy
[2:47:45] young man
[2:47:46] this is what I'm about to read who can
[2:47:49] separate me for the man that pass on my
[2:47:52] mistake and still come and get me
[2:47:55] that is what I'm driving
[2:47:57] [Applause]
[2:48:01] let's go to verse 31 what shall we say
[2:48:05] then this thing if God be for who us who
[2:48:09] shall be water against them who are you
[2:48:12] if God qualified me who are you
[2:48:14] [Applause]
[2:48:17] if God put me in this Pulpit to be a
[2:48:21] pastor who are you
[2:48:25] what is your opinion Gonna Change
[2:48:30] I'd want me to be this in my life who
[2:48:33] are you
[2:48:33] [Applause]
[2:48:36] because when the ways of men pleases God
[2:48:39] he even put a peace his enemy
[2:48:42] [Applause]
[2:48:43] [Music]
[2:48:46] let's go my friend let's finish here he
[2:48:48] that spelled not his own hope son but
[2:48:51] deliver him up for who
[2:48:53] how shall he not also do what freely
[2:48:57] give us all things freely give us water
[2:49:00] some things
[2:49:02] [Music]
[2:49:09] amen
[2:49:10] Amen in other words when my husband is
[2:49:14] with me and I say honey I need to eat I
[2:49:18] want you to take me out come again
[2:49:21] and stand there and tell him not to take
[2:49:24] me
[2:49:25] come and tell him
[2:49:28] come again and tell him go again and
[2:49:31] gossip about me
[2:49:35] everybody okay who shall lay anything to
[2:49:40] the charge of water it is God that did
[2:49:43] water
[2:49:44] who is he that
[2:49:47] help me my brother it is Christ that who
[2:49:49] did water yeah rather that is what
[2:49:53] who is even at the right hand of who and
[2:49:57] who's making water
[2:49:59] in other words Jesus not only justifies
[2:50:03] you but he put himself in the position
[2:50:06] that when he you make a mistake he's
[2:50:08] pleading for you so that nobody says
[2:50:11] nothing
[2:50:13] in other words you are full coverage
[2:50:18] [Applause]
[2:50:20] that's why you no longer want a sin not
[2:50:24] because it is a commandment but because
[2:50:26] of what you see what he did for you as
[2:50:30] an appreciation to his love now you
[2:50:34] wanna please him in what you're doing
[2:50:37] that's the message of William Marion
[2:50:39] Branham that is perfect love
[2:50:42] [Applause]
[2:50:44] cast out
[2:50:45] [Music]
[2:50:47] my friend
[2:50:48] he said who shall water separate us from
[2:50:53] heart
[2:50:54] because love is the bond of perfectness
[2:50:57] it is an eternal Bond when you are glue
[2:51:01] you hitched
[2:51:02] forever who can separate if God bonded
[2:51:06] something who can debond
[2:51:12] who can separate us from the water shall
[2:51:16] water tribulation in other words a true
[2:51:19] man or a woman that is born of the
[2:51:22] spirit of God tribulation won't do
[2:51:25] nothing to him
[2:51:27] when you going to try the love of God
[2:51:32] is stop giving you strength that's why
[2:51:35] the Holy Spirit establishes the love
[2:51:40] but you still love the husband
[2:51:46] let's go my friend please who shall
[2:51:48] separate us from the water Love Of
[2:51:50] Christ child water tribulation all water
[2:51:53] distress all water persecution oh water
[2:51:55] feminine or water nakedness or water or
[2:51:59] water swords jump to verse 37 nay in all
[2:52:03] these things we are water more than
[2:52:05] conquerors through him that did water
[2:52:07] Father Brown I'm saying more than
[2:52:10] conqueror because he already conquered
[2:52:15] you don't have to conquer you are only
[2:52:17] taking into position
[2:52:22] let's go my friend 38 for I am water
[2:52:25] persuaded that neither yes no life no
[2:52:29] angels nor principal nor powers nor
[2:52:32] presently oh
[2:52:35] no no
[2:52:38] any other creature shall be able to do
[2:52:41] whatever from the water the love of God
[2:52:44] which is in her that's why the Holy
[2:52:47] Ghost bring you love
[2:52:48] [Applause]
[2:52:48] [Music]
[2:52:52] [Applause]
[2:52:55] whatever they can bring against this
[2:52:58] message don't work
[2:53:00] because I'm in love
[2:53:02] [Applause]
[2:53:03] [Music]
[2:53:05] [Applause]
[2:53:07] the greatest evidence is the love
[2:53:10] the love of God and to love it takes the
[2:53:13] Holy Spirit to bring the love of God to
[2:53:16] circumcise the flesh I will get to
[2:53:18] Romans 5 later on down the road amen and
[2:53:21] when the Holy Ghost come he brings the
[2:53:23] bond of perfection God before he start
[2:53:27] giving you everything he in other words
[2:53:30] he take you like brother Branham say I
[2:53:33] love my wife so much that I can take her
[2:53:35] and put her into myself so the love of
[2:53:38] God take you and put you into God
[2:53:43] until if somebody
[2:53:47] you get married
[2:53:49] the people talk about you
[2:53:51] the day of marriage You Came the boy
[2:53:54] love you he marry you when you going do
[2:53:57] you care who is gossiping about you
[2:54:00] [Music]
[2:54:04] let me make it clear
[2:54:06] especially if that boy is well
[2:54:09] established
[2:54:10] if he's wealthy
[2:54:13] he's a rich boy
[2:54:15] and he said you know what honey I need
[2:54:19] to make a surprise for you let me get
[2:54:21] you a Mercedes
[2:54:23] and when you're driving the Mercedes and
[2:54:25] everybody's saying look at her do you
[2:54:28] care
[2:54:29] because you care about the one that love
[2:54:31] you the one that give you the car
[2:54:37] the Holy Ghost wanna make sure when he
[2:54:39] gets him before we move into deep
[2:54:42] territory let me lock you in me
[2:54:46] so that no matter what is happening
[2:54:49] you are mine
[2:54:50] you are stabilized you won't look to the
[2:54:53] left you won't look to the right because
[2:54:55] I'm gonna start blessing your life into
[2:54:58] different aspects but before I start the
[2:55:01] blessing before I start affecting your
[2:55:04] life let me block you to myself
[2:55:07] so that you will never change my mind
[2:55:10] because I'm gonna give you the secret of
[2:55:12] the Deadpool and the devil cannot create
[2:55:15] and if I give it to you you can turn
[2:55:18] your back to me because that secret can
[2:55:21] never be given to the devil
[2:55:23] so let me pull you into Masada and bring
[2:55:26] you into the bond of perfectness let's
[2:55:29] stop here we will pick up later God
[2:55:31] bless you let's learn
[2:55:32] [Applause]
[2:55:44] remember where we stop
[2:55:46] but we will come back to Faith and love
[2:55:50] the Holy Spirit coming
[2:55:52] and he has a purpose
[2:55:54] God has a purpose God wants to remove
[2:55:57] that Stony heart
[2:55:59] because when you get there you will walk
[2:56:02] you will keep you will do
[2:56:06] unless brother uh
[2:56:09] kief uses the board if not leave this
[2:56:12] so we will pick it up
[2:56:15] accept our change inspiration amen but
[2:56:18] I'm trying to this is just the first
[2:56:20] point I want to establish when the Holy
[2:56:23] Ghost come what does he do what happened
[2:56:25] what happened inside of you the world is
[2:56:28] chopped off
[2:56:32] and God is establishing himself he
[2:56:35] locked you into love
[2:56:37] because what I'm getting to bring you
[2:56:40] next
[2:56:41] after you lock in love and God
[2:56:43] stabilizes you then I'm gonna show you
[2:56:46] what else does the Holy Ghost now begin
[2:56:49] to do inside of you and you will see
[2:56:51] what God does in you
[2:56:53] and you won't have to push nothing
[2:56:57] you don't have to fabricate nothing
[2:57:01] you will see because the one who walk is
[2:57:03] natural the one who keep is natural the
[2:57:06] one who do is natural I'm trying to
[2:57:09] bring you to the rest of roof
[2:57:11] where roof is resting it is Boaz doing
[2:57:15] the work of redemption he knows what
[2:57:18] he's doing
[2:57:19] you just gonna start enjoying the
[2:57:22] blessing the way he's directing you but
[2:57:25] I will show this is just the first point
[2:57:26] bringing the love of God to fulfill the
[2:57:29] law
[2:57:31] and after that what else does the Holy
[2:57:33] Ghost does
[2:57:34] keep me in prayer Heavenly Father Lord
[2:57:37] we are approaching you humbly father
[2:57:39] today Lord once again we thank you for
[2:57:42] the love of God
[2:57:44] father
[2:57:46] what else can we express to you
[2:57:49] because of everything that you have done
[2:57:51] for us
[2:57:53] now we heard so much about the Holy
[2:57:56] Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the
[2:57:59] Holy Ghost
[2:58:00] we memorize this but we never understood
[2:58:03] well
[2:58:04] what is really your spirit cometh to do
[2:58:07] in our life
[2:58:08] but today
[2:58:10] you are expanding more to us
[2:58:12] what you mean by seeking ye first
[2:58:17] putting you first
[2:58:19] making you the Delight
[2:58:21] because David says
[2:58:23] if we make you our Delight you will give
[2:58:26] us the desires of our heart
[2:58:29] and how can we make you our Delight if
[2:58:32] you yourself don't come to make yourself
[2:58:34] a delight in our life
[2:58:36] that's why Paul says that you have given
[2:58:39] us the love of the truth
[2:58:41] so that we can be saved so there is
[2:58:44] something in us that we cannot explain
[2:58:46] that just love you
[2:58:49] that even when we thought we were angry
[2:58:52] towards you
[2:58:53] because our mother died
[2:58:55] because such and such thing happen
[2:58:57] because a tragedy happen in our life and
[2:59:01] we thought that we have a right to hate
[2:59:03] you
[2:59:04] but still while we were yet sinner
[2:59:08] you died for us and your love is
[2:59:11] unconditional
[2:59:12] that's why you don't look at our state
[2:59:14] but you look at what you put in US
[2:59:17] and once that love established
[2:59:20] what else can separate us from you
[2:59:23] father May that love pulsate
[2:59:25] in the life of your children
[2:59:28] in this church in the families of this
[2:59:31] church May whoever who have not
[2:59:34] experienced this love
[2:59:37] and know clearly but what has been
[2:59:40] demonstrated today
[2:59:42] that they do not have their love
[2:59:44] they have a love of a dominant offer of
[2:59:47] a denomination they have a love of a
[2:59:50] church
[2:59:51] where do you love the people that goes
[2:59:53] to your church and the other one we
[2:59:55] don't love them
[2:59:56] they love they love they have the love
[2:59:58] of the clicks
[3:00:00] but father that's not the love that
[3:00:02] you're talking about
[3:00:04] a love that can look beyond our thought
