[34:28] I'm I'm so encouraged and I feel like
[34:30] God's pushing me to say it
[34:34] amen okay I told Brother Sten like right
[34:38] after that um I've had eczema my whole
[34:42] life really bad when Zach and I met it
[34:45] had cleared up and it had just
[34:46] progressively gotten worse since since
[34:49] now I had it um when we first moved here
[34:51] I thought surely us moving here maybe
[34:53] it'll take some stress off it'll clear
[34:55] up about five times worse it was I
[34:58] couldn't sleep at night I would say I
[35:01] just scratch it my skin would be so dry
[35:04] everything was painful I look like a
[35:07] burn victim you know people were asking
[35:09] me about it they thought it was poison
[35:10] iy they thought it was allergies all
[35:12] over my legs and my arms just
[35:15] painful and with the theme of these last
[35:19] couple months of services you know being
[35:21] healing speaking your healing taking the
[35:23] word and and becoming speaking over
[35:27] um I started doing that I I would just
[35:30] cry to Zach like I just don't understand
[35:32] why it's gotten so bad and he said you
[35:35] know what you need to do you need to
[35:37] just stop complaining about it you need
[35:38] to write down every scripture you can
[35:40] find about healing in your phone and
[35:43] every time it's bothering you you can't
[35:44] sleep at night or it's burning you need
[35:46] to just reread them over and over again
[35:49] and I told Brother Steven that whenever
[35:50] it cleared up I would give a testimony
[35:53] and I'm trying to avoid it cuz I don't
[35:55] like talking go too I talk too much
[35:59] but uh my hands over the last week it's
[36:03] completely gone on my
[36:17] hands every day every day for the last
[36:20] two or three weeks and I mean every day
[36:21] I would moisturize I would shower and
[36:23] every single day multiple times a day I
[36:25] would just say thank you Jesus for my
[36:27] I'm I'm completely healed I would talk
[36:29] to my skin saying you're healed in Jesus
[36:32] name I'm waiting for it to be completely
[36:34] healed on my ankles it's almost
[36:36] completely
[36:39] gone glory to God amen amen we have one
[36:43] more
[36:44] testimony
[36:50] amen
[36:53] hallelujah I am so happy because Sunday
[36:57] after the
[36:58] Ser one of the one of the four point was
[37:02] remember me remember the main thing so
[37:05] as the Holy Ghost was telling us about
[37:08] us the the last one remember me was kind
[37:11] of um really touches me so I heard in my
[37:16] heart there is two REM there is to
[37:20] remember me there is the one the Lord is
[37:22] asking you to remember him but there is
[37:25] also another of the F on the cross
[37:29] asking for the Lord to remember him so I
[37:32] said father remember me you want me to
[37:34] remember you but remember me too because
[37:38] you know I told my husband like two
[37:41] weeks
[37:42] ago I saw the Lord Jesus I know the
[37:46] Bible say I will be with you the world
[37:50] the world will not see me but you shall
[37:51] see me so you can see the Lord in Vision
[37:55] I have to say that so I saw the Lord he
[37:58] was standing there but before the Lord
[38:00] there were two two men talking to him
[38:04] they were they were wearing white
[38:06] clothes they were before him but the
[38:08] Lord was focusing on me the two men was
[38:11] were like here but the Lord was here
[38:14] looking at me over there instead of
[38:16] focusing on them he was looking at me so
[38:19] when I I came I came back to myself I
[38:22] told my husband oh the Lord is looking
[38:24] at me but he has people before him
[38:27] what's the meaning of it so I told my
[38:29] husband when the two Prophet are coming
[38:33] are there going to be adult baby or what
[38:36] because something is telling you like
[38:37] that before he deal with them you need
[38:39] to deal with us the bride so he's
[38:42] looking at me but these people here are
[38:44] pressing him like they want to go so I
[38:46] felt like we have to prepare for the
[38:48] coming of the Lord so I was telling God
[38:51] I said father remember me remember my
[38:54] children remember my husband I was there
[38:56] praying because I I I knew that the Lord
[39:00] is is about to do something I knew for
[39:02] sure so I was praying like that I prayed
[39:05] I pray I finished praying I went outside
[39:08] it was like Jesus waiting for me at the
[39:11] door sister Ed start talking to me Isaac
[39:15] will be fine L will be fine you you
[39:17] start talking to me like the things I
[39:18] was praying there I knew what I was
[39:20] telling the Lord so I knew was Jesus
[39:22] telling me don't
[39:25] worry
[39:27] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:30] hallelujah amen and amen amen amen
[39:38] amen amen so brother Charles amen
[39:42] amen we just want to bless the name of
[39:44] the Lord amen and also bring before the
[39:47] Lord our tithes and our offerings
[39:50] amen two minutes that's
[39:54] possible devil been fighting me week and
[39:57] all day I mean I have
[40:00] class have the training and all day long
[40:05] I'm leaving out of class because well
[40:07] this accident you know um we got to
[40:10] reach out to this this uh insurance
[40:13] insurance representative they're calling
[40:15] me from work now we have a u a job site
[40:18] superintendent he's calling me from he's
[40:20] calling me from work hey they don't have
[40:22] these manholes covered now it's just me
[40:25] that bringing on somebody else but it's
[40:27] 320 or 30 between 320 350 employees and
[40:31] it's just me so then after that getting
[40:35] ready to
[40:36] leave they called me they said Charles
[40:38] somebody uh was digging up a tree with
[40:40] an excavator and it came through the
[40:42] window so I did what I had to do he was
[40:45] all right and everything then soon I'm
[40:47] on my way home and I already prepared
[40:49] because we got out of class late so I'm
[40:51] on my way home and my wife I told my
[40:53] wife okay while I'm on my way home and
[40:55] so forth and here come they called me
[40:57] again they said
[40:59] Charles they just turned the truck over
[41:02] I said okay where where did they turn
[41:04] the truck over at Davis Village and
[41:07] that's in Wind gate so I said all right
[41:10] I called my wife said sweetheart I ain't

[41:14] got to the site did everything I had to
[41:16] do soon as I um they asked me to take

[41:22] here so I said Lord I'm going soon as I
[41:24] get soon as I almost get here I hit
[41:27] traffic but the first thing something
[41:29] rose up and said well I'm going to make
[41:32] it anyway I said Lord open a hole for me

[50:40] the worship service tonight and the
[50:42] praise service and amen what a blessing
[50:45] Amen to come to the house of the Lord
[50:46] and amen I'll tell you there's a lot of
[50:49] prophecy on that third day isn't there
[50:51] amen if you ever run that through the
[50:54] scripture that's a powerful
[50:56] that's a powerful thought it's I think
[50:58] it's the third day that when Joshua
[51:00] raised up and went over the Jordan
[51:02] wasn't it and it was in the third day do
[51:04] you know that's the that's the day of
[51:07] the Jewish wedding is the third day it's
[51:10] it's because that it was in the third
[51:11] day that life was created the first time
[51:14] and that that third day is a powerful
[51:17] powerful thing I think that's when
[51:19] Esther went in after the golden scepter
[51:21] it was on that third day and it was in
[51:24] the book of Hosea he said in the third
[51:26] day amen I'll revive you amen I
[51:29] certainly believe tonight amen that it
[51:32] was the third day wasn't it when Jesus
[51:34] come out of the Tomb but the third day
[51:37] had a morning and it had an
[51:39] evening and in the morning of the third
[51:41] day there was in isua Street Holy Ghost
[51:44] fell and the prophet of God said they
[51:46] had a rumor that he was alive that's
[51:48] right but in the evening time he proved
[51:51] he was alive amen and we're in the
[51:54] evening of the third day amen amen when
[51:57] they went into that little
[51:59] room amen that tent of meeting they went
[52:02] in that little room and there the
[52:03] Vindication of the Resurrection was made
[52:05] known among them and I believe in the
[52:08] evening time amen it has become light
[52:11] amen God bless you all it's certainly
[52:13] beig good to hear tonight and amen the
[52:15] thing about a third day is it can be a
[52:17] third day can be a third whenever you
[52:18] start counting right so if it's on
[52:21] Friday it's a Sunday and if it's on
[52:23] Sunday it's a Tuesday that's right
[52:25] that's the reason that an eighth day can
[52:26] also be a third day that's and it could
[52:28] be a sixth day or seventh day amen it's
[52:32] however God counts them amen whatever he
[52:34] counts it's this
[52:36] day it's this
[52:39] day one more you remember in the Matthew
[52:42] 24 Jesus said to them they said Lord
[52:45] When shall these things be and what
[52:46] shall be the sign of thy coming and do
[52:48] you know that actually happened on a
[52:50] Tuesday Afternoon brother Bram said in
[52:53] the morning he answered one of them
[52:54] questions was asked but in the evening
[52:57] Tuesday I think it was April the 3 he
[53:00] said he sat down with them and told them
[53:02] the rest of those answers so in the
[53:05] third day come the answers yes sir and
[53:09] brother Bram said see it was right there
[53:12] that every seal was in Matthew
[53:14] 24 he said but the seven seal wasn't
[53:16] written can we unveil you something it
[53:19] was the one
[53:21] talking and he speaks himself on the
[53:24] third day
[53:25] and answers all the
[53:27] questions I believe this is the hour for
[53:29] it don't you I believe this is the time
[53:32] for it amen I want to say greetings to
[53:34] you tonight from True Word Tabernacle

[55:02] Ephesians for quite a little while at
[55:04] home and uh I certainly believe that
[55:06] this is the New Testament Joshua amen
[55:10] which would be exactly uh where we are
[55:12] as a church amen in the book of
[55:15] Ephesians amen a positioning of the
[55:18] church in Ephesians chapter 2 and I want
[55:20] to read the 19th down to the 22nd verse
[55:25] amen now therefore you are No More
[55:28] Strangers yes sir and foreigners but
[55:31] fellow citizens with the Saints and of

[55:42] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[55:46] Chief
[55:48] Cornerstone in whom all the building
[55:50] fitly framed together groweth unto a
[55:53] holy Temple in the Lord Lord amen in
[55:56] whom ye also yes sir are builded
[56:00] together for an habitation of God

[56:28] Lord as we Endeavor to speak to them may
[56:30] you help us oh God and may you be the
[56:33] voice that's behind the voice may you
[56:35] speak to the need of your children God
[56:38] and as we would Minister in your word we
[56:41] invite you and we ask you for these
[56:43] things now in Jesus name amen and amen
[56:48] may God bless you tonight as you're
[56:50] seated amen if I would take a title
[56:52] tonight I want to speak to you on holy
[57:03] habitations holy
[57:05] habitations amen uh this is a beautiful
[57:09] uh book to me the book of Ephesians uh
[57:12] it's the New Testament book of Joshua
[57:15] amen which lets us realize amen that it
[57:18] was a book of positioning brother Bram
[57:21] tells us that this is not an Evangelical
[57:24] book
[57:25] this book is much like second Peter
[57:28] chapter 1 when Peter begins to uh talk
[57:31] about the Statue of a perfect man
[57:33] remember he begins it and he says a
[57:35] Brethren of like Precious faith and the
[57:38] prophet said see he begins it like Paul
[57:41] Begins the Ephesians this is not to
[57:43] people coming to the Holy Ghost this is
[57:45] people who already have the Holy Ghost
[57:48] amen and they're being positioned in the
[57:50] church by the word amen isn't it
[57:52] something the word positions the church
[57:54] Church in their appropriate places amen
[57:58] and we find that here amen that Paul has
[58:01] come through the first chapter which is
[58:02] a powerful chapter I wish I could preach
[58:04] the old chapter to you tonight but I
[58:05] can't amen but you see he moves through
[58:08] this whole chapter and then he begins
[58:10] the second chapter by saying to you that
[58:13] you who he hath quickened who were dead
[58:15] in trespasses and sins and in times Past
[58:19] walk so Paul Begins the second chapter
[58:21] speaking to these Ephesians amen who
[58:24] have brought into to the things of God
[58:27] and he spent the whole first part of the
[58:29] Ephesians trying to minister to them
[58:31] upon this but now he comes and tells
[58:33] them what God has actually done for them
[58:36] it's something that has already happened
[58:38] but now he's explaining to them the
[58:40] grace that has been shed toward their
[58:42] lives and while he's doing this it's
[58:45] amazing because if you're reading the
[58:46] scriptures uh you it's it's amazing
[58:49] because this is where brother bam brings
[58:50] uh uh Easter seal you who have quickened
[58:53] he brings a rising of the sun you who ha
[58:56] quickened and he's speaking of spiritual
[58:58] Resurrection taking place in the church
[59:01] and when he gets down to it he said God
[59:03] who is rich in Mercy and that's another
[59:05] title of a prophet he said which what is
[59:08] showing you is he says watch Israel was
[59:11] carried to their promised land on the
[59:13] wings of an
[59:14] eagle and he said there was many
[59:16] impersonators that tried to follow them
[59:18] but they were swallowed up by the Red
[59:20] Sea he said but the reason it couldn't
[59:22] swallow Israel was because they were
[59:25] following a message they were being
[59:27] packed On Eagle's Wings amen and so is
[59:30] the Church of the Living God being
[59:31] packed on Eagles Wings being packed
[59:34] according to scripture now he said we
[59:36] have bore thee On Eagle's Wings and he
[59:38] said I have brought you unto myself so
[59:41] where is the church coming to they're
[59:42] coming to their positions in God this
[59:45] message is packing you past uh your
[59:48] ideas and it's packing you past just
[59:51] good church membership and it's packing
[59:53] you to Christ it's bringing you to
[59:56] himself the thought he had of you before
[59:58] the world ever began that's where you're
[1:00:00] going back to you're going back to the
[1:00:02] mind of God Amen because he had you on
[1:00:05] his mind it's amazing to me that when
[1:00:07] Paul begins to WR write about this he
[1:00:10] begins to show the grace that has been
[1:00:12] given unto us and calls us the
[1:00:14] workmanship of almighty God we're very
[1:00:17] the creation of God the bride of Christ
[1:00:20] being the creation of God and he said
[1:00:22] now remember this you were all G Iles
[1:00:25] and you were called uncircumcision of
[1:00:27] them that were circumcision he said
[1:00:30] matter of fact you were without God in
[1:00:32] this world amen amen you were without
[1:00:35] God in this world and not only were you
[1:00:37] without God the Bible tells us that you
[1:00:40] were foreigners to the Commonwealth of
[1:00:43] Israel and you were strangers and had no
[1:00:47] rights in the very sanctions of almighty
[1:00:49] God am it's amazing to me sometimes when
[1:00:52] you begin to study the scripture and you
[1:00:54] get in the Old Testament and you realize
[1:00:57] that what we're enjoying tonight and the
[1:01:00] blessings we're enjoying the Bible
[1:01:02] itself in the days of Moses pre
[1:01:05] prevented a gentile from coming into the
[1:01:08] house of God exact they could burn in
[1:01:10] sense they couldn't have blood they
[1:01:12] couldn't make sacrifices God has called
[1:01:15] us aliens he called us enemies can you
[1:01:18] imagine being the enemy of God and being
[1:01:22] a stranger of God but Paul says but ye
[1:01:25] who were strangers and ye who were
[1:01:27] foreigners you were who far off are made
[1:01:30] nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:34] amen and every scripture and every
[1:01:37] ordinance what was against you Paul said
[1:01:39] he nailed it to the Cross that's exactly
[1:01:42] and he abolished in the cross every
[1:01:45] scripture that would hold the church out
[1:01:48] of the presence of God and then he began
[1:01:50] to say to them that you're No More
[1:01:52] Strangers you're no more foreigners amen
[1:01:54] but your fellow citizens of the
[1:01:56] household of God God put you in his
[1:02:00] houseen amen and God's provided place of
[1:02:03] worship brother B said you're in the
[1:02:05] household of God now you're under his
[1:02:08] name and you have been built under the
[1:02:10] foundations of the Apostles and the
[1:02:13] prophets now when you start talking
[1:02:14] about this build upon the foundations of
[1:02:17] the Apostles and the prophets brother B
[1:02:19] actually ties this scripture to
[1:02:21] Revelation 3 and verse 12 for he that
[1:02:24] cometh will I make a pillar in the
[1:02:26] temple of God and he shall go no more
[1:02:29] out and I will ride upon him the name of
[1:02:32] my God yes sir and the name of the city
[1:02:35] of my God Amen what's the name of my God
[1:02:39] Jesus what is the name of the city of my
[1:02:41] God the New Jerusalem which is the New
[1:02:44] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:02:46] Heaven from God I will ride upon them my
[1:02:50] new name amen now it's just amazing cuz
[1:02:53] brother bam ties this a pillar is a
[1:02:55] foundation it is a temple of the
[1:02:57] household of God the Temple of my God
[1:03:00] the house of my God it's a pillar SE a
[1:03:03] foundation now brother bam takes this
[1:03:05] word and ties it to Ephesians chapter 2
[1:03:08] and verse 19 he says see he that
[1:03:10] overcometh will I make him a pillar in
[1:03:13] other words a part of the foundation
[1:03:17] that's exactly right what will I give
[1:03:19] him I will put in him the doctrine amen
[1:03:24] of the Apostles and prophets from the
[1:03:27] beginning and give him the Revelation
[1:03:29] sir he will put in them the doctrine of
[1:03:33] what Paul taught in the Ephesian age he
[1:03:35] will put that Doctrine in the church let
[1:03:37] me let me just say this to you once it's
[1:03:40] put in you you can't get it out of
[1:03:43] youen Amen once the doctrine of this
[1:03:46] message ever reaches your heart it can
[1:03:49] never be taken out of you it can be put
[1:03:51] on your body it'll come out it be put on
[1:03:54] your spirit it'll come out but if this
[1:03:57] word ever reaches the soul of the Church
[1:04:00] of the Living God you'll never get it
[1:04:02] out of them brother amen once Revelation
[1:04:05] breaks into that Soul it becomes a part
[1:04:07] of them it is the marriage of the Lamb
[1:04:10] it is a part of them it becomes a part
[1:04:13] of who you are amen what is it I will
[1:04:15] give to him I will put my doctr yes
[1:04:18] sir glory to God sorry I can't hardly
[1:04:22] preach with this here cold on amen you
[1:04:24] see what it is he said I'll put him him
[1:04:27] the doctrine in other words brother Ram
[1:04:29] says in another place he says I will
[1:04:31] give him in other words a part of the
[1:04:33] foundation I will give him I will put
[1:04:36] the doctrine the apostles and prophets
[1:04:38] in him and give him the levation yes sir
[1:04:41] my goodness I will put in him the
[1:04:44] foundation of my word amen in the
[1:04:47] household of God I'll put him in as a
[1:04:49] pillar you may see he'll stay with that
[1:04:52] word now watch him because he also says
[1:04:54] what is it it's he's the pillar and he
[1:04:57] ain't going out no more amen I tell you
[1:05:00] what once that word get in there there's
[1:05:02] no way to get it out of there amen you
[1:05:05] take a drop of water and put it in a
[1:05:07] glass of wine and then you get the water
[1:05:10] out of that wine for me there's no way
[1:05:12] once it becomes a part of it it's a part
[1:05:14] of it and once the word becomes a part
[1:05:17] of you yes and you're a part of the work
[1:05:19] you'll never separate them you'll never
[1:05:21] get them apart Paul said it he said
[1:05:24] nothing shall separate us from the love
[1:05:26] of God that is in Christ Jesus there
[1:05:29] ain't nothing that has been able to do
[1:05:31] it there's nothing that can do it and
[1:05:33] there's nothing coming that can do it
[1:05:35] because it's a part of who we are when I
[1:05:38] think of the grace of God Amen that God
[1:05:41] himself has designed and desired yes sir
[1:05:44] Amen to uh make us a part of his
[1:05:46] household sir and to live in that church
[1:05:50] as a habitation now Moses himself God
[1:05:54] started this process much in the days of
[1:05:56] Moses when he told God God told Moses
[1:05:59] that he wanted to dwell with his people
[1:06:01] that's exactly right he told them I want
[1:06:03] to make a tabernacle I want to make a
[1:06:06] meeting place that's right I want you to
[1:06:08] build a tent that's amen and that tent
[1:06:11] will house my presence among my people
[1:06:14] yes my brother amen now people say
[1:06:15] brother Wayne Amen what about that tent
[1:06:17] Vision I'll tell you what Moses had a
[1:06:19] tent Vision too so this Prophet had a
[1:06:22] tent Vision in the old test
[1:06:24] and a prophet had a tent Vision in a New
[1:06:26] Testament and they're speaking about the
[1:06:28] same thing they're talking about the
[1:06:31] dwelling presence of almighty God it's
[1:06:33] got to have a
[1:06:35] house amen and Moses was building this
[1:06:38] house but what Moses build it upon Moses
[1:06:41] didn't build it on his ideas no sir can
[1:06:44] you imagine a man thinking up a way to
[1:06:46] house God a man trying to make a
[1:06:50] habitation for God uh but according to
[1:06:52] the scriptures in Hebrews 8 Paul said we
[1:06:55] serve under the example and the shadow
[1:06:57] of heavenly things Moses was admonished
[1:07:00] of God when he was about to make the
[1:07:02] Tabernacle and he saith thou make all
[1:07:04] things according to the pattern showed
[1:07:06] thee in the mount in Hebrews 923 he said
[1:07:10] if is therefore necessary patterns of
[1:07:12] things in Heavens should be purified
[1:07:15] with these but Heavenly things
[1:07:16] themselves with better sacrifices than
[1:07:18] these so the things that was built upon
[1:07:20] the Earth were pattering what Moses had
[1:07:23] saw in the Heavens amen when Moses build
[1:07:26] it upon the Earth he was pattering a
[1:07:29] human being amen he was showing you a
[1:07:32] human being in a tabernacle he was
[1:07:34] making it by skins the same way God
[1:07:38] would make a bride of skins he was
[1:07:41] making a tabernacle of skins and he was
[1:07:43] building it upon the pattern that's why
[1:07:45] there were three different Realms of
[1:07:47] that old Tabernacle amen that three was
[1:07:50] the outer Court the inner court and the
[1:07:52] holies of holies is that right amen and
[1:07:54] so is there a body a soul and a spirit
[1:07:57] of man there is three different Realms
[1:07:59] of the Tabernacle there are three Realms
[1:08:01] of the of the of the human being because
[1:08:04] God's Throne was not ever meant to be in
[1:08:07] a building it was only a pattern of what
[1:08:10] God was going to do in the future he was
[1:08:14] going through a pattern amen it was
[1:08:16] Moses that built it amen and Moses built
[1:08:19] that pattern and it was an original
[1:08:21] pattern David later seeing this this
[1:08:24] this this Tabernacle that traveled
[1:08:26] through the Wilderness with them so it
[1:08:27] wasn't a a permanent Dwelling Place it
[1:08:30] was a a traveling place but I tell you
[1:08:32] something that's powerful to me amen
[1:08:35] wherever that tent went the presence
[1:08:37] went with it amen wherever the tent went
[1:08:39] the presence went with it it was showing
[1:08:42] you I'm that rock that was in the
[1:08:44] wilderness and I never left the I'm the
[1:08:47] I'm the presence that was in the tent
[1:08:49] and I never left the amen if he did it
[1:08:51] in the shadow he's going to do do it in
[1:08:54] the Perfection if he didn't leave a tent
[1:08:57] how much more will he never leave this
[1:08:59] bride because she is his Tabernacle and
[1:09:02] this tent do you see amen it was Moses
[1:09:05] that built that it was Moses built that
[1:09:07] Tabernacle and Along come David and he
[1:09:10] saw that the word of God dwelt in a tent
[1:09:14] he said oh I that my God would dwell in
[1:09:17] the tent of a man he said I'd like to
[1:09:19] have him my house of Cedar I i' I'd like
[1:09:21] to build him a house I I I'd like to
[1:09:24] make him a place on the earth that he
[1:09:26] could live Nathan the prophet heard it
[1:09:28] and said oh what a powerful desire that
[1:09:30] you have David do all that is in thine
[1:09:33] heart and later he comes and says wait a
[1:09:35] minute David you can't build this kind
[1:09:37] of house too much blood's on your hands
[1:09:40] he said but I'll take your son amen and
[1:09:43] I'll use him and I'll make a tabernacle
[1:09:46] and I'll use the son of David to build a
[1:09:48] temple here in Jerusalem that I would
[1:09:51] dwell in that Temple now when Solomon
[1:09:53] gets ready to build a tabernacle he
[1:09:55] don't go look for new plans folks amen
[1:09:58] he takes exactly what Moses had already
[1:10:01] built and brought it up and built it in
[1:10:05] that Holy place that Tabernacle he built
[1:10:08] the same thing amen but he just buil it
[1:10:10] in a different place oh God this message
[1:10:14] will work anywhere as you take it it'll
[1:10:16] build a church in Gastonia it'll build a
[1:10:19] church in blon Ohio it'll build a church
[1:10:22] in Africa in India in South America this
[1:10:26] pattern is the pattern of almighty God
[1:10:30] you don't need another pattern we don't
[1:10:32] need an organization we've got the
[1:10:34] message of the hour and oh it's the
[1:10:38] pattern of God God sets a pattern and
[1:10:41] amen we can have that
[1:10:43] pattern you know the difference in the
[1:10:45] five and foolish virgins don't you amen
[1:10:48] the five wise virgins fit in the pattern
[1:10:51] of
[1:10:52] God my my my my do you see it was
[1:10:55] Solomon that was going to build him a
[1:10:57] house amen and but Solomon himself in
[1:11:00] First Kings chapter 18 and 27 he said
[1:11:02] can God dwell on the earth what a
[1:11:05] question can God can God dwell on the
[1:11:10] earth amen I'll tell you what it was
[1:11:12] when Isaiah spoke it in Isaiah 66 it was
[1:11:15] Isaiah said thus saith the Lord for the
[1:11:18] heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot
[1:11:21] stol but where is the house that you
[1:11:24] build me and to where is the place of my
[1:11:27] rest in other words the god that created
[1:11:30] the heavens amen and has the Earth as a
[1:11:33] foot what kind of house could you build
[1:11:35] him that he would be satisfied what kind
[1:11:38] of house could a person build God that
[1:11:40] he could find rest in that house does
[1:11:43] God dwell on the earth does God dwell in
[1:11:45] houses does God dwell that way oh
[1:11:48] there's got to be a resting place
[1:11:50] there's got to be a place for God my
[1:11:54] when Jesus came upon the Earth he was
[1:11:57] the true son of David and he said I'm
[1:12:00] going to build a house he said I will
[1:12:03] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:12:06] will not Prevail against it I say this
[1:12:09] 2,000 years ago that was prophecy but
[1:12:12] this morning this afternoon it's not

[1:12:17] scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:12:20] midst Christ the mystery he said he has
[1:12:24] achieved a
[1:12:25] church that the fullness of God can come
[1:12:28] into God has built a church that there
[1:12:32] is not one word of this Bible That's not
[1:12:36] welcome on the
[1:12:37] inside Hallelujah brother you don't know
[1:12:40] what that meant people said brother
[1:12:41] Wayne what's God looking for what kind
[1:12:43] of bride is God looking for one which
[1:12:45] stays with the
[1:12:47] word he's had every kind he's had every
[1:12:50] kind of bride but he's never had that
[1:12:52] one he's never had a bride that would
[1:12:55] just stay with the word but there's
[1:12:58] coming another Eve there's coming a
[1:13:01] bride who cannot fall from this word she
[1:13:05] will
[1:13:07] stay she will stay he has achieved a
[1:13:11] church that the fullness of God might
[1:13:13] bring to pass every promised word of God

[1:13:16] days that's a big that's a big that's a
[1:13:19] big
[1:13:20] word cuz you you know I don't want to
[1:13:22] get on off track but you know you know
[1:13:25] that God created Adam out of himself
[1:13:28] that's right amen amen God created the
[1:13:32] Earth and he planted the Earth with his
[1:13:34] seed and it was his garden but God gave
[1:13:38] adam Eve to bring forth his garden but
[1:13:40] the devil got in that garden and she
[1:13:43] couldn't bring forth only Adam seed but
[1:13:46] in the end time there's another bride
[1:13:48] who has been given as a garden of God
[1:13:51] that can bring every promise
[1:13:55] Church of the Living God every promise
[1:13:58] if you say under this mountain be moved

[1:14:07] this is an hour where every promise God
[1:14:09] has made has been given to this
[1:14:12] church yes I will build a church well
[1:14:15] let me say Amen here she
[1:14:19] is can you imagine in John when Philip
[1:14:23] looked and said show us the Father and
[1:14:25] Jesus said have I been so long with you
[1:14:27] and you have not known me people today
[1:14:29] are saying where's the bride where's the
[1:14:31] bride I say have we been so long with
[1:14:34] you and you don't know who we are amen
[1:14:37] oh when you can say I and my father are
[1:14:41] one that's when the seed separates from
[1:14:43] the Shu you come out in the light of the
[1:14:46] son of man there enough heed on this
[1:14:48] message to make you identify with your
[1:14:50] former thought of you what God thought
[1:14:52] of you that was some denomination or
[1:14:55] some man-made religion thought of
[1:14:58] you a
[1:15:00] church built upon the word of God upon
[1:15:03] the doctrine of Apostles and Prophets
[1:15:06] hey it's an
[1:15:10] achievement and I say praise
[1:15:16] God they sent somebody to the moon and
[1:15:18] they're happy about it well let me tell
[1:15:20] you that ain't near the achievement as
[1:15:22] it is God to get a church that'll stay
[1:15:25] on the word of
[1:15:32] God amen amen he's achieved a church
[1:15:35] amen amen he's achieved one Amen in Acts
[1:15:40] chapter 7 it was it was Steven that
[1:15:42] preached that great sermon yes sir our
[1:15:44] fathers had the Tabernacle in the
[1:15:45] wilderness and had been pointed speaking
[1:15:47] unto Moses that he should make it
[1:15:49] according to the fashion that he had
[1:15:50] seen that's right and also our fathers
[1:15:52] that came and brought in Jesus the
[1:15:54] possession of the Gentiles whom God
[1:15:56] drove out before the face of our fathers
[1:15:58] under the days of David that's right who
[1:16:00] found favor before God and desired to
[1:16:03] find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob
[1:16:05] amen but Solomon build him a house but
[1:16:08] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[1:16:12] temples made with hands as saith the
[1:16:15] prophets that's Isaiah Heaven is my
[1:16:17] throne and Earth is my foot stol what
[1:16:19] house will you build me saith the Lord
[1:16:22] what is the place of my rest yes sir now
[1:16:25] let's pick up Paul from Hebrews chapter
[1:16:27] 10 wherefore he cometh into the world
[1:16:29] and he saith sacrifice an offering thou
[1:16:32] wouldest not but a
[1:16:35] body thou Hast prepared me now brother
[1:16:39] random does Something Beautiful in
[1:16:40] stature of the perfect man he comes
[1:16:42] along and he reads the book of Acts
[1:16:45] where Stephen is preaching to them and
[1:16:47] he says my God don't dwell in houses
[1:16:50] made with hands that's right what kind
[1:16:53] of what kind of house could you build
[1:16:55] him that he would be at peace with that
[1:16:57] he would love to be in amen that he
[1:17:00] would dwell in and he would want to be
[1:17:03] in that he would be pleased to dwell in
[1:17:06] now now the brother BR says see but in
[1:17:09] here in Hebrews chapter 10 amen it's
[1:17:12] Paul that says a body thou Hast prepared

[1:38:33] be an Everlasting Covenant with them I
[1:38:34] will place them and multiply them and
[1:38:37] set My Sanctuary in the midst of them
[1:38:40] forever more my Tabernacle also shall be
[1:38:44] with them y I will be their God and they
[1:38:48] shall be my people as God have said
[1:38:52] Paul's quoting the Old Testament
[1:38:53] prophets but he's not just quoting Old
[1:38:56] Testament prophets Paul's quoting our
[1:38:58] lord Jesus in Matthew 28:20 Jesus said
[1:39:01] teaching them to observe all things
[1:39:03] whatsoever I've commanded you lo I Am
[1:39:07] With You Always even till the end of the
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:11] [Music]
[1:39:13] world in John 14 just before he leaves
[1:39:17] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:39:19] Commandments and I will pray the father
[1:39:22] and he'll give you another comforter
[1:39:24] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:39:27] the spirit of Truth in the world cannot
[1:39:29] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:39:31] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[1:39:33] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:39:36] now Jesus said I'm going to go away and
[1:39:37] send somebody else but look what he said
[1:39:40] in the 18th verse but I will not leave
[1:39:43] you comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:39:47] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:39:50] more
[1:39:51] come on sister where you at I heard you
[1:39:53] where you at a little while and the
[1:39:55] world seeth me no more but ye shall see
[1:40:01] me but ye shall see me because oh my
[1:40:06] there's some eyes have amen the eye has
[1:40:09] been enlightened and you can see the
[1:40:12] presence of
[1:40:15] God just cuz other people don't see it
[1:40:18] don't make it
[1:40:19] real ask aaza about
[1:40:25] it and at that day what
[1:40:28] day and at that day ye shall know I in
[1:40:32] the father and ye and me and I and you
[1:40:35] now if you're a Bible reader in John 10
[1:40:37] they asked Jesus tell us plainly who it
[1:40:38] is he said I don't do the works father
[1:40:40] doeth The Works in
[1:40:41] me and I am in him and he is in me but
[1:40:45] in the 14th chapter he adds something to
[1:40:48] that and said I and him and him and me
[1:40:51] and I in you and you in
[1:40:54] me he added you he added
[1:40:58] you look at this if a man love me he
[1:41:01] will keep my words and my father will
[1:41:02] love him and I will come unto him and we
[1:41:05] will make our
[1:41:07] abold oh he
[1:41:11] abides he abides Hallelujah he abides
[1:41:15] with me what am I talking about not just
[1:41:18] a coming and going not just a service
[1:41:21] and go and service and go that's the Old
[1:41:24] Testament but in the New Testament he
[1:41:27] was talking about an Abiding
[1:41:34] Place let's cover that devil up let's
[1:41:37] put some word on that devil in Romans
[1:41:40] chapter 8 the Bible says in the ninth
[1:41:42] verse ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:41:44] spirit and if so be the spirit of God
[1:41:47] dwells in you now if any man have not
[1:41:50] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:41:53] and if the Christ be in you the body is
[1:41:55] dead because of sin but the spirit is
[1:41:57] life because of righteousness and if the
[1:41:59] spirit of him that raised Jesus from the
[1:42:02] dead dwell in you he that raised Christ
[1:42:06] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:42:08] mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth
[1:42:12] in you you of God little children and
[1:42:15] greater is
[1:42:17] he that is in you than he that is in
[1:42:21] this world you might as well go ahead
[1:42:24] and say it the one living in this house
[1:42:26] is greater than the one that's in the
[1:42:28] world it's greater than Temptation it's
[1:42:31] greater than the diseases of this age
[1:42:33] it's greater than the sicknesses of this
[1:42:35] time greater is
[1:42:39] he greater is
[1:42:42] he who's
[1:42:45] he he
[1:42:49] God I I love David's
[1:42:53] writings in Psalms 132 and 133 for the
[1:42:56] Lord hath chosen
[1:42:59] Zion he have desired it for his
[1:43:02] habitation this is my rest forever here
[1:43:05] will I dwell for I have desired
[1:43:08] it now y'all read the same message I
[1:43:12] read did brother bandam say that Zion
[1:43:15] was the
[1:43:16] bride is that what he
[1:43:18] said come on now is that what he said
[1:43:22] that Zion is the
[1:43:24] bride there was a natural City back
[1:43:27] there that David was looking at but that
[1:43:29] wasn't what God was looking
[1:43:31] at David was looking at a hill and God
[1:43:34] was looking at a people David was
[1:43:36] looking at a city God was looking at a
[1:43:40] body for the Lord hath chosen
[1:43:43] Zion you have not chosen me I chose
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:51] he desired it you know what desire

[1:44:16] phone calls you sent the text come on
[1:44:20] you paid for the meals and the dates
[1:44:22] because you had a
[1:44:24] desire and God had a
[1:44:27] desire he desired Zion as his
[1:44:33] habitation I'll show you in the New
[1:44:35] Testament in Colossians chapter 1 and 27
[1:44:38] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:44:41] riches of his glory of the mystery among
[1:44:45] the
[1:44:46] Gentiles which is Christ in you
[1:44:52] can I change it the desire of
[1:44:55] Glory the hope of glory come on it's not
[1:44:59] your hope it's God's hope it's God's
[1:45:03] desire it's God's plan it's God's
[1:45:06] anointing God made all this up before
[1:45:09] you were ever
[1:45:10] [Applause]
[1:45:14] here Christ in you the hope of
[1:45:18] glory god desired how much did he desire
[1:45:21] it brother Wayne brother brother Paul
[1:45:23] just told you here he said God took the
[1:45:26] ordinances in Colossians chapter one he
[1:45:28] said he spoiled principalities and
[1:45:30] powers and nailed them to the Cross to
[1:45:33] an open chain come on he took every
[1:45:37] ordinance that said he couldn't have a
[1:45:39] Tabernacle in Zion and he nailed it to
[1:45:41] the Cross he took everything that said
[1:45:44] he couldn't have you and he nailed it to
[1:45:46] the Cross he abolished it in his own
[1:45:49] body so that he could have what he
[1:45:54] wanted the joy that is set before him is
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:01] [Applause]
[1:46:03] you now there's a lot of things been
[1:46:06] said about you but let me say something
[1:46:08] word says about you I have desired Zion
[1:46:11] as a
[1:46:12] habitation in Ezekiel
[1:46:15] 48-35 ezekiel's just playing in a great
[1:46:17] City and he said around about it was a
[1:46:19] th men measures in the name of the city
[1:46:22] from that day shall be the Lord is
[1:46:26] there if you're a studier of scripture
[1:46:28] there's seven Redemptive names of
[1:46:30] Jehovah right Jehovah RI the great
[1:46:33] healer and Jehovah Raha that great
[1:46:35] Shepherd and amen you know Jehovah Sid
[1:46:38] can knew that great banner and there's
[1:46:41] seven Redemptive names of all the
[1:46:43] Redemption power from Eden all the way
[1:46:46] to Eden he revealed his greatness in
[1:46:48] them but one thing in this Jehovah shama
[1:46:51] is the Lord is
[1:46:53] present what good would a Healer do if
[1:46:56] he wasn't
[1:46:58] here what good is a savior if he ain't
[1:47:01] here what good is a counselor if he
[1:47:03] ain't here listen to me what good is God
[1:47:07] if he ain't here if God's somewhere Way
[1:47:11] Out J somewhere and we can't get to it
[1:47:14] what good is that kind of
[1:47:17] God but Ezekiel said the name of of this
[1:47:21] city the Lord is
[1:47:25] there what is her name the Lord is
[1:47:29] there now I remember when I first come
[1:47:31] into this message it was a big punch
[1:47:33] word he's here I remember that is any of
[1:47:36] y'all remember that back way years back
[1:47:38] when I first come in the message it's
[1:47:39] been back in the 95 everybody was back
[1:47:41] in that time they' just say he's here
[1:47:43] and half of them I don't think knew what
[1:47:45] they were talking about and half of it I
[1:47:47] don't know if I knew what they were
[1:47:48] talking about but they were saying he's
[1:47:51] here and they were taking it from a
[1:47:53] declaration brother brandham made my
[1:47:55] Ministries declare him he's here talking
[1:47:58] about Christ amen but after I got a
[1:48:00] little older in the message they cried
[1:48:01] he's here and I cried
[1:48:05] where he's here where come on don't just
[1:48:09] tell me God's here tell me where he's at

[1:48:44] City now you're not much referred to a
[1:48:47] city
[1:48:48] usually but a city is a place of
[1:48:53] habitation and in Revelation 21 and2
[1:48:56] John said I saw a holy city a New
[1:49:00] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:49:04] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:49:08] her husband brother bam said the reason
[1:49:11] it said as a bride because that's
[1:49:13] exactly what it is a bride in the
[1:49:16] Philadelphian age he said the New
[1:49:18] Jerusalem is the Bride of Jesus Jesus
[1:49:20] Christ come on Friends it is a city that
[1:49:24] has been set on a hill it's a city with
[1:49:26] the gates of the Apostles and the
[1:49:28] foundations of their prophets come on

[1:49:51] the lamb the word is there he's
[1:49:53] tabernacled there in that City it's his
[1:49:56] habitation now watch amen the Bible said

[1:55:01] realm sure body to body hand to hand and
[1:55:05] watch God went to that part of it and
[1:55:08] look at all that was there look at
[1:55:10] everything was left there but watch that

[1:55:18] and he starts dealing with men Spirits
[1:55:20] amen amen amen see it was it was it was
[1:55:23] it was coming in now that's exactly
[1:55:25] right now you said preacher what what do
[1:55:27] you let's just take
[1:55:29] it when Moses come off of the mountain
[1:55:34] the second time he was wearing a veil
[1:55:37] y'all know why right because he had
[1:55:40] become
[1:55:42] God because God's word was in him so he
[1:55:46] had to Veil his face until he spoke
[1:55:49] spoke those
[1:55:50] words and the words spoken from his
[1:55:53] mouth were put on pages and those words
[1:55:57] were put behind the innermost part of
[1:56:00] the
[1:56:01] veil and when that word was back there
[1:56:04] Moses was Moses
[1:56:06] again and God was in behind the veil
[1:56:09] with his
[1:56:10] word and the pillar of fire was over
[1:56:13] that word come on the prophet of God
[1:56:15] said in the last days there would be a
[1:56:17] spirit spoken word
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:22] and in the and when the hand was being
[1:56:24] took the spirit spoken word was going to
[1:56:27] the Flesh of mankind and and and it was
[1:56:30] a powerful time but look at how far it
[1:56:36] went it come into the it come into the
[1:56:38] spirit realm me and my wife was in and
[1:56:41] up there in Gatlinburg back my 7 May 10
[1:56:43] years ago we was up there we sitting
[1:56:45] there in a in a little eye shrink a
[1:56:47] bunch of kids were playing and there was
[1:56:48] a lady sitting there there now in all uh
[1:56:51] respect she didn't look like a Christian
[1:56:53] she just didn't she just she looked just
[1:56:55] like the world you couldn't toally
[1:56:56] different she little older lady and
[1:56:58] she's sitting there talking to my wife
[1:56:59] and she's seeing the difference in my
[1:57:00] wife she said wh what do y'all believe
[1:57:03] and and and just just to cut the chase
[1:57:06] she just said well we follow the message
[1:57:07] of brother brandham and that lady said
[1:57:10] oh Willam brandham my wife said yeah she
[1:57:13] said well I know his ministry I was in
[1:57:15] his meetings in
[1:57:17] Mississippi she said I I think it was
[1:57:19] throat cancer and I was about to die as
[1:57:22] a kid and that man called my name and
[1:57:25] rebuked that cancer and I was completely
[1:57:28] healed but see how far it
[1:57:33] went it went to the spirit
[1:57:35] real and it healed her body she said my
[1:57:39] son is a Full Gospel preacher right now
[1:57:41] she said I was also in his meetings in
[1:57:44] Oregon when that when that man was made
[1:57:47] lay across his feet she said I was in

[1:57:52] Tommy Osburn speaks about them she said
[1:57:53] I was there in them meetings she saw it
[1:57:57] she saw the Messiah sign but it never
[1:58:00] went past the
[1:58:03] Spirit come on Pentecost failed because
[1:58:07] the message didn't get past the spirit
[1:58:11] realm the prophet of God said they had
[1:58:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:58:16] can have it every day of your life and
[1:58:18] go to hell
[1:58:21] because it only gets as far as your
[1:58:23] spirit but God was not wanting to dwell
[1:58:27] in your spirit he wants to dwell in the
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:35] soul there's three Realms there's Body
[1:58:38] Soul and

[1:59:52] that word all the way back and when it
[1:59:54] was carried into the inner Veil Moses's
[1:59:57] job was over and that's why when brother

[2:00:02] of the bride of Christ his message was
[2:00:05] over the third pull is to the soul of
[2:00:08] the bride of Christ and people today

[2:00:44] that as far as it got did it just get to
[2:00:47] the Bible did it just get to the book
[2:00:49] but the Bible said for the Lord himself
[2:00:51] shall descend from heaven with a shout

[2:17:21] God wanted to dwell amen amen in the
[2:17:25] Book of Revelation chapter
[2:17:27] 21 verse 9 the Bible says and they came
[2:17:31] unto me one of the Seven Angels which
[2:17:34] had the seven vows full of the seven
[2:17:37] last plag plague and talked to me saying
[2:17:41] come hether I will show Thee the bride
[2:17:45] the Lamb's wife the Lamb's wife
[2:17:48] so we expect to see a woman amen verse
[2:17:51] 10 and he Carry Me Away in the spirit to
[2:17:55] a great and high mountain and show me
[2:17:58] that great
[2:18:02] city right from the Bible the Lamb's
[2:18:06] wife the Bride is a city amen it's right
[2:18:10] here it is that save the Lord You Are
[2:18:14] God great City and the Lord is in you
[2:18:17] amen crusting you the hope of glory he
[2:18:21] was preached last Wednesday he was not
[2:18:23] here and God is coming and getting
[2:18:25] everything in the Tabernacle that you
[2:18:28] have been taught for month here and God
[2:18:31] put it all together and line everything
[2:18:34] up to prove to you that it's Jesus
[2:18:37] Christ in you the same yesterday today
[2:18:41] and forever you are not a nobody you are
[2:18:45] somebody you are God's wife
[2:18:48] you are the wife of the Lamb amen amen
[2:18:52] amen amen if that devil is bothering you
[2:18:55] take him deep into the Tabernacle all
[2:18:57] right if that snake is playing around
[2:18:59] with you catch him take him to the
[2:19:02] height the more you go up with him he
[2:19:04] will get into a place he can't breathe
[2:19:07] because only ego stay there and choke
[2:19:10] him over there and there he won't do
[2:19:13] anything he's powerless amen just like
[2:19:16] the dog pull him on to the ground amen
[2:19:20] where he cannot stand I usually tell
[2:19:23] people when I talk to them if they're
[2:19:25] not message believer I just tell them I
[2:19:27] say Do you believe the Bible they say
[2:19:29] yes I say okay if we start talking
[2:19:31] whatever you say need to come from the
[2:19:33] Bible that's exactly and whatever I say
[2:19:35] need to come from the Bible if they only
[2:19:38] agree to that they no longer on the
[2:19:41] carpet if they just put their two feet
[2:19:44] in the scripture that's it because the
[2:19:47] message of the hour is perfectly in line
[2:19:50] with the scpt once they put their their
[2:19:53] two feet on the Bible there is nowhere
[2:19:56] they can play around with me I would
[2:19:58] take them left and right and left and
[2:20:00] right and finally they turn around they
[2:20:02] say where did you study the Bible like
[2:20:04] this right in the University of Malachi
[2:20:09] 4 hallelujah amen so take the devil from
[2:20:14] off that ground and put him deep into it
[2:20:16] exactly right how do I know I am deep
[2:20:19] into it look at your life if you
[2:20:22] struggle with something let it go
[2:20:24] because that thing can block you from
[2:20:26] accessing into the in Let It Go and keep
[2:20:29] moving because that's where the Shana
[2:20:32] glories where the word is that's where
