[10:07] something or listen to music and
[10:09] and uh our phone never works and church

[10:28] make a way and allow this video to play
[10:30] so that me and destiny can be in service
[10:32] and and hear brother polycarp on on
[10:34] wednesday and from that moment on it

[33:53] god bless you brother benjamin good to
[33:55] see you
[33:56] true soldier amen
[33:59] blessed be the name of the lord i
[34:01] believe everybody got a message about
[34:02] sister gene
[34:04] by make his wife she departed to be with
[34:08] the lord
[34:09] she was such a precious precious
[34:11] precious sister and i have no doubt
[34:16] that she is right there in the sixth
[34:18] dimension amen
[34:21] hallelujah
[34:24] i know what a caliber of a woman she was
[34:28] if you spend time around here she was
[34:30] centered in the word
[34:32] right there into the word a very great
[34:35] support to the family
[34:37] and to her husband
[34:39] but he
[34:40] kept the decision came from the lord
[34:43] that it was time for her to go home amen
[34:46] and we have been working a little bit
[34:48] hard on it by god's grace talking to the
[34:51] family back home
[34:53] and also talking with the family here we
[34:55] appreciate all the sisters and
[34:57] everything that the church is doing as
[34:58] far as
[35:00] visiting them making phone calls and
[35:02] bringing the food there we really really
[35:05] appreciate because it makes things a
[35:07] whole lot easier for them amen
[35:10] so based on
[35:12] what i've discussed with the family it
[35:15] looks like the sister wanted to
[35:19] go to her family
[35:21] back home
[35:22] and to be buried there
[35:25] so we want to honor that
[35:27] because that was the desire of her heart
[35:31] and i'm working with butter mickey and
[35:33] lords willing tonight we'll be talking
[35:34] to the children as well to kind of put
[35:37] everything together and know
[35:40] uh how they're gonna go and everything
[35:42] so you stay tight on your
[35:45] text messages we will communicate you
[35:48] what is going on so the funeral will
[35:50] take
[35:51] place overseas over there our sister
[35:55] will be buried there the family will be
[35:57] going there
[35:58] not quite sure about all the detail at
[36:00] this time but lord's willing right after
[36:02] service i'm going to meet with them and
[36:04] talk and put everything together and do
[36:06] what we can to just kind of make things
[36:08] a little bit easier for them so
[36:10] if someone want to give something as a
[36:12] contribution to the family i spoke to uh
[36:17] the deacon what we were thinking was
[36:19] that on sunday lord's willing we can
[36:22] take a love offering so that kind of
[36:24] gives you an opportunity as everybody
[36:26] that is part of the church they want to
[36:28] give something they can give it we can
[36:30] put it together but probably by that
[36:32] time the brother will be already
[36:34] gone with uh
[36:36] i don't know if everybody in the family
[36:38] or part of the family we figured out
[36:40] everything tonight so
[36:42] when he comes back eventually we will do
[36:44] a little something just to make sure as
[36:47] a little memorial
[36:48] uh
[36:49] meeting together gathering together for
[36:51] the family and just uh to welcome them
[36:54] back again in the spirit of love comfort
[36:58] and support by god's grace amen so they
[37:01] need a lot of prayer it has been hard on
[37:04] the children hard on their family and
[37:06] hard on the church so we need a lot of
[37:09] prayer a lot of support from one another
[37:11] but by god's grace the main thing
[37:14] remember god will never take you out of
[37:17] this world
[37:18] if he have not finished with you
[37:21] and if a christian dies the bible say
[37:24] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[37:27] death of the sand i don't know why we
[37:29] were going through those chains of first
[37:31] death second death but i believe a nafta
[37:33] word has been given and given to the
[37:36] church that you can draw strength from
[37:38] it
[37:39] knowing that we have a true sister she's
[37:42] not lost actually we are the one
[37:44] that need to make sure we are prepared
[37:47] so we can meet our sister she already
[37:49] made it she already finished her course
[37:51] she's in a better place she's not
[37:54] struggling with a heart situation
[37:56] anymore now she's in her theophany so if
[37:59] you see here
[38:01] all i know
[38:02] i can tell you before even you see her
[38:04] you're going to see her young
[38:06] amen
[38:07] so you better maybe search for a certain
[38:09] picture when she was younger because
[38:10] that's the way we're going to meet here
[38:13] a beautiful young lady and we're going
[38:15] to be together forever amen so continue
[38:19] to pray for the family once i get
[38:21] everything finalized tonight then we
[38:23] will send you a text you do what you can
[38:25] on sunday and then as a pastor
[38:28] we will do what we can for the family to
[38:30] make things better for them because we
[38:33] are family this church is a family and
[38:36] we stay really really really tight
[38:38] especially when things comes like that
[38:40] to make sure we really really can
[38:42] express that love because they need that
[38:44] love from us and that support and our
[38:46] prayer amen
[38:48] so stay strong spoken word tabernacle
[38:51] one soldier lays to fight the battle but
[38:54] on the other side one more
[38:56] amen
[38:57] so praise be the name of the lord we got
[38:59] brother kelly tonight we thank
[39:02] the lord for having brothers that can
[39:04] step in like this when i got a really
[39:07] really really busy tight schedule and he
[39:09] was there handy to help so we want to
[39:12] hear from the lord and we're going to
[39:14] call brother kelly and from there on
[39:16] stay tight i know does uh mention about
[39:18] the baby shower
[39:20] somehow by the grace of god they might
[39:22] be living
[39:24] right on saturday if everything works
[39:26] fine but
[39:28] if they didn't leave on saturday just
[39:32] stay tight we might have to send you a
[39:34] text about the baby shower and make a
[39:36] little change because we need to give
[39:39] more
[39:40] time to the family and make sure they
[39:42] got enough comfort then the baby shower
[39:45] can be moved up but if everything works
[39:47] fine and we get all we need for the
[39:50] family and the children and the ready to
[39:52] move on then the baby shower is still
[39:56] maintained so you might have couple
[39:58] texts and things telling you about it
[40:00] just stay alert so we make sure now that
[40:02] nobody's uh missed and make sure you
[40:05] read your text

[43:14] and you know we don't we won't prolong
[43:16] the time
[43:17] let's turn to first corinthians
[43:20] and verse 12 in
[43:23] on chapter 12 and verse 13 i was looking
[43:27] i didn't have much time to look at this
[43:29] but uh i wanted to look at another
[43:31] thought there um
[43:33] but this kept pressing on my heart so i
[43:35] better follow the leadership un under
[43:38] the lord and uh so once you have your
[43:41] bibles and you're at the scriptures say
[43:43] amen
[43:45] first corinthians 12 and verse 13
[43:48] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[43:50] into one body
[43:52] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[43:55] we be bond or free and have been all
[43:58] made to drink into one spirit
[44:01] he says for the body is not one member
[44:04] but many may the lord had a blessing to
[44:06] the reading of his word you may be
[44:07] seated
[44:09] you know it was a thought it was uh
[44:12] yes it came to me i was just there
[44:14] meditating on the
[44:16] thought and
[44:17] what i was looking at it was why
[44:20] are people so tossed about
[44:22] amen
[44:24] and i looked at that message it was
[44:25] really pressing on me because you look
[44:27] at this day and time god bless you
[44:29] brother you're right at this day and
[44:31] time we
[44:32] looking around and we know that the
[44:34] rapture is about to take place
[44:37] soon and you can see by the times and
[44:39] the prophecies and things are being
[44:41] fulfilled
[44:42] but you know it was three points that
[44:44] brother branham brought out in this
[44:46] message
[44:47] and he was three points he would work
[44:49] with i may not get to all of them i'll
[44:51] do my best by the grace of god we know
[44:53] that it's a wednesday night and children
[44:56] are in school and we won't plan to keep
[44:58] you too long by by the grace of god
[45:01] but it's why
[45:02] the christians are so tossed about
[45:06] and when you look around
[45:09] and when you look at when you look
[45:10] around and you see the conditions and
[45:13] of the world and and the times we're
[45:15] supposed to be moving forward and
[45:17] growing is that right
[45:19] i know it's only our hearts are heavy
[45:21] but we're going to do our best and and
[45:23] and move with the lord so i want to read
[45:26] some things before we get into the
[45:27] scriptures and y'all be praying with us
[45:30] he says the the the christians rest in
[45:33] in that hope upon the stormy sea
[45:35] anything that happens
[45:37] there will be sure storms rise up
[45:41] he said all kinds of troubles is going
[45:43] to come we know i like one of the
[45:45] brothers says that that's essential is
[45:48] that right we can't get around that
[45:51] is that right but we have a comforter is
[45:53] that right greater is he that is in need
[45:55] and he that is in the world
[45:57] he says in all trouble but we but we're
[46:00] anchored see that's all
[46:03] it'll never sink it can't sink is that
[46:06] right
[46:07] he says now he says he said i've noticed
[46:10] many christians in my life to be up and
[46:12] down
[46:15] are we going to head home tonight now
[46:17] we're going to look around in there
[46:18] because we're bringing you closer to to
[46:20] god is that right because i noticed that
[46:23] christians are up and down i'm not going
[46:25] to cut it i'm not going to sugarcoat it
[46:27] so those that stubborn and study this
[46:29] message here
[46:30] and in this specific topic you know
[46:32] where the prophet was going right
[46:34] he says now and then look i want to read
[46:36] this said a true born again christian
[46:39] can rest his faith or her faith upon the
[46:43] unmovable word of god
[46:45] we know we got an un infallible word of
[46:48] god is that right
[46:50] it cannot error we can put everything on
[46:53] it that we have we're living on it
[46:55] because we're putting our life on it is
[46:57] that right what god has said is that
[47:00] right and let no man put us under this
[47:03] word he said now nothing else a
[47:06] christian faith is based solely upon
[47:09] what rest is that right this is a rest
[47:12] this is a finished work is that right
[47:15] we're supposed to be enjoying this life
[47:18] our next step is what heaven is that
[47:20] right
[47:21] so we are knowing this hour here now all
[47:24] your messengers pointed to what it
[47:26] pointed to the messiah coming
[47:29] they pointed to the messiah coming and
[47:31] they also talked about the atonement is
[47:33] that right
[47:34] everyone talked about the blood that was
[47:36] shed for you each and every one of us
[47:39] god's precious blood came down for you
[47:42] and i he couldn't see anyone else not an
[47:44] angel and come god came himself because
[47:48] we are kin-focused that right it was all
[47:51] about the blood
[47:53] he said now look he said i've noticed
[47:55] many christians in my life to be up and
[47:57] down he said i wondered about that so
[48:00] you know it must have been heavy on his
[48:02] heart so the lord had to give him an
[48:04] answer
[48:05] he says and and
[48:06] and without preaching such a text as as
[48:10] this
[48:11] he says i thought the best to deliver to
[48:14] my to to my people here first
[48:16] and see before i go out anywhere i
[48:19] wanted to bring it here i mean that's
[48:21] why the god put it on my heart
[48:23] because we are not at this time supposed
[48:26] to be up and down is that right
[48:28] no no the holy ghost is positive the
[48:32] holy ghost come was sent in is our way
[48:35] here so that we can finish the
[48:37] redemptive work is that right so we can
[48:40] become one with god in his hour here now
[48:44] and god wanted us to be one with him as
[48:47] it was in the beginning
[48:49] so he's giving us the power and prayer
[48:52] he's giving us back the authority that
[48:54] we once had is that right so what so
[48:57] we're gonna look at this spoken word now
[49:00] before now in this time in this age here
[49:03] we thank god for the prayer line we
[49:06] thank god for those things is that right
[49:08] but god is moving us into move upon the
[49:12] absolute is that right
[49:15] so we don't want to get ahead of
[49:17] ourselves but we wanted to see because
[49:18] there's three major points he worked in
[49:20] it and he was trying to bring out to the
[49:23] saints where the enemy was tricking the
[49:26] people at is that right
[49:28] so look you heard the pastor work in
[49:30] that area and constantly working and he
[49:33] was showing us about the justification
[49:35] last time i was here and the last time
[49:37] we were talking about the true origin
[49:40] the origin of a true witness is that
[49:42] right you come from god you go back to
[49:45] god we're moving it to the spoken word
[49:47] now but he's building a character in
[49:50] each and every one of us so we'll be
[49:52] able to handle this spoken word
[49:55] let's see what he said he says now you
[49:57] find them people
[49:59] who seem to be very religious
[50:02] seem to have such a deep desire
[50:05] and daily they search and hunt and seek
[50:08] for god
[50:09] and never come to any settlement of any
[50:13] kind to where they could be settled or
[50:15] anchored in christ
[50:17] he says and this i have learned to be
[50:20] in inexperience he says and this i have
[50:24] learned to inexperience
[50:27] that it is the people of intellect
[50:30] okay
[50:31] so he's talking about he's digging deep
[50:33] is that right
[50:35] he's now we're coming talking about
[50:36] that's what this message is bringing us
[50:39] into right he's not everything that he's
[50:42] exposing now is to bring you closer to
[50:45] the character of christ anything that's
[50:47] in you he says every one of us know the
[50:50] wickedness and the bitterness of our own
[50:52] heart is that right we know what we
[50:55] struggle with
[50:56] so the first point here dressing is
[50:59] intellect is that right
[51:01] that's a terrible thing reasoning
[51:03] because you're not moving no dental no
[51:06] devil out the way he said believe from
[51:08] the heart the prophet of god i'll do my
[51:11] best brother to keep still okay
[51:14] and and who's ever uh interpreting i'll
[51:17] try help me lord he said now look he
[51:20] said now he says he says you're never
[51:23] going to get
[51:24] any supernatural movement on if you're
[51:28] trying to mix intellect with the
[51:29] supernatural
[51:32] you see i wanted to preach that message
[51:34] tonight was why christ speak brother
[51:37] great that thing was pressing on me let
[51:39] me the lord give me grace another time
[51:41] but we want to dig deep we want you to
[51:43] understand this intellectual demon is
[51:46] with these religious demons is what we
[51:49] have now so people get cold and starchy
[51:52] and they sit there and they believe they
[51:55] have some but there's only an
[51:56] intellectual conception of the word
[52:00] you should be performing a supernatural
[52:02] in your own home teaching your children
[52:05] how to cast out them teaching your
[52:08] children about prayer warren teaching
[52:10] your children about offensive prayer
[52:13] this is we wrestle not against flesh and
[52:15] blood but against principalities and
[52:17] powers and wickedness and rulers in high
[52:19] places an intellectual devil see if you
[52:23] get up in here the last time we was here
[52:25] we were telling you about in ii
[52:27] chronicles 20. i wasn't picking on
[52:30] anyone or saying about coming up here
[52:32] i'm just saying i know you have to be
[52:34] prayed up and you have to be anointed
[52:37] because satan is going to try you he's
[52:39] going to try me he's going to try
[52:41] everyone but you have to understand
[52:44] under the anointing is the right
[52:46] anointing the anointing only comes from
[52:49] god god demonstrates that he backs up
[52:52] what you're doing is that right so when
[52:55] you sing a song you're singing a song to
[52:58] jesus you singing a song to glorify god
[53:02] you singing a song to prepare a way for
[53:05] the preacher you singing a song so we
[53:08] can drive the demons out through the
[53:10] worship service we're singing the song
[53:13] all the blood
[53:15] all the blood
[53:16] the blood has signed my name
[53:25] so yeah that's why i said we rejoiced
[53:27] there yesterday we were singing those
[53:29] songs we had a good time singing it to
[53:32] the glory of god
[53:34] we seen our precious brother
[53:36] benjamin just light up there is that
[53:38] right the lord touched his spirit is
[53:40] that right comfort
[53:42] the word of god
[53:44] he says intellect he said now speaking
[53:47] this there's two
[53:49] different two different of christians
[53:52] seems strange seems strange
[53:55] but i will not say to to two types
[53:58] he said i say two different phases
[54:02] would be a better word to use
[54:05] he said two phases the same christianity
[54:08] but two phases of it
[54:11] he says and one of them is an
[54:13] intellectual
[54:14] or a mental conception of this message
[54:18] see you have to understand
[54:20] if you lack it on your prayer life satan
[54:23] is going to get you he's going to catch
[54:26] you
[54:27] and you're going to respond the wrong
[54:29] way
[54:30] because you have not been anointed god
[54:32] prayed up
[54:34] and got with the father and prepared
[54:36] yourself for the battle is that right
[54:39] so you have to get into the spirit the
[54:42] prophet of god said get you got to get
[54:44] in the spirit well you won't receive
[54:47] anything is that right so we're talking
[54:49] about an intellectual christian and a
[54:52] mental christian versus a spiritual
[54:55] christian we're talking about some let
[54:58] me let me keep on reading i want you to
[55:01] catch and i want to take my time we're
[55:02] going to lay it solid because these
[55:05] things that you're not doing when you go
[55:08] in in a war in the battle okay you're
[55:11] not going to be prepared for it that's
[55:13] why he said put on what the whole armor
[55:16] of god
[55:17] so you may be able to withstand the
[55:19] wilds and the tricky of the devil in the
[55:22] end time is that right
[55:24] so we always praying for those that are
[55:27] on the essential jobs now it's not like
[55:30] kovic is not out there but if you ready
[55:33] for it and you fake out the faith it
[55:35] cannot harm you is that right we're
[55:38] going to get there about you are
[55:39] speaking the word is that right we're
[55:42] not going to go we're not going to
[55:44] accept anything because we got a promise
[55:46] no diseases no the sickness nothing can
[55:49] come upon god's children is that right
[55:52] we speak the word by faith is that right
[55:55] he comes down and he anoints the word
[55:57] that comes out of our mouth
[56:00] hallelujah
[56:02] he said in the middle of what god has
[56:05] said in his word
[56:06] he said now
[56:08] he says and he
[56:09] said in his word of jesus christ by the
[56:12] way of knowledge he said now look he
[56:14] says and others is experiencing
[56:17] experimental experience
[56:19] that god has given the man word in his
[56:23] heart that's right brother see
[56:26] now this man has had an experience in
[56:29] his heart
[56:30] his heart has been turned to god he has
[56:33] been born again of the spirit and of the
[56:36] water that's why he sent malachi 4 to
[56:38] turn to what the hearts of the children
[56:42] write back to the fathers is that right
[56:44] the original apostolic teaching
[56:47] that was in that time now it is supposed
[56:50] to be another book of acts written again
[56:53] is that right
[56:54] now in this time that we're living in so
[56:57] now we're talking about not just the
[56:59] intellectual conception
[57:01] hallelujah that's right brother he said
[57:04] now look
[57:05] he says and other is an experience that
[57:08] god has given them in their heart the
[57:10] one intellectual is hungering
[57:12] see he is feasting on god
[57:15] he said but his feet his feast doesn't
[57:18] hold
[57:19] huh
[57:20] we're gonna get into something okay but
[57:22] it doesn't hold them let's go okay for
[57:25] some reason you're coming here you're
[57:27] enjoying the mysteries
[57:29] you're enjoying the deep teachings
[57:32] you're enjoying the hidden things that's
[57:34] in the scriptures but when you go out
[57:36] that door how many can you talk to
[57:39] someone about it
[57:41] how can you can you talk to someone what
[57:44] god has given you can you tell somebody
[57:47] by revelation that you come from god
[57:50] that you was in the mind of god that you
[57:53] were the eternal god that you were the
[57:56] seed of god that you're looking for the
[57:58] rapture to get back to god any day is
[58:02] that right he said pray and watch for
[58:04] the coming of the lord
[58:07] it won't be far it's a joyous hour now
[58:10] we tell them about jesus get yourself
[58:13] lined up because what he has done for
[58:15] you on calvary
[58:23] we taking back what's ours
[58:26] hubble's lord
[58:28] he said now now look see they're hungry
[58:31] they're out there looking for something
[58:34] but they're looking for god
[58:36] okay and we got the goods
[58:39] god gave us the goods
[58:41] we know that every human being is hungry
[58:44] and thirsting moaning and groaning for
[58:47] the manifestation of the sons and the
[58:49] daughters of god is that right
[58:53] we're not out there reasoning
[58:55] we're standing with earnestly contending
[58:58] for the faith that was once delivered
[59:00] unto the saints he has preserved we have
[59:03] been preserved
[59:04] by the preserver you have been anointed
[59:07] by god you have been called by god you
[59:10] have been appointed by god this is a
[59:12] real war but you know what we got the
[59:15] victory is that right we got the perfect
[59:18] paper is that right brother branham said
[59:20] a man that got perfect faith he has
[59:22] every situation under control
[59:28] [Applause]
[59:32] look what he says
[59:34] he says now
[59:35] he says one intellectual hungry he said
[59:39] he's feasting on god but his feasts
[59:41] don't hold the other one seems to have
[59:43] victory all the time there's nothing but
[59:48] there's nothing bothering them
[59:50] huh
[59:51] there's nothing bothering them
[59:56] because we got a promise is that right
[59:59] god jesus said you've never seen the
[1:00:02] righteous forsaken for his she's begging
[1:00:04] for bread i never wanting for nothing is
[1:00:07] that right i'm enjoying jehovah gyra i
[1:00:10] provide all of your needs
[1:00:22] the other ones seem to have the victory
[1:00:24] all the time nothing bothers them
[1:00:26] they're just as solid and anchored as
[1:00:29] they can be he said no trials no storms
[1:00:33] bother them at all he says but they seem
[1:00:36] to have something about them he says
[1:00:39] that that people who are christians and
[1:00:43] are trying to live for god admire that
[1:00:46] type of christian
[1:00:48] huh
[1:00:50] now what about the young rich ruler
[1:00:53] he admired jesus huh
[1:00:56] he recognized jesus had something that
[1:00:59] he didn't have is that right
[1:01:02] he looked upon him and he knew that
[1:01:05] everything jesus did he prospers is that
[1:01:08] right but it was one thing the wrong
[1:01:11] young rich ruler was lacking when he
[1:01:14] looked at jesus he saw a character
[1:01:17] brother brown said he had a character
[1:01:19] that he didn't have he wanted eternal
[1:01:22] life is that right he saw what this
[1:01:24] brother jesus was doing and he ran and
[1:01:27] he fell on his knees and said what what
[1:01:30] must i do to inherit eternal life is

[1:09:32] sweeter you get humble yourself you
[1:09:35] humble yourself
[1:09:42] why are we tossed
[1:09:45] he couldn't understand why well we got
[1:09:48] all the benefits
[1:09:50] huh we are the father of a king is that
[1:09:53] right the king
[1:09:55] remember the slave that came from africa
[1:09:58] and he got around in there and it was
[1:10:00] something about that slave is that right
[1:10:02] when you go on your job there's
[1:10:04] something about a christian when they
[1:10:06] see you on that job huh
[1:10:09] they got around in there what's the
[1:10:12] difference huh with that slave over
[1:10:14] there do you eat different no
[1:10:17] that's different no
[1:10:19] he's sleeping no
[1:10:21] he he stayed right there in the gallery
[1:10:23] with the other slave he said but what's
[1:10:25] the difference about him he says you see
[1:10:28] over in africa
[1:10:30] see his father was a king
[1:10:33] so he was raised up no other way is that
[1:10:36] right you are being raised up no other
[1:10:39] way but by the king
[1:10:42] it's a character that's inside of you
[1:10:44] that's gonna be produced uh we may not
[1:10:47] appear like we're nothing now but we're
[1:10:50] gonna be just like him when he comes
[1:11:00] job said i come in this world with
[1:11:02] nothing i leave this world with nothing
[1:11:04] but job was talking about natural things
[1:11:07] huh
[1:11:10] can we leaving here with his character
[1:11:12] is that right
[1:11:14] i know i'm going in the rapture is that
[1:11:17] right i'm looking for the rapture i'm
[1:11:20] looking for that day to come
[1:11:23] hallelujah
[1:11:25] glory be to god
[1:11:27] why are they tossed
[1:11:30] he says the other one seems to be so
[1:11:32] victory
[1:11:33] they just as solid and anchored as they
[1:11:36] can be
[1:11:37] no trials
[1:11:39] no storms
[1:11:41] bothers them at all
[1:11:43] but they seem to have something about
[1:11:45] them
[1:11:46] is that right he says and i often wonder
[1:11:49] lord
[1:11:50] what is it that these people have that
[1:11:53] others crave so much for
[1:11:56] and yet seem to fail to get it
[1:11:59] see what you got
[1:12:01] huh
[1:12:02] see what you got
[1:12:05] well you got every opportunity now
[1:12:09] when god gives you to tell someone about
[1:12:12] jesus
[1:12:13] to tell them about the goodness of this
[1:12:15] life
[1:12:17] telling them what the lord have done for
[1:12:19] us and doing for us
[1:12:21] thanking the lord for what he's done
[1:12:24] looking for things to come
[1:12:26] but don't miss what he's doing for us
[1:12:28] right now
[1:12:30] the time that we got in here and the way
[1:12:33] that we got in here it was a
[1:12:36] supernatural way if you humble yourself
[1:12:39] and put your mind and take on the mind
[1:12:42] of christ
[1:12:44] and don't don't think like you men but
[1:12:46] you think like god
[1:12:48] it was a pressure put on
[1:12:51] but god knew that he was go that we had
[1:12:54] to move forward and god made a way is
[1:12:57] that right
[1:12:58] god made a way for his precious children
[1:13:01] never leave you or forsake you
[1:13:03] he said now look
[1:13:05] he said they crave him for it i know
[1:13:07] that's a great a great question in all
[1:13:10] of our hearts who have served christ he
[1:13:13] said i've never seen a person yet
[1:13:16] that ever once come to him
[1:13:19] life never seemed right to them anymore
[1:13:23] if they ever left christ if you come to
[1:13:26] christ
[1:13:27] and you turn around and you leave it
[1:13:31] you will find yourself being worse off
[1:13:34] you will become worse off
[1:13:37] when you come into the presence of the
[1:13:39] lord here i don't want to get it i don't
[1:13:40] want to get ahead of myself
[1:13:42] because i want you to look and i want
[1:13:43] you to see this
[1:13:45] and when they come in here why things
[1:13:47] happen why they are tossed first of all
[1:13:50] some is just have an intellectual
[1:13:52] conception of this message which is not
[1:13:55] an intellectual conception that's why so
[1:13:58] many walked away so many through fiery
[1:14:01] darts is that right when you sign
[1:14:03] someone that truly truly got the baptism
[1:14:05] of the holy ghost they're praying for
[1:14:08] their brother they're loving their
[1:14:09] brother is that right they're moving
[1:14:12] forward in a positive way
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:16] he said now look
[1:14:19] he said the person
[1:14:21] help me lord he said but now
[1:14:23] he says see people are hungry
[1:14:26] but
[1:14:27] they haven't been taught right that's
[1:14:29] exactly right
[1:14:30] that's exactly right
[1:14:32] we got to understand
[1:14:35] because you cannot have the the former
[1:14:38] rain and the
[1:14:39] latter rain you got to be both of them
[1:14:41] before the mechanic for the dynamics can
[1:14:44] come forth
[1:14:46] is that right so now so many of them
[1:14:49] you'll be surprised
[1:14:51] that is the famine
[1:14:53] of hearing the word of god in the land
[1:14:56] right now
[1:14:58] you are blessed to be able to sit here
[1:15:01] for an hour and 30 minutes that's right
[1:15:03] brother you are blessed to be able to
[1:15:05] sit here for an hour and 30 minutes and
[1:15:08] get the word of god is that right
[1:15:11] it's a change taking place
[1:15:14] inside of you
[1:15:15] see you'll find out later on when the
[1:15:19] pressure come
[1:15:20] you're going to find out the goods that
[1:15:22] you have inside of me is that right
[1:15:27] thank you lord
[1:15:29] he says now
[1:15:31] he says now to see this hunger for
[1:15:33] people and yet not able to reach it
[1:15:36] he says many many of our teachers in
[1:15:39] schools have brought in much theology of
[1:15:42] telling the people
[1:15:44] he said now this is not prophet now he
[1:15:46] says well it's because you did he's
[1:15:49] saying because you didn't shout because
[1:15:50] you didn't speak in tongues because it
[1:15:52] is but together we find these people
[1:15:55] when they do shout or speak in tongues
[1:15:57] some other emotions they still don't
[1:16:00] seem to be the person that they should
[1:16:04] be you're getting somewhere isn't that
[1:16:06] what the pentecostals did
[1:16:08] is that right
[1:16:10] god did it had it
[1:16:11] method to say you shout you got it
[1:16:14] pentecost who said you speak in tongues
[1:16:15] you got it
[1:16:16] now she see we got the full goods things
[1:16:19] is that right there's something down
[1:16:22] inside of you if you want to show
[1:16:24] when when where's that angelo we said
[1:16:26] you you command your hands to praise the
[1:16:29] lord
[1:16:31] sometimes this body be down
[1:16:33] and his body just be down and i'll be
[1:16:35] tired and when i hit that door brother
[1:16:38] steve i said lord
[1:16:40] i want these feet to dance for you
[1:16:43] tonight it's not a show lord only you
[1:16:46] can move his feet only you can move his
[1:16:49] hands only you can but it's for your
[1:16:52] honor it's for your glory it's for your
[1:16:54] praises lord i need you to strengthen
[1:16:57] his body tonight and he'll do it for you
[1:17:06] lord i feel your people as heavy tonight
[1:17:09] i need a song lord on my heart to
[1:17:12] glorify you father when i sing this song
[1:17:16] lord let it be anointed to drive the
[1:17:19] demons away let it comfort someone when
[1:17:22] they came in the door because they
[1:17:24] entering your gates with thanksgiving
[1:17:26] and praise his father
[1:17:31] we're talking about serving our god
[1:17:34] he said now look
[1:17:36] hallelujah
[1:17:38] he says so find it so simple in the word
[1:17:41] of god
[1:17:42] we try to explain it and in order now to
[1:17:46] do this
[1:17:47] after seeing the intellectual part of
[1:17:49] the mind and the soul
[1:17:51] which is in the heart he says now
[1:17:54] you truly have two different mental
[1:17:56] faculties
[1:17:58] you have one them that's in your head
[1:18:03] by your brain and the other one operates
[1:18:05] in your heart
[1:18:08] that's why god come to work on your
[1:18:10] heart
[1:18:12] is that right
[1:18:14] that's why when you come in and i was
[1:18:16] saying you sing and you sing those songs
[1:18:18] to the glory of god
[1:18:20] you're anointed and you pray
[1:18:22] now you can drive those demon forces
[1:18:25] away
[1:18:28] is that what it is
[1:18:31] because god is pleased
[1:18:34] he anoints that song
[1:18:36] it shakes the foundation of the devil
[1:18:40] someone rejoices
[1:18:42] someone cries someone praised the lord
[1:18:45] because they got delivered in the
[1:18:47] worship service
[1:18:49] god came down
[1:18:51] let me keep going help me lord he's
[1:18:54] saying now luck
[1:18:56] he says now so finding
[1:18:58] help me lord and emotions and finding
[1:19:00] state of the might he said there are two
[1:19:02] different
[1:19:03] which is in your heart
[1:19:05] which is called your soul the spirit in
[1:19:08] your soul now they are very much in
[1:19:11] disagreement
[1:19:13] many times when the head seems to to say
[1:19:15] something in the soul wonders that it
[1:19:18] it's not right but when it comes into
[1:19:20] the soul the head seems to step back
[1:19:24] is that right
[1:19:25] he says so is a man think up in his
[1:19:27] heart so is he
[1:19:29] is that right he can hear when the devil
[1:19:32] came at you who tried to tempt jesus is
[1:19:35] that right or the lust of the eye and
[1:19:36] the lust of the flesh and the proud of
[1:19:38] life what did jesus do sooner or later
[1:19:41] he says what get back behind me satan
[1:19:44] you see so he now he got they cut he
[1:19:48] caught
[1:19:48] that it was just an intellectual it was
[1:19:51] using the word out of contents is that
[1:19:53] right so it wasn't going to work that's
[1:19:56] why we had to have a prophet to come and
[1:19:59] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:20:01] father he had to tie up all the loose
[1:20:03] sins
[1:20:05] and he had to speak judgment on the
[1:20:07] world is that right
[1:20:09] but we're looking for the rapture he's
[1:20:11] letting us know that we're in christ is
[1:20:14] that right there's no condemnation who
[1:20:17] those that are in christ jesus we walk
[1:20:19] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:20:22] is that right keep in your mind set fail
[1:20:25] on steadfast on christ and he will grant
[1:20:28] you a perfect peace is that right
[1:20:31] hallelujah
[1:20:32] help me lord he said now look
[1:20:36] he says now they
[1:20:38] he says but when it comes into the soul
[1:20:40] the head seems to do what step back
[1:20:43] that's right brother he get back the
[1:20:45] soul said uh-uh can't say amen can't say
[1:20:48] so be it is that right because down in
[1:20:51] the soul it lives off the word of god
[1:20:54] the anointed word of god
[1:20:57] you either got a faith seed in there or
[1:20:59] you got a doubt seed down in there is
[1:21:02] that right and it's going to produce it
[1:21:04] sooner or later it's going to produce
[1:21:06] it's going to be what showdown time is
[1:21:09] that right
[1:21:10] that's why we said we thank the lord you
[1:21:12] thank the lord for the prayer lines you
[1:21:15] thank the lord for those that come but
[1:21:17] we have to understand when that
[1:21:19] anointing comes on the gospel is that

[1:32:50] but in there you know it's always a
[1:32:53] mixed multitude is that right
[1:32:55] there's always a mixed multitude so we
[1:32:58] don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[1:33:00] not against persons is that right but
[1:33:02] satan will or no but we've been warned

[1:33:30] blood is satan trying to use his tactics
[1:33:33] is that right
[1:33:34] obsession oppression possession is that
[1:33:37] right obsession is trying to inject
[1:33:39] someone with a wrong thought
[1:33:42] he's trying to inject you with a thought
[1:33:46] that doesn't line up with what the word
[1:33:49] and what the holy spirit is teaching us
[1:33:51] in here is that right
[1:33:54] hallelujah
[1:33:55] let me keep it going here

[1:34:03] heaven he said the people who would go
[1:34:05] they take the manna and then sustain
[1:34:08] their life in the journey now god was
[1:34:11] bringing this form
[1:34:12] to sustain them along the way
[1:34:14] god has given us these words
[1:34:16] to sustain us along the way
[1:34:19] okay because let every man words be
[1:34:21] alive let god's word be true is that
[1:34:23] right so we can't we can't live off of
[1:34:25] man's words it got to be god's word is
[1:34:28] that right okay the message of the hour
[1:34:32] he said now look he said now we see that
[1:34:36] we see that same thing as happening in
[1:34:38] christianity many people before nine
[1:34:40] o'clock they get hungry you had a lot of
[1:34:43] campgrounds see that right campground
[1:34:46] stars and that's what he called the
[1:34:48] glory many people go to the service and
[1:34:50] rejoice and shout and praise the lord
[1:34:53] while the spirit of god is what falling
[1:34:55] and condemnation did what left their
[1:34:58] heart he said as soon as it got and as
[1:35:02] soon as a day or two after the revival
[1:35:06] huh
[1:35:07] he said after that
[1:35:09] after that revival they find themselves
[1:35:11] back in that old grind again
[1:35:14] yet they come eating manna is that right
[1:35:18] uh-huh let me keep going he says many he
[1:35:21] says
[1:35:22] he says now many people come to christ
[1:35:26] which was never which never been able to
[1:35:28] in the pentecostal world to make the
[1:35:30] pentecostal people see this fundamental
[1:35:32] truth see it's so hard see that's why so
[1:35:35] many leave they say it's too strict they
[1:35:37] say it's too hard no it's not i'm gonna
[1:35:39] take you to some churches if you don't
[1:35:40] land you're getting a solid foundation
[1:35:43] laid here
[1:35:45] okay
[1:35:46] you're getting a solid foundation in the
[1:35:49] word by god's grace in god's mercy
[1:35:52] and not deviating to the left and not
[1:35:54] deviating to the right is that right so
[1:35:57] he's trying to bring you into the
[1:35:59] character of that christian that god saw
[1:36:02] us before the foundation of the world he
[1:36:05] said now look
[1:36:06] he says he says he says now because the
[1:36:09] church has his doctrine and and they
[1:36:12] hear that pastor daley the evangelist is
[1:36:14] speaking and they on i'm gonna jump a
[1:36:16] little bit now
[1:36:17] but but they fail this truth he says now
[1:36:20] i often spoke yet to believe this faith
[1:36:23] or fundamental truth that jesus said
[1:36:27] he that heareth
[1:36:29] my word
[1:36:31] and do what believeth on him that sent
[1:36:34] me
[1:36:35] had what
[1:36:36] everlasting life and should not come
[1:36:38] into the condemnation but it has
[1:36:41] from death pass from death unto life you
[1:36:44] see it now turn to john 5 24 i want you
[1:36:47] to see it
[1:36:48] didn't have any scriptures but help me
[1:36:50] lord
[1:36:51] we want you to see it because the holy
[1:36:53] ghost gave it to the pastor the other
[1:36:55] week they want to but you got to
[1:36:57] continue in it some of you say oh we
[1:36:59] know that i know we know this but god
[1:37:01] don't want me to preach it again he said
[1:37:03] now look
[1:37:05] look at the the gospel of john five and
[1:37:07] let's look at the two verses it's uh
[1:37:10] saint john 5 24.
[1:37:12] he said now
[1:37:14] he says billy billy i say unto you he
[1:37:16] that what
[1:37:18] that there's eph on the end of it right
[1:37:21] that means then the holy ghost tell the
[1:37:23] pastor you got to continue in it is that
[1:37:25] right
[1:37:26] you can't just hear you got to continue
[1:37:28] in it is that right my word see
[1:37:30] organizations take that scripture and
[1:37:32] they just applied and that's all they do
[1:37:34] and they hold on to it and they go on
[1:37:36] and keep living the way they want to
[1:37:38] live
[1:37:39] is that right it doesn't work like that
[1:37:41] he said i continued in my word and
[1:37:43] believe it see you've got to also
[1:37:45] believe it continue believing he says on
[1:37:48] him that sent me have everlasting life
[1:37:50] and shall not come unto what
[1:37:51] condemnation but is passed from death or
[1:37:53] to life he said verily really i say unto
[1:37:56] you the hour is what coming and now is
[1:37:59] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:38:01] the son of god and they that hear shall
[1:38:04] what live see now they do what they we
[1:38:07] being quickened we're being quickened by
[1:38:09] the word is that right
[1:38:11] now once you continue in this word you
[1:38:14] build now you see why the holy ghost had
[1:38:17] the past to keep saying
[1:38:19] are you caught up
[1:38:20] are you caught up with the message are
[1:38:22] you caught up you see because you don't
[1:38:25] want you to get left behind and what god
[1:38:28] is bringing he's building your faith
[1:38:30] he's unfolding this word
[1:38:33] getting you ready for this rapture
[1:38:35] bringing us into our true origin what he
[1:38:38] initially send us here for is that right
[1:38:41] what the holy ghost is and what the holy
[1:38:43] ghost was sent here for it's right for
[1:38:45] us to become partnerships with god can
[1:38:48] you imagine that you're in partnership
[1:38:51] with the almighty god
[1:38:56] he says he hears my word believe the
[1:38:58] judgment he said what do what do we have
[1:39:00] believe here faith cometh by hearing he
[1:39:04] hearing the word of the word you got to
[1:39:05] continue let me jump on he said now the
[1:39:08] second thing we talked about the first
[1:39:10] thing was intellect the second thing
[1:39:12] brother branham he was working with here
[1:39:14] he was saying that now
[1:39:16] he says from he says from death unto
[1:39:18] life from darkness unto day for mortal
[1:39:21] to immortal from corruption into
[1:39:23] incorruption from weary unto what joy is
[1:39:27] that right it's always when you hit the
[1:39:29] door it gives god thanks thanking the
[1:39:32] lord for allowing you to enter his gates
[1:39:34] once again

[1:42:35] he says he says prayer with his soul he
[1:42:37] says
[1:42:40] let's start at five
[1:42:42] verse five he said sower went out to sow
[1:42:44] his seed and as he sold some fell by the
[1:42:46] wayside and it was trodden down and the
[1:42:49] fowls of the air devoured it and some
[1:42:51] fell upon the rock and some as soon as
[1:42:53] it sprung up it it withered away because
[1:42:55] it lacked moisture he said some fell
[1:42:58] among thorns and the thorns sprang up
[1:43:01] with it and did what choked it see and
[1:43:04] others fell on good ground and sprang up
[1:43:07] and bare her fruit and hundredfold and
[1:43:11] when he had said these things he cried
[1:43:14] and he had he didn't have an ear let him
[1:43:16] hear
[1:43:17] let him let him hear let him hear he say
[1:43:21] his ears hear and let him hear he says
[1:43:24] now look look at verse 11. he says now
[1:43:27] this parable is this the seed is the
[1:43:30] what the word of god he said those by
[1:43:33] the wayside are they that what
[1:43:35] hear that and cometh into who the devil

[1:43:44] hearts
[1:43:45] he said lest they should believe and be
[1:43:47] what
[1:43:48] now why is the devil trying to steal
[1:43:50] that word out of your heart
[1:43:59] stand still and hear the salvation of
[1:44:03] the lord which is the word of god

[1:44:43] their hearts lest they should believe
[1:44:45] and be saved he said they on the rock
[1:44:48] are they he said they on the rock are
[1:44:50] they which when they hear he says
[1:44:53] receive the word with what
[1:44:56] and these have no root
[1:44:58] which while which for a while believe
[1:45:02] and in time of what
[1:45:07] see something in your life

[1:46:46] serpent and a humble but we got to be
[1:46:48] harmless as a dove we got to stay ahead
[1:46:51] of him we got to pray bind up any demon
[1:46:54] force and that would try to tempt you is

[1:54:02] get him to see
[1:54:04] he said but have you received what the
[1:54:06] holy ghost since you believed so the
[1:54:09] people believe that's baptist teaching
[1:54:12] is that right they try to make them
[1:54:14] think since you believe you still got
[1:54:16] the holy ghost but now you got to move
[1:54:18] in have you received the holy ghost
[1:54:20] since you believe
[1:54:21] since you believe he says now look he
[1:54:24] said not that manna he was an anchor
[1:54:26] in christ you are anchored in christ

[1:54:44] you've entered into god you're on the
[1:54:46] campgrounds manna is falling and you're
[1:54:49] eating it he says now did you notice the
[1:54:52] strange thing
[1:54:53] there was a mixed multitude
[1:54:56] eating the manna
[1:54:59] bear with me
[1:55:02] he said now look people are sinners what
[1:55:05] do they accept they accept the lord
[1:55:07] jesus christ seeing the movement of the
[1:55:08] miracles the god of healing and whatever
[1:55:10] doing right open they they can open
[1:55:13] their hearts and rejoice in the sermon
[1:55:15] preached under the anointing and that's
[1:55:17] the same type of manner that the
[1:55:19] christian is eating say amen
[1:55:22] he says you see it then you always
[1:55:25] remember my doctrine he told them you
[1:55:28] have to follow god in threes he's he's
[1:55:31] perfect
[1:55:32] and now look
[1:55:34] i'm gonna jump a little bit he says now
[1:55:36] here
[1:55:37] i met
[1:55:38] he says help me lord i met people who
[1:55:41] would stand in the church and just
[1:55:43] rejoice and see some good outside
[1:55:46] go outside the church and maybe monday
[1:55:49] or tuesday
[1:55:50] and just living unbehaving
[1:55:53] becoming a christian and the man or the
[1:55:56] woman
[1:55:57] he said whoever it might be will turn
[1:56:00] again and shake your hand and i don't
[1:56:03] want to to do those things see they
[1:56:05] really don't want to be that way still
[1:56:08] with me they don't want to be that way
[1:56:10] but what he has shown him that the
[1:56:12] people need is the baptism of the holy
[1:56:15] ghost is that right
[1:56:16] and by them getting the baptism of the
[1:56:19] holy ghost now that will cause you to
[1:56:22] have a love and a burning desire for the
[1:56:24] word of god is that right you would have
[1:56:28] a thirst to come into the house of the
[1:56:30] lord it won't be a struggle so we're
[1:56:33] telling you that's why paul was saying
[1:56:35] it was two struggles the things i
[1:56:37] desired to do i did not the things i
[1:56:39] desired not to do i did is that right
[1:56:43] but he found out it was a war let me

[1:56:58] he said but i find a law that when i who
[1:57:01] do good evil is always presence with me
[1:57:04] he said for i delight in the law of god
[1:57:06] after the what the inward man is that
[1:57:09] right desiring to feed that soul he says
[1:57:12] but i see another law in my memories
[1:57:14] warring against the law of my mind my
[1:57:16] spirit and bringing me into captivity to
[1:57:20] the law of sin which is in the memories
[1:57:22] but he said oh wretched man that i am
[1:57:25] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:57:27] this death he says i thank god through
[1:57:30] jesus christ our lord so then when the

[1:57:54] what were you walking with later on
[1:57:56] when you see when you're moving those
[1:57:58] two three steps what the prophet was
[1:58:01] showing you was one they had to come and
[1:58:03] get out of the intellectual way of
[1:58:04] walking the second you need the baptism
[1:58:07] of the holy ghost to move into that in
[1:58:09] the third you have to move into the
[1:58:11] holiness of holy and when you get into
[1:58:13] that holiness of holy he was showing you
[1:58:16] now when you get there and behind the
[1:58:19] veil which christ was that high priest
[1:58:21] that came once for all ripped that veil
[1:58:24] on calvary for each and every one of us
[1:58:26] is that right so now so you'll be able
[1:58:28] to go behind the veil
[1:58:30] all right and then you can live in that
[1:58:33] veil
[1:58:34] that's what he was saying you live that
[1:58:36] life as a true christian you're not up
[1:58:39] you're not down you're not back you're
[1:58:41] not poor once a person move into the
[1:58:44] things that god has moved them into
[1:58:46] maybe the lord's will we'll get a chance
[1:58:48] to go and look into that but we look
[1:58:51] unto the hill to where our strength and
[1:58:53] our help cometh from something soft
[1:58:55] there brother we're looking through the
[1:58:57] hill and where our strength and our help
[1:58:58] cometh from he was typing it with that
[1:59:01] manner that manna that he got around
[1:59:03] there typed it with the pot of gold that
[1:59:05] pot that they had inside of the holiness
[1:59:08] of holiness the manna was always fresh
[1:59:11] the man always dropped down fresh for
[1:59:13] you and god came in and this is the way
[1:59:16] that he promised to bring them out this
[1:59:18] is the way that he promised to live
[1:59:20] that life not being tossed not being
[1:59:23] tossed to and fro but you have been
[1:59:25] justified you have been sanctified you
[1:59:27] have been filled with the holy ghost and
[1:59:29] now when you're feeling the holy ghost
[1:59:31] now you're resting you're resting in
[1:59:33] there we're at behind the veil the veil
[1:59:36] has been ripped when christ went to
[1:59:38] calvary and shed his blood for each and
[1:59:41] every one of us we don't have to worry
[1:59:43] about anything now there's no worry
[1:59:46] christ is taking care of all of our
[1:59:48] needs is that right
[1:59:50] but now we are speaking the word with
[1:59:52] faith we speak in a word with boldness
[1:59:55] you constantly stay in that light and
[1:59:57] then through in the church ages it gave
[1:59:59] us some light is that right in each of
[2:00:02] this age but when god came down and
[2:00:05] broke those seals and when he broke
[2:00:07] those seals and now we were able to move
[2:00:10] it to the holiness of holiness because
[2:00:12] all the loose sins was tied in all the
[2:00:14] light that light that stayed lit back
[2:00:17] there all the time that's why you see
[2:00:20] that person that's always joyous i'm
[2:00:22] closing my bible that's always joyous
[2:00:25] that's always staying in the presence of
[2:00:27] god and nothing seems to bother them
[2:00:30] where they've been they've moved behind
[2:00:32] the veil they're praying they're reading
[2:00:35] their bible every day they're studying
[2:00:37] the word is that right they're listening
[2:00:39] to the message they're rejoicing in what
[2:00:41] they're hearing they know
[2:00:43] they're letting it fall on good ground
[2:00:46] it's bringing forth much fruit they're
[2:00:48] maturing in the word they're waiting on
[2:00:50] patience when the promises of god what
[2:00:53] he said he's going to do he's going to
[2:00:55] do is that right hallelujah let us bow

[2:02:41] song y'all help me
[2:02:43] you're gonna i'm gonna get started and
[2:02:44] you come behind me
[2:02:47] i said it's nothing like the presence of
[2:02:51] the lord
[2:02:55] i said it's nothing like the presence of
[2:02:59] the lord
[2:03:01] [Music]
[2:03:04] and as we seek his face
[2:03:08] he is here in this place
[2:03:12] and there's nothing like the presence of
[2:03:17] the law
[2:03:18] somebody notice
[2:03:20] they say it again
[2:03:21] say there's nothing like the present
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:31] there is nothing like the presence of
[2:03:36] the
[2:03:40] then lord seek his face
[2:03:45] he is here in this place
[2:03:50] and it's nothing like the presence
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:08] someone
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:22] his pace
[2:04:25] he is there in this place
[2:04:29] and it's nothing like
[2:04:32] the presence of his joy saints his joy
[2:04:36] you can stand
[2:04:38] this joy
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:49] there is nothing like the praises of the
[2:04:54] lord
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:08] there's nothing like the presence of the
[2:05:13] lord
[2:05:15] amen
[2:05:17] how many enjoy the word tonight
[2:05:22] hallelujah
[2:05:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:05:27] amen
[2:05:32] [Music]
[2:05:34] you know like the brighter stare that
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:38] the first pull is healing
[2:05:41] right
[2:05:44] second pull is discernment
[2:05:46] and the third pull is the opening of the
[2:05:49] word
[2:05:50] amen
[2:05:51] but if you go to the same bible the
[2:05:53] scripture says that the word of god is
[2:05:55] the discerner
[2:05:58] of the
[2:06:00] thought and intent of the what
[2:06:03] so the word discern
[2:06:05] in other words the second pull is in the
[2:06:08] word
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] and i send my word and my word did water
[2:06:14] my dear
[2:06:15] my word did what
[2:06:17] so the first pull is in the word
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] so when you reach the third pole
[2:06:24] automatically that first and second pull
[2:06:26] are automatically locked in
[2:06:29] and that is why brother branham says the
[2:06:31] highest
[2:06:33] form of god to unfold himself because
[2:06:36] all god is bundled up into the word
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:41] it is not an intellectual religion
[2:06:44] it is everything is coming from the
[2:06:46] heart
[2:06:48] and as the brother has been uh preaching
[2:06:51] i keep thinking over and i say oh my god
[2:06:54] maybe one day we gotta talk about
[2:06:55] marriage
[2:06:58] amen
[2:06:59] because it's truly from here
[2:07:02] amen
[2:07:03] the bible says the marriage of who
[2:07:06] why did he have to be married like a
[2:07:08] lamb
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:14] why he was not married like god
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] for him to get married
[2:07:20] he have to be in morphy into the lamb
[2:07:26] amen
[2:07:27] because brother branham said at the
[2:07:29] beginning he was that eternal spirit
[2:07:32] that filled everything
[2:07:35] amen there was nothing
[2:07:37] no space
[2:07:39] no time
[2:07:40] nothing it was just eternity and he was
[2:07:43] the one that was feeling eternity and
[2:07:45] brother branham said that being
[2:07:47] had what we call supreme
[2:07:49] intelligence
[2:07:51] he knows everything he is omnipresent
[2:07:55] he is omnipotent he is omniscient he
[2:07:58] knows all everything
[2:08:00] that is god amen but at that stage he
[2:08:03] could not get married
[2:08:06] you know how he got married
[2:08:09] brother branham said within him there
[2:08:10] was an attribute that was called the
[2:08:12] lugos
[2:08:16] amen
[2:08:18] hallelujah
[2:08:22] can i get one minute
[2:08:24] or two or three
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:28] brother branham say within him this
[2:08:30] being here
[2:08:31] this eternal being
[2:08:33] inside him there was attribute amen
[2:08:37] and brother branham say
[2:08:39] one of the attributes was called the
[2:08:41] logos
[2:08:43] amen
[2:08:45] and that logos really was crushed
[2:08:48] everybody clear
[2:08:50] so god have to take the logos and pull
[2:08:53] it out of him
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:56] in other words god birth
[2:08:59] the logos
[2:09:01] amen
[2:09:03] when he birthed the logos
[2:09:05] the logos is a special attribute
[2:09:08] that means
[2:09:10] the fullness of god
[2:09:14] amen
[2:09:15] so when the logos came out of god
[2:09:19] god could not stay outside of the logos
[2:09:22] because the logos means our god
[2:09:27] amen
[2:09:28] when he was inside god he was just a
[2:09:30] thought
[2:09:31] when he came out of god and god spoken
[2:09:34] logos
[2:09:35] amen
[2:09:36] god could not stay
[2:09:39] and the logos going out
[2:09:42] when he said logos the logos was pulling
[2:09:45] god with him
[2:09:48] did you get it
[2:09:50] did you get it in other words the logos
[2:09:53] was the envelope
[2:09:55] that came out of god
[2:09:58] and when he was coming out of god
[2:10:00] that envelope remained open
[2:10:03] and as he's coming out of god god is
[2:10:06] getting into it
[2:10:11] take psalm chapter 104.
[2:10:18] you started not me
[2:10:24] amen
[2:10:26] you started not me
[2:10:29] take psalm 104
[2:10:33] blessed the lord oh
[2:10:39] oh lord my god that are very great
[2:10:43] they are clothed with water
[2:10:46] and with water
[2:10:48] number two verse two
[2:10:50] who covers that self with water
[2:10:53] as a water
[2:10:56] as an envelope
[2:10:58] amen
[2:10:59] so that pillar of fire
[2:11:02] that we call the logos when he was
[2:11:04] coming out of god
[2:11:06] that's why he was called the son of god
[2:11:09] amen that's why when they saw the four
[2:11:12] uh the
[2:11:13] the three rebel children in the fire
[2:11:16] furnace
[2:11:17] nebuchadnezzar said he looks like the
[2:11:19] son of god he was a pillar of fire you
[2:11:22] cannot burn the pillar of fire
[2:11:24] amen
[2:11:25] so when that attribute was coming out of
[2:11:27] god it was coming like an envelope that
[2:11:30] opened up
[2:11:31] so when it comes out of god it means oh
[2:11:33] god
[2:11:34] so god cannot stay there god have to get
[2:11:38] inside that
[2:11:40] amen
[2:11:41] that's what makes the pillar of fire god
[2:11:47] amen
[2:11:49] amen
[2:11:50] amorphy and kenosis together
[2:11:54] everybody
[2:11:55] and brother branham said this christ
[2:11:57] here was the very heart of god
[2:12:03] amen
[2:12:04] so god pull his heart first
[2:12:07] before he pulls his wife
[2:12:13] amen
[2:12:14] so before he get married he have to pull
[2:12:17] his heart
[2:12:18] he could not get married as a supreme
[2:12:21] intelligence
[2:12:24] amen
[2:12:26] he have to pull christ first
[2:12:28] then he made christ flesh and the
[2:12:31] beginning was
[2:12:33] and the word was with god and the word
[2:12:35] was
[2:12:36] and the word was made water
[2:12:38] christ came then he took him to calvary
[2:12:40] and pierced him
[2:12:42] now
[2:12:43] the wife of the
[2:12:46] lamb
[2:12:47] can come
[2:12:49] it is the wife of the heart of god
[2:12:54] so marriage is a hard situation
[2:12:59] never
[2:13:00] here anybody care
[2:13:03] everybody here
[2:13:05] marriage is a hard situation
[2:13:08] it is never here
[2:13:10] and men usually miss that
[2:13:13] and that's why we get trouble in the
[2:13:15] marriage
[2:13:18] amen
[2:13:20] i was talking to somebody i say
[2:13:22] this is one person
[2:13:25] there is another one here
[2:13:27] this one is getting here with their
[2:13:29] personal agenda
[2:13:31] and this one is coming up with their
[2:13:33] personal agenda
[2:13:36] you think it's not your personal agenda
[2:13:38] but it is
[2:13:40] because you are getting into married
[2:13:42] so that i can get a husband that is this
[2:13:44] that is tall that is this he's gonna buy
[2:13:47] me this he's gonna do this he's gonna do

[2:19:06] so when you jump into the marriage
[2:19:08] you're going to do what
[2:19:12] that's what i'm going to ask you if you
[2:19:14] want to get married in this church
[2:19:17] who are you trying to please
[2:19:20] or you wanna be
[2:19:22] pleased
[2:19:25] are you getting to do something
[2:19:28] because when the heart of god came down
[2:19:31] the heart of god was royal
[2:19:35] the heart of god was filled with all
[2:19:38] riches
[2:19:39] but that heart made himself poor
[2:19:45] so that we
[2:19:46] the bread might become water
[2:19:51] not he
[2:19:52] he kept himself rich so that the bread
[2:19:55] can do things for him no he himself
[2:19:58] become a servant as he's entering into
[2:20:02] the world the bible say christ enter as
[2:20:05] a servant it's written in your bible
[2:20:07] he's entering for service
[2:20:10] amen
[2:20:12] everything he has he have to give away
[2:20:15] he gave his time he gave his money he
[2:20:18] gave his glory he stripped himself of
[2:20:21] everything so that he make sure that's
[2:20:24] why you hear paul say husband love you
[2:20:27] as who
[2:20:35] let's pray
[2:20:36] let me stop there
[2:20:38] that's enough for you to chew
[2:20:40] amen
[2:20:42] and ponder if you really you want to get
[2:20:45] right that's why you hear brother
[2:20:46] brandon before you get married get the
[2:20:48] holy ghost
[2:20:49] to set your heart correctly
[2:20:52] and many things are done wrong because
[2:20:54] of not being taught
[2:20:56] right amen
[2:20:58] and he doesn't understand me you don't
[2:21:01] understand him because you always want
[2:21:03] to be understood
[2:21:06] you never took time to understand him
[2:21:09] and he always want to be understood
[2:21:12] and this one is
[2:21:14] wired differently
[2:21:15] and this one is wired differently
[2:21:18] and this one interpret things
[2:21:19] differently when the other one interpret
[2:21:22] things differently
[2:21:24] this one love means pay the bills
[2:21:27] the other love means sit with me on belk
[2:21:33] you can pay all the bills as long as you
[2:21:35] don't stand in that belk
[2:21:39] it doesn't mean anything
[2:21:42] let me stop you're going to understand
[2:21:44] me later let's pray heavenly father
[2:21:48] lord we thank you again for your grace
[2:21:51] for your love and for your mercy and for
[2:21:54] everything you are doing for us
[2:21:56] father i know why
[2:21:59] and you know exactly why i have to say
[2:22:01] what i said
[2:22:03] because i heard you speaking through
[2:22:05] your servant
[2:22:06] to the married people
[2:22:09] lord
[2:22:11] the devil has been
[2:22:13] troubling the family a lot
[2:22:16] and the lack of understanding of certain
[2:22:19] things has been the trouble
[2:22:21] where we keep casting out devils
[2:22:24] and don't understand that sometimes it's
[2:22:26] not even a devil
[2:22:28] it's just we were not
[2:22:30] thinking like the brothers say the
[2:22:32] correct mind
[2:22:34] has not been opened up yet
[2:22:36] lord may you help the family
[2:22:39] move away from those personal agenda
[2:22:43] and may they join together truly
[2:22:46] into one center of agenda
[2:22:50] which is to live
[2:22:52] and to express eternal life
[2:22:55] because eternal life is living for
[2:22:57] others
[2:22:59] if lord father we can all understand
[2:23:01] that
[2:23:02] not only to the married people
