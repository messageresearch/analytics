[45:22] fire from the hotel
[45:23] fire from the church so somehow we're
[45:26] gonna get there amen
[45:28] but random say attention is a blessing
[45:31] amen
[45:32] so sometimes we need to turn the oven up
[45:35] amen
[45:36] so by god's grace sooner you're going to
[45:38] get there amen
[45:40] just bear with me there was a question
[45:42] that was
[45:44] answered yesterday the last question
[45:48] for those that were there the very that
[45:51] was a very
[45:51] very important question and brother
[45:54] kelly mentioned something and i went
[45:55] home and i finally found it where
[45:58] brother branham answered that question
[46:01] so i'm going to add it up a little bit
[46:02] if it takes time it's not me
[46:04] you know who answered that who asked
[46:06] that question
[46:08] amen question and answer
[46:11] in 1964
[46:14] brother branham i'm waiting just three
[46:18] more minutes if i can
[46:20] and remember that question was the last
[46:22] one
[46:24] i'm waiting just three more minutes if i
[46:26] can
[46:27] let me get something short here maybe
[46:29] but random answer that same question
[46:32] that was the last one the question was i
[46:35] can't give
[46:36] over completely to jesus
[46:39] in other words i cannot surrender to
[46:42] jesus that was the question
[46:45] have i an evil spirit
[46:49] but when i mentioned he said let me just
[46:51] spend
[46:52] the rest of the time on that day
[46:55] that's what happened yesterday we spent
[46:57] the rest of the time
[46:58] until we closed yesterday let me just
[47:00] spend the rest of the time on that day
[47:04] but random now is explaining that
[47:06] question he said
[47:07] you can't surrender to jesus
[47:11] they don't i don't know man or woman
[47:14] i could not tell which it is god knows
[47:17] that
[47:19] now brother branham is going to answer
[47:20] that brother branham said you can't
[47:23] surrender to jesus why
[47:26] what's the matter if you are a woman
[47:30] don't you have to surrender to your
[47:33] husband
[47:34] to be a wife brother kelly you remember
[47:36] that surrender
[47:38] all you are a leader
[47:42] lady when you were married virtuous
[47:45] fought all your life to stay virtuous in
[47:48] other words
[47:48] you remained virgin but one day you
[47:52] found a man that you loved
[47:55] so like we explained yesterday it start
[47:57] with a love in a heart
[48:00] you wear his completely so just love can
[48:04] drive you
[48:05] automatically to begin to surrender the
[48:08] things
[48:09] that you fought against all your life
[48:12] and try to live clean
[48:14] and clear and virtuous now
[48:17] you surrender every bit of it to one man
[48:21] is that right you put yourself
[48:24] completely
[48:25] in his you are
[48:28] so to surrender is to put yourself
[48:31] completely into the hand of someone amen
[48:35] whatever you have that is precious in
[48:37] your life
[48:39] whatever talent you have whatever
[48:42] uh skill that god put in your heart
[48:45] all of them you take everything and you
[48:48] surrender that to that person
[48:50] and the person we're talking about here
[48:52] is the lord jesus christ
[48:54] because paul in ephesians 5 he says that
[48:58] the relationship between men and a woman
[49:00] is the same as christ
[49:02] and the church anybody clear so far
[49:04] brother brother continue he say all that
[49:07] you st you have stood for
[49:09] indecency and morale by the david a
[49:12] little bit
[49:12] and everything like that now you turn
[49:15] over to a man
[49:17] because you surrender yourself to the
[49:21] man
[49:22] so to surrender is to turn yourself over
[49:25] to somebody to surrender is to put
[49:29] yourself completely
[49:31] in the hands of someone amen can't you
[49:34] do the same thing to who
[49:37] jesus christ just surrender yourself
[49:40] that way
[49:41] all that i am all my mind all my
[49:45] thoughts
[49:46] certainly brother branham continued on
[49:49] the same one
[49:50] he says i don't think that you are
[49:53] possessed
[49:54] of an evil spirit amen
[49:58] so if you begin to struggle in your life
[50:01] for surrendering and you feel like i
[50:04] need to surrender my life
[50:05] it is not an evil spirit what it is then
[50:09] brother branham say i think that
[50:13] evil spirit anoints you
[50:16] with them kind of thoughts
[50:19] you remember we talked about the
[50:21] thoughts yesterday
[50:22] amen so the one that is telling you
[50:26] speaking to you that's the evil spirit
[50:33] just remember that on what we're going
[50:35] to enter here
[50:37] we appreciate all the family members
[50:39] among us we don't have visitors
[50:42] all the family members god bless you
[50:45] amen
[50:46] let me call brother total god bless you
[50:53] amen
[50:55] he said i think that evil spirit
[50:58] anoints you with them kind of thoughts
[51:01] trying to make you think
[51:04] that you cannot surrender yourself
[51:08] to god so when you're struggling i
[51:12] cannot surrender myself
[51:14] i cannot surrender myself actually it's
[51:17] a good sign
[51:23] if the devil is telling you you're not a
[51:25] christian
[51:26] that's a good sign
[51:30] because if you really not a christian
[51:32] he's not going to bother you
[51:37] amen by the way i'm saying let me show
[51:40] you something
[51:42] why would you want to surrender to him
[51:46] the first question because
[51:49] there is something out there calling to
[51:53] you to do what
[51:54] to surrender it's a very good
[51:58] sign that you ought to surrender
[52:01] yourself so when you feel like i need to
[52:05] surrender my life
[52:06] it is telling you god is ready to do
[52:09] something
[52:10] for your life that's why you begin to
[52:12] feel that pull
[52:14] and don't let the devil touch you out of
[52:16] it
[52:17] amen now what should we do brother
[52:20] branham
[52:22] all you do brother or
[52:25] sister may be a young person or
[52:28] old whatever it is in other words any
[52:31] category
[52:33] just can't find themselves so they can
[52:35] completely
[52:36] surrender brother branham is giving you
[52:38] the answer
[52:40] just give yourself over
[52:44] how do you do it brother branham i need
[52:46] that magic formula
[52:49] says this say this lord
[52:53] my thinking
[52:56] my all that i am i want to give
[53:00] it to you remember yesterday we spoke to
[53:03] you that
[53:04] when you talk to god don't talk to god
[53:07] showing him that you have a phd degree
[53:11] talk to god like a child like an
[53:15] elementary person don't talk to god lord
[53:19] you know strategically thinking
[53:22] when i was pondering on that pretty much
[53:24] you wasting your time
[53:26] tell him that he hurt clear
[53:31] not i'm a little bit uncomfortable god i
[53:34] want you to understand
[53:35] no father he hurt i can't take it no
[53:40] more
[53:44] that's the way you talk to god
[53:46] [Applause]
[53:50] jesus was not speaking a high hebrew
[53:52] language
[53:53] he was speaking a street language
[53:57] why did god use a common language
[54:01] amen lord my thinking
[54:04] my all that i am i want to give it to
[54:07] you
[54:07] my life i give as a life of water
[54:12] of service take me lord and use me
[54:16] just as i don't make yourself
[54:20] something that you are not just like
[54:24] i am why because you're the one that
[54:25] created me
[54:27] just like i am and it is such
[54:31] a water never was the message
[54:35] complicated
[54:37] it is such a simple thing i wish the
[54:40] church could really i believe if the
[54:44] tabernacle now
[54:45] benefiting on these questions how do you
[54:49] surrender
[54:50] you got your answer right there any
[54:52] questions so far
[54:54] in the message perfect strength brother
[54:56] brown i'm saying
[54:57] so as long as we are trying in ourself
[55:02] and depending on our own abilities and
[55:05] so forth
[55:06] we shall do the bible say without you we
[55:11] can do
[55:12] amen but when we get to a place where we
[55:16] know
[55:17] we are nothing then god
[55:20] can use us the important thing
[55:24] one of the important things that we must
[55:27] master
[55:27] now remember this and especially you
[55:30] young preachers
[55:31] and lay members alike there is one thing
[55:35] that we got to master
[55:36] if we expect to fulfill god's desire
[55:40] in our life that is we have to master
[55:44] the thought of water
[55:46] human ability if we ever
[55:50] get to a spot where we think that we can
[55:53] do it
[55:54] with our own intelligence and our
[55:57] own abilities we got to
[56:00] master that in such a way
[56:04] that we can get rid of the thing
[56:08] and lay it aside so that god can do
[56:10] water
[56:12] in other words to surrender or to put
[56:15] your car in
[56:16] neutral is to come like you don't know
[56:18] anything
[56:21] amen and make a complete water
[56:25] surrender we cannot use one
[56:29] ability we got to make a complete
[56:33] surrender
[56:34] and to come to god you got to surrender
[56:37] to him both soul
[56:40] body and spirit everything that you are
[56:44] has to be surrendered to god in order
[56:47] that he can work
[56:49] his will not your will in you
[56:52] and in me everybody clear so far
[56:56] that is hard i know because we are
[57:00] always wanting to put our part in
[57:04] something that we know we know that we
[57:06] want to do it
[57:07] well say i just know it should be done
[57:10] this way
[57:11] but as long as you are doing it that way
[57:14] it's going to be and god will never use
[57:18] that
[57:19] in other words take your hand off your
[57:22] life
[57:24] it's your life take your hand off of it
[57:27] it's your child take your hand off of it
[57:30] eat your husband get your hand off of
[57:33] your husband
[57:34] take your husband put him in the hand of
[57:36] god
[57:38] amen maybe with the help of the lord
[57:42] we're going to get into that in a few
[57:44] minutes
[57:45] and show you how god cannot use your
[57:50] why is it important in jeremiah 10 23
[57:54] jeremiah say oh lord i know that man
[57:58] that the way of a man is not in
[58:03] himself it is not in men that worketh to
[58:07] direct
[58:08] his water that's why we are lamb and we
[58:11] must be led by the
[58:13] dove amen for as many
[58:16] as are led by the spirit of god
[58:19] they are the sons of god sons of god
[58:23] are people that are led they are people
[58:27] that learn
[58:28] how to master the human element to get
[58:31] rid of your intelligence
[58:33] use it on your computer but don't use it
[58:36] to direct your
[58:37] thoughts amen because we have failure to
[58:40] begin with
[58:41] by the way we were birthed everybody
[58:44] clear so far
[58:45] now let's go to the scripture psalm
[58:47] chapter 66.
[58:52] so what you have yesterday you add on to
[58:54] this i believe you got the full answer
[58:57] so i'm not the one who took this minute
[59:00] don't blame me
[59:01] and don't blame that person either
[59:05] so you cover it amen
[59:09] that's a hard question
[59:12] a hard thing to do because the society
[59:16] we're living in we are prone to
[59:19] function like computers
[59:22] we have been programmed
[59:25] for a certain system you got to do this
[59:28] you got to do this to get approved you
[59:30] got to take a credit card you got to
[59:32] swap
[59:32] it and use it and build your credit
[59:34] before you get approved
[59:35] all of that we have been built like that
[59:37] and we function like that
[59:39] so when god come he say i don't need
[59:41] your credit card it's a problem
[59:42] you want to take god and put him in your
[59:44] credit card system
[59:49] which credit card did peter use
[59:52] when they wanted to pay taxes which
[59:55] credit card did they borrow
[59:59] do you know that credit card he was a
[1:00:02] fish
[1:00:07] matter of fact he was not a credit card
[1:00:09] a gift card
[1:00:11] [Applause]
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:12] so you don't have to reimburse it
[1:00:18] don't you like it he gives the bird of
[1:00:22] the earth food
[1:00:23] why do you worry
[1:00:30] you don't need a ph degree
[1:00:33] you don't need to be a doctor you don't
[1:00:36] need it
[1:00:36] amen some will say my me
[1:00:39] okay psalm chapter 66 verse 12
[1:00:43] if you dare you can say a man
[1:00:47] we got the high heel clear we got how
[1:00:50] long your dress should be clear
[1:00:52] so if you wear a short dress a short
[1:00:54] skirt that's not my
[1:00:56] problem the blood is in your hand if you
[1:00:59] wear a high heel
[1:01:00] the blood is in your hand not in me
[1:01:03] when i go to heaven i'll tell god get on
[1:01:05] youtube it's right there
[1:01:09] amen i gave them the scripture i gave
[1:01:12] them the quote
[1:01:13] psalm 66 verse 12 something acting up
[1:01:17] okay cool verse 12 you have caused man
[1:01:22] to ride over our head you might be
[1:01:24] seated
[1:01:27] we went through water
[1:01:31] remember we're back we're going back up
[1:01:33] to the surface now
[1:01:35] amen if you're struggling with the
[1:01:38] territory of the black dog
[1:01:40] you need to see the deacon you have
[1:01:43] caused
[1:01:44] man to rod over our head we went through
[1:01:47] fire and through water
[1:01:51] there is two tests here
[1:01:54] one of them is a test of fire
[1:01:58] it's a test that burns
[1:02:05] the other one is a test of water
[1:02:13] amen we went through
[1:02:17] fire and through water
[1:02:20] so the first part you're going through
[1:02:22] the fire
[1:02:24] and you thought it's finished no down
[1:02:27] the road
[1:02:28] there is another path you're gonna go
[1:02:31] through water
[1:02:34] one will burn you one will try to
[1:02:38] submerge you
[1:02:43] it will try to submerge you
[1:02:46] or to overflow you
[1:02:49] or to take over you
[1:02:53] to experience that you're going to go
[1:02:56] through
[1:02:57] one burned you one will try to
[1:03:01] take over you amen
[1:03:04] who did that god cause you
[1:03:07] to go that path amen
[1:03:11] but you brought us out
[1:03:14] into a wealthy place
[1:03:17] so despite the fact that you went
[1:03:20] through fire
[1:03:21] and through water the end result
[1:03:24] is a wealthy place it's a good place
[1:03:28] amen verse 13 i will go
[1:03:31] into your house after david went through
[1:03:35] this
[1:03:35] i will go into your house with burn
[1:03:39] offering i will pay you my vows
[1:03:43] which my lips have added and my mouth
[1:03:47] had spoken
[1:03:48] when i was in trouble so somehow
[1:03:52] when david was going to trouble maybe it
[1:03:55] was the trouble of the fire or maybe was
[1:03:58] the trouble of the water
[1:04:00] it was so tough until david have to make
[1:04:03] a promise to god like
[1:04:05] father if you take me out of this you
[1:04:08] know what i will do this
[1:04:10] so as soon as he came out david kept his
[1:04:12] word
[1:04:13] and he went to the town to the temple to
[1:04:16] fulfill
[1:04:17] what he vowed unto the lord amen
[1:04:22] verse 15 i will offer to you burnt
[1:04:24] sacrifice of fatlings
[1:04:27] with the incense of frames i will offer
[1:04:30] bullocks
[1:04:31] with goats sealer come
[1:04:34] and hear all you that fear god
[1:04:37] not only am i giving the sacrifice to
[1:04:40] the lord
[1:04:41] but when i get into the house of the
[1:04:43] lord i'm gonna testify
[1:04:46] like hey everybody that feel the lord
[1:04:48] coming here
[1:04:50] hear what how i went through the fire
[1:04:53] and how i went through the water amen
[1:04:56] come and heal all you that fear god and
[1:04:59] i will declare
[1:05:01] what he has done for my soul
[1:05:04] anybody clear from my heart i cried to
[1:05:07] him with my mouth
[1:05:09] and he was extol with my tongue
[1:05:12] so in the midst of the crying there was
[1:05:15] also
[1:05:16] praises amen it's a praises
[1:05:19] mixed with crying in other words he hurt
[1:05:22] but praise the lord for healing me he
[1:05:25] hurt
[1:05:26] praise the lord for healing me it's a
[1:05:28] mixture anybody clear
[1:05:30] if i regard iniquity in my heart
[1:05:33] the lord will not hear me so when you go
[1:05:36] through this fire
[1:05:37] and through the water make sure your
[1:05:39] heart is pure
[1:05:41] because that's the only way you can get
[1:05:43] deliverance
[1:05:45] and be taken out of it amen
[1:05:48] but verily god has heard me
[1:05:52] he has attended to the voice of my water
[1:05:56] so we found out that going through the
[1:05:58] fire
[1:05:59] david rely on one element that is called
[1:06:02] prayer
[1:06:04] and when he went to the water he still
[1:06:07] work work with one
[1:06:08] element which is called prayer
[1:06:12] so the solution for the fire and for the
[1:06:15] water
[1:06:16] is always the same
[1:06:20] everybody clear verse 20 blessed be god
[1:06:24] which has not turned away my prayer
[1:06:28] nor his mercy from me everybody clear so
[1:06:31] far
[1:06:32] go to psalm chapter 69
[1:06:35] blessed be the name of the lord verse
[1:06:38] 1. if you dare you can say amen
[1:06:43] save me o god further
[1:06:48] for the waters are coming into my
[1:06:51] so this is not a physical water
[1:06:56] anybody clear it's a water that submerge
[1:06:59] your soul or your inner being
[1:07:08] or your inward man
[1:07:11] or your inward being or your inward
[1:07:14] woman
[1:07:15] anybody care save me your god
[1:07:19] for the waters are come into my soul
[1:07:22] not my body so this is a spiritual
[1:07:26] water it is a spiritual fight
[1:07:30] amen i sink in deep mire
[1:07:34] where there is no standing in other
[1:07:36] words it seems like i have been sucked
[1:07:39] into something that is drawing me
[1:07:42] so the experience of the water you will
[1:07:46] feel like you have been
[1:07:47] sucked
[1:07:52] everybody care and you are sinking
[1:07:56] in other words it's a withdrawn
[1:07:59] something is pulling
[1:08:01] anybody clear i sink in deep mire
[1:08:04] where there is no standing i am come
[1:08:07] into
[1:08:08] deep waters where the flood did water
[1:08:12] overflow me remember your overflow is
[1:08:15] right here
[1:08:16] it is something that is taking over you
[1:08:20] it's overwhelming you can control it
[1:08:24] verse 3 i am weary of my crying
[1:08:29] so the experience of water makes you
[1:08:36] weary
[1:08:38] it will make you sometime cry
[1:08:43] you look almost like you lost your mind
[1:08:48] amen i am weary of my crying
[1:08:52] my throat is dried my eyes
[1:08:56] fell while i wait for my
[1:09:00] in other words i'm tired it seems like i
[1:09:02] can't take it i'm overwhelmed
[1:09:05] yet i'm still waiting on the lord
[1:09:08] the water experience because in the book
[1:09:11] of revelation
[1:09:13] the bible says that the voice of god is
[1:09:15] like the voice of
[1:09:17] many water so these waters sometimes
[1:09:20] have voices
[1:09:25] let's go to isaiah 43
[1:09:30] amen in psalm we went through the fire
[1:09:34] a burning experience and we also go to
[1:09:38] the waters
[1:09:39] an experience that submerges overflow
[1:09:42] take over our soul we feel like we're
[1:09:45] sinking
[1:09:46] we are sat we are weary we're crying
[1:09:50] like thoughts coming all over
[1:09:53] the world experience isaiah
[1:09:56] 43 amen
[1:10:00] your question took my time
[1:10:04] so don't praise me
[1:10:10] chapter 43 verse one everybody clear
[1:10:14] but now that says the lord that created
[1:10:17] you o jacob
[1:10:19] and he that form you if you notice there
[1:10:22] is a creation
[1:10:24] than a form if you go to genesis 1 26
[1:10:27] god created man
[1:10:29] and genesis 2 7 god form the man
[1:10:32] so the god that created you and form you
[1:10:35] that is responsible for your soul and
[1:10:38] responsible for your spirit
[1:10:40] and your body we clear now
[1:10:43] okay but now that says the lord that
[1:10:46] created you
[1:10:47] your spirit or jacob and he that form
[1:10:50] you your body
[1:10:51] or israel fear not if god said fear not
[1:10:56] there is something there that that can
[1:10:57] make you afraid
[1:10:59] fear not for i have redeemed you
[1:11:02] i have called you by your name you are
[1:11:06] mine so at the beginning right here
[1:11:10] god is reminding you that i am your
[1:11:13] author
[1:11:14] i am the one that created your body
[1:11:17] i am the one that created your soul i am
[1:11:20] the one that created your being
[1:11:23] and i want you to keep in mind that
[1:11:26] i am the one that redeem you because
[1:11:29] according to paul when we talk about
[1:11:33] the armor of a christian a christian
[1:11:36] usually have a helmet on the head and
[1:11:39] the helmet is water
[1:11:42] it's a salvation the helmet
[1:11:45] is on the head and the helmet
[1:11:49] is the helmet of your salvation so god
[1:11:52] now is telling you remember
[1:11:54] i saved you remember i redeemed you
[1:11:59] remember i am the one that called you by
[1:12:02] name
[1:12:03] we know that calling it's god pulling
[1:12:05] into your heart
[1:12:06] that's why you came because your name
[1:12:09] was written
[1:12:10] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:12:12] foundation of the world
[1:12:14] i am the one that called you no one can
[1:12:16] come to me
[1:12:17] except the father joseph i am the one
[1:12:20] that did it
[1:12:22] you are mine i want you to keep that in
[1:12:25] your mind
[1:12:26] why do you have to keep that if you
[1:12:29] don't have this experience
[1:12:31] what is going to follow it's going to be
[1:12:33] a trouble so you must
[1:12:34] make sure you have isaiah 43 1
[1:12:38] first in other words you must make sure
[1:12:40] you a christian
[1:12:42] first because
[1:12:45] that christian experience will give you
[1:12:48] a helmet
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:52] amen that's why david said we store
[1:12:56] not the salvation
[1:12:59] amen just the joy of the salvation
[1:13:04] because the salvation is eternal
[1:13:07] once god saves you he won't save you to
[1:13:09] lose you
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:13] eternal security
[1:13:16] hallelujah now watch verse two
[1:13:19] when you pass through the water
[1:13:23] that's why i want you to remember where
[1:13:25] you come from
[1:13:26] everybody when you pass through the
[1:13:30] waters
[1:13:32] anybody clear when you pass through the
[1:13:35] water come
[1:13:36] on i won't be with water in other words
[1:13:40] since i am
[1:13:41] already in you when you going through
[1:13:44] the water
[1:13:45] i am the one controlling the ship
[1:13:48] that's why you must keep your car in
[1:13:51] neutral
[1:13:52] because i need to navigate i'm a
[1:13:55] submarine
[1:13:56] i know how to navigate the deep water
[1:14:00] you don't know deep water i know but
[1:14:03] you're going to go through the water
[1:14:04] i will be there
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:10] hallelujah karma
[1:14:14] and through the word rivers they shall
[1:14:17] not do water
[1:14:19] because i'm there when you walk through
[1:14:23] the water
[1:14:24] you see the first one about here
[1:14:28] when you walk through the fire
[1:14:33] one you walking
[1:14:36] another one you passing
[1:14:42] amen when you walk like shadrach
[1:14:46] meshach abednego in the fire
[1:14:52] we clear now when you walk in the
[1:14:55] through the fire
[1:14:56] you shall not be water neither shall
[1:15:00] they flame
[1:15:01] kindle upon water so you're gonna
[1:15:04] go through this experience these
[1:15:07] experiences are gonna shake you
[1:15:10] but you're not gonna get burned
[1:15:14] if i am there anybody here
[1:15:17] you're gonna go through the waters the
[1:15:20] water are gonna be tough
[1:15:22] but they're not gonna overthrow you
[1:15:25] amen even when peter begin to doubt
[1:15:29] god and to sink in god
[1:15:33] reach out and pull him up
[1:15:37] showing you that if it gets to the point
[1:15:39] that you are sinking
[1:15:41] i'm gonna reach out because you are
[1:15:43] eternally
[1:15:45] saved amen
[1:15:49] when you pass when you walk through the
[1:15:51] fire you shall not be burned
[1:15:53] neither shall the flame kindle upon
[1:15:57] you so the fire he burns because he got
[1:16:00] flames
[1:16:02] everybody clear let's go to mark 5 then
[1:16:05] we
[1:16:06] can pray to experience again
[1:16:09] the fire and the waters
[1:16:12] but god will walk you through both of
[1:16:15] them
[1:16:16] so make sure you got god if not
[1:16:20] you get to the fire yes you're gonna get
[1:16:22] burned
[1:16:25] amen
[1:16:29] mark chapter five what are you trying to
[1:16:32] say today
[1:16:34] we are going back up to the surface
[1:16:37] amen we're leaving the deep ocean
[1:16:42] so make sure you leave everything down
[1:16:44] there
[1:16:45] because we're going to soar into new
[1:16:47] territory
[1:16:51] like paul say leaving the elementary
[1:16:54] thing
[1:16:54] now let's go on to
[1:16:58] mark 5 24 if you dare you can say amen
[1:17:03] and jesus went with him and many people
[1:17:06] followed him
[1:17:07] and tongue him in other words people
[1:17:09] were pushing him
[1:17:11] and a certain woman which had an
[1:17:14] issue of blood 12 years
[1:17:19] if a woman has an issue of blood this is
[1:17:22] not a girl
[1:17:27] okay it's an issue that was not there
[1:17:30] at first and it started
[1:17:33] at a certain period which one
[1:17:38] we have to figure it out but it lasted
[1:17:42] 12 years what
[1:17:46] was the cause of this woman losing blood
[1:17:52] because as she was going she was going
[1:17:55] through the normal
[1:17:56] circle of a woman without any problem
[1:18:00] but come a certain time in her life
[1:18:05] that something happened and whatever
[1:18:08] happened
[1:18:09] troubled her circle and she could not
[1:18:13] recover
[1:18:14] what was that
[1:18:18] okay okay
[1:18:22] amen and head suffer many things
[1:18:28] everybody clear of many physicians they
[1:18:31] try
[1:18:31] many treatment it's not working
[1:18:35] amen and head spend
[1:18:39] all that she had not only
[1:18:42] was it pain in the treatment but it was
[1:18:45] also affecting
[1:18:46] her lifestyle her finances and in other
[1:18:50] words
[1:18:50] the household of this man was turned
[1:18:54] upside down what caused it
[1:18:59] is not the issue of blood it's
[1:19:02] what caused the issue of blood that
[1:19:05] destroyed the entire home
[1:19:09] anybody clear amen
[1:19:12] she suffered many things of many
[1:19:15] physicians
[1:19:16] and had spent all that she had and was
[1:19:19] nothing better in other words he was not
[1:19:21] helping
[1:19:22] but rather grew worse when she had
[1:19:26] heard of jesus came
[1:19:29] in the press behind and touched his
[1:19:32] garment
[1:19:33] for she said if i may touch
[1:19:37] but his clothes i shall be whole
[1:19:40] and immediately the fountain of her
[1:19:43] blood was
[1:19:44] dried up anybody clear
[1:19:47] and she felt in her body
[1:19:51] so whatever happened in her life
[1:19:54] affected her body
[1:19:56] amen and she felt in her body
[1:19:59] that she was healed of that
[1:20:02] at the beginning it seems like he was
[1:20:05] something natural
[1:20:07] and the devil entering and he became a
[1:20:10] plug
[1:20:12] anybody clear now let's pray
[1:20:15] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:20:18] for your grace
[1:20:19] your love your mercy your presence here
[1:20:22] this morning and your blessings lord
[1:20:24] father we are committing again this
[1:20:26] service unto the hand
[1:20:28] and we asking that you come and speak to
[1:20:30] us
[1:20:31] may you move me completely out of the
[1:20:33] way and may you move also your children
[1:20:36] completely out of the way so that it
[1:20:38] will be you speaking
[1:20:40] and you hearing because when you hear
[1:20:42] you hear better than a man
[1:20:44] father help us out and seal the devil
[1:20:47] completely
[1:20:48] out of this place and may nothing else
[1:20:50] but the spirit of god
[1:20:52] take a full preeminence and minister to
[1:20:54] your children
[1:20:55] as we ambly ask it in the name of jesus
[1:20:58] christ
[1:21:00] amen everybody clear so far we're going
[1:21:03] back up on the surface
[1:21:05] toward the second banquet we on part
[1:21:08] 45 when we talk
[1:21:11] about this chart you already acquainted
[1:21:14] with it
[1:21:15] this chart shows the stages of a human
[1:21:19] life circle circle we start
[1:21:23] in a conception then we are born born we
[1:21:26] go to our toddler preschool
[1:21:28] then we reach adolescence and by
[1:21:31] reaching adolescence this is when we
[1:21:33] drop
[1:21:33] down deep into the ocean and we found
[1:21:37] out the stuff
[1:21:38] or the things that an adolescent
[1:21:41] struggle with
[1:21:42] we found beer women smoking all this
[1:21:45] kind of stuff amen
[1:21:47] then from there you go to adulthood and
[1:21:50] from adulthood
[1:21:51] into the uh old age and i explained it
[1:21:55] to you that
[1:21:56] this goes like a pyramid because when
[1:21:59] you are born
[1:22:00] your birth started right here at the
[1:22:02] bottom then you're gonna go
[1:22:04] through a stage and it's gonna be
[1:22:06] adolescence right here
[1:22:07] when you move from adolescence you go to
[1:22:10] your peak
[1:22:10] of adulthood everybody clear do you
[1:22:13] remember this
[1:22:14] then from there you're gonna drop down
[1:22:16] and it's gonna be another station here
[1:22:19] and when you drop right here you go all
[1:22:21] the way down
[1:22:22] you start as a baby and you're going to
[1:22:24] end up like a baby somebody changing
[1:22:27] your diaper
[1:22:28] in a hospice or in a nursing home
[1:22:31] somewhere
[1:22:32] just like they were changing your diaper
[1:22:34] there if the lord tarry so much you're
[1:22:36] going to find somebody changing your
[1:22:37] diaper right
[1:22:38] anybody clear so something happened here
[1:22:41] that we dealt with adolescence
[1:22:44] because when we start here from a
[1:22:46] childhood and you are born
[1:22:48] and you go there we know that we are
[1:22:50] born in sin
[1:22:51] we are shaping iniquity coming into the
[1:22:54] word speaking lies
[1:22:55] and by nature by sex we are born with a
[1:22:58] wrong nature
[1:23:00] and we automatically were programmed or
[1:23:03] geared to do what is wrong in our life
[1:23:05] that's why you don't
[1:23:06] you don't teach a child how to lie hard
[1:23:09] to hide something
[1:23:10] they automatically know it because of
[1:23:12] the way they were born
[1:23:14] everybody clear the only one that was
[1:23:16] born differently was the lord jesus
[1:23:18] christ and
[1:23:18] adam because adam have never had a belly
[1:23:22] button
[1:23:26] let me continue everybody clear blessed
[1:23:30] be the name of the lord
[1:23:31] so we found out that this during this
[1:23:33] period here
[1:23:34] the black dog is covered he's protected
[1:23:38] it's there
[1:23:39] it's laying dormant everybody clear
[1:23:42] until a certain age you're gonna fight
[1:23:44] to do things that are wrong
[1:23:46] and everything god knows it under the
[1:23:48] blood of the lamb
[1:23:49] then you're going to reach a certain age
[1:23:51] and things change
[1:23:52] that is adolescence now when you look
[1:23:56] at this human life circle from
[1:23:59] conception
[1:24:00] all the way to the old age the bible
[1:24:03] says this we know the solution is prayer
[1:24:06] that in genesis 2 chapter 16 verse 17
[1:24:10] and the lord god commanded the man
[1:24:13] saying
[1:24:13] of every tree including the tree of life
[1:24:16] remember
[1:24:17] of the garden you may eat freely
[1:24:22] in other words the tree of life was
[1:24:25] given to men
[1:24:26] freely but of the tree of the knowledge
[1:24:31] of good and evil
[1:24:32] you shall not eat of it for in the days
[1:24:35] that you eat thereof you shall surely
[1:24:37] water
[1:24:38] in other words when god created man
[1:24:42] man was not supposed to die
[1:24:46] man was created to be living
[1:24:49] eternally ever clear and the solution or
[1:24:54] the ingredient
[1:24:55] to eternal life was given in the tree of
[1:24:59] life
[1:25:01] and that tree of life the access was
[1:25:03] given freely to man
[1:25:05] where anybody can go straight to the
[1:25:08] tree of life
[1:25:09] eat and as soon as you partake of the
[1:25:11] tree of life
[1:25:12] you will never die for some reason adam
[1:25:16] never touched that tree
[1:25:18] they were interested at the apple they
[1:25:21] were interested eating avocado with eve
[1:25:24] they were interested eating plums and
[1:25:28] and strawberries and all kind of fruit
[1:25:30] and for some reason
[1:25:32] nothing was attracting them to the tree
[1:25:34] of life
[1:25:35] but for some reason the devil pulled
[1:25:38] them away and moved them to a different
[1:25:41] attraction which was the tree of the
[1:25:44] knowledge of good and evil
[1:25:45] and when they ate that tree god told
[1:25:48] them that the dare you eat
[1:25:49] you're going to die so in genesis
[1:25:52] chapter 3 verse 22
[1:25:54] the bible says and the lord god saying
[1:25:57] behold the man
[1:25:58] is become as one of us to know good and
[1:26:02] water
[1:26:03] so if you already know good and evil you
[1:26:05] know which tree you already beat on
[1:26:07] about here
[1:26:09] and now lest he put forth his hand
[1:26:12] and take also of the tree of life
[1:26:15] and eat and live forever amen
[1:26:19] god block the access to the tree of life
[1:26:23] by putting the kerry beams with a sword
[1:26:26] of flaming fire
[1:26:27] so now from this point on
[1:26:30] men cannot live eternally
[1:26:34] anybody follow me now your life circle
[1:26:39] started by birth because when god
[1:26:42] created adam
[1:26:44] adam was not created like a baby
[1:26:48] adam was created a full mature man
[1:26:51] eve was created a full mature woman
[1:26:54] but through this death that entered the
[1:26:57] human race
[1:26:58] now they're coming into the life you
[1:27:01] have to come through
[1:27:02] sex now you start as a baby
[1:27:06] and it's gonna take you all the way to
[1:27:08] death
[1:27:10] everybody here romans 6 23 the bible
[1:27:13] says for the wages of sin is what
[1:27:16] that's what they taught them here but
[1:27:18] the gift of god
[1:27:20] is eternalized through who
[1:27:24] that's why brother branham said the tree
[1:27:26] of life was crossed
[1:27:28] because christ is the one that have
[1:27:30] eternal life
[1:27:32] and if you want to have eternal life you
[1:27:34] must go into christ
[1:27:36] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:27:39] name of the lord
[1:27:40] now in genesis 5 verse
[1:27:45] 5 and verse 27 when death was entered
[1:27:49] into the human race some people begin to
[1:27:52] die early
[1:27:54] maybe by murdering like evil some will
[1:27:57] die
[1:27:58] in an old age amen but when we look at
[1:28:02] adam who started in the garden of eden
[1:28:05] how many years did adam leave the bible
[1:28:08] says that and all the days
[1:28:11] that adam leave where 930 years
[1:28:15] and he did water he died so
[1:28:18] adam who started in the garden of eden
[1:28:23] adam the best he could do was
[1:28:26] 900 and one and thirty years
[1:28:29] in other words adam never reached a
[1:28:32] thousand years
[1:28:33] ago everybody here
[1:28:37] in other words he never made a day with
[1:28:40] god
[1:28:41] in verse 27 the bible says
[1:28:44] and all the days of methuselah
[1:28:48] were 969
[1:28:52] the only man that went higher than
[1:28:55] anybody on planet earth
[1:28:59] was mature and his ears
[1:29:02] were 960 water but still
[1:29:06] that was below a thousand years anybody
[1:29:09] clear
[1:29:10] so in other words nobody have ever lived
[1:29:14] a thousand year on earth brother branham
[1:29:18] says this
[1:29:19] that he said a man would never leave
[1:29:22] that time out a year or a day
[1:29:26] the day you eat thereof the day you die
[1:29:29] adam or methuselah was the oldest
[1:29:33] man that ever lived in the bible and he
[1:29:37] was 969
[1:29:39] years old and he never lived that
[1:29:42] thousand years
[1:29:44] but the man that is going to live
[1:29:46] through the millennium
[1:29:49] ever here one thousand years
[1:29:53] to show that the penalty has been water
[1:29:58] ever clear even though jesus went to the
[1:30:01] cross
[1:30:02] and died despite the fact that jesus
[1:30:05] went
[1:30:06] into the cross and that we are still
[1:30:08] dying before a thousand years
[1:30:10] so god have pro have planned
[1:30:14] a certain time period that everybody
[1:30:17] that is going to be redeemed
[1:30:19] will live through that to prove to men
[1:30:22] that redemption was effective why
[1:30:25] because
[1:30:26] one day with the lord is how many years
[1:30:31] how many know that
[1:30:34] few people let's go to the scripture
[1:30:39] yeah if there were a lot we will skip it
[1:30:43] psalm chapter 90.
[1:30:49] everybody clear let's go to the book of
[1:30:51] psalms
[1:30:52] 90. somebody need to do a lot of reading
[1:30:58] of the scripture and a lot of listening
[1:31:00] to the table
[1:31:02] somnandi if you there you can say amen
[1:31:06] verse 4 psalm
[1:31:10] 9 0. anybody clear
[1:31:14] verse 4 for a water
[1:31:17] a thousand year in your sat ah but
[1:31:20] as what when it is passed
[1:31:23] and as a watch in the a thousand years
[1:31:27] scripture to god is how many days
[1:31:31] let's go to second peter chapter three
[1:31:36] amen don't worry we're gonna get there
[1:31:40] ii peter chapter three if you dare you
[1:31:43] can say amen
[1:31:46] if this light is making you sleepy
[1:31:48] please turn it on
[1:31:54] ii peter chapter 3 verse 8 if you dare
[1:31:56] you can say amen amen
[1:31:58] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:32:02] thing
[1:32:03] that one day is with the lord as a water
[1:32:09] and a thousand years as water
[1:32:12] so nobody from adam up to now
[1:32:16] even the lord jesus christ himself
[1:32:20] nobody reach a thousand years and
[1:32:23] brother branham now is saying that
[1:32:25] but that demand that is going to live
[1:32:28] through the millennium
[1:32:29] 1000 year to show that the penalty has
[1:32:33] been paid
[1:32:34] man lives forever the day
[1:32:37] is finished the time is finished
[1:32:40] they are in water eternity take
[1:32:43] revelation chapter 20
[1:32:47] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:32:51] revelation chapter 20 verse 5
[1:32:54] who is going to be in the millennium
[1:32:56] remember that sunday
[1:32:58] god wants his entire blood to be water
[1:33:02] praise god somebody remember pretty good
[1:33:06] revelation 20 verse 5 but the rest of
[1:33:09] the dead
[1:33:12] leave not again until the thousand years
[1:33:16] were
[1:33:17] finished this is the first resurrection
[1:33:21] so there is a first resurrection
[1:33:24] and there is a second resurrection back
[1:33:27] home pretty good because we might get
[1:33:29] into those mysteries
[1:33:31] amen verse six blessed
[1:33:35] and holy is he that has put
[1:33:38] in the first resurrection which is the
[1:33:42] rapture
[1:33:45] everybody clear if you sleeping shake
[1:33:48] somebody else because i can see who's
[1:33:50] sleeping
[1:33:51] amen this is the first blessed is
[1:33:55] blessed and holy is he that has part in
[1:33:58] the first resurrection
[1:34:00] on such the second death
[1:34:03] maybe the second banquet might push this
[1:34:05] far away
[1:34:06] there is a first death
[1:34:10] and there is a second death
[1:34:13] maybe when we get in a second banquet we
[1:34:16] might dig into that
[1:34:18] and you're going to see what do they
[1:34:19] mean and i'm going to explain it down
[1:34:21] there because you're going to see
[1:34:22] armageddon
[1:34:23] and gog and magog agnes amen
[1:34:26] blessed and holy is he that has part in
[1:34:29] the first resurrection
[1:34:31] on such that person the second death has
[1:34:34] no power in other words they're not
[1:34:35] going to experience the second death
[1:34:38] but there shall be water
[1:34:42] so those that are going to be in the
[1:34:44] millennium are priests
[1:34:49] and king because they must
[1:34:52] reign in the millennium that's why you
[1:34:55] are prison king
[1:34:57] now exercising the authority
[1:35:01] and in the millennium it will be
[1:35:02] automatic
[1:35:04] amen but they shall be preached of god
[1:35:08] and of christ and shall reign with him
[1:35:10] how many years
[1:35:13] a thousand years that's what brother
[1:35:15] branham is saying here
[1:35:17] so now from the beginning that we start
[1:35:20] nobody reach a thousand years everybody
[1:35:23] is dying somewhere
[1:35:25] why because men beat on the wrong tree
[1:35:28] everybody clear so much
[1:35:29] so far in genesis 6
[1:35:33] verse 1 uh 1-3
[1:35:36] the bible says and it came to pass when
[1:35:38] men began to multiply
[1:35:40] on the face of the earth and the
[1:35:42] daughters were born unto them
[1:35:44] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:35:47] of men that they were fair
[1:35:49] and they took them wives we already
[1:35:51] explained to you that there were many
[1:35:52] women
[1:35:53] of which they choose we explain you this
[1:35:56] and the lord say my spirit
[1:35:59] shall not always strive with men
[1:36:02] so before this period of time people
[1:36:05] could live
[1:36:06] 900 years 800 years 700 years
[1:36:10] but nobody could reach a thousand years
[1:36:12] but because sin
[1:36:14] begin to multiply and to reach a point
[1:36:17] that is
[1:36:18] highest on the face of the earth god
[1:36:21] now shortened even the time that you
[1:36:24] have to leave
[1:36:25] no more you shall live 900 years 500
[1:36:29] years
[1:36:29] 800 years 600 years at the beginning
[1:36:32] you can leave any kind of years that you
[1:36:35] want
[1:36:36] only you're not gonna get a thousand
[1:36:38] years because redemption is not done yet
[1:36:42] when jesus christ came he shed his blood
[1:36:46] he brought the redemption of your soul
[1:36:49] but your body still have the black dog
[1:36:53] you need to go in the second banquet
[1:36:56] to kick the black dog out then you are
[1:37:00] fully redeemed and god ushering
[1:37:03] through the seventh hill the interest
[1:37:06] into the millennium
[1:37:08] so that you can have your person here
[1:37:11] you cannot have the thousand years with
[1:37:14] the black dog on your body everybody
[1:37:20] clear
[1:37:21] because before sin entered the black dog
[1:37:24] was sealed out
[1:37:26] and god want to seal the black dog
[1:37:28] completely
[1:37:29] but in order to complete redemption you
[1:37:32] need
[1:37:33] a capstone ministry that is going to
[1:37:36] bring
[1:37:36] the cloud and the coming of the lord
[1:37:40] to change your body then you a candidate
[1:37:43] to go leave a thousand years
[1:37:45] anybody care so far god begin to give
[1:37:49] people 900 years
[1:37:52] if he's a murderer you're going to
[1:37:54] suffer for 900 years
[1:37:56] he will be killing for 900 years
[1:38:00] if he's a fornicator your children will
[1:38:03] suffer for 900 years
[1:38:05] god say too much i'm gonna shorten now
[1:38:09] that
[1:38:10] how much lord and the lord say my spirit
[1:38:13] shall not always strive with men for
[1:38:16] that he also
[1:38:17] is flesh yet his days
[1:38:21] shall be a hundred and a what
[1:38:25] now no more 906 years
[1:38:28] we drop down to 120 years
[1:38:31] which is way below
[1:38:35] 8 000 years
[1:38:38] people begin to go 114
[1:38:41] 105 no problem man
[1:38:44] still continue to sin in psalm 90 verse
[1:38:48] 10
[1:38:49] the bible says now david comes and david
[1:38:53] open up
[1:38:54] a shortening again in other words
[1:38:56] because
[1:38:57] men continue to do wickedly god
[1:39:00] take it and shorten that again
[1:39:04] the days of our years are water
[1:39:07] three score years and ten a score
[1:39:11] in the bible is 20 years
[1:39:17] so three score is what 60 years
[1:39:21] anybody clear 60 years
[1:39:24] and 10. in other words we move from 120
[1:39:29] and to utter unto 70.
[1:39:33] ever here come on and if by reason of
[1:39:36] strength
[1:39:38] there be how many four how many score
[1:39:41] in other words if god is a little bit
[1:39:44] gracious to you
[1:39:48] you can go up to eddie
[1:39:51] amen one time god told the king
[1:39:56] to prepare himself to die
[1:40:01] you got that and the king went and
[1:40:03] prayed unto god
[1:40:06] even though the time of god was
[1:40:08] determined
[1:40:10] for that king but god added 15 more
[1:40:14] years
[1:40:15] that's why despite the fact that
[1:40:18] it was 120 or it's 70
[1:40:21] you will see some people going 94 and
[1:40:24] they died
[1:40:25] it is just god in his sovereign will
[1:40:28] extending that
[1:40:29] everybody here so if grace
[1:40:32] gets you you're going to go to ab
[1:40:36] if not grace the normal year is
[1:40:39] 70. so we move
[1:40:43] from a thousand to below a thousand
[1:40:46] then we go below 200. now we got below a
[1:40:50] hundred
[1:40:52] so the new set now is 70 years
[1:40:56] everybody clear and the number 70
[1:41:00] have the number seven with it
[1:41:05] and you have the number zero
[1:41:08] anybody here and seven
[1:41:11] two zero you gotta take it ten times
[1:41:15] everybody clear so far in other words
[1:41:18] 70 have 10 7.

[1:41:27] you're gonna reach seven then you go
[1:41:29] another seven
[1:41:31] then you go another seven then you go

[1:43:52] blessed be the name of the lord in the
[1:43:55] message
[1:43:56] indictment brother branham said now eat
[1:43:59] it

[1:44:24] were not just aware of it
[1:44:26] because you didn't know where are you
[1:44:28] going
[1:44:29] brother stephen in the scripture
[1:44:32] in deuteronomy 15 verse 1 god
[1:44:36] told moses that at the end of water
[1:44:40] every seven years that shall make a
[1:44:43] water
[1:44:44] god when he was dealing with israel
[1:44:48] before the 70 70
[1:44:51] years to give the rest the full rest to
[1:44:55] the promised land
[1:44:56] god told israel for some reason
[1:44:59] that we don't know every seven years
[1:45:02] release something every seven years
[1:45:06] release something every seven years we
[1:45:08] release something and brother branham

[1:45:34] and when he says serve these six years
[1:45:38] that shall let him go free from the from
[1:45:41] thee
[1:45:41] in other words when you take a hebrew
[1:45:43] slave and he worked for you for six
[1:45:46] years
[1:45:46] on the seventh year you must give him a
[1:45:49] jubilee trumpet
[1:45:52] because god watches seven seven
[1:45:55] seven seven and he put seven ten times

[1:46:04] heard brother branham seven
[1:46:06] times seven forty nine hey mark here
[1:46:10] what is going on despite the fact
[1:46:13] now that our lifetime
[1:46:17] ever clear have started from

[1:46:25] and it's divided by many seventy
[1:46:28] ever clear about here

[1:46:57] two events
[1:46:59] when they shoot them they're gonna shoot
[1:47:02] higher
[1:47:03] and go down and when you continue
[1:47:06] one is gonna shoot again higher you
[1:47:09] continue
[1:47:09] and you got to the end
[1:47:13] in the message indictment brother

[1:59:33] more beautiful than before
[1:59:38] the one that causes that transformation
[1:59:43] chemical in the body called hormone
[1:59:52] ever here those chemicals
[1:59:56] are the one responsible for the new
[1:59:59] sex characteristic that is appearing
[2:00:02] they are messenger that are building the
[2:00:04] body different

[2:01:13] clove you also with water
[2:01:17] at the first time on verse 8 she was
[2:01:21] clothed with
[2:01:22] the government of god
[2:01:26] it was a spiritual clothing
[2:01:29] ever here verse 10 is the natural
[2:01:33] clothing ever clear because in
[2:01:36] revelation 10
[2:01:38] when man was created first in the garden

[2:02:47] god forbid knowing not that he
[2:02:51] which is john to the harlot is one body

[2:02:58] but he that is john unto the lord is
[2:03:01] what
[2:03:03] your first marriage is a marriage with
[2:03:06] christ
[2:03:09] that marriage gives you the character
[2:03:14] and the wisdom that you need

[2:06:23] in the song of solomon chapter 8 solomon
[2:06:27] says this
[2:06:28] set me as a seal upon the heart
[2:06:32] as a seal upon that armor for love
[2:06:35] failure is strong as water
[2:06:40] jealousy there is no jealousy in agape

[2:33:35] being upset without knowing
[2:33:39] the devil entering and begin to cause
[2:33:42] trouble hey but clear
[2:33:45] remember that this beauty here
[2:33:49] and adolescence was caused by water
[2:33:53] and it's maintained by water and
[2:33:56] menopause hormones are not dead
[2:34:00] so that glow that was accompanying you
[2:34:05] especially when you have a baby it seems
[2:34:07] like a woman
[2:34:08] develop again more down glow
[2:34:11] begin to vanish and
[2:34:15] begin to fade away the devil
[2:34:19] coming into your mind telling you you
[2:34:22] are now old
[2:34:24] you don't look good anymore
[2:34:31] and because of that lie the trouble
[2:34:35] that happened at puberty
[2:34:39] amen begin to be manifested
[2:34:43] in menopause that's why
[2:34:46] their older sister changed her dresses
[2:34:52] she make herself looks now sexy
[2:34:55] because something is telling her
[2:34:59] you passed your error is finished
[2:35:07] hallelujah during that time she's got
[2:35:11] her menopause sometimes especially
[2:35:14] either come in
[2:35:16] or what when you entering into the water
[2:35:19] of menopause
[2:35:22] and when you want to come out of it amen
[2:35:26] make the people so nervous
[2:35:30] and she never been able to pull through
[2:35:33] that so some people
[2:35:34] get in the water and stay there that's
[2:35:37] the woman with the issue of blood
[2:35:39] 12 years she's still going through that
[2:35:42] circle
[2:35:43] some get the lord help you you out
[2:35:46] everybody the woman thinks
[2:35:50] sometimes that she's what and she watto
[2:35:55] and she is a pentecostal believer i
[2:35:58] think so
[2:35:59] but the lady had wearing water
[2:36:02] and water and water
[2:36:06] but the reason she had did that
[2:36:09] she was trying to shake from that
[2:36:12] trying to shake away from that horrible
[2:36:14] water
[2:36:16] that's why you see a woman going back
[2:36:18] and begin to try
[2:36:19] to make her want the compliment like a
[2:36:22] young lady
[2:36:23] she begin to wear pink stuff and all
[2:36:25] kinds of stuff it's

[2:36:29] somebody's telling her
[2:36:30] you don't look good like you used to
[2:36:33] because hormones are gone
[2:36:36] and now she's trying to counteract it by
[2:36:39] trying to make herself beautiful she
[2:36:41] begins to have the same trouble
[2:36:43] that you have in adolescence
[2:36:48] america did it mean you don't have to
[2:36:51] look good

[2:37:11] of it in the prayer line so the thing

[2:43:26] and you want somebody for anybody clear
[2:43:29] so far
[2:43:32] let's stand
[2:43:43] [Applause]
[2:43:46] when you go through the water they're
[2:43:49] not gonna submerge you
[2:43:51] when you go through the fire the fire
[2:43:54] won't burn you
[2:43:55] if you are connected with christ
[2:43:58] amen it's too explosion in your life
[2:44:03] you gotta go through you're gonna go
[2:44:04] every seven years something is changing
[2:44:07] seven years something is changing but
[2:44:08] you're gonna hit the time
[2:44:10] where you're gonna go through puberty is
[2:44:12] gonna put you on fire
[2:44:14] young people if you connected with
[2:44:16] christ
[2:44:17] you're going to go through this without
[2:44:19] any problem but if you are not connected
[2:44:22] with crust
[2:44:24] you're going to go through smoking
[2:44:26] you're going to go through whiskey
[2:44:29] you're going to go through beer and all
[2:44:31] those stuff
[2:44:33] it's like you putting gas into the fire
[2:44:38] amen and it's gonna mess you up
[2:44:40] completely
[2:44:43] and god will rescue you but with a lot
[2:44:45] of scar
[2:44:47] amen but if you have not gone through
[2:44:50] that yet
[2:44:51] or you just went and had trouble cling
[2:44:54] on to crusty
[2:44:56] you're gonna go through this and you're
[2:44:58] gonna get stabilized
[2:44:59] and you go to your marital life and
[2:45:01] everything goes well
[2:45:03] and later on it's gonna shoot up again
[2:45:06] you go into the water but whether you go
[2:45:09] through the fire
[2:45:10] or through the water all of them are
[2:45:12] covered
[2:45:13] in the atonement if you can just accept
[2:45:16] it
[2:45:16] and believe it and never give place to
[2:45:19] the devil
[2:45:20] no matter what you go through you say
[2:45:23] god you say it's not gonna burn me
[2:45:25] it's not gonna submerge me you already
[2:45:27] provided a way for escape
[2:45:29] it's just a period of time it's just
[2:45:32] like a lady who had pregnancy
[2:45:34] she's gonna go through headache through
[2:45:36] certain things but the scripture says
[2:45:38] when she deliver the baby
[2:45:40] she's gonna forget all the other stuff
[2:45:42] once you go
[2:45:43] through it you're going to realize
[2:45:45] you're not old as you think
[2:45:47] you're going to realize you're still
[2:45:48] beautiful you're going to realize that
[2:45:50] like the scripture say is bringing you
[2:45:52] to a wealthy
[2:45:54] place not to a place of sorrow and
[2:45:57] trouble
[2:45:57] amen if the lord willing i will see how
[2:46:00] i can get it
[2:46:01] rebecca went through this fire and
[2:46:04] brother
[2:46:05] branham and his wife committed rebecca
[2:46:08] to christ
[2:46:09] and brother branham said before you know
[2:46:11] it george smith came up
[2:46:13] [Music]
[2:46:15] amen there is a no an oasis that pop up
[2:46:20] and pick you up and you go to your
[2:46:21] marriage and when you go to your
[2:46:23] marriage you're going to go through the
[2:46:24] water
[2:46:25] if you stick with christ after the water
[2:46:28] you're going to see that your couple
[2:46:31] will reach a different level
[2:46:34] you're going to find out that your
[2:46:35] marriage is going to get more sweeter
[2:46:38] than even when you started before if you
[2:46:41] cross
[2:46:42] the water amen you're gonna find out
[2:46:46] that your husband began to understand
[2:46:48] you better than before
[2:46:50] for some reason and you begin to say
[2:46:53] i wish all my marriage would even
[2:46:55] started like this
[2:46:56] because the scripture says when you come
[2:46:58] out of water you're gonna come into a
[2:47:00] wealthy place
[2:47:02] amen because when you start a marriage
[2:47:04] you didn't have kids
[2:47:07] amen when you reach the water your kids
[2:47:10] are almost
[2:47:11] gone away from you you go back again
[2:47:14] like a renewal of vow
[2:47:16] you go into a new cycle of marriage
[2:47:19] where
[2:47:19] you and your husband going to the beach
[2:47:22] going here
[2:47:23] going to the mall that's why you see all
[2:47:26] the people holding their head
[2:47:27] themselves in the hand you don't
[2:47:29] understand they become
[2:47:31] more keen together than what they were
[2:47:33] before
[2:47:34] and sometimes one goes away first it
[2:47:37] won't take too long the second one might
[2:47:39] follow
[2:47:39] because what happened after that is a
[2:47:42] relationship
[2:47:43] closer than even their own brother
[2:47:47] they'll feel more like they belong to
[2:47:49] each other
[2:47:50] like they can't live without one another
[2:47:53] it happened more
[2:47:55] after you go through the water god
[2:47:58] is not the author of confusion after
[2:48:01] this pressure
[2:48:02] there is always something better after
[2:48:05] this pressure
[2:48:06] there is always something better after
[2:48:08] the rain there is always
[2:48:10] a beautiful time the sun will shine

[2:49:49] that you send this truth so that the
[2:49:52] devil would not ride again in the life
[2:49:54] of your children
[2:49:55] father so that we will not open any door
[2:49:58] to the devil
[2:49:59] and to find ourself fighting and
[2:50:01] suffering some illness lord
[2:50:03] because of lack of knowledge lord father

[2:50:08] to free your children and to bring a
[2:50:10] complete deliverance lord
[2:50:12] and for those that are suffering or

[2:50:20] was wrong with them
[2:50:22] or they are already in the middle of
[2:50:24] menopause and they can't shake away
[2:50:26] or since they went through menopause
[2:50:28] there is something in their body
[2:50:30] that is no more no longer quite right
[2:50:32] since they went through this time
[2:50:34] something went wrong and it's still like
[2:50:37] a condition
[2:50:38] that they are condoning that they think
[2:50:40] it's normal
[2:50:41] that they should bear the rest of their
[2:50:43] life father if there is any young man
[2:50:46] any young woman that went through this
[2:50:48] trouble and because of the background
[2:50:50] or the way that they were breed or the
[2:50:53] way lord father they grew up
[2:50:54] they didn't have somebody to lord father
[2:50:57] train
[2:50:58] or help them lord but they found
[2:51:00] themselves as
[2:51:01] victim of circumstances victim of
[2:51:04] passion
[2:51:05] victim of the trouble of menopause or
[2:51:07] the trouble

[2:51:34] entering
[2:51:35] that brought in a spirit of being a
[2:51:37] spirit of smoking
[2:51:39] a spirit of lust a spirit of lord
[2:51:42] fornication
