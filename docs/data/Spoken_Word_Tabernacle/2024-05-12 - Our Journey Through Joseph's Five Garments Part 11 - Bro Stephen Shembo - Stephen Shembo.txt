if somebody want to enjoy enjoy sing singing so don't look at your clock take your clock your watch put it under somewhere and let's enjoy Mother's Day amen Genesis 39 verse1 you there my friend amen okay let's clim and Joseph was brought down down not brought up down because the way up is always down amen you enter the pyramid you go down you remember the pyramid in the hotel amen amen you remember the pyramid we went through the Pyramid of Giza we enter inside the pyramid you know that you remember that yes sir okay so when you enter you're going down somebody forgot about the pyramid okay praise God so he was going down to Egypt and Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian brought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down there you might be seated and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man none of this was displayed in the land of Canaan so you know when you're moving in the right direction God will prosper you I gave you the coat last Sunday and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand in other words somebody acknowledg the presence of the Lord and the blessing of the Lord an Egyptian an another worshipper never got jealous that's right that's right he never fought Joseph amen he never look up he say oh God is working with this man let's fight him he look he say no no no no God is working with this man that's an advantage for me let him actually take over my life and I can relax and he's doing the work amen amen you might fight your very Deliverance that's right the woman at the well was fighting Jesus Christ almost and Jesus looked at her and said if you know who's asking you will be the one asking for us sometime be careful who you fighting amen amen uh be careful who you fighting you can find yourself fighting your own blessing amen amen amen just acknowledge what God is doing and he will bless you amen amen he says and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand so there was some restriction at the beginning there were certain rooms that Joseph could not access but as as P for notice the ministry of this man notice Christ in the life of Joseph he begin to open certain doors that he didn't want to open at the beginning amen so that Christ can affect Joseph can affect those area Joseph Christ can affect every area and as soon as you give him the preeminence everything work together for good amen amen verse five and the Bible says and he came to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house when you give Christ the preeminence and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptian house now the house is blessed the whole house you want your house to be blessed open up to Christ amen the Lord blessed the Egyptian house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field he had permeated every aspect of this person's life verse six and he left all that he had in Joseph hand and he knew not anything he had save the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored we are still in the house of Piper let's go to Luke Chapter n please amen Luke chapter 9 verse 51 so we stopped somewhere with this scripture when we started with James and John that's where we got stuck last week in a traffic we trying to see if we can get off the traffic this morning if you there you can say amen amen verse 51 and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem amen amen and sent messenger before his face and they went and enter into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem you going to brother so and so Church we're not going to receive you because we don't have any dealings with that church I'm just reading the Bible you going into Jerusalem the Jews and the Samaritan no dealings we're not going to receive you amen amen verse 53 and they did not receive him because his Fai was as though he would go to Jerusalem how can you even look at the langu at the bad language of somebody and you know that he's going to Jerusalem the appearance they just look at the face this one is going to Jerusalem we don't have to deal with him do you see how carnal people get sometime they didn't even ask him they just look at the face uh he looks like one of those guys we don't want to deal with him and when his disciple James and John My two friend they can't take it James and John when the two disciple James and John you know what he means now when the two disciple James which means what love hope hope and John who means what love now you got that right praise God James and John when they say uh and when his disciple James and John saw this they say Lord will you that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elijah did the ministry of Elijah that power of the spoken word that Elijah say fire come down they say oh praise God this is now an opportunity to use the third pole let's roast them very well let's barbecue them very well we got a reason amen kill him all amen amen they need the me they are pulling upon the anointing of Elijah come on amen amen to avenge thems against somebody and that was the test they put on brother Bram two young men in the church God say be careful with that third pool watch out with that third pool and they begin to make love in the church what a disrespect to the higher level and the anointing come and say whatever you say if you want them taken dead go ahead and say it that's right and the Capstone prevail yes he say I forgive you amen amen glory to God verse 55 and he turned and rebuked them he didn't say praise the Lord you guys now are ready for the third pole sir in other words you immature for the third pole you're not even ready yet amen he rebuked them and said you know not what manner of spirit you are of for the son of man that Ministry of the son of man is not come to destroy his man life but he comes to save them and they went to another Village the ministry of William Maran Bram came to save life not to destroy people amen amen in other words you're not ready yet to handle such a power but they were calling on the power from the ministry of Elijah the prophet and our Elijah is William Marion Brandon what do you want to do with the third pole let's go to First Timothy chapter 3 we already pray so we can sore 1 Timothy chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen amen verse one one need to keep your Bible it sounds very strange but I'm trying to pull something from here verse one the Bible says this is a true saying if a man desire in other word is Aspire you are longing for you feel a pull in your life if I don't want to get into something here because it can strick pretty hard let me just leave it alone because you don't force somebody in an office of a pastor there must be a pool in that person an office must be desire there must be a pool you don't just take somebody like a Bergen and say you go ahead and be a pastor if he doesn't have a pool he said this is a true saying if a man desire or Aspire amen the office of a bishop Bishop is an elder there's two ways different the the the the office is the bishop and the one who enter there is the elder amen he said the office of a bishop he desire a good things so the problem is not a the office no sir the office is one thing the office is one thing the office of a bishop is one thing yes sir amen number two the pull or the desire or the aspiration that you have amen amen is another thing and Paul is saying if you desire this office it's good you didn't sin there is nothing wrong with it that's it's a good thing to Aspire very good good thing but where is the problem to Aspire to desire is one thing are we together but to qualify for that office that's the problem anybody can desire it but do you qualify for it that's one more thing the problem is the qualification what are the qualification of a Bishop Paul say you desire good I want to be a president amen am I want to have a 2 [Music] million okay do you have what it takes to handle $2 million I want to get married okay let me turn head I want let me look at those that are married already ah he's already married I want to get married do you qualify to get married brother amen do you have what it takes to be married you you are you are Desiring a good thing there is nothing wrong about you saying I want to get married there is nothing go bad about saying I want a wife actually when you do that we say the boy is working pretty good when we look at you we say he's normal but do you qualify it's another thing brother if you stop having some pool we say oh he's

Egypt I'm going to work so everybody get to the Rapture when I sweat like this you must get into the rapture [Applause] I'm not going to leave anyone of you nobody's staying behind we all going into the Exodus amen amen amen amen glory to God I keep putting this scripture a lot galatian 4 verse 1 and two the Bible says Paul says that now I say that the heir as long as he's a child thater nothing from a slave though he be Lord of all I'm insisting in this scripture because this scripture give us the full review the full the plain picture of what the process is and how God operate in our life according to the scripture the first thing we see is that we are here we are air meaning somebody has an inheritance amen you have a throne that you have to inherit yes sir amen when you born you born the king of the Jews right there by birth you already have a a position and even before the foundation of the world you already have a position and according to Paul Paul said that this air is Lord of all he's the Lord of everything everything already Belong To You amen amen amen but you are still a baby amen amen Paul say a there as long as he's a child he def nothing from a servant the second thing here Paul is showing us is a n is a child in other word he's immature we clear number three Paul says that you got to go under the hand of a tutor or a governor or a mentor or a teacher and that is according to an appoint appointed time there is an appointed time from the father amen and that is for your training am we clear and if you look here on the word chart brother Robert if I can get another one please the Bible says that the heir as long as he is a child I highlighted that in red because the level of mat maturity that you have will determine about where you should go amen amen amen are we are we together amen Paul is saying that as long as you are a child automatically if people look at you you look like a slave that's right amen as long as you are like a child you are a servant amen so your age AG amen amen is determining how far you should go amen are we together amen your age is determining how far you should go based on the knowledge that you have are we together and the experience that you have amen amen amen if you are air that's not the problem but how old are you amen amen amen amen if you are a that's F how old are you in Christ amen when were you converted because Paul said the office of a bishop do not put an office right there because it's an office of an elder amen amen am somebody who had some knowledge amen somebody who had some experience amen and Paul is saying here if you a child even though you are heir of of everything even though we know you have a position still you are qualified or you are taken as a slave that's right are we together let's go to First Corinthians chapter 3 as we building soon it's going to stck home 1 Corinthians chapter 3 if you there you can say Amen 1 Corinthians 3 verse one you there amen the Bible say and I Brethren could not speak to you as to spiritual this is Paul but as to who caral even as to who babes in Christ Paul say I cannot speak to you like spiritual people because you're still carnal and because you Conor I'm going to talk to you like babes are we together amen Paul continue he say I I have fed you with what milk and not with what me so your age determine your diet amen that's right amen that's right amen are we together amen because you immature we need to give you milk amen we can't give you a steak because you see a baby follow me carefully he say I have fed you with milk and not with meat for before you were not able to do what bu it neither yet now are you able to what in other word if I give you milk it won't work for you because you are not at the age to handle certain things am that's right that's why we we we we address you like a servant that's why mama is on top of you that's right that's why Mama have to chase you because you are immature yet even though you think you know a lot it but you don't know yet because your age is determining how your brain is functioning there is brother are we together amen let's go to Hebrew chapter 5 glory to God Amen Hebrews chap 5: 11 if you there you can say amen amen Paul says this he says of whom we have many thing to say we there yes and heart to be what utter seeing you are how du of hearing in other words even though we tell you you want understand amen amen go get baby Joel sit with baby Joel and explain her how to build a credit card I will even buy you a lunch for you to continue explaining here and when you finish he will be looking at you smiling and go to sleep because her brand her level of maturity cannot handle credit card stuff that's right that's right everybody okay am everybody okay I seen young children turn around and say Daddy Cann I drive a car and daddy say no you cannot drive a car because you're 10 years old because your level of maturity you cannot drive a car amen if we ever give you a car before you know it the police the ambulance 911 is right there because somebody hit the tree that's right are we together that's why we got to watch if you put a seat belt did you put your seat belt yes we turn around go ahead and put the seat belt because the level of maturity is still low are we together amen Paul says for when for the time you ought to be how teachers you have need that one teach you again which which be the what first principles of the Oracles of God and now be come such as have need of what milk and not what of strong meat because of your level I cannot move deeper into the word because if I move deeper in the word you are lost completely and this block Minister sometime because the church have been fed so much on milk amen amen 20 years they keep giving the church milk milk milk milk milk milk milk all the time and the day another preacher come and he's trying to take off the church is completely lost because the church never dive into the deep are we together are we together am are we together we want Pentecostal sermons but not the message sermon if you start talking about the four anointing and the 24 they say where is he coming from with all this kind of stuff because the pastor himself is on milk are we together the pastor himself is sucking milk for years and what is he going to give you nothing but milk and the church cannot grow how can you take a 17 years old and give him milk from the morning all the way to the evening he needs some hamburger am he need to chew on something bigger amen he need a whole pizza amen are we together amen glory to God jump to verse 13 for everyone that uses milk is how unskillful unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is how obey but what strong meat belongs to them that are what of full age even to those by reason are we together of you have their sense how exercise to what discern both good and evil so if you are immature there is certain there are certain things God won't give you amen amen not that God doesn't want to give it to you but you are not ready yet you are not at the position at the level that you should be to handle whatever you want amen God can give you whatever you want but God is so gracious to us that he look and he say at this stage this one if I give him this one he's going to get lost amen you need to grow into some maturity and Paul is saying here that as long as he is a child so your age is what is blocking you amen are we together amen your lack of experience your lack of knowledge your immaturity will slow down your adoption amen amen are we together are we together why Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 13 He says when I was a what a child did what I spake as a child and I did what understood as a child and I did what thought as a child so your brain your childish brain will permeate your speech amen amen amen are we together amen it will affect your understanding amen it will affect your thinking in other word you cannot think more than you can handle that's right everybody okay if you an adult your are open up but if you a child your speech will betray you your understanding will betray you the way you thinking the way you process thing will affect you and because of that b God who is rich in Mercy put you under a tutor amen he put you under somebody who's going to Mentor you amen who's going to train you amen who will prepare you for your future task amen that's right amen brother Bram says this in the message God projecting his love brother Bram says sometime ago over in I believe

whenever he's driving and he look at the ice cream say I will meet you another day amen and the other was what a stamp collector down the street which he knew how very well the second thought is the stamp collector that he knew very well why the stamp collector because this is how where he's going to turn his stamp into a purchase power into money so he managed very well he knows where to get the money and he also have a project but the problem is the level of his project is an ice cream but let's see the potential am amen I hope you're following me now amen I hope you are with me amen his thought is ice cream amen very good according to your knowledge Amen in another way in another sense he's looking at how to get the money so the brain is working very good but there is a big problem amen amen he lack sufficient knowledge amen right here brother and experience to decode what he have found in the Artic amen amen amen are we together amen he's thinking that he's playing with a little po stamp he doesn't know the value of the post the level of maturity will determine the outcome of this boy the Boy didn't know what he has in his hand that it's more than scream amen this is why you need to know what is this message amen what is this word that you have [Applause] receiv is a message to give us big houses is the message to give us marriages to give us wife to give us friend what is the message the level of your knowledge amen my people perish amen for lack of [Music] what the best way to keep a church dumb I'm going to say it because I don't have a bishop the best way to keep people dam is to lock knowledge amen remove the ministry of the teaching amen and you can play with the congregation for years that's right brother amen because the people don't know their right they don't know what belongs to them am they don't know what they're having but when teaching come he opened the eyes of the people amen they begin to check the pastor they check the Deacon they check the truste they check the church and the pastor don't want that he want you to remain dumb [Applause] brother Kelly I don't know what to do how many time did we preach Church order to show people how how the offic is operate so you got somebody 30 years they just know that the Deacon is somebody who hat you and who come and move you all the time in the church they never even understand how the office of a Deon when was the last time we T that what is the office of Pastor how should a trustee behave how should a musician behave how should a song leader behave because we don't know we just moving in confusion confusion amen amen amen are we together yes sir are we together amen are we together amen are you the one exceeding me and I'm trying to go back to the highway okay so this boy here we found out that he managed to get the money he knows that I got my right there we friend every time he goes he say Mr Peter Mr Peter God bless you Mr P I just pick up Peter for some reason God bless you God bless you you say we got good friend so if I go there give this I'm going to get it what I have in mind as soon as I get this straight to the ice cream he never thought about his mother is are we amen he never thought about hey if I get this thing right here no I need to show Mom Mom Mom where are you look at this what is this no when he gathered he forgot about mom because he knows everything he doesn't want to tell Daddy because Daddy is very complicated H I don't know why it's coming brother KY I won't talk to Daddy D is very complicated a small M like this he will make it a big deal so let me hand that am my way I already have a relationship with the stamp collector I can go get my money sleep down the street get some ice cream finish them before you get home you whistling ice cream is in there everybody okay boy what did you find in the Attic what do you have in your hand come on and watch the level of your brain how will it affect your destiny can I continue brother Bram say he grabbed a little one in half inch square stem just a what a letter or two written on it of written on it very fly from what age and down the street he went how quickly so mama just was sitting there maybe cooking he just see where you going I'll be back mom mama say okay maybe he's going to John house over there playing the boy got a mission amen amen and brother Bram say he went there and say how much will he give me for this temp The Collector look at it under what a glass and he knew he had what age on it the little fellow expecting to collect how much the 5 cents for an ice cream oh the boy was worrying about is five C are we are we together are we together amen 5 cents 5 cents that's all I need you give me 5 cents thank you you the best tax collector stamp collector in the entire city God bless you get some ice cream and he goes to sleep and tomorrow he's not thinking are we together amen listen closely and the little fellow accepting I mean expecting to collect the five cents for what ice cream but the stamp collected bargain with him for what $1 the one who was who he supposed to be his friend saw the value of the stle and he look at the boy he said uhuh uh uh uhuh this is money right here the boy is asking $5 based off his brain based on his immaturity if I bump it a little bit quickly to $1 it will make his man his GPS is lost everybody

what are you trying to say in as long as he's a child amen he defers nothing than a slave amen because the brand of this young man if he would have talked to Mama maybe mama would have all the stamp

amen until he would have taken the entire family and changed the entire family based on what he found in adct but the condition of his brain block him he sacrificed the wealth the wealth of the family for an ice cream and this is a qu a million we don't know how much he ended up maybe he ended up to a million dollars God put a million dollars in the Attic you found it you would have saved your family but because of lack of knowledge immature brand lack of following order you should lack of following order amen if you would have stopped and say I have a papa I have a mama let me discuss with them this amen because Papa and Mama have more knowledge than you they have more experience than you they already seen many things before they can see things like the tax collector you going to be taken advantage by trying to solve your own problem when God gave you a papa God gave you a mama God gave you a pastor God Gave You Deacon by you closing things to yourself and before you know it we

you eat ice cream before you go to bed you eat cream the rest of your life am amen when he's a child that's why they put him as a slave they put him as a servant because he needs training to prepare to him because his training when it's ended it will bring you to adoption and brother Bram says this repeating this again but how much how but how can the church the Pentacles of Church the Methodist and the Baptist Church be how adopted until they come to what discipline we got to be how disciplined first God could not trust this power with who the church they give it to you ice cream on they give it to you BMW they give it to you oh you see that new Ford Explorer oh my God that thing looks so nice it R so nice you had a brand for cars somebody else will see that I can buy a new home somebody else is looking how I can go in downtown eat some meal one plate he cost $200 and post it on WhatsApp so everybody can see that I'm a big guy in there as long as he's a child you need to go under Tor brother Bram says this that now the placing of Son first thing after the sun was in he become what a son but when we found out that his what Behavior so adoption goes with two words it goes with discipline uh-huh am which is love I gave you the code and it goes with what Behavior your behavior and how much you discipline will put you into some place because a bishop if he's a noice he's

we together every step of lat life from the time you started all the way to the time you you die somebody will lead you brother Bram says this in the message leadership he says somebody help you when you made your first step and your last step you ever make in life somebody will be what leading you I want you to remember that your first step somebody will do what and your last step somebody will be what leading you so whichever way you go somebody will lead you amen we just want to make sure it's the correct person that leads you amen not your friend not your peace not your bad friend that

is good if you fool you tell me I stop because we will continue till eternity what are we dealing with this today brother stepen glory to God we talk about John and James last week and we found out that James was hope was love and the other one was Peter which were the three pillars Peter means faith and you remember the two BO that we talk about and these boys John and James grew under their father zebede Yes and Peter grew under his father I believe Jonah amen and their father trained them had to fish because the father has a business of a fisherman yes but this boy doing this business they thought that they just fall into a family that do fish's business they didn't know that God ordained that family are you following me now to prepare them for the oncoming task you remember you remember where we stopped last Sunday so when God it was time for God to come and to pick up these boys God picked up these boys saying something he didn't just come and say you know what come follow me be my disciple no Jesus acknowledged their first profession he acknowledged their job in other word God knew that they have to be trained under a certain environment under a certain task because that task will be used in the future when Joseph went down to Egypt God already prepared Piper sir he knew that the appropriate home that will train Joseph the right way toward his future position is only the house of Piper amen are we together amen so maybe when zebede was saying hey John you and James let's go work maybe somebody say ah again this morning they look their friend are playing over there they say Daddy our friend are playing over there we every day going to this Fishing Station Fishing Station all the time Fishing Station they didn't know God was using that that's right amen so when Jesus came Jesus looked at them he said come and follow me and I'm going to make you fisher of men so their fishing technique was a preparation for the gospel amen amen you say brother Steven fishing prepar somebody for the gospel brother brandham says this he said I love to fish so well and most all preachers like to fish I'm reading brother Bram I I don't I don't fabricate anything you know that is where Peter seen who the Lord one time and the Apostle when they were what fishing so God appeared to them when they were fishing I think that is the reason preacher like to fish I don't know about eating chicken now I'm reading brother Bram amen they all like about that crowing of the what rooster but God puts these people into a fishing business for a reason and even the whole kingdom of God is compared to a fishing amen Jesus says this in Matthew 13 he say again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto what a net that was what cast into the sea and gather of what every kind which when it was full they drew to the what Shore and sat down and gather the what the good into vessels but cast the bad how away so even God kingdom is given like a Fisher man going into the fish to fish amen so meaning when we preach the gospel we pull everything amen we're bringing everything to the church but the word will come from the pulit and begin to separate the good from the bad because not everything in the nest is a fish amen sometime you cut a t sometime you cut a frog and frog always go forward Looking [Applause] Backward are we together amen are we together Amen brother BR Ministry himself was divided into three pools brother Bram had the first pool healing the second pool discernment the third pool the opening of the word and God wanted to explain brother branam his ministry and knowing that brother Bram love fishing God begin to explain him through fishing amen amen are we together amen if this is getting too strong you let me know my friend amen Amen brother Bram says this he say the angel of the Lord taken me out then and he taken me to a real what bright stream of water and he was the most beautiful blue water and how many and and what kind of fish great fish was swimming around in it he said I will make you a what a Fisher Hallelujah God telling brother Bram not I will make you a preacher I will make you a Fisher brother Bram says and he says Now cast your lure into the water when you do do what pull it slow which time first time so there is a first po amen exactly are we together have I lost you sir what is he teaching brother Bram can now continue and the first time and then what next time just give it a what a little jerk not what too hard which pool is it second pool are we okay amen amen amen and then the what next time you do what set your hook for the cat which pool is what the third pool so which pool will catch the bre fish the Third po [Music] amen are we together amen are we together if you don't fish how will you understand that language listen to this I hope I didn't lose somebody brother Bram say I was standing by the side of the most beautiful Lake something like your Lake out here in the summer when it's really pretty and green and they were what fishermen all around the what the lake fishermen is what William Mario BR I had the lur in my hand and all these fishermen turned up to be what minister so a minister is a fisherman amen we okay now okay brother Bram say there were fishermen all around the lake they were fishing but they were catching what small fishes and and I look out into the lake and those great beautiful water rainbow trout out there so there were big fishes amen amen big fishes and they were little one amen this one was a rbat amen for some reason all these preacher are fishing none of them is able to catch the big one all of them are just catching the little one the little one the little one hope you won't rob somebody the wrong way brother Bram say I know this is a vision but I can understand those trat you know I believe right down where in my heart I can catch those brother Bram had a pull in his heart like you know what I can catch the big one so I pick up the string but instead of being a string it was what a fishing pole let's continue to follow brother Bram so we get really the real meaning of it brother Bram says now this he says that and just the one behind me the angel of the Lord say now I will teach you to fish how to catch what those the big one amen so he said TI on the lure and I snap The Lure on the bait he said now throw way out now listen close where out where into the deep everybody okay so to catch the big fish can I continue you need to preach in the Deep [Applause] [Music] amen are we together to catch the elect of God for this age here they don't like [Music] [Applause] shallow if you see a man running toward shallow water I doubt what is in you because the big fishes the rainbow truck they are always in the Deep amen because on the shallow water it's a confusion amen even small child can catch them amen but to get into the deep you must be professional amen everybody okay that's why when when Jesus got into the boat of Peter you remember that Sunday after he finished preaching he told Peter he said let's go lunch where why where into the water Peter say I search is you are searching on the surface let's go into the deep there is a race of fish amen amen they are not satisfied with the little if you want to catch him s them in the Deep amen are we together are we together are we together what did we fill the message churches with [Music] let me leave it alone you read between the line brother Bram say where at where into the deep and when you do now let this the do what sink down first so when you shooting you don't shoot in you you you send a deeper and when he goes into the deep you got to wait for the L to get way to the dark Zone because that's where they are hallelujah amen hallelujah amen he says and then when he sink down first you said and said do what pull it slow which pool is that first the first pool now that is a what really Fisherman's technique the angel of the Lord is using fisherman technique to explain to brother Bram he's Ministry amen can I continue amen he said then when you do now you shall feel what some nibbles at it a little some little nibble at it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it what to yourself can I continue amen can I continue amen when you start hearing something in other word don't get excited too much when the first pool begin to come Miracle are going on relax you not there yet [Music] am healing are coming into the church that's good we love it but we not there yet that's not the principle thing it's just a Manor things Divine Healing is minor brother BR said don't make your own the man it's a Pentecostal anointing amen [Applause] are we together are we together healing will be there but don't stay there too much we need to go a little bit deeper and brother Bram say when you do that he said then when you do now you feel some little what nibl it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself then when you just feel a little what nibble again who's nibbling that fish what type of a fish we need you know who's nibbling that who loves the third pool who L the first pool as soon as they see a everybody's coming the room pack convention everybody okay everybody okay it's not nothing bad about he said pull it just what a little a little bit but not what too hard Which pull is that one second pull and then it shall pull away from the the little fish so all the preachers were catching only what because they were limited to which pool first second pool on the first pool of miracle and healing guess what all the fishes they pull it's only small fishes small fishes small fish but they cannot go down everybody okay brother Bram God tell him don't stop at the P pull it a little bit harder when you begin to pull a little bit harder the word is coming the discernment is coming and when he does what does it do are we okay have I lost you sir and brother Bram say he say pull it just a little bit not too hard he say and then he shall pull it away from what the little fish and when they do what scatter they shall attract the attention of what the big fish so all this time the big fish is just sitting when he look he say we already seen this all the time can I continue can I continue but when the second pool come the second pool separated the people hallelujah everybody okay the second pool is the pool that separate the small fishes and exposes the big one everybody okay that's why the second pool was given to Sarah in Genesis 18 as the Messi son because when he does one will say be and another one will say where the this man never knew me how is it that he knows my life like this everybody okay it begin to separate the two together at the beginning we can play games but on the second pool go get your husband I don't have one you have five of them the one you living with it is not even yours the preparation come up I see that you are a prophet and not the Messiah when he will come he prepare you to the temp but it's not than the big fish wake up and say wait a minute wait a minute he was not at home with me how is he saying this from the pulit where did he know this me and my wife argue in the morning and now he begin to preach about argument it is the word discerning because as soon as that is right the next message you're going to receive it if your heart confirmed that what he saying is right the next one I am he the woman never doubted because the first because the second pool prepare her already to receive it Lord help me brother Bram say this he say and then I pull it away from the little fish and when they C they attract what the attention of the attention of the big fish and they what they'll grab it and that is the way you do what you'll catch it then when they bite on what third time you set the hook for what the catch I say what I understand but keep it still and do what don't tell nobody amen amen amen so this message need to be preach a certain way amen amen if not we don't know what we doing amen amen we are here for the elect sake amen and the elect are attracted by the third pool amen amen we love Miracle but Pentecostal matches us we love healing pente will match you but when you get to the last pool that is where the rainbow thrat goes there [Applause] am preacher launch into the deep Pastor lunch into the deep and you going to find the very big Good crap Bram never understood that his fishing the love that he have for his fishing God Was preparing him to use that for his ministry look at Elish the Bible says in First Kings chapter 19 verse uh 16 I'm going to stop soon we got to finish it another day amen he said and jiu the son of Nima shall thou anoint to be king of who Israel and Elisha the son of shaat of Abel mea shall thou anoint to be what prophet in thy room so according to the prophecy of God the repacement of Elijah was already known before the foundation of the world the one who should replace Elijah was Elisha the prophet and his prophecy came that hey you going to be the one replacing Elijah yes no problem but where is Elijah all this time amen Elisha and Elijah never met God is telling Elijah I'm going to pick you up from the Earth but I need to replace you yes God say you know what what I got your replacement there is a boy down there maybe when you pass you see the house over there you see that boy that always uh in the backyard there you hear him uh on the grass machine he say that's the boy Elijah say that boy over there yes God say his name is Elijah Elisha he will be taking your place the place of a big major prophet Jesus Elijah the prophet amen that's speak and then he rain fire I shall send you Elijah the prophet and you going to take the position the place of Elijah the prophet what qualification do you have who are you who train you what kind of training did you get because we never seen you following Elijah how can you take his place where is that boy he is with his father did he ever see a vision no so how is he going to come and replace a major prophet amen so let's turn our camera and follow Elijah where he is and find out where is Elisha when we turn our camera we found the home of Elisha H he live in North Carolina Hallelujah ah he's in oh he's in South Carolina and he's somewhere there if you go to the street there you see Elijah okay let's Zoom our camera let's see what is elishah doing this great man that God say will replace Elijah the prophet what is he doing is he eating ice cream sir on is he on a roller coaster car WI have I said something oh no he's sitting on downtown Charlotte and he's drinking some coffee oh some tea and posting online to show his good life where is Elijah the prophet I'm going to I'm going to stop here I can't go go into the deep where is Elijah the prophet first king Chapter 19 Verse uh 19 so they departed so he departed this and found who Elijah the son of who sh who was doing what plowing with 12 yolk of ox one man with 12 yolks of men so when they found the boy they didn't find him playing basket ball on the neighborhood they found the boy working sweating 12 y off an ox 24 oxen he's responsible managing 24 oxen two two two two two two one boy he's there amen he doesn't have a WhatsApp he doesn't have a Facebook he's not posting online all the time he's not there putting or playing with the Xbox are we together what is this boy he's sweating with 12 yolks and why do you take a boy such as this one Hallelujah they House of py the Bible says and he passed and and who was plowing with the 12 what yoke of oxen before him and he with the what he was with number 12 and number 12 is the number of worship so we found the boy with work can worship together there he is are we together he love to go to work he love to cut the grass at home and he's also worshiping when he's cutting the grass in other word when we find Elijah Elijah home he's like this is the day this is the day that the Lord has me I will be glad I will be glad they say huh this one can I continue he said and he left and and he and he with the 12 and elishah pass by him and he did what cast his mantle upon him the prophet just went took his jacket everybody okay everybody good and he left the oxen and run after Elijah who taught him who taught him to run after Elisha what was in the jacket that when he touches him the jacket told him move on you don't know what you carrying but God is preparing you for something and when the time come he Crank that engine you going to fall Su and you have to follow your path everybody okay he said the the Bible say he left the auction and run after Elijah and said let me iay thee kiss my father and my mother you you you just C something right and so you deal with it yourself he have to go back to Mommy and Daddy and before he goes out he need to go to Daddy and Mom he need to follow the order the order of the home let me talk to my mother talk to my father and then I will do what follow who Tau him to follow Elijah who preached to him they just took the mentor and throw it and when the mentor hit him the mentor told him let's move on Amen and then he said unto him go back again what have I done to thee in other way why are you following me did I tell you something amen watch what the mentor does and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and Bo their flesh with the instrument of The Oxen the end of the career and gave unto the people and they did it then he arose and went after who Elijah and he ministered whatto him who preached to him who taught him that what is in this message that we can draw before you close brother Steven brother Bram say this he said what Elijah the one was flowing knowing how to appreciate a straight throw so when he was playing I mean working with the oxen God was using that faculty for the task that he has to do amen just as he used the fishing for Peter James and John amen oh God he said and he know he turned and he know if he turned to look look back he would do what wiggle off the road so Elisha when he was working maybe at the beginning he will hold the Yol then his friend say hello Elisha then when he turn around don't talk to me when I'm working okay I'm going to I'm going to Lear the Sheep let me help you up a little bit let me help let me put it home okay okay here is Elisha working plowing and [Music] [Applause] suddenly this cell phone here now I got to start over again he learned that being under destruction that's it was always taking you off the path in other word when you engage into something stay focused amen don't look to the right don't look to the left no matter what the young people are doing stay focused because if you follow P pressure you the one losing at the end of the day God was using that to train him amen Hallelujah he says and God know that a man that know how to plow a what straight F no had to put his hand on the water the plow and every turn to look back he never waited till he got his education amen wigger along the road he just killed the ox and did what made a sacrifice and took off with who Elijah as soon as that meant what went over him he was how ready and how willing God know he could make him able amen now God has got to give him some what training he had been training how to keep his eyes on the what Pharaoh with what 12 Yol of ox and one man plowing with them he taught him somewh patience amen and had to be what patient and train those o to walk straight what in the line in other way they were training a pastor amen using Ox using animals when they messed up he goes about say let's go back again let's start this way this way this way because you're going to have some stubborn in the church I won't listen uhh you got to go patient with them you can't kick them out of the church you got to go slowly okay love them love them again go back again let's go everybody say something huh even if you give them a scripture you give them a code they go back again and do the same thing again amen if you whoop them you're going to kill them they don't mean any bad any bad thing they just knew you need to know how to stay and on the same time it's 12 of them going you look at this one you go this way you look at this one you look at this one you check this message you check this one you check this one Elisha I'm training you are we together are we together are we together and he says to keep the straight line he had to train some men afterward keep them where on the Bible on the what the word line up with what God to stay what straight in the line so whatever was happening in the Natural Life of Elisha Was preparing him for the gospel [Applause] amen Elisha thought Daddy was making me work too much he didn't know God has to put that character in him because when they give him the word he cannot de deviate he have to stay straight to the word and brother
