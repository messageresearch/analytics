[0:00] back around and made an alliance with
[0:02] that country
[0:03] now we are today and trying to compete
[0:06] with those big denominational churches
[0:09] building bigger schools
[0:12] but we don't need big schools
[0:17] whatever time that you take a Founder a
[0:21] leader that goes forth and his day well
[0:25] he'll do good in his day but as soon as
[0:27] he's gone then they'll build an
[0:28] organization over the top of his word
[0:31] then you'll get a bunch of little
[0:32] rickies in there Elvis's and the first
[0:35] thing you know they twist the thing to
[0:36] make it suit themselves and then this
[0:38] other comes up he injects something else
[0:40] because he's a great intellectual
[0:41] student not a hybrid somewhere or
[0:43] something and the first thing to begin
[0:45] to eject is to take this out and say
[0:47] this didn't mean that that you're right
[0:49] back in the same old run again yes if
[0:52] Amos is your hit blasts the thing right
[0:54] straight to the ground
[0:57] never built his campaign upon how many
[1:00] churches he could get to cooperate with
[1:02] him he never really shuts up on some
[1:05] certain organization or some sectarian
[1:07] parts of the church the thing you do to
[1:10] build his campaign upon the saith the
[1:13] Lord
[1:15] God would back him up as he always did
[1:18] through that is right
[1:19] he said there's trouble as turtles in
[1:23] your church what would he say today what
[1:26] would he say with that word of God
[1:27] hanging out here before us
[1:29] second Timothy 3 words said they'd be
[1:32] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:35] more than lovers of God truce Breakers
[1:38] false accusers incontinent and despisers
[1:41] of those that aren't trying to live
[1:42] right
[1:43] having a farm of godliness but would
[1:46] deny the power thereof you think a
[1:48] prophet could rise on the scene and
[1:50] bypass that prophecy
[1:52] is this full film in your eyes this day
[1:56] how did the church will get Farm on it
[2:00] how the things they would do it he'd
[2:02] bring to your memory those words of God
[2:04] you bring to your memory what God said
[2:07] he'd do in this day
[2:09] an Amos rose on the sea not only that
[2:12] but God would prove by Amos
[2:14] [Music]
[2:17] mistake certainly he would he did it in
[2:20] that day he's always done it
[2:22] certainly we will not receive Amos if he
[2:25] rose on the scene
[2:27] now now that form of Collins
[2:30] stand up there and in the choirs and
[2:34] around all the great long robed choirs
[2:37] and and sang like angels and dates the
[2:40] next night like Devils that's right
[2:44] it's exactly the truth
[2:48] some come out with great long roads on
[2:52] firely looking like that and looked like
[2:54] some kind of an Angelic being and
[2:58] stand up there and deny the word like
[3:00] any evil spirit would
[3:03] have an a form of God that is what would
[3:05] deny the power of
[3:07] [Music]
[3:08] don't talk about the about the baptism
[3:10] the Holy Ghost said why running out of
[3:12] church
[3:14] why he has to but they'll stand in these
[3:18] churches and let their members in the
[3:21] basement do the twists rock and roll
[3:23] [Music]
[3:25] our so-called YMCA I wonder what that C
[3:29] stands for walk into if you can't even
[3:32] hardly hear nothing but the lord's name
[3:34] you is that the young man's curse of
[3:36] society
[3:38] [Music]
[3:41] the YWCA and it was a disgrace to see
[3:45] them little girls out there on the floor
[3:46] until about nine o'clock trying to break
[3:48] their legs and doing the twist
[3:53] right
[3:55] all of the members of the church sang in
[3:58] choirs and taught Sunday school
[4:00] nothing but the devil tasting them
[4:03] little children out there on the floor a
[4:05] system that's been made up called
[4:07] religion
[4:08] certainly a true Prophet replaced that
[4:11] thing right back into the smoke of hell
[4:13] what originated at
[4:16] certain is true
[4:20] you think Amos could stand on the
[4:22] platform and preach the gospel and look
[4:24] out over a bunch of bobbed-haired women
[4:26] and not condemning

[26:56] everybody happy I know it's Wednesday I
[27:00] keep saying good morning to people when
[27:02] they come through the door because I'm
[27:03] not used to Leading on Sunday night or
[27:05] Wednesday night so
[27:08] wow
[27:12] God bless your sins I had a small
[27:16] testimony before I sing
[27:18] on sister Rebecca's wedding I think a
[27:22] week prior
[27:23] I was getting all the ideas of what I
[27:26] wanted to shoot during the wedding
[27:27] written down and I got called to one of
[27:30] our community parties in South Carolina
[27:32] and when we headed on there around five
[27:37] in the morning we spent an entire day
[27:39] shooting and around 5 p.m when we closed
[27:42] out and we wanted to grab a bike
[27:44] uh in the neighborhood that we were
[27:46] there was a series of rubbing and they
[27:50] broke into one of the cars that we had
[27:52] and they stole some of our equipment
[27:55] one of my friends was lucky they didn't
[27:58] steal anything from him because it was
[27:59] in the truck but mine and another
[28:01] friends was in the back seat that took
[28:03] everything so that was a week before the
[28:06] wedding and I panicked because the
[28:08] wedding is coming up I got everything I
[28:10] don't have the money to buy all these
[28:12] new equipment and
[28:14] I really was really frustrated and I
[28:17] didn't know what to do so throughout the
[28:19] week I tried to reach out to whoever I
[28:21] worked with before
[28:22] I tried to rent equipment but the price
[28:26] was really hop up than what I could
[28:28] afford and I think about when I came to
[28:31] church Wednesday and
[28:34] the pastor mentioned something that he
[28:36] always says put your car in neutral and
[28:38] let God handle everything
[28:40] and when I walked in the door I was I
[28:43] was still thinking about who I can call
[28:45] after church who I can reach out to but
[28:48] when I left I was like it's in God's
[28:50] hands uh so Thursday I went to South
[28:54] Carolina for another shoot with the
[28:57] friend that we was with that had his
[28:59] equipment saved he didn't get it he's
[29:02] stolen and we met up with one of the
[29:04] clients and after filming the entire day
[29:07] my friends that were with me my
[29:09] colleague that were with me talked to
[29:10] him about what happened and
[29:13] I was on the phone you know trying to
[29:15] reach other people you pulled me aside
[29:17] outside of the set and he asked me if
[29:19] the story was true and I told him yes I
[29:21] got a wedding coming up Saturday and I
[29:23] don't have anything
[29:25] and he offered to give me everything
[29:27] that I needed for that event
[29:30] and I told him okay I don't have enough
[29:32] money but this is what our guys about
[29:34] 500.
[29:35] I can pay you in advance and whenever I
[29:38] get some more money I can it's like
[29:39] everything is free
[29:41] so during the party everything that I
[29:44] needed he'd give it to me free and I
[29:46] want something to go for that

[29:53] all the time

[45:55] word because through this distraction
[45:57] God is moving slowly and he's working
[46:01] with his broad strengthening his blood
[46:03] you didn't start this thing it is not
[46:07] your responsibility to finish it he's
[46:10] the author and the finisher of water
[46:15] so your faith didn't start by you
[46:18] and you're not going to finish your
[46:20] faith
[46:21] so somebody started your faith and
[46:23] somebody's gonna finish your faith so
[46:26] what do you have to do there
[46:30] you see what I'm saying this Christian
[46:32] work is so good

[46:37] at the feet of Boaz

[46:42] everybody okay you didn't start it don't
[46:44] worry about it whatever is in the middle
[46:46] as long as you know who started
[46:50] did God tell Joshua that one day you're
[46:52] going to stop the Sun
[46:54] [Music]
[46:56] did he tell him that but he was in the
[46:58] package Joshua didn't know that he was
[47:01] in the package until something happened
[47:04] amen then he found out there is an
[47:07] option he never
[47:09] investigate before
[47:12] amen
[47:13] [Laughter]
[47:16] you don't know what God did in you
[47:20] until you see God coming out of you
[47:25] you still have not you still have not
[47:29] understand what God have done to you
[47:35] I was telling my wife coming on the road
[47:37] and say
[47:38] they killed three people
[47:41] they killed Jesus
[47:43] he killed the two Thief
[47:46] amen and they put him down
[47:49] and the soldier took the hammer
[47:52] okay come to the first one and break the
[47:55] leg
[47:57] they went to the second one and break
[47:59] the leg
[48:00] when they reached Jesus Christ
[48:04] for some reason one of the soldiers said
[48:08] he's dead just leave him alone
[48:11] everybody okay for some reason that's
[48:14] the way you want to you want you want to
[48:17] get stuff for some reason
[48:19] amen that Millet that Soldier can go
[48:23] home and say you know what we break two
[48:25] legs honey but uh when I look at that
[48:28] man called Jesus I just feel so pity for
[48:30] him
[48:31] until I look he was murdered he didn't
[48:33] do anything I just felt like I just
[48:35] leave him alone that's what the soldier
[48:37] taught
[48:41] the soldier thought that it was him
[48:44] purposely that choose not to break the
[48:47] the bones of Jesus Christ he didn't know
[48:51] there was a scripture
[48:56] do you understand what I'm saying
[48:58] if a scripture
[49:01] can be fulfilled in on a military man
[49:04] that doesn't like Jesus
[49:09] [Music]
[49:11] is it okay is it okay this man was not a
[49:15] Christian
[49:16] amen he had the right to break the bond
[49:19] of Jesus Christ but the scripture that
[49:21] was spoken have power over the enemy of
[49:25] Jesus Christ

[50:20] more than that more than a match for the
[50:23] devil

[50:28] God will bring you to that realization
[50:30] until you will understand who you are
[50:33] and you will turn around and say how was
[50:36] the devil really playing with me

[1:02:29] actually wrapped around atmosphere you
[1:02:32] may you may know this but we are
[1:02:33] actually living within the atmosphere of
[1:02:35] the Earth
[1:02:36] they're everywhere that we go there is
[1:02:39] an atmosphere in it and I was in church
[1:02:41] probably two and a half three weeks ago
[1:02:43] now and I was sitting there and
[1:02:44] something began to speak to me and said
[1:02:46] an atmosphere for The King and I began
[1:02:49] to think of that oh how powerful that is
[1:02:51] an atmosphere for the king and as I said
[1:02:54] I thought about that and it began to
[1:02:55] blow my mind because I began to think of
[1:02:57] that everything is wrapped around
[1:02:58] atmosphere from the moment that you wake
[1:03:01] up from the moment that you go to bed
[1:03:03] you are constantly going in and out of
[1:03:06] atmospheres
[1:03:08] and I heard this story on the radio
[1:03:10] about a man in a boxcar and and it
[1:03:13] struck me I know it was just the grace
[1:03:15] of God you know how God would do things
[1:03:16] for your brother Stephen and I just
[1:03:18] happened to turn on the radio or
[1:03:19] whatever it was and and I was listening
[1:03:21] the man began to tell a story about how
[1:03:24] there was a man and I didn't catch the
[1:03:25] whole story I caught the the later half
[1:03:27] of it from either he was working on the
[1:03:29] box cars or he was messing around the
[1:03:31] box cars and and anyways when he was
[1:03:33] around that boxcar he accidentally
[1:03:36] locked himself into that boxcar and when
[1:03:39] he locked himself into that boxcar he
[1:03:41] began to realize I can't get out of here
[1:03:44] unless someone helps me I cannot get out
[1:03:46] of here and he began to have all these
[1:03:49] negative thoughts he began to think man
[1:03:51] there's no way that I'm going to make
[1:03:52] this I I just don't know if I can make
[1:03:54] it I'm not sure and then that turned
[1:03:56] into there's definitely no way I can
[1:03:58] make it so I believe he took a penny out
[1:04:00] of his pocket and he began to ride on
[1:04:02] the wall and he began to tell all of his
[1:04:04] thoughts and everything that he was
[1:04:05] thinking because he really believed that
[1:04:07] he wasn't going to be take it brother
[1:04:09] Stephen he really believed that he was
[1:04:10] going to die and about that time the
[1:04:12] train began to take off and he began to
[1:04:14] say in his own mind he began to speak
[1:04:16] out and say it's getting colder in here
[1:04:18] I'm getting colder and he began to ride
[1:04:20] on that wall I'm getting colder and he
[1:04:22] began to write all of his life thoughts
[1:04:24] and he began to say it's getting colder
[1:04:26] and colder and colder and colder in here
[1:04:29] and to the point you could see where
[1:04:30] he's coming down to his final words and
[1:04:32] he begins to say I just can't take it
[1:04:34] any longer
[1:04:36] he began to say my body is beginning to
[1:04:39] freeze to death these are going to be my
[1:04:42] last words
[1:04:44] well you know that was his last words
[1:04:46] they the The Boxcar stopped and they
[1:04:48] opened the boxcar and they found the man
[1:04:50] dead in there the thing was the engineer
[1:04:54] came and he said the thing about it is
[1:04:56] that is a climate controlled boxcar so
[1:05:00] they began to say the temperature the
[1:05:02] whole time that he was in there brother
[1:05:03] Stephen would have been around 60
[1:05:05] degrees
[1:05:07] but the Man created such a Negative
[1:05:09] atmosphere he created such a bad
[1:05:13] atmosphere inside of that boxcar that he
[1:05:16] began to tell itself I'm a failure I'm
[1:05:20] not gonna make it I can't make it and
[1:05:24] through that atmosphere he actually
[1:05:26] talked himself into his own death
[1:05:30] begin to think oh my
[1:05:33] if a negative atmosphere could do that
[1:05:37] what could a positive atmosphere do
[1:05:40] I begin to think about that and you know
[1:05:42] me and my wife we we took we had a uh we
[1:05:46] have a we have a little cat and and I
[1:05:48] brought it home unexpectedly one time
[1:05:50] and my wife wasn't too happy about it it
[1:05:52] was for my daughter
[1:05:53] and I had that little cat and she said
[1:05:55] well if you want that cat you're gonna
[1:05:57] have to get it fixed and everything else
[1:05:58] and I say okay so I put it off forever
[1:06:00] and finally she said the Humane Society
[1:06:02] is doing it for twenty dollars and that
[1:06:04] sounded good to me so I ran down there
[1:06:06] to get it done and and when I got there
[1:06:08] everybody was happy at first because
[1:06:10] everybody was getting a good deal
[1:06:12] everyone was going to get a good deal on
[1:06:14] this but you know people begin to block
[1:06:16] one another in with their cars because
[1:06:18] there was a small area of parking and
[1:06:21] when they came in even though everybody
[1:06:22] was happy at first people began to
[1:06:24] realize I'm getting blocked in here
[1:06:27] I'm going to have to stay longer than I
[1:06:30] want to stay here
[1:06:32] and next thing you know this person gets
[1:06:34] mad and begins to begins to put a
[1:06:36] negative atmosphere off and it goes on
[1:06:37] to the next one and that one begins to
[1:06:39] have a negative atmosphere and say well
[1:06:41] I'm blocked in here too and the one in
[1:06:43] front of me got that negative atmosphere
[1:06:45] and said what are we going to do and I
[1:06:46] spoke up and I said I'll tell you what
[1:06:48] I'm just thankful that I'm not in
[1:06:50] Florida right now and there ain't no
[1:06:51] hurricane hitting my house and next
[1:06:53] thing you know the next person begin to
[1:06:55] say you know I'm thankful for that too
[1:06:56] because I I could be there right there
[1:06:58] and one person began to say you know I
[1:07:00] used to be there and I know what those
[1:07:02] hurricanes are liking it you see how the
[1:07:04] atmosphere begin to change
[1:07:07] I don't know I don't want to get ahead
[1:07:09] of myself but you have the right to
[1:07:11] change the atmosphere
[1:07:14] and we can look at the one that always
[1:07:16] had the most excellent atmosphere with
[1:07:18] them I began to think of Jesus and it
[1:07:20] says there arose a great storm of wind
[1:07:22] and the waves beat into this ship so
[1:07:24] that it was now full and he was in the
[1:07:26] hinder part of the ship asleep
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:30] he was asleep on a pillow what was he
[1:07:32] doing even though everyone around him
[1:07:34] was panicking Jesus was dwelling in his
[1:07:36] own atmosphere he didn't care what was
[1:07:38] going on around him I want you to know
[1:07:40] what it was about Jesus Jesus knew the
[1:07:42] purpose of his life
[1:07:44] Jesus knew where he was going Jesus knew
[1:07:47] where he had to be Jesus knew he had a
[1:07:50] calling Jesus knew there was going to be
[1:07:51] a cross and there couldn't be an ocean
[1:07:53] that could stop him
[1:07:55] he was dwelling in his atmosphere
[1:08:01] and they awake him and said unto him
[1:08:05] Master cares not that we perish
[1:08:08] they had a pretty bad atmosphere going
[1:08:10] on and even the atmosphere around them
[1:08:13] wasn't so great either
[1:08:15] Carousel not that we perish and he arose
[1:08:17] and rebuke the wind and he said unto the
[1:08:19] sea peace be still and the wind cease
[1:08:23] and there was a great calm and he said
[1:08:25] unto them why are ye so fearful can I
[1:08:28] say that unto the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:30] tonight
[1:08:31] why are ye so fearful
[1:08:35] how is it that you have no faith and
[1:08:37] they have and they feared exceedingly
[1:08:39] saying one to another what manner of man
[1:08:41] is this that even the wind and the Sea
[1:08:44] obey him because I want you to know
[1:08:46] wherever Jesus is Jesus will change the
[1:08:49] atmosphere I don't know how you came
[1:08:52] here tonight I don't know how you were
[1:08:53] feeling but when you come into the
[1:08:54] presence of Jesus Jesus will always
[1:08:57] change your atmosphere
[1:09:01] look in the scriptures that everywhere
[1:09:03] Jesus went Jesus changed the atmosphere
[1:09:07] I want to say that again everywhere
[1:09:09] Jesus went he changed the atmosphere I
[1:09:13] began to think of that and now you know
[1:09:15] I begin to think man how amazing is our
[1:09:17] God that everywhere he went he changed
[1:09:20] the atmosphere you know I began to think
[1:09:22] of gerias and and now his daughter was
[1:09:25] dead and and he said Lord just come pray
[1:09:27] for my daughter and then when they got
[1:09:29] there
[1:09:30] I love how everyone would say she's dead
[1:09:35] the doctor said she's dead
[1:09:38] the neighbor said she's dead
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:42] nature said she's dead
[1:09:45] but Jesus in the atmosphere that he
[1:09:48] brought
[1:09:49] he would walk into that situation and he
[1:09:53] would begin to say oh she's just
[1:09:54] sleeping
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:02] hey hey don't worry your ass man don't
[1:10:04] worry
[1:10:05] she's just sleeping
[1:10:07] and they laughed him to scorn but Jesus
[1:10:11] didn't like that atmosphere so it said
[1:10:14] when Jesus had put it all out
[1:10:18] if you want to learn something from
[1:10:20] Jesus here's a good time to do it when
[1:10:22] negativity comes around
[1:10:25] put it all out
[1:10:28] ain't got no room I ain't got no time I
[1:10:30] ain't got time for that
[1:10:33] some of us didn't even say devil you
[1:10:36] need to put him in his place like he's a
[1:10:38] little child when you're busy and say I
[1:10:40] don't have time for that go settle down
[1:10:46] and when he was coming he said to them
[1:10:48] why I'm making this a door and wheat the
[1:10:50] damsel is not dead
[1:10:52] but sleepeth and they laughed him to
[1:10:54] scorn but when he had put them all out
[1:10:56] he taketh the father and mother of the
[1:10:58] damsel and then that were with him and
[1:11:00] entered where the damsel was lying and
[1:11:02] he took the damsel by the hand and he
[1:11:04] sent her there said unto her talith Kumi
[1:11:06] which is being interpreted damsel I say
[1:11:09] unto thee Jesus is changing the
[1:11:12] atmosphere
[1:11:14] that's what's going on Jesus is changing
[1:11:16] the atmosphere he says Denzel I say
[1:11:19] that's what I say unto thee arise
[1:11:23] and straightway the damsel arose and
[1:11:28] walked for she was the age of 12 years
[1:11:30] old and they were astonished with a
[1:11:33] great astonishment
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:37] kind of kind of sounds like I'm on the
[1:11:39] boat what manner of man is this
[1:11:42] what manner of man is this that even the
[1:11:45] wind and the Seas obey him I love how
[1:11:48] wherever Jesus went he wasn't worried
[1:11:51] about the atmosphere he changed the
[1:11:53] atmosphere
[1:11:55] thank you
[1:11:55] well what is bro you know it was the
[1:11:57] same thing it was the same thing with
[1:12:00] Legion one day
[1:12:02] I love that because there was a bunch of
[1:12:04] men that would try to bind Legion there
[1:12:07] was a bunch of different men that would
[1:12:09] try to say let's try this to bind him
[1:12:11] and let's try that to bind him and they
[1:12:12] would have all their own ideas and and
[1:12:14] they would begin to try to bind them
[1:12:16] with chains and and he would just break
[1:12:18] them free it kind of reminds me of these
[1:12:20] denominational programs and different
[1:12:22] things trying to train people into
[1:12:24] something and train someone out of
[1:12:25] something if it ain't for the power of
[1:12:27] God you ain't going to be free
[1:12:30] but Jesus had such an atmosphere about
[1:12:33] him that when he stepped off of that
[1:12:35] boat
[1:12:36] and he stepped onto that Shore
[1:12:40] the Devils came running to Jesus
[1:12:45] can you imagine
[1:12:48] Legion in that cave
[1:12:51] and then when Jesus stepped on the shore
[1:12:54] those Legion of devils began to say the
[1:12:58] atmosphere has changed
[1:13:02] back in that cave they begin to say
[1:13:06] a legion of devils begin to talk to one
[1:13:09] another and they begin to say do you
[1:13:11] feel that
[1:13:12] do you feel that
[1:13:18] you know what PTSD is
[1:13:21] can you imagine when they said
[1:13:23] that's Michael
[1:13:26] that was the one
[1:13:28] that was in heaven
[1:13:30] and when Lucifer tried to gather us all
[1:13:33] together
[1:13:34] we thought we were going to overthrow
[1:13:36] him
[1:13:37] he kicked us out
[1:13:39] the atmosphere began it was a familiar
[1:13:42] atmosphere
[1:13:43] it was a familiar atmosphere that they
[1:13:46] walked in
[1:13:48] Hallelujah
[1:13:50] it was such a familiar atmosphere they
[1:13:53] began to tremble
[1:13:55] and begin to go that's Michael
[1:13:57] that's gotta be Michael
[1:14:01] what can we do
[1:14:03] Hallelujah I don't know I know we can't
[1:14:05] outrun him
[1:14:07] I know we can't hide from that
[1:14:09] discernment I I know we can't do that
[1:14:13] and Buddy
[1:14:15] those demons atmosphere begin to change
[1:14:20] I'm feeling good tonight
[1:14:22] they begin to say
[1:14:24] only thing I can do oh I think I know we
[1:14:27] can do let's go beg for mercy
[1:14:32] and they run to Jesus and in the
[1:14:35] atmosphere that Jesus is making
[1:14:38] they don't say put up your best fight
[1:14:41] Jesus show me what you got but they come
[1:14:44] and say oh thou Son of God please don't
[1:14:47] torment us before our time not one devil
[1:14:51] a legion of devils
[1:14:54] came before one almighty God
[1:14:57] there was such an atmosphere they said
[1:15:00] just don't torment us before our time
[1:15:03] and as Jesus
[1:15:06] as Jesus cast them out of Heaven he cast
[1:15:10] them out of legion
[1:15:12] and sent them right into the swine
[1:15:16] Jesus didn't have an all-night prayer
[1:15:17] Maiden he made such an atmosphere about
[1:15:20] him he just said go
[1:15:24] I don't know if you know who you're
[1:15:26] serving tonight
[1:15:28] but let's listen to what brother Brandon
[1:15:29] says he says
[1:15:31] you create
[1:15:34] not just Jesus but you create a creation
[1:15:38] around you
[1:15:40] come on now
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:43] you create a creation around you you've
[1:15:45] seen people you couldn't stand to be
[1:15:47] around
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] we're nice people they create within
[1:15:51] themselves
[1:15:54] love to be with because they create that
[1:15:57] atmosphere around them he said that's
[1:15:59] your spirit your soul you can't hide it
[1:16:02] you can't make believe it
[1:16:04] now I said this last time I preached
[1:16:06] this but you know uh
[1:16:08] any of y'all know big eagle Richie
[1:16:10] Douglas
[1:16:11] man what a good atmosphere that brother
[1:16:13] has
[1:16:15] I'm gonna tell you what uh okay I I I'm
[1:16:18] gonna have to take my halo off here for
[1:16:19] a minute if that's all right but but you
[1:16:22] know me and my wife we have those two
[1:16:24] little children and it's everything that
[1:16:26] we can do we want to make it to church
[1:16:27] on time
[1:16:29] but we'll we'll get up the night before
[1:16:32] the wife has the clothes laid out and
[1:16:34] we're trying to get out the door and
[1:16:36] everything's going wrong we walk all the
[1:16:37] way the car forgets something come back
[1:16:39] in you know having to change the baby

[1:16:43] restroom any other time but on Sunday
[1:16:45] morning he does
[1:16:47] we're trying to get out the door and I
[1:16:50] don't have the best atmosphere about me
[1:16:53] and I'm just trying to get to church and
[1:16:55] and you know me and Selena we have a a
[1:17:02] passionate discussion
[1:17:06] and we're trying to make it to church

[1:17:12] talking about
[1:17:15] and and we're trying to get to church
[1:17:17] and I have already decided I'm in a bad
[1:17:20] mood
[1:17:22] I've already decided I'm just going here
[1:17:25] because it's my duty
[1:17:27] but I get in church
[1:17:29] and I sit down and I look across the
[1:17:32] church and brother Richie's going
[1:17:39] and next thing you know because of the
[1:17:42] atmosphere because as soon as he smiles
[1:17:45] at me I hear him I hear my voicemail
[1:17:49] Brady says brother Seth
[1:17:51] I just want you to know Jesus loves you
[1:17:55] and I do too
[1:17:58] because of the atmosphere that he
[1:18:01] creates around him
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:05] fear now I should have never been in
[1:18:07] that in the first place I'll admit that
[1:18:09] but I will say this we have the power
[1:18:13] to change the atmosphere around us
[1:18:16] sometimes we overthink it sometimes it
[1:18:19] would make it too complicated but all it
[1:18:21] takes is a smile
[1:18:23] and I love you and Jesus does too
[1:18:27] I love them see you create your own
[1:18:30] atmosphere around you you believe that
[1:18:33] you sure do many of you has read my book
[1:18:36] The Man sent from God remember the night
[1:18:38] the maniac ran to the platform to kill
[1:18:40] me air in Portland Oregon
[1:18:41] you read the story note about no doubt
[1:18:44] ma it's everywhere what happened well
[1:18:46] that poor fellow I didn't get angry with
[1:18:48] him
[1:18:53] I didn't get angry with him I loved him
[1:18:57] something happened
[1:18:59] I want you to know what the power of a
[1:19:02] true love God is love
[1:19:06] he said I loved him he run out there
[1:19:09] 250 60 pounds great big pretty near six
[1:19:13] foot and a half said I'll break every
[1:19:16] bone in your body he's coming with an
[1:19:19] atmosphere
[1:19:20] he could do it but I didn't hate him
[1:19:23] I loved him I felt sorry for him he was
[1:19:28] bound I didn't have to scream I said
[1:19:30] Satan come out of the man
[1:19:34] he fell on the floor that was it that
[1:19:38] was all
[1:19:39] now
[1:19:41] there's another quote now let me tell
[1:19:43] you something each man that's born again
[1:19:45] with the spirit of God in him is a
[1:19:49] miniature creator
[1:19:51] now that might shake you a little bit
[1:19:53] but that's the truth we're in the image
[1:19:56] of God God is a Creator that's the
[1:19:58] reason you can believe that God could
[1:20:00] heal a person because God is in you
[1:20:06] and God made this world he just spoke it
[1:20:09] and his words become material the very
[1:20:13] ground that you're setting on is the
[1:20:15] word of God made manifest
[1:20:17] if he didn't where did he get it see he
[1:20:21] just spoke it and turned it into
[1:20:22] existence he believed it in his own word
[1:20:25] and if a man is born of the spirit of
[1:20:27] God
[1:20:29] he's an offspring of God
[1:20:32] if a man is Born Into the spirit of God
[1:20:36] he's an offspring of God
[1:20:39] I'm gonna make this as simple as I know
[1:20:41] how to say it
[1:20:43] when you have a man and a woman that
[1:20:45] come together by a marriage and they're
[1:20:46] both very athletic people very fast
[1:20:49] people athletic all around you know what
[1:20:51] that baby's going to be athletic
[1:20:54] it's in its genes it can't help but be
[1:20:56] what it is I'm gonna tell you what I was
[1:20:58] at the barber
[1:21:00] Tuesday and the man I went to get a
[1:21:02] haircut but I looked in the mirror and
[1:21:03] the man was cutting my dad's hair
[1:21:05] because I was looking at my father in
[1:21:08] the mirror
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] I might have not have liked it but I
[1:21:11] couldn't change it
[1:21:13] it was I am who I am and I cannot help
[1:21:17] but be Mark coffey's son because that
[1:21:19] that's just what I am
[1:21:22] I do stuff like my father
[1:21:24] I say stuff like my father
[1:21:28] he didn't have to train me to do it it
[1:21:30] just comes out of me
[1:21:32] he's an offspring of God and that's the
[1:21:35] part that God is in him he believes
[1:21:39] every word that God says will
[1:21:41] materialize
[1:21:43] D and so that makes him a part of God
[1:21:45] the holy spirit
[1:21:47] in the man
[1:21:50] makes him a part of God
[1:21:54] what I'm trying to tell you at the
[1:21:57] beginning of the story you could see
[1:22:00] Jesus
[1:22:01] on the stormy seas and he would rebuke
[1:22:05] the storm you you can see him with
[1:22:08] jarius's daughter and she will he would
[1:22:10] raise her from the dead
[1:22:13] if he's the hell what was his children
[1:22:15] do then
[1:22:17] they would do the same thing the spirit
[1:22:21] of almighty God that is in them
[1:22:24] you cannot help but be who you are
[1:22:31] we are made
[1:22:33] to change
[1:22:35] the atmosphere
[1:22:38] we are made
[1:22:41] if Jesus changed the atmosphere
[1:22:44] and we have the same
[1:22:47] Gene's word seed on the inside of us
[1:22:53] I'm going to say it you might not like
[1:22:55] it we ain't made to dwell in the devil's
[1:22:58] atmospheres
[1:23:00] but we have the power to create an
[1:23:04] atmosphere
[1:23:06] and walk into that atmosphere
[1:23:11] Abraham against hope
[1:23:13] believed in Hope brother Branham said he
[1:23:17] got stronger through his trials every
[1:23:19] time he went up to Sarah and he said
[1:23:22] Sarah is there any difference and she
[1:23:25] said no not yet Abraham he still created
[1:23:28] an atmosphere that said if it's not
[1:23:31] today it'll be tomorrow
[1:23:34] and if it's not tomorrow
[1:23:39] such an atmosphere that he got a visit
[1:23:42] from God himself
[1:23:44] thank you
[1:23:46] he created such an atmosphere
[1:23:50] that his old body began to change
[1:23:58] he created such an atmosphere
[1:24:02] that at a hundred years old and Sarah 75
[1:24:06] their bodies were so changed that a king
[1:24:11] would look at Grandma
[1:24:12] and see he would say she is fair to look
[1:24:15] upon
[1:24:16] because of the atmosphere
[1:24:19] that they created let me tell you
[1:24:22] something you're a Seed of Abraham
[1:24:26] Abraham's seed ain't no wimp seed it's a
[1:24:29] fake seed
[1:24:31] you are made to change the atmosphere
[1:24:35] you are made to overcome every gate of
[1:24:39] the enemy
[1:24:45] if you're in any kind of carpentry
[1:24:48] if you're any kind of carpenter or
[1:24:50] anything like that
[1:24:52] they will develop
[1:24:54] a drill
[1:24:56] to be able to drill a screw into a two
[1:24:59] by four
[1:25:00] a Sawzall cannot do that
[1:25:03] a skill saw cannot do that
[1:25:06] a handsaw cannot do that but the drill
[1:25:09] can
[1:25:11] because from the beginning
[1:25:13] an engineer
[1:25:16] designed that tool
[1:25:18] he designed it in such a way that it
[1:25:22] would have a purpose and it would
[1:25:25] fulfill that purpose
[1:25:30] when all of the elements came together
[1:25:32] and it was in the right atmosphere and
[1:25:36] you took that drill and the battery was
[1:25:38] fully charged brother sister it dwelled
[1:25:41] in the presence of that charger and
[1:25:43] began to draw its strength into that
[1:25:46] battery and before you know it it
[1:25:48] couldn't help but produce the power that
[1:25:52] was on the inside of it and when the
[1:25:55] mechanics and the Dynamics come together
[1:25:58] it'll produce the word of God every time
[1:26:04] you ever try to do the job with the
[1:26:06] wrong tool
[1:26:07] you'll be there for hours jumping around
[1:26:10] doing this that and the other but you
[1:26:12] grab what was made for the purpose you
[1:26:14] are trying to do and it cannot fail
[1:26:17] because it was made to do it
[1:26:21] and we are made to overcome
[1:26:24] we are in Satan's end to overcome
[1:26:29] foreign
[1:26:35] but we are not living in the atmosphere
[1:26:38] of Satan's Eden
[1:26:41] this is what we are coming to we are
[1:26:45] like Adam and God's Eden again and if
[1:26:50] Adam spoke the word
[1:26:52] in that atmosphere in the atmosphere of
[1:26:56] the Garden of Eden he could speak the
[1:26:59] word
[1:27:00] Hallelujah we are in Satan's Eden but we
[1:27:04] ain't in the atmosphere of Satan's Eden
[1:27:08] we are in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:27:11] Jesus
[1:27:15] but you got to be willing
[1:27:17] to change your atmosphere
[1:27:21] if you're dwelling somewhere you ain't
[1:27:23] supposed to be dwelling then change the
[1:27:26] atmosphere
[1:27:28] I think of the woman with the blood
[1:27:30] issues she began to see Jesus come by
[1:27:33] and she had all the other doctors say
[1:27:36] there's no hope you can't do it there's
[1:27:38] nothing we can do for you I made this
[1:27:41] statement maybe even she talked to Luke
[1:27:43] the apostle that was a physician
[1:27:46] and he says I've seen this before
[1:27:50] there's not a cure
[1:27:51] but as Jesus comes by she begins to
[1:27:55] build an atmosphere and even though all
[1:27:58] the drugs didn't work come on somebody
[1:28:00] even though all the drugs didn't work I
[1:28:04] was getting drunk on the new wine then
[1:28:06] he's the pain
[1:28:08] but there was something on the inside of
[1:28:11] her that began to make an atmosphere
[1:28:14] that said if I could just Touch the Hem
[1:28:17] of His Garment and know that I'll be
[1:28:19] made whole
[1:28:21] that sounds ridiculous to everyone
[1:28:23] around but in her atmosphere
[1:28:27] all things are possible to them that
[1:28:30] believe
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:33] she built can I say this
[1:28:37] have you ever been to a place
[1:28:39] where there was such a bad atmosphere
[1:28:43] that you knew you weren't supposed to be
[1:28:45] there before you spoke to anybody before
[1:28:48] you said a word you walked into
[1:28:50] something and you walked back out
[1:28:53] because you said that is not an
[1:28:55] atmosphere for a son or a daughter of
[1:28:58] God to be in
[1:29:00] you know she had to fight her way
[1:29:02] through the crowd but I kind of Wonder
[1:29:04] brother Stephen
[1:29:05] did she make
[1:29:07] such an atmosphere by her faith that
[1:29:11] when she was coming up behind people
[1:29:13] before they ever seen her or knew that
[1:29:16] she was there they began to feel
[1:29:19] uncomfortable standing in her way
[1:29:23] because she made such an atmosphere that
[1:29:27] devil it was like the Red Sea church
[1:29:28] there was such an atmosphere that she
[1:29:32] created saying if I can just Touch the
[1:29:35] Hem of His Garment she had a purpose and
[1:29:38] God had to fulfill that purpose I'm
[1:29:41] gonna tell you right now I believe that
[1:29:43] her atmosphere draw Jesus closer to her
[1:29:47] I love what Billy Graham said one time
[1:29:50] one guy said I Found Jesus he said I
[1:29:52] didn't know Jesus was lost
[1:29:55] Jesus ain't lost Jesus knew right where
[1:29:59] he was he knew right where that woman
[1:30:01] was and I believe you don't you don't
[1:30:04] have to believe this but I believe that
[1:30:06] she built such an atmosphere that he
[1:30:09] began to alter the course of Jesus
[1:30:12] closer and closer
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] do you not know that God inhabits the
[1:30:21] Praises of his people
[1:30:23] God loves to go where he's welcome
[1:30:27] so a deep call to the Deep begins to
[1:30:31] build an atmosphere
[1:30:34] and there's something
[1:30:37] that Jesus
[1:30:39] begins to
[1:30:42] drift over
[1:30:45] you know I've said it like this
[1:30:47] Jesus is supposed to walk this line but
[1:30:50] her faith begins to draw
[1:30:52] Jesus and as Jesus is walking by I want
[1:30:56] to tell it to you this way because Satan
[1:30:59] says you can never get help
[1:31:01] Satan says it'll never work but here's
[1:31:04] the thing in your mind it won't work but
[1:31:07] God doesn't do the math that we do
[1:31:11] we try to figure everything out
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:17] I can't figure out how God turned the
[1:31:20] water into wine
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:24] you think I can figure out how he raised
[1:31:26] Lazarus from the dead
[1:31:28] you tell me
[1:31:30] how that woman
[1:31:32] touched a man's clothes
[1:31:35] and next thing you know I believe it
[1:31:37] said she had the problem for 20 years
[1:31:40] gone
[1:31:43] because the atmosphere
[1:31:46] that she built you ain't got to worry
[1:31:49] I want to say it this way stop trying to
[1:31:51] figure out God
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:54] can we stop trying to figure out God and
[1:31:57] stop telling God how to run the program
[1:32:03] I'm a tattoo like this
[1:32:06] I've been under a lot of stress lately
[1:32:09] we'll be honest I'm an honest preacher
[1:32:12] I I I I ain't no Holier I ain't no
[1:32:15] holier than thou okay
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:18] I'm right there with you I'm fighting
[1:32:19] with a sword Hand in Hand by you you
[1:32:21] don't believe me I'll pull this one out
[1:32:23] in front of the pulpit
[1:32:27] I'm telling you
[1:32:28] yes Selena there really is a sword under
[1:32:30] the pulpit
[1:32:32] I'll tell you
[1:32:35] I was so stressed I'm trying to sell a
[1:32:38] house I'm trying to take over a new
[1:32:40] territory at work and work in the old
[1:32:42] territory at the same time double duty
[1:32:45] and then I have children that I'm trying
[1:32:46] to raise
[1:32:48] I'm doing all this at one time I'm
[1:32:50] trying to get the house ready I'm trying
[1:32:51] to do all this I don't know how it's
[1:32:52] going to add up
[1:32:54] how am I going to do this that and the
[1:32:56] other so I decide I'm going to get away
[1:32:59] and I go hunting
[1:33:00] and I sit in the woods and I'm out in
[1:33:02] the middle of the woods and I'm trying
[1:33:04] to be quiet and you know I'm kind of
[1:33:06] talking to God a little bit and I'm just
[1:33:07] I'm hoping a deer walks out or something
[1:33:09] you know and the next thing I know some
[1:33:12] neighbor decides to blast his music
[1:33:17] and I said I can't even get away right
[1:33:21] try to come out here try to find some
[1:33:24] peace
[1:33:25] and I'm sitting here going God how are
[1:33:27] you going to do this
[1:33:28] God how are you going to do that God
[1:33:30] this and that don't add up now I'm
[1:33:32] asking with a sincere heart don't think
[1:33:33] I'm just being a smart alec up there but
[1:33:36] I'm saying God I don't understand this
[1:33:37] God I don't know how this is going to
[1:33:39] happen this guy's blaring the music and
[1:33:40] I'm saying God I I I don't know what to
[1:33:43] do and then something says listen to the
[1:33:45] music
[1:33:46] and I'm like I don't want to listen to
[1:33:47] music I don't he just listen to the
[1:33:50] music
[1:33:52] and I began to listen
[1:33:54] and it was a song and it began to say
[1:33:56] how the love of God chases me down
[1:34:00] the never-ending overwhelming Reckless
[1:34:03] Love of God and I began to think
[1:34:10] if God loves me
[1:34:14] so much
[1:34:16] that I would be in the middle of the
[1:34:18] Woods
[1:34:19] and some guy walks on his back porch
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:24] I'm gonna turn on some music
[1:34:28] that man probably listened to country
[1:34:30] music every night of the week
[1:34:31] but for some reason that night
[1:34:34] he decides I'm going to turn on some
[1:34:37] Christian music
[1:34:39] and then he accidentally left his
[1:34:41] hearing aids in the house
[1:34:43] so he cranks that thing up where he can
[1:34:45] hear it and I'm out in the woods going I
[1:34:48] don't know what to do God I can't
[1:34:49] understand this and then while I'm in
[1:34:51] the middle of the woods God begins to
[1:34:54] change my atmosphere
[1:34:57] I began to realize
[1:35:00] if God loves me sis there ain't a
[1:35:04] problem big enough in the world
[1:35:08] we worry
[1:35:10] we fear we wonder why we stress over
[1:35:15] this we stress over that church if God
[1:35:18] loves you why does it matter
[1:35:23] all these things are going to fade away
[1:35:25] anyways
[1:35:28] but then maybe and then right after that
[1:35:30] song they switch over to a song that
[1:35:32] that charity girl girl sings I speak
[1:35:35] Jesus
[1:35:37] and I began to come home and I tell my
[1:35:40] wife I said I said I said I'll tell you
[1:35:42] what
[1:35:43] God loves me
[1:35:44] I know God loves me she says what do you
[1:35:48] mean I began to tell her I was in the
[1:35:49] woods and I was complaining to God
[1:35:54] y'all ain't never gonna have me back
[1:35:56] you're good I was complaining to God
[1:35:59] and he began to say Seth just be quiet
[1:36:03] stop trying to tell me how to run my
[1:36:06] program
[1:36:08] I love you son I've always took care of
[1:36:11] you
[1:36:12] and she said but there's one thing you
[1:36:14] didn't notice I said what's that she
[1:36:16] said you didn't realize that that song
[1:36:19] that they were singing was the same song
[1:36:22] that you put your boy to sleep to every
[1:36:24] night
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:27] further more than that she played that
[1:36:29] song or they played that song I speak
[1:36:31] Jesus that boy when he was born they
[1:36:34] said he didn't have Hearing in one ear
[1:36:36] they said he failed the hearing test but
[1:36:39] I took that song
[1:36:41] I speak Jesus Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:45] yesterday today and forever and I began
[1:36:49] to play that song in his ear they said
[1:36:52] we'll come back and do another test they
[1:36:54] came back in and did the test and they
[1:36:56] said he failed I said no he didn't
[1:36:58] my atmosphere had done changed brother
[1:37:00] Stephen I didn't care what that nurse
[1:37:02] said I didn't care what she had to say
[1:37:04] my son was gonna have perfect hearing
[1:37:08] so he done failed two tests but he had
[1:37:10] to come back two weeks later but I
[1:37:12] didn't think about it no more because my
[1:37:14] son was gonna have perfect hearing and
[1:37:18] that woman came back and she did the
[1:37:20] test and she said Selena coffee your son
[1:37:22] has perfect Hearing in both ears
[1:37:27] because in the atmosphere of the most
[1:37:31] high God
[1:37:32] all things are possible to them that
[1:37:35] believe when you believe you'll create
[1:37:39] an atmosphere like God Almighty in the
[1:37:43] heavens
[1:37:44] before there was a earth before there
[1:37:47] was a heaven he began to have a thought
[1:37:51] and he would believe his own thoughts
[1:37:54] and it would create such an atmosphere
[1:37:57] that when he would speak
[1:38:01] Here Comes the Sun here comes the Earth
[1:38:04] wow because it was an atmosphere of only
[1:38:08] believe
[1:38:09] he believed his own words and the
[1:38:13] almighty God dwells in you
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:19] why cry
[1:38:21] speak
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] you got a problem tonight
[1:38:26] let's change the atmosphere
[1:38:29] you got some in your life you don't like
[1:38:33] you got an addiction that's bothering
[1:38:35] you let's change the atmosphere
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:41] we are made
[1:38:45] we are Heavenly Creatures
[1:38:49] we are the genetics of the most high God
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:57] we'll get somewhere here in just in a
[1:38:59] minute
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:03] can I just preach on not worry about the
[1:39:06] time I'm sorry I just want to get this
[1:39:08] off my heart
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:11] I'll skip that part there
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:14] but I want you to know you might be
[1:39:16] going through a lot
[1:39:18] but there's a lot that can be changed in
[1:39:19] the right atmosphere
[1:39:22] you might be going through problems you
[1:39:24] might be going through situations but
[1:39:26] you change that atmosphere and see what
[1:39:27] happens
[1:39:30] I think of Paul and Silas
[1:39:33] changing the atmosphere
[1:39:37] Paul and Silas
[1:39:39] are commissioned
[1:39:41] by Jesus Christ
[1:39:43] to go and preach the gospel
[1:39:47] they go into a place and there's a
[1:39:49] fortune teller woman
[1:39:52] and they cast that evil spirit out of
[1:39:54] her
[1:39:55] and then they get in trouble for doing
[1:39:57] it after Jesus commissioned them to do
[1:40:00] it
[1:40:01] then they get thrown in trip because
[1:40:03] listen Paul would say when I would do
[1:40:05] good
[1:40:06] evil is present
[1:40:10] I know you're just trying to do good in
[1:40:12] this life the evil is going to be
[1:40:13] present
[1:40:15] and he would try to do good but evil was
[1:40:18] present and next thing you know they
[1:40:20] beat them they give them Stripes they
[1:40:23] throw them in the innermost part of the
[1:40:25] jail
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:27] fasten them tight
[1:40:33] that's a bad situation
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:37] but Paul
[1:40:39] begins to look at Silas
[1:40:42] can I dramatize here for a minute
[1:40:45] Paul begins to look at Silas
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] and I don't know and you know I pray I
[1:40:52] pray to God I would have the same
[1:40:53] testimony
[1:40:55] that Paul would have
[1:40:57] but it wouldn't be too far-fetched
[1:40:59] for me to say God why'd you do this to
[1:41:02] me
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:04] I did what you asked me to do
[1:41:07] I'm trying to go and preach the gospel I
[1:41:10] cast out an evil spirit like you told me
[1:41:12] to do in mark 16.
[1:41:13] and now I'm right here but Paul didn't
[1:41:16] do that
[1:41:18] Paul
[1:41:19] if you ever want to get the right
[1:41:20] attitude do this
[1:41:22] Paul began to realize
[1:41:26] where God brought him from
[1:41:29] and Paul began to look at Silas and he
[1:41:31] began to say
[1:41:33] Silas
[1:41:36] you don't know
[1:41:37] how happy I am
[1:41:40] Silas myself what are you talking about
[1:41:44] he began to say silence you don't know
[1:41:47] the kind of man I've been
[1:41:51] you don't know what I'm
[1:41:57] about this
[1:41:59] I shouldn't be here I shouldn't have the
[1:42:03] privilege to be in these chains beside
[1:42:07] of you
[1:42:14] and Silas begins to say
[1:42:16] foreign
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:20] I don't deserve this either
[1:42:24] I might not have been as bad as you Paul
[1:42:26] but ever since my youth I I ran from
[1:42:30] Jehovah
[1:42:31] I stole things I got into drugs and
[1:42:34] different things I should have never got
[1:42:35] a part of
[1:42:37] but one day he called me out Paul
[1:42:44] and they began to say oh
[1:42:49] how marvelous it is
[1:42:52] to thank everything that Jesus went
[1:42:54] through for us
[1:42:56] and we could bear a little bit of that
[1:42:58] shame today
[1:43:00] we could bear a little bit of reproach
[1:43:03] for Jesus Christ
[1:43:10] silence began to say oh it just does
[1:43:12] something on the inside of me and Paul
[1:43:15] began to say let's just sing a little
[1:43:17] bit
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:21] how are you looking at your trials
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] how are you looking at your trials
[1:43:31] pains were fast and tied
[1:43:35] but they begin to sing can you imagine
[1:43:39] two people in jail
[1:43:41] singing the Praises of almighty God
[1:43:45] and they just want to lift their hands
[1:43:48] and praise God and give a wave offering
[1:43:51] but they're tied up so they're just
[1:43:53] trying to make some kind of movement
[1:43:56] you might be bound up and you might feel
[1:43:59] like you can't get your hand up
[1:44:02] but just try to make a little bit of
[1:44:04] movement
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:07] I love it because God inhabits the
[1:44:11] Praises of his people
[1:44:17] they begin to make such an atmosphere
[1:44:22] that God Almighty would look down on
[1:44:26] that praise and he would say I just
[1:44:28] can't take it anymore
[1:44:30] I gotta be there I gotta be with them
[1:44:35] and an earthquake
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:42] Ace
[1:44:44] I ain't never seen an earthquake make
[1:44:47] handcuffs come off
[1:44:49] but I ain't trying to figure out God all
[1:44:53] I can tell you is when they were
[1:44:55] praising God
[1:44:56] and they made such an atmosphere
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:01] that prison might as well been a house
[1:45:03] of almighty God
[1:45:05] foreign
[1:45:11] he's great and awesome
[1:45:14] My God is Awesome they begin to sing
[1:45:20] and before they knew it I wonder if they
[1:45:24] were so caught up in the spirit
[1:45:27] that when they came out
[1:45:30] they didn't even realize they were free
[1:45:34] I wonder if there's people in this
[1:45:37] service
[1:45:39] that we're battling something
[1:45:42] before they even knew it they were free
[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:51] it doesn't take much just praise God
[1:46:01] and these kind of atmospheres
[1:46:04] in the atmosphere of almighty God you
[1:46:09] can go free you said I feel bound and
[1:46:13] these chains are heavy it might be a
[1:46:15] strong devil
[1:46:17] but Forever Strong devil
[1:46:20] there's a stronger God
[1:46:24] Forever Strong depression
[1:46:28] there's a greater anointing bringing the
[1:46:32] joy of the Holy Ghost but I say unto you
[1:46:36] it's up to you
[1:46:40] Paul and Silas begin to sing and before
[1:46:44] they knew it they were free I say unto
[1:46:47] you I say
[1:46:50] I say brother Stephen
[1:46:52] rejoice and go free
[1:46:58] my atmosphere is freedom tonight
[1:47:02] if you would like to partake of my
[1:47:05] atmosphere I encourage you raise your
[1:47:10] hands
[1:47:12] praise the most high God and say I am
[1:47:17] free
[1:47:19] I'm free I'm free there's the atmosphere
[1:47:24] I'm free I'm free
[1:47:30] these chains are strong but God is
[1:47:33] stronger I'm free
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] that pornography devil is strong but God
[1:47:41] is stronger
[1:47:45] I say this church of the most high God
[1:47:50] if you can go into Walmart
[1:47:53] and those people can make such an
[1:47:56] atmosphere that you don't feel welcome
[1:47:58] how much more could the Sons and
[1:48:00] Daughters of almighty God make an
[1:48:03] atmosphere this evening wherever the
[1:48:06] devil says I gotta get out of here
[1:48:09] I can't stay here no longer
[1:48:17] I'm not comfortable here
[1:48:20] this ain't my place this is too heavenly
[1:48:24] [Applause]
[1:48:32] you can sit there
[1:48:33] and dwell in that defeated atmosphere if
[1:48:38] you want to
[1:48:39] but as Joshua said for me and my house
[1:48:45] we're going to serve the Lord
[1:48:47] because you don't know where he's
[1:48:49] brought me from
[1:48:51] you don't know what he brought me out of
[1:48:57] he promised me when I was a 15 year old
[1:49:01] boy and I opened this Bible for the
[1:49:03] first time the first thing I ever ran is
[1:49:08] my Grace will be sufficient for thee
[1:49:14] ever since then I've dwelled in that
[1:49:17] atmosphere
[1:49:19] knowing if God is for me who could be
[1:49:23] against me
[1:49:30] you say it's a big devil
[1:49:33] it only takes a little Stone
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:38] I began to think I wonder if David
[1:49:42] created such an atmosphere
[1:49:45] not wonder he did he created such an
[1:49:50] atmosphere
[1:49:51] that when everyone else
[1:49:54] all of it see that's what I'm saying if
[1:49:56] people in the church don't want to
[1:49:57] Rejoice that ain't got to affect you
[1:50:01] come on
[1:50:04] he said who
[1:50:06] when they said who's going to fight
[1:50:07] who's going to fight who's going to
[1:50:10] fight thank God there's a David in every
[1:50:11] age
[1:50:13] David walked up and said who is that
[1:50:18] uncircumcised for this team
[1:50:20] trying to defy the
[1:50:24] the army of the Living God
[1:50:27] who is that uncircumcised for this team
[1:50:31] trying to defy the message of the hour
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:39] is there any David's in here tonight
[1:50:43] Goliath looks big
[1:50:46] Lots look strong but let me tell you
[1:50:50] something David had a promise and David
[1:50:54] had a purpose and David was anointed and
[1:50:59] he began to tell Saul you don't know
[1:51:02] what he's brought me out of brother
[1:51:07] I can't turn against him now
[1:51:13] he created such an atmosphere
[1:51:16] that he convinced the very king of
[1:51:20] Israel a little guy
[1:51:23] little King David but with
[1:51:27] the atmosphere that he built
[1:51:31] Saul would say
[1:51:33] I don't know much about him
[1:51:35] but I'm gonna tell you what he's been
[1:51:37] with God
[1:51:39] and David would go out
[1:51:42] such an atmosphere he didn't run from
[1:51:45] his problems he ran to his problems
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:49] and he was swinging that stone
[1:51:52] and I wonder
[1:51:54] don't worry God's got it all in control
[1:51:57] little sis you ain't got to figure it
[1:51:59] out you just got to throw the stone
[1:52:03] I wonder brother Steve
[1:52:06] I wonder if he let go of that stone and
[1:52:10] the stone went that way
[1:52:15] but he had such an atmosphere about him
[1:52:22] he released The Rock
[1:52:25] maybe it went that way
[1:52:27] but brother God called for a curveball
[1:52:31] and the atmosphere that he built
[1:52:36] rerouted
[1:52:39] God will always fulfill his promises
[1:52:44] even if we get in the way
[1:52:48] even if we release the Rock at the wrong
[1:52:50] time
[1:52:52] in the atmosphere that David created I
[1:52:56] will be Victorious
[1:52:57] and before he knew it he let it go
[1:53:04] it hit the mark
[1:53:08] because God's word will never miss a
[1:53:11] mark foreign
[1:53:12] Church of the Living God if he says
[1:53:16] we're going to take a body change
[1:53:18] [Applause]
[1:53:21] you might not understand it
[1:53:24] but God sent a message to change the
[1:53:28] atmosphere that we can have faith but
[1:53:32] before we know it this mortality
[1:53:36] this Mortal will take on immortality
[1:53:42] it won't be hard the atmosphere will be
[1:53:46] there to do it
[1:53:50] only believe all things
[1:53:54] all things
[1:53:55] are possible
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] changing the atmosphere
[1:54:27] let me tell you a story
[1:54:30] because there's those chains every now
[1:54:31] and then that feel like you can't break
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:36] was that the coast not long ago
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:40] me and my wife went to a shop and when
[1:54:42] we walked out of it out across the sound
[1:54:44] there was this dock
[1:54:46] and on the side of this dock they had
[1:54:48] these giant six seven inch Links of
[1:54:50] chains I would imagine those Chains
[1:54:52] would probably hold a hundred thousand
[1:54:53] pounds
[1:54:54] I used to work with chains lifting heavy
[1:54:56] stuff up when we lift 8 000 pounds we
[1:54:59] didn't need a chain but about that big
[1:55:00] and this chain was about that big
[1:55:02] but I was looking at that chain brother
[1:55:04] Stephen and when I was looking at that
[1:55:06] chain about every six to eight feet that
[1:55:08] chain was broke
[1:55:11] and I began to look at that chain
[1:55:13] and I began to think that's odd I know
[1:55:16] from experience that that chain will
[1:55:18] hold a lot and I mean a lot of weight
[1:55:20] but under its own weight that chain was
[1:55:23] broken
[1:55:25] but you know what it was
[1:55:27] it was in the atmosphere
[1:55:30] of the salt water
[1:55:33] it was in the atmosphere of that salt
[1:55:37] water now listen the first day they put
[1:55:39] those chains out there brother Stephen
[1:55:41] they could hold a hundred thousand
[1:55:42] pounds
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:44] a year later they could still hold a
[1:55:46] hundred thousand pounds
[1:55:48] but as the atmosphere of that salt water
[1:55:53] begin to eat away
[1:55:55] and rust out the year after that they
[1:55:58] could only hold ninety thousand pounds
[1:56:00] and then the year after that because
[1:56:02] corrosion had set in it could only hold
[1:56:04] 70. and then after that it gets even
[1:56:07] worse because the atmosphere of the salt
[1:56:09] water it can only hold 30 000 pounds and
[1:56:13] then the next year it jumps all the way
[1:56:15] down
[1:56:17] to just be able to hold a hundred pounds
[1:56:21] but one day
[1:56:23] in the atmosphere
[1:56:25] of that salt water it might not looked
[1:56:29] like it was doing anything
[1:56:31] but in the atmosphere of the salt water
[1:56:35] that chain one day
[1:56:38] begin to say I can't even hold my own
[1:56:41] way any longer
[1:56:42] and it broke off
[1:56:44] let me tell you something
[1:56:47] Satan might have had you wrapped in some
[1:56:49] hundred thousand pound chains and you
[1:56:52] might have came to church one Sunday and
[1:56:55] it didn't break
[1:56:57] or the next Sunday it didn't break but
[1:57:00] you didn't realize the chain was getting
[1:57:02] weaker
[1:57:07] and then one day
[1:57:10] God sent us Son of God
[1:57:13] to the platform to tell you
[1:57:17] the atmosphere has set you free
[1:57:23] [Music]
[1:57:30] what once had you bound
[1:57:33] you didn't even realize it but in the
[1:57:36] presence of the Son of God faith cometh
[1:57:39] by hearing and hearing of the word of
[1:57:41] God faith is a strength that is greater
[1:57:45] than every chain faith is like that salt
[1:57:48] water and it's rising up and Satan tries
[1:57:51] to tell you it ain't but you realize the
[1:57:53] things you used to battle when you first
[1:57:55] became a Christian you don't battle that
[1:57:58] anymore so you must be getting stronger
[1:58:01] and you get stronger and stronger and it
[1:58:04] might have been a problem you had your
[1:58:06] whole life
[1:58:08] but whatever it was my brother
[1:58:11] the presence of almighty God
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:20] you're free in Jesus
[1:58:24] you say Satan says I'm still man don't
[1:58:27] dwell in that atmosphere
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:31] that's not who you are
[1:58:35] if Satan says I was bound
[1:58:37] if Satan says I was depressed and Satan
[1:58:40] says I don't have joy I would change my
[1:58:43] atmosphere
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:49] when Peter and John pass through the
[1:58:52] gate called Beautiful
[1:58:53] there laid a man who had been crippled
[1:58:55] laying from his mother's womb and he
[1:58:57] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:58:59] such as I have I give you in the name of
[1:59:03] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:59:06] walk
[1:59:07] see and they talk to them and know that
[1:59:10] they were ignorant and unlearned but
[1:59:13] they had taken notice of the atmosphere
[1:59:16] but they had taken notice that they had
[1:59:19] been with Jesus
[1:59:22] see the token was there
[1:59:24] displayed such as I have
[1:59:27] see a poor brother laying there crippled
[1:59:31] and disfigured and everything
[1:59:33] and the same life somebody say same life
[1:59:38] that was in Christ
[1:59:40] was in them
[1:59:42] churches I have in my name ye shall cast
[1:59:48] out devils not I will you will if you
[1:59:52] say to this melon not if I say if you
[1:59:55] say to this mountain oh brother the hour
[1:59:58] of that token to be displayed is at hand
[2:00:01] we can see it we know that we're near
[2:00:03] the end now we brought all kinds of
[2:00:05] messages up to show signs and wonders
[2:00:08] and now we've come back for what the
[2:00:10] church has got to do the token has got
[2:00:13] to be displayed when I see the blood I
[2:00:16] will pass over you nothing else will
[2:00:18] work it must be the blood now the Holy
[2:00:21] Ghost is our token from God
[2:00:24] foreign
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:26] if you have the Holy Ghost it is time to
[2:00:31] speak
[2:00:32] and go forward
[2:00:35] and say this is not the atmosphere
[2:00:38] but I will live in
[2:00:41] but I will live in the holiest of holies
[2:00:43] I don't care what's going on around me
[2:00:47] I gotta skip some of this
[2:00:49] but when
[2:00:51] brother Branham told the story of when
[2:00:54] the death angel would come through the
[2:00:56] land of Egypt
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:01] and they said if I see the blood
[2:01:04] I'll pass over
[2:01:07] brother Branham said the blood today is
[2:01:09] the Holy Ghost the life of the blood
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:13] I believe you have the Holy Ghost
[2:01:15] because you're receptive to the word of
[2:01:17] God
[2:01:18] you believe the word of God and Satan
[2:01:21] will try to talk you out of that but you
[2:01:23] don't have to dwell in that atmosphere
[2:01:26] and
[2:01:27] and brother Branham would tell the story
[2:01:29] how the little boy would come up and say
[2:01:31] father do you not love me he said Son of
[2:01:34] course I love you and he said but father
[2:01:37] did you not hear
[2:01:39] all the firstborn will die

[2:02:18] when they I want you to catch something
[2:02:21] even though Egypt was chaotic
[2:02:26] even though Egypt was going through
[2:02:28] death
[2:02:30] even though Egypt was going through
[2:02:32] plagues
[2:02:34] underneath the blood
[2:02:36] they had nothing to fear
[2:02:40] there was such an atmosphere in the sun
[2:02:44] inside the house
[2:02:46] when you got the Holy Ghost
[2:02:49] on the inside of the inside
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:54] you can dwell in there we're gonna break
[2:02:57] a spirit right here
[2:02:59] you can dwell in there and you ain't got
[2:03:03] to worry about what Russia's saying you
[2:03:05] ain't got to worry about what Ukraine's
[2:03:07] doing you ain't got to worry about
[2:03:10] nuclear warfare
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] when I see the blood
[2:03:17] because let me tell you something
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:21] when those bombs come down
[2:03:31] when those bombs come down
[2:03:35] in the Earthly atmosphere
[2:03:42] we ain't gonna be in this atmosphere
[2:03:46] we're gonna be in a Heavenly atmosphere
[2:03:50] these bodies are gonna be changed
[2:03:55] [Applause]
[2:03:57] I know what it's like to deal with fear
[2:04:00] I know what it's like to deal with
[2:04:02] stress I know what it's like to deal
[2:04:04] with nervousness so strong that you
[2:04:07] can't hardly breathe and it's gripping
[2:04:09] you and you don't know what to do and
[2:04:12] you can't slow your breathing down
[2:04:13] enough to slow down your heart
[2:04:16] but let me tell you what God done for me
[2:04:22] I was so overwhelmed
[2:04:25] didn't know what to do
[2:04:29] but I heard that song
[2:04:31] why should I worry
[2:04:34] why should I fear

[2:05:28] and he showed me I challenge any of you
[2:05:32] name one time he's ever left you alone
[2:05:37] you won't find it you can't find it
