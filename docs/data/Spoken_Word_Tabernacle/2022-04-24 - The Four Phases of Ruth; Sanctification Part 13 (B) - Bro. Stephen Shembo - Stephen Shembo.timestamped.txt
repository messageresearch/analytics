[31:39] amen
[31:44] hallelujah
[31:46] blessed be the name of the lord if you
[31:48] back on youtube you can thank you very
[31:50] much everybody here
[31:52] amen
[31:55] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[31:57] to jeremiah 31.
[32:00] this is pretty deep
[32:02] it's heavy
[32:04] but i put a lot of
[32:06] core material today
[32:08] and lord's willing than when we get to
[32:11] ruth on the
[32:12] wesley
[32:13] it's gonna flow easily and you will
[32:16] understand it amen
[32:18] and i want you to stay awake because
[32:20] this is the biggest trouble in the
[32:21] message
[32:24] i know what i'm talking about the
[32:26] biggest trouble in the message
[32:29] if you dare you can say amen
[32:32] jeremiah chapter 31 verse 31
[32:36] give me a little bit of grace
[32:38] because i cannot rush with this
[32:40] if any error goes here you're locked
[32:43] again in the old system
[32:47] so i have to go slowly a lot of
[32:50] asteroids
[32:52] amen
[32:54] jeremiah 31 31 if you dare you can say
[32:57] amen
[33:00] behold the days come
[33:03] says who
[33:04] the lord
[33:06] that i will make
[33:08] a new covenant
[33:10] with the house of israel
[33:13] and with the house of judah you might be
[33:16] seated
[33:18] if god
[33:19] is willing or wanted to make a new
[33:22] covenant that means that there is
[33:25] already another covenant
[33:27] existing
[33:28] you cannot make a new covenant if there
[33:30] is not an old covenant
[33:33] everybody
[33:34] so the promise here that god is giving
[33:37] israel
[33:38] is a promise
[33:40] of a new covenant
[33:45] do your best
[33:46] not to miss anything
[33:49] i know what i'm talking about verse 32
[33:53] not according
[33:56] to the covenant that are made with their
[33:59] father brother kelly
[34:01] because it's very easy when you change
[34:03] the covenant
[34:05] the people have a tendency to carry the
[34:08] things from the old covenant into the
[34:11] new covenant
[34:13] everybody
[34:14] so god wanted to make sure that this new
[34:16] covenant will be something totally new
[34:20] it will be completely different
[34:24] he has nothing pretty much
[34:27] to do with the old covenant
[34:30] everybody okay so far
[34:32] he said not according
[34:34] to the covenant that are made with their
[34:37] father so there was a covenant
[34:40] that already existed it's an old
[34:42] covenant
[34:44] that was made with the fathers
[34:48] everybody okay
[34:50] and what else
[34:51] what does the covenant say he say
[34:54] not according to the covenant that are
[34:56] made with their fathers in the day that
[34:59] i took them
[35:00] by the hand to bring them out of the
[35:03] land of egypt
[35:05] which my covenant they did water
[35:08] so the first covenant man
[35:10] was not able to keep it
[35:14] man was unable
[35:17] unable to keep it
[35:21] everybody care
[35:22] men broke the covenant
[35:25] everybody okay
[35:27] blessed be the name of the lord
[35:29] he says although i was a husband to them
[35:36] let me read it over again i don't want
[35:38] you to say brother stephen's saying
[35:40] verse 32 not according to the covenant
[35:43] that are made with their fathers
[35:46] in the day that i took them by the hand
[35:49] to bring them out of the land of egypt
[35:52] which my covenant they did what
[35:55] they broke although i was a heart
[36:00] so israel was a what
[36:05] am i reading a different bible
[36:07] so this covenant god say in that
[36:10] covenant
[36:12] i was a husband
[36:15] the husband was god
[36:18] was crossed
[36:21] because christ was following them he was
[36:23] the rock
[36:24] everybody okay now
[36:26] and the wife was israel
[36:31] so it's a covenant of a husband and wife
[36:34] i won't preach on marriage now today
[36:37] maybe on the wesley then i'll dig into
[36:39] it everybody here
[36:41] amen
[36:43] although i was a husband to them say the
[36:46] lord everybody here so far verse 33 but
[36:50] this
[36:51] shall be the covenant the new one
[36:53] that i will make with the house of
[36:55] israel after those days say the lord
[36:58] what is the covenant
[37:00] i will put my law
[37:03] in there
[37:08] let's go slowly give me your time
[37:12] according to the old confidence they
[37:14] hear the law
[37:17] everybody okay
[37:20] this will help you forever in this
[37:22] message
[37:23] or you're going to have a trouble with
[37:25] this message
[37:27] in the old covenant they had a law
[37:31] and the law was written where
[37:34] young people i want to hear your voice
[37:37] on what
[37:39] on stone
[37:41] everybody okay
[37:43] so if they ask you where is the law
[37:48] [Music]
[37:53] am i okay
[37:55] but this new covenant
[37:58] god said it is not like this old one
[38:03] everybody okay
[38:04] i'm still your husband
[38:07] you are still my wife
[38:10] but this covenant i'm gonna put that i'm
[38:14] gonna take my law
[38:16] everybody okay i'm gonna take my law so
[38:19] there is still a law
[38:23] the law have not changed
[38:27] the new covenant
[38:30] the new covenant
[38:32] still
[38:33] have the law
[38:36] but the law
[38:37] god is putting that in your insider
[38:41] in the inward part
[38:44] do you know what that is
[38:48] what
[38:49] the heart
[38:52] why does he put that on the heart
[38:56] why
[38:58] why not on the stone
[39:01] your eyes are open right
[39:03] i will put that covenant in your inward
[39:06] part
[39:08] and i will and will do what
[39:11] so the first law has some writings
[39:17] amen
[39:19] so the second law also have some
[39:22] writings
[39:27] anybody care
[39:28] they're wrote on stones
[39:32] but this one they are riding away
[39:35] in heart
[39:36] how can you write in the heart
[39:39] so bring you surgery pull your heart
[39:43] open it right right right sewing pulling
[39:46] back put you on icu

[40:04] and i will be there
[40:06] and there will be my
[40:12] i will be their god
[40:15] and there will be my water
[40:20] a covenant between god and his people
[40:27] god and people

[40:44] god and your people will be my people a
[40:48] covenant between god and the people
[40:53] everybody okay so far
[40:55] praise be the name of the lord verse 34
[40:59] and in this covenant
[41:01] they shall teach no more every man
[41:05] why do we need a preacher then
[41:10] it's a different teacher
[41:13] everybody here
[41:14] they shall teach no more
[41:17] every man he's
[41:19] and every man his brother saying no the
[41:23] lord
[41:24] they don't come to tell you hey you need
[41:27] to know the lord
[41:30] everybody care
[41:31] not the lord
[41:33] for they shall all know me
[41:38] everybody care
[41:39] from there
[41:42] to there
[41:45] say the lord i will forgive their water
[41:49] and i will remember the sin
[41:55] do you love that covenant
[41:57] so if you have done something
[41:59] even if it's in the record of the prison
[42:04] if you ask god god doesn't remember
[42:07] god doesn't even know when you did it
[42:14] let's go to ezekiel chapter 11.
[42:19] i promise to you this now it's inserted
[42:22] you ready
[42:23] ezekiel chapter 11 i wish everybody was
[42:27] here
[42:28] and i'm recommending whoever is not here
[42:31] to make sure they listen to this
[42:34] because if you continue that's your
[42:37] problem
[42:40] ezekiel 11 verse 18 if you dare you can
[42:42] say amen
[42:45] and they shall come there
[42:48] and they shall take away all the the
[42:52] detestable things thereof
[42:54] and all the abomination
[42:57] thereof from there these people that are
[42:59] coming up need to clean up
[43:02] everybody
[43:04] and i will give them one heart
[43:08] even though it's many members
[43:11] but it's one heart
[43:13] many members body but it's one heart
[43:16] that's why paul said i want you to speak
[43:18] one language
[43:19] on the day of pentecost they were in one
[43:21] accord one heart
[43:24] it's a broad one
[43:26] made of many people one heart anybody
[43:29] care
[43:30] i will give them one heart
[43:33] harmony unity
[43:36] and i will put my new
[43:38] spirit
[43:40] a new spirit
[43:42] within them
[43:44] so
[43:45] god is saying here there are people that
[43:48] will come up and clean
[43:50] with all kind of dirty stuff
[43:53] when they come to me
[43:55] number one i'm gonna give them a heart
[44:01] everybody okay
[44:03] and number two i'm gonna give them
[44:06] a new spirit
[44:09] so those people must have an old spirit
[44:14] anybody care
[44:17] verse
[44:19] 19 i will give them one heart
[44:23] and i will put a new spirit within you
[44:28] and i will take
[44:31] the water
[44:34] oh
[44:39] i thought the law
[44:42] was written on what brother michael
[44:48] if you press your heart right here like
[44:50] this and they do cpr is it a stone
[44:57] everybody here
[44:58] so there is a stony heart
[45:02] a heart of stone
[45:05] anybody care
[45:08] a heart
[45:10] very soft gentle sweet but stone
[45:17] you can beat on it
[45:19] nothing happened
[45:21] but when you talk to them sweet
[45:25] everybody here
[45:28] and i would take the stony heart
[45:30] out of their flesh
[45:34] so god is coming to these people
[45:37] with all kind of uncleanness and god
[45:40] make a surgery
[45:43] and when he makes a surgery number one
[45:46] he get into your heart
[45:49] in stone
[45:51] take it away
[45:54] and back here and do a heart transplant
[46:00] everybody okay
[46:02] and then take your spirit away
[46:05] and do a spirit transplant
[46:11] hallelujah
[46:13] blessed be the name of the lord
[46:16] and i will give them a heart of flesh
[46:20] so this heart here
[46:22] is a heart of flesh
[46:26] i thought you already have the heart of
[46:28] flesh
[46:29] god is calling that a stone
[46:33] what you call flesh god say it's a stone
[46:37] everybody clear
[46:40] verse 20
[46:41] that what is the purpose
[46:44] that i may walk that they may walk in my
[46:48] statute
[46:50] and keep my ordinances and do them
[46:54] and they shall be mine
[46:56] and i will be there
[46:59] so the purpose of this big surgery
[47:05] changing your heart
[47:06] changing your spirit is for you to be
[47:10] able to do the commandment of god
[47:14] i thought you're already doing the
[47:16] commandment of god
[47:20] the purpose is for you the purpose is
[47:24] for you to do the law to do the will of
[47:27] god
[47:31] so
[47:32] with the stony heart
[47:34] it is impossible
[47:38] for you to do the will of god
[47:41] did i lose anybody
[47:43] let's go to ezekiel 18.
[47:48] this is hard
[47:50] stay awake ezekiel 18 verse 30. if you
[47:54] dare you can say amen
[47:57] verse 30

[55:01] in other words you clear now by ezekiel
[55:03] through
[55:04] scripture you need a new heart you need
[55:07] a new spirit and you need the spirit of
[55:10] god
[55:11] everybody
[55:13] and according to jeremiah there is two
[55:16] covenant
[55:17] a covenant written on stone
[55:19] and a covenant written in the heart
[55:24] everybody okay
[55:26] luke chapter five if you dare you can
[55:28] say amen verse 36 then we pray
[55:32] and he spoke also a parable to them
[55:36] no man put a piece of a new garment
[55:41] upon an old
[55:43] if otherwise they
[55:46] both the new makes a rent
[55:49] and the piece that was taken out of the
[55:51] new
[55:52] agrees not with the old
[55:55] there is no agreement
[55:57] you can mix the two together
[56:00] everybody okay
[56:01] verse 37 and no man put new wine you
[56:05] remember the one
[56:07] no man put new one into old water
[56:12] you know who that bottle is right
[56:15] right
[56:17] that's why
[56:19] they have to give you a new
[56:22] a new bottle
[56:26] anybody okay because if they put the new
[56:29] one in the old border
[56:35] you go pentecostal
[56:37] [Music]
[56:38] everybody okay
[56:40] if they put a new one into all the
[56:43] bottle else the new one will burst the
[56:46] border
[56:47] they don't agree
[56:49] everybody okay
[56:51] and be water spill and the border shall
[56:54] do what
[56:56] but new wine
[56:58] must be put into new water
[57:01] and both are water
[57:04] any question so far
[57:07] we clear so far
[57:09] blessed be the name of the lord now
[57:12] let's pray
[57:13] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[57:16] you humbly this morning father thanking
[57:18] you for your grace your love and your
[57:20] mercy and everything you have been doing
[57:23] for us lord we have done what any man
[57:26] that you give an ability to do can do is
[57:29] to open the word of the bible read them
[57:32] lord but when it comes to translating
[57:34] the word interpreting bringing lord the
[57:37] revelation from the word he only takes
[57:40] the action of the holy spirit lord i am
[57:44] not the holy spirit i am just one of the
[57:47] recipient of the holy spirit father may
[57:49] you move me completely out of the way
[57:52] may you come and speak to your children
[57:54] and minister to this church in a
[57:56] supernatural way lord in the name of
[57:59] jesus christ be the alpha and the omega
[58:02] we seal everything that is contrary to
[58:04] your word away from this place in jesus
[58:07] precious name
[58:08] amen
[58:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[58:12] hebrew terrier verse 14 the bible say
[58:16] follow peace with all men
[58:18] and
[58:19] holiness
[58:20] without which no man shall
[58:23] you want to see god
[58:25] what do you need
[58:27] any question my subject this morning is
[58:30] the four phases of roof
[58:33] roof under sanctification
[58:37] you put your seat belt
[58:39] and we go you ready
[58:42] all right
[58:43] when we look into the tabernacle
[58:46] we are talking about a story of a woman
[58:49] that was a gentile
[58:51] that was living in a gentile country and
[58:53] that woman was brought into israel and
[58:57] integrated completely into the royal
[59:00] lineage of israel until the trace of
[59:04] roof cannot be seen anymore
[59:06] everybody okay
[59:08] and that story
[59:10] was not a jewish woman but a gentile
[59:13] woman
[59:14] and paul says in the book of romans
[59:17] that noah
[59:19] not as though the word of god has taken
[59:22] non-effect for they are not all israel
[59:26] which are of israel in other words not
[59:30] everybody that lives in the country of
[59:32] israel that is born under the lineage of
[59:36] abraham is a child of god
[59:38] anybody here
[59:40] paul say neither because they are the
[59:43] seed of abraham
[59:45] are their children
[59:47] but
[59:48] in isaac shall that seed be called in
[59:51] other words the children of the promise
[59:54] that is there which are the children of
[59:56] the flesh the jews
[59:58] these are not the children of god
[1:00:01] anybody here
[1:00:03] so
[1:00:03] you can be born
[1:00:07] naturally speaking
[1:00:09] you are a jew or an israelite anybody
[1:00:13] care
[1:00:14] and somebody is born
[1:00:16] and naturally speaking he's a gentile
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] whatever the other appearances doesn't
[1:00:25] matter to god
[1:00:29] anybody care
[1:00:30] what mother to god
[1:00:32] is what is inside of you
[1:00:36] anybody here
[1:00:37] you might be a gentile on the outside
[1:00:41] but you are a jew on the inside
[1:00:45] anybody here oh you can be a jew on the
[1:00:49] outside but on the inside you are a
[1:00:52] gentile
[1:00:54] everybody here by passport of israel you
[1:00:58] are a jew
[1:01:00] but by passport of heaven you are not a
[1:01:02] jew
[1:01:05] anybody okay
[1:01:06] anybody okay
[1:01:08] so that's why paul is saying that they
[1:01:11] which are the children of the flesh here
[1:01:14] are not the children of god but the
[1:01:17] children of the promise are counted for
[1:01:20] seed
[1:01:21] in other words god had children
[1:01:23] scattered everywhere all over the world
[1:01:28] anybody care
[1:01:29] he only picked israel as an example of
[1:01:34] something but not everybody that is in
[1:01:37] israel was a child of god
[1:01:40] the children of god were scattered all
[1:01:42] around because according to matthew 13
[1:01:45] there is a parable that a man went
[1:01:48] sowing seed and the bible said the field
[1:01:51] was the world so the children of god was
[1:01:54] scattered all around some job in america
[1:01:57] some job in europe some job in australia
[1:02:00] some job in india some job in africa all
[1:02:04] over the world ever here but god now is
[1:02:07] looking for those children not children
[1:02:10] by flesh
[1:02:12] but children on the inside
[1:02:15] everybody
[1:02:16] that's why they can bring somebody
[1:02:19] outside
[1:02:20] they try to put him on israel and they
[1:02:22] reject him
[1:02:25] anybody here you remember them in the
[1:02:27] book of hosea solomon went to marry
[1:02:30] women and brought them rejected from god
[1:02:33] but when they bring roof
[1:02:36] cleanly seen agenda
[1:02:38] when the hook jew roof
[1:02:40] automatically roof enter and sit down
[1:02:44] not on in the congregation of israel
[1:02:47] only but in the royal line
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:02:53] in the very land that jesus christ must
[1:02:56] come
[1:02:57] they insert a roof there and she feed it
[1:03:00] they put rahab they inserted her and she
[1:03:04] faded
[1:03:05] they took bathsheba they put her inside
[1:03:08] and defeated
[1:03:10] these are the children of god on the
[1:03:13] inside
[1:03:14] not the outside
[1:03:16] everybody okay so far i am climbing
[1:03:20] the bible says that other sheep jesus is
[1:03:23] speaking i have
[1:03:26] which are not of this fold
[1:03:28] in other words they are not jewish
[1:03:30] them also i must bring
[1:03:33] they shall hear my voice
[1:03:36] and they shall be
[1:03:38] the church both jews and gentiles into
[1:03:42] with how many shepherds in john 11 the
[1:03:45] bible say and disspect he not of himself
[1:03:48] but being high priest that ear he
[1:03:51] prophesied that jesus should die for
[1:03:54] that nation
[1:03:55] israel and not for that nation only
[1:04:00] but that he should gather together in
[1:04:04] the children of who
[1:04:06] that will water
[1:04:08] that's why sometimes a naomi have to
[1:04:11] leave and when she leaves she hooked you
[1:04:13] a roof and bring roof back with her
[1:04:17] and put her in israel everybody here in
[1:04:20] other words
[1:04:22] in other words roof was a jew inwardly
[1:04:29] that's why she could say my people
[1:04:31] your people will be my people
[1:04:34] everybody here that's not this flesh
[1:04:36] speaking that's the inside man that is
[1:04:39] talking
[1:04:43] everybody here so far
[1:04:45] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:04:47] found out that as she went through her
[1:04:50] journey into the tabernacle we are in
[1:04:53] the holy place where roof is under
[1:04:55] sanctification
[1:04:57] now roof in the holy place
[1:05:01] meets roof
[1:05:02] on the roof serving
[1:05:06] hey mark here
[1:05:07] it means roof under sanctification
[1:05:11] anybody care it means roof under wesley
[1:05:15] and he also means roof under armenianism
[1:05:20] we already talked about the raw holy
[1:05:22] place we talked about roof serving now
[1:05:25] today we are in roof under
[1:05:27] sanctification everybody cares so far
[1:05:30] brother branham says this that
[1:05:33] roof
[1:05:34] serving is roof making herself ready
[1:05:39] and to make herself ready is what is
[1:05:42] called sanctification
[1:05:44] making yourself ready for what
[1:05:48] everybody cares so far brother branham
[1:05:50] said why didn't these other men
[1:05:54] wesley
[1:05:55] luther and those great reformers who
[1:05:58] brought out justification sanctification
[1:06:00] the pentecostal age with the baptism of
[1:06:03] the holy spirit and things why they
[1:06:05] didn't catch these messages
[1:06:08] why didn't they get them
[1:06:10] because they were reformers
[1:06:13] brother bonham said but this
[1:06:16] the reason that all destroying ends
[1:06:20] of the mysterious part of justification
[1:06:24] the mysterious part of sanctification
[1:06:27] the mysterious part of the baptism of
[1:06:29] the holy ghost in other words whatever
[1:06:32] luther preached luther missed some
[1:06:35] mysteries
[1:06:37] wesley missed some mysteries the
[1:06:40] pentecostal miss a mystery and because
[1:06:43] of those mysteries that were missed
[1:06:46] that's why we are in the mess that we
[1:06:48] are in
[1:06:49] today
[1:06:51] everybody okay so far
[1:06:53] as we continue in our journey we found
[1:06:56] out that in the tub and alcohol we have
[1:06:58] six furniture
[1:07:00] and roof have to interact to interact
[1:07:03] with all six furniture
[1:07:05] everybody okay
[1:07:06] when she entering she needs to meet the
[1:07:08] president although
[1:07:10] she got to repent
[1:07:12] repent completely remember that she was
[1:07:14] a sinner and christ died from her and
[1:07:17] from there she's gonna move into the
[1:07:19] baptism everybody okay
[1:07:21] once she complete those two she finished
[1:07:24] the message of luther
[1:07:27] anybody care
[1:07:28] but because of the mysterious part
[1:07:32] that luther missed on the justification
[1:07:35] calvin made a mess
[1:07:40] by taking grace into disgrace
[1:07:43] then as you continue to move you move on
[1:07:46] to the golden candlestick but the
[1:07:48] candlestick will project you to the
[1:07:50] table of the showbread
[1:07:52] everybody
[1:07:53] over there you reach the plateau of
[1:07:56] wesley
[1:07:59] everybody okay so far
[1:08:01] but because of the loose end
[1:08:04] westlake turned into armenianism
[1:08:08] everybody okay
[1:08:09] then the pentecostal opened up with
[1:08:12] seymour and the restoration of the gift
[1:08:15] and because of the missing the
[1:08:18] mysterious part we ended up with billy
[1:08:20] graham and oral robert
[1:08:23] until we reach the message of the hour
[1:08:26] where we're dealing with the pinner of
[1:08:28] fire originally back again in church
[1:08:31] just like he started with paul
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] anybody here because paul had the seed
[1:08:40] and you must end up also with the seed
[1:08:43] and paul had the pillar of fire and you
[1:08:45] must end up again with the pillar of
[1:08:47] fire that's why brother branham say i
[1:08:50] preach like
[1:08:53] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:08:56] far so you stay with the green but be
[1:08:59] careful of the red because justification
[1:09:02] made way to water
[1:09:05] sanctification made way to water
[1:09:08] and the baptism of the holy ghost made
[1:09:10] way to water
[1:09:13] any question so far
[1:09:16] did i lose somebody
[1:09:19] did i lose somebody
[1:09:22] hallelujah

[1:11:48] everybody okay

[1:11:50] because god has a social service in
[1:11:53] israel
[1:11:56] ever here
[1:11:57] and the social service was to take care
[1:12:00] of the poor people

[1:12:04] that if they don't have something to eat
[1:12:07] they have a free social service
[1:12:11] whatever you planting on your field they
[1:12:14] have the right to enter in there
[1:12:16] and eat what they eat but they don't
[1:12:19] take anything home
[1:12:22] if you need the scripture see me after
[1:12:24] church

[1:12:26] that social service also provided for

[1:12:32] field
[1:12:33] and as you picking up your shift if
[1:12:35] something drop
[1:12:37] don't take it
[1:12:39] leave it for the poor people the beggar
[1:12:42] and those that are on the pro those that
[1:12:45] are deprived completely that was god's
[1:12:48] social security that was provided by the
[1:12:51] law
[1:12:54] everybody okay
[1:12:55] so roof in the land
[1:12:58] move or enter the field of boards by law
[1:13:06] the entrance of roof into the field of
[1:13:10] boaz was by law
[1:13:12] it was the law that gave her permission
[1:13:17] to go and to glean anywhere she wanted
[1:13:20] to
[1:13:21] everybody okay so far
[1:13:23] everybody okay so far
[1:13:25] blessed be the name of the lord job to

[2:00:31] not no two tenths
[2:00:34] of the sermon
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:39] everybody here
[2:00:40] everybody here
[2:00:43] lord help me
[2:00:45] lord help me everybody here so far
[2:00:48] this love
[2:00:49] that was crushed at the cross
[2:00:52] that changed the prison
[2:00:54] which means necessity of changing the
[2:00:57] law
[2:00:58] you cannot change the priesthood and
[2:01:00] treat me under the old law
[2:01:05] you change the priesthood
[2:01:07] you change the law
[2:01:09] you change the boss
[2:01:10] you change everything
[2:01:13] everybody here
[2:01:15] new management my friend
[2:01:18] you got it right
[2:01:19] everybody
[2:01:20] here if the ministration of what
[2:01:25] written in water
[2:01:29] this
[2:01:30] law
[2:01:31] was written in stone
[2:01:41] so this law that we are changing
[2:01:44] involves some writings
[2:01:52] you there
[2:01:53] you there
[2:01:54] so if there must be changing of the law
[2:01:58] what is the new law
[2:02:02] galatians 6
[2:02:03] verse 2
[2:02:05] bear you want another's weapon
[2:02:08] and so ye fulfill the water
[2:02:12] the law of moses
[2:02:15] because the law must change
[2:02:17] their law came from moses but grace and
[2:02:20] truth came from
[2:02:22] so if we're changing the priesthood from
[2:02:25] aaron levitical to melchizedek if we're
[2:02:28] changing the law we need to change from
[2:02:31] the law of moses to the law of christ
[2:02:35] what is the law of christ
[2:02:41] the law of christ say to bear one
[2:02:45] another's what
[2:02:49] let's go slowly
[2:02:51] first corinthians chapter nine
[2:02:53] for though i be free from all men
[2:02:57] yet have i made myself servant untoward
[2:03:01] that i may get who
[2:03:04] paul say i'm free
[2:03:08] nobody can hook me
[2:03:10] i know what the cross did for me
[2:03:12] but sometime i make myself servant the
[2:03:15] reason why i'm doing that i just want to
[2:03:18] gain somebody
[2:03:20] what are you talking about paul
[2:03:22] and on twitter
[2:03:24] i became as a
[2:03:26] paul was a jew he was an israelite as an
[2:03:29] israel as a jew that amen gender jew
[2:03:33] to them that are undead
[2:03:35] because the jew from the tribe of judah
[2:03:38] under the law takes all israel
[2:03:40] as under the law that i may get them
[2:03:43] that are under
[2:03:45] to them that are without the law the
[2:03:47] gentile as we died there
[2:03:51] stop there what is paul saying
[2:03:54] paul was a master in theology
[2:03:58] he knew everything in the temple
[2:04:00] so when paul is walking paul is free
[2:04:03] from the law of moses but when he goes
[2:04:06] into the temple and he met a pharisee
[2:04:10] and paul looked from there he said
[2:04:12] that's a pharisee
[2:04:14] paul say okay
[2:04:15] since i'm a pharisee i'm dealing with a
[2:04:18] pharisee no problem
[2:04:20] anybody here
[2:04:21] paul come there
[2:04:23] he enter into the restaurant
[2:04:25] who's there you see pharisee okay
[2:04:28] pharisee in the restaurant
[2:04:29] where is the water to wash
[2:04:33] to wash your hands
[2:04:35] they bring water paul washes the water
[2:04:38] just like the jew does wash the water
[2:04:41] paul is not doing that
[2:04:44] because he's under the law
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:51] here
[2:04:52] he's watching the hand so when the
[2:04:54] pharisees looking
[2:04:56] he said
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:04:58] that's a pharisee
[2:05:00] paul say i got you

[2:08:39] everybody okay so far can i continue
[2:08:43] paul say now being not without the law
[2:08:46] of god
[2:08:48] even though i'm doing this it is not
[2:08:51] that i am not under the law
[2:08:53] oh paul i thought you were out of the
[2:08:55] law
[2:08:56] paul say but under the law to who
[2:09:00] my law that i'm operating this way it is
[2:09:04] no more the law of moses i am under a
[2:09:07] different law because the president
[2:09:10] already stopped the law for me he
[2:09:13] changed the priesthood for me and he
[2:09:16] also changed the law i am no longer
[2:09:19] under fear
[2:09:21] under trembling
[2:09:23] i am living in the love of jesus christ
[2:09:28] everybody okay so far
[2:09:30] now let's go back to jeremiah
[2:09:33] lord help me
[2:09:35] the bible says this in hebrew
[2:09:37] if the first covenant you remember
[2:09:41] had been faultless then should no place
[2:09:43] have been sought for the what
[2:09:46] meaning the first one had fault
[2:09:48] because the people were trembling if you
[2:09:50] touch the mountain god kill you
[2:09:52] if the animal touch they kill him all
[2:09:55] the time even if the high priest who's
[2:09:57] the top highest man if he goes to the
[2:09:59] temple the high priest is praying in the
[2:10:01] morning jehovah don't kill me don't kill
[2:10:03] me don't kill me when he goes there he's
[2:10:05] trembling
[2:10:06] because if something happened they put a
[2:10:08] cord on him if he dies there nobody
[2:10:10] entered it they have to pull him from
[2:10:12] there
[2:10:14] so you can enter you don't know what is
[2:10:15] coming out there until you come out
[2:10:18] that's the law of moses ever here
[2:10:21] for finding fault with them
[2:10:23] god said
[2:10:25] behold the days come
[2:10:27] say the lord when i will make a new
[2:10:30] water
[2:10:33] with the house of israel and with the
[2:10:35] house of judah that was in jeremiah paul
[2:10:37] is calling jeremiah in hebrew so when we
[2:10:40] quote brother branham there is no
[2:10:41] problem
[2:10:43] not according to the covenant
[2:10:46] that i'm made with there
[2:10:49] in the day when i took them by the hand
[2:10:51] to lead them out of the land of egypt
[2:10:53] you remember this because they continue
[2:10:55] not in my covenant and i regret them not
[2:10:59] say the lord
[2:11:00] for this is the covenant i will make
[2:11:03] with the house of israel after those
[2:11:05] days
[2:11:06] says the lord i will put my law in there
[2:11:11] and i will do what
[2:11:14] in there
[2:11:15] and i will be to them as uh
[2:11:18] and they shall be uh
[2:11:20] the law always requires a place of
[2:11:24] writings
[2:11:29] when he was the law of moses god needed
[2:11:32] stone
[2:11:33] and he wrote on stone moses destroyed he
[2:11:36] said moses go make stone again because
[2:11:39] he's come the second time god wrote in
[2:11:41] stone
[2:11:42] hey back here
[2:11:43] now there is a change in the law
[2:11:46] anybody here
[2:11:48] everybody okay when they change the law
[2:11:51] there is a new law if a new law comes
[2:11:54] god needs some tables
[2:11:59] everybody okay
[2:12:01] this time he doesn't need rock
[2:12:04] anymore he needs a heart
[2:12:08] to write something on your heart
[2:12:13] you're gonna get there soon
[2:12:15] everybody okay
[2:12:16] what happened
[2:12:18] god
[2:12:19] writes
[2:12:21] just like us
[2:12:24] how does god write
[2:12:25] in the book of daniel the bible say when
[2:12:28] belt says
[2:12:29] while he tasted the wine
[2:12:32] this is not the good wine this is the
[2:12:34] wine of babylon
[2:12:36] commanded to bring the golden
[2:12:39] and the silver vessel which of his
[2:12:41] father nebuchadnezzar has taken out of
[2:12:44] the temple which was in jerusalem
[2:12:46] and the king and his princes his wife
[2:12:49] and his concubine might drink therein so
[2:12:52] this one make him lose his mind
[2:12:55] our mind put us in the our wine put us
[2:12:58] in the right mind but the wine of the
[2:13:00] prostitute in babylon in revelation 17
[2:13:04] if you drink that wine it turn your head
[2:13:06] against god
[2:13:08] so it depends on which one you're taking
[2:13:12] everybody here
[2:13:13] then they brought not the silver
[2:13:17] he asked for the golden and the silver
[2:13:20] and they brought there
[2:13:23] so the golden vessels means the vessel
[2:13:25] that was on the showbreath
[2:13:30] everybody okay did i lose you because
[2:13:32] the other vessels were in brass and
[2:13:34] everything but inside there everything
[2:13:37] was gold pure gold pure gold so they
[2:13:40] went and took the vessels that was from
[2:13:43] the drink offering and they want to pour
[2:13:45] another wine in the drink coffee
[2:13:50] everybody okay
[2:13:52] okay and the golden vessel that were
[2:13:55] taken out of the temple of the house of
[2:13:57] god which was at jerusalem and the king
[2:14:00] and his princess and his wife his wife
[2:14:02] and his concubine drunk in them and they
[2:14:06] drank water
[2:14:08] and did what
[2:14:10] so their wine also when you drink it it
[2:14:12] bring praises just like our wine we
[2:14:15] drink it he also bring praise the law is
[2:14:18] still the same
[2:14:20] but the praise is to the devil and the
[2:14:22] praises to god depending on the origin
[2:14:24] of wine
[2:14:27] everybody okay
[2:14:29] okay and they praise the gods of water
[2:14:32] so when you drink this one it brings
[2:14:35] places to your deity
[2:14:37] because it's a drink offering
[2:14:40] everybody clear
[2:14:41] of silver of brass of iron of wood and
[2:14:45] of stone
[2:14:46] in the same hour
[2:14:48] came the water
[2:14:50] of a man's hand and wrote over against
[2:14:54] the word
[2:14:58] these candlesticks are the candlestick
[2:15:01] of babylon
[2:15:06] and against them there was a light in
[2:15:08] the wall
[2:15:09] and the pillar of fire went not on the
[2:15:11] candlestick against the candlestick
[2:15:13] because in the temple against the
[2:15:15] candlestick was the table of children
[2:15:17] which also have the word of god
[2:15:22] the lord's still the same
[2:15:24] ever here
[2:15:25] upon the plaster of the wall of the king
[2:15:28] palace and the king saw the part of the
[2:15:30] hand that wrote
[2:15:32] what does it mean the finger of god
[2:15:37] you ready
[2:15:38] in luke 11 the bible says jesus say
[2:15:42] if by berezaboom cast out the devils
[2:15:48] by whom do your son cast them out so
[2:15:51] these jews also were casting devils
[2:15:54] and when jesus casted therefore they
[2:15:56] said you did it by the elizabeth jesus
[2:15:58] said if i did it by being able your
[2:16:01] children that are casting demon all the
[2:16:03] time here on tv
[2:16:05] on youtube the casting devil they're
[2:16:06] casting them by what
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:11] so you can cast out the devil and not
[2:16:13] being on the right path
[2:16:16] not because somebody's casting out
[2:16:18] therefore they have power
[2:16:22] everybody okay
[2:16:23] he said therefore shall they be your
[2:16:26] judge
[2:16:27] but if i
[2:16:29] with the what
[2:16:32] the water
[2:16:33] so the casting of devils by jesus jesus
[2:16:37] called that he was casting them by the
[2:16:40] finger of god
[2:16:46] everybody okay
[2:16:48] matthew 12
[2:16:50] if by beelzebub cast out the devil by
[2:16:53] whom do your children cast them out
[2:16:56] therefore they shall be your
[2:16:58] repetition but if i cut therefore by
[2:17:01] there
[2:17:03] so the fingers of god means the
[2:17:07] any question
[2:17:10] exodus and the magician did so with the
[2:17:13] enchantment they bring four flies to
[2:17:16] bring four flies but they could not
[2:17:18] moses did the copy moses did the copy
[2:17:20] after a while moses did something they
[2:17:23] tried it's not working yeah everybody
[2:17:25] here so they were last upon men and upon
[2:17:28] beast then the magician said unto
[2:17:30] pharaoh this is the
[2:17:33] in other words this is there
[2:17:36] everybody okay now
[2:17:39] where are we going with the finger of
[2:17:41] god
[2:17:42] exodus you okay now
[2:17:44] let's drop down i have to cut off
[2:17:47] i have to preach sanctification part one
[2:17:49] part two part three
[2:17:51] ever here
[2:17:52] and he gave out to moses when he had
[2:17:56] made an end of communing with him upon
[2:17:58] monsanto two table of water
[2:18:01] table of what
[2:18:04] written with there
[2:18:07] everybody okay
[2:18:09] that is the old
[2:18:11] covenant
[2:18:13] second corinthian
[2:18:15] year hour
[2:18:18] in our heart known and what
[2:18:21] of all
[2:18:23] for as much as he had manifestly
[2:18:26] declared to be the episode of who
[2:18:30] ministered by us
[2:18:31] written not with
[2:18:35] but with the
[2:18:39] not in the temple of
[2:18:42] but in there
[2:18:50] any question
[2:18:51] any question
[2:18:53] so the changing of the law
[2:18:56] require a changing of the covenant
[2:19:01] and the changing of the covenant ever
[2:19:05] here the changing of the covenant bring
[2:19:09] another covenant
[2:19:11] but that covenant have writings also
[2:19:15] everybody here
[2:19:16] but god
[2:19:18] doesn't need stone anymore
[2:19:21] god is requiring
[2:19:23] heart
[2:19:25] everybody here
[2:19:26] he want to put the riding not on stone
[2:19:29] but in the heart
[2:19:32] what are you trying to get
[2:19:34] with this heart here everybody here
[2:19:38] get me here so probably i'm going to
[2:19:39] stop here
[2:19:41] when you are born in this message
[2:19:45] you look probably like this
[2:19:51] everybody okay
[2:19:52] your dress looking good
[2:19:55] your face clean
[2:19:57] your hair longer
[2:19:59] you you look just like roof
[2:20:02] if they need to give somebody the holy
[2:20:04] ghost they will give it to you
[2:20:10] everybody okay
[2:20:11] when you are born outside of the message
[2:20:15] this is how you look
[2:20:20] if they ask who need to go to hell
[2:20:22] everybody will point to this one
[2:20:27] body part hanging out
[2:20:29] here cut down
[2:20:30] ready to murder somebody
[2:20:36] everybody okay
[2:20:38] but since we are dealing with the heart
[2:20:42] everybody here let's take our microscope
[2:20:46] and let's enter into the inside
[2:20:49] and look at the heart of someone born in
[2:20:51] a message
[2:20:52] and the heart of somebody born outside
[2:20:55] of the messenger
[2:21:00] everybody here
[2:21:01] the heart of this woman
[2:21:04] that is born outside of the message is
[2:21:07] black
[2:21:08] everybody will say amen
[2:21:14] snake
[2:21:17] ready to bite somebody
[2:21:19] everybody okay
[2:21:21] god is looking for heart
[2:21:25] god is looking for heart
[2:21:27] because he has a law
[2:21:28] he need to deliver a law somewhere
[2:21:31] but he cannot put the law in the stone
[2:21:33] because the law in the stone man could
[2:21:35] not leave it
[2:21:37] he took his law now he's looking at the
[2:21:39] lord not the law of moses but the law of
[2:21:42] christ which is love
[2:21:44] he's trying to pour that loss somewhere
[2:21:46] if i pour that on stone it didn't work
[2:21:49] now i'm looking for different stone
[2:21:53] but when god look in your heart he found
[2:21:55] the stone
[2:21:57] that stone that god saw is your heart
[2:22:01] everybody
[2:22:03] but if god put his law on your stony
[2:22:07] heart
[2:22:08] you will behave like jewish people
[2:22:16] so god have to change your heart
[2:22:22] and give you a new heart
[2:22:26] to put his law
[2:22:28] on a different kind of material
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:32] because the stunning heart remind god
[2:22:36] the love of moses
[2:22:37] and the failure of man
[2:22:40] and the
[2:22:42] and the
[2:22:43] incapacity of men to do the will of god
[2:22:48] when god look he said i need a stone
[2:22:50] somebody said you look in their heart
[2:22:52] they have a bunch of stone there god
[2:22:53] said
[2:22:55] if i put their law again i put it in a
[2:22:57] stone look what they did i came they
[2:22:59] crucified me myself
[2:23:01] i cannot do that anymore i need to give
[2:23:04] them a different heart
[2:23:06] because i need to write my new covenant
[2:23:09] i need to write them on a heart but not
[2:23:12] a heart of a stone i have to take the
[2:23:15] stone away and give them a new
[2:23:21] everybody here
[2:23:23] this one as much as clean she look on
[2:23:26] the outside
[2:23:27] her
[2:23:29] heart looks also like that
[2:23:40] you might live just as pure
[2:23:43] and
[2:23:45] and
[2:23:46] and yet beer
[2:23:51] that's why brother branham said god
[2:23:53] doesn't have grandchildren
[2:23:55] you don't go to god and say grandpa
[2:23:58] god doesn't have grandchildren
[2:24:00] he only have sons and daughters
[2:24:03] you don't approach god as a grandpa
[2:24:07] ever here
[2:24:08] it is your faith
[2:24:11] that saves you many people they are just
[2:24:14] as pure and clean and yet a lot cleaner
[2:24:17] sometimes than people who profess
[2:24:20] christian lives
[2:24:22] but yet who denied the holy ghost
[2:24:25] would deny every operation of the power
[2:24:28] of god
[2:24:30] they are unbelievers
[2:24:33] no matter they are very welcome
[2:24:36] so both of you born in a message born
[2:24:40] outside of the message your heart look
[2:24:42] like that
[2:24:47] everybody cares so far
[2:24:49] then god
[2:24:51] by the cross
[2:24:53] everybody
[2:24:55] changes in your heart
[2:24:58] i'm going slowly
[2:25:00] everybody okay and i'm going to stop
[2:25:02] somewhere
[2:25:04] if you look at this heart
[2:25:06] even though it changed
[2:25:08] the snake is still there
[2:25:14] and whatever is on the outside here is
[2:25:17] still there
[2:25:18] and the atmosphere is still there
[2:25:22] don't get somebody like this married
[2:25:26] a bunch of marriage in the message
[2:25:29] is like this one
[2:25:34] but here
[2:25:35] because they're taking this
[2:25:37] plus this
[2:25:38] they say she is a believer
[2:25:43] later on
[2:25:44] trouble
[2:25:45] down the road
[2:25:46] everybody here
[2:25:48] why do we still have this stuff outside
[2:25:52] brother branham and i'm going to stop
[2:25:55] we believe in justification by faith
[2:25:58] romans 5 1 we believe that a person
[2:26:00] after he's justified by faith he has
[2:26:03] peace with the lord jesus christ
[2:26:05] but it's possible that this same person
[2:26:08] could have
[2:26:10] such as
[2:26:12] smoking doing things that he should not
[2:26:14] do filthy water
[2:26:16] yet looking clean
[2:26:21] everybody okay
[2:26:22] demon spirit is arising
[2:26:25] sure they are they have always been
[2:26:27] there they will be until
[2:26:31] they live right in the people and people
[2:26:34] don't know they give them unclean habit
[2:26:39] sickness
[2:26:40] disease
[2:26:41] because
[2:26:42] uh and all kind everything is caused by
[2:26:46] a
[2:26:46] spirit today he must smoke drink curse
[2:26:51] do things that his habit is hanging on
[2:26:54] to him
[2:26:55] it's just rooted in there it's water
[2:26:58] habits are water so when you are coming
[2:27:02] in the altar
[2:27:03] god kills the love for you
[2:27:07] god changed the covenant for you
[2:27:10] god changed the law for you
[2:27:13] and god does it because he's looking for
[2:27:16] a new heart
[2:27:18] ever here so god have to take your stony
[2:27:22] heart
[2:27:23] and change it into this kind of heart
[2:27:27] that is called the new heart
[2:27:36] but your process is not finished
[2:27:39] because you still have habit hanging
[2:27:41] around
[2:27:42] you still have the snake
[2:27:44] that's why god have to change and give
[2:27:47] you anew
[2:27:52] the mystery of the new birth
[2:27:55] everybody okay so far
[2:27:57] what else the new heart means
[2:28:00] and we stop here
[2:28:02] i shall take away the old stony heart
[2:28:05] and i give you uh
[2:28:08] that is the first order
[2:28:11] some of them stop in that first order
[2:28:15] she got baptized
[2:28:17] she looked clean
[2:28:18] now she's ready
[2:28:20] do you know a good sister to marry that
[2:28:22] one
[2:28:23] get her in the marriage a devil in the
[2:28:26] home
[2:28:27] [Music]
[2:28:29] only takes cross hair and the snake does
[2:28:31] this and you see the sister begin to do
[2:28:33] this
[2:28:37] everybody here
[2:28:38] brother branham said do not let them
[2:28:40] buried
[2:28:43] because it's going to be hell
[2:28:45] everybody here
[2:28:47] that is the first of them now you just
[2:28:49] getting started
[2:28:51] god's new heart that he put in you set
[2:28:54] right in the center of you
[2:28:57] that is your impulse
[2:29:01] that is your water
[2:29:03] so god have to change your heart
[2:29:07] because you and god were enemies
[2:29:12] they were enmity between you and god
[2:29:14] by going to the cross you made peace
[2:29:18] with god you are justified now your
[2:29:21] emotions
[2:29:24] your new heart gives you good emotion
[2:29:28] good impulse
[2:29:30] good vibration toward
[2:29:34] god you begin to have good feeling
[2:29:38] when they talk to you about god
[2:29:40] at the beginning they tell you about god
[2:29:42] you don't want to hear it
[2:29:46] oh god help me
[2:29:49] let me go with this
[2:29:51] god had to give you a new heart
[2:29:54] not a patchwork
[2:29:57] a patch up one a new heart that is your
[2:30:00] what
[2:30:02] intellect that you think with
[2:30:05] a new way of what
[2:30:08] i'm going slowly i'm going slowly
[2:30:12] okay
[2:30:14] when he gives you a new way of what
[2:30:18] yes that's right the bible looks more
[2:30:21] reasonable
[2:30:23] i used to didn't believe that
[2:30:25] i believe it now
[2:30:27] what happened to you you just got a new
[2:30:29] heart
[2:30:32] that's why they do something it makes
[2:30:33] sense
[2:30:34] at the beginning it was foolishness
[2:30:39] you don't have the holy ghost yet
[2:30:43] everybody
[2:30:44] okay it looks good i believe it now now
[2:30:48] there is your great revival
[2:30:51] they say yeah sure i don't want to go to
[2:30:53] hell i want to accept christ that's all
[2:30:56] right that's good that is just your
[2:30:58] first step then he said after that
[2:31:02] then i will give you a new
[2:31:05] what is that and you
[2:31:10] i want to do
[2:31:12] let's hold on to that
[2:31:14] we are with the new heart
[2:31:16] father we want to be like moses we want
[2:31:19] to be led by your holy son jesus christ
[2:31:22] to eternal life give it to our heart
[2:31:25] tonight
[2:31:26] lord tear out the order
[2:31:30] bless into us there
[2:31:33] the new heart of what
[2:31:35] the heart that you can
[2:31:38] and you can
[2:31:40] and we will not be water
[2:31:42] and water
[2:31:44] that is what god does to you first when
[2:31:47] you come out from the altar
[2:31:49] that's why you begin to go back to
[2:31:51] church now easily because you just got a
[2:31:54] new heart
[2:31:56] but you don't have the holy ghost yet
[2:31:59] don't venture yourself
[2:32:02] you're gonna find yourself in failure
[2:32:04] because that's what happened somebody
[2:32:06] with a new heart get under the emotion
[2:32:09] oh i felt so good tomorrow he goes back
[2:32:12] same thing on the floor
[2:32:14] what i thought i have the holy ghost
[2:32:17] somebody didn't teach you well
[2:32:21] everybody okay so far
[2:32:23] brother branham cross does an anoint
[2:32:25] minister to preach the gospel just to
[2:32:28] have it to return back to him void
[2:32:30] hey but here but he expects you to
[2:32:33] receive the word
[2:32:34] and when you receive the word be take
[2:32:38] the old cohide cowhide
[2:32:41] you have been in over there that all for
[2:32:45] more condition and swap it off for a
[2:32:48] sheepskin that
[2:32:51] to the what
[2:32:53] everything the bible said you say
[2:32:56] but it must come from there
[2:33:01] your new heart was stoned
[2:33:04] you were not flexible to the world
[2:33:07] when they preach you reject
[2:33:09] when they preach you resent
[2:33:11] but suddenly you notice in your life you
[2:33:14] begin to agree with certain things
[2:33:16] what happened is god already transformed
[2:33:19] your heart
[2:33:20] he gave you a heart that you become
[2:33:23] flexible to the word
[2:33:25] because god is trying to pour wine
[2:33:29] but he cannot pour a new one
[2:33:32] in all the vessels
[2:33:35] he gotta give you a new heart
[2:33:38] before he pour a new one so when the one
[2:33:41] begin to do this you can also flex with
[2:33:44] it
[2:33:49] oh
[2:33:50] god god have mercy
[2:33:53] the new one only ferments wine
[2:33:57] he only verified the element that is in
[2:34:00] there
[2:34:01] there is the only process for the bulb
[2:34:04] of the alcohol which make it bursting
[2:34:07] procession
[2:34:09] as they use bust the little bubble to
[2:34:12] make it more
[2:34:14] to give it a better
[2:34:16] to give it a better
[2:34:19] substantial holding to make it more
[2:34:22] and to make it so eaker
[2:34:28] but wine will never sour
[2:34:31] because the germ of life is in the wine
[2:34:34] fermenting
[2:34:36] pushing and doing water
[2:34:39] it's there to kill germa
[2:34:43] because your heart is with habit and a
[2:34:45] snake in it
[2:34:47] ever here so god cannot take his new
[2:34:50] wine
[2:34:51] his stimulation of the revelation and
[2:34:53] pour that in you you're gonna spill it
[2:34:57] you don't take a pearl and give it to
[2:34:58] the swan
[2:35:00] i have to change you from a swan
[2:35:03] into a lamb
[2:35:05] give you a new heart so when i pour wine
[2:35:08] when i say something you begin to at
[2:35:10] least agree with me
[2:35:12] and your vibration even though you don't
[2:35:14] understand me very well but your emotion
[2:35:18] to me is good
[2:35:23] everybody here
[2:35:25] where am i going to stop
[2:35:27] once you finish there you get in the
[2:35:30] water baptism and you come out just like
[2:35:33] that
[2:35:37] everybody here
[2:35:39] you move to the candlestick

[2:35:49] if i touch you and mentor this message
[2:35:52] he will now have no effect on you
[2:35:55] anybody here

[2:36:00] into the land i have to sprinkle clean
[2:36:03] water on you

[2:39:24] of fear
[2:39:26] and trembling and complex but you are
[2:39:29] entering now with the law of boars
[2:39:33] and the law of borders his commandment
[2:39:37] you don't do it anymore under fear
[2:39:42] you don't do it on the complex
[2:39:45] you're doing it free
[2:39:47] you don't need anybody to be around you
[2:39:55] anybody here
[2:39:56] ever here because the law of moses will
[2:40:00] keep you on the internet
[2:40:02] when mommy comes you flip
[2:40:05] that's moses
[2:40:08] the law
[2:40:09] of christ
[2:40:11] whether mum is dead
[2:40:13] or mommy's not home
[2:40:15] it is not about mummy
[2:40:18] it is about boaz
[2:40:24] a man that never seen me
[2:40:27] a man that never knew me a man that
[2:40:30] never seen my picture a man that only
[2:40:33] heard my story
[2:40:36] when i took decision
[2:40:39] and with naomi about coming to a land
[2:40:42] and the first time he sees me
[2:40:46] he's treating me better than anybody
[2:40:48] else in my life
[2:40:53] everybody here
[2:40:54] all he's asking me stay in the field
[2:40:58] continue to do the work
[2:41:00] you are hungry are already provided you
[2:41:02] are thirsty are already provided nobody
[2:41:05] will touch you
[2:41:06] all he's asking me is this
[2:41:10] cannot disappoint the man
[2:41:14] ever here cannot disappoint the man
[2:41:18] ever here
[2:41:19] even though
[2:41:21] i can go
[2:41:22] and get whatever i want in the kitchen i
[2:41:26] am not going to abuse it
[2:41:28] because i don't want to disappoint him
[2:41:31] [Music]
[2:41:34] boaz told me
[2:41:36] whenever you hungry go eat
[2:41:39] and when i finish i take some home but
[2:41:42] i'm not gonna go into boa's place and
[2:41:46] get 10
[2:41:47] big bags and go with it at home
[2:41:50] he's not gonna do anything
[2:41:53] he will still will leave me
[2:41:55] but because of what he did i want to be
[2:41:58] mindful to him
[2:42:00] i want to respect him i want to respect
[2:42:03] his thing i want to respect his property
[2:42:06] i want to respect his work even these
[2:42:09] workers are my servant i cannot treat
[2:42:12] them bad
[2:42:14] i have to treat them good because they
[2:42:16] are the worker of the one who showed me
[2:42:19] grace
[2:42:21] [Music]
[2:42:25] not i don't want to treat the worker bad
[2:42:28] because they're going to report to me in
[2:42:30] boaz
[2:42:31] no
[2:42:32] they can report me that's not the
[2:42:34] problem but reporting me to boast i
[2:42:37] don't want people to be talking about me
[2:42:40] all the time boaz she did this board she
[2:42:43] did this but what she did these boys she
[2:42:45] did this so i'm gonna behave not because
[2:42:48] of them
[2:42:50] because of
[2:42:54] because i'm no longer under the law of
[2:42:56] moses
[2:42:57] i am serving under the law of christ
[2:43:02] the law of christ is a law but it's
[2:43:05] operated differently
[2:43:09] let's stop here we will continue on
[2:43:11] sanctification
[2:43:13] let's stand
[2:43:28] sorry church but this is something you
[2:43:30] got out of the lord amen
[2:43:35] you have to leave the place where this
[2:43:36] message is just a law
[2:43:40] amen
[2:43:41] this message was not a law
[2:43:44] coming to church is not a law
[2:43:46] after you go through this
[2:43:48] you will see your coming to church will
[2:43:50] change
[2:43:52] if you are doing that because some come
[2:43:54] to church because of religion
[2:43:57] everybody care all it takes is something
[2:43:59] happened the out of church
[2:44:01] iran and the out of church they call for
[2:44:04] god's place higher they're out of church
[2:44:06] everything is out of church they have
[2:44:08] not understood boaz yet
[2:44:13] you have not understood boaz yet
[2:44:15] you don't understand who is protecting
[2:44:17] you a job
[2:44:20] you don't understand who's protecting
[2:44:22] you from coronavirus
[2:44:24] you don't understand who's giving you
[2:44:26] the strength to drive in the morning
[2:44:28] you don't understand who's protecting
[2:44:30] you on the highway when you go into work
[2:44:33] you don't understand who is keeping your
[2:44:35] husband when he's out you don't
[2:44:37] understand who is with you when you're
[2:44:38] driving that truck on the highway you
[2:44:41] don't understand who's with you when
[2:44:43] you're traveling
[2:44:44] the day you will understand who is doing
[2:44:47] to you all these favors
[2:44:50] then your serving of god
[2:44:52] will change
[2:44:55] you're not going to serve god because of
[2:44:57] me
[2:44:58] i'm going to show you this even in your
[2:45:00] offering
[2:45:05] i'm going to show you this i'm going to
[2:45:06] jump with this down until you see what
[2:45:09] you're doing
[2:45:11] because you miss boaz
[2:45:13] you enter into his field with the law
[2:45:17] you enter in the message with the law
[2:45:20] because everybody is wearing paint when
[2:45:22] you look the whole church wearing skirt
[2:45:24] in your mind so in that church they
[2:45:27] don't wear paint that's how you enter in
[2:45:29] the message wrong
[2:45:30] wrong door
[2:45:32] wrong door it is true in their church
[2:45:34] they don't wear paint but why don't they
[2:45:37] wear paint
[2:45:40] because when you're entering you're
[2:45:42] afraid you say if i go there everybody
[2:45:44] will be looking at me with a paint
[2:45:46] that's why i have to find some kind of
[2:45:48] skirt and usually when they put a skirt
[2:45:51] you will see it's a little bit right
[2:45:52] here you know that they're trying to
[2:45:54] cope a little bit with you because they
[2:45:56] don't want to embarrass anybody
[2:45:59] and then when they go home what do they
[2:46:00] do
[2:46:01] they put the shirt back again
[2:46:03] under the law
[2:46:05] i'm coming to your church oh those
[2:46:07] churches they don't wear a pen
[2:46:09] she found one
[2:46:11] you go see her at walmart tomorrow in
[2:46:13] the evening paint under the law of moses
[2:46:16] that's not the way i want to deal with
[2:46:18] you
[2:46:20] you don't understand if you wear paint
[2:46:22] at home come with paint
[2:46:28] come with paint and let us preach you
[2:46:30] paint
[2:46:31] everybody here we're going to preach
[2:46:33] that paint right in the face
[2:46:36] and when you're taking up the plant
[2:46:37] you're not taking up the pen because of
[2:46:39] me because if you take because of me
[2:46:41] you're still struggling
[2:46:44] i'm gonna teach you how brother branham
[2:46:46] say how do we sanctify
[2:46:52] because this snake
[2:46:53] need to be
[2:46:55] you need to to control it
[2:46:58] but there is a way you control snake
[2:47:01] let's pray heavenly father
[2:47:04] lord we thank you again father for your
[2:47:06] grace
[2:47:07] for your love
[2:47:08] for your mercy and for everything you
[2:47:11] are unfolding to us
[2:47:13] father i believe your children caught
[2:47:15] the point
[2:47:17] of what the cross
[2:47:19] have done in our life lord
[2:47:22] father usually we sing at the cross at
[2:47:24] the cross
[2:47:25] but when we look at the cross we usually
[2:47:28] see
[2:47:29] the death of somebody who took our place
[2:47:32] somebody who paid out who paid our price
[2:47:35] somebody who took away our sin
[2:47:38] somebody who died because of the world
[2:47:40] and that's the better and the further we
[2:47:42] can go further
[2:47:44] but lord this morning you have unfolded
[2:47:46] to us
[2:47:47] that the cross means more to us
[2:47:50] because if we miss what the cross did to
[2:47:53] us
[2:47:54] we're going to find ourselves like a
[2:47:56] galatian
[2:47:57] being brought back again into bondage
[2:48:00] we're going to find ourselves in this
[2:48:02] message
[2:48:03] living a life that we feel like we
[2:48:05] prisoner
[2:48:07] like we feel like we're still under the
[2:48:09] law we are not free
[2:48:11] like we feel like we need to do things
[2:48:13] to be pleasing people
[2:48:15] and father missing the very mark of what
[2:48:18] you're trying to do
[2:48:19] the center of all attraction
[2:48:22] the center of all hope
[2:48:24] the center of salvation
[2:48:27] the center of everything is jesus christ
[2:48:30] this is our husband this is our god this
[2:48:33] is the one that we want to please this
[2:48:36] is the one that we care for and father
[2:48:39] if we don't love you how can we love the
[2:48:42] people that we can see lord
[2:48:44] and father your love means something
[2:48:46] different than we thought lord
[2:48:48] father your love
[2:48:50] for father took you to the cross and to
[2:48:53] the cross you stopped the law and the
[2:48:55] reason why you stopped the law because
[2:48:57] you saw what the law did to israel
[2:49:00] israel chose the law and the law put
[2:49:02] them in prison and the law was unable to
[2:49:06] purge the worshiper no matter how many
[2:49:08] times father lord jesus christ lamb were
[2:49:12] dying in the temple tons of blood has
[2:49:15] been spilled on the altar lord but still
[2:49:18] none of the old testament sent was able
[2:49:20] to see your presence all of them went
[2:49:23] into paradise and they were locked there
[2:49:25] and the devil even had the right lord to
[2:49:28] go down and to pull the scent like the
[2:49:30] witch of andor did just because the
[2:49:33] cross was not there but today because of
[2:49:36] the cross because of what you did on
[2:49:38] calvary because of the brazen altar made
[2:49:42] flesh father no devil have any right to
[2:49:46] enter the sixth dimension because
[2:49:48] nothing will enter the sixth dimension
[2:49:50] if it's not love and father if it's love
[2:49:53] that is the law in the sixth dimension
[2:49:56] if you yourself you are loved and the
[2:49:58] law of christ is love father this is the
[2:50:01] law that you want us to operate your
[2:50:04] word into it not a law of moses because
[2:50:07] the law of moses will corner the people
[2:50:10] it will make the black dog more stronger
[2:50:12] it will give more attention to the black
[2:50:14] dog it will continue to point sin until
[2:50:17] all that the people are thinking about
[2:50:20] is sin sin sin and they even forgetting
[2:50:23] the one that became sin for them that
[2:50:26] became the the
[2:50:28] the present serpent and father that died
[2:50:31] in their place and to take away their
[2:50:33] sin lord father may you bring people to
[2:50:36] the bed of focus to come back again to
[2:50:38] the cross and to look at that brazen
[2:50:40] serpent and to understand lord father
[2:50:43] that when we're talking about sin there
[2:50:46] is somebody that was hanged at the cross
[2:50:48] and there is a sacrifice that is sitting
[2:50:50] on the throne and that sacrifice is
[2:50:53] speaking better things than the blood of
[2:50:55] evil and that sacrifice is not a
[2:50:58] sacrifice of somebody that is chasing us
[2:51:01] with a whooping trying to whoop us it's
[2:51:04] not a sacrifice of a policeman chasing
[2:51:07] us to shoot at us but it's a sacrifice
[2:51:10] of somebody even if he's whooping his
[2:51:13] whoop is a whoop of love even if he's
[2:51:15] spanking
[2:51:17] is a spank of love everything that he's
[2:51:20] doing it is always for our good father
[2:51:23] may you bring that revelation to your
[2:51:25] children so that the burden of the law
[2:51:27] can be lifted up completely and the
[2:51:30] message burden can be light and easy and
[2:51:34] they can carry this yoke easily and
[2:51:36] their father enjoying the message lord
[2:51:39] father and leaving the message with all
[2:51:42] joy and purity not to please people but
[2:51:45] to please your father lord we thank you
[2:51:48] and commit everything unto the hand
[2:51:50] bless them for the sacrifice they always
[2:51:52] do to go an extra mile with me on sunday
[2:51:55] lord father we commit them and ask
[2:51:57] everything in the name of jesus christ
[2:52:00] amen god bless you church we love you

[2:52:15] within me
