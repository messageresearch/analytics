[14:24] oh precious
[14:26] jesus
[14:28] oh
[14:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[14:53] i know
[15:00] i started you know this
[15:02] situation
[15:04] in ukraine which you know we're keeping
[15:05] our brothers and sisters in prayer
[15:09] but and and it may be the beginning of
[15:11] the very end
[15:13] and i've been kind of thinking about it
[15:15] and you know people are forming
[15:17] alliances and allegiances
[15:20] you know
[15:22] so
[15:24] i thought maybe this morning we could
[15:26] sing
[15:27] i pledge allegiance to the lamb
[15:28] [Music]
[15:30] because everything outside of these four
[15:32] walls and everything outside of jesus
[15:34] christ is going to do what it's going to
[15:35] do
[15:36] and we have to stay in him and we have
[15:38] to
[15:39] so we can confess through this song this
[15:41] morning
[15:43] and you know some of these songs i mean
[15:47] we can't do it without him
[15:51] so let's sing to him this morning and
[15:54] re-re-pledge our allegiance
[15:57] to uh to the land this morning
[16:00] amen
[16:02] hallelujah it's a very good song
[16:04] y'all sing with me i don't do it the
[16:06] same justice that brother fred used to
[16:09] hallelujah
[16:13] and i will seek
[16:17] to honor
[16:20] his command
[16:23] i pledge allegiance
[16:28] to
[16:32] the land
[16:36] now i have heard how christians
[16:41] long ago
[16:45] were brought before
[16:49] [Music]
[16:54] they were told that he
[16:58] would
[16:59] spare
[17:00] their lives
[17:03] if they
[17:04] would renounce
[17:07] the
[17:08] name of christ
[17:12] but one by one
[17:15] they
[17:16] chose to die
[17:21] the son
[17:22] of god
[17:24] they would not
[17:26] deny
[17:29] like
[17:33] [Music]
[17:38] i can
[17:39] almost hear
[17:42] their
[17:44] voices ring
[17:46] i
[17:47] let
[17:48] her
[17:49] lead us
[17:52] to
[17:53] the land
[17:55] with all
[17:57] my strength
[18:02] [Music]
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:09] [Music]
[18:13] i is
[18:16] allegiance to
[18:21] the land
[18:24] [Music]
[18:26] now the years have come
[18:30] and the years have gone
[18:35] but the cause of jesus
[18:40] still goes on
[18:43] now our time has come
[18:48] hold to count the cause
[18:52] to reject this world
[18:56] to
[18:58] embrace the cross
[19:01] and one
[19:02] by one
[19:05] let us live our
[19:08] lives for the one who died
[19:14] to give us life
[19:18] till the
[19:19] trumpet sounds
[19:22] on that
[19:23] mighty day
[19:27] let us proudly stand
[19:31] and
[19:32] boldly say
[19:35] i
[19:36] pledge allegiance
[19:40] to
[19:42] the land
[19:44] with all my
[19:46] strength
[19:48] with all
[19:57] is
[20:06] [Music]
[20:19] bore
[20:20] my shame
[20:23] who took
[20:24] my place
[20:27] and he bore
[20:29] my pain
[20:31] i will seek
[20:33] to
[20:35] honor
[20:37] his command
[20:40] i
[20:41] pledge
[20:43] allegiance to
[20:52] [Music]
[20:54] let's sing it one more time

[21:24] [Music]
[21:40] i
[21:41] pledge
[21:44] [Music]
[21:46] to
[21:48] the land
[21:50] with all my strength
[21:54] with all my
[22:05] [Music]
[22:08] i
[22:09] pledge allegiance
[22:13] [Music]
[22:22] hallelujah let's give him a big
[22:29] [Applause]
[22:35] there's been some photographs
[22:37] where christians are hiding out in the
[22:40] subways over there
[22:41] and they're singing christian songs
[22:44] in ukraine
[22:45] i know we have many brothers and sisters
[22:47] over there one of our prayer requests is
[22:49] to remember them and russia
[22:52] because there's a lot of russians that
[22:53] are not going along with what's going on
[22:56] so we'll bring that up in just a minute
[22:58] last week
[22:59] we had two birthdays that we did not get
[23:02] to recognize no brother polycarp some
[23:05] sun came up but brother isaac also had a
[23:08] birthday last week
[23:10] and we
[23:12] got to witness that amen amen
[23:15] amen
[23:16] amen
[23:18] praise the lord
[23:21] he turned i think the big one five was
[23:23] it not 15 years
[23:26] now sister teresa also i learned last
[23:28] night at our fellowship
[23:30] see now this brother sam let it slip out
[23:32] last night
[23:33] he had a promise last week not to
[23:35] mention it not last night
[23:38] so
[23:38] [Laughter]
[23:40] she had a birthday last week as well
[23:42] amen
[23:44] hallelujah
[23:46] and if i'm correct i think sister
[23:48] jerusha had one recently and sister
[23:50] yocky beth has one
[23:52] now or something okay
[23:54] so i think they're
[23:56] elsewhere
[23:57] with those does anyone else have one
[23:59] this week or
[24:00] oh really
[24:03] okay edie
[24:06] friday you know what i'm thinking right
[24:08] okay
[24:09] okay
[24:11] brother seth was this today or what is
[24:13] it today
[24:15] oh that's right it's the 29th of
[24:18] february we don't have one of those this
[24:20] year
[24:24] my goodness
[24:26] so he's only probably about 12. you're
[24:29] probably about 12 years old aren't you
[24:34] amen
[24:37] i know the birthday is a mystery that's
[24:39] exactly right
[24:41] how we love brother seth and his wife
[24:44] amen
[24:45] because it's a joint birthday i'm sure
[24:48] it is in my house because when somebody
[24:50] has a birthday i get the cake too
[24:52] okay
[24:53] all right so i do have some prayer
[24:55] requests and i don't want to take away
[24:57] from those i mention
[24:59] our ukrainian brothers and sisters and
[25:01] our russian brothers and sisters and we
[25:03] could probably extend that to poland and
[25:04] belarus and just all around the region
[25:07] um there's quite a bit being said
[25:10] through the news media it isn't good
[25:13] so let's just remember these people
[25:16] and listen this
[25:17] this is a a joyous time
[25:20] on one hand
[25:22] because if it's the end we're good we're
[25:24] not how much time left
[25:26] these things like we had last night and
[25:28] today uh

[25:33] all right so i received let me read
[25:36] brother michael's prayer request first
[25:37] because the last two are kind of uh kind
[25:40] of the same spirit so

[25:50] with breathing problems and she asked
[25:53] me to request prayers for her that god
[25:55] may heal her
[25:57] so we want to remember
[25:59] a miss bessie amen

[59:23] unload the cargo
[59:25] okay
[59:26] we only have one service don't sleep i
[59:29] know you are
[59:34] verse 1
[59:35] who has believed our report
[59:38] and to whom
[59:40] is the arm of the lord revealed
[59:43] this is talking about jesus christ now
[59:46] for he shall grow up before him
[59:49] as a tender plant
[59:51] and as a root out of a joy ground
[59:54] he has no form
[59:57] no nor
[59:58] calmliness and when we shall see him
[1:00:02] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:00:06] him
[1:00:07] it's not something beautiful
[1:00:10] verse 3
[1:00:12] he is despised
[1:00:14] and rejected of man
[1:00:17] a man of sorrows
[1:00:19] you think you got trouble
[1:00:22] you got you
[1:00:24] you think you're going through trials in
[1:00:26] your life
[1:00:27] look at this man
[1:00:28] predestinated to be like this
[1:00:31] program to be like this
[1:00:33] he is despised and rejected of man
[1:00:37] a man of sorrow
[1:00:39] and acquainted with grief that is his
[1:00:42] deadly meat
[1:00:43] brother branham said when he was walking
[1:00:45] people were taking ripened fruit and
[1:00:47] then throwing him
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:53] and we hid as he wear our faces from him
[1:00:58] he was despised
[1:01:00] and we steam him not
[1:01:03] surely
[1:01:05] he has borne our griefs
[1:01:07] despite everything despite how we
[1:01:10] despised him and everything
[1:01:12] and carried our sorrow
[1:01:16] so your grief
[1:01:21] your sorrow
[1:01:25] what you were supposed to go through
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:31] yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:01:35] smitten of god
[1:01:36] and afflicted
[1:01:38] but
[1:01:40] in spite of all of this
[1:01:42] he was wounded for our
[1:01:45] your grief
[1:01:46] your sorrow your transgression
[1:01:50] not his transgression
[1:01:52] but yours
[1:01:54] your transgression
[1:01:57] he was bruised for our water
[1:02:00] so when you do something wrong
[1:02:03] that you already know it's wrong and
[1:02:06] you're still doing it
[1:02:07] it's going toward christ
[1:02:11] you're not hurting yourself you're
[1:02:13] hurting jesus christ that's why when
[1:02:15] brother branham had the vision
[1:02:18] of jesus christ every time brother
[1:02:20] branham was sinning
[1:02:23] his sin went and struck jesus christ and
[1:02:26] the blood came out of him
[1:02:29] hallelujah
[1:02:31] he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:02:38] how many iniquities one
[1:02:41] plural
[1:02:43] the chastisement
[1:02:45] of our peace your chastisement
[1:02:48] you should be the one whooped
[1:02:53] everybody
[1:02:55] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:02:59] him
[1:03:00] and with his straps
[1:03:03] not one
[1:03:05] whiplashes
[1:03:07] we are here
[1:03:09] so when they torture him it is a benefit
[1:03:11] for
[1:03:14] you verse 7 he was oppressed
[1:03:19] and he was afflicted
[1:03:21] yet
[1:03:22] he opened his mouth on facebook
[1:03:33] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:03:36] yet he opened not his mouth you remember
[1:03:39] yesterday
[1:03:40] when you're oppressed when you're angry
[1:03:46] the seventh seal silence
[1:03:48] everybody okay
[1:03:50] he opened up his mouth
[1:03:52] he's brought us a lamb
[1:03:55] to the slaughter
[1:03:57] and as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[1:04:02] so he opens not his mouth everybody okay
[1:04:07] job to verse 10
[1:04:09] don't sleep this morning i can see you
[1:04:13] verse 10
[1:04:14] yet he pleased the lord
[1:04:17] to bruise him
[1:04:20] how can he be a pleasure to bruise
[1:04:22] somebody
[1:04:25] he was put
[1:04:27] i'm sorry to bruise him he has put him
[1:04:30] to grief
[1:04:32] when you shall make his soul
[1:04:34] an offering for water
[1:04:38] not only iniquity
[1:04:40] but also
[1:04:42] sin
[1:04:43] if you look at that scene is it plural
[1:04:47] it's what
[1:04:48] and sin is what
[1:04:52] you see why it's singular because
[1:04:54] everything else is the attribute
[1:04:56] that is coming from it
[1:04:58] and back here so he have to go to the
[1:05:00] root and get the root then the whole
[1:05:02] trees is now amen
[1:05:05] when you shall make his soul an offering
[1:05:07] for sin
[1:05:09] he shall see his seed
[1:05:11] he shall prolong his days
[1:05:14] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[1:05:17] prosper in his hand
[1:05:19] you already got a picture here of an
[1:05:22] innocent man who's
[1:05:24] suffering because of somebody else let's
[1:05:27] go to luke chapter 18.
[1:05:30] our first reading
[1:05:32] we're talking about the brazen altar
[1:05:34] our second reading we're talking about
[1:05:36] somebody who's suffering judgment
[1:05:39] because of a guilty but that person
[1:05:42] who's not guilty he's just been
[1:05:45] going through the slaughter because of
[1:05:47] somebody else
[1:05:49] so there's
[1:05:50] he was streaking off god
[1:05:53] going to the slaughter
[1:05:56] everybody here
[1:05:58] let's go to luke chapter 18
[1:06:01] verse 9 then we pray
[1:06:05] if you dare you can say amen
[1:06:07] first man
[1:06:09] and he spoke this parable
[1:06:12] to certain
[1:06:15] some people
[1:06:16] which trusted in themselves
[1:06:20] how many people here trust in themselves
[1:06:24] you're the only one that knows
[1:06:25] everything
[1:06:26] you are right in everything that you do
[1:06:29] everybody does and understand you
[1:06:32] it's only you
[1:06:35] jesus is talking to you i know you're
[1:06:37] not going to raise your head
[1:06:40] and he spoke this parable to certain
[1:06:43] which trusted in themselves that they
[1:06:46] were righteous
[1:06:48] that's a big problem
[1:06:51] a very big problem
[1:06:53] looking at yourself like i'm right
[1:06:56] they are bad
[1:06:58] the denomination the denomination
[1:07:02] you can't even live their christian life
[1:07:04] and you're pointing to the denomination
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:09] and despise others
[1:07:13] i am not like so-and-so
[1:07:17] what are you talking about jesus verse
[1:07:19] 10
[1:07:20] two men
[1:07:22] went up into the temple to pray
[1:07:26] they were going into the temple
[1:07:31] to do what
[1:07:35] the temple
[1:07:36] and prayer
[1:07:38] we know the altar of essence
[1:07:41] okay
[1:07:44] the one a pharisee
[1:07:48] looking good on the outside
[1:07:50] long dresses and everything
[1:07:53] and the other republican you look at him
[1:07:57] a crook
[1:08:00] because he usually comes with iras
[1:08:04] i'm not talking about the irs people the
[1:08:06] irs in that time
[1:08:08] anybody okay because they were tax
[1:08:11] collector
[1:08:12] verse 11
[1:08:14] the pharisees stood
[1:08:16] and prayed
[1:08:18] thus with
[1:08:19] himself
[1:08:20] this is the prayer of a pharisee
[1:08:23] god
[1:08:24] i thank you
[1:08:26] that i am not as admins are
[1:08:30] what a prayer
[1:08:33] what a prayer
[1:08:36] extortioner so probably he was looking
[1:08:39] at the
[1:08:40] republican over there
[1:08:42] extortioner unjust
[1:08:45] i don't know if this republican
[1:08:48] went to his home to get taxes so he got
[1:08:51] upset on him so maybe he was in the
[1:08:54] church looking at him
[1:08:56] maybe praying loud so the republican can
[1:08:58] heal
[1:09:02] anybody here
[1:09:03] extortioner in the temple of god unjust
[1:09:08] adulterer or even as this water so he
[1:09:12] was looking at somebody else when he was
[1:09:15] praying
[1:09:16] making sure that person understand
[1:09:18] really well how he can speak english
[1:09:20] very well
[1:09:24] professional english
[1:09:26] everybody here
[1:09:28] i've fast twice in the week
[1:09:35] so when you sit down and you talking to
[1:09:38] these people they always have something
[1:09:40] to brag about themselves
[1:09:49] they usually do that in a humble way
[1:09:55] you know brother not to say anything but
[1:09:57] i was fasting last week
[1:10:03] really
[1:10:05] really you ain't fooling nobody
[1:10:07] everybody okay i fast twice in the week
[1:10:11] i give tithes
[1:10:14] no problem with church of all that are
[1:10:17] possessed
[1:10:19] what a prayer
[1:10:21] let's go to the public inside
[1:10:23] what are you telling god
[1:10:26] go ahead and tell him that the pharisees
[1:10:28] are devouring the houses of the widows
[1:10:31] tell him that the hypocrite you saw them
[1:10:33] in a movie theater tell god also because
[1:10:36] he's shooting at you go ahead and shoot
[1:10:37] back
[1:10:38] let's see what a pharisee does the
[1:10:40] republican does
[1:10:42] the certain and the publican
[1:10:44] standing a far off
[1:10:46] is not even close why is he standing
[1:10:49] afar off
[1:10:52] but the other one is approaching even
[1:10:56] examine yourself
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:00] there's publicans standing afar off you
[1:11:02] already know where he is in the
[1:11:04] tabernacle
[1:11:08] okay
[1:11:09] he already understood his position so he
[1:11:12] doesn't want to play a game with god
[1:11:16] anybody here
[1:11:19] would not lift up so much
[1:11:23] as his eyes to heaven
[1:11:26] so he's conscious of something
[1:11:28] this one
[1:11:30] is not conscious of something
[1:11:32] it takes the word of god to zero him
[1:11:35] then to open what he's doing
[1:11:38] because he's fooling somebody
[1:11:40] he's an actor but branham said the word
[1:11:42] pharisee means an actor
[1:11:44] somebody who played church
[1:11:46] anybody care
[1:11:48] but
[1:11:49] smut upon his breast
[1:11:51] so we saw just a man like this yes
[1:11:56] saying
[1:11:57] god
[1:11:59] be water
[1:12:01] merciful to me a water
[1:12:05] so one person
[1:12:07] the pharisee
[1:12:09] in the temple in the presence of god
[1:12:13] he sees that he is righteous
[1:12:18] and the scripture described to us that
[1:12:21] this righteousness
[1:12:23] is not the righteousness that god told
[1:12:26] him
[1:12:28] but it's the righteousness that he
[1:12:31] viewed himself
[1:12:33] according to his own perception that
[1:12:36] he's righteous it's a self-made
[1:12:38] righteousness
[1:12:40] but the publican
[1:12:42] on the other side when you take him to
[1:12:45] the temple he's afraid
[1:12:47] and when he get in the temple he doesn't
[1:12:50] want to even look on the outside
[1:12:53] if he didn't want to look at the heaven
[1:12:56] where were they ate
[1:13:01] somebody got it where the only place you
[1:13:05] can see the heaven in the temple is
[1:13:08] where
[1:13:10] did i lose somebody
[1:13:12] so both of these are in the outer court
[1:13:20] in the time of prayer
[1:13:23] everybody okay
[1:13:25] when this one say lord have mercy on me
[1:13:29] because i'm what
[1:13:31] in the presence of god
[1:13:33] all that comes to him
[1:13:35] i'm a sinner
[1:13:38] he doesn't see anything that he can
[1:13:40] prove to god
[1:13:42] that he's righteous
[1:13:44] when he looked at himself
[1:13:46] he said there's nothing about me
[1:13:49] all i'm going to tell you i am a sinner
[1:13:51] in other words if you need to kill me go
[1:13:53] ahead and kill me
[1:13:55] but the other one is looking he say i am
[1:13:58] righteous remember i fast twice a week
[1:14:00] remember i'm not like this one i am not
[1:14:03] an extortionist i'm not like this one
[1:14:05] he's pulling something to god
[1:14:07] both of them in the same spot
[1:14:12] everybody okay
[1:14:15] let's go to verse 14. i tell you
[1:14:17] this man
[1:14:19] went down to his house how
[1:14:22] ah
[1:14:25] you got it
[1:14:28] so where is justification
[1:14:33] is he complicated did brother brother
[1:14:35] never give you the scripture
[1:14:37] once again the message
[1:14:39] is always perfect with their bible
[1:14:45] always remember that even if you don't
[1:14:47] see it yet
[1:14:50] remember remember that
[1:14:52] when brother branham says something
[1:14:54] always perfect
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:58] not the man william marion branham but
[1:15:02] the ministry of god
[1:15:04] in william branham
[1:15:06] always perfect
[1:15:11] so the other quote
[1:15:14] produce justification
[1:15:21] oh glory to god
[1:15:22] i get so excited it's already in
[1:15:26] and i tell you
[1:15:28] he's already prepared blessed please
[1:15:30] again
[1:15:31] i tell you this man there should be a
[1:15:34] way we can pull that up probably okay
[1:15:36] thank you and i tell you this man went
[1:15:38] down to his house
[1:15:40] justified
[1:15:42] rather than the other
[1:15:45] for everyone that exhaust himself
[1:15:49] shall be
[1:15:51] beast and he that does what
[1:15:54] so when you get in the other court you
[1:15:56] must be humble
[1:16:03] you must be very humble
[1:16:05] in the other court everybody okay
[1:16:08] shall be humble
[1:16:10] and he that humbles himself shall be
[1:16:12] what
[1:16:14] now my question
[1:16:16] this man
[1:16:17] was praying
[1:16:19] when he was praying
[1:16:21] he recognized himself as a sinner
[1:16:24] and jesus said he humbled himself
[1:16:26] versus the other one that exalted
[1:16:29] himself
[1:16:30] by his own righteousness and then when
[1:16:33] he went home
[1:16:34] he went justified
[1:16:36] what was in the other court that
[1:16:39] justified him
[1:16:44] what is in the other court
[1:16:46] that make you justify that when you
[1:16:49] leave
[1:16:50] the other court he was not in the holy
[1:16:53] place
[1:16:53] because only the priest entered it
[1:16:56] he was not in the holiest because only
[1:16:59] the high priest entered there but in the
[1:17:02] other court that man can go back home
[1:17:08] like he never done anything
[1:17:11] since he was born
[1:17:14] what is in the other code
[1:17:17] that gives him the power
[1:17:22] turn to isaiah 6 and let's pray
[1:17:26] oh
[1:17:27] my god
[1:17:29] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:34] stay put
[1:17:36] don't sleep
[1:17:40] because
[1:17:41] you might miss something
[1:17:43] especially those that have a tendency to
[1:17:46] listen one time and they got everything
[1:17:48] off
[1:17:49] they go home i already listened to it i
[1:17:51] got everything i remember everything ask
[1:17:54] him question after two weeks
[1:18:02] make sure this is not something you take
[1:18:05] and you forgot you take and you forgot
[1:18:07] this is something that is building you
[1:18:08] up the more you eating you're growing
[1:18:11] you're growing you're growing you're
[1:18:12] growing until one of this day
[1:18:15] it's gonna be between you and god
[1:18:17] let's pray heavenly father
[1:18:19] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[1:18:21] father this morning
[1:18:23] thanking you for your grace for your

[1:19:38] amen
[1:19:40] everybody ready
[1:19:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:44] my subject this morning
[1:19:48] is the mystery
[1:19:50] of the brazen altar
[1:19:54] brother stephen are you starting another
[1:19:58] series because we are in a roof
[1:20:03] no i am not starting another series
[1:20:07] everybody okay
[1:20:08] normally the sermon should be the four
[1:20:11] phases of roof
[1:20:13] the brazen altar
[1:20:15] everybody okay
[1:20:16] but in
[1:20:18] to make your reference easy because two
[1:20:20] months or three months down the road
[1:20:22] somebody will come and say when did he
[1:20:24] preach about the brazen altar so you can
[1:20:26] go straight ahead and pull it and see it
[1:20:29] clearly because we already talked about
[1:20:30] the lever so we want to make sure
[1:20:32] everything is clear and easy for you to
[1:20:34] access so the mystery of the brazen
[1:20:37] altar you can pick that one or the four
[1:20:40] faces of roof or roof at the brazen
[1:20:44] altar everybody okay
[1:20:46] now when we talked about a roof
[1:20:50] i reminded you on wednesday
[1:20:52] that
[1:20:53] roof
[1:20:54] we want to blend the roof with the
[1:20:56] tabernacle everybody okay
[1:20:58] and the tabernacle have three places you
[1:21:01] should be now very very familiar with
[1:21:04] this
[1:21:05] we have the other court
[1:21:07] we have the holy place
[1:21:11] and we have
[1:21:12] the holiest or the most holy everybody
[1:21:15] okay
[1:21:17] then we found out that the stages of
[1:21:19] roof because we started with the
[1:21:21] tabernacle and we wanted to blend roof
[1:21:24] with the tabernacle
[1:21:26] and we found out that rufus first was
[1:21:29] at his mother's home
[1:21:34] and over there they were all under a
[1:21:36] dollar tree
[1:21:38] everybody here then roof moved from his
[1:21:41] mother home
[1:21:42] all the way to the house of elimelech
[1:21:46] everybody
[1:21:48] from the tribe of judah
[1:21:50] by marriage
[1:21:52] anybody care
[1:21:54] anybody okay
[1:21:55] so by getting into the house of judah
[1:21:58] judah which is the door
[1:22:00] roof was already get access into the
[1:22:03] camp of israel
[1:22:06] everybody okay
[1:22:07] but yet
[1:22:08] she is not in the tabernacle yet anybody
[1:22:12] okay then we found out that at the death
[1:22:15] of the husband of roof
[1:22:17] ruth moved from there all the way to the
[1:22:20] road towards uh toward judah
[1:22:25] the road or the way back
[1:22:28] and in this road that's where you take
[1:22:31] this you make decision
[1:22:33] everybody okay
[1:22:34] blessed be the name of the lord so to
[1:22:37] move from the camp
[1:22:39] from the marriage or from the door that
[1:22:42] you enter in in the message
[1:22:44] maybe you enter because of marriage
[1:22:47] maybe you enter because of a
[1:22:48] relationship maybe you enter following
[1:22:51] your friend or maybe you were just born
[1:22:54] in a message and that is your religion
[1:22:57] to move from there
[1:22:59] the husband of roof
[1:23:02] must die
[1:23:06] who knows the name of the husband of
[1:23:08] roof
[1:23:10] somebody did the homework
[1:23:14] from moab to bethlehem this journey was
[1:23:18] initiated by the death of marlon in ruth
[1:23:22] chapter 4 verse 10
[1:23:24] the bible says moreover roof the more
[1:23:26] bodies the wife of who
[1:23:29] marlon everybody clear now so don't say
[1:23:31] brother stephen saying now we remember
[1:23:34] that when we talk about the names
[1:23:36] brother branham said naomi means
[1:23:38] pleasant
[1:23:40] elimelech
[1:23:42] was her husband means worship
[1:23:44] and when you take naomi and elimelech he
[1:23:47] give you a pleasant worship that was the
[1:23:49] family
[1:23:50] but
[1:23:51] malone brother branham say that one
[1:23:54] means sickness
[1:23:57] and kalyan or kilion means weary gloomy
[1:24:01] and sadness but the husband of ruth was
[1:24:04] marlon meaning that roof was married to
[1:24:08] sickness
[1:24:13] any problem
[1:24:15] did i lose any anything
[1:24:17] and we know that roof is a type of the
[1:24:20] gentile brand
[1:24:22] you already know that right or the
[1:24:24] gentile church
[1:24:26] everybody okay
[1:24:28] where are you going brother branham says
[1:24:30] this that
[1:24:32] i want to say this before i start
[1:24:34] preaching
[1:24:36] the greatest need of healing tonight
[1:24:39] and the sickest body
[1:24:42] that are north
[1:24:45] in all of the world
[1:24:47] is the body of the lord
[1:24:50] duh
[1:24:52] everybody okay so far and ruth was
[1:24:54] married born with sickness
[1:24:58] oh it is horribly sick
[1:25:01] it is broke up
[1:25:04] and scattered he needs a healing
[1:25:07] may god send the holy spirit
[1:25:10] in such a power till the whole body of
[1:25:14] class will be brought together
[1:25:16] bound with love and unity
[1:25:19] until then
[1:25:21] you will see
[1:25:22] things happen that you never thought of
[1:25:24] before jesus will come and it will be
[1:25:28] over everybody okay
[1:25:30] brother branham said that there is more
[1:25:32] to the ministry than divine healing
[1:25:36] that was the first poll
[1:25:37] the sickest body i know of
[1:25:41] tonight is the so-called body of jesus
[1:25:44] christ that's ruth married to sickness
[1:25:48] he needs spiritual healing
[1:25:52] everybody okay
[1:25:53] not natural healing there is only one
[1:25:56] bomb or one medication
[1:25:59] that i know of die will heal and that is
[1:26:03] the
[1:26:04] so according to brother branham the only
[1:26:06] thing that can heal roof
[1:26:10] have to be the word
[1:26:11] everybody okay
[1:26:13] and that is the sick body that we want
[1:26:16] to stand up
[1:26:17] in the strength and the vitamin power of
[1:26:20] the gospel and that is why i use much of
[1:26:24] the time
[1:26:25] now in trying to strengthen the church
[1:26:28] by the water
[1:26:30] so ruth was married to marion married to
[1:26:34] sickness
[1:26:35] and in order for roof to go to the
[1:26:37] second marriage of boaz according to
[1:26:40] romans chapter 7 verse 1 all the way to
[1:26:43] 3 your first husband must die
[1:26:47] everybody care because if your first
[1:26:50] husband is not dead
[1:26:52] and you be
[1:26:53] married to another husband you
[1:26:55] completely committed adultery in other
[1:26:58] words the first thing
[1:27:00] that brought you into the message
[1:27:03] must die
[1:27:08] let me start it again
[1:27:10] if you holding onto this message
[1:27:14] based on the fact that you were born
[1:27:17] from the parent that believed the
[1:27:20] message
[1:27:21] dark cold need to die
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:24] that foundation needs to be destroyed
[1:27:28] if you are in this message because you
[1:27:31] follow a husband
[1:27:33] or because you follow a woman
[1:27:35] or because you follow a friend or you
[1:27:38] follow the movement of the peers
[1:27:41] the relationship that foundation must
[1:27:44] die
[1:27:47] in other words if this is what you're
[1:27:50] hanging on to
[1:27:51] in the message you are not in the
[1:27:53] message yet
[1:27:55] you are just in the camp of the message
[1:27:58] you don't drink you don't smoke you
[1:28:01] don't commit adultery you don't go to
[1:28:04] the nightclub you're just in the camp
[1:28:06] but you are not in the tabernacle yet
[1:28:10] everybody okay so far
[1:28:12] all right and we found out that when the
[1:28:15] husband died
[1:28:16] both of these women
[1:28:18] ruth and oprah went on the road
[1:28:22] to the going back on onto the land of
[1:28:25] judah and on that road they must take a
[1:28:28] decision
[1:28:29] but branham says this
[1:28:31] brother branham says that we have four
[1:28:34] different phases of roof
[1:28:36] we have roof deciding
[1:28:39] we have roof making a decision
[1:28:42] roof serving
[1:28:43] roof resting and roof rewarded so number
[1:28:47] one
[1:28:48] we are in the roof deciding
[1:28:51] number two she have to serve
[1:28:54] number three
[1:28:55] she have to rest
[1:28:57] and number four roof have to be rewarded
[1:29:01] of her work
[1:29:02] brother branham said roof making the
[1:29:04] decision
[1:29:06] roof after she made her decision then
[1:29:08] roof is serving then roof is resting
[1:29:11] then roof is rewarded and we found out
[1:29:14] that decisions are very important
[1:29:20] because brother branham preached
[1:29:22] the power of decision
[1:29:28] everybody okay
[1:29:29] then brother branham preached
[1:29:31] the time of decision
[1:29:36] and then brother branham preach
[1:29:39] the results
[1:29:41] of decision
[1:29:43] it is free
[1:29:45] you can listen to it
[1:29:46] so decision have power
[1:29:51] everybody okay
[1:29:52] and there is a time whether you like it
[1:29:55] or not you must take a decision because
[1:29:59] god will rock your boat
[1:30:03] everybody okay
[1:30:05] and the decision you will take
[1:30:08] will have some result in your life
[1:30:11] either it's gonna be a positive result
[1:30:15] or it's gonna be a negative report
[1:30:19] that's why brother branham said whatever
[1:30:21] you're living today is a result of the
[1:30:24] decision you took five years ago
[1:30:29] what kind of life are you living today
[1:30:32] work on of decision are you making every
[1:30:34] day
[1:30:35] it is shaping your life
[1:30:42] hallelujah
[1:30:43] brother branham said there is four
[1:30:45] stations or phases
[1:30:47] or junction in roof and boas
[1:30:50] he said first she had to decide
[1:30:53] whether she was going to
[1:30:56] she was going to go into this land or
[1:30:58] not with naomi she had to make a
[1:31:01] decision
[1:31:02] then after she got there the next thing
[1:31:05] she had to do was to serve in the field
[1:31:08] of boaz
[1:31:10] not any kind of field
[1:31:12] out there barefooted
[1:31:15] gleaming behind the reapers
[1:31:17] serving so he was not yet done by just
[1:31:20] taking a decision the next step was on
[1:31:23] everybody
[1:31:24] and then after she had found grace in
[1:31:27] boar's side
[1:31:28] by doing the work
[1:31:30] she have to do certain things to gain
[1:31:34] the favor of boaz
[1:31:36] you are serving
[1:31:38] ever here then she had to wait
[1:31:41] because she already got degradation till
[1:31:44] bowers done the king's men redemption
[1:31:48] redeemership
[1:31:49] to take back all naomi lost in order to
[1:31:52] bring in roof the moabite and the next
[1:31:55] stage is roof
[1:31:56] water everybody cares so far so we were
[1:32:00] dealing with decision and like we said
[1:32:02] decision is very important and we also
[1:32:06] told you that decision cannot be made by
[1:32:09] emotion
[1:32:12] remember even on wednesday brother bruce
[1:32:15] emphasized on that one everybody here
[1:32:18] brother branham say you say oh brother
[1:32:21] branham i have tried that lots of time
[1:32:25] but wait
[1:32:26] you never fully made up your mind
[1:32:31] you might just be under and lead the
[1:32:34] emotion of some sort
[1:32:36] but if you really make up your mind
[1:32:39] and make a decision
[1:32:41] christ is going to receive you
[1:32:47] hallelujah
[1:32:48] let me continue because what emotion can
[1:32:52] be destroyed by reasoning
[1:32:56] all it takes is somebody to give you
[1:32:59] some crazy website
[1:33:02] or youtube links and you are off
[1:33:05] everybody here
[1:33:07] brother branham said as i have said a
[1:33:09] while ago lord
[1:33:11] maybe you have put a stumbling block
[1:33:14] in somebody's way
[1:33:16] about these altar calls
[1:33:19] brother branham was not against altar
[1:33:22] call
[1:33:23] anybody here but brother branham was
[1:33:26] really rigid about altercall
[1:33:29] what was going on in the article that
[1:33:32] brother branham didn't like
[1:33:36] everybody here
[1:33:37] brother branham said until they were
[1:33:40] begging
[1:33:42] and persuading people to go up
[1:33:46] you don't beg people in churches
[1:33:52] do you hear me
[1:33:53] if somebody one of god let them go
[1:34:00] you don't persuade people to come in the
[1:34:03] message
[1:34:05] because one of these days they're going
[1:34:07] to leave you
[1:34:11] brother branham say and when we return
[1:34:14] back next year we found them a two-fold
[1:34:18] more child of hell
[1:34:20] than there was to start with
[1:34:23] how can you come in the altar and you
[1:34:26] supposedly giving your life to jesus
[1:34:28] christ then five years later they found
[1:34:31] you in the nightclub
[1:34:35] everybody okay
[1:34:37] how
[1:34:38] can they come except you convince them
[1:34:42] and convict them the great holy spirit
[1:34:47] everybody so far
[1:34:49] brother branham continues he said i
[1:34:51] noticed the other night
[1:34:53] in that great famous meeting of one of
[1:34:56] our great renowned brothers in
[1:34:58] california
[1:34:59] and i noticed in
[1:35:01] that meeting as those people come down
[1:35:05] young water
[1:35:09] you thought they coming at the altar the
[1:35:11] lord touched them we see this all over
[1:35:14] the convention
[1:35:16] somebody will preach before you see
[1:35:18] young people a long line all of them
[1:35:20] coming at the altar you say praise the
[1:35:22] lord this is over
[1:35:24] next year they're in the altar next year
[1:35:26] they're in the altar
[1:35:28] but the publican
[1:35:30] was in the altar one time
[1:35:34] and when he left that was it
[1:35:37] what is going on
[1:35:39] brother branham saying i notice young
[1:35:41] teenager children
[1:35:43] i admire their brother for his great
[1:35:46] stand anybody would it's a wonderful
[1:35:48] sermon
[1:35:49] if you position see what takes uh what
[1:35:53] place he's taken in the last day you
[1:35:55] will too but what is wrong brother
[1:35:57] branham and as i notice those people
[1:36:00] coming down to the altar
[1:36:02] to make a water
[1:36:04] so that all there is a place for
[1:36:06] decision
[1:36:07] girls chewing chewing gum
[1:36:13] boys punching one another
[1:36:17] so when they say come to the earth you
[1:36:19] see young people going on
[1:36:23] you better go back
[1:36:25] and go sit
[1:36:26] brother say in other words they're
[1:36:29] coming at the altar joking
[1:36:34] they're coming at the altar without
[1:36:37] respect
[1:36:39] chewing gums
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:43] why is that
[1:36:45] how can you preach
[1:36:47] and a young person or an adult is coming
[1:36:50] to the altar playing games it is because
[1:36:53] they never understood the mystery of
[1:36:56] that altar
[1:36:59] anybody okay brother branham say people
[1:37:02] laughing
[1:37:04] joke
[1:37:05] lack of respect
[1:37:07] and laughing
[1:37:09] sometimes you are preaching you see
[1:37:10] young people laughing
[1:37:14] hallelujah
[1:37:15] that is not the way to come godly water
[1:37:19] in other words brother branham is saying
[1:37:22] that when you are approaching the altar
[1:37:26] the altar is not a place that makes you
[1:37:30] laugh
[1:37:34] the altar is a dangerous place
[1:37:38] it is a place of sorrow
[1:37:44] i have to teach this
[1:37:46] so if you did your conversion wrong
[1:37:49] you need to go back and correct
[1:37:51] everything
[1:37:52] everybody okay
[1:37:54] you must come under conviction
[1:37:59] not the preacher persuading you or
[1:38:01] pulling you or telling you about your
[1:38:03] mother who died your father who died
[1:38:06] your uncle who died your neighbor that
[1:38:07] was a good person that's not the ground
[1:38:10] everybody here god send us an
[1:38:13] old-fashioned pentecostal holy ghost
[1:38:15] revival that shall bring sin to the root
[1:38:19] and bring conviction to men
[1:38:22] and women
[1:38:24] so the minister must preach plan
[1:38:31] call sin by its name
[1:38:34] regardless if the person is a friend to
[1:38:37] the pastor
[1:38:38] or not
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:42] hallelujah brother branham continue and
[1:38:45] the people are not even accepting it
[1:38:48] sincerely
[1:38:51] they are joking
[1:38:53] they are laughing
[1:38:54] lack of respect
[1:38:56] and no sincerity
[1:38:59] coming to the altar
[1:39:01] why should we approach the altar with
[1:39:04] sincerity why do we need to approach the
[1:39:07] altar not laughing why do we have to
[1:39:09] come in the altar crying why
[1:39:13] the other night in los angeles at the
[1:39:15] great rally seen a hundred times 100
[1:39:19] come up to make decisions at the altar
[1:39:23] young people again coming up
[1:39:25] teenagers punching one another and
[1:39:28] chewing chewing gum and pulling one
[1:39:31] another's hair
[1:39:34] your hair looks good
[1:39:35] going to the altar
[1:39:38] acting coming up to make a decision no
[1:39:41] wonder it is a babylon
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:46] no wonder it is a sodom
[1:39:49] the whole thing is ready to be born
[1:39:53] when you come to the altar laughing
[1:39:56] joking
[1:39:57] punching one another without sincerity
[1:40:00] you got your result will be a confusion
[1:40:04] babylon
[1:40:05] or you're gonna find yourself in unclean
[1:40:07] living
[1:40:08] in sodom
[1:40:10] you find yourself in confusion you find
[1:40:14] yourself in unclean living
[1:40:16] go back again
[1:40:17] check how did you go to the altar
[1:40:22] brother branham say how you going to
[1:40:24] backslide
[1:40:26] you might backslide but you can be lost
[1:40:29] and if you stay in that state
[1:40:32] you show that you didn't have it in the
[1:40:34] beginning
[1:40:37] but if you are a child of god the
[1:40:39] worshiper once purge has no more
[1:40:41] conscience of sin say hebrew that is
[1:40:44] true so you can be a christian you can
[1:40:47] have the holy ghost and run out and live
[1:40:49] in the world
[1:40:54] how many people have the holy ghost in
[1:40:55] the message
[1:41:00] how many people
[1:41:01] the holy ghost making you do stuff that
[1:41:03] you do
[1:41:05] everybody
[1:41:06] that holy ghost doesn't stop you when
[1:41:08] you're paying the hotel bill
[1:41:11] that holy ghost doesn't stop you from
[1:41:13] not taking your pants off
[1:41:19] you don't have it
[1:41:22] if you love the world
[1:41:24] the things of the world the love of god
[1:41:26] is not even in you
[1:41:28] so you are just listening to a false
[1:41:31] sound
[1:41:32] somewhere the devil got you all what
[1:41:36] like the pharisee
[1:41:40] anybody care
[1:41:41] but if you examine your life by the word
[1:41:44] of god and it shows you are living right
[1:41:48] down that bible page then you get water
[1:41:52] take the word of god examine yourself
[1:41:54] how you living
[1:41:56] then you're gonna tell whether you have
[1:41:58] it or not
[1:41:59] brother branham continued to give us
[1:42:01] more light
[1:42:02] brother branham says
[1:42:04] tapping it up with roof
[1:42:06] roof deciding
[1:42:09] roof serving
[1:42:11] roof resting
[1:42:12] brother branham said deciding was
[1:42:15] justification
[1:42:18] because we found out that the other
[1:42:20] court was justification
[1:42:22] the holy place was sanctification
[1:42:25] and the holiest was the baptism of the
[1:42:28] holy ghost now brother branham is saying
[1:42:30] that roof
[1:42:31] when she left the house of elimelech and
[1:42:34] when she was on the road to judah and
[1:42:37] she had to make a decision brother
[1:42:39] branham said that was the stage of
[1:42:42] justification in other words roof was
[1:42:45] already into the tabernacle
[1:42:50] in the other court anybody okay
[1:42:53] he said serving
[1:42:55] making herself ready sanctification
[1:42:58] resting was with the holy spirit until
[1:43:01] the wedding supper comes so roof
[1:43:04] deciding is your justification
[1:43:07] anybody okay
[1:43:08] roof serving is your sanctification
[1:43:12] roof resting is the baptism of the holy
[1:43:15] spirit
[1:43:17] and roof rewarded is going into the
[1:43:20] rapture the coming of the lord
[1:43:24] but the bottom say the church come
[1:43:27] through john wesley justification i mean
[1:43:30] luther justification through john
[1:43:32] wesley's sanctification through the
[1:43:34] pentecostal the baptism of the holy
[1:43:36] ghost and now resting waiting everybody
[1:43:40] care
[1:43:41] for the what the coming of the lord
[1:43:44] which is your reward
[1:43:46] everybody here so now we got roof
[1:43:50] deciding and deciding is justification
[1:43:54] and justification happened in the world
[1:43:57] to other court just like we saw the
[1:43:59] publican and the pharisee justification
[1:44:02] happened where and the other code so
[1:44:05] roof now is at the other court
[1:44:08] now let's get roof inside the tabernacle
[1:44:13] when you look at the tabernacle and you
[1:44:16] enter the tabernacle there is two things
[1:44:19] that are there
[1:44:21] in the other court
[1:44:23] the other court have only two furniture
[1:44:26] the first is the present altar
[1:44:29] and the second one is the lever and we
[1:44:31] already talked to you about the level so
[1:44:34] when you enter from the east
[1:44:36] the first things that roof sees is the
[1:44:39] altar
[1:44:40] that's where roof was deciding so the
[1:44:43] road
[1:44:44] back to judah was already roof at the
[1:44:48] altar right there
[1:44:53] so when roof left the house of elimelech
[1:44:56] the place they were living with naomi
[1:44:59] and step on the road going back to judah
[1:45:02] she was not in judah yet but she was on
[1:45:05] the road to judah that spot there was an
[1:45:09] alter right there
[1:45:10] because ruth would have to make a
[1:45:12] decision and orpah must make a decision
[1:45:16] everybody okay so far did we lose
[1:45:18] somebody everybody care praise be the
[1:45:21] name of the lord so when you enter you
[1:45:23] got an altar here
[1:45:25] and after the altar we got to order into
[1:45:28] a eleven and we told you that in the
[1:45:31] altar this is where you repented
[1:45:35] then you are water
[1:45:39] baptized that's why peter enacts
[1:45:43] 2 38
[1:45:45] peter said repent
[1:45:48] everybody okay
[1:45:50] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:45:52] christ for the remission of sin
[1:45:55] you don't receive the holy ghost here
[1:45:57] then
[1:45:58] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:46:01] ghost
[1:46:04] the tabernacle in attitude 338.
[1:46:10] can i start it again
[1:46:11] repent
[1:46:13] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:46:16] and you shall
[1:46:17] it's in the future you shall it is
[1:46:20] coming up in the future in other words
[1:46:22] you have more step
[1:46:24] to move on until you receive the holy
[1:46:27] ghost
[1:46:29] so what happened at the altar is not
[1:46:32] done yet
[1:46:33] you still have to move forward
[1:46:37] you stop at the altar and you thought
[1:46:40] you got the holy ghost that's why you
[1:46:42] are struggling the way you struggle
[1:46:46] everybody okay
[1:46:47] so we found out that we already talked
[1:46:50] about the level but what is wrong with
[1:46:52] the altar because we need to understand
[1:46:55] what is in the altar because if you
[1:46:58] don't understand the altar you will keep
[1:47:00] laughing in church you will keep joking
[1:47:03] in church you will keep coming here and
[1:47:05] respectfully and with that sincerity
[1:47:09] playing in the instrument
[1:47:11] singing right here and living like a
[1:47:14] devil
[1:47:18] i am gonna tighten up
[1:47:21] to the point where if we don't even have
[1:47:24] a song special that would be good
[1:47:28] and
[1:47:29] as long as your life is getting clean
[1:47:33] and back here you cannot live wrong and
[1:47:36] come here to sing
[1:47:38] you cannot live wrong and come here to
[1:47:40] play instrument you cannot live wrong
[1:47:43] and come here to back up the instrument
[1:47:46] if your life is not where it's supposed
[1:47:48] to be i will respect you more if you
[1:47:52] stay sitting there
[1:47:57] hallelujah
[1:47:59] everybody okay do you still love me
[1:48:03] either way jesus loves me
[1:48:07] hallelujah so when we look at this altar
[1:48:11] what is going on in this altar
[1:48:13] brother branham say as usual when one
[1:48:17] regard a verse superficially
[1:48:20] he comes up with a superficial
[1:48:23] understanding and when the people don't
[1:48:26] understand the power of this altar
[1:48:29] that's why they play games
[1:48:31] in the church
[1:48:32] the mystery of the brazen altar
[1:48:35] everybody okay
[1:48:36] what is going on with this altar let's
[1:48:39] go to isaiah chapter six
[1:48:43] let me
[1:48:44] unload this cargo
[1:48:50] somebody told me that i can move this
[1:48:54] praise god
[1:49:02] everybody okay
[1:49:03] praise god
[1:49:05] i won't tell you his name before you
[1:49:07] jump on him you would have one taught
[1:49:08] him
[1:49:09] let's go to uh isaiah 6
[1:49:13] you there you can say amen
[1:49:16] in the years
[1:49:18] that king uzziah died
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:23] elimelech died
[1:49:27] marlon died
[1:49:30] kingdom died
[1:49:32] isaiah if you go to the message
[1:49:35] influence was so connected to this king
[1:49:39] this king was the mentor of isaiah
[1:49:43] you follow me in other words the
[1:49:45] relationship between god
[1:49:48] and isaiah was based upon this king
[1:49:55] everybody okay and god slew the king
[1:50:02] because the preacher got more power in
[1:50:06] the heart than god
[1:50:09] brother branham said when a man leaves
[1:50:11] the world leave him
[1:50:15] and the reason why people cannot live is
[1:50:18] in their heart they got more connected
[1:50:21] with the pastor
[1:50:23] versus with the great shepherd
[1:50:31] brother branham say if you need the
[1:50:33] quote that
[1:50:35] god allows some time pastor to make
[1:50:38] mistake
[1:50:39] so he can shake your faith away from the
[1:50:42] person
[1:50:44] may god protect me under his blood
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] do you follow me
[1:50:50] amen that king usaid look as a great man
[1:50:55] how can you leave the message and me get
[1:50:59] in trouble because of you
[1:51:04] you leave the church
[1:51:07] and me stop praying because you left the
[1:51:09] church
[1:51:10] you might as well leave the church
[1:51:13] my relationship with god is not based on
[1:51:17] you
[1:51:19] whether you like me or not that's not my
[1:51:22] problem
[1:51:24] whether you stay or go that's not my
[1:51:27] problem
[1:51:28] but you see people if their relationship
[1:51:31] if he's a friend to brother charles
[1:51:34] hamilton
[1:51:35] if he gets a problem with brother
[1:51:37] charles hamilton he leaves the church
[1:51:41] so brother chose hamilton is the church
[1:51:48] so you are staying in this church
[1:51:50] because of brother charles hamilton you
[1:51:52] might as well live
[1:51:57] how can i destroy my own life
[1:52:01] because of brother charles hamilton
[1:52:03] brother charles hamilton doing his own
[1:52:05] things and me stopping from going to
[1:52:08] church because of him
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:12] why you don't come to church they gossip
[1:52:15] about me
[1:52:16] the gossipers still come to church
[1:52:18] you injuring yourself
[1:52:24] while you stop going to church i was so
[1:52:26] disappointed with what happened
[1:52:29] the man that disappoints you is living
[1:52:31] his life
[1:52:35] and you are destroying your own
[1:52:37] spirituality for somebody who doesn't
[1:52:40] care about what you're doing
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] so in the years this king i said i was a
[1:52:49] big fan to him
[1:52:50] a big body everything he looks at this
[1:52:53] king everything he looks at this king
[1:52:55] this king does this isaiah copy i say a
[1:52:57] copy i say a copy god saying no problem
[1:52:59] that's his first husband
[1:53:05] god slew the first husband
[1:53:07] isaiah lost the gps
[1:53:10] he went quickly in the temple
[1:53:11] disappointed
[1:53:12] i didn't think these things will happen
[1:53:14] to us it is so bad god said that's why i
[1:53:18] want you
[1:53:19] ever here and thank you when isaiah was
[1:53:23] a friend to king uzziah
[1:53:26] isaiah saw himself as a good man
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:32] the relationship
[1:53:34] of isaiah
[1:53:36] and king uzziah
[1:53:39] gave isaiah a self-confidence
[1:53:44] that everything in his life was good
[1:53:49] because he's a friend to the king
[1:53:51] because he's there with the king because
[1:53:54] he has a first place with the king
[1:53:56] so therefore my life is good
[1:54:01] if he needs money he just called the
[1:54:03] king or text him and the king said go to
[1:54:06] the treasure go get money that's my body
[1:54:09] no problem everything in life going good
[1:54:12] a beautiful church a beautiful people
[1:54:15] beautiful family everything beautiful so
[1:54:19] my life is good i don't need anything
[1:54:21] i'm waiting for the coming of the lord
[1:54:23] god said no problem i know what to do
[1:54:26] isaiah slay the first husband destroy
[1:54:29] that relationship shake and rock the
[1:54:31] boat
[1:54:34] and when they shook the boat and when
[1:54:37] the king was dead he brought isaiah into
[1:54:41] the temple
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:47] a trial and
[1:54:50] a difficulty that is pushing you closer
[1:54:54] to god is necessary
[1:54:59] if you must lose a job
[1:55:02] to be here on church it is good for you
[1:55:05] to lose that job
[1:55:10] because that job become a hindrance for
[1:55:12] you you cannot come to church two months
[1:55:15] three months four months six months
[1:55:18] because of the job
[1:55:20] and the day you're gonna leave that job
[1:55:23] not even the manager will come to visit
[1:55:25] you
[1:55:27] but there is a present
[1:55:29] help in the time of trouble that no
[1:55:32] matter what happen he will always be
[1:55:34] there but you are neglecting jesus
[1:55:37] christ because of your paycheck
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:43] church i'm not going to be in front of
[1:55:45] god with your blood
[1:55:46] and i keep telling you
[1:55:49] everybody okay so god slaying this king
[1:55:53] bring isaiah to the temple
[1:55:57] god said this is the perfect moment that
[1:56:00] he's trouble
[1:56:02] his mind is puzzled
[1:56:04] he's no longer thinking about the
[1:56:06] benefit that he has with the king
[1:56:09] now he can listen to me
[1:56:12] then god open up the vision
[1:56:15] you ready
[1:56:16] let's go to the scripture now
[1:56:20] i saw saw the lord
[1:56:22] lift up upon the throne
[1:56:25] so
[1:56:26] not only
[1:56:29] did he enter the natural temple
[1:56:32] do you follow me
[1:56:34] god took isaiah from the earthly temple
[1:56:38] about here
[1:56:40] and transfer isaiah to a heavenly temple
[1:56:44] or the true tabernacle we already
[1:56:46] explained you this
[1:56:49] when isaiah entered there he saw the
[1:56:52] throne
[1:56:53] remember in heaven there is no curtain
[1:56:56] the curtain where on the earth
[1:56:58] in heaven when you enter you see
[1:56:59] everything all the way there and back
[1:57:01] here
[1:57:02] on the earth you have the first curtain
[1:57:04] you have the second character you have
[1:57:05] the gate you have the door then you have
[1:57:07] the curtain of the holy holy that's uh
[1:57:10] the one that was split into but in
[1:57:12] heaven when isaiah enter he look he can
[1:57:15] see the throne but we know on the earth
[1:57:17] the throne is on the holiest
[1:57:20] remember on the third part
[1:57:22] i
[1:57:23] look he saw the throne in other words
[1:57:25] isaiah entered into the presence of god
[1:57:32] everybody okay
[1:57:33] give me time please
[1:57:36] upon the throne high
[1:57:39] and lift up and his train we already
[1:57:42] explained you this these angels
[1:57:44] filled the temple isaiah looked he see a
[1:57:46] great king sitting and the temple filled
[1:57:49] with angels
[1:57:50] what is going on verse two
[1:57:53] above it stood the seraphim
[1:57:56] how many remember seraphim
[1:58:00] do you remember when we talked about in
[1:58:01] the mystery of the level the seraphim
[1:58:04] are the out of heaven

[1:58:28] covered his face
[1:58:29] with two he covered his feet with two he
[1:58:32] did fly
[1:58:34] and one cried to another and say holy
[1:58:38] when isaiah entered the message that the
[1:58:42] seraphim are giving is holly
[1:58:46] holly holy three times
[1:58:52] so when you enter the presence of god
[1:58:55] the first thing is holiness
[1:58:59] that's why the high priest have to wear
[1:59:02] something here that say holiness unto
[1:59:04] the lord we will get to that later on
[1:59:07] everybody here

[1:59:15] god of mighty three times perfection the
[1:59:18] whole earth

[1:59:22] and the post of the door moved
[1:59:25] and the voice of him that cried and the
[1:59:28] house was filled with water
[1:59:31] this man entering into heaven didn't he
[1:59:35] god giving him the great vision of the
[1:59:37] seven seal
[1:59:40] you hear me
[1:59:41] when he entered the seraphim spoke in
[1:59:44] other words they reminded him
[1:59:47] that remember holy
[1:59:50] holy here
[1:59:51] holy the one who's sitting there is holy
[1:59:54] three times

[2:00:14] anybody here
[2:00:17] verse 5
[2:00:18] when isaiah saw that
[2:00:21] i say i turn around and i say i begin to
[2:00:23] speak
[2:00:24] let's see the speech of isaiah
[2:00:27] after the first husband is gone
[2:00:30] isaiah said
[2:00:32] why is me
[2:00:35] isaiah in the presence of god
[2:00:39] after the message of the seraphim the
[2:00:42] first thing that come to him he said woe
[2:00:47] not war to the people of israel
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:00:54] not work to the preachers in the message
[2:00:57] not wow to the pastors
[2:01:00] word to me
[2:01:05] not somebody else
[2:01:07] not my wife
[2:01:08] not my husband not my father not my
[2:01:11] mother wow unto me
[2:01:17] personal relationship
[2:01:20] follow your wife you're going to go to
[2:01:22] hell with him
[2:01:24] follow your husband you're going to go
[2:01:25] to hell with him
[2:01:28] brother branham said if he tells you to
[2:01:30] do something contrary to the word you're
[2:01:32] not supposed to listen to it
[2:01:36] why are you doing this my wife said this
[2:01:38] my wife said continue the way you
[2:01:40] continue you're going to go to hell
[2:01:45] when he got there he said wow
[2:01:48] unto who me
[2:01:50] personal
[2:01:56] let's continue
[2:01:57] one to me
[2:01:59] for i am what
[2:02:01] i am doomed
[2:02:03] what did isaiah do
[2:02:05] isaiah thought he was watchers
[2:02:08] isaiah thought he was a prophet
[2:02:10] a prophet working with the king
[2:02:12] when they call him they said this is the
[2:02:13] prophet this is the preacher this is the
[2:02:16] but when he got in the presence of god
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:20] he forgot that he was a prophet
[2:02:27] he even forgot his friend the king
[2:02:42] did you kill somebody
[2:02:46] did you drink beer
[2:02:49] isaiah
[2:02:50] because
[2:02:58] i am a man of water
[2:03:02] a prophet with unclean lips
[2:03:09] it can only be detected
[2:03:12] in the presence of god
[2:03:17] and the bible says out of the abundance
[2:03:19] of the water
[2:03:21] the mouth does what
[2:03:23] so if they're mad if the lips off as
[2:03:25] they were unclean what was going in the
[2:03:28] heart of isaiah
[2:03:34] everybody okay
[2:03:35] so isaiah in the presence of god
[2:03:39] begin to see where his error are
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:46] you follow me
[2:03:48] all that god did was shine the light
[2:03:53] and god put a pose and god waited
[2:03:57] and isaiah himself
[2:03:59] begin to tell god
[2:04:01] it is here
[2:04:05] in other words the great physician is
[2:04:07] there
[2:04:08] what are you looking for ma'am good
[2:04:10] morning my name is dr so-and-so what
[2:04:13] brings you to my office it is you to
[2:04:16] tell him where the problem
[2:04:23] i is
[2:04:25] my problem is here
[2:04:28] a prophet with unclean lips
[2:04:31] hallelujah
[2:04:33] he says and i dwell
[2:04:36] in the midst
[2:04:38] of people with water in other words not
[2:04:41] only me god but my environment
[2:04:47] is bad
[2:04:49] that environment that you like
[2:04:53] that environment of so-called message
[2:04:56] believer
[2:04:58] that when you sit with them it doesn't
[2:05:00] progress you
[2:05:03] they are just there to feed you with
[2:05:05] stories with jokes with game and you
[2:05:08] think the good friend get in the
[2:05:10] presence of god and turn around and look
[2:05:13] at that environment again
[2:05:21] my eyes everybody seen
[2:05:24] have seen who
[2:05:27] the lord of hosts
[2:05:29] i saw the king
[2:05:30] everybody
[2:05:32] when he did that
[2:05:34] number one getting in the presence of
[2:05:36] god bring you into recognition
[2:05:42] that you are a sinner
[2:05:45] remember the publican the bible says
[2:05:49] this
[2:05:50] that in job 42 i have heard
[2:05:53] of thee by the hearing of ears
[2:05:57] but my eyes have done what
[2:06:00] remember isaiah also saw god
[2:06:03] when job saw god
[2:06:05] what did job say
[2:06:07] because job thought he was righteous
[2:06:13] everybody here job look he said what
[2:06:15] have i done
[2:06:16] to do i mean going like this i didn't do
[2:06:20] anything bad i was the one helping the
[2:06:22] widow i was the one doing this i was the
[2:06:24] one doing this i was the one doing this
[2:06:27] and the people came and began to accuse
[2:06:30] him you did this you did he said i don't
[2:06:32] know i have never done it
[2:06:34] and he got self-righteous
[2:06:37] god opened the door he said get in my
[2:06:40] presence
[2:06:41] when job enter in the presence of god he
[2:06:45] said

[2:07:07] i bought my wife
[2:07:11] in other words job is telling god when i
[2:07:14] saw you i begin to hate myself
[2:07:19] when brother branham went to the sixth
[2:07:21] dimension when he looked at his body
[2:07:24] they say go back he said no i don't want
[2:07:26] to go back again
[2:07:31] that body that you punched on whatsapp
[2:07:34] he said i bore myself
[2:07:37] i repent in dust and water
[2:07:40] just seeing the king
[2:07:44] how can you come in the altar chewing
[2:07:47] chewing gum
[2:07:48] when a prophet coming in the altar is
[2:07:51] crying
[2:07:52] by you coming at the altar you poking
[2:07:55] your friends
[2:07:57] do you see what brother branham was
[2:07:58] talking about
[2:08:00] do you see
[2:08:01] he said in luke when peter saw the
[2:08:04] miracle of jesus christ the bible said
[2:08:06] when simon peter saw it he fell down at
[2:08:09] the dead jesus knees saying depart from
[2:08:13] me for i am a water
[2:08:19] you playing with
[2:08:20] church let's go to verse six
[2:08:23] the bible says this
[2:08:25] then
[2:08:26] flew one of the waters
[2:08:29] when he acknowledged himself
[2:08:32] to be a sinner
[2:08:35] leave out
[2:08:36] move quickly
[2:08:38] because the judgment is there
[2:08:41] anybody okay you cannot stand in the
[2:08:43] presence of the king being a sinner
[2:08:46] something must be done to isaiah quickly
[2:08:48] because his state is not correct
[2:08:51] to see the lord
[2:08:53] what happened
[2:08:55] oliver understood that he needed help
[2:08:59] after
[2:09:00] confessing
[2:09:05] after
[2:09:06] recognizing
[2:09:08] and confessing
[2:09:10] his error
[2:09:12] they leave out of heaven move quickly
[2:09:16] what did deliver delivered move with
[2:09:20] the bible says this he flew one of the
[2:09:23] seraphim to me

[2:09:30] if i bring a life call and i put it to
[2:09:32] you is that good
[2:09:34] how can you laugh at the author
[2:09:39] how can you play game at the altar
[2:09:44] because you never know what is going on
[2:09:46] in the altar he said a live call in his
[2:09:50] hand
[2:09:51] which he had taken
[2:09:53] with the water
[2:09:55] from off water
[2:10:00] everybody okay
[2:10:01] so when isaiah recognize
[2:10:04] and confess his sin
[2:10:06] and live out of heaven a seraphim stood
[2:10:10] up quickly
[2:10:12] and went straight
[2:10:14] to the altar
[2:10:16] which alter was that
[2:10:19] because we have the present altar and we
[2:10:22] also have the or the the golden altar
[2:10:26] which is the altar of essence but the
[2:10:28] bible said he went to the altar and when
[2:10:31] he went to the altar he took a tongue
[2:10:34] which is like a player and put and get a
[2:10:37] cold and come quickly to
[2:10:40] isaiah so the
[2:10:45] to clean up isaiah
[2:10:47] do you follow me
[2:10:49] you need the altar
[2:10:52] the fire from the altar
[2:10:56] are we are we getting together
[2:10:58] when he brought it from the altar verse
[2:11:00] seven
[2:11:01] and he laid upon his what
[2:11:04] why he didn't lay on his feet
[2:11:08] because isaiah told god where his
[2:11:12] problem was
[2:11:17] where is my problem it is in my mouth in
[2:11:20] your mouth fine they put a love code
[2:11:22] they say open their mouth
[2:11:25] right back here and they put it to your
[2:11:27] mouth a live call
[2:11:30] is that good
[2:11:31] why do you laugh
[2:11:34] why do you play
[2:11:36] why do you chew gum
[2:11:38] if that life can't hit your lip are you
[2:11:40] going to chew gum
[2:11:43] everybody care
[2:11:44] he said and laid it upon my mouth and
[2:11:47] said low
[2:11:48] this has touched your lips
[2:11:52] and your water
[2:11:54] so isaiah had iniquity
[2:11:57] he has things in his life that he was
[2:12:00] doing
[2:12:01] knowing that he was wrong
[2:12:04] a prophet
[2:12:05] a preacher
[2:12:07] in the message
[2:12:10] anybody here
[2:12:11] and your iniquity is water
[2:12:15] taken away
[2:12:17] and your water
[2:12:19] not only did he have iniquity but water
[2:12:23] is water
[2:12:24] so the altar can take away your iniquity
[2:12:30] oh the altar can purge your sin
[2:12:36] but to get the seraphim
[2:12:39] moving to you to clean you up
[2:12:44] you must
[2:12:45] understand how to approach the altar
[2:12:50] everybody okay
[2:12:52] let's go
[2:12:54] deeper into this altar the president
[2:12:57] everybody okay
[2:13:00] job god told moses
[2:13:02] let them make me a sanctuary
[2:13:05] that i made well among them
[2:13:07] according to all that i showed you after
[2:13:10] the pattern of the tabernacle
[2:13:13] and the pardon of water
[2:13:15] all the instrument or the furniture
[2:13:17] thereof even so shall you make it in
[2:13:20] other words whatever was in heaven was
[2:13:23] reproduced on the earth
[2:13:25] and back here now we are in the temple
[2:13:27] in heaven
[2:13:29] now in the message influence brother
[2:13:31] branham saying a messenger
[2:13:34] that is even closer to god
[2:13:37] you become his child
[2:13:40] on beyond the water
[2:13:44] brother branham says that when you pass
[2:13:47] the brazen altar
[2:13:49] that's when you become his child
[2:13:55] let's go slowly
[2:13:56] brother bottom say the seraphim
[2:14:00] is at the water
[2:14:02] so this altered
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:06] that they took the cord life
[2:14:10] to purge isaiah was the president
[2:14:18] he has fire that can take your iniquity
[2:14:21] away or can take your sins away
[2:14:25] let's continue again brother barnum help
[2:14:28] me up
[2:14:29] brother branham say if you remember
[2:14:31] that's the seraphim actually the hebrew
[2:14:34] word is the
[2:14:38] that's why they leave out on the earth
[2:14:40] were burning stuff at the brazen altar
[2:14:42] they were reproducing what was going on
[2:14:45] there
[2:14:46] they were the one who offered water
[2:14:50] and what
[2:14:51] so the seraphim
[2:14:55] the seraphim
[2:14:58] hallelujah
[2:15:00] offered incense
[2:15:03] and
[2:15:04] sacrifice
[2:15:07] he says we already talked about the
[2:15:09] golden altar
[2:15:11] you remember that
[2:15:13] which is talking about their prayers
[2:15:17] but this one is talking about the brazen
[2:15:20] altar when they are killing the
[2:15:24] sacrifice
[2:15:25] but the seraphim does both of them
[2:15:29] keep calm we are soaring somewhere
[2:15:33] he said it is just a higher order of
[2:15:36] angels
[2:15:37] that makes way
[2:15:39] that makes the way for the who
[2:15:43] as long as there is a what
[2:15:46] remember who was sitting on the throne
[2:15:48] anybody okay and they seraphim
[2:15:52] especially this burner had a special
[2:15:55] office they stay right in the presence
[2:15:58] of water
[2:15:59] that's why when isaiah recognized
[2:16:02] himself as a sinner
[2:16:04] the one who's responsible to prepare a
[2:16:07] sinner
[2:16:08] and to move him into the presence of god
[2:16:11] move quickly but based on the stage of
[2:16:15] isaiah he took the president in other
[2:16:18] words isaiah
[2:16:19] the step you are you need to deal with
[2:16:22] the president altar
[2:16:23] you are in the other court
[2:16:29] brother brother say that seraphim is a
[2:16:32] mighty word
[2:16:34] there it's not an angel what it is it's
[2:16:36] a sacrifice burner
[2:16:38] he has something to do with the
[2:16:40] atonement
[2:16:42] because he offered the sacrifice
[2:16:46] the sacrifice is the sacrifice for
[2:16:49] atoning sin
[2:16:53] everybody here
[2:16:55] brother bonham said he offered the
[2:16:57] sacrifice to make way for the water
[2:17:02] what did i say i do
[2:17:05] when he repented what happened the
[2:17:07] seraphim moved now to clean him up so
[2:17:09] they can progress with him ever here
[2:17:12] they repented sinner to the throne of
[2:17:15] water
[2:17:16] everybody here isaiah saw the throne
[2:17:19] they said stop right there
[2:17:21] check your life
[2:17:22] here holy
[2:17:24] holy holy here i say i look and say i'm
[2:17:27] not holy lord be merciful on me i am an
[2:17:31] answer i am an unclean man i am a sinner
[2:17:34] god said that's fine since you recognize
[2:17:37] and you confess yourself to be a sinner
[2:17:41] now seraphim
[2:17:42] move on move on with what
[2:17:45] he is at the brazen altar he went to the
[2:17:47] brazen altar pulled alive and purged him
[2:17:52] everybody okay
[2:17:54] but the seraphim goes forward with the
[2:17:57] offering right in the presence of who
[2:18:00] a burner the offer
[2:18:03] of the prayer that has been made they
[2:18:05] burn their sacrifice where are we going
[2:18:08] brother stephen
[2:18:09] brother branham say but an angel went
[2:18:12] over to the altar where the sacrifice
[2:18:14] was burning and took a tongue and took a
[2:18:17] cold life hot coal
[2:18:19] off the altar and come and touch his
[2:18:22] lips and say now you are clean
[2:18:26] your sin is purged
[2:18:28] now go and water
[2:18:30] so nobody can preach
[2:18:37] because what the problem say a prophet
[2:18:40] in the new testament is a preacher
[2:18:42] nobody can handle the gospel
[2:18:45] if you have not been purged before
[2:18:50] brother the bottom say one of the engine
[2:18:53] went over to the brazen altar
[2:18:56] and took the tongue and reached over and
[2:18:58] got a call of living fire and run over
[2:19:01] to isaiah and press it in his mouth say
[2:19:04] now you are clean go speak the word
[2:19:07] isaiah was water
[2:19:10] the brazen altar
[2:19:12] is an altar that bring a change to your
[2:19:16] life
[2:19:22] but you are not at the throne yet
[2:19:25] what happened then we found out he
[2:19:28] confesses sin and just as soon as he has
[2:19:31] done it this great voice that has been
[2:19:33] speaking flew down took his hand took
[2:19:36] the tongue pick up a call place it upon
[2:19:39] his hand came laid upon isaiah's lips
[2:19:42] and cleans him
[2:19:44] where are you going brother stephen then
[2:19:46] what happened
[2:19:47] one of the caribbean went over to the
[2:19:49] altar and took the tongue pick up a
[2:19:51] lavco and put it on his hand not carry
[2:19:54] it a tongue now that's what
[2:19:56] denominational uh showing that's wrong
[2:19:59] but he put it in his head and laid in
[2:20:01] the prophet lips and said that iniquity
[2:20:04] iniquity
[2:20:05] what is iniquity if you're sleeping you
[2:20:07] step up there inequity is something that
[2:20:10] you know is wrong
[2:20:12] and still holding to it when you know
[2:20:15] your quits are wrong and you still hold
[2:20:17] to it that is iniquity
[2:20:20] but when he confessed that he was wrong
[2:20:24] there was a creasing water
[2:20:28] so when you get to the altar don't be
[2:20:31] like the pharisee
[2:20:34] don't show god how good you are
[2:20:40] hallelujah
[2:20:41] as soon as he confessed and cleansed
[2:20:44] then followed the commission
[2:20:46] first he had to confess
[2:20:49] then he had to be cleansed and now it is
[2:20:52] the water
[2:20:54] then come the cleansing here come the
[2:20:57] caribbeans brother branham said because
[2:20:59] he was ready to confess and confess that
[2:21:02] he was unclean because he had looked to
[2:21:05] some bishop
[2:21:06] the king uzziah or somebody for his
[2:21:09] example instead of looking toward who
[2:21:13] if that's the way you were in the
[2:21:15] message
[2:21:16] you need to go back to the altar
[2:21:18] everybody here
[2:21:20] and he cried and when he cried out oh is
[2:21:24] me for i have done wrong
[2:21:26] i have put my example my trust in a man
[2:21:29] and i see the order of the lord and he
[2:21:31] cleans him with a cause of fire now
[2:21:34] isn't it wonderful how the man
[2:21:36] recognized himself being a what
[2:21:40] and look how god did as soon as he
[2:21:43] recognized he was there
[2:21:46] he confessed to being uh
[2:21:49] confess his what
[2:21:51] and he saw what god did how he did it
[2:21:54] how he cleans him by the cause of fire
[2:21:56] not a declaration of creed bunch of
[2:21:59] beats not some historical affair he
[2:22:02] cleans him present tense with live water
[2:22:05] so when you get in the presence of god
[2:22:09] always acknowledge you are wrong
[2:22:15] everybody okay
[2:22:16] anybody okay
[2:22:18] that was in heaven
[2:22:21] let's go back now on to the earth
[2:22:24] everybody okay
[2:22:26] you want to go home
[2:22:28] in psalm
[2:22:29] 118 27
[2:22:32] the bible say
[2:22:33] god is the lord this is david
[2:22:37] which has shown us light
[2:22:40] bind the sacrifice
[2:22:43] with cords
[2:22:44] even unto the water
[2:22:47] of the weapon
[2:22:48] so the brazen altar
[2:22:51] is not a happy place
[2:22:54] the brazen altar is a place when they
[2:22:58] are bringing the ship the ship is
[2:23:00] trembling
[2:23:02] because the bride's an altar
[2:23:05] speak of death
[2:23:10] somebody is going to die
[2:23:13] you cannot play you cannot going to the
[2:23:16] execution chewing gum
[2:23:19] you cannot be going to the executing
[2:23:21] punching one another
[2:23:23] everybody
[2:23:24] you doing that because you don't know
[2:23:26] what is going on
[2:23:28] brother branham say now the serpent on
[2:23:30] the pole represented sin already judged
[2:23:33] and he was made out of water
[2:23:36] and the altar is made out of brass
[2:23:39] now brass
[2:23:42] represents
[2:23:43] divine judgment
[2:23:48] not earthly judgment
[2:23:50] or mental judgment but divine water
[2:23:53] so the brazen altar is an author where
[2:23:57] the divine judgment of god must take
[2:24:01] place
[2:24:04] the mystery of the present altar
[2:24:07] brother branham say the present autumn
[2:24:10] was where the sacrifice was burnt
[2:24:15] was made of brass the president and it
[2:24:18] means that he was divine
[2:24:21] that is where the divine price
[2:24:27] was paid
[2:24:30] ever here
[2:24:31] here
[2:24:32] did not only kill the sacrifice
[2:24:36] every care
[2:24:37] but they burned the sacrifice
[2:24:42] in this altar on this altar
[2:24:45] this is where god apply his judgment
[2:24:48] and you pay the price
[2:24:51] right there at the altar
[2:24:54] what not any kind of price but a divine
[2:24:57] price
[2:24:59] the measurement of this altar
[2:25:02] is three
[2:25:05] on the height
[2:25:07] and if you look on the breath and the
[2:25:11] width everything is five
[2:25:14] in other words you have four fives there
[2:25:21] we know that five
[2:25:25] is the number of water
[2:25:28] and three is the number of water
[2:25:33] and we found that that grace
[2:25:36] is not in one place
[2:25:38] it goes into four places
[2:25:43] and pharaoh is the number of the earth
[2:25:47] you remember
[2:25:49] and it's a number of deliverance
[2:25:53] anybody here
[2:25:56] brother brother
[2:25:58] uh the bible
[2:26:00] in john chapter 1
[2:26:02] the bible says that the law
[2:26:05] was given by moses
[2:26:07] but grace
[2:26:09] and truth came by who
[2:26:12] thank god
[2:26:14] buy what
[2:26:16] are you what
[2:26:18] through water
[2:26:19] and not of yourself
[2:26:24] it is what
[2:26:27] why
[2:26:28] not of what
[2:26:29] lest any man should
[2:26:36] everybody okay
[2:26:37] so when you approach
[2:26:39] the altar
[2:26:41] the president
[2:26:43] the president they have grace in every
[2:26:47] direction
[2:26:54] hallelujah
[2:26:55] where do you live from the north side
[2:26:58] or you live on the south side
[2:27:01] you live on the east side or you live on
[2:27:05] the west side
[2:27:06] there is grace for you at the president
[2:27:10] because
[2:27:14] because it's an author
[2:27:17] that was placed on the earth to bring
[2:27:20] deliverance to you
[2:27:23] everybody here so when you approach that
[2:27:26] altar
[2:27:27] you are approaching deliverance
[2:27:30] there is grace
[2:27:32] to clean you up and to bring you unto
[2:27:35] perfection
[2:27:40] you okay
[2:27:41] the bible says being justified where in
[2:27:45] the other court by what
[2:27:47] but faith comes by water
[2:27:49] we have water
[2:27:52] you can go home free
[2:27:54] through our lord who
[2:27:56] brother branham said you forgive me
[2:27:58] i never done it what you forgiving me
[2:28:01] about see for if but if i'm guilty then
[2:28:05] i can be forgiven but i'm still not just
[2:28:07] because i did it but the word justified
[2:28:11] is though you never water
[2:28:14] justified and the blood of jesus christ
[2:28:16] cleanses from our sin jesus saw from sin
[2:28:20] till it's put in the books of god for um
[2:28:24] of god's forgetfulness he's the only one
[2:28:26] that can do it so when you are
[2:28:28] approaching this altar
[2:28:30] on the west side whether you live in
[2:28:32] israel whether you're in america whether
[2:28:35] you're in europe whether in your south
[2:28:37] america or south africa wherever you are
[2:28:40] there is grace in this altar
[2:28:42] there is deliverance disorder if you
[2:28:45] approach this altar this altar will
[2:28:47] deliver a grace
[2:28:50] to bring you unto perfection
[2:28:57] then he sent another prophet to
[2:29:00] introduce another age and another lamb
[2:29:04] that was the lamb of god for all adam
[2:29:06] race
[2:29:07] that takes away the sin of the world
[2:29:10] soon as the lamb was nailed to his water
[2:29:15] so they brought an altar here
[2:29:18] that kills the lamb
[2:29:21] and burn the sacrifice and accomplish
[2:29:24] the divine judgment
[2:29:26] to pay the price was typifying the cross
[2:29:32] because at the cross the lamb of god
[2:29:36] was crucified then the lamb of god spoke
[2:29:40] in tongues there the lamb of god took
[2:29:43] the judgment because the chastesment of
[2:29:46] your peace was upon him and the divine
[2:29:49] press was paid then
[2:29:55] ever here
[2:29:56] so if you come guilty at the cross and
[2:30:00] you recognize your fault
[2:30:03] the cross has the power to purge you
[2:30:06] until you can go home and you can go
[2:30:08] free
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:13] the bible says this
[2:30:15] that
[2:30:16] in colossians 2 that blowing out the
[2:30:19] handwriting of ordinances that was
[2:30:22] against who
[2:30:24] which was contrary to who
[2:30:26] he took it out of the way and did what
[2:30:31] so the brazen altar
[2:30:33] of the cross
[2:30:35] have a power
[2:30:39] to eliminate
[2:30:42] to erase
[2:30:45] to remove
[2:30:46] every accusation
[2:30:49] that is against you
[2:30:55] that's why roof
[2:31:03] that's why roof
[2:31:05] that's why roof
[2:31:07] when she left the house of an army she
[2:31:10] must enter by the president open
[2:31:14] because there were no demands
[2:31:17] there was a guest roof
[2:31:19] that said that no more about
[2:31:22] can enter into the congregation
[2:31:25] but when you go to the brazen altar they
[2:31:28] take the ordinance and they tear it down
[2:31:31] they nail it completely
[2:31:34] that's why roof could enter in israel
[2:31:37] and nobody has to speak anything
[2:31:42] her ordinances
[2:31:44] were now when she took her decision
[2:31:47] at the grass and altar
[2:31:52] everybody okay
[2:31:53] everybody okay because the shorter not
[2:31:56] only bring you grace
[2:31:59] because something was against you but he
[2:32:01] also bring you perfection
[2:32:04] hebrew 10 say for the love
[2:32:07] having the shadow of good things to come
[2:32:10] and not the very image of things can
[2:32:12] never with those sacrifices which they
[2:32:15] offer year by year continually make they
[2:32:18] come they come there on to what
[2:32:22] but for by one offering
[2:32:28] of jesus christ
[2:32:30] he has done water
[2:32:32] perfected how
[2:32:38] forever
[2:32:39] them that are water
[2:32:41] that's why that altar was three
[2:32:45] by five five that bring you grace
[2:32:48] four tells you about deliverance and
[2:32:51] when you get to the altar and you
[2:32:53] identify with that sacrifice and you
[2:32:56] recognize that you're a sinner and you
[2:32:59] confess your sin
[2:33:00] you humble yourself
[2:33:02] then that sacrifice perfect you one time
[2:33:06] forever then you are justified like you
[2:33:10] never done it to begin with and you can
[2:33:13] go home free
[2:33:15] the power of the brazen altar
[2:33:19] hallelujah
[2:33:20] so the fulfillment
[2:33:23] that's why roof have to enter there
[2:33:26] because there was an ordinance against
[2:33:28] the roof
[2:33:29] and that ordinance was that a moabite
[2:33:32] can never enter the congregation of
[2:33:34] israel ever here
[2:33:37] so the brazen author in the old
[2:33:40] testament was speaking about the cross
[2:33:43] so the cross was the true bazenote
[2:33:47] because this is where the judgment of
[2:33:49] god struck jesus christ
[2:33:51] and he paid the price and now you can go
[2:33:54] free
[2:33:56] everybody here
[2:33:57] if
[2:34:00] the judgment the ultra the president in
[2:34:03] heaven
[2:34:04] could free isaiah
[2:34:06] and remove his iniquity
[2:34:09] and he removed his sin
[2:34:11] if the president although
[2:34:13] ever here the one who come there
[2:34:16] is completely guiltless and go back home
[2:34:19] justified like the publican
[2:34:22] and the cross
[2:34:24] being
[2:34:25] the antitype
[2:34:27] of the true brazen altar made flesh
[2:34:32] so there must be power at the cross
[2:34:35] [Music]
[2:34:40] and because of the power
[2:34:43] they brought two fifths
[2:34:46] they brought roof and opera
[2:34:48] and they put them at the cross
[2:34:51] one was roof
[2:34:53] one was upper
[2:35:04] one feet from the left
[2:35:06] and one feet from the right side
[2:35:12] what happened
[2:35:14] now
[2:35:14] remember
[2:35:16] that when you are justified by faith i
[2:35:19] hope that explains it you are christian
[2:35:21] right then
[2:35:24] when you accept jesus as your personal
[2:35:28] savior you are a christian at that time
[2:35:31] i believe if you would die right then
[2:35:36] when you accept jesus as a savior i
[2:35:40] believe you are water
[2:35:42] because the blood will perfect you
[2:35:46] brother branham said that is what the
[2:35:49] dying water
[2:35:51] and the cross did water
[2:35:55] because at the cross the brazilian altar
[2:35:58] was made flesh
[2:36:00] and when the fifth understood
[2:36:03] by revelation that this is the president
[2:36:07] isaiah said when you are in the present
[2:36:10] hotel what do you do recognize yourself
[2:36:13] being water
[2:36:14] let's see what that thief say
[2:36:21] hallelujah
[2:36:23] one of the male factors which were rang
[2:36:26] rarely on him saying if that be christ
[2:36:29] saved herself oppa
[2:36:32] hey
[2:36:33] but
[2:36:35] the other
[2:36:36] answering rebuke him
[2:36:40] saying does not do what
[2:36:44] at the brazen hotel you must fear god
[2:36:48] seeing that are in the same water
[2:36:51] at the cross and we indeed water
[2:36:55] for we receive the water
[2:36:58] of our water
[2:37:00] but this man has done water
[2:37:02] and he said unto who
[2:37:05] the lamb but that one said the altar
[2:37:07] lord do whatever
[2:37:10] when what
[2:37:11] into the
[2:37:13] and jesus said unto him verily i say
[2:37:16] unto you one
[2:37:19] shall that be with me in water
[2:37:24] [Music]
[2:37:26] he got
[2:37:27] into the brazen altar
[2:37:29] he humbled himself
[2:37:31] he said father what i'm receiving now i
[2:37:35] am due for that it is just because i'm
[2:37:38] bad all i'm asking you remember me
[2:37:42] all i'm asking you is remember me

[2:37:51] my devil i am not looking at my father
[2:37:54] this is between me and you father
[2:37:57] remember me
[2:38:01] [Music]
[2:38:02] when jesus put the
[2:38:05] dna test
[2:38:06] he looked at him he saw the
[2:38:09] predestinated sin that is flashing like
[2:38:12] this
[2:38:14] there is something about the
[2:38:16] predestinated seed that humble
[2:38:19] themselves as their brazen altar because
[2:38:22] they understood that somebody paid the
[2:38:24] price for me somebody took my place
[2:38:27] somebody died for me
[2:38:32] jesus said not tomorrow
[2:38:34] not tomorrow today

[2:40:08] the mystery of the brazilian author
[2:40:11] brother branham said when they offered
[2:40:13] the little lamb
[2:40:15] took the little fellow and plucked up
[2:40:17] his throat
[2:40:18] and held his hand and feel it quivering
[2:40:21] dying and the blood going out to the

[2:40:43] finally say father
[2:40:44] i return my spirit

[2:40:48] and he's dying
[2:40:50] innocent
[2:40:51] with spit
[2:40:52] and everything the worshiper standing
[2:40:55] there realized that he was his sin
[2:40:59] that did that
[2:41:00] that ought to have been him but the lamb
[2:41:04] took his place
[2:41:05] that is

[2:41:15] sacrifice where the lord met them there
[2:41:18] in forgiveness of sin and cleansed them
[2:41:20] from all their unrighteousness at the
[2:41:23] burning altar the brazen altar burnt the
[2:41:26] beast and the blood from the beast

[2:43:02] chewing gums
[2:43:04] you don't sit in the church playing
[2:43:06] games
[2:43:07] cannot touch the horn yes sir
[2:43:10] raise your hand
[2:43:12] okay
[2:43:13] most gracious and holy god the almighty
[2:43:17] el shaddai
[2:43:18] that appeared to abraham in the name of
[2:43:21] the almighty
[2:43:22] the breasted god the strength giver the
[2:43:25] nourisher of the weak
[2:43:27] come to us tonight father we realize our
[2:43:30] weaknesses
[2:43:31] and our mistake we confess our sin
[2:43:34] before thee and lay them on their water
[2:43:38] of water and ask that the blood of jesus
[2:43:42] christ
[2:43:43] take them away in the sacrifice that we
[2:43:47] when you come to the altar don't play a
[2:43:51] game
[2:43:52] don't play game
[2:43:53] if you're not serious don't come but
[2:43:56] when you come make sure this is the
[2:43:58] first and the last time
[2:44:00] because i'm gonna be dead and when i'm
[2:44:02] rising out from there i'm a new person
[2:44:07] that don't
[2:44:08] have horns
[2:44:13] you have four horns
[2:44:15] deliverance
[2:44:17] number of the earth
[2:44:19] horn
[2:44:20] what is going on
[2:44:21] in exodus chapter 21 the bible says
[2:44:25] he dismitted a man
[2:44:27] so he
[2:44:29] died
[2:44:30] shall surely put to death in other words
[2:44:32] you kill somebody they have to kill you
[2:44:35] anybody okay
[2:44:37] and if a man
[2:44:38] lie not in weight
[2:44:40] but god deliver him into his hand then i
[2:44:43] will appointed a place whether he shall
[2:44:46] flee
[2:44:47] you know the city of refuge so if you
[2:44:50] didn't intentionally
[2:44:53] purpose to kill somebody and maybe you
[2:44:55] were working on your field and the
[2:44:57] instrument just run from your hand and
[2:45:00] hit somebody and they die
[2:45:02] you didn't do it purposely
[2:45:05] god said because of that i put the city
[2:45:07] of refuge
[2:45:09] you can leave just go straight enter
[2:45:12] there
[2:45:12] and then they'll explain you and you
[2:45:14] stay there until the death of your high
[2:45:16] priest you remember that
[2:45:18] so refuge was only on the cities of
[2:45:21] refuge
[2:45:22] let's look it up
[2:45:24] but if a man come presumptuously upon
[2:45:28] his neighbor premeditated
[2:45:31] to slay him with god
[2:45:33] that shall take him from minor water
[2:45:37] i thought if somebody died
[2:45:41] because
[2:45:42] you kill him without purpose
[2:45:45] the place you run is the city of refuge
[2:45:48] there were six of them but now
[2:45:51] moses opened up something
[2:45:53] he said if somebody kills somebody
[2:45:56] purposely with premeditation
[2:45:58] if he kills somebody
[2:46:00] go to that person at the altar and kill
[2:46:04] him
[2:46:05] so if you kill somebody
[2:46:08] what are you doing in the altar
[2:46:12] why you didn't go to the city of refuge
[2:46:15] because refuge was in the cities of
[2:46:18] refuge but now we are looking at
[2:46:20] somebody who killed someone run to the
[2:46:23] altar
[2:46:25] what is going on in the altar
[2:46:28] hallelujah
[2:46:29] the bible says in first king chapter
[2:46:31] five well verse one
[2:46:34] that adonaija the son of hugging the son
[2:46:38] of david exalted himself saying i will
[2:46:41] be king
[2:46:43] david is not dead his son rose up i will
[2:46:45] be king
[2:46:46] and he prepare him share your 10 horses
[2:46:49] and 50 men to run before him you can
[2:46:51] read this at home
[2:46:53] then bathsheba comes
[2:46:55] and talked to david he said david
[2:46:57] i don't know
[2:46:58] is already ruling you told me that
[2:47:01] solomon will be the king david say yes
[2:47:04] come

[2:47:20] appointed solomon they went and they
[2:47:23] appointed solomon king when they begin
[2:47:25] to try some they're trumping solomon is
[2:47:28] king solomon everything and the whole
[2:47:31] israel begin to gather together around
[2:47:33] salomon adonaija found out that he's in
[2:47:37] trouble
[2:47:38] that now they can kill him because the
[2:47:40] nation went to solomon he need to flee
[2:47:44] is he going to flee to the city of
[2:47:45] refuge where is he fleeing
[2:47:50] verse 50 and i do not just feel because
[2:47:53] of who
[2:47:54] and arose and went and did what
[2:47:58] the water
[2:48:03] everybody okay so how do i run
[2:48:07] he look at the city of refuge
[2:48:10] it's gonna take me two hours to get

[2:48:15] this the other one is in ohio no i can't
[2:48:18] make it i need a flight
[2:48:20] he looked left and right and he remember
[2:48:22] something
[2:48:27] he remember that in the temple
[2:48:31] there is an altar
[2:48:33] and that doctor have phone
[2:48:39] am i reading a different bible
[2:48:41] and he
[2:48:43] to the altar to the temple and went
[2:48:46] there and took a hold of the horn
[2:48:49] what is the mystery
[2:48:52] of this altar that if somebody is in
[2:48:55] trouble he can take hold of the horn
[2:48:58] and stay ready
[2:49:00] while the cities of refuge are there
[2:49:04] at the opening of the seventh year
[2:49:07] this bible
[2:49:08] become a new
[2:49:12] hallelujah
[2:49:14] and he once told solomon saying behold
[2:49:18] adonai your brother feared the king
[2:49:20] solomon king solomon for lo he has
[2:49:23] caught hold of the horns of the altar
[2:49:26] saying what
[2:49:28] let king solomon swear unto me today
[2:49:31] that he will not slay his servant with
[2:49:33] water
[2:49:34] in the city of refuge when you enter
[2:49:37] there you don't go out you go out they
[2:49:39] kill you
[2:49:40] but this horn when you enter there
[2:49:43] adonai doesn't want to leave their own
[2:49:45] he's saying
[2:49:46] tell solomon to swear first
[2:49:49] before i take hand off the horn
[2:49:53] if he swear to me that he's not gonna
[2:49:56] kill me
[2:49:57] then i will remove but until then
[2:50:02] what is in this horn
[2:50:07] hallelujah
[2:50:09] saying let king solomon swear unto me
[2:50:12] today that he will not slay his servant
[2:50:14] with the sword and solomon say if he
[2:50:17] will show himself a worthy man then
[2:50:19] shall not ahead of him fall to the earth
[2:50:22] but if wickedness shall be found in him
[2:50:25] he shall die i give him a condition
[2:50:29] if you continue good no problem if you
[2:50:31] go there and you go shoot somebody again
[2:50:33] then i'll handle it
[2:50:34] so king solomon sent and they brought
[2:50:37] him down from the water
[2:50:40] and he came and did what
[2:50:43] to the king
[2:50:44] to the king
[2:50:45] they forgave him
[2:50:48] they forgive him what he did
[2:50:51] and the king himself have to free you
[2:50:55] he sent somebody take him off the altar
[2:50:58] ever here and when you come you bow into
[2:51:01] the king solomon and salomon say go down
[2:51:04] what
[2:51:06] now you can go home free
[2:51:08] by just holding to the horn
[2:51:11] what is wrong with those horns brother
[2:51:12] stephen
[2:51:14] second king chapter two
[2:51:17] then determine comes to job job was
[2:51:20] affiliated with adonaija
[2:51:22] the first one already hold of the altar
[2:51:25] they gave him mercy he went home
[2:51:27] thank you jesus thank you jesus you can
[2:51:29] go home the second one in trouble what
[2:51:32] solomon is the king oh my god what am i
[2:51:34] gonna do the city of refuge there's no
[2:51:36] flight for chicago there's no flight to
[2:51:38] go here there's no flight okay what's
[2:51:40] going on job fled unto the water
[2:51:44] why are they fleeing to the tabernacle
[2:51:48] the mystery
[2:51:50] of the president and cut hold of the
[2:51:53] water
[2:51:54] same thing
[2:51:56] so it looks like when somebody is in
[2:51:59] trouble
[2:52:02] and they can't get access to the city of
[2:52:05] refuge
[2:52:06] they can run to another secret place
[2:52:09] called the brazen altar
[2:52:12] and they were horn in that altar that
[2:52:14] when you catch that outdoors horn
[2:52:17] nobody touches you
[2:52:19] jesus
[2:52:22] hallelujah
[2:52:25] and he was told king solomon that job
[2:52:28] was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord
[2:52:31] and behold he is by the altar
[2:52:35] then solomon sent banaya the son of
[2:52:38] jehoiada saying go and do what
[2:52:43] go kill him
[2:52:44] i thought when you were in the horn they
[2:52:46] don't kill you
[2:52:48] watch
[2:52:49] verse 30. and benaya came to the
[2:52:52] tabernacle of the lord watch clearly and
[2:52:55] say unto him
[2:52:56] that says the king
[2:52:58] do what
[2:53:00] did solomon tell him that
[2:53:02] solomon say when you go you will see him
[2:53:05] at the altar kill him right there but
[2:53:08] when binaya got there
[2:53:10] he saw
[2:53:12] job
[2:53:13] holding the horn
[2:53:15] he understood that if somebody hold the
[2:53:18] horn
[2:53:19] you don't kill him so he was telling him
[2:53:22] come forth so when you take your hand
[2:53:24] from those horns then i slay you
[2:53:29] everybody okay
[2:53:31] hallelujah and say unto him that said
[2:53:34] the king come forth and he said what
[2:53:37] i'm not gonna remove my hand from here i

[2:54:26] from me and from the house of my
[2:54:29] job killed somebody
[2:54:32] innocently not innocently purposely in
[2:54:36] revenge if you go read the book and
[2:54:38] according to exodus if you kill somebody
[2:54:42] intentionally even if you hold to the
[2:54:45] horn they have a right to take you off
[2:54:48] but the first one at donaja didn't kill
[2:54:51] anybody
[2:54:52] but when he hold on he got refuge
[2:54:55] what is going on with the horn brother
[2:54:57] branham said horns means a kingdom
[2:55:06] brother branham said horns means power
[2:55:11] and brother branham said lones means the
[2:55:14] lamb protection

[3:15:54] from the glory of god you have to
[3:15:56] understand that there is nothing in you
[3:15:59] normally you should go straight to hell
[3:16:01] and then you now have to understand
[3:16:04] that but i have a representation
[3:16:06] i have somebody who took my plan my
[3:16:09] place i have somebody who paid the price
[3:16:11] i have somebody who took the divine
[3:16:14] judgment somebody who was wounded
[3:16:17] for my transgression from my sin he was
[3:16:20] bruised
[3:16:21] somebody who took my place
[3:16:25] and you have to put yourself in that
[3:16:26] place and see the suffering of christ
[3:16:30] and how jesus was crying at the cross
[3:16:35] with the spirit all over his face
[3:16:38] when you see that picture
[3:16:40] the chewing gum will come enough
[3:16:42] the joking will stop
[3:16:44] because it's calling for a death
[3:16:47] a death which is speaking about a
[3:16:49] separation
[3:16:50] i skip a quote but brother branham said
[3:16:52] that that altar brings separation
[3:16:55] roof have to be separated from his from
[3:16:57] her people that's why she have to reach
[3:16:59] that road that daughter to be completely
[3:17:02] separated from the mobile once she did
[3:17:05] it then she can move on to the next
[3:17:08] stage
[3:17:09] she get into the holy of holies now ruth
[3:17:11] can begin to serve
[3:17:13] let's pray heavenly father
[3:17:15] lord we are approaching you again father
[3:17:17] humbly lord thanking you for everything
[3:17:21] father we did
[3:17:22] the best that we can and the people gave
[3:17:24] us some grace to reach where we were
[3:17:27] going
[3:17:28] lord
[3:17:29] many times
[3:17:30] we seen people coming to the altar over
[3:17:33] and over
[3:17:35] but after the altar their lives are not
[3:17:37] changing
[3:17:38] we seen teenagers coming to the altar
[3:17:41] father this is not to condemn them
[3:17:43] because they didn't know any better
[3:17:45] they were just going by what they knew
[3:17:48] by the tradition that was that were in
[3:17:50] the lands that everybody goes to the
[3:17:52] altar and just kneel down and pray but
[3:17:55] they didn't even understand the meaning
[3:17:57] of that altar
[3:17:59] father this is examining time
[3:18:01] as we see things happening into the
[3:18:03] world
[3:18:04] as we can even see the movement of the
[3:18:07] king of the north
[3:18:08] father we know that the time is very
[3:18:11] very near we saw what you did here lord
[3:18:13] with the purple curtain and now you are
[3:18:16] moving the iron curtain and the bamboo
[3:18:18] curtain also is lord father joining in
[3:18:21] we can see those curtains beginning to
[3:18:24] move again and father we know that it's
[3:18:26] the time father that the bride should be
[3:18:29] ready father to meet you into the air
[3:18:32] lord we cannot go five years without
[3:18:34] receiving the holy spirit we cannot go
[3:18:36] 20 years without receiving the holy
[3:18:38] spirit we cannot continue moving like
[3:18:41] that and be pleased with a religion
[3:18:43] because gifts have blended us the gift
[3:18:46] that you gave the people without
[3:18:48] repentance have blunded them they
[3:18:50] thought because they can play because
[3:18:52] they can sing because they can preach
[3:18:54] because they can see a dream because
[3:18:56] they can do this and that therefore you
[3:18:59] are with them but when they look at
[3:19:01] their lives father they found out that
[3:19:03] they're still struggling father may
[3:19:05] everybody go back like that soldier when
[3:19:08] lord the father they came to him and
[3:19:10] they asked him they say you need to
[3:19:12] think quick why did you left him
[3:19:15] father he was able to go all the way to
[3:19:17] the cradle and say this is where i left
[3:19:19] you father may everybody examine their
[3:19:22] beginning may they examine if they truly
[3:19:25] came further unto this altar because
[3:19:28] this altar is very important like
[3:19:30] brother branham saying that he's going
[3:19:32] to wipe all the sin that we did
[3:19:35] previously
[3:19:36] father we need that we cannot continue
[3:19:39] with guiltiness we cannot continue with
[3:19:41] condemnation we want to go home like the
[3:19:43] publican that was justified
[3:19:46] in himself and going home happy knowing
[3:19:49] lord father that he has confessed his
[3:19:52] prayer under the burning lamb that was
[3:19:55] burning upon the brazen altar that lamb
[3:19:57] was screaming that lamb was crying that
[3:20:00] lamb was bleeding and the publican could
[3:20:03] not even look to heaven he put his heads
[3:20:05] down recognizes himself that he's a
[3:20:08] sinner he was born in israel but yet he
[3:20:11] was a sinner many are born in this
[3:20:14] message but yet they are still sinners
[3:20:16] but father may they recognize themselves
[3:20:19] that this is what needed to be done to
[3:20:22] be identified with the perfect sacrifice
[3:20:25] the perfect lamb of god which is jesus
[3:20:28] christ and from there lay all their
[3:20:30] burden there at the cross and find their
[3:20:33] place of refuge where they can move on
[3:20:36] and go home and move on to their next
[3:20:38] stage and if ever something happened to
[3:20:40] them right there
[3:20:42] you can take them home because lord
[3:20:44] father they have been purged by thee
[3:20:46] lord we thank you and we commit this day
[3:20:49] unto the hand father may you bring the
[3:20:51] people back again to their respective
[3:20:53] place safe because of the rain outside
[3:20:56] and may lord father you continue to ring
[3:20:58] this message and unfold more and more
[3:21:01] that they can see more than what was
[3:21:03] spoken this morning and father
[3:21:04] understand the mercies of redemption and
[3:21:08] the love that you have expressed to us
[3:21:10] in coming down and doing this for our
