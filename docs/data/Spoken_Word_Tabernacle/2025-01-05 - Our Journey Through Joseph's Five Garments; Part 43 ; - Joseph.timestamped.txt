[56:08] uh uh option for the meal offering but I
[56:10] didn't finish reading the scripture so I
[56:13] thought I need to make sure I read the
[56:15] scripture the meal offering can come in
[56:17] three forms so I'm going to read it to
[56:20] make sure it's there so he was not left
[56:22] alone because I only gave two options so
[56:24] you bear with me we got a lot to
[56:27] download but by God's grace all will be
[56:29] okay amen the Bible says in the Book of
[56:32] Leviticus this is from last Sunday it
[56:35] says in uh verse one Leviticus 2 that
[56:38] and when any will offer a meat offering
[56:42] which brother brandham call a meal
[56:44] offering so when you see brother Branham
[56:46] saying meal offering this is exactly
[56:49] what he's referring to he say when any
[56:51] will offer a meal or a meat offering
[56:54] unto the Lord he's offering shall be of
[56:57] fine flow so the meal offering will come
[57:01] as a fine flow this is the first uh
[57:04] option and he shall pour oil on upon it
[57:07] and put Frankin SS there on we can't get
[57:10] into this that's another teaching there
[57:12] and if th bring an oblation which is an
[57:15] offering of a meat offering baked in the
[57:19] oven it shall be on leav cake this is
[57:22] the second one of fine flour mingle with
[57:25] oil all or unle waffer or wafer Anointed
[57:30] with oil so either it's a fine flour or
[57:33] it's an UNL cake or it's unle wer so we
[57:37] got three option right there I just want
[57:39] to make sure you got it because I only
[57:42] gave two I was dealing with Gideon and
[57:44] the 11 cake so I forgot the last one so

[1:09:24] yes with fall
[1:09:27] suffering and so forth are we together
[1:09:32] amen the one who spoke these two records
[1:09:35] is
[1:09:37] God so God is
[1:09:39] mindful of the good part and the bad
[1:09:42] part and matter of fact God himself
[1:09:46] partook on both of
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:52] them in the beginning was the word
[1:09:56] yes and the Word was with God and the
[1:10:01] Word was God are we together and the
[1:10:05] Word was made flesh now we hear amen did
[1:10:10] the man Jesus died yes he did yes he did
[1:10:14] not God because God left Jesus in
[1:10:17] gony are we together the man Christ died
[1:10:21] yes sir Jesus matter of fact died as a
[1:10:24] sinner
[1:10:29] Jesus did nothing sin but jesus carried
[1:10:32] the sin of the world that's what took
[1:10:35] him back to
[1:10:36] hell that's what took him to hell
[1:10:39] because he died as a sin so Christ
[1:10:43] himself fulfilled the Divine part and he
[1:10:46] also
[1:10:47] fulfilled the human part that's why
[1:10:50] brother Bram say he was 100% God and
[1:10:55] 100% man but as a man he never die as a
[1:11:00] sinless
[1:11:02] man Christ died as a
[1:11:08] sinner brother Bram says this glory to
[1:11:12] God in the message
[1:11:14] adoption 1960 paragraph 105 follow me
[1:11:19] carefully he says when was our names put
[1:11:24] in the lamp's book of of life in other
[1:11:26] word what time when Byam say when the
[1:11:32] lamb was slain come on now when before
[1:11:37] the foundation of the world we already
[1:11:40] spoke that this human part here is a
[1:11:45] part connected to the Earth that's right
[1:11:48] because our
[1:11:50] body come from the dust of the Earth are
[1:11:53] we together so be before the material of
[1:11:56] your
[1:11:59] body was formed because brother Bram say
[1:12:02] all our bodies were laying here since
[1:12:05] the Garden of
[1:12:07] Eden are we together before your body
[1:12:10] was existed on this Earth are we
[1:12:14] together the atonement was already
[1:12:20] slain so your atonement came before the
[1:12:24] part of you that will cause you
[1:12:30] problem praise God brother Bram says
[1:12:33] when God was
[1:12:36] Jehovah El
[1:12:39] Elohim the self existing one just like
[1:12:43] one great big diamond and he could not
[1:12:46] be nothing else but inside of this
[1:12:48] diamon he's what attribute was What A
[1:12:52] Savior
[1:12:55] when God created The World God displayed
[1:12:59] the attribute of
[1:13:02] creation amen are we together God
[1:13:06] displayed the attribute of how powerful
[1:13:09] he is amen how M he is how he can speak
[1:13:14] something and something will come into
[1:13:17] existence but whatever God was doing God
[1:13:22] was not able to fully manifest
[1:13:27] himself because certain attribute could
[1:13:31] not be displayed when everything is
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:41] perfect I hope you following me I hope
[1:13:45] you following me when everything is
[1:13:48] perfect God is
[1:13:51] limited Oh Glory to his expression Jes
[1:13:56] God will only reveal himself a certain
[1:13:59] way but you will not know God in another
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:10] way this is
[1:14:13] God okay inside God is the third
[1:14:18] pole everybody loves this are we
[1:14:22] together amen inside God is savior
[1:14:25] yes are we together third pool doesn't
[1:14:30] have anything to do with
[1:14:34] sin come on
[1:14:36] now third pool doesn't have anything to
[1:14:40] do with the atonement
[1:14:43] amen I don't know if you get me that's
[1:14:46] why Jesus spoke to the tree before his
[1:14:50] death yes Jesus was not dead yet and
[1:14:54] Jesus gave they disciple that power
[1:14:57] before he died and brother Bram was
[1:15:00] puzzled yes he was brother Bram say wait
[1:15:03] a minute the lamb must be dead then we
[1:15:06] can receive the power of creation how
[1:15:09] can God give that power without even the
[1:15:12] lamb being dead brother Bram say so that
[1:15:15] power is not in the atonement God say he
[1:15:18] was in the atonement amen are we
[1:15:20] together but the atonement was not
[1:15:22] killed yet yes are we together so the
[1:15:25] third pool will Express itself
[1:15:30] regardless are we together but the
[1:15:33] attribute of God as a savior cannot be
[1:15:38] expressed until there is a
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:44] sinner I don't know if you get what I'm
[1:15:48] saying if everything is
[1:15:51] perfect amen there is nothing to save
[1:15:56] God is
[1:15:57] locked but God doesn't want to be locked
[1:16:01] that's why the glitch on a female on a
[1:16:05] woman have a
[1:16:07] secret the glitch that God did on Eve
[1:16:11] was actually a
[1:16:14] pipe it is Eve that releases the tension
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:19] [Applause]
[1:16:23] God I don't know if we
[1:16:28] together you are slowing me down so I
[1:16:30] don't have any
[1:16:32] choices God have attribute right in God
[1:16:37] there is
[1:16:38] perfection in God there is
[1:16:41] creation Amen in God there is savior in
[1:16:45] God there is healer you cannot heal if
[1:16:48] there is no sickness are we together are
[1:16:51] we together so God Express this good
[1:16:54] part here came out am are we together
[1:16:58] this one was building
[1:17:01] tension inside of God are we together
[1:17:05] and God could not use
[1:17:08] Adam
[1:17:11] sir mer do you understand what I'm
[1:17:14] saying do you understand what I'm saying
[1:17:17] God could not use Adam to release the
[1:17:20] tension God uses the woman because the
[1:17:24] woman is the one that releases the
[1:17:29] tension Hallelujah see you on March 22
[1:17:33] my friend are we together are we
[1:17:36] together when the tension is built up
[1:17:38] Hallelujah it is the woman that releases
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:45] tension I don't know if we together
[1:17:47] there when the T because there are some
[1:17:50] attribute that need to come out that
[1:17:54] need to Express itself and those
[1:17:57] attribute needed a woman so women are
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:03] special Hallelujah the blood of Jesus
[1:18:07] Christ is
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:13] pre don't worry sister say Amen am and
[1:18:18] me as the blood of Jesus Christ I say
[1:18:21] amen that's why we are special am
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:32] I'm going to let God himself shock
[1:18:35] you can I
[1:18:38] continue brother Bram say diamond his
[1:18:42] attribute was What A Savior in this
[1:18:45] attribute on the inside of him was what
[1:18:48] a Healer follow me now well there was
[1:18:52] nothing to save and nothing to do what
[1:18:55] to heal are you ready MH you can swallow
[1:18:59] this right but his attribute did what
[1:19:03] produced it so who produced sin
[1:19:10] God sir don't look at me look at the
[1:19:14] [Applause]
[1:19:17] bo there was nothing to do what nothing
[1:19:21] to do what heal but his attribute did
[1:19:24] what produc it so it's the attribute of
[1:19:28] a savior that produce the
[1:19:36] sin don't say
[1:19:40] Amen let me start it
[1:19:42] again it's hard to swallow right let me
[1:19:46] help you up who created the
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:51] devil who created the devil how can God
[1:19:55] create a devil yes sir I'm asking you a
[1:19:58] question who created the devil God how
[1:20:02] can God create the devil a bad
[1:20:06] man
[1:20:08] Hallelujah now it's okay now we okay now
[1:20:11] we okay we not okay yet let me start it
[1:20:15] again who created the devil God why did
[1:20:18] God created something that he knows will
[1:20:21] trouble
[1:20:23] everything because God already
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:29] knows who chose
[1:20:33] [Applause]
[1:20:36] Judas who chose Judas Jesus said I am
[1:20:41] the one who pick people why did Jesus
[1:20:44] pick up the devil in flesh and Jesus
[1:20:47] said I'm the one who pick all of you and
[1:20:50] one of you is a devil who pick that
[1:20:53] devil it is
[1:20:56] necessary because without Judas they
[1:20:59] won't kill the
[1:21:00] lamb it is the Lamb that produce
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:07] Judas I warn you I'm not preaching to
[1:21:11] the serpent seed I warn you I know
[1:21:14] exactly what I was warning you for are
[1:21:16] we together it is the attribute of God
[1:21:20] that produces that am this mess here was
[1:21:24] caused by
[1:21:31] God don't worry my friend you are
[1:21:34] slowing me down you have to I have to
[1:21:37] recuperate all this
[1:21:40] minute if God create something what do
[1:21:43] you think that thing should come up bad
[1:21:46] or perfect per perfect good who created
[1:21:49] this
[1:21:50] world why did go why didn't God create
[1:21:53] that perfect
[1:21:55] the Bible said the world was in
[1:21:59] darkness it was a mess who created the
[1:22:03] mess why did he create the mess so he
[1:22:06] can use the mess to display his power
[1:22:10] amen when God begin to change the mess
[1:22:14] and transform the mess now we see the
[1:22:17] power of God God need mess
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:25] wonderful I am not preaching to the
[1:22:28] serpent
[1:22:29] seed sir all it is God who says ye are
[1:22:34] gods and he said but you shall die like
[1:22:38] men God saw this sir but God needed this
[1:22:43] part here to express his
[1:22:47] [Applause]
[1:22:50] attribute God needed
[1:22:52] sickness so he can display as Jehovah
[1:22:57] Rafa God want you to lack something so
[1:23:01] he can be Jehovah
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:04] jar it is God that created those
[1:23:08] things why because the atonement
[1:23:11] requires
[1:23:14] it I don't know if you're getting what
[1:23:16] I'm
[1:23:17] saying this atonement here when you have
[1:23:21] an atonement like a an attribute like
[1:23:24] savior
[1:23:25] this attribute automatically call for a
[1:23:30] sinner are we together are we together
[1:23:34] when a sinner appear on the scene The
[1:23:37] Sinner actually Quicken that
[1:23:42] attribute the sner The Sinner Quicken
[1:23:46] the attribute savior so when God sees a
[1:23:49] sinner savior begin to cry like let me
[1:23:52] go let me go let let me go let me go let
[1:23:56] me jump on this let me
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:01] jump when you are sick then the Healer
[1:24:05] begin to pop say move out of the way it
[1:24:08] is my time it is my time it is my
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:16] time are we together are we together
[1:24:20] remember the power of Moses could create
[1:24:23] something
[1:24:25] and remove it you remember Moses he
[1:24:29] could create something and he can also
[1:24:31] remove it so the atonement create the
[1:24:35] mess and express itself and remove the
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:42] mess I don't know if you understanding
[1:24:45] me the atonement will will will bur mess
[1:24:49] and when the mess exists then the
[1:24:52] atonement come and swallow a mess and
[1:24:56] there is no more mess so this part here
[1:25:00] was created by the atonement so when the
[1:25:03] atonement is coming it is not looking
[1:25:06] for this this is God but the atonement
[1:25:10] is looking for your human part when God
[1:25:13] sees you as a man then God is is not
[1:25:17] fighting let me go let me go now because
[1:25:20] this is the time I can show him I am his
[1:25:23] savior
[1:25:24] I am the Healer I am the provider I am
[1:25:28] the protector because you don't protect
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:38] God the Holy One of Israel does not
[1:25:42] sleep God don't sleep but the man can
[1:25:46] sleep so when you sleep then God become
[1:25:48] your
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:50] protection are we together so he took
[1:25:53] your
[1:25:56] yes it took this one Amen to release the
[1:26:01] attribute of God in the fullness of it
[1:26:04] because this part here is perfect this
[1:26:08] is a clean part the clean part doesn't
[1:26:11] need atonement to handle
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:17] it let me finish my friend brother Bram
[1:26:21] say so then before the foundation of the
[1:26:25] world when he know that the great
[1:26:29] display in here of him that he will be

[1:32:10] him hallu brother Bram thought he's
[1:32:13] walking with us the atonement was
[1:32:17] constantly watching brother

[1:32:32] him if you will let me reach where I
[1:32:35] wanted to go
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] today let's go to Leviticus 4 my friend
[1:32:41] Oh Glory to God
[1:32:44] amen amen these things we got to come to
[1:32:47] a Clarity of what are we believing in
[1:32:50] this message because the devil can't be
[1:32:53] playing with
[1:32:54] for so long like this no we need to know
[1:32:57] what we believe in amen you need to know
[1:33:01] who you are hallelujah how can you marry
[1:33:05] somebody without sin how is that going
[1:33:07] to
[1:33:09] happen how are you going to marry the
[1:33:11] Lamb of God without a
[1:33:16] sin and you must be without spot and
[1:33:19] without wrinkle how can you reach be
[1:33:22] without spot and wrinkle
[1:33:26] so there got to be something to make you
[1:33:28] with spot and without wrinkle so when
[1:33:32] God say the Brad will be with us spot
[1:33:34] and wrinkle it means the Brad will have
[1:33:36] wrinkle and spot so God is already aware
[1:33:40] of the wrinkle of s but when you have
[1:33:42] wrinkle of spot then the power of
[1:33:46] transformation begin to
[1:33:52] work this is already white how can I
[1:33:55] turn this white
[1:33:57] again it's already
[1:33:59] white it need to be dark then when I
[1:34:03] turn it toward you say wow look at the
[1:34:05] power of course look at me you will see
[1:34:08] the
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:14] power let's go to Leviticus 4 my friend
[1:34:18] Lord help me are we together amen verse
[1:34:22] one the Bible say and the Lord spoke to
[1:34:25] Moses saying speak to the children of
[1:34:28] Israel saying if a soul shall sin
[1:34:32] through
[1:34:32] what we clear on that one I'm reading
[1:34:36] this again for a reason amen if a soul
[1:34:40] will sin through ignorance against any
[1:34:44] of the commandments so this ignorance
[1:34:47] take care of all
[1:34:51] sin I'm reading the Bible
[1:34:54] it is one ignorance but in that
[1:34:57] ignorance it might be ignorance maybe
[1:34:59] you lie maybe you did this maybe you did
[1:35:02] so all of them are put together in one
[1:35:05] thing ignorance that's
[1:35:08] right ignorance can fit anything in your
[1:35:11] [Applause]
[1:35:14] life father please help me reach where I
[1:35:18] want to go he says any commandment of
[1:35:21] the Lord concerning things

[2:07:09] good that falls to me and he divided to
[2:07:12] them his living and not many days after
[2:07:16] the youngest son gathered all together
[2:07:19] and took his journey where into a far
[2:07:22] country into a far
[2:07:24] country oh God help

[2:07:30] son tap the brother we clear on that one
[2:07:34] okay the younger one tap the brother and

[2:07:39] through this but something happened to
[2:07:41] the younger one he says and to a far
[2:07:44] country and there he wasted his
[2:07:46] substance with what righteous living
[2:07:49] with rightous living amen we need to be
[2:07:53] specific rightous living was with
[2:07:56] who with

[2:08:19] fathers have bred enough and to spare
[2:08:22] and I perish with what hunger when he
[2:08:25] came to

[2:08:46] door don't slow me down I'm trying to
[2:08:48] move on this boy a home
[2:08:52] he has a
[2:08:55] mind amen a mind
[2:08:58] worthy of a
[2:09:02] son are we together then when he left
[2:09:06] home he went with a different
[2:09:09] mind because

[2:09:33] because what he did is not worthy of the
[2:09:36] son of that

[2:10:48] six the Mind outside of home is verse
[2:10:53] seven go are we together but the problem
[2:10:58] is even though he left with another man
[2:11:02] L are we
[2:11:04] together God loaded the first mind in
[2:11:09] [Applause]
[2:11:12] him are we together and put a

[2:11:46] was singing in the nightclub
[2:11:53] the strength God gave him he was beating
[2:11:55] his friends so he spare
[2:11:59] everything but in him there was another
[2:12:03] man with a
[2:12:05] [Applause]
[2:12:12] time in other
[2:12:14] word are we together when he was at home
[2:12:18] he didn't have any age

[2:12:26] eternal he didn't have a
[2:12:28] beginning he didn't have a ending he
[2:12:32] didn't have a mother he didn't have a
[2:12:34] father but when he entered to a far away
[2:12:38] country he pick up a father and a mother
[2:12:41] and maybe he was born in
[2:12:45] 1960 with this
[2:12:49] man I don't know who born in 1960 I just
[2:12:52] pick it up then God took this mind and
[2:12:56] wrote Under This mind are you following

[2:14:05] mind he was not him but remember he
[2:14:09] cannot go back home without the first
[2:14:13] man it is the F man that will change his

[2:14:54] ignorantly let's start claming my friend
[2:14:57] Oh Glory to God are we together are we
[2:15:01] together amen we found out that brother
[2:15:03] Bram last Sunday says that the spirit of
[2:15:07] BM is another form of the spirit of
[2:15:13] Jezebel this ignorance will spare you a
[2:15:17] lot of stuff you did you will see it
[2:15:20] sooner amen
[2:15:21] brother said bam was Jezebel in another
[2:15:24] form the quote is there bam was a male
[2:15:29] Jezebel was a woman how can brother Bram
[2:15:32] say they were the Same
[2:15:34] Spirit remember the message and the
[2:15:37] Bible are perfectly in line when you
[2:15:40] don't understand brother Bram push the
[2:15:43] break humble
[2:15:45] yourself accept what he said first then
[2:15:49] God will vend
[2:15:51] and illuminate
[2:15:53] you when brother says this he never gave
[2:15:58] a
[2:15:59] scripture but watch what the spirit of
[2:16:01] the Lord does are we
[2:16:04] together Revelation 2 I have few things
[2:16:07] against it because that has them that
[2:16:09] hold the doctrine of who B who taught B
[2:16:12] to cast stabing block before the
[2:16:14] children of
[2:16:15] Israel are we there the doctrine of bam
[2:16:19] to eat what these things things
[2:16:22] sacrifice unto idols and commit what
[2:16:26] fornication so bam taught them to eat
[2:16:29] think sacrifice unto ad and to commit
[2:16:33] fornication we clear now not
[2:16:36] withstanding I have few things look I
[2:16:39] have few things do you see that I have
[2:16:43] few things against thee not withstanding
[2:16:45] I have few things against same thing
[2:16:49] because that suffer that woman who
[2:16:51] Jezebel which call herself a prophet to
[2:16:56] teach are we together and to seduce my
[2:16:59] servant to do what commit fornication
[2:17:02] commit fornication and to eat things
[2:17:04] sacrifice and to what Idols so jel and
[2:17:07] Bam are the same
[2:17:10] thing if I you raise your hand bam
[2:17:15] sacrifice to Adam commit fornication
[2:17:18] Jezebel sacrifice to Adam
[2:17:21] commit that's why brother Bram say
[2:17:24] Jezebel and B were the same thing only
[2:17:27] different name or different form but the
[2:17:32] characteristic is the
[2:17:36] same
[2:17:37] Hallelujah
[2:17:39] Jesus and brother Charles are the
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:49] same only different name and different
[2:17:53] form but the
[2:17:55] characteristic is the same because Jesus
[2:17:59] say the work that I do you shall do also
[2:18:05] amen are we together oh glory to God are
[2:18:11] we together then when we Trace Jezebel
[2:18:14] we found that Jezebel according to
[2:18:17] Revelation 17 she was mystery B on the
[2:18:21] great the mother of what har and we
[2:18:24] found the youngest son was CAU with what
[2:18:28] harot which was the Gentile church but
[2:18:31] the catching of the Harlot was
[2:18:34] ignorantly so he required a
[2:18:38] sacrifice that's why the father say kill
[2:18:41] the F dead

[2:18:49] be can be

[2:40:36] me I have lost none of them except the
[2:40:40] son of

[2:40:44] pedition in other word that ignorance of
[2:40:48] sin is
[2:40:52] selective only for the
[2:40:56] predestinated if I can reach where I'm
[2:40:59] trying to go listen my
[2:41:02] friend are you

[2:41:21] There Are We There Are We There verse 13
[2:41:27] who was before a what a blasphemer and a
[2:41:30] what a persecutor and a what injurious
[2:41:34] do you know an injurious what he
[2:41:37] means huh Paul
[2:41:40] injurious he said an injurious and I'm
[2:41:44] going to help you this might be too
[2:41:45] strong on you this Paul was not drinking
[2:41:49] beer
[2:41:50] [Music]
[2:41:54] Paul was going to
[2:41:58] church so if he was going to church how
[2:42:01] can he be
[2:42:02] ignorant because he learned
[2:42:05] Theology and the Gan so he need to be
[2:42:09] held
[2:42:10] accountable God why do you condemn the
[2:42:12] Pharisee and Paul say I am Pharisee of
[2:42:15] the Pharisees but when it's Paul God
[2:42:18] says
[2:42:23] he say you go to hell you go to hell you
[2:42:26] go to hell
[2:42:27] Paul get here where were

[2:43:15] where I did it ignorantly in what
[2:43:20] unbelief how can a Pharisee of a
[2:43:23] Pharisee be
[2:43:28] ignorant I'm asking you a
[2:43:31] [Music]
[2:43:33] question so all that did knowing the
[2:43:43] C amen God took all of them and said he
[2:43:49] was an
[2:43:51] unbeliever so how do you blame Paul
[2:43:54] anymore because unbeliever means in the
[2:43:58] nightclub smoking weed that unbeliever
[2:44:02] Paul say uhuh me I didn't go to the
[2:44:04] nightclub I was in church but I'm

[2:50:37] ignorance are we together let's stop
[2:50:42] here hold right here go home review this
[2:50:46] again and Lord's willing we pick up on
[2:50:48] Sunday and we clam again higher are we
[2:50:51] together are we together are we together
[2:50:55] are we together there is a calf there is
[2:50:59] a lamb there is a sacrifice that have
[2:51:02] been sent to pray to plead for our
[2:51:06] ignorance everything you have ever done
[2:51:10] amen outside the message and for those
[2:51:14] that were born in the message and were
[2:51:16] doing bad things like Paul God
[2:51:20] summarized all of
[2:51:22] that and put it under the scene of
[2:51:26] ignorance in sin in
[2:51:29] unbelief and because it's ignorance and
[2:51:32] the sin of unbelief God is under
[2:51:35] obligation to wipe it completely because
[2:51:38] it's the atonement it is the attribute
[2:51:42] of God that
[2:51:44] produced are we together are we together
[2:51:51] Hallelujah tell that devil whatever you
[2:51:55] keep bringing I don't know what you're
[2:51:58] bringing because we have a difficulty
[2:52:01] saying that we didn't do
[2:52:03] it your natural conscience block you
[2:52:07] brother Bram say you never done it but
[2:52:09] your conscience say I know brother Bram
[2:52:11] say that but you know better that you
[2:52:13] did it so today get another answer and
[2:52:16] tell that devil I did it ignor IGN
[2:52:20] [Applause]
[2:52:22] L because this is what you want I did it
[2:52:25] ignorantly in unbelief now go ahead and
[2:52:28] handle that
[2:52:30] one because Paul suffered Paul suffered
[2:52:34] A persecuted the church I'm not worthy
[2:52:36] to be called Apostle and then he he he
[2:52:38] he he he stagger and stop somewhere he
[2:52:41] say but I am what I
[2:52:45] am but in other words you got to make
[2:52:47] put a stop to your
[2:52:49] blaming and say listen God knew this
[2:52:53] there is nothing new in my life that God
[2:52:56] doesn't know before he sent me this word
[2:52:59] he already so and he provided the lamb
[2:53:02] and he's telling me everything I did was
[2:53:05] under ignorance so therefore from today
[2:53:09] Satan I did it under
[2:53:12] [Applause]
[2:53:14] ignorance so that the grace of God can
[2:53:17] be expressed through me
[2:53:19] because without that ignorance I would
[2:53:21] not have known Jesus as a savior I would
[2:53:24] not have known Jesus as a redeemer I
[2:53:27] would not have known Jesus as a Healer
[2:53:30] he took that ignorance to produce the
[2:53:33] attribute of God God richly bless you
[2:53:36] let's stand my
[2:53:40] [Applause]
[2:53:46] friend hallu
[2:53:49] hallelujah
[2:53:51] hallelujah hallelujah you shall know the
[2:53:54] truth and the truth shall send you free
[2:53:58] amen either you cling to your own idea
[2:54:02] of trying to justify yourself and keep
[2:54:05] regretting that I
[2:54:06] wish I didn't do this I wish I didn't do
[2:54:09] this I wish if they can return me back
[2:54:12] young again I would have escaped this
[2:54:15] this error I would have stop that am
[2:54:19] those error came so that the attribute
[2:54:22] of God can be made manifest in your
[2:54:28] life
[2:54:29] amen amen amen so when brother CH brag
[2:54:35] and say Jesus loved me and I say yes he
[2:54:39] loved me too he saved me I say he saved
[2:54:41] me too he loved me more no no no no I
[2:54:43] don't think so he loved me more because
[2:54:46] I know what he did for me and he become
[2:54:48] an individual Revelation between you and
[2:54:52] Jesus
[2:54:56] Christ let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[2:54:59] we are approaching you humbly this
[2:55:01] afternoon father we thank you for your
[2:55:04] grace for your love and for your mercy
[2:55:06] and for everything you have been doing
[2:55:08] for us father this is as far as you want
[2:55:12] it to go Lord but
[2:55:14] Lord I believe a lot has been given yes
[2:55:18] to free your
[2:55:21] children father the religious
[2:55:25] system have distorted our mind until
[2:55:29] when your answers come it comes in a
[2:55:32] simple way and it's very hard to be
[2:55:36] accepted because of the way we were made
[2:55:39] up under the religion
[2:55:42] deformity Lord there was a man that was
[2:55:46] put in the prison oh yes and your told
[2:55:49] us that Lord the president of the United
[2:55:52] States took a small paper and wrote a
[2:55:56] pardon and send to the man but because
[2:56:00] the way the man was wired a presidential
[2:56:03] letter must
[2:56:05] come maybe from the mayor of the city
[2:56:10] maybe from the Prime Minister maybe he
[2:56:12] have to be looking like a golden leather
[2:56:16] with the stamp of the United States
[2:56:18] brought by a sheriff all kind of
[2:56:21] protocol to bring that letter and
[2:56:23] because of that twisting of mind the man
[2:56:26] lost his pardon and was shot and killed
[2:56:30] because he didn't understand the
[2:56:32] Simplicity of the pardon father this
[2:56:35] sermon might not be compared with other
[2:56:38] big preacher sermon but Lord father you
[2:56:41] choose to bring this truth in a simple
[2:56:44] way to make your children understand
[2:56:47] that it's very simple
[2:56:49] everything that we ever done was
[2:56:51] produced by the atonement and we did it
[2:56:54] ignorantly so that the atonement can be
[2:56:57] effective in our life and have its place
[2:57:00] to manifest it so that you can show
[2:57:03] through us the vessels of Glory The
[2:57:05] Riches of your mystery of your kingdom
[2:57:09] of Lord father your saving power so that
[2:57:11] at the end you can show us Lord father
[2:57:14] as a trophy of Lord your Redemption but
[2:57:18] Lord let none of us here Lord neglect
[2:57:21] Lord such a Salvation let no one Lord
[2:57:24] father despise Lord father the way this
[2:57:26] message are coming Lord but may we take
[2:57:29] it as a pardon because it won't be
[2:57:31] accepted as a pardon if we don't
[2:57:33] recognize this as a pardon father you
[2:57:36] gave a sacrifice to free us to Deliver
[2:57:39] Us from all our
[2:57:43] guiltiness of the past those time that
[2:57:47] the devil has been using
[2:57:48] to beat us up up and down up and down up
[2:57:52] and down until we lack joy and we feel
[2:57:55] like we miserable under this truth Lord
[2:57:58] but this truth came to set us free to
[2:58:01] make us a joyful Pride knowing Lord
[2:58:03] father that we are your children we are
[2:58:06] the children of the most high God we are
[2:58:09] god father Lord Jesus Christ because of
[2:58:12] us you left Heaven you came down to shed

[2:58:21] lishia age Our Lives can be sprinkled by
[2:58:25] the blood so that Lord father the
[2:58:29] atonement can remove the sin of
