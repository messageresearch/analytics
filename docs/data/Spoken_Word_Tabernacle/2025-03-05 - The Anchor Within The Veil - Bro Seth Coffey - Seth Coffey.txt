for his testimony and then any unspoken request tonight amen hello God bless you all um this is like a praise report this actually happened on Sunday um Sunday around like it was since like 10:00 till 4:00 in the morning or so our dad first we went to sleep then around midnight our dad woke us up to pray so we were all tired but some of us woke up to go pray and as when we went to go pray our dad was talking to us about prayer and even supplication of prayer and as he was talking to us we started praying and as we're praying um he's talking about prayer as we're praying and as we're praying we heard like the doorbell ring and we also have like this app in our phone that can check the camera to see who's outside so we heard a dark bell ring at first we didn't pay no M toy then it rang again then we my dad checked the camera as I was checking the window if someone was outside and then it rang like the third time my dad still checked but nobody was outside and as it was ringing in my heart I was like because the scripture came it was like God is because of revelation God is knocking at the door and it tells you to open it and in my head I was well God if he wanted to enter into the house he could simply go through the wall he didn't need to ring the door so in my head I was like I was telling my dad my dad why don't you go open the door but he didn't do anything but I was like maybe because we're in America certain people may it might be something else then later on as we're praying my dad opens the door and I was like that's exactly what I was praying for my dad to open the door to let God in so as um we prayed we saw nobody was outside so to to us that was like as we were praying God was vindicating our prayers and then later on we came to church and what was preached was exactly what my dad was talking as we were praying and even before we're praying anyways amen if we all could bow Heart Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for this whole entire day for the

Lord this evening and father you've seen Lord God that Lord today Father God the time that Lord we put aside father God to study your word Lord and to Father Draw N to you Lord because you said father if you would be lifted up father God you would draw us n unto you Lord and and Lord we did what we could father God to Father just enter into that presence Lord and father the church Lord God they they took their Time Lord out of their busy schedule father God and put you preeminent father and they came here today Lord to hear from you almighty God and Lord we're just asking father God that Lord we realize Lord with all of our efforts almighty God and all the things that we could do Lord father without you lord it would be meaningless Lord so God we're just asking you Lord to be the Supreme one Among Us father today Lord we're just asking you to be welcome in this place Lord father God we're asking you Lord to say what you want to say and do what you want to do Lord and move in the way that you want to move almighty God lord we're asking you to have preeminence in this service Lord for father we know Lord God if there's any good thing that happens it's from you God if there's anything Lord that is worthy of Praise Lord It's you father Lord there's nothing we could bring or nothing we could do Lord that without you that would amount to anything almighty God but

father that isn't pleasing to you Lord and father maybe even we walked into this place Lord with it father God we ask that you would for forgive us almighty God Lord we pray that once more father you

us almighty God Once More For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen if you have your Bibles and you don't mind turning to Hebrews the 6th chapter amen and we would by God's help we'd like to preach on the anchor within the Veil The Anchor within the veil Hebrews the 6th chapter starting with the 13th verse might do a you just bear with me tonight I don't know how the Lord will lead this service but we're just trusting him to do it amen I appreciate brother Isaiah bringing me down I I've been you know in my office since 10:00 this morning studying and and I was just trying to put it together and and I was really enjoying myself but before I knew it time got got gone and I said man I I need you to drive me up here real quick so he came running by to help me and I was able to study for a little longer so I just really appreciate him doing that now now we're just trusting in the Lord amen it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thy seed and so after that he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and oath of confirmation is them the end of all Strife wherein God God willing more abundantly to show under the HS of his promise the ubility of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie I'm so thankful it's impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for a refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor amen as an anchor for the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth in to that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made and high priest Forever After the order of MDC Amen Let Us bow our heads once more Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the reading of your word Lord we thank you for your never failing presence in a time of need Lord we just ask father once more God that you would feel welcome Lord here and be the Supreme one Among Us Lord we thank you for your word Lord and we just pray that it would bless each and every heart in Jesus Christ's name amen you may have your seats amen we want to speak on that an anchor and brother brandom says you know a ship sometimes servicemen and so forth know it who have been on the sea when really the waves gets to dashing too hard for the boat amen they anchor it and it's got a line that lets it down that holds it it may flip around this way and that way around but the anchor holds it the anchor they cannot see land anywhere but they drop the anchor Beyond the Veil amen which is the water and that but they drop the anchor Beyond the Veil which is the water and that anchor goes down into the bottom of the sea plot the top of some big mountain somewhere and it drags till it catches a mountain catches on that mountain I want you to notice that on the other side of the veil it catches onto that mountain and it holds to the crevice there and all the sea can't move it no more all the sea cannot move it no more it's anchored out of sight now but it's anchored remember that and every person that has received Jesus Christ as personal savior been bornn again with the Holy Spirit you've dropped anchor how many's been born again by the Holy Spirit I have some encouraging words you've dropped anchor amen if you're sick and your hope is built on Christ you've dropped anchor the doctor May say this that or the other but as sure as your faith looks Yonder The Waves the sick spells the fevers may rise and everything like that but your Anchor Holds within the veil amen somewhere out yonder in the Mystic land say what have you got your hopes built on the doctor says it's gone the medicine says it can't do nothing the surgery has failed but my hopes is not built on that amen my hope is not built on those things we have our hopes within the veil what Veil through the shedding of his blood that tore his Spirit from his body and between that Veil there the anchor has caught hold of something he said I've seen a ship one time when it was tossed out there and I thought what's holding that ship in the same spot I couldn't understand it sitting out there in the sea and I noticed the waves had carried around this way and back around this way but it didn't move from that place now I want you to notice it wasn't that it wasn't tossed but it was that it wasn't moved amen I could see I I could not see nothing but there was a little wire rope that had run down from the bow of that ship into the anchor that had caught into something beneath my where I could where I could not see beyond the waters and it was it was a holding there and I said praise be to God God yes one day I found an anchor and you know what that is is that Veil I thought that was beautiful and this is just in my own little way but but I I I begin to ask the Lord you know on that that that anchor and I begin to say Lord why is it that I find it so hard to be able to explain that anchor and he revealed it so beautifully to me to my heart because he said you see that anchor is Beyond the Veil and you cannot see it with these natural eyes but that anchor goes beyond that Veil amen and the scripture says says in Corinthians for all things are for your sakes we don't like that some things but sometimes but the abundant grace might through the that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet inward man is renewed day by day for our L Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and I love this while we look look not at the things which are seen but which things are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal I love how brother Brandon would tap that out over and over again he said you know I kept looking at that ship and I wondered what was holding it there cuz see even though brother brandham couldn't see what was holding that ship there he knew that something greater than the ship was there holding that ship amen and you know I'm a fisherman I'm a fisherman and a hunter I know most of y'all know that by now and I get a lot of things from uh uh from God by Nature when I'm out there and you know one time I was fishing and I don't know if y'all know about I'm sure you've heard of the South Fork River but one time I was in the South Fork River and and I was in this boat and I wanted to fish this spot but every time I tried to fish this spot the water would just keep pushing me down and pushing me down and pushing me down so I finally got up to a place where I could I grabed my little anchor and it wasn't much it was a little about a little five maybe 10 lb anchor and and I'm sitting here and and what I'm guessing is you know probably a, plus pounds of motor and boat and everything else and I've got this little anchor in my hand and when I'm sitting there with this little anchor I get to a place and I toss it upstream and as the boat begins to begins to go but then all of a sudden that anchor grabs something and when that anchor grabs something it about jerks you in the boat because it's grabbing so hard and so forcefully and you know I threw that little anchor out there and and I couldn't see what it grabbed but you know why cuz it went beyond the veil it went beyond the veil and it went down into that water and it grabbed a hold of something and you know I couldn't see what it was but I'll tell you one thing I knew it was a solid foundation whatever it grabbed a hold of and but even though while I was there and I was trying to fish that spot you know just me moving in the current the boat would begin to rock back and forth and left and right and and even though I was sitting there and I was rocking I still could not be moved because that anchor had found a place it was grabbing on to a to a to a to a strong foundation and you know a beautiful thing about that when when it came time for me to move and I was I was trying to get out of there you know I went and I grabbed a hold of that anchor but brother that anchor had grabbed so strong that even when I tried to pull up that anchor and and even with my own ability I hope you get what I'm saying even with my own ability I tried to move the anchor and I tried to tried to get it out of my own way but that anchor was so strong and it grabbed into a strong Rock and it was in there and even In My Own Strength I I couldn't move that and if I could say it this way something kept holding me I I I I couldn't explain it I couldn't tell you what was down there but there was something that I grabbed a hold of that it was so great I couldn't even move it amen I mean it's thankful for an anchor in our life and and I want to take this and this is might where it get a little bit different but I might just slow down here for a second and and I begin to think about that and I begin to think about job and the anchor that he had in his life and I'll just read the script R here and it says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord the Lord and said from and to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job man job ain't done nothing he just man he's just if I can say it in my own words he's just chilling on the earth you know and living his life and all of a sudden the Lord says that thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and isth Evil then Satan answered him the Lord and said does job fear God for not hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all he hath on every side and have th bless him in the work of his hands and and his substance is increased in the land he said but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he is all all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thy hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said and said The Oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the the sabines fell I can't say that saines fell upon them and took them away yay they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee and while he yet was speaking there came another and said the fire of God is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep from the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped alone to tell thee oh man Satan just left one guy alive just to tell him how bad his day was going to be and while he was yet speaking there came another and said the Chans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yay and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and behold there came a great wind from the Wilderness and smoke the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell thee now listen here now this is where we're talking about an anchor then job arose and rent his mantel and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped hallelujah hallelu hallelujah see I want you to I want you to I might say this many more times for this service but I want you to realize right now that takes more than a man that takes more than a man and shaved his head fell down and worshiped and said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither the lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and all this job sin not nor charge God foolishly now I want to show you something here cuz remember we're talking about within the veil and the problem that we have is the veil yes sir amen I want you to notice this now we're just maybe just teach for a little bit here but I want you to realize here that job was not a sinner sir job was not a sinner he believed God and listen just because you're a Believer does not mean you're exempt from trials job was a great father it said that he continuously made sacrifices for for his children listen I know you mothers and fathers stay up and pray for your children and you hold your token up high and he raised up a child in the way it should go and and he prayed you know and on this side of the veil when you when you looked at at his life his life was amazing amazing on this side of the veil man the LI he he had it all together he had a family he had friends he had all kinds of wealth he he had the perfect family picture so to speak and and everybody on the outside was saying man that guy must be doing something right that that guy must be living right for God and everybody said man I wish I was job you know I wish I could be job job's got it all together I love how everything just goes right for job and his life is amazing but then one day God said if you can considered my servant job and and you know even Satan was looking on the wrong side of the veil because Satan would begin to say well God the only reason that he worships you is because you give him this thing you give him that thing everything in life goes well for him and you know Satan was looking at that saying you only serve him you put a hedge around him and everything he wants but see God wasn't looking at that Veil that Satan was looking at but God was looking Beyond another Veil can I say a veil within a veil and and he was looking on the inside of job and when Satan was looking at the blessings in the thing of God God was looking at a predestinated seed on the inside of job he knew what job was made of but Satan attacks and the the Sheep die and the servants die and the children die and then next thing you know you know you think that's the end of of the trial you know we get bad call every now and then and he gets four in one day and the next thing you know Satan goes back before him and said and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect man and upright man one that fearth God and shth Evil and still he holdeth fast his intey although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause and Satan answer and SL said skin for skin yeah all that a man hath will he give for his life but for put forth his hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thy hand but save his life so it went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smoked job with a sore boils from so of his foot all the way to his CR and he took him uh he took him a posture to scrape him with all and he sat down among the ashes and now listen here so now what we have here is not only as his family gone and not only not only is all of the things that that he holds material on this side now his very health is beginning to dwindle and Satan is beginning to attack his health why because God said if you considered my servant job and so now he's sitting there with some pottery and he's scraping the Bulls off of his skin and he's sitting there on the ashes of everything that he had and he's sitting there scraping the Bulls off of his skin and if that's not bad enough his wife looking on the other side of the veil okay looking on the other side of the veil she begins to say look job God has taking everything from you he he he he took your he took your house he took your kids he took he took everything from you why don't you just curse your God and die and even his friends show up to try to give him support but while they're there they're looking on the other side of the veil and they begin to say job you must be a secret sinner [Applause] it they come up with their own conclusion that that job you must be a secret sinner because all these bad things are happening to you but and you know all those things looking around you can't tell me that job wasn't distressed you can't tell me that job didn't know what was going on or wasn't worried what was going on but there was still something an anchor on the inside of job when his wife begin to say curse your God and die something on the inside died just like that anchor that wouldn't be moved even though none of these things move me as it says in the book of Acts and he said none of these things move me and he began to look at his wife and said you speak like a foolish woman what did that an anchor but he said there thou speakest as one of the fullish women what shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil and all this did job not sin with his lips oh Hallelujah but in the middle of job's trial when job's going through his greatest trial God begins to pull back the veil and he begins to tell job job I want to show you where your anchor is placed I want to show you why you're not falling I want to show you why you're still standing and he begin to say Where Were You job when the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you see his anchor went past this flesh fail but it went all the way back to Eternity in the mind of almighty God come what may he was anchored Hallelujah he got such a revelation that at that moment he be to say I know my redeemer liveth but there is no listen the story don't in there just because you're going through a trial listen in the Book of Ecclesiastes says he makes everything beautiful in his timing for everything there is a purpose under there's a season There's A Time to Kill You know the whole scripture is all these things see job was just going through a season but it never changed the fact he was a son and God will make even in your darkest trial in your worst hours in the thing that you're going through God is going to make something beautiful he gives you an anchor to hold on through the trial but when you you come through the trial God's going to make it beautiful each and every time if you stand for him he'll stand for you and he gave back job twice of everything that he had and restored him his own children and you know what he did it because job had an anchor that he didn't even put there by himself but almighty God put it there we think too much of ourselves sometimes you ain't the one holding yourself you ain't the one that kept you here but almighty God [Music] [Applause] did every Christian believer has to be pushed into those [Applause] trials every Christian believer has to be put on the ash Heap so that he can come forth with an experience I know when you gave your heart to the Lord you thought you knew but after you came through a trial that you thought there ain't no way I could ever make it through this trial and God brought you out you came out saying I know brother bam says now to be a Christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identify with him notice he is in me and I in him notice in every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together oh Hallelujah and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world Hallelujah where is your anchor tonight before the foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed if I can say this and it's all right you had an anchor before you ever had a problem you had an anchor before you ever came up to a trial God God already knew you before the foundation of the world he said he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world do you realize you had an anchor before the foundation of the world when he wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah before the foundation of the world already an anchor 10 million years 10 million years before the world was form I was back there with him if I've got eternal life oh can I say if I've got an anchor I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy he showed job your anchor ain't here buddy but your anchor is in eternity and I wonder if before job ever got well I wonder if before the skin the the boils ever left his hands you could look over and a man that was just being persecuted and put down and called a sinner here comes a man with blls with his hands raised up saying thank you [Applause] God I can see job with all his boils and tears and heart this is me and heartache he begins to raise his hands and say I know my redeemer liveth he had an anchor that went past what everyone else could see his wife couldn't see the anchor curse him as die his friends couldn't see it you're a sinner Jo but job knew and he grabbed that anchor had grabbed Hallelujah you are not excused from trials but you have a blessed anchor a Blessed Assurance I think of the Hebrew children when they were going through the fire listen you know why they went through the fire cuz they stood for God it wasn't because they were a bunch of Sinners a bunch of a bunch of backsliders but they said we don't care what you're going to do Hallelujah can I just say this to Seth coffee I don't care what they say about the message out there for me and my house we will serve the Lord they can say the days of Miracles has passed but for me in my house we will serve the Lord and they made a decree go out there and God said have you have you considered my three Hebrew children oh Hallelujah they will not bow they will not bend the knee to that economical system they will not be in the need of those denominational ideas have you considered my Hebrew children they said heat it up seven times hotter hallelujah we're in the worst age that there ever was they said heat it up seven times hard but it didn't change the anchor situations don't change the anchor they begin they begin to go for that CR King and he said you know what's going to happen to you you're going to be burned up and they said you know what we know one thing our God is able our God is able and he can deliver us if he wants to but even if he don't The Anchor Holds even if he don't the Anchor Holds we ain't moving off of our revelation we ain't moving off what we believe our God is the one true Living God and we don't care what you say hey why don't you go ahead and eat up eight times hot or 10 it don't matter to us we are God's children Hallelujah but if you stand for God God will stand for you as he begin to walk into that fire that King begin to say who is that fourth one in the fire that fourth was the [Applause] anchor Paul had an anchor I hope y'all realize tonight this ain't a different anchor the same anchor that Paul had you know one day he must have been sitting there in jail and he began to think about the Church of the Living God that he persecuted in the church that he put down Satan began to tell him man you've went too far he began to tell Paul you know Paul you'll never be good enough Paul you shouldn't even be doing this Paul you should give up Paul you done this Paul you done that but then he began to remember on the road to Damascus one day when he was sitting there and he wasn't even looking for Jesus but Jesus came looking for [Applause] [Music] him who are you Lord I am Jesus and he began to think you know what I didn't go looking for Jesus but Jesus came looking for me and if Jesus came looking for me then Jesus must want me and something anchored in his heart he said who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword that is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long listen it ain't that there ain't problems it ain't that there ain't trials but by God's grace there's an anchor all the day long as sheep for the slauter name and all these things somebody say all these things all these things somebody say all these things we nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth you know then when you get a little deeper in the water you just let out a little more line for that ain't nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah church if you can look at Paul and Silas listen they ain't got a different Holy Ghost they ain't got a different God but the same God of Paul and Silas and is the same God that we serve and I tell you what I'm glad to have that same anchor I I don't I don't I don't like just looking back and saying well that was for the apostles I'm glad to have an anchor to know that if God did that for them God can do that for me you know I've got that Paul I I don't know about y'all but but I've had that Paul and Silas anchor when when everything was was closed up around me and and I was just beaten and put down and and everybody putting me down and putting me out and telling me I was no good and that Old Devil coming around saying you know you don't you don't deserve to be here you don't belong to be here and you know I'm sitting there and that but all of a sudden I begin to remember back to a time when I was a 14 15 year old boy and I was sitting at an altar one night and God came down and touched my heart and put an anchor in there and I begin to think on that you know I begin to think that I begin to think God's been so good to me God's done so much for me God's took care of me and if I can bear a little bit of this for his name sake I'm glad to do it and that same anchor that is in Paul and Silas is the same anchor that's in me that when things come around me and it gets so bad and I don't know where to look and I don't know how I'm going to get out I hear a little song coming on a little something in my heart begins to sink what is it that anchor grabs a hold that in the middle of my trial I can begin to say my chains are gone I've been set free Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wret like me I've got that same anchor and you've got that anchor how many times have you gave up how many times have you quit and you said I'll never go back to that church again but something on the inside brother Stephen you said that's the last service I'll preach I ain't ever going to preach again but then an anchor grabs hold and says get back over here you weren't called to give up you weren't called to give in but you're called to stand doing all to stand therefore [Applause] stand he got so much of an anchor that one day he begin to say oh death where is your sting at anyway ways brother brandom said that one day Lord Jesus he was sitting there and death was buzzing around him and that Satan anchored Hallelujah Satan anchored that stinger in Jesus and he thought he could pull it right back out but when he tried to pull it out he realized this Stinger was gone this anchor is made out of nothing less than the lovely Lord Jesus Christ we are Anchored In Christ the word and he knew when Jesus said it is finished and he knew when he went down and Rose back to life again Paul said death is finished it's finished Hallelujah and he said oh death where is thy sting oh gra where is thy Victory it can take its punches it can do what it wants to you know there there's what they call boxing matches and different things and these people will trade licks and you know it can have so many different hits but the champion of that fight is is the one that that the champion of that fight might get hit but he's not defeated he's a champion and our Lord is a champion let me tell you you might take hits you might take you might take some licks from the old devil when he's trying to knock you down but he ain't got no Victory thanks be to God which gives a victory to our Lord Jesus Christ see we're Anchored In The Right Stuff Beyond the Veil we are anchored in the right stuff but you see I I'm going to but you know the reason listen I I mean I don't know how else to say this but I've been you know I'm almost 30 years old by the grace of God and you know I've been I've been serving the lord since I was 14 years old 15 145 right there was my birthday when I was coming from 14 to 15 and you know in that time I have seen things I have seen people that you thought uhuh would be there forever I seen people that I thought and knew I said man these people are better people than me and these people will be here until the Rapture [Applause] comes but those people and I'm not picking on anybody you understand that I love everybody and I want if there's any Mercy for anybody let mercy be given but there was people in my life that that I would look up so much to and and even even if I can say this and this is okay in in in in my early in the early times 14 15 16 years old I would begin to Anchor myself in people and and I would I would anchor I would anchor myself in a preacher and I would look up and and I would say man brother brother Steven's got it all together and I'd try to Anchor myself in [Music] [Applause] [Music] Steven I love you brother but if we're not careful you begin to try to Anchor yourself and well this is a nice church and and you throw out your anchor and and you'll begin to say well you know the spirit of God moves well here and that's fine you try to throw your anchor in a building or you try to throw your anchor in a personality and you know what I've noticed every man that ever lifts himself up or gets lifted up for the people are determined to fall and I seen people that you see the reason that people fall that you never thought would fall was because they were never anchored Beyond the Veil they threw out an anchor listen let me tell you something see I I don't know what what you're anchored in I believe you're Anchored In Christ but I I don't know what you're anchored in you know why there's a veil you can tell me you're made of stuff that don't Bluff and all that but but I don't know what you're anchored in and you know why it's because it's beyond a veil but listen if you're if you're in if you're in a boat this is all free I don't know where this is coming from but if you're in a boat and you're in 20t of water and you throw out an anchor 10t deep it's Beyond the Veil you see people throw Beyond the Veil they don't know where it's anchored in but they never went deep enough they never got deep enough to where that anchor could come in and grab a hold of something so you know what happened that boat never Stood Still That boat never stood in that place listen that boat could have stood there as long as the wind was calm and nothing was going on and everything was fine they could say blessed be the Lord long as their bills was paid they could say blessed be the Lord but then one day before they knew it they ran into Shore or they hit a big wave and they realized I wasn't anchored into anything see it was beyond the veil so we couldn't tell what they were anchored in but they never got deep enough but on the other side of that if you ever get get that anchor deep enough and you ever throw it down there into a rock can I call it the Rock of Ages Cliff for me and you get in there in that mountain let the wind blow let the storms rage people might look at you they might be sitting on the bank looking out there at that boat and say that boat will never make it through that storm but brother Brandon said you know when they let that anchors down it don't go over the wave it goes through the wave I'm just going to say it brother I got to be plain you know I've seen I I I've been involved in in in false Doctrine I I've I've been involved with with people that walked away that I never thought would walk away I've been hurt I've been talked about I've been mistreated I I've had so many people talk about me and Seth coffee in my flesh I have said many times brother I say I quit I have quit preaching more times than you can count I said I will never preach again I I'll never step behind that pull pit again I I ain't never doing that again as soon as I try to walk away if that's the way Isaiah's going to treat me well then we just ain't got no friend brother I'm sorry for how I felt about you I'm sorry for you see there's a anchor there that is greater than you when you realize that grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption brother brandham says anchored in the wrong things here he said a man or a woman just in philosophy or joining church or something like that you're not anchored yet you would take your letter from one Church to the other I mean to pick but we've seen that so many times from one place to another but if you take the real absolute Christ anchor yourself in that don't make any difference what comes or goes you're still anchored and what the Christian needs today in this atomic age in this time of in uncertainty you need something just besides an experience of joining Church you need an anchor an absolute that you know because churches will fail that's right yes sir I should get an amen on that churches will fail people will fail but Christ cannot fail he's the absolute to the believer and if Christ is your absolute you're tied to him and if he is your absolute you're tied to him then you're tied to the word what he say heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never you are a part of something that'll never pass [Applause] [Music] [Applause] away church it's anchor it's Anchor Church I just I haven't been through as much as some people but I've been through a lot and I was sitting there thinking this is my own words and and you know brother Steven always says just be at home that's it that's it right church I have gotten so many times where I thought I cannot go one more step but something keeps holding me does anybody else ever felt that way [Music] I've tried you know and and I'll come to God and fix my tide just right and I'll go I'm going to pray my way out of this hope this is all right I'm seing from my heart I'll come to a place where I say I'm going to do something about this I'm going to get myself out of this and I believe in taking the right steps towards God but if you ever feel like you can do it on your own you are in a bad place I'll get to a place where I say I can fix this I I can get my myself out of this and I'll come like a holy Pharisee I hope it's all right just to be honest I think church is a good place to be honest you you can you can stop trying to pretend to fool everybody we come to a place and oh Father holy God I don't mean this disrespectful but Oh Holy Father God you know all these different things and the relationship of me without him I'm nothing that's I have never preached one sermon I have never sung one song but everything that could ever be done was because of his grace in my life but I realize when I come to the end of myself that's and I go God I'm done I give up that's when God can use me when I get to a place where I say God I'm surrendering all this and all my righteousness is nothing but filthy rags brother brandom and I feel that tug but you see I can't see it but brother Brandon told a story about a kid flying a kite and he had a kite so high up in the sky you couldn't even see it and a man came [Applause] by and he said son what are you doing he said I'm flying a kite he said well I don't see no kite he said yeah I don't either but I feel it's pool and church all the times I've wanted to give up all the times I've wanted to give in I still I couldn't give in no matter how hard I tried to walk away or whatever it was I would feel a tug and something begin to pull me back in the right direction and before I know it my heart would begin to cry out and something on the inside a deep C of the deep would begin to happen and something on the inside would begin to come out of me and I'd say I know my redeemer liveth brother brandom says this and couple more things here and I'll close he said the hardest hour I ever struck in my life just give you a personal testimony he said I went into a room of my dying baby there I'd been a gospel preacher for about six years remember see doing the right thing not doing the wrong thing but doing the right thing about 6 years I stood there by my baby they wouldn't let me go in I didn't it didn't want me to go in but I slipped in and it was down in a basement in an isolated Ward and he said flies got in the little eyes of my baby and I shed the flies out and put a little net over it and I looked at the little thing and I said Sharon do you know your daddy and she suffered so hard to her little baby blue eyes had crossed my heart was gripped her mother was laying in the morg that night before I got down on my knees I said Heavenly Father what have I done to deserve this he said will you spare my baby oh blessed Lord please do and it looked like a black sheep come folding unfolding like that just shutter off from my view he absolutely refus to hear my prayer I stood up at her and I looked at her and I knew she was gone and he said Satan came to me and said will you serve him now which one of you which one of you in your human ability nobody there's your wife I'm hoping I'm getting something to you this anchor goes beyond you there's your wife there's your father just left your brother was killed up there on the road there's your wife in the mor oh yes you're a preacher he ought to be kind to you shouldn't he will you serve him he said that was the most cruestv and what had I done nothing as I know of I said God reveal it to me and I'll make it right but every son that cometh to God sir must be chastened and tried Hallelujah then all of a sudden I was left alone to make my decision I put my hand over her little head and I said Sherry honey the angels are coming to take you home Daddy will pack you your little body down yonder and lay it in the arms of Mama and I will bury you out yonder on the graveyard Hill but some glorious day daddy will see you again I raised my hands and I said Lord if you slay me yet I will trust you I love you and he said a great peace come over something sitting down over me this is another quote that I add to the bottom of that same thing he's talking about he said here's some time ago I'd lost my family and everything someone met me this is my testimony someone met me and said brother brandom did you keep your religion during that time really I said no brother it kept me said what do you think of Christ now there's your wife and your baby laying Yonder in that grave morning there's your daddy and your brother laying Yonder on a few days apart what do you think about him now I said he's more than life to me I love him with all that's with within me whatever you got your hopes built on the doctor said it's gone the medicine says it can't do nothing the surgery has failed but my hopes is not built in that we have our hope within the veil what Veil through the shedding of his blood that tore his Spirit from his body and in between the veil there the anchor is CAU a hold of something that wasn't a man that was God sir and don't you ever forget you look at that and you say well God's cruel no God does everything beautiful in his timing God allowed that man to go beyond the curtain of time and he was walking there and he seen a beautiful healthy 20-year-old girl there and he said how are you doing and he said I'm doing fine daddy cuz God makes everything beautiful in his time but you know what there's times when God says no [Applause] there's times when God says no you know one of the greatest experiences and one of the hardest Trials of my life is when God said no glory to [Applause] [Music] God and I you know we had uh I'm just going to preach from the heart here for a minute and you for you forgive me Hallelujah all right right and I remember uh you know we had little Jolie and then we had Lawson but in between Jolie and Lawson me and my wife my wife got pregnant we were so excited to have another baby and you know we just same routine you know you thank God for what he's done Lord we thank you that your blessing is with another child in this family and you have all these expectations and the things oh what the child going to be like what's this what's that you're sitting there with all these different expectations in your heart and we go to the doctor for our first ultrasound and I know this is early but if you ever I don't care early or late you ever lose one it does something to you and and and the doctor the the the technician begin to do that and when when she began to do that scan that ultrasound she said you could see that something wasn't right and she began to say well I can't find a heartbeat and you know the thing about it was I immediately began to have faith that everything was going to be all right you see just before that the week before brother Steven I had preached a sermon and I don't know if brother Isaiah remembers this or not but it was in the gym and I preached remember he's still the master of the wind and when I preach that sermon I I I I don't I I won't get the numbers exactly right but you just bear with me but when I preached that sermon there was probably 11 or 12 different people that came up for prayer and I watch the power of God God come down in that service brother Steven so strong I seen a family whose husband that that got out of church God restored that man back into that church just the next week went out and got him and brought him back I seen depression cast out I can say that every single person that came up for prayer that night when we laid hands on then and prayed for them whatever their situation was they got what they asked for and so I'm coming off of that sermon of that extreme faith that anointing of I know God is able he's still the master of the wind so we call everybody and we're we we Proclaim and testimony that we're going to have this baby and God's going to touch this baby yes and I feel in my heart I said oh God I just I know you I trust you and we went back for the ultrasound and they said we're sorry there's no heartbeat and that shook me so much because I can tell you I had the faith for it you don't have to believe me but I had the faith for it I believed it with all my heart but God said no and I was so tore up in my heart and I tried to go to church and my wife was so d all just tore all to pieces and and I went back to church and I tried to worship God but I I couldn't hardly worship God because there was something in my mind going why God why I'm being honest from my heart here tonight I said why God would you touch all these people and then my baby and I went through that and and I remember I probably went through three or four weeks of just crying my eyes out saying God why God why and my my buddy Malachi I'll never forget that first time back to church and I was crying my eyes out on the front row and he came up and gave me a hug like Jesus just coming up and you know what those are like and I was sitting there and I was so distraught and I I was sitting there going God why and there was such a part of me that just wanted to say as brother Brandon said well fast the way he's going to treat me I'm not comparing my situation to brother brandom's but understanding my own walk and you know I remember I went through that week after week after a week after week and I was crying and I was crying and I was asking God why why why then I said pastor I got to have a meeting with you and I began to tell them all that I said why did God allow all these people to get healed or touched or delivered and I came to him and I had faith that God was going to restore that child yes and yet he didn't answer and he said Seth I don't have the answers for stuff like that he said but I want to ask you one question do you believe God knows what what best this flesh this flesh scream wanted to scream out so bad if that's the way he's going to treat me no my spirit was so distraught that I just wanted to run out of there and say forget all this but thank God [Music] something on the inside of the inside when I wanted to quit when I wanted to say no when I wanted to walk away Something in My Heart screamed out yes I do that's the anchor I'm talking about when you come to your end and even when your flesh gives up and your spirit is overwhelmed deep down in that Soul there's an anchor Beyond the Veil church I say that as a word of encouragement am because no matter what we're going through yes my brother we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God who are the called according to his purpose let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord Jesus I I don't know why you laid this thought on my heart father but Lord I would I would be a hypocrite or Infidel whatever you would want to call me Lord to to not preach what you laid on my heart father I hope that some way or another Lord we've been able to express Lord that we have an anchor Lord an anchor Lord father the great thing about this anchor almighty God is Lord It's not that we're holding on to the Anchor but Lord the anchor has been holding on to us Lord through every wind that's blown Lord and father every Church split Lord everybody that's talked down about us Lord and Lord people that we never thought Lord God would would walk away hurt us Lord and the days and the nights we stayed up all night Lord thought we couldn't go any further but Lord The Anchor Holds Lord I'm living proof tonight Lord that The Anchor Holds father we're all living proof tonight that The Anchor Holds father had you not anchored us in your word Lord oh God where would we be tonight Lord had you not called us out by your grace Lord and anchored us Lord into your bleeding side father where would we be father with all the wind and all the waves that blow where would we be father all the times we said I want take another step but The Anchor Holds father and Lord we have that that anchor anchored in before the foundation of the world Lord and Lord we're going back to where we came from Lord we thank you Lord that you put that in our heart and Lord we thank you for the examples you put in the scriptures like job Lord and no matter what faces us we know Our Redeemer liveth we thank you you put Paul in there Lord that we know that death has no sting and Grave has no victory for we have an anchor thank you Lord for sending this message that we can anchor ourselves into it almighty God lord I shouldn't even say it that way but Lord you anchored us into it father Lord we thank you almighty God for all that you do for us Lord for we don't deserve you we don't deserve your mercy but you said you were the god rich in Mercy Lord I wish tonight I could get that across from my heart I don't deserve to be here Lord none of us do but you said all that the father hath given me will come to me and Lord you said that you would call us and when we would come to you Lord you wouldn't cast us out father but Lord you would anchor us to you father we thank you so much for this tonight Lord and I pray that something was said that would be a help to your children tonight Lord it came from my heart almighty God to your children Lord we love you we thank you we Praise You In Jesus Christ's name amen he said I read down here it said whosoever will let him come he said I cast that anchor Beyond something he said I couldn't see but he said something caught a hold and when the battles raging The Anchor Holds within the veil when the infidels rise and troubles rise all around gives way our anchor holds within the veil what is it I don't know but it's Beyond the Veil somewhere Yonder anchored into the Rock of Ages our anchor is steadfast unmovable it holds in within the veil which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast he said sure and steadfast oh if we had a little more time what to get what Assurance means something that you know what's Assurance God swore by an oath he' do it that's Assurance we have an assurance by an anchor of his word amen God bless each and every one of you tonight it was so good to be here we thank you for the time that you have given us to speak to you the word of God Amen do you bless you

amen ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high amen and that deity will manifest itself when you come to the point where you don't know what to do your flesh have already give up and that's when it started I gave an example here one time when there was a cord here amen do you have the cord with you but if you're too close to the cord you won't feel the effect of the cord you have to walk away from the cord yes sir trying your own ability when you stop it means it's the beginning of the power of the cord the cord start when you stop when your ability stops that's when deity kicks in amen amen his answers some sometimes is no the holy spirit will not not even let me touch it on Sunday and there was a reason why and he just spoke it again tonight you pray for me because I had a big fight on Sunday night and I knew the devil was very upset big big big big big big fight it was like demon all over and I remember brother Bram say when you go to a service and you cast out Devils he said brother Bram say when he goes to the hotel room all the devil that was that he was casting out chasing him over there to fight him I didn't even tell my wife anything she's now hearing it from there I was just quiet I was like okay I know exactly Satan something happened to you because there are channels that have been open that are releasing the pressure from the children of God they have been carrying so many burden amen especially that part where God says no that's the one that the devil uses the most to challenge your faith when God say yes the devil have nothing he knows you're going to Anchor something right there and he's going to build your faith it is when God says no why is he saying no what is behind that no you pray for me see you on Sunday Lord's willing Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight Lord father I didn't even tell the brother what was preaching here Lord it is the holy spirit that came down and speaking to your children going through many trials left and right praying praying certain things are working some seems like it's not working like Lord father they have been praying over it for years and it seems like it's not moving seems like it's a rock that some are saying maybe you know what it's something that we have to live with it but Lord you came and you spoke to us Lord that there is an anchor Beyond us that will anchor despite the opposition father you are there this thing is is not about us it's about you being in us it's about you being in in the picture Lord it is the battle between you and the devil and we just has been used Lord under this office Lord first you did it in Christ now you're doing it through the bread just as you pick job to demonstrate it to the devil that what you spoke was correct and what you spoke was the truth father in this same time you have chosen the bride to demonstrate to the devil one more time that there is a people that can stand on the face of the Earth and that will come up without spot or wrink or any such thing Lord father may your blood protect us may you be with us and keep us Center into your word Lord father the time are getting very treacherous things are getting tigh left and right because the hour of the third pole have come Lord father where we going to live by the word of God and we will see things that we never thought going to happen
