from the word mass for Christ some of you born in the message you don't know what it means a mass come from Catholic Catholicism what cath what what Catholic priests are doing they call that a mass and brother Bram say the highest form of spiritism is the Catholic Church brother Benjamin can you say amen amen ah brother Bram say the highest form highest form the highest form in other words the top top the lights here are not on brother Robert yeah the top the top level the number one level of spiritism brother the I'm say to the Catholic church and the word Christmas that you love to say Merry Christmas that vocabulary came from the Catholic Church don't say Amen Christ M which is what Christmas Christmas it is a Catholic tradition why do we want to hang out on something that came from the Catholic Church which is Jezebel [Applause] today oh glory to God don't worry my friend now Christmas I wish that really the people would could understand in this world what really Christmas is I know your quote Merry Christmas Merry Christmas brother I'm say Merry Christmas I'm giving you a different layer a different quot where the these they don't touch them they don't read this quote to the church they only they only use those quot that brother Bram say I wish everybody Merry Christmas that's the quat you will hear for 40 years these you won't hear them but in this church we eat everything there is no Cat that should embarrass you even where brother Bram lied we read it and we also read where we repented amen I cannot hide that because the Bible never he hide the mistake of Abraham no sir the Bible spoke where David messed up Amen in this church we everything amen amen are we together amen are we together amen he says now the first word Christmas is a kind of a Catholic expression it means christas Christmas Christmas it was ordained or was begin with the Roman church amen I thought somebody had say mosom deal with this easily yes and they don't celebrate Christmas Jehovah Witness deal with this easily and they don't celebrate Christmas only message believer those that know more than Mom and Jehovah Witness they the one struggling with it [Applause] lollipop and Christ was no more born on on on the 25th day of December than I was because he was born in April yes sir he said uh-huh it's just a complete conglomeration of what Dogma so Christmas is a Dogma Dogma you don't understand what it means I'm going to come back to that he said that is all there is to it the whole world as the prophet say has become a petrified sword that's right just it's just no clean thing where nowhere every holid day is backed up why Santa CLA took what Christmas Place the birth in the what manger the rabbit and chicken and new heart took what the resurrection and where does God appear in all the set the reason of this is because that man in a what commercial it become a commercial problem somebody's making money on your ignorance of worshiping the devil you say Dogma why is Dogma trouble in the Feist of the trumpet brother Bram say talking about the 200,000 demon brother Bram say while this group down here has got 2,000 bned at the river Euphrates he has been bned for 2,000 years also that church has bound the what Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit can be bound please don't say Amen to me say Amen to the courot they has burned the Holy Ghost for nearly how many years 2,000 years under mom back there and Under the Water Church ages it has been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of whated and what dogas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of a man-made what system so Dogma burned the Holy Spirit when you are clinging to a Dogma the spirit of the Lord is blocked amen amen he says but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that is what the Bible what say and my purpose here is to free you so you can remove the Dogma from the Catholic church that has been bounding the holy spirit in your life hard to chew my friend let me deal with your gift my friend why they start buying Christmas present month ago and what it is but a hidden trait is my English clear let me read it again my friend why they start buying what Christmas presents month ago and what it is is but a what a heathen train buying gift in Christmas time is a hidden threat amen amen Pagan trait means characteristic so you're not different than a pagan so if you want to give your children gift give them gift anytime on January give them gift February give them gift a give them don't wait for Christmas because you are celebrating the devil [Applause] can you say amen amen okay he says there is nothing about it what [Music] Godly buying gift during Christmas time there is nothing about that that is Godly this is what your Prophet say we believe the message we believe the let's believe this speak what the prophet say I'm speaking what the prophet say oh they try to say gift to the wise man that is just a noes for a devil's excuse do you see here clearly let me come this way on this side do you see clearly it's no exist for what the devil's excuse so you buying gift during Christmas time always this of the devil excuse you will never never see this quot R they don't want to read it because he would take the lollipop from the pastor from the preacher because the preacher themselves celebrate Christmas it say a sham to see preacher in this message putting even socks on head fireplace and they posted on WhatsApp socks of Christmas preachers doing that I'm not telling you story I saw that I have a lot of people S phone I saw that on WhatsApp [Applause] we are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ with a socks for Santa clo to come a night flying like a devil of Harry Potter and giving gifts like a devil like a wizard flying like a witches Oasis Of The Devil excuse [Applause] I'm doing my best my friend after all this treatment if you continue in this church with Christmas that is between you and [Applause] God technician do me a favor you you you you make a uh like a folder you take the one from the hter and all these three series and you put them together so when we get new church member we can just give them all four we say just listen to this and that's it but I'm not going to give it to you because you already heard it he says you want to give him something it is your what life to Christ don't give it don't give to one [Applause] another so please don't send me your gift on Christmas if you want to appreciate me as a pastor wait for another [Applause] time I already told you I will return to the sending and because I'm not going to worship the devil he said give it to him that is what he die for that is his purpose of what coming let me nail it with this my friend for you who have been

senses the five senses but by no mean was this five senses given to you this Beast to do what to guide you the Beast doesn't guide you they were given to you for what Earthly contact but they was giv you the what the six sense and the six sense it belongs only to who the Christian and you cannot have the six sense until you become what a Christian is the only way that you can ever have more than the five natural senses for the natural what person in other word this person is the realm of the sixcess amen hallelujah amen don't worry my friend some of them you will digest the home and the super say is what the Holy Spirit amen the super is what the Holy Spirit the what the faith of God the faith of who God the faith of who of God your faith the faith of who of God the faith of God the faith

disciple so God was there and God was there are we together have I lost you no sir brother problem says he says he says for it is far above oh my God he says and if you let the five senses be what yielded to the six sense he shall do what guide you in other word if you let the animal part of you be guided by The Godly part of you which is the Holy Spirit The Godly part of you will what will bring all God you and bring all other what five senses under control of what that super sense for it is far above the what the natural sense the Beast as the spiritual man is above the the natural it's as far as high as what the heavens is is above the what the natural man is what five senses he make you believe things that you cannot [Applause] see that man doesn't need your eyes he has eyes higher than your eyes when your eyes say I don't see nothing he says there is a big army around me Hallelujah Lord but it's only me and you Elijah El say there is more with us because the eyes of Elijah Elisha seeing something but Gaz is using the Beast the Beast sees the enemy but that man sees Godly Army that's why David say don't an Army in Camp around me I will be confident can I continue brother Bram say he make you believe things that what you cannot see he make you act why you do not think the five senses would have a what think about it the devil can get into the Beast the five

brother stepen that's right we trust you realize where we are and then that time is gone they doing the job as Deacon amen are we together amen send them away the running from responsibility the disciple are running from a responsibility in other way the longer you keep them here we will be liable H cut the sermon and in an intelligent way H good to have you today make your home safely so

when a problem come God send it to the partner I'm too busy right here you take care of them you don't see I'm preaching the gospel you take care of [Applause] them you them food do don't you think Jes Jesus knew there was no food he's God he knows everything then Jesus is telling his disciple give them food in the place where he knows there is no food in other words Jesus trusted more in the disciple than the disciple trusted in themselves I don't know if you get me Jesus knew that you can do it that's why he said the work that I do you can do it even greater how can you do something greater than the Holy Ghost because you are the Holy Ghost you are the third person of the Trinity you can do more my friend it is Bible it is Bible it is Bible the work that I do [Applause] amen the work that I do in this office in this office it will be greater so this office will do things bigger than this office but this is God in human flesh but God in human f is more poent [Applause] Hallelujah if God in a clean vessel can do certain things how about God in an unclean vessel the problem it's very easy to believe God in a vessel who never SE are we together he answered them he said them do what give you them to eat and they say to him the Beast yes amen amen shall we go and buy 200 penny worth of bread and give them to eat in other word we have $200 look at the convention right here we got $5,000 people in a convention you telling us with $200 to go back it looks like Jesus didn't know they have $200 but because they missed the opportunity God say you know what they are not awaken yet I thought I'm going to wake them up with this you know what pass me back the ball in other word Christ say get it but get it dun it and you are looking he said please bring bring the ball back bring the ball back here and Christ took it and went and D [Applause] are we together I have to go through that terminology so you soak that in jop to verse 49 God if you dare you can say amen Amen brother uh the Bible say now they finish the meeting Jesus look at them he say hey uh meet me down uh toward the south over there I will meet you over there do you stay with me no he said all of you can go they got into a boat they start going and Jesus stayed without a boat right I'm reading the Bible my friend without a boat and he was dismissing the people that's what the Bible say he begin to say God bless you see you tomorrow hey why are you waiting but Master how go to the other side I will come okay maybe there will be a late boat but it's too late the time is gone I don't see any other boat let's go me I'm already tired he said goodbye God bless you nice to see you oh we see you again okay send me a text message we stay in touch he exchang numbers with them and everything when Jesus finished there is no boat are we together are we together and Jesus didn't panic because the God in Jesus was guiding the Beast are we together then Jesus suddenly begin to head toward the water hey hey Hallelujah and suddenly he enter [Applause] water he begin to catch up on his text message because he had so many messages that came but he's walking on the water and when the disciples saw they say can I continue can I continue I don't think I'm going to preach what I wanted to preach can I continue verse 49 but when they saw him walking where upon the sea they suppos he had been what a spirit a ghost and they did what and cried out for they all saw who him and were how trouble and immediately he talk with them and said to them what be of good cheer it is who it is I what Be not Afraid watch carefully my friend and he went up to them into the sheep and the wind did what ceased and they were so amazed in themselves beyond measure and wonder verse 52 are you there with me for they consider not the miracle of what the L [Music] the miracle of the L God was already beginning to remove them from Humanity to begin to believe things that are bigger God is bringing them back to [Music] [Applause] Adam and God gave them the ball and they didn't do it and he demonstrated and dun it he said okay now that I D it they will understand and God moved to a different level but because they didn't catch the first level they missed the second one are we together are we together that is Mark 6 let's go to Mark 8 that's good God us his man as his partner am Mark 8 if you there you can say amen amen verse one in those days the multitude being how very great a great multitude remember multitude what it means you remember the definition and having nothing to eat I believe it was 2,000 or something having nothing to it Jesus called his disciple to him and said to them I have compassion on the multitude because they have been they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat if I send them away fasting to their own houses they will fent by the way for diverse of them came from far off Jesus knew they were hungry but instead of Jesus acting he now goes back to his partner that's right amen and begin to explain his partner his concern in other word Christ is looking for a solution from a human being amen amen Jesus didn't say I'm God I'm in charge when he look at the situation he say this is a big situation a disciple come here I have a problem this great multitude have been with me three days I don't know what to do and to send them they're living from far off some came from Florence some came from chareston what are we going to do and now the opportunity after month this is Mark and the disciple miss it again that's right my friend look at verse four and his disciple answer him from where the Beast again can a man satisfy this man with bread here where the first miracle happened where the second miracle happened where Jesus is the same y today and if it's a Wilderness A wilderness a same problem a same problem and the first problem he already showed you how to do it and the next one he bring you back again and give you again past the ball again because man is his partner what did man do he begin to reason again and Jesus say you know what give me the ball Jesus Took the ball and and dark it [Applause] again Hallelujah are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen jump to verse uh uh uh 15 I'm going to show you something I don't think I can preach what I want to preach let's go my friend I'm going to finish I have to stop with this one let's go verse 15 if you thereare you can say amen amen he says and he charged them saying take heed be aware of the leav as soon as he say leav in other words somebody say tomato automatically somebody's watching a hamburger moving as soon as he say Le to them bread he said and the 11 of the Pharisees and of the 11 of who her and the reason remember that person doesn't reason the one who reason is the Beast and the reason among them themselves saying it is because we have no bread to make it worse go back to verse 14 now the disciple has forgotten to take bread Jesus intentionally allowed them to forget again amen neither have they in the sheep with them more than what one Lo twice God multiply bread the third time they left bread they begin to murmur again we together amen verse 17 and when Jesus knew it he say to them why reason you because you have no bread perceive you not yet neither understand have you your heart have you your heart yet Harden like I said yesterday God was making this miracle to soften their heart because they were brought up under a beast so God need to break down the reasoning and begin to bring them toward verse six amen amen he says Verse 18 having eyes see you not and having ears hear you not and do you not remember now Jesus is remanding them when I br the Five Loaves verse 6 chapter 6 among 5,000 how many basket full of fragment took you up they say to him 12 second miracle and when the seven among 4,000 how many basket full of fragment took you up and they say seven time he reminded them of both and he said them and he said to them how is it that you do not understand so three times the partner of God are not understanding follow me my friend I'm going to take you to the airport I can't preach what I want to preach three times the partner of God are not catching the message that God want to associate them to his work amen are we together amen and Jesus knew their potential because Jesus said all that the father have given me he knew all of them were children of God he knew all of them came from eternity Jesus look he said I got a serious problem okay I'm going to pray for them let's go to John 10 thank you Lord now I'm going to solve this problem let's go to John 10 my friend yes sir thank if you dare you can say Amen am John 10 verse 30 y they got a problem what is the problem because the Holy Spirit the third person of the Trinity is man we okay now we okay now watch why it's true verse uh John 10 verse 30 you there I Jesus and my father we are what one the man Jesus and the fullness of the godhead badly I W in other word you cannot separate me from the father when you see me you see the father I'm going somewhere put your seat belt my friend amen when you see me you see the father amen when you see the father they just know it's me my friend I'm trying to help [Applause] you when you see Jesus the man you see who father you see God Jesus told them that from now on not only when you see me but even if you see the father call the father my name Hall [Applause] the Old Testament you are calling him Jehovah from today when you see the father you call him Jesus that's why when Paul met the Father the light the pillar of fire he asked the father who are you the father never say I'm Jehovah no he said I am who Jesus because the two are [Applause] one are we together are we together are we together I and my father we are in plain word Jesus is telling them me a man I am a God in human being follow me now my friend if you didn't hear me raise your hand Jesus is telling me you I mean he telling them you see me you see the men that you see here from today just know that you don't see a man the one that you see here is a God I am and my where was the father I and my father we are Jesus refuse for people to use distinction between him and the one that was inside that's right amen I don't know if you get that once the father is inside of him Jesus doesn't want you to call them two people when the father is in [Applause] you I don't know if you're getting once the father enter you you cannot say this is the father this is you Jesus said no no no no I and my father we are because the father only get where he is supposed to go God only inhabit [Applause] gods don't worry my friend you going to catch this home we clear verse 30 I and my father we are what one and then the Jews did took up stones again to Stone him because the Jews could not understand we got many Jews in the message I know when I'm preaching this thing they're going to take this sermon and send it continue sending it I got by the message and by the Bible and if you begin to T Stone to shoot no problem they did it for Jesus Christ they got upset of the revelation of God living in a man are we together are we together don't worry my friend he says verse uh 32 Jesus answered them many good works because this is what you like the miracle the healing and then I'm a great preacher many of those amen have I showed you from my father for for which of those work do you Stone me in other word the first the second pool all of them came out yeah why do you trying to Stone me that's right they say we don't Stone you for the miracle we love it it we love the healing campaign we love the prayer land but we have one thing we cannot stand you what is that one thing verse 33 the Jew answer him saying for good work we son you not for the first and second pool no problem because we are benefiting healing we Stone you not but for blasphemy what is the blasphemy and because you being what a man make yourself God the problem that the Jews have with Jesus is because Jesus claim that he was in human [Music] flesh Jesus claim that he was the second person in the Trinity they say he for miracle we understand but when you start this STP of teaching we will pull Stone we clear on that one we clear on that one we clear on that one let's go now in joh [Laughter] 17th ah YY stuff ah John 17 these people need to go give them food you miss it second time I'm looking at these people they've been three days what should we do for them they deci miss it the third time he begin even to talk about sidel they miss it again he said no problem I know why they missing it they have not understood how a man can be God do you for do you understand now Jesus is going to be praying and the prayer of Jesus are always ah you ready my friend are you ready my friend amen and we're going to see how those prayer was answered don't worry and I'm going to let you go home let's go to verse uh nine let's keep it quickly I pray for them this is Jesus why are you praying for them I pray for them I pray not for the world because not everybody in the world is predestinated that's I pray for them but for them which you have given me for they are yours remember Judas was no longer here correct Backle up my friend I'm going to the airport amen you today and all mine are what time and yours are what mine so Jesus understood that everything that belong to God is for him and everything that is for him is for God in other word it belongs to who because him and the father they are follow me my friend that's why Jesus said everything the father have it man and what I have is my father in other word me and my father we are the same person are we together he says and I am glorified where in them Jesus is glorified where in them follow me look at the boat Jesus is glorify where in them Jesus is not glorifying himself for him to be glorified he need to be glorified where in when Jesus entered somebody then he [Applause] be can I continue can I continue can I continue few amen can I continue amen jum to verse 20 my friend we just said the airport you there amen that was the prayer for the disciple brother Steven that was for the disciple why because he gave them three opportunity they miss it now Jesus begin to pray for them now listen to his prayer verse 20 neither pray I for this alone not only for the disciple because the same mistake the disciple are doing the oncoming spoken word will make the same mistake so let me pray for everybody at one time I don't know if you get me I don't know if you understanding me because the people the believe in spoken word will tell their pastor Pastor that prayer was only for the disciple so how can we apply that for us so Jesus say I know the folks in spoken words so let me pray for everybody for the disciple and for brother Micki even though brother Mick is not born yet but let me make sure his prayer is here so when brother Micky will come he will see when I pray for him you must believe my prayer and act according to my prayer are we together are we together are we together follow me my friend verse 20 he said neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall what believe on me believe on who me how many are here that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I see some hand not there if if your hand is not up you need to come to the altar if your hand is not up you need to come to the altar how many are here are beli hallah everybody's believer Jesus pray for [Applause] everybody are we together what was the purpose of his prayer what was the man thing he's praying for you are we together I pray for all of them that Shall Believe on on me through what their word 21 that they all all

he's talking about maybe one as thou you the who father are what in me ah Jesus knew that the problem is they don't understand God being a human [Applause] being are we together amen now I'm praying for one thing that all of them the same way me and my father are one I want so them to become one with the father this person is this person if this is God this is God this is Christ this is this is the Holy Ghost this must be the Holy Ghost the third person of the Trinity I don't know if we together now I don't know if we together now I pray that there may be one as you father are in me and I have in thee that they may also be what one in [Music] us that the world may believe that you did what has sent me so for the world to believe that Jesus was send from God you must become God you must become the Holy Spirit amen you must become the center when people have trouble they come to you you must become Duke power when people need electricity you say come get it get it get it get
