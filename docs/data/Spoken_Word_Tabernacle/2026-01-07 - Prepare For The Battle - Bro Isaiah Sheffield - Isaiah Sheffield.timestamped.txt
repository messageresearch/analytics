[0:00] THERE'S SCIENCES FAR advanced to ours.
[0:04] And just remember, he had to stand the
[0:08] reproach of the word that he preached
[0:12] 120 years in the face of scoffers.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Their great scientific
[0:22] uh WAYS PROVED TO them that there WAS NO
[0:25] RAIN IN THE SKIES.
[0:28] BUT YET NOAH HAD HEARD THE WORD OF THE
[0:33] LORD.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS CONTRARY TO THEIR conception
[0:39] of it.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; SO BEFORE HIS LIFE COULD BE SAVED,
[0:46] he must stand in THE FACE AND BEAR THE
[0:50] REPROACH
[0:54] &gt;&gt; THAT THESE SCOFFERS REPROACHED him by.
[0:58] Oh, there's no doubt. They must have
[1:01] felt sorry for the poor old preacher.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't have him putt away or
[1:05] anything because maybe there wasn't many
[1:07] houses of that type in that day. He was
[1:09] harmless. He wasn't going to hurt
[1:10] nobody. So, they just let him alone.
[1:14] Go ahead, you little fanatic up there on
[1:17] the side of that hill building a ship
[1:19] way out here where there's no water. Oh,
[1:22] poor old fella.
[1:24] AND SAYING, "WHERE YOU GOING TO GET YOUR
[1:25] WATER TO FLOAT YOUR BOAT, NOAH? IS
[1:27] COMING down out of the skies.
[1:30] NONSENSE. WE CAN SHOOT THE MOON AND THE
[1:33] STARS WITH RADAR, whatever they had.
[1:35] THERE'S NO RAIN UP THERE. BUT HE SAID
[1:38] GOD said he was going to put some up
[1:40] there.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; HOW IS HE GOING TO DO IT? THAT'S HIS
[1:44] BUSINESS.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Only thing I'm supposed TO DO IS WARN
[1:48] YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; It's just about the same now. THAT'S
[1:54] RIGHT.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE FIRE COMING FROM, BROTHER?

[36:32] &gt;&gt; I do have a quick testimony if that's
[36:33] okay, too.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, I gave a testimony I think in
[36:38] September that um, I owed about $8,000
[36:42] after my surgery and the Lord completely
[36:45] just wiped it clean from the hospital.
[36:48] Um, just a little update, I still owed
[36:51] about $700 to my anesthesiologist from
[36:54] the surgery and I applied for financial
[36:56] assistance for that as well and I'd
[36:58] already they'd already sent me to
[36:59] collections. So, I thought, well, it's
[37:01] too late to apply for financial
[37:03] assistance, but if the Lord took care of
[37:06] 8,000, like what's 700? So, uh, I
[37:09] applied for it late and I never it it
[37:12] took a few months and I hadn't heard
[37:14] back and I was still receiving
[37:15] collection notices. So, I just I just
[37:19] ignored them. Um, and I was talking to
[37:22] my sister-in-law about it yesterday
[37:24] because she owes money to her hospital
[37:26] from her birth. And I was telling her,
[37:28] you know, if the Lord for could forgive
[37:30] my 8,000, he can do it for you. And I'm
[37:32] still waiting for this 700, but I know
[37:34] he's going to take care of it. And I was
[37:36] at work today and I got a call and I
[37:38] missed it. And when I listened to the
[37:39] voicemail, it was from the
[37:41] anesthesiologist that they forgave the
[37:43] 700%. So I don't owe a single penny at
[37:47] all from my surgery. So that was 100% of
[37:50] my surgery debt.
[37:59] Glor. to come.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[38:17] is easy
[38:21] when you're up on the mountain
[38:26] and you've got peace of mind
[38:30] like you've never known.
[38:36] But things change
[38:40] when you're down in the valley.
[38:45] Don't lose faith.
[38:49] For you're never alone.
[38:54] For the God in the mountain
[38:59] is still God in the valley.
[39:03] When things go wrong,
[39:08] he'll make them right.
[39:12] And the God of the good times,
[39:17] he's still God in the bad times.
[39:21] And the God of the day
[39:26] is still God in the night.
[39:30] You talk of faith
[39:34] when you're up on the mountain.
[39:39] The talk comes so easy.
[39:44] life at his best.
[39:48] Now it's down in the valley
[39:53] of trials and temptations.
[39:57] That's where you'll face
[40:02] put to the test.
[40:06] God on the mountain
[40:10] is still God in the valley
[40:14] when things go wrong.
[40:18] Oh, he'll make them right.
[40:22] Oh, the God of the good times,
[40:27] he's still God in the bad times.
[40:32] The God of the dead
[40:35] is still God in you.
[40:38] Oh, for the God of the mountain
[40:44] is still God in the valleyies
[40:48] when things go wrong.
[40:52] Oh, he'll make them cry.
[40:57] God of the good times is still God in
[41:02] the bad times
[41:05] and the God of the days
[41:10] is still God in the night.
[41:13] Oh,
[41:14] if it had not been
[41:19] for the Lord on my side, tell me where
[41:25] would I be?
[41:29] Where would I be
[41:34] if it had not been for the Lord on my
[41:40] side? Tell me, where would I be?
[41:48] Where would I be?
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] If it had been the Lord on our side,
[42:01] where would I be?
[42:04] Amen and amen. Amen. Amen. So, we just
[42:09] want to take this song. Amen.
[42:11] And then invite brother Steven. Amen.
[42:14] Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; I believe God.
[42:19] Believe God.
[42:22] And shall be done.
[42:29] I believe God. Oh, I believe God
[42:48] ever
[42:56] shall be
[43:02] I believe I believe one more time.
[43:06] I believe
[43:08] I believe
[43:11] you and it shall be done.
[43:18] I believe I believe.
[43:25] If you believe it, give him a big clap
[43:27] offering.
[43:32] Praise
[43:34] God. Sister Lily, I thought the song was
[43:37] continuing and suddenly I'm like,
[43:42] &gt;&gt; keep moving.
[43:44] It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
[43:46] song. Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; The God of the mountain is not just the
[43:49] God of the mountain.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; He's also the God of the valley.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, there is no circumstance
[43:55] where God cannot reach. every
[43:58] circumstances whether it's bad tight
[44:01] whatever you call it God is specialized
[44:04] in every circumstances in your life amen
[44:07] we greet you all in the precious name of
[44:09] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both
[44:12] visible and invisible audience amen
[44:16] here God bless you I see sister Michaela
[44:21] she's right there Leah God bless you
[44:24] brother David and the blessing on the
[44:27] Hey, God bless you. Good to see you,
[44:29] Sister Mary, Big Brian, Sister Mayor, my
[44:33] friend right there. God bless you.
[44:35] Everybody, welcome. We don't have
[44:37] visitors. We got family member. Welcome
[44:39] to Spoken Word Tabernacle. Amen.
[44:43] So, feel free to shout, to cry, to jump,
[44:46] whatever the Holy Spirit want you to do,
[44:49] do it. You are home. I told brother
[44:51] Isaiah, I say this is your second home.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; So, feel at home. Glory. Glory to God.
[44:58] Everybody clear on the son of man.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; We clear now
[45:02] &gt;&gt; or somebody still uh
[45:06] uh under the effect of effect of the
[45:08] medication
[45:12] because I still have more to to give. So
[45:15] if you got the medication, we move on.
[45:17] If you still need more, there is a
[45:20] backup that is already in store. Amen.
[45:23] If you understand what we preach, you
[45:25] will understand the scripture. You will
[45:27] understand why Paul come to remove the
[45:29] Hebrew from the law. And Paul himself
[45:33] look at the Jews because they were
[45:34] Pharisee. They could not understand his
[45:36] move. When Timothy was converted, he
[45:39] took Timothy and circumcised him.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; You know it's in the Bible.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know? And the Bible say he did it
[45:46] because of the Jews.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Because according to them, you must be
[45:50] circumcised. And when the Jews brought
[45:52] that doctrine to the Galatian,
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Paul came and the Galatian want to
[45:58] circumcise themselves. Paul came. He
[46:00] say, "Who have be with you?"
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; The same prophet that went and
[46:08] circumcised somebody
[46:10] &gt;&gt; and we got even the certificate from the
[46:12] hospital.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; We got the proof we were there. We took
[46:15] some pictures to make sure everybody
[46:17] knows Paul circumcised somebody. He's
[46:20] telling the Galatian, he say, "Who have
[46:22] circumcised you?" I mean, who have
[46:23] bewitch you? In other words, trying to
[46:25] get circumcision, he's calling that a
[46:28] witchcraft.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; You need to understand the scripture
[46:34] very well. And Paul was a prophet
[46:37] &gt;&gt; and he was another son of man ministry.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He went to Jerusalem and he got
[46:43] into a vow and he he went and shaved
[46:46] himself. But what is going on with you?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; You say come out from the law.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Now you yourself going to shave
[46:54] yourself. If you follow him, you back in
[46:57] trouble.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus say offense must come.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[47:02] &gt;&gt; He say but wo
[47:06] &gt;&gt; the person that is going to bring the
[47:08] offense.
[47:11] It's uh sword that have that cut going
[47:16] and cut coming. Behold in Zion I lay a
[47:20] stone.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; The stone can either fall on you and
[47:24] crush you or you fall on the stone.
[47:29] All of that the same stone bring
[47:31] deliverance and the same stone take
[47:33] somebody to hell.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; So be careful when you're reading the
[47:38] Son of Man ministry. Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Pray God for revelation. That's why
[47:43] brother Brandham say I can never
[47:45] overemphasize
[47:47] the need of a revelation for the
[47:49] believer. When you read before you read
[47:51] the Bible, pray God you say, "Open the
[47:54] eyes of my heart." Lord, when I'm
[47:56] listening to the message, let me really
[47:58] catch the vision. Catch the revelation
[48:00] of what your prophet is really saying.
[48:03] And then you will begin to understand
[48:04] that, "Oh, now I see what the Lord is
[48:07] saying." Amen. Amen. It looks like the
[48:10] prayer on Tuesday is taking care of all
[48:13] the request.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; The prayer is wiping everything and we
[48:16] get to church, there's no more request
[48:18] because on Tuesday prayer, everything
[48:20] was clear. Sister Lily, you got a
[48:22] testimony coming. Everything is cleaning
[48:24] up. I was praying. Everybody who's in
[48:26] financial trouble in this church, you
[48:28] going to come out.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say amen. I will
[48:32] believe for you.
[48:35] Amen. Brother Brandham say it was the
[48:37] faith of Abraham that put the baby in
[48:39] Sarah. So even if you don't want to
[48:41] believe, I will believe for you. I will
[48:44] stand as a pastor and believe for you
[48:46] for God to free you completely so the
[48:49] children of God can be free. Amen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; And we want to hear some great testimony
[48:54] moving on in every aspect of our life.
[48:56] Amen. So welcome to our convention on
[48:59] Wednesday. It's our convention and we
[49:01] got brother Michael Sheffield. Finally,
[49:05] we caught him.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; He will be ministering for us. And if
[49:10] you look at him, this is a soldier. He
[49:12] got an injury on his foot. He's still
[49:14] wearing the stuff on the foot, but he's
[49:17] coming to preach with it. I said, "This
[49:19] is a soldier right there in the army.
[49:21] So, let's pull on the gift of the Lord."
[49:23] I told him, "He's home. He's going to
[49:25] preach like home." And let pull on the
[49:27] gift of the Lord. And we hear what the
[49:29] Holy Spirit will tell us tonight. Amen.
[49:31] Forever. Only believe. Holy
[49:38] believe.
[49:42] Oh
[49:45] believe.
[49:50] All things are possible.
[49:58] All
[50:01] living.
[50:17] Yes sir.
[50:20] All things.
[50:33] Let's sing it again to see
[50:43] all
[50:52] things
[50:53] are possible
[50:57] if we All
[51:01] be
[51:36] Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Is that your testimony this evening?
[51:39] Only believe, all things are possible.
[51:41] Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate the opportunity to be
[51:45] with you this evening. It's uh certainly
[51:47] a privilege and an honor and came down
[51:49] with brother Seth a few months ago and
[51:51] certainly enjoyed the service and
[51:53] enjoyed the fellowship and it's just
[51:54] good to good to be with you and uh I'll
[51:56] share just a quick testimony here with
[51:58] he mentioned my my foot. So about two
[52:01] months ago um I fell off a wall. while I
[52:04] was at work and I was working, I fell 14
[52:06] foot and hit the concrete and landed
[52:10] directly on my foot and fell to my side
[52:12] and dislocated my shoulder. And um by
[52:17] God's grace that that was that was all
[52:18] it was. And uh I I'm very very thankful
[52:22] in the in the time when it happened, I
[52:24] realized that that God was merciful and
[52:26] it could have been a lot worse. But as
[52:28] time has went on and hearing other
[52:30] people talking about falls and hearing
[52:33] hearing all kinds of stories, people
[52:35] have fallen a lot less distance and and
[52:38] fallen on dirt and got hurt a lot worse
[52:40] than I did. And so God was really really
[52:42] watching out for me. When I actually
[52:44] when I went to the hospital, they kept
[52:46] wanting to check my head. They kept
[52:47] thinking that they they I don't know how
[52:49] many times they asked me, "Are you sure
[52:50] you didn't hit your head?" You had to
[52:51] have hit your head just because fall
[52:54] from that distance. They thought, you
[52:55] know, surely I would have hit my head.
[52:57] And I didn't hit my head. Actually, the
[52:58] the trusses, it was trusses that fell
[53:01] and knocked me off a wall. And they
[53:03] actually got pinned up above me. And
[53:07] they stayed about six feet off the
[53:09] ground right where I hit the concrete or
[53:11] they would have fallen directly on me.
[53:13] So God was really merciful. And here in
[53:16] about two weeks, I'll come out of the
[53:18] boot. And Amen. Appreciate it. He's He's
[53:22] still watching over us even no matter
[53:24] what what we are, where we are, no
[53:26] matter what's going on, he's got his
[53:27] hand in our lives. So,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; if we will, let's let's bow our head
[53:31] this this evening.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come
[53:34] before you this evening, Lord. Just
[53:36] Lord, just wanting to thank you, Lord,
[53:37] for what an opportunity, Lord. What a
[53:39] privilege you've given us, Lord, that we
[53:41] could come together, Lord, on a on a
[53:42] Wednesday evening, Father, that you
[53:44] would you would put a a desire in each
[53:46] heart, Father, that that we would leave,
[53:48] Lord, the the busy lives, no doubt,
[53:50] Lord, the the different obligations we
[53:52] would have, but Father, you would draw
[53:54] us together, Lord, with saints of like,
[53:56] precious faith. Father, Lord, I don't
[53:57] believe that each one came to see one
[53:59] another. But, Lord, I believe that each
[54:01] person came this evening, Lord, with a
[54:03] desire, Lord, to hear from you. Lord,
[54:05] they came with a desire to pull up to
[54:07] the the communion table with you this
[54:09] evening and they would just begin to
[54:11] fellowship around your word, Father.
[54:13] Lord, I ask that you would just come
[54:14] down in this service, Father. Lord, as
[54:16] we've we've sung your psalms, Lord,
[54:18] we've invited you here, Lord. We've
[54:20] prepared an atmosphere, Lord. Lord, WE
[54:22] WANT YOU TO FEEL WELCOME AMONGST us this
[54:24] evening, Lord. You see each and every
[54:25] heart, Lord, you see each and every life
[54:27] that's in here, Lord. Lord, before the
[54:29] foundation of the world, Lord, I believe
[54:31] THAT YOU SAW THIS SERVICE, LORD. But I
[54:33] believe that you saw each person that
[54:35] would be sitting here, Lord. You saw the
[54:37] needs that WOULD BE ON THEIR LIFE,
[54:38] FATHER. You saw the battles they would
[54:40] be going through, LORD. LORD, NOT ONLY
[54:42] DID YOU SEE THE BATTLES THEY'RE going
[54:43] through, Lord, but you see the battles
[54:45] that are up in front of them, Lord. You
[54:46] see the battles they're going to face
[54:48] tomorrow when they walk into work, LORD.
[54:50] YOU SEE THE BATTLES AND HOW THE ENEMY IS
[54:52] GOING TO TRY TO ATTACK them at later
[54:53] this week or next week. And Lord, I'm
[54:56] just I believe, Lord, I'm simple enough
[54:57] to believe, Lord, that you could come
[54:59] down, Lord, through this service and you
[55:01] could begin to speak the things, Lord,
[55:03] that we would need to hear, Father, even
[55:05] when we don't know what we need to hear,
[55:07] Father. Even when we don't realize it,
[55:09] but Lord, YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED
[55:11] to hear, LORD. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT to
[55:12] do to prepare US FOR A LOT WHAT LAYS IN
[55:15] FRONT OF US. SO, FATHER, LORD, I just
[55:16] ask that you would take control of this
[55:18] service. Lord, would you move me out of
[55:20] the way, Father? Let me step aside that
[55:22] you can speak through me this evening.
[55:24] They didn't come to hear me, Lord. They
[55:26] came to hear you this evening. Father, I
[55:28] ask that you would just have all the
[55:29] preeminence, Lord, and receive all the
[55:31] glory and honor this evening, Lord. We
[55:33] give the service into your hands, Lord,
[55:35] asking that you would come down, Lord,
[55:36] and walk the aisles and speak to every
[55:39] heart. Father, we give it into your
[55:41] hands this evening. In Jesus name we
[55:44] pray. Amen and amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; If you will turn in your your Bibles to
[55:51] Ephesians 6.
[55:54] Just a real simple thought this evening,
[55:56] but
[55:57] &gt;&gt; I believe if
[55:58] &gt;&gt; you pull on the word sir
[56:00] &gt;&gt; and uh God will have his way this
[56:02] evening.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6
[56:06] &gt;&gt; and 10. If I take a title this evening,
[56:09] I'll say prepare for the battle.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Prepare for the battle.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 and 10.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Finally, my brethren,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; be strong in the Lord and in the power
[56:21] of his might.
[56:23] Put on the whole armor of God, that ye
[56:26] may be able to stand against the ws of
[56:28] the devil.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; For we wrestle not against flesh and
[56:32] blood, but against principalities, and
[56:34] against powers, and against the rulers
[56:36] of the darkness of this world, against
[56:38] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[56:41] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[56:43] of God, that ye may be able to withstand
[56:46] in the evil day, and having done all,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; to stand. Stand therefore, having your
[56:52] loins gird about with truth, and having
[56:55] on the breastplate of the righteousness,
[56:57] and and your feet shaw with the
[56:58] preparation of the gospel of peace,
[57:01] above all, taking the shield of faith,
[57:03] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[57:06] the fiery darts of the wicked, and take
[57:08] the helmet of salvation, and the sword
[57:10] of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to the
[57:15] reading of the word. You can have your
[57:16] seats this evening.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a what a powerful section of
[57:21] scripture here that's been given to us.
[57:22] And as I I begin to approach this s
[57:25] thought on preparing for the battle or
[57:27] prepare for the battle, we recognize
[57:29] that in our daily walk that that every
[57:31] day we we walk into a battle that that
[57:33] this life is not a flowery bed of ease.
[57:36] It's not it's not just laid out in front
[57:38] of us. You know, you know that brother
[57:40] Brandham said, you know, God didn't just
[57:41] push us through one end of a tube and
[57:43] push us out the other end. No, but
[57:44] there's there's a preparation that has
[57:46] to take place. There's a there's a
[57:47] battle that we're going to face every
[57:49] day. And and some days it's small
[57:50] battles, some days it's large battles,
[57:52] but we recognize that you're either in
[57:54] the midst of a trial. You're coming out
[57:56] of a trial or you're on your way back
[57:57] into a trial. So, we recognize though
[57:59] that that although the enemy, it seems,
[58:01] is getting greater and and the battles
[58:03] are getting stronger and the darkness of
[58:05] the world is closing in, but yet God has
[58:07] given us a provision. God has given us a
[58:10] way that we can pre be prepared for the
[58:12] battle that's laying out in front of us.
[58:15] I I love how the scripture begins there.
[58:16] He's saying, "Be strong in the Lord and
[58:18] in the power of his might." So, we can
[58:20] see the Bible is starting off by saying,
[58:22] "Look, it's not your might. It's not
[58:23] your ability. It's not what you can do,
[58:25] but be strong IN THE POWER OF THE LORD
[58:27] because it's his might. It's look, it's
[58:29] God that is going to see us through the
[58:31] battle. It's God that started the work.
[58:33] He's going to finish the work."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And put on a whole armor of God that
[58:37] you'll be able to stand against the ws
[58:39] of the devil. For we wrestle not against
[58:41] flesh and blood.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[58:46] So look, this this evening, we recognize
[58:48] the devil is going to try to get you to
[58:50] look at your brother and look at your
[58:52] sister and say they're the problem and
[58:54] they're your there's what's causing the
[58:55] issues. But we see the Bible said, look,
[58:57] it's not flesh and blood. It's not your
[58:59] brother. It's not your sister. But it's
[59:01] look, it's principalities. It's powers,
[59:03] the rulers of the darkness. It's
[59:05] spiritual wickedness. So we recognize
[59:07] that we can identify everything. It's
[59:09] just a demon. It's just a spirit. Look,
[59:12] it it could be a spirit. spirit's got on
[59:13] somebody, but it's not the person. You
[59:15] You GOT TO BE CAREFUL. LOOK, IF SOMEONE
[59:17] IF someone if the devil's trying to
[59:19] point you to someone and the devil's
[59:21] trying to trying to get you to think
[59:23] negative, look, what you need to do is
[59:24] you just build build them up in prayer.
[59:26] LOOK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT.
[59:28] YOU MAY not have to understand why
[59:30] they're doing what they're doing, BUT
[59:31] YOU SAY, "GOD, you're in control. I'm
[59:33] not going to LET THE DEVIL UH CHANGE MY
[59:35] THOUGHT of this person. I'm not going to
[59:37] let the I'm not going to sit here and
[59:38] spread rumors. I'm not going to sit here
[59:40] and spread negative. I'm just going TO
[59:42] GO TO MY PRAYER closet and I'm going to
[59:44] say, Lord, you know what they're going
[59:45] through. You know what they're doing
[59:47] with move in their life.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Where take on the whole armor of God
[59:52] that you may be able to withstand in the
[59:54] evil day.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And having done all to stand therefore
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; so we recognize that look, the day is
[1:00:02] evil, but we're going to be able to
[1:00:04] stand.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; The day is dark, but we're going to be
[1:00:07] able to stand. Stand therefore having a
[1:00:10] loin skirt about with truth and having a
[1:00:12] breastplate of righteousness,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; feet shaw with the preparation of the
[1:00:16] gospel of peace,
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; taking a shield of faith where we
[1:00:19] wherewith you'll be able to quench all
[1:00:21] the fiery darts of the wicked and take a
[1:00:23] helmet of salvation and a sword of the
[1:00:25] spirit which is the word of God.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; So he's laying out these preparations we
[1:00:31] can make.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Let me pick up this quote right here.
[1:00:33] Brother Brandham said here some time ago
[1:00:35] in the army when our nation first
[1:00:37] provided a helmet. Oh my, that little
[1:00:39] rookie didn't want to wear that. It
[1:00:40] seemed unnecessary. But when he got in a
[1:00:43] battle, he needed it.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; God don't provide anything.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Unless he has a need of it. Everything
[1:00:50] he provides for you, you better take it
[1:00:53] cuz you're going to have a need for it.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:00:57] a little rookie with a 90 lb pack on his
[1:00:59] back in training. He's got a new suit
[1:01:01] on. You know, he don't see any
[1:01:02] necessary. And packing that 90 lb pack
[1:01:05] and all these picks and shovels and hand
[1:01:07] grenades and everything else, but let
[1:01:08] him get into battle one time and he'll
[1:01:10] recognize he'll see and he'll come to
[1:01:12] it. That's right. You see this little
[1:01:14] this little person maybe is in basic
[1:01:16] training here and and they begin to give
[1:01:19] him supplies. They begin to give him the
[1:01:20] equipment that he needs. And maybe this
[1:01:22] this little guy is sitting there
[1:01:24] thinking, "Hey, I can't carry this pack.
[1:01:26] It's too heavy for me. I DON'T NEED ALL
[1:01:28] THIS ANYWAY. What's the What's the need
[1:01:30] IN ALL THIS BODY armor and this big pack
[1:01:32] I'm carrying and all these provisions?
[1:01:34] And he's sitting there thinking, he's
[1:01:35] never been in battle. HE'S SAYING, "HEY,
[1:01:37] I DON'T I don't have a need for this.
[1:01:39] Why Why don't I just leave this here?"
[1:01:40] BUT YOU KNOW WHY THAT PACK IS MADE THAT
[1:01:42] WAY? CUZ there's been someone that went
[1:01:44] before him and has BEEN IN BATTLE.
[1:01:46] THERE'S BEEN SOMEONE THAT'S been stuck
[1:01:48] IN A TRENCH SOMEWHERE AND BULLETS FLYING
[1:01:50] OVER THEIR HEAD and they've been in the
[1:01:51] midst of the battle and they begin to
[1:01:53] recognize that we need this and we need
[1:01:56] that. And they prepared a an OUTFIT JUST
[1:01:59] RIGHT. THEY PREPARED A HELMET JUST
[1:02:01] RIGHT. THEY PUT A PREPARATION together
[1:02:03] and gave THEM A PACK AND SAID, "YOU KNOW
[1:02:05] WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS PICK.
[1:02:07] You're going to need this shovel. You're
[1:02:08] going to need these extra bullets.
[1:02:10] You're going to need this body armor."
[1:02:11] Why? BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE BATTLE
[1:02:13] BEFORE. And look, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S
[1:02:15] SAYING, "LOOK, GOD DON'T GIVE YOU
[1:02:16] nothing
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; unless you're going to need it."
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; So God right here has given us
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; an armor to put on.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; You know what? If he gave us an armor,
[1:02:27] you know what that means? We're going to
[1:02:28] fight in a battle.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; If he gave you an armor, that means it's
[1:02:31] going to get hot sometimes. If he gave
[1:02:33] you armor, that means you're going to
[1:02:35] face the enemy sometimes. You're you're
[1:02:37] going to be in the midst of a battle
[1:02:39] sometime.
[1:02:42] It's not going to be perfectly easy.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Brother said that's why the all- wise
[1:02:50] God equipped his army with the baptism
[1:02:53] of the Holy Ghost. He know these
[1:02:54] intellectual giants would stand in the
[1:02:56] last days. He know they'd stand and
[1:02:58] they'd try to explain by their great
[1:03:00] wisdom powers of Satan.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; They're like a roaring lion devouring
[1:03:04] what he will. So look, brother R said
[1:03:06] he's given the Holy Ghost
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; as your preparation. Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Why? The Holy Ghost in you will be able
[1:03:12] to discern sir
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; the spirits. It'll be able to discern
[1:03:15] the enemy. It'll be able to discern.
[1:03:17] Look, even when it was so close, it
[1:03:18] would deceive the very life if it were
[1:03:20] possible.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; If it were possible, BUT IT'S NOT
[1:03:23] POSSIBLE this evening.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; But he gave you an armor
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; because there's a battle that lays
[1:03:29] before us.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; But he also gave us a sword.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; He gave us a sword. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
[1:03:36] MEANS? That we're not just going to be
[1:03:37] on the defense every day. We're not just
[1:03:39] going to be backed INTO A CORNER
[1:03:40] SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T I I
[1:03:43] DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD INTENDED US TO BE
[1:03:45] BACKED INTO A CORNER SOMEWHERE WITH OUR
[1:03:47] BACK UP AGAINST A WALL AND THE ENEMY
[1:03:49] JUST ATTACKING AND ATTACKING. BUT HE
[1:03:51] GAVE US A SWORD THAT WE COULD FIGHT. HE
[1:03:53] GAVE US A SWORD THAT WE COULD RUN AT THE
[1:03:55] ENEMY AND SAY NO.
[1:03:58] He gave us a sword. HE'S GIVEN US A
[1:04:01] WEAPON. WHY? BECAUSE HE WANTS US TO GO
[1:04:03] ON THE OFFENSE. You know what? YOU KNOW
[1:04:06] WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE JUST ON THE
[1:04:08] DEFENSE ALL THE TIME? YOU'RE SLOWLY
[1:04:10] losing ground. You may not realize it.
[1:04:13] You may not recognize IT, BUT YOU'RE
[1:04:15] SLOWLY BACKING UP. AND YOU KNOW WHAT the
[1:04:17] devil is doing? I'm afraid THAT A LOT OF
[1:04:19] TIMES THE DEVIL HAS BACKED US OFF OF THE
[1:04:22] PROMISE OF GOD. HE'S BACKED US AWAY FROM
[1:04:24] OUR VICTORY. He's backed us away from
[1:04:26] our healing. He's backed us away FROM
[1:04:28] OUR FREEDOM. I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE
[1:04:30] TAKE THE SWORD THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN
[1:04:32] US AND CUT BACK the enemy. LET'S TAKE
[1:04:35] BACK OUR FREEDOM. LET'S TAKE BACK OUR
[1:04:38] HEALING. LET'S TAKE BACK OUR JOY. LOOK,
[1:04:40] YOU'RE NOT MADE TO BE A DEFEATED PERSON.
[1:04:43] YOU'RE not made to be beat down and
[1:04:45] BACKED IN A CORNER. GOD SAID YOU ARE
[1:04:46] MORE THAN AN OVERCOMER.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; More than an overcomer.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Step into it this evening.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; We're not to be on the defense the whole
[1:04:59] time.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Take the word.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Drive him out.
[1:05:04] pick up the sword of the spirit,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; which is the word,
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; and begin to drive him out.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; We see Jesus
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; when he was in the desert being tempted.
[1:05:20] We see that he he went into the desert
[1:05:23] to be trained. He went into the desert
[1:05:25] to to fast. And he's here in the desert.
[1:05:28] The Bible said he was led by the spirit.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. Why? There was some
[1:05:33] training that needs to take place.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit into a dry
[1:05:38] place.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He was led by the spirit UNTIL A A DRY
[1:05:42] PLACE. AND THE BIBLE SAID he hungered.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; You know what? HE GOT TO A POINT WHERE
[1:05:46] HE was weak in his flesh.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible said after 40 days, he
[1:05:51] hungered.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Then the devil showed up.
[1:05:56] after he was there for 40 days, after he
[1:05:58] was hungry, after he was tired, after he
[1:06:01] was weak in his flesh, then the devil
[1:06:02] showed up.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hey, the devil is not afraid to attack
[1:06:06] you when you're at your weakest. The
[1:06:07] devil IS NOT AFRAID TO HIT YOU WHEN
[1:06:10] YOU'RE YOUR LOWEST. THE DEVIL IS NOT
[1:06:11] AFRAID TO KEEP HOW MANY'S EVER HAD A bad
[1:06:14] day where it seemed like nothing was
[1:06:15] going right?
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Where it seems like if one thing goes
[1:06:18] wrong, everything goes wrong. Hey, I've
[1:06:20] had days every seems like everything I
[1:06:22] touch breaks. Seems like everything I
[1:06:24] try to accomplish goes backward. I try
[1:06:26] to fix something, break something else.
[1:06:28] It just seems like it's JUST NOT MY DAY.
[1:06:30] WHY? IT JUST PILES ON. BUT THAT'S HOW
[1:06:32] THE DEVIL DOES. YOU'LL GET LOW
[1:06:33] SPIRITUALLY. You'll start to be in a
[1:06:35] desert place spiritually. And that's
[1:06:37] when the devil shows up. And that's when
[1:06:39] he starts to try TO FIGHT THE STRONGEST
[1:06:41] BATTLE.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid to show up
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; when it's your weakest.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; You know, devil's had a lot of time
[1:06:51] learning the right buttons to push. The
[1:06:53] devil's had had a long time
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; knowing exactly
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; how to upset. You know, it's not the
[1:06:59] same for everybody.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Some things might upset me more than
[1:07:03] they will upset you.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Some things may upset you more than me.
[1:07:06] But the devil knows exactly how to go
[1:07:09] down. HE, YOU KNOW WHAT? He could be
[1:07:11] having the best day
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden, boom,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; the devil steps right. He said, "I'm not
[1:07:17] going to let this
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let not going to let this
[1:07:19] happen. I'm not going to let this go.
[1:07:21] Hey, you you leave a good meeting.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You ever walked out of a good meeting
[1:07:26] and you're in there and the word's
[1:07:27] coming forth and you just feel like
[1:07:29] you're on top of a mountain and you're
[1:07:30] sitting there, it seems like you're
[1:07:32] looking for a devil to fight CUZ YOU YOU
[1:07:34] JUST sit there say there ain't no devil
[1:07:35] that's going to stand in my way. You're
[1:07:37] you're coming out of his meeting and you
[1:07:39] walk out and you let that Monday morning
[1:07:40] at work.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH THE DEVIL'S RIGHT THERE. HE
[1:07:44] SAID, "OH NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET HIM
[1:07:46] STAY UP HERE. WE'RE NOT. HE'S RIGHT
[1:07:47] THERE TO FIGHT.
[1:07:51] But God has given us an armor
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; to stand against it.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "We're taught in
[1:08:00] James 4:7 to resist the devil.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; He won't just walk away, but he'll
[1:08:05] flee."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil. How do you resist the
[1:08:09] devil? The same way our chief captain
[1:08:12] told us to do. Take the word of God.
[1:08:14] That's how you resist the devil. It's by
[1:08:16] the WORD OF GOD. THE CHIEF CAPTAIN TOLD
[1:08:18] US JUST HOW IT WAS DONE. SO, we see
[1:08:20] Jesus when he's in the desert. When he's
[1:08:22] there, he's being tempted and Satan
[1:08:24] comes at him and he's trying he's trying
[1:08:26] to tempt him. He's trying to to to do
[1:08:28] what he can to to GET HIM TO FALL THERE.
[1:08:31] But what DOES JESUS DO? HE STARTS TO
[1:08:33] RESPOND with the word. He begins to go
[1:08:36] in the word and say, "It is written."
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And the devil said, "Well, that one
[1:08:39] didn't work. Let me try this other one."
[1:08:41] Comes over here and says, "Well, how
[1:08:42] about this?" And Jesus says, "It is
[1:08:44] written."
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The devil said, "Well, that didn't work
[1:08:46] either. let me come over here and try
[1:08:47] this. AND JESUS RESPONDS, IT IS WRITTEN.
[1:08:50] YOU KNOW WHAT? JESUS could have just
[1:08:51] cast him away. He could have sent him
[1:08:53] away and said, "Quit bothering me." But
[1:08:55] you know what? He was so mindful of us
[1:08:57] in OUR DAILY WALK. HE KNEW THAT SOMEDAY
[1:08:59] in 2026, it was going to be dark and the
[1:09:02] enemy was going to BE FIGHTING AND SATAN
[1:09:04] WAS GOING TO BE RIGHT THERE. HE was
[1:09:06] going to come at you with this. But you
[1:09:07] know what you would have? You would have
[1:09:09] a word that had been given, a sword to
[1:09:11] cut against the devil. And you COULD SIT
[1:09:13] THERE JUST LIKE JESUS DID AND YOU COULD
[1:09:15] SAY, "IT IS WRITTEN."
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD RESPOND THE SAME WAY JESUS DID
[1:09:21] AND SAY, "IT is written, no, Satan. It
[1:09:23] is written that I'm going to be
[1:09:25] victorious. It is written I'm going to
[1:09:26] be an overcomer. It is written that I
[1:09:28] DON'T HAVE TO WALK this defeated way."
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Said, "It's written."
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; He responded with the word.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You know, like I said,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Satan knows
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; he's been around a long time
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; learning
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; how to attack.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And as long as you try to fight the
[1:09:54] enemy on your own, you're going to lose
[1:09:56] every time.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; As long as you try to fight the enemy
[1:09:59] with your ability and what you know and
[1:10:01] what you can do, you're going to lose
[1:10:03] time and time and time again. But as
[1:10:06] soon as you take this word
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; and you BEGIN TO PULL THAT SWORD OUT OF
[1:10:10] A SHEATH and you begin to say it is
[1:10:12] written,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Satan don't know what to do then.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He don't know what to do then.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said so.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; The infinite God
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; going to choose for his army
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; the best weapon that could be given. He
[1:10:28] chose it.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; It was his word. God gave his army the
[1:10:32] best equipment that it could ever use.
[1:10:35] He could would never have to be changed.
[1:10:37] He has never changed it. You don't
[1:10:39] improve it. It remains the same all the
[1:10:42] time. It is God's word that he fortified
[1:10:44] his people with. You know what brother
[1:10:46] Ram's talking about there? If you you go
[1:10:48] back and READ THE CONTEXT, HE'S TALKING
[1:10:49] ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT NATIONS WOULD WOULD
[1:10:51] TRY TO CONSTANTLY improve their their
[1:10:53] army and their military and their
[1:10:55] weaponry. Why? Because each person each
[1:10:57] nation is trying to get an advantage
[1:10:59] over the other nation. Each each time as
[1:11:02] time has gone on, it's been a constant
[1:11:04] arms race with weaponry getting stronger
[1:11:07] and weaponry getting greater and and
[1:11:09] countries are constantly developing
[1:11:11] greater weapons. Why? BECAUSE THEY WANT
[1:11:13] AN ADVANTAGE. They want an edge.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; And so as soon as a weapon comes out,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; it's normally a very short time until
[1:11:23] it's obsolete.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT SOMETHING
[1:11:26] BETTER. SOMEBODY DEVELOPED something
[1:11:28] better. So then they have to go BACK AND
[1:11:29] THEY GOT TO START OVER AGAIN AND THEY
[1:11:31] GOT TO try to find something stronger.
[1:11:33] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD BEING INFINITE in
[1:11:35] the infinite wisdom knowing from the end
[1:11:37] from the beginning. He looked DOWN AND
[1:11:39] SAID, "LOOK, MY PEOPLE NEED A WEAPON. MY
[1:11:41] CHILDREN NEED A WEAPON. AND YOU KNOW
[1:11:43] WHAT? GOD CREATED the greatest weapon
[1:11:46] that he could ever give you. It'll never
[1:11:48] be outmatched. IT'LL BE NEVER BE
[1:11:50] OVERPOWERED." Look there, Satan is not
[1:11:52] going to develop a greater weapon. WHY?
[1:11:55] BECAUSE GOD IS INFINITE. He knew the
[1:11:57] greatest tactic that the enemy would
[1:11:59] ever get. He knew the LARGEST TACTIC
[1:12:01] THAT SATAN WOULD EVER DEVELOP.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But he said, "It is written.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Pick the word up and begin to cut away
[1:12:10] the enemy."
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; LOOK, THERE THERE'S NO WEAPON POWERFUL
[1:12:13] ENOUGH.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; There's no weapon strong enough.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Said he gave his army the best equipment
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; it could ever use.
[1:12:26] Romans 8:31.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; What shall we then say to these things?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; If God be for us,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; who can be against us?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; If God be for us this evening, who can
[1:12:37] be against us? Why do we get so
[1:12:39] concerned so many times when the
[1:12:41] battle's hot and it's dark around us?
[1:12:43] LOOK, GOD'S ON OUR SIDE THIS EVENING.
[1:12:45] GOD'S FIGHTING WITH us this evening. God
[1:12:48] is the one that's fighting the battle
[1:12:50] for us.
[1:12:52] Yes,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; but God has given us a supernatural
[1:12:56] armor
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; for a supernatural battle.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Brother here, he said, "Love, joy,
[1:13:01] peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:13:02] meekness, patience, faith, Holy Spirit,
[1:13:05] all these things are supernatural." What
[1:13:07] is love? What is joy? What is faith? Go
[1:13:09] down to the drugstore and buy a
[1:13:11] quarter's worth of it.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. Why? It's a spiritual
[1:13:15] battle, but it's a spiritual provision
[1:13:17] that has been given that no matter how
[1:13:19] dark it gets, NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS,
[1:13:22] NO MATTER HOW TOUGH THE BATTLE IS, WHAT
[1:13:24] THERE'S A SPIRITUAL PROVISION given to
[1:13:26] you that that armor can go on and it'll
[1:13:28] stand against anything
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; the devil throws at him.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; You see, it's it's been said throughout
[1:13:37] history,
[1:13:38] in a time of peace
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; is when you prepare for war.
[1:13:43] In a time of peace is actually when you
[1:13:45] prepare for war.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; You might come to the point in your life
[1:13:48] where you're up on a mountaintop.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Everything seems like it's going great.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; There's money in the bank. There's a
[1:13:55] great family. There's a great job. You
[1:13:57] got everything just seems like it's
[1:13:58] going right.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You better start preparing.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You better start laying up.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; You better start making sure
[1:14:05] everything's put together. You better
[1:14:07] make sure you're in the word. Why? Cuz
[1:14:09] Satan's not going to let that last.
[1:14:11] Satan is not going to let that last.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham here, I love this. He
[1:14:15] said, he's beginning a prayer and he
[1:14:17] says, "And may we buckle up
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; the armor of GOD JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER
[1:14:22] TONIGHT. Go forward in battle tomorrow,
[1:14:25] knowing where right and wrong is
[1:14:26] engaged.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; May we not fear as we go, BUT MAY THE
[1:14:30] MORNING STAR SHINING over us,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; and if God be for us, who shall be
[1:14:34] against us?"
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "May we buckle up
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; the ARMOR OF GOD. MAY WE BUCKLE UP A
[1:14:41] LITTLE TIGHTER. You know what? We may
[1:14:42] find ourselves sometimes just getting a
[1:14:44] little lacadasical. Why? Because we're
[1:14:46] just going through the motions and and
[1:14:48] and life has got busy and and lay out of
[1:14:51] begins to creep its way in and you just
[1:14:53] begin to get a little lax. I say THIS
[1:14:54] EVENING, LORD, HELP ME BUCKLE UP THE
[1:14:56] ARMOR a little tighter this evening. May
[1:14:58] I go through my life and begin to
[1:15:00] examine myself? Let me make sure I've
[1:15:03] GOT THE HELMET ON. MAY I MAKE SURE MY
[1:15:05] BREASTPLATE IS ON. MAY I MAKE SURE I'VE
[1:15:07] GOT MY SHIELD IN FRONT OF ME. MAY I MAKE
[1:15:09] SURE MY SWORD IS SHARPENED UP.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; WHY? Buckle up a little tired. He said,
[1:15:15] "Buckle up
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; that you may go face the battle tomorrow
[1:15:20] and not fear." Why? Because you know
[1:15:22] you've went through and examined your
[1:15:24] life. You went through and examine the
[1:15:26] armor. AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALL BUCKLED
[1:15:28] DOWN TIGHT AND YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM THE
[1:15:30] TOP OF YOUR HEAD TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR
[1:15:32] FEET. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE BUCKLED IT
[1:15:34] TIGHTER. YOU'VE TAKEN THE ARMOR THAT GOD
[1:15:36] HAS PROVIDED.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And put it on.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Let's check ourselves.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; You got to constantly inspect
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; your weapon and your armor.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You know, if you're not diligent,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; the sword will get dull.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; It'll begin to get dull.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; You'll begin to get laxed.
[1:15:59] You know, if you take a weapon,
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; if you take a firearm,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and if you don't clean that thing
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; and you keep shooting and shooting and
[1:16:07] shooting, it just gets dirtier and
[1:16:09] dirtier
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and one day it's just not going to go
[1:16:12] off.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; I like to shoot black powder muzzle
[1:16:16] loaders.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You put a powder pellet or black powder
[1:16:20] in there
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; and you got to clean that gun every few
[1:16:23] shots.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's a breach plug on the
[1:16:25] back and you got a cap. And when you
[1:16:27] strike the cap, a spark goes through the
[1:16:29] breach plug and ignites the powder.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; But if you're not careful, when you
[1:16:34] begin to shoot that gun over and over
[1:16:36] and over, it the the actual the it'll
[1:16:39] begin to foul up the brereech plug and
[1:16:42] one day you pull that trigger and the
[1:16:44] cap goes off and the powder DOES NOT
[1:16:47] IGNITE. WHY? BECAUSE THE BREREECH PLUG
[1:16:48] HAS BEEN SHUT OFF. IT'S BEEN FILLED UP
[1:16:51] WITH CORROSION. IT'S BEEN FILLED UP WITH
[1:16:53] THE POWDER, THE SPENT POWDER. I SAY THIS
[1:16:56] EVENING, we got to begin to take apart
[1:16:57] our weapons. This evening, WE GOT TO
[1:16:59] TAKE APART OUR LIVES. WE GOT TO TAKE
[1:17:01] LOOK ON THAT GUN. You actually take the
[1:17:03] breach plug out. You unscrew it and you
[1:17:05] clean it. I say we need to go down in
[1:17:07] the very depths of our heart this
[1:17:09] evening. And we need to examine and make
[1:17:12] sure everything is cleaned out. Make
[1:17:14] sure everything is cleaned up. BECAUSE
[1:17:16] LOOK, WHEN THE DEVIL'S IN FRONT OF YOU,
[1:17:18] I want to PULL THAT SWORD OUT. I WANT TO
[1:17:20] MAKE SURE IT'S SHARP. I WANT TO MAKE
[1:17:21] SURE IT CUTS.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want to pull THAT GUN UP AND
[1:17:26] PULL the trigger and nothing happen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; We got to examine
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; check ourselves.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; But we see
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; we got to prepare for a battle.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because a battle lays out in front
[1:17:43] of us.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; My grandpa was actually he was a drill
[1:17:48] sergeant during Vietnam.
[1:17:51] And I talked to him a lot. He actually
[1:17:53] he he taught people how to shoot and he
[1:17:55] he was in charge of men and he never he
[1:17:58] never went over but he sent a lot of men
[1:18:00] over overseas. And I talked to him a lot
[1:18:02] about it and to hear stories and he
[1:18:05] talks about how how he was he was very
[1:18:07] he was actually a Christian during the
[1:18:09] time who was never profane, never used
[1:18:11] language like that, but he was very
[1:18:12] difficult on the men. He said, "You
[1:18:15] know, I would rather be difficult on
[1:18:17] them now
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; and forge a good soldier that I'll see
[1:18:20] go and come back
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; rather than be nice to them now and be
[1:18:25] easy on them now
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; and never see him again."
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; I begin to think about that.
[1:18:32] THINK ABOUT GOING INTO INTO training
[1:18:36] and you got these men, they've never
[1:18:38] faced anything before. They've never
[1:18:40] faced adversity before
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; and they could begin to sit there and
[1:18:45] WHEN THE DRILL SERGEANT comes and he
[1:18:47] begins to try to train them, he begins
[1:18:49] to TRY TO TRAIN THEM. MAYBE THEY WOULD
[1:18:51] SAY, "WHY HAS HE got to be so hard on
[1:18:53] us?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Why does he GOT TO BE SO TOUGH ON US?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be nicer if he would just be
[1:19:01] easy?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; IF HE WOULD JUST JUST TAKE it easy on
[1:19:05] us. It doesn't have to be this hard.
[1:19:08] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT DRILL SERGEANT
[1:19:10] knows that in a few months, these men
[1:19:14] are going to be in a battle.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE BULLETS FLYING OVER
[1:19:18] THEIR HEAD. And he wants some men that
[1:19:21] aren't going to back up, that aren't
[1:19:23] going to get worried. THEY'RE NOT GOING
[1:19:25] TO CRUMBLE UNDER THE BATTLE. He wants TO
[1:19:28] MAKE SURE THEY'VE already faced
[1:19:30] something.
[1:19:32] YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING TO
[1:19:34] PREPARE YOU FOR THE BATTLE THAT'S IN
[1:19:36] FRONT.
[1:19:38] If these men never faced anything in
[1:19:40] training,
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THE FIRST BULLET FLEW OVER
[1:19:43] THEIR HEAD, THEY'D HIT the floor. They
[1:19:46] wouldn't know what to do. They wouldn't
[1:19:47] be able to operate. What? Fear would
[1:19:50] grip their life.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; But yet,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; he would train them.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He would prepare them
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; for a battle that lays in front of them.
[1:20:04] Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; I don't want
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; it to be so easy.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; They might think it, WOULDN'T IT JUST BE
[1:20:11] NICE?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it just be easy? But he KNOWS
[1:20:15] THERE'S A BATTLE OUT IN FRONT OF THEM.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; They're training.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; For a rule. They're training for a war.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Josh one time was preaching
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; preaching saying talking about God
[1:20:29] dealing with us as sons.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Sometimes it
[1:20:33] means correction.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it means it's got to get the
[1:20:37] belt out. I don't know if y'all believe
[1:20:39] that anymore, BUT SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE
[1:20:41] RAISING CHILDREN, I BELIEVE YOU GOT TO
[1:20:43] GET THE BELT out a little bit.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; I got I got a little boy back there.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And sometimes
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; he acts up a little bit. And we've got
[1:20:52] to correct him.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; WHAT? IT'S OUT OF LOVE. WHY? BECAUSE I'M
[1:20:56] TRYING TO MOLD A CHARACTER.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I want him to GROW UP TO BE A YOUNG MAN
[1:21:01] WITH CHARACTER. AND GOD'S THE SAME WAY.
[1:21:04] Sometimes
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; God's got to come down and he's GOT TO
[1:21:08] CORRECT US A little bit.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; But you KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE loves you.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Because he says, "Hey, they're going to
[1:21:16] rule and they're going to reign with
[1:21:18] me." And that takes character.
[1:21:22] We know that characters is not given.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; It's not just a gift you walk into, but
[1:21:28] it's a victory.
[1:21:30] YOU GET CHARACTER BY OVERCOMING
[1:21:32] SOMETHING.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; EVERY BATTLE THAT YOU GO THROUGH,
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; every time you face the enemy,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; here's just another character building
[1:21:41] opportunity. HERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
[1:21:44] FOR ME TO GROW A LITTLE MORE CHARACTER.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I say every time that we face something,
[1:21:50] MAYBE WE SAY, "LORD, MAYBE THERE WAS
[1:21:52] SOMETHING IN MY LIFE THAT JUST WASN'T
[1:21:54] QUITE LINING UP WITH WHAT YOU WANTED.
[1:21:56] Maybe there's something in MY LIFE THAT
[1:21:59] JUST DIDN'T LINE UP WITH THAT PERFECT
[1:22:01] PICTURE, the image you had for me. I
[1:22:03] SAY, LORD, IF THERE'S SOMETHING UNLIKE
[1:22:05] YOU, THEN CUT IT AWAY.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; It may not be comfortable. It may not
[1:22:11] feel good. It may hurt. It may be
[1:22:14] embarrassing, BUT I SAY, LORD, CUT IT
[1:22:16] AWAY this evening. I don't want anything
[1:22:18] standing between you and me.
[1:22:23] Let me go through this thing,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; with a good attitude.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Let me face THIS TRIAL WITH A POSITIVE
[1:22:30] ATTITUDE, RECOGNIZING, LORD, MAYBE THIS,
[1:22:33] LET THIS DRAW ME CLOSER TO YOU.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Let me use this as AN OPPORTUNITY TO
[1:22:39] STEP ONE STEP CLOSER TO YOU TO CUT AWAY
[1:22:42] SOMETHING THAT'S UNLIKE YOU.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; But we're training for a war.
[1:22:51] characters being mold molded in us.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; See some of these men
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; in the military.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; You know, nations around the world
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; fear some of our special forces.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're battle tested.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they're proven.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; They have a track record of success.
[1:23:20] They're not just back there
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; on a training ground somewhere, never
[1:23:24] seen anything. BUT WHY? SOME OF THESE
[1:23:26] MEN HAVE FACED THE BATTLE. They faced
[1:23:28] the enemy before and they've HAD SUCCESS
[1:23:30] UPON SUCCESS UPON SUCCESS. AND WHY? It
[1:23:33] creates a fear amongst the nations. THEY
[1:23:36] RESPECT IT. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A
[1:23:38] BATTLE TESTED.
[1:23:41] You know, there's some of these special
[1:23:43] forces units
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; that you don't even get in without an
[1:23:48] invitation.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; You got to be selected.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody has to see you. They got to say
[1:23:55] YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BATTLE. YOU FACED THE
[1:23:58] ENEMY.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And you've been exemplary. YOU'VE BEEN
[1:24:02] OUTSTANDING. AND THEY ACTUALLY INVITE
[1:24:04] YOU. THEY THEY THEY INVITE YOU TO THESE
[1:24:07] UNITS. some of the most elite of the
[1:24:09] elite
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; BY INVITATION ONLY. I GOT TO THINKING
[1:24:13] ABOUT THAT. I said, "You know what? I
[1:24:15] believe I'm LOOKING AT SOME OF GOD'S
[1:24:17] SPECIAL FORCES." You were hand selected
[1:24:20] BY INVITATION. GOD LOOKED DOWN THROUGH
[1:24:23] TIME and he picked you out. HE PUT YOUR
[1:24:26] NAME on a book. He selected you by name.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:24:31] cuz he recognized
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put them through the
[1:24:34] training
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; and they're not going to back up
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; when the battle gets hot
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; and the bullets start flying. They're
[1:24:42] not going to crumble.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; They're not going to back down. You know
[1:24:46] what they're going to do? They're going
[1:24:48] to stand up straight. They're going to
[1:24:50] face the enemy. They're going to pull
[1:24:51] their sword and say, "Satan, it may be
[1:24:54] hot. IT MAY BE DARK. THE DARTS MAY BE
[1:24:57] FLYING AROUND ME, but I GOT A SHIELD TO
[1:25:00] BOT THE DARTS. AND I GOT A SWORD TO GO
[1:25:04] ON THE OFFENSE.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm looking at some people
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; who have a proven track record.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; A proven track record.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You've taken God at his word time and
[1:25:22] time and time again.
[1:25:25] AND GOD SHOWED UP TIME AND TIME AND TIME
[1:25:28] AGAIN.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; So I don't know why the devil thinks
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; that if he just brings another battle
[1:25:36] that you'll crumble.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You hadn't crumbled yet.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You hadn't given up yet.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; We've faced battles.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; We faced trials. WE FACED DARK TIMES.
[1:25:49] WE'RE STILL FIGHTING.
[1:25:52] WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED down a time
[1:25:54] or two,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; but we didn't stay there.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You might HAVE GOT KNOCKED DOWN
[1:26:00] SOMETIME,
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; but you KNOW WHAT YOU DID? YOU GOT BACK
[1:26:03] UP. YOU DUSTED YOURSELF OFF AND SAY,
[1:26:05] "LORD, I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING THE
[1:26:07] BATTLE.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not staying on the ground."
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; LOOK, I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU
[1:26:14] GET KNOCKED DOWN.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you get back up,
[1:26:18] though.
[1:26:19] THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS EVERY
[1:26:21] TIME THAT YOU GET BACK UP.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; I don't care what knocked you down.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Look at David.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; You want to go through and
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; begin to look at David's faults,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; the times he let God down,
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; the times he failed.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; But you know what he did?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Every time he got back up.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; And I love this. Hallelujah.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You look at Abraham.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Look at his mistakes.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You go through the Old Testament. See,
[1:26:55] he lied.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; He ran away. All the things.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; But you go over in the New Testament.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; You go in the New Testament. YOU LOOK
[1:27:05] THROUGH THE BLOOD.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And you KNOW WHAT? THE ACCOUNT OF DAVID
[1:27:09] SAID HE WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; GO READ ABOUT ABRAHAM. IT SAID HE
[1:27:15] STAGGERED NOT AT THE PROMISE OF GOD
[1:27:17] THROUGH UNBELIEF.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; You want to look as a man in the Old
[1:27:22] Testament, you see mistakes, you see
[1:27:24] faults, you see failures, YOU SEE MEN
[1:27:26] THAT GOT KNOCKED DOWN. BUT YOU GO TO THE
[1:27:29] NEW TESTAMENT, look through the blood,
[1:27:31] YOU SEE MEN THAT STOOD BACK UP.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE ACCOUNT OF THEM is a man AFTER
[1:27:36] GOD'S OWN HEART. HEY, I'VE LET GOD DOWN
[1:27:39] MANY TIMES. I FAILED GOD MANY TIMES. BUT
[1:27:42] I'M STILL STANDING this evening by God's
[1:27:45] grace. HE PICKED ME UP TIME AND TIME
[1:27:48] AGAIN. AND I SAY, "LORD, MAY THE ACCOUNT
[1:27:51] OF MY LIFE
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; be that I was a man after God's own
[1:27:55] heart,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; you'll get knocked down.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; But get back up."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; See, David was trained.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; David had experiences with God. that he
[1:28:12] could draw on
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; before he faced the giant.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WALK RIGHT UP AND FACE THE
[1:28:18] GIANT.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T JUST JUST WALK UP AND FACE THE
[1:28:22] GIANT ONE DAY. NO, HE spent years in the
[1:28:25] desert.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; He spent years in the desert being
[1:28:29] trained.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; He faced A BEAR.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; HE FACED A LION.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE, HIS FAITH WAS BUILDING.
[1:28:38] ALL THE WHILE,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; HE began to HAVE A BACKLOG
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; OF TESTIMONIES IN HIS BACK POCKET,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; he be TO SAY, "I WAS UP AGAINST THIS
[1:28:48] TRIAL AND GOD DELIVERED ME.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I WAS UP AGAINST THIS TRIAL AND GOD
[1:28:53] MOVED ON THE SITUATION." What was HE
[1:28:55] DOING? HE WAS JUST PACKING HIS BAG WITH
[1:28:57] TESTIMONIES.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; How many's been doing that?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; How many's BEEN PACKING YOUR BAG WITH
[1:29:02] testimonies time after time? Say, you
[1:29:05] were against THIS TRIAL AND GOD BROUGHT
[1:29:07] you through it.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; You faced A BEAR AND GOD BROUGHT YOU
[1:29:11] THROUGH IT.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A BAG FULL OF TESTIMONIES JUST
[1:29:14] WAITING FOR THE NEXT TRIAL.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; There he comes down.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; He comes there to the battle.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; He sees Goliath there. And
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; there Saul and the children children of
[1:29:31] Israel claim to have God on their side.
[1:29:35] But they were backed up in a corner
[1:29:37] scared.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; They were backed up in a corner hiding
[1:29:41] behind their shields.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz they were scared.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN DAVID COME UP ON THE SCENE,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; he began TO RECOGNIZE SOMETHING'S NOT
[1:29:50] RIGHT HERE.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; HE BE TO GO BACK THROUGH HIS THROUGH HIS
[1:29:54] LIFE AND BACK THROUGH THROUGH WHAT GOD
[1:29:57] SAID AND EXAMINE AND SAY,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; "God didn't intend
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; for us to be scared.
[1:30:03] GOD DIDN'T INTEND FOR US TO be defeated
[1:30:06] and backed up here IN THE CORNER. GOD
[1:30:08] DIDN'T intend for this this devil, this
[1:30:10] Philistine, THIS GIANT TO HAVE HIS WAY
[1:30:13] with us.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He went out to face the giant.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He declined all THE ARMOR THAT SAUL
[1:30:21] TRIED TO GIVE HIM. WHY? HE HAD THE ARMOR
[1:30:24] OF GOD THAT WAS GREATER THAN ANY EARTHLY
[1:30:26] ARMOR that could be put on. Saul said,
[1:30:29] "Here, take this." And David said, "No,
[1:30:31] that's not going to work for me."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS IN THE DESERT,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; WITH MY FATHER'S SHEEP, A BEAR COME DOWN
[1:30:40] OUT OF THE mountains
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; and by God's grace slew him.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, A LION CAME DOWN
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME THROUGH AND SLEW HIM.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; What difference is this Goliath?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; how a devil will begin to get in your
[1:31:01] mind
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; and he'll say, you know,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I know God moved before.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I know he healed you there. I know he
[1:31:09] delivered you then, but you know, this
[1:31:11] situation,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; it's just a little too big for God.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, I KNOW GOD HEALED YOU
[1:31:18] OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I KNOW GOD
[1:31:20] DELIVERED YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN need over
[1:31:22] AND OVER AGAIN, BUT THIS time it's just
[1:31:24] a LITTLE DIFFERENT.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; THIS TIME IT'S JUST TOO BIG.
[1:31:30] IF HE DID IT BEFORE, HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.
[1:31:33] IF HE MOVED BEFORE, HE'S THE SAME GOD.
[1:31:36] HE CHANGES NOT.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; David walked down in there.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Picked up those five stones
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; representing sir
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; f a i t h in jes su.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I love brother Brandham. He said that
[1:31:57] David had the word, the promise, and the
[1:32:00] power to sling it.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PROMISE AND HE HAD FAITH ENOUGH
[1:32:05] TO BELIEVE IN THAT PROMISE. WHY? CUZ GOD
[1:32:08] HAD MOVED BEFORE. HE had been prepared
[1:32:10] for this battle. He had been prepared
[1:32:13] for this moment. He knew. God knew that
[1:32:15] all the preparation,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; all the training was building HIM UP TO
[1:32:20] THIS MOMENT
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN A GIANT WOULD BE STANDING IN THE
[1:32:23] WAY. AND DAVID WOULDN'T BACK UP AND BACK
[1:32:26] DOWN AND GET WORRIED. DAVID SAID, "THE
[1:32:28] SAME GOD THAT SLEW THE THE BEAR, THE
[1:32:31] SAME GOD THAT SLEW THE LION WILL SLAY
[1:32:34] GOLIATH."
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You know, we got to let we got to learn
[1:32:42] to let God fight our battles for us,
[1:32:43] though.
[1:32:45] You know, the problem is a lot of times
[1:32:46] we're trying to fight on our own.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; We're trying to take our muscles and OUR
[1:32:51] STRENGTH AND OUR KNOWLEDGE AND OUR
[1:32:53] ABILITY AND WE think we're GOING TO
[1:32:55] COMBAT GOLIATH WITH HOW STRONG WE ARE
[1:32:58] AND HOW SMART WE ARE. LOOK, THAT IS NOT
[1:33:00] GOING TO WORK.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You got to back up AND SAY, GOD, YOU'RE
[1:33:06] THE ONLY WAY.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; MY STRENGTH IS NOTHING. BUT GOD, IT'S
[1:33:11] YOUR strength that defeated the bear.
[1:33:13] YOUR STRENGTH DEFEATED THE LION. YOUR
[1:33:16] STRENGTH DEFEATED GOLIATH. YOUR STRENGTH
[1:33:18] WILL DEFEAT THE DEVIL THAT'S IN FRONT OF
[1:33:20] ME.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; There when Elisha and his servant were
[1:33:28] there and
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; they woke up one morning
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; and there was enemy all the way around
[1:33:34] them.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; There was enemy all the way around them.
[1:33:39] And the servant stepped out
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; and he looked and he saw enemy.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; He turned around and he saw enemy. He
[1:33:46] turned around and saw enemy and he sat
[1:33:48] there and began to think there is no way
[1:33:50] we're getting out of this.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; How many's ever done that before? How
[1:33:54] many's ever ever woke up and you
[1:33:56] recognize that everything's falling
[1:33:58] apart around you? The enemy's attacking
[1:34:01] on every hand. And you begin to sit
[1:34:03] there and say, "There's no way.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; There's no way that I CAN OVERCOME THIS.
[1:34:08] THERE'S NO WAY I CAN COME through this.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And on your own,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; you're right.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; On your own, there is no way.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But Elisha stepped out and said, "Lord,
[1:34:20] open his eyes.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Open his eyes."
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; His eyes WERE OPEN AND HE RECOGNIZED
[1:34:27] ANGELS WERE COMPASSED ABOUT HIM. THERE
[1:34:29] WAS MORE ANGELS than there was enemy.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THAT IS
[1:34:34] THOSE angels were there the whole time.
[1:34:36] Those angels were there the whole time.
[1:34:39] He just couldn't see them. So when
[1:34:41] you're sit down and you recognize that
[1:34:43] there's enemy on every hand, there's
[1:34:45] things falling apart all around you. Let
[1:34:47] me encourage you this evening AND SAY
[1:34:49] THE ANGELS OF GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT
[1:34:52] YOU.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; They're all the way around you.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Elisha and his servant didn't have to
[1:35:00] fight at all.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to do anything.
[1:35:05] They come down and God blinded the
[1:35:08] enemy's eyes
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; and Elisha just led him away.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT. GOD FOUGHT.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; TRAINING.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; They've been trained.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; he had to go into the desert. He had to
[1:35:28] spend 40 years in the desert
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; losing his earthly training
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; so he could be trained by God.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; He had to lose all of his knowledge,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; all of his ability,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; all of his strength
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; until one day he was just weak enough
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and he could be sensitive enough
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; and he could be obedient to God.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; He had TO GET ALL HIS SCIENTIFIC
[1:35:54] KNOWLEDGE OUT. SO ONE day
[1:35:57] There could be a burning bush and HE
[1:35:59] COULD PASS BY AND HE COULD SEE THAT
[1:36:01] BURNING bush and he could go up there
[1:36:03] and be sensitive enough to recognize AND
[1:36:06] GOD COULD COME DOWN AND SPEAK TO HIM and
[1:36:08] use him.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to be trained.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; It's often in the dry places in our life
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; where the most gross takes place.
[1:36:20] It's often when it's dry and thirsty and
[1:36:24] dark
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; is when God is molding your character
[1:36:27] the most.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; That's when the most growth is taking
[1:36:31] place.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Takes a backs of the desert experience.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You look at brother Brandham,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; the things that he went through
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; to form his character.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Think about the things that he had to go
[1:36:47] through. That's right. the lessons he
[1:36:49] had to learn
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; starting off early in his life
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; there. He he had a call to go to the
[1:36:54] Pentecostals and he refused it,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; he had to pay for that decision.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; What it was a lesson that he learned
[1:37:02] though
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; there he's in South Africa
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; and the Lord says go to this certain
[1:37:07] meeting
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; but he let the BROTHERS TALK HIM OUT OF
[1:37:10] IT and he paid for that. BUT ALL THE
[1:37:13] WHILE, GOD WAS MOLDING A CHARACTER in
[1:37:15] there.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; And one day, there was a little woman
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; THAT HAD A SON THAT WAS SICK AND DYING
[1:37:22] IN BED.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; AND SHE BEGAN TO FERVENTLY PRAY for this
[1:37:26] child. She began to look in the Bible
[1:37:28] and recognize herself. She looked out
[1:37:31] and said, "God, I'M YOUR SHUNOMI WOMAN.
[1:37:33] WHERE'S YOUR ELIJAH?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ME.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS
[1:37:38] SCRIPTURE?"
[1:37:40] And brother Brandham's flying across the
[1:37:42] COUNTRY AND A PLANE lands in Memphis.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And the next morning, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S
[1:37:47] GOING TO DROP SOME LETTERS OFF AND GOING
[1:37:49] TO GO TO HIS go to the airport.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And a little voice
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; begins to come down and say, "Turn this
[1:37:58] way.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Turn this way."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You know what there was? There was a man
[1:38:04] that had been trained.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; There was a man that had went through
[1:38:08] stuff. There was a man that had faced
[1:38:10] the enemy before. HE HAD MADE MISTAKES
[1:38:13] BEFORE. HE HAD GOT BACK UP AND SAID,
[1:38:15] "LORD, help me." He had learned and his
[1:38:18] character had been molded till he could
[1:38:20] be so sensitive
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; to God's leading
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; that he would turn here
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; AND TURN THERE. ALL THE WHILE KNOWING
[1:38:27] THAT PLANE WAS GOING TO LEAVE WITHOUT
[1:38:28] HIM.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE KNOWING HE WAS GOING TO
[1:38:31] MISS that flight.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; But there was a little woman THERE
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS CRYING OUT TO GOD.
[1:38:38] AND GOD SAID, "Here's your Elijah.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; There was A MAN THAT WAS SENSITIVE
[1:38:44] enough
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; that he could be used by God.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, help me
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; go through training in my life. Let me
[1:38:52] BE TRAINED TILL I can be sensitive
[1:38:54] ENOUGH THAT IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT HAS
[1:38:57] NEED, IF THERE'S SOMEONE THAT'S
[1:38:59] STRUGGLING that maybe the Lord could use
[1:39:01] me,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; MAY I BE SENSITIVE ENOUGH THAT IF THE
[1:39:05] LORD DIRECTS ME, go here or go there.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Let me be able to be used.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; But we see it was the training that took
[1:39:18] place.
[1:39:20] We're molded by our trials.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Our battles and trials, they mold the
[1:39:26] character in us.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; First Peter 1:7, that the trial of your
[1:39:30] faith
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; being much more precious
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; than of gold,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; much more precious than of gold, watch
[1:39:38] this, that perisheth.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Why is it more precious than gold?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Because character is eternal.
[1:39:48] Gold's going to perish.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; All the riches in the world
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; are going to perish.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; They're all going to go away.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; The greatest witches riches in the world
[1:40:00] aren't going to make you happy. They
[1:40:02] aren't going to make you fulfilled
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; being much more precious than gold
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; that perishes. though it be tried with
[1:40:11] fire might be found unto praise and
[1:40:14] honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:40:16] Jesus Christ.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; So the trial OF YOUR FAITH, THE THINGS
[1:40:19] YOU GO THROUGH ARE PRECIOUS TO YOU. WHY?
[1:40:22] BECAUSE THEY'RE MOLDING THAT CHARACTER
[1:40:24] THAT IS REQUIRED FOR YOU TO REIGN with
[1:40:27] Christ.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I love uh just the other day I was
[1:40:31] relistening to the testimony of brother
[1:40:33] Gary Walker. I don't know if y'all how
[1:40:35] many of y'all have heard that, but he he
[1:40:37] actually came uh years ago to brother
[1:40:39] Tim Humes when I was still going there
[1:40:41] and gave his testimony. JUST A A
[1:40:43] POWERFUL TESTIMONY. You can find it on
[1:40:45] YouTube.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Here he was in this car crash and he the
[1:40:48] list of injuries is just just
[1:40:50] unfathomable.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; And he's laying in the hospital and he
[1:40:53] begins TO TALK ABOUT HOW much in pain he
[1:40:55] was and the pain was just unbearable.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And he ACTUALLY GOT TO THE POINT he
[1:41:00] began to ask God why. Here he was a
[1:41:03] pastor.
[1:41:05] He was on the field preaching. I believe
[1:41:06] at the act time of the accident, he was
[1:41:08] actually on his way back from preaching.
[1:41:10] He had a family with children. And he's
[1:41:12] asking God, "Why
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; my children DON'T HAVE A FATHER RIGHT
[1:41:16] NOW? MY CHURCH IS doesn't have a pastor.
[1:41:19] His businesses were going by the
[1:41:20] wayside."
[1:41:23] And he said, God spoke to him
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; and said, "If you could see the bigger
[1:41:28] picture,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; you would volunteer for it.
[1:41:31] If you could SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE, YOU
[1:41:34] WOULD VOLUNTEER FOR IT. HOW POWERFUL IS
[1:41:36] THAT? WHY? BECAUSE ALL WE CAN SEE IS
[1:41:39] SUCH A SMALL LITTLE PORTION OF TIME.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN ONE SPOT, HE
[1:41:44] SAID, "HOW COULD YOUR LITTLE human your
[1:41:47] finite mind
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; understand the infinite mind OF GOD?
[1:41:51] IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Our little minds, we just can't
[1:41:55] UNDERSTAND IT. BUT GOD KNOWS THE END
[1:41:58] FROM THE BEGINNING.
[1:42:00] Every trial he puts in your way, every
[1:42:03] every fight, every battle, EVERY
[1:42:06] MOUNTAIN YOU GOT TO climb up, it's for a
[1:42:08] reason.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Think of all the people
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; my brother
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; that brother Walker came in contact with
[1:42:17] through that
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; condition, through that time. MAYBE
[1:42:20] THERE WAS ONE PERSON
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WAS THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; TO COME IN CONTACT WITH JESUS CHRIST.
[1:42:28] MAYBE THAT WAS THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Imagine getting to the other side
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; and you meet somebody
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; that says, "You remember that time you
[1:42:39] were in the hospital?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You remember that time you WERE GOING
[1:42:42] THROUGH THE DARKEST TRIAL OF YOUR LIFE?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; But you had a positive attitude through
[1:42:47] it all.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT TIME THAT I THAT MEANT
[1:42:51] SOMETHING TO ME. I SAW THAT THAT HAD AN
[1:42:53] EFFECT ON MY LIFE. HOW WORTH IT WOULD IT
[1:42:55] BE then
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; if you could recognize that your trial,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; YOUR BATTLE
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; HAD AN EFFECT ON SOMEBODY?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; But we got to go THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH
[1:43:07] A POSITIVE ATTITUDE.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, when the battle
[1:43:12] gets hot, you start to say, "God, why?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Why me? WHY THIS? WHY AM I FACING THIS?
[1:43:21] WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS?" AND YOU
[1:43:22] BEGIN TO get negative.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants what you have
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; if you get negative.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible said it's a peace
[1:43:33] that passes all understanding.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING.
[1:43:38] WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE peace
[1:43:40] in the midst of conflict.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of the storm, peace
[1:43:44] when everything's falling apart around
[1:43:46] you, PEACE WHEN EVERYTHING'S GOING
[1:43:48] WRONG. And that's a peace. It passes all
[1:43:51] understanding because the world looks at
[1:43:53] you and the world looks at you and they
[1:43:55] say, "This is going wrong and that's
[1:43:58] going wrong and this is happening and
[1:44:00] that's happening and you're still at
[1:44:02] peace."
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I don't understand that
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; the world looks and says, "You're still
[1:44:08] at peace.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; YOUR YOUR YOUR WORLD'S falling apart
[1:44:12] around you
[1:44:14] and you've not lost your faith.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You're still at peace.
[1:44:19] You're still saying the Lord that
[1:44:20] giveth, the Lord that takes away.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You're still saying God's Jesus Christ
[1:44:24] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:44:26] You're saying he'll never leave me.
[1:44:28] He'll never forsake me.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; He'll be with me, even in me.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; It's a peace the WORLD CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
[1:44:34] WHY? CUZ IT'S A PEACE THAT ONLY THIS
[1:44:36] WORD can give.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PEACE THAT'LL PREPARE YOU FOR THE
[1:44:42] MIDST OF BATTLE. It'll prepare you for
[1:44:44] the midst of the storm.
[1:44:50] We can't complain
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; sending us through testing and through
[1:44:54] trying.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham uses the illustration of
[1:44:58] those fire departments.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; A fire breaks out in a building in in
[1:45:03] Jeffersonville and the fire department
[1:45:04] pulls up and
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; he said the fire chief is just standing
[1:45:08] in the background saying, "Well, put a
[1:45:09] little WATER THERE AND PUT A LITTLE
[1:45:11] WATER THERE AND PUT A LITTLE water
[1:45:13] there." And he said, "The fire is just
[1:45:14] raging the whole time. But he said all
[1:45:17] of a sudden here comes Louisville across
[1:45:19] THE BRIDGE AND THEY FLY UP TO the scene
[1:45:22] and they begin. He said THE CHIEF JUMPS
[1:45:24] RIGHT OUT. HE'S THE FIRST ONE UP THE
[1:45:26] LADDER. He said he had an axe in one
[1:45:29] hand and a water hose in the other hand.
[1:45:31] He's not sitting there SAYING SPURT A
[1:45:33] LITTLE WATER HERE, spurt a little water
[1:45:35] there. NO, HE SAID, "COME ON, BOYS.
[1:45:37] FOLLOW ME." And he breaks right through
[1:45:39] and begins to PUT THE FIRE OUT. WHY?
[1:45:41] BECAUSE there was experience there.
[1:45:44] That wasn't his first fire. THAT WAS NOT
[1:45:48] HIS FIRST BATTLE. HE'D BEEN IN A battle
[1:45:50] before and he could lead by example and
[1:45:53] say, "Come on, boys."
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannam said that's the same
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; as Jesus Christ did. He led by example.
[1:46:03] He come and lived as a human and
[1:46:05] conquered death, hell, and the grave and
[1:46:07] said, "Come on, boys.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; COME ON. FOLLOW ME.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; He led by example.
[1:46:17] Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Giving us a word
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; that we could overcome with.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; The message came to prepare us for
[1:46:26] battle.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; That bring us to a close here.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; The message came to reveal the enemy and
[1:46:34] his tactics.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; What? To bring us back into a
[1:46:37] relationship with Jesus Christ. Make him
[1:46:39] real once again.
[1:46:44] You know, people, they want to believe
[1:46:46] that the devil is some creature with
[1:46:48] horns and hooves and
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; they want to believe that.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; They don't recognize that the devil
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; is cunning.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; The devil's beautiful.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; The devil has all the shiny things that
[1:47:03] draw the attention.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; The devil has all the shiny things
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; to come in and try to deceive.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Why? It's so close.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; He's shrewd and wise.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's why it was important that the
[1:47:18] message would come
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; and display his tactics.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WOULD COME DOWN AND SAY,
[1:47:23] "LOOK, WE'RE going to PULL THE VEIL OFF
[1:47:25] THE DEVIL.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL'S SHREWD. HE'S WISE. HE'S
[1:47:29] GOING TO COME IN AND TRY TO DECE
[1:47:31] DECEIVE,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; but it'll expose his tactics
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; and identify him."
[1:47:40] See, his tactics are reasoning.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; That's one of the main tactics that the
[1:47:45] enemy uses, reasoning.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "FAITH doesn't
[1:47:50] reason."
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't reason.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; But the enemy wants you to reason.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; THE ENEMY WANTS YOU TO COME DOWN. AND
[1:48:00] THE ENEMY WANTS TO COME in and say,
[1:48:01] "Look,
[1:48:03] I know he moved before.
[1:48:06] I know he said you could be victorious.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I know he said you could overcome.
[1:48:11] But you know the doctor said
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; the doctor said
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; you know science shows
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Bam talks about Noah
[1:48:23] there and there he is and he's going to
[1:48:27] build a boat and he said God said it's
[1:48:30] going to rain and the scientists would
[1:48:32] come and say look we shot the moon we
[1:48:34] shot the stars we can tell you there's
[1:48:36] no water up there there's no way it's
[1:48:38] going to happen THE SCIENCE REPORT SAID
[1:48:41] IT'S NO THERE'S NO WAY.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; What if he'd have started reasoning with
[1:48:45] that
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; and said, "Well, God, I know you said
[1:48:48] this, but but look, the scientists and
[1:48:50] Dr. SO AND SO AND THIS GUY'S SAYING THIS
[1:48:53] and no,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; faith doesn't reason.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; If God said it, you stand on it and you
[1:48:59] believe it.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't reason.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Bill, come back to the music this
[1:49:08] evening.
[1:49:10] It takes a hand of faith
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; to hold the sword.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; It takes a hand of faith
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; to hold the sword.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't have any faith, a sword's
[1:49:23] not going to do you any good.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Because as soon as YOU PULL THAT SWORD
[1:49:28] OUT, there the enemy is going to be to
[1:49:29] reason you out of it.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; To reason you away from every promise,
[1:49:33] reason you away from every victory. But
[1:49:35] if you got a hand of faith holding that
[1:49:37] sword,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; there's no reasoning.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; There's no talking you out of it.
[1:49:42] There's no talking YOU AWAY FROM IT.
[1:49:44] WHY? BECAUSE YOU GOT THE FAITH HOLDING
[1:49:46] THAT SWORD.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said,
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; grab the faith.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; That sword of the spirit.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the lord.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Scream hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then cut down every enemy in front
[1:50:06] of you.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; There it is. Cut every enemy.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; If an old SPOOKY SPIRIT STARTS MAKING
[1:50:12] YOU FEEL ALWAYS, CUT THE THING AWAY WITH
[1:50:15] THE WORD OF GOD. I SAY THIS EVENING, IF
[1:50:17] THERE'S A SPOOKY SPIRIT THAT'S GOT YOU
[1:50:20] FEELING SOME FUNNY WAY, IF A IF THE
[1:50:22] DEVIL HAS PUT A SPOOKY SPIRIT IN YOUR
[1:50:24] HOUSE OR IN YOUR LIFE, IN YOUR FAMILY,
[1:50:27] TAKE THE WORD AND CUT IT AWAY.
[1:50:33] Brother Bandham said, "But our strength
[1:50:34] is the joy of the Lord is my strength."
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; The joy OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH THIS
[1:50:40] EVENING. NOT MY ABILITY, NOT MY WAY, BUT
[1:50:44] THE JOY OF THE LORD.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Get away from me."
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; WHACK. YOU CUT HIM WITH THE WORD.
[1:50:52] WHETHER it be a demon, whether it be
[1:50:54] enemy, whether it be sickness, whether
[1:50:57] it be disease, whatever it is, take that
[1:51:00] word, pull it with the sword.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I love this.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you whack it the first
[1:51:07] time,
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; and it don't seem to move, whack it
[1:51:11] again.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Whack it again AND WHACK IT AGAIN. WHACK
[1:51:16] IT UNTIL YOU'VE CHIPPED A HOLE through
[1:51:18] it."
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MAY PULL THE SWORD
[1:51:21] OUT ONE TIME AND YOU MAY START FIGHTING.
[1:51:23] MAYBE YOU HIT THE DEVIL THE FIRST HIT
[1:51:25] AND HE DON'T BACK UP.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You know what you do?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; You keep swinging.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; IF HE DON'T BACK UP THE SECOND TIME, YOU
[1:51:34] SWING AGAIN.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "IF YOUR ENEMY
[1:51:37] DOESN'T BACK UP THE FIRST TIME YOU WHACK
[1:51:39] AT IT, YOU WHACK HIM AGAIN AND WHACK HIM
[1:51:41] AGAIN. WHACK HIM AGAIN until he backs
[1:51:44] up."
[1:51:46] Brother Brandham said,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; "Whack it until you chipped a hole
[1:51:52] through it
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; like a little chicken p peeking itself
[1:51:56] out." Or an eagle peek yourself RIGHT
[1:51:59] THROUGH THAT OLD SHELL OF SICKNESS. CUT
[1:52:02] YOUR WAY OUT AND SAY, "HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:04] WHERE'S THE NEXT ONE? That's the battle.
[1:52:06] THAT'S A SOLDIER. THAT'S A SOLDIER of
[1:52:08] the cross. Yes, sir. Knock every enemy
[1:52:13] out.
[1:52:15] He's saying you got TO JUST START
[1:52:17] PECKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THAT OLD SHELL
[1:52:19] OF SICKNESS, THAT OLD SHELL OF DEFEAT,
[1:52:22] THAT OLD SHELL OF DEPRESSION, THAT COME
[1:52:24] ON NOW.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You got to keep pecking YOUR WAY THROUGH
[1:52:27] IT. WHY? GOD GAVE YOU A SWORD. HE GAVE
[1:52:30] YOU He gave you his word
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and it's STRONG ENOUGH FOR EVERY DEMON,
[1:52:35] FOR EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY WORRY, EVERY
[1:52:38] PROBLEM.
[1:52:42] HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; As you stand to your feet this evening,
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "And when a man or a
[1:52:49] woman
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; is dressed
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; in the full armor of God,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; it is it ain't power,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; it's authority from on high."
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; When he says, "The devils will scream
[1:53:02] and the breaks will squeak. EVEN DEATH
[1:53:04] ITSELF will shutter and graves will open
[1:53:07] at the authority that Jesus Christ gave
[1:53:11] his church.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; These shines shall follow them that
[1:53:15] believe. Lift up the authority the
[1:53:18] inside.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Brother man said when you put on the
[1:53:21] full armor of God,
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; it's not your power.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; It's not your ability.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; It's not what you can do, but it's the
[1:53:29] authority that God gave you that's
[1:53:31] stronger than every enemy. Amen.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; What did he say? He gave you the
[1:53:36] greatest
[1:53:38] weapon.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; There's nothing. LOOK, THE DEVIL'S NOT
[1:53:42] GOING TO COME UP with something too
[1:53:43] great tomorrow.
[1:53:45] He's not going to develop a weapon
[1:53:47] that's stronger. He's not going to
[1:53:49] develop a weapon that's greater than
[1:53:51] what you have. You've got the weapon of
[1:53:53] faith in this word. And you can take
[1:53:55] that hand of faith and you can hold the
[1:53:58] sword up and you CAN FIGHT EVERY DEVIL.
[1:54:00] LOOK, DON'T LET HIM BACK YOU IN THE
[1:54:02] CORNER. DON'T LET HIM DEFEAT YOU. DON'T
[1:54:04] LET HIM PUSH YOU BACK. YOU'VE GOT A
[1:54:06] SWORD FOR A REASON TO fight
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; and go on the offense this evening.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray.
[1:54:16] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we thank you
[1:54:17] Lord for your grace and your mercy.
[1:54:21] Lord, we thank you Lord for Lord for
[1:54:24] giving us an armor Lord for giving us a
[1:54:27] preparation. Lord, you didn't just put
[1:54:30] us here and lay out a sea of that
[1:54:33] and let us try to figure it out on our
[1:54:35] own. But Lord, you sent a message to
[1:54:37] prepare us. YOU SENT A MESSAGE TO DRESS
[1:54:40] UP BRIDE. You sent A MESSAGE THAT WOULD
[1:54:43] THAT WOULD GIVE US THE PREPARATION we
[1:54:45] would need to face the battle every day.
[1:54:49] Lord, we know the battle is hot. We know
[1:54:52] that the enem is fighting stronger and
[1:54:55] stronger every day, Lord. But you've
[1:54:57] already given us the greatest weapon,
[1:55:00] Lord. Help us, Lord, to examine
[1:55:02] ourselves, Lord. May we go and begin to
[1:55:05] look through our lives and say, Lord, do
[1:55:07] we need to buckle something up a little
[1:55:09] tighter? Do we need to bring this armor
[1:55:11] and tighten it down because we know
[1:55:13] there's a battle out in front of us?
[1:55:16] Lord, may we sharpen up our swords as we
[1:55:19] dig into this word and dig into this
[1:55:21] message. And Lord, begin to stack away
[1:55:24] these testimonies,
[1:55:26] stack away these quotes,
[1:55:29] stack away these nuggets out of the
[1:55:31] scripture
[1:55:32] that when the enemy begins to come
[1:55:34] against us, WHEN THE ENEMY TRIES TO
[1:55:37] FIGHT, WE CAN BEGIN TO PULL them out and
[1:55:39] say, "It is written. It is written."
[1:55:44] Lord, help us, Father, in our daily
[1:55:46] walk. Lord, be with us and go with us,
[1:55:50] Lord, that we would be prepared for the
[1:55:52] battle that lays before. We give you the
[1:55:55] glory and the honor. In Jesus name we
[1:55:57] pray. Amen. And amen.
[1:56:01] God bless you this evening. Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe the Lord speak to you
[1:56:15] spoke to you tonight. So let's give the
[1:56:18] Lord a big thanksgiving clap tonight.
[1:56:23] Amen.
[1:56:24] What a timely message. Prepare for the
[1:56:28] battle.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And that battle is not yours.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; It is the battle of the Lord.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; And that battle is a blessing in
[1:56:38] disguisement. Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; It looks like a battle, but it's an
[1:56:41] opportunity for God.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; God has been giving you so much
[1:56:46] ammunition
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; and you wonder why this unfolding of the
[1:56:51] word. Why the mysteries?
[1:56:55] Why does he have to preach Revelation
[1:56:57] one, Revelation 2? Why does he have to
[1:57:00] preach Hebrew one? Why do we have to
[1:57:02] have 1,200
[1:57:04] and so forth messages? God knew we need
[1:57:08] all of them.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; The bag might feel like it's heavy, but
[1:57:14] the one who went before
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; knew what we needed to pack
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; to make it all the way to the other
[1:57:21] side.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Carry the message. Put the message in
[1:57:26] the bag. Keep loading the message. Keep
[1:57:28] listening to the message. Keep packing
[1:57:31] because you would need it. And at the
[1:57:33] appropriate time when the enemy comes,
[1:57:35] it will be an opportunity for God to use
[1:57:38] the training that you went through and
[1:57:41] to use it for another victory. So your
[1:57:44] battle is actually an opportunity for
[1:57:47] another experience, another victory,
[1:57:50] another deliverance because God is in
[1:57:53] the midst of the battle.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever is in your life that need to be
[1:57:57] clean up, clean up.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Clean it up completely. God don't want
[1:58:02] you to back up. God doesn't want you to
[1:58:05] be on defense. When you're going on
[1:58:08] defense, you are losing ground.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; As as you backing up, the enemy is
[1:58:13] moving forward. You need to be moving
[1:58:15] forward.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; So the enemy can back up.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Remember the noble man before he goes,
[1:58:24] he took one thing and he left the pound.
[1:58:29] And the pound was money.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say money represent
[1:58:34] what?
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; This is what God is talking to you and
[1:58:37] insisting for 2025. You need that faith
[1:58:42] to be able to move forward. You need
[1:58:45] that faith to be able to hold the sword
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; and to cut through everything and move
