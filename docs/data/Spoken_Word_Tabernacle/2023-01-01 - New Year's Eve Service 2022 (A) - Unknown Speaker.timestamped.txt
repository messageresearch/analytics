[56:43] First Chronicles 22.
[56:58] then David said
[57:01] this
[57:02] is the house
[57:04] of the Lord God
[57:06] and this is the altar of the burnt
[57:09] offering for Israel
[57:11] and David commanded to gather together
[57:13] The Strangers that were in the land of
[57:16] Israel
[57:17] and he set Masons to do to Hue
[57:21] wrotstones to build the house of God
[57:25] and David prepared iron
[57:28] in abundance for the nails for the doors
[57:32] of the gates and for the joinings and
[57:35] brass
[57:36] in abundance
[57:38] you notice that word abundance
[57:43] uh
[57:48] brass in abundance without weight
[57:51] and also cedar trees
[57:53] in abundance
[57:55] and the zydonians they were they of Tire
[57:59] brought much uh Cedarwood to David
[58:03] and David said
[58:05] Solomon my son a young and tender
[58:09] and that house that has that is to be
[58:12] builded for the Lord
[58:14] must be exceeding magnifico
[58:22] let me read that one more time
[58:28] David had a vision
[58:31] David had a vision brother Stephen has a
[58:34] vision
[58:36] for this assembly he's not responsible
[58:39] for the assembly out in Johnson City
[58:41] Tennessee he's responsible for this
[58:44] assembly here and he has a vision and
[58:49] it's incumbent upon every one of us that
[58:52] looks to this house as being our house
[58:55] of prayer that being our house where we
[58:58] feed our souls to catch the same vision
[59:02] that's brother Stephen has so that we
[59:05] can present to God a a house of God that
[59:10] is magnificent
[59:15] exceeding magnifico
[59:18] of Fame
[59:20] and of Glory throughout all the
[59:23] countries and I will therefore now make
[59:26] preparation for it
[59:31] when's he going to make preparation I
[59:34] will
[59:35] now
[59:37] I will now therefore and one of the
[59:39] greatest tricks that the Satan Satan
[59:41] will pull on a Believer is to let you
[59:44] think there's tomorrow
[59:46] remember sufficient for the day is the
[59:49] evil thereof don't put it off till
[59:51] tomorrow
[59:53] when there was something to be done
[59:55] Jesus got it done he didn't wait till
[59:59] tomorrow
[1:00:02] exceeding magnifico
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] and I will therefore now make
[1:00:10] preparation for it so David prepared
[1:00:14] abundantly
[1:00:17] before his death Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:21] we present ourselves to you now father
[1:00:24] asking you Lord God to feed your
[1:00:27] children Lord to feed these hungry Souls
[1:00:30] that have gathered tonight to catch a
[1:00:32] vision to catch a morsel of your word
[1:00:35] father so that our souls can be stirred
[1:00:37] within us so that we can make a
[1:00:40] preparation Lord God because we know
[1:00:42] that this Mortal will put on immortality
[1:00:46] amen that this corruptible will put on
[1:00:48] incorruption and we know that if the
[1:00:51] spirit of him that raised up Christ from
[1:00:54] the dead dwell in us then he that raised
[1:00:57] up Christ from them amen will also
[1:00:59] Quicken our mortal bodies by the very
[1:01:02] spirit that dwells in US amen Lord Jesus
[1:01:05] we're asking you now father to come and
[1:01:08] to fill us as our sister sang fill us
[1:01:11] with the promise that you made amen the
[1:01:13] Holy Spirit we want a filling we want to
[1:01:16] refill him amen and Lord we want to just
[1:01:18] keep on getting filled until there's no
[1:01:21] more of us I have made a house of Saul
[1:01:24] grow weak and the House of David
[1:01:26] graystrong we ask it in Jesus name amen
[1:01:30] amen amen you can take your seats
[1:01:33] Hallelujah
[1:01:36] our God is good
[1:01:38] and so I want to talk about a magnifico
[1:01:41] you yes my brother
[1:01:43] I want to talk about magnifical you
[1:01:48] but I don't want to spell you y o u
[1:01:54] amen there's another way to spell you
[1:01:59] e w e
[1:02:02] I tried to look that up in French
[1:02:04] and it's a it's a difficult word to say
[1:02:06] in French
[1:02:07] [Laughter]
[1:02:09] how do you say you in French brother
[1:02:11] Stephen
[1:02:16] I'll take
[1:02:18] it was something different than that
[1:02:20] when I looked it up
[1:02:23] but see the reason that David was so
[1:02:25] excited about making a preparation and
[1:02:27] and as we know David came to a place in
[1:02:31] his life in his heart to where he wanted
[1:02:34] to build a house for God
[1:02:36] and he went to the the prophet Nathanael
[1:02:38] and and Nathanael told him initially he
[1:02:41] said just do everything that's in your
[1:02:44] heart just do everything that's in your
[1:02:47] heart and so but then after a little
[1:02:50] while the Lord came and he spoke to uh
[1:02:52] to Nathanael and and Nathaniel had to go
[1:02:55] back to David and it revealed to him
[1:02:57] that because there had been much
[1:02:58] Bloodshed that he would not build the
[1:03:01] house
[1:03:02] but that his son Solomon would build the
[1:03:04] house
[1:03:05] and so therefore David was uh wanted to
[1:03:09] build a house for God but he couldn't so
[1:03:12] he did the next best thing
[1:03:14] he started to lay in store so that when
[1:03:17] it came time to build the house Solomon
[1:03:20] would have everything that he needed
[1:03:22] them to to build the house and he and he
[1:03:24] would have it in abundance
[1:03:27] now that's the natural house
[1:03:29] that's their natural house but there's a
[1:03:31] spiritual house and when Jesus laid up
[1:03:34] for us he did not lay up just Joy
[1:03:42] he gave us joy unspeakable amen glory to
[1:03:46] God
[1:03:47] he gave us joy unspeakable and full of
[1:03:50] Glory yes my brother
[1:03:56] but the thing that I really want to
[1:03:58] drive home because if you go back and
[1:04:00] you read where brother Branham was was
[1:04:02] building or or they would they had to
[1:04:05] rebuilt the Branham Tabernacle and it
[1:04:07] was in God in Simplicity and he's
[1:04:09] starting to show in there
[1:04:12] the building of it and he was talking
[1:04:15] about the masonry and he was saying how
[1:04:17] I I saw it on the blueprint and it
[1:04:20] looked just like a normal little old
[1:04:22] church it looked like just a normal
[1:04:24] building he said but when I got here and
[1:04:27] I and I started to look at it he was
[1:04:30] just talking about how how perfect it
[1:04:32] was and how wonderful it was
[1:04:34] how many has ever been out to the
[1:04:35] Branham Tabernacle
[1:04:38] quite a few quite a few
[1:04:41] is there anything fantastic about the
[1:04:43] brand of Tabernacle
[1:04:49] it's just a brick
[1:04:52] building
[1:04:54] but I challenge you go there and guard
[1:04:57] in Simplicity and read his account and
[1:05:00] you would thought it was the Taj Mahal
[1:05:10] the message that God wants to get across
[1:05:13] to you yes sir
[1:05:15] tonight yes sir
[1:05:17] give you a vision amen so that you can
[1:05:21] prepare a tabernacle for the almighty
[1:05:24] God Amen that's magnifico yes sir
[1:05:29] yes my brother
[1:05:32] is that what man calls great God calls

[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:25] glory to God
[1:09:30] we cry out for the Holy Spirit but the
[1:09:34] Holy Spirit isn't a bunch of knowledge
[1:09:36] the holy spirit is an anointing
[1:09:40] that gives you the same love the same
[1:09:42] peace the same joy that the rule that
[1:09:45] the the son of man himself had Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ
[1:09:53] now consider this with me for a minute
[1:09:56] John was baptizing
[1:09:58] in the Jordan
[1:10:01] and he looked up
[1:10:03] and he saw one walking towards him
[1:10:07] the lamb
[1:10:10] that was the second Adam
[1:10:13] Paul taught us that
[1:10:15] in the mail aspect
[1:10:21] it amazes me
[1:10:24] what gets taught here
[1:10:26] and then you listen to brother Chad Lamb
[1:10:29] and he's teaching a thing
[1:10:33] ain't it so
[1:10:35] and there's others too
[1:10:37] this is an anointing this is the
[1:10:41] teaching that Jesus said would come and
[1:10:44] it would be that actual teaching that
[1:10:47] would give us the preparation for the
[1:10:50] Rapture rapturing faith
[1:10:52] it would start the rapturing faith
[1:10:58] follow this with me I'm going to try to
[1:11:00] get it out the way the lord gave it to
[1:11:01] me
[1:11:03] he said
[1:11:04] when when Jesus came
[1:11:06] he came in the River Jordan which was
[1:11:10] death and we know he wasn't dying for
[1:11:12] his sin
[1:11:13] he was dying so that I could come here
[1:11:16] tonight and take communion with him
[1:11:19] I am not here based upon my
[1:11:21] righteousness
[1:11:22] I am here covered by his blood and
[1:11:25] thrusting that that that his
[1:11:27] righteousness has been invoked upon us
[1:11:32] and so he came to to the Jordan and
[1:11:35] there was Elijah standing in the Jordan
[1:11:38] to baptize the second Adam
[1:11:44] yes
[1:11:46] now consider this
[1:11:48] in the latter days
[1:11:51] God sent another Elijah anointing
[1:11:56] to baptize
[1:11:58] the I don't want to say second Eve
[1:12:01] the female aspect of
[1:12:05] of the second Adam
[1:12:09] in Jordan death to self
[1:12:12] are you with me so far
[1:12:15] by the washing of the water
[1:12:18] of the word
[1:12:20] and that's why the word that's coming
[1:12:22] out now
[1:12:24] is not just a a Baptist word or a
[1:12:28] Methodist word or or Pentecostal word or
[1:12:31] even uh another uh message uh uh idea of
[1:12:36] what brother Branham was trying to say
[1:12:38] not some man's idea
[1:12:40] this is the actual Mind Of God being
[1:12:44] poured out
[1:12:46] upon a special group of people
[1:12:49] and catching the vision we have got a
[1:12:52] desire to make a preparation so that
[1:12:55] when Jesus comes to to to change our
[1:12:58] mortal bodies to Immortal because we
[1:13:00] know that this mortality will put on
[1:13:02] immortality but how is the change going
[1:13:05] to take place
[1:13:07] there must be a spirit laying inside of
[1:13:10] us in order to affect that change and
[1:13:14] it's the same spirit that came down on
[1:13:16] the River Jordan yes on the Lord Jesus
[1:13:19] Christ and you remember when he came
[1:13:21] down he came down as a what
[1:13:23] he descended from Heaven as a dove
[1:13:28] and so we got the meekest bird
[1:13:33] coming down upon a lamb of God
[1:13:38] if it had been a wolf he couldn't have
[1:13:41] took it no sir he couldn't have stayed
[1:13:43] no so
[1:13:46] Lord help me
[1:13:48] there's so much
[1:13:50] there's so much to get
[1:13:54] but but now here we are in the last age
[1:13:57] and we are being baptized amen we are
[1:14:01] being baptized with the word of God Amen
[1:14:05] the Waters of Separation yes my brother
[1:14:07] we are being baptized in a in a word
[1:14:10] that literally separates takes away the
[1:14:15] desire for sin amen amen
[1:14:20] amen I don't mind telling you brothers
[1:14:22] and sisters
[1:14:24] since being in this assembly and hearing
[1:14:27] the words
[1:14:28] that have been coming across this Pulpit
[1:14:30] there are things that used to bother me
[1:14:33] they don't bother me glory to God
[1:14:38] it's gone
[1:14:40] [Applause]
[1:14:41] and I don't have to worry about waking
[1:14:43] up tomorrow morning and still having a
[1:14:46] temper
[1:14:47] still getting angry about dumb stuff
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:50] hallelujah hallelujah you say you said
[1:14:54] Brother Sam not you
[1:14:56] well I'd have sister Teresa come up here

[1:15:11] with ourselves amen
[1:15:14] I I don't want to be no hypocrite I
[1:15:17] don't wanna I am not standing here in my
[1:15:19] righteousness
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:24] I'm standing here for the hope that lies
[1:15:27] within me
[1:15:28] and I heard the Apostle Apostle of the
[1:15:31] Apostle say every per I think it was
[1:15:34] John said everyone that has this hope in
[1:15:37] him should purify himself even as he is
[1:15:42] pure
[1:15:43] amen amen amen amen
[1:15:47] now here's what we run into we we we
[1:15:50] tried to do a work for God
[1:15:52] and we're sincere in what we're trying
[1:15:54] to do and brother brother Branham said
[1:15:57] if the devil if if he can't get you to
[1:15:59] to to stop coming to church then he'll
[1:16:02] try to push you into a fanatic
[1:16:04] so what I'm trying to get across in this
[1:16:07] simple message tonight something that
[1:16:09] you can take home and chew with you in
[1:16:12] order to be magnifical in the eyes of
[1:16:15] God you just have to be ordinary

[1:16:57] we know that that uh well they give milk
[1:17:01] they're good Dairy Producers some
[1:17:03] countries depend on sheep for their for
[1:17:06] their Dairy
[1:17:07] but their main
[1:17:09] uh product that they produce
[1:17:12] is there wool
[1:17:16] what do they have to do to produce well
[1:17:26] let me just say this
[1:17:28] they have to follow the shepherd
[1:17:32] and he's going to lead you into Green
[1:17:34] Pastures
[1:17:36] by The Still Waters
[1:17:40] so brother Seth we're going to be able
[1:17:42] to both eat
[1:17:43] and drink
[1:17:47] we're gonna eat on the body word of the
[1:17:50] son of man
[1:17:51] [Applause]
[1:17:52] we're gonna drink his blood
[1:17:55] and we're going to be filled with his
[1:17:57] spirit
[1:17:59] and his spirit will make you jump it
[1:18:01] will make you shout it will make you
[1:18:04] dance but if you're proud
[1:18:07] I'm going to tell you right now you
[1:18:08] don't have his spirit
[1:18:10] I don't care how much you jump how much
[1:18:13] you shout if you're religious and you
[1:18:16] can't reach out to your neighbor and you
[1:18:18] can't help somebody that's down and out
[1:18:19] and you can't find somebody with purple
[1:18:21] hair
[1:18:26] and have the same feeling for their soul
[1:18:29] as you got for your own soul that I'm
[1:18:33] here to tell you you do not have the
[1:18:35] spirit of God you're nothing more than a
[1:18:38] Pharisee you're nothing but a sadducee
[1:18:41] and I'm gonna tell you you can always
[1:18:42] tell us sad you see because they're
[1:18:44] always sad
[1:18:48] Amen brother
[1:18:51] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:18:54] yeah
[1:18:55] oh man
[1:18:58] praise the Lord
[1:19:01] oh I want to tell you something
[1:19:04] this house we have
[1:19:07] is to be filled with joy and speaker
[1:19:11] it's to be filled with a peace that
[1:19:13] passes all understanding
[1:19:16] who can understand the peace that Paul
[1:19:18] and Silas had
[1:19:21] after they were beat
[1:19:23] whipped
[1:19:25] put in stocks
[1:19:28] and then they had the wherewithal not
[1:19:31] only to sing praises to God until the
[1:19:34] Holy Spirit came down and set him free
[1:19:35] but then the go find his adversary and
[1:19:40] preach salvation to his adversary
[1:19:47] how many would like a test of your Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost
[1:19:51] now don't raise your hands this is you
[1:19:53] don't have to you don't have to don't
[1:19:56] even Grim us don't don't don't don't
[1:19:57] just listen to this
[1:20:01] you'll give yourself away
[1:20:03] stay very blank faced
[1:20:09] now you know
[1:20:11] there's a person
[1:20:13] who's going to betray you
[1:20:18] you know that when this person betrays
[1:20:20] you you're going to go to your
[1:20:22] worst the most cruel punishment
[1:20:25] now this is the anointing that was on
[1:20:27] Jesus Christ
[1:20:29] the cruelest punishment that ever faced
[1:20:32] a human being
[1:20:34] crucified
[1:20:37] hung up on a cross
[1:20:39] naked
[1:20:41] before all men
[1:20:44] and you know this is gonna happen
[1:20:51] how many of you
[1:20:53] we'll get down on your hands and knees
[1:20:55] and wash his feet
[1:21:04] do we have the love of Jesus Christ
[1:21:07] This Love that loves the enemies is what
[1:21:11] we need to make our house magnifico
[1:21:20] you say what
[1:21:22] I'm going to admit to you brother Sam I
[1:21:23] don't know if I could do that
[1:21:25] you can't
[1:21:28] and neither can I
[1:21:31] that's why it's incumbent upon us to
[1:21:34] spend every moment every waking moment
[1:21:38] and commit every sleeping moment into
[1:21:42] the hands of the one who can
[1:21:45] not only can but he did turn with me to
[1:21:50] Luke chapter 6.
[1:21:53] this scripture
[1:21:55] revolutionized my heart when I first
[1:21:57] read it
[1:21:59] Luke chapter 6.
[1:22:06] and this word that's used in here for
[1:22:09] evil for evil I want you you'll see it
[1:22:12] when we get to it is the same word that
[1:22:15] John used over when he was talking about
[1:22:18] Cain who was the son of the wicked one
[1:22:22] so the word evil here is wicked one
[1:22:25] watch this
[1:22:31] six
[1:22:33] six
[1:22:36] let's start up here
[1:22:39] um
[1:22:41] with verse 32.
[1:22:44] for if you love them
[1:22:46] which love you
[1:22:49] what thank have you
[1:22:51] for Sinners also love those that love
[1:22:54] them
[1:22:57] and if you do good for those who do good
[1:23:01] to you
[1:23:02] what thank have you
[1:23:04] for Sinners also do the same
[1:23:06] and if you lend to them with whom you
[1:23:08] hope to receive
[1:23:10] well thank have you
[1:23:12] for Sinners also lend to Sinners to
[1:23:15] receive as much again
[1:23:17] but love ye your enemies
[1:23:21] and do good
[1:23:23] and lend
[1:23:24] hoping for nothing again
[1:23:27] and your reward
[1:23:29] shall be great
[1:23:31] Now read these words very carefully
[1:23:34] coming up here and you shall be
[1:23:38] not shall be called
[1:23:40] a lot of people read that says you shall
[1:23:42] be called it doesn't say that if this
[1:23:46] Spirit of loving your enemies is in you
[1:23:49] you shall be the children of the highest
[1:23:53] now are you following me now watch this
[1:23:55] for he is kind unto the unthankful
[1:23:59] that's right
[1:24:03] and to the evil
[1:24:06] that word there is literally the evil
[1:24:08] one that word for evil is wicked one
[1:24:12] he is kind to the wicked one
[1:24:16] if you want your make preparation
[1:24:20] make preparation look at I'm not here
[1:24:23] trying to tell you to be something that
[1:24:25] you're not
[1:24:28] all we want to do is we want to judge
[1:24:30] our
[1:24:33] growth
[1:24:34] and the word magnifical if you go back
[1:24:36] and read the definition of it it has to
[1:24:38] do with growth and with growing and so
[1:24:41] this is something that we're growing
[1:24:43] into and we do not want to be religious
[1:24:47] message
[1:24:49] people
[1:24:50] we want to be the Lamb of God not to
[1:24:55] come and take away the sin of the world
[1:24:57] but the Lamb of God that has our sin
[1:25:00] already taken away
[1:25:03] if we have our sin taken away then the
[1:25:07] same spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:25:10] will dwell in us and it's by that same
[1:25:14] spirit that will literally take this
[1:25:17] Mortal body
[1:25:18] and we'll make it Immortal and so shall
[1:25:21] we ever be with the Lord
[1:25:25] there's nothing nothing mysterious
[1:25:31] about this
[1:25:34] to a revelated ear
[1:25:36] lier
[1:25:37] let me say that again there's nothing
[1:25:39] mysterious about this to a revelated ear
[1:25:44] turn with me to Matthew 11.
[1:25:53] I didn't look what time I started
[1:25:54] brother Stephen
[1:25:57] maybe I should have
[1:26:04] verse 25.
[1:26:07] at that time Jesus answered and said I
[1:26:09] thank thee O Father
[1:26:12] Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:26:15] because you have hid
[1:26:18] these things from the wise and prudence
[1:26:21] and has revealed them unto babes
[1:26:25] that word revealed means that he just
[1:26:28] opened it up
[1:26:30] it's nothing difficult
[1:26:33] if I had a sculpture up here if if I had
[1:26:36] if I had this thing draped over with a
[1:26:39] drape and you didn't know what was on
[1:26:40] this board
[1:26:42] and then I come along and I pulled the
[1:26:44] sheet off
[1:26:45] and then you looked up there and you saw
[1:26:47] the writing it wouldn't be a mystery to
[1:26:49] you no more because somebody pulled it
[1:26:51] off
[1:26:54] friends it takes a a constant hunger to
[1:26:58] be in that word and to constantly be
[1:27:01] comparing your life to the life that's
[1:27:05] being described in that word and then
[1:27:08] when you can look in there remember
[1:27:09] brother Brown told the story about the
[1:27:11] Chinese laundromat
[1:27:13] and he would take that piece of paper
[1:27:15] and he would rip it this way and rip it
[1:27:16] that way and then he'd give half to in
[1:27:18] heaven
[1:27:19] so what it is is we've got the life of
[1:27:22] the Lamb of God that took away the sin
[1:27:24] of the world
[1:27:25] and it's clearly spelled out here in the
[1:27:27] Bible
[1:27:28] so now we take our life
[1:27:30] and we match it up
[1:27:35] and if it's not matching it doesn't mean
[1:27:38] you're not a seed of God
[1:27:40] it just means that you got to grow a
[1:27:42] little more
[1:27:45] so don't try to do some super duper
[1:27:50] just keep coming to church
[1:27:54] keep reading your Bible
[1:27:58] keep praying
[1:28:00] now look
[1:28:02] I'm getting ready to be finished let's
[1:28:04] turn over to Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:28:11] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:28:16] now while we're on this journey we we
[1:28:18] need some some good food
[1:28:21] good food and you know lettuce is good
[1:28:24] food
[1:28:28] you know why lettuce is good food
[1:28:30] it's got opium in it
[1:28:33] it makes you relax
[1:28:36] you're not nervous
[1:28:37] you're not tense
[1:28:40] I believe it makes us relax so much
[1:28:43] that the wolf could be right there
[1:28:46] remember the story brother Bram told
[1:28:47] about the Eagles the legal it's playing
[1:28:49] in the meadow the the wolf whatever the
[1:28:52] wolf was right there
[1:28:54] but those little eaglets wasn't one bit
[1:28:55] worried about him brother Brennan was
[1:28:56] wondering why aren't they worried
[1:28:59] and then he looked over and he said oh
[1:29:00] mama Eagle up there
[1:29:02] said if that if that uh wolf ever took
[1:29:04] after them I think it was wolf I can't
[1:29:06] remember exactly said if it ever took
[1:29:08] after those Eagles have Mama Eagle come
[1:29:10] down and flog that thing to death
[1:29:12] they had perfect confidence
[1:29:16] so let's see if we can find some lettuce
[1:29:19] here that'll help us out let's drop down
[1:29:21] to verse 10 22.
[1:29:25] these are simple instructions
[1:29:28] let us
[1:29:30] draw near with a True Heart
[1:29:33] and the full Assurance of faith
[1:29:35] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:29:38] conscience
[1:29:39] and our bodies washed with pure water
[1:29:43] let us
[1:29:45] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:29:48] without wavering
[1:29:50] for he's faithful that promised Amen Let
[1:29:54] Us consider one another
[1:29:56] we're a family
[1:29:58] we got to be here for each other
[1:30:01] we need to pray for each other
[1:30:05] if you see somebody going through a
[1:30:07] little bit of something
[1:30:11] don't shut them
[1:30:14] reach out to them
[1:30:16] be a friend
[1:30:19] you know
[1:30:21] there's a religious idea to this message
[1:30:24] and if it's somebody that's not like us
[1:30:27] we would that they're they're anakama
[1:30:30] but just remember inside of that little
[1:30:31] anathema there might be a seed of the
[1:30:34] Living God and brother Branham said how
[1:30:37] do you know if you don't go over that
[1:30:38] little Harlot along the road they're a
[1:30:40] little prostitute and say a kind word to
[1:30:43] her that you might find a
[1:30:46] donated seed in there that was just the
[1:30:49] reason that she's like that is because
[1:30:50] nobody loved her to begin with
[1:30:52] but then you start watering that with a
[1:30:55] little bit of personal touch and the
[1:30:58] water of the word and before you know it
[1:31:00] shall blossom in to a uh into a
[1:31:04] a child of the Living God amen amen
[1:31:09] let us hold fast
[1:31:11] uh the profession of our faith without
[1:31:14] wavering and let us consider one another
[1:31:17] to provoke one another to love and to
[1:31:19] Good Works
[1:31:21] read with me everybody not forsaking the
[1:31:25] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:31:28] manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:31:31] another and so much more as you see that
[1:31:35] day approaching amen God bless you very
[1:31:38] much amen

[1:36:24] I know that the Lord have given you the

[1:44:24] if any of you got issues with your
[1:44:25] denominations those denominations are
[1:44:28] not happy to see Jesus
[1:44:30] he was too wise to make a mistake too
[1:44:33] righteous to do any wrong they were not
[1:44:35] happy to see Jesus because in the
[1:44:38] beginning was the word the Word was God
[1:44:40] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:44:42] made flesh now now when the word is
[1:44:45] bringing down it's being performed right
[1:44:47] it's performing in the end time exactly
[1:44:50] what it's supposed to do now is
[1:44:53] unfolding and it's giving you you know
[1:44:55] what you're getting you have to realize
[1:44:57] how blessed you are
[1:45:01] you know I still have to minister just
[1:45:05] the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:07] in the institution they can't even see
[1:45:10] that
[1:45:15] you're talking about titles versus the
[1:45:19] name
[1:45:22] and your heart is heavy and there's so
[1:45:25] much that we're getting but I thank God
[1:45:27] he said at the Gold holy world just
[1:45:29] preach the gospel but the gospel don't
[1:45:32] come and let her only it got to come in
[1:45:34] power in demonstration so I'm able to
[1:45:38] tear down the religious demons is that
[1:45:40] right when you can hit the religious
[1:45:43] demon because we got the fullness of the
[1:45:45] word so you got to understand you're
[1:45:48] going to be challenged and you got to
[1:45:51] know where you stand at you got to know
[1:45:53] what you got you got to know who you are
[1:45:56] you got to know where you come from when
[1:45:58] you got a demon that come up to you and
[1:46:01] start telling people in inmates in the

[1:46:24] spirit of the Lord fell down and they
[1:46:27] know and Minister and I said every knee
[1:46:30] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[1:46:33] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:46:36] of God of the Gentiles is only going to
[1:46:39] answer to the Lord Jesus Christ I said
[1:46:42] right now bring Yeshua and I stand Here
[1:46:46] with Jesus Christ let's see which God be
[1:46:49] God
[1:46:49] [Music]
[1:46:53] yourself
[1:46:55] the real one
[1:46:57] it's a real war
[1:47:00] when Jesus went down to the pits of hell
[1:47:03] he had control of that he took the
[1:47:06] charge to them these demons why because
[1:47:09] people need to be set free is that right
[1:47:12] you're dealing with murder demons
[1:47:14] they're dealing with lots of demons
[1:47:16] you're dealing with pornography demons
[1:47:19] you're dealing with these students
[1:47:21] alcoholic demons you know you should see
[1:47:24] them cry
[1:47:25] when you go there with the gospel the
[1:47:28] good news
[1:47:29] when you tell a man uh and you look at
[1:47:31] his face and you say you did drugs you
[1:47:35] did alcohol
[1:47:36] you're stealing you do a a cocaine how

[1:48:06] have that Satan messing with your mind
[1:48:09] making you think why aren't you doing it
[1:48:11] now then you see a man and say spell
[1:48:14] your heads then you say who want to
[1:48:16] accept Jesus Christ as a personal Savior
[1:48:19] and you see the hands go up why nothing

[1:48:52] demanded who with them where Christ
[1:48:55] should be born and they said unto him
[1:48:58] Bethlehem or Judea for thus it is
[1:49:01] written by the prophet we go up here but
[1:49:04] he said let's turn back to uh
