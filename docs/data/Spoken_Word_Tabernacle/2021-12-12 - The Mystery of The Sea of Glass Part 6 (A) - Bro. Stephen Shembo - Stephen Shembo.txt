are reading their cod let me see your hand we got to do better amen before you bombard me with questions [Laughter] you make sure you got some answers quickly up there from the cod amen blessed be the name of the lord just to remind you on the 25th of this month which is the day of christmas we're not celebrating christmas if you need scriptures you go back to the old sermon in the hotel it was pretty loaded you're going to have all your quote all your scripture about christmas and you know we're not giving our own mind we're giving the word amen if you want to be nailed we can nail you in a scripture or we can nail you in a court or we can marry you in a book amen so you choose what you want but it's already been preached so on the 25th we will have the church workers dinner and that will be at three o'clock at brother robert's home brother robert wanted to host it and sister lorell so lord's willing there will be a message sent brother david might help me on that one give you the address at three o'clock we'll be there just to show an appreciation for the people who labors in a specific way amen when you get here the church is turned on the lights are turned on the carpet looks clean everything looks wide the bathroom looks good there is somebody doing all of that amen so we want to appreciate them and show them our gratitude that thank you very much for the label you have been doing for the kingdom of god amen that's on december the 25th amen on december the 21st which is going to be a friday we will have our new year's eve service here amen we will start at 8 o'clock it's a friday the 31st it's a friday to the best of my understanding so the 31st it will be it will start at 8 o'clock so we have ample time to sing to rejoice and to express the goodness of the lord because he has been so faithful he has been so good to us we went through fresco village second covey third covey and the lord is still gracious amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so if you have a problem with time just know we're going to celebrate the lord amen and for those that are local ministers lords willing we will give them 15 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes 15 minutes all of them will preach amen aren't you excited 15 minutes you labor you finish 15 minutes and depending if it's going really good then maybe we can increase a little bit amen so 15 minutes this one starts 15 minutes the second one thing so you're going to have sermon sermon sermon sermon amen and you pray with me i'm trying to pull some few people they don't even know who they are within the church [Applause] and i will pull them up and give them ten minutes and see what does the lord have inside of him and if the lord have a gift praise the lord we got a new preacher [Laughter] amen so don't play with my heather to try to figure it out who is those who are those persons do you know what play with mahi for me uh you need to do your homework oh somebody gave you a clue brother sam's gave you a clue it's in the story of simpson so you go ahead and you go listen read the bible and you find what does it mean to play with ether then you will understand my language i can give it to you but uh brother might help you up so brother sam you're gonna have a lot of young people around trying to figure it out what is playing with the heather amen so don't play with mahifa trying to find out can you tell us who are those people no their secret i will contact them myself and it's going to be a surprise for you we give them 10 minutes some will be trembling some will be shaking it will be a good exciting time amen 10 minutes go ahead and preach and as soon as they get here some will get on fire amen so don't get scared when people begin to say hey man [Laughter] at this point they're trembling i am not the one who put the gift in it i'm just trying to nurture and see where that is so we can line you up and prepare you and from there on your life is gonna change completely if it's vindicated it's confirmed your life change you cannot do what everybody else is doing you become a prisoner that's it you can post crazy stuff on facebook because brother stephen will come right after you [Music] your life is changed amen everything you're doing has changed somebody else can do it you cannot do it because you're standing right here amen so when you're standing right here your life must be pure amen because we don't want devils and that goes not only to the preacher he goes to the musician he goes to the church officer everybody must be into a certain category amen i would never never never lower the standard of the word to accommodate you amen never never either you meet the standard of the word if you feel like you cannot meet the standard of the word you can take a vacation in other words you can say brother stephen i'll argue with my wife and my temper is not good today i need to go home and ask my wife forgiveness and repent myself and consecrate my life and you clear everything good then you come back again and you start playing the instrument amen don't play the instrument when things are not correct don't sing if you know that you're not in line with the word and you're messing yourself up amen it's better for you to even sit to them to come and sing but when you sing you make sure everything is clean not in your eyes into the eyes of the lord amen so when you take the sin you confess them you put them under the blood then automatically regardless of how guilty you still feel or regardless of how bad things looks like you put your trust in the atonement into the sacrifice that's when you are feeling like now i'm approaching you not that i'm worthy to approach you but i'm singing because of your grace i am playing the instrument because of your grace i am preaching because of the earth because of your grace because the black dog is still fighting you amen so that goes from everything everybody deacon trust is everybody i would never lower the standard amen if the standard is 10 you are seven push for forward get to 10. if you feel like you cannot get to 10 you say but stephen i feel like i need to fix certain stuff in my life correct it and then i will get back i will respect you more amen i will respect you more and the people will respect you more because you are understanding the sacredness of the work of the lord amen i'm not going to play the instrument now let me sit down and then pray tomorrow i'm coming back don't sit down and go forever that's another problem because god put the gift you not the author of the gift god have a right his sovereign will to do what he want to do with the gift he placed on you so you cannot tell god what to do with your gift it is up to you to surrender to god and let god use it so if you are the man you don't stay out of the line for a long time because god needs you you're missing your spot if you don't he's going to tighten up things and whip you very hard until you understand and come back so in other words what i'm saying it would be quick to repent the bible say what branham said the zeal of this age is what is water repent you did something wrong repent put everything back in line and go back to the that's the just you we fell get back up and then we keep moving that's a child of god amen so don't try to be perfect perfect no just be you be christian if something is out of line correct and move on if you feel like i'm not you back up a little bit take a break prepare yourself realign and move forward with a faster and a stronger determination that i'm going to do better than before that's how christian operates don't worry about what people are saying don't worry about who is looking at you at the church because you're gonna get caught up into a trouble trying to please people amen don't try to please people let everybody say what they want to do as long as you know that you and god are in line that's it that's all that's all don't try to do something to please brother benjamin you're wasting your time your family will be made manifest don't waste your time like that always check yourself with the word with the word with the word with the word and the more you move you move you're going to get better amen in other words i'm shooting for perfection amen amen you want to learn my way it's not easy paul say that i tighten my body very hard amen because there is a work to do amen so don't be lazy if you got whipped just stand up and move forward it will make you better if you want to be a good saver of money come let me sit with you i'm going to tighten you pretty good until you feel like you're choking but when you check your bank account you will see money coming up like this there's two ways either you want to continue the way you want to do and keep spending spending spending and credit card and debt and all kind of stuff or you want to be help but they help sometime take a rough training amen if you see people in this life successfully go sit with them they're more rigid than you think they wake up so early than you think while you're still sleeping they're already on the stock market you're the one sleeping snoring they're already making money amen and when they sleep you are still there waking up because of lack of discipline amen so we love you it's a pastor [Laughter] [Applause] that one came in and using a lot so we got the 20 fifth already we got the 31st by god's grace you might have to listen to this step to get all the dates correct because it's going to be a lot a lot of data amen and then our next house meeting will be on january the 22nd we want to leave this month alone because of all the holidays and the people traveling and everything left and right end of the year we just leave this calm so we will be we will resume back on january the 22nd at 3 p.m as far as the sister is still open for any sister who want to handle it amen you know the system everybody can do it whoever want to feel like they want to handle it they want to cook they have their menu it's still open you can see the deacon and the deacon will go ahead and handle that it will be at three o'clock that's our question and answer amen the 25th church workers dinner 31st to 8 o'clock our new year's service we will have communion and food washing amen okay so we start at 8 o'clock and january the 22nd we will get the next house meeting for the youth the sisters i already met with the brothers they put up the stuff together and if you need more time brothers you need to get back every time you need a meeting you need to go back to the deacon and talk to them and arrange everything with the deacon and the deacon will put it up and then we meet you send me a question the subject you want to talk about it and we will sit down and move on i'm still waiting on some material about uh and trip had to be a businessman owner and things like that that i want to sit down with the young people and stretch their mind a little bit to how you can be free and not depend on a paycheck all the time amen the way we are geared is go to work go to school go to go to school but you're still an employee you're still an employee there's ways you can free yourself from not being an employee and not everybody is supposed to go to school some people are not meant for school they can you can do something else in life and be successful and move on amen so i'm still waiting for the material and i will get the coat and everything and put it together and sit back again with the young man and give you that material amen so as far as the young sister it's your responsibility to go see the deacon talk to them you put up your own meeting with the sisters only and the deacon and the wife of the deacon or one of the trustees wife or somebody who's going to be available we dare to have the meeting everybody here so far so if we don't have a meeting it's not my fault it is your fault here if you didn't listen to the sermon it's not my fault it's on youtube it's your fault never have your blood on mum'hand amen now let's stand and go to the world we have quite a territory to cover my friend and this subject keep unfolding and i don't know what to do i have to follow the leadership of the holy spirit sometime you might see me going off a little bit i'm trying to reach a certain point to drop to the airport so we're not doing this to linger the time is short we only have two services a week we don't even have a sunday night service so if we can give a lot of sacrifice we will try the best also not to worry you but we gotta do what we got the hour is late we gotta go into the rapture there is a lot of questions there is a lot of stuff and we gotta get busy amen so we don't intend to keep you longer but if you want go to bed on time on saturday go to sleep on time don't go to bed at 2 a.m and you're the one complaining in church because we're staying an hour because you didn't sleep well so go to bed stop texting at 2 am go to bed wake up early fresh and you're ready for the lord okay you will say a man one day [Music] it's a family so i got used to you let's go to genesis chapter 17 so we try the best and when i felt checked by the holy spirit that you full i stop then you go home throughout the week and chew it and then you come back again then we move on again and fill it up so we're not going to try to wear you off but by the same talking we just need to balance a little bit especially on sunday we only have one service so at the evening if you want to go cook you can cook it evening if the children are going to school they're going to go to school tomorrow morning so you have all the time to go do the stuff amen but i will try my best i have coat but i leave it alone i have quote i just leave it alone genesis chapter 17 verse 18. if you dare you can say a man brother david is my voice okay okay is that can everybody can hear me okay yeah uh okay no problem i need to bless the devil verse 18 if you dare you can say amen and abraham said to god oh that ishmael might live before you in other words abraham is pleading for ishmael so we found here abraham is pleading for his son ishmael you might be seated and god say verse 19 yes that's what i was looking for brother david thank you that's what i was looking for yet sounds like a bazooka now now and god says sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed and you shall call his name isaac so abraham is pleading for ishmael because it's his own blood but god direct abraham to a different son whose name is isaac amen so now we found the second seed of abraham okay all right you've grown up now you can get it abram it's ishmael abraham is isaac but still the bloodline the natural line is the same man okay but two title okay cool sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed and you shall call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seeds [Music] everybody okay anybody okay so isaac is not the seed hey with his seed singular after him so the covenant is given through isaac but now in the isaac there is another seed coming up everybody here let's go to verse 20 hallelujah and as for ishmael i have heard you behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly have princes shall he father and i will make him a great nation but outside the covenant [Music] so the blessings doesn't mean that god is with you verse but in other words regardless of everything i'm doing to ishmael but my covenant will establish with isaac which sarah shall bear to you at this set time in the next year in other words regardless of how ishmael is your son regardless of his your bloodline or whatever you claim i'm gonna bless him but my work is through isaac everybody clear let's go to genesis 25th blessed be the name of the lord genesis 26 you need to keep your bible oh genesis chapter 25 i'm sorry thank you i was talking to brother chad one time he said well stephen the people say we go faster they don't understand we are loaded so much and with a few times and you're trying to get everything coming up sometimes you seems like you're going ahead amen genesis chapter 25 verse 1. if you're there you can say amen then abraham took a wife and her name was keturah over here it's hagar everybody knows that right over here is who i like that i want to hear the voices of the young people more versus the older amen thank you thank you then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah and she bought him zimran one and junction two and medan three and median four and ishbak five and sure six we found six children from keturah amen amen okay okay no problem abraham got married to keturah if you look at the previous chapter it was before after the death of sarah abraham have no intent to marry hagar abraham was not a polygamist [Applause] okay okay abraham was not a polygamist if you have that problem we need to fix you up but i'm saying marriage and before go listen to marriage and divorce let's go to verse three and jok some father sheba and diden and the sons of didn't were asharam and later shem and lehmann and the sons of media and ifa and effer and henoch and abadia abida and elder all these were the children of keturah these are the grandchildren watch verse five and abraham gave all that he had to everybody okay anybody okay why did abraham do that he's not fur why he understood god told him my covenant is gonna be away that is the hair anybody abraham gave all that he had to isaac so what about the other children verse six but the sons of the concubines the bible called them concubines you see now you see now concubines polygamy polygamy okay but the sons of the conquerments which abraham had abraham gave what remember ishmael got blessed also right abraham gave them gifts but not the not the inheritance amen that's why don't be intimidated when you see outside denomination having gifts when you see them speaking in tongues when you see them prophesying that's okay god can give them gifts but the inheritance they cannot have it because the seed will not hair with the shack [Applause] god bless ishmael but they have to send ishmael away don't get intimidated you gotta know who you are verse six but the sons of the conquer man which abraham had abraham gave gift and did water i thought that was his bloodline what did they do to ishmael you see now separation not division okay and send them away from isaac his son the separation is to leave the seed to grow very well get them off amen amen because when ishmael was there he began to cause trouble to isaac and sarah saw it he said this seed need to grow up a different way get him off they got six other abraham look he learned from there he said you you go far you see the country over there go over there stay away amen but it's his seed so by blood they can tell you we are the children of abraham but they are not two children and send them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward to the east country everybody okay let's go to isaiah 53. so from here you can understand that when we speaks about the natural seed of abraham the heat there is category everybody okay usually when we say the natural seed of abraham we say the jews the natural seed of abraham have category amen he can be ishmael he can be isaac or he can be the children of keturah these two were thrown away only one stays because god say in isaac isaiah 53 let's go to verse 6. if you dare you can say amen oh we like sheep have gone astray all of us regardless amen we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of ours all so all the crazy stuff we did they took it and put it upon somebody who didn't do anything amen verse seven he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth tongue he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth regardless of what they were posting on facebook regardless of how many stories they were telling wrong about him he just didn't open his mouth he opened his mouth when they asked him about who he was amen amen you need to learn that young people quick send him a text quick check send him a text who are you to be sending people texts you might send the text block him don't play with me block so they don't receive water coming from you because you know what fire you put in you saw something wait for the return amen he was taken from prison and from judgment verse 8 and who shall declare his what so this man who took the iniquity of us all who was afflicted who didn't open his mouth has a generation these are known men these unknown men carry a generation do you remember me telling you we will talk one day on the missing generation you remember depending on the time let's see he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken the question is who will declare this generation who's going to introduce who will make us know this generation we want to know his generation let's go to roman 2 then we will pray roman chapter 2 verse 28 very familiar scripture especially to this church if you dare you can say amen verse 28 for he is not a jew which is on which is one outwardly so when we talk about somebody being a jew paul is showing you something here he said there is a jew who can be outwardly desert words speak of the body hey marquee which speaking of what is natural we're speaking about about the natural blood anybody here he said one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh so there is a circumcision right here of the flesh which is the body have a circumcision blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah but verse 29 he is a jew which is one inwardly so now there is a second category offered you you can be a jew on the outside or you can be a jew on the inside on the inside we know we're speaking about the soul and the spirit and he's speaking about the spiritual amen and there is also a spiritual blood amen but this circumcision is of the heart amen amen amen hallelujah but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the water so we're talking about the soul here everybody so you can be circumcised in the body and go to hell oh you can be circumcised in the soul and not circumcise in the body and go to heaven that's why paul told the galatians he said oh you foolish gallatin you start here you want to go back here again this was a type of something in the future amen the circumcision is that of the heart in the water and not in the letter the law whose praise is not of water but of water this circumcision here give glory to god the circumcision here give glory to man that's the pharisees circumcision when they go everybody will know that i am this this this versus a circumcision that give glory to god amen blessed be the name of the lord turn with me to isaiah 32 and let's pray so you will have that scripture handy when we get there isaiah 32 and let's pray if you get there you say amen isaiah 32. brother branham used chapter verse 1 and 2 when he preached letting off the pressure when he was talking about the city of refuge let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for giving us an opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour with the people of like precious faith lord i have done what any man that you have given ability can do this is all i can do when it comes to blessing your people interpreting your word lord father and giving a revelation to your children it's a work of the holy spirit that's why i'm asking that you move me completely out of the way may you speak to your children lord may you bless us be the beginning and the ending lord the alpha and the omega may the devil coronavirus whatever is bordering your people may everything be sealed out of this place may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord be seldom in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you i believe everybody should be on board with what we preach on wednesday we're on part six and we're still handling with uh talking about the priesthood amen now when we talked about the sea of flavor we found out that the sea of flavor is connected to the priesthood everybody i was wondering it is connected to the priesthood is connected to the priesthood to the fact that that sea of lever helped the priests wash the hand and wash their feet we pulled foot washing from there he helped the priests watch the sacrifice which we pulled the water baptism from there and then also in exodus chapter 40 we found out that not only were the feet and the hand of the priest washed all the sacrifice washed but before a priest enter into his office the priest himself must be washed completely but here these verses here have a lot of stuff going on we talked about moses already who was watching the high priest and his children we talk about the level itself and we lord's willing we will talk about the anointing that came upon the high priest and the children and we will also talk about the holy government everybody clear so far but let's handle the priesthood as we're moving forward when we talk about the priesthood we ended up with melchizedek amen because the lever when we look at the lever he only gave us the information about foot washing about here he gave us the information about water baptism but we were missing communion everybody but the priesthood have to be introduced here on the level and when we hit the levitical priesthood we found out that the levitical priesthood was only a shadow of the tree priesthood and when we are entering the tree priesthood of melchizedek anybody care we found out that that three priests that uh true priesthood opened up with a man called melchizedek or a personality called mercy memorial kizzadek and that personality is a king and he was also a priest and he brought abraham bread and wine everybody here which was communion so we got our three ordinances from there foot washing water baptism and we got communion right here everybody then we found also with melchizedek there is an everlasting power or an everlasting life he has no beginning of days no ending of life he's a man that ever lived forever and he's still there amen and under mercy merchandise also we learned about the paying of tithing anybody care and under melchizedek also his name have a double or a compound meaning he is king of selem which is talking about the righteousness and he is also king shalom or king of peace hey marquis but the problem is when we spoke about the levitical priesthood we found out who was the high priest of the priesthood it is very important to understand who is the high priest because the high priest is the one that first started everything else here and the high priest not only is he the first one to start something but the high priest is the one who make a way or who open up the way or who open up the road for his children ever here you cannot watch the children of the high priest before the high priest you have to start first with the high priest anoint the high priest dress the high priest and whatever was done to the high priest first is going to make a way all up in the way for the children of the high priest to go through the same process here because when israel was giving the atonement on the day of yom kippur everybody here the entire nation was looking at the high priest here if the high priest entered the holy of holies the holy of holies if the high priest succeed there then the sins of the people are completely taken off but if the high priest died there something is wrong so the the the salvation or the atonement of the entire nation lies on the shoulder of the high priest here and once the high priest is accepted he comes out from the holy of the holiest and he pulled what they call a trumpet like a like a ram horns and he brought the trumpet and that trumpet is the trumpet of jubilee and that trumpet of jubilee is telling everybody who was enslaved no matter the time no matter the circumstances no matter the problem when you hear that trumpet you can drop what you are doing and you can go back again to your inheritance even if you hold you owe your master a million dollars that's no more a problem if the jubilee trumpet sound you are debt free completely ever here you can go back for free and that jubilee lies on the high priest here so when we enter into the melchizedek priesthood we found out that melchizedek is a priest the bible say melchizedek a priest the bible did not say melchizedek a high priest everybody here so if this melchizedek he is a priest who is the high priest anybody here because it's important to know the high priest because once we know the high priest we know who can take our responsibility on his shoulder everybody but the understanding of the high priest brought us to first check the seed anybody here so far put your seatbelt because we're heading into some other uh territory the bible the bible says this we spoke about this on wednesday after the jews refused and rejected paul this is what happened for i could wish that myself were a curse for christ we know why paul said that if you listen to the sermon on wednesday you understand it for my present my kids men according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pretend the adoption that was the package god brought them and the glory and the covenant and the giving of the law and the service of god
