Psalms and I was read I was looking at the and also Samuel looking at David whenever he went he was always happy to go to the house of the Lord and when he came to worshiping God he would always worship with all his might and when I was thinking about that I was like well if David at his time if he would take him to bring him to our time and then we would have like let's say a worship um competition or whatever I truly believe that us would be able to out worship David amen mainly because of the Revelation that we have is greater than the one that he had amen now if we could all go to our scripture I also want to thank the pastor although he's not here for giving me this it's a privilege to be here before the body of Christ amen and I pray that God may be with him if we could all go to Matthew chapter 16:13 now the Bible says in Matthew 16:3 says when Jesus came into the coast of kariah kesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do man say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some say Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bjah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven Lord Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus Christ I come before you so you may take me out of the way and just use me Lord God I pray Lord Jesus Christ that the treasure that you put Within Me Lord Jesus Christ that you may bring it out so he may speak and not me Lord Heavenly Father Lord Heavenly Father the hours have come the hour has come for you to speak Lord God I all I did my part Lord Jesus Christ was was reading the scripture and I pray that you may take control and and I pray Lord heavenly father that you may be with my pastor and brother Freddy where they are Lord heavenly father and protect them Lord Jesus Christ so they may come over here I B Remain the service unto you in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen you may be seated now my subject for tonight would be the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer because the f um the full sentes when in the church age if you look at it it says the importance of a revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized and that's what I will be speaking today and to start off in the exposition Church age exposition of the seven Church ages it says the time is at hand the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom of the economy of God this Mighty Revelation thou fully know to th th fully known to God could not could not though fully known to God could not come forth heither to thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of God for each Age come in that age only and at a specific time look at the history of Israel the revelation of God to Moses came only at the specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried onto God Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of God of the godhead and in this age Lan the revelation of God will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today and if you notice it said that the Revelation when the revelation of God when he came to Moses he came when the people cried and if you look throughout the seven Church ages there was a period of time where the Chris were being persecuted and it said the fullness of the Revelation the fullness of God will come and it came only after the people cried out after the Christian were persecuted and at the last age the fullness of it had came now in Revelation brother Brenham said he typed it to a sculpture when a sculpture draws um when a sculpture takes a statue or a drawing that he has done and after he covers it up and after reveals it again that's what brother brandham tpes it as a revelation because it is revealing what is hidden and he also in the church ages if you read your books as brother step says read your church age books if you read it a revelation is not something that could just be explained or taught through teaching although studying and teaching are good what your teachers your pastors and all teachers you are good but the revelation of Jesus Christ of who Jesus Christ is that has to be revealed to you by God and it's an individual revelation it's not just something that you learn off of someone else it's something that comes to you personally in the in 54 the seven Church ages it says blessed is he that reth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now the scripture gives us a start here it is the Revelation or the word revelation means something that's revealed the revelation of Jesus Christ given given to John and an angel was sent to Bear record or to signify it you have to get you have to you have to get the spirit of God or say or you say I can't understand how people say amen get in the spirit once that's right because a lot of people will be in church and some won't understand why other people are shouting praising rolling and all that and over here it says that if you want to understand why people do that you have to get into the spirit of God you have to be in the presence of God so you can feel and sense what they're feeling amen and it says that the um in Exposition Church it says the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really carnal how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he deny the Lord Jesus Christ and cursed while doing it God cannot build his church upon any man born in in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hollowed the ground at the spa and it isn't as the pro the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the Revelation read it the way it is written flesh and blood that Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father have revealed it and Upon This Rock which is a revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation on they th save the Lord now as I was reading this and uh when I reached the point where it says that it wasn't built upon Jesus I was a b puzzled that was like but because when you read it it says read it as it is and if you read it as it is it says Flesh and Blood he has not revealed it to you then it says it was my father who has revealed it to you and he said Upon This Rock because rock is revelation but which Revelation was it because it said this Revelation which was the revelation of Jesus Christ so I decied to ask um my Bishop because I remember Sunday when he said that a bishop is someone since he's our Bishop we supposed to come to him and seek for help you know and me as a Christian as a Believer when you give out your word like that you give a promise I will take it and I will hold you to it now the thing is when it came to the Revelation I asked him about it so he sent me quotes and um citations when I looked at it then I remember Paul has said that if any man come to you and preach to you a different gospel than the one that he preached to you if he preach to you a different Jesus than the one that he preached you then let him be a curse let it be a lie you see and when I started looking at that and um listening to also what my Bishop had told me it was that because many people also believe in Jesus Christ many people believe in the physical Jesus Christ and it's not the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not just Jesus Christ or the man Jesus Christ but it's the godhead of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ is the godhead itself you see and the and the prophet says in 1916 in the Patmos Vision it says the greatest of all Revelation that mean there's no greater Revelation the greatest of all Revelation is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get the first base until you believe that walk out that's what Peter said repent repent and then see the deity be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then you you're ready to go in the spirit see it says you're ready to go in the spirit you can only go in the spirit after you repent and be baptized and after it will be revealed onto you you see the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ I am the Alpha and the Omega I am the A to Z there is no more but me I was at the beginning I'll be at the end and um and it says I'm he that was which is and shall come the mighty think of it what the trumpet said but he said these I am going to direct you to send this message that I show you who is I'm the first and the last the the Supreme one I'm the almighty one and I have come to tell you that I'm giving you a message to seven churches I want you to write it get it ready see the seven churches are in Asia now they were churches there then with the nature in them that represent these Church ages today see it says that the greatest Revelation there is is the revelation of Jesus Christ and and as because I remember um what's it called as I was meditating because when it comes to the the deity of Jesus Christ that's like one of my favorite Parts in the Bible to like break it down and know about it and how it says that I the one that was in eternity and brother Brandon had also said that God himself is eternal God himself is eternity and and there's many things hidden into there and just by understanding that Revelation you would know you would know like so many things you could do with that Revelation because when something is revealed to you that mean like I said when when my pastor came over here and said oh he's a bishop then we supposed to go to him and ask him him a question when he brought that to me and I understood that I caught that Revelation I went to him and asked him a question now if you understand the revelation of who Jesus Christ is that means when the Bible comes in and tells you that you are God's and you are connected with him youall become one with him that mean you know exactly what Jesus Christ did what is Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ that mean you you'll be able to find who are you and what are you you see that's why I want to talk about the true a True Believer the part of the true believer it says now to be a true Christian you have to be the same the same as what the same as God we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice he is in me and I in him notice every Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him was with him when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for Joy before their was a foundation of the world we were identified in The Immortal Realm with God 10 Millions years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him because if you look the definition of etern Eternity or Eternal it's something that doesn't have a beginning nor end that mean if you have eternal life in you that mean you also don't have a beginning that mean when God was eternal when he was Elohim you were in him you were his attribute inside him you see and and I was identified with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy now over here it says in 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam says look Christ in you makes him the center of revelation of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing you see and see God is trying to do see what God is trying to do what is the new birth you'd say well brother brandom what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see you don't have the new birth until you get that personal revelation see you can't even even when you go um you go take the baptism of the Holy when you go take the baptism of water you're not going to receive the Holy Ghost until you get that spiritual Revelation by the spirit of God himself God has to reveal it to you and once he reveal it to you that's when he's going to step into you also you see not not you joined the church you you shoke a hand you done something different you say decreed you promise to live by a code of rule Christ the the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ pastor Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that church was built upon the new birth is Christ is a revelation God God has revealed to you this great mystery that's the new birth and the thing about a True Believer because a lot of people ask themselves what are a True Believer and sometimes you could be leaving in the world because lately we've been um going through the the um our divine record and our Earthly record and if you rely too much because a friend of mine had asked me um what makes you so special than everybody else and I was like because he he likes accusing me of um being a narcissis so he asked me what makes you different than everybody else and I was like well what makes me different than everybody else is the fact that I'm me because me being me makes me different then he ask me what why do you have so much confidence why are you so confident and I was like as I was typing he was like and don't say God and I was like if you remove God out of the equation why would I be confident about because God is the center of my life God is what makes me confident you know when whenever I'm facing through trials God is the same he's the person that gives me the strength to go forward and move forward amen because if I if I were to rely on my on my Earthly record because like we have Americans we have uh Africans and all that I remember I was with um one of my friends at the store and my friend we were talking and after man came in he was also African and I could tell he was African when he he walked in then he was looking my friend because my friend is African and he was looking at me it's like he couldn't tell what am I if I was American or African so he started talking to my friend while undermining me was still staring at me and as he walked away my friend started laughing he was like these people don't understand they're looking at you they're like they they can't understand if you're African or Christian I mean if you're African or um American and when I'm in front of Americans sometime they're like I thought you were American and sometime they're like well I could tell you're African and when I'm with um congales they're like well you're an American now but that's besides the point if I had to rely on those I won't I wouldn't even have an identification you see but when I rely on my eternal when I rely on my eternal my heavenly record that mean I can always tell them that I am Christian they can always tell that I'm Christian they don't have to question if I am a Christian or not you see and the power of transformation because the other thing about Revelation the Revelation also brings the Rapture you know because the Rapture itself is a revelation and even if you look back in two Sundays ago when the pastor was preaching he had said something he had said that the Rapture is a revelation to us but to the world is just waiting to be manifested and I remember I was pondering upon that and I was like the the Revelation brings a Rapture and I will get into that now brother brandham over here says that to be transformed which is like the translation to be transformed to be changed is to be changed and made something different like a tadpole it's transformed from a tadpole to a frog see once he look like a catfish he swims around he got a head and his tail and everything looks just like a fish like a catfish then after a while he begins to lose he loses his tail and he transformed from one species to another you see a True Believer when they're growing in their faith they're growing in their walk and they're receiving Revelation as as the more they grow the more they're being transformed you see they're losing parts of them until one day they will transform into a new species a they would have their theophany because theophany is like a whole different species you see different than the one that we are right now we'll be one with God now in spiritual Amnesia 1964 the prophet of God says I was mostly sure with him at Calvary I must identify I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a place that where not also was I identi ified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian must die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him at Calvary you can't be none of his you see I was there when he died I died with him and I was there with him when he raised up from the dead I came up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatsoever he did I was right there with him every believer was the same you see even back in eternity we was with him you see even when he became flesh we were with him also and now I find myself in this last days with the many with the many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry he said the same yesterday today and forever I find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing it walking with it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same the same thing you see that's why I had said when my Bishop had said something I grab it and the Bible said the same thing that he did we will do also and anything that God said because the Bible says Jesus prayers are yay and amen you see everything he prays everything that he says happens his word cannot return to him void that mean if he says that every work that he done you shall also do if you just hold on to that that mean it will come to reality you see and he say you must identify yourself with him now in the exposition of the seven Church ages again it says Christ is the true church is the true church is Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into to the church and Def follow make it look warm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his work attempted to destru attempted destruction of God's people and the dis discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cting into the Lake of Fire he fights that he can't stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and and that she can do the greater the Greater Works she will be an invisible Army if they get a true revelation of the true Spirit within the framework of the of the Christian Church By God's discernment and withand and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before him before her because the Revelation what the Revelation does is just it's it's like an Awakening because it's someone that's um someone that's sleeping in a sense because when someone is sleeping you're basically powerless there's nothing you can do but when you're awake that's when you can actually do work you see and when something is revealed to you um like usually I like to tell my brother everything that I can do I truly believe you can also do the exact same thing physically everything that I can do you can also do it now if that if what I say to him does if he doesn't receive the revelation of what I say to him that mean I could be doing something and to him it would be like that's beyond me I can't do what he's doing that mean to certain Christians when God came and said everything that I do you can do also the reason why they can't do it is because they have not received that personal revelation to themselves because if they received that personal revelation to them themselves they will also be doing the Greater Works they will also be doing what Jesus did and greater you see and it says no man knows the things of God say the spirit of God and he and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real most people it is still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our own by our Union with Jesus Christ see that mean without without us God is Not righteous God cannot be righteous without us that's what it says that's what it's saying over here that mean we're the very righteousness of God by God coming down and saving us that made him righteous you see did you did you get it it says we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ you see it says that he Jesus came in sin for us it doesn't say that he became sinful but became sin for us that by our Union with him we might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact and we must and he literally came he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the Revelation but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it is just it's just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us and that will take a revelation you see like I said a revelation is something that will awaken you a revelation is something that will make you know who you are are because if you know you're the righteousness of God and you're traveling through trials and and you're suffering you wouldn't just be down and beat and whatever you will go to God you say God you came down to save me so why am I still going to trial you would tell God that you said that you were made righteousness because of me so you need to come down and take care of me you see and it says in the exposition Church it says but when the church disbel Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell can Prevail against her and in this Revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that Satan hates the Revelation that's why he he always tries to block your Revelation through television through distractions through little minor things that keep popping up Satan that's how Satan's block and keeps a hold of a child of God you see because a revelation because if a Christian because there's many things that I used to he when when people say that oh your uncles cursed you and stuff like that you see as long as you're in the right order as long as you're right with God you see as long as you're right with God doesn't matter if your uncle curses you or even if your father curses you you see it's not going to work the only time it will work is if you accept it as such but if you have the revelation of who you are that mean you're not one you're not going to accept if you have the revelation of who you are and when you have that revelation of who you are and you don't accept it that's not going to happen like brother Brenham said a pardon is only a pardon if you accept it just like the Revelation a revelation is like a pardon to a Believer you see and when people are sending curses your way and stuff if you have the revelation of who you are you will deny it automatically you're not going to let them affect you automatically because there's many people nowadays that that will automatically just say certain things to you or say oh well you can't do this you can't do that who are they to say you can't do this because the Bible says only God judges the Christian only God judges among the gods you see now earlier I was talking about how the Rapture the translation is a is a revelation you see and when I was reading in the Book of Revelation it says I in the spirit on the Lord's day because the Lord's Day is when God himself comes you see and what happened Paul um John entered into the spirit and when he entered into the spirit that was a type of rapturing because he had raptured and he was being revealed what uh what is to come you see and heard behind him a great voice of the trumpet to him to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in the throne even as I I also overcame and am set down with the father in his throne and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne see the importance of a revelation the reason why Revelation is so important because sometime when you read scriptures like this you say the throne when you go sit in the throne and you're like how can two people sit in one Throne you see but when you look back when brother Brandon was preaching and he said that God himself is Eternal God himself is eternity and you will even find certain part brother BR said that the seven Dimension is eternity the seven Dimension is God himself that mean when you go sit down in the throne what happened is the moment you sit down you're slide you're sliding into eternity you're you're automatically going to a different dimension you're going into God because God is eternal and that's why when people come in and they try to look for you once you slay into eternity they cannot find you why because you're in a different dimension than they're in you see that's why even when witches and Sorcerers when they come seeking for you and they're trying to catch you as long as you're within the Revelation as long as you're within Christ which Christ is eternal they will not be able to see you because spiritually you have entered into that seven dimmension spiritually you have entered into Christ into eternity so when they're looking at you they cannot see you all they see is God himself just like when John went up in heaven and was looking at the throne he was like there's no man worthy in heaven or on Earth or under the Earth there's no one worthy to take the book but within that Throne within eternity came out the Lamb of God who took the book you see rad undetected on radar and the same thing in because the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation are like parallel to each other you see and when I was looking at that also it says that he also went up in the spirit and he said then I lifted up my eye and looked and behold a certain man clothed in fine lenen whose loin were we find we find gold of you see and if you look at Revelation you look at Daniel you'll see that everything that Daniel was doing John was also going through the same thing and watching the same vision that mean if John going into the spirit was a type of rapture that mean when Daniel also lifted up his eyes he was also in he was also raptured his Spirit was raptured you see he was raptured by Revelation you see and in 1916 the Patmos Vision says be careful John you've entered into the spirit something something's going to to be revealed to you what is it a trumpet sound the first thing I am Alpha and the Omega the first of all Revelation that's why the Bible says that he is he Upon This Rock that mean he's the foundation the first of all Revelation he's the foundation of all Revelation and that's why it's also the greatest that's why the brother BR has said it's the greatest of all Revelation oh sinner bow repent now before the time is too late I'm I'm Alpha and Omega that's the first thing that he let him know who he was who's who's this approaching is this King Jesus king god king Holy Ghost he said I am all of a I am from A to Z I am the beginning and end and I am the immortal Eternal God you see just a little later we watch him in his Sevenfold person personage watch what he is then I am the beginning and the end I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last I was before there was a first and after there was no there's no more last I'll still be there in other words the first and the last and I was see concerning this one when it says that God is the first and the last he is eternal he's Immortal and the scripture where it says you are you are Gods when God when God say you are God doesn't matter even if you're like. 1% of God even if you're like 1% of God see if God is eternal right because if you take 1% of 10 it's like 0.1 if you take 1% of 100 it's 10 you see but if you take 1% of infinity it's still Infinity you see if you take 1% of Eternity it's still eternity that mean doesn't matter how you look at it you're still God regardless because some people when you tell them you are God they're like no I am not God but 1% of Eternity is still God 1% of God is still God you [Applause] see now in Revelation 5 it says that no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look upon it because and I WEP much because no man was found worthy to open open the open and to read the book neither to look thereon and I beheld and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne out of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders sto a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and and when he had taken the book The Four Beast and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of order order and um which are the prayers of the saint which is back to what I was saying when John went over there he didn't see anyone he he got scared because with the judgment and everything happening he he he got scared because there couldn't be any hope for Humanity until the lamb which was Jesus Christ himself which is like the fifth Beast that came out which was Jesus Christ himself by him coming out that gave John hope that's when he felt at ease now in thirst for Life 195 U 57 because we've got his life in Us by the new birth and we're just as Eternal as God is eternal we cannot perish Jesus said he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me have eternal life shall never come into judgment but it's passed from Death unto life and in 1957 our faith once delivered to Saints he says we believe that God is eternal and anything that has a beginning and anything that has a beginning has a end see and God doesn't have an end like I said earlier when if you 1% God then you're still God that mean if God didn't have a beginning you also don't have a beginning and if we could go to Second Timothy second Timothy chapter 2 verse 24 amen now verse 24 it says this in second Timothy second Timothy it says and the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men up to teach patient in meekness instructing those that opposes themselves if God pre-venture will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover thems out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will you see if you pay attention it says that in meekness instructing those that opposes thems themselves if God preventure give them repentance which is Grace if God gives them Grace to acknowledge which is like Revelation to have a revelation of the truth and that they may recover themselves that mean there it's in a sense it's kind of like they're coming back to them themselves kind of like um the the prodigal son coming back to himself you see because coming back to yourself is a type of Revelation because when in this world that we live in people are so far gone they're basically lost and dead how in Luke 15:32 he said that there were that his son was lost but now found he was dead now alive that mean if you don't have the Revelation in you that mean you're dead you're lost that mean you're not you're out of the will of God because God himself is life he is the way the truth and the life that mean if you're not in God you don't have the revelation of God that mean since you're since you're not inside God and you're outside God that mean you're dead you're lost you see exactly and it says it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says or what the seminar Seminary teaches and th it might be Tau to you with eloquence until God reveals to you that Jesus Christ that Jesus is the Christ you see and it is the blood that cleanses it that cleanses you and that God is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual Revelation that gives eternal life and in this day like I said a lot of people are lost because the Bible says that people by abounding in iniquity their lovees gets cold you see their love gets cold and if you look brother brandham said that what is perfect it's love and what is love love is God that mean that mean if their love gets cold that mean they don't have love they don't have God God in them gets cold that me they they're too they're sleeping there's some people their seed are end dorant and they need to be quickened and some people simply don't have it and in this last age because throughout the year I had noticed there was a theme that was going around about first you have to feed on the word then I started seeing the preachers and ministers started talk about marriages and stuff and I was wondering why all of a sudden there was this little shift that was happening and I even noticed when you look in the web there was there were people promoting marriages in the wrong sense and some people were promoting singleness and I was just wonder I was like Lord God why is this and at the same time in our church we started having couples meeting and stuff and I was like I was still wondering why but then till later a friend had U we were speaking about shorts and stuff A friend had asked me about scriptures about it so I decided to do my own research I brought the scriptures I brought the quotes the quotes and as I was reading the quotes brother Brena has said that a certain level when your shorts or your sces at a certain level it's revealing your nakedness and you don't have shame you see and in Revelation it speaks about how we're naked and blind and we can't see and if you look at the age that we're living in they're naked and they're blind and they cannot see you see because a a woman in the Bible even in the message if you look at it it represent a church it represent a group of people and if it says that their they their their love gets cold and they're blinded and if you look at the atmosphere of the world how it's going right now that there when it comes to marriage and love they don't have it they lack it's gone cold and they're blinded by lust because brother Brandon has said that they're blinded by the veil of lust if you read the um the message he said they're blinded by the veil of lust and because they're blinded by the veil of lust everything that they do is usually contrary to God and most of them they they talk about how you you can live by yourself but the scripture said that it's better for you to have someone to live with that way it won't be plain vanity if you need a scripture I will give it to you that way it won't be plain vanity you you can live with someone and it says two heads are better than one you see Lord excuse me because it says it's better to live like with a family to with a loved one that way you're when you're going to work you're going to work for someone when you're doing something you're doing something for someone you're not just doing it haphazardly you see exactly and in question and answer first um concerning that uh when I had read the scriptures concerning the shorts and the nakedness and a revelation came to me saying that this age since he's naked and he has no shame what they need is also an Awakening they need a revelation because the reason why this world is so far gone is because they don't have a revelation they don't have that Revelation by the spirit because you can also have a revelation the wrong thing you can also have a revelation but if it's not by God it's meaningless as the scriptures say because you could people can teach you people can tell you and you can feel like you have a revelation because even scientists calls it it's like a Eureka moment for them you see but to a believer in Revelation changes the whole perception on life it changes even the way that they talk the way that they walk and the way that they act you see because when God had came down to Abraham and he was talking to Abraham he told Abraham be ye perfect and Abraham he wasn't Perfect by some intellectual knowledge he was perfect by the way he spoke because he received that Revelation he accepted it and when he accepted that Revelation he started walking in Perfection you see he started walking in Perfection and if we could go um really quick because in in Matthew chapter 25 I believe verse 24 it said 24 it says that you be perfect as my father is also perfect you see but if we could go to Matthew chapter 24 if we can go to actually pardon me I meant to say First Corinthian 1 Corinthians chapter 2 yes sir if you're there you can say amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and if you could go to verse starting at verse starting at verse six it says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect ye not the wisdom yet not the wisdom of this world nor the nor of the prince the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden Mystery which God ordained before the world unto our Glory you see when I was reading this scripture because I read I read this scripture earlier and I was thinking to just skip it to just I was thinking to just skip this scripture and not put it into my note or something like that then later on the pastor had came in and shot me this scripture he shot me the scripture and I was like I guess since he sent it to me that's God telling me that I need to go back and dig into it and reread it and as I was read as I was rereading it it says how be it we speak wisdom and I decided to look at it what did it mean by we speak wisdom and they that are them that are perfect it says we we preach wisdom and if you look at proverb we find that wisdom is Christ wisdom is Jesus Christ so it's saying we preach Christ among them that are perfect which are believers because a True Believer is the same as God and God is perfect you see we preach we preach Christ among them that are perfect yet not the Christ or the knowledge or the wisdom of this world because people of this world they also have their own Christ also have their own knowledge they also have their own understanding and the Bible is saying not the understanding not the knowledge not the wisdom not the Christ of people of this world and it says nor of the princes of this world that come to n because we find out princes are humans because say not nor of the humans of this world because it says you are Gods you are the children of the most you shall fell like one of the princes which is speaking about humans then verse seven says but ye speak the wisd wiom of God in the mystery in a mystery then you you preach the wisdom you preach Christ the Christ of God You Preach Jesus the Jesus of God in a mystery yes sir even the hidden wisdom which is like the hidden seals the Hidden Mysteries which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which is predestinated which none of the princes of this world knew for had they knew it they would not they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory yes because if the princes of this world if if the children of Israel knew it they would not have crucified Jesus and that Grace would not have fall upon us the Gentiles you see but as it is written I have not seen nor Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of men the things which God have prepared for them that love him but God have revealed them unto us by his Spirit see it's God revealed God is the one who's revealing those Secrets those Mysteries he's revealing himself because Jesus himself is those Mysteries because if you look at the Book of Revelation it starts by the revelation of Jesus Christ it's himself it's God revealing himself you see and it says but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yeah the Deep things of God that mean if you're if you find yourself longing for the Deep things of God that mean you have God in you longing for those you see for what man knoweth the things of men say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us you see we're it's the spirit of God that's given unto us that makes us know God more and by us knowing god more we we also learn and know ourselves better because earlier as we were reading as we were reading earlier it was talking about how how God himself was revealing himself and brother Bren had actually spoke about this he said God was revealing himself and as he was he said Jesus Christ is the revelation of the Bible and if Jesus Christ is the revelation of the Bible then you are the revelation the whole thing and and if you read over here it says that we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit of which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God see since it's freely given unto us and the spirit of God is the one that's given unto us that's why brother brandham said we are the revelation of the whole thing you see which things also we speak not in the in The Words which men wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing scri spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not that the things of the spirit of God for they are fool foolish for there are foolishness unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritual discerned they're spiritually discerned you see it takes the spirit of God to reveal it takes the spirit of God to reveal what's in God's mind he takes the spirit of God to reveal God to you Hallelujah but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is Judge of no man for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ that mean we have the spirit of God and that's the spirit that's that's revealing unto us daily am now in question and answer um it says there will come a time a Time now that the bride will will that rejects the the head the head's part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection because the gospel was made plain to them back then like it's made plain to you today see see it's so plain you don't had all of those years examples the seals open the church ages laid out and everything like that it's just so plain you can't miss it see and then if you fully reject it there's only one thing to do which is suffer that mean if you reject the Revelation there's only one thing left it's suffer because if you look at Cain and Abel when God had told them because God had told them to give them a give him a sacrifice and both Cain and Abel heard the same story that that that happened to Eden and through Revelation Abel gave a better sacrifice through revelation was able to please God with his sacrifice but Cain wasn't then God came down and told Cain be careful the enemy is at the door and that was God revealing what was to come to Cain but Cain did not receive it Cain rejected it just like this age is rejecting the revelation of Jesus Christ and because he rejected it he had to go through tribulation he had to go through suffering you see just like this world since they're rejecting the revelation of God they're rejecting who God is there will also suffer as the scripture says now in the prodigal son I will try to close in the prodal son of 1950 it says think of my father that has all the wealth that he has and all things that he has given to me here I am laying here dying of hunger laying in a hog pan eating the Bible said he came to himself that mean he he had he received the revelation of who he is you see because the scripture that we had read it said if God give you Grace and after you come to yourself you will take yourself out of you will free yourself from the devil it didn't even say God will come down and come and free you you will free yourself from the devil you see because revelation will free you from the devil that's that's why Revelation is so important to a True Believer because it gives you the power to Free Yourself it gives you the power to be like you see and it says and that's what the church needs to do today to come TOS to realize who who is who is your father for sometimes we act as though we have no heavenly father because if you know who your father is that that mean you know everything that your father is you're also the same thing you're the inheritance you're the hair of it you see for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church Divine Healing salvation freedom from worrying or anything all belongs to the church Jesus died and we are we are inherit and we inherit all that all that God has all that God has through him hers of the Kingdom Rich my father is rich in in houses and lands that's right he holds the wealth of the world in his hand that's right that's how we are if we would just come to ourself or I can see him as he began to come to himself and say oh if I could just go home but I've sinned and I'm no no more worthy to go home so what can I do see they the um prodigal son had built up a complex because he went to the world just like us because we were brought up and raised up we were birthed in the world we also built up a complex that put us in spiritual Amnesia you see that's why we we don't that's what we need a revelation so we can know who we are that's why God had to come down reveal himself to us and brother Brenham says in question answer of 1953 he says that he was laying there speaking about Adam he was laying there I can have many pictures of it I can see Adam standing let's take this let's take this way see him standing like a tree God had made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking in the ground and God said let there be or breathe the breath of life into him and he jumped he jumped and came to himself you see he was a breathed the breath of life into him he became a living soul and he began to move on and on you see he because if you look at look when he look chapter 15 when he had said that when he had said that my son was lost then found he was dead then alive because he was he because he didn't have the Revelation because he was um he forgot who he was he because he was even eating the um with pigs where he wasn't supposed to be but by him coming to himself he came to life and you see here brother Brenham saying that by um by Adam by the Breath of Life entering Adam he came to himself and that's when he became alive so if the breath that mean the Revelation itself when you come to yourself is also the Breath of Life entering you you see it's also the Breath of Life entering you yes amen amen and just trying to close because of time in 1965 The God Who is rich in Mercy brother Brenham talks in paragraph 52 all the way to 55 he says I heard a s I heard a simil a similar little story I hope it don't sound sacrilegious about a little dog being born under a h one time he couldn't understand a funny looking little fellow odd guy and he couldn't understand the dust and everything they were playing in the barnyard but one day the old hand led the little Brad out behind the barn and he got a smell of water well he took out towards the water as hard as he could go why he had never been on the pound before he had never been in in the water but he was a dock to begin with only thing he had to do was come to himself you see just like a True Believer a True Believer in this last age when they come to them themselves when they hear the word the word will make them come to themselves and when they come to themselves they will crave for more of the word and they will run more towards the word to so they can eat more of the word you see so God can continuously keep revealing himself to them you see that's the same thing the believer is there is something in him that when he meets God face to face he comes to himself the seed is in him and it's quickened by that's right he flies away from the things of the world just like John when he would when he entered into the spirit he flew away from the things of the world you see he flies away from the things of the world they be they become dead to him you see my I remember we all had our life in the past in those things of the world but once we got a hold of the real thing something that quickened us a little seed that come to life then all the things of the world rotted right there we had no more desire of it you see because when you receive the the Revelation by the Holy Spirit the desire of the world will also go away you see you're not going you're not going to be confound by the by the laws of the Earth by the desires of this world you're not going to be confound by that because when when when a kid is is growing up when they don't know something and something is taught onto them and after that they finally realize it because certain times you can tell a kid serveral time they're still not going to understand it you see it has to be revealed to them because if it's not revealed to them they're going to continue making the same mistake you see and when when it's revealed to them that's when they're going to start getting away from those things that are bad that are harming them the same thing here with a Believer when you receive the revelation of God when you receive the revelation of who you are it will make you live right act right speak right and be right you see it will make you not desire the things of the world anymore and it will just make you move forward am am I'll read a closing scripture if the musician could come up a closing verse um quote in 1961 December 31st at the evening brother brandham says and if God be with us then where is all the Miracles brother Bram says Jonah in the belly of the well acted first upon the word of God he knowed he was gone as far as physical his hand was bound his feet was bound this preacher to the Gentiles was thrown out of the ship into the Well's belly and down to the bottom of the sea now what a condition he is in but first he turned himself over in the bottom of the well seaweed was wrapped around his neck where the well had been eating these these weed and things to put vitamin in his body his vitamin pills and then he got a preacher in there but but this preacher came to himself you see Jonah had came to himself oh brother preacher come to yourself tonight get away from them them old Creeds and things and come back to a living God to a Living Word he came to himself he rolled over he Can't Hide You Can't Hide a saint from his prayer you turned over and he looked everywhere was Well's belly all around him east north west and south and he realized that he was in the Well's belly and down in the bottom of the sea the and the storm on the sea all hopes were gone all hopes was gone when he was in the ship and now he was in the Well's B belly farther farther away from Hope than ever and when only he could when only he could see the belly of the well he said there are lying vanities I won't believe them anymore but I'll look towards your Holy Temple Lord the Holy Temple wasn't looking down he said it's up there so I'm looking towards it so tonight I just telling youall to believe and receive the Revelation by the spirit and telling you the importance of a revelation to their Revelation by the spirit to a Believer is because once you receive it it will change your whole entire way of viewing reality even when you're listening to songs and music that's why earlier I started by saying that in this age if David if you were to take David from his time when he was dancing with all his might and bring him to our time and after you say let's have a dance competition our age people from this time real true message believer should be able to dance harder than David because we have a higher Revelation that he did he had a closed book but we have an open book we have an open Revelation you see that God himself came down and he revealed himself and he even Vindicated that he revealed himself and gave it to us and if you yourself has received the Revelation that mean the Greater Works that God spoke of you will do and you will realize that that God in you because God had called us a peculiar people A peculiar treasure and he had placed the treasure in us and if that the revelation of what that treasure is and of who you are is it will even bring you to the translation of your own body because you're not going to have the translation of the body without first having the Revelation by the spirit you see the world is just waiting for the manifestation of of the sons of God you see the world is waiting for that manifestation animals are groaning for that for the manifestation of the sons of God but the reason why it's not happening right now is because the sons of God are too busy sleeping they're too busy in Amnesia they need to be revealed they need to be they need to receive a revelation to wake them up and once they receive that Revelation and what they're awake that will cause that will trigger their Rapture and that will bring God down and the Rapture will happen and and the Earth wouldn't be gring anymore amen amen if we can bow our head Close Our Eyes Lord heavenly father I come to you this evening to thank you Lord Jesus Christ for everything that you've done Lord heavenly father to thank you for the word that you had brought forth Lord heavenly father I pray Lord heavenly father that you may come down and reveal more unto your people later on as they review it Lord Heavenly Father may you reveal the importance of the Revelation even greater to them and don't just stop and revealing their partners of Revelation to them but reveal revelation ations and Revelations more Revelations onto them Lord heavenly father so they can know what they're capable of may you give them a revelation of each and every Department of each power that you have placed in them Lord heavenly father because if they were just to receive that Revelation they would speak Lord heavenly father just like you did with your Prophet Lord Lord God you came down and you told him to speak to this srel he was looking around asking and after you told him you told him weren't you g weren't you seeking for a game and after that he started repenting and after you said just speak when he spoke it creation came squirrel came Lord Heavenly Father only if you can give us the Revelation and may you speak to us and reveal yourself onto US Lord God and so that way we may speak that way we may walk right talk right and just hold your word because if we were to receive your Revelation tonight Lord God we wouldn't be able to struggle we wouldn't be thinking of anything else but you Lord God and we'll just be walking in your footstep we'll just be walking and following you Lord God and we'll just do the greater works that you told us to do so I pray Lord God give us the revelation of yourself give us the revelation of who you are and continue to reveal yourself unto us and continue to help us Lord Jesus Christ to reveal Lord Jesus Christ what a true Christian is and what a true Christian is supposed to do because a true Christian is someone that stays with the word and doesn't deviate away from the word and if you stay with the word Lord God if we stay with the word many miracles will happen and many great things will happen Lord God and we're abandoning everything onto you because the people the world people of the world they they don't know this gospel Lord God and the only way for them to receive it is by looking at us by looking at our life and we cannot live right Lord God if we don't have the revelation of who we are and of who you are in US Lord God so I pray Lord heavenly father that you may reveal yourself more and more to us Lord God and help us look up in the in the call of the higher calling Lord God just help us be with you be one with you abandon remaining of the service on you and ab bending Lord God may you protect us on our going Lord God as you protected us when we came here may you protect us in the highways and byways that we that way we may return on our respective plates in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
