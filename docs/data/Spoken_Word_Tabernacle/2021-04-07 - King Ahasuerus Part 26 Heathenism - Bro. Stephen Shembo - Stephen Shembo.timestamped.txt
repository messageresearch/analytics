[6:40] there for sure so
[6:41] don't be afraid to write them down i
[6:44] don't know if they said to put your name
[6:45] on them or not but i'll just leave that
[6:47] up to you whether you want to put your
[6:48] name on it or not but
[6:49] go ahead and fill that box up and we
[6:51] want to have too many to where you can't

[19:32] i was thinking uh sunday last sunday
[19:36] while the brother was preaching
[19:38] her brother shango was preaching i was
[19:40] thinking uh
[19:42] when i grew up in church they always
[19:44] tried to move everybody
[19:46] like the young people especially to the
[19:47] front row they said get closer to the
[19:49] fire get closer to the fire
[19:51] and something i appreciate appreciate
[19:53] about this church is
[19:54] i tell you what we got fire in the back
[19:57] with brother robert and brother kelly
[19:59] and brother shango and brother chim and
[20:01] all the brothers back there
[20:02] and caleb man he could barely sit still
[20:04] the other day i was about to tell
[20:06] another brother to grab the mic and
[20:08] interpret because caleb was all over the
[20:09] place
[20:10] and i'm like we got fire in the front
[20:12] brother lamont

[26:21] we want to do everything with him amen
[26:26] blessed be the name of the lord thank
[26:28] you very much physician
[26:34] i saw online that there was a
[26:38] a prayer request from sister rose mary
[26:40] she said that their
[26:42] two cents went home to be with the lord
[26:45] in kenya
[26:46] and she has to remember the families in
[26:48] prayer
[26:49] so when you go home in your car in your
[26:52] deep prayer
[26:53] so please remember those family in
[26:56] prayer
[26:57] even though we have a blessed hope but
[26:59] separation in the body
[27:01] always hurt amen
[27:04] brother kalima also lost his
[27:07] brother-in-law
[27:09] up north so his family
[27:12] wife and children are in canada but he
[27:15] passed away in the u.s
[27:17] so there is no way for the wife to come
[27:20] into the u.s
[27:21] to be part of the funeral so it's a
[27:24] little bit tough on her
[27:25] so remember the family in prayer and i
[27:28] believe to the best of my understanding
[27:31] the funeral could be next week so
[27:33] remember brother kalima
[27:35] and remember the family in prayer and
[27:38] ensure
[27:39] coverage your prayer amen for the house
[27:43] meeting
[27:44] it's going to be a brother john
[27:45] porterhouse that's what i saw in the
[27:47] church of announcement
[27:49] right it's on the 17th at brother john
[27:52] porter house i believe brother david
[27:54] down the road
[27:55] we might have to send a mass text for
[27:57] his address
[27:58] for those who have not been there they
[28:00] have remodeled their house
[28:04] so that would be a good opportunity to
[28:07] start with
[28:08] amen blessed be the name of the lord so
[28:11] you have your question brother abel
[28:13] already spoke about it
[28:14] get your question fill in the box i saw
[28:17] some of them

[31:30] amen so remember when a damn when a
[31:32] demon is gone
[31:33] don't relax fortify yourself

[32:04] god of variety there are certain keys in
[32:07] this message
[32:08] if you miss them you're gonna have
[32:10] trouble in a message
[32:12] you're gonna have trouble understanding
[32:14] brother branham
[32:15] amen so it's important now to begin to
[32:19] share
[32:19] all these things so it's going to help
[32:21] you navigate through the message
[32:23] and tonight lord's willing before we
[32:26] progress a little bit deeper
[32:28] i'm going to touch one more just to help
[32:30] you out because if you
[32:32] miss it then it might turn into
[32:34] legalistic
[32:35] view because you didn't understand
[32:38] the very mind of god amen it's easier
[32:42] when you
[32:43] there is a certain avenue of the black
[32:45] dog when you begin to enter there
[32:47] it sounds like it's legalistic if you
[32:50] don't understand
[32:52] correctly or if you didn't catch the
[32:55] vision
[32:56] this message have a vision once you
[32:58] catch the vision
[33:00] no matter what court they're going to
[33:01] bring to you you will navigate without
[33:03] any problem
[33:05] if you never caught the vision you're
[33:06] going to have question
[33:08] after question of the question spinning
[33:10] around
[33:11] and you don't understand the prophet
[33:13] once you catch the vision
[33:15] even though you don't have a scripture
[33:17] you will feel the holy spirit can
[33:20] navigate easily without any problem amen
[33:23] so tonight we're going to touch one of
[33:25] them let's go to number 23 verse 7.
[33:28] if you dare you can say amen i could
[33:31] continue
[33:31] down with the high heel if i go it might
[33:34] be tough on somebody so
[33:36] we want you to understand what is really
[33:39] demand of god
[33:41] what is the mind of god toward us once
[33:44] you get that
[33:45] then you're going to understand why this
[33:47] is wrong why this is wrong why this is
[33:50] wrong
[33:50] everything becomes easier amen like when
[33:53] you understand the god of variety
[33:55] if you bring me any quotes where brother
[33:58] branham is talking about mixed marriages
[33:59] i'll sit with you
[34:01] and go through it without any problem
[34:03] because you already grasped the concept
[34:05] if you lose it you put it on brad
[34:07] branham then you begin to attack him
[34:10] not understanding that brother branham
[34:12] only caught the mind of god
[34:14] to count i mean to grasp the concept of
[34:17] god
[34:17] once you get it that's why the message
[34:19] is like a channel
[34:21] of inspiration once you get it you catch
[34:23] the mind of god
[34:24] then everything becomes planned without
[34:26] any problem amen
[34:29] number 23 verse 7 if you're there you
[34:31] can say amen
[34:32] this is balaam prophesying he say and he
[34:35] took
[34:36] up his parable and say bella
[34:39] the king of moab has brought me from
[34:42] aram
[34:43] out of the mountains of the east you
[34:45] might be seated
[34:46] saying come curse me jacob
[34:50] and come defy israel i believe everybody
[34:54] is familiar with this scripture this is
[34:57] the king barak
[34:58] israel was coming out of egypt going to
[35:00] the promised land
[35:02] and moab was jealous toward israel so he
[35:05] hired a prophet by the name of balaam
[35:07] to come and to curse israel and also to
[35:10] defy
[35:11] israel in other words to curse them to
[35:13] destroy them
[35:14] amen verse 8 how
[35:17] shall i curse whom god has not
[35:21] cursed that's why no weapon form against
[35:24] you
[35:24] shall prosper if god put you on a
[35:27] certain category
[35:29] no matter what's going to happen nobody
[35:32] will move you from that category
[35:34] amen how shall i curse whom god has not
[35:37] cursed or how shall i defy
[35:41] whom the lord has not defiled in other
[35:44] words the devil
[35:46] always need permission to do
[35:49] something in your life that's why before
[35:53] the devil attack job
[35:55] he must be granted permission
[35:58] and that permission always have
[36:00] limitation
[36:02] and that permission will not be above
[36:06] your strength
[36:07] because the bible says you cannot be
[36:09] tempted
[36:10] above your strength so if your strength
[36:14] is 10 god will never give the devil 11
[36:18] permission
[36:19] amen god will give the devil either 10
[36:23] or below 10 knowing that when he's
[36:26] coming to you
[36:27] you are already equipped even though you
[36:29] don't think you are equipped
[36:31] but that's why the bible said resist the
[36:34] devil
[36:35] how are you going to resist the devil
[36:37] because you already been built
[36:39] against certain things if you recognize
[36:42] yourself
[36:44] the devil will be powerful will be
[36:47] perilous
[36:48] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[36:51] so how shall i curse whom god has not
[36:54] cursed
[36:55] or how shall i defy whom the lord has
[36:58] not defied
[36:59] this is the key now verse 9 for from the
[37:03] top of the rocks
[37:05] i see him he's looking at jacob he's
[37:08] looking at israel
[37:10] and from the hills are behold him
[37:14] lo the people shall dwell
[37:17] alone the people of israel
[37:21] are not supposed to be mixing with other
[37:24] people
[37:26] you follow me not a mixer
[37:30] but it's a people that would wear
[37:33] separated
[37:34] alone anybody clear come on
[37:38] and shall not be reckoned among the
[37:41] water
[37:42] the nation so israel
[37:46] cannot be put among the nation
[37:49] the lifestyle of israel the
[37:53] the the custom of israel
[37:56] the way israel is living its own life
[38:00] will be completely separated from
[38:04] any nation on planet earth
[38:07] amen so nobody can fit israel
[38:11] and israel cannot fit the world
[38:16] this is the earth the earth is filled
[38:19] with people
[38:20] anybody follow me out of this earth
[38:24] god picked a bunch of people
[38:27] that are called the jews amen and
[38:32] he pulled the jews out from the world
[38:36] amen and then when he pulled them out
[38:40] they are called the israel of god
[38:44] they are jews and sometimes they are
[38:47] referred to as hebrews
[38:50] everybody clear everybody else that
[38:53] remain
[38:54] in this setting are called hidden
[38:59] oh pagan
[39:03] or gentile
[39:06] anybody can yeah praise be the name of
[39:10] the lord
[39:11] so when they look from the top of the
[39:13] rock
[39:14] i see him as israel and from the hill
[39:18] and behold him lord the people shall
[39:20] dwell
[39:21] alone that's why god separated them amen
[39:25] and shall not be reckoned among the
[39:28] nation this is a peculiar nation
[39:32] a peculiar people a peculiar
[39:35] country that must live a different
[39:38] lifestyle
[39:39] than anybody else on planet earth
[39:41] everybody clear
[39:42] let's go to james chapter 3.
[39:49] amen
[39:53] james chapter 3
[40:00] verse 15 if you dare you can say amen
[40:05] this wisdom this
[40:10] wisdom descends not
[40:13] from above but it's earthly
[40:18] sensual and devilish so
[40:21] right here there are two wisdom
[40:25] there is a wisdom from above
[40:33] hope good one there is a wisdom
[40:37] for a from above
[40:42] which is a godly wisdom everybody there
[40:47] and there is a wisdom from the earth
[40:50] which is earthly but the description the
[40:53] bible gives
[40:54] is the wisdom from the earth is water
[40:58] it's essential do you know what it means
[41:03] five senses anybody clear
[41:08] it's connected to lust
[41:12] and it's water devilish it's from the
[41:16] devil
[41:18] do you see the wisdom you've got he said
[41:22] the wisdom is earthly
[41:24] it's sensual it's devilish
[41:27] verse 16 for where envy and strafies
[41:32] there is confusion and every evil work
[41:36] but the wisdom that is from above is
[41:39] first water
[41:41] pure this is a different kind of wisdom
[41:45] it's pure number two
[41:49] it is peaceable three gentle
[41:52] and easy to being treated full of mercy
[41:56] and good fruits without personality
[42:00] in other words it's without favoritism
[42:03] it doesn't favor certain people against
[42:07] other that's why the church needs to be
[42:09] ruled
[42:10] with a heavenly wisdom amen
[42:14] and without hypocrisy meaning whatever
[42:17] they tell you in the mouth it's exactly
[42:19] what is in the heart
[42:21] right here this wisdom are represented
[42:25] in eden as two
[42:26] trees the tree of life
[42:31] everybody clear and the tree of the
[42:33] knowledge of good and evil
[42:40] we clear let's go to first john chapter
[42:44] chapter 2. israel
[42:48] is a nation but it's a nation
[42:51] that is not reckoned among the nation of
[42:54] the world
[42:56] no wonder abraham when he went he was
[42:58] looking for a city
[43:00] not an earthly city but a city whose
[43:03] building and thunder is who
[43:05] god not reckon among the cities
[43:08] of the earth it's a heavenly city which
[43:11] is jerusalem
[43:12] which is the mother of us all first john
[43:14] chapter 2 verse 15. if you dare you can
[43:17] say amen
[43:18] love not what the word
[43:21] here is not israel
[43:25] love not water
[43:29] everybody clear now love not the world
[43:34] neither the things that are in the world
[43:37] so not only the world itself
[43:40] but even the things that are in the
[43:43] world don't like him
[43:46] that's god amen if any man
[43:49] loves the world the cosmos we already
[43:52] explained this the politics
[43:54] the fashion remember on sunday if you
[43:57] love those things
[43:59] the love of the father is not in him
[44:03] for all that is in the world we explain
[44:06] you this
[44:07] the last of the flesh the temptation of
[44:10] jesus the first one
[44:11] the last of the eyes the second
[44:13] temptation of jesus christ
[44:15] and the pride of life is not of the
[44:17] father but of the water
[44:19] so there is three categories that are
[44:23] in this kind of life that is left here
[44:26] god pulled israel out of here but
[44:29] whatever
[44:30] is left there is living under those
[44:32] three categories the last of the flesh
[44:34] the last of the eyes and the proud of
[44:36] life everybody clear
[44:38] verse 17 and the world passes away in
[44:42] other words
[44:43] what you cling to in the world one of
[44:45] this day is gonna be burnt out
[44:47] completely it's gonna pass away heaven
[44:49] and earth will pass away but my word
[44:52] will not pass away amen the world passes
[44:55] away
[44:56] and the last day of so the world has
[44:59] lost
[45:02] everybody there but when the world will
[45:06] be cleaned up
[45:07] pericomia completely wiped out then that
[45:10] last also will be taken out
[45:12] sin will be completely removed and the
[45:14] world passes away
[45:16] and the last thereof but he that does
[45:19] the will of god a bad for water
[45:22] so you want to stay with the word of god
[45:25] because heaven and earth will pass away
[45:28] but the word will remain so if you do
[45:31] the will of god you become the word
[45:34] the the heaven and earth will pass away
[45:37] but if the word remain
[45:38] you gonna also remain forever because
[45:41] the word of god abideth
[45:43] forever everybody clear let's pray them
[45:46] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[45:49] for your grace
[45:50] your love your mercy father for giving
[45:52] us another opportunity
[45:54] to gather together in the midst of the
[45:57] week around the revealed world of the
[45:59] hour
[46:00] father your children have been at work
[46:02] some probably
[46:03] in school or many different things lord
[46:06] but lord they made it all the way to
[46:08] your house lord
[46:10] sacrificing lord father their
[46:13] desire or their their feeling of being
[46:16] tired and everything
[46:17] but willing to give you preeminence lord
[46:20] father
[46:21] because this is the hour where you ask
[46:23] and you are looking for preeminence
[46:25] in your blood father we thank you for
[46:28] your divine love in the heart of your
[46:30] children
[46:31] and we want to commit this service unto
[46:33] the hand may you help me
[46:35] and move me completely out of the way
[46:37] may you seal
[46:38] every spirit that is contrary to your
[46:40] divine nature away from this place lord
[46:43] but may only the holy spirit and the
[46:46] angels of the lord
[46:47] be the one ministering tonight to your
[46:49] children lord may you unfold lord the
[46:52] door
[46:53] of revelation to your children so that
[46:55] they can really catch the mind lord
[46:57] father
[46:58] of the lord because your prophet told us
[47:00] lord that revelation
[47:02] is the work of the spirit it is now
[47:04] revealed by flesh and blood
[47:06] but it takes a supernatural action of
[47:09] the holy spirit
[47:10] in the heart of your children to open
[47:12] the eyes of the heart lord
[47:14] so that they may receive the engrafted
[47:16] word of god
[47:17] that can save their soul father we
[47:20] committed
[47:20] unto the hand and asked in the name of
[47:23] jesus
[47:24] christ amen god bless you tonight we are
[47:27] continuing
[47:28] on this subject we on part 26 everybody
[47:32] clear
[47:33] amen when we got on ezekiel
[47:36] chapter 16 let's go to genesis chapter 3
[47:39] then i'm going to build back up from
[47:41] there that's where we were on sunday
[47:46] and we're going to blend it with ezekiel
[47:48] and go to where we want to go tonight
[47:51] genesis chapter 3 verse 5 if you dare
[47:54] you can say amen
[47:55] for god does know that in the day
[47:58] you eat thereof then your eyes
[48:01] shall be open man
[48:05] and a woman in the garden of eden were
[48:08] not
[48:08] children they were adults
[48:11] completely adam was not a baby adam was
[48:15] created
[48:15] a full man in a full stature but
[48:19] adam was there with a holy veil him and
[48:22] his wife
[48:23] to the point that they could look at one
[48:25] another being naked but they could not
[48:27] recognize
[48:28] that they were naked they were there
[48:30] with a holy veil everybody clear
[48:32] now the bible says in verse 5 for god
[48:35] does
[48:35] know that in the day you eat thereof
[48:39] then your eyes shall be opened god
[48:42] created adam
[48:43] he created eve he created them as gods
[48:46] already but that deity
[48:49] according to god god decided and god
[48:53] chose that it was better for his deity
[48:57] to be failed from something anybody
[48:59] clear
[49:00] he didn't want them to be acknowled to
[49:03] have the knowledge
[49:05] or to have the conscience that they were
[49:07] naked
[49:08] now the devil came in and tried to break
[49:11] into that veil
[49:12] to open their eyes not to something that
[49:15] is good
[49:16] but to just open their eyes to recognize
[49:18] that they were naked everybody clear
[49:22] and you shall be as god knowing good and
[49:24] evil which is the tree we explained this
[49:26] on sunday
[49:27] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[49:29] good for food
[49:31] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[49:34] a tree to be desired
[49:36] and to make one water wise that's the
[49:39] wisdom right here
[49:41] that james was talking about he was a
[49:44] tree
[49:44] but that tree has a wisdom and that
[49:47] wisdom
[49:48] he look good to eve because the devil
[49:51] always masks what he's gonna do with
[49:54] something good
[49:55] but if never knew that what she was
[49:57] partaking on
[49:59] is going to be a devilish wisdom ever
[50:02] clear
[50:03] blessed be the name of the lord then the
[50:05] tree to be desired
[50:07] to make one wise a tree to be desire a
[50:10] tree that can cause lust
[50:13] she took off the fruit thereof and did
[50:16] eat
[50:17] and gave also to her husband with her
[50:20] and he did
[50:20] it verse 7 and the eyes of
[50:24] death of them both were what opened
[50:28] and they knew that they were naked and
[50:31] they saw fig leaves together
[50:33] and made themselves apron in the garden
[50:37] of eden we had a full man
[50:40] and a full age mature woman
[50:43] both of them were innocent
[50:46] and they were veiled by the veil of god
[50:49] it took a
[50:50] sexual act to break the veil
[50:53] of holiness and open their eyes
[50:56] and once their eyes were open
[50:59] in other words once the black dog was
[51:03] turned on in eden
[51:06] the first thing that happened he brought
[51:09] them conscience about their nakedness
[51:12] and they became concerned on how they
[51:15] need to dress themselves
[51:18] make sense so when we look at this
[51:22] stage of human life in our
[51:26] part here we didn't come like adam
[51:30] adam was created if was created
[51:33] and both of them came automatically
[51:35] mature people
[51:36] in our way we are born through sex
[51:40] that sex brother branham said he talks
[51:42] about the blood
[51:44] amen that's why all able have to offer
[51:47] blood in the garden of eden everybody
[51:49] clear so when we are born
[51:51] in this world we don't come like adam
[51:53] adam came
[51:54] completely a full mature man but we
[51:57] always come like
[51:58] babies but even though we come like
[52:01] babies we go through the same process
[52:04] that adam went because as a baby
[52:08] god also put a veil unto you that you
[52:11] don't recognize
[52:12] good from evil let's go to deuteronomy
[52:16] chapter 1 verse 30 time
[52:22] if you dare you can say amen
[52:25] if you don't want to turn on that it's
[52:27] on the board
[52:28] the bible said moreover your little ones
[52:32] not the adult one not the big one
[52:36] your little ones which you say
[52:39] should be a prey and your what
[52:42] children we know the age brother branham
[52:44] described to us that
[52:46] it's one all the way from zero all the
[52:48] way to 12 years old
[52:50] and we found even in the life of jesus
[52:52] christ so your little one
[52:54] which you say should be a prey and your
[52:57] children
[52:58] which in that day had no water
[53:02] knowledge between water and water
[53:06] from the scripture ever clear so when
[53:10] adam was created god blocked the black
[53:13] dog
[53:14] no knowledge of good and evil but we
[53:17] come through sex as children born in sin
[53:21] shape and iniquity but when we come as
[53:23] children
[53:24] god also blocked the black dog by
[53:27] putting a veil upon us
[53:29] that's why the scriptures say the
[53:31] children the little one they have
[53:33] no knowledge between what good and evil
[53:36] they're under the state of innocency
[53:39] automatically the blood of the lamb is
[53:42] claiming them
[53:43] and speaking for them if something ever
[53:45] happened to one of them
[53:47] they're going straight to heaven ever
[53:49] clear so far
[53:50] blessed be the name of the lord which in
[53:53] that day
[53:54] had no knowledge between good and evil
[53:56] they shall go
[53:57] into them and unto them will i give
[54:01] it and they shall possess it in other
[54:02] words israel
[54:04] seeing god say oh that generation
[54:07] they have their eyes already open all of
[54:10] you are gonna die i'm not gonna take you
[54:12] to the promised land
[54:14] i'm gonna take the edge of the children
[54:16] that have
[54:17] not opened the door to the black dog yet
[54:21] that's the generation i'm gonna take to
[54:23] put them into the promised land
[54:25] amen this innocency is
[54:28] different than the innocency of babylon
[54:32] because just like there are two wisdom
[54:35] there are two trees they are also too
[54:39] innocency
[54:40] if you go in the message power of
[54:42] transform of transformation
[54:44] and set an eden if you read or you
[54:47] listen to those two messages
[54:48] brother branham explained that correctly
[54:51] so if you go to john
[54:52] chapter 4 verse 11 the bible said that
[54:56] and should none should not i spare
[54:59] nineveh
[55:00] nineveh was the capital of water
[55:05] who knows babylon ever clear
[55:09] now we are not in israel we in babylon
[55:11] so there are two trees
[55:13] two islam we also have two veil
[55:18] everybody the veil that was in the
[55:21] garden of eden
[55:22] that protected adam and eve and if
[55:25] brother branham said he was a holy veil
[55:28] of the holy spirit
[55:29] anybody clear but the veil that comes
[55:32] from babylon
[55:34] brother branham said it is the last veil
[55:39] you need a coach you see me and should i
[55:42] not spare
[55:43] nineveh babylon that great city
[55:47] are more than six quarter thousand
[55:50] persons
[55:51] that cannot discern between water their
[55:54] right hand
[55:54] and their water in other words they are
[55:57] living
[55:58] any kind of life they don't even know
[56:01] what is good and what is bad again
[56:03] they're under a veil but that veil is
[56:06] not a holy veil
[56:08] it is a different veil because god sent
[56:11] a prophet by the name of jonah
[56:13] and told jonah to go preach in the city
[56:16] that if they don't repent
[56:18] god will destroy them ever clear so to
[56:21] break the veil of lust
[56:24] you need a prophetic message
[56:27] are you there he took a prophet by the
[56:30] name of jonah
[56:32] and jonah spent three days in the
[56:35] belly of the world and jesus when he
[56:38] came he said
[56:39] as jonah spent three days and three
[56:41] nights in the belly of a whale
[56:43] such as the son of man spent three days
[56:46] and three nights in the heart of the
[56:47] earth
[56:48] he was speaking about the resurrection
[56:51] the miracle the son of jonah was a sign
[56:55] of
[56:55] resurrection so when you want to break
[56:58] the veil of lust
[56:59] you need first a prophet
[57:05] you need a prophetic ministry
[57:08] not any kind of ministry you need a
[57:10] prophetic ministry
[57:12] with the power of resurrection
[57:17] everybody that's why paul said i must
[57:20] know him
[57:21] in the power of resurrection
[57:24] paul was a prophet with the power
[57:28] of resurrection i come with you not with
[57:31] the word of wisdom of
[57:32] man but with the demonstration of the
[57:36] power of the holy spirit
[57:37] to break the last of babylon you need a
[57:40] prophetic ministry
[57:42] that is bringing jesus christ out from
[57:45] history
[57:47] everybody so far in revelation chapter 3
[57:51] verse 17
[57:52] because that says i am water
[57:56] reach and increase with goods and have
[57:59] needs of nothing
[58:00] and know if not that they are wretched
[58:04] come on and miserable kama
[58:07] and poor kama and blind
[58:11] this blindness doesn't mean everybody in
[58:13] this world is blind
[58:15] this is not a natural blindness it is
[58:18] a spiritual blindness it is a spiritual
[58:23] veil called blindness that's the reason
[58:27] why
[58:27] when the syrians were looking for elisha
[58:31] elisha just told them that i am who are
[58:34] you looking for they didn't know that he
[58:35] was elijah
[58:36] something elijah something came on their
[58:39] eyes they could look at elisha
[58:40] but still they can't recognize him
[58:42] because they were blinded with something
[58:44] everybody cleared so far so that noise
[58:47] that they are
[58:48] righteous and miserable and poor and
[58:51] blind
[58:52] and water and here again in the midst of
[58:55] laodicea
[58:56] in the midst of babylon again great
[58:59] babylon the mystery
[59:01] we found again the people of the earth
[59:03] under
[59:04] a different blindness under a different
[59:07] veil but that veil also they are naked
[59:10] but they don't know
[59:12] it is not a holy veil because god is
[59:15] condemning the age
[59:16] the veil of nineveh was not a holy veil
[59:20] because god sent a prophet to condemn
[59:24] that's why laodicea needed a prophetic
[59:27] ministry
[59:28] with the power of resurrection that's
[59:31] why
[59:32] brother brother must come because we
[59:34] were
[59:35] under the veil of laodicea and that veil
[59:38] needs to be broken
[59:40] by the prophetic ministry with the power
[59:43] of resurrection
[59:44] because god does not change
[59:47] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[59:50] name of the lord let's go to genesis
[59:52] chapter 10 now
[59:58] let me see where we are good genesis
[1:00:00] chapter 10
[1:00:02] you need your bible today anyway
[1:00:06] any days in this church
[1:00:10] genesis chapter 10 verse 8
[1:00:13] if you dare you can say amen now we're
[1:00:15] building up
[1:00:20] genesis chapter 10 verse 8
[1:00:23] everybody there and cush
[1:00:26] father who nimrod
[1:00:30] he began to be a mighty one in the earth
[1:00:35] he was a mighty hunter remember when we
[1:00:37] talk about the zodiac he was oriented
[1:00:40] anybody remember he was a married uh
[1:00:43] maddie hunter
[1:00:44] brother branham said he was so skilled
[1:00:46] in the art of hunting
[1:00:48] that he uses the art and created a
[1:00:52] powerful
[1:00:53] army and through the army he conquered
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:56] entire world and put everybody under him
[1:01:00] anybody corey okay he was a mighty
[1:01:03] hunter before the lord
[1:01:05] wherefore it is said even as nimrod
[1:01:09] the mighty hunter before the lord so he
[1:01:12] was really renowned
[1:01:14] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[1:01:17] water
[1:01:18] babel baba is the name for babylon
[1:01:22] anybody clear and eric and arkad
[1:01:26] and counting in the land of water
[1:01:30] so we found here that when the earth
[1:01:34] started
[1:01:36] the people there was a family of god
[1:01:38] after a while sin was
[1:01:40] introduced when sin was introduced
[1:01:44] something happened there were two seed
[1:01:46] the seed of cain went
[1:01:48] on the way and then the seed of god
[1:01:50] continued
[1:01:51] on set and ebola sad ever clear then
[1:01:54] after a while they begin to mix together
[1:01:57] and then the world was completely
[1:02:00] polluted
[1:02:01] then god sent a prophet by the name of
[1:02:04] noah
[1:02:04] and by the noah and by noah came the
[1:02:07] flood
[1:02:08] and the flood destroyed everybody else
[1:02:12] and the only people that stay on the
[1:02:14] planet therefore was eight people
[1:02:16] and through those eight people they
[1:02:19] begin to
[1:02:20] multiply again and among the people that
[1:02:23] were multiplied
[1:02:24] there was a man now that is called
[1:02:27] nimrod
[1:02:28] everybody clear now now this name road
[1:02:31] the bible says that he built babel
[1:02:35] he was the one that built babel or the
[1:02:38] city of babylon
[1:02:40] and this city was in the land of
[1:02:43] shanna what does he mean
[1:02:47] where are we heading amen
[1:02:51] watch again verse 11 out of that land
[1:02:54] which land is somebody sleeping
[1:02:59] look at your scripture let me go back to
[1:03:02] verse 10.
[1:03:03] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[1:03:05] babel
[1:03:06] babylon and eric and arkad
[1:03:10] and carne he was the one building those
[1:03:12] city
[1:03:13] in the land of shanna
[1:03:16] out of darling went forth a shoe
[1:03:20] and built minivan we just saw nina video
[1:03:24] everybody clear now and they and the
[1:03:27] city
[1:03:28] rio boat and carolyn everybody clear
[1:03:34] go to genesis 11 verse 1.
[1:03:40] you there verse 1 and the water
[1:03:45] everybody in the planet earth
[1:03:49] without exception because there were
[1:03:52] only eight people that were left
[1:03:54] and they all begin to multiply and all
[1:03:58] of them begin to live into the same
[1:04:00] place
[1:04:01] called the valley of what the land of
[1:04:03] channel now the half
[1:04:05] i want you to get it no expection
[1:04:09] israel is not existing here
[1:04:12] okay there is no israel
[1:04:15] amen the all heart
[1:04:19] was of water
[1:04:22] so everybody before god
[1:04:25] started the nation of israel
[1:04:30] let me pull israel out everybody had the
[1:04:34] same language
[1:04:37] i want you to get this so you understand
[1:04:40] what is the mind of god
[1:04:43] and of what one speech
[1:04:47] so do you don't need any translator
[1:04:50] verse two and it came to pass
[1:04:53] as their journey who journey
[1:04:57] the whole earth they were moving
[1:05:00] together
[1:05:01] as a unit as their journey from the east
[1:05:07] that they found a plan in the land of
[1:05:10] water
[1:05:12] so for you to understand genesis 10
[1:05:16] that we just read you need to start with
[1:05:19] genesis 11. make sense
[1:05:23] genesis 10 already tell you they are in
[1:05:25] the land of shana
[1:05:27] but genesis 11 is giving you the
[1:05:29] background
[1:05:30] that everybody was in one place they
[1:05:33] were all moving from one place to a
[1:05:35] certain spot
[1:05:36] and that's what was in the land of shana
[1:05:39] that's the land that nimrod raymond
[1:05:42] anybody clear
[1:05:44] and they dwell there verse three and
[1:05:47] they say one to another
[1:05:50] go to in other words come
[1:05:54] let us make bricks and burn them totally
[1:05:58] and they had breaks for stone and slam
[1:06:01] her dead for murders they say
[1:06:04] come let us build a city
[1:06:08] and a tower who stop marriage what
[1:06:12] the heaven what a unity
[1:06:15] and let us make us a name a denomination
[1:06:19] the first denomination in the bible
[1:06:22] that's why in the book in revelation the
[1:06:24] bible says you have a name that i hate
[1:06:29] anybody clear let us make a name
[1:06:32] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[1:06:36] face of the
[1:06:37] world we want to stay together we want
[1:06:40] to stick together
[1:06:41] let's build something let everybody stay
[1:06:44] let
[1:06:44] hold the denomination under our own name
[1:06:48] who was doing this you go back to verse
[1:06:50] 10 to chapter 10
[1:06:52] you're going to see nimrod
[1:06:56] verse 5 and the lord came down
[1:06:59] to see the city and the tower which the
[1:07:02] children of
[1:07:03] men built everybody together remember
[1:07:07] this is after the flood this is not
[1:07:10] before the flood everybody else already
[1:07:12] died
[1:07:13] this is the generation after the flood
[1:07:15] and the lord say
[1:07:17] behold the people is water
[1:07:20] so everybody in the earth
[1:07:24] not only have they the same language
[1:07:28] the same speech but they also have the
[1:07:31] same mind
[1:07:36] but not under god
[1:07:39] under amen beyond the people is one
[1:07:45] and they have water oh
[1:07:49] no exception i want you to get clearly
[1:07:53] no exception have one language
[1:07:56] everybody speak english i'm just taking
[1:07:58] an example
[1:08:01] and this they begin to do and now
[1:08:04] nothing will work when unity is there
[1:08:08] there is
[1:08:09] power amen
[1:08:12] whether it's under god or without god
[1:08:15] they still have power
[1:08:16] because it's the laws of god
[1:08:21] you commit adultery you can have a child
[1:08:24] you get married you can have a child
[1:08:27] because
[1:08:28] you're going through the laws but one is
[1:08:30] bad
[1:08:31] one is good yet both get children
[1:08:39] make sense somebody asked me a question
[1:08:43] can a woman preach
[1:08:44] what about if a woman preached and
[1:08:46] somebody said i say no problem you can
[1:08:48] have a child through adultery
[1:08:52] said the child will leave but adultery
[1:08:54] will be condemned
[1:08:56] i said you can get saved but that woman
[1:08:58] is condemned by the scripture
[1:09:04] hallelujah and nothing will restrain
[1:09:08] from them
[1:09:09] which they have what they were working
[1:09:13] by their
[1:09:13] imagination not inspiration
[1:09:17] noah built an ark with the inspiration
[1:09:20] of god
[1:09:21] but now these kind of men were going
[1:09:24] with their water
[1:09:28] so everybody one language one mind
[1:09:32] which is an earthly mind imagination
[1:09:36] to do god said come let us go down
[1:09:41] and there confront them god came to
[1:09:44] confuse them
[1:09:46] when the church goes in unity they
[1:09:49] therefore want to come and confuse the
[1:09:51] church
[1:09:52] this one said this one did this this one
[1:09:55] say
[1:09:56] this one this this this one say this one
[1:09:58] to bring confusion
[1:10:00] and break the unity
[1:10:05] recognize the devil in his tactics then
[1:10:07] we're going to overcome
[1:10:09] when somebody brings something you stop
[1:10:11] you say wait a minute
[1:10:13] you talking about sister so-and-so hold
[1:10:16] on right there
[1:10:18] let me call the sister i'm going to pick
[1:10:21] sister brilliant sister bridget
[1:10:23] god bless you i have sister x here
[1:10:26] she just told me that you said this this
[1:10:28] this this
[1:10:30] this realize the system you're going to
[1:10:32] drive the devil
[1:10:34] out they have two choices what brother
[1:10:37] said either they're going to be
[1:10:38] converted
[1:10:39] or they're going to leave you and go
[1:10:40] somewhere else
[1:10:43] anybody clear go to
[1:10:46] let us go down and they'll confirm their
[1:10:49] language
[1:10:50] that they may not understand what one
[1:10:53] another we're not talking
[1:10:55] anymore the same language what's gonna
[1:10:58] happen
[1:10:59] so the lord scattered them abroad from
[1:11:01] there upon the face of all the earth
[1:11:04] and they left up to build the water so
[1:11:07] when
[1:11:08] we are not in unity speaking the same
[1:11:11] thing
[1:11:12] that's why you go in the new testament
[1:11:14] paul was telling the church to have one
[1:11:16] mind
[1:11:18] because you want to stop the progress of
[1:11:21] the work you're trying to achieve
[1:11:23] by having 3 7 twenty forty miles
[1:11:27] anybody here and therefore is the name
[1:11:30] of it called water
[1:11:32] bevel meaning confusion because the lord
[1:11:36] did there confined the language of the
[1:11:38] earth
[1:11:39] of all the earth and from there did the
[1:11:42] lord scatter them abroad
[1:11:44] from the face of the the earth so from
[1:11:47] here
[1:11:48] we found out that this unity was broken
[1:11:51] in pieces
[1:11:52] everybody went to their own place
[1:11:55] but carrying the same knowledge
[1:11:58] under a different language
[1:12:02] do you get me that's why you can look at
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:06] deity of the greek the gods of the greek
[1:12:11] the gods of the roman the gods of the
[1:12:14] indian the god of the egyptian you're
[1:12:17] gonna find
[1:12:17] similarity in those other worshipping
[1:12:21] because the scatter but the concept
[1:12:25] were gone differently you go in the east
[1:12:28] you're gonna see
[1:12:29] mother and children you go to the
[1:12:31] egyptian mother and children
[1:12:33] you go to the roman mother and children
[1:12:35] they all were living in one place
[1:12:38] they got scattered the language changed
[1:12:41] but the
[1:12:42] doctrine remained the same
[1:12:47] if they were condemned when they were in
[1:12:50] unity
[1:12:51] even though they scattered everywhere
[1:12:54] they scattered
[1:12:55] they were all condemned if they were
[1:12:59] condemned
[1:12:59] as united states
[1:13:03] are you following me when they become
[1:13:06] separate state
[1:13:08] they were still condemned because they
[1:13:11] carried the same idolatry
[1:13:13] and doctrine of nimrod everybody clear
[1:13:17] now let's go job to verse 31
[1:13:20] now watch now the beginning of your
[1:13:22] faith
[1:13:24] i hope time is not flying on me let's go
[1:13:28] verse 31 and who ah
[1:13:31] we're talking about abraham so brother
[1:13:34] stephen
[1:13:36] abraham came right from the midst of
[1:13:40] this
[1:13:43] there is a key i want you to catch
[1:13:44] tonight then
[1:13:46] your legalistic way of the message will
[1:13:48] be gone
[1:13:51] then when god gives you a command
[1:13:54] you will understand it is not a law
[1:13:57] but it is actually mercy
[1:14:02] when they say don't wear high heels you
[1:14:04] won't take it anymore as a lord
[1:14:09] you follow me right in the midst of
[1:14:13] this where was our father
[1:14:17] abraham how can our father
[1:14:22] which we preach all these years came up
[1:14:25] from the midst of that
[1:14:27] he was supposed to be living separate a
[1:14:30] good man
[1:14:32] he came from there
[1:14:35] amen and terror took abraham his son
[1:14:39] and lord the son of heron his son's son
[1:14:43] and sarah his daughter-in-law his son's
[1:14:46] abraham's wife
[1:14:47] and they went forth with them from
[1:14:50] water of the water
[1:14:54] so abraham came out
[1:14:58] from babylon everybody scattered
[1:15:02] but abraham remained in babylon
[1:15:05] in the very center of it abraham never
[1:15:09] moved
[1:15:10] and god went in the center of the devil
[1:15:14] headquarter
[1:15:15] and pick abraham and pull him out of it
[1:15:22] god did not go in the one that scattered
[1:15:25] in africa
[1:15:26] he didn't go to the one that went to
[1:15:28] america he went to the one to the
[1:15:31] very headquarter just
[1:15:34] like when jesus died he went to hell
[1:15:38] and in the very corner of the
[1:15:40] headquarters of the devil
[1:15:42] he picked the old testament said and
[1:15:45] pulled them out of him
[1:15:47] are you there there is no limitation for
[1:15:50] god to rescue his
[1:15:52] child amen no matter how deep you are
[1:15:56] in the mark of this world amazing grace
[1:15:59] will reach down
[1:16:00] go down go down pick you up and pull you
[1:16:04] up again
[1:16:06] are you there it is easy to think maybe
[1:16:10] he can take abraham out of egypt no
[1:16:13] he went to the very corner and left a
[1:16:15] predestinated seat there
[1:16:17] to prove to the devil that i can give
[1:16:20] you moses
[1:16:21] and you can take care of me you can let
[1:16:25] him grow
[1:16:26] let him in enjoy life and train him the
[1:16:29] bible says
[1:16:29] moses was trained in all the what wisdom
[1:16:33] of egypt
[1:16:34] yet i can come and break that wisdom
[1:16:38] and turn that prophet against you
[1:16:41] you might be trained under somebody
[1:16:46] i hope you get it are you there
[1:16:49] you might be trained under somebody and
[1:16:52] god
[1:16:52] let that person train you and turn
[1:16:55] around and use you as a weapon to bring
[1:16:57] it
[1:17:01] it's down the scripture ever here
[1:17:05] and he went forth with them from all of
[1:17:07] the counties
[1:17:09] to go into the land of water now
[1:17:12] somebody called
[1:17:13] abraham left this branch of group
[1:17:17] everybody here and went for the land of
[1:17:20] canaan
[1:17:22] but abraham was not a christian
[1:17:27] let's go to genesis 12 verse 1. now the
[1:17:30] lord has said to abraham
[1:17:33] get out from your water for the first
[1:17:36] time
[1:17:37] when god began to deal with an
[1:17:39] individual
[1:17:41] that was under the leadership of the
[1:17:44] system of nimrod god told that
[1:17:48] individual to separate from his country

[1:18:35] abraham left this jurisdiction

[1:21:54] god call him he took his family out
[1:21:58] he moved from uh of the cardin he went
[1:22:00] to aaron and when his father died
[1:22:03] he went to the land of canaan a back
[1:22:05] here
[1:22:06] then god gave him a promise that you're
[1:22:08] going to be the father of
[1:22:10] many families many nations
[1:22:13] what is going on let's go now to
[1:22:15] galatians 3.
[1:22:19] are you okay
[1:22:24] i want you to get something then you're
[1:22:25] going to understand everything even on
[1:22:28] your christmas
[1:22:32] we never been taught about christmas
[1:22:35] give me only time tonight and you're
[1:22:37] going to see what's going
[1:22:38] on why you do why we don't do certain
[1:22:42] things
[1:22:43] not because of a legalistic approach
[1:22:46] we're putting people in prison we're
[1:22:47] putting people in prison
[1:22:50] missing the mind of god galatians
[1:22:53] 3 are you there verse 6
[1:22:56] everybody clear even as who
[1:23:01] abraham believed god and he was
[1:23:03] accounted to him for what
[1:23:06] for righteousness brother kelly know you
[1:23:08] there for
[1:23:09] that day which are of what god
[1:23:12] now begin to speak about the faith
[1:23:20] the faith you already sent the law
[1:23:23] they don't know of faith the same are
[1:23:26] the children of water
[1:23:28] abraham so the jews that are born
[1:23:32] by abraham having faith doubts are the
[1:23:35] children of
[1:23:36] abraham because they automatically they
[1:23:37] are jews
[1:23:40] watch this clearly verse eight
[1:23:43] catch it make sure you read it yourself
[1:23:45] verse eight
[1:23:46] it's not on the board are you there
[1:23:50] and the scripture
[1:23:53] for seeing that god will
[1:23:57] justify the jews
[1:24:04] remember everybody that was here was
[1:24:06] water
[1:24:08] heathen and what pagan or coward
[1:24:12] the people of the world worldly people
[1:24:15] but what god was doing with abraham
[1:24:20] was a preview to what he's gonna do to
[1:24:23] who
[1:24:25] to the hidden so abraham
[1:24:29] was also a what
[1:24:35] are you there that's why god told him
[1:24:39] i'm pulling you from hedonism
[1:24:43] you follow me i want to clean you up
[1:24:48] separate from your country
[1:24:52] separate from your family separate from
[1:24:55] your
[1:24:56] father's house i'm gonna take you out
[1:24:59] somewhere
[1:25:02] why the scripture for saying
[1:25:06] that god will justify the hidden
[1:25:10] by who by through faith
[1:25:14] preach before the gospel to who
[1:25:17] how did he preach the gospel to abraham
[1:25:21] what is preaching the gospel who
[1:25:22] preached the gospel to abraham
[1:25:27] did he have a pastor
[1:25:32] preach the gospel before to abraham
[1:25:36] saying in who you shall all the nation
[1:25:40] be water so right here abraham was a
[1:25:43] hidden
[1:25:45] not a jew not a christian
[1:25:48] job to verse 14 that
[1:25:52] the blessings of abraham may come
[1:25:55] on the who the hidden
[1:25:58] through who i have a seed
[1:26:02] that seed is called jesus christ
[1:26:06] it's one seed i'm gonna use that seed
[1:26:09] through your door abraham to go
[1:26:12] back to the gentile and to carry them
[1:26:15] out
[1:26:16] because out of every kindred every
[1:26:19] tongue
[1:26:20] every nation i am pulling my people back
[1:26:23] you follow me hallelujah
[1:26:28] that we might receive the promise of
[1:26:31] water
[1:26:33] who's going to receive the promise of
[1:26:34] the spirit not
[1:26:36] the jew the who can you say it aloud
[1:26:41] oh praise god the gentile
[1:26:44] true faith everybody follow me
[1:26:47] present i speak after the manner of men
[1:26:50] do it be but a man's covenant
[1:26:53] yet if he be confirmed no mendizano
[1:26:56] or add there too watch verse 16
[1:26:59] now to abraham and his what
[1:27:03] singular where the promise made
[1:27:06] paul very detailed he said not
[1:27:10] and to his what paul is saying
[1:27:14] to you that go back in the old testament
[1:27:16] you will notice that god
[1:27:18] never spoke about seed in plural
[1:27:21] not seed as of many
[1:27:25] but as of water and to your seed which
[1:27:29] is who
[1:27:30] so that seed of abraham is the man of
[1:27:33] galilee
[1:27:35] which is the son of god who
[1:27:38] is god in other words i
[1:27:41] am gonna enter the world through the
[1:27:45] door of the jewish people
[1:27:47] as a man who's gonna be called jesus
[1:27:51] christ
[1:27:51] and i myself will die for them
[1:27:54] be buried resurrected so i can go
[1:27:58] all over the world and preach the gospel
[1:28:02] and as many as believe and will receive
[1:28:05] him shall be called sons of who
[1:28:10] everybody here so far is the bible
[1:28:12] lovely
[1:28:14] yummy blessed be the name of the lord

[1:28:52] concluded
[1:28:54] all under sin that the promise by faith
[1:28:57] of jesus christ
[1:28:58] might be given to them that believe

[1:30:31] abraham eden let's go to roman two now
[1:30:34] we get
[1:30:34] really deep to them honey
[1:30:43] let's go to roman two if you dare you
[1:30:45] can say amen where did you learn the
[1:30:48] bible like this
[1:30:52] it is the message of the hour
[1:31:09] amen amen
[1:31:13] one second let's bring you
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:36] if not i can use that one
[1:31:40] just like market daily say this
[1:31:51] amen everything clear
[1:31:56] let me get the bazooka
[1:32:09] thank you everybody clear
[1:32:12] ah blessed be the name of the lord
[1:32:15] let's go to roman 2
[1:32:19] verse 29 everybody clear everybody there
[1:32:23] let me look at the time yeah
[1:32:28] i won't take you too long even though
[1:32:30] kids don't have school
[1:32:31] [Laughter]
[1:32:34] romans 2 chapter 28 you there for he is
[1:32:38] not a what
[1:32:39] now paul is removing everything from
[1:32:42] israel
[1:32:44] you see now you give credit to the jews
[1:32:46] i'm removing that
[1:32:48] i was only using them as a door there is
[1:32:51] neither
[1:32:51] no jews which is of outwardly
[1:32:55] in other words it's not natural it's not
[1:32:57] the flesh
[1:32:59] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:33:02] outward
[1:33:02] in the flesh but he is a jew
[1:33:06] which is one water inwardly so the true
[1:33:10] jew
[1:33:11] is not the natural man it is the inside
[1:33:15] man
[1:33:16] and those jews are everywhere not only
[1:33:18] in israel
[1:33:20] amen and circumcision
[1:33:23] is that of the heart in the spirit
[1:33:26] and not in the letter whose presence is
[1:33:29] not of man but of who
[1:33:31] god amen go to chapter three
[1:33:36] verse one paul
[1:33:39] we know that we gave credit to the jews
[1:33:42] we know that the jews the gospel came to
[1:33:44] the jews
[1:33:45] they're the one that have abraham they
[1:33:48] have isaac jacob
[1:33:49] so do you mean that what they did is
[1:33:51] nothing
[1:33:54] ever clear roman uh three verse one
[1:33:57] what advantage then has the what
[1:34:01] so paul is asking if the jew is no more
[1:34:04] connected to the flesh
[1:34:06] so what is the advantage of being a jew
[1:34:09] or what prophet is there of what
[1:34:12] circumcision
[1:34:15] paul is answering much every way
[1:34:18] chiefly because that to them
[1:34:21] were committed the oracle of what
[1:34:24] god used them as a sample
[1:34:28] to work something through them but it
[1:34:31] was a dog god he was using
[1:34:33] to enter the world to rescue all his
[1:34:36] people
[1:34:37] anybody clear so far blessed be the name
[1:34:40] of the lord verse 3
[1:34:42] for what if some did not believe
[1:34:46] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[1:34:48] god without effect
[1:34:50] in other words if all the jews did not
[1:34:54] believe in the law
[1:34:55] it doesn't make the law of non-effect
[1:34:59] if some people don't believe the message
[1:35:02] it doesn't make the message of
[1:35:05] non-effect
[1:35:06] the message is still god provided way
[1:35:10] for this hour
[1:35:11] whether you believe it or not the
[1:35:13] message stand
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:17] hallelujah your unbelief will not hinder
[1:35:21] god
[1:35:21] it will hinder yourself god will
[1:35:24] continue his program and does that have
[1:35:27] the love of god
[1:35:28] will receive the truth of the hour be
[1:35:31] changed and ready for the rapture
[1:35:34] hallelujah jump to verse nine
[1:35:38] blessed be the name of the lord what
[1:35:40] then
[1:35:41] are we better than they no in no wise
[1:35:45] for we have before prove both what
[1:35:50] and what that they are all around the
[1:35:53] world
[1:35:54] you see now everybody under sin
[1:35:59] you see now no more privilege
[1:36:02] hallelujah let's jump to verse
[1:36:06] 10. as it is written there is none
[1:36:09] righteous
[1:36:10] no not one there is none that understand
[1:36:14] there is none that sick after god matter
[1:36:16] of fact the jews crucified the messiah
[1:36:19] they are all gone out of the way they
[1:36:22] are all together become unprofitable
[1:36:25] there is none that is good no not what
[1:36:29] nobody hallelujah
[1:36:32] jump to verse 19 now we know
[1:36:36] that what thinks whatsoever the law says
[1:36:40] it says to them who are under the law
[1:36:42] that every month might be stopped
[1:36:45] and all the water all
[1:36:48] the water watch here oh the
[1:36:52] world might be underwater
[1:36:55] guilty before who so everybody's
[1:36:59] guilty abraham came
[1:37:03] from there
[1:37:07] everybody clear verse 20 therefore
[1:37:11] by the deed of the law there shall
[1:37:14] no flesh be justified in his sight
[1:37:17] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[1:37:20] but the righteousness of god without the
[1:37:23] law is manifested
[1:37:24] being witnessed by the law and the
[1:37:28] prophet ever clear verse 22
[1:37:31] even the righteousness of god which is
[1:37:34] by faith
[1:37:35] abraham of jesus christ to all
[1:37:39] and upon all that believe for there is
[1:37:42] no word
[1:37:44] for i have done what and come what
[1:37:48] short of the glory of who everybody
[1:37:52] on the planet is completely short from
[1:37:55] the glory of god
[1:37:56] yet god created you for his glory
[1:38:00] now he's coming to redeem you so that
[1:38:03] you can manifest that glory
[1:38:05] therefore glorify god in your body
[1:38:11] hallelujah verse 27
[1:38:14] where is the busting then it is
[1:38:17] excluded by what law of work
[1:38:21] nay but by the law of what therefore we
[1:38:24] conclude that
[1:38:25] a man is justified by
[1:38:29] faith without the deed of the is he
[1:38:32] the god of the jews only is he not
[1:38:36] also the god of the gender yes of the
[1:38:39] word
[1:38:42] you understand the jew was just a temple
[1:38:46] amen saying it is
[1:38:49] one god which shall justify their
[1:38:52] circumcision the jews by faith
[1:38:55] and the uncircumcision the gender
[1:38:58] through what
[1:39:00] both of us we are equal
[1:39:03] you understand now let's go to roman
[1:39:06] four now
[1:39:07] amen jump to verse nine
[1:39:10] comes this blessedness then upon the
[1:39:14] circumcision only
[1:39:16] or upon the uncircumcision only the
[1:39:18] circumcision are the jews
[1:39:20] they were the one that was circumcised
[1:39:23] they are circumcision are the gentiles
[1:39:25] the hidden or the pagan everybody clear
[1:39:28] for we say that faith was welcome to
[1:39:32] abraham for what
[1:39:34] now we're going back to abraham how was
[1:39:37] he then reckoned watch paul
[1:39:41] when he was in what circumcision
[1:39:45] or in what in other words the promise of
[1:39:49] god
[1:39:50] of abraham was given to
[1:39:53] abraham when he was a jew
[1:39:56] or was he given to him when he was a
[1:39:59] hidden
[1:40:04] you see now i'm going out from the
[1:40:07] jewish back to the original
[1:40:09] america for we say
[1:40:12] abraham that faith was of verse 10 how
[1:40:15] was he then reckoned
[1:40:17] when he was in circumcision or in our
[1:40:20] circumcision
[1:40:21] not in circumcision but in what
[1:40:25] and circumcision and he received the son
[1:40:28] of circumcision as a
[1:40:30] seal a confirmation in other words
[1:40:33] god called abraham when abraham was
[1:40:37] a hidden not a jew
[1:40:41] and god gave him the promise when he was
[1:40:44] not
[1:40:45] circumcised yet he has nothing
[1:40:48] to do with jews that's why
[1:40:51] jesus was not a jew
[1:40:57] he was not a gentile he have no
[1:41:00] father no mother no beginning
[1:41:04] of days no ending the blood of jesus was
[1:41:08] created by god
[1:41:11] everybody clear job 2 verse 13
[1:41:14] amen uh
[1:41:18] oh my god let me go to verse 11 and we
[1:41:21] received the son of circumcision
[1:41:23] a seal of righteousness of faith which
[1:41:26] he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:41:29] that he might be the father of all them
[1:41:32] that believe
[1:41:34] though they be not what even though they
[1:41:37] are gentle
[1:41:39] what matter is the predestinated seed
[1:41:44] that's all i'm looking at i'm not
[1:41:45] looking at whether you are jew or gender
[1:41:48] my children are scattered that's why i
[1:41:51] gave
[1:41:52] abraham the promise when he was not a
[1:41:55] jew
[1:41:56] because if abraham was a jew the jew
[1:41:58] will kick you
[1:41:59] all out now i gave him when he was a
[1:42:02] gentile
[1:42:03] so the jew will not boast if he begin to
[1:42:06] say abraham is our father
[1:42:08] we're going to ask a jew was abraham a
[1:42:10] jew or he was a gentile
[1:42:11] he was a gentile so i am part of it
[1:42:16] you understand now god took it away from
[1:42:19] the jew
[1:42:21] everybody clear verse 12 and the father
[1:42:24] of circumcision
[1:42:26] to them who are not of circumcision only
[1:42:28] but who also walk in the step of the
[1:42:30] faith of our father
[1:42:32] abraham which he had been yet
[1:42:35] uncircumcised
[1:42:36] for the promise that he should be heir
[1:42:39] of the world
[1:42:40] now not only one one uh one
[1:42:43] person but the whole world was not to
[1:42:46] abraham
[1:42:47] or to his seed through the law but
[1:42:49] through the righteousness of what
[1:42:52] faith job to verse 17.
[1:42:55] as it is written i have made you a
[1:42:58] father of many water
[1:43:00] one person i'm gonna make you a great
[1:43:02] nation
[1:43:03] but out of you i'm gonna go toward the
[1:43:06] nation
[1:43:08] and carry them before him who believe
[1:43:12] even god who makes alive the dead
[1:43:15] and call those things which be not as
[1:43:18] though the way
[1:43:18] ever clear who against hope believe in
[1:43:22] hope
[1:43:23] that he might become the father of many
[1:43:26] what
[1:43:27] according to that which was spoken so
[1:43:30] shall your seed be ever clear
[1:43:34] go now to ephesians 2 i might have to
[1:43:36] stop somewhere
[1:43:37] i thought i'm going to get this finish
[1:43:40] let's go to ephesians chapter 2
[1:43:43] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:43:50] lord
[1:43:53] ephesians 2 verse 11.
[1:43:57] are you there wherefore remember
[1:44:00] that you being in tampa who
[1:44:05] pagan and circumcised hidden
[1:44:09] in the flesh not in the heart
[1:44:13] because now god is now looking at the
[1:44:15] flesh
[1:44:17] who are called on circumcision
[1:44:20] but that which is co-op in other words
[1:44:23] when the jew sees you
[1:44:24] they call you on circumstance that's why
[1:44:27] david look at goliath and say on
[1:44:29] circumstance philistine
[1:44:31] now paul say let's put the ball down
[1:44:34] let's start from the beginning you claim
[1:44:36] abraham to be your father
[1:44:38] was he circumcised or not
[1:44:42] no wonder they kill him are you there
[1:44:45] by which is caused circumcision in the
[1:44:48] flesh by hands
[1:44:50] that at that time you were without who
[1:44:54] being alien from the commonwealth of who
[1:44:58] and stranger from the covenant of
[1:45:00] promise having no one
[1:45:03] and without him in the
[1:45:06] because everybody was under the idolatry
[1:45:10] of me murder
[1:45:13] are you there everybody shut up there
[1:45:17] everybody clear but now in
[1:45:20] christ jesus you who sometimes were a
[1:45:24] pharaoh are made near by the blood of
[1:45:27] jesus
[1:45:29] for he is our who has made
[1:45:32] both we are no more separated
[1:45:36] no more jew and greek and has broken me
[1:45:39] the wall of what
[1:45:40] partition between so when jesus christ
[1:45:43] came
[1:45:44] that difference jew gentile jesus broke
[1:45:47] it
[1:45:49] say my children are everywhere
[1:45:52] nobody can boast anybody clear
[1:45:55] having abolishing his flesh the enmity
[1:45:59] even the law of commandment contained in
[1:46:01] ordinance
[1:46:02] for to make in himself of to
[1:46:05] one human so making peace
[1:46:08] and that he might reconcile both to who
[1:46:12] in one body by the cross
[1:46:15] having slain the enmity thereby and
[1:46:19] came and preached peace to you which
[1:46:22] were
[1:46:22] a pharaoh and to them that are what
[1:46:25] near verse 19 now therefore you are no
[1:46:28] more
[1:46:31] don't be complex
[1:46:34] don't be complex when you meet a jew
[1:46:38] ah this is a jew let me see a jew oh
[1:46:41] this is the first time i see a jew
[1:46:43] the real jew is you
[1:46:46] are you there the real jew is of the
[1:46:50] heart
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:52] are you there you are no more stranger
[1:46:56] and foreign but fellow what when we meet
[1:47:00] we say hey
[1:47:02] how is our father david you are gentle
[1:47:05] saying david yes what about my father
[1:47:07] abraham abraham your father yes by
[1:47:10] faith hallelujah
[1:47:14] but fellow citizen with the saint and of
[1:47:17] the household of who
[1:47:21] what are we glowing by there
[1:47:25] are you there jesus met the woman at the
[1:47:28] world
[1:47:29] our father worshipped in this mountain
[1:47:32] and he say
[1:47:33] that in jerusalem is the place where men
[1:47:36] ought to worship
[1:47:37] jesus said unto a woman believe me
[1:47:41] the hour cometh when it shall be neither
[1:47:44] in this
[1:47:46] you the samaritan no in a
[1:47:50] i'm crossing everything up nor in
[1:47:53] jerusalem
[1:47:54] worship the father you worship you know
[1:47:57] not what in other words i'm not gonna
[1:47:59] decline that i'm using the jews
[1:48:01] because you samaritan you don't know
[1:48:03] what you worship
[1:48:05] are you there we know what we worship
[1:48:08] for salvation is of the
[1:48:09] jew of the jew means from the jew
[1:48:13] because that's the door i used amen
[1:48:16] but the allah cometh and now he's one
[1:48:19] the true
[1:48:21] worshiper so was israel not true
[1:48:23] worshiper
[1:48:26] you see now the true worshiper
[1:48:29] shall worship the father in
[1:48:32] and in what for the father seeketh
[1:48:36] such to worship him in other words i'm
[1:48:40] making a transition
[1:48:42] i use you temporarily now i
[1:48:46] have come it is no more a place
[1:48:49] no more a nation no more a race
[1:48:53] no more a culture it is god
[1:48:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:02] he that believes in the son of god has
[1:49:05] the witness in himself
[1:49:07] he that believeth not god has made him a
[1:49:10] liar because he believed not the record
[1:49:12] that god gave his son
[1:49:14] and this is the record that god has
[1:49:17] given to us
[1:49:18] eternal life and this life is in his
[1:49:21] son not in the jews
[1:49:24] in christ
[1:49:28] are you there he that has the son has
[1:49:32] life
[1:49:33] and he's that has not the son of god has
[1:49:36] not
[1:49:36] life that's why brother branham said to
[1:49:38] know him
[1:49:40] is life are you there
[1:49:43] are you there amen let me go back on
[1:49:46] this one
[1:49:47] what about that philadelphian age
[1:49:51] and yes the other ages too did they
[1:49:54] really accept this reality of christ
[1:49:57] no sir which reality even though luther
[1:50:00] brought the truth of justification
[1:50:03] the romans church and its eastern
[1:50:05] counterpart
[1:50:06] the orthodox church still come to what
[1:50:11] now works are fine but they don't save
[1:50:14] you
[1:50:16] they don't make you perfect it is christ
[1:50:19] or water
[1:50:20] it is no longer jewish
[1:50:24] it is in the person of christ
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] and it is not even quest and work
[1:50:32] it is crushed alone
[1:50:36] this age begins begun
[1:50:39] the years of armenianism that does not
[1:50:43] believe in christ
[1:50:44] as the reality he does not sing
[1:50:48] nothing but the blood for it seeing
[1:50:50] nothing but the blood and my own conduct
[1:50:54] now i believe in good conduct if you are
[1:50:57] saved
[1:50:57] you will do righteously we have already
[1:51:00] gone over that
[1:51:01] but let me tell you now salvation is not
[1:51:05] jesus plus
[1:51:08] it is jesus alone salvation is of god
[1:51:13] from start to finish it is all
[1:51:18] let his life be in me let it be his
[1:51:22] blood that cleans me
[1:51:24] let it be his spirit that fills me
[1:51:27] let it be his word in my heart and mouth
[1:51:30] let it be his trap that heal me let
[1:51:34] it be jesus and jesus alone
[1:51:38] not by works of righteousness which i
[1:51:40] have done
[1:51:41] no sir christ this man amen
[1:51:46] hallelujah hallelujah what is the key
[1:51:51] brother stephen you're trying to draft
[1:51:53] tonight
[1:51:54] god is calling us
[1:51:59] for a separation from hedonism
[1:52:03] and gentile lifestyle
[1:52:07] you understand now everybody condemned
[1:52:10] shut up and sin every single nation in
[1:52:14] sin
[1:52:15] there is no nation that you can prove
[1:52:18] that is better than another nation
[1:52:20] all condemned in sin
[1:52:24] are you there so when god is calling you
[1:52:27] out
[1:52:28] god wants you to live a different life
[1:52:32] different than where you came from
[1:52:35] different
[1:52:35] than the life of the hidden because the
[1:52:38] jew to begin with
[1:52:40] their father was also hidden
[1:52:44] are you there so when god say don't wear
[1:52:48] makeup
[1:52:49] it is not about the law it is a
[1:52:52] separation from hedonism that's why
[1:52:55] brother branham said
[1:52:57] make up come from the zulu it is a
[1:53:00] hidden thread
[1:53:01] so when i'm separating you i'm not
[1:53:04] giving you a law
[1:53:05] i'm separating you from hedonism
[1:53:12] are you there let's finish by this why
[1:53:15] do you separated me
[1:53:17] from hedonism why
[1:53:21] at 26 and i said who are the lord
[1:53:25] and he say i'm jesus whom that
[1:53:26] persecutes
[1:53:28] but rise and stand up on their feet for
[1:53:31] i have appeared
[1:53:32] unto thee for this purpose to make thee
[1:53:38] hallelujah
[1:53:41] hallelujah to make thee a water
[1:53:45] and a witness both of these things which
[1:53:48] you have seen
[1:53:49] and of those in which i will appear unto
[1:53:52] thee
[1:53:53] this is paul delivering thee from the
[1:53:56] water
[1:53:57] those people were the jew
[1:54:01] god is talking to paul that i am
[1:54:04] picking you up i am separating you from
[1:54:08] the law
[1:54:09] from the pharisee for the sadducee from
[1:54:12] everything that is of israel
[1:54:17] are you there and i am also separating
[1:54:20] you from the gentile
[1:54:22] i want you to be a nation that is not
[1:54:25] reckoned
[1:54:26] on the earth when you look their city
[1:54:29] their city is not here
[1:54:31] abraham was looking for that city it was
[1:54:33] not an earthly city
[1:54:35] you representing a different nation i
[1:54:38] want you to behave
[1:54:39] different i want you to talk different i
[1:54:42] want you to dress
[1:54:43] different i want you to live different
[1:54:46] because
[1:54:47] my nation is not represented here my
[1:54:50] kingdom is not of this world
[1:54:53] you understand now delivering this from
[1:54:57] the people
[1:54:58] and from the water not the gentile
[1:55:01] because when you say dental yes gentle
[1:55:03] was out of worship
[1:55:04] no gentile and jews are you there
[1:55:08] unto whom now are sandy i'm sending you
[1:55:11] to who
[1:55:14] to gentile why do you send him to the
[1:55:17] gender
[1:55:20] to open the water so the eyes of the
[1:55:24] gentile
[1:55:24] are caused by the
[1:55:29] veil of babylon you understand now
[1:55:33] so when the gospel comes is coming to
[1:55:36] open your eyes when you used to wear
[1:55:39] paint
[1:55:40] then you look you take the paint away
[1:55:43] not by law
[1:55:44] but by separation from agenda
[1:55:50] you follow me that's why the message is
[1:55:52] not a law
[1:55:53] we put a woman in bondage no we actually
[1:55:57] telling the woman the way she was
[1:55:59] supposed to live
[1:56:02] are you there to open their eyes
[1:56:05] and to turn who who's them
[1:56:08] gentle them from water so gentiles under
[1:56:13] darkness
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:17] to light and from the power of who
[1:56:20] gentiles were under the power of satan
[1:56:23] through the will through the gospel of
[1:56:27] nimrod he polluted everything
[1:56:31] that they may receive forgiveness of sin
[1:56:34] an inheritance among them which are
[1:56:36] sanctified by what
[1:56:38] again abraham back to abraham and
[1:56:41] circumcised

[1:57:42] coming
[1:57:42] to move you out of the kingdom of the

[2:05:10] reveal manner
[2:05:11] and to understand lord father just like

[2:05:15] we could go through this channel and
[2:05:17] continue lord further to uncover the
[2:05:19] black dog
[2:05:20] but lord you the one that touched me to
[2:05:23] come back
[2:05:24] to give a key to your children to
[2:05:26] understand that
[2:05:27] i am not unfolding this to put you in a
[2:05:30] bondage
[2:05:30] i'm unfolding this i'm actually
[2:05:33] delivering you
[2:05:34] from the power of satan from the kingdom
[2:05:37] of the world
[2:05:38] from all the lifestyle and the threat
[2:05:42] of the hidden that are represented in
[2:05:45] hell
[2:05:45] that's why my prophet went to hell and
[2:05:48] saw those straight
[2:05:49] and saw the women with eyes like cut and
[2:05:52] saw those women back in jesse penny
[2:05:54] and he understood that those three
[2:05:57] originated from hell
[2:05:58] they were expressed lord in the
[2:06:00] scripture through jezebel
[2:06:02] there was expressed through many people
[2:06:04] lord father it's not that your people
[2:06:06] want to be strange into a law it is not
[2:06:09] a law
[2:06:09] our law is love lord father it's love
[2:06:12] that constrains you
[2:06:13] that comes lord bringing those things
[2:06:15] out for your children
[2:06:17] to to all to to have their eyes open to
[2:06:20] be completely free
[2:06:22] from the lust of the eyes from the lust
[2:06:25] of the flesh for the proud of this life
[2:06:28] lord
[2:06:29] father made you help the young people
[2:06:31] understand lord
[2:06:32] that lord father lust is the wrong thing

[2:06:52] picture

[2:06:56] are actually coping a lifestyle
[2:06:58] of the gender where did you copy what
[2:07:01] you doing
[2:07:02] where did you copy what you presenting
[2:07:04] where did you copy what you are
[2:07:05] portraying
[2:07:07] father may the revelation drop deep that
[2:07:10] it's not a bunch of code of ethic
[2:07:13] but it's nothing but the unfailing body
[2:07:16] word of the son of man
[2:07:17] because when you send your word your
[2:07:19] word come to heal your children
[2:07:21] father we commit them unto the hand and
[2:07:24] are breaking
[2:07:25] of the devil every spirit that is trying
[2:07:28] to
[2:07:28] bind this church and these young people

[2:08:01] church we love you i hope you got the
[2:08:05] concept
[2:08:06] we're gonna dig a load to be on sunday
[2:08:08] then we get back to where we were
[2:08:10] to finish this up so you understand
[2:08:13] there is a concept there is a key
[2:08:15] it is not legalist when you present the
[2:08:19] message in the legalistic way
[2:08:20] you miss it it is love
[2:08:26] amen thank you my brother
[2:08:29] [Music]
[2:08:32] amen that was good thank you lord
[2:08:37] i was thinking i wrote something down uh
[2:08:40] sunday evening
[2:08:41] um brother shango mentioned something it
[2:08:44] was either wednesday or sunday evening
[2:08:45] but
[2:08:46] i was talking about when the serpent
[2:08:48] beguiled eve
[2:08:49] in the garden of eden it actually might
[2:08:51] have been brother tim cross last
[2:08:53] wednesday
[2:08:55] but i was thinking about it and he was
[2:08:58] trying to deceive eve
[2:09:00] and say i like basically hear what i'm
[2:09:04] saying and you'll be as
[2:09:05] gods and she missed that she was of gods
[2:09:09] and that was something brother shango
[2:09:11] where brother tim was mentioning the
[2:09:12] other week
[2:09:13] so i thought about it i was sitting in
[2:09:14] my seat and i'm like she didn't have a
[2:09:16] revelation of who she
[2:09:18] was because if she did she wouldn't have
[2:09:19] been deceived
[2:09:21] and i don't know it just hit me like
[2:09:22] never before that
[2:09:24] same in this time if we don't have a
[2:09:25] revelation of what
[2:09:27] we're here for what god places for what
[2:09:29] we have the message the truth of the
[2:09:32] message
[2:09:32] and get a true revelation of it we could
[2:09:35] be deceived
[2:09:36] and even the prophet said it'll be so
[2:09:39] close that would deceive the very
[2:09:40] elected if possible
[2:09:42] and how many is grateful that it's not
[2:09:44] possible for us to be deceived in this
[2:09:46] time
[2:09:46] because we have a true revelation of the
[2:09:48] word so as the preaching is going forth
[2:09:50] every sunday every wednesday
[2:09:52] or if you listen to a tape or whatever
[2:09:55] it is just
[2:09:56] make sure you're getting a revelation of
[2:09:57] that word that's being preached and if
[2:09:59] you don't understand something
[2:10:00] ask brother shango because you want to
[2:10:02] be grounded in that that revelation of
[2:10:04] the word
[2:10:05] so you don't you're not deceived like
[2:10:07] eve
[2:10:10] and i just wanna thank you
[2:10:15] lord for
[2:10:19] letting me hear
[2:10:22] your word
[2:10:25] what have i done to deserve
[2:10:31] such glory revealed in me
[2:10:39] thanks for that special night
[2:10:47] when i saw your glorious
[2:10:51] light came face to face
[2:10:56] with eternal life
