[39:52] yes I'm privileged to be to be close to
[39:55] him Paul was a wonderful man but if it
[39:59] wasn't for people like gameo he would
[40:01] not have learned some things that God
[40:03] wanted him to learn so when we have a
[40:06] wonderful men like him close by it's
[40:08] just a wonderful privilege amen so we
[40:12] could stand for uh uh for the next uh
[40:15] for the reading of the word if you have
[40:17] your Bibles let's open from the book of
[40:20] Philippians chapter
[40:22] two yes
[40:24] sir amen I'm going to start my time
[40:27] around right
[40:30] now
[40:32] am
[40:34] am you know me I preach the message of
[40:37] the
[40:39] hours but sometimes the spirit will
[40:41] carry
[40:45] you sometimes the the Spirit Carries
[40:50] you Philippians chapter 2 if you have it
[40:53] let let's start from verse three yes sir
[40:56] let nothing be done through Strife or
[40:59] vain Glory that's right you know there
[41:02] is Glory that is vain that's exactly
[41:05] like a lot of Glory that we see today
[41:08] you know with the internet with it's
[41:10] it's it's glory but it's vain that's
[41:13] exactly you want you want the real
[41:16] glory that is the glorification of our
[41:21] bodies that comes through the word amen
[41:24] amen but in loneliness of mind let each
[41:29] esteem other better than
[41:34] themselves if you are talking to brother
[41:36] Steven he will make you feel like you're
[41:37] the greatest depress cuz he probably
[41:40] know he read this scripture
[41:43] here like brother Bram used to call uh L
[41:47] Dr L he was not a doctor that was just
[41:50] brother brandham he will make you feel
[41:55] good look not every man to his own
[41:58] things verse four amen but every man
[42:01] also on the things of others amen verse
[42:04] 5 yes sir and I want you to pay
[42:06] particular attention yes brother let
[42:09] this man be in you which was also in
[42:11] Christ Jesus that's who being in the
[42:14] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[42:17] equal with
[42:18] God but made himself of no reputation
[42:22] that's and took upon him the form of a
[42:25] servant yes my brother and was made in
[42:27] the likeness of
[42:29] man in being
[42:31] found in in fashion as a man he humbled
[42:36] himself yes sir and became obedient unto
[42:39] death even the death of the Cross am
[42:43] wherefore God has highly exalted him and
[42:47] given him a name which is above every
[42:49] name yes sir that at the name of Jesus
[42:52] every Cancer will bow every sickness
[42:56] will bow every blood pressure will
[43:00] bow of the things in
[43:03] heaven and things in Earth and things
[43:07] under the Earth every demon power every
[43:12] principality every
[43:14] spirit amen you may have your
[43:17] seats
[43:19] hallelujah it's a teaching night
[43:23] tonight so I hope you don't pull too
[43:26] much
[43:28] supposed to be a little bit of teaching
[43:31] so we want to talk about the servant
[43:36] King condensation and Ascension yes my
[43:41] brother amen condensation and Ascension
[43:43] yes sir condensation and Redemption
[43:45] whichever where you want to put it it
[43:47] will it will be the same right so let's
[43:50] also go to Isaiah chapter 53 it's a very
[43:54] familiar
[43:55] chapter so that you know we lay the
[43:57] background here cuz we are talking about
[44:00] Jesus Christ tonight but when we talk
[44:02] about Jesus Christ he is not complete
[44:05] without you because men is part of the
[44:09] godhead right
[44:11] amen because you cannot talk about Jesus
[44:14] without talking about his church am
[44:17] because his church is part of him yes
[44:21] that's why the prophet says she is
[44:25] him amen Isaiah 3 the Bible says here
[44:31] sorry the Bible says yes
[44:34] sir
[44:38] surely he is let's yeah surely he has
[44:42] born our griefs and carried our sorrow
[44:44] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[44:46] of God and Afflicted and he was wounded
[44:50] for our transgression and he was bruised
[44:52] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[44:55] our peace was upon him and with his
[44:58] stripes we are healed amen amen amen am
[45:03] me verse one it says who has believed
[45:04] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[45:06] Lord
[45:07] revealed amen so if you read the
[45:10] scriptures if you read Isaiah and Psalms
[45:13] you know the Bible refers to Jesus
[45:15] Christ it uses different titles yes sir
[45:19] sometimes it says my servant in whom I'm
[45:21] well
[45:22] delighted amen but we know that he is a
[45:26] king
[45:28] that became a
[45:30] servant but we are the opposite we are
[45:34] the servants who are becoming
[45:36] Kings Hallelujah by realizing who we are
[45:41] that's it amen let's read habac chapter
[45:46] uh the third slide chapter 2 verse 13
[45:48] very sorry for opening a lot of
[45:50] scriptures but I should not apologize
[45:51] for
[45:52] that behold is not the Lord of host that
[45:55] the people shall labor in in in in the
[45:58] very fire and the people shall be weary
[46:01] themselves for very
[46:03] vanity for the Earth shall be filled
[46:06] with the knowledge of the Lord amen with
[46:09] the knowledge and the glory of the Lord
[46:11] as the waters that cover the
[46:15] sea the Revelation is not going to be a
[46:18] cup it's not going to be a trickle it's
[46:21] not going to be a Bor it will be so much
[46:24] knowledge and revelation
[46:27] as the waters that cover the
[46:30] sea
[46:31] Hallelujah if you go if you don't mind
[46:34] go to Ezekiel chapter 47 verse
[46:37] three the Bible says and when the man
[46:41] that had the line in his hand went forth
[46:45] Eastward he measured a th000
[46:48] cubit and he brought me through the
[46:51] waters and the waters were to the ankles
[46:55] that's right that's the first stage
[46:59] yes
[47:01] amen amen hallelujah and again he
[47:05] measured he measured a thousand and and
[47:07] the waters were to the knees that's
[47:10] right that's the that's the second stage
[47:13] right brother I'm not going to preach on
[47:15] this but I'm just laying a background
[47:16] here amen and again he measured a
[47:19] thousand and brought me through and the
[47:20] waters were to the loins yes sir
[47:24] amen the waters boys remember you have
[47:27] to know the context sometimes Waters
[47:29] represent multitudes and people that's
[47:31] right but sometimes Waters represent the
[47:33] Holy Ghost that's that's why the Lord
[47:36] said to the woman at the well if you
[47:38] knew the gift of God and who it is that
[47:42] is speaking to you that's right I would
[47:44] have given you these Waters that's right
[47:47] yes sir in afterwards verse five he mer
[47:50] thousand and it was a river that I could
[47:54] not pass Hal
[47:57] hallelujah hallelujah it shall be a
[48:00] river yes sir there's a song that we
[48:02] used to sing some time ago says it shall
[48:04] flow like a river it shall fall like the
[48:07] rain it shall rise as the Jew in the
[48:11] morning for the knowledge of the Lord
[48:14] shall cover the Earth in the day that
[48:17] the Lord shall pour out his spirit and
[48:19] this is the day that we are living in
[48:22] because the prophet opened the
[48:25] Bible and we have received the mind of
[48:28] God we have received the perfect
[48:31] interpretation of the Bible that's right
[48:34] through Divine
[48:38] Vindication
[48:39] hallelujah amen so Jesus
[48:43] Christ he was Sav here he was a
[48:47] servant so but he was a
[48:50] servant though he did not start as a
[48:54] servant because God remember in the
[48:57] beginning he was El Elohim he was the
[49:00] self-existing
[49:02] one and the the prophet uses the word
[49:05] self-existent which what Elohim means
[49:07] that's right because he had to be
[49:10] self-existent because there is nothing
[49:12] here that lives that is self-existing
[49:15] here on the earth there is no energy I I
[49:18] don't want to get into science cuz I
[49:20] don't want to confuse people there is
[49:23] nothing that is
[49:24] self-propelling in in in Infinity uh
[49:27] everything if you light a candle it will
[49:29] die out that's if you start a car the
[49:32] gas will run out that's right but
[49:34] there's only one thing that is
[49:37] self-existing
[49:39] self fueling into eternity and that's L
[49:44] Elohim
[49:46] Hallelujah and the scientists the
[49:48] reasons why they don't believe God
[49:51] because the science they believe you
[49:53] have to explain everything you have to
[49:55] explain the origin of everything and the
[49:59] central focus of science is everything
[50:01] has to be explained based on origin and
[50:05] the dimensions that we live that's the
[50:08] problem amen that's problem where did
[50:11] God come from who created God but if God
[50:16] was created then he would not be
[50:20] God because anything that is created
[50:23] cannot be equal it cannot be eternal
[50:28] so God could not be created because the
[50:31] moment he's created he ceases to be
[50:34] [Applause]
[50:41] Eternal so you cannot explain God at the
[50:45] level of
[50:46] science because science
[50:49] assumes that for something to exist it
[50:52] has to be
[50:54] created and it has to be be
[50:57] somewhere because you cannot have matter
[51:01] without space so if it was created where
[51:05] was it and you cannot have matter in
[51:08] space without
[51:10] time but Genesis says in the beginning
[51:14] God
[51:16] created in the beginning time God
[51:19] created the heavens and the Earth
[51:22] matter
[51:24] hallelujah praise be to God God created
[51:27] the Earth it was existing in his
[51:31] firmament so God had to exist outside of
[51:35] these things for him to be God so the
[51:39] prophet says in the beginning there was
[51:41] no space there was no molecule there was
[51:44] a great
[51:47] spirit and this great spirit was called
[51:50] L
[51:53] Elohim
[51:55] Hallelujah when people people try to
[51:57] draw it and say it was it was it was
[51:59] inside it was not inside
[52:04] anywhere because it cannot be inside
[52:07] anything because there was nothing that
[52:10] could that he could go
[52:13] inside it was God
[52:16] himself the Fountain of Living
[52:20] [Music]
[52:22] Waters
[52:23] Hallelujah so God could not be
[52:27] created because he is in finite and
[52:30] because he's in finite he is
[52:34] eternal and being in finite means he has
[52:38] to know
[52:39] everything because you cannot know
[52:41] everything unless you are
[52:44] infinite Hallelujah so being infinite it
[52:48] makes him
[52:50] omniscient which means all
[52:54] knowing and because he is own knowing it
[52:58] means he knows what is happening any
[53:01] time everywhere every corner because
[53:03] he's all
[53:05] omnicient so if he knows everything that
[53:09] is happening everywhere that makes him
[53:13] omnipotent that makes him
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:20] omnipresent and the prophet says it does
[53:22] not mean that God is everywhere it
[53:25] simply means that he knows what is
[53:27] happening everywhere because God is not
[53:29] in a beer
[53:31] somewhere he just knows what is
[53:33] happening
[53:34] there and because he is all knowing that
[53:38] makes him all powerful which is
[53:44] omnipotent which means before you pray
[53:46] God knows about it before you kneel down
[53:49] to pray God knows about it before you
[53:52] went into a problem God knew about it
[53:55] before you asked God he knows about
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:03] it but for God to create things he had
[54:06] to change his
[54:09] form because you cannot be a father and
[54:13] remain a
[54:14] bachelor for you to be a to to be a
[54:18] father for you to be a father you have
[54:20] to give up being a bachelor you cannot
[54:23] be a father and a bachelor at the same
[54:26] time
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:34] the moment you you become a father you
[54:38] cease to be a
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:41] bachelor and the son that you bring
[54:44] forth your child will never see your
[54:47] Bachelor
[54:49] [Applause]
[54:50] days that's why the Bible says no man
[54:54] has seen the father
[54:59] no man has seen the father because you
[55:02] cannot see your father as a
[55:05] bachelor the moment you see him he
[55:09] automatically becomes a
[55:12] father so when God
[55:15] created he automatically had to change
[55:18] his form to become the
[55:21] [Applause]
[55:24] logos so each time God manifest himself
[55:28] in whatever form you see that is called
[55:32] Jesus because the only begotten of the
[55:35] father has declared
[55:37] him
[55:39] hallelujah praise be to God praise be to
[55:50] God slide number
[55:54] eight Hallelujah
[55:57] the Bible says here let this mind be in
[56:01] you thanes which was also in Christ
[56:05] Jesus who being in the
[56:08] form now the Greek word form is in
[56:14] mou who being in the form of God which
[56:17] means enor the because the word Theo
[56:20] means god theology theocracy theophilos
[56:26] that's Theo is Greek for God in Hebrew
[56:29] we
[56:30] have el
[56:33] el Elohim so L is is is Hebrew for for
[56:39] for for Theo in
[56:41] Greek so the Bible says who was in the
[56:45] in the mhe of Theo in the form of
[56:48] God he thought it not robbery to be
[56:51] equal with God but made himself of no
[56:54] reputation
[56:56] and he took him the a morare of a
[57:00] servant
[57:03] that's so when brother Braham says it
[57:06] was God and mor that's that's what he's
[57:08] talking about here it was God changing
[57:12] his
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:14] form
[57:17] Hallelujah and the Bible says he took
[57:20] him upon the form of a servant and he
[57:23] was made in the likeness of a man
[57:26] and being found as a as a being found in
[57:30] fashion as a man he humbled himself now
[57:33] the word humble is cannot
[57:38] cease
[57:41] Hallelujah which means he empted
[57:45] himself and he became obedient to
[57:50] death the prophet says William Marion br
[58:02] hallelujah amen no we'll come back to
[58:05] that to the word kenosis because you see
[58:09] there are there's there are two
[58:11] principal themes in the Bible Hallelujah
[58:13] there is in Mor but God in Mor is
[58:16] through
[58:17] kenosis was kenosis it means that he's
[58:21] not taking something and putting in
[58:23] something different it means he's
[58:25] emptying his entire self into
[58:30] something it's God changing his form so
[58:34] when God comes in the church he is not
[58:37] sprinkling
[58:39] something it's
[58:41] kosis in the
[58:44] [Applause]
[58:49] church
[58:51] Hallelujah so so Jesus he changed to you
[58:56] become a man which is
[59:00] kenosis amen it's a Greek word
[59:04] hallelujah but there's a word that we
[59:06] don't use Hallelujah because it's not in
[59:08] the
[59:10] western it's not in the
[59:13] western understanding of the Bible amen
[59:17] the word is called
[59:18] theosis
[59:20] yes yes sir I'm going to delete it
[59:23] because I don't
[59:26] kosis is God coming down to become man
[59:30] but theosis is God does that so that man
[59:35] can be transformed and get the glory of
[59:39] [Applause]
[59:46] God
[59:48] [Applause]
[59:51] hallelujah because the prophet says God
[59:55] became men so that men can become
[1:00:02] God so he was a servant but he was a
[1:00:05] king so which one is which it's called
[1:00:09] kenosis my
[1:00:12] [Applause]
[1:00:13] friend because when John was weeping he
[1:00:17] was told fear not the lion of the tribe
[1:00:20] of Judah has prevailed and when he was
[1:00:24] turning to see the lion what did he saw
[1:00:27] he saw a
[1:00:28] lamp Hallelujah so the lion represents
[1:00:32] the
[1:00:33] King the lion represents the king
[1:00:37] brother that's what John saw as Jesus
[1:00:40] but for him to become a lion sir he has
[1:00:44] to pass through the lamp hallelujah
[1:00:47] hallelujah
[1:00:49] hallu because you cannot have the lion
[1:00:52] without the
[1:00:54] lamp so when we wear these bodies
[1:00:57] because we bypass our theophanies we are
[1:01:01] taking the form of a
[1:01:04] lamb but our true identity
[1:01:08] is
[1:01:11] Kings wo thank you
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:18] [Applause]
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:24] Jesus he has made us
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:34] what
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:38] amen Romans 12: 16 I'll come back amen
[1:01:44] the Bible says be of the same mind one
[1:01:46] towards another mind not high things but
[1:01:49] cond and send to Men of low State be not
[1:01:53] wise in your own conent so when we are
[1:01:56] walking in the earth we are walking in
[1:02:00] humility because that's how Redemption
[1:02:03] happens was brother BR made a favorite
[1:02:06] song and it also happens to be my
[1:02:08] favorite
[1:02:09] song and it doesn't have to be your
[1:02:12] favorite song it won't make you less
[1:02:13] spiritual if it's
[1:02:15] not our Lord was a carpenter but all
[1:02:19] disciples were not
[1:02:20] Carpenters so it's okay
[1:02:24] right we all don't have to be fisherman
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:27] hunting no no no be who you
[1:02:31] are Peter never said I write unto you
[1:02:33] Saints in Capia you should do a capentry
[1:02:36] classes
[1:02:38] no sir no sir he never say that there's
[1:02:43] no Cent mentioned in the
[1:02:46] bible no I mean after the
[1:02:51] gospels his favorite song he sometimes
[1:02:54] he says two says I like only believe
[1:02:56] like down down from his glory but many
[1:02:59] quotations you say my favorite song is
[1:03:02] down from his glory and whenever he
[1:03:05] would visit Martin Bose he would ask
[1:03:07] someone to sing that song says brother
[1:03:10] Bram is here let someone sing his
[1:03:12] favorite song and he says you hear that
[1:03:14] that's my favorite song Amen I didn't
[1:03:17] know that it was always my favorite song
[1:03:19] until I came up to that quotation and I
[1:03:22] like the verse because one one of the
[1:03:23] vers says is what cond
[1:03:26] ation bringing us
[1:03:29] Redemption because Redemption comes
[1:03:31] through
[1:03:35] condensation because Jesus Christ when
[1:03:39] he was going to the Cross he took his
[1:03:43] disciples and he says if one of you is
[1:03:45] to be great I'm going to show you how to
[1:03:48] do it
[1:03:50] that's because condensation brings
[1:03:54] Redemption
[1:03:56] yes sir you don't help people by go
[1:03:58] pulling them up you help people by going
[1:04:01] down to their
[1:04:04] level that's what Redemption is if you
[1:04:08] want to help your children if you want
[1:04:10] to help your wife you want to help your
[1:04:11] husband come down don't go up come
[1:04:15] [Applause]
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:17] [Applause]
[1:04:20] down don't say why is it you don't
[1:04:23] understand this why is it you don't no
[1:04:25] no no no say
[1:04:26] go down to his level go down to her
[1:04:29] level and say I understand what you're
[1:04:31] going through I understand because you
[1:04:33] when you do that you start to P you
[1:04:36] start to climb up because it's
[1:04:39] condensation that brings
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:46] Redemption that's why you could not
[1:04:48] distinguish Jesus from his
[1:04:51] disciples that's why they had to hire
[1:04:53] Judas to kiss him because did not know
[1:04:56] which one is
[1:04:59] Jesus someone had to identify him you
[1:05:03] could not distinguish him he was not
[1:05:06] putting on a Gucci suit he was not
[1:05:09] putting on a expensive pants he was just
[1:05:13] an ordinary man but in that ordinary man
[1:05:17] there was 100% the fullness of almighty
[1:05:21] God oh thank you Jesus
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:30] he was just a little bitty man but
[1:05:33] inside of him there was power that could
[1:05:36] create another world inside of him was
[1:05:39] enough power to destroy every
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:48] devil and Paul says uhhuh bring the
[1:05:52] clock that I left at throwers uhhuh and
[1:05:54] the parchment
[1:05:56] especially the parchments says make
[1:05:59] haste to come to me before
[1:06:04] winter you never said you know what I'm
[1:06:08] a messenger I've got power I'm going to
[1:06:11] speak jackets into
[1:06:19] existence he was a seven
[1:06:24] King you are King but you are living
[1:06:27] like a
[1:06:28] servant
[1:06:30] but the servant does not mean doing
[1:06:34] anything or being pushed
[1:06:38] [Applause]
[1:06:46] around being a servant King does not
[1:06:49] mean you just let demons come into your
[1:06:52] house or just let things happen I'm just
[1:06:56] humble you know no no no no no
[1:07:02] no it means you just wake up in the
[1:07:04] morning you do your chores you wash your
[1:07:06] dishes like anyone else but
[1:07:09] inside inside there is
[1:07:14] deity inside there is the power of
[1:07:18] almighty
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] God hallelujah
[1:07:27] Hallelujah amenallah the prophet says
[1:07:31] you know when someone says something
[1:07:33] evil about you and you want to take it
[1:07:36] up and get angry about
[1:07:38] it that shows you haven't went quite
[1:07:42] deep
[1:07:43] enough with
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] God big men don't do those
[1:07:53] things that's what made him God to me he
[1:07:57] was able to condense
[1:08:01] himself he was big he didn't have to
[1:08:04] notice their little scoffing he had a
[1:08:07] purpose he had a work to do and that was
[1:08:10] to fulfill what God had sent him to do
[1:08:13] and he was determined to do it he didn't
[1:08:16] care what anyone
[1:08:20] said amen oh this brother said this I
[1:08:24] don't care brother I'm an eagle I fly
[1:08:28] higher I'm an eagle I fly
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:37] higher so so we have got two
[1:08:39] extremes we have people who think if you
[1:08:42] become a king you're just going to do
[1:08:45] everything push everyone around sir that
[1:08:47] was not Jesus
[1:08:49] Christ he was quiet he was humble he was
[1:08:53] lonely and then we have another extreme
[1:08:57] who say brother just be humble brother
[1:08:58] we are servants and they don't know who
[1:09:01] they
[1:09:03] are you become Pious like the
[1:09:09] pope that's not
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:18] humility so God there is that incate
[1:09:23] balance
[1:09:25] because man was made to be
[1:09:29] God men was made to be God that's why
[1:09:32] the Bible teaches that's what the
[1:09:34] prophet teaches but the difference
[1:09:39] is it's God the small letter
[1:09:42] G which means we are one in him in
[1:09:45] substance but we are not the same in
[1:09:49] essence which means because people go
[1:09:53] also on this other extreme
[1:09:56] which is Lucifer which is Ezekiel
[1:09:58] chapter 28 Isaiah chapter you know I
[1:10:01] can't remember the chapter I shall be
[1:10:03] like the most high you can never be like
[1:10:06] the most
[1:10:07] high and then others go on this other
[1:10:11] extreme I am just a
[1:10:13] man but we have to look in the Bible and
[1:10:16] say how do we bring a balance
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:26] you are a God but not the god that
[1:10:30] receives
[1:10:32] [Applause]
[1:10:34] worship the reason why people re resist
[1:10:38] the teaching is because they think
[1:10:40] you're going to receive worship no
[1:10:42] that's an
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:51] error it's like a it's like a wife you
[1:10:54] call husband my Lord but the Lord is
[1:10:58] interpreted Master but you call God my
[1:11:01] Lord and the Lord is interpreted
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:08] Adon it's different
[1:11:12] friends that's why the prophet uses the
[1:11:15] word amateure
[1:11:17] God because he did not want to stumble
[1:11:20] the Pentecost
[1:11:21] [Applause]
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:33] hallelujah praise be to
[1:11:35] God and the prophet says here
[1:11:38] am brother sing down from his glory how
[1:11:43] many loves that song Let's see your hand
[1:11:45] just remember that's my favorite himym
[1:11:48] now we spoke about that now he says here
[1:11:50] now I may pronounce that word wrong but
[1:11:52] the reason I spell it is when if if it
[1:11:55] tape is released the people who the
[1:11:57] scholars you know when when when in Mor
[1:12:00] the prophet Sayes that's slide number 12
[1:12:03] says uh he changed himself he came down
[1:12:08] now the Greek word there means that
[1:12:10] something that could not be seen yes sir
[1:12:13] yet it's there then it's changed and the
[1:12:16] eye can catch
[1:12:19] it that's John 1 verse one that is is
[1:12:22] interpreting Philippians that we just
[1:12:24] read
[1:12:26] amen and he says now now when when when
[1:12:29] it said here that he emptied himself or
[1:12:32] ped out now we would think like this
[1:12:35] that he vomit up the English word or
[1:12:38] emptied or ped out from him see
[1:12:41] something went out of him that was
[1:12:42] different from him that's what we think
[1:12:45] but the word kosis in Greek does not
[1:12:47] mean that he vomit up or something his
[1:12:50] arms went off or his his eyes went out
[1:12:53] another person
[1:12:56] amen he changed himself he pulled
[1:13:00] himself into into another mask into
[1:13:04] another form not another person went out
[1:13:08] of
[1:13:13] him so brother Bram after the seies he
[1:13:16] begins to preach it begins to preach yes
[1:13:20] sir the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:23] Ghost and he tells people I'm going to I
[1:13:26] may not have time to get the CES but I'm
[1:13:27] just going to Glide over
[1:13:31] them he says there's only one form of
[1:13:34] eternal life that's exactly right and he
[1:13:36] says if you are Eternal you are you were
[1:13:40] always
[1:13:41] Eternal this is English this is not even
[1:13:45] complicated the word Eternal means
[1:13:47] something that is
[1:13:48] unending if something is an eternal it
[1:13:51] means it had no beginning it means it
[1:13:53] had no end that's so really you can say
[1:13:57] I received eternal life but that would
[1:13:59] not really make
[1:14:01] sense if you receive eternal life it
[1:14:05] means that life is no beginning and no
[1:14:07] end so if it is given to you it means
[1:14:11] somehow you had no beginning and you
[1:14:14] have no
[1:14:17] end which means you were existing with
[1:14:20] God and you are a part of God that's why
[1:14:23] the Bible says you are a
[1:14:26] [Applause]
[1:14:34] God
[1:14:38] hallelujah
[1:14:40] amen don't I know where people stumble
[1:14:44] say brother are you saying I'm like
[1:14:47] Jesus you are Jesus in a
[1:14:51] portion because Jesus was the fullness
[1:14:54] of God
[1:14:56] God but all of us as the bride we become
[1:15:00] the body of
[1:15:02] Christ so so all of us the the body we
[1:15:07] become the body of Christ so it's Christ
[1:15:09] working in a many M
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:19] body glory to God Amen am amen amen amen
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] amen the prophet says in slide number 18
[1:15:29] he says he come down to show what God
[1:15:31] was anything that's high and hurt is in
[1:15:34] God God is low and humble that's what
[1:15:37] made him God see something that comes
[1:15:40] low amen so what made him the Messiah
[1:15:43] was the ability to condens
[1:15:46] sent now the prophet says the difference
[1:15:49] between us now I'm going to clear the
[1:15:50] confusion right with people take your
[1:15:52] time amen one
[1:15:56] okay
[1:15:58] sorry if you're a young man you have to
[1:16:00] wrap it off because you're
[1:16:02] not so the prophet says one difference
[1:16:05] between us and Jesus yes sir is that we
[1:16:08] bypassed our theop yes sir that's one
[1:16:12] difference there we bypass our
[1:16:15] what there is the word again what
[1:16:18] Theo
[1:16:21] amen because Theo means god
[1:16:25] and funny means to reveal to appear so
[1:16:30] theop means it's God appearing
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:37] friends
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:42] Hallelujah so the witch of endo when she
[1:16:45] looked behind the curtain she said I see
[1:16:49] God but we did not come in that form we
[1:16:52] bypassed that
[1:16:57] [Applause]
[1:16:59] hallelujah it's not God to be worshiped
[1:17:02] remember
[1:17:07] this because you see teaching is working
[1:17:09] on thin eyes if you're not careful you
[1:17:12] know you go down so you have to it's a
[1:17:16] it's a delicate
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:23] balance amen am amen and veiling of God
[1:17:29] now remember between the Son of God in
[1:17:31] laia they put him out and look he said
[1:17:34] he would be reviewed again as a son of
[1:17:36] man amen the prophet fulfilling the rest
[1:17:39] of it am the scripture tie perfectly
[1:17:42] together son of man Son of God Son of
[1:17:44] David what was it is the same God all
[1:17:47] the time just changing his form and more
[1:17:51] fair yes brother he changed it yes it's
[1:17:55] a great drama to him amen he is acting
[1:17:58] it out amen now the word
[1:18:01] Redemption does not mean
[1:18:04] replacement it means you are buying
[1:18:06] something and bringing it back you are
[1:18:09] restoring so where is God restoring us
[1:18:13] to because remember Jesus came in Three
[1:18:16] Sons right he came in Son of Man uhhuh
[1:18:20] Son of God yes sir right and he came in
[1:18:23] Son of David yes my brother amen amen
[1:18:27] hallelujah so so so a son of men he was
[1:18:30] a prophet that's exact and and and a son
[1:18:32] of God he was a a priest that's exactly
[1:18:35] he was a priest exctly otherwise you
[1:18:37] would not have an atonement through the
[1:18:39] church
[1:18:40] ages and the son of David he comes as a
[1:18:43] king right that's why even us we operate
[1:18:47] the same anointings and the reason why
[1:18:50] Solomon had a jubilee is because he had
[1:18:53] these three anointings in
[1:18:56] harmony he had Nathan the prophet he had
[1:18:59] zadok the priest amen hallelujah so so
[1:19:04] but when you when one thing is missing
[1:19:06] it's a
[1:19:07] disaster in judges they did not have a
[1:19:10] prophet which is the son of man and it
[1:19:14] was a
[1:19:20] disaster one brother said my brother my
[1:19:23] a friend of mine from from IR land he
[1:19:25] said when brother Branham spoke to
[1:19:28] sister maida about the issue of the Tuma
[1:19:31] says you have disobeyed God didn't like
[1:19:33] that he was speaking as a son of man and
[1:19:37] he says everybody likes to do that to
[1:19:40] say you should not do this you should
[1:19:42] not do that that's a good anointing no
[1:19:45] this brother is wrong but the prophet
[1:19:48] here to climb down and say Lord forgive
[1:19:51] my wife she did not mean that was Now
[1:19:55] using the anointing of a
[1:20:02] priest so a house that operates by this
[1:20:06] one
[1:20:08] anointing it's a
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:14] disaster if you operate by this one
[1:20:17] alone it's a
[1:20:20] disaster because a king Hallelujah who
[1:20:25] did not become a
[1:20:26] lamb it's a
[1:20:30] dictator they were given a kingdom they
[1:20:33] received
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:42] crowns that's why
[1:20:44] David before David could become a king
[1:20:48] here to become a shepherd
[1:20:55] Hallelujah so whatever we are going
[1:20:57] through right now is preparing us for us
[1:21:01] to
[1:21:02] reain because we shall rain upon the
[1:21:05] Earth as we are reigning in
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:14] righteousness because adoption is based
[1:21:18] on
[1:21:19] conduct when go when Jacob blessed the
[1:21:23] tribes amen he says Reuben I'm not going
[1:21:26] to give you the birthright of the first
[1:21:29] born because of your conduct you thought
[1:21:33] I didn't know it I'm a prophet you went
[1:21:36] up and you took my
[1:21:38] wife you are unstable like water that's
[1:21:45] exactly and the blessing went to Joseph
[1:21:48] because God could not break his word
[1:21:51] hallelujah and he says Joseph is a
[1:21:53] fruitful B and his branches they liap
[1:21:56] over the
[1:22:00] wall
[1:22:01] hallelujah praise be to God so the
[1:22:04] prophet saying it's a great drama
[1:22:07] because Jesus is the only one that could
[1:22:10] qualify to be the king of kings because
[1:22:12] he is the only one that could condent
[1:22:15] from being a logos
[1:22:18] am our our our coming to the flesh is a
[1:22:22] tiny bitt fraction amen
[1:22:25] so in the great Millennium in the future
[1:22:29] home we re as kings but we lay our
[1:22:33] crowns before Jesus because he performed
[1:22:37] the greatest
[1:22:42] koses
[1:22:46] hallelujah
[1:22:50] amen we cry you now
[1:22:55] yes sir you Reign
[1:22:59] Victor
[1:23:00] Hallelujah high and lifted up worth is
[1:23:05] the lamp Jesus Son of
[1:23:11] God rer of
[1:23:14] Heaven
[1:23:19] crucified Worthy is the Lamb
[1:23:24] Hallelujah worth is the lamp this
[1:23:27] evening worth is the lamp in the
[1:23:32] highest because when you get to heaven
[1:23:36] you shall receive a crown and in that
[1:23:38] Crown there will be
[1:23:40] stones and these stones are the souls
[1:23:42] that you led to the
[1:23:44] Lord so all of us have a limit but there
[1:23:48] is only one that can claim all the all
[1:23:53] the stones and all the
[1:23:55] clowns his name is
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:04] Jesus so we are Gods but in part in a
[1:24:09] measure but unto
[1:24:12] him he was the fullness of the God he
[1:24:15] had
[1:24:17] [Applause]
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:21] B
[1:24:23] hallelujah praise be to
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:28] God you say but brother
[1:24:31] Aaron how then do we how is it that we
[1:24:35] become a portion take your time because
[1:24:39] remember when we say Jesus is the
[1:24:42] fullness yeah Jesus is the fullness
[1:24:46] Hallelujah now he had a body and this
[1:24:50] body was on the cross amen
[1:24:54] but we know that when he was on the
[1:24:57] cross when when Abraham met
[1:25:01] MEC Levi was in his Lo
[1:25:06] that's so when Jesus Christ was on the
[1:25:10] cross when he was in the beginning we
[1:25:13] were already in him so when he went on
[1:25:17] the cross we went on the cross with
[1:25:21] him so election looks to fall
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:27] knowledge
[1:25:28] so us as individuals cannot be the
[1:25:31] fullness because we make up the body of
[1:25:36] Christ so he alone is the fullness but
[1:25:40] we are a measure but when we put our
[1:25:42] measures together we form the body of
[1:25:46] Christ
[1:25:56] that's why Paul says according to the
[1:25:57] measure of Praise You know some are the
[1:26:00] eyes and you know we come through
[1:26:02] different ages come through W some came
[1:26:04] through Wesley some come through the the
[1:26:07] the the lips age but now we are in the
[1:26:10] age of intelligence artificial
[1:26:13] intelligence prophetic
[1:26:16] intelligence
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:21] hallelujah so he is the fullness of of
[1:26:24] God yes sir now remember Jesus Christ
[1:26:27] uhuh was called the second Adam yes sir
[1:26:30] because you have the first Adam that's
[1:26:32] right and you have the second Adam amen
[1:26:37] right so so Adam is the same as Jesus
[1:26:43] how many knows that cuz why would God
[1:26:45] say he the second Adam but but we don't
[1:26:49] but it does not mean we worship Adam
[1:26:51] this is this is where people the devil
[1:26:53] plays a trick in people's
[1:26:56] minds so we we say Adam was a type of
[1:27:01] Jesus but for him to be a type of Jesus
[1:27:05] he had to have a portion of
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:09] Jesus that's why and this portion is
[1:27:13] written in the book of
[1:27:15] life it's chapters in the
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:21] book some are in Malachi chapter 4
[1:27:24] somewh in Revelations
[1:27:26] 10 so it's portions of the
[1:27:30] book so our members were written in the
[1:27:33] Book of
[1:27:36] Life and the entire book is called the
[1:27:40] word of God and the word of God is
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:47] God so you are still part of that word
[1:27:50] but you are a portion of that word
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:28:00] So Adam could not be
[1:28:02] deceived because he was the son of God
[1:28:05] right and the prophet says that
[1:28:08] Adam Paul says in Timothy that Adam was
[1:28:11] not deceived but the woman being in the
[1:28:13] transgression was the one who was
[1:28:15] deceived because Adam was a perfect Son
[1:28:18] of God Amen because Adam was made in the
[1:28:21] image and likeness God Amen image and
[1:28:26] likeness right yes so Jesus Christ comes
[1:28:30] to to become the second Adam the reason
[1:28:34] why why is Jesus Christ doing
[1:28:37] this because he's restoring men to come
[1:28:41] back to this because Adam was the god of
[1:28:45] the
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:48] earth that's the Bible I'll read you the
[1:28:51] quotation that's the that's exactly the
[1:28:53] message
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:28:56] because if you read the message Christ
[1:28:58] is the mystery of God revealed the
[1:29:00] prophet says Christ is the three-fold
[1:29:03] purpose the the first one was to reveal
[1:29:07] himself so reveal himself number two was
[1:29:11] to have the preeminence
[1:29:14] right the third one was to restore the
[1:29:18] kingdom amen amen now to restore the
[1:29:21] what theom the kingdom
[1:29:25] Kingdom amen so what is a kingdom it's a
[1:29:29] compound word it means a
[1:29:31] king and in the domain
[1:29:35] right in the domain
[1:29:39] right take your time take your time
[1:29:43] that's why God had to redeem the Earth
[1:29:45] amen because it's part of our domain
[1:29:50] that's so so God came to reveal him
[1:29:54] himself in revealing himself in Christ
[1:29:57] he wanted to have the
[1:29:59] preeminence in the body that's why he
[1:30:02] said unless the the corn of
[1:30:05] wheat in the ground it abideth
[1:30:09] alone so what he was saying was that in
[1:30:12] him the seat was brother
[1:30:15] Steven Hallelujah in him was brother
[1:30:18] Aaron in him was all of these people but
[1:30:22] they were in the form that is called the
[1:30:24] jeene seed of
[1:30:25] God and the only way that they could
[1:30:28] come up was if they go in the
[1:30:31] ground because when the Greeks came to
[1:30:34] Jesus they said says we would see
[1:30:38] Jesus and Jesus answered them you want
[1:30:42] to see Jesus you want to see God you
[1:30:46] cannot see
[1:30:52] God I'm now in the the message says
[1:30:54] would see
[1:30:56] Jesus they wanted to see
[1:30:59] Jesus
[1:31:01] but but Jesus who is Jesus they wanted
[1:31:05] to see God in a way so Jesus answers
[1:31:08] them and says except a con of wheat
[1:31:11] falls to the ground it abideth alone
[1:31:15] what a strange
[1:31:17] answer go ahead brother so in other
[1:31:19] words he was telling them the only way
[1:31:23] because remember we
[1:31:24] say that kenosis or inor is something
[1:31:28] that cannot be seen But now is
[1:31:32] appearing so he is telling them for you
[1:31:34] to see Jesus I have to die on the cross
[1:31:39] and the Holy Ghost is given when the
[1:31:41] Holy Ghost is given you are going to see
[1:31:44] Jesus and when you see the church you
[1:31:47] see Jesus when you persecute the church
[1:31:50] you are persecuting Jesus
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:32:00] it's in the message says we would see
[1:32:04] Jesus so that is the only way they could
[1:32:06] see Jesus in the form that they
[1:32:11] wanted that's why even he himself in
[1:32:14] that form he could not give life because
[1:32:17] he was not yet glorified that's what the
[1:32:20] Bible says and and and the prophet says
[1:32:23] what
[1:32:24] it says the Greater Works was to impact
[1:32:26] eternal
[1:32:28] life and the prophet says God he has no
[1:32:31] Feit he has our feet God has no hands he
[1:32:35] has our
[1:32:39] hands amen so restoring the kingdom is
[1:32:43] is restoring what Adam lost that's
[1:32:46] exactly right which was the domain which
[1:32:51] was the being that he was like God
[1:32:55] am but that doesn't mean that he was
[1:32:58] worshiped but he was in the form of
[1:33:04] God now remember remember the prophet
[1:33:06] says now here he says they remember they
[1:33:09] control the Earth he was an amateure God
[1:33:12] that's right for he was the son of God
[1:33:14] and the Son of God is an amateure God
[1:33:16] now that ain't contrary to the scripture
[1:33:20] I know that sounds
[1:33:22] strange slide number 24 the prophet says
[1:33:25] I know it sounds strange amen notice he
[1:33:29] separated Eve and Adam and she fell Adam
[1:33:32] went with her Adam was not deceived Eve
[1:33:35] was deceived amen but Adam the first
[1:33:37] Adam was God's son also and he went out
[1:33:41] because of the love of
[1:33:42] Eve amen let's continue reading but you
[1:33:45] see the prophet says here now but you
[1:33:47] bypass the theophany and become flesh
[1:33:50] yes sir men to be tempted by sin amen
[1:33:54] and then he says now and if this a
[1:33:56] tabernacle is dissolved we have one
[1:33:59] already waiting we have not we we have
[1:34:02] not yet the bodies so in other words the
[1:34:04] prophet is saying if the reason why we
[1:34:07] bypassed our theophan was for us to be
[1:34:09] tempted that's exactly because if we
[1:34:11] would be in our theop then we would not
[1:34:13] be tempted because Adam could not sin
[1:34:16] because he knew who he was and he knew
[1:34:18] what was what he was doing but when
[1:34:20] Christ comes he's restoring us back amen
[1:34:24] that's what the message is about is to
[1:34:27] restoring us because
[1:34:31] remember when the lamp came forward yes
[1:34:34] sir to open the seals yes sir he was
[1:34:37] claiming what he
[1:34:39] redeemed because that was the only way
[1:34:41] that man could be restored
[1:34:45] back EXA and he says it is sown a
[1:34:48] natural body it is raised a spiritual
[1:34:51] body there's a natural body and there's
[1:34:54] a spiritual body and so is it as it was
[1:34:57] written the first Adam was made a living
[1:34:59] Soul the last Adam was made a quickening
[1:35:04] spirit now Romans chter 8 verse 29 give
[1:35:08] me 5 minutes 10 minutes for whom he did
[1:35:11] for for no he also did
[1:35:15] predestinate now what is election
[1:35:17] brother says election is not saying I
[1:35:19] choose this I don't choose this that is
[1:35:21] not election
[1:35:25] it's it's a bit hard to explain but for
[1:35:28] you to be a Jew you have to be born a
[1:35:32] Jew for you to be a Shambo you have to
[1:35:35] be born a
[1:35:36] Shambo now that doesn't mean that
[1:35:39] brother Shambo doesn't love me I just
[1:35:41] wasn't born a
[1:35:42] Shambo right I'm not his son because I
[1:35:45] was not born a Shambo but his son is a
[1:35:48] Shambo because he was born a Shambo and
[1:35:51] the only way he could be a Shambo is if
[1:35:53] he was born that way and the only way
[1:35:55] you could be a Jew is if you are born a
[1:35:59] Jew that's why you cannot join Judaism
[1:36:03] sir and if you read the book of Acts the
[1:36:06] Bible said there were people who were
[1:36:08] outside the temple who were God-fearing
[1:36:11] people this was a title which was given
[1:36:13] to Gentiles who wanted to become part of
[1:36:17] Judaism they were called God-fearing
[1:36:20] people they could not be called Jud uh
[1:36:23] Jews because you can only be a Jew by
[1:36:26] birth that's right and the only way you
[1:36:29] can be born is if you are on your
[1:36:32] father's
[1:36:34] loins so the only way we could be born
[1:36:37] again is if we are already in
[1:36:45] God having predestinated as Ephesians
[1:36:49] 1:5 unto the adoption of children by
[1:36:51] Jesus Christ to himself
[1:36:54] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:36:56] will to the praise of his of his grace
[1:37:00] wherein he made us accepted in the
[1:37:05] Beloved
[1:37:07] amen so so so the second difference is
[1:37:11] that there's only one who is beloved
[1:37:15] that's Jesus Christ there's only one who
[1:37:17] is begotten that's Jesus Christ but we
[1:37:22] where how where do we come in
[1:37:24] we are accepted in
[1:37:27] shame because remember let's
[1:37:32] read the prophet says Hebrews chapter 6
[1:37:36] to Abraham and his seed singular so
[1:37:40] Abraham is one seed God has one seed
[1:37:45] where the promises plural were made yes
[1:37:49] sir Abraham and his seed now the Seed of
[1:37:51] Abraham was one which was Christ in
[1:37:54] prefigure
[1:37:56] Isaac so there's only one seat in fact
[1:37:59] brother Braham says God does not even
[1:38:01] want to see you you'll kill
[1:38:08] you he only sees
[1:38:10] Christ he only sees
[1:38:13] Jesus and the only way we can be
[1:38:16] accepted is if we come in sight of Jesus
[1:38:20] which we are a part of Jesus
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:30] hallelujah oh my and the prophet says to
[1:38:35] find to finalize it I like this because
[1:38:36] I'm closing also to finalize it in
[1:38:40] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:38:43] singular which which with Jesus andc
[1:38:47] counted the seed children as the
[1:38:50] children of the promise amen and promise
[1:38:53] is having to do with election or
[1:38:56] choosing of God which we spoke about
[1:38:59] that and that is exactly what we have
[1:39:01] been saying these who are of the royal
[1:39:03] seed are the elect of God are the
[1:39:07] predestinated for n of God and we're in
[1:39:11] the mind of God and his
[1:39:14] thoughts go Amen in the in very plain
[1:39:17] language the true bride of of Jesus was
[1:39:20] in the mind of God eternally
[1:39:24] though not expressed until each came
[1:39:27] forth in the designated decreed
[1:39:32] season as each member came forth it
[1:39:35] became expressed because we said funny
[1:39:39] means is to
[1:39:40] express and mor amen and it took place
[1:39:44] in the body Hallelujah thus this bride
[1:39:49] is literally the spoken word seed
[1:39:54] bride and though she is fine this is
[1:39:58] where the balance is though is the
[1:40:00] though she is femine in in
[1:40:05] designation she is also called the body
[1:40:08] of Christ it is very apparent that she
[1:40:11] ought to be called that for she was
[1:40:14] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:40:19] Source was
[1:40:21] eternal with amen and now manifesting
[1:40:25] God in a many membered body whereas once
[1:40:29] God was manifested in one member one
[1:40:32] seat even our
[1:40:36] Lord amen now the prophet says now the
[1:40:39] only way you can be a son a daughter of
[1:40:41] God is because we have to have eternal
[1:40:43] life and there's only one form of
[1:40:45] eternal life that's God's life only one
[1:40:48] form of eternal life that was God there
[1:40:51] to be you have to be in him oh always
[1:40:54] the gene of your life spiritual life so
[1:40:58] you were always
[1:41:00] Eternal so that's why the Bible says you
[1:41:02] are Gods because you were you could not
[1:41:04] be otherwise doesn't not make sense how
[1:41:07] can you be
[1:41:09] Eternal
[1:41:11] amen you've got to be Sons and Daughters
[1:41:14] of God you've got to be born of God and

[1:52:47] God I was trying to see how you going to
[1:52:50] preach this message all
[1:52:53] I know you
[1:52:55] can because of the depth that goes with
[1:52:59] this is this the first time you preach
[1:53:02] this
[1:53:05] yeah honey what was I doing
[1:53:09] yesterday in the living room till 2:
[1:53:13] a.m. I was working on the
[1:53:15] sermon and if I pull my computer and I
[1:53:18] showed you you will be
[1:53:20] amazed this is the whole Holy
[1:53:23] Spirit this is the spirit of the
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:32] Lord do you see why God pushed the break
[1:53:35] sometime on
[1:53:36] Sunday amen so he bring a Ministry to
[1:53:40] get the
[1:53:44] Lord so we can sore forward Amen brother
[1:53:49] Bram say that God is not for you to
[1:53:51] forgive sin there we go I gave you the
[1:53:54] code here that belongs to
[1:53:58] Jesus sir it's
[1:54:03] unbelievable praise
[1:54:05] God Amen you are free free by
[1:54:11] understanding it's written there it's
[1:54:14] written there free by understanding it's
[1:54:16] a quote right there how many times I
[1:54:18] talk to people in the counseling and I
[1:54:20] don't even pray for them and they say I
[1:54:21] feel so good
[1:54:24] am because what we got used to is you
[1:54:26] you talk you talk and you sit and then
[1:54:28] you say now come down kneel down and
[1:54:30] then you start in Jesus precious name no
[1:54:32] you shall know the truth amen amen and
[1:54:36] the truth will set you
[1:54:38] free amen amen we can lay hand on you
[1:54:42] you get healed but if you don't
[1:54:45] understand what God is doing you can
[1:54:47] continue to be troubled by the devil and
[1:54:50] before you know it you would depend on a
[1:54:51] preacher
[1:54:53] to always be there to come and lay hand
[1:54:55] on you by the day you understand the key
[1:54:58] formula then it's a different story
[1:55:00] that's why brother BR made even a
[1:55:02] statement he said if Jesus was right
[1:55:04] here not if me if Jesus was right here
[1:55:08] brother Bram say if you see him he has
[1:55:10] nothing he can do for
[1:55:12] you because he already done
[1:55:17] it how can Jesus say blessed are those
[1:55:22] who believe
[1:55:28] without the disciple saw him but we are
[1:55:31] called blessed more than the disciple
[1:55:34] because now we are worshiping Christ not
[1:55:36] in
[1:55:38] flesh in the spirit in the
[1:55:42] Revelation amen what a masterpiece
[1:55:45] brother Aon you need to come back for
[1:55:47] part
[1:55:51] two I don't know for you to me it was
[1:55:54] like he start preaching he had to lay
[1:55:57] the foundation then he start preaching
[1:56:00] so I don't think you even preach tonight
[1:56:03] you just
[1:56:04] started amen amen it brings such a
[1:56:08] Clarity in the message and then the
[1:56:10] message now become comestible easily it
[1:56:14] looks like they took the bone and they
[1:56:15] crush it and now you can just uh eat the
[1:56:18] bones and everything and we can move
[1:56:20] forward brother God richly bless you I'm
[1:56:24] not going to add anything you just take
[1:56:26] what do me a favor because these things
[1:56:29] are
[1:56:30] deep even if you in church they deep
[1:56:34] whenever we preach on Sunday go back
[1:56:36] throughout the week and sit down maybe
[1:56:39] on a Monday or or or Thursday and and
[1:56:42] listen again and you will see more if
[1:56:44] you take this sermon you go back again
[1:56:46] and you begin to go one by one you will
[1:56:48] be even amazed things that were there
[1:56:52] and you could not even see the problem
[1:56:54] is not you could not even see it you
[1:56:55] were already
[1:56:57] filled then after a while the spirit
[1:56:59] opened up again so you can receive more
[1:57:02] so don't get the habit of listening to
[1:57:03] the sermon and go and then you don't
[1:57:05] hear the sermon again no God will unold
[1:57:08] especially these type of things it will
[1:57:10] help you a lot it went through our
[1:57:13] families and through everything the man
[1:57:15] the the the the the what God and David
[1:57:18] and everything it's like a package
