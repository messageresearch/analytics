[30:06] you got one amen come on up
[30:22] please pray for me i haven't sung in a
[30:23] while and i'm very nervous
[30:27] i want to give a little testimony before
[30:30] i sing
[30:32] um i got to a point a few months ago
[30:36] and in the last couple months well the
[30:38] last year and a half where
[30:41] i was questioning the message very
[30:42] heavily you know and it was
[30:44] it kind of you know kind of
[30:49] went back because of the church split
[30:51] and you know i wanted to
[30:53] be able to be in the position where i
[30:54] chose the message for myself
[30:56] instead of you know following everybody
[30:58] else because everybody else left and
[31:01] you know i came to the point where i'm i
[31:03] felt old enough to where i needed to
[31:04] make that decision on my own
[31:07] and um it caused some arguments with my
[31:09] parents and i
[31:11] for a few months because i decided to
[31:12] stay for me for a few months to um
[31:15] to really make that decision on my own
[31:17] and see for myself this is what i
[31:18] believe
[31:19] and i'm not leaving because everybody
[31:20] else is i'm leaving because i know
[31:23] this is this is wrong this is what i
[31:24] believe and i'm going to do that because
[31:26] i know it's right
[31:28] so um you know it didn't it did progress
[31:30] to the point where i i felt
[31:32] that confirmation and i needed to leave
[31:35] and so
[31:36] that didn't take away the doubt though
[31:38] you know for some reason i just i had
[31:40] that doubt in my heart
[31:42] for a few months and um i don't know
[31:45] what it is
[31:46] but maybe it's the preaching here but
[31:47] the last few months i've gotten that
[31:58] confirmation and um
[32:00] i had an experience yesterday that my
[32:03] dad and i were joking about it but it
[32:05] really took me off guard
[32:06] um i took piano lessons for a couple for
[32:09] about five or six years from a
[32:10] pentecostal pastor's wife
[32:12] and she and i became very good friends
[32:14] you know i i prayed for i put up prayer
[32:16] requests
[32:17] for her in church for a few months
[32:20] because she had gone through breast
[32:21] cancer and
[32:22] you know she's completely healed from
[32:23] that now but but um
[32:26] she and i stayed in touch i would go to
[32:27] her house sometimes and catch up and get
[32:29] coffee every once in a while and she was
[32:30] always very very sweet to me very kind i
[32:34] do have a very close relationship with
[32:35] her but yesterday
[32:37] i went to her house for breakfast and to
[32:39] catch up
[32:40] and her mother was there who's also a
[32:42] pentecostal pastor's wife for the last
[32:44] 40 years
[32:45] and um they were you know i was telling
[32:47] them about how i had doubt about what i
[32:49] i believed for a while but now i've
[32:51] never seeked god more in my entire life
[32:53] than i do now
[32:55] and you know i was just i was giving her
[32:56] that testimony
[32:58] and you know i've explained to her about
[32:59] about what we believe about the message
[33:01] and you know with panic with pentecostal
[33:03] doctrines they believe a little
[33:04] differently with speaking in tongues as
[33:06] we do
[33:06] and i i explain that to her you know i
[33:08] believe we speak in tongues and there
[33:10] has to be a certain order about it but
[33:11] it is
[33:12] a beautiful gift that god is god will
[33:14] give you in the moment
[33:15] if it's in the correct order but um we
[33:18] would have discussions about that
[33:20] and that came up yesterday and i told
[33:23] her i said i've never experienced that
[33:24] myself got you know i have gifts in
[33:26] other in other ways i have
[33:27] you know gifts and music but i said god
[33:28] has never given me that gift you know
[33:30] and
[33:30] i pray one day he may but you know if
[33:32] it's not his will then he won't
[33:34] i've experienced i've seen other people
[33:36] have it and i think it's a beautiful
[33:37] thing but
[33:38] you know so she she started talking
[33:41] about that
[33:41] and she was saying well you know that
[33:44] means you don't have the holy ghost if
[33:46] you've never experienced it for yourself
[33:47] and i said well i don't quite believe
[33:49] that i don't believe that everybody
[33:50] every christian has to experience it
[33:52] for evidence of the holy ghost but i
[33:54] believe it's it's a gift
[33:57] and so it it it progressed the situation
[34:00] progressed to the point where
[34:01] she and her mother were hovering over me
[34:03] had their hands over me praying for me
[34:05] and almost trying to force me to speak
[34:08] in tongues
[34:09] to get the holy ghost and i felt so
[34:11] uncomfortable
[34:15] it was very you know i felt i felt so
[34:17] uncomfortable in my spirit and it
[34:19] drained me by the time i left you know
[34:21] and when they were praying over me i
[34:23] think they got disappointed because i
[34:25] didn't
[34:28] and i felt i felt bad about myself you
[34:30] know i'm thinking
[34:31] oh my gosh if this is how it is in their
[34:33] church you know
[34:34] people must feel bad about themselves if
[34:36] they don't speak in tongues
[34:38] if they don't get that gift like i can't
[34:40] even imagine
[34:41] because i've always felt like i got the
[34:43] holy ghost when i was 14
[34:45] at a at a believer's youth camp and you
[34:47] know i definitely can say i've needed
[34:49] the
[34:50] the um refreshing of it the refilling of
[34:52] it and i believe i've been getting that
[34:54] but
[34:54] sorry i feel like i'm about to i'm on
[34:56] the verge of crying this whole time but
[34:58] but that really like confirmed to me
[35:00] that i don't belong anywhere else i
[35:02] don't belong in any other
[35:04] denomination any other church if if just
[35:07] that one experience with that
[35:09] just made me it really made me feel
[35:11] uncomfortable in my heart
[35:12] and i think that was the confirmation
[35:14] one of the confirmations i needed that
[35:15] i'm right
[35:16] right god has me right where i belong so
[35:26] so um i've sang this song plenty of
[35:28] times and i pl
[35:29] please join me if you know it i'm just
[35:31] gonna sing a little bit of it not the
[35:32] whole thing but
[35:33] i hope it's a blessing to you and i hope
[35:34] if anyone here has doubt
[35:36] about whether or not you should be here
[35:38] um maybe this song will be a blessing or
[35:40] maybe you can come talk to me and we can
[35:42] we can talk about it together and you
[35:44] know maybe we can help each other out
[35:46] so please sing this with me if you know
[35:48] it
[35:54] truth is i'm tired
[35:59] options are few
[36:04] i'm trying to pray
[36:09] but where are you
[36:14] i'm all churched out
[36:19] hurt and abused
[36:25] i can't fake what's
[36:28] left to do
[36:32] truth is i'm weak
[36:37] no strength to fight
[36:42] no tears to cry
[36:44] [Music]
[36:46] even if i try
[36:51] but still my soul
[36:55] refuses to try
[37:02] but one touch will
[37:05] change my
[37:10] [Music]
[37:20] is
[37:23] this is my offering
[37:28] lay me at the throne
[37:33] leave me there all alone
[37:37] to gaze upon your glory
[37:40] [Music]
[37:42] sing to you this song
[37:51] truth is it's time
[37:55] to stop playing these games
[37:59] we need

[38:08] so lord speak right now

[45:11] that point
[45:12] that was it i was talking to somebody
[45:16] last night he was going through
[45:17] something and he asked me he said
[45:20] pastor thank you very much musician he

[45:24] as a pastor as a brother what can you
[45:26] advise me
[45:28] i say brother if you take a decision
[45:31] not just a decision but if that decision
[45:34] is coming from
[45:35] your heart if it's a sincere
[45:39] decision coming from your heart
[45:42] even hell knows it
[45:45] amen you can take many decisions that's
[45:48] why you see people coming to the altar
[45:50] repent and go back and nothing happened
[45:52] repent and go back and nothing happened
[45:54] but if you take a decision and that
[45:58] decision
[45:58] comes from your heart amen
[46:01] and you really mean it i told him i said
[46:05] brother what he does
[46:06] it create an atmosphere around you
[46:10] that's the atmosphere brother brother
[46:11] i'm saying you get closer to somebody
[46:13] and you can sense whether they like you
[46:16] or they don't like you you don't have to
[46:18] say anything
[46:19] you know what let's sit a little bit you
[46:22] don't have to say anything
[46:24] amen i said brother branham say even a
[46:27] dog
[46:28] will recognize if you love him or not
[46:33] amen how can a dog speak a human
[46:36] language
[46:37] dog do not speak human language
[46:40] but there is a language that even
[46:43] animals
[46:44] understand that language have to come
[46:47] from your heart
[46:49] amen i said brother if you want to be
[46:51] out of trouble
[46:53] take a decision in your heart
[46:56] from the bottom of your heart you say i
[46:58] don't want to be in trouble
[47:00] if that decision is genuine
[47:04] hell will wake up
[47:06] [Laughter]
[47:08] amen you won't have to force anything
[47:11] everything will begin to run smooth
[47:14] without any problems
[47:15] amen i told him i said one time there
[47:18] was a woman that came to brother branham
[47:21] and the woman was suffering of something
[47:23] and she came to brother branham and she
[47:25] explained brother branham her
[47:27] situation and brother branham say okay
[47:29] you go ahead and kneel
[47:31] and i want you to pray about it and the
[47:33] woman knelt down and begin to pray begin
[47:36] to pray begin to pray begin to pray
[47:38] and she finished she rose up she said
[47:40] brother branham everything is okay it's
[47:41] finished
[47:43] brother branham say it is not okay yet
[47:47] that's the kind of prayer we usually do
[47:50] you want to pray for somebody in jesus
[47:52] name go out thank you jesus i'm healed
[47:55] thank you lord i'm here but you he
[47:56] didn't get there
[47:58] brother branham told the woman go back
[48:00] again and
[48:01] start praying over the woman went back
[48:05] again and begin to pray and begin to
[48:07] pray begin to pray
[48:08] brother branham says suddenly she
[48:11] touched something and when she touched
[48:14] that thing
[48:15] the woman began to cry nobody told her
[48:19] how to cry
[48:20] nobody will teach you how to start
[48:23] sobbing
[48:24] it's not going to be you anymore it's
[48:27] going to be
[48:28] somebody else that is taking over
[48:31] when that woman reached that prayer
[48:34] she rose up brother branham said now
[48:37] [Laughter]
[48:41] amen brother adam said now it is
[48:44] over and it was over amen
[48:48] that's why sometimes that channel take a
[48:51] quick turn and you get it
[48:53] sometimes you might have to linger in
[48:55] prayer
[48:56] a little bit but if you got used to a
[48:59] prayer where you just sit
[49:00] lord i pray for my son i believe he's
[49:02] good he's good good and you raise up and
[49:04] you go
[49:04] that's why you don't see a lot of stuff
[49:07] happening
[49:08] amen but let the heart connect
[49:11] to the maker amen nobody will say
[49:15] nothing if you rose from that prayer
[49:18] the first sign you're gonna see the
[49:20] worry
[49:21] about what you were praying for will be
[49:24] taken off
[49:26] it looks like whatever burden you have
[49:28] like somebody
[49:30] lifted up and no matter how many
[49:34] symptoms
[49:34] the devil will pull in your face it will
[49:37] do you
[49:38] nothing and when that prayer happens
[49:41] the devil in hell will wake up and say
[49:45] something is happening somewhere amen
[49:48] amen so when a child of god get a
[49:51] personal
[49:52] revelation of this message
[49:58] amen even if the whole church backslid
[50:02] even if the pastor backslid
[50:05] you gonna stay right there
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:11] if it's going to be one person going to
[50:13] the rapture it's going to be you
[50:17] amen whether your husband like you or
[50:20] not
[50:20] he don't matter anymore whether the
[50:23] whole church is for you or not
[50:25] he don't matter anymore because you
[50:27] reach a point
[50:29] where nobody can put you there except
[50:32] class you remember the tenth vision
[50:36] you remember the tense vision when you
[50:38] entered there
[50:39] when you come out if they ask you a
[50:42] question you don't know how to explain
[50:44] it
[50:45] the only way you can explain somebody is
[50:48] you gotta go back yourself
[50:50] and you enter there when you come out
[50:53] we can talk a different language but we
[50:56] can explain you won't explain me
[50:58] i won't explain you but when we look at
[51:00] one another we understand we know the
[51:02] same thing
[51:05] hallelujah have you seen two marriage
[51:08] people
[51:09] they can look at one another in their
[51:11] eyes and they know what they're talking
[51:13] about amen
[51:17] you can sit there and watch the eyes and
[51:20] watch their eyes and you don't get
[51:21] nothing
[51:22] but when the wife is looking at the
[51:24] husband
[51:26] she can even write you a book
[51:31] [Applause]
[51:32] amen she can even tell you my husband is
[51:35] saying this
[51:36] this this this this and you go back
[51:39] exactly the truth
[51:40] it is a different language

[54:04] bear with us because we're still working
[54:07] on it we
[54:08] putting people in contact where we need
[54:10] to start
[54:11] uploading the stuff on the website and
[54:14] the streaming and everything so you can
[54:15] go straight
[54:16] and see it amen have you noticed a
[54:19] mystery on your website
[54:22] i send it to the deacon and the trustee
[54:24] nobody's talking about it
[54:26] what was the first picture on the
[54:28] website from the left
[54:30] who was on the first picture
[54:33] broad able who was in the middle
[54:38] brother stephen who was the end
[54:43] and didn't put it it was not me who put
[54:47] it
[54:48] somebody did it amen
[54:53] what is the first person that starts
[54:54] worship god
[54:56] in the bible
[54:59] [Applause]
[55:00] [Music]
[55:04] oh somebody's catching it
[55:07] what was the first person that received
[55:10] a revelation of the lamb in the bible
[55:14] who was the first person
[55:17] amen and who was the first mother that
[55:20] was strained
[55:21] in the old testament no in the old
[55:25] testament
[55:31] because paul spoke about the blood of
[55:33] abel
[55:34] amen which was speaking loudly right
[55:38] and that blood was speaking about the
[55:40] old covenant
[55:42] which is the old testament
[55:45] everybody clear then in the new
[55:48] testament jesus christ came
[55:50] as the lamb of god and he produced the
[55:54] true lamb
[55:55] that evil prefigure amen
[55:59] the lamb of the lamb that elbow was
[56:01] killing was prefiguring
[56:03] jesus christ so when jesus was dying at
[56:06] the cross
[56:08] and jesus said father do whatever
[56:11] forgive them because they don't know
[56:13] what they want
[56:14] and when stephen came and they begin to
[56:16] kill
[56:17] stephen the first human being that
[56:20] expressed their
[56:21] true atonement in the new testament
[56:25] was who
[56:30] i didn't put that
[56:33] everybody clear so the old testament is
[56:37] there
[56:37] and the new testament is there but there
[56:40] was a revelation that jesus
[56:42] did not have when jesus was here on
[56:46] earth
[56:48] when jesus resurrected then the father
[56:52] unfolded that revelation
[56:55] and jesus took that revelation and
[56:58] went to who in the book of water
[57:08] ever clear in the book of water
[57:12] this is the old atonement
[57:16] this is the new atonement
[57:20] but the book of revelation finished the
[57:23] entire
[57:24] plan of redemption
[57:30] are you there this one was slain
[57:34] and have to wait for the lamb under
[57:38] paradise
[57:41] because all the old testament sent they
[57:43] died
[57:45] and this one was slain
[57:48] about here and he's waiting for the
[57:50] rapture
[57:52] but this one they tried to kill him
[57:56] but they could not kill him and jesus
[57:59] even gave him a promise
[58:01] that some of you won't die until they
[58:04] see the water
[58:06] he takes that's why brother branham said
[58:09] when the rapture will come
[58:12] the old testament sand will be in the
[58:14] front
[58:15] then the new testament sent a following
[58:19] and it's gone by the ministry of john
[58:21] the revelator
[58:24] so your whole three pictures have your
[58:27] entire bible written right there
[58:35] hallelujah you know i was talking to
[58:38] somebody
[58:39] when i spoke about the heart i said
[58:41] their heart was on the east side
[58:43] right and when i told brother chad we
[58:46] were talking to him
[58:47] and he took a piece of paper he said
[58:49] brother stephen look at this
[58:51] look at this
[58:55] in the human being brother branham said
[58:58] in the heart
[59:00] is everybody okay i'm gonna take off
[59:03] sooner i'm just preparing at the airport
[59:06] amen brother when i'm saying in the
[59:08] middle of the heart
[59:09] there is a compartment where there is no
[59:12] cells
[59:14] nor even blood there that is the
[59:16] occupancy of water
[59:18] of the soul how many chambers do we have
[59:21] in the heart
[59:23] thank you my sister will already say
[59:25] that how many chambers do we have
[59:28] four chambers
[59:32] how many ribs do we have
[59:39] 24 water everybody clear
[59:42] so in the middle of the heart there is a
[59:46] soul
[59:47] which is the throne of god america
[59:51] which is the throne of god on the east
[59:53] side
[59:54] of your body on the east yes ever here
[59:57] this is the north this is the south this
[59:59] is the west this is the east side
[1:00:02] amen but if you go on in heaven
[1:00:05] where god sits on the tron around god
[1:00:09] throne there is four beasts
[1:00:14] yes sir that's why the heart have four
[1:00:17] chambers
[1:00:19] everybody clear and before god there is
[1:00:22] how many elders
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:25] how many weeps do you have that's why
[1:00:28] paul said your body is the temple of
[1:00:32] the water
[1:00:40] everybody clear when adam was put to
[1:00:43] sleep how many ribs did he pull
[1:00:46] worn and made water when the book of
[1:00:49] redemption in the book of revelation
[1:00:53] ever here there was one rib that was
[1:00:55] taken off here one rib
[1:00:57] amen and that rib was a woman
[1:01:00] ever clear but in the book of redemption
[1:01:04] when there was a call to the kingsmen
[1:01:07] redeemer
[1:01:08] amen the whole creation was already
[1:01:11] completely lost and john was crying
[1:01:15] because no one was found worthy to do
[1:01:17] what
[1:01:18] to take the book and to break the sales
[1:01:21] how many elders
[1:01:22] move
[1:01:29] how many others moved one ad has moved
[1:01:34] one who was that elder
[1:01:37] and john is the type of water

[1:05:26] on the teenager and and
[1:05:30] entering the teenager he brought us to
[1:05:32] all these avenues
[1:05:34] of makeup and high heel and and
[1:05:37] hair and all this kind of stuff because
[1:05:39] those are the stuff
[1:05:40] people bother when you reach that age
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:44] so that's why the youth a young man
[1:05:47] void of understanding you might be
[1:05:49] sitting
[1:05:50] passing through the street near her
[1:05:52] corner
[1:05:54] and he went to her way to the way to her
[1:05:56] house we already know this is
[1:05:58] approximated
[1:06:00] verse nine in the twilight in the
[1:06:02] evening in the black and dark night
[1:06:05] and behold there made him a water
[1:06:09] a woman met this man we know that woman
[1:06:12] we already demonstrated to you but i
[1:06:15] just want you to keep
[1:06:17] it's a woman amen that woman
[1:06:21] with an attire of water
[1:06:25] so when you look at the woman at the
[1:06:28] first
[1:06:29] the way she dressed the way
[1:06:32] she presented herself there is no
[1:06:36] question about it
[1:06:38] you don't have to think twice when you
[1:06:40] look at that woman
[1:06:41] automatically the information that the
[1:06:44] woman is giving you
[1:06:46] is she's a street woman
[1:06:50] you don't have to even think twice you
[1:06:52] don't need any diagnosis or anything
[1:06:55] the woman is dressed
[1:06:59] like a water like a harlot like a
[1:07:02] prostitute
[1:07:03] this is her outer apparel
[1:07:08] her clothing and everything else that
[1:07:10] she put on
[1:07:12] anybody clear because remember paul and
[1:07:14] peter explained to us the prostitute of
[1:07:16] their time
[1:07:17] how do they look karma and a water
[1:07:23] and a scepter of heart remember the word
[1:07:26] saddle when it was used the first time
[1:07:29] it was used in genesis and that word
[1:07:32] shadow we already explained to you in
[1:07:34] other words this woman
[1:07:36] had the heart of the devil
[1:07:41] anybody clear the heart of this woman
[1:07:45] was the heart of the serpent
[1:07:48] and the old serpent we know is the devil
[1:07:52] lucifer everybody clear so right here
[1:07:56] what i'm trying to point out is the
[1:08:00] condition
[1:08:01] of the heart amen
[1:08:05] was expressed on the outside
[1:08:08] by the clothing
[1:08:13] everybody clear there is no way
[1:08:16] her clothing could be a clothing of a
[1:08:18] prostitute
[1:08:20] but the heart is a christian it doesn't
[1:08:24] work
[1:08:24] anybody clear the bible is telling you
[1:08:28] that
[1:08:28] her apparel her clothing the way she
[1:08:32] presented herself
[1:08:33] she presented herself as a prostituted
[1:08:36] camera
[1:08:37] and the reason why she present herself
[1:08:40] as a prostitute
[1:08:41] is because the heart that she has
[1:08:45] is the heart of the serpent
[1:08:48] in other words she received the teaching
[1:08:51] of a serpent because it is the teaching
[1:08:55] of the serpent that causes
[1:08:58] a man to fall for a woman it
[1:09:02] is the teaching of the serpent that
[1:09:05] causes seduction
[1:09:07] ever clear so she received the teaching
[1:09:10] just like
[1:09:11] eve received the teaching and she used
[1:09:15] that teaching as a voice unto adam
[1:09:19] and adam fell just like
[1:09:22] sarah had the teaching and the teaching
[1:09:26] of sarah put
[1:09:27] abraham in trouble so this woman
[1:09:30] received a teaching in her heart
[1:09:33] and that teaching came from the serpent
[1:09:36] from the devil
[1:09:37] because it's the same heart as the heart
[1:09:40] that was in genesis 3.
[1:09:41] and thy heart now is expressed on the
[1:09:44] outside
[1:09:46] as an appearer of a prostitution
[1:09:49] the outside was only a manifestation
[1:09:53] of the inside
[1:09:57] we okay praise god
[1:10:01] jump to verse 15
[1:10:04] therefore this is the woman speaking can
[1:10:07] i
[1:10:07] forfeit to meet you diligently
[1:10:10] to seek your face
[1:10:13] go back to verse 13. so she
[1:10:17] caught him and did water
[1:10:21] did the man start all the woman so there
[1:10:24] is no restraint in this woman
[1:10:26] she doesn't wait for you to start she is
[1:10:29] the one
[1:10:30] teaching it is if that gave me the fruit
[1:10:35] make sense it was not adam getting the
[1:10:38] fruit it was eve
[1:10:39] that started because eve was already
[1:10:42] taught
[1:10:43] by the serpent anybody clear he said she
[1:10:46] caught him
[1:10:47] and kissed him and with a water
[1:10:50] an important do you know what important
[1:10:52] means it is a face
[1:10:54] that doesn't have shame it is a
[1:10:58] shameless
[1:11:01] shameless face anybody clear
[1:11:05] remember last week when we spoke about
[1:11:08] the shame
[1:11:09] we showed you that same and nakedness
[1:11:12] goes together
[1:11:13] so a normal woman when she is exposed
[1:11:18] even if it's her husband
[1:11:22] she has a tendency to be shameful
[1:11:26] everybody here but if the shame
[1:11:29] is removed amen
[1:11:32] the only woman that have a shameless
[1:11:35] face
[1:11:36] jeremiah 3 verse 3 says that it is water
[1:11:42] it is a prostituted forehead that
[1:11:45] refused to be water
[1:11:47] that's why this woman is not ashamed
[1:11:50] because she is a harlot she's a
[1:11:53] she's a prostitute and a prostitute are
[1:11:56] not a shame
[1:11:57] amen why because the heart she receives
[1:12:00] is a heart of a beast
[1:12:03] anybody clear with an important face she
[1:12:06] said
[1:12:07] i have peace offering with me this day i
[1:12:10] have paid my vows so she is
[1:12:12] religious everybody here
[1:12:16] therefore came i forth to meet you
[1:12:19] diligently
[1:12:20] to seek your face and i have water find
[1:12:23] you
[1:12:23] we found that this woman here is
[1:12:26] speaking about the peace offering
[1:12:29] amen so this woman
[1:12:33] is religious
[1:12:36] it is a church anybody clear
[1:12:40] that church have an anointing of the
[1:12:43] devil
[1:12:45] and that anointing will cause the women
[1:12:49] to dress like prostitutes
[1:12:52] so now go all over the town
[1:12:55] look at the churches in the denomination
[1:12:59] even the church where we came out of it
[1:13:03] look at the way the women are dressing
[1:13:06] it is telling you which heart was
[1:13:10] introduced which anointed
[1:13:13] enter in the church
[1:13:17] ever clear so far blessed be the name of
[1:13:20] the lord let's go to isaiah 3.
[1:13:23] give me everybody there
[1:13:28] yeah let me zap that that's okay
[1:13:32] okay that's fine okay
[1:13:38] uh okay let's go verse
[1:13:41] 8 you don't want to call somebody
[1:13:45] in a party a diabetic and made it and
[1:13:48] make him wait three hours
[1:13:50] before you give him food
[1:13:54] for jerusalem is roon and judah is
[1:13:58] fallen
[1:13:59] because their tongue and their doing are
[1:14:02] against the lord
[1:14:03] remember they are against the law they
[1:14:05] are not for the lord
[1:14:07] this is jerusalem and judah this
[1:14:10] the the only kingdom that remain
[1:14:12] faithful to the lord
[1:14:14] now it's fallen everybody clear
[1:14:17] to provoke the eyes of his glory verse
[1:14:20] nine
[1:14:21] they show off their countenance in other
[1:14:24] words
[1:14:25] if you look at their face they show off
[1:14:28] their countenance
[1:14:30] that's weakness against them you don't
[1:14:32] have to talk to them
[1:14:34] if you love if you just look at their
[1:14:36] face
[1:14:37] it's already have a message anybody
[1:14:40] clear
[1:14:41] what is that message the fact they show
[1:14:44] off their countenance does witness
[1:14:46] against them
[1:14:48] and they declare their sin as water
[1:14:52] in other words they are not shamed
[1:14:57] they don't have any shame they are not
[1:15:00] even covering their sin they are bold
[1:15:04] with their seed they are openly showing
[1:15:06] you
[1:15:07] who they are don't want to hide their
[1:15:11] picture
[1:15:12] they are free to put them on facebook so
[1:15:15] so you know this is what we're doing
[1:15:18] it's an anointing they show off their
[1:15:21] countenance
[1:15:22] that's witness against them and they
[1:15:25] declare
[1:15:26] they are displaying they are seen as
[1:15:29] sodom they hide it not
[1:15:32] they don't hide it amen
[1:15:36] woe to their soul for they have rewarded
[1:15:40] evil to themselves in other words you
[1:15:43] look at their face
[1:15:44] even this anointing make people
[1:15:48] bold when they are in the wrong
[1:15:53] amena you guys don't believe that women
[1:15:57] should cut their hair
[1:15:59] i'm gonna cut my hair and put it on
[1:16:04] facebook
[1:16:09] moreover the lord says
[1:16:13] because the daughter of water
[1:16:17] not the hidden daughters these are
[1:16:20] daughters
[1:16:21] of zion who is the daughters of zion
[1:16:24] anybody clear if you notice the
[1:16:27] scripture never say
[1:16:29] the daughter
[1:16:32] anybody clear the scriptures say
[1:16:35] daughters
[1:16:36] in plural remember that
[1:16:41] because this prostitute in the book of
[1:16:44] revelation
[1:16:45] she is a mother of water
[1:16:50] how many harlots plural
[1:16:55] she's a church but the daughters of
[1:16:58] zion the churches
[1:17:03] they call themselves christians
[1:17:07] are you following me
[1:17:10] the daughters of zion are water
[1:17:14] they are proud number one
[1:17:18] they are haughty in other words they are
[1:17:22] proud
[1:17:23] you can't tell them nothing that's why
[1:17:26] they are bold
[1:17:27] that's why they don't fear anybody
[1:17:32] anybody clear if they are proud
[1:17:36] what is that what is the importance of
[1:17:38] being holy
[1:17:42] in proverbs 16 verse 18
[1:17:45] the bible says proud goes before water
[1:17:50] so these daughters are living in the
[1:17:54] time where god
[1:17:55] is about to bring destruction
[1:17:59] and before destruction there is an
[1:18:02] anointing that is going to drop
[1:18:04] in the churches and make them proud
[1:18:08] bossed and then i uh uh uh address
[1:18:12] themselves inappropriately
[1:18:17] blood goes before water
[1:18:20] this is what make lucifer fail
[1:18:24] in heaven and holy water
[1:18:27] spirit before a water so it shows that
[1:18:30] there is a destruction
[1:18:32] there is a fall coming out that's why
[1:18:35] brother branham said
[1:18:36] before judgment come you must enter in
[1:18:40] the spirit of judgment
[1:18:43] hallelujah proverbs 18 verse 12
[1:18:46] before what the heart of a man
[1:18:50] is water so when a man you begin to see
[1:18:54] a spirit of pride a spirit of heartiness
[1:18:58] upon a man where he knows everything
[1:19:01] you cannot tell a woman anything just
[1:19:04] not the next station
[1:19:06] you're gonna fall
[1:19:09] anybody clear before destruction
[1:19:13] the heart of a man is hoody that's what
[1:19:16] happened to lucifer
[1:19:17] and before honor is water
[1:19:20] you want to go up the way up is what
[1:19:23] that's why when you enter the pyramid
[1:19:26] the first section of the pyramid
[1:19:28] you go into the descending passage
[1:19:31] before you go to the
[1:19:32] ascending passage
[1:19:36] the people thought because the pyramid
[1:19:37] is long when you enter you begin to come
[1:19:40] when you enter you go down first
[1:19:43] everybody clear psalm 101 verse 5
[1:19:48] who so privily slander his neighbor in
[1:19:51] other words gossip about his neighbor
[1:19:53] him will not do water i will kill him
[1:19:56] him that has
[1:19:57] a water they look at people like this
[1:20:02] what do you want him they have
[1:20:05] a high look and a water
[1:20:09] will are not water god can put up with
[1:20:12] you
[1:20:13] that's why when lucifer express a proud
[1:20:16] heart
[1:20:17] god could not take it he have to go down
[1:20:22] but there is a spirit in the daughter of
[1:20:25] zion
[1:20:26] that is bringing that anointing
[1:20:30] they won't listen to anything they know
[1:20:33] everything
[1:20:34] the daughter of zion are hoody
[1:20:38] arrogant proud i don't want to talk to
[1:20:41] you
[1:20:42] you're not the kind of people i deal
[1:20:44] with
[1:20:46] i deal with big people not you
[1:20:51] anybody here i deal with big name
[1:20:54] in the message not a small one like
[1:20:59] on you that's it
[1:21:02] [Laughter]
[1:21:04] the daughter of zion are holding and
[1:21:07] walk with stretch fourth neck
[1:21:11] so not only do they have
[1:21:15] a proud spirit but there is
[1:21:18] something that isaiah detected
[1:21:22] on their walk amen
[1:21:26] they make stretched forth
[1:21:30] what is causing the neck of this woman
[1:21:33] to stretch forward
[1:21:37] ever here and not only that
[1:21:41] and they have what wanton eyes the words
[1:21:45] wanton means seductive eyes
[1:21:48] why because the anointing is an
[1:21:50] anointing
[1:21:51] of seduction of prostitution
[1:21:57] the neck and the eyes
[1:22:01] are seductive remember that the eyes
[1:22:05] of the tsunami was dove
[1:22:08] when they look at your eyes they see
[1:22:10] purity
[1:22:11] they see christian because the eyes are
[1:22:14] the gate to water
[1:22:16] there it is a camera that is reflecting
[1:22:19] your heart but when they look at the
[1:22:22] prostitute in their heart she has a
[1:22:24] tendency to cause
[1:22:25] seduction the mirror is reflected
[1:22:29] in the eyes that's why brother of adam
[1:22:31] said you want to get a cow
[1:22:33] they say look in the eyes but i'm saying
[1:22:35] the same applied to hope
[1:22:37] to women
[1:22:43] they want to nice come on walking
[1:22:46] isaiah comes back again to the walk
[1:22:49] walking
[1:22:50] and messing in other words twisting
[1:22:53] so what is making this woman to twist
[1:22:59] because the woman is walking normally
[1:23:01] but isaiah
[1:23:02] when he's looking at the time of the end
[1:23:07] before destruction comes isaiah notice a
[1:23:11] spirit on women
[1:23:12] and when those women are walking
[1:23:15] something
[1:23:16] is making them balance their
[1:23:20] hips
[1:23:23] hallelujah isaiah at that time
[1:23:27] didn't have the vocabulary that you have
[1:23:31] amen that's why nehem look he say
[1:23:34] i see chariot running with eyes like
[1:23:38] torches but what i'm saying he saw cars
[1:23:43] if you notice now never say i see
[1:23:46] chariot
[1:23:47] and horses did you notice that
[1:23:51] they usually say pharaoh his chariot and
[1:23:53] horses
[1:23:54] but when nehum spoke nehum said i see
[1:23:58] chariot running nehum never mentioned
[1:24:01] the
[1:24:02] horse in other words the chariot was
[1:24:05] running without a horse
[1:24:07] but the eyes of those chariots look like
[1:24:10] torches is his car
[1:24:15] but he didn't have your vocabulary to
[1:24:17] tell you that
[1:24:18] this one is a car he can express it
[1:24:22] through the vocabulary of his timer
[1:24:26] everybody here so when isaiah look he
[1:24:29] found out that the daughter of zion are
[1:24:31] walking
[1:24:32] and they are twisting and isaiah don't
[1:24:34] understand
[1:24:35] but something picked up isaiah like give
[1:24:38] them a little bit more detail
[1:24:40] so when malachi 4 will come
[1:24:44] he will identify what he was
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:49] ever clear he said they are walking
[1:24:53] and messing as they go so if they stop
[1:24:57] they're not messing it is when they work
[1:25:00] that they are balancing up everybody
[1:25:03] clear
[1:25:05] as they go and making a water
[1:25:08] and taking notes with water so when
[1:25:11] isaiah was
[1:25:12] looking isaiah saw the modern woman
[1:25:16] and isaiah look he could not describe
[1:25:19] isaiah said i see them they are walking
[1:25:22] and they are like men sing
[1:25:23] and also i'm hearing
[1:25:27] so okay they're making a tinkling nose
[1:25:31] do you remember the vision of the bride
[1:25:33] do you remember the women that were
[1:25:35] walking there
[1:25:38] everybody they are making a tinkling
[1:25:42] noise with the water
[1:25:44] let me ask you i can take a sister here
[1:25:46] walk here if you want to make a tickling
[1:25:48] nose
[1:25:50] with your feet go ahead and make a
[1:25:51] tinkling nose
[1:25:53] your feet are flesh how can your flesh
[1:25:56] make a thinking noise
[1:26:01] hallelujah let's go to zephaniah 1 and
[1:26:04] we're going to pray
[1:26:05] my god lord help me be gracious with me

[1:30:43] what is wrong clothing let's pray
[1:30:49] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:30:51] for your grace
[1:30:52] your love your mercy father and for
[1:30:55] everything you have been doing for us
[1:30:57] lord we went through a preparation to
[1:31:00] just come to this point
[1:31:02] so that your children can see not in a
[1:31:05] legalistic way
[1:31:06] but can detect the very spirit that is
[1:31:10] behind
[1:31:10] things lord i pray that you give
[1:31:14] a revelation not in the head of the
[1:31:17] people
[1:31:18] but father made that revelation drop in
[1:31:21] the heart
[1:31:22] because once it's dropped in the heart
[1:31:24] just like you did to our precious sister
[1:31:27] father there is no devil in hell that
[1:31:30] can remove from them
[1:31:32] and automatically whatever drop in the
[1:31:34] heart
[1:31:35] in the subconscious lord father we know
[1:31:38] that it will be reflected on the outside
[1:31:40] if it's not reflected then we know it
[1:31:43] has been stuck in the head
[1:31:44] in the intellectual part father may have
[1:31:47] made everyone in this church
[1:31:49] may they receive it in their heart and
[1:31:51] see
[1:31:52] what you are trying to say lord through
[1:31:54] the churches
[1:31:55] father we committed all and seal every
[1:31:58] demonic spirit
[1:31:59] away from this church and commit your
[1:32:02] children and to the hand
[1:32:03] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:32:07] if you outside click the link
[1:32:10] everybody clear we on part 43
[1:32:14] i want you to keep in mind here again
[1:32:16] that jesus said that you have heard
[1:32:19] that he was says by them of the old time
[1:32:21] that shall not commit water
[1:32:24] this is physical jesus magnifier but i
[1:32:27] say unto you
[1:32:28] that whosoever looks upon a man
[1:32:32] everybody clear so far why a woman
[1:32:35] because that's the only creature
[1:32:37] that was created as a byproduct
[1:32:41] a product of a product she was the only
[1:32:44] one that can cause
[1:32:45] problems that's why lucifer went to her
[1:32:50] not to adam but here lucifer never
[1:32:54] attack adam
[1:32:55] that's why when god begin to punish the
[1:32:58] woman
[1:33:02] everybody here god put the punishment
[1:33:06] on the conception do you follow me
[1:33:10] do you follow me and then god changed
[1:33:13] the covenant
[1:33:15] you follow me and god said that your
[1:33:17] husband
[1:33:18] who was of the original creation
[1:33:22] they want the devil didn't want to deal
[1:33:25] with it
[1:33:26] they want the devil waited for him to go
[1:33:29] out so he can talk to you i want
[1:33:33] that man to rule over you
[1:33:36] that rulership is not a curse
[1:33:40] that rulership is for protection
[1:33:47] do you follow me i wanted to
[1:33:50] open the door for the plan of redemption
[1:33:54] because my attributes are blocked
[1:33:58] that's why i made the woman a little bit
[1:34:01] different
[1:34:02] now that she unlocked the plan of
[1:34:04] redemption
[1:34:06] because i am the one who created hell i
[1:34:09] must provide a protection for hell
[1:34:13] now adam make sure you protect eve
[1:34:18] because she is a weaker vessel
[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:26] the woman was not given to you for abuse
[1:34:30] the woman was not giving to you for a
[1:34:33] sex story
[1:34:35] the woman was given to you for
[1:34:37] responsibility
[1:34:39] and protection
[1:34:41] [Applause]
[1:34:45] hallelujah that's why you heard me
[1:34:48] saying
[1:34:49] that's why you heard me saying if
[1:34:51] anybody begin to play with sisters in
[1:34:54] this church
[1:34:55] i'm gonna chase you away because
[1:34:58] as a husband to the church
[1:35:01] as a spiritual head i must protect
[1:35:04] their sisters
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:12] everybody there how did your woman fall
[1:35:17] how did your wife fall where were you at
[1:35:22] where were you at brother branham said
[1:35:26] when the americans soldier
[1:35:31] boy marriage and divorce is is he's just
[1:35:34] passing me like this
[1:35:35] by the bottom say when the american
[1:35:38] soldier went
[1:35:38] overseas he calls what to the women
[1:35:43] because what the women committed
[1:35:46] adultery
[1:35:50] you traveling you leave your wife for
[1:35:53] two years
[1:35:54] what do you expect
[1:36:00] what are you doing two years away from
[1:36:02] your wife
[1:36:03] you are supposed to be there for
[1:36:08] protection
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:13] are you there oh my god
[1:36:18] whosoever we condemn the women we
[1:36:20] condemn the women we condemn the woman

[1:36:27] ruler i'm the chief

[1:36:31] when the country is in war we want you
[1:36:33] to get in war
[1:36:40] it's automatic when a fight goes on the
[1:36:43] woman will go behind the husband
[1:36:46] why because of protection god said i
[1:36:49] finished the plan adam you the strong
[1:36:52] one you're the one that had the book of
[1:36:54] redemption you know
[1:36:55] now from the today go take care of him
[1:37:00] amen how many time have you seen
[1:37:03] a woman in the scripture going to war
[1:37:12] why they didn't put the woman to war
[1:37:16] where did the country start putting
[1:37:18] women in the army
[1:37:21] do you see why brother branham said it's
[1:37:23] a disgrace
[1:37:24] to even have a woman police officer
[1:37:30] the prophet is zeroed in with the
[1:37:32] scripture
[1:37:34] hallelujah who saw looking upon a woman
[1:37:37] but lust after her has commit water
[1:37:41] with her already in his water how can a
[1:37:45] woman cause somebody to lust after her
[1:37:47] everybody clear
[1:37:49] part 43 i want you to remember this
[1:37:52] please i want you to remember this
[1:37:54] because sometimes i say things at the
[1:37:56] beginning
[1:37:57] and people don't get it and they're
[1:37:59] going to ask a question later
[1:38:00] and i already said it at the beginning
[1:38:03] now i ask
[1:38:04] who our sister in spoken word tabernacle
[1:38:10] i have altered some of my words
[1:38:14] so that i could speak it before them
[1:38:17] this is marriage and divorce
[1:38:19] billy has in his pocket this morning
[1:38:23] out there some things that
[1:38:26] could not be said out before a mixed
[1:38:28] audience
[1:38:30] and some that are probably will do
[1:38:33] whatever
[1:38:35] he will say you must understand
[1:38:40] take it as from your home to the best
[1:38:43] that i know
[1:38:44] you would sit in the doctor's office
[1:38:47] and listen to him he would have to say
[1:38:50] very water
[1:38:52] you don't want a doctor that is speaking
[1:38:54] in code
[1:38:56] you want a doctor that tells you the
[1:38:59] truth
[1:39:00] plan the problem in the message
[1:39:04] especially in this country people
[1:39:07] preachers are not playing
[1:39:14] you are talking to a teenager like a 50
[1:39:17] years old man
[1:39:18] how is he going to understand what
[1:39:20] you're trying to say you say read
[1:39:22] between the land wait between the what
[1:39:24] line
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:29] everybody clear we must speak very plain
[1:39:33] to you
[1:39:34] and some of you young ladies and young
[1:39:37] men
[1:39:37] i don't want you to get the water
[1:39:40] brother brother i'm saying when i'm
[1:39:42] gonna speak plain to you
[1:39:44] i don't want you to misunderstand me
[1:39:47] everybody i don't want you to get the
[1:39:50] wrong impression
[1:39:51] i want you to believe and just do what
[1:39:55] remember truth has got to be
[1:39:59] everybody here so far what are you going
[1:40:03] brother stephen
[1:40:04] sometimes in speaking in the midsole yes
[1:40:08] as we have today both men and women
[1:40:12] that's what is here
[1:40:13] sometime using parable to get it point
[1:40:16] in
[1:40:18] it would seem like that maybe i must say
[1:40:21] something
[1:40:22] that would not be just appropriate
[1:40:26] among a mixed group of people you say
[1:40:28] whoa why did he say
[1:40:29] this but if you were sitting where
[1:40:34] in the doctor's office they would
[1:40:38] you will listen to him no matter if you
[1:40:41] are teenager
[1:40:42] or boy or whoever he was and we are well
[1:40:47] in the house of god where we are to have
[1:40:51] water
[1:40:52] and water and clean heart if we have not
[1:40:57] it is our place at the water in other
[1:41:00] words i'm gonna say
[1:41:01] things planned here if your mind is
[1:41:04] still
[1:41:05] traveling you need to go to the altar
[1:41:08] because truth must be preached as truth
[1:41:11] and i'm responsible to this church
[1:41:14] everybody clear so far
[1:41:16] blessed be the name of the lord you know
[1:41:19] this chart
[1:41:20] i told you we're getting back up to
[1:41:22] start going to the surface
[1:41:24] amen we spoke about the stage of being a
[1:41:27] baby
[1:41:28] we went to teenager adolescent and we
[1:41:31] found out
[1:41:32] according to ezekiel 16 that adolescence
[1:41:35] has its trouble
[1:41:36] we talk about the bill we talk about the
[1:41:39] smoking
[1:41:40] we talk about the women and we found out
[1:41:42] that adolescents have a tendency
[1:41:44] to have problem with clothing problem
[1:41:46] with makeup
[1:41:47] problem with hair that's why we have to
[1:41:49] go through all
[1:41:51] those territory to make sure we finish
[1:41:53] before we give you the solution
[1:41:55] for adolescent because the solution for
[1:41:58] a child
[1:41:59] brother branham said he was not a
[1:42:00] whooping it was water
[1:42:02] prayer everybody clear so far now
[1:42:06] going this brother branham says this i
[1:42:09] got a prophecy laying at home
[1:42:12] one of these days i'm going to read it
[1:42:14] and you wonder why
[1:42:16] i rap at women the way i do 30 years ago
[1:42:20] i got water that saved the lord
[1:42:24] 30 years ago this is in 1962. so god
[1:42:27] already spoke to brother branham in
[1:42:29] which here
[1:42:30] you see what i'm saying 30 years ago i
[1:42:33] got into that save the lord
[1:42:35] 30 years ago when i entered the ministry
[1:42:38] right
[1:42:38] at the beginning of brother branham
[1:42:41] ministry
[1:42:42] he told me the lord that the strain of
[1:42:46] water
[1:42:47] women will come so what and
[1:42:50] imputed in the last day
[1:42:53] they be the most defined thing
[1:42:56] on the earth it is summer
[1:43:00] go to the mom
[1:43:04] and you're gonna see that this scripture
[1:43:07] this quote
[1:43:08] has been fulfilled go to the mall
[1:43:12] go to the pool try to go take a shower
[1:43:16] in the pool
[1:43:17] you're going to come back with a legion
[1:43:19] of demons
[1:43:22] here right she started it
[1:43:25] at the water remember the trail of the
[1:43:28] serpent
[1:43:29] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[1:43:32] at the water
[1:43:34] itself god's eden at the beginning
[1:43:37] and then everybody clear you remember
[1:43:40] why we were preparing you now
[1:43:42] what about them say she started at the
[1:43:45] beginning
[1:43:46] and satan used his hair at the water
[1:43:49] in other words what satan did at the
[1:43:51] beginning
[1:43:52] satan knows that his time is ahead
[1:43:55] so he's going to multiply everything
[1:43:58] upon the
[1:43:59] women everybody so far and
[1:44:02] look what is happening look down through
[1:44:05] the ears
[1:44:06] said she shall continue to do water
[1:44:10] what do you see today is that what you
[1:44:12] saw 10 years ago
[1:44:15] they were tight they don't put anything
[1:44:17] they're out
[1:44:18] you get in a store today you need a holy
[1:44:22] ghost
[1:44:23] she shall continue to strip herself
[1:44:26] and say there shall be a little tiny
[1:44:29] group
[1:44:30] the very elect that is predestinated
[1:44:32] that will escape water
[1:44:35] that is your solution where are we going
[1:44:38] brother stephen
[1:44:39] anybody clear so far let me take off
[1:44:41] this airport
[1:44:44] lord oh search me try my case right now
[1:44:49] lord
[1:44:50] don't let me come have to come before
[1:44:53] judgment before you
[1:44:55] this is a prophet after preaching this
[1:44:58] way
[1:44:59] oh if there be any unclean thing in me
[1:45:03] lord take it away please we see a day
[1:45:08] that we are living in when men and women
[1:45:11] are becoming water
[1:45:13] there is a bold spirit
[1:45:17] a shameless spirit brother venom is
[1:45:20] saying the people are starting
[1:45:22] they are ashamed you say one time
[1:45:25] there is not even blush among the water
[1:45:30] in other words the women won't be
[1:45:32] shameless
[1:45:34] she can walk with an underwear and she's
[1:45:37] fine
[1:45:40] no blessing because a normal woman will
[1:45:43] blush
[1:45:45] but what is causing this woman not to
[1:45:47] blush
[1:45:49] by the problem there won't be no even
[1:45:52] blush among the daughters of zion
[1:45:54] their modesty has been so taken
[1:45:58] away till they don't even water
[1:46:01] in other words they left the state of
[1:46:04] innocency
[1:46:05] when they removed the veil eve was
[1:46:08] scared
[1:46:09] but this veil is removed and somebody is
[1:46:12] not ashamed
[1:46:13] it's a prostitute everybody clear
[1:46:16] oh lord think of it and know
[1:46:19] that the time peaceable is bleeding away
[1:46:22] just a minute or two more and the great
[1:46:25] water
[1:46:27] before fall will come you remember that
[1:46:30] because the great destruction will come
[1:46:33] then
[1:46:34] let him that is filthy be water
[1:46:37] when the rapture nobody will be saved
[1:46:41] anymore except the hundred and forty
[1:46:44] four thousand
[1:46:45] anybody following me brother branham
[1:46:48] continues
[1:46:49] hallelujah he says
[1:46:52] one day and the daughter of zion
[1:46:55] would walk how howdy proud
[1:46:59] in the last days they will fail to walk
[1:47:03] after who after the lord
[1:47:06] no matter what you say to them
[1:47:10] you can preach and preach
[1:47:13] and preach it's just like hitting
[1:47:16] against the wall over there by the
[1:47:19] problem saying
[1:47:20] that there is a spirit that is coming
[1:47:23] that we can preach
[1:47:24] we can preach we can preach it looks
[1:47:26] like the people
[1:47:27] are not affected what is causing that
[1:47:32] brother branham he said it said that's
[1:47:35] what
[1:47:36] upon water so there is an anointing
[1:47:40] when the prophet luke it's gross
[1:47:42] darkness upon the people
[1:47:44] and that gross darkness is there to
[1:47:47] block the gospel
[1:47:50] is going on there is no
[1:47:53] seems to be so hard to find a genuine
[1:47:57] water
[1:47:58] that is men or found a woman that is
[1:48:00] really a water
[1:48:02] why because there is gross darkness upon
[1:48:05] the people
[1:48:06] it is an anointing it is a spirit of
[1:48:09] prostitution that landed
[1:48:12] everybody here and that is just about
[1:48:15] the way the time are getting
[1:48:17] when we see the water the church that
[1:48:20] fell to recognize water they failed to
[1:48:24] recognize the message of the
[1:48:26] hour and because they kicked
[1:48:29] jesus outside in the church of laodicea
[1:48:34] jesus is outside knocking the whole
[1:48:37] church is in darkness
[1:48:41] when you see our daughters of zion doing
[1:48:44] the way they are doing
[1:48:46] when you see our brother that smokes
[1:48:50] drinks and tell dirty jokes and things
[1:48:53] and still trying to hold on the water
[1:48:56] these are not true sinners these are
[1:48:58] people that come to
[1:49:00] church but still living like unclean
[1:49:03] and try to hold their confession in
[1:49:05] christ
[1:49:06] oh my it is water and water
[1:49:10] that is what is upon the people stay
[1:49:13] tuned
[1:49:14] as we move in in proverbs 30
[1:49:18] verse 12 and 13 the bible says there
[1:49:21] is a word that are pure
[1:49:24] in their own eyes

[1:53:05] a woman is just like a what a prostitute
[1:53:08] because her heart is a heart of the
[1:53:11] devil
[1:53:12] everybody here so far let's go now
[1:53:17] hallelujah brother brother
[1:53:20] in genesis 3 21 the bible says
[1:53:24] adam unto adam also and to his wife
[1:53:28] did the lord god makes water coats of
[1:53:31] skin and deed water
[1:53:33] we explained to you that the first
[1:53:36] manufacturer
[1:53:37] was free ever here
[1:53:40] it was not enough to conceal and to
[1:53:43] protect the body
[1:53:45] god came and destroyed the manufacture
[1:53:48] that's why when jesus christ came he
[1:53:51] looked at the fig tree
[1:53:53] and he cursed the fig tree amen
[1:53:57] then god himself killed him and
[1:54:00] took the lamb and clothed the man and
[1:54:03] the reason why god was clothing
[1:54:06] we explained to you that the clothing of
[1:54:08] god
[1:54:09] was to do what it was to conceal
[1:54:14] or to cover because shame
[1:54:17] was brought by nakedness ever clear
[1:54:21] ezekiel 16 when i passed by thee you're
[1:54:24] already familiar with this
[1:54:26] i look upon them behold the time
[1:54:29] was the time of love you already know
[1:54:31] teenager anybody clear
[1:54:33] and i spread my skirt over thee
[1:54:37] and did what covered the water
[1:54:40] this is what he did in eden
[1:54:43] you understand so when you reach that
[1:54:45] teenager
[1:54:46] your hormone begins to work god comes
[1:54:49] and
[1:54:50] is interested in your clothing in you
[1:54:53] being properly covered because he
[1:54:56] doesn't want
[1:54:57] any other man to last after you
[1:55:00] everybody everybody understand
[1:55:03] nakedness i swear unto thee i enter into
[1:55:06] covenant with you say the lord god
[1:55:08] and you became mine because your first
[1:55:10] marriage is with christ
[1:55:12] then what shall deal with water because
[1:55:16] there is a generation that is filthy
[1:55:18] by the good in their own eyes they are
[1:55:20] not washed with water
[1:55:22] everybody i wash them with water the
[1:55:25] water of the world
[1:55:26] yeah i totally wash away the blood from
[1:55:29] the your birth
[1:55:31] and are naughty with water they give you
[1:55:34] the holy ghost
[1:55:35] and i did water i closed thee
[1:55:38] also with blood at work and i did water
[1:55:42] so god not only was he responsible
[1:55:47] for the clothing but god was
[1:55:50] responsible for the clothing and the
[1:55:53] water
[1:55:54] and the shoes
[1:55:58] everybody in eden god
[1:56:01] was only interested of clothing adam
[1:56:05] and adam left but in ezekiel
[1:56:08] when god comes in the time of puberty
[1:56:12] god cover the body and god
[1:56:16] make sure he also supply the shoes
[1:56:20] why is god interested in the shoes
[1:56:24] everybody clear so far brother branham
[1:56:28] when isaiah have
[1:56:31] he talked about her immorals of women
[1:56:34] who get in the last days and how there
[1:56:37] be

[2:01:18] before they hit the water so right here
[2:01:21] is a highway
[2:01:25] there is a highway here but branham here
[2:01:28] is preaching
[2:01:28] to the whole congregation of the earth
[2:01:30] that's why he was a man

[2:12:40] brotherly love
[2:12:41] he get tight
[2:12:45] amen and when you get tight you are
[2:12:48] close to the
[2:12:50] gate of heaven
[2:12:53] are you following me brother brother
[2:12:56] she run as hard as she can and the road
[2:12:59] got narrower
[2:13:00] and narrower she stopped water and water
[2:13:04] as she daughter at the end
[2:13:08] she began to find out that it's a
[2:13:09] problem amen
[2:13:11] she didn't listen and mother said
[2:13:15] the horrible scream that i
[2:13:18] ever heard in my life was that woman
[2:13:22] doing what
[2:13:24] before destruction what cancer
[2:13:30] she didn't want to listen to the prophet
[2:13:32] she challenged the prophet
[2:13:34] she challenged the teaching of the
[2:13:36] prophet
[2:13:38] ever and before we get to heaven
[2:13:42] and followed me away what happened
[2:13:45] everybody
[2:13:46] she fall in does what and smoke
[2:13:50] going down like that i turn around and i
[2:13:53] say what
[2:13:55] you see what i was telling you she
[2:13:57] didn't listen
[2:13:59] what is this thing that makes the woman
[2:14:03] pitch over when he pitches the woman
[2:14:07] it is also affecting her neck affecting
[2:14:10] her waist
[2:14:11] affecting her muscles and affecting also
[2:14:14] her work everybody clear
[2:14:18] there is two women standing here
[2:14:22] remember my coat at the beginning you
[2:14:25] remember my quote at the beginning
[2:14:27] okay if you look at this woman this
[2:14:30] woman is straight
[2:14:32] and this is called the center of gravity
[2:14:36] it is pretty much balanced with her body
[2:14:39] everybody understand
[2:14:41] if you look at this woman her center of
[2:14:45] gravity
[2:14:46] is shifted yes everybody clear
[2:14:49] what is causing that tilt
[2:14:53] if you look down at the bottom of this
[2:14:56] woman
[2:14:57] you see that there is something that has
[2:15:00] been elevated on the woman
[2:15:03] if you sit like i'm sitting flat you can
[2:15:06] pitch other
[2:15:08] the only way they can make you pitch
[2:15:10] over they have to raise you up
[2:15:12] when they range you up then the force of
[2:15:15] gravity
[2:15:16] begin to pull you down the earthly
[2:15:18] forces
[2:15:19] you remember moses said the forces of
[2:15:22] gravity
[2:15:23] ever clear when they pitch this woman
[2:15:26] if you notice right here that preaching
[2:15:30] is pushing her belly
[2:15:34] toward the front
[2:15:37] everybody follow me if i take my phone
[2:15:41] and i put it like this if i do this
[2:15:44] the gravity on this side have increased
[2:15:47] the forces
[2:15:48] it's is gonna pull this phone down if i
[2:15:50] leave this phone like this it's gonna go
[2:15:52] down
[2:15:53] amen but in order to keep this phone up
[2:15:56] i must do something to readjust the
[2:15:59] phone
[2:16:00] everybody clear so the readjustment of
[2:16:04] the phone
[2:16:05] is making a woman now begin to be
[2:16:10] designed with a new form
[2:16:15] that she doesn't have you follow me
[2:16:19] the normal woman look like this
[2:16:23] everybody follow me when you answer
[2:16:26] the heel she's gonna receive
[2:16:30] a new form
[2:16:33] that she doesn't have
[2:16:38] anybody follow me let me continue
[2:16:41] when he moved her like that brother
[2:16:44] branham say
[2:16:45] that is what is affecting her neck
[2:16:49] because the neck gotta be balanced
[2:16:52] everybody follow me
[2:16:53] not only does he affect the neck if you
[2:16:56] notice the torso
[2:16:58] of this woman here if you notice her
[2:17:02] breast
[2:17:03] remember my coat at the beginning if you
[2:17:06] notice her breasts
[2:17:07] here they are come over there they are
[2:17:12] up
[2:17:14] now the chest begin to provoke
[2:17:21] we follow me this chest
[2:17:24] is now different than that one now not
[2:17:27] only
[2:17:28] is the chest changing if you notice the
[2:17:31] west
[2:17:32] of this woman is pushed toward the back
[2:17:38] you follow me who caused that
[2:17:43] the shifting of the angle are you
[2:17:46] following me
[2:17:48] the muscles get pressure
[2:17:51] you won't hire him before you know when
[2:17:54] you get in a car you
[2:17:55] take them off quickly you know the
[2:17:57] reason why you take them off
[2:17:59] amen because there were tension going on
[2:18:02] they barely move toward the front the
[2:18:05] bat pushes up
[2:18:07] and the front move up that was not the
[2:18:10] way you were born
[2:18:12] you were born this way you were not born
[2:18:14] like this
[2:18:15] you now design
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:21] by the devil who loves the hero
[2:18:26] everybody follow me that's why i have to
[2:18:28] go through that now it's clicking
[2:18:30] everybody following me the masters get
[2:18:33] pressure
[2:18:34] that's why you get in the car off you
[2:18:37] want to breathe
[2:18:38] because you are doing work
[2:18:41] help me brother stephen
[2:18:46] remember my quote remember my quote at
[2:18:49] the beginning
[2:18:51] sister remember my quote at the
[2:18:52] beginning okay
[2:18:55] if you have a problem with your mind to
[2:18:56] the altar remember my coat
[2:18:59] brother make sure it's bigger not too
[2:19:01] big
[2:19:02] so when they go home they see it if you
[2:19:05] look at the normal woman standing up
[2:19:07] straight
[2:19:08] her and the flow are 90 degree
[2:19:12] everybody follow me but when they give
[2:19:15] you a high heel
[2:19:17] brother brother say you are pitched over
[2:19:20] the high heel is gonna bring you down
[2:19:23] this way according to the plan of
[2:19:26] gravitation
[2:19:27] right there when you pitch the plane of
[2:19:30] gravitation
[2:19:31] shift with you are you following me
[2:19:34] but if you stay this way you're gonna
[2:19:37] fall
[2:19:38] you won't be able to continue so your
[2:19:41] body
[2:19:42] have to readjust with
[2:19:45] the new plan of gravity you follow me
[2:19:49] if you notice right here you will see
[2:19:52] that
[2:19:53] this woman after the heels i
[2:19:56] alter over there here the body
[2:20:00] is proportionally
[2:20:03] stabilized between the ax
[2:20:06] if you look here you're gonna see that
[2:20:09] the front of the woman
[2:20:11] is now more toward the front compared to
[2:20:14] the axe
[2:20:16] this acts and this asks is the same
[2:20:20] but the hill as he pitched the woman
[2:20:23] everybody clear as he shifted the woman
[2:20:26] the body have to readjust back
[2:20:29] to keep the woman erected when the body
[2:20:32] he rejects
[2:20:34] it's gonna shift the woman toward the
[2:20:36] front that's why you see
[2:20:37] the in here they were part here part
[2:20:41] there
[2:20:41] in here almost in the back there is
[2:20:43] nothing
[2:20:44] everybody care then everything is
[2:20:47] shifted to the front
[2:20:49] who does that they hide here
[2:20:53] anybody clear their body shift to the
[2:20:56] front
[2:20:57] the shifting of the body to the front
[2:21:00] change the center of gravitation
[2:21:05] to be proportional to the twisting
[2:21:08] of the angle of your shoe
[2:21:14] you follow me if your shoe
[2:21:17] is a small hill like this no problem
[2:21:21] somebody asked a question how high
[2:21:24] are you clear the more height you going
[2:21:28] the more shifting the body have to
[2:21:31] adjust
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:35] if you look at this plane here this
[2:21:38] plane
[2:21:38] is parallel to the other one because the
[2:21:41] body is twisting
[2:21:43] and not only do you twist your womb as a
[2:21:46] woman twist
[2:21:49] are you following me relax i hope
[2:21:52] nobody's sleeping
[2:21:53] everybody clear what is he talking about
[2:21:56] when this shifts the back of a woman
[2:22:01] does two things he pushes
[2:22:04] backward and uphold
[2:22:09] do you want me to repeat again i'm
[2:22:11] talking to this church
[2:22:13] do you want me to repeat again this
[2:22:15] shifting here
[2:22:16] take the breast of the woman and does
[2:22:19] two thing to it it pushes that toward
[2:22:22] the back
[2:22:23] and he elevated again that's why
[2:22:27] if you look at this back not only is he
[2:22:29] back it's elevated
[2:22:32] who does that the serpent
[2:22:37] now when you are adjusted like that
[2:22:40] you reach a parallel with the new plane
[2:22:44] according to the hill you use
[2:22:48] now you won't fall back here
[2:22:52] if you look at this part here it becomes
[2:22:55] different than that part so the woman
[2:22:59] is pushed to the front and to the back
[2:23:03] where do you get this brother stephen
[2:23:06] hallelujah in the message presuming
[2:23:10] brother branham say brother i see these
[2:23:14] people walking through the street
[2:23:16] these water stretch out
[2:23:20] want on water the neck are
[2:23:23] stretched out hills on about water
[2:23:27] it is not here but it's water
[2:23:31] you follow me heal about so high
[2:23:35] why men push what
[2:23:38] are you sleeping women push out
[2:23:42] where the brother problem i'm learning
[2:23:44] this
[2:23:46] why did brad branham learn this did he
[2:23:49] have this chart
[2:23:53] this is in 1962 women
[2:23:57] pushed out in the water and out in the
[2:24:00] water
[2:24:01] and around like water where did brother
[2:24:04] brother learn this
[2:24:09] and some women said to me a pentecostal
[2:24:12] woman
[2:24:13] say wearing this little bead skirt you
[2:24:16] know
[2:24:16] just about half way down on the water
[2:24:20] keep that keep the knees
[2:24:23] okay why brother branham that is the
[2:24:25] only count they make
[2:24:27] they make sewing machine and sell goods
[2:24:30] see that's
[2:24:30] all dirty spirit is on you why
[2:24:34] would a pentecostal woman want to act
[2:24:36] like that
[2:24:37] she's not what she's just got the name
[2:24:41] of what
[2:24:42] in other words she doesn't have an
[2:24:43] experience about here
[2:24:46] brother stephen continue in the message
[2:24:50] no if not
[2:24:51] and here is the other flesh and i speak
[2:24:54] in a mixed audience going to speak to
[2:24:56] you
[2:24:56] as a water that's what i'm doing
[2:24:59] as the water here is the flesh it's weak
[2:25:03] this young lady came twisting every form
[2:25:07] her body working with a pair of what
[2:25:11] not heal shoes by water high heel
[2:25:15] shoes on and what is the high heels she
[2:25:19] was doing
[2:25:20] herself what stuck out water
[2:25:24] in the front and water this is what
[2:25:26] brother branham is telling you
[2:25:28] in the front and back and the dress is
[2:25:32] high above the water
[2:25:34] remember the knees oh a pair of shorts
[2:25:38] on
[2:25:39] do you know the bible said she will act
[2:25:42] like that
[2:25:44] you know the bible says that is the way
[2:25:46] she would act
[2:25:47] how she won't be so what so that pushing
[2:25:51] out on the front and pushing out
[2:25:54] in the back is making you look filthy
[2:25:58] in the eyes of god
[2:26:02] hallelujah brother stephen where are we
[2:26:05] going
[2:26:06] when the plan is shifted like this
[2:26:10] this womb that was resting calm is
[2:26:13] twisted
[2:26:17] what is going on the brother of the
[2:26:19] bible says
[2:26:21] adam was not deceived by the woman being
[2:26:24] deceived
[2:26:24] was in the transgression notwithstanding
[2:26:27] she shall be saved in childbearing
[2:26:29] if she continue in water in faith
[2:26:32] and holiness not having a baby
[2:26:36] make her safe but because she is raising
[2:26:40] children
[2:26:40] doing her duty not raising water
[2:26:44] cats dogs and whatever more to take the
[2:26:47] price the
[2:26:48] place of a child and that and us to do
[2:26:50] as
[2:26:51] they do today giving its mother love so
[2:26:54] that she can go out and run around all
[2:26:56] night
[2:26:57] some people do that sorry but they do it
[2:26:59] that is awful rude for me to say
[2:27:02] but it's the truth they don't want a
[2:27:04] baby to be tied down with it
[2:27:06] in other words the child became like a
[2:27:08] blockage in their life
[2:27:09] if that is your attitude something is
[2:27:12] wrong in your mind
[2:27:14] everybody brother branham said today
[2:27:17] it is a dishonor almost to see a big
[2:27:20] family anymore
[2:27:22] they rather pay a hundred dollars for a
[2:27:24] little snowy
[2:27:26] uh nose dog and pack it around and give
[2:27:29] it the love of a mother
[2:27:31] and practice birth control that then to
[2:27:34] have children
[2:27:35] think of that something old hang around
[2:27:37] to the bar
[2:27:38] and drink and play a card in other words
[2:27:40] we want to go out we gotta we want to
[2:27:41] hang out we want to go out
[2:27:43] when we have babies too much we need to
[2:27:45] go me and my husband we need to go the
[2:27:47] baby is troubling us
[2:27:49] amen why it's a disgrace
[2:27:53] that's right the greatest what i know a
[2:27:56] woman can do outside
[2:27:58] of the coming to christ outside of
[2:28:00] coming to christ
[2:28:02] and being loyal to her husband is to
[2:28:04] have what
[2:28:07] you might be nursing a little preacher
[2:28:09] how do you know
[2:28:13] ever clear but this position affected
[2:28:17] the womb
[2:28:17] and medically proven it causes some
[2:28:20] women not to wear children
[2:28:22] to bear children because of what
[2:28:25] the shifting of the hill you look on the
[2:28:28] front brother branham
[2:28:30] but when you come to go out on the
[2:28:33] outside
[2:28:34] and maybe wear whatever so much of a
[2:28:37] blouse
[2:28:39] and so forth and then boost yourself
[2:28:42] out there with water but the problem is
[2:28:45] saying
[2:28:46] what the devil did after shifting the
[2:28:50] woman
[2:28:50] with him and giving her a temporary
[2:28:55] lustful shape everybody clear
[2:28:59] the devil doesn't stop there because
[2:29:02] he pushed you toward the front he
[2:29:05] invented
[2:29:06] a different strap for women to boost
[2:29:09] again your breast
[2:29:12] to cause a man to last after you
[2:29:16] [Music]
[2:29:18] i'm gonna read it over now maybe wear
[2:29:22] so much of the blood and so forth and
[2:29:25] then boost what
[2:29:27] yourself out there with what
[2:29:30] that was the odd calling and things that
[2:29:33] look water
[2:29:35] and cause what you understand now
[2:29:39] cause man do you realize that is
[2:29:42] a spirit of water
[2:29:45] so you don't want to do that sister
[2:29:48] don't you do that
[2:29:49] that is hollywood what
[2:29:52] it is a different makeup the holy would
[2:29:55] make you up the devil design you now
[2:29:59] differently when you go home you take
[2:30:02] that strap off
[2:30:03] you take the high heel off you're gonna
[2:30:05] look different
[2:30:07] then your true shape comes yes
[2:30:12] love a woman on facebook good luck
[2:30:15] don't you do that that is hollywood
[2:30:18] makeup
[2:30:19] and trap of the devil when you do that
[2:30:22] you make men things water wrong thing
[2:30:26] about you
[2:30:26] and when you do that then you are guilty
[2:30:29] of committing water
[2:30:31] adultery with a man because you
[2:30:32] presented yourself
[2:30:34] that way to him you can't help
[2:30:37] the way you are working
[2:30:43] sister remember my two quote some
[2:30:47] women by shape they have eight shape
[2:30:56] anybody care what people call coca-cola
[2:31:01] you know the old coca-cola right
[2:31:04] some women by shape they are straight
[2:31:10] some are flooded some are more
[2:31:13] pronounced
[2:31:15] the one who created you is god
[2:31:20] the one who gave you that shape is god
[2:31:23] brother brother i'm saying you can't
[2:31:24] help it but you need to be
[2:31:27] mindful of your shape
[2:31:31] are you there there are certain fabric
[2:31:35] that don't belong to all the women
[2:31:40] if you are flat you can wear anything
[2:31:44] nothing happens but if your shape is
[2:31:47] more pronounced
[2:31:49] you better watch what you're putting on
[2:31:53] because the fabric you use
[2:31:56] can accentuate your shape
[2:31:59] and you cause trouble while in your
[2:32:02] heart you are innocent
[2:32:05] and when you put on high heels
[2:32:08] you make it worse
[2:32:14] my robe is long my dress is long
[2:32:18] it's okay did you watch your ship
[2:32:24] you what do you get me if a woman is
[2:32:27] heavyset
[2:32:29] sometime that says absorb
[2:32:33] her her toes
[2:32:37] are you there if a woman is skinny
[2:32:41] that's where the devil works with the
[2:32:43] high heel
[2:32:46] so you skin here you big on the top and
[2:32:49] you peek on the bottom
[2:32:51] when you pass a man does this damn
[2:33:02] are you there you caused that you wear
[2:33:06] your clothes so tight
[2:33:08] and you put her head on and you're
[2:33:10] causing problems
[2:33:12] sister you're gonna find yourself you
[2:33:15] have to answer for adultery
[2:33:20] oh my god you can't help the way you are
[2:33:24] built
[2:33:25] but just go around and stay the way god
[2:33:28] did what
[2:33:29] don't try to make yourself something
[2:33:31] that you are water
[2:33:33] because when you do that you are giving
[2:33:36] a different
[2:33:36] shape you are perverted by the devil you
[2:33:40] are
[2:33:40] designed by the devil hallelujah
[2:33:44] brother branham then
[2:33:47] i do some of these women that put on
[2:33:50] little strap
[2:33:51] under them to throw their self out
[2:33:54] don't even look like a human being they
[2:33:57] got a purpose in doing that
[2:33:59] that is what that's why do you call you
[2:34:02] you hear people
[2:34:03] telling you you look sexy it's not a
[2:34:05] compliment
[2:34:06] it is telling you you are provoking
[2:34:10] amen ungodly a woman where
[2:34:14] ever so many clothes and try to make
[2:34:17] herself look like something she's not
[2:34:20] everybody follow me why women are
[2:34:24] actually that way
[2:34:25] it's some kind of hollywood stuff and
[2:34:28] the devil
[2:34:30] and the devil spirit get on them women
[2:34:32] to make them try to do what

[2:49:07] revelation to each one lord

[2:49:15] they can recognize that their body
[2:49:18] is the temple of the holy spirit and
[2:49:20] that they should present
