morning amen you can be seated actually yes god bless you saints uh just a quick testimony um you knew i was down with that terrible covet disease and i wasn't really sick as such it just triggered my sinuses and it's just my sinuses for just been raining draining draining making me cough cough cough and sometimes it comes so violently that i i choke and i get out of breath but then after it's gone i'm just normal so i've been battling that and i prayed and i claimed my healing tried to seek if there's anything i hadn't done that would hinder my prayers going up and you know how the enemy fights you but my faith has been steadfast listen to the messages demonology and all than claiming my healing so the enemy has just been pushing it pushing it and sometimes even when i'm in the middle of that prayer the cough comes and of course you know i have to stop but yesterday i went to work and i was i just passed by one of the patient's rooms and then later on that that patient's nurse asked me to go in there and help the patient and as i walked in the patient said oh we were just talking about you and uh you know because i want that because he wasn't my patient and he said i just told her that you're a christian i can feel the presence of the lord within you there's something different about you and that really encouraged me it really really really encouraged me i said thank you lord thank you lord you know when you when you're battling sometimes you pray you feel like okay lord what have i done is there something that i need to make right oh you know and and but you're not

you know and went into it a little bit and she said get let's get over here out of the way we were kind of in the way and uh she says i need to tell you something i said oh am i in trouble she said yes i thought oh my goodness i don't offended this lady she was a 70 year old 71 year old black lady and she said she said she said when you're telling me these things she she says i'm going to touch your face but it's not sexual put her hands on my face and she said when you're telling me these things there's a glow about you are you talking about being encouraged sister well ma'am that's not me
