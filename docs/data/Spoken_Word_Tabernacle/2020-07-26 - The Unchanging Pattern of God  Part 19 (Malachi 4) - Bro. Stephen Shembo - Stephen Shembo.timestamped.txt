[45:15] of the law
[45:17] and it was not one angel it was many
[45:19] angels
[45:20] and we found out that that same scene
[45:23] repeated itself in revelation 10.
[45:26] so before they tell you about elijah
[45:29] the holy spirit is telling you remember
[45:32] what happened with moses over there he
[45:35] didn't say remember moses
[45:37] but remember the law the law came with a
[45:40] mighty angel
[45:41] the law came with an angel coming down
[45:45] with a book in his right hand on monsana
[45:48] or among horeb
[45:49] if we call it so god is pointing your
[45:52] attention there
[45:53] like remember what happened there and
[45:56] watch what i'm about to tell you
[45:58] so remember the law of moses my servant
[46:02] not moses by the law which are commanded
[46:05] to him
[46:06] in horeb and we all know that that
[46:09] opened the door that god
[46:10] only speak through a prophet are you
[46:13] there
[46:16] unto him in horeb for all
[46:19] israel with the statute and judgment
[46:24] behold i will send you
[46:27] elijah so there is ascending here
[46:30] and it's very important for you to
[46:32] remember that
[46:33] verb to send because sending
[46:37] all the mystery together when god is
[46:40] sending someone
[46:42] you must know what you're doing behold i
[46:45] will send you
[46:46] elijah the prophet before the coming
[46:50] of the great and dreadful day of the
[46:53] lord so before
[46:54] this trouble this big day of
[46:57] judgment elijah the prophet must come
[47:00] but remember what happened in horeb
[47:03] that's exactly what's going to happen
[47:04] with him
[47:05] verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of
[47:08] the father
[47:09] to the children we already explained
[47:11] that he's going to take the fathers
[47:13] the heart of the fathers
[47:17] to all the children
[47:20] and we saw that this was fulfilled
[47:24] under john the baptist we explained this
[47:27] in part three part everybody there
[47:31] and he shall turn the heart of the
[47:33] father to the children
[47:35] we deal with that but now we're gonna
[47:38] deal with this today
[47:40] and the heart of the children to their
[47:44] fathers this one was john the baptist
[47:48] the second one is the children
[47:51] who are the fathers
[47:54] if you notice these fathers is plural
[47:59] it's not one person are you there
[48:02] these children also is plural
[48:06] and if you look carefully you will find
[48:08] out that the problem
[48:10] is on your left side
[48:14] the problem is not on your right side
[48:17] the right side is the correct side
[48:20] whoever is on this side is correct
[48:24] whoever is on this side is the one
[48:26] having trouble
[48:28] this heart have a trouble this heart
[48:32] have departed from the lord
[48:34] so we must take this heart and turn it
[48:37] to this one
[48:38] because this one is the good one
[48:41] everybody there
[48:42] so these children have problems
[48:46] so we gotta take the heart of these
[48:48] children and turn them back to the
[48:50] father
[48:51] are you there so this father are correct
[48:55] and these children are also correct
[48:58] and we know when we study this that this
[49:01] children
[49:02] was not speaking about many children but
[49:05] he was speaking of
[49:06] one child and that child was crushed
[49:10] did christ ever depart from faith
[49:14] no way are you there so that side never
[49:17] departed from faith
[49:19] are you there but this is the part that
[49:22] departed from the faith
[49:24] and the children will leave faith but
[49:27] the
[49:27] father will not leave faith
[49:30] everybody clear the heart of the
[49:34] children to the father
[49:36] lest i come and smite the earth
[49:40] with a curse now if you read this
[49:44] superficially
[49:45] you're not going to understand what is
[49:47] going on
[49:48] if you look at another translation to
[49:51] smite the earth with a curse
[49:53] it means to destroy totally the earth
[49:57] are you there so in other words if
[50:00] elijah
[50:01] does not come
[50:05] everybody clear god is going to destroy
[50:08] the earth
[50:09] [Music]
[50:10] are you there remember last sunday
[50:12] elijah there's two things
[50:15] he's gonna restore first the baptism
[50:18] of the holy spirit the genuine baptism
[50:21] of the holy spirit
[50:22] that's the first thing that he does
[50:24] everybody there
[50:26] and the second things that elijah is
[50:28] going to do
[50:29] is to build to bring the book of
[50:32] redemption down back again to the race
[50:35] of adam
[50:36] adam everybody there the book of
[50:39] redemption
[50:41] so malacca is telling you that if elijah
[50:44] does not come
[50:46] god is going to destroy the earth
[50:50] are you there but we know that the book
[50:53] of redemption was in the hand of the
[50:55] original owner
[50:56] everybody there then in revelation 5
[50:59] john was weeping
[51:00] because no one was found worthy to take
[51:03] the book and to break the seals
[51:05] in other words if no one break the seals
[51:09] are you there the entire creation
[51:12] is destroyed everybody there
[51:16] so that event was given to john the
[51:18] baptism
[51:19] as a vision but it was not fulfilled yet
[51:23] the fulfillment of that event was
[51:26] connected to the coming of elijah
[51:30] are you there because if no one breaks
[51:32] the seals
[51:33] that means that the entire creation
[51:37] is completely destroyed are you there
[51:40] so when the lambs come to take the book
[51:43] brother brother said that the blast that
[51:46] hit
[51:47] sunset mountain was a signal to him
[51:51] that the seventh seal was broken in
[51:54] heaven
[51:55] so when bro god broke the seven seal
[51:58] a time they hit heaven are you there
[52:02] and that time they came down and blasted
[52:05] sunset mountain
[52:06] are you there that's why brother branham
[52:08] say i went to west for the
[52:11] blast that blast was a signal that
[52:15] the seven seal is broken in other words
[52:19] the book of redemption is open
[52:22] it is coming down so because it is
[52:25] broken
[52:26] there is a kingsman redeemer that picked
[52:29] up the book
[52:30] and now he's sending the book down are
[52:33] you there
[52:34] and because of that god cannot destroy
[52:37] the earth
[52:39] because the entire creation was
[52:42] waiting for the expectation of the sons
[52:44] and daughters of god
[52:46] the creation is groaning together are
[52:49] you there
[52:49] they are groaning because they need the
[52:52] book of redemption
[52:53] back in the hand of man so if elijah
[52:57] doesn't come
[52:58] the earth is going to be destroyed but
[53:01] because
[53:02] elijah cometh god cannot destroy the
[53:05] earth
[53:07] are we there that's why he said lest
[53:10] in other words except if he doesn't come
[53:14] then i'm gonna disturb you so that
[53:16] passage right there
[53:17] was already locked king the seventh seal
[53:20] right here
[53:22] that's why brother branham said the
[53:23] seventh seal is all the way to genesis
[53:26] if you look at the scriptures
[53:28] superficially
[53:29] you're gonna come up with a superficial
[53:32] understanding let's go to mark chapter
[53:40] nine
[53:43] praise the lord
[53:49] mark 9 first one
[53:52] if you dare you can say amen i hope
[53:55] those that are missing
[53:57] are going back and catching up because
[54:00] you might be wondering what we are
[54:01] saying
[54:02] if you miss two three part you're gonna
[54:04] be lost we don't want you to get lost
[54:07] anymore
[54:07] i don't want to meet jesus christ and
[54:09] say you never taught them
[54:11] i'm going to tell them i taught them
[54:12] part 1 part 2 all the way to 19.
[54:16] and it was on youtube and they had a
[54:18] chance to go back and review it
[54:20] so they didn't want to do it it's not my
[54:23] problem
[54:24] it is in your hand
[54:29] yeah being a pastor is not a genius easy
[54:32] job i want to make sure
[54:33] i pass the ball to you when i get there
[54:37] i say
[54:37] they were there the one that have the
[54:38] ball it's not me
[54:41] brother stephen say no the bible say
[54:45] brother branham say
[54:48] mark chapter 9 verse 1
[54:51] and he said to them verily i say unto
[54:55] you
[54:56] that there be some of them that stand
[54:58] here he's talking to the disciple jesus
[55:01] we shall not test death till they have
[55:04] seen the kingdom of god come with
[55:06] power so there were certain disciples
[55:08] that are not going to die until they
[55:10] have a vision
[55:11] of the kingdom of god coming down and
[55:14] after sixth day
[55:17] jesus takes with him peter
[55:21] and james and john there is a mystery to
[55:23] these three people
[55:24] i'm not going to touch it here and leads
[55:27] them
[55:28] up in the high mountain a part by
[55:31] themselves
[55:32] and he was transfigured before them and
[55:34] his remnant became
[55:36] shining exceeding white as snow
[55:39] so as no fuller on earth can wipe them
[55:44] and there appeared to them elijah
[55:47] with moses and they were talking with
[55:50] jesus in other words in this vision
[55:55] we see that elijah and moses appear
[55:59] we are trying we are dealing with elijah
[56:01] right here
[56:03] now drop down to verse 11.
[56:08] and they ask him the disciple everybody
[56:10] there
[56:12] saying why say the scrub
[56:16] that elijah must first
[56:19] come so they went into the mountain
[56:24] and when they were in the mountains they
[56:26] found out that
[56:27] elijah and moses was there so the
[56:30] scripture
[56:31] hit them back like wait a minute
[56:34] the rubber the scrub were teaching
[56:37] us that elijah must come
[56:41] before the coming of the messiah
[56:45] so now we just saw elijah
[56:49] in the mountain but the scrub told us
[56:53] that elijah must first come
[56:56] but you are the messiah you already come
[57:00] you already came how can elijah come
[57:04] after you you see this bible now
[57:08] a new book are you there in other words
[57:11] you already hear
[57:12] elijah was expected to come before you
[57:15] but how come elijah came after you
[57:19] that was the question because the scrub
[57:23] thought that where did the scrub learn
[57:26] it
[57:29] the only scripture in the old testament
[57:32] speaking about elijah is malachi phone
[57:35] so the keraba were teaching them that
[57:38] before the messiah come elijah will come
[57:42] first but they missed it
[57:47] the disciple of jesus christ missed it
[57:51] are you there and when they saw him on
[57:54] transfiguration they said wait a minute
[57:55] this is backward
[57:57] he was supposed to come first then later
[58:00] on the messiah comes
[58:01] how is he that you came he's coming
[58:04] after
[58:07] let's go to luke chapter one
[58:18] elijah must come first
[58:22] luke chapter 1 verse 13. if you dare you
[58:25] can say amen
[58:30] but the angel said to him fear not to
[58:32] zechariah
[58:33] for your prayer is heard and your wife
[58:36] elizabeth shall bear you a son
[58:37] and you shall call his name john we went
[58:40] through this
[58:42] and you shall have joy and gladness and
[58:45] many shall we jose at his birth
[58:47] for he shall be great in the sight of
[58:50] the lord
[58:51] not in the sight of men and shall drink
[58:54] neither wine nor string
[58:56] strong drink we already explain you this
[58:58] everybody there
[59:00] and he shall be filled with the holy
[59:02] ghost
[59:03] even from his mother's womb right here
[59:06] is speaking about the holy ghost
[59:09] let's drop down and many of the children
[59:12] of israel
[59:14] shall he turn to the lord their
[59:17] god so the ministry of john
[59:21] was to the children of israel
[59:25] specific the children here the father
[59:28] were the children of israel
[59:32] in other words they were the jews
[59:36] everybody clear okay
[59:40] verse 17 and he shall go before him
[59:43] in the spirit and power of
[59:48] they say that john the baptist has the
[59:51] holy ghost
[59:54] are you following me then here they say
[59:56] that he have the spirit
[59:59] and the power of elijah so how many
[1:00:02] spirits
[1:00:03] did john have
[1:00:07] so he have the holy ghost plus the
[1:00:10] spirit of elijah
[1:00:11] or the holy ghost was just the spirit of
[1:00:15] elijah
[1:00:18] are you there because john said in verse
[1:00:21] 7
[1:00:22] that the holy ghost was not given until
[1:00:25] jesus was
[1:00:26] glorified you there
[1:00:30] okay and he shall go before him
[1:00:33] in the spirit and power of elijah to
[1:00:36] turn the
[1:00:38] heart everybody clear of the
[1:00:41] father to the children and of the
[1:00:45] children to their fathers
[1:00:48] did you see that
[1:00:51] so when luke read
[1:00:55] malachi 4
[1:00:58] look read the father to the children
[1:01:03] karma and stop them and left this alone
[1:01:08] in other words luke was telling you that
[1:01:11] in malachi 4
[1:01:13] the only portion belonging to john the
[1:01:16] baptist
[1:01:17] is just this one why
[1:01:21] can john can look split the scripture
[1:01:26] [Laughter]
[1:01:28] to turn the heart of the father to the
[1:01:30] children
[1:01:32] and the disobedient those children were
[1:01:34] disobedient
[1:01:35] to the wisdom of the just one person
[1:01:40] not the justin plural one person christ
[1:01:43] faith are you there to make ready
[1:01:46] a people prepare for the lord
[1:01:50] because the lord is coming somebody must
[1:01:52] prepare the way
[1:01:54] isaiah 40 and malachi 3
[1:01:57] prepare you the way of the lord
[1:01:59] everybody clear
[1:02:00] now let's pray heavenly father
[1:02:04] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:02:06] for your love your mercy
[1:02:07] and for everything you're doing for us
[1:02:09] father we thank you for the song of zion
[1:02:12] that has been sung
[1:02:13] lord into your honor lord father lifting
[1:02:16] worshiping lord
[1:02:18] adoring the one who died and rose for us
[1:02:21] lord we are committing this service
[1:02:23] again and to the hand
[1:02:24] the people that are here presently and
[1:02:27] those on the telephone or
[1:02:29] online lord father following lord we ask
[1:02:32] that the holy spirit
[1:02:34] minister to each one of us this morning
[1:02:36] lord may you move me completely out of
[1:02:38] the way lord
[1:02:39] and may you seal the devil outside of
[1:02:42] this place
[1:02:43] may the power of the holy spirit drop
[1:02:45] down in this place
[1:02:46] open the chair lord father and may you
[1:02:49] give a specific
[1:02:50] revelation to your children lord for the
[1:02:52] glory of your own name
[1:02:54] lord we commit and ask everything in the
[1:02:57] name of jesus christ
[1:02:58] amen god bless you all we are in part
[1:03:02] 19. let's see if we're going to finish
[1:03:05] it
[1:03:06] if we finish it then we seal it i was
[1:03:08] about to close it here
[1:03:10] and it's a way it's a mysterious way the
[1:03:13] way god is working in this church
[1:03:16] there was a something that i wanted to
[1:03:20] leave
[1:03:20] and a brother sent me that question
[1:03:24] i was like wait a minute this is not
[1:03:26] true i told the brother it's the holy
[1:03:27] spirit telling me
[1:03:29] go back again and you got to deal with
[1:03:31] it so we're going to deal with
[1:03:32] that letter because people are attacking
[1:03:35] brother brown i'm saying that
[1:03:37] in revelation 10 7 there is an angel
[1:03:39] that sounds the trumpet
[1:03:41] and there is also another angel in
[1:03:43] revelation 11 that sound the trumpet
[1:03:45] and they say those trumpets are the same
[1:03:48] so
[1:03:48] revelation 10 belong to the jews
[1:03:52] so we gotta dig deeper and by going that
[1:03:55] we're gonna see who's that angel that
[1:03:58] john fell down
[1:03:59] and was about to worship
[1:04:02] i'm not gonna i can go with code but i'm
[1:04:04] gonna show you
[1:04:05] in the bible are you there
[1:04:08] now we're on part 19 dealing with blood
[1:04:11] branham
[1:04:12] all right when we dealt on part 18
[1:04:16] we found out that there were two
[1:04:18] dispensations right here
[1:04:20] and every dispensation was a church
[1:04:24] there was a jewish church that started
[1:04:26] with moses
[1:04:27] because what branham said when israel
[1:04:29] and the bible also say
[1:04:31] when israel was in egypt they were the
[1:04:33] people of god
[1:04:34] when they left egypt they became the
[1:04:36] church of god
[1:04:37] so there was a church that started with
[1:04:39] moses but that end
[1:04:42] that church at the end of it before the
[1:04:45] coming of the messiah
[1:04:46] elijah papa right there
[1:04:49] and then the second one was the second
[1:04:51] church which is the gentile church
[1:04:54] under the dispensation of grace that
[1:04:56] started also with paul
[1:04:58] and paul was our modern moses
[1:05:02] and we prove it to you and if you
[1:05:03] remember you will find out that
[1:05:06] moses when god was about to destroy
[1:05:08] israel
[1:05:09] moses stood in the gap and he told the
[1:05:12] lord that
[1:05:13] before you kill israel i want you to
[1:05:16] kill me
[1:05:17] and if you notice paul in the book of
[1:05:20] the new testament
[1:05:21] paul also said that i will hardly be a
[1:05:24] curse
[1:05:25] and let israel my brethren get in
[1:05:28] it was the same spirit that was upon
[1:05:30] moses
[1:05:31] that was handling paul so when the
[1:05:34] church started it started
[1:05:36] with moses which is paul and but at the
[1:05:38] end we found out that before
[1:05:40] the coming of the lord again we also
[1:05:43] deal with elijah the
[1:05:45] prophet now we found out that moses and
[1:05:48] paul
[1:05:48] both warned israel through the elders
[1:05:51] and we found out that through the elders
[1:05:54] was a spirit
[1:05:56] that entered into the church which is
[1:05:58] the spirit of
[1:05:59] nicoleton and we proved to you that
[1:06:02] nicoleten
[1:06:03] was the grievous wolf of paul and he
[1:06:07] also
[1:06:07] was called the white horse rather it was
[1:06:10] the same spirit
[1:06:12] and the different name on the different
[1:06:14] form are you there
[1:06:16] but before we get deeper into that let's
[1:06:19] observe or
[1:06:20] get into the spirit of the nucleated
[1:06:23] spirit
[1:06:24] everybody clear now the nicolet and
[1:06:27] spirit brother branham explained
[1:06:28] in the pergamos church ages that is
[1:06:31] started with the name
[1:06:33] the word elders and we found that when
[1:06:36] israel entered into the promised land
[1:06:39] the elders came to samuel and they
[1:06:42] taught samuel that your children
[1:06:43] are not behaving correctly so because
[1:06:46] your children are not behaving correctly
[1:06:49] we want you to give us a king like
[1:06:52] other nation and the thing displeased
[1:06:56] samuel because samuel was the prophet of
[1:06:59] the hour
[1:07:00] and god told samuel he said don't worry
[1:07:03] about it
[1:07:04] the mystery right here is whenever they
[1:07:07] reject
[1:07:08] a prophet that i have vindicated
[1:07:12] that i have confirmed that i have
[1:07:14] anointed
[1:07:16] that i am working with when you reject
[1:07:19] that prophet they are not rejecting
[1:07:22] demand prophet
[1:07:24] but they are rejecting god who send our
[1:07:27] prophet
[1:07:28] are you there in uh in john
[1:07:32] chapter 13 verse 20 the bible says
[1:07:35] verily
[1:07:36] verily i say unto you he that receiveth
[1:07:40] whomsoever i sent
[1:07:43] i will send you elijah the
[1:07:47] prophet so when god send a prophet
[1:07:51] when god sends somebody if you don't
[1:07:54] receive
[1:07:55] that person or if you reject that person
[1:07:59] who are you rejecting whoever whomsoever
[1:08:03] ascend receiveth me
[1:08:07] and he that receiveth me receive with
[1:08:10] him that
[1:08:11] send me in other words when god send a
[1:08:14] prophet
[1:08:15] if you receive that prophet you are
[1:08:18] actually receiving god
[1:08:24] luke 10 verse 18 16
[1:08:27] he that heareth you here with me
[1:08:31] so not only do we have to receive the
[1:08:34] prophet
[1:08:35] but we must listen to the prophet
[1:08:38] are you there in deuteronomy 18 18
[1:08:42] i will send you a prophet like unto
[1:08:45] moses
[1:08:45] you must hear him in my transfiguration
[1:08:50] the voice say
[1:08:51] hear ye him so when god send a prophet
[1:08:55] you must hear
[1:08:56] that prophet and he that despises you
[1:09:01] despises me that's why
[1:09:04] god say when they're rejecting samuel
[1:09:07] they are not rejecting samuel they are
[1:09:10] rejecting
[1:09:11] god because god is the one that sent
[1:09:14] samuel
[1:09:15] so you must receive samuel and you must
[1:09:18] listen to
[1:09:19] samuel in galatians chapter 4 verse 14
[1:09:23] the bible say paul say and my temptation
[1:09:26] which was in my flesh
[1:09:28] he despised not nor
[1:09:31] rejected they didn't look at the
[1:09:34] weakness of paul
[1:09:36] are you there to reject paul
[1:09:39] are you following me but to receive me
[1:09:42] as
[1:09:42] a ninja of god
[1:09:48] even as christ jesus
[1:09:54] so when you are receiving a prophet
[1:09:57] you are receiving jesus christ
[1:10:03] i have not touched the court yet
[1:10:08] romans 2 16 in the day
[1:10:12] that god shall judge the secret of men
[1:10:16] by
[1:10:17] jesus christ let's stop there
[1:10:20] take john
[1:10:25] before we continue the other part go to
[1:10:28] john chapter 5.
[1:10:33] people need to be taught
[1:10:41] people need to be taught we play too
[1:10:45] much
[1:10:48] john 5 22 are you there
[1:10:52] for the father judges no man
[1:10:56] no one but he has committed all judgment
[1:10:59] to them
[1:11:01] so the one who's going to judge you is
[1:11:04] jesus christ
[1:11:06] are you there but how is jesus christ
[1:11:10] going to judge you
[1:11:15] let's go back to roman when god subjects
[1:11:19] the secret of men by
[1:11:21] jesus christ we clear now right
[1:11:24] according to my gospel
[1:11:30] so when jesus judges you he's gonna
[1:11:33] judge you
[1:11:34] according to the message of your hour
[1:11:41] are you there those that were under
[1:11:44] power
[1:11:45] gonna be judged according to what paul
[1:11:47] preached
[1:11:49] those that were under martin gonna be
[1:11:52] judged according to what martin preached
[1:11:54] and these on this end time are gonna be
[1:11:57] judged
[1:11:58] according to the gospel of the end time
[1:12:01] which is the message of the hour
[1:12:10] in the message the rapture brother
[1:12:12] branham say
[1:12:13] one day there will come a blast from
[1:12:16] heaven
[1:12:18] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:12:21] them
[1:12:21] old testament sent back yonder who are
[1:12:24] waiting
[1:12:25] will blast forth and come out of their
[1:12:28] first and go into the resurrection
[1:12:32] so the old testament sin will come out
[1:12:35] and they will
[1:12:36] be ahead of us and we're going to be
[1:12:38] behind following them
[1:12:39] marching going to heaven everybody here
[1:12:42] we will get to those rapture down the
[1:12:44] road we shall drop right in line
[1:12:47] this is what brother branham said that's
[1:12:49] why they say he comes with a cloud
[1:12:51] that cloud is the old testament then you
[1:12:53] need to understand what clouds mean
[1:12:56] the bible is all written in symbols
[1:12:59] are you there going into the sky these
[1:13:03] old mortal body
[1:13:04] changed and made like unto his own
[1:13:07] glorious
[1:13:08] body what a parade that shall be
[1:13:11] when he starts heavenward so we are
[1:13:13] going toward heaven
[1:13:15] some of this day in the rupturing time
[1:13:17] that lays ahead
[1:13:19] oh proudly displaying
[1:13:24] the blood of jesus christ upon their
[1:13:27] chest so brother branham said when we

[1:14:12] you're gonna be judged according to the
[1:14:15] gospel of your messenger

[1:16:01] jesus will judge you first but the
[1:16:04] mysteries
[1:16:05] you have been already approved

[1:16:18] approved past this way
[1:16:20] already approved patch this way already
[1:16:23] approved patch this way
[1:16:26] you need a message that is confirmed and
[1:16:29] approved
[1:16:31] are you there they don't need you don't
[1:16:33] need to remove your shoe
[1:16:36] you don't need to remove your belt when
[1:16:38] you get there when you say malachi 4
[1:16:40] they say
[1:16:41] the angel just got this
[1:16:49] hallelujah praise
[1:16:53] the lord displaying the blood of jesus
[1:16:56] upon their
[1:16:58] shares the message of god in the hour
[1:17:00] that they're
[1:17:01] living hallelujah
[1:17:04] well now this spirit of the nicolaitan
[1:17:09] brother branham said on the first season
[1:17:12] in the early church ages we shall gather
[1:17:16] after a while a doctrine
[1:17:19] then it becomes a saying first so this
[1:17:23] spirit
[1:17:24] started as a saying
[1:17:29] then after saying it turned into a
[1:17:32] doctrine
[1:17:35] after doctrine it became a statute
[1:17:40] after statute it became a church
[1:17:44] and took that church through the dark
[1:17:47] ages
[1:17:48] in other words this spirit immorphy
[1:17:53] this spirit progresses and
[1:17:57] as he progressed he get more
[1:18:00] solid and change forms
[1:18:04] are we following me are you following me
[1:18:07] praise the lord
[1:18:08] brother madam said this the first thing
[1:18:10] he is
[1:18:11] he's an antichrist spirit john said so
[1:18:15] little children the spirit of the
[1:18:17] antichrist already working in the
[1:18:18] children of disobedience
[1:18:20] see that thing had begun to start
[1:18:24] just the spirit then he became kind of a
[1:18:27] saying
[1:18:28] in the next churches and the next church
[1:18:31] is it was a
[1:18:32] doctrine and the next church said that
[1:18:35] she was
[1:18:36] crowned so it was incarnated
[1:18:39] into a person are you there so
[1:18:43] when moses started
[1:18:46] in the desert we found a rebellion
[1:18:50] open up of korra
[1:18:54] deaton and abram that was the beginning
[1:18:58] of the nicolette and spirit
[1:19:01] are you there praise the lord
[1:19:05] what did cora look at quora
[1:19:09] in the days when god sent moses sent
[1:19:13] sent sent moses with the
[1:19:17] message and quran death and thought
[1:19:21] come up to moses and say now wait just a
[1:19:24] minute
[1:19:25] you take too much on yourself
[1:19:30] in other words when god send moses with
[1:19:33] a message
[1:19:35] moses always come and say the lord god
[1:19:38] spoke
[1:19:40] before you leave israel all of you
[1:19:42] behind me
[1:19:44] if you don't do what i tell you the
[1:19:47] defensive will kill you
[1:19:49] it looks like moses elevate himself
[1:19:53] above everybody it looked like
[1:19:56] moses only put himself on the picture
[1:20:00] and removed everybody else
[1:20:03] and when core are in debt and look they
[1:20:05] say wait a minute
[1:20:06] moses you make yourself like you are
[1:20:10] higher than all the preachers
[1:20:15] the rebellion of quran
[1:20:18] dayton and abraham is a rebellion
[1:20:22] against the messenger of god
[1:20:26] thinking that the messenger of god
[1:20:29] makes himself above everybody
[1:20:37] you think you are the only people on the
[1:20:39] beach
[1:20:40] the duck in the pablo you are the only
[1:20:43] one
[1:20:44] i let you know there is other people are
[1:20:47] holy too
[1:20:48] brother brother is just as much as a
[1:20:51] preacher or
[1:20:52] anybody else preaching
[1:20:57] no brother branham is not like
[1:21:00] any other preacher moses
[1:21:04] is a leaver do you know that
[1:21:07] and they were leaving working in the
[1:21:09] temple
[1:21:10] but moses was above delivered
[1:21:14] are you there but korra came he said
[1:21:17] moses
[1:21:18] you taking too much on yourself
[1:21:22] everybody must listen to your tips
[1:21:26] everybody must listen to your books
[1:21:29] they must read them the people who are
[1:21:31] not following you won't die
[1:21:34] no moses you are not the only one
[1:21:37] somehow the preacher
[1:21:39] are just like you
[1:21:45] moses didn't say they was not holy
[1:21:48] he never said they were not good
[1:21:49] preachers
[1:21:51] he said billy graham have the holy ghost
[1:21:54] he said oral robber have the holy ghost
[1:21:57] he remember hey allen
[1:22:02] but he had the commission
[1:22:06] he had to carry out and they only
[1:22:09] as a group and was against
[1:22:12] moses job down here
[1:22:17] as fundamental as he was they failed to
[1:22:20] recognize
[1:22:21] the message so the spirit
[1:22:25] of quran the rebellions of korah
[1:22:29] dayton and abiram is a rebellion
[1:22:33] against the messenger of the hour
[1:22:37] and their claim is you are elevating
[1:22:40] one man above everybody else
[1:22:44] while he is just like any other man
[1:22:49] we clear
[1:22:52] let's go ahead and quora that mean
[1:22:56] we will have the word once again as he
[1:22:59] was
[1:22:59] perfectly given and perfectly understood
[1:23:03] in the days of paul i will tell you who
[1:23:06] will have it
[1:23:07] it will be a prophet as totally
[1:23:11] vindicated
[1:23:12] or even more thoroughly
[1:23:15] vindicated than was any prophet
[1:23:18] in all ages from enoch to this day
[1:23:24] that's why when miriam and aaron
[1:23:27] begin to gossip about moses
[1:23:31] god said come here
[1:23:34] god said you know i had many prophets
[1:23:38] he said abraham was a prophet he said
[1:23:42] noah
[1:23:42] was a prophet he said i have many
[1:23:45] prophets
[1:23:46] but moses is different
[1:23:50] when i talk to those prophets i usually
[1:23:53] fail myself
[1:23:56] are you there but when i talk to moses
[1:24:01] if i'm if i am in the pillar of fire
[1:24:04] i usually get out to the pillar of fire
[1:24:07] and me and moses stuck face to face
[1:24:13] are you there so moses is not like
[1:24:17] everybody
[1:24:22] because this man who have necessity
[1:24:26] have the capstone prophetic ministry
[1:24:29] we're moving all right
[1:24:32] see hoarding sensors this is core and
[1:24:35] data
[1:24:36] fire burning sweet smelling silver
[1:24:39] before god
[1:24:40] and those hand-holding that yet perish
[1:24:44] with the censor in the hand
[1:24:47] ministers anointed men they can preach
[1:24:50] the word fine
[1:24:52] but yet they died why
[1:24:56] because they were trying to do
[1:24:59] something in sincerity yet
[1:25:03] against the word of god
[1:25:07] trying to make an organization say
[1:25:11] you take too much upon yourself
[1:25:15] who are you to say that you get all the
[1:25:18] word off
[1:25:20] amen so cora say
[1:25:24] who are you to tell us that in this
[1:25:27] entire
[1:25:28] generation here you are the only one
[1:25:31] that have the entire word of god
[1:25:34] who are you who are you
[1:25:37] so korra could not stand god
[1:25:40] working with one man and that one man
[1:25:44] have the monopoly of the entire world
[1:25:52] they fell to see that moses was the
[1:25:55] messenger of that hour
[1:25:57] see he said that saved the lord there
[1:26:00] was nobody on earth like him
[1:26:03] he had the message and the people failed
[1:26:05] to cease
[1:26:06] and moses was exactly with that safety
[1:26:10] lord so when that rebellion finished
[1:26:14] god opened the earth and killed those
[1:26:17] people
[1:26:18] you thought it was done that
[1:26:22] rebellion immortal into something else
[1:26:27] because spirit don't die
[1:26:31] when he morphs into something else
[1:26:35] he produce bellum
[1:26:40] okay what is wrong with berlin
[1:26:44] why do you say that the nicolaitan
[1:26:47] becomes balanced and god
[1:26:50] said the deed of the nicolette
[1:26:54] which was in the ephesians
[1:26:58] over in the little church of pergamos
[1:27:00] became
[1:27:01] her doctrine remember right here are you
[1:27:04] there
[1:27:05] and said he was adoption off
[1:27:08] so balaam was the rebellion
[1:27:12] of korah in murphy
[1:27:18] and balaam was the one who taught israel
[1:27:21] to go over there and commit formidation
[1:27:25] or the committed fornication with moab
[1:27:28] which was a lukewarm church member
[1:27:32] cora is against the messenger
[1:27:36] are you there belem is against
[1:27:40] the congregation
[1:27:43] cora says you are no different than any
[1:27:47] other
[1:27:47] preacher then say
[1:27:51] the congregation of israel is not
[1:27:54] different
[1:27:55] than any other congregation
[1:27:58] that's why you can marry between the
[1:28:01] moabite
[1:28:03] and the children of israel
[1:28:07] the message said no cora said
[1:28:11] no we have a fanaticism in this message
[1:28:16] we make ourselves too special
[1:28:19] god uses baptism god uses methodism
[1:28:24] god uses pentecostal they are all
[1:28:27] brothers and sisters you can go ahead
[1:28:30] and mingle together
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] are you following
[1:28:38] now watch this doctrine of berlin
[1:28:40] believe most carefully
[1:28:42] notice above all that it is the
[1:28:44] deliberate
[1:28:45] maneuver of a corrupt clergy
[1:28:48] it's the preachers to bind their people
[1:28:52] to them
[1:28:53] by leading the people deliberately
[1:28:57] into the sin of unbelief
[1:29:00] so when that spirit take the form of
[1:29:03] belem it will first
[1:29:06] attack the congregation but it will lead
[1:29:10] you
[1:29:10] slowly to disbelieve
[1:29:14] the message of the hour
[1:29:22] the nicolet and doctrine was the
[1:29:25] corruption of the clergy
[1:29:27] still courageous as they thought
[1:29:30] political power among themselves
[1:29:32] while balanis is the subjection of the
[1:29:36] people
[1:29:36] to their system of creed and worship
[1:29:40] in order to hold them how do they hold
[1:29:43] them
[1:29:44] now watch this carefully what was
[1:29:47] what was it that bound the people
[1:29:50] to a nominal church and thereby destroy
[1:29:53] them
[1:29:54] in other words what did belem use
[1:29:57] to lock israel and destroy him
[1:30:01] are you there it was the creeds
[1:30:04] and dogma form into the church tenet
[1:30:08] it was the doctrine of the roman
[1:30:10] catholic church
[1:30:12] watch this they were not given
[1:30:16] the true food the word
[1:30:20] so balaam will begin to remove
[1:30:24] the word slowly from the church
[1:30:28] are you there when it's a quora it's
[1:30:32] attacking the messenger when he turned
[1:30:35] into the form of belem
[1:30:37] he will begin to remove the message of
[1:30:40] the hour
[1:30:41] slowly away from the people
[1:30:44] leading them to unbelief
[1:30:50] you were playing tapes they removed the
[1:30:53] tips
[1:30:54] we were reading coats they removed the
[1:30:56] coats
[1:30:58] it's the second stage are you there
[1:31:02] now i want you to watch the trickery of
[1:31:05] the devil
[1:31:08] moab said or bellick
[1:31:11] so when berlin work the system of
[1:31:14] bellum is always connected to belak
[1:31:21] balaam was the prophet and balaam was
[1:31:25] the king
[1:31:28] now why do you say that

[1:32:35] people no problem
[1:32:37] bella say don't go there

[1:32:58] amen
[1:33:02] he didn't show him the overall picture
[1:33:06] he doesn't show that people in the
[1:33:08] message are serious
[1:33:10] people in the message dress well people
[1:33:13] in the message worship
[1:33:14] god people in the message are very good

[1:33:37] struggling
[1:33:39] that was come along the poor ship
[1:33:42] and the goat he just showed him the
[1:33:44] other most part
[1:33:46] now set seal think really hard
[1:33:50] may the holy spirit take this now and
[1:33:52] place it right in your heart
[1:33:54] every one of you i wonder if
[1:33:58] our pastors have not just showed us
[1:34:01] the worst part
[1:34:08] i'm reading to you brother branham are
[1:34:10] you there
[1:34:12] i would just wonder if we have not
[1:34:15] why look at their carrying on i know
[1:34:18] they get off track
[1:34:19] that's right israel commits error
[1:34:21] sometimes
[1:34:22] that's right the mentor this does too
[1:34:27] if i take you right now and show you
[1:34:30] what is on youtube
[1:34:32] in the pentecostal world you won't
[1:34:34] reject the bible
[1:34:37] they have pastor working on people
[1:34:40] no problem they have preached molesting
[1:34:44] kids here
[1:34:45] no problem but when they get to the
[1:34:48] message
[1:34:49] they find out that it's perfect they
[1:34:51] begin to look they little tiny fault
[1:34:58] the methodist does too the free method
[1:35:01] is
[1:35:01] they say look at that bunch of rolly
[1:35:04] rolling pilgrim of loneliness that's the
[1:35:06] same thing
[1:35:07] you nazaring the same thing you are
[1:35:09] called holy rolling
[1:35:10] the pentecostal and all the rest of them
[1:35:13] what are you talking
[1:35:14] about brother brother now watch bella
[1:35:16] the king
[1:35:17] took him back and show him the act much
[1:35:20] part of israel
[1:35:21] the hindu part of israel is that true
[1:35:24] you bubble readers
[1:35:25] the utmost part the worst part he didn't
[1:35:28] want him to see this part
[1:35:30] he showed him the utmost part i wonder a
[1:35:33] lot of time
[1:35:34] if people who call us fanatics and out
[1:35:38] of her head
[1:35:39] and thinks if they are not just trying
[1:35:42] to point the worst
[1:35:43] part there is too many fanaticism in
[1:35:48] this message
[1:35:49] they are just trying to point you the
[1:35:51] worst part
[1:35:54] you know there was a preacher over there
[1:35:56] we found him with three women
[1:35:58] they are just trying to point to the
[1:36:00] worst part
[1:36:03] are you there he said i know
[1:36:07] they say i know holy holy preacher that
[1:36:09] run away with another menswear
[1:36:11] and i know a lot of baptists and
[1:36:14] presbyterians don't the same
[1:36:16] thing if you are attacking the message
[1:36:20] because of that
[1:36:21] you might as well attack everybody else
[1:36:25] are you there you are but you are big
[1:36:29] enough to keep it
[1:36:30] hush so when the priest molested the
[1:36:34] children the catholics knows how to
[1:36:37] clean it up
[1:36:39] we don't know how to clean it up if it's
[1:36:42] a mess it's a mess
[1:36:44] but bella could say use that one
[1:36:47] and weaken the camp of israel by their
[1:36:52] worst part are you there
[1:36:56] after that doctrine what does balaam do
[1:37:01] this second step was the doctrine of
[1:37:03] balaam
[1:37:04] described in revelation 2 14 where in
[1:37:06] berlin thought berlick
[1:37:08] to stumble the children of israel by a
[1:37:11] united
[1:37:12] meeting so first of all berlin will
[1:37:16] teach you
[1:37:16] that you are not different than any
[1:37:18] denomination
[1:37:21] number two he will insist on the
[1:37:24] people in your camp that do things that
[1:37:28] are contrary
[1:37:29] to the word of god are you there
[1:37:32] then once he get that succeeded
[1:37:35] he's going to organize a meeting
[1:37:38] to crowd everybody
[1:37:42] what do you organize the meeting vellum
[1:37:47] there the guests will go two more things
[1:37:50] contrary to the world
[1:37:52] it was first of all the meeting to
[1:37:56] suggest
[1:37:56] that they all get together and talk
[1:38:00] things over
[1:38:03] are you following me in other words we
[1:38:05] need to call
[1:38:06] the preachers of the message let's sit
[1:38:10] and review the message a little bit
[1:38:15] talk things over eat together
[1:38:18] and get things ironed up
[1:38:21] we need to recalibrate some of our
[1:38:24] teaching
[1:38:26] are you there after all understanding
[1:38:29] each
[1:38:30] other goes a long way once you
[1:38:32] accomplish
[1:38:33] that you can go from there the next step
[1:38:37] you will be worshiping together
[1:38:39] and of course a little pressure from the
[1:38:41] host usually makes the guests go
[1:38:44] a lot further than their intended so
[1:38:47] he will organize a meeting to review
[1:38:51] the message of the hour
[1:38:56] what are you going where are you going
[1:38:59] when any religious people embrace
[1:39:03] buff nucleation are you there
[1:39:07] and balance me are you there
[1:39:11] and have the political financial
[1:39:15] and physical power to back it up
[1:39:18] there is only one direction they can go
[1:39:22] so brother branham say once you swallow
[1:39:25] nicole attend
[1:39:29] nicolette and make a way for berlin
[1:39:34] are you there once you swallow bellamy
[1:39:40] your third step is going somewhere
[1:39:43] remember it's the same spirit in folding
[1:39:46] everybody clear there is only one
[1:39:49] direction they go
[1:39:51] that direction is right in the jezebel
[1:39:57] are you there
[1:40:02] jezebel murder delivered let's move on
[1:40:06] once you leave nicolette
[1:40:10] he makes a way for bellamy better make a
[1:40:13] way
[1:40:14] for jezebel what does jezebel do
[1:40:20] now woman what did we find that women
[1:40:22] represent last night
[1:40:24] the church now we found out here that
[1:40:27] they were called
[1:40:28] nicolette everybody see that
[1:40:32] come on doctrine of berlin second stage
[1:40:36] everybody there come on and now it
[1:40:38] becomes
[1:40:41] everybody following me now they said
[1:40:44] that this church then was a prophet
[1:40:46] now remember he changed from disney
[1:40:49] nicolette
[1:40:49] now it changed over into her
[1:40:53] you see a jezebel last night was the
[1:40:56] doctrine of berlin
[1:40:57] see the adoption of nicoleton and the
[1:41:00] doctrine of belem
[1:41:01] now belem was the one who made boredom
[1:41:04] with israel and what did the nicolette
[1:41:07] do
[1:41:07] made the organization so put them both
[1:41:10] together
[1:41:11] and you got her i want
[1:41:14] the church jezebel are you there
[1:41:16] revelation 17
[1:41:18] the great everybody there
[1:41:21] she is committing fornication spiritual
[1:41:24] fornication
[1:41:26] misinterpreting the world to the
[1:41:29] people so once you are swallowing this
[1:41:34] and you swallow this all the medically
[1:41:37] the clergy
[1:41:38] begin to misinterpret the world
[1:41:42] going slowly that will
[1:41:46] open up the way to the second seal
[1:41:49] now jezebel can begin to kill
[1:41:52] the people it's a funeral home
[1:41:58] you got it now
[1:42:02] so then jezebel when she got in there
[1:42:05] she stomped that little high heel shoe
[1:42:09] she was wearing it so once
[1:42:13] you enter jezebel you open
[1:42:16] a door to worthiness into the church
[1:42:21] make up enter into the church high heel
[1:42:25] you gather enter into the church
[1:42:28] and it's death a funeral
[1:42:31] home open going slowly
[1:42:37] 60 jezebel hated
[1:42:40] her pastor we found out that the seven
[1:42:44] messenger were
[1:42:46] pastor he will bring the spirit
[1:42:50] that the clergy begin to hit
[1:42:54] the messenger of the hour
[1:42:58] are you there are you there it's now a
[1:43:02] hatred that a stage of
[1:43:05] jezebel here it was just an attack
[1:43:10] here he prepares something once he hits
[1:43:13] jezebel it is not playing games
[1:43:16] it is killing the people spiritually
[1:43:21] destroying them separating brother
[1:43:23] bonham said death means
[1:43:25] a total separation he's separating the
[1:43:28] people from the message
[1:43:30] without game
[1:43:38] once nicoletten started
[1:43:41] he make a way to pelham berlin make a
[1:43:45] way to
[1:43:46] jezebel once you see jezebel
[1:43:51] watch out in the in the
[1:43:54] horizon elijah is coming
[1:44:04] i want that to be soaked in are you
[1:44:08] there
[1:44:09] jezebel is the one that called for
[1:44:13] elijah
[1:44:19] jezebel hated
[1:44:22] elijah that voice
[1:44:25] said this is perfect love
[1:44:29] what a great and everything that you
[1:44:31] ever love
[1:44:33] and everything that ever loves you
[1:44:38] is here with you now
[1:44:42] jezebel wants you to hate
[1:44:45] the messenger the voice
[1:44:48] say love the messenger
[1:44:55] you shall present us to the lord jesus
[1:44:57] when he comes as trophy of your
[1:45:01] brother brother say my people there

[1:45:44] and you are bringing your tradition
[1:45:47] making the word of god
[1:45:49] of no effect when that stage

[1:59:52] 12 foundation in them
[1:59:57] the name of the twelve who so
[2:00:00] the foundation of the bread and what
[2:00:03] apostle jesus was
[2:00:07] an apostle paul was an apostle
[2:00:11] this bread the foundation is an apostle
[2:00:15] so these fathers are
[2:00:24] apostles
[2:00:26] did jesus leave the faith
[2:00:29] who led the foundation
[2:00:32] have paul left the faith
[2:00:36] take second timothy chapter four
[2:00:42] it's for the jews it's for the jews it's
[2:00:44] for the jews
[2:00:48] second timothy chapter four everybody
[2:00:51] okay
[2:00:52] if you tired you let me know
[2:00:55] second timothy chapter four if you dare
[2:00:58] you can say amen
[2:01:00] verse six paul is about to die he said
[2:01:03] for i am now ready to be offered
[2:01:06] and the time of my another boy paul is
[2:01:10] saying that i'm about to die
[2:01:11] i'm gonna go the time of my departure is
[2:01:14] head
[2:01:14] hand i have fought a good
[2:01:19] fight i have finished mine
[2:01:22] i have kept thee
[2:01:26] it follows faith that's why
[2:01:30] they can turn the children back to
[2:01:34] the father the father out there apostle
[2:01:38] that's why brother branham always say
[2:01:41] growing to the faith of
[2:01:42] the apostle go into the faith of the
[2:01:45] apostle hey brother brother i'll never
[2:01:47] explain you this
[2:01:49] what i'm trying to say is i'm not
[2:01:51] greater than brother venom
[2:01:53] what i'm trying to say is when brother
[2:01:55] branham says something
[2:01:57] even his concept is always lined up with
[2:02:01] the scripture
[2:02:02] even though he didn't give you the
[2:02:04] scripture
[2:02:06] so when they give you a quote you say
[2:02:08] amen
[2:02:09] what we have a problem is the
[2:02:11] explanation of the code
[2:02:15] if you leave the code alone amen i don't
[2:02:18] want your explanation
[2:02:20] just repeat it like he was given
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:25] are you there that's why he always said
[2:02:28] we need to go back to the faith of the
[2:02:30] apostolic father
[2:02:31] apostolic apostolic why because the
[2:02:34] father were there
[2:02:37] but now who are the children
[2:02:41] we ready we know in the book of
[2:02:44] revelation
[2:02:44] with this picture that jesus christ was
[2:02:47] found
[2:02:48] outside the the the church knocking
[2:02:52] trying to go
[2:02:54] and jesus before he died he asked a
[2:02:56] question he said
[2:02:58] when the son of man shall come shall he
[2:03:01] find
[2:03:03] do you see them jesus knew that at the
[2:03:06] end of the church
[2:03:08] he's going to be kicked out are you
[2:03:11] there
[2:03:12] there won't be any faith so once you
[2:03:15] reach that stage
[2:03:16] nicolette bellum
[2:03:20] jezebel the faith will be completely
[2:03:23] destroyed
[2:03:24] and jesus will be outside
[2:03:27] must come
[2:03:28] [Applause]
[2:03:31] are we now are we together now who are
[2:03:34] these children
[2:03:35] take roman eight
[2:03:41] does malachi 4 belong to the jews
[2:03:52] roman 8 if you dare you can say amen
[2:03:55] verse 14
[2:03:57] for as many as are led by
[2:04:02] the spirit of god they are there
[2:04:06] everybody follow me for you have not
[2:04:09] received the spirit of bondage again
[2:04:12] to fear but you have received the spirit
[2:04:15] of what
[2:04:18] is god going to adopt israel
[2:04:22] israel were god's children
[2:04:25] you are adopting a child that is not
[2:04:28] yours
[2:04:31] are you there at the spirit of adoption
[2:04:34] whereby we cry
[2:04:36] our father everybody there
[2:04:40] verse 16 the spirit itself bear witness
[2:04:43] with our spirit
[2:04:44] that we are
[2:04:47] who are those children children of god
[2:04:51] and if children then health
[2:04:55] health of god and jordan with christ
[2:04:59] everybody clear so far jump to verse 29.
[2:05:06] whom he did for no he also did
[2:05:09] predestinated
[2:05:10] to be conformed to the image of his son
[2:05:13] that he might be the firstborn among
[2:05:15] many
[2:05:17] so jesus have brethren
[2:05:21] i'm not gonna we are joint head i'm not
[2:05:23] gonna dig that too deep
[2:05:25] let's go to roman nine the next chapter
[2:05:28] we're trying to see who is the children
[2:05:30] but we saw here that the children are
[2:05:32] led by
[2:05:32] the spirit of god okay when we say the
[2:05:36] children of god it's the jews it's the
[2:05:37] jews
[2:05:38] now paul is saying something else the
[2:05:40] children are those that have the holy
[2:05:42] ghost
[2:05:43] but let's see clearly i don't want to
[2:05:45] say brother stephen say
[2:05:46] roman 9 chapter 6 if you dare you can
[2:05:49] say amen
[2:05:51] not as though the word of god has taken
[2:05:53] non-effect
[2:05:54] for they are not all
[2:05:57] which are off paul is saying that
[2:06:01] not everybody that is a jew
[2:06:04] is israel what are you talking about for
[2:06:08] what are you talking about are you there
[2:06:11] verse seven
[2:06:12] neither because they are the seed of
[2:06:15] abraham
[2:06:16] it's not because they are jew by blood
[2:06:19] are you there are there are
[2:06:22] children but in isaac
[2:06:25] shall your seed be called verse 8
[2:06:29] that is then which are children of the
[2:06:32] flesh
[2:06:33] these are not
[2:06:37] the children of god it's not the jews
[2:06:41] everybody's seen that we're trying to
[2:06:43] find who's the children
[2:06:44] so when we talk about children remove
[2:06:46] them the jews
[2:06:48] at the beginning of the church ages
[2:06:51] in ephesus jews who are there
[2:06:55] remember the church started in jerusalem
[2:06:59] smyrna jews were there pergamos jews
[2:07:02] begin to go
[2:07:03] by the time of tartarian jews finished
[2:07:06] luther no more jews westland no more
[2:07:10] jews
[2:07:10] pentecost no more jews
[2:07:14] so this is a time where god deals only
[2:07:17] with
[2:07:17] gender pure are you understanding now
[2:07:21] now verse 9 and the eighteen
[2:07:24] oh my god verse 8 these are not the
[2:07:27] children of god
[2:07:29] but the children of the promise are
[2:07:31] counted by
[2:07:32] for seed that promise we know it's faith
[2:07:36] everybody there jump now to verse 24.
[2:07:40] now you yourself are going to see those
[2:07:42] children are you there
[2:07:44] even who us
[2:07:47] whom he has called not after
[2:07:54] did you see that again he's removing the
[2:07:57] jews
[2:07:57] okay not only the jews only but also
[2:08:00] over there
[2:08:02] so the children are who
[2:08:07] did you see that of the gentile
[2:08:10] watch verse 25 as he said also in hosea
[2:08:15] i will call them my people who was the
[2:08:18] people of god
[2:08:20] it was the children of israel are you
[2:08:22] there
[2:08:23] but god is saying that i will call this
[2:08:25] one my people
[2:08:27] israel rejected me they used to be my
[2:08:30] people
[2:08:31] but now i'm calling someone else my
[2:08:33] people
[2:08:34] do you see that i will condemn my people
[2:08:38] and help her a woman
[2:08:41] her beloved which was not
[2:08:46] remembering the song of solomon there
[2:08:49] beloved
[2:08:50] you remember but i'm calling somebody
[2:08:53] who
[2:08:53] a shoulder might not a jew
[2:08:58] are you there who is not beloved and he
[2:09:01] shall come to pass that in the place
[2:09:04] where he was saying to them you are not
[2:09:06] my people because we were gentile
[2:09:09] they shall be called there
[2:09:16] who are the children elijah
[2:09:19] it's going to be who
[2:09:23] everybody clear you say brother stephen
[2:09:26] the children
[2:09:27] are the jews because elijah will preach
[2:09:31] to 144 000 right
[2:09:34] take revelation 7.

[2:09:39] let me know
[2:09:41] everybody there revelation chapter 7
[2:09:45] bear with me if you tired you tell me we
[2:09:48] stop here we continue another time

[2:09:57] sea
[2:09:58] nor the tree till we have still there
[2:10:04] till we have still there children of god
[2:10:08] the jews now are servants that's why
[2:10:14] jesus said
[2:10:15] i will not call you servant he was
[2:10:19] talking to the
[2:10:20] jews are you there
[2:10:23] the servant of god in the forehead
[2:10:27] everybody there verse four and i heard
[2:10:30] the number of them which were sealed
[2:10:32] and they were still a hundred and forty
[2:10:35] four thousand of order
[2:10:38] of the children of what so the children
[2:10:41] of
[2:10:41] israel the hundred and forty four
[2:10:44] thousand
[2:10:44] that are gonna be preached by elijah are
[2:10:47] not
[2:10:48] children they are servants the bible
[2:10:58] not code do you see code here
[2:11:03] where are we going with us now we
[2:11:05] understand now
[2:11:07] that the jews to christ but the
[2:11:10] children the gentiles because they're
[2:11:13] going to kick
[2:11:14] jesus outside of the earth the word
[2:11:17] church
[2:11:18] god have to send elijah to return their
[2:11:22] heart
[2:11:22] back to the heart of the apostle
[2:11:26] and in revelation in my in malachi
[2:11:29] 4 when luke looked at that look split
[2:11:33] this into
[2:11:35] are you there luke say this is john
[2:11:38] this one he never say anything because
[2:11:41] the seventh seal usually is
[2:11:47] are you there when the devil knew
[2:11:50] that are you deliberate a liberator will
[2:11:53] be born
[2:11:55] in the time of moses do you know what he
[2:11:57] did he began to kill children
[2:12:00] he didn't know who moses was if
[2:12:03] he knew he would go straight ahead and
[2:12:05] destroy him
[2:12:06] in the time of jesus christ when he
[2:12:10] knew that the messiah wanna come he
[2:12:12] begin to destroy
[2:12:13] thinking that by destroying by bringing
[2:12:16] that coronavirus
[2:12:18] maybe i'm gonna get him
[2:12:21] are you there but the problem is moses
[2:12:24] was still
[2:12:25] in the seventies jesus was still
[2:12:29] in the seventies the name of the
[2:12:31] messenger was still
[2:12:33] under the seventh seal
[2:12:36] are you there now why did they split it
[2:12:42] take isaiah 61. bear with me
[2:12:45] i'm sorry we want to land down this
[2:12:48] plane
[2:12:53] isaiah 61 are you there
[2:12:58] oh praise the lord first one the spirit
[2:13:02] of the lord is upon me
[2:13:05] because he has anointed me to preach
[2:13:07] good tithing to the men
[2:13:09] he has sent me to bind the brokenhearted
[2:13:12] to proclaim
[2:13:13] liberty to the captive and to open
[2:13:16] the opening of the prison to them that
[2:13:18] are banned to proclaim the acceptable
[2:13:21] year of the
[2:13:22] lord so we see here to proclaim to free
[2:13:25] this to free this to free this
[2:13:27] the prophet is anointed he's giving one
[2:13:29] prophecy
[2:13:30] are you following me and the day of
[2:13:33] vengeance
[2:13:34] of our god to comfort all the moon
[2:13:38] so isaiah is prophesying that when the
[2:13:40] messiah come
[2:13:41] he would do this this jubilee acceptable
[2:13:44] year heal the brokenhearted and the day
[2:13:46] of vengeance
[2:13:47] so all we know is when the messiah comes
[2:13:49] he will come and do all of this
[2:13:52] right go to luke chapter four let's see
[2:13:56] now this prophecy
[2:14:05] this is a principle you need to learn in
[2:14:07] the world
[2:14:08] look for verse 18. jesus got into the
[2:14:12] temple
[2:14:13] and he took the scroll and begin to read
[2:14:16] this scripture okay
[2:14:19] all right the spirit of the lord is upon
[2:14:22] me you see what we just read
[2:14:25] because he has anointed me to preach the
[2:14:27] gospel to the poor did we hear that
[2:14:29] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[2:14:32] did we hear that
[2:14:34] to preach deliverance to the captives
[2:14:36] did we hear that
[2:14:38] and to recover the sight of the blind
[2:14:40] did we hear that
[2:14:41] and to set liberty to them that are
[2:14:43] bruised did we hear that
[2:14:45] 19 to preach the acceptable year of the
[2:14:48] lord did we hear that
[2:14:49] verse 20 look and to preach and the day
[2:14:53] of vengeance
[2:14:56] do you see that why did jesus stop in
[2:14:59] the middle
[2:15:04] why did luke stop in the middle
[2:15:10] why didn't jesus continue isaiah didn't
[2:15:13] preach
[2:15:13] didn't prophesy and stop no isaiah was
[2:15:16] prophesying everything boom boom boom
[2:15:18] boom boom boom
[2:15:18] jesus was waiting and he stopped why did
[2:15:22] jesus stop
[2:15:26] and we know how peculiar that scripture
[2:15:28] reading
[2:15:29] because he just took a portion of the
[2:15:33] first and second verse of isaiah 61
[2:15:36] 1 i just read to you and two
[2:15:39] but he went down this far where the
[2:15:42] spirit of the lord is upon me to bind up
[2:15:44] the broken rather
[2:15:45] to give heal to the sick to open the
[2:15:47] blind eye to preach the acceptable year
[2:15:49] and then he
[2:15:51] stopped for the next
[2:15:54] was to bring judgment that would apply
[2:15:58] to his
[2:16:01] second coming note is so one
[2:16:04] looks up here look what's telling you
[2:16:07] this part belongs to the first coming
[2:16:11] this one belong to the second coming
[2:16:20] all right let's finish now and drop that
[2:16:22] you ready
[2:16:24] let's go matthew chapter one chapter 11.
[2:16:32] i'm sorry let's line down
[2:16:35] and then sooner we're going to start a
[2:16:37] new series
[2:16:39] on the two stave of the ark of the
[2:16:41] covenant
[2:16:44] are you there because when they were
[2:16:46] carrying the ark they were carrying that
[2:16:48] on this table
[2:16:49] who are the what are those staves
[2:16:55] are you ready matthew chapter 11 verse
[2:16:58] 13 and 14
[2:17:01] if you dare for all the prophet and the
[2:17:05] law prophesies until
[2:17:08] and if you receive it this is elijah
[2:17:10] which was
[2:17:11] for two so in matthew 11 jesus is
[2:17:14] telling us that john the baptist is who
[2:17:17] elijah they asked jesus
[2:17:20] jesus asked a question actually who did
[2:17:22] you see over there
[2:17:24] who did you see preaching this one says
[2:17:25] he said no no that's elijah

[2:18:45] is in the catholic church
[2:18:47] kill john the baptist are you clear job
[2:18:52] to job
[2:18:52] to matthew 17.
[2:18:58] if you're there you can say amen verse
[2:19:01] 11.
[2:19:02] are you there i want everybody to please
[2:19:04] to see that
[2:19:06] please and jesus answered
[2:19:09] no let's go to verse 10. and his
[2:19:11] disciple asked
[2:19:12] him saying why
[2:19:16] then say the scrub that elijah must come
[2:19:21] so john the baptist jesus presented him
[2:19:25] and john was killed some of the
[2:19:28] disciples of jesus christ
[2:19:29] missed john but when they are coming
[2:19:32] from the
[2:19:34] mon transfiguration when they sin elijah
[2:19:36] there
[2:19:37] they say wait a minute we thought elijah
[2:19:40] will come before you
[2:19:42] are you there now let's see how jesus
[2:19:45] answered
[2:19:47] are you there praise the lord verse 11.
[2:19:49] and jesus said so and said to them
[2:19:52] elijah truly
[2:19:56] future i thought jesus in verse 11
[2:20:00] already presented elijah
[2:20:04] everybody saying in verse 11 jesus told
[2:20:07] us
[2:20:08] he was elijah now jesus is saying a
[2:20:11] judge shall come
[2:20:15] jesus you just told us he was elijah
[2:20:17] over there
[2:20:19] elijah shall come
[2:20:23] if you notice jesus doesn't say first
[2:20:27] do you see that the disciples say first
[2:20:31] because they were referring to jesus but
[2:20:34] when jesus is replying
[2:20:36] he said elijah shall come
[2:20:39] oh john the baptist already came jesus
[2:20:42] presented him and they also killed john
[2:20:46] elijah shall come in the future
[2:20:49] and restore all
[2:20:52] things okay
[2:20:55] watch verse 12 but
[2:21:00] in other words i love you but
[2:21:04] we are separating something here do you
[2:21:07] see that
[2:21:08] but i said to you that elijah
[2:21:12] is come already
[2:21:15] do you see jesus said elijah
[2:21:18] shall future but
[2:21:21] the one you are asking me is already
[2:21:25] came
[2:21:27] i have already presented him
[2:21:30] you see that elijah has already come
[2:21:34] and they knew him not but
[2:21:37] have done to him whatsoever there
[2:21:40] listen they have killed him
[2:21:43] right likewise in the same manner
[2:21:47] shall also the son of man suffer of them
[2:21:51] so jesus is telling them elijah
[2:21:54] will come in the future but to answer
[2:21:58] your question
[2:21:59] elijah that you are asking me already
[2:22:02] came
[2:22:03] and they kill him and the same way they
[2:22:06] kill him
[2:22:06] they're going to also kill me
[2:22:12] you see you're too elijah you see elijah
[2:22:16] but when elijah comes he's going to
[2:22:18] restore what take
[2:22:22] out to chapter three
[2:22:28] take out the chapter three so next time
[2:22:31] don't worry about brother branham being
[2:22:33] malachi 4 anymore
[2:22:38] check out the chapter three you were
[2:22:40] waiting for grand finale we are
[2:22:41] blending in grand finale
[2:22:46] let's go to chapter three verse 20.
[2:22:51] are you there and he shall send
[2:22:54] jesus which was which before was
[2:22:58] preached to you
[2:22:59] whom the heaven must receive remember
[2:23:03] when jesus died
[2:23:04] and rose again in acts chapter one
[2:23:07] he went on the mount of olive and jesus
[2:23:10] was taken up
[2:23:11] and he went to heaven so now they are
[2:23:14] explaining here that jesus went to
[2:23:16] heaven
[2:23:17] they haven't received jesus christ the
[2:23:19] heavens are blocking jesus christ
[2:23:23] until until when
[2:23:29] you're there you you there verse 21 whom
[2:23:32] the heaven must receive
[2:23:34] until the times of the
[2:23:38] restoration in some other bible they say
[2:23:42] restitution
[2:23:44] it's the same way until the restoration
[2:23:47] of what
[2:23:51] so jesus went to heaven the heaven jesus
[2:23:55] want to come back
[2:23:56] but the heavens are blocking jesus you
[2:23:59] cannot go
[2:24:00] you cannot go why you gotta wait
[2:24:03] till the restoration of offering
[2:24:06] but elijah must come and restore
[2:24:12] in other words jesus will not come
[2:24:16] until the restoration of
[2:24:20] that's what jesus said when i will come
[2:24:22] shall i fund
[2:24:28] you see now you see now what is the
[2:24:31] restoration of all things
[2:24:33] whom the heaven must receive until the
[2:24:36] time of restoration of what
[2:24:39] which god has
[2:24:42] spoken by the mouth of his holy
[2:24:47] since the word
[2:24:51] so this restoration of all things
[2:24:54] is not only too poor
[2:24:58] remember last week it is the entire
[2:25:01] world
[2:25:03] the book of redemption says the
[2:25:06] foundation of the word and
[2:25:09] when that restoration happened
[2:25:12] then jesus come but who's gonna bring
[2:25:16] the restoration
[2:25:17] it's elijah and that
[2:25:20] restoration of all things according to
[2:25:23] his
[2:25:23] he was spoken by his holy what
[2:25:27] go to revelation 10 7.
[2:25:35] they will never show you the scripture
[2:25:40] they will never show you the scripture
[2:25:44] are you there 10 7.
[2:25:47] are you there in the days of the voice
[2:25:50] of what
[2:25:51] said the ninja when he shall begin to
[2:25:54] the mystery of god should be
[2:25:59] as he has declared to who his servant
[2:26:04] what
[2:26:06] you see now elijah must come to restore
[2:26:10] all things jesus christ will not come
[2:26:14] until the restoration of all things as
[2:26:17] was spoken by the
[2:26:19] prophet and those things that was spoken
[2:26:22] by the prophet
[2:26:23] must be revealed under the seventh angel
[2:26:27] of revelation 10
[2:26:28] 7 because when he shall begin to stand
[2:26:32] everything will be finished
[2:26:39] you see now so john the baptist the
[2:26:43] father to the
[2:26:44] children christ but here the children
[2:26:47] the gentiles to the word
[2:26:48] apostle and when jesus christ came
[2:26:52] the first time john was in the water
[2:26:55] baptizing people and what the pillar of
[2:26:58] fire came
[2:26:59] because john had the spirit of elijah to
[2:27:02] introduce the
[2:27:03] messiah and one day there was a baptist
[2:27:06] john the baptist he was first baptist
[2:27:09] here john the baptist he must begin in
[2:27:13] the baptist church
[2:27:14] he must be in the baptist church first
[2:27:17] because
[2:27:18] john the baptist
[2:27:22] brother brother must go to the baptist
[2:27:24] church it's not my hazard
[2:27:27] it is john the baptist when he's
[2:27:30] baptizing
[2:27:31] and the 17th person the pillar of fire
[2:27:34] came down
[2:27:35] [Music]

[2:31:01] fulfill that
[2:31:02] only one spirit that ever been on earth
[2:31:05] that i know
[2:31:06] it would be the elijah in his time
[2:31:10] and he was predicted that he would be
[2:31:12] which is nothing but the spirit
[2:31:14] of that's why they say john the baptist

[2:33:59] that you sent to us it's a message lord
[2:34:02] that is precious

[2:34:59] and join back and come back in line lord
[2:35:02] father lord we ask for your mercy for
[2:35:04] them lord
[2:35:05] and we are committing everything that
[2:35:07] was preached for this church
[2:35:08] unto the hand lord father may the holy
[2:35:11] spirit continue to minister
[2:35:13] to open moral vessels lord for this

[2:36:30] nicolaitan spirit
[2:36:32] and the balaam spirit and the jezebel
[2:36:33] spirit and
[2:36:35] all of them coming before elijah and we
[2:36:37] watched all those different spirits come
[2:36:39] we watched the
[2:36:40] the nicolaitan spirit the word nicoladin
[2:36:43] is to conquer the laity the laity being
[2:36:45] the church and we watch that spirit come
[2:36:47] in
[2:36:47] and uh through brother branham's
[2:36:49] ministry right when the words started
[2:36:50] coming forth they loved the healings
[2:36:52] they loved all of that stuff but when
[2:36:54] the words started coming forth we
[2:36:55] watched that spirit the nicolet and
[2:36:57] spirit come in
[2:36:58] um and we watched the bailin spirit come
[2:37:01] in and even in this time we watched this
[2:37:03] jezebel spirit coming in attacking
[2:37:05] what the prophet brought us when we
[2:37:06] watched elijah come bring us the word we
[2:37:08] watch the jezebel spirit attacking and
[2:37:10] we know we're at the end
[2:37:11] we're at the end we know that it's over
[2:37:13] everything that's been needed to be done
[2:37:15] has been done and we're just waiting on
[2:37:17] the lord to take his bride home

[2:40:45] cursing there there's no god like
[2:40:48] jehovah
[2:40:50] there's no god like jehovah
[2:40:53] there's no god like jehovah
[2:40:56] there's no god like jehovah
[2:41:00] there's no god like jehovah
[2:41:03] there is no god like jehovah
[2:41:06] there is no god like jehovah
[2:41:11] behold he comes
[2:41:14] he's riding on the clouds
[2:41:17] shining like the sun
[2:41:21] at the trumpet called if
[2:41:25] your voice is
[2:41:32] [Music]
[2:41:34] salvation come and as you're dismissed
[2:41:37] this evening or this morning sing
[2:41:39] there is no god like jehovah
[2:41:42] there's oh
[2:42:05] [Music]
