[14:50] [Applause]
[14:54] before we do this next one
[14:56] you want to go ahead and start playing
[14:58] it thank you jesus for the blood blood
[15:01] so me when me and my wife just went down
[15:03] to florida we visited the church that i
[15:05] uh
[15:06] grew up in i was born and raised going
[15:08] to that church
[15:09] down in sarasota florida
[15:12] and they did this song that actually
[15:14] i've never heard before but
[15:17] it was i tell you what it was it was
[15:19] extremely powerful
[15:21] and the thing that was most powerful to
[15:23] me is
[15:24] while we were singing it i was looking
[15:25] out like i was looking out over the
[15:27] congregation i was sitting towards the
[15:29] back
[15:29] and i saw all the all the people that i
[15:32] grew up with you know of all ages young
[15:35] old i've seen people that have struggled
[15:38] really really struggled i personally
[15:40] know their testimonies and some was
[15:42] drugs some was
[15:44] you know adultery or fornication or
[15:46] different things ones that really
[15:47] struggled and while we were singing the
[15:48] song
[15:50] i noticed that the whole church was
[15:52] reacting
[15:53] and everybody was on fire and everybody
[15:56] was entering in
[15:57] but i saw the ones that really went
[16:00] through though i went through a personal
[16:01] struggle or not just a struggle but met
[16:03] god
[16:04] face to face met the person of god and
[16:08] they had a completely different worship
[16:10] about them they were they were screaming
[16:12] they were shouting they were just
[16:13] completely opened up
[16:15] and that's where i was at because i know
[16:17] what god did for me
[16:19] and i know the power of the blood and
[16:22] when these people caught
[16:24] just through this song they caught just
[16:25] a revelation of the power of the blood
[16:29] they just let go and and i thought about
[16:31] that and i'm like
[16:32] if you can't truly enter into this song
[16:35] then maybe you gotta pray for a personal
[16:37] personal experience with god because if
[16:40] god has done something for you then
[16:41] truly you know the power of the blood
[16:44] and this song should mean something to
[16:45] you so before we sing it i just want to
[16:47] go through the lyrics real quick and
[16:49] just read the lyrics to you and you can
[16:50] read along with me behind me
[16:52] as they keep playing it
[16:55] but the first verse says
[16:56] [Music]
[17:01] it says this says i was a wretch i
[17:04] remember who i was i was lost i was
[17:06] blind i was running out of time sin
[17:09] separated to preach that was far too
[17:12] wide
[17:13] but from the far side of the chasm you
[17:15] have held me in your sight
[17:17] and it says
[17:18] so you have made a way across the great
[17:21] divide left behind heaven's throne
[17:24] to build it here inside
[17:27] and there's at the cross you paid the
[17:29] debt that i owed
[17:31] broke the chains free my soul for the
[17:33] first time i have hope and the core says
[17:36] thank you jesus for the blood applied
[17:39] thank you jesus you have washed me white
[17:42] thank you jesus you have saved my life
[17:45] brought me from darkness into the
[17:47] glorious light
[17:49] and it continues there's another second
[17:51] verse that we'll sing but i'll just skip
[17:52] to the bridge here
[17:55] the bridge says
[17:56] there is nothing stronger than the
[17:58] wonder working power of the blood
[18:01] that calls us sons and daughters how
[18:03] many believe you're a son and daughter
[18:04] this evening calls us sons and daughters
[18:07] we are ransomed by the father through
[18:09] the blood the blood so we're gonna sing
[18:12] it this evening
[18:13] and i've just learned it recently myself
[18:15] so you all can learn it with me
[18:18] we'll go to the first verse i
[18:21] was a rich
[18:24] i remember who i
[18:26] was i was lost i was blind
[18:32] i was running out of time
[18:37] sin
[18:39] separated
[18:41] the breach was far too wide
[18:45] but from the far side of the chasm
[18:50] you held me in your sights
[18:54] so you
[18:57] made a way
[18:59] across the great divide
[19:03] left behind heaven's throne
[19:08] to build it here inside
[19:12] and there
[19:14] at the cross
[19:16] you paid the dead i
[19:20] broke my chains freed my soul
[19:25] for the first time i had hope
[19:30] thank you
[19:32] jesus for the
[19:35] blood apply
[19:38] [Music]
[19:40] [Applause]
[19:45] [Music]
[19:47] thank you
[19:50] jesus you have saved
[19:53] my
[19:54] life
[19:56] brought me from the darkness
[19:59] to the glorious
[20:05] you
[20:06] took my place
[20:09] laid inside my tomb
[20:13] you were buried for three days
[20:17] but then you walked right out again
[20:21] and now death
[20:24] has no sting
[20:26] and life
[20:27] has nowhere
[20:30] for i have been transformed
[20:35] by the blood of the lamb
[20:39] thank you
[20:41] jesus for the
[20:44] blood
[20:47] [Music]
[20:59] jesus you have saved my
[21:03] life
[21:04] [Music]
[21:05] brought me from the darkness into
[21:09] glorious
[21:13] [Music]
[21:16] there is nothing stronger
[21:20] than the wonder working power of the
[21:25] blood
[21:27] [Music]
[21:33] that calls the sons and daughters
[21:37] we are ransomed by our father through
[21:41] the blood
[21:44] [Music]
[21:52] stronger
[21:54] than the
[21:55] underworking power of the blood
[22:01] oh
[22:02] the
[22:03] blood
[22:06] that calls the sons and daughters
[22:10] we are ransomed by the father through
[22:15] the
[22:15] blood
[22:17] [Music]

[42:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[43:02] tonight i'm not preaching
[43:05] brother jeffrey johnson from ghana
[43:08] made his way in to the u.s

[43:19] came all the way down here he's in
[43:20] charlotte with us so
[43:23] i have to pass the ball and let somebody
[43:26] score amen
[43:28] the amazing part is brother robert
[43:30] remind me
[43:32] that the first minister
[43:35] that preached in the hotel
[43:38] when we start
[43:40] this church
[43:41] the first one
[43:42] was brother jeffrey johnson
[43:47] can you imagine
[43:48] and god orchestrated everything
[43:52] when we got into this building again the
[43:55] first one who's going to preach his
[43:57] brother jeffrey johnson
[44:00] [Music]
[44:00] [Applause]
[44:03] it's amazing
[44:07] do you know who was the first one to
[44:08] preach in the hotel
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] you do your homework
[44:19] but i can give you a clue if you know
[44:22] the first one who preached in this
[44:24] church
[44:26] and the first one to preach is brother
[44:28] jeffrey
[44:29] do you think it's a coincidence
[44:31] [Music]
[44:34] the same god that was working there
[44:36] and the same way he started with us he
[44:39] is continuing higher and higher and
[44:42] higher and one of this day
[44:45] the force of gravity
[44:47] will not have any
[44:49] influence on us before you know it will
[44:52] be lighter
[44:53] and ready to fly and meet our lord into
[44:56] the sky amen
[44:58] blessed be the name of the lord
[44:59] everybody happy
[45:01] everybody on board with the sermon
[45:04] nobody behind
[45:05] you understand that you're a vessel of
[45:07] mercy
[45:09] there's nothing
[45:11] that can destroy you no fire
[45:13] no mountain
[45:14] nothing you are built for that one amen
[45:19] you know when god gives a vision
[45:21] sometimes we look at the
[45:24] panoramic plan the big plan of the
[45:26] vision
[45:27] it's like joseph when he had a vision
[45:30] first he saw the 11th star
[45:33] and him in the middle and the other star
[45:35] were bowing to him
[45:37] and then he saw the sun and the moon
[45:41] that was together bowing and then he saw
[45:43] the shift
[45:44] put together and all his brothers sheep
[45:46] were bowing to his sheep
[45:49] so the interpretation was given to his
[45:52] father in a big picture they just told
[45:55] him you think that all of us will be
[45:57] bowing down to you which was showing
[46:00] that there could be a position
[46:03] of a leadership somewhere down in the
[46:04] future amen
[46:06] but like brother nadu preached one time
[46:08] the stuff in between
[46:11] was never revealed amen
[46:13] that was luck under the seventh seal
[46:17] amen
[46:18] he knew that one of this day he's going
[46:20] to reach a higher position but how to
[46:23] reach that position
[46:25] that was not disclosed amen but when the
[46:28] seals open up the seals give you the
[46:32] detail
[46:32] [Music]
[46:34] amen and the avenue of everything
[46:37] if you notice before you even have a
[46:39] sheep
[46:41] you first have to cut
[46:43] the wheat from somewhere
[46:45] and you have to collect the wheat and
[46:47] bound it
[46:48] amen then you take the wheat and
[46:50] position it
[46:52] so joseph have to be cut from his land
[46:55] he have to be cut from his parent and he
[46:57] have to be bound as a slave
[47:00] then he have to be positioned in egypt
[47:03] that mystery was still in the vision
[47:06] but it could not be unfold it was just
[47:09] still under the seventh seal amen that's
[47:12] why when the seals are broken the bible
[47:15] became a new book when you begin to
[47:17] navigate
[47:18] you can see the trace now we know where
[47:20] we're going we know where we come from
[47:23] we even know after our rapture what's
[47:26] gonna happen during the tribulation
[47:28] period we know when we come back we know
[47:30] about the millennium we even know about
[47:32] the new jerusalem even the dimensions of
[47:35] the new jerusalem everything has been
[47:38] unfold by the message of the hour his
[47:41] blood
[47:42] amen that he that he shed purchase
[47:46] us and we belong to him there is nothing
[47:49] not even death
[47:51] not even the first death or the second
[47:53] death nothing can destroy you because
[47:56] you were eternal amen
[47:59] if you don't believe it just wait till
[48:00] the weekend and you're gonna see where
[48:02] you came from let me call by the jeffrey
[48:05] johnson before i start preaching tonight

[1:03:29] behind the adoption

[1:03:36] predestination
[1:03:38] we just read it right now
[1:03:40] the scripture is clear
[1:03:43] praise the lord
[1:03:45] and the scripture said
[1:03:47] hallelujah
[1:03:54] amen amen
[1:03:56] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:03:58] blood the forgiveness of our sin
[1:04:01] according to the riches of his grace
[1:04:03] where he had abandoned towards us
[1:04:06] all wisdom and prudence
[1:04:08] having made known
[1:04:10] unto us the mystery of his will
[1:04:13] according to his
[1:04:17] good pleasure which he had proposed in
[1:04:19] himself
[1:04:22] praise the lord
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:25] praise the lord and verse 11 i want to
[1:04:28] say in womb we also have obtained
[1:04:30] inheritance
[1:04:32] being predestinated
[1:04:41] adoption is all about predestination
[1:04:45] amen praise the lord amen
[1:04:49] hallelujah
[1:04:51] and the prophet said in the message
[1:04:54] let me start from you
[1:04:59] hallelujah
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:01] i want to read something from the
[1:05:02] message that what the prophet said
[1:05:04] before i go on
[1:05:05] hallelujah
[1:05:07] the prophet said here
[1:05:09] in the message
[1:05:13] this great
[1:05:15] warrior david hallelujah
[1:05:22] he said
[1:05:26] there you are
[1:05:28] i'm reading from paragraph 32
[1:05:31] he knows where he was standing
[1:05:34] he knows
[1:05:37] he was a man of faith
[1:05:40] he believed god
[1:05:42] god was in him
[1:05:45] he knew he was anointed
[1:05:48] you haven't sought god
[1:05:50] but god has sought you
[1:05:53] it wasn't you calling for god
[1:05:56] it was god calling for you
[1:05:59] and when god called you
[1:06:01] it shows he elected you
[1:06:06] you accepted the call
[1:06:11] it was justification
[1:06:18] you accepted the call
[1:06:20] and that was justification
[1:06:25] hallelujah
[1:06:26] then you gave your heart
[1:06:29] to christ
[1:06:31] and was filled with the holy ghost
[1:06:35] and you and now you are
[1:06:38] positionality
[1:06:40] are you with me
[1:06:42] did you see yourself
[1:06:44] let's keep on talking about ourself
[1:06:46] it's good to talk about ourselves
[1:06:48] because there is joy knowing
[1:06:50] about yourself
[1:06:52] so every day in life we exploit
[1:06:54] ourselves
[1:06:55] we have our spiritual potentials so all
[1:06:58] we have to do in the national explore
[1:07:01] your potential in the spiritual what you
[1:07:04] do you explore your potential so when
[1:07:07] you are talking about the message and
[1:07:08] you come to predestination you are
[1:07:10] exploiting your spiritual potential so
[1:07:13] tonight we are going to continue to
[1:07:15] exploit our spiritual potential because
[1:07:19] hallelujah the prophet said
[1:07:21] you are positionally blessed
[1:07:26] in the body of christ
[1:07:30] now if it made you
[1:07:33] quit your old
[1:07:35] habit and act like a christian
[1:07:39] how to
[1:07:41] if it will do
[1:07:43] that for you
[1:07:45] it will heal your body
[1:07:47] because
[1:07:49] it is a promise
[1:07:50] amen
[1:07:52] there you have
[1:07:57] predestination adoption is all about
[1:07:59] predestination
[1:08:02] hallelujah
[1:08:03] that's why the scripture said
[1:08:06] for whom he for knew
[1:08:10] also he predestinated to be confirmed
[1:08:13] to the image of his
[1:08:15] son
[1:08:17] that he might be
[1:08:18] the firstborn among brethren
[1:08:21] moreover them he predestinated
[1:08:24] them he also called
[1:08:26] in whom he called hallelujah then he
[1:08:29] justified
[1:08:31] and
[1:08:31] whom he justified then he glorified and
[1:08:35] when and what shall we say to these
[1:08:37] things
[1:08:39] if god be for us who can be
[1:08:42] against us in other words if god called
[1:08:44] you
[1:08:47] hallelujah
[1:08:48] and you respond to his call
[1:08:51] not because it is your will or because
[1:08:54] you love god
[1:08:55] not because you sought god or because
[1:08:57] you want to serve you know god
[1:09:00] but god in his great mercy
[1:09:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:06] hallelujah that knows his home
[1:09:10] and hallelujah called them by their name
[1:09:13] and he said if you are my sheep you will
[1:09:16] definitely hear my voice
[1:09:19] to hear is to understand to understand
[1:09:22] is to recognize so when you hear the
[1:09:24] call you will recognize the world across
[1:09:28] you so the power of adoption
[1:09:30] lies on the ability of the individual to
[1:09:34] respond to the voice to recognize the
[1:09:36] wonder cost
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] the power of adoption
[1:09:44] lies on the ability
[1:09:46] of the individual
[1:09:48] to respond
[1:09:50] and before you can respond you have to
[1:09:53] recognize it and for you to recognize it
[1:09:56] you have to got the revelation you have
[1:09:58] to understand you have to know who is
[1:10:00] calling you before you can respond
[1:10:13] let go help us tonight
[1:10:16] hallelujah
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:23] it's a call
[1:10:28] you are to respond to
[1:10:33] something you have to recognize first
[1:10:37] and you are responding to it amen
[1:10:41] hallelujah
[1:10:43] and you have to recognize it before you
[1:10:46] can respond
[1:10:47] if you don't recognize you can respond
[1:10:52] hallelujah
[1:10:55] now let me say i used to call your
[1:10:58] pastor brother etienne
[1:11:00] let's
[1:11:02] take our time
[1:11:04] and take a good look at the power of
[1:11:06] adoption in this way again
[1:11:10] let me say brother tell him please come
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] ask me did i tie rope on him
[1:11:23] did i ask somebody to pull him and come
[1:11:25] why did i just say when i take him just
[1:11:27] keep coming there is something
[1:11:30] that pulls him
[1:11:32] and makes him to get up
[1:11:34] and respond to me
[1:11:35] and walk and camp yes i didn't tie him i
[1:11:39] didn't drag him we are talking about the
[1:11:42] power of adoption
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:57] a voice yes
[1:12:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:12:02] agent
[1:12:04] when we begin to stand
[1:12:07] how the mystery of god will be finished
[1:12:11] as he has declared to his servant the
[1:12:13] prophet
[1:12:14] and if you are not the prophet
[1:12:16] what are we going to do with all your
[1:12:18] miracles in the name of holy ghost
[1:12:20] we don't deny you are not doing miracle
[1:12:22] in the name of holy ghost but when you
[1:12:24] are not the prophet what are we going to
[1:12:26] do with that
[1:12:27] it's all good for nothing
[1:12:30] good for the shaking
[1:12:31] hallelujah but not for the ego
[1:12:35] hallelujah
[1:12:38] in the days of the voice
[1:12:40] all the mystery
[1:12:42] it really says something will be left
[1:12:45] oh hallelujah and jesus said my sheep
[1:12:48] knows my voice
[1:12:50] and definitely they will respond to it
[1:12:53] and the bible made us to know god cannot
[1:12:55] do anything
[1:12:57] unless he revealed it first to his
[1:12:59] servant the prophet
[1:13:01] so if god is going to call
[1:13:03] if god has as a preacher as as a for not
[1:13:06] if god has for knowledge
[1:13:09] and have to predestinate
[1:13:11] then he have to
[1:13:13] give us a prophet
[1:13:17] if he has a foreknowledge
[1:13:19] that he have to do he has to
[1:13:22] predestinate
[1:13:23] then
[1:13:25] he have to give us a prophet
[1:13:30] hallelujah
[1:13:33] so
[1:13:35] there is a reason for brother 18 to
[1:13:38] respond
[1:13:39] and first
[1:13:43] you have to hear
[1:13:47] the voice
[1:13:50] you have to hear says
[1:13:52] as the book of john said my sheep
[1:13:55] knows hear my voice
[1:13:58] so first of all you have to hear
[1:14:02] hallelujah amen
[1:14:03] and when he hear
[1:14:06] you know there is something in hearing
[1:14:09] to hear me to understand
[1:14:11] and when you understand it catch your
[1:14:12] old
[1:14:14] that is why jesus said a stranger they
[1:14:16] will no longer follow
[1:14:18] because when they hear he diverts all
[1:14:21] the attention
[1:14:22] to the words
[1:14:27] note that they are not aware of all the
[1:14:29] noise that the chickens are making
[1:14:30] around they are hundred percent away
[1:14:34] but because they're here
[1:14:36] blessed are your ears
[1:14:38] for they can hear
[1:14:42] for because they hear
[1:14:44] a stranger they cannot follow
[1:14:47] me they knew that there are strangers
[1:14:49] everywhere
[1:14:50] and they have their work
[1:14:52] but this one they hear his voice
[1:14:58] let me go ahead post tonight
[1:15:00] a stranger that we no longer follow
[1:15:04] they hear my voice
[1:15:06] note he have to hear before it can
[1:15:09] follow
[1:15:11] are you with me
[1:15:13] without hearing he can follow
[1:15:15] and to hear means to understand and in
[1:15:17] the spiritual realm it's called
[1:15:19] revelation so we have to call the
[1:15:21] revelation of the voice of the one that
[1:15:24] caused him before he can get up
[1:15:27] because
[1:15:28] he knew
[1:15:29] that
[1:15:30] the one who caused him
[1:15:32] he knew him
[1:15:37] if brother completely
[1:15:38] didn't know even if it is outside maybe
[1:15:41] he's going somewhere and i saw him
[1:15:42] somewhere maybe at the walmart say oh
[1:15:44] brother personally
[1:15:46] immediately tony said oh brother
[1:15:49] you start responding
[1:15:52] just coming to have a hug
[1:15:54] or a shake
[1:15:57] understanding who is calling him
[1:16:00] divert his attention from every other
[1:16:02] thing
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:09] amen hallelujah
[1:16:11] so
[1:16:12] when we hear the voice
[1:16:14] of the promise of our day
[1:16:17] that god is sending us a prophet
[1:16:20] there is no other voice
[1:16:22] we can be going to our walmart with our
[1:16:24] friends and we can be doing all our
[1:16:26] shopping with our relationships
[1:16:29] but hallelujah when we hear his voice is
[1:16:34] a different thing entirely because it's
[1:16:36] a total turning around
[1:16:38] hallelujah
[1:16:40] all these have passed away
[1:16:42] everything has become new why because in
[1:16:45] your mind by understanding you have
[1:16:48] discovered your potential
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:53] you have come to the revelation of your
[1:16:55] reality
[1:16:56] and when a man comes to the revelation
[1:16:58] of his reality
[1:17:00] what can take him away
[1:17:07] what can distract his attention again
[1:17:11] come to the revelation of your
[1:17:15] yes reality
[1:17:16] what you are yes sir
[1:17:19] yes my brother
[1:17:21] thank you yes sir
[1:17:23] thank you lord
[1:17:25] may god help us
[1:17:29] to hear
[1:17:31] is to follow
[1:17:34] is to understand
[1:17:37] and if you don't understand
[1:17:39] you cannot follow
[1:17:42] hallelujah amen
[1:17:48] because
[1:17:50] when paul was going
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:56] the people that was with him
[1:17:59] the prophet said
[1:18:04] paul
[1:18:05] was meeting down
[1:18:11] but they can't see
[1:18:13] nothing
[1:18:14] but paul sees something
[1:18:18] and they are wondering
[1:18:20] hallelujah
[1:18:22] and paul by revelation
[1:18:24] of what he see and here
[1:18:26] asking them to send him to somewhere
[1:18:30] and they cannot understand why he is
[1:18:32] asking them to send him to such a place
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:50] your calling is not your willingness
[1:18:55] you are responding to something that is
[1:18:58] beyond you
[1:19:04] that is the reason why
[1:19:06] you can live this way you are living
[1:19:10] that is the reason why you can rejoice
[1:19:12] in the gospel
[1:19:14] and you love serving god in this way
[1:19:17] and the people cannot understand
[1:19:20] and they look at the entire atmosphere
[1:19:24] and the present life that is on the
[1:19:26] ground
[1:19:27] and they look at you
[1:19:29] and they cannot tell how
[1:19:31] you are living in such a way
[1:19:34] you say brother i loved a lot you didn't
[1:19:37] love the lord
[1:19:40] the prophet said nobody loved the lord
[1:19:44] nobody seek the lord
[1:19:46] nobody desire god
[1:19:48] it is god that desire you
[1:19:51] in the garden of adam you need them the
[1:19:54] prophet said it is not adam that was
[1:19:56] seeking lord lord where are you
[1:19:58] it was god who was seeking other where
[1:20:00] are you
[1:20:01] so brother and sister
[1:20:03] by the crucifixion and the blood of
[1:20:06] jesus christ we have all come to the
[1:20:09] revelation
[1:20:11] back to our bishop to recognize our
[1:20:14] position in christ before the foundation
[1:20:17] of the world
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:28] and what we read the prophet said
[1:20:30] if god
[1:20:32] can make it
[1:20:34] i want to be brief because we have some
[1:20:35] descent the prophet said if god can do
[1:20:39] such a thing
[1:20:40] and make you
[1:20:42] live against your will
[1:20:50] i'm not living against my way that's my
[1:20:51] revelation that because i called the
[1:20:53] revelation i said yes you called the
[1:20:54] revelation you are living against your
[1:20:56] will
[1:20:58] you say how
[1:20:59] let's break it down a little bit
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:04] that is the reason why sometimes
[1:21:07] when we see our friends our colleagues
[1:21:09] and we went go to work and school with
[1:21:11] them
[1:21:13] we are we last after
[1:21:16] the things they do
[1:21:18] and even sometimes we want to buy
[1:21:20] clothes
[1:21:21] we love the clothes but something is in
[1:21:22] you
[1:21:24] telling you don't buy this one
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:28] you
[1:21:29] you in your heart you love it
[1:21:31] and something that is telling you no
[1:21:38] so then it becomes a
[1:21:41] pulling each other walk i just wanna
[1:21:43] and sometimes yes god bless you the
[1:21:46] white dog and the black dog and you say
[1:21:49] i don't see anything wrong with it
[1:21:52] because it's looking nice i think at
[1:21:54] least other christians can wear this one
[1:21:57] you see that tells you
[1:22:00] it is not your will
[1:22:02] that tells you your desire is there but
[1:22:05] something else is pulling you
[1:22:09] making you to deny your own desire
[1:22:12] so therefore paul said the things i want
[1:22:14] to do
[1:22:19] hallelujah
[1:22:21] those things i love doing
[1:22:23] i find myself doing not doing it and
[1:22:26] those things i don't want to do those
[1:22:28] are the things i end up doing
[1:22:31] why because it is not the will of paul
[1:22:35] hallelujah
[1:22:37] what is the secret christ in him
[1:22:42] [Music]
[1:22:49] hallelujah amen
[1:22:52] it is not our own desire
[1:22:54] that we should be saved
[1:22:57] but it is the will of our own father
[1:23:00] and the scripture says he walketh
[1:23:01] everything to his own will that's
[1:23:04] exactly right
[1:23:06] amen if god can make you
[1:23:09] live against your will
[1:23:13] what is
[1:23:14] the situation in this life
[1:23:17] that can hold you
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:20] the prophet and the bible said
[1:23:23] the most powerful man on earth is a man
[1:23:25] who can defeat himself
[1:23:29] and the biggest devil you have and the
[1:23:31] injustice you have in this life is
[1:23:33] yourself
[1:23:34] so if you can defeat yourself there is
[1:23:37] nothing you cannot defeat
[1:23:41] why because the god that justify you is
[1:23:45] with you
[1:23:48] hallelujah
[1:23:50] the power of adoption
[1:23:52] the god that justify you is with you
[1:23:56] and isaiah when he caught the revelation
[1:23:59] as a causing shine of abraham
[1:24:03] and there are a whole lot of trouble all
[1:24:05] over the places isaiah rose up
[1:24:08] i said
[1:24:10] the god that justify me is here
[1:24:14] yes
[1:24:16] amen now he said
[1:24:18] who is my contender let him come
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:29] the god that justify you is always there
[1:24:33] don't look it to be something that it is
[1:24:35] kind of
[1:24:36] a fanaticism that where is the god or
[1:24:39] what is again
[1:24:40] do just leave that one alone
[1:24:42] just look at your wholesales
[1:24:45] how you can live against your way
[1:24:47] that tells you that god that justify you
[1:24:49] is dead
[1:24:50] and that is the secret why you can live
[1:24:52] against your way and in all situations
[1:24:56] isaiah said the god that justified me is
[1:24:59] here
[1:25:00] who is my contender
[1:25:03] let him come
[1:25:04] and stand by my side and i tell you the
[1:25:08] god that justify me will fight for me
[1:25:14] brother tonight
[1:25:16] i'll tell you
[1:25:18] the power of adoption
[1:25:20] that thing that causes you to respond
[1:25:23] is make you to live against your way
[1:25:26] that is the god that justifies you
[1:25:29] he is with you
[1:25:30] and always constrain you that you must
[1:25:33] not live to yourself that you must live
[1:25:35] to him
[1:25:36] because he died
[1:25:38] and paid the price that those who will
[1:25:40] leave will no longer live for themselves
[1:25:43] but to live for him
[1:25:45] who died for them
[1:25:47] so therefore the bible said
[1:25:49] if god
[1:25:51] be with us
[1:25:53] who can be against us
[1:26:02] brother
[1:26:03] i just want god to help us that tonight
[1:26:06] you see the foolishness of the devil
[1:26:08] here
[1:26:12] so that you can know what to do with it
[1:26:14] you know like the maradona and the uh
[1:26:17] mikey all this
[1:26:18] processional footballer

[1:26:43] the goal may go help us tonight
[1:26:46] may god help us tonight let go help us
[1:26:48] tonight the power of seduction that
[1:26:51] cause you to live against you that make
[1:26:53] you to deny yourself to go contract your
[1:26:56] way that is the god of your
[1:26:57] justification and that god is here
[1:27:00] whether you believe it or not he's here
[1:27:03] whether you accept it or not he's here
[1:27:06] i'm telling you this because i can see
[1:27:10] that the god who justify you is with you
[1:27:14] you don't need to tell me plenty stories
[1:27:19] you don't need to tell me plenty stories
[1:27:26] you become shy
[1:27:27] in your working place you become shy in
[1:27:29] your school and you think that the
[1:27:31] people will mock you
[1:27:33] they are not mocking you
[1:27:35] let me tell you a secret
[1:27:37] the people are rather afraid of you
[1:27:41] they are not mocking you
[1:27:47] the people are afraid of you
[1:27:50] they are not mocking you
[1:27:52] so you start feeling shy
[1:27:55] no
[1:27:57] they are only throwing words on you
[1:28:00] just like the dog
[1:28:03] when you see you coming back
[1:28:07] but when you know who you are
[1:28:10] that the god who created you
[1:28:12] made you superior more than the god
[1:28:14] like david said
[1:28:16] who is this philistine
[1:28:18] that god has made me superior
[1:28:20] by the covenant of abraham
[1:28:22] over this philistine the same god
[1:28:25] we bring him before my faith
[1:28:29] when you stand like david
[1:28:31] that recognized that god made you
[1:28:33] superior to the lion and knocked the
[1:28:36] lion
[1:28:37] and he came to his enemy goliath he
[1:28:40] remembered god made him superior
[1:28:43] what comes to his mind that makes him to
[1:28:45] know
[1:28:46] he remember the convent he's living
[1:28:48] under him
[1:28:50] he know that there is
[1:28:51] the covenant as a blood
[1:28:54] that has a voice
[1:28:55] that speaks to his heart
[1:28:57] the spirit to his heart the promise of
[1:29:00] the covenant that your children abraham
[1:29:04] will possess the gifts of their enemy so
[1:29:06] when anything comes before the end as
[1:29:08] the enemy he rise up he said the god who
[1:29:12] make me superior over this situation
[1:29:15] that i will possess the gates of my
[1:29:17] enemy and if you are coming as my enemy
[1:29:20] therefore the god who justified me we
[1:29:23] possess you for me
[1:29:25] hallelujah joshua and caleb said be not
[1:29:29] afraid
[1:29:30] of all these giants
[1:29:32] be not afraid
[1:29:34] if god that justify us
[1:29:37] call us
[1:29:39] if he
[1:29:40] has spoken according to the promise of
[1:29:43] this covenant we are standing
[1:29:45] said he has given us the land therefore
[1:29:48] take no thought of it
[1:29:50] for the same god
[1:29:53] who gave you the promise the same one
[1:29:56] will go ahead of you because the bible
[1:29:58] said to him to them he for knew
[1:30:02] he pre-recorded and then he called he
[1:30:05] predestinated and then he predestinated
[1:30:08] he justified then he then he are you
[1:30:12] included
[1:30:14] he not you
[1:30:15] then he called
[1:30:17] then he justified
[1:30:19] then he predestinated where is your work
[1:30:22] there
[1:30:23] nothing oh god
[1:30:25] god will help us now we'll continue to
[1:30:26] know where our work is today we will
[1:30:28] know where our work is there
[1:30:30] that god he who justified he who he who
[1:30:34] he who where are you there
[1:30:37] somebody
[1:30:38] that god that justify you
[1:30:41] is always with you
[1:30:43] be not afraid
[1:30:45] who is your contender if he has grace
[1:30:48] and he he
[1:30:50] he have eyes let him come and stand
[1:30:52] before you
[1:30:57] so
[1:30:59] the things you think you are passing
[1:31:00] through as a persecution
[1:31:03] as a mockery
[1:31:04] hallelujah
[1:31:06] it's just a scarecrow that the devil
[1:31:08] tried to scare you
[1:31:10] not not that
[1:31:12] not that you are failing
[1:31:24] but when you recognize yourself
[1:31:27] like david
[1:31:28] and say god make me superior over you
[1:31:31] so who are you dog
[1:31:33] to come and be go go and scare me away
[1:31:35] okay let's see who is powerful
[1:31:38] when you take your first step he will
[1:31:40] take his one step back
[1:31:41] when you take the other one he will take
[1:31:43] the other one
[1:31:45] but watch when he's going backwards he
[1:31:47] never stop backing you see go go
[1:31:51] and you come again he will go back one
[1:31:53] you say go go
[1:31:55] and you will go again here we go back
[1:31:56] again
[1:32:01] he will not want to give up
[1:32:03] till his time come he will still be
[1:32:04] backing
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:09] so all those things you think is a
[1:32:11] persecution and sometimes you see that
[1:32:14] oh i have been depressed
[1:32:17] the enemy is just trying to disbelieve
[1:32:20] what god gives you as a victory
[1:32:26] because he can't do you nothing
[1:32:29] only thing he can do
[1:32:31] is to make you drunk deny the world and
[1:32:34] when you deny it
[1:32:35] he laughed
[1:32:36] and he ran to go at me mister go hi mr
[1:32:38] god look at him he will be talking about
[1:32:40] him let me deal with tim smalls he
[1:32:42] hasn't even gone out
[1:32:44] he has all his freedom to deal with you
[1:32:46] the prophet said the devil can do you
[1:32:48] nothing until first you step out of the
[1:32:51] way
[1:32:53] yes my brother he can't do you nothing
[1:32:56] brother we are on the winning ground
[1:32:58] we are on the winning side
[1:33:00] nobody can defeat us
[1:33:02] nothing can take us nothing can scare us
[1:33:05] because the bible said we
[1:33:08] are not filled with the spirit of fear
[1:33:13] [Applause]
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:18] yes my brother amen
[1:33:25] that brings you to bondage
[1:33:27] i make you think that oh you have been
[1:33:29] deprived
[1:33:31] oh then if not because the message
[1:33:33] i have i would have get this thing
[1:33:37] so you start thinking what is it you are
[1:33:40] bringing yourself into bondage that's
[1:33:42] exactly right but brother and sister
[1:33:45] the power of adoption
[1:33:48] the god that justify you the one behind
[1:33:52] the bible said
[1:33:53] we are born not of corruptible things
[1:33:57] but the incorruptible word of the living
[1:34:00] god
[1:34:02] hallelujah
[1:34:03] and there is power in the world
[1:34:06] which is the voice
[1:34:08] that is why when you can cause somebody
[1:34:10] you don't tie him he keep responding
[1:34:13] because every voice there is a power in
[1:34:16] it
[1:34:20] yes
[1:34:22] there is a power in this speaking word
[1:34:24] yes
[1:34:26] even your word you are speaking there is
[1:34:28] power yet
[1:34:33] and therefore as we close
[1:34:36] the bible said
[1:34:38] hallelujah
[1:34:41] it is written
[1:34:45] that i believe we believe
[1:34:49] hallelujah
[1:34:51] let's relax
[1:34:52] we want to close
[1:34:56] that words
[1:34:58] that have power
[1:35:01] to give you victory
[1:35:05] is the same god that justifies you
[1:35:09] and that word
[1:35:11] is in you
[1:35:12] meaning the god that justify you
[1:35:15] is in you
[1:35:16] therefore the scripture says he that is
[1:35:18] in you who that god the one who
[1:35:21] justifies you
[1:35:24] the word is in you
[1:35:28] so paul said
[1:35:31] the word is near unto you
[1:35:35] isaiah said the god that justify me is
[1:35:38] near
[1:35:39] and in the new testament paul said the
[1:35:41] word
[1:35:42] is near to you
[1:35:44] and the word is the same man who justify
[1:35:48] you
[1:35:49] because it gives his word of
[1:35:51] justification
[1:35:53] and you respond to it
[1:35:55] and walk
[1:35:57] hallelujah
[1:35:59] and he
[1:36:00] sanctify you
[1:36:01] and he
[1:36:02] fill you with himself
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:08] are you with me
[1:36:10] the word is near unto you that's exactly
[1:36:13] right
[1:36:14] and he went for that and said
[1:36:17] it is even in your mouth
[1:36:25] there is power in the world
[1:36:28] and that word is in your
[1:36:32] so what is in your mouth
[1:36:40] you don't need to struggle
[1:36:42] you don't need to argue with people what
[1:36:44] is it their word their power is in your
[1:36:48] mind so what do you do speak
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:53] hallelujah
[1:36:54] speak the word
[1:36:58] speak enemy forward
[1:37:01] for paul said
[1:37:02] the word is near unto you
[1:37:05] even in your mouth
[1:37:07] and with your heart
[1:37:09] you believe it
[1:37:10] oh
[1:37:11] hallelujah
[1:37:13] with a heart a man believe
[1:37:16] hallelujah i am with the mouth
[1:37:19] the mouth
[1:37:20] confession
[1:37:22] you speak
[1:37:23] and possess your possession
[1:37:26] because the god that justify you
[1:37:29] is in you in the form of a word
[1:37:32] the power that is over that overcome
[1:37:34] every other power
[1:37:36] the power that defeats the devil as the
[1:37:39] prophet said the word in your mouth can
[1:37:42] defeat the devil
[1:37:44] anytime
[1:37:45] anywhere
[1:37:47] any situation
[1:37:48] any condition so they were tonight is in
[1:37:52] your mind brother
[1:37:55] and you believe it
[1:37:57] and you have respond to it tonight
[1:37:59] you believe it and you have respond to
[1:38:01] it tonight so therefore
[1:38:04] speak
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:06] [Applause]

[1:38:09] handle it
[1:38:10] and rainbow like this and like it ain't
[1:38:13] like this
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:30] shall we be on our feet
[1:38:32] i'm trying to avoid a lot of things
[1:38:34] because
[1:38:35] on sunday's day
[1:38:36] when you run into something it will take
[1:38:38] you more time to explain
[1:38:40] so you
[1:38:41] god help you
[1:38:43] hallelujah
[1:38:44] so
[1:38:47] i want us to read this thing against too
[1:38:49] close
[1:39:00] listen
[1:39:02] we are closing with it
[1:39:03] the prophet said
[1:39:08] don't be scared
[1:39:11] so that we are going to play the devil
[1:39:12] like football
[1:39:14] to our own skill
[1:39:16] so first of all you don't have to be
[1:39:18] afraid
[1:39:19] so now you know that you are in control
[1:39:21] of the ball but if you are afraid you
[1:39:22] are not in control of the ball
[1:39:24] so we are in the football field now
[1:39:26] because paul was playing and he was
[1:39:27] typing it with the football field so we
[1:39:29] are also in the football field now
[1:39:31] hallelujah
[1:39:32] but first of all before you can move
[1:39:35] with confidence with the power you have
[1:39:37] to be confident
[1:39:40] you must see that you are more
[1:39:41] professional than the man
[1:39:43] then you give you inspiration
[1:39:46] the boss i was talking one time sorry he
[1:39:48] was talking one time he said
[1:39:50] he said is it muhammad ali yes
[1:39:52] he said there is a fight you want to
[1:39:54] fight the man was powerful that him
[1:39:56] so
[1:39:57] because he knew that the guy was
[1:39:59] powerful
[1:40:00] so
[1:40:01] his name because he knew that every his
[1:40:03] name has created a fear so he want to
[1:40:06] stand in the confidence of his name so
[1:40:08] because of
[1:40:09] what he know his motherly well known so
[1:40:12] he came with that confidence and he was
[1:40:13] just straightening the man and the man
[1:40:15] was afraid and
[1:40:19] he confessed that he knew that that man
[1:40:21] would defeat him
[1:40:24] but he just used a confidence
[1:40:26] so i want you to have the confidence now
[1:40:30] and for you to have the confidence to
[1:40:32] put away every fear amen then you are in
[1:40:34] control with the ball
[1:40:36] you put it like this as i put my leg and

[1:52:10] i met brother jeffrey here tonight
[1:52:12] he came on monday we never met
[1:52:15] tuesday no this is the first time i met
[1:52:17] him
[1:52:18] you know what he preached right
[1:52:20] it seems like he was in this church
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:24] but he was not
[1:52:25] so it's somebody greater than me
[1:52:28] greater than you it is the holy spirit
[1:52:32] amen
[1:52:33] it is the holy spirit
[1:52:36] the god that justifies you
[1:52:38] that same god stand beside you
[1:52:42] amen
[1:52:43] that's why when they challenge brother
[1:52:45] branham
[1:52:46] brother branham took the bible
[1:52:49] and put it on the pulpit and he said you
[1:52:52] come
[1:52:53] and stand right there
[1:52:55] and challenge me brother branham knew
[1:52:58] that the god that justified him was
[1:53:01] standing right there and brother branham
[1:53:03] say all the preachers stood there nobody
[1:53:06] moved by the brandon said they knew
[1:53:08] better
[1:53:09] they knew who was standing there he was
[1:53:12] not brother branham he was the angel of
[1:53:15] the lord
[1:53:16] amen the one who identified with brother
[1:53:19] branham on the picture
[1:53:20] the same angel stood for him and that
[1:53:23] same angel is standing for this church
[1:53:26] and for every believer that is in this
[1:53:29] church amen you have nothing to do with
[1:53:32] me all i did i heard the call
[1:53:34] and i just responded to the call and you
[1:53:37] heard the call
[1:53:38] just look around you this is not a work
[1:53:41] of a man
[1:53:42] this is only god

[1:53:46] tonight amen and we thank him for his
[1:53:49] grace we thank him for his love we thank
[1:53:52] him for his mercy because he's the one
[1:53:55] as the scriptures say he put the love of
[1:53:58] the truth in our heart
[1:54:00] god's speaking to god that's why brother
[1:54:02] branham said when two omnipotent meet
[1:54:05] the real you that is insane meeting with
[1:54:08] god when two omnipotent means
[1:54:11] the miraculous will definitely happen
[1:54:14] church
[1:54:15] i already told you multiple times you
[1:54:17] don't have to do anything in this thing
[1:54:20] just take god at his word
[1:54:23] believe what he says
[1:54:25] speak the word and move forward
[1:54:27] amen i'm going to give you a short
[1:54:29] testimony i forgot to give it
[1:54:33] it's probably last week if i'm not
[1:54:35] mistaken
[1:54:36] i was at work
[1:54:39] and the employee everybody left
[1:54:41] and i had no patient note that i was
[1:54:44] tapping on
[1:54:45] and i had some
[1:54:47] some of my clothes
[1:54:48] that i needed to drop at the dry cleaner
[1:54:52] and pick up some of them
[1:54:54] but the dry cleaner closes at six
[1:54:56] o'clock
[1:54:57] and here i was in between either leaving
[1:55:00] the note and right for the dry cleaner
[1:55:03] or i can just continue with the note and
[1:55:06] then miss the dry cleaner and suddenly a
[1:55:08] thought came to me why not just pray
[1:55:12] i say lord
[1:55:13] may you hold that dry cleaner
[1:55:16] until i finish my stuff what i'm doing
[1:55:18] here
[1:55:19] and i sat calmly and i continued to do
[1:55:22] my patient note
[1:55:24] until i finished i closed everything
[1:55:26] it's past six o'clock
[1:55:28] i put the alarm and everything and i
[1:55:30] left
[1:55:31] and i stopped at the dry cleaner
[1:55:34] for some reason the dry cleaner sign is
[1:55:37] open
[1:55:39] and the door is wide open and there is
[1:55:41] nobody in the shop
[1:55:43] at the desk
[1:55:45] i enter him
[1:55:47] and there is a signal when you enter in
[1:55:48] the door ring a bell
[1:55:50] and suddenly the owner came out
[1:55:53] and he kind of looked around like
[1:55:55] questioning why was the door still open
[1:56:03] you know what i gave him the clothes the
[1:56:06] other clothes i picked up the clothes
[1:56:08] and as soon as i left i entered in the
[1:56:11] car do you know what happened
[1:56:13] he turned the sign off he even closed
[1:56:16] the door and turned the light off
[1:56:18] [Music]

[1:57:00] even sleep nor slumber he slept in the
[1:57:03] man jesus christ
