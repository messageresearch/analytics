[21:29] and
[21:30] revealing himself to us we tuned into
[21:33] the service on sunday
[21:36] and um it just just been on my heart all
[21:39] week about
[21:40] how the father is seeking fellowship
[21:43] with us
[21:45] um and you know it's sometimes
[21:50] we are more privileged than you realize
[21:53] there's some people that
[21:55] you know god sent a man and a word to
[21:57] them
[21:58] because he had called them out for
[22:00] fellowship
[22:01] but when the man spoke they were just
[22:03] hearing the man and they missed what god
[22:05] was calling them for
[22:07] but i pray that doesn't happen in here
[22:08] amen
[22:10] it's a little song in my heart
[22:14] how can he desire to have fellowship
[22:16] with me
[22:20] pictures and photographs
[22:24] memories of old
[22:28] stories in every frame that have never
[22:32] yet been told
[22:34] and there's a picture in my kitchen
[22:38] that displays a supper scene
[22:42] and there's a meaning within
[22:45] those words that from now i've never
[22:49] seen
[22:51] how can he desire
[22:54] to have fellowship with me
[22:58] there must be something more within
[23:02] that only he can see
[23:06] i pray dear lord take all my life
[23:10] i give it all to thee
[23:14] grant that every day
[23:18] you'll commune with me
[23:25] on the road to emails
[23:28] three men walked one day
[23:32] as they reached their destination
[23:35] the two men begged the third to stay
[23:40] and as they shared together
[23:44] breaking bread and pouring wine
[23:48] i finally now realize
[23:52] the simplicity of this sign
[23:57] how can he desire
[24:00] to have fellowship with me
[24:05] there must be something more within
[24:09] that only he can see
[24:13] i pray dear lord please take my life
[24:18] i give it all to thee
[24:22] and grant that every day
[24:26] you will commune with me
[24:32] oh how could he desire
[24:36] to have fellowship with me
[24:41] there must be something more within
[24:45] that only he can see
[24:50] i pray dear lord please take my life
[24:54] i give it all to thee
[24:58] and grand that every day
[25:03] you will commune with me
[25:09] grand that every day lord
[25:19] [Music]
[25:25] amen it's a revelation psalm says how
[25:28] could he
[25:29] how could he desire to have fellowship
[25:30] with me and and the revelation is
[25:32] is worth his bride and he wants that
[25:36] fellowship with his bride it's so hard
[25:37] for us to wrap our human mind around how
[25:39] he could
[25:40] choose us and we could even look around
[25:42] us at maybe even some other
[25:43] denominational uh churches or people and
[25:47] think oh well they might be a better
[25:48] person than i
[25:49] am but he chose us he chose us to be his
[25:52] bride and that's
[25:53] that's the secret that's the revelation
[25:55] and we're so grateful that
[25:57] he desires to have fellowship with us
[25:59] and it's gonna happen
[26:00] we're not far from it so we just uh we
[26:02] look forward to that day we're close

[34:49] if you get there at seven i don't know
[34:52] whether you're gonna see us on question
[34:54] number 13
[34:55] or number 20 or something like that some
[34:58] of the questions i cannot answer them
[35:00] here because of youtube
[35:04] i'm gonna answer them there so if you
[35:06] miss it
[35:08] you just got to make up no recording
[35:11] it's for the local church amen even if
[35:14] we record his stay
[35:16] for the local church amen i have
[35:18] received
[35:19] quite a few questions but
[35:22] i will advise and i talked to brother
[35:26] robert about this
[35:27] but what i believe we can do except if
[35:31] your trustee
[35:32] says no because they're the boss to deal
[35:36] with it amen
[35:38] i will order if the trustees say yes so
[35:42] you plead with the trustee go beg
[35:44] them and ask them hey man
[35:50] if the trustee agree with it i would
[35:53] like to
[35:53] order the cod book
[35:58] church its conduct order
[36:01] and doctrine i believe volume one and
[36:04] volume two
[36:05] is twelve dollars a piece
[36:08] so we might try to order fifty of them
[36:12] so to make sure every family
[36:15] get one and every young
[36:19] people get one if you need an additional
[36:22] one if you want to help the church you
[36:24] want to purchase it
[36:25] fine it's in the voice of god it is 12
[36:28] i will strongly recommend that because
[36:31] some of the questions
[36:32] that are asked are coming straight they
[36:35] are straight
[36:36] in that cod book if you open you read it
[36:38] you're going to see your question
[36:40] and your answer plan so i'm not going to
[36:43] give you a different answer than what
[36:45] the bible says
[36:46] and what brother bradham says amen but
[36:50] i will strongly encourage the church if
[36:53] possible if you get that book
[36:55] at least one day per day
[36:58] just read one question
[37:02] if i say two it's going to be a problem
[37:03] then i have kids then i got to work and
[37:05] all kinds of stuff so i'm just saying
[37:07] just one if you want to read two three
[37:10] that's fine
[37:11] but at least every day just read one
[37:14] question
[37:15] and one answer and then you close
[37:18] if you have time you can go two just do
[37:22] it every day so per month you should
[37:24] have
[37:24] 30 question and 30 answer if you do that
[37:28] for two months
[37:30] you're gonna see how spiritually you're
[37:31] gonna grow most of your question
[37:34] doctrine and everything is straight they
[37:36] ask
[37:36] brother brother usually if you go on the
[37:38] table
[37:39] all these things are scattered so
[37:41] somebody
[37:42] pull all of them together and put it in
[37:45] one book
[37:46] if you go to the end it tells you page
[37:48] number so and so
[37:49] brother branham is dealing with the hair
[37:51] praise number page number
[37:53] so and so brother branham is dealing
[37:54] with the millennium everything is line
[37:57] up if everybody can get it at least one
[38:00] question
[38:01] before we go three months you're gonna
[38:04] find your spiritual levels
[38:06] showed up like that amen then some of
[38:09] the stuff we say won't be strange

[39:08] have difficulties
[39:09] then you're welcome to call the pastor

[40:08] amen brother abel is singing i'm going
[40:13] on beyond
[40:14] he's expecting the congregation to
[40:15] respond but

[40:20] habit of getting to church and
[40:22] standing like this or just clapping hand

[40:25] you talk amen make sure you can sing
[40:28] amen
[40:29] we want to hear loud voices if you need

[40:40] you should be free genesis chapter 39
[40:44] we talk about the sister the sister
[40:46] we're gonna shift a little bit
[40:48] to the brother i believe i hope every

[40:54] that could be very good genesis chapter
[40:58] 39 verse 7 if you're there you can say a
[41:00] man

[41:05] things

[41:11] potiphar's wife so if you notice
[41:14] this wife this woman is a married woman
[41:17] amen his master's wife
[41:21] cast her eyes upon joseph
[41:25] that's a spirit of adultery
[41:28] and she said lie with me because joseph
[41:31] was a handsome man but
[41:34] joseph accepted
[41:40] right no he's the one that started then
[41:44] gave away you might be seated amen
[41:50] amen we heard a lot

[41:56] fell
[41:57] there is an example here of somebody who
[41:59] was there and did not fall

[42:06] where you can come here and give us a
[42:08] testimony say

[42:16] i'm sorry i already did we're going to
[42:18] forgive you
[42:20] but we want those great testimony like
[42:23] joseph
[42:25] amen but joseph refused
[42:29] and say unto his master's wife
[42:32] behold my master what if not
[42:35] what is with me in the house and he has
[42:38] committed
[42:39] all that he had to my hand in other
[42:42] words look at the
[42:44] trust your husband has given to me
[42:47] everything he has given to me
[42:50] there is none greater in this house than
[42:53] i
[42:54] neither had he kept back anything from
[42:57] me but who
[42:58] the only thing that potiphar could not
[43:02] share was his own wife we don't share
[43:05] wives we don't share husbands amen
[43:13] because thou art his wife it's a
[43:16] possession
[43:18] how then can i do this great water
[43:22] wickedness it's something bad adultery
[43:24] is a bad thing
[43:26] and sin against who you are sinning
[43:29] against the husband and you are also
[43:31] singing
[43:32] sinning against god double verse 10
[43:35] and he came to pass as she sped to
[43:39] joseph howe
[43:42] you see she's persistent
[43:45] so brother stephen because she insisted
[43:48] day by day
[43:50] then i gave away
[43:54] you see that he heard can
[43:57] not answer her he still refused to lie
[44:00] by her
[44:01] or to be with her and he came to pass
[44:05] about this time that joseph went into
[44:08] the house to do his business
[44:10] just a normal word and there was water
[44:15] you see why you don't have to be alone
[44:16] with a woman
[44:19] you see why you don't have to be alone
[44:23] with a man
[44:24] and there was none of the men of the
[44:27] house there with in other words it
[44:29] happened
[44:30] one day no worker was there beside
[44:33] joseph so this time the devil increased
[44:37] he moved from level a to level b level b
[44:39] now he's on level c
[44:41] amen and she caught him by his water
[44:45] what i want you to keep here is this is

[45:11] to catch joseph
[45:14] with his with her hand
[45:19] in other words you don't engage i'm
[45:21] going to do it

[45:26] saying
[45:27] lie with me and he left his garment
[45:31] in her hand and fled
[45:34] and got him out he was locked up
[45:38] being innocent amen

[47:24] verse 22 he goes this young man
[47:28] not like joseph this is an opposite he
[47:31] goes after her
[47:33] immediately as water
[47:36] as a knox goes to the water you go into
[47:40] your death
[47:42] and as a fool to the correction of the
[47:45] stocks
[47:46] till a water there was a narrow
[47:50] somebody was waiting there amen when you

[47:54] when you give in to this woman there is
[47:57] somebody ready to kill you
[48:00] amen and who has the power of death
[48:03] the devil amen till
[48:06] a dog struck through his liver
[48:09] as a bird hastened to the snare and
[48:12] knows not
[48:14] that it is for his life verse 24
[48:18] hearken to me now therefore owe you
[48:20] water
[48:22] children young people and attend to the
[48:25] words of my mouth
[48:27] let not your heart decline to her ways
[48:31] go not astray in her path
[48:34] for she has cast down many
[48:38] wounded amen
[48:42] yeah many strong water
[48:45] men have been slammed by her
[48:48] by her 27
[48:51] her house this woman has a house
[48:57] we're going to go natural and we go
[48:59] spiritual
[49:01] her house is the way to water
[49:06] you see why they kill you so the house
[49:09] of this woman
[49:11] is a way
[49:14] to help
[49:17] if you get under this woman you have
[49:20] your ticket to hell
[49:24] come on going down to the chambers of
[49:27] water the chambers of death
[49:32] the chambers of death
[49:36] do you want to go there amen
[49:39] how many remember when we talk about the
[49:42] mystery of the pyramid
[49:44] you remember that you remember the
[49:46] descending
[49:49] way pathway all the way to the
[49:52] subterranean
[49:53] how many remember that oh my god i
[49:57] might have to revisit that again do you
[49:59] remember this pyramid
[50:02] do you remember this you remember the
[50:05] descending passage
[50:07] because in the pyramid when you enter
[50:09] you don't go up
[50:10] you go first down then you begin to go
[50:13] up
[50:14] because the way up is down amen
[50:17] then if you notice there is a point
[50:20] right here
[50:21] where when you go down there is an
[50:24] ascending passage everybody clear
[50:26] but instead of going on the ascending
[50:29] passage
[50:30] that descending passage continued down
[50:33] the way
[50:33] down there everybody remember then it
[50:36] get to the subterranean
[50:38] chambers
[50:42] do you remember that oh you forgot
[50:45] how many remember that okay please be
[50:49] the name of the lord
[50:50] then when you leave the subterranean
[50:52] chamber you're going
[50:54] up to the ascending channel when you go
[50:57] to the ascendant channel
[50:59] then that opened the door to the queen
[51:01] chamber do you remember that
[51:03] because jesus christ came went down down
[51:06] all the way to hell then he resurrected
[51:09] then jesus ascended after he ascended he
[51:12] opened the door to the church at
[51:14] pentecost
[51:14] you remember that again then when the
[51:17] church started the broad chamber opened
[51:19] up
[51:20] he started the seven church ages which
[51:22] is the seventh
[51:23] uh step of the prophet chamber in a
[51:26] great gallery everybody remember
[51:28] then when you get to the last step which
[51:31] is the great step or the introductory
[51:33] prank
[51:34] that's where malachi 4 take you into the
[51:37] king chamber
[51:38] and when you enter the king chamber
[51:39] there is an empty tomb
[51:41] which was speaking about the
[51:43] resurrection do you remember
[51:45] amen but we are right here
[51:49] on the subterranean chambers these
[51:52] chambers are called the chambers of
[51:55] death make sense so when you get
[51:59] into this woman house if you follow her
[52:02] path
[52:03] you're going straight to hell and the
[52:06] subterranean chamber
[52:07] when you go there there is a place that
[52:10] was unfinished
[52:11] because when christ came down he brought
[52:14] an atomic bomb
[52:15] and he destroyed an empty paradise amen
[52:19] that's why that place looks like a wall
[52:21] happened there
[52:22] anybody clear so far that's your
[52:25] territory of
[52:26] the black dog right here
[52:29] you follow there but the problem is when
[52:32] brother branham went to hell
[52:35] he found everything that the women are
[52:38] doing on their
[52:39] eyes on their makeup everything was in
[52:41] hell
[52:42] and when he went to jesse penny he found
[52:45] everything that he saw in hell
[52:48] back in jesse penny why because hell
[52:51] open her door and pour itself upon the
[52:54] earth
[52:55] amen and when you look at the pyramid
[52:58] the holy ghost shows me that
[53:00] before coming to church there is a
[53:02] message
[53:03] that was explained right there if you
[53:06] look
[53:07] up there there is an escape water
[53:10] there is an escape shaft everybody clear
[53:13] so when the broad age started here
[53:16] pentecost
[53:17] with the church when god sent the holy
[53:20] ghost
[53:21] and the holy ghost came down on the day
[53:24] of pentecost
[53:25] the spirit that left judah that black
[53:28] dog
[53:29] escaped right here and came back again
[53:32] and poured itself
[53:33] down on pentecost as well you see that
[53:36] everything was written in a pyramid you
[53:38] need a prophet
[53:40] you see now so that black dog escaped
[53:43] right here by the escape shaft
[53:45] and went up and when the holy ghost
[53:48] poured down
[53:49] the antichrist spirit also poured on and
[53:52] paul have to begin to fight with it
[53:54] so now hell has been back again on earth
[53:58] everybody clear so far did you get it
[54:01] if not we might have to go to those
[54:03] channels let's go to song of solomon
[54:06] chapter one
[54:07] so this woman have the chambers of death
[54:14] i never understood that escape shaft
[54:16] until before church
[54:19] amen song of solomon chapter 1
[54:23] if you dare you can say amen
[54:28] let's go to verse four join me we
[54:30] already explained that
[54:32] we will run after you these are the
[54:35] virgins
[54:36] connected with christ the king has
[54:39] brought me into his water
[54:42] these are different chambers you see
[54:45] that
[54:46] in the song of solomon they are chambers
[54:49] of the king which are chambers of life
[54:54] because he is life the other one are the
[54:57] chambers of death
[54:59] anybody clear amen
[55:02] and if you notice it's plural there and
[55:05] in the proverb is also plural
[55:07] it's just a perversion by the devil
[55:11] and the king has brought me into his
[55:13] chambers plural
[55:15] you don't want to go to the chambers of
[55:17] death but you want to go to the chambers
[55:19] of life here the king has brought me
[55:24] into his chambers
[55:25] we will be glad and rejoice in you we
[55:28] will remember
[55:30] your love remember that because he put a
[55:32] mark on you
[55:33] that's your first marriage your first
[55:35] relationship with christ
[55:37] we will remember your love more than
[55:39] wine the one of babylon
[55:42] the upright love you in other words the
[55:45] just people
[55:46] love you everybody clear let's go to
[55:49] chapter 4 of song of solomon then we're
[55:51] going to pray
[55:57] you need to stay up because we're going
[55:58] to travel some avenues
[56:04] chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen
[56:07] verse 12 a garden enclosed
[56:11] is my water in the book of
[56:15] the song of solomon the king is a man
[56:21] follow me and the
[56:24] the queen or the tsunami she's a woman
[56:32] and the garden encloses my water
[56:35] this woman is a sister
[56:40] brother kelly amen
[56:43] she is a sister she is a garden
[56:46] that is enclosed you see when they say
[56:49] garden in the garden of eden
[56:51] you know what it means now my sister
[56:55] my water so before salomon put the word
[56:59] spars he first put the word what
[57:01] she must be converted first and believe
[57:05] the message just like you
[57:07] before she become your wife my sister
[57:11] then my spouse that's why paul
[57:14] said that we also have the right to
[57:16] marry a sister
[57:18] not a woman amen
[57:23] my sister karma my spouse
[57:26] and a spring that is water and a
[57:29] fountain that is water
[57:31] in other words this woman is a virgin
[57:34] woman
[57:36] anybody clear the king is a man
[57:40] and the queen is a woman and this is a
[57:43] relationship between god and his bride
[57:46] amen a virgin bride let's pray
[57:50] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[57:53] for your grace
[57:54] your love your mercy father and for
[57:56] everything you're doing for us

[58:08] planet earth can do
[58:09] if you give them an ability to do it
[58:12] lord but to come
[58:13] into interpreting your word and feeding
[58:16] your people

[59:05] brother david how we can do it because
[59:06] we're on part
[59:08] 28 so the team will help you remember
[59:11] part one we are dealing with this part
[59:13] two we were dealing with this
[59:14] if you want to go back and look at that
[59:16] amen
[59:17] when we saw on sunday according to
[59:20] ezekiel chapter 16
[59:22] the bible indicated unto us the
[59:26] area where you get uh tempted when
[59:29] you're a teenager everybody remember
[59:30] that
[59:31] we talked about the fashion the other
[59:34] appearance
[59:35] your home care your diet your jewelry
[59:38] and your jewels everybody clear now
[59:41] let's go to first timothy chapter two
[59:44] because we touch on this
[59:46] but there is more into his and the holy
[59:48] spirit
[59:49] opened something more to me this morning
[59:51] and now i understand
[59:52] why sarah called abraham my lord
[59:56] i used to wonder why now i got it this
[59:59] morning i was just opening first
[1:00:01] corinthians
[1:00:01] and begin to read that boom it came
[1:00:04] up but it's dealing with her first
[1:00:07] timothy chapter two verse nine
[1:00:10] in like manner also that who
[1:00:14] we're dealing with women women adorn
[1:00:18] themselves in modest appearance
[1:00:21] the word modest over there
[1:00:25] means respectable
[1:00:28] everybody understand because sometimes
[1:00:31] they say modest people don't get it
[1:00:34] something that when they look at you
[1:00:37] they respect you
[1:00:38] amen the women
[1:00:42] must be uh uh master don themself
[1:00:45] in modest apparel come on with
[1:00:48] shamefestness
[1:00:50] that word shame fateness means
[1:00:54] decency
[1:00:57] everybody clear
[1:01:03] decency and with water
[1:01:07] sobriety sobriety means appropriate
[1:01:18] everybody clear sobriety
[1:01:21] karma not with water
[1:01:24] breaded hair the second part now he's
[1:01:27] going to the second part
[1:01:29] this one is one woman the second
[1:01:33] is a different woman braided hair
[1:01:38] brother steven should we braid hair
[1:01:42] karma or water gold
[1:01:45] i want you to remember this gold
[1:01:49] what else pearl
[1:01:52] should i wear my wing and what
[1:01:57] costly array
[1:02:01] everybody clear now when we look
[1:02:04] on festivity we found out that paul
[1:02:08] if you look spiritually paul is
[1:02:11] describing
[1:02:12] two women because if you just go by
[1:02:16] not breaded hair then african american
[1:02:20] ladies
[1:02:21] are in trouble for breading their hair
[1:02:25] amen and they got to stop it that's why
[1:02:28] you need a prophet
[1:02:32] amen if i just stopped right there i
[1:02:35] said no bread in there
[1:02:36] all the african-american sisters are in
[1:02:38] trouble
[1:02:39] amen what does it mean braided hair
[1:02:44] anybody here if you look right here
[1:02:47] paul is describing two women
[1:02:51] anybody here the first woman
[1:02:54] that paul is describing is
[1:02:57] a woman that wears her clothes
[1:03:01] in a respectable way can you say amen
[1:03:05] her clothes are decent
[1:03:09] and her clothes are appropriate
[1:03:13] when you wear your clothing you must
[1:03:16] make sure i wish this was sunday and
[1:03:18] everybody was here
[1:03:20] you must make sure that when you wear
[1:03:22] your clothes your clothes
[1:03:24] through your clothing somebody when they
[1:03:27] look at you
[1:03:28] they must respect you that's why
[1:03:31] a woman cannot wear a cloth that is
[1:03:34] showing
[1:03:34] her cleavage of her breast because when
[1:03:38] people
[1:03:38] see your breasts they don't respect you
[1:03:41] you are portraying
[1:03:42] something different so sister before you
[1:03:46] come to church
[1:03:47] make sure you look at your mirror and
[1:03:50] make sure you check yourself
[1:03:52] if your breasts are exposed you must put
[1:03:55] something
[1:03:56] under to make sure you cover your breast
[1:03:58] everybody clear so far
[1:04:00] make sure your clothing are respectable
[1:04:04] your clothing are decent they are not
[1:04:07] provoking people
[1:04:09] they are not tight they are not short
[1:04:12] in a way that is going to provoke
[1:04:14] somebody to last after you
[1:04:16] and your clothing must be appropriate
[1:04:20] this goes for the men and the women
[1:04:23] you cannot wear clothes that look like a
[1:04:26] gangster
[1:04:29] you cannot be a man wearing tight
[1:04:31] clothing
[1:04:32] it is giving a wrong message like you a
[1:04:35] homosexual
[1:04:37] you cannot wear any kind of jean
[1:04:40] you can wear your jeans but make sure
[1:04:42] your jeans don't look like crazy
[1:04:45] they don't have all kinds of stuff put
[1:04:48] around them
[1:04:49] amen because somebody when they look at
[1:04:52] you wearing your gym
[1:04:53] or your suit your suit must be
[1:04:56] respectable
[1:04:57] it must be decent and it must be
[1:05:00] appropriate
[1:05:01] you don't wear stuff like star of the
[1:05:04] hollywood
[1:05:05] we are not star of the hollywood
[1:05:08] we are star from the kingdom of god can
[1:05:11] you say amen
[1:05:12] [Applause]
[1:05:13] the second woman that paul is talking
[1:05:17] about
[1:05:18] is an immoral woman where do you get
[1:05:22] that
[1:05:24] paul says that bat which becomes to
[1:05:28] woman
[1:05:29] professing water the first woman
[1:05:33] with water good work remember in
[1:05:37] ephesians chapter 2
[1:05:38] we have created for what good works
[1:05:41] in 1st peter chapter 3 verse 1
[1:05:45] peter says likewise you wives talking
[1:05:47] again to women be in subjection to your
[1:05:51] own husband
[1:05:52] that if any obey not the word
[1:05:55] they also made without the word
[1:05:58] so we need more your life than your
[1:06:00] preaching
[1:06:02] be won by the conversation that word
[1:06:05] conversation means life
[1:06:07] of the wives why they behold your
[1:06:10] chest life in other words they're gonna
[1:06:13] observe you
[1:06:14] and see how the way you behave why they
[1:06:17] behold
[1:06:18] your chest conversation coupled with
[1:06:20] water
[1:06:21] with respect whose adorning
[1:06:25] let it not be off the water
[1:06:28] out there in other words outside
[1:06:31] adorning
[1:06:32] of water playing her back again to the
[1:06:36] same thing pulsing
[1:06:38] instead of calling that breaded peter is
[1:06:41] calling that plating
[1:06:44] everybody clear bleeding hair camera
[1:06:48] and of wearing water you see the same
[1:06:51] thing here paul say
[1:06:52] gold camera and of putting water
[1:06:57] and putting on apparel that putting on
[1:07:00] our prophet peral
[1:07:01] in another translation it's talking
[1:07:04] about those
[1:07:04] expensive clothes which is costly
[1:07:08] which paul explained here let it be the
[1:07:11] hidden man in other words peter
[1:07:14] when he started describing peter begin
[1:07:16] to develop the second woman
[1:07:19] make sense now peter is going
[1:07:22] back to the first woman paul started by
[1:07:25] the first woman
[1:07:27] then he explained you the second woman
[1:07:29] but peter started from the second woman
[1:07:32] and begin to explain to you the first
[1:07:34] woman one
[1:07:36] is a christian woman
[1:07:39] one is not
[1:07:42] anybody clear verse 4
[1:07:46] but let it be the water the hidden men
[1:07:50] of the water
[1:07:53] so this first woman here
[1:07:56] is talking about the inside man
[1:08:01] the man of the heart which speak of the
[1:08:04] word
[1:08:05] so everybody clear let it be the hidden
[1:08:09] man
[1:08:10] of the heart in that which is not
[1:08:13] water so this inner man
[1:08:16] here is not corruptable it's an eternal
[1:08:21] person anybody clear a person that has
[1:08:25] been born again
[1:08:27] a person that does not die it's not
[1:08:30] corruptable
[1:08:31] everybody creates so far blessed be the
[1:08:34] name of the lord
[1:08:36] even the ornament of the water
[1:08:40] this is not a natural ornament
[1:08:44] make sense it's an ornament of a milk
[1:08:50] and water and a quiet water
[1:08:54] a meek and quiet spirit
[1:08:58] are the characteristic of a lamb
[1:09:03] follow me that's why when adam and eve
[1:09:07] saw themselves fig leaves when god
[1:09:11] came he condemned their appearance
[1:09:14] he condemned their government and god
[1:09:17] took a lamb
[1:09:19] and kill a lamb and cloth them with a
[1:09:22] lamb because the clothing of a lamb
[1:09:26] has a message of a meek and a quiet
[1:09:29] spirit that's why the dogs can come and
[1:09:32] sit on the lamb
[1:09:34] because the lamb is a meek beast
[1:09:37] everybody clear
[1:09:38] the dove will never sit on a wolf
[1:09:41] anybody clear
[1:09:42] so peter said that let it be the hidden
[1:09:45] man of the heart
[1:09:46] in that which is not corruptable and
[1:09:49] eternal
[1:09:50] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:09:53] spirit
[1:09:54] which is in the sight of god a water
[1:09:57] so god when he looks at you
[1:10:02] god is more interested on your
[1:10:05] inner person anybody clear
[1:10:09] this is the person that value
[1:10:12] much that's why brother branham said
[1:10:15] that
[1:10:16] a soul of a man worth ten thousand world
[1:10:21] your soul is more precious in the eyes
[1:10:24] of god
[1:10:25] that's the reason why it took the
[1:10:27] creator of heaven and earth
[1:10:28] to come down and died on the cross and
[1:10:31] shed his blood
[1:10:32] just to redeem your soul because your
[1:10:35] soul is precious to him
[1:10:38] everybody clear so far come on verse 5
[1:10:42] for after this manner this is the way
[1:10:46] in the old time that the holy water
[1:10:50] women who trusted in who adorned
[1:10:53] themselves so they all christian
[1:10:57] people focus more on the
[1:11:00] inside person than the outside
[1:11:04] person the bible didn't say they didn't
[1:11:07] wear clothes
[1:11:08] the bible didn't say they didn't take a
[1:11:11] shower
[1:11:12] but their focus is what is first
[1:11:15] seek you face the what do you remember
[1:11:18] on sunday
[1:11:19] that's the gentle focus more on here
[1:11:22] versus over there the christians start
[1:11:25] here before we get there
[1:11:26] amen now what about the breaded of hell
[1:11:31] because paul is introducing something
[1:11:34] him and peter about the hair which is a
[1:11:37] territory
[1:11:38] of the black dog but if you go to the
[1:11:40] book of ezekiel
[1:11:42] ezekiel never says something about her
[1:11:44] paul
[1:11:45] and peter introduced the hair what is
[1:11:47] going on
[1:11:48] with braided hair brother stephen
[1:11:51] brother branham brother branham question
[1:11:54] and answer
[1:11:56] does this first timothy 2 9 everybody
[1:11:59] clear now
[1:12:00] mean a woman cannot break her water
[1:12:03] that's why i want you to have the cod
[1:12:05] book because it's going to be clear
[1:12:09] does broad hair means water
[1:12:12] breaded hair brother brandon answer now
[1:12:15] look sister
[1:12:17] i'm glad that followed this i never fix
[1:12:20] it there but it just followed that good
[1:12:23] if you go back to the previous question
[1:12:25] and answer you're going to understand
[1:12:27] why brother branham says that
[1:12:29] notice a breaded hair in
[1:12:32] that day that's why you need a prophet
[1:12:37] amen you are saved by this
[1:12:41] pentecostal get through this and they
[1:12:43] get in trouble
[1:12:45] the breaded hair in that day in other
[1:12:49] words
[1:12:49] in the time of paul and the time of
[1:12:53] peter when they spoke about breaded hair
[1:12:58] breaded hair in that day
[1:13:01] was a son of water
[1:13:04] a street woman so this woman right here
[1:13:08] is a christian woman but this woman here
[1:13:12] is a street woman or a prostitute
[1:13:17] makes sense so when paul
[1:13:20] is instructing the church and when peter
[1:13:24] is instructing the church they are both
[1:13:27] giving the same answer
[1:13:30] the same recommendation to the church
[1:13:33] they are telling the church that look at
[1:13:36] your women
[1:13:38] when you dress yourself make sure
[1:13:41] you don't copy on a prostitute
[1:13:46] make sense make sure you don't copy
[1:13:49] on the hollywood star because brother
[1:13:53] branham said
[1:13:54] hollywood star by kissing men and women
[1:13:57] on television
[1:13:59] it is a sign of prostitution
[1:14:02] some of them are married women but you
[1:14:04] can get their movie when they're having
[1:14:06] sex with other men
[1:14:08] everybody clear yet they are married
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:11] so paul and peter are telling you
[1:14:15] don't copy after a street or
[1:14:18] a prostitute anybody clear make sense
[1:14:22] now
[1:14:23] now you can braid your hair but don't
[1:14:26] braid it like a prostitute
[1:14:28] make sense let's continue now braided
[1:14:32] hair
[1:14:32] in that day was a son of a street woman
[1:14:37] that is what she done braided her hair
[1:14:41] and paul said to who makes sense
[1:14:45] the christian now that are dawning
[1:14:49] not let it be over breaded or breaded
[1:14:54] and breaded it is the water so that
[1:14:57] answered that question already
[1:14:59] anybody clear now to break the hair
[1:15:02] because it looked like the rest of the
[1:15:04] water
[1:15:06] so the message key here make sure when
[1:15:10] you dress yourself
[1:15:12] make sure young man when you dress
[1:15:14] yourself
[1:15:15] don't look like the world because the
[1:15:19] world
[1:15:20] is under hedonism
[1:15:23] clear now you must make sure
[1:15:27] that your government is respectable
[1:15:31] is decent it's appropriate amen
[1:15:35] if you want to wear a hat that's normal
[1:15:38] but don't go
[1:15:39] and have a big heart that look like a
[1:15:41] crown
[1:15:43] that is not appropriate for a christian
[1:15:47] do you hear me a man can wear a hat
[1:15:51] but make sure your heart is appropriate
[1:15:58] amen that just dropped and i had to
[1:16:00] deliver it
[1:16:02] now you are supposed not to look like
[1:16:05] the water
[1:16:07] or act like the world see
[1:16:10] the women are supposed to be different
[1:16:13] there
[1:16:14] anybody following me praise god
[1:16:18] now breaded hair now today
[1:16:22] bread and hair is welcome everybody
[1:16:25] clear now
[1:16:26] are you free now praise the name of the
[1:16:29] lord
[1:16:30] amen breaded hair is pretty
[1:16:33] and it's a long ways from the water
[1:16:37] so when you dress yourself when you fix
[1:16:41] your hair
[1:16:42] young sister young man make sure you
[1:16:45] are not fixing your hair after the
[1:16:48] fashion
[1:16:49] of the world because that's a territory
[1:16:52] of the black dog your hair gives a
[1:16:56] message
[1:16:57] everybody clear if you cut your hair
[1:17:00] like a like a hip-hop star
[1:17:03] you don't know why they're cutting the
[1:17:05] hair like that
[1:17:07] amen now brother branham continues he
[1:17:10] says
[1:17:11] it is long ways from the fashion of the
[1:17:14] world
[1:17:15] now you see the women the way they do
[1:17:18] the hell today
[1:17:19] just keep your hair in anyway just don't
[1:17:23] look like the water
[1:17:26] don't look or dress like it
[1:17:29] if they were short ever clear
[1:17:33] you were working so no shot for a sister
[1:17:38] ever clear if they do their hair
[1:17:41] cut it all off and bob it and do them
[1:17:44] ever
[1:17:45] you just let yours work alone because
[1:17:49] the bible says that a woman should not
[1:17:51] cut her hair
[1:17:52] everybody clears so far let's continue
[1:17:56] brother branham the question was
[1:17:59] does breaded means blood that means
[1:18:02] breading
[1:18:02] yes that's right now on the street now
[1:18:06] i looked that up to find out years ago
[1:18:09] what the braided hair meant see
[1:18:12] the woman actually the woman of old
[1:18:16] they just pulled their hair back and tie
[1:18:19] it
[1:18:20] more inner ponytail today
[1:18:23] so what you call ponytail today that's
[1:18:26] what they
[1:18:27] used to do that in a long time by holy
[1:18:30] women
[1:18:31] back here and the bad women were the
[1:18:34] ones that were breaded hell
[1:18:36] but today you can bread your hair it
[1:18:38] won't do any problem
[1:18:40] because the stem have changed
[1:18:43] are you following me praise the name of
[1:18:46] the lord
[1:18:47] and they went around they had robots
[1:18:50] like that
[1:18:51] but the women on the street took their
[1:18:54] hair
[1:18:55] and braided it all across their head and
[1:18:58] wrap it around like that
[1:19:00] and put flowers in it and things like
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:03] and that was kind of a flapper on the
[1:19:06] street
[1:19:07] just like we would see a flapper today
[1:19:10] the way she does what
[1:19:12] she dresses so the message that paul
[1:19:16] and the message that peter are giving
[1:19:18] here is
[1:19:19] when you wear your clothing make sure
[1:19:22] your clothing are water
[1:19:24] respectable they are decent they are
[1:19:27] appropriate
[1:19:28] don't copy after the prosthetic
[1:19:31] don't copy after hollywood don't copy
[1:19:35] after the world don't copy after
[1:19:39] the fashion of the world if
[1:19:42] every woman in america is doing the hair
[1:19:45] a certain way don't do it that time
[1:19:49] because you are going after the fashion
[1:19:52] of the world ever clear make sure when
[1:19:56] you want to fix your hair
[1:19:58] you check your muddies and your
[1:20:00] objective
[1:20:01] if you are doing your hair to look like
[1:20:03] a certain star
[1:20:05] you are getting a wrong spirit on
[1:20:08] yourself
[1:20:08] amen you must make sure when you wear
[1:20:12] your hair when you wear your clothing
[1:20:15] when you wear your suit when you wear
[1:20:18] your paint
[1:20:19] when people see you they are not too

[1:24:10] love to be in their presence haven't you
[1:24:12] seen people like that
[1:24:14] do you realize that you are sons of god
[1:24:18] the atmosphere everybody clear and the
[1:24:21] air
[1:24:22] that you live in you create a water
[1:24:26] a situation around you that either do
[1:24:30] water
[1:24:31] or it does water so the spirit
[1:24:35] that you have if you have a last spirit
[1:24:37] on you
[1:24:38] is going to just certain kind of men to
[1:24:41] you
[1:24:42] amen it is a make and a quiet spirit
[1:24:46] that is more
[1:24:47] important damn meek and the quiet spirit
[1:24:50] comes by the
[1:24:52] atmosphere you have around you
[1:24:56] amen that atmosphere must take over your
[1:24:59] clothing
[1:25:01] when somebody see you she said so and so
[1:25:04] she's dressed good
[1:25:06] but there is something about that spirit
[1:25:08] that is good
[1:25:09] that's what you want not them sitting at
[1:25:12] your clothing
[1:25:13] and they can't go to your personality
[1:25:15] then it's a problem
[1:25:16] then your clothing are speaking more
[1:25:19] amen better leave that subject alone
[1:25:24] and read what i'm going to because i'm
[1:25:26] afraid you are not getting that you see
[1:25:28] that is what deeper things that the
[1:25:32] church has
[1:25:33] yet got to do what that's right deeper
[1:25:36] things
[1:25:37] but when you come into the real it's not
[1:25:40] something way off
[1:25:41] you can understand it's just as close as
[1:25:44] your hand is to you
[1:25:45] you just look over the top of it it's so
[1:25:48] simple
[1:25:48] till you look over it and that is what
[1:25:51] does it in other words your clothing
[1:25:54] must be a clothing that is appropriate
[1:25:56] that is respectable
[1:25:58] that is decent that reflect a meek and
[1:26:01] quiet spirit that reflect the lamb that
[1:26:04] speak about redemption
[1:26:06] when people see you they see more a
[1:26:09] christian
[1:26:10] versus what you put on everything clear
[1:26:12] so far
[1:26:14] brother pronoun in isaiah chapter five
[1:26:16] which we will get on sunday lords

[1:26:21] they will work
[1:26:22] changeable apparel and everything like
[1:26:25] that
[1:26:26] but there was water pride and welcome
[1:26:30] do you hear me that was pride and stuff
[1:26:34] put on if you do that for prague then

[1:27:22] black dog

[1:27:27] here
[1:27:28] under a proud spirit that's the reason
[1:27:30] why you want to show off

[1:27:34] you can't wait to be
[1:27:35] taken a picture and post it on whatsapp
[1:27:39] because those that miss them must see
[1:27:41] you on the clothing

[1:28:25] this to make sure you see the brand
[1:28:27] that is a demonic spirit it is a
[1:28:31] religious spirit
[1:28:33] it is wrong the devil got you under good
[1:28:37] clothing with the wrong spirit
[1:28:41] if you do that for proud then it's what
[1:28:46] examine your heart before god
[1:28:49] if there is no scripture for it and the
[1:28:52] way the spirit leads you
[1:28:53] you go ahead and do water everybody

[1:29:11] blind

[1:30:02] do you want to say
[1:30:03] check mark let your husband do that what
[1:30:06] else do you want

[1:30:11] something is wrong
[1:30:14] something is wrong revelation 7
[1:30:18] 10 first one
[1:30:22] and there was and there came one of the
[1:30:24] seven angels everybody knows that angel
[1:30:26] right
[1:30:28] you know him right we went through this
[1:30:30] if you don't know him you go back to the
[1:30:32] sermon
[1:30:34] had seven vows and talked with me saying
[1:30:38] to come here ever clear i will show you
[1:30:41] the water
[1:30:43] the judgment of a great water now

[1:30:50] to come and see a woman that is what
[1:30:54] a prostitute ever clear
[1:30:58] this one caliber 2.
[1:31:02] make sense everybody clear
[1:31:06] paul presented that woman
[1:31:09] and paul say braided hair in my day

[1:31:19] hair
[1:31:20] gold pale costly everybody here now
[1:31:23] brother branham is going to present to
[1:31:24] us the woman
[1:31:26] now it's our day watch that
[1:31:30] paul and peter describe the hair
[1:31:36] you ready verse two verse one
[1:31:40] i will show you the judgment of the
[1:31:41] great whole that sits upon many waters
[1:31:44] with whom the king of the earth has
[1:31:46] committed water

[1:31:53] america and the inhabitant of the earth
[1:31:56] has been drunk with
[1:31:58] the wine of her fornication so he
[1:32:00] carried me away
[1:32:01] in the water so this vision that brother
[1:32:05] branham is giving to us
[1:32:06] is a spiritual sight not a natural in
[1:32:10] other words
[1:32:11] come with me in the spirit i'm going to
[1:32:14] show you
[1:32:15] how a prostitute on the end time will

[1:32:48] and the woman was arrayed in water

[1:34:04] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:34:07] the abomination
[1:34:08] and filthiness of her fornication and
[1:34:11] upon her forehead was a name written
[1:34:13] water
[1:34:14] mystery water babylon the great
[1:34:17] the mother of water heart and
[1:34:20] abomination of the water

[1:34:36] to christmas and easter egg and rabbit
[1:34:39] we show you that
[1:34:40] it's a babylonian spirit anybody clear
[1:34:43] verse six and i saw the woman drunken
[1:34:46] with the water
[1:34:48] remember when you follow this woman
[1:34:50] she's gonna kill you
[1:34:52] you get killed and go into the chambers
[1:34:54] of what
[1:34:56] you follow me now he said is he clear
[1:34:58] now
[1:34:59] she's drunken with the blood of the sand
[1:35:02] she kills
[1:35:04] and with the blood of the mortal of
[1:35:06] jesus christ she destroyed christian
[1:35:08] and when i saw her i wonder with great
[1:35:11] water
[1:35:12] she looks beautiful despite all of this
[1:35:17] and john said wow how can a beautiful
[1:35:20] woman be so
[1:35:21] evil be so cruel
[1:35:24] she was in purple no wonder brother
[1:35:27] branham said there will be a woman
[1:35:29] beautiful in purple evil do you think
[1:35:31] those things came up just like that
[1:35:33] scriptural the message is scriptural
[1:35:37] anybody clear job to revelation 18
[1:35:40] chapter 18 if you're there you can say
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:45] verse seven that woman
[1:35:48] how much she glorify herself she's proud
[1:35:53] look at her on facebook
[1:35:56] how much she glorify herself and live
[1:35:59] deliciously
[1:36:02] so much torment and sorrow give her
[1:36:05] for she says in her heart i see a water
[1:36:09] you remember queen vasa so this woman
[1:36:12] is a queen she's also married
[1:36:17] remember the wife of potiphar
[1:36:21] is everything blending on on wednesday
[1:36:24] get really yummy
[1:36:27] is everything blending okay she sits as
[1:36:31] a queen
[1:36:32] and i am no what we do and
[1:36:35] shall see no water i am no widow because
[1:36:38] i am married
[1:36:40] she still claims she is married but her
[1:36:42] life is a life of a prostitute
[1:36:45] party for wife was still married but she
[1:36:48] was living a life of
[1:36:50] a prostitute trying to kill joseph if
[1:36:53] joseph would have consumed her they
[1:36:56] would have killed him
[1:36:58] but joseph refused and joseph went to
[1:37:01] prison
[1:37:02] and joseph was locked up innocently
[1:37:06] are you there and by being locked up
[1:37:10] innocently
[1:37:11] into the prison god brought a
[1:37:14] burden of a prison ministry
[1:37:21] you gather then when he got into the
[1:37:24] prison
[1:37:24] his ministry was for two things to save
[1:37:28] some of them and some of them to be a
[1:37:31] judgment
[1:37:32] and a condemnation so when you go to
[1:37:34] your prison ministry
[1:37:35] you're going to preach the word some
[1:37:37] people will believe
[1:37:39] some will not believe but your sermon
[1:37:41] will be for condemnation
[1:37:43] that's what god will use it but he got
[1:37:45] to be locked up innocently to bring that
[1:37:47] burden
[1:37:51] everybody clear revelation 18
[1:37:54] verse 7 jump to verse 16 and saying
[1:37:58] hellas hellas let's go to verse 15.
[1:38:02] the merchant of these things which were
[1:38:04] made
[1:38:05] reached by her shall stand a fire off
[1:38:08] for the fear of her determine whipping
[1:38:11] and wailing this is now
[1:38:12] naturally when she's gonna be destroyed
[1:38:16] the people will be sitting and watching
[1:38:18] her remember in revelation 17 there was
[1:38:21] a spiritual insight
[1:38:23] now it is on the natural when you look
[1:38:26] on the natural you don't see a beast
[1:38:27] with seven heads and ten horses that's
[1:38:30] not what you see
[1:38:31] you see something different verse 16 and
[1:38:34] saying allah says
[1:38:35] that great city that was clothed in
[1:38:38] water
[1:38:41] in the natural this woman have
[1:38:44] fine linen and fine linen means what
[1:38:48] the righteousness of water she has a
[1:38:51] form of godliness
[1:38:55] she can talk to you about church stuff
[1:38:57] but she will kill you
[1:39:00] young people she can talk to you about
[1:39:03] church stuff before you know it
[1:39:05] you're under fornication america
[1:39:09] young sister he can talk to you yes i
[1:39:11] believe god i believe the bible
[1:39:13] before you know it both of you under in
[1:39:16] a hotel in a bed
[1:39:18] amen then you're gonna see whether he's
[1:39:20] a christian
[1:39:21] or not everybody clear
[1:39:24] verse 16. that was cloth in fine land
[1:39:27] and camera
[1:39:28] and water purple costly array
[1:39:32] checked everybody clear on the board
[1:39:35] costly already
[1:39:36] come on and scarlet costlier
[1:39:40] checked everybody clear natural come on
[1:39:44] and deck with water everybody see this
[1:39:48] check camera it's your bible
[1:39:51] anybody clear come on deck with god and
[1:39:55] what
[1:39:56] precious stone and what all of this but
[1:39:59] if you notice brother branham don't talk
[1:40:01] about hell
[1:40:05] make sense because the breaded head that
[1:40:08] paul gave
[1:40:09] will not apply in the end timer
[1:40:15] make sense you need a ministry of
[1:40:18] brother brandon to point it to you
[1:40:21] if brother branham used the same word
[1:40:23] that peter
[1:40:24] and paul use peter and paul used the
[1:40:27] hair
[1:40:28] of the time so when brother pranam is
[1:40:30] describing a prostitute
[1:40:32] in the end time he doesn't use the
[1:40:34] terminology
[1:40:36] of peter and and and john paul
[1:40:39] because this is a different time this
[1:40:42] won't apply
[1:40:48] hallelujah jump to verse 23
[1:40:52] and the light of a candle shall shine no
[1:40:54] more at all in you
[1:40:56] and the voice of the broad groom and of
[1:40:58] the blood shall be heard no more all in
[1:41:00] you

[2:00:41] verse 14 there was a water
[2:00:44] look the city is very little i want to
[2:00:47] show you the power
[2:00:48] of wisdom okay there was a little city
[2:00:53] and few men inside so when you look at
[2:00:56] the city
[2:00:57] it's a small church when you look at the
[2:01:00] people
[2:01:00] they are not too many so by number and
[2:01:04] by natural force
[2:01:05] you can destroy them what is going to
[2:01:08] protect
[2:01:09] this city are you there and there came
[2:01:13] a great king against him poor city
[2:01:17] we are little city we don't have a lot
[2:01:19] of people in
[2:01:20] us we don't have a big army here comes a
[2:01:23] big
[2:01:24] army with a great king to destroy us so
[2:01:27] when you look at the scene
[2:01:28] automatically we are gone everybody
[2:01:30] clear
[2:01:32] come on and besiege it and
[2:01:35] built great book work against it
[2:01:38] verse 15 now there was found in it a
[2:01:41] water

[2:01:46] the man was poor but the man had
[2:01:50] wisdom follow me very carefully
[2:01:53] young people anybody clear and
[2:01:56] he by his intellect
[2:02:01] by his what by his wisdom

[2:02:11] being delivered by wisdom
[2:02:15] not a shot a fight
[2:02:19] they didn't engage into a fight
[2:02:23] they just used wisdom and he brought the
[2:02:25] army down
[2:02:26] and delivered the city yet no man
[2:02:30] remember that same poor man verse 16.
[2:02:33] then say that wisdom is better than what
[2:02:38] anybody care if you can't wish them
[2:02:41] you can pull anybody down
[2:02:49] hallelujah come on
[2:02:53] nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is
[2:02:56] despised

[2:03:01] a wise man
[2:03:02] are heard in the in quiet more than cry
[2:03:06] more than the cry of him that rules
[2:03:08] among fools they make much noise
[2:03:11] verse 18 wisdom is better than what

[2:27:14] because of
[2:27:14] you father the veil that nobody could
[2:27:17] approach except the high priest was
[2:27:19] broken
[2:27:20] in two and he was completely open
[2:27:23] exposing the mercy seed
[2:27:25] saying that there is no mediator between

[2:27:28] and god it is only the man jesus christ
[2:27:31] who is the wisdom father through you

[2:27:38] that you are a high priest that can be
[2:27:40] touched by the feeling of our

[2:28:02] when people could bring a prostitute
[2:28:05] and wanted to stun her but when wisdom
[2:28:07] got through there
[2:28:08] he said whoever have not done any sin
[2:28:11] taken cast a stone to this woman
[2:28:14] and wisdom defeated everything yet they
[2:28:17] had the law of moses in the hand
[2:28:19] but they lack wisdom they had the law
[2:28:22] but they didn't have you
[2:28:24] but when you came you came not to
[2:28:26] abolish the law
