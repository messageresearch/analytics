does anybody else have anything this morning we're happy to be here right we can all testify to that this morning any prayer requests we uh we had a we had a man on our street he was my age i actually went to school with him for a little while and uh he woke up earlier this week and told his wife he he was school bus maintenance for charlotte mecklenburg and he said i don't feel right something i just don't feel right well he fell over he fell over and died from a massive heart attack 59 and he was one that we would watch walk around the neighborhood just about as much as anybody does we weren't able to make the funeral yesterday but uh i want to remember his family i had taken uh piano lessons when i was a child with his sister and she had already gone from breast cancer before we moved into the neighborhood and his dad also worked with my dad on charlotte pd back in the day so our families you know kind of intertwined from childhood up so their last name is norman and i know he had at least one son and uh and his and his wife lived up there with him and he had a brother left i think so we just want to you know just remember that family and maybe um god can uh you know

father while thousands and billions of people father do not know do not have this grace for that is all it is grace so that no one can be lifted up or father we all were in the mark of sin but you took us from that mark and you made us our father god in the likeness of your son the lord jesus christ what our honor we have this morning as our pastor is teaching us about the woman and we are the honorable woman that you father god have given your blood have shed your blood that we may be saved cleanse us our father from where we came from and this morning we want to return all the honor and the glory to you dear jesus you heard a different death in the different families father i know what it is to lose a loved one father because i lost my father and i know how hard it is lord may you comfort the families father may you take care or deal jesus of those that are left behind even though the scripture says that it's a pleasant thing a beautiful thing for our son of god to come back to

sister victoria you come and touch the pulpit come and stand here then you would know what's going to happen to you thank you very much musicians we appreciate everything amen how many enjoyed the fellowship yesterday if you are not there i don't know what to do we don't record those and i'm answering a lot of questions so if you miss i don't know how you're going to get it probably we got to take somebody who really can remember things very good right brother josh [Laughter] oh brother benjamin and somebody like that who can do yourself about i mean everything and tell you what to do amen so i know somebody asked me a question yesterday and it was already answered into another house meeting so to avoid repeating a whole lot of them just make sure you're there amen if you can make sure you're there because we're not recording that it's a 101 we don't want anybody to be embarrassed like i'm going to be on youtube or i'm going to be on the website or something like that it's one-on-one lord's willing when we get into the church then we will see when how we're going to start having the sisters only and the brothers only amen if it's the brother no problem i have deacon some good when it's the sister we might have maybe the deacon's wife or one of the sister elder in the church can be there just to help you up amen so as of this time just hold on a little bit we'll be there by god's grace i'm receiving a lot of underwater already i'm not going to say anything but by god's grace we're going to be there amen yeah my wife told me this one say this won't say this won't say we need to get in the building i'm like okay okay okay i got it i got fire from the hotel fire from the church so somehow we're gonna get there amen but random say attention is a blessing amen so sometimes we need to turn the oven up amen so by god's grace sooner you're going to get there amen just bear with me there was a question that was answered yesterday the last question for those that were there the very that was a very very important question and brother kelly mentioned something and i went home and i finally found it where brother branham answered that question so i'm going to add it up a little bit if it takes time it's not me you know who answered that who asked that question amen question and answer in 1964 brother branham i'm waiting just three more minutes if i can and remember that question was the last one i'm waiting just three more minutes if i can let me get something short here maybe but random answer that same question that was the last one the question was i can't give over completely to jesus in other words i cannot surrender to jesus that was the question have i an evil spirit but when i mentioned he said let me just spend the rest of the time on that day that's what happened yesterday we spent the rest of the time until we closed yesterday let me just spend the rest of the time on that day but random now is explaining that question he said you can't surrender to jesus they don't i don't know man or woman i could not tell which it is god knows that now brother branham is going to answer that brother branham said you can't surrender to jesus why what's the matter if you are a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife brother kelly you remember that surrender all you are a leader lady when you were married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtuous in other words you remained virgin but one day you found a man that you loved so like we explained yesterday it start with a love in a heart you wear his completely so just love can drive you automatically to begin to surrender the things that you fought against all your life and try to live clean and clear and virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to one man is that right you put yourself completely in his you are so to surrender is to put yourself completely into the hand of someone amen whatever you have that is precious in your life whatever talent you have whatever uh skill that god put in your heart all of them you take everything and you surrender that to that person and the person we're talking about here is the lord jesus christ because paul in ephesians 5 he says that the relationship between men and a woman is the same as christ and the church anybody clear so far brother brother continue he say all that you st you have stood for indecency and morale by the david a little bit and everything like that now you turn over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man so to surrender is to turn yourself over to somebody to surrender is to put yourself completely in the hands of someone amen can't you do the same thing to who jesus christ just surrender yourself that way all that i am all my mind all my thoughts certainly brother branham continued on the same one he says i don't think that you are possessed of an evil spirit amen so if you begin to struggle in your life for surrendering and you feel like i need to surrender my life it is not an evil spirit what it is then brother branham say i think that evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts you remember we talked about the thoughts yesterday amen so the one that is telling you speaking to you that's the evil spirit just remember that on what we're going to enter here we appreciate all the family members among us we don't have visitors all the family members god bless you amen let me call brother total god bless you amen he said i think that evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts trying to make you think that you cannot surrender yourself to god so when you're struggling i cannot surrender myself i cannot surrender myself actually it's a good sign if the devil is telling you you're not a christian that's a good sign because if you really not a christian he's not going to bother you amen by the way i'm saying let me show you something why would you want to surrender to him the first question because there is something out there calling to you to do what to surrender it's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself so when you feel like i need to surrender my life it is telling you god is ready to do something for your life that's why you begin to feel that pull and don't let the devil touch you out of it amen now what should we do brother branham all you do brother or sister may be a young person or old whatever it is in other words any category just can't find themselves so they can completely surrender brother branham is giving you the answer just give yourself over how do you do it brother branham i need that magic formula says this say this lord my thinking my all that i am i want to give it to you remember yesterday we spoke to you that when you talk to god don't talk to god showing him that you have a phd degree talk to god like a child like an elementary person don't talk to god lord you know strategically thinking when i was pondering on that pretty much you wasting your time tell him that he hurt clear not i'm a little bit uncomfortable god i want you to understand no father he hurt i can't take it no more that's the way you talk to god [Applause] jesus was not speaking a high hebrew language he was speaking a street language why did god use a common language amen lord my thinking my all that i am i want to give it to you my life i give as a life of water of service take me lord and use me just as i don't make yourself something that you are not just like i am why because you're the one that created me just like i am and it is such a water never was the message complicated it is such a simple thing i wish the church could really i believe if the tabernacle now benefiting on these questions how do you surrender you got your answer right there any questions so far in the message perfect strength brother brown i'm saying so as long as we are trying in ourself and depending on our own abilities and so forth we shall do the bible say without you we can do amen but when we get to a place where we know we are nothing then god can use us the important thing one of the important things that we must master now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike there is one thing that we got to master if we expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of water human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can do water in other words to surrender or to put your car in neutral is to come like you don't know anything amen and make a complete water surrender we cannot use one ability we got to make a complete surrender and to come to god you got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will not your will in you and in me everybody clear so far that is hard i know because we are always wanting to put our part in something that we know we know that we want to do it well say i just know it should be done this way but as long as you are doing it that way it's going to be and god will never use that in other words take your hand off your life it's your life take your hand off of it it's your child take your hand off of it eat your husband get your hand off of your husband take your husband put him in the hand of god amen maybe with the help of the lord we're going to get into that in a few minutes and show you how god cannot use your why is it important in jeremiah 10 23 jeremiah say oh lord i know that man that the way of a man is not in himself it is not in men that worketh to direct his water that's why we are lamb and we must be led by the dove amen for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god sons of god are people that are led they are people that learn how to master the human element to get rid of your intelligence use it on your computer but don't use it to direct your thoughts amen because we have failure to begin with by the way we were birthed everybody clear so far now let's go to the scripture psalm chapter 66. so what you have yesterday you add on to this i believe you got the full answer so i'm not the one who took this minute don't blame me and don't blame that person either so you cover it amen that's a hard question a hard thing to do because the society we're living in we are prone to function like computers we have been programmed for a certain system you got to do this you got to do this to get approved you got to take a credit card you got to swap it and use it and build your credit before you get approved all of that we have been built like that and we function like that so when god come he say i don't need your credit card it's a problem you want to take god and put him in your credit card system which credit card did peter use when they wanted to pay taxes which credit card did they borrow do you know that credit card he was a fish matter of fact he was not a credit card a gift card [Applause] [Music] so you don't have to reimburse it don't you like it he gives the bird of the earth food why do you worry you don't need a ph degree you don't need to be a doctor you don't need it amen some will say my me okay psalm chapter 66 verse 12 if you dare you can say a man we got the high heel clear we got how long your dress should be clear so if you wear a short dress a short skirt that's not my problem the blood is in your hand if you wear a high heel the blood is in your hand not in me when i go to heaven i'll tell god get on youtube it's right there amen i gave them the scripture i gave them the quote psalm 66 verse 12 something acting up okay cool verse 12 you have caused man to ride over our head you might be seated we went through water remember we're back we're going back up to the surface now amen if you're struggling with the territory of the black dog you need to see the deacon you have caused man to rod over our head we went through fire and through water there is two tests here one of them is a test of fire it's a test that burns the other one is a test of water amen we went through fire and through water so the first part you're going through the fire and you thought it's finished no down the road there is another path you're gonna go through water one will burn you one will try to submerge you it will try to submerge you or to overflow you or to take over you to experience that you're going to go through one burned you one will try to take over you amen who did that god cause you to go that path amen but you brought us out into a wealthy place so despite the fact that you went through fire and through water the end result is a wealthy place it's a good place amen verse 13 i will go into your house after david went through this i will go into your house with burn offering i will pay you my vows which my lips have added and my mouth had spoken when i was in trouble so somehow when david was going to trouble maybe it was the trouble of the fire or maybe was the trouble of the water it was so tough until david have to make a promise to god like father if you take me out of this you know what i will do this so as soon as he came out david kept his word and he went to the town to the temple to fulfill what he vowed unto the lord amen verse 15 i will offer to you burnt sacrifice of fatlings with the incense of frames i will offer bullocks with goats sealer come and hear all you that fear god not only am i giving the sacrifice to the lord but when i get into the house of the lord i'm gonna testify like hey everybody that feel the lord coming here hear what how i went through the fire and how i went through the water amen come and heal all you that fear god and i will declare what he has done for my soul anybody clear from my heart i cried to him with my mouth and he was extol with my tongue so in the midst of the crying there was also praises amen it's a praises mixed with crying in other words he hurt but praise the lord for healing me he hurt praise the lord for healing me it's a mixture anybody clear if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me so when you go through this fire and through the water make sure your heart is pure because that's the only way you can get deliverance and be taken out of it amen but verily god has heard me he has attended to the voice of my water so we found out that going through the fire david rely on one element that is called prayer and when he went to the water he still work work with one element which is called prayer so the solution for the fire and for the water is always the same everybody clear verse 20 blessed be god which has not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me everybody clear so far go to psalm chapter 69 blessed be the name of the lord verse 1. if you dare you can say amen save me o god further for the waters are coming into my so this is not a physical water anybody clear it's a water that submerge your soul or your inner being or your inward man or your inward being or your inward woman anybody care save me your god for the waters are come into my soul not my body so this is a spiritual water it is a spiritual fight amen i sink in deep mire where there is no standing in other words it seems like i have been sucked into something that is drawing me so the experience of the water you will feel like you have been sucked everybody care and you are sinking in other words it's a withdrawn something is pulling anybody clear i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the flood did water overflow me remember your overflow is right here it is something that is taking over you it's overwhelming you can control it verse 3 i am weary of my crying so the experience of water makes you weary it will make you sometime cry you look almost like you lost your mind amen i am weary of my crying my throat is dried my eyes fell while i wait for my in other words i'm tired it seems like i can't take it i'm overwhelmed yet i'm still waiting on the lord the water experience because in the book of revelation the bible says that the voice of god is like the voice of many water so these waters sometimes have voices let's go to isaiah 43 amen in psalm we went through the fire a burning experience and we also go to the waters an experience that submerges overflow take over our soul we feel like we're sinking we are sat we are weary we're crying like thoughts coming all over the world experience isaiah 43 amen your question took my time so don't praise me chapter 43 verse one everybody clear but now that says the lord that created you o jacob and he that form you if you notice there is a creation than a form if you go to genesis 1 26 god created man and genesis 2 7 god form the man so the god that created you and form you that is responsible for your soul and responsible for your spirit and your body we clear now okay but now that says the lord that created you your spirit or jacob and he that form you your body or israel fear not if god said fear not there is something there that that can make you afraid fear not for i have redeemed you i have called you by your name you are mine so at the beginning right here god is reminding you that i am your author i am the one that created your body i am the one that created your soul i am the one that created your being and i want you to keep in mind that i am the one that redeem you because according to paul when we talk about the armor of a christian a christian usually have a helmet on the head and the helmet is water it's a salvation the helmet is on the head and the helmet is the helmet of your salvation so god now is telling you remember i saved you remember i redeemed you remember i am the one that called you by name we know that calling it's god pulling into your heart that's why you came because your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world i am the one that called you no one can come to me except the father joseph i am the one that did it you are mine i want you to keep that in your mind why do you have to keep that if you don't have this experience what is going to follow it's going to be a trouble so you must make sure you have isaiah 43 1 first in other words you must make sure you a christian first because that christian experience will give you a helmet [Music] amen that's why david said we store not the salvation amen just the joy of the salvation because the salvation is eternal once god saves you he won't save you to lose you [Music] eternal security hallelujah now watch verse two when you pass through the water that's why i want you to remember where you come from everybody when you pass through the waters anybody clear when you pass through the water come on i won't be with water in other words since i am already in you when you going through the water i am the one controlling the ship that's why you must keep your car in neutral because i need to navigate i'm a submarine i know how to navigate the deep water you don't know deep water i know but you're going to go through the water i will be there [Music] hallelujah karma and through the word rivers they shall not do water because i'm there when you walk through the water you see the first one about here when you walk through the fire one you walking another one you passing amen when you walk like shadrach meshach abednego in the fire we clear now when you walk in the through the fire you shall not be water neither shall they flame kindle upon water so you're gonna go through this experience these experiences are gonna shake you but you're not gonna get burned if i am there anybody here you're gonna go through the waters the water are gonna be tough but they're not gonna overthrow you amen even when peter begin to doubt god and to sink in god reach out and pull him up showing you that if it gets to the point that you are sinking i'm gonna reach out because you are eternally saved amen when you pass when you walk through the fire you shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon you so the fire he burns because he got flames everybody clear let's go to mark 5 then we can pray to experience again the fire and the waters but god will walk you through both of them so make sure you got god if not you get to the fire yes you're gonna get burned amen mark chapter five what are you trying to say today we are going back up to the surface amen we're leaving the deep ocean so make sure you leave everything down there because we're going to soar into new territory like paul say leaving the elementary thing now let's go on to mark 5 24 if you dare you can say amen and jesus went with him and many people followed him and tongue him in other words people were pushing him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years if a woman has an issue of blood this is not a girl okay it's an issue that was not there at first and it started at a certain period which one we have to figure it out but it lasted 12 years what was the cause of this woman losing blood because as she was going she was going through the normal circle of a woman without any problem but come a certain time in her life that something happened and whatever happened troubled her circle and she could not recover what was that okay okay amen and head suffer many things everybody clear of many physicians they try many treatment it's not working amen and head spend all that she had not only was it pain in the treatment but it was also affecting her lifestyle her finances and in other words the household of this man was turned upside down what caused it is not the issue of blood it's what caused the issue of blood that destroyed the entire home anybody clear amen she suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better in other words he was not helping but rather grew worse when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole and immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up anybody clear and she felt in her body so whatever happened in her life affected her body amen and she felt in her body that she was healed of that at the beginning it seems like he was something natural and the devil entering and he became a plug anybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy your presence here this morning and your blessings lord father we are committing again this service unto the hand and we asking that you come and speak to us may you move me completely out of the way and may you move also your children completely out of the way so that it will be you speaking and you hearing because when you hear you hear better than a man father help us out and seal the devil completely out of this place and may nothing else but the spirit of god take a full preeminence and minister to your children as we ambly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen everybody clear so far we're going back up on the surface toward the second banquet we on part 45 when we talk about this chart you already acquainted with it this chart shows the stages of a human life circle circle we start in a conception then we are born born we go to our toddler preschool then we reach adolescence and by reaching adolescence this is when we drop down deep into the ocean and we found out the stuff or the things that an adolescent struggle with we found beer women smoking all this kind of stuff amen then from there you go to adulthood and from adulthood into the uh old age and i explained it to you that this goes like a pyramid because when you are born your birth started right here at the bottom then you're gonna go through a stage and it's gonna be adolescence right here when you move from adolescence you go to your peak of adulthood everybody clear do you remember this then from there you're gonna drop down and it's gonna be another station here and when you drop right here you go all the way down you start as a baby and you're going to end up like a baby somebody changing your diaper in a hospice or in a nursing home somewhere just like they were changing your diaper there if the lord tarry so much you're going to find somebody changing your diaper right anybody clear so something happened here that we dealt with adolescence because when we start here from a childhood and you are born and you go there we know that we are born in sin we are shaping iniquity coming into the word speaking lies and by nature by sex we are born with a wrong nature and we automatically were programmed or geared to do what is wrong in our life that's why you don't you don't teach a child how to lie hard to hide something they automatically know it because of the way they were born everybody clear the only one that was born differently was the lord jesus christ and adam because adam have never had a belly button let me continue everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord so we found out that this during this period here the black dog is covered he's protected it's there it's laying dormant everybody clear until a certain age you're gonna fight to do things that are wrong and everything god knows it under the blood of the lamb then you're going to reach a certain age and things change that is adolescence now when you look at this human life circle from conception all the way to the old age the bible says this we know the solution is prayer that in genesis 2 chapter 16 verse 17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree including the tree of life remember of the garden you may eat freely in other words the tree of life was given to men freely but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the days that you eat thereof you shall surely water in other words when god created man man was not supposed to die man was created to be living eternally ever clear and the solution or the ingredient to eternal life was given in the tree of life and that tree of life the access was given freely to man where anybody can go straight to the tree of life eat and as soon as you partake of the tree of life you will never die for some reason adam never touched that tree they were interested at the apple they were interested eating avocado with eve they were interested eating plums and and strawberries and all kind of fruit and for some reason nothing was attracting them to the tree of life but for some reason the devil pulled them away and moved them to a different attraction which was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and when they ate that tree god told them that the dare you eat you're going to die so in genesis chapter 3 verse 22 the bible says and the lord god saying behold the man is become as one of us to know good and water so if you already know good and evil you know which tree you already beat on about here and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever amen god block the access to the tree of life by putting the kerry beams with a sword of flaming fire so now from this point on men cannot live eternally anybody follow me now your life circle started by birth because when god created adam adam was not created like a baby adam was created a full mature man eve was created a full mature woman but through this death that entered the human race now they're coming into the life you have to come through sex now you start as a baby and it's gonna take you all the way to death everybody here romans 6 23 the bible says for the wages of sin is what that's what they taught them here but the gift of god is eternalized through who that's why brother branham said the tree of life was crossed because christ is the one that have eternal life and if you want to have eternal life you must go into christ everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord now in genesis 5 verse 5 and verse 27 when death was entered into the human race some people begin to die early maybe by murdering like evil some will die in an old age amen but when we look at adam who started in the garden of eden how many years did adam leave the bible says that and all the days that adam leave where 930 years and he did water he died so adam who started in the garden of eden adam the best he could do was 900 and one and thirty years in other words adam never reached a thousand years ago everybody here in other words he never made a day with god in verse 27 the bible says and all the days of methuselah were 969 the only man that went higher than anybody on planet earth was mature and his ears were 960 water but still that was below a thousand years anybody clear so in other words nobody have ever lived a thousand year on earth brother branham says this that he said a man would never leave that time out a year or a day the day you eat thereof the day you die adam or methuselah was the oldest man that ever lived in the bible and he was 969 years old and he never lived that thousand years but the man that is going to live through the millennium ever here one thousand years to show that the penalty has been water ever clear even though jesus went to the cross and died despite the fact that jesus went into the cross and that we are still dying before a thousand years so god have pro have planned a certain time period that everybody that is going to be redeemed will live through that to prove to men that redemption was effective why because one day with the lord is how many years how many know that few people let's go to the scripture yeah if there were a lot we will skip it psalm chapter 90. everybody clear let's go to the book of psalms 90. somebody need to do a lot of reading of the scripture and a lot of listening to the table somnandi if you there you can say amen verse 4 psalm 9 0. anybody clear verse 4 for a water a thousand year in your sat ah but as what when it is passed and as a watch in the a thousand years scripture to god is how many days let's go to second peter chapter three amen don't worry we're gonna get there ii peter chapter three if you dare you can say amen if this light is making you sleepy please turn it on ii peter chapter 3 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen amen but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a water and a thousand years as water so nobody from adam up to now even the lord jesus christ himself nobody reach a thousand years and brother branham now is saying that but that demand that is going to live through the millennium 1000 year to show that the penalty has been paid man lives forever the day is finished the time is finished they are in water eternity take revelation chapter 20 amen blessed be the name of the lord revelation chapter 20 verse 5 who is going to be in the millennium remember that sunday god wants his entire blood to be water praise god somebody remember pretty good revelation 20 verse 5 but the rest of the dead leave not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so there is a first resurrection and there is a second resurrection back home pretty good because we might get into those mysteries amen verse six blessed and holy is he that has put in the first resurrection which is the rapture everybody clear if you sleeping shake somebody else because i can see who's sleeping amen this is the first blessed is blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection on such the second death maybe the second banquet might push this far away there is a first death and there is a second death maybe when we get in a second banquet we might dig into that and you're going to see what do they mean and i'm going to explain it down there because you're going to see armageddon and gog and magog agnes amen blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection on such that person the second death has no power in other words they're not going to experience the second death but there shall be water so those that are going to be in the millennium are priests and king because they must reign in the millennium that's why you are prison king now exercising the authority and in the millennium it will be automatic amen but they shall be preached of god and of christ and shall reign with him how many years a thousand years that's what brother branham is saying here so now from the beginning that we start nobody reach a thousand years everybody is dying somewhere why because men beat on the wrong tree everybody clear so much so far in genesis 6 verse 1 uh 1-3 the bible says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives we already explained to you that there were many women of which they choose we explain you this and the lord say my spirit shall not always strive with men so before this period of time people could live 900 years 800 years 700 years but nobody could reach a thousand years but because sin begin to multiply and to reach a point that is highest on the face of the earth god now shortened even the time that you have to leave no more you shall live 900 years 500 years 800 years 600 years at the beginning you can leave any kind of years that you want only you're not gonna get a thousand years because redemption is not done yet when jesus christ came he shed his blood he brought the redemption of your soul but your body still have the black dog you need to go in the second banquet to kick the black dog out then you are fully redeemed and god ushering through the seventh hill the interest into the millennium so that you can have your person here you cannot have the thousand years with the black dog on your body everybody clear because before sin entered the black dog was sealed out and god want to seal the black dog completely but in order to complete redemption you need a capstone ministry that is going to bring the cloud and the coming of the lord to change your body then you a candidate to go leave a thousand years anybody care so far god begin to give people 900 years if he's a murderer you're going to suffer for 900 years he will be killing for 900 years if he's a fornicator your children will suffer for 900 years god say too much i'm gonna shorten now that how much lord and the lord say my spirit shall not always strive with men for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and a what now no more 906 years we drop down to 120 years which is way below 8 000 years people begin to go 114 105 no problem man still continue to sin in psalm 90 verse 10 the bible says now david comes and david open up a shortening again in other words because men continue to do wickedly god take it and shorten that again the days of our years are water three score years and ten a score in the bible is 20 years so three score is what 60 years anybody clear 60 years and 10. in other words we move from 120 and to utter unto 70. ever here come on and if by reason of strength there be how many four how many score in other words if god is a little bit gracious to you you can go up to eddie amen one time god told the king to prepare himself to die you got that and the king went and prayed unto god even though the time of god was determined for that king but god added 15 more years that's why despite the fact that it was 120 or it's 70 you will see some people going 94 and they died it is just god in his sovereign will extending that everybody here so if grace gets you you're going to go to ab if not grace the normal year is 70. so we move from a thousand to below a thousand then we go below 200. now we got below a hundred so the new set now is 70 years everybody clear and the number 70 have the number seven with it and you have the number zero anybody here and seven two zero you gotta take it ten times everybody clear so far in other words 70 have 10 7. are we following me so when you are born you're gonna reach seven then you go another seven then you go another seven then you go another seven then you go another seven everybody following me i'm climbing i told you i'm going to the surface if you're sleeping good luck can you get that mcafee out cancel it just keep cancer the devil is mad [Laughter] just close the screen you got it okay let's see how it goes praise god we start a lot today thank you very much brother brother i'm saying i have been an erotic all my life as a little boy there was something struck me that scared me about welcome are we okay anybody clear so far brother branham didn't say every eight years he didn't say any 10 years brother branham used the word 70. if you put 70 on 120 doesn't work it's gonna give you 17 points something if you put 70 on eddie it doesn't work the last place that david put 70 goes accurately 10 times amen you take seven ten times everybody clear you take revelation 10 7. ever clear blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said every seven year it will happen to me brother jack remember when i first started come off the field for a year something just happened and you don't know what i have suffered just mental oppression every seven years he comes all my life that is where i am now seven eight brother branham was 56 years old anybody clear so brother branham noticed that in his life every seven years something is happening every seven years something happened blessed be the name of the lord in the message indictment brother branham said now eat it with the changing of the water seven years every seven years your life does well are we okay so with the circle of 70 years when you are born every seven years something is happening in your life you were not just aware of it because you didn't know where are you going brother stephen in the scripture in deuteronomy 15 verse 1 god told moses that at the end of water every seven years that shall make a water god when he was dealing with israel before the 70 70 years to give the rest the full rest to the promised land god told israel for some reason that we don't know every seven years release something every seven years release something every seven years we release something and brother branham come he say every seven years something happened in your life in the message jeremiah 34 verse 14 the bible say at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother in hebrew which has been sold unto thee and when he says serve these six years that shall let him go free from the from thee in other words when you take a hebrew slave and he worked for you for six years on the seventh year you must give him a jubilee trumpet because god watches seven seven seven seven and he put seven ten times everybody clear so far that's why you heard brother branham seven times seven forty nine hey mark here what is going on despite the fact now that our lifetime ever clear have started from zero all the way to 70 and it's divided by many seventy ever clear about here yet when you look through this whole span of life there are two major events that's gonna be the peak of your life are you following me in other words every seven years there is a peak every seven years a peak every seven years a peak but there are two events when they shoot them they're gonna shoot higher and go down and when you continue one is gonna shoot again higher you continue and you got to the end in the message indictment brother branham say now it is really welcome we okay we got menopause thank you what is the other one now it's really menopause in other words the changing of her life remember brother branham said edith was going in the changes of seven everybody clear and her nerves are in such a tremendous condition so there is something in menopause that check your nerves [Music] okay such a tremendous condition and the leader lady has got on her mind that she is water so there is a voice that is talking to her amen she's just she's not she's just not going to leave just from one hour to the other and healthy strong women have terrible time sometimes have to take shots of hormones going into the institution she loves to her everybody clear and take shock treatment and everything during that time the human being has two changes of life you're too big they have the change from boy to a man from a girl to a woman about 16 17 years old they get like a bunch of just fly by night every seven years something happened every seven years something happened when you hit your teenager you going to something really high one time and then it comes down then when you continue your life and you reach menopause it goes high again this is your true explosion here hallelujah and if you can just suffer with them during that age i got a daughter in the edge right now rebecca pray for her and billy oh every one of us we come through the leader frantic age so we must suffer with them realizing it's something they have to water there is no way around it anybody clear so far where are you going brother stephen to the young people i would say this this morning after birthday yesterday of 48 years in this life 20 some some old years of that about 24 years i've spent for the lord jesus as a boy about 23 years old i stop preaching the gospel if there is any regret that i have any regret if i could touch a button this morning and go back the fabulous edge about water and water these edges even though they bring trouble they are precious everybody clear brother branham called that a fabulous age and brother branham is regretting not starting to preach the gospel here hallelujah i would only want to do is for one thing that is to serve christ when when i was a teenager amen as we keep going so we got two edges there one is adolescence one is menopause that hits you in adulthood both of them are the two explosion that is giving you a high peak amen in your life in other words they are the ones that are spicy in your life everybody clear when we dealt with adolescence we found out that in adolescence philio open up when feel your opinion up is because the black dog is released ever clear take ezekiel 16. blessed be the name of the lord we good i have to go slowly so we get it ezekiel 16 we read this over and over ezekiel 16 verse 7 are you there you know at the beginning god passed and this was a child abandoned on the field god spoke life and went now god came the second time we already explained you this let's go to verse seven i who is i the lord i have caused you to do what as the bad of the field and you have increased and works and great and you are come to excellent ornament your breasts are fashioned and your hair is grown whereas you were naked and bare ever clear that was your first reading let's read it together again you ready now i the lord have caused you to multiply as the bird of the field god is saying that when i came the first time you were a baby amen anybody clear now i'm coming the second time you are grown up anybody clear you follow me but this growth that you have doesn't come from satan are we okay i am the one that caused you to grow like the bad of the field everybody clear are we okay now we continue and you have increased in other words the size you getting up the shape you are getting young sister it is not the devil let me help you again the design you are getting is not coming from satan it is god fashioning you from a girl to a woman because preachers say it's certain doing that i'm going by the scripture he says i have increased and works great and you are come to water so god says that the transformation that you are having and the way you grew tall the way you develop your height your stature the way you look now i am the one that did it amen and when i look at you it looks like i have decorated you what i'm looking at at adolescence it is called excellent everybody clear everybody clear relax everybody what are the excellent ornament of god brother robert corden if you look the bible say excellent tournament and did this in other words god is going to describe you what is the excellent ornament we okay number one your breasts are when god look at that to god it's a decoration it's not the devil the devil didn't create the woman his design is by perversion hey but here your breasts are fashioned your hair is grown whereas you were naked and bare in other words the transformation that a woman get a puberty causes hair to be open in a different eyes than the way you look at him are we okay she becomes attractive at the beginning she was not god is the one that caused that and god when he looked at the woman he said i am the one responsible for this ornament i'm the one that shape you i'm the one that gives you this form i'm the one that gives you this curve i'm the one that did all of this and to me it's beautiful it is excellent [Music] everybody whereas you were what naked and bear jump to verse 8. now when i pass by you and look upon you behold your time was the time of water so these ornaments were not put there without a reason they were put there as a preparation or a loading for your marriage everybody here because you entering you are almost ready for filial love amen that's why the youngest sister that was not looking a certain way after adolescence it looks like a new beauty open up she begins to look more beautiful than before the one that causes that transformation chemical in the body called hormone ever here those chemicals are the one responsible for the new sex characteristic that is appearing they are messenger that are building the body different they're telling the body change the voice of that boy and suddenly you woke up in the morning god bless you mommy somebody change it you try to squeak it's not working anymore somebody change it ever care there are chemicals that are they are programming your body a different way because something must happen in your life ever clear so far the bible says this let me go to verse 8 when i pass by you and look upon you behold your time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over you we already explained you this and cover your nakedness if you notice god clothed this woman two times the first time he clothed her in verse eight and the second time she was clothed in verse 10 job to verse 10 with me verse 10 i clove you also with water at the first time on verse 8 she was clothed with the government of god it was a spiritual clothing ever here verse 10 is the natural clothing ever clear because in revelation 10 when man was created first in the garden of eden he was created with our clothes and when we are born we are not born like animals we are born naked about here so when god come in revelation god said i pro i i advise you to get unto me a garment to cover your nakedness that garment is not natural it is a spiritual garment that covers you first to give you a character that you may enter the rapture that garment is the holy spirit that covers your spiritual nakedness first then you can cover your natural one everybody clear so far brother uh uh paul says this knowing not that your body are the members of christ shall i take the members of christ and make them members of her harlot god forbid knowing not that he which is john to the harlot is one body for two says he shall be one flesh but he that is john unto the lord is what your first marriage is a marriage with christ that marriage gives you the character and the wisdom that you need because you're going to go through the fire isaiah 54 verse 5 for that maker in other words that creator the one who created you and from you that maker is done whatever anybody clear so before you get your first house your husband your maker was your husband imam mecca is the husband the lord of hosts is his name and that redeemer the holy one of water so not only is he your redeemer when he redeems you he is your first husband it's the first one that you get in union with him because you're gonna go through the fire and through the water you're gonna go through the first peak and the second peak you need me first before you can go that route that's why i'm stepping closer in adolescence because i know what you're going to go through everybody clear so far proverbs 7 a discern among the youth a young man void of water what happened to him he fell into the heart into the hand of a harlot because he was not united right with christ amen we already went through that brother one of them said if you are a young man dedicate your morale you are a young man a young woman you a young man dedicate your morals dedicate your water dedicate your water dedicate your water dedicate your soul dedicate all you are surrender and let christ work through that what a glorious thing why do we need to surrender you got referred to cross [Music] anybody here you got bridges to go over you got briar patches you got freaking you got woods you got dark places you got the high heel you got the high clam what are you doing someday you shall have to stand and look back see where you come from and you are going to be judged by the course you take put your all your mind and your thoughts on the north star the center of god and don't move from it stay right with it it shall bring you straight like he did the measure right straight to water stay with christ he's gonna bring you to the physical jesus christ in the rapture [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord in the song of solomon chapter 8 solomon says this set me as a seal upon the heart as a seal upon that armor for love failure is strong as water jealousy there is no jealousy in agape is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are the cause of water which has a vehement water vehement flame solomon is saying that they feel your love is a fire experience everybody so when you go through adolescence you're gonna go through fire because feel your love open up but if you are united with christ even though you go through the fire the fire will not burn you if they put you like me shack shadrach abednego i will be in the midst of the fire if you notice they were walking in the fire but the fire were not burning them everybody clear many waters cannot quench love neither can the flood drown it a man will give all his substance of his house for love he would orderly being content in other words you can't quench it first corinthians 7 i say therefore to the unmarried young people and widows lost their husband it is good for them they're bad even as i am but if they cannot contain let them do what for it is better to marry than to utter because it's fire but if this is the fire what is the menopause everybody clear menopause means that your hormones stop before i go any further the excellent ornament that you have is created or make by hormone ever clear hormone gives you the beauty of adolescence clear that's why you shape different you gain weight you change everything change and you just change you look good and back here you you begin to be mindful about what kind of shoe you coming we feed in church you begin to be mindful about your hair before you get in church you're going to spend so much time in the bathroom because you want to look good ever clear so far that beauty is maintained with oil change periodically by the hormone are you there anybody clear the hormone not only are they responsible for the the beauty that you have they are also responsible to maintain that look everybody follow me so when the hormones stop from your body this look is no longer maintained things that were begin to get loose hallelujah message your brother branham you understand what it is sister how old are you do you know what i mean it is water menopause system it's a change of life you just get all kind of feelings there is really water hormone is water seizing in your body and it don't pull out no more don't you let a doctor give you any hormone that is the first case of taking cancer it is cells they are putting into you you keep them out go water and believe who because you are going down through the water what is cancer by the multiplication of cells what are you doing what you are doing just like if you've been taking water and then take off take off of it in other words brother branham said if somebody was smoking marijuana they become addicted to marijuana and their body function with marijuana and when they try to take them to tobacco cessation and they stop marijuana abruptly they're going to go automatically into a depression because the body was depending on that substance to be maintained normal anybody clear biology is in this message and then my you don't know what to do your body actually puts out hormone and now it is not putting out hormone anymore it's a not a natural thing after a while it shall be over but now the devil will run you how if he can but don't you let him do it you look to who right now and be water relax amen brother branham eat it with this changing of seven years every seven years your life changed so seven times seven it makes it kind of water that is a complete 49 years old brother stephen the picture you put there is for women do men go through this you heard that right somebody heard that question and he bothers the women men usually get kind of for what funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives there is no there is no crust to help you cross the water because it's doing what it is sucking you you overwhelmed you were having chemical they took them off you can't live without you lose gps everybody clear but women are unfiltered after that and we all go through that we must remember that it's figs that we must bear with water and understand those water circle of seven everybody clear let's go some people they get it they are water that is the kind that shall do water he said the other kind like women in menopause they do what david said when i go through water what happened and i'm water they're crying you got the can that is kind of water anybody clear but remember when you go through the fire they're not going to burn you when you go to the water it will not survive you because i am there [Applause] hallelujah the old timers used to call it head the water it would not leave them and when that hits you your water and then you are working so it begin to cause trouble in other areas of your body hallelujah maybe it's a woman here might be in time of me in a menopause time that is when whatever everything is wrong with her and there is do we have a demon to cast away okay yet everything is wrong with her and she's not just putting it on she really feels that it's just as real any person that is nervous is that way and don't never want her she just can't control something is sucking her being [Applause] she's all upset she doesn't know why she's upset she's sad she's sinking she's crying she he touched in her mind an explosion happened why hormones are gone anybody clear remember brother brother says this i'm not to read the whole thing that the devil cannot create nothing the devil only perverted he can create he perverts and first he has to have a water ask the doctor if your body was how perfect and like god made it in the beginning it would be what impossible to get sick but the devil have to find a weakness somewhere to do whatever so when the hormone sees and all the muscles and all the body form that you have begin to sunk and something begin to go wrong with your body the devil approaches you at that time because it's a weakness understand blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said this next lady here come sister do you believe with all your heart now here is a woman really in serious trouble the woman is got a water that's why you need the helmet amen isn't that right lady look your worst trouble is in the late of the evening isn't it a long twirled night you get how and water the water comes again where do the water comes in your soul amen you get so weak you can hardly stand up is that right you have to sit down you just call just all torup now what it is lady it is nothing to hurt you about here it's a premature time of the change of life menopause now come here it's a gloomy shadow and it's nothing but a

heal you but i can by the help of god know what is wrong with you you had the heart trouble for a long time we trouble is it her trouble because it is caused from a water because you have a nervous heart when you lay down at night you smother so much especially after eating it create a gas in your stomach that pushes up you belching it's really not a heart trouble you think it is everybody but it's a nervous condition that come on for a long time been there since water menopause started way back in a young woman and you're going to a cardiologist for nothing anybody clear what a problem you have been sick sometime for years back you start getting nervous first having water weary and water then only once you begin to do water something in your mouth your stomach begin to hurt and now you are sick at your stomach that is right you have a peptic ulcer in your stomach caused from nervousness due to what change of water all right come lady what do you think with all your heart you believe you've been nervous for a long time started in menopause which you are still going through he developed an ulcer in your stomach and you got a stomach trouble and your female trouble too that is water nobody knows that but god because who will be in the bathroom at that time being upset without knowing the devil entering and begin to cause trouble hey but clear remember that this beauty here and adolescence was caused by water and it's maintained by water and menopause hormones are not dead so that glow that was accompanying you especially when you have a baby it seems like a woman develop again more down glow begin to vanish and begin to fade away the devil coming into your mind telling you you are now old you don't look good anymore and because of that lie the trouble that happened at puberty amen begin to be manifested in menopause that's why their older sister changed her dresses she make herself looks now sexy because something is telling her you passed your error is finished hallelujah during that time she's got her menopause sometimes especially either come in or what when you entering into the water of menopause and when you want to come out of it amen make the people so nervous and she never been able to pull through that so some people get in the water and stay there that's the woman with the issue of blood 12 years she's still going through that circle some get the lord help you you out everybody the woman thinks sometimes that she's what and she watto and she is a pentecostal believer i think so but the lady had wearing water and water and water but the reason she had did that she was trying to shake from that trying to shake away from that horrible water that's why you see a woman going back and begin to try to make her want the compliment like a young lady she begin to wear pink stuff and all kinds of stuff it's sister he's been trouble because somebody's telling her you don't look good like you used to because hormones are gone and now she's trying to counteract it by trying to make herself beautiful she begins to have the same trouble that you have in adolescence america did it mean you don't have to look good and like some of you sister going through the time of menopause and they give you this hormone shot don't you do it you just trust water hormone is a water you are just putting cancer cell right in but they have don't make too much of it in the prayer line so the thing to do you just put your faith in god and you and your real good honest physician your doctor at home will tell you that is the truth you just have faith in god and trust him he shall take you through the water he is always there to do what when you go through the fire i will be there when you go through the water they said not so merge you i will be there hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord your husband to your wife she's going through this time what do you do will you act like a rock fella or what your husband to your wife when they are in that time of life if she ever was your what you let her be what in other words she need attention because the hormone drawing out is telling her you are not beautiful as you are as you used to be because the maintenance is not there it is up to you to begin to tell her you still look beautiful you let her being right there because she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her talk to her take her up in your arm like she was your in other words start your marriage like you were when you started because her behavior is like a teenager now may the brother say amen you heard them amen talk to her take her up in your arm that she was your sweetheart and she should be understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup what is changing and you must be good to her and what i think that is why mr rockefeller made a fatal mistake he was loved by the nation would have probably been our next president but when his wife took menopause he went in and went in menopause he left her and married his water he could not put up too much with it say uh-uh i can't take this no more wrong amen amen leader edith has gotten this condition she's lost so much what the hormones are no longer there to support your bone your bones begin to get breather they begin to give you vitamin you need to start drinking milk again amen she lost much weight and she looks bad some night not all of you together but just a little trip down they set up with her day and night a little trip down there from this tabernacle this tabernacle and different tabernacles the sisters tabernacle here some of you people go down and see the right family i'm sure they would appreciate it just go down sit with them a little while and talk to them shake their hand if no more than a leader friendly visit not only the brother is responsible to take care of his wife but brother branham bring the responsibility to the church that when someone is going through this time go visit them 14 go and visit the right family and try to do what she read it up now don't tell her she looks bad you better stay in your home than getting into the house and say oh my god because the devil is already telling her oh my god you begin to talk the devil language if you have the devil language don't go there she's already sinking she needs to be uplifted don't tell her she looks bad tell her she looks what she's going to be fine you don't go to a hospital somebody gets a surgery and you say oh thank god it didn't happen to me you better don't come to the hospital amen amen you don't get there and they say oh my god thank god for my hair make them look bad which she shall be all right if we just keep water holding on for her amen that is what we are here for she is our sister we are here to hold on in these times for that child just like i want somebody to hold for me and pray while i was going through my and you want somebody for anybody clear so far let's stand [Applause] when you go through the water they're not gonna submerge you when you go through the fire the fire won't burn you if you are connected with christ amen it's too explosion in your life you gotta go through you're gonna go every seven years something is changing seven years something is changing but you're gonna hit the time where you're gonna go through puberty is gonna put you on fire young people if you connected with christ you're going to go through this without any problem but if you are not connected with crust you're going to go through smoking you're going to go through whiskey you're going to go through beer and all those stuff it's like you putting gas into the fire amen and it's gonna mess you up completely and god will rescue you but with a lot of scar amen but if you have not gone through that yet or you just went and had trouble cling on to crusty you're gonna go through this and you're gonna get stabilized and you go to your marital life and everything goes well and later on it's gonna shoot up again you go into the water but whether you go through the fire or through the water all of them are covered in the atonement if you can just accept it and believe it and never give place to the devil no matter what you go through you say god you say it's not gonna burn me it's not gonna submerge me you already provided a way for escape it's just a period of time it's just like a lady who had pregnancy she's gonna go through headache through certain things but the scripture says when she deliver the baby she's gonna forget all the other stuff once you go through it you're going to realize you're not old as you think you're going to realize you're still beautiful you're going to realize that like the scripture say is bringing you to a wealthy place not to a place of sorrow and trouble amen if the lord willing i will see how i can get it rebecca went through this fire and brother branham and his wife committed rebecca to christ and brother branham said before you know it george smith came up [Music] amen there is a no an oasis that pop up and pick you up and you go to your marriage and when you go to your marriage you're going to go through the water if you stick with christ after the water you're going to see that your couple will reach a different level you're going to find out that your marriage is going to get more sweeter than even when you started before if you cross the water amen you're gonna find out that your husband began to understand you better than before for some reason and you begin to say i wish all my marriage would even started like this because the scripture says when you come out of water you're gonna come into a wealthy place amen because when you start a marriage you didn't have kids amen when you reach the water your kids are almost gone away from you you go back again like a renewal of vow you go into a new cycle of marriage where you and your husband going to the beach going here going to the mall that's why you see all the people holding their head themselves in the hand you don't understand they become more keen together than what they were before and sometimes one goes away first it won't take too long the second one might follow because what happened after that is a relationship closer than even their own brother they'll feel more like they belong to each other like they can't live without one another it happened more after you go through the water god is not the author of confusion after this pressure there is always something better after this pressure there is always something better after the rain there is always a beautiful time the sun will shine let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy father for helping us touch this story of life adolescence and menopause father i don't know who's going to the trouble of adolescence i don't know who's about to enter into that trouble i don't know who's about to leave that trouble i don't know who is in that trouble and already making a mistake and they're probably listening virtually or streaming lord i don't know who's going to sooner enter menopause i don't know who is already in menopause i don't know who just came out of menopause i don't know who enter menopause and never shake or shook away from it and still lingering like the woman that suffered 12 years father whatever condition or whatever stage your children are in we asking for your grace and for your mercy to come in their life individually and further help them cross these steps lord father you gave us a promise in your word you say that when we go through the fire they're not gonna burn us lord you say when we go through the water it will not overflow nor submerge us lord because you're gonna be with us lord father may you help our sisters may you help our brother to relax may you help us receive these things in our heart knowing lord father that you send this truth so that the devil would not ride again in the life of your children father so that we will not open any door to the devil and to find ourself fighting and suffering some illness lord because of lack of knowledge lord father you have brought this light of knowledge to free your children and to bring a complete deliverance lord and for those that are suffering or those that have been already overtaken by the devil where lord father they thought that something was wrong with them or they are already in the middle of menopause and they can't shake away or since they went through menopause there is something in their body that is no more no longer quite right since they went through this time something went wrong and it's still like a condition that they are condoning that they think it's normal that they should bear the rest of their life father if there is any young man any young woman that went through this trouble and because of the background or the way that they were breed or the way lord father they grew up they didn't have somebody to lord father train or help them lord but they found themselves as victim of circumstances victim of passion victim of the trouble of menopause or the trouble of adolescence lord father it's not too late lord you the god that delivered these women that we read through your prophet and you still the same god today lord you the same yesterday today and forever and father i'm asking and praying lord father pleading for your mercy to come lord that every word that therefore brought a plug brought a a situation in the body or a spirit entering that brought in a spirit of being a spirit of smoking a spirit of lust a spirit of lord fornication all kind of demon lord father that brought pressure funny feeling weariness at night lord father we rebuke those demonic spirits away from your children set them turn the children of god lord live the life of the children of god go to the dry places may the holy spirit come down and take over the lord father and bring a total and complete deliverance to your children father we family ask it lord in the name of jesus christ may you continue to work lord and minister to the life of your children as we ambly ask it and commit them unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you church we love you [Music] some through the water the sun through the flower some through the fire but all through the blood summed through great sorrow but god gives a song [Music] in the night season and all the day i want to sing one verse this afternoon
