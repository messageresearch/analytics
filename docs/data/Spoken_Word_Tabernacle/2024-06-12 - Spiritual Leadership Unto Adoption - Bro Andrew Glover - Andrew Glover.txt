Whether you a pastor, you a teacher, you are evangelist, you an apostle, whoever you are, Ephesians 4 under Malachi 4. We clear on that one. That's the position that we stand in this church. That's why we quote brother Brandham say ah that's the one that we can quote here. We quote the Bible and the message of the hour. That's it. Amen. We can appreciate one another. We can pull from somebody else. But what we are standing on is what the prophet said. Amen. Amen. So let's go with only believe and pull on the gift of the Lord. We love brother Andrew. Wonderful. And this is his second home. And we love brother Sean Martin and everything they're doing for the kingdom and him being available. I was talking to brother Maurice today. I say we just gracious this year that I can get him like this because usually if you know him better, it's hard. You have to schedule six month down the road or something just to get this man right here. But but God's grace this year is a special year. God is doing many things. Amen. So let's go with only believe. Only believe. [Music] Oh, we believe [Music] all things are impossible. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All they believe, all things are possible. Only believe. Oh, and Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. [Music] Oh Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Amen. How many believers do we have here tonight? Amen. We know that wherever believers are, something good always happens. Amen. And looking around tonight and see so many, Amen. Not just believers, but genuine believers and faithful believers. And Amen. The devil give you every reason not to believe, but here you are still believing. Amen. Because that's who you are. Amen. As a believer, amen. What an honor it is tonight to be in the house of God. And want to thank you, brother Steven, once again, for the opportunity, the invitation to be here. Amen. Amen. We want to just say it's a real privilege to be uh speaking to you once again tonight. And if you have your Bibles, we want to go straight to the word. We want to turn to the book of St. John the 16th chapter. Amen. We want to look there tonight. And we just want to greet you all on behalf of our pastor, Brother Shawn Martin. And the saints there at Faith Tabernacle said to be sure and greet you all tonight. And amen. Also want to bring you bring you greetings from a dear friend of your alls, brother Emanuel Salazar. Amen. From out there in Espanola, New Mexico. We were just there with him this weekend for some meetings and just the Lord done some wonderful things there. So we sure want to I know he'd want us to greet you all for him and Amen. So you all remember us in prayer. We're here tonight and flying out tomorrow to California and then Tuesday to Australia. So you all keep us in your prayers and Amen. We'll be praying for you and we'll see you when we get back on this side. Amen. Amen. The book of St. John the 16th chapter in the 13th verse. We want to read there in St. John 16 and verse number 13, the Bible says, "How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth." For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show you things to come. Amen. Now, Brother Bram says, in other words, he'll be the one that will reveal the thing you see. So, you're going to be looking at something, but when the spirit of truth comes, he will lead you, guide you, or show you what you're looking at. Now, in the book of Romans, the eth chapter, Romans chapter 8 and verse number 14, Romans chapter 8 and verse number 14, I just want to read a very, very familiar uh reading there in Romans 8 and verse 14. Yes, sir. The Bible here says, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Amen. Now, we have just identified the spirit of truth of John 16 as the spirit of God in Romans 8. That's leading the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption. Now, Brother Brham says, "I've come, God, rich in mercy." He says, "I've come to get you away from this fear and scare that you don't know who you are. You're not going to be the sons of God. You always were the sons of God." So, we're not going back to an up and down lifestyle of one day I'm a son, the next day I'm not. But we're receiving the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ab. Now watch. And the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, not that we will be, but that we are the children of God. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts together tonight. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. We thank you for the anointing, Lord, that we feel in the building tonight. Lord, it's more than just a song anointing or a music anointing, but Lord, it's the anointing of Isaiah that destroys the yoke of the enemy. And Lord, as we look into your word tonight, I pray that you would open the windows of heaven. And Lord, may you fill this this building, this room tonight with the anointing of revelation. Lord, may confusions be broke. May unbelief be broke. Father, I pray that you would send strength into every heart here tonight. And Lord, we'll be sure to give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all the believers says, "Amen." And amen. God bless you tonight. As you may have your seats here tonight, I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments, I want to speak to you here. And if I title this tonight, I want to speak to you on spiritual leadership unto adoption. Spiritual leadership unto adoption. Now, you all know that the prophet of God said that we were predestinated unto adoption. So, we were not just predestinated just to be predestinated, but we were predestinated unto something. And what we were predestinated unto is adoption. Now, when we speak of this adoption, we're not speaking of a natural adoption, but rather we're speaking, amen, of a spiritual adoption. So, amen. If you're going to get somewhere spiritual, you're not going to do it naturally, but you're going to have to do it by the spirit. If you're going to get somewhere naturally, you're going to have to do it naturally. So if it was a natural adoption, then there would be a natural leadership unto that adoption. But this is not a natural adoption. This is a spiritual adoption. Amen. So there must be a spiritual leadership to arrive. Amen. At that spiritual adoption. Now, brother Ben preaches a sermon. It's amazing. End of his ministry, right before he goes off the earth, he preaches a sermon called leadership. And he said, "Now remember this that each one of us, young and old, your first step you ever made in your life, Amen, someone had to lead you." That's exactly right. And the last step you ever make, someone will be leading you. Amen. Someone has to lead. Now, I've met people, they say, "Well, I'm my own leader." In all reality, that's not the truth. Amen. Something is leading you. You're you're either being led by by God. Amen. Or you're being led by the devil. But something is leading you. See, because God has likened us unto sheep. And if anyone knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep, Amen. then you know that a sheep cannot find his way around. Amen. He has to be led. So, Amen. A sheep cannot find his way. Amen. He has to be led. Even in the slaughter pins, we find that they bring the sheep there and he's led up into the slaughter by a goat. Amen. A goat leads him up. Then when he gets to the end, he jumps out. Amen. And the sheep goes right on in the slaughter. Amen. Because we find that a sheep cannot find his way around. Amen. Now, let's let's take that a step further. Amen. Do you realize that people are not going to find their way into tribulation? Amen. But there's something leading them into tribulation. Now you all know the Bible says that the blind lead the blind and they all fall into a ditch. Amen. Do you realize that creeds and dogmas is leading people, Amen, into a tribulation? Amen. But at the same time, AMEN. THERE'S A BRIDE ON THE earth that's being led, Amen, not by the enemy, BUT BY GOD WHO IS THE SPIRIT of truth. Listen, the spirit of error is leading people to tribulation. AMEN. BUT THE spirit of truth is leading the bride, amen, to the TRANSLATION OF HER BODY. LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK TONIGHT, BUT I WANT TO tell you what you ought to be thinking. YOU OUGHT TO BE FAKING GOD. THAT HE SENT A PROPHET THAT HE SENT A MESSAGE IN THIS GENERATION. THAT HE WOULD CALL YOU FROM THE IDEAS. HE WOULD CALL YOU FROM THE TRADITIONS OF RELIGION and would place you underneath an anointing. Amen. That had the ability to lead you to a brighter future. Amen. Than where the world is headed. Hey, I think it's a powerful thing to know. Amen. That we're not just going through the Bible on our own. Amen. But the spirit of truth, amen, has returned to the church and he is leading us through the word. Now, you all know that that brother Brandham was a lover of the Bible. How many knows that? Amen. Brother Brandham loved the Bible. He would say things like this. I love to study the Bible. He said, I like to take the books of the Bible. Amen. And just study through them. You all, you all know that he he said one time he preached a series on Genesis and then he went through Exodus and when he preaches the kinsman redeemer, he takes time to show you how that they were wanting to put the book of Ruth out of the Bible. He said, "But no, God would not let him put it out." Amen. Because there was a hidden secret of redemption in there. Amen. Then he comes and preaches the book of Ephesians. And he would preach the Hebrew series. HE HE WOULD PREACH THE BOOK OF REVELATION. He said, "See in adoption part three," he said, you know, I'd like to take time where we could get on the book of Hebrews or the book of Exodus, how God Exodus bringing out his people out of Egypt. Amen. In Exodus, a very beautiful type. Amen. Of us now getting ready for our Exodus. Amen. Oh, it's such a beautiful thing. Amen. The whole scripture just ties together. Amen. And it's one big story. AMEN. I SAY WE OUGHT TO WE OUGHT TO REJOICE TONIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. THAT WE DID NOT RECEIVE A THEOLOGIAN. WE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A REFORMER. WE DID NOT RECEIVE some philosopher or some commentator. Amen. That was probing at things IN THE WORD. BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED A DIVINELY SENT PROPHET OF GOD THAT HAS THE ABILITY, AMEN, TO TAKE GENESIS and to take Exodus and to take Ruth and Hebrews and Revelation, amen, AND SAY, "LISTEN, THIS IS NOT A HISTORY LESSON. AMEN. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING JUST HISTORICAL. BUT THERE'S A REVELATION laying here. And if you CAN CATCH THE REVELATION, IT WILL LIFT YOU OUT OF THIS EARTHLY DIMENSION and will place you into HEAVENLY PLACES. HEY, I SAY THANK GOD THAT WE'VE received a heavenly MESSAGE WITH A HEAVENLY ANOINTING WITH A HEAVENLY POWER. LISTEN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN ERROR. AMEN. WE'VE RECEIVED the spirit OF TRUTH. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY THE DAYS OF MAKING excuses for error ought to be over. COME ON. IT OUGHT TO BE LONG GONE. THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. 40 YEARS AGO, IT WAS OKAY CUZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE COMPUTERS and they didn't have the things THAT WE HAVE NOW. AMEN. BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO ERROR IN A MESSAGE PULLPIT WHEN WE'VE GOT WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT. NOW, COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. IF WE GOT A MESSAGE and it's a vindicated message, THERE SHOULD BE NO PERSONAL IDEAS. AMEN. ON ONE SUBJECT IN THIS BIBLE IN A MESSAGE PULLPIT. WE OUGHT TO COME BACK TO THE LANDMARK OF THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR AND SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. SEE, it's tying the picture together. Now, you all KNOW IN THE BIBLE, AMEN, THAT Jesus himself instructed us, amen, to examine the scriptures. He said, "Search the scriptures." Amen. For in them you think you have eternal life. Amen. and they are they which testify of me. Brother said, "Oh, I just love this word, these old nuggets." See, I'm a prospector. I like to dig down and get the nuggets and polish them up. Amen. And hang them out there. Amen. Everyone you find will point to Calvary. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO, A PROPHET was digging through the scripture. Amen. TO FIND THE GOLDEN NUGGETS. AMEN. TO TIE THEM TOGETHER AND TO PLACE THEM BEFORE THE CHURCH AND SAY, "NOW, YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR WAY TO CALVARY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY DENOMINATION. YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR WAY TO CALVARY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY EDUCATION. BUT IF YOU'LL COME BACK UNDERNEATH the spirit of truth, he will lead YOU AND HE WILL GUIDE YOU ALL THE WAY TO THE PLACE OF TRANSFORMATION, which is Calvary." Amen. Amen. I'm going to slow down here. I'm going to slow down here for just a second and I'm going to read you something from the book of Acts, the 8th chapter and the 26th verse. And I want you to see, amen, that it takes spiritual leadership, amen, to go through the scriptures. That's right. In Acts chapter 8:26, the Bible says, "And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philillip," AMEN. SAYING, "ARISE, AND GO TOWARDS THE SOUTH, UNTO THE WAY THAT GOETH down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is a desert." And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a unic of great authority under Cadence, the queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning and was sitting in his chariot. Amen. READING ISAIAH THE PROPHET. AMEN. HE WAS READING THE BIBLE. HE HAD THE BIBLE. HE WAS READING WHAT ISAIAH SAID. BUT THEN THE SPIRIT said unto Philillip, Amen, go near and join thyself to this chariot. That's right. And Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said, "UNDERSTANDEST THOU WHAT THOU READEST?" AND HE SAID, "HOW CAN I ACCEPT some man?" AMEN. SHOULD GUIDE ME. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. PEOPLE SAY WE'RE MAN FOLLOWERS. AMEN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WE'RE A MAN FOLLOWER, YOU GOT TO SAY THIS MAN WAS BECAUSE HE WAS HOLDING THE BIBLE AND HE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE WAS READING. BUT WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, AMEN, COME UPON THE SITUATION, HE CARRIED HIM AWAY INTO THE SPIRIT. AMEN. AMEN. NOW WATCH. HE SAID, "HOW CAN I except some MAN SHOULD GUIDE ME?" And he desired Philillip that he would come up and sit with him. The place of the scripture which he read was this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. And like a lamb dumb before his sheer, so he opened NOT HIS MOUTH. IN his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. And who shall declare his generation? For his life is taken from THE EARTH. GO AHEAD. OH, CAN I AMEN. CAN I JUST BREAK IN ON AMEN. HERE'S A MAN READING SOMETHING. AMEN. AND NOT EVEN REALIZING HE'S A PART OF WHAT HE'S READING. NOT EVEN REALIZING THAT HE IS A PART OF THE SEED THAT WILL DECLARE THE GENERATION. PREACH MY BROTHER, PREACH. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS WHEN I READ GENESIS AND I READ EXODUS AND I READ HEBREWS AND I READ THE BOOK OF RUTH. I READ THE BOOK OF REVELATION AND I HAD NO IDEA, BROTHER EMANUEL, THAT I WAS A PART OF WHAT I WAS READING. BUT IN THE EVENING TIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT. GOD WOULD SEND A PROPHET TO THIS GENERATION WITH THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY WHAT YOU'RE READING IS WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE TAMAR. YOU ARE RUTH. YOU ARE REBECCA. YOU ARE THE BRIDE. YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. YOU ARE THE NEW JERUSALEM. YOU ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. HEY, YOU ARE THE SEED THAT SHALL POSSESS THE GATES OF EVERY ONE OF ITS ENEMIES. GLORY. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HAD NO IDEA. BUT GOD WOULD SEND A PROPHET. YES, MY BROTHER. TAKE YOUR TIME. AND THE UNIC ANSWERED PHILILLIP, TAKE YOUR TIME. AND SAID, WELL THEN I PRAY THEE of whom speaketh the prophet this OF HIMSELF OR OF SOME OTHER MAN? THEN PHILIP OPENED HIS MOUTH AND BEGAN at the same scripture and preached UNTO HIM JESUS. THAT'S RIGHT. AND AS THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY, they came UNTO A CERTAIN WATER. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE UNIC SAID, see here is water, what do hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, if thou believest with all thine heart, come on. Any man, if any man's going to lead you, the first thing he's GOING TO DO IS CHALLENGE YOUR BELIEF. THAT'S IT. HE'S GOING TO SAY, "IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, THAT'S IT. THEN ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE." THAT'S IT. IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, NOT EVEN CANCER will stand in THE WAY OF YOUR PRAYER. AMEN. Come on, church. YOU KNOW I'M IN THE MESSAGE. THE HARDEST THING, THE HARDEST THING THAT GOD HAS EVER HAD TO DO is to get one mortal to believe another. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IT WAS EASY TO BELIEVE WILLIAM BRANDHAM? IT'S BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ONE MORTAL BELIE. IT WAS A BELIEVER BELIEVING THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH THAT WAS PROMISED TO RETURN to them and to lead THEM INTO ALL TRUTH. LISTEN, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CHOKE ON WHAT A PROPHET SAID. BUT BECAUSE I HAVE A SEED IN MY SOUL, I CAN'T CHOKE ON IT. I'VE GOT TO PREACH IT. I CAN'T CHOKE ON IT. I'VE GOT TO AGREE WITH IT BECAUSE I FOUND MY PLACE IN the word of God. I BELIEVE THAT HE IS JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD. GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S WHAT PHILIP SAID. HE SAID, I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD. ARE YOU HEARING ME? ARE YOU HEARING ME? AMEN. WHAT DID HE WHAT WHAT DID THIS person get him to acknowledge? Did he GET HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHO HE WAS? NO. The first thing he did was get him to acknowledge that Jesus Christ, Amen, IS THE SON OF GOD. AMEN. COME ON, YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THIS PROPHET DID BEFORE HE WENT ANYWHERE. BEFORE HE DID ANYTHING, HE GOT YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY BEGOTTEN son of the almighty God. Amen. Glory to God. I've met people, THEY SAY, "WELL, YOU ALL ARE FOLLOWING A MAN." WELL, WELL, COME ON, CHURCH. ARE WE REALLY FOLLOWING A MAN? NO. ARE WE REALLY FOLLOWING A MAN? NO. IF WE WERE FOLLOWING a man, we would hear more about the man than we do THE GOD. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT I HEAR MORE ABOUT THE GOD ON THEM TAPES than I hear about the man BECAUSE IT WAS NOT NATURAL LEADERSHIP. It was spiritual leadership returning TO THE CHURCH. YES, MY BROTHER. I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST is the son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they went down both into the water, both Philillip and the unic. And he baptized him. Are y'all ready for this? Go ahead. And when they were come up out of the water, the spirit of THE LORD CALLED AWAY PHILILLIP that the unic SAW HIM NO MORE. THAT'S RIGHT. AND he went on his way rejoicing. THAT'S RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, PHILILLIP HAD TO DECREASE. COME ON. AMEN. PHILIP HAD TO DECREASE. And the one that HE INTRODUCED THE UNIT TO HAD TO INCREASE. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT HOUR YOU'RE LIVING IN? HEY, WILLIAM BRANDHAM INTRODUCED US TO JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD. HE FINISHED THE SEALS AND SAID, "I HAVE NOW INTRODUCED TO YOU THE ALL AND ALL. HE IS NOW HERE. NOW I MUST DECREASE AND HE MUST INCREASE." WELL, I THINK IT'S TIME TO SHOUT ALOUD. I THINK IT'S TIME TO REJOICE. I THINK IT'S TIME TO PRAISE GOD. WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING A MAN. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH THAT HAS RETURNED IN THIS GENERATION TO LIBERATE US FROM THE SPIRIT OF ERROR AND TO COME BACK TO THE SPIRIT of truth. HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT A CRAZY MAN. I GOT CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT. YES, MY BROTHER. I MUST DECREASE. THAT'S RIGHT. AND HE MUST INCREASE. YES, MY FRIEND. THE ONE YOU JUST MET HAS GOT TO BECOME THE PREEMINENT ONE. THE ONE I JUST INTRODUCED YOU TO HAS GOT TO BECOME THE FOCUS OF YOUR LIFE. THE ONE I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT. HAS GOT TO BECOME YOUR LORD. HE'S GOT TO BECOME YOUR SAVIOR. WELL, SPOKEN WORD TABERNACLE. MAY I SAY THIS? IT'S TIME TO LET JESUS CHRIST BECOME THE PREEMINENT ONE. In our singing, IN OUR PREACHING, IN OUR TEACHING, IN OUR WORSHIP, IN OUR PRAYERS, IN OUR FAITH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. LET JESUS, LET JESUS INCREASE. PREACH. GLORY TO GOD. I MUST DECREASE. And he MUST INCREASE. TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME. NOW TAKE YOUR TIME. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. GLORY TO GOD. THAT ETHIOPIAN unic got in the spirit and the prophet OF GOD SAID THAT JOHN WAS IN THE SPIRIT SIR TO RECEIVE TREMENDOUS REVELATION THAT WAS FRESH FROM JESUS. HE SAID THEN WE need to be in the spirit. THAT'S RIGHT. TO UNDERSTAND the revelation that God has given us to live by in his word. Amen. For it is the same spirit. Amen. Amen. Amen. SO THE SAME SPIRIT that wrote the Bible is here interpreting the Bible and is leading you into your position in that Bible. Brother said, "Look at it this way." He said, "All too many." Thank you. HE SAID, "ALL TOO MANY, they read the Bible where it says in Acts 2:38, repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION of sin, and you shall receive the gift OF THE HOLY GHOST." AND THEY JUST PASS RIGHT ON. SEE, THEY DON'T SEE IT. HE SAID, "BUT IF THEY SAW IT BY GETTING IN THE SPIRIT, they would know. They would know THAT IF THEY WANTED TO RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, THEY need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus." And then GOD WOULD BE DUTY BOUND TO FULFILL HIS WORD by filling them WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEY NEVER GET in his spirit OR IT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM EXACTLY as the word says. YES, SIR. PRAY TO GOD FOR A revelation by his spirit. That is the first step. Amen. Get in the spirit. YES, MY FRIEND. I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M HERE. I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET IN THE SPIRIT AGAIN. I THINK WE'VE SEEN ALL THE PROBLEMS. WE'VE SEEN ALL THE ISSUES. WE'VE SEEN ALL THE SITUATIONS. AND YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE SEEING THEM IS BECAUSE WE'RE TOO EARTHBOUND. AH, COME ON. WE'RE TOO EARTH BOUND. YES, SIR. COME ON. AMEN. AMEN. WE'RE TOO EARTHBOUND. It's either one or two things. We're too earthbound OR WE'RE TOO BACKSLID. AH, PREACH. BECAUSE IF YOU WAS IN A REAL REVIVAL, LISTEN. AMEN. THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT'S HAPPENING NOW WAS HAPPENING WHEN YOU FIRST GOT SAVED. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU WERE SO IN LOVE WITH JESUS. THAT'S NONE OF THE PROBLEMS GOT YOUR ATTENTION. NONE OF THE GOSSIP GOT YOUR EAR. NONE OF THE SITUATIONS CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION. HEY, BUT YOU GOT OUT OF REVIVAL. I SAY, BUT OH GOD, COME IN OUR MIDST TONIGHT AND CARRY US AWAY IN THE SPIRIT AND LET US SEE YOU IN THE REVELATION OF YOUR WORD as declared BY THE PROPHET OF THIS GENERATION. GET IN THE SPIRIT, CHURCH. YES, SIR. LET ME JUST USE ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION. SUPPOSE YOU NEED HEALING. WHAT DOES THE WORD SAY? WELL, WE'VE ALL READ IT COUNTLESS TIMES, BUT DID NOT get in the spirit when reading it. That's it. Did we ask GOD FOR HIS SPIRIT TO TEACH US? OH, NOW WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE. SO, WE'RE NOT JUST ASKING FOR THE SPIRIT TO EXCITE US OR TO EMOTIONALIZE US. WE'RE ASKING FOR THE SPIRIT TO TEACH US THE REAL TRUTH OF IT. AMEN. AMEN. BROTHER KELLY, THE SPIRIT HAS RETURNED TO THE CHURCH TO DO MORE THAN JUST MAKE US SHOUT, TO DO MORE THAN JUST MAKE US DANCE, TO DO MORE THAN JUST MAKE US PROPHESY OR SPEAK IN TONGUES. WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTAL BABIES OR EAGLES. WE'RE SEE JEANS OF GOD. AND THE SPIRIT HAS RETURNED TO TEACH US THE WORD. YES, MY BROTHER. GLORY. NOW, Y'ALL KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. YOU ALL KNOW I'M TELLING the truth. The spirit has returned to teach us the word. Now, if we did, WE WOULD CALL THE ELDERS, CONFESS OUR SINS, be anointed AND PRAYED FOR, AND THAT WOULD be that. It might not come immediately, BUT IN HIS SPIRIT. YES, SIR. COME ON, CHURCH. IN HIS SPIRIT, IT'S ALL OVER. DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU COULD STILL BE SICK AND BODY, BUT OH, GOD, BUT GET IN THE SPIRIT AND IT'D ALL BE OVER. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. COME ON, CHURCH. YES, SIR. YOU COULD STILL BE SICK IN THE BODY. THAT'S RIGHT. THE SYMPTOMS STILL BE THERE. BUT YOU COULD GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT. AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU COULD GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT THAT THE SYMPTOMS COULDN'T BOTHER YOU. AMEN. I feel good. YES, YOU GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT THAT THE ISSUES DON'T BOTHER YOU. YOU GET SO CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT THAT THE CHATTER CHATTER CHATTER DON'T BOTHER YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING. YOU MET JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, AND YOU'RE REJOICING. GLORY, GLORY. THERE'S NO OTHER COURT OF APPEAL. There's no other court of appeal. GOD WILL FULFILL HIS WORD. THAT'S IT. OH, HE SAYS we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done. Don't go through the acts first, but get in the spirit and then go through the acts and then watch what God will do. My goodness. My goodness. Amen. NOW WATCH WHEN A PROPHET WHEN HE COMES AMONG us and begins to take these BOOKS OF THE BIBLE AND BEGINS to teach us. Look how that he approaches the book of Revelation in the church ages. HE SAID, "YOU WILL RECALL THAT I MENTIONED at the beginning of this message that this book we're studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages." THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THEN I MENTIONED THAT IT TAKES THE HOLY SPIRIT to give us revelation or we'll fail to get it. Bringing these two thoughts together, you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make THIS BOOK REAL. NO SIR. NO SIR. ORDINARY STUDYING AND THINKING WILL NOT MAKE THIS BOOK REAL. NO SIR. IT IS GOING TO TAKE THE OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST. THAT MEANS THIS BOOK CANNOT BE revealed to anyone but a special CLASS OF PEOPLE. AMEN. COME ON CHURCH. WE BELIEVE IN THE OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE FIRST POOL. THAT'S RIGHT. WE BELIEVE IN IT IN THE SECOND POOL. BUT YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE STOPPED WAS WHEN IT COME TO THE THIRD POOL BECAUSE THE FLESHLY MANIFESTATION AND THE SPIRIT REALM MANIFESTATION WAS NOT OPERATING IN THE THIRD POOL LIKE IT WAS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL. BUT CAN I SAY THIS? THE OPERATION of the third pool was A GREATER OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAN THE FIRST AND SECOND POOL. YES SIR. YES MY BROTHER. YES SIR. BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE ONE WITH PROPHETIC INSIGHT. THAT'S IT. IT WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO HEAR FROM GOD. IT WILL REQUIRE SUPERNATURAL INSTRUCTION, NOT JUST A STUDENT COMPARING VERSE WITH VERSE. BUT THAT IS GOOD. AMEN. AMEN. I'm I'm just now getting to my FOUNDATION POINT. BUT A PROPHET SAYS THIS. WILL YOU HEAR THIS? But a mystery REQUIRES THE TEACHING OF THE SPIRIT OR IT NEVER BECOMES CLEAR. NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. IT REQUIRES THE TEACHING OF THE SPIRIT OR IT NEVER BECOMES CLEAR. NOW, NOW, NOW I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING IF THAT'S OKAY. TAKE YOUR TIME. PEOPLE HAVE DISMISSED TEACHING BECAUSE OF UNANED TEACHING. THAT'S IT. WELL, WE DON'T NEED TEACHING. WE DON'T NEED TEACHING. AND I TELL YOU WHY THEY DON'T THINK WE NEED TEACHING IS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED, AMEN, IS EVER SIXOOT ICICLE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A BIT OF ANOINTING INVADED A PULPIT AND WE CALLED HIM A TEACHER. PREACH TO MY BROTHER. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, I BELIEVE IN BIBLE TEACHING. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH SOMETHING, MAKE SURE THERE'S SOME ANOINTING ON IT. Make sure there's some dynamics. COME ON, CHURCH. MAKE SURE IF YOU'RE GOING TO LAY THE MECHANICS OUT, WHEN THE DYNAMICS COME, THERE'S SOMETHING TO STRIKE THE DYNAMICS. THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. AMEN. AMEN. YOUR PASTOR HERE IS A VERY A very a very student of this message. I've heard some of HIS SERMONS AND HOW HE LAYS THINGS OUT AND HOW HE DIGS INTO things and HOW HE TEACHES THINGS. SERVICE IN AND SERVICE OUT, RIGHT? AMEN. Can I SAY THIS? I CAN TELL THAT'S A HOLY GHOST GIFT OF TEACHING. BECAUSE WHEN I COME IN AND BEGIN TO PREACH THE WORD, AMEN. THE FIRE IS NOT FALLING ON DEAD WOOD. BUT THERE'S SOME MECHANICS LAYING THERE THAT WHEN THE DYNAMICS BEGINS TO STRIKE IT, THERE IS A SPIRITUAL CONFESSION AND THERE'S A PRAISE AND A SPONTANEOUS PRAISE AND FAITH BEGINS TO RAISE. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? I SAY, GOD FORBID WE EVER CLOSE THE DOOR ON THE ANOINTED TEACHING OF THIS MESSAGE. PREACH. PREACH. I KNOW WHAT PREACH. I KNOW WHAT GUYS DO. THEY SAY, "WELL, WE DON'T NEED NO TEACHING BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED NO TEACHING BECAUSE TEACHING DOES AWAY WITH ALTAR CALLS AND TEACHING DOES AWAY with prayer lines and teaching DOES AWAY WITH EMOTION." NO. IF YOU'RE TEACHING THIS MESSAGE, WHEN the rain begins TO FALL, COME ON. IF THERE'S A LATTER RAIN, THERE HAD TO BE A FORMER RAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE FORMER RAIN WAS A TEACHING RAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THE LATTER RAIN WAS A HARVEST RAIN. AND WHEN THE HARVEST RAIN BEGINS TO FALL ON THE SEED, IF IT'S GOOD SEED, IT'LL BRING FORTH A GOOD CROP. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. HALLELUJAH, PREACHER. GLORY TO GOD. I SAY GET BACK IN THE BOOKS. BREAK OPEN THE TAPES AND START TEACHING AGAIN WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WE'RE NOT PENTECOSTALS. WE'RE MESSAGE BELIEVERS. GLORY TO GOD. GLORY TO GOD. PREACH. TEACH THE MYSTERIES. YES, SIR. PREACH. BUT MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GET DONE TEACHING, IT'S STILL NOT A MYSTERY. THAT'S IT. [Music] GLORY. TEACH THE PARABLES. BUT MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GET DONE TEACHING THEM, IT'S NOT STILL A PARABLE. BUT MAKE SURE THE SPIRIT HAS COME IN THE CHURCH BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT THERE'S A REALITY. YES, MY BROTHER. WE OUGHT TO PREACH THE SEVENTH SEAL SO WE CAN SHOUT DOWN THE AISLE. WE OUGHT TO PREACH THE THIRD SO WE CAN'T STAY IN OUR SEATS. WE OUGHT TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE UNTIL THERE'S A FIRE IN EVERY HEART. THAT'S RIGHT. GLORY TO GOD. GLORY TO GOD. I FEEL GOOD IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER. WOO. GLORY. I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER. I BELIEVE WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT. YES, MY BROTHER. PREACH. And I BELIEVE IT OUGHT TO BE TAUGHT. YES, MY BROTHER. TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM GOD. YES, SIR. AND LAY OURSELVES OPEN. YES, SIR. AND BECOME YIELDED. YES, MY BROTHER. SOMEBODY SAY YIELDED. YIELDED TO THE SPIRIT OF GOD. YES, SIR. AND KNOW. YES, SIR. NOW, you all have to agree. Uhhuh. The spirit. Yes, sir. IS THE AUTHOR YES, SIR. OF THIS BIBLE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YES, MY BROTHER. YES, MY BROTHER. SO, THAT means this Bible Uhhuh. is more than a book. Amen. Amen. AMEN. AMEN. CAN I SAY THIS TO YOU? TAKE YOUR TIME. IT'S BECOME OUR BREAD. AMEN. WHICH IS OUR STRENGTH. YES, MY BROTHER. SEE, OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM THE WORD. AMEN. NOW, IF YOU MISS A NATURAL MEAL, it will affect YOUR NATURAL BODY. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT IF YOU MISS A SPIRITUAL MEAL, THAT'S IT. IT WILL AFFECT THE SPIRITUAL BODY. MISS THAT ONE. SEE, BECAUSE THE BIBLE IS GOD'S SPIRITUAL DIET. THAT'S IT. THEN HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU CAN STAY HOME AND BE JUST AS GOOD A CHRISTIAN AS YOU WOULD BE AT CHURCH. UH-UH. NO, SIR. LET'S SAY WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. YOU JUST can't do it. Amen. Read the word. The Holy Spirit FEEDS ON THE WORD. YES. THE BIBLE IS GOD'S SPIRITUAL DIET. YES, SIR. FOR HIS CHURCH. YES, LORD. AND THE HOLY SPIRIT is the one who brings it TO YOU. YES, SIR. AND PLACES IT IN THE HEART. YES, SIR. AND with thanksgiving, YOU WATER IT. YES, MY FRIEND. AND EVERY DIVINE PROMISE WILL PRODUCE EXACTLY WHAT GOD SAID IT WOULD DO. IT'S GOT to his word AND IT'S LIFE. YES, MY FRIEND. SEE, THEN WE MUST, SOMEBODY SAY, WE MUST. WE MUST, WE MUST KEEP FEEDING ON THE WORD. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT CAN I SAY THIS? YES, SIR. WE MUST KEEP FEEDING ON THE REVEALED ONE. [Laughter] PREACH. THERE'S 900 DENOMINATIONS. AND BROTHER ABEL, THEY'RE EVERYONE HEADED FOR TRIBULATION. THAT'S IT. AND THEY'RE HOLDING THE SAME BIBLE YOU'RE HOLDING. THAT'S IT. BUT IN THE END TIME, THAT'S IT. THAT JOSHUA WOULD COME AMONG THE CHURCH. AND HE WOULD OPEN THE WORD AND HE WOULD BEGIN TO POSITIONALLY PLACE YOU AND SAY, "LISTEN, CHRIST IS THE PREEMINENT ONE IN EVERY VERSE. AND IF YOU DON'T FIND CHRIST, GO BACK AND READ IT AGAIN AND HE WOULD RELEASE TO YOU REVELATION THAT WOULD PUT STRENGTH ON YOU TO FLY ABOVE." THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. COME ON. THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT HEADED FOR TRIBULATION. WE HAVE GOT A FOOD THAT IS CAUSING US TO BYPASS. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. THE TRIBULATION. CAN I SAY THIS? AMEN. WE'RE CLOSER TO OUR CHANGE NOW THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND THE CLOSER WE GET, THE HARDER THE BATTLE GETS. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE CLOSER TO THE TIME, THE HARDER, AMEN. THE BATTLE GETS. BUT CAN I SAY THIS? TAKE YOUR TIME. PRESS ON. YES, SIR. PRESS ON. YES, SIR. I SAID PRESS ON. YES, SIR. PRESS ON OVER DISCIPLINE. YES, SIR. PRESS ON OVER MISUNDERSTANDING. PRESS ON BAD HARD DAYS. PRESS ON BEYOND SICK DAYS. AMEN. YOU GOT TO KEEP ON PRESSING. YES, MY BROTHER. YOU GOT TO KEEP ON PRESSING. YES, MY BROTHER. SEE, THE BATTLE RIGHT now is between the OUTWARD MAN. THAT'S IT. THAT IS PERISHING. THAT'S IT. BUT THE INWARD MAN, YES, SIR. IS GETTING STRONGER. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. COME ON, CHURCH. THE outward man is living on the SPIRIT OF ERROR. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. NOW, LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU. YES, SIR. SCIENCE, EDUCATION. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. YES. COME ON. AMEN. AMEN. CHEMICAL FOODS AND YES, MY BROTHER. I'M NOT I'M NOT GETTING ALL THAT. ARE YOU WITH ME, SCIENCE? AMEN. THE SPIRIT OF ERROR. THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH WHEN THEY TELL YOU TO EAT EGGS one day and not to eat EGGS THE NEXT. THE SPIRIT OF ERROR, THAT'S RIGHT, HAS BECOME THE INFLUENCE OVER THIS BODY. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THERE'S AN INWARD MAN. YES, SIR. AND HE IS RENEWED. YES, SIR. DAY BY DAY. CAN I SAY THIS? THE INWARD MAN IS STRONGER THAN THE OUTWARD MAN. THAT'S IT. THERE IS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE OUTWARD MAN OF THE FLESH AND SPIRIT. BUT THE INWARD MAN IS A SOUL. YES, SIR. AND THE FLESH RECOGNIZES THAT THE SOUL is feeding on the word THAT HAS THE POWER OF TRANSFORMATION. AMEN. AMEN. YOUR SOUL SIR REALIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING SIR. COME ON CHURCH. YOUR FLESH. IT REALIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE SERVICES. YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE MIND OF A MAN. NO SIR. YOU ARE FEEDING ON THE UNFAILING BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. YES, MY BROTHER. YOUR FLESH RECOGNIZES THAT. YES, SIR. BECAUSE YOUR FLESH DIDN'T WANT TO COME TONIGHT. YOUR FLESH WAS TOO TIRED TO SING. YOUR FLESH WAS TOO TIRED TO PRAISE. BUT LOOK AT YOUR FLESH RIGHT NOW. RIGHT HERE. YOUR FLESH HAS HAD TO COME SUBJECT TO THE FOOD OF REVELATION AND YOU GOT CARRIED AWAY IN THE SPIRIT. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. OH MERCY. The spirit OF TRUTH WILL LEAD BY THE WORD. YES, MY BROTHER. SOMEBODY SAY BY THE WORD. BY THE WORD. THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH. THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH WILL LEAD WILL LEAD BY THE WORD BY THE WORD. THIS BODY THIS BODY TO A RAPTURE TO THE RAPTURE.

WE ARE WAITING YES, SIR. FOR THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION. YES, SIR. CAN I MAKE A STATEMENT? TAKE YOUR TIME. WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR ADOPTION. WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FULLNESS OF ADOPTION. AMEN. THAT WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN AT THE FIRST RESURRECTION WHEN our bodies will BE CHANGED FROM THESE VILE CREATURES. WE ARE AND WILL HAVE A BODY LIKE HIS OWN GLORIOUS BODY. For we shall see him as he is. YES, SIR. OH MY. YES, SIR. AND WE WILL BE LIKE HIM. WHEN HE APPEARS, we appear IN HIS LIKENESS. WE WILL HAVE A BODY LIKE HIS. A GLORIOUS, GLORIFIED BODY. AND ALL THE TRIALS AND ALL THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE WILL FADE OFF INTO A LITTLE MIST AND BLOW AWAY TO NEVER be no more. AMEN. GLORY TO GOD. THAT'S WHY THE FLESH HATES THIS MESSAGE IS BECAUSE THIS FLESH IS GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL MY WORSHIP. AMEN. THIS FLESH IS GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY TO GIVE ME MIND BATTLES. THIS FLESH IS GOING TO LOSE ITS ABILITY. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M TALKING ABOUT A WORD THAT'S BEEN REVEALED AND IT'S COME TO US BY THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH. AMEN. AND OUR BODIES WILL BE CHANGED. OUR SOUL IS GOING TO MATCH OUR BODIES. YES, SIR. I'M NOT A CRAZY MAN. MY FLESH MY FLESH HATES IT. THAT'S IT. BUT HE CAN'T STOP IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. MY SOUL. YES, SIR. YES, SIR.

BROTHER STEVEN, WE HAVE RAISED ABOVE SIR A PENTECOSTALISM ANOINTING. WE HAVE SOMETHING IN US. YES, SIR. THAT TELLS US WE'VE COME UP SO FAR. WHAT IS THE EARNEST? IT'S THE LITTLE DOWN PAYMENT THAT HOLDS IT. SEE, ONCE we loved the THINGS OF THE WORLD, ONCE WE SINNED AND WENT OUT ABOUT DOING things of the WORLD AND CARED NOT FOR GOD, we were alienated FROM HIM. THAT'S RIGHT. WITHOUT GOD, WITHOUT Christ in THE WORLD, SIR. BUT NOW, GOD SENT HIS HOLY SPIRIT. YES, SIR. And through that, we are lifted up above those things. AND NOW WE HAVE THE EARNEST that we have passed FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. COME ON, CHURCH. RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE POSSESSING THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. AMEN. IN YOUR SOUL, SIR. AND THAT REVELATION IS LEADING YOU TO BELIEVE AND HAVE GONE AS HIGH. YES, SIR. I'VE GONE AS HIGH AS JUSTIFICATION, BUT I'VE GONE HIGHER. I'VE GONE TO SANCTIFICATION, BUT I'VE GONE HIGHER. I'VE GONE TO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT BROTHER ZACH, I'VE GOT TO GO HIGHER THEN. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO? I'M GOING TO GO TO THE ADOPTION. I'M GOING TO GO TO THE WORD MADE FLESH IN THE ADOPTED SONS OF GOD. AMEN. AMEN. GLORY TO GOD. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP THERE. I'M GOING TO CLIMB ON UP. I'M GOING TO CLIMB ON UP SOME MORNING BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9. I'M GOING TO CLIMB ON UP INTO THE FULLNESS OF MY ADOPTION AND MY BODY IS GOING TO MATCH MY SOUL. YES. HALLELUJAH. YES. HALLELUJAH. PREACH. PREACH. NOW, glory to God. I'm just GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT. UH-HUH. THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE, a big ONE IN A CHURCH MEMBER UHHUH. AND A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN. THAT'S IT. PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "A man that's born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD LOVES TO GO TO CHURCH." PREACH, PREACH, PREACH BETTER better than he loves to eat his dinner WHEN HE'S HUNGRY. GLORY TO GOD. GLORY TO GOD. GLORY TO GOD. THE SPIRITUAL MAN, YES, SIR, ON THE INSIDE HAS GOT TO BE FED. YES. IF THAT MAN ISN'T FED, HE WILL DIE. THAT'S IT. IF THE OUTWARD man isn't fed, HE WILL DIE. SO, THE inward man has got TO BE FED. YES, SIR. THE BIBLE SAID THAT JESUS told Satan in his debate. HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN THAT MAN SHALL not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the MOUTH OF GOD." THAT'S HOW MAN LIVES, NOT BY HIS BREAD ALONE, BUT BY THE word of God. Man lives. Yes, my brother. ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? THE OUTWARD man lives by bread, but his inward man lives by the bread of God. Amen. CAN I SAY THIS? THE OUTWARD MAN IS SATISFIED JUST BEING A CHURCH MEMBER. BUT THE INWARD man is unsatisfied until EVERY PULSATION IN HIS HEART IS JESUS CHRIST. YES, SIR. NOW, now what are you saying? AND I'M GOING TO JUST PREACH FOR A SECOND BECAUSE IN LUKE 24, Jesus spoke of THE PROMISE OF MY FATHER. YES, SIR. WHICH WAS MANIFESTED IN ACTS THE 2 CHAPTER. YES, SIR. ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, SIR, WHEN THE HOLY GHOST CAME SAID, "NOT GO AND JOIN this and go and join that or go and join this one." Wait till the power comes FROM ON HIGH. HOW LONG? UNTIL ONE DAY, TWO DAYS. Wait until DON'T TAKE SOME LITTLE EMOTION. NO SIR. NO SIR. Or some little frustration. Wait there until you are dead and buried and born again a new in Christ Jesus. And every PULSATION OF YOUR LIFE REACH OUT JESUS CHRIST. TILL YOU can see the life of Christ reflected right IN YOUR LIVING THE WAY YOU GO. Yes sir. Till you can find that power like that they had back there in the beginning. Amen. Amen. AMEN. BROTHER BRANDON IS PREACHING A SERMON CALLED Return and Jubilee. Yes, sir. And he says these words. He says, "BACK TO A PENTECOSTAL INHERITANCE." YES, SIR. THAT'S YOUR POSSESSION. YES, SIR. DENOMINATION IS NOT YOUR POSSESSION. NO, SIR. PENTECOST. TAKE YOUR TIME. PENTECOST, TAKE YOUR TIME, IS YOUR POSSESSION, NOT A PENTECOSTAL ORGANIZATION. YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF SUCH A THING. ALL RIGHT. TAKE YOUR TIME. YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF GUESSING WHEN IT COMES TO DISCERNMENT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. YOUR FATHERS COME OUT OF FEELINGS AND SENSATIONS. AND OH, I SEE YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING. OH, I see God's GOING TO USE YOU. OH, I SEE THERE'S A BLESSING. OH, I SEE. OH, YOU SEE? AMEN. I SEE IT. AMEN. AMEN. THAT'S PENTECOSTALISM. YES, MY BROTHER. COME BACK TO THE PENTECOSTAL INHERITANCE. PREACH. PREACH. I MIGHT AS WELL PREACH. I'M THIS CLOSE TO IT. WE WILL NOT FOLLOW A JANICE AND JAMBERS IMPERSONATION. You can BEAT ME. YOU CAN CANCEL ME. YOU CAN RIDICULE ME. YOU CAN CALL ME WHAT YOU WANT TO, BUT I WILL NEVER BOW MY KNEE TO SOME CHEAP REPRODUCTION OF THE MESSIAH SIGN WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH. THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH HAS RETURNED TO THE CHURCH. COME ON, CHURCH. COME ON. COME ON. YOU BETTER STAY WITH THE WORD. THAT'S IT. YOU BETTER TAKE IT BY THE WORD. THAT'S IT. COME ON, ABEL. YOU AND I'S ABOUT THE SAME AGE. AMEN. AMEN. Got kids now, so probably classified as old men. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BUDDY? I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN WE USED TO CHECK THINGS BY THE MESSAGE. THAT'S IT. REMEMBER REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO CHECK THINGS?

In them is the power. Amen. Come on, church. Amen. Amen. Prophet of God brought the mercy seat right out of heaven into the heart OF THE BRIDE. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. YES, SIR. NOW, you love him tonight. The word is back in its position. Hallelujah. Mercy, yes, sir. is back in this back in the back in its rightful place. You love him tonight. Almighty God, we bow our hearts before you tonight, Lord. Father, the word is just so it's so consuming. Oh God, Lord, it's so real. It's so true. Lord, I know it may have come across strong tonight, but Father, I believe if there's ever been a time to lay and say what a prophet said, Amen. into the church. It's right now, Lord. We're hearing the message. We're watching the pillar of fire. We're watching the spirit of truth. Lord, men of God are laying in their studies, in their offices, laying in these tapes, reading these books, listening, Lord, to these words, Coleman through this Bible. Oh God, your word tying things together. Bringing bread to the table, not for the outward man, but for the inward man. Lord, the other day as I just sat pondering, just thinking how that you look at so many churches, denominational churches, full of denominational goers, church members, denominational goers as your prophet called them. Lord, they boast about coffee in the lobby and donuts and soup suppers or meals or food or Lord even now just the other day reading where a church has got it set up now in the pews where they can have a little table and put their coffee and their breakfast on it while the preacher preaches and enjoy the service. And I thought, "Oh, God, how they've had to re how they've had to how they've had to go back. How they've had to shift, Lord, to worrying about feeding the outward man because they have nothing coming across the pullpit that will feed the inward man." That's right. So Lord, the outward man is renewed Sunday after Sunday or Sunday every now and again or Sunday every time they go and hear a little lecture sermonet. But the inward man is starving. But Lord, we come over into this word that you've sinned. Oh God, Lord, the outward man is perishing. But Lord, we're so thankful because there's a food on the table. The seven seals are open. The word is on the table. It's a seven course meal. And the inward man is feeding on the revelation, the knowledge, the understanding, the clarity. Oh God. Lord, I want to say it like this tonight as I had it on my heart to get to but didn't get there tonight. The spirit has come in the church and the spirit is now the teacher. And the spirit is teaching the seals. The spirit is teaching the godhead. The spirit is teaching the mysteries. And Lord, we're so thankful it's now the spirit teaching because we seen what man done when they taught. That's right. When they got done, it was more of a mystery, more dry, more intellectual. But Lord, we thank you for Holy Ghost filled teachers. Lord, they won't get up and spit and stomp and sweat and run around like I do. Lord, that's not their calling. But Lord, they'll stand there under the anointing and they'll place this and place that. And Lord, that anointed teaching will fall right in the hearts of the people. And then Lord, you'll send another gift of your of your five-fold ministry through. Amen. And Lord, I won't have time to stand here and read all the quotes and scriptures as the others would. But Lord, I would be able to begin to say what a prophet said. And Lord, because there was because there was octane in the gas, Lord, when the fire begins to strike it, Lord, it don't sputter. But Lord, all 16 cylinders fire Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Lord, I pray you would raise up more men of God that'll lay in what a prophet taught. Amen. And Lord, they'll give their lives to lay that into the hearts of these people. Amen. Lord, they'll give their lives to teach only what a prophet taught. Say only what a prophet said. Amen. Go only where a prophet went. Amen. And Lord, lead the church by the spirit of truth. We love you tonight, Lord. Now, Father, we commit this meeting in your hands. Father, I pray the outward man, Lord, I pray the inward man would be refreshed tonight. I don't know what the outward man would be going through here tonight. Lord, you know all things, but may the inward man right now be renewed. Lord, we can't go back. We can't give up our possession. We can't We can't regress. Oh, God. We must progress. We must advance in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Can we just raise our hands to him tonight and say, "I surrender to you, Lord. I surrender all over to this message, Lord. I surrender to what a prophet taught." How many fathers could say, "I surrender my homes to this word. I want to see the evidence. I want to see the residue. I want to see the effect. I want to see the moisture. I want to see the rain, Lord. I want to see it upon the upon the lives. I want to see it, Lord. I want to see the effect of your presence, oh God. I want to see it upon my children, Lord. I want to see it upon my family, oh God. I want to see it upon my confession, Lord. I want to see the evidence of this word all over my life. Hallelujah. I want to see it in my conduct. I want to see it in my confession. You just raise your hands to him right now. Every head bowed, every eye closed. Say, "Lord, I want to see it more. I want to see my children more full of this message. I want to see them full of the Holy Ghost." Maybe you got a desire for your church here. You say, "Lord, I want to see the evidence of this message." Yes. all over the church. I want to see it sit in the young people. I want to see it in the elders. I want to see it in the officers. Yes, Lord. I want to see it in the teaching. I want to see it in the preaching. Yes, Lord. Lord, I want to see the evidence. Thank you, Jesus. How many can say, "Lord, I see the evidence. I see the evidence. I see the evidence that you're the kinsman redeemer. I see the evidence that you're the supernatural. I see the evidence that you're the forgiver, Lord. I see the evidence that you're the sanctifier and the justifier, the perfector. I see the evidence of it in Jesus name. God bless you tonight, friends. Would you lead us in something? Hallelujah. Remember us in prayer, we'll be praying for you all till we meet again. Amen. Shalom. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Oh my. You know, God is wonderful. Amen. God is wonderful. That's why I would never back up from where I am at. Never. If I preach something out of this Bible and out of the message, I am backing one inch. Just like he preached, the battle is getting harder. You ask the deacon knows what I go through and standing for the message now somehow will make you lose friend. It will get people away from you. But when I'm looking at the souls of the people, it's amazing when we facing demon. They real. I'm dealing with even people who are not members of this church and you're dealing with them and you see what the devil is doing in people's life and you see me standing ragged and pushing. You don't understand why I'm aggressive to the devil the way I am because I see the damages he's doing in people's life. And it takes time. It wears you down. You have to go over a lot of stuff to pull somebody from something. And people think we're too hard. And they don't understand why we avoiding certain things because of what we dealing with. We didn't grow up in a generation like this. We didn't have cell phone. To have a cell phone, it's a luxury. We grew up with television that was black and white. The television can show off I mean can be on up to a certain time and turn it off in the whole city. Nobody will watch the television at 2:00 a.m. or something. Amen. So I got my first cell phone in the United States. I saw people with cell phone but our children are not growing like that. They changing their school system. They studying on iPad. They studying on computer, cell phone all over, Tik Tok, all kind of app are downloaded every day. And how do you want me to preach the gospel? That's true. And how do you want me to stand? Amen. How do you want me to fight the devil? Because people are posting stuff. People are doing things on WhatsApp. People are doing this and this and and before you know it, something is coming. something is doing. Somebody's doing this. Somebody's do. How do you want me to fight? That's why I have been commissioned. I don't have any game. God let me go through a hard experience in the last church and I took my decision right there. I'm not playing game and I have zero tolerance when it come to this message. People may say what they want. People can go back or whatever. I'm going to stand where I stand. One of this day. Yes sir. One of this day. Amen. Some of you will understand me. Because I have people coming back to repent after years. It takes two, three years and somebody coming back and now trying to go back again to the same thing. They begin to see what we were saying. But I can't wait three years. That's true. And then you're going to get damaged and you then you turn around. You say, "Brother Stephen, you saw this. Why did you let me go? I have to do what I got to do. So after you find out that this was correct, you will love me more. Amen. Let's stand for the word. Let's stand for the message. Amen. The years of intimidation is gone. We respect the elder but sometime we have to say what we say and when we say here we're not against anyone. We're not attacking anyone. But the problem is the problem is if you doing something wrong that the message say not to do and I'm preaching about it. I'm not against you. I'm against the wrong that you're doing. So let's learn whoever is following me online to dissociate the person and the wrong. I don't know if you get what I'm saying. I don't know if you get what I'm saying. Let me say it a plain way. Okay? So we understand one another. If brother Brandham say don't drink beer and there is a preacher who's drinking beer, you can't forbid me from reading the quote that say do not drink be and when I read those quote I will strike it to kill. I don't know if you understanding me. When I strike when I shoot it's to kill because I'm not playing with devil. And when I'm SHOOTING IF YOU PART OF it you better leave that beer alone. But don't make a personal issue between me and you because I'm preaching something. That's exactly. So whoever listen, whoever take my tape and put it on TikTok or just let this be clear, you can't forbid me. If I read something, it's going to strike preacher so and so. If I read something, so they better go back to the word. Then if we go back to the word, when we preach, we will be striking devils. But you can't be standing on something that is against the word and you are blocking us to even preach against it. When we have souls of people in our hand, I am backing up. If I'm too strong, there are many pastors. But I will stand because I can't play game. At the end of the day, you going to find out that this word is true. I told somebody I said there is nothing in this church that I have placed without using a scripture in the court. Whether the office everything are you because I know the devil will come and I want the devil to find you standing on the word and when you standing on the word it is written there is nothing that the devil will do. Amen. We're not against we're not wrestling against flesh and blood. It's principalities. If you have high heel I preach against high heel. If you take the high heel off and you put a normal heel and tomorrow I come back I say leave the high heel. Does he affect you? No. Is it a problem with you? But you don't want to leave a high heel. You want me to stop preaching about high heel? Then he turned to be personal. I'm sorry my friend. You're going to put it as personal as you want. But I won't quit. I will shoot it until that heel is burned and you get to a flat heel. Amen. Amen. So we understand one another. Let's give preeminence to the word. We have a lot to thank God. Get in the spirit. Stay in the spirit. Being caught up in a spirit and it's going to take the weariness off. Your mental state is very important. If your spirit is already seeing the vision of something, it will one day I will show you what it does. You can make a business fall by your attitude or you can make a business go through headache because the owner is still keeping the faith. You can get your marriage if the owner if the one in a marriage still keep faith. Amen. That marriage can go through rustle and the marriage still stand. If you just lose faith, the laws of nature understand and they come against you. That's exactly right. This is how things work spiritually. It works in everything. That's why it's important for the one who standing on the pulpit on the vision to keep the faith. And the only way is back to the word. Hallelujah. Amen. God richly bless you. May God protect you. All is well. Stay in the spirit. Get caught up in the things of the spirit and the Holy Spirit himself will lead you. God bless you, brother S.
