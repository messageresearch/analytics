[2:11:30] praying okay let's stay put where you
[2:11:33] are musician can come in we need to
[2:11:36] pray yeah the Holy Spirit has been
[2:11:40] talking clearly you don't need no
[2:11:43] interpretation or anything I'm a pastor
[2:11:47] I know and I know what the Holy Spirit
[2:11:51] was
[2:11:52] doing that's why brother Kelly can
[2:11:55] remember this sometime I see things and
[2:11:57] I stay quiet and I don't correct it
[2:12:00] until the Holy Spirit tells me to
[2:12:03] correct it sometime it's not me to do it
[2:12:06] he took an elite that the devil was
[2:12:09] trying to get down and he came and shoot
[2:12:12] the correct shot every single one of
[2:12:15] them in the hotel
[2:12:18] we preach to you about
[2:12:22] everything as far as
[2:12:25] Holiness we demonstrated I didn't just
[2:12:28] give you a quote to tell you don't do
[2:12:30] this because this is what happened in
[2:12:33] the past in the message and the message
[2:12:35] becomes like dos and
[2:12:36] don't that's the reason why I started by
[2:12:39] the scripture to show you things in the
[2:12:42] scripture and then back it up with the
[2:12:44] message so it will build a confidence in
[2:12:47] you that the message that we are
[2:12:49] following is not a man who has been
[2:12:52] giving us commandment but actually it
[2:12:55] was the word of God that was preached by
[2:12:57] the prophet I took the high heel Through
[2:13:00] the Bible I came back up I took makeup
[2:13:03] in the Bible I came back up I took that
[2:13:06] a young man and a young sister should
[2:13:08] not talk to each other if there is no
[2:13:10] involvement of parent I took all these
[2:13:13] thing I told you under no circumstances
[2:13:16] a young man or a young sister should
[2:13:18] court or should flirt with a man that is
[2:13:21] not a message believer I told you all of
[2:13:24] this but some of the parent are
[2:13:26] encouraging this sometime I'm trying to
[2:13:29] hold the standard and the parent are
[2:13:31] fighting me there been a blockage for
[2:13:33] the children children can come in church
[2:13:36] because of the
[2:13:37] parent I told you under no circumstances
[2:13:40] should be you be in contact with anyone
[2:13:43] else but your husband or but your wife I
[2:13:45] told you all of these things I told you
[2:13:48] about what kind of haircut we need to
[2:13:50] have what kind of hair a woman should
[2:13:52] wear avoid all this coloring of hairs
[2:13:55] and everything avoid all the foolishness
[2:13:57] in Tik Tok I thought about orders in
[2:14:00] this church I thought about music I told
[2:14:03] you walk kind of correct music and what
[2:14:06] kind of correct dancing we still do
[2:14:08] things the way that we want and the Holy
[2:14:11] Spirit rebuke that rebellious spirit and
[2:14:14] some are going around the camp and they
[2:14:16] keep on this clean of keep gossiping if
[2:14:20] you don't know the what happened about
[2:14:23] the thing do not get involved into it
[2:14:27] I'm going to explain this clearly so you
[2:14:29] stay clear as a pastor and whoever is
[2:14:31] streaming don't cut it off stay right
[2:14:34] there and if you listen to this step
[2:14:36] stay until I finish this because some of
[2:14:38] you are not here I'm going to talk with
[2:14:40] the authority of a pastor if me and
[2:14:44] brother khma have a problem and you
[2:14:46] don't know what happened and brother
[2:14:48] khma tells you something do not get
[2:14:50] involved because you have not talked to
[2:14:52] me yet because if you hear the story
[2:14:55] from my part it's going to be probably
[2:14:57] different I'm not saying brother khala
[2:14:59] will never do something like that he's a
[2:15:00] loyal brother I'm just picking him as an
[2:15:02] example but he will not tell you because
[2:15:05] sometime you're going to hear the story
[2:15:06] from someone and you don't hear the
[2:15:08] story from me and you stay and you take
[2:15:10] that story and you go tell to somebody
[2:15:12] else some of us have a tendency that we
[2:15:15] have created clicks that we are there to
[2:15:17] be hearing negativity from message
[2:15:20] churches you need to stop those kind of
[2:15:23] clicks you need to stop those kind of
[2:15:25] friend you cannot be a CNN in this
[2:15:28] message in other word when people come
[2:15:30] to you they know what happened in

[2:15:34] Congo they know what happened in uh in
[2:15:37] Europe they know what happened and and
[2:15:39] and every time people are with you it's
[2:15:42] all about people's life people's life
[2:15:44] and we and and and and we keep this kind
[2:15:47] of friend friend around us so they can
[2:15:49] continue to feed us with what happened
[2:15:51] in South Carolina what happened in uh in
[2:15:54] uh What uh what in Michigan and things
[2:15:57] like that and clicks have been G and
[2:15:59] before you know it you are giving spirit
[2:16:01] one to another and before you know it
