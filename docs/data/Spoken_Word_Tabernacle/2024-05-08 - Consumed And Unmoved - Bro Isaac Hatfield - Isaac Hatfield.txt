of our the rooms in the basement there was water sipping through the tiles into the room and we had sent you um a video to see how they were scooping literally scooping water with buckets and pouring outside because it was just you know coming into the room um so we were hoping that maybe if there was time you could see the difference um so anyway when we received that it was night time over there it was daytime over here was around 100 p.m. and when I read the message for some reason the Lord just held my heart I wasn't I didn't fry or anything my husband was at work and I was also at work and I just standed and I prayed I said Lord you've done this before you can do it again just dry up the water don't dry the B holes but just dry up the water that is sipping through and I let it I let it be I didn't do anything I didn't even call my husband and so when we arrived home from work we talked about it I said I just prayed and he said he also prayed and I told him I said I believe that what will be dry by tomorrow and we just let it be like that so in the morning uh when I woke up it was already midday over there uh I called my sister um no I actually called the lady that helps her and I asked about the water he said oh it stopped and I asked her what time did it stop and she said oh it just stopped at night and I and and I of course you know I thanked God and I said send me a video

he's working all things together for our good amen and we're just so happy to have our family with us this time brought our wife and little little baby Spencer and parents and uh some of the other visitors that were able to to come tonight we just want to thank the Lord for them being able to be here amen we just want to greet you all and go straight to the word if we could uh the book of Hebrews and the Book of Matthew um but we're going to start with Hebrews 12 yes sir verse 25 Amen to Hebrews 12:25 to 29 says see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken that's right as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may may remain therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace where whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire amen and one more text out of the Book of Matthew 17 sorry to keep you standing and uh how many loves the Lord amen Matthew 17 it says in the first eight verses here and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared onto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for the one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias but while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man Sav Jesus only am amen if we could bow our heads you know maybe you have a need tonight I'm sure many of you fought fought to be here tonight and uh we know brother Brandon taught us how when sometimes a Christian's going through things it's just Satan trying to block an oncoming visitation and so whatever trial you've been going through maybe not just to get here but in your life and whatever need you have just lift it before the Lord tonight amen he's more than able father we come before your throne Lord we recognize Lord that you're the mighty one amongst us father there's no Mighty ones here besides you father Lord we're just weak empty vessels that you've chosen to be a part of your great Symphony and father Lord we invite you to come into this service Lord I know there's needs acrost this congregation father but I don't know what they are Lord but you do but father Lord many may be suffering physically many spiritual needs maybe those that couldn't be here tonight and father maybe tonight you would have needs to go by Samaria for somebody father that's suffering and hurting Lord and in the middle of a great battle father maybe they would be here maybe they would just be tuned into the stream and you would have a word from father we don't limit you father we just ask you to have your way Lord that your will would be done done and you just help us to get out of the way we commit this service in your hands in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats this evening and we just want to take a a thought out of that for a few moments on consumed and unmoved amen we want to be consumed and that it would make us unmovable and amen and brother Brandon preaches the message hear ye him many times and he he begins to express to us that it's a type of the coming of the Lord Lord and and he says here that he takes his disciples up into the mountain to see the order of his coming and there stood Moses Elijah and Jesus and he said Moses represented the dead Saints and Elijah represented the living Saints and and then there stood Jesus glorified and and if you go back one verse to the previous chapter in Matthew 16:28 it says verily I say un you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man come coming in his kingdom and and brother Brandon would explain to us that that is what the Lord was doing he says it wasn't that the apostles were going to live to see his coming in its fullness because he didn't say all of you standing here he said there be some standing here and the some standing there would be Peter James and John that he was fixing to take up onto this mountain and show him a picture of his coming and and there they would see him and clothed in the cloud and his face shining like the sun and and and what what a wonderful thing it was for them to see that and I I brother Brandon would say how the Bible ties together how you can take scriptures and out of one scripture you could preach healing you could preach uh Deliverance you could because it all ties together and so here he was showing that it's a type of the coming of the Lord he said it's also would begin to show that it's a type of adoption and he said I'm going to take it in a little different sphere and he began to show that there they were up on a holy mountain and he said it wasn't so much that the mountain was holy but that there was a holy God up on the mountain and there stood Peter James and John and and Peter called it a Holy Mountain but there was Jesus and and Jesus there he was as the Son of God and he wasn't about to become a son he was already the son but God was fixing to adopt him for he had been obedient he hadn't just been ging about about all kinds of other business but he had been about the father's business he had been obedient here here he was bringing him up onto this mountain to to adopt him as the Son of God and there stood three Earthly Witnesses Peter James and John which represent faith hope and charity and three Heavenly Witnesses Moses Elijah and Jesus which represent the law the justice and the mercy and here stood Peter as Moses and Elijah begin to appear and and as as the face of Jesus begin to shine as like the sun there stood Peter and he got excited at the Supernatural and reasonably so I mean can you imagine seeing that with your own eyes it was a powerful moment but Peter got excited and said Lord I would that we could build three Tabernacles one for you one for Moses and one for Elijah but but the problem was that Moses represented the law and the law was a policeman the law could only condemn you the law could only put you in jail it had no Redeeming Grace because Grace came through Jesus Christ but but but but the law was only one that could condemn you and and the law had its place because brother Brandon would use out of Deuteronomy 4 I believe in the message the world falling apart and and there was a time where the Lord spoke on Mount Si there was a time where he gave forth the Ten Commandments there was the time where the law had a place but but here there's becoming to be a transition and showing that the law would have a shadow of good things to come he was coming one on the scene a priest after the order of MDC not made after the law of carinal Commandments but after the power of an endless life and here he would come on the scene and here Jesus would say it is said of Old Times Thou shalt not kill but he said I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause has already killed and thou shalt not commit adultery but whosoever lookth upon a woman and he wasn't changing the law for God doesn't change his word but he was magnifying here was the greater one coming into their midst and he represented Moses represented the law and brother Brandon would say that Elijah represents God's justice and brother say I don't want God's justice I want God's mercy and one time Elijah was up on a hill under a commission and the King wanted him to come down off the hill so he would send armies of 50 to come and get him off the hill but Elijah wasn't ready to come down off the hill at the command of the king but he said if I be a man of God fire fall from Heaven and consumed them and fire fell and consumed the army of 50 and the King thought well maybe it was just a lightning storm and so he sent another Army of 50 and fire he said if I be a man of God let fire fall and fire would fall and consume armies of 50 until the king got tired of sending 50s brother Bron would say and that was God's justice that would that would that would consume armies of the enemy through his Justice and and and and Peter was about to say let's build three Tabernacles but thank the Lord before he could ever get those words out he was interrupted by a voice that said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when they looked up Moses was no longer standing there and Elijah was no longer standing there but they looked up and they saw Jesus only they saw God's love and God's mercy expressed to Mankind and that's the problem so many times with individuals is that they get their eyesight wrong and they never get their eyes off of the law and they never get their eyes off of the justice and even around this message you see people fall away because they never saw the reality of the message they never saw Christ in this message all they saw was a bunch of dos and don'ts and a bunch of dress codes and a bunch of religion and a bunch of of Acts and carnal Commandments but if you ever get your eyes pass the law and the justice have their place but if that's all that you ever see you'll live a you'll live a brother Brandon say a person that lives as a Halfway Christian is the most miserable person that there is because they're just living under the law and may be afraid of God's justice that might come upon them but if you ever get past that and see Jesus it'll bring a reality into your life you'll no longer just serve the Lord out of a out of a do or out of a religious act but it'll be a love that comes into your heart that'll make you dress right that'll make you live right that'll make you act right oh you won't have a self-righteous IND you won't have a a holier than thou attitude it'll put a humility in your heart you won't lift yourself up but it'll humble you to live the word for your hour and for your day amen oh but you got to get your eyes on the right thing and see Jesus uh some people maybe brother BR talk about how how there was an eagle in the chicken yard and some people may hear it and they think brother bram's calling him a chicken that's all that they can see but when you hear the word you hear it differently brother was calling me an eagle because I've heard another voice hear ye him the voice of the Lord that has called you out of your conditions and called you into a love relationship with him oh it's a powerful thing to hear the voice of the Lord amen and that's what you got to see and that'll bring a liberty to your life because it's it's it's not a bunch of legalism the legalistic dispensation ended when Jesus Christ came and bore our sins on the cross and he brought us into a Grace and he brought us into the unfailing promises of God and salvation is not Jesus plus your works and if that's the way you see it and sometimes it's easy to see it that way sometimes there's a voice in your head that that you feel like you haven't done enough you feel like you haven't done enough to earn it feel like you haven't uh maybe read your Bible enough that week and if God is in you he will live right The Works will follow but that is not what your salvation is depending on your salvation is depending on the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary he shed a blood for your healing he shed a blood for your salvation amen if you could ever get a hold of the power of that blood that you are saved you are saved beyond the shadow of a doubt oh and say can't do anything to destroy that oh because it's a blood oh it's not the blood plus your conduct conduct it is Jesus only only the blood of Jesus amen that's the kind of Jesus only I believe in only the blood only the power of God my brother oh brother random say I would hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching or on my Visions but I'm going to heaven because I hold his grace my heart oh that's what you got to come to and that'll bring a liberty to your life brother oh but but but once that love is in your heart sir oh The Works will follow and that's what God's election is for a real believer election isn't just uh that you let go and you don't worry about anything because I'm elected and I'm going to make it anyway so I don't even have to try but I believe a True Believer that's been elected will try with everything that's in him to please the Lord and do right because God's love has been projected on your life and chose you before the foundation of the world and it's in you to want to please them amen oh but when you fall and make a mistake there's a trust and a blood to get back up yes my brother amen take there was a woman in adultery one time that's right and and they caught her in the very act and and they come to Jesus and said Moses in the law commanded us that she should be stoned but what sayest thou and he began to ride in the sand and say he that is without sin cast the first stone and Jesus was left alone after all those men were convicted and walked off Jesus was left alone with the woman and and when Jesus had lifted up himself John wrote and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee that's it mean in the presence of Jesus the law had passed away the Justice had passed away her accusers had gone and there was a man whose blood was worthy to loose her of her condition yes my brother yes oh hear ye him brother Brandon would say it's a small text but it's a powerful text it brother Brandon said in obedience to those three words tonight you'll see a repeat of Pentecost in this building he said it's just small but there's enough power in there that the rest of the Bible would connect to it that's right why would you hear him because if you're sick tonight he's the only one that can heal if you're bound tonight if you're lost he's the only one that can save that's why you would hear him because he's the only one it's a word of Salvation to everyone who will believe that no matter what's the situation you're going through that there is a word a promise over your life and it's the authoritative word there's a lot of voices there's a lot of isms there's a lot of Creeds but we have a word of authority we have the final say over the situation and it's the word of the Lord It's the final say it's the authoritative word amen but brother Brandon would teach us that that there was a boy one time who had gotten some trouble and that he needed a part un lest he would die but but he would show us that that Abraham Lincoln could even write a note on a piece of paper and send it to that boy but the boy didn't accept it because it wasn't on fancy letterhead he didn't think it could be true and so he refused the know of his pardon and so they decided that a pardon is only a pardon if received as a pardon and brother BR said hear ye him it's a challenge it's a command it's a pardon it's all that you have need of if you'll accept it in that way but if you do not accept it that way it's just another piece of paper yes sir and so we read it in Hebrews see that she refuse not in that speaketh it's a pardon his voice is a pardon his voice is healing his voice is Deliverance but you must accept it in your heart and hide that word in your heart and hold on to it oh that it would be a pardon to you personally amen for it is a pardon and you can accept it in Mercy but God never sends judgment until he first sends his Mercy that's right and after his Mercy brother said it's bound to be judgment and so it it it would pay pay us to take heed to the voice of the Lord yes sir the voice of authority yes my brother see one time there was a boy who had committed a crime and he was in jail and he was going to be punished under capital punishment and taken and hung but the mother had such compassion on her child that she went before the governor and she crawled in on her hands and feet and plad for the life of her son so the governor said okay well I'll see what I can do and so he went and talked to the boy and the boy wouldn't even acknowledge Him the boy sat there in the jail said can't you see that I'm nervous and he wouldn't even acknowledge the governor the governor would say I'm trying to tell you and the boy would say no I I'm going to die can't you see that that I'm nervous and so the governor said well he made his choice and the governor had to walk out of that cell and the boy had to go and hang on The Gallows because he wouldn't take heed to the voice it's a voice of authority that's right in the Book of John Jesus was preaching and he was speaking to the people how he was the door how he was the Good Shepherd he said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again and then a few verses later the Bible says in the Book of John 10 that there was a division therefore again among the Jews for these thingss and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the blind you see there was Jesus speaking to the people and there was a division amongst the people some said why hear ye him and some said how could a man do this in his own ability and and how could a man Open the Eyes of the blind these are not the words of him that hath a devil could a devil Open the Eyes of the Blind and there was a division on the authority of the words of Jesus Christ God in his grace and mercy has sent a message to us in this hour and he came like a mighty Angel clothed in a white wig which represented supreme authority and he gave us a message through the voice of the seventh angel and yet the devil still works amongst people today saying why should we hear him he's a man that has Devils he's be above he speaks hard things and they turn down the message their very pardon their very word of authority That Could set them free it's a voice of authority it was more than the voice of brother brandom it was the voice of the Lord speaking out in this generation but it's only a pardon if received as a pardon oh and there was a division amongst the people but you got to come to the place where you decide who which day choose ye this day who you will serve and what side of the division will you be on this message is not the voice of just a man this message is not the opinion of a man brother brandom this message came from God this message was sent from heaven and it's for me and I will not cast my lot with the accusers but I will say how could a man with a devil bring such a word as this but this message is my pardon this message is my Liberty this message has set me free because I received it in my heart oh that's the side I'm on I'm on the side of the critic I'm on the side that was seen beyond the curtain of time saying I'm resting on it it's nothing but the truth because you preached what Paul preached sir oh God's had many servants throughout the ages God's had an Oral Roberts God's had a Billy Graham and I thank the Lord for them they have their place but that was not the messenger he sent to me he sent to me the seventh angel to set me free from my condition and loose me and pardon my life and splash his blood across me that I could be free to Worship the Lord that I could be free to go in the rapture that I could be free to live an overcoming life and I receive it as a word of authority oh it was more than an opinion oh I wouldn't want to stand Before the Throne of God of judgment saying that this was just an opinion it was not an opinion it was the voice of the Lord what other Ministry had a voice come behind it and say I am just using Brother brandom's voice this is not him who was it standing on the river that day who was it that commissioned this message oh this is not the words of a Kentucky hillbilly this is the word of the Lord oh and it has power to deliver it has power to loose you it has power to set you free oh don't reject it oh brother Brandon would sing the song what then what then for those that have rejected the message for those that have rejected the Savior what then oh if you spurn Mercy judgment is coming but if you receive it if you receive this message the power of a word sent from the Lord oh it has power to Pardon yes sir it has power to heal yes sir oh my glory to God I know brother Brandon was a man and you don't have to drive the same truck he did you don't have to wear the same brand of clothes he did but when it comes to the word that was influenced by the angel of the Lord it would pay us to take heed for if they would not survive who refus the voice that spake from Earth how much more would you survive to refuse the voice that spoke from Heaven oh it's a Heavenly voice oh it would pay us to hear it that we might go free I know what side I'm onall I'm not confused about what voice has been sent to me oh it's been laid out in the scripture and so we're not here to lift up the problems we're not here to lift up the situations God's already sent a voice there's already a word yes all we got to do is hear it and lift it up above every situation lift it up above every problem brother Brandon said he's the one that can save you he's the one that can heal you he's the one that responsible for this he's the one responsible to his word and if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me oh I'm not responsible to fulfill it I'm just responsible to preach it you're not responsible to fulfill it you're just responsible to believe it you're responsible amen it and if I be lifted up amen we're here to lift up Jesus Christ he's the mighty one amongst us he's the great one amongst us he's the one that spoke it and the god that spoke it is the god that will perform it oh it's not by might it's not by power but it's by my spirit sayeth the Lord the one that spoke the promise he's the one that will perform it just take heed to the word hide it in your heart oh if you have need of healing tonight take heed to the voice of the Lord he spoke it he'll perform it he said you could have the Holy Ghost he'll give it just start thanking him for it just start praising him for it just start claiming your children in the presence of the Lord in the presence of the one that spoke it oh what are you doing brother Isaac I am lifting up the one that is able to take care of every problem that is able to take care of every situation oh it's the authoritative voice of the word of the Lord not a voice of yesterday but a present voice oh he's responsible because oh brother brandham taught us sir that a real Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah it didn't glorify themselves it didn't glorify nothing else but Christ and so that's why we're here not to establish ourselves but to establish the word of God in the hearts of the people oh if I establish myself it may hold for a few seconds if that but eventually it'll fall but there is a kingdom which cannot be moved that we are Desiring to be established from the hearts of his people oh we are commanded Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your Fai might Faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I come to you in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God he said see they're trying to establish themselves every man I did this me I mine my denomination me this establishing themselves brother BR said what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God but we are meant to take the unbelief out and establish the word of God in the hearts of the people amen God has sent to us a message he wasn't showing them to join the Baptist he wasn't showing them to join the Methodist he was isn't showing them to join a certain church but to draw them onto him to draw them onto a body onto a kingdom unto a body of Believers amen that by one Spirit they could be baptized into one body and that Spirit of Truth would lead them into all truth oh to be about the father's business and the father's business is not just to to build churches or to establish kingdoms on this Earth but the father business is to vindicate the word to vindicate the words that have been spoken over our lives as his bride there's some words spoke over us and we're not here just to build a kingdom onto ourselves but we're here to work for the kingdom of God Amen we've got one objective wi Souls one motive love one objective mind the father keep the word one desire to see Jesus Christ glorified to lift up Jesus in the midst of the people brother amen that's our desire yes sir amen and and and because that's the kingdom we're born of that's exactly and if that's not your desire you check your heart and say Lord what kingdom am I really working for you see no matter how much you could make soup suppers you could bring all kinds of activities we see it in the world they they have to bring fog machines and all kinds of bands in that play music that's not even Christian at all and they have to bring in all sorts of attractions but the bride is attracted to the word and if you lift up the word and you preach it in power and demonstration it'll attract to people that are attracted to it the Deep calls to the deep and the word connects with the word and because the word is in you make fles you connected with this message oh it wasn't the color of the pews or the carpet it wasn't the bigness of the building or how much money it was but it was the reality of Jesus Christ that draw you onto this message oh it's another kingdom that we are associated with oh because the church does not come to life on Traditions but brother Rand said you might bring members by the millions but you'll never bring down the power of God until we get back to the original word again back to the foundational Faith back to the blood back to Jesus Christ back to oldfashioned prayer meetings and back to God brother oh that's why we don't believe in justy build numbers on carinal things because because we're not working for an organization we're working for the kingdom of God and our desire is to see individuals birst into that Kingdom amen whether they come to church here whether they come to church in Ohio whether they go to church in in Australia that doesn't matter to me just get birthed into a kingdom which cannot be moved because you could come here today and you could fall tomorrow if all your build on is is religion but if you ever get into Christ it'll hold you it'll hold you through every Church trouble it'll hold you through every trial and tribulation oh that's what we're working for amen we're not here to argue our Creeds our politics we're here to work for the kingdom of God brother amen oh but you don't have to put down your weapon entirely you just got to learn which kingdom to fight for for Paul said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places yes sir Amen brother Brandon was preaching hear ye himm and he said you know the reason we can't run everybody it's not in an arena you know it is an arena but now it's a church here he was having Church in Arena in an arena and he said Brothers will be fighting Brothers tomorrow night but we're fighting the devil tonight in this Arena we want to make it the Church of God Amen brother brandom as a man of God can convert an arena into a church but the danger is that we never want to do is to convert the church into an arena and turn it fight for the wrong Kingdom and turn your sword on your brother or your sister and turn your weapon on your neighbor but we've wrestled not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers oh go ahead but we're in a battle Satan is a liar and he's come to Rob your joy he's come to Rob your victory but I've got a sword tonight of the word of the Lord and we've come to hack away at every Spirit of condemnation every spirit of fear every Spirit of unbelief that will try to hold you in your cage of defeat and darkness oh that's not where you belong daughter of God you don't belong in a cage you belong in the heavenlies with the Eagles of almighty God oh so pick up your sword and fight for the kingdom of God oh we've got a lot to fight for we got of needs sir oh but turn it on the devil oh we turn to prayer we turn to the word and watch devil scatter as the people of God yes my brother oh it's no wonder the devil fights your prayer life it's a powerful weapon placed into the hand of Believers when the weakest Christian gets on their knees the devil trembles and so he tries to keep you from that prayer life because he knows it's effective but oh if we just if you fight through that and you press through that and you press through the the hindrance oh watch the visitation come watch the victory come oh God use his prayer God answers prayer your prayers aren't just hitting the ceiling oh he hears it he's an on time God he knows how to answer just when you need it oh it may look like the darkest hour but watch Jesus come on the scene and turn the situation around he's asleep in the boat sometimes but he hasn't left you he said I'll never leave you forsake you oh he's still in the boat but you might have to go down there and wake him up maybe you have to wake him up with your faith sometimes say Lord I believe your word I'm not looking at the storm I'm looking at your promise Lord would you come on the scene would you speak peace to my storm Lord I don't know if I can go another day but call Jesus on the scene Lord you promised it Lord you said I could have it Lord you will not forget us yes oh he's right on time yes my brother oh he knows all about it my brother oh it may have taken him 21 days to get to Daniel he was in a Day Too Late oh he sees you toiling he sees you struggling he sees you in the middle of your battle oh but he knows and in that darkest hour then Jesus comes along oh he can set the captive free but don't let go of the promise hallelujah oh hold on let your faith call him on the scene oh for every situation yes my brother oh it's a it's a it's a it's a word of the Lord yes my brother it cannot fail take your time oh Mount Transfiguration yes my it ended the struggle because God was establishing a kingdom a Vindicated word that it would no more just be the words of the law and the prophets but that which they had spoken of they had spoken of a messiah coming but now Messiah was here and he was he he he the word had come to light and he was the light of the hour and brother BR want say about it was going from partial realization to perfect realization here here the Israelites had Mana from heaven but here Jesus was the true bread from Heaven that's exactly they had had partial salvation under the blood of blls and goats but here was the whole of Salvation you know Israel had light in the days of Egypt but here was true light here was the Fulfillment of light Moses was a prophet Jesus was the prophet David was a king of Israel Jesus was the greater David am the king of kings yes sir yes my brother and Peter wrote about this Mount Transfiguration that's right and he said more ever I will endeavor yes sir that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance always for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory that's right this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased yes sir and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount now here this we have also a more sure word of Prophecy that's it where onto you do well that you take heed so see that you refuse it not as onto a light that shineth in a dark place yes until the day Dawn and the day star rise in your hearts knowing this first that no that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation that's exact there may have been a period of time where that men had come up with private interpretations of how the Messiah would come and maybe there was a period of time where they didn't know if that was the true interpretation or not because it hadn't come to pass yet but God God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and here come the true interpretation of the word into their midst and say they no longer had to wonder if the private interpretation was right they had a true interpretation in their midst they were walking in the light of the Vindicated word that day star that would shine upon their paths amen oh in a falling apart World God sent them a messiah yes my brother amen and we can walk in the light of the Vindicated word yes my brother glory to God and let it consume Our Lives yes sir see something's going to consume you amen you'll be consumed by something maybe certain hobes consume your lives or or certain habits consume your lives or even in the positive things can cons consume your time they may not always be bad but but you're constantly being consumed by one thing or another and something will have the first place in your life but thank God that that it was written in Hebrews that our God is a consuming fire amen See Fire is the most consuming thing that there is brother B said certainly we just need the fire he said let the fires go out in the church brother and the church is gone they said there was an old Baptist brother that got saved one time and they told him if he didn't quit quit preaching like that that he was going to kill his church and that brother got up and he said look here Elder he said any church that ever dies with the Holy Ghost fire in it he said I'll climb the old Vines out there to the top of this pinnacle and lay my hands and say blessed is the law the dead defying the law he said they don't die they just get alive they died the things of the world in order to come to life in Jesus Christ am amen because brother brandom one time he was with his brother and they went out and they found a turtle and that Turtle when they come up to it it tucked its head into it shell he they like those old mossback Christians sometimes and so they took the turtle and they took a stick and they tried to beat it to get its head to come out and it didn't work they took it and they tried to drown it in water and just a few bubbles come up but it it didn't do anything then they went and they lit a fire under that turtle and that caused that Turtle to move that put something under him to move and if you want to see a church move forward you don't beat them up with a bunch of Law and a bunch of legalism oh it's not that you baptize them Face Forward backward but let the fire of God Loos in the house of God that will do more than every stick that'll do more than every carnal commandment let the power of God loosen the church to set children of God free from the habits that have consumed them from the world that has consumed us but there is a fire of God that can consume greater than any devil could ever consume you greater than every habit could ever consume you but if you ever lay your life on the altar of God as a living sacrifice with a genuine heart there is a fire that is still in the midst of the church today that can fall down upon your life burn out the world and you can be consumed as a pig and bed as a lamb of God oh you won't love the world or the things of the world anymore I'm talking about an experience on the backside of the deserts you oh I'm not talking about a handshaking I'm not talking about putting your name on a book no sir talking about a reality I'm talking about a consuming fire oh it's the fire that led the children of Israel it's the fire that was had his picture taken with brother brandom it's the fire that was with Moses it was the fire that was in the Lion's Den with Daniel that fire hasn't left the church it can still consume your life it can burn out every habit every addiction every drug addiction every every religious addiction every unbelief oh there is a consuming fire that is able to burn out everything contrary to this word and birth you forth yes sir oh it's still God's Avenue you see in Genesis there was a fiery cherums guarding the tree of life and they had it come by the way of fire but there was a time when those cherums were keeping from entering into that Garden that's right but those choms are not keeping us from entering now now they're ushering us in but still brother brandom said the Holy Spirit fire guarding the gate he said and today that's what guards the gate if you're scared of Holy Ghost and Fire you'll never get in that's it fiery the sword of God God is a consuming fire watching that tree yes my brother glory to God it it's the power of God oh those lines wouldn't come to Daniel when that fire was there that's it cuz like brother Brandon sang that song it's the old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me and if it was good enough for brother brandom it's good enough for me yes sir oh God can do a work in your life amen amen it's a consuming fire and sometimes it's consuming in judgment yes sir you know in Genesis 19 was the first time fire was mentioned and it said then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and gomorra brimstone and fire that's right and Jude picked it up in Jude one and he's talking about the the Angels which kept not their first estate but left their habitation Heath reserved in Everlasting chains outer Darkness under the Judgment of the great day and then he says even as Sodom and gomor and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh or set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire and brother Brandon picks up that Eternal fire and says to be completely consumed and done away with for for he would show us and someone would ask him a question and question and answers on Hebrews about how how if they do not burn eternally cuz we know he would taught us that it wasn't an eternal hell that's exactly but for a space of time he said then What Becomes of them and he's explaining this and and we're just showing the contrast here he said will it be just like regular Brimstone he said I believe it'll be a million times worse that I believe you couldn't describe it by fire by aital fire but the only reason it's put by fire that fire is the most consuming thing that we have exactly right and he said that it absolutely consumes and destroys everything sir fire does he said well then it'll be in there but you have a soul that'll have to be punished through some kind that's it and then he says now you have to watch the word fire because the Holy Ghost is used the Holy Ghost in fire amen because Holy Ghost Fire Burns Out sin and makes clean so you see there is a point in your life where you'll have to come in contact with fire and you'll either be saved by fire or destroyed by fire but here is showing us there is a contrast there is a judgment fire but there is a Holy Ghost Fire which just like God is going to cleanse this Earth with Holy Fire so that we might dwell in it in the future home and in in the in the eternities with him there is a holy ghost fire that cleans out the individual so that God might dwell in that individual it'll have to be more he he'll give you a new spirit he'll begin to change you but then he'll put his spirit in you but it's got to cleanse out the habits he got to cleanse out the the humanity and the carnal desires and put inside of you a transformation that his life might dwell in you amen just like Elijah on Mount Carmel that they he could say let the god that is God answer by Fire and Fire could fall and consume the sacrifice on the altar yes sir amen and there is a fire that can roll off the Altar and consume your life yes sir oh and it and I've got a a powerful something that encourages me is that if you're ever once saved by fire then you can't be destroyed by fire if the fire of God ever once consumes you then brother there's not enough devils in hell to destroy you there's not enough judgment to destroy you you can't burn it out of the of the people of God they couldn't burn it out of the Hebrew children and said the fire would have no power over their bodies and they didn't even smell like fire and that's a true believer that comes through the trials and the tribulations of life and Satan is shooting his fiery darts at you but fire cannot burn out fire they cannot burn it out of the Hebrew children and they cannot burn it out of the Sons and Daughters of God for the Holy Ghost is fire itself and Fire Can't burn fire and the fire couldn't boil fire when they tried to put John in a vat of oil they couldn't boil it out because there was something in John there was a keeping power there was a fire of the Holy Ghost that burned inside of them oh and it kept them through every trial amen and Satan cannot blow it out God has lit a fire in the church of the Living God that cannot be blown out by any Winds of opposition by any Winds of torment and any Winds of Trials there is not enough wind that the devil has to blow out the fire that's been lit in the life of a son and daughter of God because brother random showed us as the children of Israel followed that great Pillar of Fire he said there was a wind that followed and that wind opened up that Red Sea and he said when men walk in the light the winds follow and the winds that follow this light of God that we walk in those winds are greater than any Winds of doctrine that the devil has Winds of doctrine that have come in and destroyed homes Winds of doctrine that have destroyed lies Winds of doctrine that have destroyed churches oh come on you've maybe felt some of those winds and why are you still here because you are walking in the light of the Vindicated word you're walking in the light of the day star you're walking in the light of the message of the hour the evening light has come and as you walk in the light there is a mighty rushing wind that follows behind you and it's a greater wind than every wind of Doctrine than every wind of opposition oh it's the wind of God Amen oh you which have been saved by fire you will not be destroyed by fire yes my brother oh yes my brother there is no place in the L of fire for me there is no place in hell for for me that's it because I've been consumed by another fire and I'll just read this one for you brother brandom said a man who would say could believe that the church will go through a tribulation period he said I wonder where you'd ever get a siege for that and man this is a refrigerator quote when even will you say I believe it says this that the that's all right did you notice back there yonder where the rains fell in the other time where did it fall Noah was in the ark before judgment struck and he would say that Sodom l was out of Sodom before it taken place is that we ain't going through no tribulation period you're going in the Rapture one of these days certainly why do you have to be judged he stood my tribulation Jesus Christ that's where my tribulation taken place right there I accepted him and free when I see the blood I'll pass over you that's right Moses was safely protected from is with Israel while the tribulation fell what is it friends oh you can identify tribulation is either in your future it's in your past but tribulation is not in my future tribulation is in my past because Jesus Christ already bore my tribulation on Calvary and when I accepted that blood sacrifice and the fire of the Holy Ghost came back upon my life I've been set free my future is clear the future of this bride is clear tribulation is not in your future tribulation is in your past because you cannot be destroyed by judgment fire a fire will have no harm on those that have been born into the Heavenly Kingdom it's a kingdom which cannot be moved it's a kingdom that's going to last through all generations and ages oh it's a loosing power it's a consuming fire oh why because he that heareth my words and believeth on him that set me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life he that heareth my words hear ye him and receive it as a voice of Pardon receive it as a voice of Deliverance oh you don't have to live in that battle of fear any longer he has not given you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind brother oh that devil of fear is no match to the consuming fire of almighty God and I pray that God's fire will come by your mind and cleanse it oh and wash of every fear every mind battle every complex every inferior complex that you're not good enough and nobody loves you oh let the fire of God consume you tonight Glory oh and take all your habits from glory to God hallelujah amen oh hear his voice it's the same fire that always was this is not a new fire this is the fire that God lit his sacred altar with this is the fire that dwelt in those candlesticks which John saw on the aisle of patmas this is the fire that the priest took and he lit the first candle and they took the first candle and they lit the second candle to the third to the fourth to the fifth to the sixth to the seventh oh and God had seven Messengers to tend the flame throughout Seven Ages oh you have not been consumed with a strange denominational fire fire that consumed your life it's the fire from the altar of God that has been poured out in this generation it's the message of the hour it's the flame of the hour and it's the flame that's in my heart oh it's not confusion it's a voice that has Set Me Free oh and this fire does not make Fanatics this fire takes Fanatics and it makes Saints out of them oh we are not scared of wildfire we are not scared of this fire it is the fire of God it is the fire from the Throne of God oh but God is going to need some people that'll keep that flame alive oh because they denominated in every age they denominated and that fire would go out and they would have to pass the torch light to the Next Generation but friends there's not another age coming there's not another church age coming but every True Believer your life the wick of your life has been dipped into that tame oil you've been put on fire by the fire of God you've got oil in your lamp it's been lit by God you are manifesting the word for your day and there is a bride who will not add to this word who will not take from this word and God has sent us a message that cannot be denominated oh brother say that usually after 3 years a message will go into organization and he would say this one's been going up for 20 years and it's still going and that was about 60 years ago so it's been about 80 years and the same fire that was there in brother brandom's day it is still burning in the hearts of his believing children oh don't let it go out take this word and hide it in your hearts oh we're not here to quench the fire we're not here to add to what the prophet said we're not here to take away from what the prophet said we're here to take the message of the hour and fan the Flames of the fire of God The Winds of the Holy Ghost would blow behind it and pick up our young people and fill them with the Holy Ghost and set free every captive oh it would pick up the elders that have been bound in religion and never got a reality but there is a holy ghost in the building tonight oh that you can be changed I'm talking about a change I'm talking about a reality you don't have to stay where you're at oh you may have struggled with that habit for years oh but let the Holy Ghost oh say Lord I'll be a Living Sacrifice oh burn it out of me Lord It's the fire of God it's the fire from the Throne of God oh it won't go out it can't go out it's God's purpose that this flame will burn under the coming of the lord it's a torch light of freedom and it's burning in my heart and it's burning in your heart yes my brother take your time I don't know about you I want to be a keeper of this flame take your time I I don't want to add to it I I want to keep it burning am oh by staying with the word of God God is establishing a kingdom that's on the wordu oh it's a kingdom which cannot be moved and that kingdom is Christ oh and anything will fall if it's not on the word of God but God has a kingdom Hallelujah you see when the king had lost his wife Ashy and and she had done what she did and she had fallen he was going to have to look for somebody else to establish his kingdom with and so he could look out across the kingdom and say who will it be and and one could maybe be a little prettier and one could maybe look a little nicer according to the world standards but there was an Esther in the land and Esther only required what Hagi appointed she didn't want anything more she didn't want anything less and whatever the tutor appointed she would just say be it onto me that's what I want I don't want anymore I don't want any less and when Hagi could go back to the king I could imagine that he would bring back a good report that Esther was following whatever he appointed whatever he desired that's what she would take and so when God would send a messenger into this age and he would look out across all the denominations and all the churches and he would see that that there was some that were very pretty and that very big buildings but they would not only require what Hagi appointed but there was a bride who only wanted what the message appointed who only wanted what the word said they said I don't want to add to it I don't want to take it away it's good enough for me and when Esther humbled herself to that word she found herself not dead in the presence of the king but exalted to ad join there and she requested that her and her family would be saved oh and there is a bride that is on the scene that only required what this elaser appointed she's been dressed in the garments of the word and she's been exalted to join HS she's been lifted up into a kingdom oh that cannot fall away and she's been trusted with ask what you will and it shall be given unto you oh as we draw to close oh let's catch this there was a Hatty ride and the first time that new ministry was ever used on an individual it was used on a little water woman it wasn't even in a church it was in a home but as her voice rang out out brother brand that's nothing but the truth there came a creative power that swept over brother Brandon and told her to ask what you will and it shall be given unto you and like Esther she had a desire for the Salvation of her family that they wouldn't be destroyed and so he spoke for her two sons and that she received what she asked for but why did God send it to her because he knew what she would ask he knew if she ever sent it to the aristocrats and those man they would ask things that would build a kingdom onto themselves they would ask things that weren't right but he sent it to a little humble widow woman who would ask something that would not exalt herself but would exalt the kingdom of God because this bride her desire is a true Mount Transfiguration experience to only glorify Jesus Christ and oh there there why did God trust you with this message why did he ever send this anointing upon your life because he knew you would do with it he knew that you wouldn't use it to build a kingdom onto yourself he knew that you wouldn't use it to exalt yourself but he said I can trust them with this message they'll only use it to live for me there'll be a join a there'll be a queen that I can reign with and Rule with for all eternity oh there's a prde that's been lifted up into a join a position that's been established with the father oh and he chose you according to his good pledge meure and we are not ashamed of this message like that young girl that stood on those train steps and looked at her mother burned in a fire and she was ashamed of her mother but you know the reason that this bride is so beautiful is because this word had to become ugly Jesus had to go he had to hang on a cross he had to bled he had to die he had to be whipped with stripes 39 till he was bleeding till he he he he was there in such Agony and such pain and there come a prophet who was rejected he was laughed at scorned and made fun of but this message took on that form so that I might be beautiful so that I might walk in a pure spotless garment and I am not ashamed of it I'm not ashamed of this voice I'm not ashamed to be identified with this message it's a kingdom that cannot fall apart amen as the musicians come in the prophecy of his coming Isaiah said the grass withth and the flower fadeth but the word of the God shall stand forever and when Isaiah was prophesy uh brother BR tells that God made it fragile so that it would break God made these things all these denominations and all these things were made fragile so that they could and would break but remember we got to Kingdom that's solid and that kingdom is in you as a Believer that's been born again it's a kingdom that but the Bible would say that except a man be born of water and spirit he cannot enter the kingdom but but but but you which have been born again into this Kingdom it's a kingdom which cannot be moved it's a kingdom which cannot fall apart and so if that kingdom is in you then you cannot fall apart you are a people that that cannot be moved your mind you may go back and forth and sometimes in your spirit you may be encouraged and sometimes discouraged but there is a soul that is anchored to the Rock of Ages and cannot be moved by any wind of the Devil by any fiery trial and that's why you're still here because before there ever was a world to fall apart before there ever was a denomination to fall there was a God and I was in him before the foundation of the world I I I wasn't just created Out of the Dust of this Earth but but there was a soul that was put into that dust and that Soul came from God oh a part of an immovable God an immovable Kingdom oh we can't fall apart We Won't Be Shaken so we're going to remain because we can't be shaken it says in Hebrews this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain oh why are you still here through all the trials through all the tribulations there is a kingdom which cannot be moved and so we're going to remain and to those that are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord oh there will be a change for God's people that have been established on this Kingdom oh between now and then the winds may blow and the winds may come but there is a stability oh he started the work and he can finish it would you stand to your feet amen we've received a word to end the struggle uh uh you know that in the first coming of the Lord there was a Jordan River and then his second coming there was an Ohio River in this first coming there was a mount Transfiguration but in this second coming there was a mount Sunset oh and there there was a mighty Angel clothed with a cloud and brother Brandon was up in that mount having a a having a conference with that Mighty Angel and he come back he seen he seen that vision of those constellations of birds and of angels and there was a blast that went off loud that was almost like he would describe it as kind almost like a sonic boom like something breaking the sound barrier and he would come back even thinking that maybe it was his own death but what was going on up in that mountain God was adopting his son he was coming back with a message oh that would end the struggle oh we no longer have to wander if we're baptized right we don't have to wonder what the correct Doctrine is on serpent seed and in the Trinity we have the answer that has ended the struggle oh we don't have to worry about private interpretations we have the true interpretation of the word and so what should you do just hear ye him oh let that word consume your life let that Vindicated word consume your mind and throw out every other thought say no Satan I've already heard another voice it says I'm free it says I'm going to make it it says I can have the Holy Ghost Mount what Mount Sunset wasn't the end of brother brandom no it was the end of my struggle that's it oh that like that that Paul that was chopping down that tree trying to trying to get it back to camp and he said why are you struggling just roll it into that river that river goes all the way down to Camp oh and you're struggling struggling with with the word trying to fuss with it and fight with it don't fuss with it just ride on it it's a kingdom which cannot be moved it's a Vindicated word yes oh and if you just just let it consume your life oh let it take you home back to Camp where we came from amen glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen amen may we just bow our heads for a word of prayer amen we just so love you Hallelujah so appreciate your attentiveness Hallelujah and we thank the Lord for allowing us to gather hallelujah amen and maybe it would be for the last time the Lord knows what he's doing but but he has a way of doing things and if he saw fit to T and have this meeting then I believe he had a purpose for it and maybe there be someone here tonight that you be in a struggle oh you've been trying to fight with it you've been trying to press into it but brother Brandon would say that we press and we quiver and we get in frustrations and doubts thinking I must press and he said it isn't that it's just yielding realizing that you're nothing just let him completely take you over take over your thinking take over you see maybe that fire has consumed your your flesh and you you've started to dress right you started to to put on the right kind of clothes and you come to church and maybe the fire has consumed your spirit caused you to act right cause you to have a brotherly kindness and bear the fruits of the spirit but in your soul maybe you're still struggling with this word maybe you're still struggling with the message is it even true oh that devil is no respector of persons that's right he'll attack the young people he'll attack the elders but but there is a fire it's a dissolver of all doubts and Moses could spend five minutes in the presence of that fire and be completely different you know they say a residence can be totally engulfed within 5 minutes oh and you are a three compartment person you've got a body a spirit and a soul amen but what do we need is that fire to totally consume amen every compartment of Our Lives oh the body the spirit and the Soul am all that you could have an overcoming life then you'll be able to keep the victory Hallelujah then you then you'll fall down sometimes maybe but you'll get back up if you've got a need tonight maybe you need a the baptism of the Holy Ghost maybe you need a refilling I believe we still have a high priest which can come by and refill those lamps with that oil like they did on that sacred altar Heavenly Father lord lord your word is true yes Lord and Lord we have taken heed to it tonight

before Lord would you just encourage your weary children tonight Lord Lord sometimes we get Battle weary but Lord it'll be worth it all when we get to that other side so father we offer your word
