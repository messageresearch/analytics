[8:15] we're going to do it one more time
[8:18] before we do I just want you to think
[8:20] about with all the things that are going
[8:22] on right now and Satan trying to take
[8:24] this message away from us he's trying to
[8:26] take the truth he's trying to take the
[8:28] word away from us because he knows that
[8:30] it said that if a bride can catch a
[8:33] glimpse of who she is and what she
[8:35] stands for she'll be an invincible Army
[8:37] and I might not have quoted that right
[8:39] so y'all forgive me brother Stephen can
[8:40] quote it correctly when he gets up but
[8:42] think about that if we can catch a
[8:44] glimpse of who we truly are in the world
[8:47] word we're an invincible Army so as
[8:50] Satan tries to take that message from us
[8:51] take the truth from us we're going to
[8:53] stand for it we're going to stand for
[8:55] the truth we're going to take back ways
[8:56] trying to steal from us and we're going
[8:58] to put them under our our feet so I
[8:59] wonder if you could do it one more time
[9:01] with me tonight well I went to the
[9:04] enemy's camp and I took back what he
[9:09] stole from me and I took back what he
[9:14] stole from me and I took back what he
[9:19] stole from me and I went to the
[9:24] enemy and I took back what he stole from
[9:29] me me and now he's under my Fe under
[9:34] my's
[9:37] under under my feet he's under
[9:41] myet under
[9:43] myet Satan is under my feet

[10:37] you don't think is Christlike point it
[10:39] out because I want to correct it and I

[39:36] of Joseph seems like it is completely
[39:39] denied no matter how many proof you can
[39:42] bring this Pharaoh will never
[39:45] acknowledge Joseph not because the
[39:48] message of Joseph is wrong not because
[39:52] what Joseph accomplished was not true
[39:55] but because someone just deliberately

[1:01:31] picture of that
[1:01:35] clowd
[1:01:36] amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:01:39] right here we find out that the coming
[1:01:41] of the seven Angel the coming of the
[1:01:44] cloud brother bam referred to that
[1:01:47] coming as the seven Thunder which is the
[1:01:50] experience on the mountain which is the
[1:01:53] adoption of brother Bram that absortion
[1:01:56] goes with the cloud and that absoption
[1:01:59] goes with the three witness following
[1:02:02] that what happened a prophetic
[1:02:05] message
[1:02:07] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the
[1:02:10] name of the Lord notice the very same
[1:02:14] day when this messenger not when he
[1:02:17] start on but when he begin to do what
[1:02:22] declare his message see the first p
[1:02:26] what you need to preach with
[1:02:29] me the second pull
[1:02:31] what the third pull the what opening of
[1:02:35] the word the opening of the word the
[1:02:38] mystery revealed everybody clear the
[1:02:42] third pool was the opening of them seven
[1:02:46] to reveal the hidden truth that has been
[1:02:48] seal in the what is the attraction on
[1:02:52] the mountain so I got my man set on this
[1:02:55] water
[1:02:57] that is the what so the message is the
[1:03:01] third po after the Thunder follow the
[1:03:06] third po after the month experience
[1:03:09] follow a sure word of Prophecy or a
[1:03:14] prophetic
[1:03:17] message Peter was giving you the three
[1:03:20] element of the seven
[1:03:22] seal everybody clear
[1:03:26] let that soak we can r with this but
[1:03:30] remember all this time Noah was in the
[1:03:33] ark the bride is sealing with Christ the
[1:03:37] last member has been revealed the six
[1:03:40] seal has produced itself the seven seal
[1:03:43] do as what bring him back to what so we
[1:03:47] found out that seal bring the Thunder
[1:03:51] that seal bring the third pool and that
[1:03:54] seal bring us so
[1:03:56] what the coming of the
[1:03:59] Lord the lamb come and took the book out
[1:04:03] of the right hand of him and sat down
[1:04:06] and claim what he own what he had with
[1:04:08] him that's right it's always been that
[1:04:12] third pool now do you notice on the
[1:04:15] opening of this seven seal it is also a
[1:04:19] three-fold
[1:04:21] mystery this one I have the Thunder will

[1:04:37] it shall be what right there the coming
[1:04:40] of what Christ say no one knew what

[1:10:08] $1 brother Bram never say look at the $5
[1:10:12] bill he never say look at $100 bill he

[1:10:20] bill I told you I'm shooting differently
[1:10:23] amen they all two sons here there is a
[1:10:27] pyramid on the east side on the west
[1:10:31] side with an eye and a Capstone over
[1:10:35] there and on the Easter side I spoke
[1:10:38] about this just touch it a little bit
[1:10:40] there is a eagle on the other side
[1:10:42] everybody clear when you look over there
[1:10:46] it is showing brother bam called this
[1:10:48] the Great Seal and it's called in the
[1:10:50] United States the Great Seal and We Know
[1:10:53] by the message of the hour that the
[1:10:55] Great Seal is speaking about the seventh
[1:10:58] seal which is bringing the Capstone and
[1:11:01] that Capstone in the shape of a pyramid
[1:11:05] is the constellation of the seven Angel
[1:11:08] which is called the seven Thunders
[1:11:10] everybody clear everybody so far praise
[1:11:13] the name of the Lord now in that image
[1:11:17] of there there is a light because the
[1:11:19] message coming is the evening light
[1:11:22] remember there is a prophetic message
[1:11:24] that is the light you need to hold on to
[1:11:27] it in the darkness of laia until Jesus
[1:11:31] come until the revelation of the Rapture
[1:11:35] unfold to you then we going into the
[1:11:37] Rapture everybody clear so it's the
[1:11:40] evening light that eye brother bam say
[1:11:43] that it's the eye of God and we know in
[1:11:46] the Book of Revelation that the lamb
[1:11:48] have seven eyes everybody clear which is
[1:11:51] speaking about the spirit of God
[1:11:53] everybody clear if you look down here
[1:11:56] there is a uh Enlighten phrase here that
[1:12:01] say novel or seclorum which mean new
[1:12:06] world order so when the Capstone is
[1:12:10] coming the Capstone is coming to
[1:12:13] establish a new world order because the
[1:12:17] seven seal will also AER the
[1:12:23] Millennium if you remember the image of
[1:12:26] Daniel when the stone came the stone
[1:12:29] never hit the
[1:12:31] head the stone hit the feet which is the
[1:12:35] Roman Empire that is not under Pagan
[1:12:39] Rome but unto peer Ro and he destroys
[1:12:42] the image and this Stone begin to grow
[1:12:45] and take over bringing the New Order of
[1:12:49] the
[1:12:51] world everybody clear bringing the
[1:12:54] Eternal Kingdom
[1:12:55] but when you go on the other side you
[1:12:58] going to see that there is an ego that
[1:13:01] ego have a scroll that is
[1:13:05] open because on Sunset Mountain it is
[1:13:08] the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 and in
[1:13:11] Revelation 10 when the mighty Angel come
[1:13:14] down he come with an open book an open
[1:13:18] scroll everybody clear then they gave
[1:13:21] the scroll to brother Bram they told him
[1:13:24] go back east
[1:13:25] the event happened on the west side but
[1:13:28] the preaching the scroll in the mouth of
[1:13:32] the Prophet will be preached on the east
[1:13:35] side a
[1:13:39] Jeffersonville would Pharaoh believe
[1:13:41] this
[1:13:42] one
[1:13:44] amen the scroll which speak about the
[1:13:47] open scroll or the open book on the
[1:13:50] scroll there is also a saying that say
[1:13:54] PR
[1:13:56] it means out of
[1:13:58] many one so the message of this
[1:14:07] ego is not a specific message follow me
[1:14:13] carefully we told you that Paul
[1:14:15] preaching part AR preaching part and we
[1:14:19] told you that the reason why the seven
[1:14:22] Chamberlain are sent because every angel
[1:14:26] that work with the messenger must be
[1:14:29] there to bring the left over of Paul the
[1:14:32] left over of arenus the left over of
[1:14:36] colba the light of the moon will be like
[1:14:39] the light of the sun and the light of
[1:14:41] that sun will be like the light of how
[1:14:43] many days so it's a message that pick up
[1:14:47] many and make one out of many out of
[1:14:51] seven Angel come one message
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] brother R help me this great warrior has
[1:15:03] come on the scene such as arenus and
[1:15:06] Martin St Martin and polycarp and the
[1:15:09] different ones and Luther and Wesley all
[1:15:12] of them as how they have come and just
[1:15:16] live long enough to kind of bring the
[1:15:18] light and shment but they left many
[1:15:22] things
[1:15:23] what in darkness Along come the
[1:15:26] Pentecostal age like the Lutheran age
[1:15:29] and they run out on lims but still all
[1:15:32] right don't say they was not right
[1:15:36] brother Bram acknowledge that the
[1:15:39] message of Luther the message of wesle
[1:15:42] the message of all other people that
[1:15:45] preach their message are right but they
[1:15:49] left some loose end brother Bram could
[1:15:53] not reject the message
[1:15:55] because you was still the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost you need to refocus how you
[1:16:02] understand the message amen but still
[1:16:05] all right don't say they was not right
[1:16:09] they were in other word I acknowledge
[1:16:11] them I acknowledge nox I acknowledge fin
[1:16:14] I acknowledge this one okay but there is
[1:16:18] loose end left that can be explained but
[1:16:22] then why the seals has been broke to
[1:16:26] thoroughly reveal what these things are
[1:16:29] in other words my message of the seven
[1:16:31] seal pick up the L end and bring one
[1:16:35] message out of many comes
[1:16:38] one everybody clear brother Bram now you
[1:16:42] see I'm not just making that up it's not
[1:16:46] a fable it is that save the Lord I shall
[1:16:50] read it to you out of the book The Sing
[1:16:53] of the seven Angel message the mystery
[1:16:55] of God should be finished that's been
[1:16:57] declared by his holy prophet that is the
[1:17:00] prophet who has wrote the word and the
[1:17:02] sing of the seven Angel seven Church AG
[1:17:06] the last Church AG all the what losing
[1:17:11] that through these ages has been what
[1:17:14] brother bam say this mystery were probed
[1:17:17] they were preached by
[1:17:20] people and it will be War up together
[1:17:24] out of many comes one the lamb was
[1:17:28] breaking the seals and God's seal was
[1:17:30] not going to reveal it he was left for
[1:17:33] the last day we had Syble and we were
[1:17:36] prob at that so before brother bam come
[1:17:40] God already left the Book of Revelation
[1:17:42] in sble so any preacher can come look it
[1:17:46] up and the Holy Spirit can show you
[1:17:48] something and you preach but you're not
[1:17:50] going to preach the entire
[1:17:52] truth everybody say he said and they
[1:17:56] done
[1:17:57] what brother Bram didn't say they did
[1:18:01] bad they done very good sometime but we
[1:18:05] know it's moving right on but now in the
[1:18:09] last day we can look back and see where
[1:18:11] he has been and that is supposed to be
[1:18:14] done that at the end of the church age
[1:18:17] just before the Rapture so what brother
[1:18:20] Bram is telling you here that there were
[1:18:22] people that preached before him
[1:18:25] and brother bam acknowledge that those
[1:18:28] people were right sometime but they just
[1:18:31] have loose end and my Ministry is to
[1:18:35] pick up those Len and correct them and
[1:18:38] give you a full
[1:18:40] word let me read galatian 2 you can read
[1:18:44] it at home verse 1 and two this is Paul
[1:18:48] Paul met the pillar of fire Paul went
[1:18:51] into Arabia he preached uh he stayed
[1:18:54] there three years he came back and Paul
[1:18:56] begin to preach the gospel everybody
[1:18:59] here now when Paul was preaching the
[1:19:02] gospel they begin to record the gospel
[1:19:05] of Paul when Paul preach in celissia Leo
[1:19:08] and G are there they are recording the
[1:19:11] message of Paul everybody clear when
[1:19:13] Paul preach in Arizona somebody will
[1:19:16] call the message of Paul when Paul
[1:19:18] preach in North Carolina somebody record
[1:19:21] the message of Paul so after 14 years
[1:19:25] after follow me very good I went up to
[1:19:30] what so Paul after preaching 14 years he
[1:19:35] said you know what I heard that there
[1:19:37] are some believer over there I just need
[1:19:40] to go meet with the big guys that preach
[1:19:43] the gospel before
[1:19:45] me everybody there and I went up by
[1:19:50] Revelation and communicated unto them I
[1:19:53] spoke with them I met nox I met finny I
[1:19:57] met sanki I met Luther I met Wesley and
[1:20:01] I begin to talk to them everybody
[1:20:04] there that gospel which I preach among
[1:20:08] the so Paul heard the gospel he was
[1:20:10] preaching but when Paul went after 14
[1:20:14] years to Jerusalem the those in
[1:20:17] Jerusalem were also preaching the gospel
[1:20:21] but they never seen each other in jerus
[1:20:25] they recorded Peter they recorded bemy
[1:20:29] they recorded
[1:20:32] Thomas you follow me but privately to
[1:20:37] them which were of what the big preacher
[1:20:41] of
[1:20:42] Jerusalem I preach 14 years I don't know
[1:20:46] what Peter is preaching Peter also is
[1:20:49] preaching he doesn't know what Paul is
[1:20:52] preaching now Paul and Peter
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:58] Peter have his steps Paul has his steps
[1:21:02] Peter have his books Paul has his
[1:21:08] books Let's by any mean I should run and
[1:21:13] head run in V Paul preach preach preach
[1:21:16] preach he say wait a minute let me check
[1:21:18] the guys that started before me make
[1:21:20] sure that we are still ling up together
[1:21:24] everybody clear everybody clear no no no
[1:21:27] no no no no no those guys have their
[1:21:30] message and Paul has his message so Paul
[1:21:34] message and the message logically it
[1:21:36] must be different we don't want anybody
[1:21:38] to copy one
[1:21:43] another are you there I don't know why
[1:21:46] the Holy Spirit wants somebody to be re
[1:21:48] adjusted if you watch crazy stuff but
[1:21:52] one of those who seems to be somewhat
[1:21:56] the big one amen whatsoever they were he
[1:22:00] makes no matter to me Paul is arrogant
[1:22:03] so he mean none of those preacher Peter
[1:22:06] say he should have said I remember Peter
[1:22:09] with respect oh James oh John you were
[1:22:11] the one sleeping with Jesus Oh John he
[1:22:15] say no matter who they
[1:22:16] are I'm reading to you the Bible okay
[1:22:20] God accepted no man's person for they
[1:22:25] who seems to be somewhat in conference
[1:22:28] added
[1:22:29] what so when Paul went to Jerusalem
[1:22:33] after 14 years if you take the sermon of
[1:22:38] Paul you following me and you take the
[1:22:42] sermon of
[1:22:43] Peter Paul was the biggest plist there
[1:22:53] is let me repeat it again are you there
[1:22:57] when you go to Jerusalem they give you
[1:23:00] the message of John they give you the
[1:23:02] message of James they give you the
[1:23:04] message of Peter you begin to read the
[1:23:06] book of Peter and if you go take the
[1:23:09] sermon of Paul and you put them together
[1:23:12] it seems like Paul was repeating
[1:23:16] them away with the message of Paul Paul
[1:23:20] was a
[1:23:21] plist Paul was copying other the people
[1:23:27] message uhhuh that's right okay right
[1:23:32] okay if you are
[1:23:35] there and you listen to PA 14
[1:23:40] years you listen to the tape of Paul you

[1:30:28] to go because it's Wednesday when we
[1:30:31] spoke about Esther let's go back to
[1:30:34] First
[1:30:35] Peter uh second Peter chapter
[1:30:37] 1 I thought I'm going to get into
[1:30:44] this if you hear somebody coming with
[1:30:47] crazy things he copies somebody word by
[1:30:50] word Paul was the most greatest plist
[1:30:55] is you calling the holy spirit
[1:31:02] pluris
[1:31:05] amen that's the spirit sometime that
[1:31:07] came upon the
[1:31:09] Apostle Jesus preached somebody heard
[1:31:11] him he goes He begin to cast out
[1:31:14] devil and the Apostle say uhuh he's not
[1:31:17] with us in other word the Revelation
[1:31:19] must come this way not over there Jesus
[1:31:23] say if he is for me how can he be
[1:31:26] against me how can I reject what lther
[1:31:29] preach how can I reject what w preach
[1:31:33] how do you expect me to say what he
[1:31:34] preach is
[1:31:36] wrong the only problem is Luther could
[1:31:39] preach justification but he was smoking
[1:31:42] that's
[1:31:43] right when I come and preach that
[1:31:46] cigarette must come out that's right
[1:31:48] that's the difference
[1:31:50] that's
[1:31:52] amen second Peter chapter 2 1:2 we were
[1:31:57] on verse 19 we have also a more sure
[1:32:00] word of Prophecy where unto you you do
[1:32:04] well that you take heed as to a light
[1:32:07] that shine in a dark place until the day
[1:32:10] down and the day star arise in your
[1:32:12] heart the Revelation for the rupture now
[1:32:15] this is where we getting with hat
[1:32:17] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[1:32:22] the scripture is of any prate what why
[1:32:26] is not of a Propet
[1:32:28] interpretation verse 21 for the prophecy
[1:32:31] came not in no time by the will of
[1:32:34] who but holy men of God spoke as they
[1:32:39] were moved by what if the prophet were
[1:32:43] speaking by the Holy Ghost for you to
[1:32:47] understand the prophet you need to get
[1:32:49] in contact with the Holy
[1:32:52] Ghost it is the lack of holy ghost that
[1:32:56] we see happening in the
[1:32:59] message amen you don't understand the
[1:33:02] prophet because you don't have the Holy
[1:33:05] Ghost amen Esther first L at Modi and he
[1:33:10] thought there was something natural
[1:33:12] until he sent this man by the word by
[1:33:15] the name of hatak which was the spirit
[1:33:17] of Truth and we refer to you that mod
[1:33:21] sometime it's the messenger and sometime
[1:33:23] is also the
[1:33:25] message the messenger and the message
[1:33:28] brother Bram we found out that when a
[1:33:30] man comes sent from God ordained of God
[1:33:34] with the truth that say the Lord the
[1:33:37] message and the messenger are one and
[1:33:40] the because he said to represent th the
[1:33:44] Lord word by word so he and his message
[1:33:48] is the
[1:33:49] same
[1:33:51] thing then when a man comes with that
[1:33:55] say of the Lord he and his message is
[1:33:57] one when Elijah come with that say of
[1:34:00] the Lord he and his message become one
[1:34:02] just as Jesus when he come he was the
[1:34:05] word St John one so the word of God and
[1:34:08] the messenger of the age was the S same
[1:34:11] thing all the time that is what right
[1:34:14] I'm going to skip this for the sake of
[1:34:16] time are you there so attack we seen it
[1:34:19] on Sunday that he was to of the Holy
[1:34:22] Spirit brother what I'm saying the
[1:34:24] importance of
[1:34:26] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[1:34:29] Believer can never be over
[1:34:32] iniz amen Revelation means more to you
[1:34:36] than perhaps you
[1:34:37] realize lack of revelation will make you
[1:34:41] reject the message oh yeah will make you
[1:34:44] reject the prophetic message but the
[1:34:47] prophetic message is your light in
[1:34:51] darkness amen
[1:34:54] now I'm not talking about this book of
[1:34:56] Revelation and you I'm talking about all
[1:35:00] the Revelation it is tremendously
[1:35:03] important to the church that's why we
[1:35:06] need the Holy
[1:35:08] Ghost he that have near let him hear
[1:35:11] what the spirit say unto the churches it
[1:35:15] may be that
[1:35:17] what we hear this what word the message
[1:35:21] and do what you going to hear the T and
[1:35:24] read the message but how many will pay
[1:35:27] heed to them are you there that we do
[1:35:31] not know but he who learned his ear and
[1:35:34] want to know the word of what the
[1:35:38] message will find the
[1:35:40] what attack
[1:35:43] enlightening if your ear is open to the
[1:35:46] word the spirit of God will make the
[1:35:49] word now that is the work of the can
[1:35:54] teach you the
[1:35:57] truth but if you don't open your ear to
[1:36:01] hear it and your hard to receive it you
[1:36:04] won't get
[1:36:05] the that's why you can listen to tap for
[1:36:08] years and never have the
[1:36:11] Revelation you can preach intellectually
[1:36:14] and never have the Revelation are you
[1:36:18] there brother randam say let me skip
[1:36:21] something quickly
[1:36:25] oh my
[1:36:26] God all right I believe the church is
[1:36:30] beginning to hear the message and
[1:36:32] beginning to understand we got to lay in
[1:36:35] the presence of the son we got to be
[1:36:37] ring our faith is now up intellectually
[1:36:41] we are hearing the message that God gave
[1:36:45] us and seeing the son that he showed and
[1:36:48] proving it by the Bible it's there how
[1:36:51] the church need to lay in the until he
[1:36:54] tenders up you know and get sweet in the
[1:36:57] spirit so he can bir down but when the
[1:37:00] church once gets it the elect is called
[1:37:04] out and separated then in the presence
[1:37:07] of God I know it shall be something like
[1:37:10] the people was there when it takes it
[1:37:13] what Rapture you can receive the message
[1:37:17] intellectually but you need to be there

[1:37:23] of them was born in AA and the other was
[1:37:25] born in Pentecost one has always been

[1:48:37] human part of
[1:48:40] Matthew right let's go and it came to
[1:48:43] pass as they were much
[1:48:45] perpect this is uh verse four about this
[1:48:49] behold what
[1:48:55] according to Luke there were how many
[1:48:59] men why do you still believe the
[1:49:03] Bible why do you still believe the
[1:49:07] Bible now who's saying the
[1:49:10] truth what should I preach to the people
[1:49:13] should I preach to them the version of
[1:49:15] Matthew should I preach to them the
[1:49:17] version of Mark or should I preach to
[1:49:19] them the version of Luke
[1:49:23] which version do you want me to preach

[1:49:44] even a a tombstone on this devil let's
[1:49:47] go to John

[1:50:07] Ghost John had the Holy Ghost were they
[1:50:10] all disciple did they all walk with
[1:50:13] Jesus Christ where is this discrepancy
[1:50:16] coming
[1:50:18] from because it was the Holy Ghost that
[1:50:21] inspired them that's right

[1:54:48] right okay the experience between him
[1:54:51] and the pillar of Fire when he tell
[1:54:53] about that experience Paul says that the
[1:54:56] man heard the voice but they saw no man
[1:55:00] the one that were with
[1:55:02] him the Bible say Paul was filled with
[1:55:05] the spirit and Paul say if anybody
[1:55:07] preaches something different than me
[1:55:09] call him a curse you ready
[1:55:13] yes let's go to act
[1:55:16] 22 and then we
[1:55:18] finish act 22
[1:55:23] verse 6 this is Paul giving his
[1:55:26] testimony before King agria if I'm not
[1:55:30] mistaken everybody there verse 6 and it
[1:55:34] came to pass that as I made my journey
[1:55:36] and was come near to the Mascus about
[1:55:38] noon suddenly they Shone from Heaven a
[1:55:41] great light around about me and I fell

[1:56:01] perfect with what Paul Paul say here
[1:56:03] Paul say here it is consistent chill out
[1:56:06] let's continue verse n and they that
[1:56:10] were with me so indeed
[1:56:14] what act
[1:56:17] 22 they saw
[1:56:19] what Saw the Light
[1:56:24] here they saw
[1:56:30] what okay they heard the voice they
[1:56:34] saw here they saw
[1:56:39] something okay and they that were with
[1:56:43] me so indeed delight and were afraid but
[1:56:45] they heard
[1:56:47] what can you read with me can you read
[1:56:51] loud but they heard not the voice of him
[1:57:03] that do you believe
[1:57:06] Paul why do you believe somebody who
[1:57:09] cannot give his testimony
[1:57:10] [Music]

[1:57:24] contradiction you need the Holy
[1:57:30] Ghost you
[1:57:31] see Paul give a testimony there keep the
[1:57:34] testimony there let's just believe him
[1:57:38] that is the death stroke to Satan when a
[1:57:42] man takes God at his word brother that
[1:57:46] shall kill Satan every
[1:57:50] time that is the hardest hitting that
[1:57:53] Satan can get when a man will take God

[2:00:38] prophet Heavenly Father Lord I'm sorry I
[2:00:42] took a little bit the time but father
[2:00:45] you impress this so hard I don't know
[2:00:48] who watch what I don't know who was
[2:00:50] struggling somewhere
[2:00:52] I don't know who needed to be stabilized
[2:00:54] in a certain area because the enemy
[2:00:57] attack in a different way trying to
[2:01:00] bring
[2:01:01] intellectualism in the message Lord
[2:01:04] father you spoke to us in your Prophet
[2:01:06] that this word is not to be reason out
[2:01:09] this word is to be believed to be taken
[2:01:12] just as it is and to move on Lord father
[2:01:16] how can we follow a God that re Mana
[2:01:19] from Heaven how can we follow follow a
[2:01:22] God that open the Red Sea and we have to
[2:01:25] believe that the Red Sea actually ped
[2:01:28] together and the people walk in dry
[2:01:30] gland how can a human man receive that
[2:01:34] how can a human man conceive that a
[2:01:36] virgin can give birth how can a human
[2:01:39] man conceive that a leper can be
[2:01:42] cleansed and have a skin like a baby how
[2:01:45] can a human Bond believe that you can
[2:01:48] take bread and multiply that how can we
[2:01:52] how how can we even Phantom that in our
[2:01:54] mind if it not by Revelation Hebrews
[2:01:57] chapter 11 you say by Revelation by
[2:02:00] Revelation by Revelation by Revelation
[2:02:03] and you spoke to us tonight Lord that
[2:02:05] Revelation is a work of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:08] father May the Holy Spirit drop down to
[2:02:11] each member each family of this church
[2:02:14] everybody listening Lord father under
[2:02:16] this voice may you granted unto them
[2:02:18] Grace Lord to be connected with the Holy
[2:02:21] Spirit to have their own personal
[2:02:24] revelation their own personal post post
[2:02:28] anchor in their soul that they can rest
[2:02:31] despite the wave despite the difficulty
[2:02:34] despite every doubt the devil is trying
[2:02:37] to S to send Lord because you say that
[2:02:40] Lord father it will be so close to
[2:02:43] deceive the elect if it were possible
[2:02:46] father we commit this church unto the
[2:02:48] hand Lord father may you bless them
[2:02:50] Father help them Lord father and direct
[2:02:53] everything and we commit the uncoming
[2:02:55] service unto their hand and we thank you
[2:02:57] for everything in the name of Jesus
[2:03:00] Christ amen thank you for your time God
[2:03:03] bless you Church
[2:03:11] [Applause]
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:26] amen
[2:03:27] amen I had a scripture here I was going
[2:03:30] to read and brother Stephen I want you
[2:03:33] to listen because if I'm wrong I want
[2:03:35] you to you to correct me but in uh
[2:03:38] Matthew
[2:03:39] 12:40 uh Jesus said for as Jonah was in
[2:03:44] the as Jonah was three days and three
[2:03:47] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[2:03:49] son of man be three days and three
[2:03:50] nights in the heart of the Earth but
[2:03:52] then Through the Bible talks about how
[2:03:54] Jesus was died on the evening before the
[2:03:58] Sabbath and was raised on Resurrection
[2:04:00] Sunday morning so that is not three days
[2:04:03] three nights so I might not have an
[2:04:06] understanding of that but I don't need
[2:04:08] an understanding of that you know what I
[2:04:11] mean we'll understand these things
[2:04:12] better by and by I'm not going to let
[2:04:15] that pull me away from believing the
[2:04:17] Bible I'm not going to let the other
[2:04:19] things that seem to be a discrepancy
[2:04:22] keep me from believing the Bible just
[2:04:23] the same as I'm not going to let these
[2:04:25] things that seem to be conpany keep me
[2:04:27] from believing the message if I have a
[2:04:30] problem like if I'm going to believe
[2:04:33] that in the Bible God spoke through a
[2:04:35] donkey to one of his prophets how much
[2:04:38] how is it hard to believe in the
[2:04:40] cloud it's these things I I tell you
[2:04:43] what like it's the same God is the same
[2:04:44] yesterday today and forever the way he
[2:04:46] was back then he's the same now he's
[2:04:48] going to leave these confusing things
[2:04:50] because it's for the elect it's for a
[2:04:52] chosen people and we can look past and
[2:04:55] we might not have a clear understanding
[2:04:57] but we can look around that and look to
[2:04:58] God cuz we know that it's the word it's
[2:05:01] the word his word doesn't change so I
[2:05:03] might not have an answer for Matthew
[2:05:05] 12:40 and brother Stephen I don't know
[2:05:07] if you do or not but if you do I would
[2:05:08] love to hear it but I don't need an
[2:05:10] answer for it I don't need an answer if
[2:05:13] it was three days three nights if it was
[2:05:15] two and a half days if it was one and a
[2:05:16] half day it doesn't matter cuz you know
[2:05:18] what Christ Rose that's all that
[2:05:22] matters so we don't want to get hung up
[2:05:25] on the mistakes of a man as far as
[2:05:27] William brandom but we just want to
[2:05:29] believe the truth the word that comes
[2:05:31] through it so I mean that's that's
[2:05:33] enough for me brother Stephen I
[2:05:34] appreciate this evening that was that
[2:05:36] was a masterpiece and we'll just sing
[2:05:38] the song as y'all are dismissed this
