leave the pulpit satan will start fighting you more than ever before because he didn't like that he didn't like that so i was just going to remind him and remind anyone that has a testimony in your heart god's done something for you as soon as you as soon as you acknowledge that as soon as you start talking about that satan comes like like never before so just remember remember these words and

on saturday start from 10 to 2. now we start working on the building there is no water there the the bathroom are there but not ready to be used so there is a walmart there in case you need you can ask us direction but starting next week we're gonna launch do we have all the money no if you know your pastor good enough i just jump by faith and then he takes care of everything amen i told brother robert it's like the four lepers or you stay in the city you die you stay outside you die what do you do just keep walking as you're walking then god kick in amen just take that stone like david and throw it away and that's it that's all you can do and it's up to the creator to get the stone and drive it all the way through everybody clear so if the little bit we have we're gonna launch and keep moving as we're moving the holy spirit will open the door before you know it will be like my god it is done so either you join with me in faith or you watch as a spectator but we're going to be there amen amen i guarantee you amen the only thing that's going to stop it is the coming of the lord if the lord doesn't come back yet we're going to push all the way to the end everybody ready tonight we're supposed together but i got brother mcbride i don't have to introduce him i don't have to say anything about him you know him better and just open up your heart and let the lord feed you tonight amen he drove all the way coming down here and usually he worked throughout the week so if you think he's tired you are tired he's more tired than you because he's got to give his all and stay out of the uh out of the way of the holy spirit amen sometime i finish preaching here and i'm strong i can go there talk to the people as soon as i reach home it's like so you felt like okay i was under the anointing now i'm back to normal amen so he's have more work to do than you so pull on the word of the lord let's open our heart and expect the lord to speak to us tonight everybody ready you ready

receive amen [Music] things are possible amen one more verse says jesus is here amen do you believe that jesus here [Music] jesus [Music] jesus is here [Music] jesus jesus [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] amen amen let us just bow our hearts and our heads together as we just continue to get quiet before the lord in our spirits he's blessed us with a song service that was very moving and relaxing to my spirit and i believe he wants to further settle us down so that we can focus in upon him and allow him to move as he wills [Music] and just right now my precious brother mike holloway is on my heart and i just would like to enter into prayer for him and i know there are many other needs in the building and those that might be streaming i know there's needs among all of god's people so let's pray for one another saints heavenly father we're so undeserving of anything lord i have to say that first father because for anything that has been done it's been completely by your grace none of us lord can boast of anything father or feel like we worked for it or we merited it lord god we didn't deserve anything lord but just to see the richness of your love and your mercy that you constantly pour out upon our lives on a daily basis father all we can do is say thank you jesus thank you jesus and lord have mercy on us all [Music] father there are many things that are going on right now you know all about them there's nothing that we can say to you that you don't already know but you ordained and we come to you in prayer it's an expression of our faith lord that we believe that if we come according to your word father you are answered according to your promise through what you've done for us at calvary lord you made a way for us father to come back home lord we pray for those that are maybe battling within their bodies tonight for many different reasons lord we want to say thank you for keeping our brother holloway and may you continue to strengthen and bless and heal him by your grace and for all the unspoken prayer requests father that are upon your children's hearts my heart lord god we pray that you will be merciful to us father and that you will move upon each request lord forgive us of our sins and our iniquities lord jesus father we never desire to hurt you lord or to go contrary to your word it's been our whole heart's desire this whole time to continue to yield ourselves to you lord so that you can be pleased father we know it's nothing that we can do to to work for anything from you father but from our hearts because you revealed yourself to us and we see your goodness and your kindness and all that you are lord it makes us want to give our all to you help us to do that lord we want to father you see it lord please help us to do that this is your service tonight lord these are your people tonight father lord we ask that you would please come and help us all [Music] you know how to minister to your needs of all of your children you know each one of us in particular may you be able to have your way lord may you not be hindered we pray and we ask all these things in your name the name of our lord and savior jesus christ let the church say amen let's give the lord a hand clapper praises praise the lord i thank god for the invitation of being able to be here um it's a pleasure i think this is my third time here now i think three right three times i think and uh it's just it's a pleasure to be able to come among you and i'm not just saying that it's just a good atmosphere and the brother that was leading the song service he did a phenomenal joke he's built for the job [Applause] i couldn't even stand still out there to pacing back and forth hey man just at the atmosphere not necessarily good music good singing but it's just when it's coming from the right heart and the right source it carries something different something you can feel i was outside the door but it was an anointing that i could feel and that's just god working through his gifts he was ministering to me praise the lord so it's good to see everybody god bless you god bless you brother stephen your family brother kelly the other minister brothers that might be in here that i i'm not aware of right now the musicians god bless you amen i don't want to keep you standing long so let's get right into the word uh i want to go to hebrews chapter 5. hebrews chapter 5. i want to start at verse 1. it says for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins so i really want to focus in on these next few verses saints it says who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way and this is he's going to give you the reason why he's able to do that it says for that he himself also is compass with infirmity and by reason hereof he ought ask for the people so also for himself to offer for sins amen let's go to galatians chapter 6. galatians 6. i want to start at verse 1. it says brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault pay close and let's just not gloss over this saints because the lord has been really dealing with me in this for some time now if i can say it in this way the lord has been deflating me it's been very humbling and i say that with sincerity i believe it's something that means a lot to god it says brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye notice what he says now ye which are spiritual notice the thought he says restore see that's the mindset restore such a one in the spirit of meekness now notice like the like the high priest in hebrews 5 there was a way in which god wanted him to approach those sacrifices and those offerings it's a mindset it was an internal atmosphere that god needed for him to have so now it's moved from the priests to just any of the saints when you see somebody overtaken in a fault god as god is emphasizing he's taking the time to say these specific things through paul because it's something that he wants his his bride to understand it says ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness he says considering thyself amen he says lest thou also be tempted he says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing how many in here something tonight we don't even want to scratch out here right now for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing notice he deceiveth himself let's just pray once more heavenly father help us we pray god we need you in jesus christ holy and precious name we ask it amen amen god bless you saying she may be seated so tonight by the grace of god same side i want to deal with a topic of effective prayer effective prayer as i just finished saying there are certain things that mean a lot to god and one of those things saints is how you and i think toward one another and how we handle one another and not just us in the church but but when we go out to our workplaces and to the grocery stores and and out in the world it it it god watches us because there is a reflection that he's looking for and that reflection is by nature i actually thought i was going to preach on that tonight by nature but that's not the way i feel led but how god is see what and i love this and it makes it easy to follow god because whatever he's requiring of us is what he is i was a supervisor for a number of years and i would never ask the people that the lord allowed me to be over to do anything that i wouldn't do myself i rather go and do it myself so that they can actu i can give them an example he's not above that he's right down there with us he'll come down and do the lowest jobs i would go and i would sweep and i would clean and i let them go in and relax but it was for i wanted to show them something i wanted him to be able to see that he doesn't he's not he's not high like that he he actually is a humble brother he doesn't mind working hard so when he tells me to do something i can have more respect for that because i know where it's coming from it's coming from a right heart he cares about the people but see concerning us saints god he cares about like i said how we think about other people and how we handle other people as we speak about the adoption and all you know those things like that you know it's certain things that are kind of keyed in upon you know the power part and the position part and thing but but this right here is just as much a part of it it's a very key part of it because it actually is the manifestation of the character being able to conduct the father's business and he's in the business of saving souls we're still in a time of grace isn't that right isn't that right many people that we witness to they may never be able to come into this message they may not be able to be ordained to that but they have a place you understand what i'm saying and god has a uh uh um we have orders each one of us within our individual lives brother branham said that's the reason why you stay in the neighborhood you stay in that's the reason why you work at the job that you work in because god made you with a certain makeup better be able to reach people and touch people that if i came into your place at your job i wouldn't be as effective amen and i'm a witness of that praise the lord but i'm talking about effective prayer tonight so god he desires for his people to be in a certain frame of mind when it comes to helping others and even when it comes to praying for others how many times saints have myself i'm gonna use myself as an example people come up to you and they say hey brother i need you to pray with me sometimes they may tell you what it is sometimes they may not but how many times and i say this to my shame how many times have i been asked to pray for somebody and i say yes i'll do that and then go off and forget about it or or not not consider what what really just took place because if somebody thinks enough of you to come to you and say brother so listen it's a reason why they came in you were not somebody else something strikes them about you something they see within you that made them feel led to come to you because maybe they felt like look if this person prays for me i feel like they'll be more sincere but how often even in those times when somebody comes to confide in us to ask prayer with them it's not even handled right we don't handle it as our own we may pray but it's like it ain't the same kind of prayer as though it was a prayer for yourself or so or your loved one or something that you're going through there's many times a disconnect turn with me saying if you will to amen let's go to luke chapter seven if you see or you know about a brother or sister that's overcoming a fault he said ye which are spiritual that means that you have a certain walk with god you you you you have a certain amount of yielding that's been established in your life to the things of god you have a relationship with god amen you have the holy ghost now i want to touch upon that real carefully now because the holy ghost having the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't exempt us from making mistakes you can have the baptism of the holy ghost and still handle people wrong you can have the baptism of the holy ghost and it's going out you go outside and it's raining you'll get wet like everybody else right spirits can land upon anybody self-righteous spiritual spirits and cause us at times to look at people wrong to learn about somebody's mistakes or failures or faults and be more ready to talk about something and ain't praying about nothing and how do you know that god didn't let you come across that situation bring out your reaction so that he can turn around and show you where you need help at because when you're the one that fails when you're the one that falls how often and how easy it is for us to be absent-minded of how we feel when we're asking god for prayer and forgiveness that's what god wants us to be mindful of he says when you are spiritual you go but remember yourself that'll change how you go how to change the atmosphere [Music] now an atmosphere of love humility how what's bringing out about saints because you you're able to see yourself lord if it wasn't for your grace that'll be me i'll be the one that's fallen i'll be the one that's out i'll be the one that's backslidden in today for your grace and your power that goes for every one of us in here if it wasn't for the grace of god as the song says where will we be we wouldn't be here tonight some people may not have some some some of us some of us in here may not have wanted to even come come tonight there was battles that was present notice this in luke chapter 7 starting at verse 36 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meeting the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now notice this now now when the pharisee which had been him saw it he spake within himself not allowed within himself our prophet taught us that our thoughts are heard louder in heaven than what our words are on the earth god don't want us to get comfortable with lip service it's good to sing songs it's good to praise the lord it's good to speak the word but god cares more about what's in that heart he said how can you be in evil speak good things he said these people honored me with their mouth but their heart is far from me he wanted something that was of more value amen think about it isn't that what we want for the people that we're associated with we don't want somebody that's just acting the part around us but despise us in their hearts isn't that right we call that what two-faced it none of us want that around us do we amen how much more god lord brother i've been two-faced it at times with my lord and he sees everything see this is a real love relationship that he's calling us to now this ain't just some religious show or ritual or getting used to some routine or some program no god's calling for a wife ain't that somebody that loved him somebody that want to be with him somebody that desires to spend quality time with him not despising and trying to see i didn't get out of it until trouble comes not everyone act loving and kind and all that engaged whenever trouble strikes amen but him being god he see all of that he said behold an israelite in whom there is no god when did you know me before philip called you i saw you amen god wants something that's real and i say lord help me to give you something that's real that's the whole part of our journey saints that transition that transition from worldliness from darkness from being an enemy of god amen and the power of god amen through the power of that spoken word changing us from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord revealing themselves to us amen and coming with the revelation of the word in our souls how through love when we were his enemies think about it i'm talking about tonight you think let let us let us think right now how we've treated our lord in the simple things amen how faithful have we been to him but yet we want him every time to be right there for us amen lord help us to pay our bills lord give me that good job lord give me that god we want him to satisfy every desire that we have but when it comes to satisfying his desires he told israel once i've brought you out and and once i've placed you in a good land and once i've made you rich and you become fat he said don't you forget about the lord your god he knew the course of human nature praise the lord he spoke within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and jesus sitting right there and it's almost like he had a microphone just like i got right now he heard his inward thoughts loud and clear amen as soon as soon as he said his last word to his statement in his heart jesus looked at him my lord my god my example see that was his daughter but she was all covered over but that seed was in there amen only a spiritual eye i'll be able to see that seed amen how else are we going to be a benefit and a help to anybody unless we're in the spirit because in my natural sight saints because listen now we're human we came into this world in a fallen condition and even when you receive the holy ghost you still have a fallen body and a human spirit got to be dealt with and as a result of that demon spirits can latch themselves to your spirit and control your mind brother calls it a spiritual oppression make you look at somebody or one another in the wrong light amen just like simon is looking at him with a critical eye amen and the lord was displeased with that let me read something to you here he says and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he said listen what he said master say on he know full well he didn't consider christ to be his master there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50 and when he had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them loving him would love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon she asked out this woman i entered and i entered into thine house thou gave us me no water for my feet but she have not washed she has not she have had washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gaves me no kiss but but this woman since the time i came in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil about did is not annoying but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i see unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiving the same love of little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that said and meet with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive us our sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith have saved thee go in peace simon you've been here with this woman you know all about her what have you done to help her you're so easy to criticize but where's your heart at my brother starchy self-righteous blind the bible says when somebody thinks they are something when they are nothing they deceive themselves was he deceived yes indeed see so god says he wants us to be able to have compassion be in a place in our house we actually care about what somebody is going through but she didn't know we we we touching on holy ground here see because did this i'm not talking about something that's humanly produced we can't enter into this place on our own it's a place that we're brought into amen the prophet talked about it it's a place that you're actually brought into by the power of god through the baptism of the holy ghost it's a level of relationship and love everybody speaks so highly of brother brown but his life was just a reflection of his love relationship with our lord jesus christ it wasn't because he was some special somebody no sir but he he came to a place where he really loved god more than what we realize and as a result of that the presence of god do you understand those things when we humble ourselves before god and we allow him to have his way and we really be sheep that dove is able to come and connect with that lamb nature amen whenever that simon woof-like spirit comes upon us just like the prophet said the sweet holy spirit takes his flight i said but don't worry though he he he's within calling he he's he's within distance there he's just waiting for us to come back to our right frame of mind and realize lord i was wrong forgive me heavenly father for how i've acted for how i've thought about it and that sweet anointing i'll come float right back down on you see the grace of god but we deserve to be left alone how many times sayings have you and i acted up before the lord in a day in a week in a month in a year in five years we can't count it amen but look at how he handles us he could tell he he could take any one of us right now and plaster our secret sins over this wall cause the anointing of god to drop and a gift operate and blast out before everybody our own sins are but does he do it and all that we've been through does he do it look at how he handles us lord have mercy on us compassion saints according to the dictionary watch this now this is what simon lacked it means sympathetic awareness of others distress notice it says together with a desire to alleviate it he says ye which are spiritual go and restore you're not just going to see what's going on so you can take something back to gossip about amen you ain't just going to be nosy amen but you're going with the deepness of sincerity amen why because you're being mindful of yourself he said considering yourself lest you be tempted also you know what the bible says so when you talk about compassion is you see somebody in distress but you have a desire to see them restored to see them delivered so when you go you go softly the bible said in the spirit of meekness considering yourself that's the making of an effective prayer when people use you when people handle you wrong how many realize god don't let you act back the way that they acted towards you you want to know why because you're royalty you have a higher calling amen amen you not from this world like that amen you can't act like everybody else sack that low mentality and i for not know sir not in god's kingdom he said love your enemies god allow enemies to come in your life amen it's like we preached before brother to challenge you to love him i'm talking about effective prayer now listen he says pray for those that despitefully use you and persecute you think about that your name cast all about you being talked about you being ridiculed listen and all lord let it roll right into your life what is it for it's the finishing touches of perfection amen we're talking about real training here now man before i went to marine corps boot camp i heard about it but once i was in it i was in it amen it was a tough training the training of god ain't easy and he permits all these things to take place he let it roll right into your life to bring out your reaction and your response hey man why because he's molding and he's shaping he's the potter and we're the clay there's something he got in his mind that he's trying to bring out in that vessel each one of our vessels so you let people talk about you and persecute you and then when it and then when you're able and when you feel like to talk back he said uh don't you say a word there's a sheet before shears as dumb he opened not his mouth god has been having me to hold my breath you feel like you about to explode on me you want to clear your name you want to be able to justify yourself he says no he says now pray for them not some little flimsy week lord i pray for my enemies lord you know lord bless them no sir there's a place there's a place saints that we got to enter into watch this now watch it i'm gonna touch on a few things here saints and i'm gonna let you go cause i know it's a wednesday night and i just wanna share this with you here notice this now brother branham his daughter sharon when she was dying and the lord brought this to my attention because i realized saints the lord allows us to go through things at times for other people he takes you through it because somewhere down the line there's gonna be somebody that he's gonna cause across your path that's going to have a need of what you gained in the midst of that trial or that trouble or that situation he's equipping you with something to give to somebody else when brother branham sharon his daughter sharon rose was dying he talked about how she was suffering flies flying in her eyes she trying to wave at him and she's sitting there dying he said she was in so much pain to her little eyes crossed no parent ever want to go through that but as a result of that there wasn't a person that hardly was able to come across that stage that had crossed eyes that didn't leave healed why because it wasn't just somebody that needed prayer he was able to enter into their suffering because it triggered his memory of his daughter amen and as he saw that child of that grown up standing there with that crossed eyes amen there was something that was able to come forth from that brother under the anointing of the holy ghost and prayed upon faith watch this now he says in his message called god projecting his love he says and i thought after all that talking about the old mexican brother after all that and then nature the devil has given him evil to blind his poor old blinded eyes how cruel it was to him and i began to enter into something notice how he said that i began he wasn't able to bring himself into it it's just where he was he was yielded to god he loved god and he was just there to do the service of god in the will of god god was just able to have his way so now he was able to he began to feel the very feeling of god do you understand that when we're yielded to god like we're supposed to be united saints by his grace it brings us into the very feeling of god that's why stephen when he was being stoned he was being killed and the same one that was on the cross that said forgive them was that same one speaking through philip on stephen's lips he was able to enter into that same place by the same person that wasn't a religious act that was a life by nature you understand so brother branham is saying here i begin he says to enter into something he says i can't express it it was a love of sympathy he says and as the old fellow come and laid his head over on my shoulder and i hugged that old ragged coat i said merciful god please help this poor old blind daddy if my dad would have lived he'd have been about that age see how god was helping his mind his consideration his sincerity for this man he was going into a certain place that the holy ghost was directing it why because god was going to use him to pray an effect of prayer for this brother amen he says and i heard him hold listen now he's sitting there with these thoughts my daddy would have been about that age considering his condition and because he was yielded and he loved god god came right down and rested and settled upon that that little vessel and he began to think the thoughts of god and as he's sitting there and he's whispering this simple prayer amen the miraculous beginning to happen he says and i heard him hollering gloria adios and the man could see as good as i could the people began screaming everywhere he says what was it it was entering into that fellowship of his suffering in his blindness so when somebody bring prayer to you to me be able to go home even if you got to write it down and not just get down and just begin to say a prayer but sometimes just sit just sit and be quiet for a little while coming in from outside coming in from work just go in a room and close it up just sit quiet for a little maybe read the bible or something hey man why you're wanting to create an atmosphere you want your spirit to get uncluttered why because you really want to be able to pray for your brother your sister not forget about him not a little weak prayer the holy ghost is watching because the bible says it's his desire that we will pray always especially for one another amen watch this now he said if ever i had a time of success of praying for anyone is when i could enter into the fellowship with them feel their infirmities feel their conditions that's where the high priest success comes from that's where the saints that finds one overcoming a fault that's where their success of prayer comes from the holy ghost will put you in it listen when all the men came and women bringing that woman that was caught in an act of adultery she was caught right but listen even though she was the one called look who god directed his tear his attention toward the ones that brought her the critical ones the persecuting ones yes she did wrong but i want to tell you about yourself he said simon i have somewhat against you [Music] they thinking they doing god of service listen how easily that happens in the wrong spirit you thinking that you on god's side working for god and god ain't behind you not one tap you don't realize what spirit you're off my prophet went to that cafe he was anointed by devil he was looking through the sight of an evil spirit with the holy ghost powerful services and in that moment a demon took control of our prophet and made him made him want to see the people that were in there destroyed isn't that something with the holy ghost can get so caught up in religious thoughts god he said why don't you just wipe the whole thing off so that my kids ain't got to grow up with people like that you can't tell me that don't happen among the saints but guess what our father ain't having it he checks his family he checks his children why that ain't called raising you up i ain't how i want you to live can we say praise the lord saints amen if ever i had a time of success or praying for anyone is when i could enter into the fellowship with them with them feeling their infirmities feel their condition amen then something in you goes down beyond reasonings and prayers the prayer of faith for the sick you've got to feel for a man you've got to sympathize with him you've got to be with him before you can help him then you enter into some sort of a deepness it's the love of god it's beyond human love this is something saints to him this is something that the lord is emphasizing to my heart i'm preaching to you my conviction the lord is helping me in my words to communicate what he's been teaching me i want you to understand that and the only reason why i'm sharing it with you tonight is because i i want to if it can be of a help to somebody that's my desire because i see this is something that every member of the bride of christ must have you must have it we have the ministry of reconciliation isn't that right but how are you going to be effective in that ministry in that in that role amen we got to amen we got to come in the right way not just one time but spend spin spin spend the quality with the quality time with god that we need to so that we can just enter into this place that's it it's as simple as that the little things that we take for granted many times are so powerful but the devil want us to overlook it simply taking the time to pray spending time spending real time in the world i've been so busy lately ain't made no sense but what i began to realize you know what let me i got to stop and reevaluate some things because maybe i don't need to be as busy as i think i need to be maybe maybe some of this is actually the enemy trying to keep me from something i want to be able to pray an effective prayer for my brothers and my sisters no matter who it is somebody in the world lord have mercy on me because he's watching and he cares about every every one of these little things pray for me saints pray for me pray for my family and by the grace of god i know we're human we can't always remember everything like that but if we're in that place with god help me to know that god will bring somebody to your heart we're human we forget but but if it's somebody that god really wants you to pray for be mindful i mean he'll bring them to your mind coupled together with the desire to praise and i pray for this person you mean i know what to pray but he knows say lord whatever it is that my brother sister stands in need of i pray that you bless him with it father god bless i got much more his saints but i feel led to stop i feel led to stop but now as we all stand together let's just bow our hairs in our hearts please if there's anybody that desires prayer you're more than welcome to come up at this time but i've been saying this because i just wanted to make sure it's understood that the same faith that you could have at your seat you have to have it up here as well but if you feel led to come you're more than welcome to come and we'll pray with you by the grace of god heavenly father as your word says lord we are unprofitable servants lord we're just here to do your will father we ask lord that you would help us father in this area of our lives i know you've already dealt with each one of us lord in our prayer lives father but oh that's just this peace right here lord that you emphasized to me that i just wanted to share that it might be of a help to one of your children forgive me lord for the many times that i've failed you that i feel lord god to really have the right heart and mind toward anyone forgive me lord and have mercy upon me lord help me lord to do better i want to do better lord and i pray for all of us father god help each one of us to do better lord to have to just come into that place that only you can bring us into lord to be able to see a people right father so that we can be used by you more so lord not for our glory because we have none to get but for your glory and the uplifting of your kingdom for your precious people that press their way out tonight father i pray that you would grant each one traveling mercy's home lord and even as we go home father god continue to minister to our hearts we don't have to ask this lord but we're asking please continue to minister to us lord leading and guiding us lord god into your perfect will that's all that matters right now as this as this world is coming to a close the world as we know it father as we knew it father these things are the most important things our relationship with you lord that's it and how much we can die so that you can live thank you for your grace for your mercy for your longsuffering thank you for how you've handled us lord father how many times we could have been embarrassed lord guarded and had the news of our lives just cast all around but all these years lord god you've handled us in such a way father or help us to have a heart to handle other people in that very same way you have set an example before us lord help us to follow what we pray we thank you for this church lord may you bless every saint the pastor keep them by your grace lord in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we ask these things amen praise the lord and let's bless by our saints [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] us [Music] is [Music] business [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is our fathers [Music] now church don't miss your opportunity this evening if you have something on your heart we can call the brother back up or you can meet him in the back and don't and as our prophet said god can meet you in your seat god can meet you where you're at but if you have a desire to be prayed for this evening don't don't hold out god can meet you here don't be afraid to step out don't be afraid to to allow the brother to pray for you for whatever it is in your life we know his spirit's here we know he's moving don't go home empty be filled be healed be delivered whatever desire of your heart is god can meet it here in this place don't miss your opportunity [Music] [Music] is think about is [Music] that's brought us [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] out of your name [Music] one more time you just raise your hands and worship him this evening hallelujah if you have a knee just lift your hands [Music] never [Music] amen amen how many enjoy the service tonight amen blessed be the name of the lord but david give me a little bit i just want to save my voice amen you know brother branham preached a message before he preached the seals everybody was under anticipation for the seals and do you know the message he preached before god hide and reveal himself in simplicity this message is not complicated it is very simple and those very simple things have a powerful force that can even move a mountain amen the disciple thought that if jesus increased their faith then they're going to move the mountain jesus said if faith is just like a little master seed just the way it is it can move that big mountain amen it is very important when things happen in our life instead of getting angry instead of getting upset try to discern the message behind what you see usually most of the time god is talking in a different language than you are used to amen amen kids you might have a noisy neighbor always troubling you do something and they say your kids are making noise your kids are making noise your kids are making noise you can get upset to the neighbor and miss the message of god amen maybe it's just time for you to move amen maybe it's just a time for you to move so god will make that place uncomfortable amen until you understand that you know what i need to go ahead and pray so that the lord can give me a house you pray and it doesn't take long and you get a house it took the pressure amen to put you into a certain place if you discern it right you can pray for that neighbor show him love and also reap your blessing and keep moving forward amen but most of the time when something happens we get upset and we don't understand that we miss god when you grow pressure comes amen things begin to happen tension get into the church that tension is not don't give too much credit to the devil god is saying something amen god is just telling you something maybe it's time for you to move to a next step so they gotta shake things away from you and if you don't discern that right you're going to be caught up and the blessing of the lord just passed you by and you got to go back to the school again and be retrained because you didn't pass the test amen so just remember self-righteousness is something that is very very bad amen you cannot have that one and handle the sheep of god that's the reason why i say i made a statement i say if you see somebody in this church that got trouble if you don't know how to handle it just leave them alone come and talk to me amen because you handle them right you can get a warping from god even though they're wrong amen go read the scripture you will see many times god bring babylon to take israel out of the land and the same god turn again and whoop babylon amen i can give you scripture after scripture but self-righteousness very very very bad thing learn to see yourself a little amen acknowledge your weakness it's gonna help you in marriage amen if you don't remember things right just acknowledge i have a tendency to forget things let discern the gift in your wife that god placed there to help you compensate on that weakness you do it you begin to prosper but we've been blocking our husband belittling our lives crushing our kids and don't even discern what is going on and you're gonna go in a circle in a circle in a circle because you know everything because you know all because you don't understand that god put a team there god put a song leader god put a trusty god put a deacon god put somebody there to sing all these people are there many times people come and ask me brother stephen what should i do i say you do as you feel led by the holy ghost because i believe the holy ghost is in a song leader let him direct you i'm not going to be the one giving you program you do this this this no you go ahead and do it and once you turn them loose you're going to see how the lord operates and you say my god i wish i would have learned this a long time check your family look at the tension look at the tension of the kids sometimes it's just a message but that message is not to crush you amen we have been disclosing the black dog the more we disclose it many of us are turning around you don't receive those phone calls i do receive them people begin to see themselves like this is me this is what i was doing this is me this is me in the past it's not to crush you amen there is it's a time of deliverance they just want to take you from where you were and pull you up to a certain situation if you miss it you're going to go back again and they're going to have to retrain you over amen learn to enter into that prayer time with humility remembering yourself belittling the best way you approach god just tell him you are my all sufficient amen without you i can do nothing i depend a hundred percent from you father there is nothing that i can do when you begin to lower like that sometimes you think you need two hour prayer just 15 minutes you hit it right there and that's it and you feel his presence coming up or you can spend two hours trying to show him how you righteous you say this you say this you say this and it's in here you are just beating the air beating the air just humble yourself and you're gonna see who is there and that answer come clearly people have been struggling praying in jesus name in jesus name and somebody else come and say in jesus name and something happened why did he say quietly and something happened why did you struggle something didn't happen these many keys in this message the lord have unfolded one area in our life for prayer you must see something somebody in this church doing something that is wrong when you want to approach it if you want to talk to remember remember unless you fall yourself into that same situation and you don't know how somebody is going to handle you amen let's give one another grace let's discern the body let's understand the message behind it amen maybe it's a time of deliverance when it was time for deliverance in egypt guess what the trouble increased the trouble increased israel began to cry more to prescribe more more suffering more suffering more suffering didn't mean god want to kill them more suffering means that it was time for deliverance period you understand that you go slowly without any problem you don't understand you're going to fight your way there they're going to pull you like israel you're going to fight in the wilderness and you're gonna lose your own life and stay in the wilderness without even reaching the goal that god gave you amen so keep on meditating keep on praying and remember this kid tonight enter the prayer remembering your littleness how insignificant you are in the presence of the lord humble yourself crush yourself show him that i'm nothing without him i don't know anything amen then when he opened his way and begin to show you things you will be walking up singing at home and say my god where was i all this time just because of humility heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love and for your mercy lord for your children father you could have left us continuing into a certain path lord anointed by a religious spirit thinking that what we were doing were right lord father but just like paul you met him on the road of damascus father you turned him around and he began to fight for the very faith that he was trying to destroy lord father lord you spoke to us tonight and gave us a great key about entering into your presence maybe many people were struggling to get into your presence maybe many of us lord the devil have been buffeting our mind telling us that we're so busy we don't have that time lord father but tonight your grace swoop over again father over the congregation over your children lord pointing unto us lord the different area that we need to improve in our life for our own blessings father may you bless your children tonight and may you remember by the black blood lord laboring and he have to get on the road and travel all the way back lord father his family at home waiting for him lord father may you give him travel mercy as lord also this congregation father may you continue to keep us closer and closer deeper and deeper in a relationship with you lord so that one of this day we can meet you into the air we thank you for everything and for this wonderful service and committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we see you lord dwelling on son [Music] is he is here
