[52:36] the hair
[52:37] and found the headship of a man a
[52:39] husband the messenger and everything
[52:41] so i wanted to enter jezebel looking at
[52:44] the window to see what is the window
[52:47] in the scripture and i want to push
[52:50] there and i could not
[52:52] your boss keep pulling me back
[52:53] [Laughter]
[52:55] he says there is something about the
[52:57] headship that you need to handle
[52:59] i say no it is it even started with
[53:02] brother kelly we were talking with
[53:04] brother kelly and he said something
[53:06] maybe he didn't mention and he opened up
[53:07] like
[53:09] i said wait a minute i spoke about this
[53:11] i missed this
[53:12] and i want to go around then he open up
[53:14] again i want to keep going
[53:16] up even till this morning it keeps
[53:17] opening opening
[53:19] and yesterday i went to a funeral of
[53:22] one of my sister-in-law she lost her uh
[53:25] younger sister
[53:26] and i was sitting there and the preacher
[53:28] that was talking there
[53:30] mentioned something that confirmed again
[53:31] that and i was
[53:33] okay i understand now i need to switch
[53:36] gear
[53:37] and go back again to the head ship and
[53:39] touch what he wanted me to
[53:40] touch on it and i was driving this
[53:42] morning with my wife
[53:44] and she began to say something and touch
[53:46] exactly through that sermon
[53:48] she didn't know i kept quiet
[53:51] suddenly and i began to pray but now
[53:53] she's going to see why she said that i
[53:55] didn't tell her
[53:56] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[54:00] let's go to a scripture genesis chapter
[54:03] 18.

[54:46] if you take every single quote you put
[54:48] it with everything we loaded on

[54:58] for man to work
[55:00] and take care of his wife we we started

[56:22] cry
[56:23] that the people of sodom and gomorrah
[56:25] and the cities around were wicked
[56:27] so god came down to destroy everything
[56:30] so everything was already doomed
[56:32] everybody clear and the man
[56:35] turned their faces from there and went
[56:38] to sodom
[56:39] but abraham stood yet before the lord
[56:44] that's the head of the house and sarah

[58:13] disclose the whole plan to abraham
[58:15] when abraham saw the plan being
[58:17] disclosed abraham looked he said oh my
[58:20] god
[58:20] so every city around sodom
[58:24] including sodom and gomorrah are going
[58:27] to be destroyed
[58:29] so in the economy of god there was no
[58:32] mercy
[58:33] for sodom
[58:36] there was no mercy for gomorrah

[59:31] was vexed with the city of sodom
[59:36] so the entire city had only
[59:39] one person because the angel
[59:42] pulled his family but still they were
[59:45] not under the economy
[59:50] hallelujah i told you to stay awake
[59:52] right

[1:00:36] of lord came to god
[1:00:39] and begin to reopen the door of mercy
[1:00:46] do you follow me god closed the door
[1:00:51] he said everything is doomed
[1:00:54] abraham came as a responsible
[1:00:58] and begin to reopen the door
[1:01:01] if they can squeeze lot out
[1:01:14] hallelujah the sister gathered
[1:01:18] perhaps there be 50 righteous
[1:01:22] inside the city god block
[1:01:25] everything abraham reopened
[1:01:29] 50 50 chairs
[1:01:34] who are you abraham to open
[1:01:37] mercy when god have closed
[1:01:41] and he opened a door for 50 people
[1:01:50] this is raw meat
[1:01:53] perhaps there be 50 righteous inside the
[1:01:57] city
[1:01:58] will you also destroy and not spare the
[1:02:01] place for 50 riches
[1:02:03] that that are there in that be
[1:02:06] far from you to do after this manner to
[1:02:09] slay the righteous with the wicked
[1:02:12] abraham is pleading with god
[1:02:16] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:02:18] weakened
[1:02:19] that be far from you you shall not judge
[1:02:23] you you you shall not get
[1:02:27] from you shall not the judge of all the
[1:02:30] earth do right
[1:02:33] god is talking to abraham abraham is
[1:02:36] talking to god he say
[1:02:38] now listen you the judge of the heaven
[1:02:41] and earth
[1:02:42] and you are not just a judge but you are
[1:02:45] a righteous judge
[1:02:47] and a righteous judge must do things
[1:02:49] that are right right
[1:02:51] and god said yes
[1:02:54] he said but now if you are just how can
[1:02:57] you let the wicked
[1:03:00] perish with the righteousness
[1:03:03] so can you spare 50
[1:03:08] it looks like abraham is more righteous
[1:03:11] than god
[1:03:14] amen verse 26 and the lord say
[1:03:19] if i found in sodom how many
[1:03:24] in other words i agree abraham
[1:03:28] i already closed the door now you push
[1:03:31] too hard
[1:03:32] i have to reopen for 50.
[1:03:36] what power has abraham to
[1:03:39] open the doors of mercy when gloves
[1:03:42] already closed
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:48] stay under malachi 4.
[1:03:52] hallelujah and the lord say if i found
[1:03:57] in sodom
[1:03:58] 50 because that's where slot was
[1:04:01] righteous inside the city then i will
[1:04:04] spare
[1:04:04] all the place for the water not only am
[1:04:08] i going to spare
[1:04:09] 50 but abraham your heart
[1:04:13] pushed so hard that i can even spare
[1:04:16] the city that i have already condemned
[1:04:21] what power have abraham
[1:04:24] what power hallelujah
[1:04:28] verse 27 and abraham answer and say
[1:04:31] behold now i have taken upon me to speak
[1:04:35] to the lord
[1:04:36] which i am but dustin ashes he goes back
[1:04:38] to humility you know i'm nothing
[1:04:40] i'm nothing i'm nothing you know that
[1:04:42] right you're the big man
[1:04:44] you're the boss you're the mighty
[1:04:45] conqueror you're the way you make it
[1:04:48] you're the miracle workers
[1:04:54] he knows how to play with his god
[1:04:58] and god begin to say abraham abraham
[1:05:01] again abraham
[1:05:04] amen because god inhabits the presence
[1:05:08] of his people
[1:05:12] [Applause]

[1:05:17] and it's going to open a different door
[1:05:20] hallelujah
[1:05:22] blessed be the name of the lord perhaps
[1:05:25] there verse 28 shall like how many
[1:05:30] abraham knew that with everything i
[1:05:34] found there
[1:05:35] um not 50. so he opened 50.
[1:05:38] he's going to count he won't find 50
[1:05:40] he's going to destroy let me nail him
[1:05:42] down a little bit
[1:05:44] so before i nail him down let me give
[1:05:46] him some food
[1:05:48] because before jacob gets blessed
[1:05:52] he must prepare food for isaac when
[1:05:55] isaac eat and he's happy
[1:05:57] then he stop blessing
[1:06:03] hallelujah he said abraham answer and
[1:06:07] say behold now
[1:06:08] i have taken upon the lord upon me to
[1:06:11] speak to the lord 27
[1:06:12] which i am but dustin ashes perhaps they
[1:06:15] shall lack how many what
[1:06:19] what divided by what
[1:06:22] ten percent five
[1:06:30] five
[1:06:32] hallelujah five or 50
[1:06:36] of the 50 righteous will you destroy all
[1:06:39] the city for lack of five
[1:06:42] and he said if i find there
[1:06:46] 45 i will not do water
[1:06:50] in other words he removed five from 50
[1:06:54] the remaining was water god said
[1:06:57] okay check
[1:07:01] abraham who are you you are manipulating
[1:07:06] god verse 29 and he spoke to him yet
[1:07:11] again
[1:07:12] and said perhaps they shall be
[1:07:15] fully found
[1:07:19] now he takes how many five again
[1:07:23] 40. he's getting he's working with what
[1:07:33] he pushed the first grace and sodom
[1:07:37] could not stand there he pushed the
[1:07:40] second grace and sodom
[1:07:42] still can't get there
[1:07:47] these are bullets that are loaded
[1:07:51] abraham knew those bullets and when he
[1:07:54] needed it he began to load them
[1:07:59] hallelujah and he said i will not do it
[1:08:03] for 46
[1:08:04] and he said to him oh let not the lord
[1:08:09] be angry because he know he's pushing
[1:08:11] hard
[1:08:13] let not the lord be angry and i will

[1:32:45] but why does my lord
[1:32:49] the king delight in this thing god
[1:32:52] brought so many people in israel god
[1:32:55] increase your church why do you want to
[1:32:58] do something that is bad david
[1:33:01] verse 4 notwithstanding nevertheless
[1:33:04] the king's word prevail against job now
[1:33:07] that i say that you go gonna do it
[1:33:09] and against the captain of the host and
[1:33:12] job and the captain of the host went out
[1:33:14] from the presence of the king
[1:33:15] to number the people of water jump to
[1:33:18] verse 10.

[1:33:25] after that he had numbered the what this
[1:33:28] is what happened when they tell you not
[1:33:31] to do something

[1:33:35] don't listen
[1:33:36] stop your relationship with that girl
[1:33:38] you don't listen
[1:33:39] after you committed fornication then
[1:33:42] something condemned you
[1:33:44] you didn't listen at the first place
[1:33:47] condemnation comes
[1:33:49] and david's heart smote him after not
[1:33:52] before
[1:33:53] he had numbered the people he already
[1:33:55] seen and david said to the lord
[1:33:58] i have sinned greatly and in that i have
[1:34:01] done
[1:34:01] and now i beseech you oh lord take away
[1:34:04] the iniquity of your servant iniquity
[1:34:06] because he knew better
[1:34:08] for i have done very foolishly
[1:34:11] and when for when david was up in the
[1:34:14] morning
[1:34:14] the word of the lord came to the prophet
[1:34:17] god
[1:34:18] david seal the prophet of the hour

[1:35:03] other words i'm coming with a whooping
[1:35:05] you only have three options was an
[1:35:08] option there to forgive david

[1:35:49] why did he include israel
[1:35:53] why let us fall
[1:35:57] now into the hand of the water
[1:36:00] he didn't touch any of the option
[1:36:07] did you see that he didn't touch any of
[1:36:10] the options
[1:36:11] because mercy was over then david
[1:36:15] pushed a different door he opened
[1:36:19] his emergency kit
[1:36:23] did you follow me did you follow me
[1:36:26] then he looked an emergency kit he found
[1:36:29] a bullet
[1:36:31] that bullet abraham used it five times
[1:36:36] the bullet not to use it
[1:36:39] the bullet moses use it
[1:36:42] and david pulled that emergency bullet
[1:36:45] and loaded
[1:36:46] say take me put me into his hand
[1:36:50] let me see how he's going to kill me

[1:37:40] prophet this one was a major
[1:37:43] prophet and he was the king
[1:37:46] which means he was the head of israel
[1:37:50] that's why he said put us

[1:38:44] of the people from them
[1:38:46] even to boshiba 70 000 men

[1:38:53] out his hand
[1:38:55] upon water where was david's living
[1:39:01] when the angel of the lord changed
[1:39:03] direction to approach where david is

[1:39:55] angel that destroyed the people it is
[1:39:58] water
[1:40:01] god himself choose the plug
[1:40:04] david didn't choose god choose the

[1:40:55] me david i have done wickedly by this
[1:40:58] what

[1:41:45] to david said to him go up here
[1:41:49] an altar to the lord in the trenching
[1:41:52] full of water
[1:41:54] there is a mystery to that place
[1:41:58] it's going to open the place for the
[1:42:00] temple
[1:42:02] why did he reveal that and he was not
[1:42:05] angry on david
[1:42:07] verse 25 and david built there
[1:42:10] an altar to the lord an burnt offering
[1:42:14] and peace offering so the lord wasn't
[1:42:17] treated for the land

[1:43:23] and bless your people may the devil be
[1:43:26] completely sealed out
[1:43:28] may you touch those that are sick touch
[1:43:30] sister d
[1:43:32] father lose her from the power of the
[1:43:34] devil
[1:43:35] touch those that are sleepy this morning
[1:43:37] lord how do we
[1:43:38] i i will build this demonic spirit away
[1:43:42] from this place
[1:43:43] everyone that is sick touch and heal him
[1:43:45] lord
[1:43:46] and father bless your children in the
[1:43:49] name of jesus christ
[1:43:51] amen god bless you you ready
[1:43:55] let's go we on par 2035
[1:43:59] on wednesday we were dealing with the
[1:44:01] head
[1:44:02] we found out that as the head the head
[1:44:06] is a position that was given by god
[1:44:09] and that position was given as a
[1:44:12] position of power
[1:44:15] a position of authority but
[1:44:18] not a power to abuse
[1:44:22] but that power goes with responsibility
[1:44:26] how many listen to the sermon on
[1:44:27] wednesday blessed be the name of the
[1:44:29] lord
[1:44:30] and we found out that that
[1:44:32] responsibility
[1:44:33] was given to the head and the head was
[1:44:36] the man
[1:44:37] as a man as a responsible you must
[1:44:41] take care of the food of your house
[1:44:45] you must take care of the clothing of
[1:44:48] your wife
[1:44:49] you must take care of the shelter of
[1:44:52] your wife
[1:44:53] you must take care of the marital duty
[1:44:57] that paul said do benevolence to your
[1:44:59] wife
[1:45:00] in other words you must take care of her
[1:45:02] passion
[1:45:04] you must also take care of the work
[1:45:08] because in eden the responsibility to
[1:45:11] work was given to men
[1:45:13] not to the woman the woman the
[1:45:16] responsibility
[1:45:17] was given for motherhood to take care of
[1:45:21] the
[1:45:22] children and to build her own home
[1:45:24] everybody clear so far
[1:45:26] now with this headship
[1:45:29] there is something that was hidden there
[1:45:33] i believe you already called it you
[1:45:35] ready now
[1:45:37] let's go in john chapter 6
[1:45:40] 37 the bible says
[1:45:44] all that the father giveth me
[1:45:48] shall do work so by this statement
[1:45:54] if the father has already predestined
[1:45:58] you there is no way you're going to miss
[1:46:01] heaven
[1:46:03] you follow me all that the father has
[1:46:07] given me
[1:46:08] shall come and him that comes to me
[1:46:12] i will in no wise cast out
[1:46:16] he's going to come because the father
[1:46:18] already gave it to him
[1:46:20] anybody clear so far verse 13
[1:46:23] for i came down from heaven
[1:46:26] not to do my own will but
[1:46:29] the will of him that sent him what is
[1:46:32] the will of him that sent
[1:46:34] jesus what is the will of the father
[1:46:37] and this is the father's will which has
[1:46:41] sent me
[1:46:42] that of all brother branham say all
[1:46:46] means the children of god
[1:46:48] oh which he has given me
[1:46:52] i should lose water
[1:46:55] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:46:58] day
[1:46:59] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:47:03] that everyone which sees the son
[1:47:07] and belief on him may have everlasting
[1:47:10] life
[1:47:11] and i will raise him and i will raise
[1:47:13] him up at the last workout
[1:47:15] in other words when we come in this
[1:47:18] world
[1:47:18] there is a certain number of people
[1:47:22] that god gave to the lord and
[1:47:25] no matter what's going to happen
[1:47:30] do you follow me god will never
[1:47:33] lose one of them
[1:47:37] everybody understand me
[1:47:41] second timothy chapter 2 verse 19.
[1:47:44] nevertheless the foundation of god
[1:47:48] the pillar standard sure why is he sure
[1:47:53] having this seal
[1:47:56] the lord knows them that are water
[1:47:59] so every child of god
[1:48:03] no matter where you are no matter where
[1:48:06] you were born
[1:48:07] no matter which nation you are god knows
[1:48:10] exactly where you are
[1:48:13] and if you're a child of god god will
[1:48:16] never lose you
[1:48:20] do you follow me but
[1:48:24] the children of god sometimes
[1:48:28] get in the place where
[1:48:31] they are almost lost
[1:48:38] you follow me the children of
[1:48:41] god found themselves sometime
[1:48:45] in situations where there is
[1:48:48] no way out
[1:48:52] the children of god find themselves
[1:48:56] sometimes when they are cornered
[1:48:59] with pharaoh behind
[1:49:03] the red sea before the wilderness over
[1:49:07] there
[1:49:08] and it looks like our hope
[1:49:11] is finished
[1:49:17] way maker
[1:49:21] hallelujah
[1:49:25] hallelujah brother brother i'm on the
[1:49:27] incoming storm he say
[1:49:30] i say no the
[1:49:33] thing surprises me is right
[1:49:39] the thing surprises me means water
[1:49:45] why brother branham the grace of god
[1:49:47] surprises you
[1:49:50] why hallelujah
[1:49:53] i have said i have exhausted his mercy
[1:49:58] many times
[1:50:02] but i never can exhaust
[1:50:05] his water
[1:50:08] and i am so glad of that
[1:50:14] mother's day message the children of god
[1:50:19] sometimes found themselves in situations
[1:50:24] that we made mistake we made
[1:50:28] final mistake we made bad
[1:50:31] judgment the devil corner you
[1:50:35] all the way into a place like there is
[1:50:38] no
[1:50:38] way out in the places
[1:50:42] where all mercy is gone
[1:50:46] when mercy is gone
[1:50:49] there is always
[1:50:55] a special grace
[1:50:58] that god opened if
[1:51:02] you are his child
[1:51:10] is everybody awake check whoever is
[1:51:14] sleeping outside
[1:51:16] are you there are you there
[1:51:19] when we talk about the nazarite vow
[1:51:23] we found out that there are many heads
[1:51:26] the messenger is the head to the agent
[1:51:30] the pastor is ahead to the church
[1:51:34] the husband is the head to the wife
[1:51:37] the father is ahead to his home
[1:51:40] and the younger sister and the legal
[1:51:43] guardian
[1:51:44] is ahead to the one that lost his father
[1:51:48] and for the divorce and the widow the
[1:51:51] head is crushed
[1:51:54] everybody follow me now the bible says
[1:51:57] in number 30 brother kelly
[1:52:00] he talked to me this he didn't know what
[1:52:02] he opened
[1:52:03] if a woman also vowed vow unto the lord
[1:52:08] and bound herself by a bomb being
[1:52:11] in her water
[1:52:14] who's the head
[1:52:19] father hallelujah
[1:52:23] but in her father's house in her youth
[1:52:28] but if her father disallow her
[1:52:32] in other words her father canceled
[1:52:36] the vow in the day
[1:52:39] that he hears not
[1:52:42] any of her vow all of her bones
[1:52:46] where if she has burned her soul
[1:52:49] justin when a woman vowed for
[1:52:53] to the lord she automatically bound
[1:52:56] herself
[1:52:58] she can't get loose do you follow me
[1:53:02] and sometimes under pressure
[1:53:07] under nervousness under
[1:53:11] too much distress under
[1:53:14] too much problem under
[1:53:17] too much condition and situation that
[1:53:20] happen
[1:53:21] in our life we say things that are not
[1:53:24] correct
[1:53:26] we opt for certain we decide on certain
[1:53:30] things
[1:53:31] that get us bound we make the wrong
[1:53:35] decision
[1:53:37] and that decision costs us
[1:53:43] hallelujah not any of her vow
[1:53:47] or her bonds that vow
[1:53:50] it's binding it's a bond wherewith she
[1:53:53] shall burn her soul
[1:53:54] shall stand and the lord shall want him
[1:53:59] because her father did want him
[1:54:02] so even though a young system
[1:54:08] can find herself connor
[1:54:13] and there is no way out you follow me
[1:54:18] the head of the house have a special
[1:54:22] bullet in his emergency case
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:31] do you follow me please give me
[1:54:35] time let me unload this because the lord
[1:54:39] keep bringing this back over and over
[1:54:41] do you follow me when a young sister
[1:54:44] find herself
[1:54:45] bound she made a bad
[1:54:49] decision and the lord is supposed to
[1:54:53] come and deal with her
[1:54:55] the head of the house
[1:54:59] have the right to open the emergency
[1:55:02] case
[1:55:04] do you follow me that emergency case has
[1:55:07] a bullet
[1:55:10] amen that can break the vow
[1:55:14] and if the head break the vow god comes
[1:55:18] and say
[1:55:18] i accept it
[1:55:27] verse six and if she had a dollar what
[1:55:32] the head husband
[1:55:37] anybody there when she
[1:55:40] vowed or she added out of her lips
[1:55:44] where if she did what she burned her
[1:55:47] soul
[1:55:48] but if her husband disallow
[1:55:52] her on the day that he heard it
[1:55:56] then he shall make her vow which she
[1:55:59] vowed
[1:56:00] and that which she added with her lips
[1:56:03] wherewith she burned her soul
[1:56:05] of water
[1:56:09] and the lord shall do what
[1:56:16] the forgiveness that pardon
[1:56:21] lays with the head
[1:56:28] it is a power that every head have
[1:56:32] before god
[1:56:37] when the woman in tennessee lost her
[1:56:41] husband
[1:56:45] her head became crushed
[1:56:51] and when her son begin to die
[1:56:56] she went back to god and she said i

[2:06:03] it ever was intended for it to be if i
[2:06:06] will not receive it

[2:10:01] adam knew the truth
[2:10:05] but adam took his own righteousness

[2:11:27] the protection of abel was protecting
[2:11:32] cain

[2:12:49] sarah said ah i didn't lie in the
[2:12:53] face of god
[2:12:56] when the anger of the lord kingdom
[2:13:01] abraham came up
[2:13:05] hallelujah the first one is done we're
[2:13:09] on the second one
[2:13:11] circumcision could only be in the mail
[2:13:15] but if the woman was married to a male
[2:13:18] she was part of him she was circumcised
[2:13:22] with him the male circumcised the woman
[2:13:26] that's why you need to stay virgin
[2:13:30] you remember in timothy where he said
[2:13:34] in their notwithstanding she shall be
[2:13:37] saved in childbearing
[2:13:38] if she continue in faith and holiness
[2:13:42] with all sobriety we already talked
[2:13:44] about it now
[2:13:46] circumcision you know sarah laughed
[2:13:50] in the tent behind her and the message
[2:13:54] or at the message of the angel when he
[2:13:57] said abraham
[2:13:58] not knowing who he was a stranger where
[2:14:01] is the wife sarah
[2:14:02] how did he know that he had a wife
[2:14:06] in birth fame he said why did sarah live
[2:14:10] concerning this baby and sarah come
[2:14:13] forth
[2:14:14] and say she did it and say but you did
[2:14:18] and he would have killed her right there
[2:14:21] if she was not a part of what
[2:14:28] so what so would god slay us
[2:14:32] if we was not part of what
[2:14:36] the mercy of christ
[2:14:39] holds us together as
[2:14:42] daughters and perversion in the water
[2:14:46] it was abraham grace despair sarah
[2:14:51] that's why sarah said my lord
[2:14:59] do you follow me when israel israel
[2:15:03] was about to be killed by god
[2:15:07] you follow me we read in a scripture
[2:15:10] that god
[2:15:11] came out and said moses move out
[2:15:15] let me destroy these people moses look
[2:15:19] he said what israel did they are doomed
[2:15:22] where is my emergency kit
[2:15:25] joshua bring the emergency kit joshua
[2:15:28] run he said this is it
[2:15:30] he opened up he pulled the bullet he put
[2:15:32] it in
[2:15:33] he said go ahead and kill me
[2:15:37] before you destroy israel kill me
[2:15:40] if you want go in your book
[2:15:43] and erase my name because moses name
[2:15:48] was in the lamp's book of life and that
[2:15:51] name cannot be
[2:15:52] raised he uses the headship with grace
[2:15:57] to protect the people of israel
[2:16:02] do you follow me when israel
[2:16:06] begin to struggle god came and gave
[2:16:09] israel the law
[2:16:11] and what the law did the law put the
[2:16:14] people of israel in prison
[2:16:16] because paul says that sin
[2:16:19] took occasion by the law
[2:16:23] when they say don't steal automatically
[2:16:25] they put you
[2:16:26] in temptation then the devil comes and
[2:16:28] begin to say go ahead and steal
[2:16:30] go ahead and steal go ahead and say
[2:16:31] because now if you do it it's a sin
[2:16:34] ever clear so when the law was brought
[2:16:37] in israel
[2:16:38] their law corner the human people
[2:16:41] because grace was still not given a day
[2:16:44] yet
[2:16:45] fully yet when the law was given
[2:16:50] adultery was still working there god
[2:16:53] came and said
[2:16:54] you shall not commit adultery you shall
[2:16:56] not kill the child
[2:16:58] as god did that israel now was tempted
[2:17:02] for adultery
[2:17:04] you follow me then they came to moses
[2:17:09] they said moses what can we do i don't
[2:17:12] like this woman
[2:17:13] i don't like this woman moses look
[2:17:16] he said the law they give them there is
[2:17:19] no man that can leave this law
[2:17:21] it's a tight law you do this they kill
[2:17:24] you you do this they kill you
[2:17:26] if this is what you want joshua
[2:17:29] where is the emergency kit i'm having a
[2:17:32] problem of marriage and divorce
[2:17:36] i must free these because they are
[2:17:38] children of god
[2:17:40] god put them into the bondage of the law
[2:17:43] they can't help it because the worshiper
[2:17:47] was not purged yet that's why they were
[2:17:50] keeping the desire
[2:17:52] of sin it is not their fault
[2:17:55] god gave them the law but god did not
[2:17:59] purge their conscience
[2:18:01] as a head i need to use a grace
[2:18:06] bring me the emergency kit joshua came
[2:18:10] again
[2:18:11] moses opened he pulled the bullet
[2:18:14] he said if you don't like your wife
[2:18:17] write her a letter of divorcement and
[2:18:20] just go ahead and send her away
[2:18:22] and when jesus came he never
[2:18:25] contradicted moses
[2:18:31] are you there paul
[2:18:34] came also and found marriage and divorce
[2:18:38] trouble and the people still struggle
[2:18:43] in first corinthians chapter seven paul
[2:18:45] say
[2:18:46] but to the rest speak who
[2:18:50] who was i not who
[2:18:54] let me go back up but i paul
[2:18:58] speak this by what and not
[2:19:01] of a what who gave him permission to
[2:19:04] speak
[2:19:08] he was the messenger to the angel
[2:19:13] i not the lord
[2:19:17] if any brother has a wife that believe
[2:19:20] not
[2:19:21] and she be pleased to dwell with him let
[2:19:24] him not put her water
[2:19:28] and a christian she's not a christian i
[2:19:30] need to chase her

[2:19:56] me saying not god me
[2:20:00] paul i give you permission stay with

[2:20:09] and the woman which has a husband
[2:20:12] that believe not and if he be pleased to
[2:20:15] dwell with her
[2:20:16] let her not do what do not divorce stay
[2:20:20] there
[2:20:21] put it on my account when you go to
[2:20:24] heaven
[2:20:25] tell god me paul gave you that decision
[2:20:29] show him my ticket
[2:20:35] when you write a check
[2:20:38] and your check bounced back
[2:20:41] by law the bank have a right to
[2:20:45] kick you off a draft but if you go to a
[2:20:49] supervisor
[2:20:53] the supervisor has a power
[2:20:56] to reverse that of a draft
[2:20:59] even though you did it he can say i
[2:21:03] forgive you
[2:21:04] go ahead reimburse the money and the
[2:21:07] banks say
[2:21:10] i agree
[2:21:15] are you there when brother branham
[2:21:18] came to his time
[2:21:22] he found people cornered
[2:21:26] they will have married their divorce
[2:21:29] they married their divorce they go out
[2:21:32] and they begin to marry other women and
[2:21:35] they might be
[2:21:36] in their second marriage or third
[2:21:38] marriage or fourth marriage
[2:21:40] but when the message came as
[2:21:43] predestinated seed of god
[2:21:45] they received the message but the
[2:21:49] message
[2:21:50] comes like a pure word of god
[2:21:53] when the message came the message told
[2:21:56] them
[2:21:57] because of your condition you cannot
[2:22:00] enter heaven
[2:22:03] and the pressure was now brought to the
[2:22:07] head
[2:22:08] they brought it in question and answer
[2:22:12] brother branham this is my condition
[2:22:16] what can i do
[2:22:19] brother branham check the scripture it
[2:22:22] is locked
[2:22:24] he checked the scripture it is locked
[2:22:27] god came in the mountain
[2:22:30] and say william branham do you
[2:22:34] understand why moses gives a letter of
[2:22:36] disbursement
[2:22:40] did you ever see me contradict moses
[2:22:44] brother i'm saying no no no no no no he
[2:22:46] said okay
[2:22:47] do you remember paul says that this is
[2:22:50] me

[2:22:55] in my holy bible

[2:23:24] brother branham said he had that
[2:23:26] revelation before
[2:23:28] he could not preach because the children

[2:29:09] minister that is responsible is a pastor
[2:29:14] don't ever discuss a subject
[2:29:18] of marriage and divorce with someone

[2:30:13] brother
[2:30:13] want to talk to a pastor or to a deacon
[2:30:16] don't block them
[2:30:19] you need to understand that the head
[2:30:22] have a special grace
[2:30:25] to unlock situation that is not
[2:30:28] on your competency
[2:30:34] they are the one like to go down
[2:30:37] and play to the water the pastor will
[2:30:41] judge the situation
[2:30:43] and when he found the situation god will

[2:47:59] adultery amen the pharisees made a
[2:48:03] mistake
[2:48:04] they didn't know that woman was

[2:48:59] jesus drop down and begin to write
[2:49:04] and they say rewarding for your eyes
[2:49:09] jesus said let me teach this pharisee
[2:49:11] something

[2:49:39] one out two out
[2:49:42] three out by lord they had the right to
[2:49:47] kill him
[2:49:48] but when mercy is closed
[2:49:51] there is a grace door that can reopen
[2:49:56] to make the child of god pass
[2:50:00] are you there jesus look when the last
[2:50:04] one
[2:50:04] went he said where

[2:50:39] could turn back again
[2:50:41] with the law of moses and the evidence

[2:51:32] is not them
[2:51:35] i forgive you
[2:51:39] it is a power not to destroy
[2:51:43] a power to build up
[2:51:47] when all mercy seems to be closed
[2:51:50] when you are under a tight situation
[2:51:54] when you made a bad decision
[2:51:57] you found yourself in a difficult
[2:51:59] marriage
